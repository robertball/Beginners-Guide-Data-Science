This recipe is excellent and easy to make. The caramel is rich, buttery and just plain fantastic! I have been making it strictly for caramel apples (soft ball stage), and it stays on the apple even when loaded with nuts, candies, etc. Everyone who tried it was just raving about it. *Tip: 1 lb of brown sugar = 2 1/2 cups.

I love this recipe!  Only thing is, I've never understood the temperature given on the original.  I always cook to about 254 or so on a very accurate thermometer, to make caramel squares that stay squares on their own for days, but still get chewy when you eat them.

This caramel was PERFECT for making filled chocolates! I only used approx. 2/3 cup of corn syrup(All I had left!) and let it get to about 250 degrees. I let it set overnight and made the chocolates the next day. So delicious! I will DEFINATELY be making this again!
One suggestion though- butter only the sides of the pan and place parchment paper on the bottom- You won't have a problem with it sticking.

I added the vanilla between steps 1 and 2, since it wasn't specified in the directions. Tastes good, but my batch seems a tad too soft; I'm going to try chilling it for a bit before attempting to cut and wrap peices. This recipe is definitely easy!! And not too messy; I'll probably try it again sometime and see if I can get the consistency right.
Update: They are a smash hit at the office!! Everyone is raving about them. I chilled before wrapping, and then kept them refrigerated overnight--not one mention of them being too soft.

I just wasn't impressed with this recipe. You may appreciate this recipe if you like softer caramel, but I prefer a more chewy caramel and this was too soft for my liking. It also tasted VERY strongly of brown sugar instead of the buttery, mellow flavor of caramel. It was easy to make and the directions were good. However, I won't be making these again.

This recipe IS WONDERFUL !! I cooked it to firm ball stage about 248 ( about 20 min).  It is a very easy recipe that will impress family and friends.  I omitted the vanilla and used dark brown sugar.  I also used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 as I like thicker pieces of caramel.

Great recipe! Tips for perfect caramels that my Grandma gave me: After you mix all the ingredients except Vanilla use a cold wet paper towel to wipe down inside of pan up to caramel and throughout cooking make sure you stir gently as not to deposit lots of caramel on the edges of the pan. It only takes a small amount of undissolved sugar to ruin caramels.  Also be sure to stir often and rinse and dry your spoon often as this keeps uneven caramel from getting mixed.  Definetely cook the caramels to about 250f if you want to wrap them.  And add the vanilla AFTER you shut the heat off.  ENJOY!

The taste of this recipe is awesome!  One fault that I had, I forgot to put the vanilla.  It doesn't even need it.  Next time I would definitly cook til 245-250F.  It was still a little soft.  I rolled it into balls and used on turtles.  I will make again, but will cook longer so that they can be wrapped.

Delicious!  This recipe is a big hit with friends and family.  It is a no-fail recipe.  I follow the recipe as written, alhtough I always add the vanilla during the last minute or two of cooking time before transferring to a 9x13 pan.

VERY IMPORTANT!  Here's the deal, the taste of this caramel is AMAZING. Here's the problem, the temp posted is for "soft ball" stage... great for apples, not great for candies. 248 is the proper "hard ball" temp to use for caramels. If you use the 234 and try to make these as wrapped caramels, you will have nothing but a great tasting, big mess. I refrigerated mine to firm them up, but then they stuck to the wax paper like there's no tomorrow. Never the less, I've peeled, and peeled, that paper off because they taste so amazing. Just wish the recipe would have started with the correct cooking temperature for what you'd actually wrap!

YUM, I added the vanilla along with the other ingredients while bringing to boil came out great.  Also added it between the first and second step as stated below works fine also.  Dont think think you can screw this up unless you get the heat too high.

This recipe has been in our family for over 20 years as "Easy Microwave Caramels".  Use a 2 quart microwave safe bowl.  Mix the ingredients, pop into the microwave for 2 minutes, stir, cook 2 more minutes, stir, then cook for about 12 - 14 minutes (no need to stir) until it reaches 245 degrees.  At that point, I test every minute until it is done.  So much easier and faster than cooking it on the stove and it doesn't burn.  My recipe says let it sit 10 minutes when it comes out of the microwave, stirring a couple of times, before pouring into the pan.

This recipe is DIVINE!  This was my very first time attempting to make candy of any kind and it was SO easy.  I did take the recommendation of others and cooked the mixture until it hit 248 F.  This gave the caramel a soft and chewy consistency (but not sticky).  It tastes just like the caramels I used to buy in those specialty stores and confectioneries.  I omitted the vanilla extract simply because I didn't have any on hand and it did not detract from the delicious taste.  I found the best way to cool the caramel was dumping it out on a WELL GREASED cookie sheet that has short sides.  I covered with a piece of wax paper and foil and allowed to cool 1 day on the counter.  I used a large knife to cut into bite sized pieces.  The hardest part was taking the time to wrap each candy because this recipe yields ALOT of caramel.  I brought them into my office and no one could believe I made these and they were gobbled up very quickly.  Be careful...they are ADDICTING!  

If you have never made caramel, do not be frightened.  This was my first time and I am going to use this recipe for many years to come. Great as a Christmas gift for those who you need to just get "a little something" (teachers, neighbors, co workers, boss) and VERY CHEAP if you consider how much candy this one recipe yields.

amazing!!  make sure to take your time when cooking- DO NOT raise the temperature, keep it on medium heat!  Follow directions, it will turn out perfect. It takes about 20 minutes to cook.      I used waxed paper size: 2 1/2" x 4 1/2" to wrap. Perfect gift for holidays! Worth the time.

I made these for my father on Father's Day and he loved them! These caramels have a wonderful flavor.  I didn't have a candy thermometer but tried cooking it to the soft ball stage, but thought it too soft and cooked it a bit longer.  I then refrigerated it and it turned out as hard as a piece of Wuthier's candy.  I then inverted the pan and pulled out the entire piece of caramel and broke it into smaller pieces using the back of a spoon (be careful as it can shatter into sharp shards)Then, just before eating, I microwaved a piece in the microwave for about 8 seconds - it turned out into a wonderful soft piece of caramel - absolutely delicious.  My father liked them just the way they turned out and asked me to cook the next batch to the hard candy stage - So don't despair if you think you've ruined them by overcooking -you just have a different creation.

This is the recipie I have used a few times.  One warning:  make sure you are ready to wrap up most of this to give away, otherwise you will eat the whole pan!  When I make these I put some chocolate chips in the bottom of the 9 X 13 pan on some wax paper, I put that on a warm surface until the chocolate melts, then I spread it around to coat the bottom of the pan.  Then I fill the pan with pretzle twists.  When the caramel is done cooking I pour it over the pretzels.  When the caramels had set up part way, but still warm, I put more chocolate chips on top and spread tham around.  You can sprinkle finely chopped nuts on top of this if you like, or leave it plain.  Of course, if the chocolate is not spead evenly the nuts can help make it look nicer.

VERY,VERY,VERY easy to make and VERY yummy to eat. So soft and so chewy. I have never had anything even close to this. It puts store package to shame... I did make a mistake in thinking if I placed on a wax paper lined baking sheet it would help me to lift out. Not a good idea as it will stick even if you spray it so my advice is stik to keeping it in a greesed baking sheet as it will lift out easier. I also cut into pieces with my pizza cutter. i went to a craft store and bought candy wrapper and after cutting them I rolled them in the papers to give out as gifts. I frooze them as well until I was ready to hand them out. I found they turned out just as soft, just as chewy and just as fresh by doing so. this way I can spread out my baking and not worry about anything going bad. Or stressing over baking everything thr week of the holiday. I have enough to do then besides bake. It worked for me so I hope it will work for you. Thank you so much for sharing.

I wanted to comment because I think some reviewers are not quite accurate in their information. 1 pound of brown sugar does not in any way equal about 1 1/4 cups. If you will notice a 2 pound bag of sugar you buy from most any grocery store notes that it equals about 4 and 2/3 PACKED cups. I hope this helps future confectioners!

Great recipe!  I have tried many caramel recipes and this one is by far the easiest.  I cooked this twice during the holidays as the first batch didn't last long.  I found the best way to make sure I cooked it to 248 degrees exactly was to bring it to that temperature in a cast iron pan and then as soon as it hit the temp I wanted I took it off the burner and continued to stir it for another minute before pouring it into my 8x8 inch pan.  I would not recommend continuing to stir it for 3 minutes after you hit your desired temp as the recipe tells you to do since your temp can rise quickly on you and your stuck with rockhard caramel.

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone ask for them and wants more.  I always do a double batch which eliminates the measuring for me because it is  1 lb butter 1 small bottle corn syrup 1 2lb bag brown sugar 2 cans sweeten condensed milk a dash of salt and splash of vanilla after you remove from heat. For those that said it didn't need the vanilla it is so much better with it try it again with it I have forgotten before and they are still good but much better with it. My sister said these are even better then her friends that have won awards for theirs so there you go. So i am telling you this is the only caramel recipe that you need!!!

These have a great flavor! (I added a little more than a dash of salt for contrast).   I cooked these to the hard ball stage like many others reviewers (a lot of stirring, about 20 mins).  When cooled the texture is firm to hard, not sticky.  As you eat them they soften up and become chewy and yummy!!! Big hit in our family! The Recipe makes a lot so it's great for holidays!

You MUST use butter!!!!  I've made this recipe seperate times with butter and then again with margarine.  The taste is no where near perfect with the margarine.  The butter is the ONLY way to go for that creamy flavor!!!

I cooked the mixture to a point where a spoonful dropped into a bowl of cold water made a nice little carmel ball.  Don't know what the temperature was.  I poured it onto a generously buttered jelly roll pan and let it cool before cutting it into about 150 bite-sized pieces.  Then wrapped (and wrapped and wrapped...) in waxed paper.  That should be about 35 or so calories for each one if my math is right.  Lots of candy!

Awesome recipe! Very easy to make and it was my first time, too. I doubled the recipe and it was enough to coat around 25 medium sized apples. ( I used red/royal gala-can't remember what the name was)  The caramel was yummy and the texture, I thought, really went well with the apples.  By the way I made these caramel apples for 16 to 24 years old and they really snapped them up!  I had left over caramel set and had them cut into cubes-and they were gobbled up too, and also by parents! The caramel colour was darker than what is found in stores but that didn't affect the flavour.  Overall, I will do this recipe again. Excellent!

This is the BEST Caramel recipe- the key to all candy recipes is to check your candy thermometer before each use. How do you do this-place the thermometer in a pan of water and bring to a boil. Check the thermometer and then adjust your cooking temps accourdingly. I have found I have to adjust as much as 10 to 12 degrees as the water is boiling at lower temps. 
How can this be: water boiling is affected by the amount of sodium in the water(are you using softened water?), the humidity, the altitude.

Heavenly!  They melt in your mouth. By far the most asked for treat that I make; My co-workers expect them yearly...and they quickly vanish.  I had never made candy before trying this recipe and have made this one now over and over again.  It works better with a non-stick pan (to cook the caramel) and the temperature is very important. I pour the hot caramel onto a buttered cookie sheet and I easily get over 100 caramels cut into tootsie roll or larger size.  I like to use this caramel now to make turtles.  Very easy to do by spreading clusters of pecans on the self-release aluminum foil; topping it with a square of the caramel and then putting in a warm oven until the caramel starts to melt; I then remove them from the oven and let the caramel set up again before I drizzle melted ghiradelli milk chocolate over them. MY FAVORITE RECIPE!!

I have made this recipe for 40+ years. I double the recipe and have not had any problems. It is almost fool proof as long as your thermometer is accurate. I check mine by placing in boiling water(it should read 212)and adjust accordingly. A long handled hi temp silicone spatula works the best for stirring. I line my pan with foil and butter the foil, it makes removal much easier. Variations: Add chopped nuts when you add the vanilla. Chocolate caramels, add 4 squares unsweetened baking chocolate, chopped(for a double batch) after adding the vanilla. Stir until chocolate is melted and well blended.

I just made this for the first time and it is so very good. The only adjustment I made was to the cooking temp. Caramel should be cooked to the firm ball state (248 degrees). Soft ball (240) would leave it to mushy and hard ball (260) to hard. Note too that you have to stir this CONTINUOUSLY from start to finish. I walked away for 30 seconds to get a drink before it had even reached a boil and it scorched just enough to leave some dark flecks in it (luckily I don't think it affected the flavor).

I covered the caramels in chocolate. The second time I cooked them exactly like the recipe called for with a thermometer and they were too sticky, they there stuck in my teeth. It is easy to make, but hard to get the right consistancy.

This really was a great recipe. I got a lot of compliments on the candy. I would strongly recommend a very large heavy pot. My pot was too small and I had to split it up to finish it. It also started to scorch near the end because the pot wasn't heavy enough. Very tasty despite the trouble.

I think the directions could be more clear on the boiling: keep on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until reaching 220degF, then reduce heat to low, stirring for 3 min.  Remove from heat, etc...  Other than that, I say that this is a pretty solid recipe.

These tasted SOOOO good! And they're very soft, perfect for coating in chocolate. I think I didn't cook them quite long enough, but I think they're great. I also added the vanilla between steps 1 & 2, after removing from heat since this recipe didn't specify when to add it. My only problem was getting the caramels out of the pan. I buttered it, but I still couldn't get them to come out. I had to pull out chunks and roll them with my hands. Any suggestions?

They're a little soft, but that may be my doing (this is my first time making caramels). I added about half a tsp of cardamom and they are DELICIOUS!

Definitely follow all the directions!!!  It takes a very long time (around 20 min of continuous boiling) for this to come out perfect!  Oh, make sure you grease your scissors with butter before you cut the caramel and DO use the scissors b/c a knife just doesn't work!!!!!  Awesome results!  I used dark brown sugar and it came out perfect!

I've never made caramel before, but it will be a household treat from now on. Easiest candy recipe i've ever tried, and so good.(i used dark brown sugar and dark cornsyrup) I let it cook until 248 degrees, took off heat, added vanilla, poured on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, stuck in fridge. 30min later i pulled out, cut in perfect squares with pizza cutter, wrapped in 3x3" wax paper, stuck in bowl in fridge. Soooo Goood.  will try different flavors for Christmas for variety: cinnamon,chili-powder,butter-rum,cocoa. Just have to figure how to split the batch up after cooking to add the flavors..

Fabulous recipe and very easy, especially for my first candy making experience.  DH thinks it's good enough to sell.  This recipe makes a lot of caramel, much more than the 32 servings given in the recipe guide.  Not a bad thing but be prepared.  Will definitely make again.

I made these last week and they didn't last 3 days.  I gave several away and my husband and kids ate the rest.  When I cooked the mixture, I had to increase the temp to 254 because it was way too soft otherwise.  These are better than the caramels we used to buy in Canada on special trips.

This is a fabulous recipe.  Since I was covering apples with caramel, I needed a little more than this recipe called for.  I ended up making another recipe in this site that didn't call for brown sugar.  It was good, but I have to admit that the brown sugar gives the caramel a deeper, richer flavor.  I ended up combining the two candies and came out with a fantastic caramel.  The only change I made was to reduce the butter by half.  It was not greasy at all.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks so much!

First - making any candy without an accurate thermometer is asking for disaster because heat every heat source is different.
Second - accuracy is essential, weigh if possible rather measure.
Finally - I've made these literally dozens of times with consistent results. I use a heavy bottomed pan, small burner electric stove set on medium I melt the butter, then add the brown sugar and a good pinch of salt. Let the sugar dissolve for a couple minutes, add the corn syrup (in a 1 cup measure sprayed with cooking spray, it will slide right out), mix well and add condensed milk, stirring constantly. Increase heat to med. high, #6 on my stove, bring it to a boil, about 6 minutes. The butter will incorporate nicely, insert the thermometer and bring to 245 stirring constantly. Remove from heat stir in vanilla. I use a ungreased 9x13  pan lined with parchment. Pour it in let in sit at room temp for 15 or 20 minutes and refrig for 2 hours n cut to size. I wrap them in  wax paper n store in the refrig. Melt in your mouth chewy every time.  Sorry this is so long but these are really excellent when done right. I hope this helps, good luck!

I used this caramel recipe for caramel apples and was VERY impressed with how they turned out.  The caramel sets up very quickly, so next time I am going to make sure I have the nuts chopped up before I dip the apples.  I had to press the nuts and M&Ms into the caramel because I thought I would have more time.  Live and learn, but I will definitely use this recipe again.

Only change was I used white sugar as I didn't have any brown! I also didn't use a candy thermometer, just used the soft ball test and it turned out great! I had no issues with it setting up and yes it is chewy, hence then name chewy caramel! It was SOOOOO good, creamy, chewy, sweet and terrible for my belly! Thanks

WOW!!  Delicious. Soft. Chewy. Buttery. Heaven.  I cooked it to 242 and used it for a few caramel apples.  I had some leftover so a sprayed a bowl with Pam and poured it in and let it cool.  I was later able to dump it in a crockpot, heat on low and used it again when I did more.  Awesome!

Remarkably delicious.  I only heated it to 148F, so mine was a tad soft, but I'll know better next time.  The volume does increase remarkably while boiling, so use a large enough pan.  Raising the vanilla to 2 tsp will probably also work well.  My batch, though far too soft, got gobbled up pretty quickly anyway.  This should *not* be made by anyone trying to lose weight. ;-)

I can't say enough about these caramels!  They are fantastic!!  The scaling is off on the recipe though--it makes much more than 32 servings.  I am able to get about 200 bit size candies out of it.  I individually wrap them in wax paper and give them as Christmas gifts.  Everyone raves about them.  Also, I subsitute the sweetened milk for evaporated milk.  It's not a small project by any means.  It takes close to an hour for the caramel to reach the proper temperature and another 1 or so to wrap them.  The end product is well worth the time!  Thanks a bunch!!

Thank you for the review that said 1 pound of brown sugar was 2.5 cups.  I was going to get my postal scale out and measure it that way.  This turned out good. I only cooked it to 245 degrees so mine were soft.  Not teeth pullers.:)

Don't know if it's beginner's luck, but I actually found this really easy to make. I didn't make any changes to the ingredients. One difference in the process is based on a category of Indian sweets called barfis - I turned off the heat when the mixture started leaving the sides of the pan, a time -tested method that doesn't need thermometer or guesswork. It set perfectly and could be cut into squares easily at room temperature.

YUMMMM!  I cooked mine to more like 234 degrees or so---it was fairly soft but everyone who tried it said they prefer it that way. It wasn't filling pulling chewy/sticky---it more melted in your mouth.  Just made another batch.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

My first attempt at making caramels was a success thanks to this recipe!  I have been baking for as long as I can remember, however candy has always intimidated me.  A few weeks before Christmas, my Mom's beau mentioned how he missed his Mom's homemade caramels (this was the 2nd Christmas after her passing), so I gave it a shot.  The look on his face when he opened a giant package of homemade caramels took him from 60 back to 5yrs old - he said he was hoarding them all to himself and not sharing, lol.  Good thing I kept some at home, bc my 2.5yr old has been asking to "try" them all weekend. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe - I'll be making them for years to come.

Well, I can't tell you what went right with this recipe but I can tell you what NOT to do...don't substitute heavy cream for sweetened condensed milk.  Heavy cream has more oil and the oil seeps out while the caramel is hardening and its awful.  It also must increase the time needed to cook since it took FOREVER -maybe it dilutes the protein content of the carmel. Don't put new dish washing gloves on the kids so they can pull the caramel.  It sticks and is really really messy (although it was hilarious).  Don't put it in a smallish pan as it will grow as it boils and want to boil over.  Hmm what else did we do wrong?  I think that's it -first time to try this and I don't dare blame the recipe -maybe I should have followed it!!  :)

Delicious, great flavor. I really recommend using half the butter though. especially if you are going to use this to make carameled apples because with this much butter it barely sticks to the apple. To cook the mixture i leave it on medium heat for about 8 minutes constantly stirring. I think the directions were a little confusing on that part. Just wait till its a little thick. I use a non stick pan which just makes it easier. If you are going to make apples roll the apples in the caramel right after you take it off the heat. Good Luck!

I would give this 5 stars but the recommended temp. was too low. If you want to cut and wrap them you might want to cook them to a higher tempature.  I cooked mine to 250 deg.  and it came out perfect.  We made carmel apples with it.

Oh My......these were soooo yummy!  I couldn't believe my first batch turned out absolutely perfect.  Invest in a good candy thermometer, because the consistancy of these caramels really depends on getting them to the right temperature before pouring them into the pan.  Will be a staple on my Christmas baking list from now on!

All I can say is about these are "Oh my gosh!!!" These are so good and melt in your mouth. I did have to redo the first batch I made because they did't set right, so I took the advice of others on here and cooked it until 250- the hard ball stage and it came out perfect. I'm going to be making a another batch real soon. I won't ever make a different recipe for these ever again. Only this one. Make these... you won't be disappointed.

best tasting caramels I have ever tasted.  It took a long time to cook to the right consistency-but cooked over low-medium heat.  I sprayed scissors with Pam to prevent sticking.

Delicious! I used it to make caramel apples and I could have made 8-10 small-medium apples. My advice for others doing this...1) the caramel needs to be cooked past the soft ball stage. When left to sit at room temp the caramel started sliding off the apples. I'd suggest firm ball stage. 2) Let the caramel COOL a bit before starting to dip your apples. I put mine in the freezer first then dipped them and the first 2 all of the caramel just pooled at the bottom. 3) After you dip hold them in the air for a minute or so twirling them to let the caramel set, then roll in nuts or set on greased wax paper in the fridge/freezer to harden the caramel thoroughly. My husband said these were the best caramel apples he has ever had, and he LOVES caramel apples!

I tried this for the first time tonight.  I went exactly by the recipe.  It turned out so good.  My husband and I almost made ourselves sick eating them. It is certainly, by far, better than any store bought caramels I have ever tasted.  I Love This Recipe.

First time making caramels, turned out great!  Cooked til 248 degrees.  Helps to very lightly butter the squares of wax paper so they do not stick when wrapping themup.  My new holiday tradition.  Yum!

I've made these caramels many times now. I don't have a candy thermometer so each time they come out with a little difference in hardness. Nonetheless, they are a favorite every time. P.S. A secret learned from a friend of mine is a sprinkle of sea salt topping each morsel. Try it.

Thank goodness I lost my old recipe, or I wouldn't have tried this one! I heated to 245, and these little treats hold their shape perfectly-I won't have to individually wrap them to keep them separate! Thanks again!

CAUTION: This is totally addicting. Made it while I was watching Biggest Loser. Go figure...when I tasted it....OMG..this is soooooooooo yummy. I heated mine up to 248 degrees and it was able to come to a boil at medium heat. I did not put it in the fridge but let it set on parchment paper overnight. I also had trouble peeling off the parchment paper but I used a blow dryer to soften up the caramel and the paper peeled off much easier, just be patient but totally worth it. Don't ever use maragarine this has to be made with butter. And, I did use two piches of salt and they came out perfect. I am going to use these caramel pieces to make a caramel pecan pie, from this site. Thanks for submitting!!

OMG!!!! This is the best recipe ever!!! I am so excited about this recipe.  I needed a fundraiser for my class for field trips.  I want to sell caramel apples, and was looking for a recipe that I could make cheaper than the bulk caramel prices and this it it.  I have been trying recipes the last three days and this is the 5 star.  I will not seek another recipe since I have this one. It will be my go to.  I used this to coat caramel apples, and it did great.  For the price of $5, I can coat 13-15 apples depending on how thick i coat it.

This recipe had really good flavor, however the cooking time is off.  I cooked mine to approx. 248 degrees for around 5 minutes.  The caramels were perfect once chilled in the refrigerator but if left at room temperature they were a bit too soft.

Wowza!  These are so delicious!  It took me two tries to get this right, but I am so glad I persisted.  The key is to be really patient when cooking the mixture, don't rush!  Slow and low (burner temp) is the way to go.

This is an excellent easy way to make caramel! I put it on top of pretzels and then cover them in chocolate. 
If your caramel is grainy, there is a good chance water or condensation got into it. Try to cool it in an area with low humidity. If it is too hard, it got too hot. Check your thermometer, and use the soft ball test. It only takes a second to be cooked too long.

This was my first time making candy, and it was so much easier than I had expected. I cooked it for 2 min. past softball stage, like the recipe said. It was a little soft, but they are great when kept in the fridge. The taste is awesome. There was hardly any mess, either. I buttered the sides and outside edges of the bottom of the pan, then I placed in parchment paper, leaving hangover to pull it out with. I used a pizza cutter to cut it into strips, then a knife to cut the strips into squares. Very easy, even for a beginner! I will make this recipe again!

Perfect caramel - keep finding more uses for it! Chocolate covered caramels, caramel apples, or on their own are equally good. Firm ball stage is perfect for most uses, or go about 130 for a good topping consistence. Makes wonderful caramel corn! I poured over microwave popcorn, mixed well, baked at 225 for 20 minutes. We like it salted after baking for the sweet and salty taste.

Tips:
Use real butter, not margerine. 
Temperature depends on how thick or hard you need it - higher temps=harder candy.
If you are out of brown sugar, 1c sugar + 1T molasses = 1c brown sugar. In this recipe, you can just add them both in, no need to mix ahead of time.

Scrumptious!  I was afraid I was going to pull out a filling, because I couldn't stop eating it!  I made this using a candy thermometer and it turned out the right consistency.  I needed the caramel to dip apples in, and it was perfect for that.  It got scorched a little, but you never knew when you ate it...very forgiving recipe for a novice candy maker!

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed the directions exclusively and it came out way too soft.  I can't use it to eat like candy and on the other hand it cannot be used for caramel sauce (I thought it was supposed to be of a soft consistency to eat like candy).  It stuck so bad to the pan that it's to sloppy to eat.

EXCELLENT!  These caramels turned out creamy and soft.  Just don't try to get the temp fast.  It took about 45 minutes of stirring to get it to the right temp. My arm was tired but it was well worth it.  Everyone loved the caramels and this reipe will be used often!

I have made this caramel for the last two x-mas's and I always get complements.I use paper candy cups and fill the bottom with chocolate then top with this caramel and toasted nuts. Delicious!This is a pretty easy recipe just make sure you keep stirring.

Used half dark brown & half light brown sugar.  Don't skimp on the salt; a VERY generous pinch enhances the flavor.  Turned out great.

Did not make changes to this recipe. Came out great. What I did do different is instead of a candy thermometer which gets in the way. I used a handheld Non contact Infrared Thermometer that you can get on Amazon for under 20 bucks. Heating up to 250 degrees took about 25 minutes. It works great, easy to read and does not need to be cleaned.

I followed the directions to a T.  The temperature specified made for too soft of a caramel; they do not hold shape at all.  Also, the biggest reason for my rating is that the flavor of the condensed milk stood WAY out and they are wicked sweet.  These taste just like brown sugar stirred into sweetened condensed milk.  I love caramels and sweets, but this recipe isn't for me, sorry.

The caramel never hardened and I followed the recipe exactly. I did what one member suggested and did it to a bit of a higher temp. Its not even set up enough to roll into balls they just melt back down. Im going to see if theres someway to save it, or make toffee from it.

These are amazing!! In have made 3  batches of them just in the last week and they do not last long, my grandchildren could eat them in a matter of hours if I let them. I will certainly make more and not just for Christmas. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I make this recipe every single year!!!!!  I don't even like store bought caramels, and I can't get enough of these!  This year, I decided to try sprinkling some sea salt on top of the mixture as soon as it was in the pan....  It made them even better!  Next I'm going to try dipping them in milk chocolate, and then sprinkling them with sea salt...  YUMMO!!!!!!!!

These are a big hit with my family and friends. I also sprinkle sea salt on them - even more delicious. Note - this is very soft caramel and sometimes I find it difficult to work with. I keep it very cold when cutting and wrapping and only cut up a little at a time. I've never been able to "cut with scissors" as the recipe notes, but a big knife and lots of wax paper does the trick.

Oh dear.  This is heavenly.  Not too many recipes impress me as much as this.  I no longer have to spend $.050 per caramel.  I have a new addiction.  I followed the recipe exactly accept for one thing.  I added some extra salt because I like salty caramel.  Yum.  Thank you!!!

This Caramel was AMAZING!!!!  I live in a small town and the only store we have didn't have caramel to make turtles. I found this recipe and fell in love. The turtles turned out great and there was a lot of caramel left over so I cut it up into pieces and froze it. I have since pulled some of it out when I needed caramel and it was still amazing!

This recipe is even better than my mom's as it is a softer version. Make sure to cook above 235 for more than 3 minutes or it will be too soft. Never fear, though, as you can then use that batch as a sauce, and make another....I give these as gifts, and EVERYONE loves them! PS 1 pound is about 1 1/4 cups of brown sugar.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for to make turtles! When it got to 240 degrees, I put a 2 minute timer on. At the end of the 2 minutes, it was around 250. This turned out perfect for what I needed. If you're looking to make caramel cubes, you'll definitely need to cook it to a higher temp, but for anything covered in chocolate - this is the recipe for you. :)

Excellent! Only thing needing a tweak was the temp. It needs to be 248-250.   Rich, creamy, chewy, just plain yummy.

These are excellent.  I had the recipe a long time ago, so it's nice to find it again.  Many people like the caramels that take forever to cook slowly, but I can't tell the difference.

I just made these, my first candy ever, and I have to say, it wasn't that hard.  I made the mistake of stirring too long - once it boils you need to step away from the pot and let it boil so that the temperature can rise to at least 245 deg.  As long as your heat is only simmering, it will be fine.  The caramels are really creamy and easily topped with a spoon of chocolate and then sprinkled with sea salt - they are lovely to look at, and very tasty.

This recipe is amazing! I made it with my siblings for fun, and it turned out great! This was my first 100% successful attempt at candy making and I was pleased that the end result came out so well. Scrumptious flavor; the ingredient portions were perfect. I cooked it to about 248 degrees and it set very well, plus, the texture was superb. Thank you for the fantastic recipe. I'll most definitely make it again.

This recipe is great! It is just what the recipe name says Chewy Carmel. I used this recipe for caramel apples. I made 15 small caramel apples and had left over caramel. A candy thermometer is a must! By the way 1 pound is 2 1/2 cups. I used parchment paper to wrap the remaining caramels in. SOOOO good!

Very good. I followed the directions exactly. I also dipped 1/2 the batch in some really good melted chocolate chips and have not yet tried them, but my husband also suggested that I get some marshmallow cream and put that on top of a square of caramel and then put chocolate on top. Sort of like something a particular candy store makes. Anyhow, very good. Thanks for sharing!

These were very tasty although did not harden enough. We had to individually wrap in wax paper after they were completely cool. Then placed in refrigerator.

I make this recipe every year for Christmas.  Its in the Red and White Better Homes cookbook.  The only difference is that mine calls for 1 tsp of vanilla and you cook till "firm" ball. You really need make sure you cook till firm ball and you need to cook slowly, lots of stirring.  My Caramels are always a hit and expected at the holidays.

I'll never buy another bag of caramels  again. I cooked the caramel until it reached 250 degrees and used it to dip apples. They turned out wonderful. I had enough caramel to cover 15 apples. You can also make this a day ahead and reheat it with no problem. Next time,I'm making turtles.

I ended up with caramel that was soft until it set, now it's rock hard.  Not very tasty either...

My husband says these are the best carmels he has ever had and I agree!  It is an easy recipe.  I cooled them in the refrigerator and they turned out easier to cut than when I just cooled them at room temp.

Love this recipe! Hadn't made these since my grandma taught me a really really long time ago. First try they didnt seem like they were going to set up after I had poured them to cool (had only gone to 240) so I dumped it all back in the pan and turned it back on. Got it up to a little over 250 as a couple of reviews had suggested, they set up perfectly. Also added chopped pecans. Yum.

I love the flavor of this, but for some reason whenever I made them, they were too hard.  I finally just cooked them to 230 degrees instead of the suggested 234 to 240, and I took it immediately off the stovetop once it reached that temperature.   (I didn't cook it the additional 2 min).  It turned out perfect.  Also, make sure your butter is unsalted.  I made it once with salted butter.  It makes a bit of a funky flavor.

This is an awesome caramel recipe!  If you want firm, chewy caramel that you can wrap in wax paper, I suggest you cook it to the 248 degrees that some others have done.  Otherwise, you will end up with very soft, runny caramel.  I made a batch last night and I just finished cutting and wrapping it this morning.  It turned out perfectly and tastes delicious!

I didn't really like this at all. I tried cooking at 250* like others suggested but it was still very soft.
Also, do not put wax paper in the bottom of your pan. I tried this and the wax paper ended up sticking and I had to throw the whole thing away. Otherwise it would have been waxpaper caramel.
I guess I cold have done something wrong but I doubt it as all the women in my family were there to make our Christmas candy together.

I'm rating this a 2 because the taste was just ok. I would have eaten it if it hadn't been for the problems with the paper.

I don't have a problem with this recipe at all. It is considered the perfect caramel by most who eat it. My friends have taken to calling it "crack" because it is just as addicting. I brought a huge gladware container of it to a  party; it was demolished within a half hour. Thanks for the great recipe!

it tasted good but it never hardened. it stayed as soft as it did when it came out of the pot. I even tried to put it in the fridge like other reviews said, but it still didn't harden.

This had a very good flavor, but mine did not set up very well.  It ended up a nice caramel sauce for dipping apple slices into.

Scorched quickly and tasted terrible. Too heavy on the brown sugar. Will stick with my normal white sugar recipe and prefer to add the sugar and creme last.

I made these for Christmas gifts, and they turned out great! If you cook it to 250°, you’ll have a very hard candy. I cooked it to 235° then for an additional minute and poured it into a 9x13 pan. The caramels came out exactly as they should have, soft and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wrapped them in 3” square wax paper.

There must be something seriously wrong with the cook time or temperature in this recipe unless we are doing something fundamentally wrong! 

We are giving 3 stars as we might do something we are not supposed to even though we have tried it out a couple of times. 

Possible Tip:
Second time around, however, we put the caramel in the oven at 175 degrees celsius after boil for 30 minutes and we achieved half decent caramels.

This recipe makes delicious caramel that is as its name says chewy. I made it once and learned that the recipe does in fact need to be stirred constantly even when combining ingredients over medium heat. Otherwise the caramel will burn.

I made this recipe last night and it is fantastic!! I made it pretty much as is. I heated it to 240 it took about 20 min. and it is perfect!! I put it in a jelly roll pan with parchment paper and had no problem with it. I will make this again. It is a snap.

This was my first time making caramel and it came out awesome!! I forgot to put the pinch of salt and the vanilla because I was so excited that I was making caramel! It tasted delicious anyways! I did listen to the reviews though and made sure it cooked long to reach the higher temperature. I dont have a candy thermometer so I kinda guessed. Cooked it for 20minutes on medium heat. 

Thanks for this recipe! It is sooo delicious and everyone loves it, even my mother who is a salty kinda snacker, she was impressed!

This caramel is awesome! After reading and following some reviewer's suggestions, I found this really wonderful! I like the softer caramels too, I doubled the recipe, cooked to the soft ball stage plus 2 mins, used parchment paper, buttered the sides of a jelly roll pan, and let it sit all day before wrapping it up. After a few practice wraps, I finally got the size and how to wrap each piece. I think I will try making it again and boil it to the firm ball stage. At any rate, I'm sending this to school for our teachers  sweets exchange! Looking forward to their positive comments!

I have made this caramel recipe twice now. The first time, I followed the recipe almost exactly (had to adjust boiling time for altitude). It was perfect!! The second time, I substituted 1 cup honey instead of the light corn syrup. Again, Perfect!!!! The honey gives it a heartier or more wholesome flavor. YUM!!

These were delicious!
I had to use rice syrup instead of corn, but it didn't change the flavor at all so they came out SO YUMMY!
Key with this is to go slow. I'm impatient so had to really hold back from increasing the temp. It slowly but surely got to the proper temp though.
Next time, I think I'm going to heat it just a little longer. Soft ball texture is delicious and melts in your mouth, but I'd like it to be just a little more chewy.

I just got through letting this cool, and oh my gosh! I LOVE IT! I redid the recipe for 20 servings instead of 32. And cooked it the "Hard Ball" Stage so that I could work with it better later. It's amazing in my opinion. Buttery, rich, creamy, and almost nutty in flavor. Best caramel I've ever had, by far. I will never buy Caramel candies again.

This recipe is amazing and so simple! I didn't have vanilla but it didn't need it. I've made this recipe twice now and both times were just perfect.

I tried homemade caramel from a specialty shop and loved it but it was really expensive so I thought I would try making my own. I picked this recipe and am soooo glad I did. I have never made candy before and had to borrow a candy thermometer from my mom! *L* But this was super easy and from the rave reviews and requests for more that I have gotten, I'm not the only one who loves it! The only change I made was I cooked it up to the higher temp recommended by other reviewers and it turned out perfect. This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks so much for sharing :)

After many tries with store bought caramel with little success, I tried this recipe and it worked great for a recipe I make for homemade snickers candy.  The caramel adhered to the nougat layer and the chocolate layer without coming apart like other caramel I've tried.  This is a great recipe just as is and the 240 degrees works great for soft caramel.

Awesome recipe! I halved it and used 1/2 cup each of butter and corn syrup, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk. I also squeezed in a bit of honey just because. It took a while for it to get to the "soft ball" stage (probably 30ish minutes but I was patient and stirred it constantly). I then removed it from the heat and swirled granny smith apples on skewers around in it. After rolling the coated apples in chopped peanuts and then placing them in the freezer for about 10 minutes to set we had PERFECT caramel apples. Sliced two to eat and tightly wrapped the others in plastic wrap and placed in fridge. They kept well and were just as delicious the next few days! Just like the ones from the state fair!

I just made a batch a few hours ago, and I LOVE this recipie. I have never worked with sugar before, and was Super worried about over heating it, but it turned out perfectly!! I will use this again and again, because it tastes so good (I snuck a few bites. It was vinilla-y butter-y yumm!!)
Don't listen to the others who say it tastes bad, this is perfect! Just what I was looking for!

I didn't even entertain the idea of using scissors. I put the slab on a piece of wax paper and used a pizza cutter. It worked perfectly. I wasn't thrilled with the flavor of this recipe, but my mom loves it.

Ok...this is NOT a soft, melt in your mouth caramel if you cook to the hard ball stage of 248 degrees! The caramel is hard and like another cook mentions "sugar daddy like".  I was prying it out of my teeth! The flavor is good but I will try again at 230 degrees and update.

Awesome.  I cooked until 250 and sprinkled top lightly with fleur de sal once I poured into the pan.  Turned out wonderful.  Soft & chewy, but hold their shaper and aren't overly stringy.

Excellent recipe for caramel. I used it to make caramel apples with and it was wonderful. I boiled my apples for 10 mins then let them cool before dipping. (The caramel didn't want to stick to the apples because of the wax on them). It makes a lot of caramel. I made 2 batches and it did 22 apples with some left over. I actual dipped my apples twice. Once, then I let them cool and then one more time afterwards. The apples came out very thick with the caramel.  This is definently a keeper.

Perfect!  I do take them up to 248 degrees or so to get a chewier caramel.  But these taste delicious no matter how gooey or sticky they are anyway!

For a first time caramel maker, this was pretty easy and good. I used this recipe for caramel apples so I only got it to about 236 F and then immediately took it off and added the vanilla. The only thing I will change next time is adding more salt, I like really salty, creamy caramel.

This is a wonderful recipe to use for caramel apples. I've used it several times and always turns out great. You have to be extremely careful to watch towards the end because a few extra degrees can make for harder, darker caramel. I've made them for several people, and several people have said they were the best caramel apples they've ever had.

AWESOME! Definately a Soft caramel lovers caramel, very creamy and buttery. I could barely stop myself from eating all of them at once and everyone I gave them to had the same reaction. By the way This was my first time making caramels and I had no problem. I don't even have a candy thermometer, i just let it come to a boil continued stirring and took off the heat when I noticed the mixture had thickened.

I really like this recipe. I worked in a bakery for years and made hundreds of batches of caramel and this recipe is the closest ive found.You can also easily turn it into caramel sauce by melting it in a sauce pan and adding a bit of heavy cream. it keeps forever in the fridge, not that it will last very long its Delicious!:)

This is very easy and very good.  I would not call this "soft" caramel, though.  This turns out exactly like the prewrapped Kraft Caramels.  That was fine, but next time I will stop a little lower on the thermometer.  YUM!

I used all organic ingredients for this recipe. I used butter not margarine & brown rice syrup not corn syrup & it turned out fantastic.  I wanted to use this caramel for my turtles & they turned out fantastic.  With the leftover caramel, I first refrigerated it & then cut it into squares & covered them w/chocolate & they were fantastic! Everyone is raving over these.

Hubby and I thought this was divine!  It took me a couple times to make sure I got it all right....needed the candy thermometer-and had to make sure I kept boiling at the 240 temp for 3 minutes.  I will be giving this as gifts every Christmas!!  Thanks!

I followed the advice of others and cooked the caramel to 248 degrees.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was amazing.  Everyone loves it... we will definitely be making this one again!

So simple to make. I  liked the suggestion of using scissors to cut it with. I sprinkled with a little course sea salt for a sweet and salty treat.

Ok, I can't believe I have been paying $10.00 a lb. for these at my local Chocolate store. Wow, chewy and yummy. Get them wrapped in wax paper right away or you will eat the whole pan. These were much easier then I thought and actually had every item in my pantry. The most time consuming part is wrapping them but worth it. what a great christmas gift these will make.

I thought the flavor of these were great. I did mine to about 243 and was a little harder then I wanted. It was impossible to cut them and they were breaking so I couldn't get nice pieces to wrap. I will try again but won't heat as long. But very easy to make!

Awesome stuff! I used this to make turtles and they were a huge hit. I was a bit clumsy with my thermometer and ended up burning myself, but I sacrifice all for the candy!

My family has a cabin in Northern Michigan, and every time we go up there we stop at this little Amish Shop and buy caramels with cashews.  I wanted to try to duplicate them at home.  So I made this recipe, and when I added the vanilla I also added 1 can of cashew halves.  They turned out perfect.  They are so delicious and chewy, and my husband and kids absolutely go crazy for them!

Be sure to heat slowly. I tried upping the heat and scorched it all. But tried again and turned out great.

I made these for dipping apples. Wait for it to cool off a while before you dip or they will not stick.  WIth the leftovers I poured them in a 9X13 (i double everything) and poured salted cashews over it.  Once it cooled I took teaspoons of this mixture on waxed paper and poured melted chocolate over them to make turtles.  YUM!!

Very good taste however, it should be cooked a little longer to reach 250.  This recipe is quite soft.  I'll dip in chocolate to help firm up the candy.

I didn't cook it long enough the first time, but was able to get it back into the pan and cook it a little longer.  After cooking an extra 5 minutes, the caramel came out beautifully.  My sister loves homemade caramel and couldn't stop eating it.  I took it to school and it was gone in seconds.  Make sure you use parchment paper and not waxed paper or you'll be trying to peel off waxed paper in vain.

I did something wrong -  I used fat free evp. Milk (Thinking bout it now it really makes no sense seeing there is a cup of butter in this) am I suppose to stir 'constantly' while it boils?? I obviously have never used a candy thermometer b4.. Most reviews said 20 min.. I was going on 30 and it was only @ 210, I paniced & I took it off- didn't harden.. Re-boiled next day to 250- separated/ slightly burned, but my husband loved the flavor :p

I usually only cook this until it will make a good caramel sauce.  It's so much better than store bought, and I use it for apples, as well as recipes calling for a caramel drizzle over top.  Finger-licking good!!!

What a delicious recipe! GREAT suggestion to use parchment paper - it worked beautifully! My brother said it tasted too buttery, but I think it's great. I don't have a thermometer, but I've made a few different types of candy before and it isn't hard to tell where a batch of candy is temperature-wise based on how it reacts in cold water (soft ball, hard crack etc.) This one is especially easy because all you have to do is test it and when it feels like a "good" caramel texture, you're done! (Unlike fairy food, which isn't exactly the same because you add baking soda and alter the texture after you test it.)  Wonderful! Will make again!

Very good flavor to this. I found it a little hard to work with though, even after it set it was still pretty soft. I would recommend that you refrigerate it before cutting it into pieces if you are going to wrap/give it away. I am saving mine for a dessert recipe that calls for caramel, I'll repost after trying it. Thanks~ Update: 3/9/09: Well, I used the caramel after freezing it and it was good; just as tasty as when I made it originally. There was about 2 weeks between the time I made and froze it and the time I used it. I used it in the Oatmeal and everything bars, so it was heated; I didn't cut it up and give it away. Very versitile!

This was the first time I ever made caramels and they turned out amazing!! I used an 8X8 square pan because I like the thicker caramels, as suggested by an other reviewer. I don't have a candy thermometer so I just stirred continuously for about 25mins(after it starts bubbling) so they don't turn out too soft. After removing from heat I added the vanilla along with a cup of coarsely chopped walnuts! I let the caramel set in the fridge. Such tasty buttery goodness! I'm so glad I tried this recipe and will make again.. Thanks

I really like the caramel but next time I will cook longer so that it produces harder pieces. Unless they are in the fridge they seem too soft. Plus pre-cut your wax paper to make wrapping faster/easier. I used 2"x1".

Amazing chewy caramels. I only gave 4 stars because the temperature was off (boil to 248-252 for 2 minutes) and they were much thinner than expected. For standard size caramels, use an 8x8 dish.

This is a recipe that is passed down through our family.  I use regular sugar instead of brown sugar.  I've never known what temperature to bring it to when cooking.  Now I know thanks to all the reviews. I've used light and dark brown sugar in this recipe but adding vanilla makes the taste too much vanilla. So I use regular sugar and add the vanilla. Also I started using butter instead of margarine as it makes a more rich, creamy taste.

This is just an awesome Chewy Caramel.  Although, I did bring it to 250 degrees like another reviewer did to wrap them.  And they are WAY WAY WAY to hard....they do soften up in the mouth...just way to hard.  Next time, and there will be a next time very soon (before Christmas) I will bring them to 235 degrees.    **Need to update:  I have made this recipe several times now...I bring them up to 235º and they turn out perfect everytime.**

I love this recipe and have used it many times in candy making. Its perfect for caramel apples or to make scotch kisses (marshmallows covered with caramel). 
I would suggest always using wax paper with it for candy making, and to spray Pam or some other cooking spray on the wax paper to the caramel doesn't stick.

This is a GREAT caramel recipe!  I wasn't sure if my husband would be a fan, but he loved them and so did I.  They didn't last very long!  I will definitely be making them again.

this caramel is absolutely outstanding!!!  So many people have told me it is the best caramel they have ever had.  I cook it to firm ball stage(248degrees), and use it to make turtles or to cover caramel apples or pretzels.  Fantastic!

Not very good! The caramel sticks to your teeth way too much and very hard to get out. Also the flavor is different.

Everyone loves the caramel when I make this (even my caramel-snob husband).  The caramel really melts in your mouth.  I also love to put this over popcorn (I prefer a softer caramel corn than you can find in stores).

These were really good!  Took A LOT of stirring, but the end result was perfect!  The only suggestion I would have is to butter the dish you pour it into REALLY REALLY good.  I buttered it to what I thought would be enough, but it still stuck and was a pain to get out of the pan.

It has a really good taste. I cooked mine to 248* as suggested by others and I could not get mine to set up also the bottom of it burnt. It was to soft to wrap, but like I said it did have a very good taste.

This caramel has really good flavor. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of butter flavor instead of the 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I cooked it until it reached 250 degrees. This is good for making caramel apples, which is what I wanted it for. I  had some left over and just poured it into a pan sprayed with cooking spray. It was still a little too soft for individual caramels. I will try cooking it until it reaches about 260-265 degrees for just caramels. Great recipe!

Fabulous!!! Absolutely the best and easiest recipe.  Creamy, rich, buttery, and perfect chewy texture.  I used the 248* temp, cut the butter to 3/4 C., On medium heat, it only took 20 minutes. I buttered a springform pan, and just dropped the bottom out when cooled.  I did refridgerate for a bit as I was anxious, and was not disapointed.  Thoroughly enjoyed by co-workers!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so good. A rich buttery/nutty flavor. Nothing in the store compares to this lovely homemade caramel. My family couldn't keep their paws off of it! The kids were dipping everything they could find (apples, bananas, marshmellows, walnuts) to dip in it. So Yummy. Thank you!

Sooo good!  This candy just melts in your mouth!  It didn't turn out super chewy like store bought and it was a little too soft, but this also could be my fault because I didn't have a candy thermometer.  Can hardly wait to use this recipe for other creations!

It has a great creamy buttery taste. Mine turned out hard because I cooked it to a higher temp because a lot of reviews said it was to soft. I am at about 5000ft altitude I think that had something to do with it. Will try again.

I loved this one...I add the vanilla and I added in walnuts and then made another batch with peacans! We could not stop eating it. I did put it in the fridge to help it get a little hard but not real hard. My husband and 2 year old son....LOVE IT...will make again

I always cook at 250 degrees, so they hold there shape while remaining chewy. I wrap them in cut 3.75" wax paper squares, and then in 4" tin foil squares. If you don't want to cut, Wilton makes 50 gold, red, or silver candy wrappers available on Amazon for $1.99. They look and taste like professional candy without the high cost. I make this recipe every year at Christmas for friends, co-workers, neighbors and family. I always get tons of compliments.

My mixture started to burn on the bottom even though I couldn't get it up to the recommended temperature. Maybe my candy thermometer isn't working though. 
Still turned out really yummy!

This was a very easy and straight forward recipe for caramel. I didn't change a thing. It makes a very soft chewy caramel. I make two different recipes at the holidays because there are some who like caramels really soft and buttery like these caramels are, and there are others, such as myself, who prefer a caramel that is a little darker and chewier, so I also make caramels from this site from the recipe posted as "Caramels."

This recipe makes very tasty caramel! I love it. The reason for only four stars is that it was way too soft to wrap up. We ended up eating it with spoons - not bad, but a little inconvenient. I am willing to admit that I could be the problem, however I followed the recipe exactly. I’m going to make it again, but I’m going to layer it between shortbread and chocolate for a millionaires shortbread. It should be amazing!!

This is the 1st time I have had a caramel candy work out so well for me. Now I can not stop eating it , Will have to see if I can give some away. I had fun making it though , so all is well.  It was soft , chewy and had a great buttery taste, cooked the right amount of time and right temperature.

I Love this recipe. I have it timed to perfection. Once everything is in the pot, turn the timer to 22 minutes and cook on medium heat, stirring constantly. Perfect chewy caramel every time. Also, for a better caramel flavor rather than a brown sugar taste, purchase caramel flavored condensed milk!

I made these as directed. They turned out to be firm enough to wrap without being so hard as to remove fillings. I sprinkled course salt on top before cutting and wrapping. These are amazing! I will definitely make them again.

Everyone I gave it too loved it. the only reason I gave 4 stars is due to the corn syrup that is used.  if there are any alternatives I would love to try those as well.

This is my new go-to caramel recipe!!  This was super easy and delicious.  If people knew how easy homemade caramels were, they wouldn’t buy the store wrapped versions anymore.  I am extremely pleased with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful!! I split the batch into 2 pans to make one "salted" with some gourmet salts I had received as a b-day gift. Peruvian Pink Salt, awesome!

I likely won’t make this again. I have done this before but it has never turned out very well. I would check the soft ball texture a lot and monitor the temp as close as you can to get it right on the nose but even then it is hard and quite the hassle

Ok people listen, some were disappointed because not firm enough.....it is NOT the recipe.....think about it.....as others have mentioned in their posts, use a higher temperature or cook it a few minutes longer ok :) 
Understand? Don’t abandon this great recipe, its how you cook it. Go back, try it again, experiment. Props to this recipe, good job, yummy. Thank you

This is the best recipe, soft and chewy. I’m a fan of sea salt caramel so I sprinkle on half the pan as it cools.

I have been using this recipe for the past couple of Christmases… And it is absolutely fantastic!  Here is what I learned in my trial and error process, which was lengthy:

-  Adjust for altitude! Water boils at 212° at sea level. As you go up in altitude, water boils at a lower temperature. So do the math  and adjust accordingly. 

-  ALWAYS ALWAYS test your candy thermometer. Boil some water, and check to see if your thermometer registers  212° ( Or whatever temperature water boils at your altitude) If not, do the math and adjust accordingly. 

-  The caramel does not need to be stirred continuously until you add the sweetened condensed milk. At that point, if milk solids settle on the bottom of the pan they will burn and you will have brown flakes in your Carmel.  I also don’t let the mixture get too hot before I add the milk. If it gets too hot it can burn that milk on Contact!
-  Mix it up! You can add instant coffee, Cocoa, or a different flavor from vanilla, like maple or cinnamon. 
Good luck!

With the exception of adding sea salt to the top of the caramels, I made this recipe exactly as it's written.  They were amazing!  I cooked it to 248 on my candy thermometer and turned off the heat.  Stirred it for one minute and poured it in a parchment lined pan.  It cooled for several hours before I touched it.   I then cut it into 1 inch squares and wrapped in wax paper.  I took all the candies to work and everyone loved them.  I plan to make more for Christmas and anytime I want to give a gift, this is it!

These are sooooo good. Definitely line your pan with buttered parchment paper and let sit several hours to cool completely and they will hold their shape. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I covered half the caramel in the pan with chopped pecans and pressed them in.  YUM-O! These are super easy to make and I Love the results. After chilling I made candy bars with this caramel and marshmallow that I learned to make that day too. Dunk this in dark chocolate, chill, and just TRY to resist. Thank you for this recipe.

Need to cook to 248-252, this is right between the hard ball and soft ball stage.  This will give a caramel with a nice chew and will stay together firmly if you want to dip in chocolate.   Add the vanilla at the end after removing from the heat.   Have been making these caramels for the last 5 years or more and have tons of requests from family, friends co-workers.  Key is to cook caramel to 248F.  Need to stir constantly so that the caramel doesn't scald on the bottom.

This is the 3rd or 4th year I've made these caramels. They're always great! This is the first time I have purchased candy wrappers. I'm sure that will speed the process along and be easy to use!

Definitely a keeper. I cooked until the candy thermometer read 250 as others suggested. Topped off with a sprinkling of Maldon Sea Salt Flakes.

Made this for my wedding favor. Everyone loved it and rumored that we bought them from a local chocolatier. We made these as the recipe calls for and in wanting a firmer caramel, we brought the caramel up to 240 and cooked it at 240 for 2 minutes. Turned out beautifully!

This recipe has been in our family for years. We double it, and pour into a jelly roll pan. The secrets are: 1:  FRESH sweetened condensed milk. Don't use the one from your shelf. 2: stir while it's cooking. I plan on standing there for 30-45 minutes while I stir. 3: get an accurate candy thermometer. It has to be cooked with a candy thermometer to come out perfectly. I live at 6400 feet, and I cook mine to 235 degrees.My sister lives at 1200 feet, and cooks hers to 245. It's amazing when done right! My great niece makes dozens of tray of the stuff, and sells the caramels for big bucks at their local craft fair. Folks taste the free samples, and buy $10 worth! You also need to wrap in in taffy paper. The cheapest and easiest to get is the LorAnn oils 100 count twisting paper available on Amazon. I have also had some luck finding it at Hobby Lobby. I make this every year for Christmas gifts, and folks hide it from their family members. Glad to have another way to find the recipe if I ever loose the handwritten one from my sister. Enjoy!

SOOOOO easy and absolutely delicious. Melts in your mouth. I added pecans and they were perfection. I had to stir it longer than 10 minutes, closer to 15-20. Be sure and start stirring as soon as you put it on the heating element and don't stop until it's finished.

These caramels taste wonderful...and by wonderful, I mean like, you won't stop eating them! The only reason why I gave it 4/5 stars is that it was too mushy and sticky so we couldn't wrap them. This caramel is more for caramel apples or caramel filling, or like me, scoop it out with a spoon and eat it! It's soft, buttery, rich, smooth, in a word, YUM!

I make this with cannabis butter (I live in a state where it's legal) and LOVE it.  I also take it to 4 minutes at 240 degrees so they are a little more firm and before it cools I salt the top with Himalayan Pink salt.

So perfect!  Having trouble finding caramel in the stores and the caramel they had was expensive. I feel like I have a hidden power now being able to make caramel for coffee and cheesecake. It was really easy. My drop of caramel in a glass wasn't as good a indicator as I was hoping. The caramel boiled medium for about 10 minutes. First it got frothy bubbles and then when the boil settled into a heavier bubble I sensed it was the right temp. Like a thick cauldron. I hope that helps others who may be doing this for the first time.

I love this recipe! If you like soft Carmel you have to try this. I would cook this to a higher temp next time and to make sure that it comes out of the pan put wax paper on the bottom. It's a great recipie and I will make it again.

I made this recipe twice over the holidays.
The first time, it was used for turtles - absolutely perfect when cooked to 154 degrees.  There was some that did not get used for the turtles, so I just cut it into squares.  They were soft enough that they did not hold their shape, but would have worked very well for wrapped caramels.
The second time, I cooked it to 156 degrees and poured it over pecans in a jelly roll pan.  It was a little bit of work to cut them, but they held their shape beautifully and had a great chew to them.
I will definitely use this recipe again!

Loved this recipe.  I accidentally forgot the corn syrup but it still turned out great (there was some crystallization).  I wanted a soft caramel and it was perfect.  My one mistake was not to remove it from the stainless steel pot fast enough.  It still continued to cook after removing from heat, and put little burned flakes in the candy.  I might use this to cover marshmallows.  I made it very soft, refrigerate to make it not so soft.  Wrapped in parchment paper.  Super rich. Have taken 1 batch made some milk chocolate pecan caramel bites; white chocolate macadamia bites; caramel pieces; and caramallows. Will also use as inner layer for praline fudge.  So versatile!  I used to pay a fortune for a small portion of caramel at Christmas.  No more!

I made these for Christmas gifts and my family loved them! My boyfriend was pouty when I gave them all away, so I'll have to make some more for him. I made one caramel apple just for him and it didn't last even a minute. It was such an easy recipe to work with and I made it without using a candy thermometer and had no problems. Even I love this, and I'm not a fan of caramel. I even placed some in R2-D2 molds and our little boy squeaked when he unwrapped them. He loves them, too.

I needed to make a quick caramel for dipping (centers) and this was fabulous! I forgot to put the vanilla in at the end and it still tasted fabulous.

SOO amazing! I doubled the recipe and split between two cookie sheets. I sprinkled mini dark chocolate chips on one pan, waited till they melt and then spread the chocolate. I then sprinkled sea salt on top of the chocolate.

I have a dairy allergy so I omitted the evaporated milk and whipping cream and replaced it with 2 cups vanilla almond milk. I also used dairy free margarine (Fleischmann's unsalted)  It came out beautifully and no one could tell the difference!

These caramels are wonderful. They aren't hard enough to pull teeth but have a wonderfully chewy texture. 

I replaced half the corn syrup  with Grandma's Molasses and in my second batch, replaced 1/2 tsp of vanilla with 1/2 tsp of anise extract. I hadn't completely replaced the vanilla with anise for fear of overpowering the caramel. The 1/2 tsp replacement added the perfect hint for which I was looking.

Very good recipe. Knowing my candy thermometer is way off, I also used the soft ball in water test. The consistency turned out perfect. I'm a novice at making candy and this was my second attempt. I was fairly pleased except I can't stress enough how important it is to stir constantly. I had all of my ingredients at hand and was adding them to the saucepan that was already warming up on the stove. By the time I added the last ingredient the sugar had already scorched a bit. With all the ingredients already in there I forged ahead and finished the caramels. Luckily the taste was not affected.  The second tip would be to cool them completely before attempting to cut. The last half of the pan was way easier to cut for me as it had a chance to cool completely. I  used parchment paper in an 8 x 8 glass baking dish and pulled the block out with the paper and placed it on the cutting board.  I sprayed my knife with Pam and cut them on the parchment paper. The caramels didn't stick.  They didn't look like what is pictured here, but still not too bad and when wrapped in waxed paper, it doesn't even matter.

Great candy. This was my third batch.  I used a candy thermometer for the first two and while both batches were delicious. They were a little hard.  This batch I used the tried and true softball method with a cup of cold water.   The caramels were chewy and delicious.  Definitely keeping this recipe

Incredible! They are so easy to make and taste great. I layered a pan with cashew halfs and pieces and then poured the carmels over top and let them set up before cutting them.

I get rave reviews from people I've given these to. So soft and creamy but be careful, they're addictive!  Be sure to have the dish you're going to pour the mixture into, ready before you start.

Perfect for filling chocolate candies made in molds! I made a double batch and am going to use one pan it to make caramel corn, too. All I did different was to add like 3 tablespoons of molasses to it. It is super tasty like this. I boiled it until the candy thermometer read 245, and it still is pliable enough to shape into candy molds I have prepped with a layer of melted chocolate first. Then, into the freezer for like 10 minutes before I add more chocolate to complete the candies. Stick them in the freezer again for like 15 minutes and then they pop out easy. Yum! I can see putting the caramel between two pieces of waxes paper and flattening it with a rolling pin to have it just like those caramel apple packs you get at the grocery store, too. It is excellent for making candies; creamy centered candies coated in chocolate I hope my coworkers are going to love. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Love this recipe! I tweaked it a little, because I am familiar with making chewy caramels like these. I sent this recipe to a friend with these notes *is my personal notes. Note to Canadians: our sweetened condensed milk can size is different than in the US, but I used 1 can of Eagle brand when making this. I used golden corn syrup, and I've used l;ight and dark brown sugar.

On taste It was amazing. Almost commercial. The consistency however was a bit off. I am not sure where I went wrong I even bought a candy thermometer just for this but the mixture is so soft I cant even wrap it. its more caramel sauce than candy. Will try again in the future.

I followed the recipe to a tee but found that the condensed milk over powered it so second time around a put in a little less and the flavor was fine. I like that it is a soft caramel i used them as centers in my cupcakes. will make again but firmer next time.

The flavor is perfect! I add sea salt after I spread it onto greased parchment paper. If your want it more chewey simply bring it to 255°, if you want to make a hard candy bring it to 265°. Your candy thermometer should have a chart on it. If you don't have a candy thermometer DONT TRY CANDY MAKING! there is no way to judge your temperature. They are $5 at Walmart.

This is delicious! My first attempt at making caramel,  and it was nice.  I read the reviews,  and cooked it to 250. I'm glad I did , it would have  been too soft otherwise.  It's nice as is,  but my friend was wondering what would happen if it was frozen. ..  I'm now hooked! It gets a nice crunch like a delicious buttery toffee,  but then it turns chewy as you eat it.  It's really just so wonderful.  I tried it with a few pieces , but I loved it so much that I put the rest of the batch in the freezer.  I recommend giving it a shot if you make a batch!

Love this recipes.  It is a family favorite.  I do cook until 240 degrees.  I also line my pan w/ parchment paper and butter that up.  It saves on cleaning and getting out of the pan.  If using for carmel syrup or Carmel apples I usually cook until 232-234 degrees (soft stage).

I used a recipe a lot like this when I was a kid. But lost the recipe. So this is the closest one I can find to it. I picked it cz it has sweeten condensed milk like the one I used as a kid.

I don't have anything to check the temperature. So I had it at med heat for 45 min before getting frustrated and higher-ed it to 7. (Mid is 5). Then it finally started to smooth out and thicken. After 30 min it went to the chewiness I desired.

It is buttery, sweet, rich and caramelly! So delicious! I made it for Christmas to give out! Soon to see what people think. ;)

I've been making these caramels for 5 years now, giving them as gifts for Christmas.  I have tried to make some suggested changes, but have found that you don't mess with perfection.  The 248 degrees was way too hard.  If you make these caramels, do yourself a favor and just make the recipe as stated.  The only thing I do different is line the buttered pan with parchment paper ~ buttered.  This just makes it easier to remove . I've found that using a pizza cutter works great for cutting the long strips.

They were okay, I don't know what I did wrong, but they turned out more like fudge, than caramels. I'm a pretty experienced baker, though I have never made caramel, so I'm pretty sure I did something wrong, but none the less, good flavour. Please help me, I'd love to try these again, but only once I know what to change about what I did.

Could use more salt, the sweetened condensed milk overpowered the caramel flavor, and it didn't set. Otherwise it was yummy! Just used a spoon and scooped it out of the pan, heck with portion sizes!

Turned out perfect! And my candy thermometer was broken so had to guess when to take it off the heat. I like them chewy so loved how they turned out. Just FYI there is 130 calories per piece  if you get 45 pieces out of a batch. Worth every calorie!

This is not a chewy caramel its a creamy and soft caramel candy.
 It tastes wonderful and has a  Very rich taste.  Maybe if you boil it to a higher temp. such as 250 or more it may be chewy. 
I will put it over popcorn and it will be very good.

I have made this recipe 5-6 times.  Must cook to 248 to 250.  I usually double, then brown sugar is a whole 2 lb bag, 1 16 oz bottle of corn syrup, no need to measure.  I also add 2 tsp of vanilla rather than 1 1/2 tsp.  Gets gobbled up at home, work, neighbors, wherever you bring them. Takes about 35 min on med-low heat and a strong arm for stirring.

Very easy and delicious. Used this to make home made turtles. Better than the original ones. I used dark brown sugar for a more molasses taste. These are a huge hit at Christmas or anytime of year.

The first time I made this recipe, I let it cook for the 2 minutes once it reached 234 degrees. This made the caramel harder when cooled but becomes chewy once you put it in your mouth. The next time I removed it as soon as it hit 234 and it was chewy. I shared it at work and everyone loved it! If you cut but don't wrap it, it will all melt back together!

These we're my first attempt at candy making and I was very pleased. I ended up putting the caramel in the freezer before attempting to cut it up into bite sized pieces. I used wax paper for wrapping. Thank you for posting this recipe,absolutely delicious.

This recipe has amazing flavor and was easy to make.  However, it did NOT come out as caramel candies, despite the fact that I took the advice of others and heated it to 250*.   We'll use it for a caramel sauce and call it good, though.

I've been making this recipe for two (2) years and giving it to friends. Everybody loves it and begs to have more so I end up making it almost weekly!  I add more vanilla because it makes the caramels smoother and brings out the buttery flavor better. I'd love to thank the person who came up with the recipe.  It's wonderful!

This is a delicious recipe! I took some other people's advice and I cooked it to 250 degree so it is not too soft. Other than that I followed everything exactly and it was very good. My whole family loved them. The recipe made a lot and I will make them most definitely make these again.

This recipe is awesome! I made two batches and both times it came out great. I found that it has to cool at room temperature overnight to be totally set up. Don't put it in the fridge until you are done putting it in wrappers because it makes it way too hard to cut.

I followed the advice of other posters, and cooked to 248° so the caramels would be easier to cut and wrap.  All I had was dark brown sugar, which makes the caramels really dark, but they still tasted great.  I took half of the batch to a Christmas party, and people were raving about them.  My twelve year old son said "That's a lot of butter!"  All of the butter is what makes them taste so good.

These caramels were a huge success. However, I made two changes: 1) as suggested by other reviewers, I increased the cooking temperature to about 250F. 2) I sprinkled some sea salt on top of the caramel. Very easy recipe and the outcome is simply divine! Soft and chewy caramel! Thanks HARSHMA  for the recipe!

This is the exact same recipe from my Homes and Garden Cookbook I received for a wedding gift in 1976.  I can't believe there are any criticisms for this recipe.  If you want harder carmels cook them to the firm ball stage instead of soft ball. Dah

I have made this recipe for years and have always been happy with the great taste but it definitely needs to cook to hard ball stage.  Best way to check the firmness is to do a cold water test when it gets close to the 248/250 degree stage.  Caution - this must be stirred constantly or it will scorch and burn.  People are always surprised that making caramels takes much longer to cook than most recipes indicate.  Slow and steady makes great results.

Delicious! 

I am lactose intolerant so I used a banana instead of butter, and a customized version of condensed milk (I boil agave nectar and soymilk) and this is amazing! Mine has a hint of banana of course but that doesn't take away from the taste at all, really fantastic recipe! :)

Pretty good tasting caramel.

I don't really know what I'm doing when it comes to caramel, I have had so many disasters in the past.

I used this recipe to cover apples and it worked wonderfully, it didnt drip off the sides. I think it helps if your apples are cool, and you can hold and twirl them patiently as the caramel cools to the apple before setting it down.

This recipe produced twice as much caramel as i needed (covered 9 small/medium apples, AND I had enough to pour a thin layer into a 9x9 inch pan) which brings me to another comment...

I thought it turned out to be a good chewiness for candy, not too soft. I followed the temp. suggestion, maybe a little lower 225-230, but i dont know 1. how long it took me to get there- a while 20 minutes maybe because i was being tentative, 2. how accurate my candy thermometer is, 3. If my altitude 3400 ft affects this process... But I was happy with the result

Awesome recipe! I used Evaporated milk instead and worked fine. Also used low fat margarine. Just boiled a bit longer at a lower temp for a few mins first.

This was the best tasting caramel candy i've ever had~ The only reason that I am not giving it a 5 star rating, is because it wasn't quite hard enough for me. It was a bit soft. And I made sure to stick right to the recipe's temperature marker too, so either my candy thermometer isn't working correctly, (which very well could be...it's just a cheaper Wal Mart brand), or the temperature needs to be adjusted a bit higher. But, that's just for my taste...LOL What a delicious caramel though~ really love it~ :) Thanks!

Made these yesterday. Simple ingredients, lots of stirring and watching to 248. Easy to make!  Here's the big change I made to the recipe, wanted to make this lactose free.  Made condensed soy (out of soy milk) and used margarine.  The caramels were delicious, sprinkled  with kosher salt.  Making for holiday gifts!

Chewy, caramelly deliciousness! I used this caramel for caramel apples (and the leftovers were used to dip a few chocolate sandwich cookies :-D.  I too cooked mine a little bit longer (about 245F? My thermometer is a little off, so I use the cold water test. I cooked the caramel until it formed a firm ball that holds its shape on my finger, but can be squished).

I am giving it a 4 only because I screwed up...so, it could have been a 5 if I were a bit braver! I let it reach 'soft ball' temp as written on my candy thermometer (which is 230 deg. F), and kept on stirring for 2 minutes. But it looked like it was going to boil over at any second. Well if at any moment I looked away, and didn't stir, it would have boiled over. So I figured, it can't possibly get any higher than this and took it off the stove. Instead of being chewy, my caramel came out gooey ;) But, it was okay...it became chocolate filling, and it was still delicious! I am definitely going to try it again...but will be a while since I have sooo much gooey caramel!! And this stuff ain't exactly kind to your hips!

I must have boiled the ingredients too long, even though I followed reviewers advice of "about 20 minutes" (I have no candy thermometer.) I ended up with the texture of sugar daddy suckers-- aka WAY too hard of caramel. I wasn't able to cut through it, so microwaved it with plenty of non-dairy creamer and was able to make a sauce to go in brownies. Scared to try this again, but if I do succeed next time, the rating will go up.

My dad first cooked these, and until he perfected them I didn't like them (not a suprise for someone who doesn't like caramel), but coming straight out of the pan after the batch has been poured, heaven! I have attempted to make these myself only once and disaster, but I will keep trying, to be able to have these and make them whenever I wanted.   Heaven.

Exceptional buttery taste and it melts in your mouth.  Limited to four stars because I like recipes that are hard for me to screw up.  This candy recipe requires pretty precise temperatures to get the consistency and it took several batches to get right.

I made these exactly as written, they taste GREAT, but are very chewy, almost too soft, unless you refrigerate them- this helps harden them some! Great recipe, makes a lot if you wrap them individually!

This is WONDERFUL!  I made 2 pounds and wrapped some and use the rest for pecan and cashew turtles.  There was none left.  It has a praline type taste to it.  I will definitely be making this for years to come.

Wow--easy and yummy!  I did take it to 245.  I used dark brown sugar because that's all I had.  Light might be a bit better.  You'd only be able to eat little bits of this because it it so rich, but it was a HUGE hit in the fam!

Absolutely delicious.  I made this for Christmas 2008 & will be making again this Christmas . . . I made one batch to pass out as gifts, wrapped the caramels in wax paper, 2 days went by and the caramels were gone thanks to my family.  So I had to make another batch.

If the recipe name was Gooey Caramel it would have a 5 star rating from me. But because it was intended to be Chewy and it definately was not, it only gets 4 stars. The caramel was rich in the sugar flavor. I cooked it per directions, minus the vanilla, which was unintentional. This was my first time making Caramel and overall it was pretty easy. Time consuming, but easy. My caramel just never firmed up enough to wrap. Reading other reviews, I think I should have cooked it longer, but  I like to use the recipe as it is written before tweaking in too much. I found it was perfect for the caramel apples I was making it for. They were delicious and were eaten right up. I will use this recipe again for caramel apples.

I have made this twice; once for just to dip. I kept it warm by inverting a small bowl and placing the bowl of caramel on top of it inside my slow cooker set on low. Everyone loved it! This time I made it for caramel apples and it's setting up just fine in the fridge on the apples. Fantastic recipe-Thanks for Sharing it!

We LOVE this recipe!  We used it for caramel apples which came out perfect.  A couple tips: first, a really fast way to get the wax off apples...just run them under very hot tap water for 10 seconds then wipe well with towel, and chill for an hour before coating. The caramel stuck very well.  Next, don't chill coated apples for too long before rolling in toppings...this caramel actually sets up fairly quickly in the fridge.  Also, we rolled the coated apples in finely crushed gingersnap cookies and they were phenomenal!  They didn't stick to cellophane bags at all, and were perfect for Halloween.  Last, my 4 year old son took the need for a "stick" quite literally, so we actually used crabapple twigs (which we washed after sharpening in a pencil sharpener) and it make a very pretty presentation.  These were a huge hit at daycare and also at my office.  We will use this recipe every year.  Thanks so much for posting!!

Excellent!  Our family is addicted to this!  One variation of this recipe is to only let it reach a temp of 230.  It's great for apple dipping...and even over vanilla ice cream!

This recipe was much easier than some other caramel recipes I found, and it tasted great. It was a bit chewy for me. I'll definately cook it to about 250 next time.

Tried this recipe and just didn't like it! It just seemed too runny and didn't set very hard. I should have boiled it at a higher temperature. Great taste but didn't get firm.

My family was a bit mixed about it.  My oldest daughter loved it!  I was kinda on the fence.  It served its purpose.  I actually made it to put into another candy recipe, which worked well.  However, to eat it alone, it just wasn't great.

Awesome!  Yum, Yum!  The key to this recipe is to be patient.  You will be standing over the stove for awhile but it is SO WORTH IT!  Keep testing in cold water for consistency and they'll be perfect!  Now I can toss out my other recipe.  This one is a definate "keeper.  Thank YOU!!

I made this twice, both times it came out kind of gooey. Only way I could really cut it was to freeze it first. I gave it 4 stars anyway for taste and assuming I must have done something wrong for everyone else to have had such great success.

This recipe was ok but not my favourite, I have another recipe with a flavour that I like better.
I cooked it to 235 degrees and it was still way too hard for what I wanted (a soft chewy caramel!)  Next time I will cook it to 230 degrees and hopefully get the consistency that I want.
I did put this batch in the freezer to crush up and use in cookies as I think it will be great for that

AMAZING! I never liked my old caramel recipe and I'm thrilled I found this one. Delicious buttery caramels. I heated to 250 degrees for a chewy, firm texture that everyone loves.

I recommend cutting down on the brown sugar, it was a bit too sweet, not as mellow.  It was a bit too soft for me, but if you use it with apples, the tart of the apple and the caramel are perfect together.  I ran out of butter and I used Crisco spray for the cookie sheet, and I cut the recipe in half so I'm wondering if that's the reason why it came out too soft or if I didn't cook it at a high enough temperature.  Either way, it's still a great recipe, especially if you love caramel like me!  I will definitely make this again

I loved this recipe.  I have never made caramel before and it turned out perfect- it helped to have a candy thermometer. It is a very rich and tasty recipe.  I doubled it and used it primarily to make caramel apples.  Everyone raved about how yummy the caramel was and the toppings stayed on perfect.  I used whatever I had left over to make individual caramels.  It is just delicious!

this caramel isn't the best. it came out kind of grainy, almost like caramel fudge. I've never had caramel come out like that. I've made caramel several times over and this recipe was kind of disappointing. It served it's purpose but I will stick with my old recipe.

VERY GOOD!!! So much better than the recipe my father-in-law uses. It's very buttery and has the perfect amount of saltiness. The only thing I will do differently next time is cook it a tad bit longer so it's a little harder. We needed to refrigerate it so it would be a little harder to cut it and dip in melted chocolate.

250 degrees is too hot. 245 perfect.  Do not let surpass 245! For caramel apples: Use Granny Smith Dip in caramel and turn to coat. Let excess drip back into pan. Scrape caramel off the bottom of the apple with a knife or against the bowl. Place apples on greased baking sheet and stick in refrigerator for 15 minutes or until caramel is set.

Cooked in a little under 15 minutes on low heat.  This was very easy to make and tasted good, but it didn't really taste like the caramel I was expecting for caramel apples.  But if you are not expecting the traditional caramel taste, this is a great treat!

Taste wise this is really nice but a little too soft for wrapping.  I even used a candy thermometer, so I think firm ball stage may be a little better. I ended up using this as a dip but it still tastes great!

Tastes great but I can't get it to firm up! I have a hard time reaching the temp too. Gas stove a problem?

The caramel turned out great. Definately not as hard as I thought making caramel was going to be. The taste is very rich and buttery.
