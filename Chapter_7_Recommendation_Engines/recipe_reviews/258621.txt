i saw this recipe & the only thing I didn't have on hand was the jalapenos but decided to make it anyway. I served the chicken and sauce over egg noodles and it was delicious. Very simple to make. It was a wonderful meal

We loved this!  It was actually easier to execute than I thought it would be. I skipped the string and just wrapped the bacon around tightly and put the seam at the bottom of the dish. I was worried the cheese would leak out but it was wrapped tight enough it didn’t! I also halved the jalapeño and added fresh garlic to the sauce. Next time I will probably season the thighs before filling so they could be eaten without the sauce. Overall this is a winner I will definitely make again.

My family loved this!  I altered VERY little by sprinkling garlic powder and pepper on the thighs and making the béchamel with bacon grease instead of butter.  Oh, and I sweetened the béchamel with a tiny bit of honey.  I think this also would be good by substituting fresh green beans for the asparagus .  This a keeper!!
