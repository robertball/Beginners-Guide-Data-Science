One of the best recipes I have ever made. I followed the sauce exactly. I added extra vegetables. I made it vegetarian by marinating firm tofu instead of pork chops.  I serve the tofu as a Condiment so that it would not disappear in the dish Condiment so that it would not disappear in the dish and would not  affect the texture of the sauce.  My family  asked me to make another batch to take home with them.

Perfect! And if someone wants to completely remove the sriracha,  then why would this be called spicy noodles some people are too much. This was perfect!
