Didn't add the dates or raisins to be 100% sugar-free (tones of sugar in dried fruit), but they turned out wonderful!

I think this is a very good recipe. Followed it exactly.  I think next time I will add some dairy free chocolate chips. Great flavor, soft cookie

Delicious and have a very nice texture!  They get chewy the next day and have a yummy peanut butter flavor.  Super easy to make as well.  Thank you for this vegan recipe with no processed sugar!

Don't know if I made them correctly but very hard to process.  Only had a mini processor, which may be the reason.  Had trouble getting the blade to turn-had to add more almond milk.  Very thick, sticky dough and messy to clean up.  Cookies turned out tasty, but very soft.

I don't normally rate things, but this is awesome. It's really soft, and the dates add the perfect amount of sweetness. Plus it's flavor packed with peanut butter which amazing too. Love it.

These came out chewy (which I love) and were completely satisfying without added sugar. They were not overly sweet (which I also love) and make a super great cookie base. I have made them with almond butter for a milder flavor and added things to them. My little ones love them too!

As far as ‘healthy cookies’ go, these are really very good. The only reason for a less than five star review is the chewiness of the outside of the cookie. I did add some dark chocolate to the dough, which I think was a good addition. We are eating them warm from the oven, so maybe the texture will change a bit as they cool. I will definitely make again!

These are so yummy!  I added 1/4 vegan chocolate chips and 1 t. of mesquite powder for a more smoky caramel taste.  My non vegan, junk food eating teen loved them and couldn't stop eating them.  Will definitely keep this one!  Thank you.

This was really good! The only change I made was I threw rolled oats into the food processor with the peanut butter mixture instead of using oat flour.
 I also tried a second time adding 2 tbsp baking cocoa, and that was pretty yummy, but not as moist.

These are excellent.  Added two chopped up almond & dark chocolate candy bars that were too hard for us to eat whole.  Made almost 80 small 2 bit cookies with excellent flavor.  Daughter is gluten, egg & milk intolerant. The rest of us gluten intolerant.  These are perfect for all of us to enjoy, guilt free.  Thank so much.
