this recipe was really good but a little too "rice-y" for my liking so i replaced it with pizza dough. 
also my hubby isn't a fan of milk (he's lactose intolerant ;)) so i used cheese. also i checked afterwards, and i wasn't neearly inflamed enough, so i added some tomato sauce. 
The kids loved it. throw some veggies on there and its a well ballanced meal.
its a go to for family gatherings (specificly father's day). i love my dad.

I made this one exactly according to the recipe. I was looking for the paletas de arroz that the ice cream man would sell when I was a kid, and these hit the spot. They are so hard to find in the store and I'm thankful to have this recipe!

These were pretty good. Very sweet but good. I think the sugar needs cut back and then some cinnamon would have been a nice touch. Regardless, this was a good recipe and a great idea. Thanks for sharing!

I made this and loved it. I did not add sugar since the condensed milk was sweetened. I also added just a little more milk.

I thought the can of sweetened condensed milk would have enough sugar, so I left out the 1 cup sugar. It was plenty sweet with this change. It was interesting to eat frozen rice. I liked it, but not sure I liked it enough to make again. I love rice pudding both hot and cold, so only time will tell if I get in the mood to make ice pops out of it again. Thanks for the idea and the recipe.
