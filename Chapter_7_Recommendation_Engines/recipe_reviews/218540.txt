light flaky dough. I used the dough to make poppy seed rolls, came out perfect. Thanks for a wonderful light yeast based pastry dough recipe.

Fantastic recipe! A true taste of home! I used raw sugar for the sprinkles on the outside before baking and made my filling with strawberries, sugar and simple syrup.

I dissolved the yeast as per recipe and added the rest of the dough ingredients all at the same time. I used one complete egg, not the egg yolk, regular sugar, and did not use 2 full glasses of flower. I left some flower out, otherwise the dough would be too thick. I let the dough rise only once. The result was perfect! Great recipe! Thank you!
