I'm a fan of this recipe! I debated between 4 or 5 stars and ultimately decided on 4 because I made a handful of changes to it. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I'm not a fan of onion, so I left that out. I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, so I chopped up three roma tomatoes and added a bit more water to make up for the lack of tomato juice. Instead of using frozen corn, I used an ear of fresh corn and sliced off the kernels. I also added a jalapeno to give it a little bit of kick. Overall though, a good recipe! I can't wait to see how it will fare for lunch tomorrow. UPDATE: My boyfriend loves this recipe so much - it is now my go-to chili for him. I  had to bump it up to 5 stars. I used a can of diced tomatoes with habeneros, and it gave it just the right amount of spice.

This was delicious!  I had made extra basmati rice with cilantro and lime and was looking for something to do with it.  I followed the directions.  However, where it called for the rice pack, I added a 2 cups of already cooked rice and a can of black beans. I added some salt and some garlic salt because I wasn't using the seasoning packet from the box.  My entire family loved this, including a 1, 3, and 6 year old:)

I have added flank steak and chicken diced up to the chilli. My kids love it! Also it is great for throwing small amounts of left overs in.

Add an additional cup of corn and a can of black beans, and this makes a great dip for super nachos!

Surprisingly this was very good. I was looking for something quick and easy so thought I would try this recipe. I didn't have any garlic powder so used crushed garlic instead. I also didn't have crushed red pepper so just used regular pepper. I'm only rating it 4 starts because the hubs thought it was just ok.

We LOVE this recipe so much. Instead of beef we used venison and it was amazing! We also made it in the crockpot. :))

Was pretty good, added more rice and we had with whole grain chips. Kids asked for seconds so looks like we'll make again.

I had no clue what to expect from this seeing that I had never had Zatarran's beans/rice.  We were definitely impressed and the whole house smells amazing.  My boyfriend and I debated between 4 and 5 stars and finally decided on 5 because of how cheap, fast, and easy it was yet still delicious.  This dish did not lack any flavor regardless of how easy/fast it was.

My family loved this dish.  Instead of water I used tomato juice and added minced garlic to the beef mixture and a second can of black beans.  We're from Indiana where tomato-based chili is a staple.  This was full of lots of flavor and very yummy.  Thanks for sharing.  ??

I made this exactly as written. It is not bland, but acceptable to most people. Anyone who wants it hotter can always add hot pepper as fresh, dried or sauce. As it can be made mostly from pantry ingredients it is a wonderful standby for emergencies or last minute guests.

This just sounded so good I had to try it.  My husband loved it. He just kept saying "this is really good" and he ate 2 helpings plus finished off the leftovers the next day -- and he doesn't eat leftovers!!  Followed the recipe as is but did add one can Rotel tomatoes & chilies. Easy recipe with lots of flavor. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious and super easy to make. I did modify it slightly. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey. Instead of diced red pepper I used green because that's what I had. I also tossed in a can of Goya black beans undrained, an additional cup of corn and added cumin for additional flavor. I shared with my friends and they can't stop raving about how good this recipe is. I plan on making this again very soon!

I made it tonight and loved it! I used smoked sausage instead of hamburger meat, used a can of corn. I didn't put any extra spices in it didn't want it too spicy for my kids. Great flavor without it. Will definitely make this again.

Awesome!  The boyz loved it. Left the meat out for a vegetarian dish,  and added taco spice,(didn't have crushed peppers), tamed jalapenos, orange pepper(didn't have red one), used minced garlic instead of powdered, and used  Lundberg Wild Blend Rice and organic black beans from Costco.  Soooo good. Would make again.

Although not my idea of traditional chili, this is an excellent recipe. We shared it with our neighbors, who asked for more, so we plan to make it again and share it again.

This was a delicious recipe. I had lots of ground beef I needed to get rid of, and this was the perfect meal. I made some changes. Instead of using the Zatarrain's mix, I used long and wild rice, can of black beans and some taco seasoning. Everyone loved it.

Excellent filling for burritos!  Made it without ground beef, added about 1/2 tsp more garlic powder and an added cup of canned black beans (drained and rinsed).  Used chopped fresh roma tomatoes (without seeds).  Cooked it down to a drier state.  Prepared shredded chicken with added fajita seasoning and built burritos with beans & rice chili and chicken.  Yum!  Very tasty.

I found this moderately addictive - it's a GREAT comfort food and I agree, it could have been a little bland for my palate but I realized it would be when adding the ingredients so I put a little more (twice as much actually) of the crushed red pepper and a little more chili powder and garlic powder. As a bonus to myself, I mistakenly bought ground turkey vs. beef and didn't realize it until I was 1/2 through prepping and sautéing so I just rolled with it and I will choose the turkey over beef again next time I make it.  I liked it fine without any toppings, b/c it's sort of rich, so adding toppings almost made it over kill but my 12 year old liked the sour cream as it took a little of the sting away from the crushed red peppers.
