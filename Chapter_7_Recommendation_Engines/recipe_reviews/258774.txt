Family loved it!  Didn't miss the beef at all.  Very flavorful and less heavy/fatty than beef.  Will definitely make this again.

The only changes I made were adding minced garlic along with the garlic powder, and I added a lot more cilantro. This was very good. I was honestly surprised. I’m watching my cholesterol so this recipe is a keeper. I don’t even think my boyfriend knew it was turkey instead of beef.

These were a great alternative to beef tacos for those watching their cholesterol. I really liked the addition of the green sauce. I think the recipe needed more cilantro but that is the only change I will make next time.
