I think this is a fantastic Apple pie! I have never used a store bought pie crust but I realise you were only experimenting, and yes you can use any ole apple to make an apple pie, I have tried them all and they all work just fine! I will make this pie again for sure.

Just tried this for the first time; really great recipe, and so easy!  I added 2 tablespoons of flour, a dash of nutmeg, and a tablespoon of lemon juice based on the ingredients I saw for another apple pie.  That thickened up the juice and gave it a great taste.  And I know it was probably inferred (and of course I completely forgot), but next time I'll skin the apple, lol.

Excellent tasting and easy to make. The first one I made seemed to have too much syrup in it even after cooling. It was not big deal... I just drained the excess and it was fine. This time I didn't use all of the caramelized syrup.

Not sure what went wrong. Maybe it's because I used regular salted butter since that's all I had on hand. But there was no "gooey caramel", just sauce the consistency of broth. Possibly boiling longer would help. Even after 15 extra minutes of cooking, the bottom crust was not done. Too many apples that didn't hold any semblance to pie. It looked great before cutting, and once I made some penuche and poured over the top, it served up like an apple crisp.

If you follow the recipe without adding anything, this is hands down a 5 star recipe.  I don't like nutmeg or apple pie spice - I'm strictly all about brown sugar and cinnamon when it comes to baking with apples.  I know, I'm probably not normal but I like keeping things simple.  BTW - this is no means a simple tasting pie!  It's delish, no need to add lemon or orange essence (really, who does that to apple pie?) nutmeg or flour. And how simple was it to make by making a syrup and pouring on the pie?  Can't get easier than that.  The only thing that was hard was peeling the apples and slicing them. Even the hubs liked it considering he's not a an apple pie lover.  Don't change a thing, kudos to Chef John!

Excellent recipe. I added lemon and orange essence, due to lack of lemons. I recommend the recipe.

I made this recipe today. Used regular butter, splenda instead of sugar, added a lil fresh lemon juice, and also buttered the bottom crust and baked it for about 10 minutes to make sure it was done before adding the rest. my butter mixture wasn't thick it was syrupy but the pie still came out tremendous. .. Great easy quick recipe, will make again

Made this last night.  A little disappointed -- wish the kind of apples to use was specified:(. Used Granny Smith -- very tart / hard / and yielded no juice making the pie very dry and tart tasting.  Will try again with different apples that yield more juice. Also I would mix the syrup in with the apples before placing in crust.  Didn't seem like the apples were evenly covered with syrup:(

Tried this recipe today; delicious. Used a tad less sugar since I don't like things overly sweet. Came out perfectly.

I made it exactly as listed, and just boiled the sauce until I saw a light sugar crust on it, and then turn off the stove  and mixed it all until it re-dissolved into the sauce. I let it cool & thicken a bit before pour it onto/into the pie. Easiest apple pie sauce base that I think I could have made that would taste so good. Will be making this again.

This was a big hit this Thanksgiving! Lots of compliments and the pie disappeared. Perfectly spiced and interesting, despite the ease of making it. 

Only alternations I made were that I made my own pie crust from scratch, I cooked for an extra 15 mins to try and evaporate out extra liquids (which didn't help too much). I also added a little sprinkling of nutmeg.

As to the extra liquid, I thought it was perfect because I baked the day before serving. So in reheating the second day, I didn't find that cutting and serving was extra gooey or anything. It didn't cut perfectly clean, but that was more a factor of large chunks of apple and a delicate lattice than anything else.

Will definitely make again.

This was really good.  We'd been to an apple orchard in Iowa and had an abundance of Jonathan apples.  They were not large, so just measured 6 cups of peeled and sliced.  Did not make a lattice for top, but used a lot of cut outs instead.  So yummy - of course, it is from Chef John!

It is probably best to use Granny Smith's on this recipe because it can be a little too sweet. We found our "caramel" sauce to be too runny. So I will adjust our recipe. Otherwise Excellent!!  I love Chef John

The only thing I did different was to put the apples in the sauce to precook them a little, I like mine soft. Then just poured it all in the pie together. It is absolutely delicious! It has become "my " recipe. Thanks Chef John.

I made this pie for a coworkers birthday.  His response, "the best pie I have ever had!"  Now everyone I work with wants one. I was skeptical, for sure.  Not peeling the apples and pouring a sauce over the crust freaked me out.  However, the apples were tender and the crust flaky, bubbly and evenly browned.   Caveat:  I did use homemade crust but would not be opposed to trying the pre-made in a crunch.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Chef.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The syrup turned out perfect and the pie looked delicious, the only problem was that it wasn't. It was very bland and dry. I used gala apples, so I am not sure that if a sweeter juicier apple would make this recipe more appealing. But most likely will not make again.

I used early fugi, golden delicious and granny smith apples.  

Outstanding!  The was the first pie I've ever made and I'm almost 50.  I bake everything else, but never baked a pie.  

This will make you want to slap yo' mama!

While this is a good recipe, Grandma Ople's apple pie, in All Recipes, takes top honors. Please make your own pie crust. It is so easy, and it makes the pie so much better.

I followed the direction exactly although I did use Granny Smith apples (personal preference). And I tossed the apples with 2 Tbsp. flour like Chef John suggested for a thicker filling. SO EASY & EVERYONE LOVED IT! It did take  40 minutes longer at 350 degrees F than the recipe but I am always having issues with my oven so totally not the recipes fault. My husband was so excited when he came home from work &  I had made him an apple pie for no reason other than to make him happy. I was happy because it was just so darn easy.

I made it exactly to the recipe. First time! I had a problem with my crust. I had a 9 oz box instead of 15 oz and didn't have enough for the top layer. :( Otherwise, it tasted delicious and was a hit on Thanksgiving. Will make it again and get it right. Oh, 4 apples was too many. I could only fit about 3 in the pie. Delicious!

love it- one change: once i finished the caramel sauce, i took a little bit out (maybe 1.5 TBSP?) and tossed the apples in the larger portion of the sauce. I put the apples in the pie and covered as instructed, pouring remaining sauce on top. Excellent flavor throughout the pie, would totally do it again

Made exactly as recipe is written with the exception of using 5 peeled Gala apples instead of 4.  Turned out excellent, and I will definitely make it again.

I followed the ingredients exactly as instructed but instead of one large pie, I made 2 small pies. It was the best apple pie I've ever made or eaten.

We loved this pie. Took John's suggestion and added 2 tbs flour to the apples. Came out perfect. Did not care for the apple texture because  I left the skin on. Will remove next time.

Ok I thought well this is a very simple receipe and it does look good to eat. I made it and it looks just like the photo here and it was so easy to make. Just the right amount of sweetness to you and the crust is perfect. Great pie for the Fall or anytime of the year. Enjoy.

Will definitely make this again. Comments ranged from 'Mmmmm' to 'The apple is as close to perfection as you're going to get'! 
The recipe has just the right mix of flavours all balanced very nicely. 
Changes : 
I used less cinnamon and added about 3/4 teaspoon of nutmeg
Used brown sugar only

Chef John does it again. We peeled & cored 5 Red delicious apples BUT had way too may apples to put into one pie shell. We ended up putting it in a 9 x 12 dish. Doubled the sauce. Put the lattice crust on the top. Not too sweet. Crust was nice  and crisp with the carmelized sauce.. YUM.

This a great recipe!  Everyone in the family loved it.  I have made the "Grandma Ople's " recipe which includes flour as a thickener and that is wonderful too!  Will make this one again.

This pie was really yummy! I made two at the same time, a slightly smaller one in an aluminum (throw away) pie pan, and the other in a larger glass pie Pyrex. The larger pie turned out a little better, the smaller pie had runny sauce in the bottom (too much) that never thickened up, but the bigger pie turned out just perfect. It was very good! Although, I tried to eat it with ice cream and the pie was very sweet so it wasn't good with ice cream (the combination was way too sweet) but the pie was very yummy by itself.

I especially loved the idea of the egg wash & the oven at 425 for 15 minuets and 350 for the last. Beautiful!!

The pie was overall very good, if you like to eat pie in bowls. The sauce was very unfortunately runny thought surprisingly the pie crust didn't turn soggy. Next time, I'll probably add some flour and mix the apples with the sauce beforehand. But, it's apple pie. And apple pie is delicious anyway it's cooked

Perfect and easy.  I only subbed golden delicious apples and made a little extra sauce for dripping over the ice cream we served along with it.  Mine took 50 minutes after lowering the temperature-probably b/c of the cookie sheet I put underneath to catch the drippy overflow.

This is a great recipe! Its so easy and so delicious! I made it for my thanksgiving dinner and people loved it. We had a ready crust but used the already made dough for the cross-top. Just caramelize the sugar, pour it on top, stick in in the oven then vwah-la. Tasty applepie

Great recipe. I just forgot to add the water to the caramel sauce and it came out way better than my first attempt. Not as  soupy. Didn’t do the lattice Added a small amount of nutmeg and it was great. Thanks!

So i never bother to rate things but i just HAD to do it for this pie. It was SOOOO easy even for me (I'm not the best cook or baker). I used about 5-6 small Pink Lady apples (my favorite because they're kind of tart and firm) and i used my food processor to slice. It honestly couldn't have been easier and it tasted so fresh and not gooey like the store bought ones. Next time i will try the same recipe but with a homemade crust.

It tasted fabulous! I loved it! I used a recipe pie crust instead of store bought, it was easily broken so it was more like a crumble. It also had a lot of liquid in it probably because our apples are extremely juicy. Next time I will either add less water, less apples or add cornstarch. Ten out of ten will make again!

Easy as pie lol (pun intended) only thing hard about it was peeling the apples and the wait for it to cook. No changes followed receipe to the letter. Happy eating y'all!

Took the advise of several people and used a little flour to thicken the juices.  This is my all time favorite apple pie and the easiest one I've ever made.  Love this recipe!

Made this tonight for my guys at the firehouse. Used a crumb topping in place of lattice. OMG AMAZING. We all loved it. Thank you Chef John for yet another top notch recipe.

It was good. my husband must have his apple pie in a rectangle dish (he likes corners), so I made it in 11x7 pan. I used 5 small McIntosh, 5 small granny smith, and 1 honeycrisp. I used the same liquid as others said it was a bit too much liquid, and it turned out fine. I mixed the liquid caramel ingrediants in a pan with 2 tbsp. cornstarch, then I mixed in the apples as opposed to pouring over the top to make sure they were all covered. I then egg washed the top pie crust. BTW, I needed 3 Pillsbury pie crusts to pull off the rectangle pan.  It was good, but I feel it was missing something, might try a diff recipe next time.

The only changes  I made were the sugars:  organic cane sugar and Splenda Brown Sugar  Blend.  This pie was delicious- one of the best I've tasted.  It's my official go-to Apple pie recipe.

I did add a bit on cinnamon.  Taste = 5 but.... the top burnt a tich in fifteen minutes so I had to cover it with foil.  Unfortunately the bottom didn't brown. I did have a cookie sheet underneath because it always drips.  I saw that there was a problem so I took out the pan.  I guess it was too late (even though it baked another half hour) because it didn't brown and the syrup dripped on the oven floor  :(    Any ideas how to fix this?   I decided to serve it with foil covering the bottom of the glass pie plate so it wouldn't show the pale bottom.  Taste was great though!

Excellent pie, the whole family loves it. It has a clean non -preservative not too sweet or syrupy taste. I have made it at least 10 times and sometimes it does come out a little soupy. I think it has to do with the type of apples used. I use a combination of gala and granny smith. Still the easiest, best-tasting pie recipe I've ever used.

I did not change anything, sad I didn't do lattice top, just made large cuts in top.  I will be sure to do lattice next time.  It was the best apple pie I have ever had and really easy.

I first cooked the apples in a pan with butter just to soften a little. Then I added the sugar and cinnamon. I also added 3 tablespoons of flour, though I like to use cornstarch when available. It works much better to thicken that juice. That's the good stuff. You definitely dont want to just pour it out. Cook the apples with sugar and flour mixture for just a minute until combined. Then I followed the rest and baked. I loved the apple taste coming thru without too much spice. Delicious!

This was very good and was also my first attempt at making a fruit pie! There seemed to be a lot of extra liquid but perhaps there is a pie secret I don't know about pertaining to that? Regardless, it was delicious. Will make again!

I made it with a mix of Fuji, Honey Crisp and Granny Smith apples. For the syrup, I omitted the white sugar, and I used store bought pie dough (Aldi).  It was delicious!

Looked fancy but  runny juice (not syrup) and soggy. The juice did not thicken up. Next time I will add flour or cornstarch to the syrup to thicken prior to baking. The taste of the apples and syrup was good. The crust was a soggy mess. Everyone ate the inside of the pie and threw away the crust. Very disappointed.

Overall, this was a very tasty pie when I made it! The flavors complimented each other very well, and it was exceptional at the least to say. One thing that I myself made a mistake was using oil-based butter that contained salt, so I just skipped out on the pinch of salt it called for in the recipe, since my oil-based butter had some. This made the syrup have a very light consistency, but it still tasted fine. I also did not put enough apples in it, which did not affect anything other than the overall mass of the pie, but it still could have used one more apple. (I put 2 &1/2 large apples) But in the end it was amazing!

This turned out great. I took John’s suggestion and added a few tablespoons of flour to thicken it up a bit. I also added some cinnamon to the sliced apples before I put them in the pie dish. The recipe turned out great and it was relatively easy.

I've made this one several times.  If you watch the video, he does not peel the apples and uses 4 large Gala apples.  For those with issues of the pie being too runny from the sauce, you might be using juicier or more apples than he is using, and should adjust accordingly.

Tastes fine but the sauce did not set at all.  The pie is full of liquid and impossible to cut and serve..it has to be scooped into a bowl.

John you did it again another Fabulouso recipe and congratulations on your on line recipes award. 
I made this pie, I had our friends over for dinner it was a hit, and also knocking on my friends doors given a piece.

The pie was delicious the only thing I did different was and a little more brown sugar. Keep on posting delicious recipes on site, I made several of you recipe dishes. I love your sense of humor when you cook, I laugh all the time. Thank you again John.

The flavor is amazing! Crust was flaky and delicious. It needs some flour or cornstarch to thicken it up though. Next time I’ll coat the apples with cornstarch and a little nutmeg and see how it turns out.

This is very easy to follow, and a good recipe for a novice pie maker like myself. I recommend watching the video before getting started.  Chef John’s tips in the video helped my pie turn out the way it did. I followed his recommendation at the end of the video to add a few tablespoons of flour to the apples for a less runny filling and I also peeled the apples based on another commenter’s suggestion!

Not overly sweet which is good when you serve it ala mode. I used salted margarine so I didn't add salt.  Added 3 Tablespoons of flour as the last apple pie I made was runny.  It came out perfect. Easy and very tasty.

Made as describe. I've been cooking for a lot of years, but I've never made a apple pie. Followed the recipe, with one exception, I added 2TB flour to the sauce. This was based on other reviews, however it was NOT needed. Took an extra 10minutes to bake. This was better than any store brought recipe. It was excellent! And so easy.

The flavor is awesome. My mistake was in not cooking the sweet stuff more and letting it thicken. By not doing that, the liquid was too runny and must have boiled the apples until they were mushy. So I’m going to do it right next time - because it is quite delicious!

PLEASE PLEASE spray the pie dish!! Chef John does not say this in his video! I made it and I should have known to spray the dish and it stuck to the dish!! The slices did not look good BUT the favor was WONDERFUL! The method was different but it worked; the top of the pie was flavorful and brown just like you buying from a country bake shop!! I will make again and I will spray the dish.

The crust was the best part.  But if you want a good apple pie, make the entire filling in the same bowl and then use an egg wash to get that crisp, golden crust.  I've done other apple pies from this site.  This one is the worst I've tried.  Go with Grandma Ople's if you're looking for a definitely good recipe.  I won't make this one again.  (Someone commented this is the same as Grandma Ople's and it is not the same at all).

The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because of the water. The water was too much when I made it. Therefore my syrup was cinnamon water basically. Add very very little water as you go along.

I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I find that recipes online have way to much sugar anyway. 

I also increased the cinnamon. Personal preference though. I love to really taste the cinnamon.

Overall it is a good recipe. The water was the only disappointment.

Made this recipe over the weekend, used some fresh Granny Smith apples, I found it balanced out the sweetness.   My only problem is the bottom of the pie stuck to the bottom of my pie plan, so ended up being a bit more mush, but SO worth it.

Great easy recipe, have made it several times.  I coat the apple slices in flour which keeps the filling much more firm, not soupy (every two apples I cut up, I put in a gallon zip lock bag, add 1/4 cup flour and shake like shake and bake).  Sometimes I cut the apples in cubes instead of slices, either way works, I think the cubes cook a little more evenly.  Good cooking!!

Delicious! I only had salted butter so added a bit of sugar to the top. Also I used 5 apples and dusted with flour. Only had one crust so made my own dough for the lattice. Still very easy and delicious! I love chef John! His pecan pie made me famous among family and friends...and as expected this one was just as delicious!

It would have probably been good if I had paid closer attention to the directions. It came out mussy, the crust, because I should have cooked it before filling it.

I make mine with apples and pears.  Use a fully ripened pear.

Before placing in oven I put a couple pats of butter on top.

I made this the first time on Thanksgiving for my 'new man' and his mother who "made the best apple pie ever" so I will admit I made it with competition in mind. I had to make two because the top burned at the higher heat suggestion the first time. I couldn't submit that for eating; so I made it again and covered the pie with foil to protect it. This was magic and it was browned perfectly this time. I served both of them my pie and it was delicious! A mom's pie  was matched; then we swapped how we made it. She used the exact recipe!  Made my man happy and she was complimentary that I know a 'good pie recipe when I see it". Win - Win!

I did add a little flour to the apples as he recommend if we wanted traditional. I used one premade crust  (because it was what I had) and I made the other crust.... I was dissapointed with the crust I chose, I need to find one that holds together when doing the lattice design. I really love the caramel. Absolutely perfect! Thanks Chef John :)

Loved this with one change: I doubled the syrup recipe and brought it to a boil then removed from heat.

This was enough to fully cover apples and it made it plenty thick.

This tasted like a traditional apple pie.  I used Fuji apples.

This is a delicious pie, very easy to make.  In the picture and video the apples are not peeled.  I peeled mine.  Also in the video I saw the caramel sauce at a really rolling boil.  So I did mine like that.  It was too much.  The caramel crystallized before I had it on the pie.  Next time I will bring just to a boil and then remove it from the heat.  I am hoping it will be a thinner syrup and will pour nicely over the pie

This is a very tasty recipe.

I made this recipe using Honey Crisp and Macintosh apples. I boiled the sauce to get a thick syrup and followed the recipe by using lattice topping and pouring all over the pie. I baked at 425 for 12 min and then 325 for 15 more minutes and my crust is golden with a caramel sheen. Will make again :)

Awesome! I am not in favor of  so much sugar, so, we got ripe apples and reduced the white sugar to only a quarter cup, and added one more apple. The recipe is awesome! I made this four times, it always came out great. And when it's cold, it's just as delicious. I used another recipe here of the dough. Really simple, just using flour, salt and butter - the two together make for a very tasty treat. Posted some pics.

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions:
Substituted Splenda for the white sugar
Substituted Truvia/Brown Sugar blend for brown sugar
Reduced water by 50% based on others' comments about excessive liquid
Cored the apples then sliced on mandolin set for about 1/8" then stacked them and cut down through the middle! QUICK to make thin apple slices !
This came out wonderful, so satisfying and with a reduced Glycemic Index to boot!
Best apple pie ever! Pretty looking too !!

After reading several reviews, I opted to add 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour to the sauce, but it still wasn't very thick.  The 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon didn't add enough flavor, and I did add a dash of nutmeg.  Easy, yes, but I apparently missed something.

First time making an apple pie.  Followed the recipe exactly  with the exception of adding 3T of corn starch to cut down on the excess  surypiness that was mentioned in several posts.  Tasted great.  Looked great too.

I added lemon juice to the apples so they wouldn't brown. I loved this recipe! It is super easy and the top of the crust is to die for. The only thing that I didn't care for was how soupy the inside was. Otherwise, it was great and a hit for my household.

I bought the ingredients as listed.  My 12 year old daughter did this pie from start to finish with no help.  It was absolutely delicious!  She enjoyed making this recipe with Chef John's video.  We will definitely make it again but will try adding the 3T of flour he suggested if you desire a thicker apple pie filling.  It was still wonderful.  We will make sure we have vanilla ice cream next time we make this pie.

Very good pie. I used homemade pie crust and it was delicious. Second time I made it, I didn't mix the sauce enough, and the sugar got burnt. I still poured it on my pie and baked it. It was gross, but it was my error, so I don't blame the recipe for it.

I used a frozen gluten-free crust.
It was impossible to add a lattice crust; the second crust broke in several irregular pieces. I realize now I should have just kneaded the top crust and rolled it out again, cut it into strips to form the lattice.

Pie looked beautiful but.... was VERY watery. Flavor was wonderful but it was just too watery.  I guess I should have followed the advise of others and added flour or cornstarch to the apples.

I watch Chef John's video but never found the recipe so I improvised - I used the recipe above with slight modifications: I used gala apples (8 small), only 3-4 tablespoons of butter, I used 3 pinches of cornstarch not flour.  I never used a saucepan, simply melted butter, blended in the sugars, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon and corn starch then poured the mixture over the apples and coated well.  Much simpler.  And I didn't do the lattice pie crust - do the one in the video...Watch Chef John's video and you will see - BUT he never mentions the amounts on his ingredients.  My improvisation worked VERY VERY WELL!  This was my 1ST ever apple pie and the 1ST American Apple Pie that my French husband had ever eaten - he loved it!  Good Luck!

I like that it was not overly sweet as some apple pies are.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.

I personally didn't like it. It was very runny, and not a whole lot of flavor. I followed the recipe to a T. The crust was yummy but that's about it. Not making it again.

This was really easy to make. I used a mandolin actually to cut the apples so it would be much easier and I didnt have to cut the cores out. Also instead of brown sugar since there was none on hand I used all white. Came out exactly like the photo just follow the recipe exactly as said and you'll have a great pie.

This is definitely my go-to apple pie recipe! A hit Every.Single.Time! I've added a few spices to make it my own, and sometimes let the apples soak in cinnamon and a bit of lemon juice before putting it in the pie crust.

The results were watery.  It needed some flour or other thickening agent in order to compensate for the moisture in the apples.

I really enjoyed this recipe. However I did adjust it a bit. I used my own pie crust recipe. Also the apples I seasoned with a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and apple spice seasoning. Just a pinch or two of each seasoning to toss the apples in. It is phenomenal!

I like this recipe, but it was not my personal best. I had "helpers" baking the pie with me. I found it to be too flat, but that may also be because my 12 year old insisting on helping, minced the apples!! I also used a Pillsbury pie crust (which I will never use again). Next time I will be making my crust from scratch.

I made it with two cans of apple pie filling, and it was still the best pie I ever made!  Nothing but rave reviews from guests.

The sauce ended up kind of watery. Maybe next time I will leave out the 1/4 cup of water? I also added a touch more cinnamon. I will use more apples next time too.

I wasn't sure what I'd think about making an apple pie this differently, but I LOVE IT! I've been trying new Apple pie recipes and this is one of my favorites! The family loves it as well.

Phenomenal taste!! I am fairly certain I could eat the whole pie myself if my family would just get out of the way! I would give it five stars but for the fact that it fell apart as we were taking it out of the pan. But the taste was so yummy that no one cared!

It is very easy and very good,  first one was quite runny, just drained the excess juice and the pie was fine.  My husband asked me to make another one right away, this time I tried boiling the sauce longer to see if that would thicken it up some, haven't cut this one yet so don't know if that worked.

This pie is absolutely amazing! Followed the exact directions, it was  Super easy, and I actually didn't have a problem with the caramel sauce being too runny. The shell is crisp also.

I made this pie a few years ago and traveled it 400 miles for Christmas dinner with my family. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it! I have made it 7 or 8 times since then. It is great at holiday time but I make it occasionally just for my husband as he fell in love with this pie! I did not change a thing  with the recipe other than using different kinds of apples.  Thanks Chef John!!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used store bought pie crusts with this recipe and my own pie pan.  This is a new favorite. I would not change a thing about the recipe but just added some lemon juice on the apples. YUM!

This is absolutely a keeper!  After reading the other reviews I did use about 2 T of flour with the apples to cut down on the potential for the sauce to be too runny.   I also didn't use quite all of the caramel sauce and it turned out perfect!

The taste was excellent. I need to work on the presentation, had trouble with the weaving and criss crossing. Also, my sauce did not thicken. May try flour next time but will definately make it again. It was a hit at our cookout.

This apple pie is amazing! I made it for Christmas and it was the highlight of dinner! Everything is amazing, including the caramel sauce. The only thing I have to say is that I didn't need four apples, I only used three and it fit perfectly! Love this!

this was by far the BEST apple pie recipe ever! I am a complete novice, and this was easy and tasty. Gotta work on the presentation, but I assume that takes time. I did add two tbsp of flour to thicken up the sauce. This will be a weekly favorite.

Great!  I just added the apples to the caramel sauce and then wove the pie crust over the top.  Caramel sauce doesn't taste very sweet but after cooked, it tastes delicious!  Great recipe!  Homeade crust tastes the best with this recipe.

Great recipe.  The first time I baked this pie the juices were a bit runny for me so the next time I did it I added about 1 TB of flour to the apple mixture and it thickened nicely.
