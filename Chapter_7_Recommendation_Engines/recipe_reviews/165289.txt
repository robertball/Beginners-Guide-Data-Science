Disclaimer: I made the lamb only, not the spinach or potatoes so my review is focused on only the lamb. Very interesting combination of flavors. I never would have thought of cumin and a red wine reduction going together but in this circumstance it really works. The lamb was quite flavorful and my daughter (the other lamb lover in the family) enjoyed this dish as much, if not more,  than I. I did feel the need to add a little kosher salt to the wine sauce because I felt it was just a touch too sweet. Otherwise, no modifications. Thanks for submitting a unique and flavorful recipe.

I have to say this was absolutely wonderful, I just made a few amendments, but nothing major. I cut the meat from the bone. As fresh English spinach is so difficult to find in Australian supermarkets, I used frozen spinach. Indeed this dish would be ideally suited for a dinner party, as well a family meal.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband was practically licking the plate (for his sake I'll say "practically"). It's simple and quick, and I'm planning on making it for company, as the presentation is beautiful.  I added a little arugula and baby red leaf mixture at the end of cooking the spinach to make it even more colorful.  I'd recommend making about twice of the delicious sauce, as we loved it so much we would have liked even more of it!

OK, if I could give this more stars I would! First of all its freakin' fantastic! Second of all, its pretty easy to make, but tastes like it came from a restaurant...so its pretty impressive. I loved everything about it, the sauce was great, everything. The only changes I made were that I did not have cumin seeds so I just rubbed some cumin powder on the lamb steaks. Also, I added a little cream to the potatoes. Yum yum. I know I'll be making this again!

I give this a three as is, but a four or five now that I've made some changes. The wine reduction is great, just needs some salt.  I prefer mashed potatoes made without sour cream, just butter and milk. I use salt, ground rosemary, garlic powder, pepper, and dried thyme as a rub for lamb and think it tastes a lot better than the cumin.

This method of making lamb went over really well at my house; the wine sauce was even palatable to the kids. Yay! I've been hesitant to buy lamb in the past, but there's some nice grass-fed at Trader Joe's lately, and this recipe really compliments it.   I omitted potatoes, and used ground cumin as others have done. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.   Thanks!

It was okay, but just not great. I had really high hopes after reading the reviews, but I was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I didn't do the potatoes, but I did follow the recipe for the Lamb Steaks and they were delicious!!! Everything was amazing. I didn't have cumin seeds so I used salt and pepper and cumin seasoning for the rub. Then followed the red wine reduction sauce perfectly and it was just delicious. I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who loves lamb.

My husband just raved over this meal! I made it just as written except for the spinach and the sour cream in the potatoes. I used cream cheese instead. I didn't use as much spinach as stated. I will definitely make this dish again. YUM!

Very yummy meal! I did it without the spinach. Any green vegetable will mix well. Wouldn't change a thing.

Absolutely Delicious!  I made this lamb recipe for Easter and was bragging about it in church today! He has risen! 

Normally, I am conservative with cumin, but it really went well with the lamb!  Cumin seeds have a different flavor than cumin powder.  Don’t be afraid to use them.  The red wine sauce was also delicious on both the meat and the potatoes.  I didn’t strain the sauce because garlic is so healthy for the skin!

So good and easy! The whole meal took less than 20 minutes. I made a couple changes:  I used a light dusting of ground cumin, since it was what I had on hand.  I was a little skeptical about cumin and red wine together, but it was delicious.  Also, I left out the potatoes as we are trying to lose weight.  It would have taken a bit longer with the potatoes, but I'm sure it would have been even better.  This was also a great way to get lots of healthy spinach into our diet. Will definitely make this again!

Great!  We're lamb people and thought the combination of cumin and red wine was wonderful.  I used a cab sav and did not add any vinegar and still thought it was wonderful - not too sweet.  I liked the spinach, but you could use any green vegetable, according to your preference.  I think next time, I'll make it with chops vs. shoulder steaks.  Shoulder steaks are just a pain to work with.  The cooking time might need to be adjusted accordingly.  Yummy!

Well we are lamb lovers, and this did not disappoint us. I will make this again, will probably try pork next time. As a previous reviewer said, the sauce was a little sweet, I added a splash of red wine vinegar to tone it down, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

Worked out great. I probably could have used less wine in the sauce because I did not have as much spinach.  Could not find bundles of spinach so had to use bags of baby spinach.  Did not yield as much.

I made it and it was perfect.  Lamb is always touchy because it's not meaty, but as for the rest, perfect combination.  Hell, we had left overs and my dog, who typically doesn't do spices, gulped it down!  I would serve this dish for a full group of family and friends any day!  Delicious doesn't do it justice.

Very good...shoulder is a problem though so next time I'll cube it and saute it that way.
Spinach on the bottom, potatoes with a well for the lamb and the sauce.
Very nice sauce. 
I think rosemary would be a good substitute for cumin, but the cumin was good.

Delightful recipe as written - and worthy of 4.5 stars; I wanted stronger flavors & tweaked it after the first time. Specifically, I used Penzey's Mignonette pepper with its coriander to enhance the cumin and their shallot salt to add some subtle depth. Used *a lot* of cumin seed. Had never had it fried / toasted before. NICE - thanks, Emma! I found the sauce rather bland and far too sweet: after the first try, I used very dry Burgundy and half the sugar. Where I am firmly of the opinion "too much" and "garlic" are terms which cannot exist in the same sentence, I raised the amount to 2 Tbsp of freshly minced ... ambrosia. Then added 1/4 tsp of salt as per others' suggestions, 1/2 tsp yellow mustard & pinch of half-sharp paprika (Penzey's again). I have the sauce ready when the meat is done & use it to de-glaze the pan. I found 1/2 Tbsp of EVOO works quite well to prevent burning over medium (-) heat yet little remains to transfer to the sauce. With or without tweaks, this is a marvelous recipe and one I've enjoyed several times since I found it.

this was a terrific meal that we made quickly Sunday night for a family mean and now intend to make on Saturday when we have friends over.  The steaks needed a bit more time.  The sauce was WONDERFUL.  The cumin added a terrific flavour and I can see we'll make this often.
