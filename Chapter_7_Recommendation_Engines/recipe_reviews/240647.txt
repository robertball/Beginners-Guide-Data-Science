I made a double batch, they were perfect! You may need to keep them in the oven a little longer than called for.

A couple of notes, first it is very difficult to beat one egg white in the KA mixer bowl, use an immersion blender next time.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was more than enough.  I made a full batch of these and actually could have added even more nuts.   Make sure you do these on parchment paper or a silpat, also as soon as they come out of the oven, loosen them before they cool.  Egg white and sugar are like glue, that is great stuck to the nuts but not so great on a sheet pan.   Thanks, these will be nice to have around during the holidays.
