I read a review stating the mushroom and onions were raw after the meatloaf was cooked. Make sure to cut them small so they will cook with the meat. Mushrooms should be cut in half then sliced thinly and the onions cut into approximately quarter inch squares.... Just wanted to help...we have never had our mushrooms and onions turn out raw in this recipe!

My son, a friend of the family and I ate this for dinner last night. My son and I did not care for this but my friend loved it. I was skeptical of the sausage, but surprisingly, it did not overwhelm the meatloaf. What I did not like was the raw onion and the raw mushrooms. I think I like them more pre-cooked. I did not think that the bacon did anything for it. So, my friend has taken the meatloaf home and thanks you very kindly.

It was a wonderful and easy to make meatloaf.  I tend to like kethcup more, but I was very impressed with this one.  I put the barbecue sauce bottle and the kethcup bottle on the table when I served it so that we could add what we wanted on top of it though.

This is fabulous!  The right amount of spice to make it yummy and I look forward to leftovers.  

I only used 1/2 of a red onion since my husband doesn't like red onion.  I also think that it needs some kind of gravy on the side.  But I like it!

Great recipe.  It was easy and delicious.  I made some changes to add some of our favorite puertorrican seasoning.  My husband loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

My husband loved this meatloaf! I don't like meatloaf but this one was pretty darn good.  Made it as directed except I used canned mushrooms (didn't have fresh) and I chopped some pre-cooked bacon and mixed it in. Next time, I would saute the onions first because they were still a bit crunchy and I didn't like that.  Thanks for a great meatloaf recipe!

Bacon makes everything better.  I used Turkey instead of ground beef and crushed crackers instead of oatmeal.  My daughter loved it ,she said " I ate the bacon off the top and whenI got to the bottom it still tasted like bacon, ummmm"

My boys liked it very much, but I didn't care for it much (though I'm not a fan of meatloaf in general). We mixed the bacon into the meat instead of leaving it on top. I like addition of sausage though, and will use that concept for other beef-y recipes (like meatballs!). Where I live, the ground case-less sausage is only sold under the Maple Leaf brand for $5-6; the recipe uses pretty much the whole package (just a FYI for my fellow MTL cooks).

Love the addition of BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and instant oatmeal instead of bread crumbs in this recipe. I used ground sirloin and vension breakfast sausage as that is what I had on hand as well as used no salt canned mushroom pieces as I didn't have any fresh. And I served the bacon and cheese on the side as a garnish; I'm sure it would have been even more wonderful baked in. Thank you 3BoysMomma for sharing this great recipe!

Delicious even with Bacon omitted.  This is a "keeper" recipe as voted by my family.  Looking forward to meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.

I made this but instead of using the barbecue sauce and worcestershire sauce I used “Peg’s Meatloaf Sauce” also found on this site. I mixed ½ of the sauce with the meat mixture and the other half I used on top as a glaze. I also used ½ cup sharp cheddar, ¼ cup co-jack cheese, and ¼ provolone- mozzarella- parmesan Italian cheese blend. Best meat loaf ever my husband and kids loved it.

Made this tonite. Went by recipe exactly,except for the mushrooms. My wife doesn't eat mushrooms. To solve that issue for the rest of us I mixed everything together and placed in my Pyrex. One half of the loaf I placed on top mushrooms from a small jar of ready cooked. The other half I left alone. I cut bacon in half slices and laid across per instructions. Baked as instructed in my toaster oven/pre-heat well. One hour later it was cooked to 160 degrees and let me tell you, it was a hit! Oh I broiled it for two minutes just to give the bacon a richer look. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was a big hit! I did have to modify it a bit based on what I had on hand (I used seasoned ground turkey instead of the sausage); I also omitted the cheese and added chopped olives instead, as my husband doesn't like cheese. I would like to make it with the cheese sometime though, it sounds good to me. I did sautee the onions and mushrooms as a previous reviewer had suggested, and I think this contributed positively? to the flavor and texture.

I made this in a hurry as I had all the ingredients on hand.  Followed the recipe with two minor changes:  added Montreal Steak Seasoning (in place of  salt and pepper); & left out the cheese.    The Quaker Oats works really well with this recipe.   At the end of cooking, I put it under the broiler to crisp the bacon.  Delish!

Made this recipe with ground turkey and added a smoke spice, fresh garlic, mixed cheeses and fresh peppers (sautéed)...ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I cooked in 8x8 square dish and broiled for additional 8-12 mins to make sure the thick cut bacon was cooked.  I will not be making the same old meatloaf ever again!!

Thank God I had a meatloaf pan with a drain because it made a lot of grease at the bottom.  The other pan I used  was a normal loaf pan with a small grill placed on the bottom to drain all the grease.  ANOTHER METHOD FOR PREVENTING GREASY MEATLOAF IS TO PLACE YOUR LOAF ON TOP OF 2-4 SLICES OF BREAD AND THEN BAKE IT.  WHEN YOU SERVE IT, REMOVE THE BREAD FIRST. THE BREAD SOAKS UP THE GREASE! This meatloaf was very good. pretty much followed the recipe, except used turkey sausage, and added shredded carrots , shredded zucchini squash, and green peppers to the recipe. Sauteed all veggies in pan before adding to meat mixture. Oh, and used Mozzarella instead of Cheddar Cheese because I needed to use it up.   Next time will skip cheese entirely because it didn't seem to add anything to the dish except for a bunch more fat and calories. Maybe because it was Mozzarella?? Adding bacon seems to add plenty of extra calories as it is, but at least bacon packs a lot of flavor in it. Anyway, Doubled all ingredients except sausage (cuz I only had 1 pkg)  and it made two loaves, one larger than the other.   Served the smaller loaf to kids that wont eat onions and peppers.  My very picky son loved it!  Baked potatoes in the oven at the same time.  Cooking at 375* it was all ready in 1 hour, so I just turned oven off and let it rest/warm while waiting for everyone to be ready to eat.  Thanks so much for posting this!!!

If you like meat, like my family and  I do, then you will love this. I've made a few meatloaf recipes, one being a tried and true family recipe, and this one knocks their socks off, if recipes had socks, that is. There is no other way to describe it, other than plain marvelous- although the word marvelous is not so plain. Side note: I added celery, ommitted the mushrooms and used Progresso garlic and herb bread crumbs, instead of oatmeal.  Just enhanced the flavor!

I sautéed the onion and mushrooms before adding it to the meat mixture. I should have put it under the broiler at the end to crisp the bacon, but I ran out of time. I don’t care for meatloaf, but my husband said it was very tasty and gave it 4 stars.

I'm not a huge meat loaf fan but combine this with Chef John's mushroom gravy and we are talking about a new favorite recipe!

I made this with some wild pig sausage a friend gave me and with some venison that I got this year. Everything else was the same except I didn't have any barbecue sauce so I used ketchup. It was very good and we will be making this again.
