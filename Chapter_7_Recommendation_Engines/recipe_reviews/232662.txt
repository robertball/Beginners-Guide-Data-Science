Very flavorful meatloaf. The pineapple preserves were wonderful in this. If you don't like sweeter style dishes then this is not for you. I've made it twice and left out the brown sugar from the meatloaf itself the second time (not the top glaze though). Was still just fine, so that's one way to cut the sweet if you like. Truly if you try to substitute regular pineapple for the preserves, you'll be missing out. Reminded me of sweet and sour meatballs in a way, but not entirely. I didn't process mine just mixed by hand. Also, I always drain my meatloaves about 30 minutes into the cooking right before I top with the glaze.

I made this recipe exactly as listed tonight for dinner & it was delicious! 
I was excited about the pineapple preserves, my husband loves anything pineapple, but the amount of brown sugar worried me. 
In the end the worry was unnecessary as it was the best tasting meatloaf I have ever tasted...& I made it! Tangy, moist & a sweetness that really adds to the overall flavor. 
You will impress yourself & your fellow diners w/this one, especially if you're like me & can barely boil water unassisted :)

Made this and it was GREAT!  Everyone loved it and I was told I could make this again any time!  As I can never leave well enough alone I switched out the ketchup in the sauce, and added Chili Garlic Sauce.  This was awesome!  Gave the meatloaf a sweet yet spicy taste.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  (Adjust Chili Garlic with ketchup depending on your fondness for spice)

wow....taste wonderful. I will l definitely be making again. I never was a fan of meatloaf, but I love pineapple so I decided to try this recipe and it was wonderful. The whole family loved it. I didn't have access to as food processor  so I used a blender as and blended all the ingredients except the meat. Folded the blended mix with the ground beef and it really help keep everything moist and flavorful.

I used fresh ,minced garlic instead of garlic powder, cut back on half of the brown sugar and use finely diced pineapples as I was concerned that it would be too sweet. The mixture was soft and turned out to have the texture of a pate after baking. Way too soft.

This meatloaf was amazing! My 5 and 6 year old love it, and they don't usually like meatloaf. I needed to add more breadcrumbs because of the the pineapple, but this was delicious, moist, and something unexpected compared to the traditional recipes. If you want to wow your family, I'd go with this one. Plus, it tastes just as good cold as leftovers as it does after it's served.
