LOVED IT!  Even picky hubby!  I was looking for a change from the norm (ie: brown gravy pot roast) and this is great!  Thanks SM!

Excellent. I used Liptons beef onion soup in addition to 1 large onion. Did not use the beef enhancer because I did not have it in stock. Instead of cooking in the oven, I browned the roast beef in the skillet as directed and transferred to a crockpot. Served with red mashed potatoes, corn and homemade bread. Delicious meal.
