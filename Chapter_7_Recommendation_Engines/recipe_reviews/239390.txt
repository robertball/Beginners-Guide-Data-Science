I never baked pumpkin before, so I decided to try two separate recipes that both bake at 325° to see which one worked best.   I split one sugar pumpkin to use in both recipes.
The baking time for this recipe was substantially shorter than the other, however it was still longer than described in the recipe.  I was afraid that the pumpkin would be dried out because it wasn’t covered, but it came out beautifully.  I preferred using the food processor instead of the blender as I didn’t want to dilute the pumpkin, and it was much easier.  This recipe was the winner.

This was more labor-intensive than other pumpkin puree recipes I've tried, and took longer to cook than most.  The result was terrible, as the long cook on a low setting really just dried out the pumpkin.  In the end, I couldn't even puree it because the pumpkin itself wasn't cooked.  Not recommended.

I cut mine in half and lay them flat on the pan, so the "meat" is covered. It actually helps thoroughly cook the pumpkin because it steams it. I hope people realize they should be using a sugar pumpkin, also known as a pie pumpkin. The sugar content is much different than a jack-o-lantern pumpkin, the meat should not be drying out using this cooking method.
