I make this a tad differently. I use leftover chicken, cream of celery soup and only 1/2 cup of mayonnaise. Sometimes I add water chestnuts too if I have them. Very much a comfort food and sometimes I grill extra chicken just so I can make this.

i've made this for years but make a few changes: shred the chicken instead of "chunk" it,  omit oil (not at all needed),  use light sour cream instead of mayo (to make healthier, altho the mayo tastes great too!),  use low sodium soup,  use low sodium chicken broth instead of water (low sodium b/c uncle ben's wild rice seasoning packet is so salty).  and then when it's finished, crumble fried onion rings on top, or cheese, or both!  and broil til brown it really is a delicious recipe, and coming from someone who can't stand canned green beans, that's saying a lot.

This was delicious!  I only had Miracle Whip so I used 1/2 cup of that instead of a whole cup.  I also used white rice and topped the casserole with cheese.  I am watching my fiancee scarf it down straight from the casserole dish as I type.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe, but the rest of my family didn't enjoy it because the mayonnaise was too strong.  If I make it again, I'll cut back on the mayo, and possibly add a little velveeta.

This was a winner in my house of picky eaters.  I accidently bought zatarans newo orleans style wild rice but used it anyway.  It turned out great!

This was easy to make and pretty tasty - a good weeknight dinner.  Next time I will just cook the rice according to the package instructions, though - adding extra water per the recipe is pointless and draining it just adds an extra step.  I also happily cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup based on other reviews.  A full cup would have been too much.

I used half the micracle whip that the receipe asked for, and wouldn't have used more -- it was great, we had very little leftover!!!  Next time I may try biscuits on top, or on the side - we do believe it will be a staple in our family

Very easy to throw together on a week night.  I used left over chicken breast, and omitted the mayo altogether.  Added about 3/4 cup fat-free sour cream and a little of the liquid from the rice.  It was still pretty thick.  Also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top - b/c we LOVE cheese!  Next time, I'll add more cheese and some seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder?)  Needed a little something - maybe b/c I didn't use mayo?  My kids wouldn't eat it....but they don't eat anything!

Excellent! To make a bit healthier I used half greek plain yogurt and half cottage cheese in place of the mayo. Also added some salt and pepper and used a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking chicken. Was easier to microwave for 9 min then broil rather than use the oven and heat up the house in the middle of summer in Phoenix! Probably is great the way it is but this is what we liked!

Great recipe, like other reviews, I made a few changes. I used chicken thighs that I baked (I'm not good at frying)sour cream (just because I did not have mayo on hand) I also added a handful of shredded cheddar to the mix, and sprinkled top lightly with shredded cheddar and crushed seasoned croutons. Also, I used frozen green beans that I did not cook before hand. This gave it a nice texture. Next time I may try adding broccoli as that would be a nice addition with the cheese. My 3year old twins and husband loved it, I will deffinately be making this one again!

I gave this a 4 because I didnt cook the recipe as written. I followed the suggestions by other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, added cheddar cheese on top and finished it with a can of fried onions during the lst 5 minutes of cooking to heat them through. The family and my boyfriend RAVED about this recipe, the next day the left overs were gone.

This is definitely a comfort food. I just had a small sampling and I already feel comforted! That being said, of course I modified the recipe, I always do. I used plain white rice since that's what I had on hand. I fried the chicken till it was completely cooked along with an onion and a jalapeno in olive oil. I also added a can of peas to the mix and cut the mayo in half. For seasoning, I added red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and some cayenne pepper. Since I already pre-cooked the chicken in the pan, it only need a few minutes in the oven to heat everything up. I will definitely be making this again.

I thought it was just okay.  I added a package of onion soup mix, used fresh green beans, and had to add adobo upon serving.  Boyfriend enjoyed it with hot sauce.

just finished cooking it.  It's tasty, but I think it needs something.  May take someone's suggestion on the cheese and season salt.  Very good though (and I'm extremely kitchen challenged)...looking forward to dinner tomorrow night.

It was easy to make and tasty. I thought it was a little “rice heavy”, but easy enough to adjust for that.

I've made this twice-once without the mayo and once with 1/2 c. I didn't think it would add that much..but it did! It was so much richer . I also used cheddar cheese soup and added garlic croutons on top (my husband hates onions and mushrooms).  So easy to throw together. Definitely a keeper

This was very simple and delicious. I used fresh green beans, and a combo of mayo and sour cream. Plus, I aged park cheese and panko bread crumbs on top. Yum.

The mayo in this dish made it too tangy for the taste buds to enjoy.  No one in the family liked it, took 1 bite and said - no thanks.  It was easy to make.  I put the leftovers in the fridge and am going to try incorporating chicken gravy into it in hopes to better the taste.

I added onions, used 1/2 cup of mayo (but next time I'm not using any, going to double the soup) cream of chicken soup, cheddar cheese and crispy onions  on top. Came out delicious

Since my husband and I don't like mayonnaise, I used plain
Greek yogurt instead.  My husband thought this was terrific.  I found it boring and way more work than it was worth.  I give it three stars, but he'd give it more like 4.5

wow this was pretty good!! i made just a couple altercations (some things is all i had on hand) i used rice a roni long grain wild rice and 1/4 c mayo 1/4 c plain Greek yogurt. Also left the rice just a bit liquidey to make it less dense and frozen green beans. Cooked as instructed and added cheese. i can not believe my daughter (5yrs) asked for seconds, made my heart happy! and i added a sprinkle cayenne pepper for a little kick (only on me and my hubbys)! thanks for posting this i will def. make again!

Great recipe....I cook the rice according to the package directions in the microwave, use a can of chicken, drained (from Sams club),1/2 cup of mayo and one can of drained green beans.  All done in the microwave...quick and fast!

I made this the day after I made a roasted chicken so I basically used leftovers to make this casserole.  I used lite sour cream instead of mayo and it was very moist and creamy. Next time I am going to do 1/2 mayo and 1/2 lite sour cream to add the flavor that I think this was missing.  I will make again. Great recipe for me not to waste food.
