I found this recipe while looking for something different to do with a bunch of jalapenos that needed to be used.  I don't fry things but I was really curious about the flavor combination.  I mixed the  cheese, peanut butter, chutney, and Cajun seasoning together and stuffed the mix into a dozen jalapenos that I halved and seeded, then pressed the tops into a bowl of panko and baked for 15 mins.  I took them to a potluck at work, served with a creamy garlic dressing and they had everyone talking about how good and different they were.
