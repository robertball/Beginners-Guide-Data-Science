Not overly sweet like so many - more like the homemade kind at our local asian restaurant. Chili sauce makes it great!

Made it with the ketchup and no cayenne; best  sweet and sour I've ever had, and none of the HFCS that it seems everything out there is using these days; all I'll use going forward. Thanks!

Noted that other reviews said it didn't have enough sour so I substituted the broth for cider vinegar and I dont have regular hit sauce so used siracha. Just the right amount of sweet and sour and the heat hits you after.

This was a simple recipe that I was able to make quickly.  It tasted great!  I did not include the chili sauce and cayenne pepper (as my stomach is sensitive to pepper).  I also substituted the wine vinegar with lemon juice.  I added some ginger and two dashes of garlic powder.  I would make it again!

DELICIOUS! I used Laoganma Fried Chili in Oil because I wasnâ€™t sure what hot sauce to use. Forgot the cayenne pepper because I was in a rush and it turned out Devine! Sooo good. I will be using this recipe from now on. ??

I didn't have lemon so I used vinegar. Poured it over a pork roast in my slow cooker for sweet and sour pulled pork.

This turned out great. I used Zatarain's Cajun hot sauce for the chili sauce and added a small squirt of ketchup. This was not quite as sour as I expected but it was suitable and fit the purpose I intended. I needed a sauce that was fast, easy, and didn't require pineapple juice or green peppers and this was it. I kept this one to make again.

Substituted 1/2 red wine vinegar and rice vinegar and added 1/2 tbs more sugar.  It was a tad too tart otherwise.

Much to sour for my liking, added more sugar and it was much better. I used catsup instead of chili sauce and cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar. Will make again adding the additional sugar.

This was so delicious !  I had some chunks of pork, red onion, broccoli, canned mango, and water chestnuts, but didn't know what to sauce it up with. This sauce was so tasty and perfectly complimented the other ingredients!

I don't know why, but it has a faint maple taste. It was easy to make, but not sour enough.

Not exactly what I was looking for to dip Wontons in, but it was very tasty.  I made exactly as written, but I think using ketchup will make it more to my liking, as suggested.

We had an improv Chinese food night and needed a quick sauce. This was easy and unexpectedly flavorful! I'll be using it again - thank you!
