My husband gave this 5 stars. I thought it was too sweet, but I don't care for sweet things whereas, he could eat sugar out of a bowl. So, 5 stars it gets. I used a homemade version of a boxed cake mix instead of store-bought mix. The cake is nice and spongy. The brown sugar syrup is really good, but I think it is too much. Next time I'll reduce the amount by about a third. It left the cake a bit soggy. I didn't use the cherries but simply doubled the pineapple. Definitely a good cake. Just how good depends on your level of sweet tooth! :-) Thank you qwertycook for your recipe.

I made this for a friend, and it was way better than any other gluten free dessert we've tried. A little dense, and a little dry, but that's the norm with gf dishes. They were very happy with it. I used cinnamon instead of star anise, and I replaced the vermouth with apple juice. Also, my market didn't have vanilla cake mix, so we used funfetti instead. It was pretty funny when I flipped it over and thought a green sprinkle was mold!! If I made this again, I would use more liquid... Butter or juice, maybe, but I think it would be good with some additional crushed pineapple mixed into the cake mix. Overall, very pleased.
