This was goo d.  I made it with puff pastry from the grocery store freezer section.  Thaw the dough per the instructions on the package, cut into 2x2" squares and line mini muffin tins with them before filling with pear, honey, and brie mixture.  I couldn't find any fresh thyme at the store, so I used dried and it worked OK.  Instead of drizzling honey over the pears and brie, I put the diced pears in a bowl, drizzled honey over  them and mixed it up with the dried thyme before spooning into the puff pastry squares in the muffin tin.  Since the recipe called for fresh thyme, I eyeballed the amount and think I used a little too much as the herb flavor can overpower the subtly of brie and pear.  So, just a warning  to use it sparingly.    Another recipe I found called for cardamom, which I may have tried but didn't have any on hand.  Just a variation someone else might want to try.  Overall, a good recipe that is easy to make and has good flavor.

I made 48 of these for a party, and they were all eaten quickly.  They are so simple to make.   The creamy Brie worked so well with the lightly sweet pear and the small drizzle of honey.  The only change I made was to bake them for approximately 5min.  The cheese was completely melted by then, and they were piping hot.  I'll be making these again!

it was very easy to make and pretty tasty, if somewhat mild in flavor.  I will defiantly make these again, but most likely add a second fruit with a bolder taste like fresh cherries or pecans.

I am giving this 5 stars based on the speed that these were gobbled up at a multi-Family Christmas party. Teenagers raved, multiple recipe requests. So easy!

Excellent as written!   Also good with a small slice of smoky link/smoked sausage added!     Try it like that sometime!

A huge hit at Christmas brunch. I made it exactly as written and then added a drizzle of a flavored balsamic vinegar.

Fabulous & Easy to make! I keep the ingredients on hand in the event friends pop over. 

To simplify even more, I omitted the thyme and pear and garnished with an almond sliver. HUGE hit every time!

Easy to make even for me! Very subtle flavor, it's the attraction, might try some of the changes other reviews suggested for stronger flavor.

Made these for a party and the feedback was unanimously great.  Made recipe as stated.  The next time I would likely remove the thyme and would either remove peels before dicing (mine turned a brown shade) or might try another fruit like strawberries or a bold fruit.

Incredible, these are so delicious and easy to make! I couldn't get phyllo tart shells, but regular tart shells worked great.

I made these  and they were great.  The only change that I made is that I had to use dried thyme since I did not have the fresh.  It took a little time the dice up everything to the small dice that was needed to fit nicely into the mini shells but it was worth it.

Made it for an appetizer last week and everyone loved it. Didn't' have access to phyllo pastry tart shells, so used regular pastry tart shells and everyone agreed they were fine.

Thank you for quick prep appetizer.  you can use goat cheese instead.  i had a jar of pear conserve and used small amt on cheese. fresh thyme made it special.  it was a hit with the party crowd as it disappeared quickly, and i got requests for the recipe.

We loved them!  The only reason I didn’t give a five is because I didn’t follow the recipe completely.  We used cranberry sauce with orange juice, orange rind and Grand Marnier(?) which is outstanding. But we added some drops of very good balsamic vinegar on top and it was amazingly good.

Left off the thyme but otherwise made exactly as written. The honey drizzle is an absolute necessity. Served as an appetizer for company. It was a huge success and so easy. They were all eaten. Will make again, even for a just a snack.
