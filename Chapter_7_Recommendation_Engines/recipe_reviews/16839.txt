The name says it all!  I did not have peanuts on hand, so substituted some peanut butter and used honey mustard (we like honey!).  Chicken came out tender, juicy, and with a wonderful sweet/tangy flavor.

I added a couple tablespoons of minced garlic to the sauce and used cashews instead of peanuts because that's what I had. I also added onion chunks and about 2/3 of a bag of baby carrots around the chicken while it was cooking. The carrots and onions were *amazing*, some of the best I've ever had, but the chicken was just okay, very moist but rather bland.   It might be better using boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I'd like to try this sauce with a whole chicken in the slow cooker, though. (Maybe it would absorb more of the flavor?) This sauce would also be great on pork.    I will probably make this again.

hmmmm how to rate. Husband really liked it. It was WAY too sweet for my taste though. I worried about the raisins burning, so I put the glaze on and then added the raisins the last 20 minutes. They still burned:( If you like sticky and sweet chicken this will def work for you. If I made it again, I would omit the raisins for sure. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy.  Decreased the brown sugar to 1 1/2 tbsp.  Added some salt to the sauce.  Used thin sliced chicken breasts - 10 minutes, then flip and pour the rest of the sauce over it.  10 more minutes in the oven and it's done.  Great recipe.

So easy, and love that it uses readily available ingredients.  Not too sweet.
