I love scrambled eggs and I love avocados, so I just had to try this! I cut the recipe in half and added some onion, red pepper and garlic.  Once the egg mixture was done I added some cheddar cheese and let it melt.  I left the bacon in strips and wrapped everything into warm tortillas - YUM!

I have made scrambled eggs with avocado before, but I used mashed instead of cubed. I also added halved grape tomatoes and chopped onions. Sometimes I'll even add cubed deli ham. I think the avocado adds a wonderful flavor to the eggs and it's good for you, too. Thanks for submitting this!

Hubs and I generally eat nice breakfasts on the weekends and we try to stay away from things like waffles, pancakes, and French toast.  That means we eat a lot of egg breakfasts and it's nice to find something like this recipe that adds some creativity to the same ol,' same ol.'  I added chopped mixed color bell peppers, minced jalapeno pepper, onions and garlic, which made the dish colorful - and it never hurts to add veggies for extra nutrition wherever you can.  The avocado is so mild it really doesn't add a whole lot taste-wise, but it makes this SO creamy, not to mention that it is considered one of the great super foods.  I topped this off with a little shredded cheese, more for garnish than anything else.  Hubs opted out of this as he didn't like the idea of avocado mixed with warm eggs, but I enjoyed it.

I would have never put avocado in my eggs if I wasn't an Allrecipes addict!! This was very different, but don't think I would make it again. I did leave the bacon out, but kept everything else the same.

This is a nice way to use avocado and I liked the texture and flavor it gave the eggs.
