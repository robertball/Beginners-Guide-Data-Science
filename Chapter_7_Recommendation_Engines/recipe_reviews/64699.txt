Sorry, didn't really like this recipe.  I didn't think it tasted much like a gyro.  I do thank you for introducing me to Boca Burgers though, they ROCK!!!  :o)

This is one of my favorite summer lunches! If I'm in a hurry I usually grate some cucumber into ranch dressing instead of making the sauce from scratch. I also enjoy spinach leaves instead of lettuce and sometimes add feta cheese.

This worked great, it was just what I was looking for, vegetarian gyros!  Fast too.

The taste of the Boca Burgers matches the taste of gyro meat better than they match regular burgers!

I added a dollop of ranch dip to my sauce in the blender.  

Try it, you'll be suprised how similiar to the 'real thing' it tastes.

this was pretty good. i can't say i liked the taste of boca burgers, but the sauce was an excellent cover up! onions and cucumbers, both sliced paper-thin, made a great finishing touch.

These are good.  Not quite like a real gyro, but close, and the cucumber sauce is really quite good.  These are filling, but a bit messy.  I will make them again.

a very good vegetarian gyro!!!! I havr missed some things such as gyro's and was delighted to find this. I made the amount of sauce called for, I chopped 2 burgers up into strips, and stuffed it all in one pita (cut in half) and used half of the sauce. I kept the remainder of the sauce for another veggie gyro later this week. Very easy and the sauce is yummy. If fact, I love veggie sandwiches and may make this again also without the soy burger. Thank you so much!!
