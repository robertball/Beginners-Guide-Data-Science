Worked great for me!  I just love daiqiris!  I've been looking for a decent recipe.  I might add a little more ice, but who knows what ice is needed, when you can just improvise?

Bad bad bad. I had to dump this out. Might as well just have a shot of rum!

This was too strong, I got 3 people that agree. I stirred in more sugar to make it more drinkable. Tasted like plain rum.
