This was a great idea!  I didn't have tuna and American on hand so I used a can of chicken and cheddar cheese.  DELICIOUS!  I've never thought of adding cheese before.  I gave 4 stars because of the changes I made, but it was a 5 star taste!  I think I'll add some cooked spinach or broccoli next time and make it a complete 1-dish meal.

What's better is to crush up cheeze-its,dice some pickles, diced onions,add 2 slices of cheese and the tuna. It's also good with diced tomatoes on top. It becomes thick and is great with crackers.

Great simple recipe!  I made a few variations.  I like spicy food, so I added some diced jalapeno peppers and diced mexican-style stewed tomatoes.  I also added a little water & butter to try to prevent it all from sticking & clumping together, but to no avail.  I'd also suggest breaking the noodles in half to enable the ingredients to better mix with the noodles.  Overall, very tasty & filling!

I tripled this recipe for my kids.  They loved it.  The second time I made it with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  It turned out delicious.

Great last minute meal! I used the cup noodles(2.25oz) and the regular size canned tuna(6oz) with 1 slice Montery Jack. The cup'o'noodles have the spices already in cup so I poured the cup of boiling water over it, let it sit for a minute then put the noodles on top of the cheese and tuna leaving out most of the water.It was great(I ate it all in 1 sitting) and I didn't miss any of the salt or flavorings from the broth!

Not to bad for cheap, on the fly 'dorm' food.  I did mine with half a pack of seasoning (that stuff's really salty!), a lil' EVOO (yummo!), and a slice of Pepperjack cheese.

What a pleasant surprise!  This was actually pretty good and after adding some cooked chopped broccoli, it looked pretty too!  (I did use cheddar cheese instead of american though...)  I won't make this too often because the sodium police would be after me for feeding this to my kids, but they both gobbled it down so I'm sure I will make this every once in a while as something different for lunch!

I use tuna and on occasion for a change I use a can of white meat chicken instead. To make it cheesy I add a couple of table spoons of Ragu Double Cheddar sauce. An alternative is to use a couple table spoons of Ragu  Alfredo sauce with the canned chicken. For a slightly different taste add a half cup of angel hair shredded cabbage when cooking the noodles and diced ham.  YUMMY!  ...and it helps keep the food from being just the same old stuff everyday.

This was pretty good. It was a little thick for me.  I added a little milk and scooped it up with potato chips.

Surprisingly good!  I doubled the recipe and added a can of cream of chicken soup.  I used chicken instead of tuna only because that's what I had on hand. I used one package of seasoning even though I doubled the recipe and that seemed just right.  I also used cheddar because I find American cheese too waxy.  My six year old loved it!

Made this for lunch to serve to my son (he loves ramen noodles!). Just by looking at the recipe I knew it would be pretty bland or to salty (as many reviewers mentioned) so I did it like this: I chose to use veggies so I put up the water to boil and tossed in a handful of frozen beans/corn mix. Once water was boiling added the noodles and cooked for a few minutes (package says 2-3 minutes), drained and placed back in the pot. Tossed in two handfuls of shredded cheddar with garlic and herb, about 1/2 cup 5% cooking cream & and the tuna. Let the tuna heat through and cheese melt. At this point I hadn't added the seasoning packets but chose to sprinkle in a bit for more flavour. This could use some black pepper and it'll be spot on. Great for lunch, this was done in 5 minutes!

This was really great with the few things we had on hand. I chopped up and boiled some baby carrots, added in the noodles, then when they were almost done I added an egg, and super sharp cheddar cheese. It looks like slop, but tastes sooo good!

This is really good I substituted cheddar cheese for the american cheese and after playing with the recipe for a bit I just finally left out the little packet of seasoning that comes with the ramen noodles. the cheese and the tuna give enough flavor that you dont need the sodium packet at all.

I made this recipe in my dorm room late at night when the dining halls were closed. I changed the recipe a little by adding broccoli and corn in addition to the cheese and tuna. I am giving this recipe 3 stars because the noodles were a little too salty. Because of the cheese, I don’t think you need to add the entire bag of instant noodle seasoning. But other than that, this recipe is a good idea if you’re tired of normal instant noodle. If you want to make it like mine with broccoli and corn, add the veggies with 1 minute left in the microwave so you can have cooked vegetables.

Actually, to my surprise, this recipe is very good!  Easy to make and cheap, cheep.  I added crunched up potato chips sprinkled over the top along with some pepper.  Big Thumbs up here.

I added my own twist to the recipe, I used beef ramen, a little butter, and shredded cheddar cheese with the tuna and it is so incredibly good for a ramen noodle recipe. Excellent.

Found this recipe while looking for something quick to fix for lunch.  I doubled it to use my 6 oz can of tuna and my rather picky husband even liked it.  I did add some diced tomatoes, and the next time I fix it will either add a little tomato juice or water so it does not stick together in clumps.

After draining - Half the seasoning packet, 1 tbsp margarine, half cup of shredded cheddar cheese. 1 min. on high then stir in the tuna. Voila! Great flavour and your nuker doesn’t stink of warm tuna

I made this in a pan with keeping a little of the water in the pan to help it damp while cheese was melting and tuna was heating on stove. Came out good.

I love this!! I was a little worried that tuna and cheese would be a bad combo, but it is fantastic! I would give this five stars but it is so bad for you! This is one of those meals that tastes amazing, but the guilt that comes with it it tastes horrid. One of the best recipes for a quick delicious and really easy meals!!

Surprisingly good. I used Cheddar instead of American though. I also added a little water before the final microwaving to make it creamier.
