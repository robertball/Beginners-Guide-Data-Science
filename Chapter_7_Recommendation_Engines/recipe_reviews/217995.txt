This is great.  I used one zucchini and one yellow squash and tossed in a few nice quartered mushrooms for texture.  With 5-7 minutes left on the roasting time I threw in a nice handful of grape tomatoes for color.
Lovely presentation and delicious.

This is excellent!  Both of my boys are picky eaters and they gulped this down.  Didn't use as much oil and used Lowry's seasoning salt instead.  Never have any left over.

I didn't use quite as much oil as the recipe calls for, and just used some garden herbs that I have on hand.  This is an easy, tasty recipe!  Thanks!

My favorite way to prepare yellow squash! I use less olive oil. I vary the spices. Sometimes dill, other times just thyme, oregano, and parsley. It is also good with a garlic infused oil and Italian seasoning.

Yummy! I didn't use as much olive oil (too many WW points)(about 2 tablespoons did the trick). Used the herbes de Provence and garlic - also a pinch of fresh Thyme from the garden. We didn't have any leftovers!

This is absolutely delicious and easy.  I have no idea what the herbes de Provence is so of course I just do without it. I throw in the grape tomoatoes at the end as another person suggested. This is definately a keeper for my family.

SO easy!  I'm still learning to cook and currently trying to make simple healthy things, this fit the bill!  I think i baked a total of 14 minutes and i thought they turned out perfectly tender.  Used less oil than suggested and baked on a tinfoil covered cookie sheet.

Very easy & tasty. My kids are not big squash fans, but both ate this without any complaints. So it's a keeper. My husband and I both enjoyed it. Great way to fix summer squash quickly.

I'm sorry but we didn't care for this at all. The only changes I made was to use less olive oil and I didn't have herbes de provence so I used Italian herbs instead.

Very good recipe--takes longer to cook than what recipe leads you to believe.  Also could easily reduce the amount of olive oil without sacrificing any taste.  Love the summer veggies!

This was not our favorite summer squash recipe; I probably will not make this again.  It wasn't bad, just not our favorite.  There is a lot of oil; I found it hard to brown the squash to a nice crisp.  My family preferred Peg's Summer Squash Bake (we have a lot of squash and are trying a lot of recipes).

I have made this recipe about 10 times now and have even taken it to 2 dinner parties as my side dish.  Everyone always loves it!  To feed a large group I used 3 zucchini and 3 yellow squash and added a large package of whole mushrooms, halved, plus a large package of cherry tomatoes.  I just doubled the oil/seasoning and used two roasting pans to cook everything.  Turns out amazing every time and it's healthy and gluten-free!

I usually roast random veggies with butter but I decided to try something new tonight. I think the oil ruined it, I'll stick with butter. Otherwise, it would have been good.

I liked this, but was distracted while preparing and left out the herbs so the taste was a little bland. The recipe has great potential and is very flexible.  I may try cooking in a pan on the grill. I will definitely try with other summer veggies....and as so many already have  said, I reduced the amount of oil used.

This was a nice alternative to simple squash. Kidlets liked it which is a nice bonus. Makes the house smell wonderful. With 6 zucchinis and yellow squash, I played with the seasoning proportion so my senses wouldn’t be overwhelmed (2 tsp rather than 3 tsp). Kept everything else the same.

I made this, but I only put it in for the recommended time. Some of them were crispy, but not all of them. I'll probably add on a little more time as the recipe advised. But it tasted great. :)

It was a very hot day in the summer when I made this.  So rather than heating my oven, I elected to try cooking it in the microwave.    I microwaved it for 2 1/12 minutes, turning the bowl every minute and stirring.   It was very good!

We loved this recipe - the Herbs de Provence was the key. I noticed the recipe came from an Iowan cook, and this dish reminded me of summers in Iowa with that subtle lavender - what a perfect choice of herb for the squash - will make again for sure!

Normally I steam my summer squash,but this was a great alternative to steaming. I did not have any herb de provinces so I used Italian seasoning. This worked out good because I was having it with lasagna. I will make it again and maybe add other vegetables.

I thought this was a pretty good dish and was simple to make.  The pieces of squash that had too much oil on them turned out softer than I would like.  I may use less oil the next time I make this recipe.  I cooked the squash about 15 minutes total.

I tried this last night.  It took a little longer to cook but that was fine.  I just kept checking it to prevent burning.  I also added an Italian cheese blend on the top for the last 4 minutes or so... It added a lovely taste.

I loved this recipe. I didn't use the herbes de provence and added a little extra garlic and figured that I would have left overs as I live alone. I was almost wrong. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!! I only used 2 tbsp of olive oil as suggested by other reviewers and it was just enough.  This is definitely a keeper for my recipe book!

This is a great recipe. I honestly never liked squash, but after trying to eat more healthy foods, I figured I would give this recipe a whirl. Makes a food that I never really enjoyed actually enjoyable! Will continue to use this recipe!

Turns out I bought the wrong kind of squash so I went with zucchini. It was a-mazing! I grabbed a couple of Roma tomatoes and sliced and used the same herb mixture and baked alongside and they were fantastic. Only recommendation is to use less oil. I think olive oil cooking spray with the herbs would do just fine. It was too oily with 1/4 cup, but the taste was wonderful!

This was very good!  I used 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash.  I didn't have any herbes de Provence so I just used some Seasonall.  Will make again!
