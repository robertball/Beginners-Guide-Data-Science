Try spreading cream cheese on the ham before rolling up the asparagus, tastes great and you don't need a sauce to dip it in.

This is great.  I also made another version - no dip but spread cream cheese with a little green mustard powder on the ham before rolling around the asparagus.  I used both black forest and baked ham.  Very different results, but both very good!

I didn't try the dip, just the roll-ups, which I liked. Simple, tasty, pretty! I put them in the oven on low after I rolled them, to warm them up a little.

I tried these at a party and they used slivered dill pickle spears. I took them to Thanksgiving as an easy appetizer. I used a zip lock bag to 'pipe' a line of cream cheese along a slice of ham, added a thin dill spear, rolled it, then added a toothpick. No dipping sauce was needed and my diabetic uncle pigged out on these with out much guilt:)

Great finger food. I made them for a dinner party I threw last week. Everyone loved them. Great twist on an old recipe. I like it.

I make these all the time in the spring.  Instead of the sauce, try using a thin processed cheese slice half (fold corner to corner to break into 2 triangles).  LOVE the taste of asparagus and cheese together!

Very good!  I added sliced Kraft singles to half of my batch - just roll them on up!  The dip was very good as well.  Not amazing...but still a very good recipe to bring to a get together.
