Delicious!  My fiance was thrilled with this creation -- not only was it delicious but it looked like I spent a lot of time on the meal.  Trying to keep the sodium low I took out the olives and the capers and only used half of the pesto called for in the recipe. This was the best meal that I have ever prepared and I intend on making it again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This dish was simple and very sophisticated.  A great entertaining dish.  Colorful, flavorful - everybody loves it!  I don't use as much pesto as the recipe calls for, nor do I use the capers.  I put the olives on the side for folks to use as a garnish.  FABULOUS RECIPE - thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is delicious and quick to whip up!!
The only changes I made was added more garlic because I'm a garlic fan.  I used the whole 10 oz of Sun dried Pesto jar I had. Also, I added a bit more of olive oil and almost close to a cup of white wine.
The next time I make it, I will remove the shrimp tails as well before cooking.
My boyfriend and I very excited to eat the leftovers tonight!
