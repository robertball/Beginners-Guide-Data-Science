My daughter sent me this recipe.  She loved it so much.  I added 1/2 tsp. sage, 2 Tbsp. of grated parmesan, onion power, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Also, I added about 1/8 cup of water.  It made the meatballs soooo delicious.  This is a keeper for me for sure!

Maybe I should have been more specific about the fat content of the turkey (see the previous review) but 99% fat free turkey does not work (I also tried to use it). The meat should have at least 7% fat.

Absolutely delicious! I did make a couple of additions/changes - I used meatloaf mix (beef/pork/veal), and added 2 TBSP of parmesan cheese and 2 tsp crushed garlic for extra flavor. Baked them according to the recipe then put them in a pot of sauce to simmer for a couple hours. They were fantastic! Definitely a keeper!

These are very good.  I tripled the recipe, put the cooked meatballs in a zip lock, put them in the freezer and use them as needed.  This is a simple recipe that gets even better when the meatballs are tossed into homemade marinara sauce.

Very nice! I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I added dried Italian seasoning to the plain bread crumbs. I also added minced garlic and some Parmesan/Romano cheese. They were delicious. I simmered the baked meatballs in Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce from this site and ate them with whole wheat spaghetti. Healthy and quite light dinner yet so tasty...

A great way to prepare a meatball!  I made these with ground beef.  Very nice.  .  I rate it a 5 because it is a great basic meatball and is fine as is.  However it’s simplicity leaves plenty of room for additions.   I will spare you a list of little additions that could be made to the basic recipe.  I definitely think I’ll have my son make these next time.  It is a great starter recipe for kids in the kitchen.  Thanks for sharing it!

These were a very good base recipe. I only had 99% fat free turkey, but I added cheese and a touch of olive oil and they were very moist. I also added garlic, salt, pepper, oregeno, basil & minced onion. My 2 and 1 year gobbled them up.

Very, very good. I made them for a Weight-Watchers Mediterranean-style pita sandwich. I added cumin, garlic powder, onion salt, salt, pepper, ground sage and a splash of water. Also, I used two egg whites instead of an egg. They turned out moist and VERY flavorful. Don't massage the meat too much, though, if you're using extra lean ground turkey. I mixed everything with the beaten egg first and then mixed it in JUST enough. YUM!!!

Good foundation recipe for meatballs.  The recipe itself is bland, but you can season to your taste.  For myself, I used garlic, some finely chopped onion, italian seasoning.  Be creative :)

Yes, these are fast and friendly!  I did season them more as suggested by SandraM...1/2 t. sage, 2T grated Parm. cheese, onion & garlic powders, s&p.  Used with the Pasta w/Tomato Cream Sauce from this site for a winning combination.  Family liked it & they didn't even know that it was ground turkey instead of beef.

VERY good!! I used to work at an Italian restaurant and my husband thinks these are way better!! I followed another users review and added some extra spices:  1/2 tsp. sage, 3 tbs. grated parmesan cheese, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. onion powder, 2 cloves of minced garlic and a dash of garlic powder, and some ground pepper. I cooked them according to the directions then added them to the crock pot (on low) with a jar of regular spaghetti sauce and left them in there for a few hours! My husband ate almost every single on before I could even finish cooking the spaghetti that night!!

These were delicious - so good you almost could mistake them for beef.  I used 93% lean ground turkey.  I didn't use the olive oil. I sprayed Pam onto the baking dish.  I added some salt, pepper, garlic, italian seasoning, finely chopped onion, grated parmesan cheese in addition to the italian style bread crumbs and the egg. These were very moist and full of flavor.  I added them to Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce from this site.

Awesome!!! I added a 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp rubbed sage, 3 Tbls of ketchup, 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese as well as a 1/8 cup of milk. I kept all other measurements the same in regards to the egg and breadcrumbs. I also used the Italian seasoned ground turkey. I baked these for 20 mins as directed and then put them in my slow cooker with some pasta sauce. I simmered them for a couple hours, they came out great. I have been making a lot of recipes with ground turkey lately and I like it so much better than ground beef. One last tip, when making meatballs or meatloaf mix all the dry ingredients first, then the egg(s) then gently fold in meat, this will ensure that the meat will not get overworked and all ingredients will distribute evenly.

I made these with panko instead or bread crumbs and an egg substitue equal to 1 whole egg. These were super easy to make and the texture is really nice.  A little bland though.  I will definately make again but add some more seasonings to the meatballs. Served with the Best Marinara Sauce and whole wheat past for a healthy dinner. Thanks!

I gave these meatballs 4 stars because if I had made them as directed, they probably would've been too bland for our tastes. However, with the changes suggested by reviewers, I'd give them a 5.  First of all, I used regular ground turkey (not the extra-lean variety). I added the following ingredients for extra flavor: 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp Kraft grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp ground basil, 1/8 tsp sage, 1/8 tsp pepper, 3/4 tsp onion powder, and 1 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce.  Also, I used plain breadcrumbs and added an additional 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning to them. Like others, I lined the UN-preheated dish with aluminum foil and sprayed with cooking spray. Baked them for 30 min. Great flavor and perfect texture!  A great basic recipe!

Great basic recipe to make it a little healthier I added one full package of chopped frozen spinach (thawed) and used whole grain bread crumbs.  I also added shaved Parmesan & minced garlic, served it with o organics thin whole wheat spaghetti sauce and used o organics tomatoe basil pasta sauce- delicious!

WOW! Just like to say i goofed up and added the oil to the meat mixture and it was the best mistake I made. So moist and amazingly delicious.  I also added 1 tsp each of garlic salt, oregano, basil and italian seasoning.  This is foolproof. great with italian sauce or ketchupn .I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray.

I love these meatballs!  All I added was some garlic and basil seasonings.  I baked them just like the recipes says and put them in the fridge.  When ready to use them, I slow cook them!  Delicious!!!

Ok, but because of food allergies I had to use Egg Replacer and plain crumbs.  Suspect the original recipe is alot better than my attempt.  Loved the way you cooked them in the oven, that will be my technique from now on.

I make this recipe all the time, it easy and delicious.  Based on others suggestions I always add 2 TBS grated parmesan cheese, 2 tsp of minced garlic and some Italian seasoning.  I like small, uniform meatballs so I use a cookie dough scoop to portion them before forming them by hand.  The leftovers freeze quite nicely, and you'll be happy to have one day when you thrown them in to a pot of spaghetti, and voila, you have dinner!

This recipe is so easy and wonderful!  I used ground chuck instead of turkey, and I added a tablespoon of milk, a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce, and some additional basil, garlic, and onion powder.  I followed the cooking instructions, but felt that they could have cooked 5-10 minutes longer.  I will make this recipe again, and next time I will place the meatballs on a rack in my pan and not worry about turning them at all!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Wow, I am giving this 5 stars because it is so easy & an excellent base recipe. I followed everything exactly except for these things: only had 1 lb of meat, only had plain breadcrumbs. I also added the 2Tb grated parm, 1/2 tsp sage. 1/8 tsp each: onion pwdr, garlic pwdr, salt & pepp. The ice cream scooper for sizing was a neat touch. I should have added the basil/oregano that would have been in the Italian crumbs. I had some trouble getting the meatballs to brown/crisp, I used a nonstick pan with the olive oil but most of the oil just beaded up/went to one corner so that may have had something to do with it. I wonder how it would do if I lined  it with alum foil? Maybe I could have fried them up a little more on the stove afterwords (defeating some of the healthiness)? The baking time was otherwise accurate though. So easy & fast!!

WONDERFUL RECIPE! I used ground beef with 25% fat instead of turkey. You really need to have more than 7% percent of fat in your meat - trust me. After reading the reviews and wanting more flavor, I added a teaspoon of onion powder, 1-2 teaspoons basil, 1/4 cup of extra bread crumbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. They turned out great! If you need even more flavor, add a little bit of oregano, but I doubt you will be disappointed with this recipe! note: if you want them to be healthier, use less olive oil. 2 tablespoons was too much for me. 1 Tablespoon would be better. :)

This is great recipie and the timings are perfect.  The only thing is I think it needs a lot more spicing up.  I always at 1 tbl orange juice to any ground turkey recipie to help with the taste.  I also added Garlic, onion , and chili powder.

I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with PAM cooking spray instead of using olive oil. I also seasoned the turkey with a little bit of salt, some pepper, and garlic powder as well as added in some chopped onion. They came out perfectly and I will be making these again. This is a great basic recipe that allows creativity for a few extra ingredients.

Five stars for a blissfully simple basic recipe! I was blown away at how easy, quick and tasty these are!

I'm sure it would be fantastic as it is. However, the 5 stars are based on using plain bread crumbs with some garlic powder, oregano, and parsley to taste. I figured it would be pretty similar. Instead of flipping 5 min toward the end, I flipped halfway through. They came out juicy and flavourful, with a lovely texture that had just the right amount of crispness on the outside. 

I will definitely make these again!

DELICIOUS!!! These are amazing. I used the suggestions and made a few changes: 1.5 lbs turkey, 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1.5 eggs, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil, 1 TBSP minced dry onion, a sprinkle of garlic powder, and salt. They are super moist yet hold their shape very well. Will def. make again and again!

This was great!! I'd never tried ground turkey before so I searched for just the right recipe for a busy family with three children ages five and under (that'd be us!). I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs so I took some leftover Stove Top stuffing crumbs and put them thru the food chopper to make finer crumbs....I added about 1/3 cup to the turkey, with one egg beaten, a dash of oregano, and a couple shakes of garlic powder. Other than that I followed the directions exactly as posted. They came out GREAT and my kids gobbled them up (haha, no pun intended)....I will definitely make these again. Even my husband loved'em. Giving four stars only b/c I modified the recipe a bit...and couldn't add Parmesan cheese as others did, only b/c we have milk sensitivities in our family. Anyway thanks for a great recipe!

This is an excellent base for an Italian meatball recipe. 

Little things I do differently:  use ground beef (of course that is a matter of preference); add more dry seasoning, especially salt.  

I add in sauted onions and garlic with seasoning. (Idea courtesy of Chef Anne Burrell).  I use 2 garlic cloves and about half a small onion, but that too is a matter of preference. When they cool I put the mixture through the food processor.  (at first it did not want to cut them up, but I added in some water and then it chopped them off.  I strained the water off and used just the solids in the meat mixture - much easier than it sounds).   

I also add in some grated parmesan or other hard dry cheese to the meat mixture.  

Last, after I am done mixing, I test by making a little meat patty and fry it.  (Thanks again to Chef Burrell for that idea too!)  If it tastes good, the seasoning is right.  If it needs more of anything (usually salt), then I add more and test it again.  Then I form all the meatballs and put them in the oven.  

I LOVE that these meatballs only need baking and you don't have to fry them all and then bake them.

Excellent! I cook these in the pot of sauce for two hours, makes them extra juicy and no added fat. I added two tablespoons of Italian seasoning and four chopped garlic cloves, I need a lot of flavor :)

Needs to be spiced up.  Using plain bread crumbs, add 1/2 t. sage, 1/2 t. oregano, 1/2 t. basil, 2 T. parmesan cheese, 1/4 t. garlic powder, salt and pepper.

Other than it needing a strong hit of salt, this is a great way to get meatballs on the table in a fairly quick manner.

5 stars for the ease of this recipe.  But nothing outstanding.  A lot of the reviews are giving 5 stars, but they are adding parm. cheese and other ingredients.  So really don't understand why they give 5 stars when they are changing the recipe?

This is a great base recipe for meatballs.  You need to add spices!  I used garlic, Italian seasoning, seasoned salt, pepper and fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  They were a hit with added flavor.  We made 'spaghetti and meatballs' for dinner and the boyfriend and his buddy had no idea it was made with Turkey!  Will make again.  And I cooked my meatballs for 30 minutes...just to be sure they were fully done, I always have to be sure.

I only had 16 oz. package of ground turkey, so I added 4 oz. of ground sage sausage. I always mixed in about 1/4 cup of freshly grated asiago/romano cheese in with the meat before cooking. Placed in a slower cooker on low for 3 hours with the Spaghetti with marinara sauce recipe.

I really love this recipe.  I always bake my meatballs...it is less messy and I don't feel compelled to stand over the meatballs while they cook due to fear of them burning.  Plus, I think that they cook more uniformly.  I did use ground beef rather than turkey so I omitted the olive oil and I added 1/4 c. of milk as well as a dash of pepper, salt and worstershire.  Thanks ANASTASIAJANE!

I made the following changes based on past reviews(these changes are the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five.):
I cooked them ten minutes per side and they were not dry at all. I added onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  These were a huge hit and super easy.  My beef loving husband loved them even though they were turkey meat, wants me to make them again.

This is a keeper for me!  I was so tired of browning meatballs in a skillet and having a greasy mess to clean up. I used ground beef for this and it turned out great!  Very little time required in preparation and easy clean up...and they tasted great too!

This is a great starter recipe to customize to your taste buds preferences. I recommend adding a little salt, garlic powder or onion powder since it, whichever you like. Also, I like the roll out method where you roll the mix out flat into a square shape, let it harden in the fridge for about a half hour and then cut into cubes. This makes shaping them into balls so much easier.

These go together very fast, and they taste good. The turkey brings a much different texture, which was a nice change, however not a total replacement for traditional meatballs (in my family, at least). I've made them several times, and my family enjoys them. I now add garlic, and other seasonings to suit my family's tastes, but just as written, they are moist, and my go-to quick meatball recipe.

Delicious! I give them five stars with added parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, and ground oregano. I had the mix ready before the oven preheated! I love the idea of using the ice cream scoop. You get uiform meatballs without getting your hands messy. Clean-up was a breeze. I highly recommend these! Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy.  I left out the olive oil.  I added italian seasoning to my plain breadcrumbs and added parsley, parm cheese, and red pepper flakes to the meatballs.  After baking, I threw it in a crockpot with a jar of spaghetti sauce.  YUM!

Very awesome base recipe! Made about 25 of these little suckers because I rolled mine into smaller meatballs. Used turkey instead of beef (I never use beef, but if you do use turkey make sure it's NOT 99%) and turned out wonderful. My sister took the whole tupperware of my meatballs to work before I woke up. Note to self: store in the corner of the fridge behind milk so I can have lunch the next day.

This was excellent, and my family who usually frowns upon ground turkey ate every last meatball.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 6 plus a guest.  I used just the egg whites, a splash of water, salt, pepper, plain bread crumbs, and I added Italian seasoning.  Cooked them as the recipe states, and then added some to BBQ Sauce and others to marinara and then make meatball sandwiches with them.  The meal was a huge hit, and had "must make again" comments from the kids.

First of all, it's kind of annoying when someone reviews a recipe and states that it's "delicious" when they mention in their review that they added this or that.  That being said, this recipe "AS IS", is o.k., too bland for my tastes.  I added basil, oregano, parmesan cheese, and water for a more flavorful recipe.

As written, these would be very bland.  I substituted Johnsonville mild Italian ground sausage instead of the turkey and they are phenomenal.  If I was to make these with ground turkey, I would definitely add some salt, pepper, and at least a little garlic and oregano.

I didn't have any bread crumbs, used Stove Top stuffing mix instead. They turned out great, kids loved them.  I make a double batch and freeze the leftovers to pull out as needed.

This recipe is fast and friendly, but also a little bland.  Try adding some balsalmic vinegar and worchestershire sauce.  Adds so much flavor!

Quick and easy! Used 2 pounds of beef and froze extras for later. Added some parsley, garlic powder, onion powder and parmesan cheese.

A solid recipe - formed well and cooked well but very flavorless as is.  Definitely want to mix it up and add a variety of seasonings/spices.

These were delicious and simple.  My 8-year old made them himself.  We didn't have Italian bread crumbs so he toasted a couple of slices of bread to crumble and added Italian seasoning.

This was my 1st meatball attempt, and I really liked using turkey instead of beef--much healthier.  I halved the recipe and added 1/4 c of Parm cheese.  I also made these into bite sized meatballs and ended up with about 25 for half of the recipe.

These just came out of the oven and they are delicious!  But I'm only giving them 4 stars because I made so many changes to the recipe.  I added 2 tbsp parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp sage, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder and salt and pepper to taste.  I can't wait to see how they reheat later with some marinara and whole wheat spaghetti.

This has the potential of 5 stars!! I added 1/2 tsp. sage, 2 Tbsp. of grated parmesan, pinch of onion and garlic powder like the other reviewers noted, but no water - it didn't need it.....it was almost perfect.  I think I'll try 1/4 tsp of onion and garlic powder next time....it needed more of a kick. It was done perfectly at 20 mins.

As written 3 stars but with these changes 5 stars.  First, I added dash of onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper.  Then with olive oil, I pan fried the meatballs on all sides until brown.  Then I added the meatballs to my spaghetti sauce and simmered for 15 minutes.  This was so good!

This recipe is a great starting point for whatever you want to do!  I had some Italian-spiced ground turkey that I used, so I just put some salt and pepper and onion salt in, plus parmesan cheese.  It was fantastic!  This recipe can easily be adapted for all kinds of meatballs too!

These are super-easy!  I seasoned with minced onion, garlic powder, oregano and parsley, and used panko whole wheat bread crumbs.  I will season a bit more next time, but the overall result was very good.

These are the only meatballs I make!  I've made these countless times in the past few months.   I took previous reviewers' advice and I always add a couple of shakes of garlic powder & grated Parmesan cheese into the mixture.  Sometimes I also throw in a pinch of salt & ground pepper if I remember.  While I'm mixing them, if I find it to be too "meaty" I throw in more cheese, breadcrumbs & garlic powder.  The rest of the cooking steps I follow exactly and they come out great every time.  These also freeze nicely & are great to have on hand when throwing together a quick spaghetti supper.

Just what I wanted! A simple, straightforward recipe that can easily be added to in order to personalize. I added loads of herbs, minced onion and garlic, and salt. My husband, a guest and I ate it up. Thank you for this recipe!

I doubled the recipe and froze half.  My husband took left overs for lunch and the ladies at work wanted the recipe.  First meal ate in our spaghetti, 2nd meal did open face meatball sandwiches with homemade spaghetti sauce.  My girls ate without complaint!  Will be making and freezing these again!

As is, these recipes are good for a two year old.  Additional spices like kosher salt, black pepper, oregano, and basil, make them taste good.

Hands down the best meatball recipe out there! It is quick and easy. We typically add extra onion and use turkey meat, instead of beef. JennieO has a good ground turkey with Italian seasonings. We've been using this recipe since I became a user of the site, back in 2007. And I believe the very 1st recipe I ever used off the site, hands down this is a keeper and will continue to be in our family.

These were so easy to make, and most importantly, they are delicious! These were a hit with the family. I will be making these again soon. I served them with spaghetti, but I think these would be perfect in meatball subs!

Like so many others, I "doctored" this up....but it's still a great basic meatball recipe.  I like that it's so fast and can be oven baked while the pasta cooks and sauce warms (okay, so I didn't make that from scratch today!).  Makes a quick meal that way.

I'm rating it 5 stars for a terrific base recipe. We used this recipe for some very hearty, flavorful meatball subs! I added the following: onion powder, 3 cloves of garlic, sage, oregano, salt. Made 36 mini-meatballs, baked for 20 minutes, broiled for 5 minutes. I then made some homemade marinara. Then just pile the meatballs into a french roll, top with marinara, and some mozzarella. Put underneath the broiler for 4 minutes. The entire family loved it. This is the best part - we spent about $3.50 to make 6 big meatball subs that were so much better than a restaurant's.

These were really easy to make, especially for someone who's never made meatballs before! I really wanted to give this all five stars, but you definitely need seasoning. I used bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and Parmesan cheese. I also mixed a table spoon of oil in with the mixture, helped it stay moist.

Really good meatballs, and healthier than most.  Quick and easy.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Only changes were adding some seasoning- oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, parmesan.  Make a nice difference!

Delicious! Sounded bland so I added a few dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, parm cheese & garlic garlic from Tastefully Simple. Also made the meatballs larger than an ice cream scoop so they needed to cook about 45 minutes instead of 20. SUPER quick & easy...really moist & tasty. Thank u!

I agree that these are very easy to make. I lined the pan with foil for easy clean up. I used a pork and ground beef mix instead of turkey and added some fennel seeds and italian spices. They came out crispy on the outside and tender inside. Good!

This is a great recipe! It's simple but I use it as the base to making my meatballs. I can dress them up anyway I want from this starting point. To give it a kick, I sometime ground up a hot pepper and a few garlic cloves to add to the mix and throw in some curry powder. OR for a version that goes great with pasta, I add some sage, fresh parsley, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of black pepper.

I just made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS! It was my first time ever making meatballs. I used 99% fat free Jenny O ground turkey instead of the 7% fat ground turkey. I'm not sure why someone would think 7% fat is required. I always opt to pay a little more for the healthier version of everything. I always read quite a few reviews for a recipe before I attempt to make it so I can take not of any suggestions or changes. I added italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, a sprinkle of pepper, no added salt because there's already enough in the turkey, and 1/4 cup water. The tip on adding that little bit of water was very helpful. The meatballs came out very flavorful and extremely moist! Everything these days from ready-prepared foods (frozen dinners, canned foods), to restaurants and fast food, is overloaded with salt and people seem to be ignorant to their intake of salt more than fat and cholesterol. All 3 are important to watch. I always keep recipes as healthy as possible by reducing oils, butter, salt, etc and the recipe still results in good food. I almost never eat beef and I don't eat pork. I only eat chicken and turkey so this was not a big change for me. I loved this recipe and will be adding it to my 'recipe book'.

It was really nice to make meatballs without having to pan fry them! My turkey came in a 1.5 lb package so I had to use two pans and I increased the breadcrumbs to  1/2 cup.  I added a couple tablespoons Parmesan a teaspoon garlic powder and even though my breadcrumbs were Italian flavor I added some basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning (1 teaspoon each).  I was worried that there wasn't any salt in the recipe, so I added a tablespoon or Worcestershire sauce for the added salt and flavor.  They came out perfect!

Wow, I really loved these!!  I didn't think they'd be that exciting but they were great.  I added about 1-2 TBS. of water to the mix.  I'm squeamish, so I didn't like mixing it with my hands but you don't have to do it very long at all- just get everything incorportated.  Then I used my cookie scoop to form the meatballs.  I had to use a 9x13 and a 8x8 pan.  When I turned them over, I salted them lightly.  They were done in the time stated (used my meat thermometer).  We had these with Chunky Marinara sauce, from this site, and whole wheat angel hair and steamed broccoli.  The whole family loved them.  I'll be making these again, I'm sure.

Great recipe but I did add garlic salt and parmesan cheese to the mixture.  I also made them at least twice as big, baked them for 5 extra minutes then dropped them into a simmering pot of sauce for 1/2 hour.  Delicious!

These are not your Italian grandmother's meatballs, but they are fast, friendly, and darn good!  Because I think ground turkey can be dry, I added water to the seasoned bread crumbs, along with some Italian seasoning and freshly grated pecorino romano cheese.  My family loved these moist and tasty meatballs, and I will definitely make them again!

I made a couple of changes and they (still) came out great!  I used a pound of ground sirloin and kept the other ingredients, but then also added a little garlic powder, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and minced dried onions.  I formed them by hand and they came out moist and flavorful!  These are very close to how my mom used to make meatballs - thanks for the help and great recipe!

Yum! Deeelish & made the autumn house smell so good!
I used 7% fat ground turkey & added the following to the base recipe:
2 tsp sage
2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp McCormick Grill Master Montreal Chicken spice mix (just had it around - salt, pepper, onion, & such - seemed right)
scant 1/4 c grated fresh parmesan
We ate ours with spicy tomato & red pepper sauce on spaghetti noodles. SERIOUSLY tasty & satisfying for the whole family. Try it!

This is a great base, but the meatballs desperately need more seasoning. I used Italian Seasoning, minced garlic and onion, as well as Parmesan cheese. They were absolutely delicious.

I find that turkey meatballs turn out better if bread moistened with milk is substituted for the bread crumbs. Not quite so dense. Rachel Ray's "Florentine Meatballs" is a great, very flavorful variation on this recipe.

Tasty and easy to make. I always thought meatballs were a hassle.   But making them in the oven was as stroke of genius.  The only thing I changed was making my own seasoned bread crumbs.  I save the butts of any breads we have and freeze them for later use.  I had rye and wheat and seasoned with Italain seasoning with the Parmesan Cheese in the green tin. I simmered them in the marinara sauce until hubby was ready for dinner.  They were moist and tasty - even the next day.  Now my 12-year old son wants turkey meatball subs.  These are so much better than the pre-made frozen meatballs. Thanks for sharing.

This is a simple and fun recipe. My daughter had a lot of fun making them! It's similar to how my mom made meatloaf, which I always liked! Using 77% lean ground beef, so hoping they turn out. Even if they fall apart it's ok!

Excellent recipe that is easy and kids will love!  2nd time making it and my picky lil eatters just gobbled it up- no pun intended :-)

Only changes I made was that I used italian seasoned turkey meat and added a little bit of garlic salt, onion powder and pepper.

This was a great, easy, first timer's recipe for meatballs! As many others said you do need to doctor them up a little bit, which I would definitely do next time. It also took about 30 mins cooking time, plus 5 mins broiling them for them to be cooked thru, but I also made them pretty big. All in all a good beginners recipe!

I made this for my family last night and everyone loved  it.  I only gave it 4 stars because I tweaked it by adding minced garlic, basil, and grated parmesan to the mixture.  This recipe is a keeper.  ;-)

Good meatballs...for turkey.  I only had 99% lean on hand so I added about a Tblsp of olive oil and 2 Tblsp grated parm-reggiano cheese to add fat. To tart them up added salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, chopped parsley, some pesto and a pinch of crushed pepper.  I also pan sauteed them after the recommended time in the oven (3 min each side med-high) because I like a my meatballs to have a bit of crust.
I'll try these again with the recommended 93% fat instead.

I have made these as written and they are good, but they are better with some changes.  Most times when I make them I double the recipe and freeze some.  When I do that, I usually use 20 ounces of ground turkey and 20 ounces(ish) of meatball mixture.  I also add 1/3 cup or more of parmesan cheese.  Lastly, I add two cloves of garlic.

Good, basic meatballs. They are  a little bland so you will need to spice them up a bit, but overall a pretty good.

These were definitely fast to throw together but they definitely need some spices to spruce them up. I added some Montreal Steak seasoning, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan Cheese and they were still bland. The oven idea is slick, but they do come out a little on the "beige" side compare to pan-fry them.  Which is ok, if you put them in sauce, which I did for a couple of hours on low.  These have a much better texture than the store bought ones I have had. Will probably make again, but with lots more spice and maybe even some red pepper flakes for a kick. I only wrote down the ingredient list and then made the recipe. So I accidentally added the oil to the meatballs and didn't warm the pan in the oven. I think that is probably why these came out nice and moist. :)

Excellent base recipe!  I followed others and added parmesan cheese, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Often ground turkey has a distinct turkey flavor, but these just taste like great meatballs!  I simmered with a jar of pasta sauce after baking.

Very fast and easy to make, I had 99% fat free turkey and I took the suggestion below of adding a little bit of EVOO to the meat. I also added minced garlic and grill mate , the boys I watch loved them (one of them hates ground turkey). Thank you for all the great recipe and suggestions.

I use this recipe regularly.  Fast and easy.  I now use it with ground Italian sausage, which I once bought by mistake.  It's so flavorful.  These meatballs actually brown in the oven and clean up is much easier than browning them on the stove top.  Thanks for this recipe!

Easy, moist, and fairly delicious. Next time I will add a lot more seasoning, and some salt. It was a great way to use the only meat left in the house... ground turkey.

This is possibly the worst recipe I have ever made. It made me wonder if there was something wrong with my ground turkey meat. The flavor and smell were disturbing and could not be blocked out by the tomato sauce; dousing them with soy sauce toned down the exceptional gaminess/stank of the turkey meat, but all in all, it was a waste of ground meat.

4 stars for simplicity, it would be 5 but they would be bland if prepared as written.  I added a lot of italian seasonings and Mrs. Dash...still needed some salt after they were done.  Served with jar tomato sauce and a salad-easy fast dinner that pleased the husband and 5-year-old too :-)

My star rating is with the addition of spices to taste. As written the recipe is rather bland. We add minced onions and garlic, plus some extra italian and hamburger seasonings. We love that the recipe is quick and they cook up quick. They go straight from oven to sauce to tummies at our house, but we think they would store well if there were ever any leftovers.

What a great base recipe. I'm so tired of meatballs that are so silky that there's absolutely no meat texture left. This is perfect, and the turkey tastes great. I ended up adding about 1/2 to 2/3 of an onion, diced, which adds great flavor to the meatballs. The cooking time is perfect, too. The meatballs don't really brown in the oven, even with the preheated pan, but cover them in sauce and no one can tell anyway.

Not bad for a very basic recipe.  It didn't quite have that classic meatball taste though.  Next time I'll add fennel to get that flavor.   I didn't have turkey on hand, so I used beef, and I only had plain breadcrumbs, so I added my own italian seasonings into it.

SO awesome! I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs so I just added a tblsp of Italian seasonings. I also added a tblsp of grated parmesan. I served these with just a sauce made of canned crushed tomatoes and worstishire sauce (1 tblsp) and steamed artichokes, DELICIOUS! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Easy base recipe, was capable of remaining in my ADHD-addled mind the entire time without needing a hardcopy to refer to. Can be modified to fit any palate depending on how you like your food spiced (grated habanero for some, fresh basil for others). Will be making these again!

So simple, easy to whip together in minutes!  I did add some garlic powder, and after they were up to 165, put them under the broiler to crisp them up.  It was a little too plain for my hubby, who's a picky eater, so I may end up adding extra spices next time. Very good overall!

These were great! My husband, who hates everything, actually had seconds, and the kids liked them too. I had plain breadcrumbs so I added 1/4 teaspoon of sage, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 garlic powder. I am a vegetarian (family is not) so I don't know how well seasoned they were, but my family likes plain things. Thanks for the recipe!

Just as everyone else is saying, this is an awesome basic recipe. I made my own bread crumbs and added parmesan cheese, Garlic & Herb Mrs. Dash, garlic powder, salt and pepper - they're amazing!!! However, they took well over 20 minutes to reach the safe 165F. I think mine took about 35 minutes.

I found these to be dry and bland.  The blandness can be taken care of by adding spices of your choosing, but it is more of a starting point than a go to recipe.

I made these with ground turkey and they were great - You could do bigger portions and turn them into meatloaf too- freeze and double the cooking time and you can put them from freezer to oven.

THIS WAS THE BEST! I made some additions...added grated parmesean, italian seasoning, black pepper, sea salt, chopped onions, minced garlic, onion powder, garlic salt...baked as said, then put into the spaghetti sauce, simmered on low till ready to eat. IT WAS SO GOOD. Making meatball subs for lunch! Hubby says better than Macaroni Grill! :)

Yum yum yum!  So good!  I use Italian style panko breadcrumbs (which are dairy free) when making these and I add a little oregano and thyme and they're so good and so easy too!  I will never buy frozen meatballs again, since I can make these easy, delicious meatballs!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used 93% beef instead of turkey - I did add minced garlic, italian seasoning (I used plain bread crumbs -I like to seaon things myself), salt and pepper...and they were the 'bomb' as my teenage son put it.  I also omitted the oil and preheating of dish...I just lined a cookie sheet with foil and sprayed with cooking spray.

This is my favorite recipe for meatballs because it is SO simple. I have also used the extra lean ground beef in place of ground turkey with excellent results. In my opinion, it actually tastes better. Also, I don't typically have Italian seasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I just use plain bread crumbs and season with an Italian seasoning blend (basil, rosemary, etc.). I don't preheat the baking dish either. I just pop these on a foil-covered baking sheet that I spray with non-stick cooking spray. The meatballs turn out just fine and clean up is a breeze.

I added some parmigiana cheese and since I did not have seasoned bread crumbs, I added garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and oregano. These were delicious. After baking, I simmered them in sauce for a bit before serving over spaghetti. This was a real hit!

these are wonderful! i have been searching for a simple meatball recipe - no weird ingredients or sauces, just plain old good meatballs that are homemade instead of buying them frozen.  and at long last, these are it! i one-and-a-halfed the recipe, using two thirds ground turkey and one third ground beef, and otherwise followed it exactly.  i ended up with 40 tiny meatballs that i cooked for a total of 18 mins which was perfect. i plan to use them tomorrow night in the "meatball soup" recipe from this site. yummy!

Great easy recipe, we use ground turkey every chance we can but instead of all the carbs in the bread crumbs, swap them out for quick cooking oatmeal and some italian seasoning.  I also add diced onion and garlic.  Easy!

I love this recipe and make it all the time.. I think I already gave it 5 stars but what the heck..It is so easy.  It is almost as easy as crumbling for spaghetti and the kids thinks it so much more special to get spaghetti and meatballs rather than plan old spaghetti! :)

The only change I made to this is to add some grated Parmesan cheese, which made them even better! In the last few minutes in the oven, I put spaghetti sauce over them and then served it with pasta. Yummy!

Good basic recipe with a lot of room for addition to make them unique and even better. I used plain breadcrumbs, italian seasonings, parmesan cheese, garlic salt, fresh pepper, parsley, and some diced onion. Cooked as directed and then simmered with canned sauce for an easy Spaghetti and Meatballs.

I love this meatball recipe. I have made it several times and used it with pasta and also for meatball sub sandwiches. I tend to add chopped onion into the mix of my meatballs, and they always turn out great.

This was a basic meatball recipe that has alot of versatility. I used Jennie-O lean italian seasoned turkey breast which didn't need alot of extra seasonings. I did add garlic, onion powder, bread crumbs, parmesean cheese & italian parsley just because. I cooked in the oven for about 15 mins, then added to my crockpot(low setting) with my own spaghetti sauce. We were having spaghetti & meatballs for dinner. It was wonderful & my picky husband never realized he was eating turkey instead of ground beef.

I followed the directions exactly.  After the meatballs were cooked I put them in a mixture of bbq sauce (Baby Rays is the best) and chicken broth.  I let them simmer on med-low heat for 25-30 minutes.

I followed the suggestions of another reviewer SandraM (Oct 8/2006) and these were YUMMY!!!!!!! This is super easy to throw together and I liked browning them in the oven rather than on top of the stove. This is one of my top recipes for meatballs and was a sneaky way of getting my hubby to eat ground turkey. This is a MUST TRY recipe.

I, too, used the ground beef, pork, veal mixture because I had it on hand.  I added some more parsley, Italian Seasoning, and some gsrlic.

So easy to make.  I got my 13 yr. old son to help me.  He will likely prepare them himself next time.  They come together quickly.  Moist and Tasty!  I will make them again!

These were good once some seasoning was added. I added about a tblsp. of basic italian seasoning and then half of a lipton onion soup mix packet and a couple of teaspoons garlic powder. Turkey is just to bland without some sort of seasoning.

Made for the second time. I added some mozzarella cheese because I didn't have parmesan. As is I give 3 stars. With the cheese added I would give 4.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! I added the following to the recipe: oregano, basil, minced garlic.  I cooked a little longer than recipe calls for (to make them slightly browned).  My 2 year old son had SEVERAL! Definitely will make them again soon :)

Really good meatballs, these were healthy and easy to make.I am giving it 4 stars because I had to add some extra spices otherwise these would have turned out bland. The turkey I bought was an italian seasoned ground turkey so it had a sausage taste to it. I added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, parmesan cheese, a tad of balsamic vinegar as I read on one of the reviews and 3/4 teaspoon of basil. The kids really, really like them.

These were very easy to make and tasted good with our spagetti.  I was afraid they would be a little bland so I added some worchteshire sauce, diced onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.  And it helped.  I would double the recipe if you plan on freezing them.  Our family of 3 didn't leave much left for freezing or saving for later.

I have been working long hours and commuting 2 hrs/day this fall and these meatballs have become my best friend!  Quick, easy, and I double them for leftover spaghetti and meatballs all week. I add a tbsp or so of balsamic vinegar (trick I got from a turkey meatloaf recipe) to keep the turkey moist. I also have mixed in some minced garlic for flavor. I add some different veggies to the marinara sauce each night and I have a new meal!

I rated this a 5 because of the ease to make theses meatballs. I did add an envelope and 1/2 of another of Lipton Onion soup mix (garlic and herb- beefy onion would probably be great too). Otherwise this is just too bland. Turkey has WAY less flavor than beef. I also added 1/4 of finely chopped onion and 1 tsp of minced gaarlic in the mixx. Smells great while baking.

These meatballs were so easy! I did make a few changes though. Like most everyone I added parmesan and a little garlic. Also, for you North Westerners out there, I added the end of a bag of Tim's Cascade Jalepeno Chips that I crushed thoroughly. It gave the meatballs a nice kick!

Granted I used 99% fat free turkey, those were a little too tough for my taste. I added a LOT of seasoning to these as turkey is bland to start with. will make again but with more breadcrumbs and even more seasoning.

These are so simple that I make them all of the time now for my family.  To be quite frank, however, I think they need to be seasoned.  I add salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder.  Otherwise they are pretty bland for my taste.  We also double the recipe since everyone always wants more.

This is a really good recipe for meatballs. They were a hit. I followed the recipe except I used hamburger meat instead of turkey though, and did add some garlic salt. I used them to make spaghetti and meatballs. I will be making these again.

I am so tired of reviewers using the term "bland" so I won't use that term, but these meatballs are about as "tasteless" and "boring" as any I have ever eaten. There isn't enough seasoning in 1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs to enhance the flavor. Needs salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley... some of the above or all of the above. Too many "Great" meatball recipes out there that are worthy of your time and money!

I added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the recipe, and the meatballs turned out great.   Quick, easy, tasty, healthy recipe!

Super easy and pretty tasty. Made as directed except plain breadcrumbs with 1 tsp dry Italian seasoning.  Next time would add extra garlic.  Consider cooking at higher temp for crispier outside.

I needed to make this gluten free so I substituted equal parts flax meal for the bread crumbs, and I used ground beef instead of turkey.  I quintupled this recipe in order to freeze the meatballs and have quick, grab-and-go dinners.  I kept the ratios the same per pound of meat.  I also added 1 T. per pound of dried onion and salt-free seasoning mix, given I was using flax meal instead of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  I followed the suggestion to use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs.  I ended up cooking the meatballs for 40 minutes, or until their internal temps were 130 degrees.  Not sure if I needed longer than suggested because I was using ground beef, or perhaps because I'm cooking at higher altitudes (in Colo.).  For 5 pounds of ground beef and all of the other ingredients, I ended up with 41 meatballs.  I froze the meatballs by putting them spaced out on a cookie sheet until they were frozen solid, then transferring them to freezer bags.

Really enjoyed this. Good comfort food. Served with mashed potatoes and peas, no sauce needed.

My turkey was still somewhat soggy from defrosting so I am thinking the wonderful moistness was a result but it could be the recipe, (ground turkey can easily be dry).  I also took the advice of a reveiewer who added parmesan, sage, garlic & onion salt.  Will add to the rotation!

Nice and simple way to make meatballs! I made them for just my husband and I, so I decided to make only a dozen meatballs. I used: 1 Tbs. of olive oil, 1 egg, 1/2 pkg (20 oz.) of ground turkey, 3 Tbs. of Italian seasoned bread crumbs (Progresso), and then added some ingredients of my own: ~ 1/2 Tsp. of salt, cracked pepper, and oregano, and ~1 and 1/2 Tbs. of shredded parmesan cheese. Absolutely delicious! We were very pleased!

Love it! So easy, fast and yummy. I change it up sometimes; use garlic oil, Cajun seasoning, turmeric, truffle salt, etc...not all that at the same time of course. Thank you for sharing. Definitely one of my favorite go-to recipe.

Original recipe made it exactly as written, it was bland. Really, it was bland and has that hint of turkey essence taste. I would make this recipe again, but by adding spices as other reviewers suggested. Adding other spices as other reviewer suggested is a must. I didn't want to waste what I just made, so I cut up those meatballs in quarters & a few in eights, simmered them in our favorite marinara for an hour or so that it would soak up the sauce and served it with pasta.

Made this tonight.  To say it was a hit is an understatement.  The meatballs came out light and tasty.  I added a few squirts of worcestershire sauce, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder  (I'm sure it didn't need all that, but I can't help dressing recipes up!).  This is a solid basic recipe, I will make again.  Thank you, AnastasiaJane!

I tried this recipe yesterday and it's truly as it's name suggests. Fast & Friendly. I'm from the Caribbean and I guess you can say we cook with a lot of species. I added our blended seasons with a fig of garlic and a dash of thyme and crushed red pepper.  This recipe is awesome. Deserve more that 5***** in my book. Would be adding to my recipe book.

This was so easy!!! My ten year old daughter and her friend loved the meatballs. I used 94% lean ground beef instead of ground turkey. I made the meatballs and then served them with spaghetti and Emerils marinara sauce!! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND SOOO EASY!!!

Have made these several times.  They are really good.  I do use ground turkey and last time I made them, threw in quite a bit of fresh chopped parsley, just 'cause I had it to use up.  They were wonderful.  I mean, when there were only two meatballs left the next day, there was a discussion around the table about cutting them into halves so everyone could get half of a meatball.  That should tell you how tasty they are.  One word of caution:  don't overcook meatballs.  Pull them out of the oven when they are 'just done'. That way, they are nice and tender.

I would rate this even lower as a finished recipe, but I'm  going to be generous and give it three as a good base. You MUST add some herbs to this for flavor (I used basil and a bit of oregano and some ground black pepper). I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic and half an onion, very finely diced. I upped the parmesan cheese as well. I used my hands to mix it and to form it into balls. I baked them approximately 30 minutes, but did not turn them. It's really not necessary and a waste of time and energy for no gain. With these modifications, the recipe turned out great - 5 stars for sure! I tripled the recipe, used some right away and put the rest into the freezer for future use.

Good recipe, the best part is it's simplicity.......for which I give it a 5. However the flavor is rather bland and definately needs the addition of some Italian based spices to add to the overall flavor which I gave a 3. I also, made my own bread crumbs. Buying pre-made bread crumbs is rather ridiculous. Not a bad meatball though!

These might be kid friendly and quick to make, but tastewise, they are anything but (sorry!). Of all the meatball recipes I've tried (and I've tried a LOT!), these are my LEAST favorite. :( Not only were my MB's DRY, they were VERY, VERY dense. I even used 7% fat turkey.... If you enjoy heavy, dense MB's, these will not doubt be right up your alley. I don't, so they did nothing for me. As many others did, I too added a considerable amount of spice to my MB mixture. Heeding SandraM's advice, I added 1/2 t dried sage and 2 T grated Parmesan cheese (from a can). I then added a blend of MY own favorite spices - 1/2 t each of garlic / onion powders, salt (1 t) and pepper (1/4 t). I baked my MB's as directed, but none of them crisped up as I thought they would. Served with spaghetti, marinara sauce, garlic bread and spumoni ice cream for dessert. I'm sorry to report, I won't be making these again. All of my leftovers went into the garbage. Maybe these will float your boat, but they didn't mine. Thanks anyways, ANASTASIAJANE.

Really good and easy recipe. I added chopped garlic, oregano and chopped parsley. Instead of baking them, I put them straight to the frying pan after covering them with some flour,  in medium heat. Tasted delicious!

Amazing recipe!!! I used ground chicken instead of ground turkey and I added a lot of stuff. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs with a seasoning combination of onion powder, oregano, Cajun seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic salt (California blend), Mrs. dash, garlic powder and creole! i only used a little of each though lol....my boyfriend loved them on top of my whole wheat spaghetti!!! I cant wait to make this recipe again, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

These meatballs were super easy and fast, this is very true.  But we found them really flavorless.  Maybe we just had a bad sauce, but we won't be trying them again.  Sorry!

Excellent starter kit for meatballs.  I threw in some diced onion, garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper, and a little Worcestershire sauce. The variations are endless. My whole household looks forward to when I make them again.

a GREAT recipe! I was running late and had some ground turkey. I tried this recipe and am so happy, my husband and 2 year old really liked them. I didn't have italian seasoning on hand so I just added some dried basil/oregano/garlic powder to my plain bread crumbs. The meatballs were tasty and moist (my turkey did have 7% fat). I made rice and a frozen bag of veggies and it was a quick and easy dinner. I will be making these again and freezing some. They are nice plain, but I can't wait to drop them in some spaghetti sauce!

These were EXCELLENT!! Very versitle...I added oregano, garlic, salt and pepper and poultry seasoning.  I froze them, after baking, and when I reheated, I cooked them in homemeade bbq sauce.  The leftover meatballs went into spaghetti the next day! REally good...lots of compliments!!

this was a good and fast recipe to make.  the only problem is it seemed a bit "bland" so i added spices (barbeque sauce, etc) into the mix before baking.

excellent recipe.  easy.

This was literally my first time making meatballs ever - for that reason, I decided to use this recipe, as it'd be simple enough. The process was very easy to follow, and my meatballs came out as they were supposed to be. However, my only problem with this recipe is that it doesn't explain how to add more flavor to the meat. The meatballs were quite bland, despite my attempts to modify this recipe. What I did was add mozzarella cheese, garlic powder, oregano leaves, and various spices. Then I also baked the meatballs in pizza/spaghetti sauce. I will have to try different things next time to see if I can add more flavor to the meat. I still rated this recipe 3 stars, though, because it IS a good start for inexperienced cookers or any lazy college students. You just have to add on to it if you want your meatballs to turn out absolutely savory or great.

Used pork-veal-beef (1 lb. each)-- Maybe 1/2 lb of pork for a less pork flavor.
Used crushed stuffing cubes plus the season packet.
Added rosemay, garlic and onion salt, and 6 tbspof grated parmesan

I thought this was only average. I followed the recipe exactly and found the meatballs had no flavor.  The bread preparation was good but that's about it.

When I went to take my turkey out of the freezer to thaw to make these, I noticed that it was the super lean kind.  Decided to go ahead and try the recipe, and it worked beautifully for me.  I followed the instructions exactly, and they came out of the oven slightly brown and crisp.  I then simmered these in a pot with a little store bought pasta sauce and served over tri-colored rotini pasta.  My husband, who had originally turned his nose up to not having beef meatballs, loved these and took the leftovers as a meatball sandwich today.

I liked this recipe because it was basic and gave you the freedom to customize it. I added chopped onion and bellpepper. I also added chopped frozen spinach. We rolled them with a cube of matzarella in the middle. YuMmO!

These were fabulous meatballs. Cooking them in the olive oil gives the outside a perfect crispness.  Both of my kids enjoyed them and they are a keeper!  My kids like to eat these with tomato sauce as a meal and skip the spaghetti. I can't blame them!

I agree with one of the comments.  This is a good foundation for meatballs.  This recipe definitely needs to be seasoned to your liking, but it is a good start if you have never made meatballs or if you were a little rusty like I was when I looked up how to make them to refresh my memory.  I would make this simple recipe again.  It was a big hit with my kids.

You CAN use 99% lean turkey - I did! I took 1 TBSP EVOO and added it to the mix, and then used cooking spray to coat the pan with - came out delicious and healthy!

Delicious.. but I added garlic and onion powder; Italian seasoning,PESTO mmmmm. crushed red pepper,bayleaf, black pepper and sugar. I baked half and fried the other half and added both batches to my sauce. Overall, you taught me how to make an easy meatball and my 2.5 year old helped! Thank You

Easy, fast and with a lot more flavor than you'd expect.  I used EVOO and Vigo Italian breadcrumbs.   If you're concerned about all the sodium in the breadcrumbs, make smaller meatballs.

Awesome.  I like a bit more flavor so I add a package of Feta cheese chunks and some of my favorite seasonings.  Also figured out a quick and easy way to bake meatballs.  I just scoop them up with a melon baller and plop them into a mini muffin tin (greased of course), try to make them a bit big so they don't sit on the bottom and the grease runs out to make them even healthier.  Perfect cute meatballs are the result.  Just be careful not to overcook or they will become dry but still tasty!

These were good, everyone ate them which is saying a lot! I added sage, onion powder, garlic powder & used Italian breadcrumbs. I will make them again for sure, I would like to try freezing them to make for an even easier week night dinner.

Very easy to make and they came out juicy, not dry.  It needed a little bit of salt and a little flavor, though, but it is a great base.  Next time I'll add some parmesan cheese and garlic.

I used crushed cheetos instead of bread crumbs because I was trying to get my kids to eat them. They loved them! I added a splash of beef broth and olive oil to the meat because I was worried they wouldn't be moist enough. They turned out awesome. Can't wait to make them again for the grown ups!

This is a wonderful recipe. I added garlic powder and parmesan cheese. I took longer than only 20 min in the oven, but I may be because the meat balls were big. I ate with spaguetti and tomato sauce. Wonderful. Thanks!!!!

Love how simple these are to make and how tasty they come out. I've tried many turkey meatball recipes and this one is the winner and the one I always come back to. The only thing I add is about a 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Delicious!

This basic recipe can be turned into a very tasty meatball!  Keep it 'as is' for kids or those who do not want a lot of extra flavor, but incorporate suggestions from other reviewers to make them unforgettable!  Next time I might add a bit of cumin, just to see what happens.

These meatballs were easy and delicious.  I added a little bit of onion and garlic to them when I mixed them up for more flavor.  After they were done baking, I tossed them in my crock pot with the sauce and let it simmer for awhile.  Delicious! :)

I added parmezan cheese and onion powder and garlic salt to this recipe and still it is missing flavor. Thanks for the recipe but it does need a little help in my opinion. Also my baking time was a little longer.

I just made these meatballs this morning and they are super moist and delicious! I only made 15 though, so my cooking time was slightly longer. I also took the suggestions of previous posters and added one minced clove of garlic, a bit of chopped onion, some parmesan cheese, and a sprinkling of italian seasoning. So yummy!

Fast and kid-friendly, as advertised.  I did add some seasoning salt that contained onion and garlic; I think the recipe would have been bland without it.  Next time I will try adding some shredded parmesan, too.  I lined a baking sheet with non-stick foil and skipped the oil, and the meatballs baked up fine.

This recipe is like a foundation for greatness... By themselves, as the recipe shows, they are very bland and flavorless.  I used the lean turkey (7% fat) and was very generous with the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I also added lots of basil and italian seasoning, and added a lot more flavor with garlic salt.  Followed the rest of the recipe (egg and cooking time) and they were delicious!

I loveeee this recipe! I make it for my roommate and they also loveeee it everytime. I also add some salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese to the mix. Instead of making the meatballs "golf ball" size, I make them smaller. By doing so, I find that they turn out slightly crispier and there more for everybody.

I love this recipe! I made the meatballs in a muffin pan. They cooked evenly, turning them half way through. I also added parmesan cheese to my mix.

Like many of the other reviewers, I used this recipe as a base, and added some items of my own....minced garlic, chopped onion, Worcestershire, and parmesan cheese. I also used mozzarella balls in the center of the meatballs, and they came out very gooey and yummy! Great recipe.

This was a very nice meatball that came together quickly.  I was very surprised by that.  I added dried garlic and onion to the mix and also used italian breadcrumbs to give it more flavor.  Was very good.  Will definitely use again.

Delicious!  Really easy to make!  I used ground beef rather than turkey and added the 1/8c. water other reviewers mentioned.  They turned out moist and very tasty!    Next time I plan to make at least a 3x batch, shape the meatballs, place on cookie sheets to freeze, then put them in freezer bags so I meatballs on hand all the time.

This recipe is great and SIMPLE. (Used 94% fat-free turkey which was fine.) I added some chopped onions, and next time I would probably put even more stuff like maybe parmesan cheese, garlic, black pepper, etc. to give it more flavor.  Also, they were already stuff to the pan at 15 minutes so I might turn them sooner, or just giggle the tray to keep them loose.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks.

Overall, great recipe, although a little dry.  I followed some of the recommendations of other cooks.  I added seasoned breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic pepper, and salt to the recipe.  They turned out great, but I had to cook them for 15 minutes on one side and then flip them for another 15 minutes.  To get them a little crispier on the outside I turned on the broiler.  This extra cooking may have been the cause of the dryness.  With that said, I’d make these again in a heartbeat.  They’re a wonderful snack to have for those mid-day cravings!

So easy and so good!  I like recipes like this one.  It gives you a good base for which you can add your own flair to, if you like.  I added fresh chopped parsley, about 3 cloves of garlic (finely minced, of course), a diced onion, and some salt, pepper and a little bit of parmesan cheese.  These were a big hit in this house!  We didn't even have any for leftovers with the rest of the pasta for the next day - had to make more!

Good, but I think they needed more seasoning. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I used plain and added some different things like parmesan cheese, parsley, onion, garlic, salt, pepper... it just wasn't enough! Really good overall though - and super healthy! I got 23 meatballs and had to use two pans.

Very good!  I made these using a 20 oz. pkg. of Italian seasoned ground turkey (didn't have any plain on hand).  Want to try using plain ground turkey too.  Very good gently simmered in spaghetti sauce after baking.  These hold together beautifully!!  This will definitely go into our regular meal rotation.

I added garlic and herbs to the mix, as well a little more olive oil. I just drizzled it on and didn't use any measuring utensils for the ingredients. I rolled them into slightly larger balls and placed then in muffin pans, using silicone muffin liners. I baked them for about 25 minutes, since they were a larger size. I drained them on paper towels to remove the grease/fat that had settle on the bottom. Heated up a jar of garlic and olive oil red sauce and dropped them in the same pan - letting everything simmer for an extra 10 minutes.  Yummy!!

A good base to add in in whatever extras you wish. Personally, I add sautéed diced onions and mushrooms, minced garlic and  fresh basil. Heat through with some canned pasta sauce and you're good to go.

I loved this simple recipe! I followed the recipe as-is and mixed it up the second time by making my own tomato sauce. I highly recommend this recipe for meatball subs with slices of mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan. My husband asks for this every week! And it is great for left overs, just prepare the morning of or the bread gets soggy.

Like the previous posts, I did put some additional things in it to spice the recipe up a bit. I added a pinch of garlic powder, sea salt, fresh ground pepper and Italian seasonings. I make five huge meatballs and add them to my homemade spaghetti and call them monster meatballs. My children absolutely love them. It's now on our bi-weekly rotation.

This is a fantastic recipe... the meatballs are delicious and so easy to make. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used 1/3 cup matzo meal and added 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. salt... they tasted great and my kids loved them! I will be making this recipe at least once a week!

I was looking for a simple meatball recipe and this was it! They were very easy to make and I already had all the ingredients. I did, however add a little bit of garlic salt and I think I might add some parmesan cheese next time. They were very yummy and I would make these again!!!

I have never in my life been able to make meatballs. This recipe made it super easy. I trippled the recipe (which I won't ever do again! Too much time) and simmered them in spaghetti sauce. They turned out FABULOUS!

these were super simple and tasted good. I used 99% and they worked just fine. I did however, fry them up in some olive oil and butter to get a crisp coat and then put in the oven for 17 minutes at 350...then simmered in my sauce for a couple hours. will make again!

Great base recipe! I added chopped onions, garlic powder, salt, basil, and parsley. Spaghetti and meatballs is the only thing that my boyfriend knows how to cook - and he buys frozen meatballs. So I made a huge batch and froze them - now he can make a homemade meal any time he wants.

I'm rating this on method alone, as I added more ingredients to my meatballs.  I baked mine exactly as written and they were incredibly moist and not greasy at all, which is my main complaint with pan-fried recipes.   I used my standard ingredient recipe, adding a splash of milk to moisten my breadcrumbs, fresh parmesan cheese, fresh basil and marjorum, and minced garlic and onion.  I will definitely use the method often, thanks for sharing!

As many reviewers have mentioned, this is a great basic meatball recipe.  My extra touch was chopped green onions, about 1 Tbsp dijon mustard, a dash of Worschester sauce, and a touch of salt and pepper.  We ate them plain, without any sauce and they were delicious. thanks for this wonderful recipe.

These are sooo delicious and the easiest meatballs I've made to date! I throw some pasta sauce in with them near the end, along with some shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheeses to give them a meatball parmesan flavor!

This is a great base recipe for meatballs.  I make them with low fat ground turkey meat and add in about half of a diced yellow onion (the rest goes in my sauce), 2 cloves of minced garlic, dried basil, thyme, and a dash of rosemary.  (You could just use italian seasoning, but I can't stand oregano, so I just season to taste.)  My boyfriend is the pickiest eater ever, and he loves these!

These taste great and are very easy.  The only things I added were a couple cloves of garlic and some parmesan. I also added them to my marinara sauce for an hour after they were done baking and they were really good and moist.

I added fresh parsley and garlic, salt/pepper/parmesan and still found these a bit bland.  However, they were quite a bit better than the turkey meatballs I purchase at the store (and much lower in sodium) so I will make again (and attempt more spice adjustment).

I'd personally give my own meatballs a four, but I missed some stuff so I'll give the original recipe a five. I used ground turkey and plain breadcrumbs since I had no Italian. I didn't even remember to add any Italian seasoning to the batch before baking and they still came out delicious! Alone they were a little ho-hum, but cooking 5-7 minutes longer than the suggested time they still came out very moist, and serving them with bbq sauce they were pretty phenomenal. This will be my go-to recipe for extremely easy meatballs.

This recipe totally works for fast and easy spaghetti and meatballs.  I had to double the recipe, and the proportions worked fine. I didn't have any eggs, but the turkey meatballs still held together.  I used salt, pepper, and Liebers seasoning salt to spice it up.  I didn't have croutons, so I toasted 3 pieces of sourdough bread to dark brown and cubed/shredded them.  I used basic Prego sauce which made the cooking time even quicker.  My teens and husband all went for seconds, then thirds!

What a easy and scrumptious recipe. I was tired of making the regular spaghetti meat sauce so I tried this.  I used ground turkey.  I had company and they were licking their fingers. Thanks for the recipe

Yummy meatballs!  I gave it a 4, only because it needs way more seasoning.  I use garlic salt, onion powder, crushed red pepper, and oregano.

Easy recipe.  Meatballs are kinda bland, but existing recipe is a good base for embellishing to suit your palate.  I usually mix in chopped onion to give them moisture and texture.  The meatballs are much enhanced when placed in a sauce to simmer for a few minutes prior to serving them.

wow was this a great recipe. I used closer to 1/2 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs and added a good amount of parmesan cheese, as well as salt and pepper, garlic powder, and onion salt. Such a great snack, I like dipping mine in light ranch or just eat them plain!!

Perfect way to use a package of turkey.  These were quick and good.  I only had plain breadcrumbs so I used a couple of teaspoons of italian seasoning and I added some grated cheese.  Will definately make again!

These are great 

Some Tips to make them better

Add dry pepper flakes if you want to spice them up.

Put a cube of fresh mozzarella cheese in the middle of the meat ball (this is a big hit)

Bake them for 45 min in a pan with the sauce almost to the top to the meatballs

Works great with pasta or on a long role

I added some parmesan cheese and a few seasonings (salt, pepper, basil, oregano) and the results were great.  Very easy and cheaper (and healthier) than frozen meatballs.

These are ok...pretty bland and they do not hold together well at all. From the stand point of being easy to prepare they are great but I would probably mess around with  adding some more seasoning next time. Sorry no picture

These were fast and easy to make! The results were a satisfied group who gobbled them all up. I followed SandraM's advice in adding some water, pepper, parmesan cheese, garlic powder and salt. However instead of 2 tbsp, I only used 1 and it was fine. I did accompany the meatballs with marinara sauce on the side.

This is a great basic recipe.  We used 99% lean turkey but added moisture and flavor by adding some spaghetti sauce and some grated parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

Super easy. Much better with the additional ingredients suggested by others. My Italian husband gives them a 3; I think they're a 5. We're splitting the difference and calling it a 4.

I've made these twice.  First was exactly to recipe, and they were a bit bland but still good.  I let them sit in simmering sauce for an hour and they were extremely moist and didn't taste like turkey.  The second time I added the suggested spices and they were much better!

These were very good and stayed together well.  Plus they were easy to turn over and then take out of the pan.  The meatballs did not stick at all.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 only because I added a few of my own spices and a quarter of a cup of onion too.  I thought the way the recipe was, it would have been boring and bland.  With the couple of changes of spice, they turned out very well, and passed the husband food critic test.

I loved these recipe but also added what others have suggested.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers and it worked great.  Wonderful flavor!

Great, easy way to make meatballs in a flash!  I used ground turkey and added a little onion and garlic to spice it up. Easy with spaghetti sauce but I also used left-overs with a brown gravy for a little variety. Thanks for a good recipe.

I'm giving the cooking technique 5 stars. I made my regular meatball recipe and baked them according to these instructions. They were quick and easy and didnt stick to the pan. I'm going to bake my meatballs from now on.

This recipe was pretty good with a few tweaks.  I added about 1/2 tsp of each of the following:  dried oregano, dried basil, onion powder.  I also added one minced garlic clove and about a quarter cup of parmesan cheese, and some extra bread crumbs.  I think they need to bake a little bit longer, or at a slightly higher temperature, because they could have been a little more brown.  But this is a really good basic recipe to add to.  The technique is actually what you want to remember, i.e. oven-baking them.  So much easier than frying and getting your stovetop all greasy!

Great meatballs!!! I added salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. They came out perfect. I never thought about making meatballs in the oven but I will be doing it again. I served these babies with Marinara Sauce II (from this site) and angel hair pasta. If you make the marinara sauce, be sure to add 1/2 cup of red wine !>)

These were ok. I like more flavors and less meat. I prefer more bread, garlic and maybe onions, I even like to mix my meat with sausage for a little extra flavor. This is a good basic start, but I will add more ingredients next time for a better flavor.

These were really good.  I added sage, marjoram, fresh oregeno and a tad of fresh basil.  I baked for 15 min on one side, flipped, and baked for 10 then I added to crock pot with home-made spaghetti sauce. Served with whole wheat spaghetti Really, REALLY good!!!

I didn't measure (I never do) just mixed up the turkey, regular bread crumbs (didn't have italian), egg, and threw in per other suggestions-parm cheese, onion powder and garlice powder. I formed them into teeny tiny bite sized balls & baked as directed and turned once or twice. I didnt need to grease the pan at all since it was nonstick. I found they came out kind of dry and then I realized I had forgot to put the oil in it. Maybe that would help? Or maybe it's because I don't measure? Anyway, I made them the day before the party and the day of I simmered in a sauce per Deb's suggestion using about 4 squeezes of Honey BBQ sauce, a can of cranberry sauce & a bit of water for a few hours and they thankfully turned out moist and delicious. There were some leftover and I will say they were better at the first serving rather than the second. I will make these again and try the oil next time and a different sauce.

YUM. These came out perfect, thank you for sharing.
The only thing I did different was add some grated cheese, it's the Italian in me. They came out nice and soft and just perfect.

I LOVE this meatball recipe!  So easy to make.  One thing I did was add a bit more seasoning.  The seasoned breadcrumbs didn't add quite enough flavor for me.

I've been using this recipe for all meatballs I make and it's good and solid. I usually end up adding whatever is in my pantry, like some garlic powder, parmesan cheese, basil, and onions. I've also been using beef instead of turkey, which works just as well.

Wery very easy and quick. I did, though like others, added a little more seasonings. Also, I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so I crushed seasoned croutons. - worked great.

I just got done making this, and I must say that they turned out fantastic!  Of course, I added some garlic and parmesan cheese and maybe 1/2 cup bread crumbs total.... and then baked as directed and these things are great!  So flavorful and perfectly moist.  I paired it tonight with allrecipe's "Best Marinara Sauce Yet", and I will be serving them on white rolls for meatball subs.  I'm really looking forward to the complete meal!

Loved it!  However, I took other folks' suggestions and added 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese, and 1/2 tsp. of Basil, Oregano, and minced garlic.  A dash of salt, as well.  "Turned" them every few minutes to keep the shape round.

I love this recipe!  It is the perfect base recipe.  I added 2 T. Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, pepper, a bit of grated onion and I can't even remember what else.  I used this fantastic cookie scoop to mold the balls and they all turned out fairly uniform - plus it helped me make something like 48 meatballs!  I ended up having to cook two batches because of this.  After removing them from the oven, I set them on a couple of paper towels to soak up the rest of the fat. We tasted them out of the oven and they seemed to be better after heating them up with a [jarred] vodka sauce - especially the next day.  The hubby, baby, and I all enjoyed them and these are going into my repertoire!

Really good meatballs. Even my husband, who doesn't like meatloaf, liked them. I added parmesan cheese to mine.

I liked this recipe, although it's a little bland as is. I put garlic, onion powder, and Italian seasoning in mine.

These were great the family loved them and so easy! My hubby asked what they were and when I told him turkey he was surprised. Will definitely make these again. I've made these many times now and tonight I used them for swedish like meatballs. I used plain bread crumbs, onion powder, garlic, and a little cayenne. Delish!

This recipe was so easy & delicious!  I poured BBQ sauce over meatballs for final five minutes of baking.  I served meatballs inside whole wheat hot dog buns topped with extra sauce.  My kids and husband all enjoyed this warm meal.

Easy is the key word here.  And of course tasty too. We loved this low fat alternative to beef meat balls and will be doing a huge batch up next time to keep in the freezer.

Good recipe.  I took the advice of someone else and added Lipton onion soup mix in addition to the bread crumbs.  Oh, I also used ground beef..not turkey.  It was really good!

They are fast, friendly and bland. Great for a busy, large family full of small finicky eaters. The husband was the only one who thought these meatballs were missing one ingredient: And that was groundbeef : )

very easy, moist and delicious. I used them in a meatball sub and it was a real hit. The only thing I changed was that I added a few other spices, garlic and herb powder, parmesan cheese, oregano and a little worcestershire sauce. 
Will definitely make these again to add to many recipes.

These are great to make if you are in a hurry.  They stay together well, and are fast to make.  The only thing was that they tended to be a little dry.  I put them in sauce as soon as they were done cooking, and that helped some.

Simple, and family friendly...my daughter (5) enjoyed making the meatballs, so not only was it a fast and delicious addition to our spaghetti, it was quality bonding time with my daughter...something I'll repeat again and again!!  Love the parm cheese suggestion I saw in another review...gonna have to try that next time...only other thing they needed was a little salt...YUM-O!

This was really good!  I thought these were better than most beef meatballs I have tried.  I used ground turkey "with flavoring" I don't know if that had anything to do with it.  After cooking them in the oven, I placed them in a simple marinara sauce using a big can of crushed tomatoes, garlic, finely chopped carrot, celery, and onion, red wine, italian seasoning and salt to taste.  Served it over pasta with real parmeggiano cheese.  My husband and kids loved it.  My 11 year old daughter enjoyed helping me make the meatballs.  Very simple, good recipe even the fussiest eaters will enjoy!  Will definately make again!  Thanks!

These were pretty good!!  I did add a small chopped onion and a combination of rosemary, basil, oregano, and garlic powder since my breadcrumbs were plain.  I only had 1 lb. of ground turkey so my meatballs did cook a little faster, maybe just 10 minutes and then turn would make it better. I did simmer them in marinara sauce while I boiled some penne pasta and it was very very good!  I have no problem trying them again and again!! :)

These meatballs were very good and easy! I loved that I did not have to fry them.   Maybe it's just my oven but they needed more than 5 min after I flipped them over.  I baked for another 10 min.

What a great basic recipe!  I added parm. cheese but forgot to add a little garlic powder.  Also, I only had ground turkey breast meat on hand rather than just regular ground turkey with 7% fat.  Next time I'll use regular as I bet it helps with the flavor. Otherwise, these turned out great and were a cinch to make. Thank you for sharing!

great simple recipe. my kids loved them. I left the recipe the way it is for my kiddo's. but jazzed it up a bit for me. I used half hamburger and half sausage, added some fine diced onion and then mixed the breadcrumbs and egg. yummy. but either way. the recipe is very good and easy!
Thanks a bunch

The meatballs came out amazing even though I didnt follow the recipe to a T.  I didnt have Italian seasoning so I just added a few sprinkles of Adobo and dried parsley flakes.  Substituted all panko instead of Italian bread crumbs.   Came out super crunchy on the exterior but moist on the inside.

I used coconut oil on foil paper, added chopped onion and substitute crumbled ritz crackers for bread crumbs. DELICIOUS! I served over cous cous with steamed red pepper, carrot and broccoli. Drizzled with Teriaky sauce. Vwala!

I actually forgot to preheat the olive oil greased pan, so I cooked for 20 mins and then turned and cooked for 8 mins more.  Put finished meatballs in shallow pot with leftover spaghetti sauce and left on simmer for about an hour.  Very good.*****Made again with 2-3 tablespoons of grated parmesan, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Added a splash or two of whole milk to the egg then beat.  Folded the dry ingredients into the egg/milk mixture then folded THAT mixture into the ground meat.

SO easy for busy moms. I used slightly dampened 100% whole grain bread in place of bread crumbs, added minced garlic  (to our tastes) and fresh, chopped parsley (to our tastes). 

In the tradition of my mother, I put 1 tsp of olive oil into a pot in which I sauteed the fresh garlic, then added the meatballs and cooked until nicely browned.  I then poured the sauce into the pot, covered it, and simmered it for 30 mins. This adds lots of flavor to the sauce. I also like to add the cooked pasta to the sauce and meatballs. My family loves meatballs and pasta this way. Much faster cleanup...only one pot.

Next time, I plan to make extras for portioned freezing. MORE than YUMMLY!!

Yum! Good basic meatball recipe. I added onions, garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper, and a hint of basil + oregano . I bought basil & tomato sauce and used birds eye's spaghetti veggies.I'm gonna continue playing around with the seasonings , but this dish was delicious and super fast to make (+ clean up was easy!)

This recipe is very fast and easy to make. I'm quite new to cooking so it wasn't quite as intimidating as some of the other recipes I found. I didn't have olive oil and I used plain breadcrumbs, so it wasn't quite as flavorful as it could have been, but I'm happy with how they turned out otherwise.

This is a basic, easy, meatball recipe that derives it's seasoning from the Italian style bread crumbs.  It was good but I felt it needed more seasoning.  The review is supposed to be about this recipe.  Not the one that folks have added 12 additional ingredients and then gave it a five.  
Yep, Italian meatballs must have Pecorino Romano cheese; fresh garlic, fresh onion, parsley (ingredients you will find in the Italian breadcrumbs, but not enough to make this Italian a happy camper.
So if you want a basic recipe that you can enhance to your taste, this is great.  

People, stop saying the recipe is good, but I added half the pantry......  If you had to add half the pantry, then the recipe wasn't good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's now no longer the recipe posted, it's your own recipe you are  rating .

People look for recipes and rely on ratings to even stop to read the recipe....when the recipe is not reviewed on its own merit, the rating system means nothing.

These meatballs turned out very good. And so easy! I added various Italian seasonings and fresh garlic. The consistency of the meatballs was excellent. Not too mushy or dense which I have had problems with before.  It's become my go to meatball recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Super easy to make and very tasty. I baked the meatballs on parchment paper for easy cleanup (and no need for Olive oil) and then mixed them with BBQ sauce. It was a huge hit.

Easy peasy!  Added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder and a bit of garlic salt without measuring, just eyeballed it. (very unlike me). Added a jar of pasta sauce and some spaghetti noodles and viola! quick, good and easy!

These turkey meatballs are the bes I ever had. I made a few changes in this recipe.  I used Italian seasoned ground turkey. replaced the egg with eggbeaters.  I used cracker crumbs instead of the bread crumbs.  Also used an ice cream scoop. Instead of baking these. Instead I browned them and finished cooking them in the sauce.

I gave it 5 stars because I followed Sandra's additional ingredients.  We all loved them, great flavor, nice firm texture. I did leave mine in the oven longer to get a little more brown. My wife is a big beef eater and she even liked them . Definitely a keeper were her words.

this was a great recipe. I was initially concerned that 350° wasn't high enough, but I was wrong and they turned out a lot more moist and kept their shape better at the lower temp. I also added Italian seasoning because I only had regular breadcrumbs, garlic and Parmesan cheese.

seriously, this is my go to recipe for when I want an easy dinner. I use a baking stone so I don't use the oil when preheating but that's the only change I made. the recipe itself is just right. so much easier than making them on the stove top.

I used beef. They were a good texture, but if I make them again I would definitely add at least a little salt and pepper. They were rather bland.

Needs spices or sauce or something!  That said, the toddler and teens liked it, so maybe some kind of sauce would do it.

I have made this recipe about 6 times now,  my family absolutely loves it!  The only thing I changed up is instead of using the olive oil on the pan I mix it in with the meatballs.  So delicious!

So yummy! But used ground beef instead of ground turkey. Also added some Parmesan to the mixture and loved it. Will definitely be using this recipe again! This recipe is also a good starter to add more flavors for the adventure seekers.

Start with this recipe, and customize for your taste. I made my own breadcrumbs using leftover bread, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper. I followed the rest of the recipe, but after removing from the oven, I added it to my homemade marinara sauce. Delicious. Thanks for the great recipe.

Did not make any changes. Did cook then in a pressure cooker. Took less time. Then added noodles with my own sauce.  My hamburger was 80/20. Along with the sausage it was moist.

I added the onion powder, garlic powder and sage as the review I read did. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of each. I added some shredded mozzarella, salt and pepper. Turned out great. Will make again.

Definitely a keeper, super easy too. I used the very lean turkey meat and added a little olive oil, Parmesan cheese, onions, and a little extra garlic to the mix. Delicious and very moist!

I made this w/ the addition of spices SandraM listed. I also fried them to get it crispy.  Served over buttered egg noodles and everyone gobbled them up. NEXT Time:  I baked them for 15 minutes, then the last 5 I broiled them to brown the tops.  This is super quick to put together.

These meatballs are fine, but as written, I can only give the recipe three stars. I like to trust the recipe when preparing it the first time, since I am no expert. So I didn't add anything, even salt and pepper, even though my instincts told me I should. Without salt and pepper, or as other reviewers have suggested, combinations of the following: sage, Parmesan cheese, onion powder, garlic powder,  etc. Since none of those things are written into the recipe, I assumed those flavors would come from the bread crumbs, but not so. Next time, I'll add some of those spices and a good recipe will be even better.

It's a good, easy basic recipe, as the title denotes.  You could probably do more with spices, onion, garlic, whatnot, but my gravy tends to have a bite to it, so I like to just keep the meatballs basic and let the gravy shine.

This recipe was a hit with my family! We aren't big on turkey so I used the same amount of pork as a substitute. I also did one cup of breadcrumbs and added a generous half cup of grated parmesean cheese. Will definitely be making this again!

I was looking for a basic recipe that I could add my own flavors to so this worked out great. I used ground beef and added 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning,  added some onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and parsley and 2 tbsp water (or milk). I think you could do a lot of different flavor combos with this recipe so I will be experimenting in the future. Great simple recipe. I cooked them according  to the directions  but I added 5 extra minutes at the end to brown them a bit more.

Easy to make your own!  I added about 2 Tbsp of parmesan, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to taste.  I also used beef instead of turkey.  It took an extra 15 minutes to bake at a lower temperature, but they were amazing! Everybody loved them!

I love to make these on Sunday to have around during the week.  Great for lunches and dinner add-ons.  

I added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and grilled some onions and garlic and through into the mixture once it cooled.  I didn't find it needed any additional seasoning when using the Italian breadcrumbs, except for salt and pepper to taste.  

I generally do not turn them in the oven, and I toss them into a crockpot with either my favorite spaghetti sauce (Paul Newman's Sockarooni) or a brown gravy.  They taste better as the week goes on :-)

These were delicious even my teenagers loved them!! I did however change adding bread crumbs since I didn't have any.  I did a package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and poured some Italian dressing over the meat mixture and it turned out excellent!!!  Will be making this recipe often.

I made it as is and it was pretty bland. I would follow the the suggestions of some of the reviewers and add some sausage and other spices.

This a good beginner's recipe. The meatball mix is pretty plain so I added fresh parsley, garlic powder, herbs (oregano, dried basil). I always test the first meatball for seasoning by pan frying it. It was excellent after all the adjustments. I baked the rest of my meatballs as per the recipe directions and I have to say that baking it completely ruined the meatballs. Meatballs are usually pan fried first, which brings out the flavours and keeps the juices in. For me, since these were already turkey and lean, it was not worth saving few calories by baking them instead of pan frying first. Huge difference in flavor.

Great recipe!  Followed others suggestions by adding garlic powder, onion powder, italian seasoning and parm cheese.
Made these with roasted spaghetti squash (keeping a low carb lifestyle) and Nanny's spaghetti sauce from this site.  Whole dinner was only 400 calories and I am full!

I made them with ground beef, I used garlic cheese croutons instead of bread crumbs because bread doesn't last long enough to get stale around here plus I thought they'd add great extra flavor. I also seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, and paprika. I've never made meatballs before, and these turned out great! !!!

These were great as written, and I followed the baking and mixing directions exactly.  I only added a little seasoning for flavor, and used crushed Ritz instead of bread crumbs because of what I had on hand.  Ended up glazing them in Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicy BBQ sauce the last 10 minutes to make them BBQ meatballs.  They were SO tender, so moist, so delicious.  Props for being my first rated recipe on AR!!  LOVE EM!

Super easy!  I used 94% lean ground turkey and added a tbps of olive oil.  Also added the following seasonings to whole wheat breadcrumbs: basil, oregano, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper.  Added 2 tbsp of parm cheese.  Baked as directed and then simmered in marinara.  Very good.

I ended up using Italian seasoned turkey (because it was on sale) but these were still delightfully easy to make. I baked mine a little longer to make them a nice brown color and they turned out yummy. I made a big batch so I can just heat them up whenever I make pasta or want a snack.

This is a pretty simple meatball recipe. Nothing grandiose or inherently special about it, but easy and tasty. I usually like to cook my meatballs on the skillet rather than in the oven, but I've reverted to the oven several times when I don't feel like standing over the skillet rolling meatballs over and over. I use this recipe regularly because of its ease and have sent it to others for the same reason.

This was GREAT. I'm a new mommy & work full time. I'm desperately trying to balance work, mommy hood and still get something yummy on the table. This was Hubby approved and I'm sure my little one will like it too once she's old enough to have some. I added about 1/4 of fresh parmesan cheese and 3 TBS of milk. I used garlic infused olive oil. For a quick sauce I dumped a can of crushed tomatoes in a pot and added Italian seasoning, fresh chopped garlic and onion. Dinner was ready in 40 mins from start to finish!

So easy!  Have only used ground turkey with 7% fat, made the rest of the recipe as called for and they taste great.  May add a few more spices to liven them up even more next time but still wonderful as is.

Tasty Meatballs. I doubled the recipe and added a bunch of other stuff, like most people who's reviews I read before selecting this recipe.

I used Empire Kosher Ground White Turkey as it's very tasty on it's own. I added two large eggs, cumin, fresh garlic, red onion, salt & fresh ground pepper blend, fresh Italian Parsley, dried Basil, finely chopped fresh carrot, dash of Turmeric, Ian's Panko Whole Wheat Breadcrumbs + Wegman's Italian Classics Seasoned Bread Crumbs, Go Veggy! Grated Parmesan topping & a splash of Cooking Sherry.

Of course, you can use real Parmesan cheese, but I needed to keep it dairy-free.

Formed and cooked meatballs as specified, then plunked them in pasta sauce to simmer while I made the spaghetti and a salad.

Seconds were had!

I made this tonight and we loved them, but as other reviewers have stated, it needs spices, which is why I rated it a 4, not 5.  I added garlic, onion powder, a little pepper and parsley.  I also added sage but thought it was a little too much at 1/2 a tsp, maybe a 1/4 tsp would have been plenty.  Also, I left out the cheese in the recipe (we're lactose intolerant) and also the salt some reviewers suggested, because turkey and the bread crumbs put this meal over 300 mg. of salt already - which is plenty.  I also used Pam instead of the oil to save calories and grease.  Cooking time was perfect, and I appreciate the tip to use an ice cream scooper, which keeps all the balls around the same size so they cook uniformly.  This is a good, basic recipe which even my picky husband loved.  Thanks!

This is generally how I start the meatballs...each time I will add a different spice, flavored bread crumbs, or seasoning to them.  This time we followed the recipe so my 4 year old could make meatballs.  She rolled them, placed them on the pan, threw them in the oven and set the timer.  If you want a recipe that your kiddos can help you with then this is perfect as is.  Used them in a "Swedish Meatballs" type dish.

I absolutely love this recipe, but found that the meatballs were really greasy initially, meaning lots of fat was coming out of the meatballs after 15 minutes of baking. I used the 93% fat turkey, and ended up having to roll them in paper towels to soak up the grease off of each of the meatballs. Then I put them back on a brand new cookie sheet, with parchment paper, and baked them for the remaining 5 minutes. Has anyone else has this problem?

I love this recipe for the simplicity.  It did sound a bit bland so I added Parmesan cheese for a flavor boost and they came out really good. I didn't preheat the pan as per the directions but they still came out fine. I will definitely be making these again!

This recipe is good, but it needs more of a kick.  Next time I am going to put some onion and garlic in it.  Otherwise, I am definitely keeping this for a base recipe.

I make this or a variation of this often for my boyfriend. I eat completely vegetarian and while he supports me in this, he does like a bit of meat now and then. This recipe is so simple to make and economical, it's my favourite meat item to prepare for him because it makes a ton and we can freeze some to use throughout the next couple weeks. It also lends itself to substitutions, I've used ground beef and pork (the pork was his favourite meatball of all time, according to him) and even some fresh ground chicken breasts which I popped in my food processor for a bit. You can add tons of flavouring mix-ins too, and I often add chopped scallions or red pepper relish, sometimes chili powder or hot sauce, and once I added soy sauce for an asian twist. So even though I never taste these, my better half insists these are great, which takes this to 5 stars. Tons of variety means these can go with everything and I LOVE how inexpensive these are. I've also used everything from panko to homemade breadcrumbs in these and they turn out fine every time. lovelovelove!

I made these tonight and they were good. I'm a fan of meatballs because they are easy and my 4yr old daughter likes them. I chose these because of the basic recipe and good ratings. Like many others, I did add some seasonings because they did sound a little bland as is. I substituted the bread crumbs (I was out) for crushed up garlic and cheese croutons. I added salt, pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, parsley, a little bit of Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a couple squirts of ketchup. I was a little worried they would be too mushy, but it worked out fine. I did not use these in sauce so I wanted to make sure they were flavorful without. They were and my daughter gobbled them up. I'm sure I will refer to this recipe many times, but probably change them up depending on the rest of the meal.

I didn't use egg, but added minced garlic, a handful of Parmesan cheese and substituted oatmeal for bread. They hold together beautifully! Then I simmer them in home made sauce to infuse the flavor.

I made these last night and both my wife and I thought they were great. I did not have bread crumbs on hand but did have some stale bread we had baked so I made my own and soaked them in milk. We had been looking for something was was not fired and these fit the ticket! Basic, easy, tasty and easy to change up. I rate these a five.

I was all set to make these meatballs, and then realized that I only had plain breadcrumbs. I went ahead and made these, but had to improvise a bit by adding 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of onion powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp pepper. I chose not to use any Italian seasoning because I wanted to keep these pretty plain in hopes that my kids would eat them. Well, my 6 yr old did, but my 4 yr old didn't. My husband and I thought that these turned out well. I like that there was no chopping or mincing to be done. Simple and easy, basic recipe.

Awesome and my concern was the cooking time, but it's just right. We used the meatballs for meatball subs- my 1 and 3 year girls loved it! So did my husband but he's my plAte cleaner he eats anything.

Largely disappointed in the original recipe, but possibly due to my selection of ingredients listed. 85% lean turkey, Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (the granular ones from a canister). Also the egg and EVOO. My gut told me they needed more seasoning, and I was right--but I always try to follow a recipe to the letter first time I try it. Consistency of the meatballs was good and they were perfectly crisp on the outside, so I think the turkey, egg, olive oil and bread crumbs all did their basic jobs -but this exact combination of ingredients as I listed will leave you with a VERY bland-tasting result. Will definitely try some of the add-ins mentioned next time, It's a good foundation for a recipe, but I have to think all the raves here involved some additions. Even just salt & pepper could have saved these.

Ok, we don't like ground turkey so I used ground beef and I had to make my own Italian seasoned bread crumbs. But these were super easy and super awesome. Definitely will be making them again!

This is such a flexible recipe.  I use gluten free breadcrumbs and add an extra egg to compensate for the structure you lose by removing the wheat.  You can double the recipe and par bake half, cool and freeze.  They defrost beautifully in a slow cooker your favorite sauce.

Super easy and tasty. I used italian seasoned ground turkey, though next time regular ground turkey might be better since it was almost a little too overwhelming on the italian seasoning for my tastes. Added a clove of minced garlic, two slices of chopped onion, and approx three tablespoons of parm cheese. Kept them in a little longer after turning them around, maybe ten mins instead of five. Very good!

Very quick and simple recipe! I made these tonight for dinner with spaghetti (I used lean beef instead of turkey), and added just a bit of garlic and onion powder in addition to the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs for extra flavor. I think they could have used just a bit more seasoning - I'm going to experiment a bit next time I make them.

This is a great recipe. As others suggested I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp of basil, oregano, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I also used oatmeal in place of the bread crumbs and it turned out fantastic.

Delicious and super easy! We all have recipes for meatballs that are more involved, bu these are perfect for a quick throw together dinner. I actually use the Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey from Jennie O, perfect for 25min meatballs!

Our family loved the taste of these delicious meatballs. I made them last week and they are being requested again this week. Since I didn't have Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, I used panko bread crumbs. I added a dash of oregano and rosemary to the panko bread crumbs to season them, along with a dash of salt and pepper. We give this recipe 5 stars.

I use this recipe all the time. I only bake the meatball for about 15 min though, and then let them cook the rest of the day boiling in the sauce. I've used turkey meat & lean hamburger and they're both great.

This was the first time I have ever made meatballs they were excellent and super easy to make. I used the suggestions of adding water, and the different spices. For the last 5 mins I put the over on broil to give the meat balls a nice brown color. I will definitely add this recipe to my rotation!

AWESOME!!  My husband and daughter loved them. I did take the advise of others who added the garlic powder, italian seasoning, and Parm cheese.  This will definitely be the recipe that I will use from now on.  Thanks.

These quicly became a family fave.  We like our meatballs a little bit sweet, so we just throw in some fresh basil.  They got rave reviews with my husband's coworkers, too, at a potluck.

Excellent! Added the 2tbsp of parmesan as other reviewers have suggested and substituted mashed potato flakes for the bread crumbs since we are a gluten free house.

All little bland as is.  Needs a little salt, pepper, and garlic.  Also I had to bake them a little longer - 15 minutes, turn, 10 minutes.  I doubled the batch and made 40 meatballs.  I am going to freeze them and use in spaghetti sauce.

This is a great basic recipe, but it needs more flavor. I added onion and garlic powders, fresh parsley, and salt and pepper. They came out great. I will be making again with the above modifications.

I was craving meatball subs for the longest while but I am working very hard at trying to eat healthy. So I decided to try making the subs with turkey meatballs! I was not disappointed! I added some extra garlic powder but left the recipe as is! I used whole wheat buns, low sodium sauce and light mozza cheese - it was a great way to satisfy my craving for a not-so-healthy meal! Thanks!

I used 85/15 ground turkey and they came out soft on the exterior, despite leaving them in the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Perhaps I should of tried using 93/7 ground turkey. Other than that little mishap, these meatballs were tasty!

These meatballs were very good, they were very moist and incredibly easy to make.  Next time I think I will try some of the previous suggestions and add more seasoning.  The recipe is a great base though, and they were one of the better turkey meatball recipes that I have tried even without the additional seasoning.  This will probably become my "go to" meatball recipe.

We made these with ground turkey and they were really good. I didn't love the texture for some reason (a little soft maybe?), but my boyfriend thought they were just great. Thanks for the recipe - will definitely try these again.

SUPER friendly kid recipe.  Fun to make with lots of kids, good for party activity, especially if you use funny Italian accents while you are making the meatballs.  I only had ground beef and one package of ground turkey so I mixed them -- definitely fattier but the kids loved it with ketchup.  Natch.  Have toothpicks on hand so kids (or adults!) can serve themselves off a big platter.

These were fantastic, i made just a couple changes. I happen to have italian flavored lean ground turkey, so i used that instead of the italian bread crumbs. i just used one piece of whole wheat toast a made my own bread crumbs out of. i also just used the egg white instead of the entire egg (for weight watchers purposes). and last i added fresh garlic and a TBLS or two of chopped onion. VERY VERY GOOD will make again.

Great recipe!  I needed to whip up something quick for dinner, and this was perfect!  I had some older bread that I wanted to get rid of so I ended up making some bread crumbs with that--added in some dry herbs (for the Italian seasoning: rosemary, thyme, oregano.  Didn't have marjoram or basil) and a little bit of Parmesan cheese.  I also only used 1 tbsp of olive oil instead of two.  Turned out perfectly!  Very very delicious!  Definitely will be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

Super nummy and easy!  We used ground beef because it's what we had.  These also freeze very nicely.

Not too bad for what it is, which is a basic recipe.  I have gestational diabetes and was looking for a low-carb recipe and this one fit the bill.  I need to eat an ounce of meat with my snacks throughout the day, so I just grab a cold meatball outta the fridge.  I added some garlic powder, salt and parmesean cheese and baked them for a total of 25 minutes.  Were pretty good and my 1-1/2 year old loved them too.  I'll surely make these again....at least until the baby comes :-)
Edit: I made these again tonight with extra-lean ground beef, used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs and added some garlic powder, parsley, dried onions, basil and some parmesan cheese.  Poured some marina over top and baked a bit longer.  YUMMM!  My picky daughter even liked these.

I used this recipe the first time I made meatballs. I used beef though. It's a great recipe, but it DEFINITELY needs some seasoning to it. But it's great for basic meatballs. I added basil and oregano, but next time I'll add garlic to it.

This is a great base recipe to flavor however you choose and more importantly, it's a quick and easy technique for making meatballs. I used low fat ground turkey (about 93% fat free) and skipped the egg and olive oil. To the turkey and bread crumb mixture, I threw in some dried basil, oregano, 2 minced garlic cloves, and onion powder since these items are what I happened to have on hand. I didn't have any eggs and I think because I used the 93% fat free turkey instead of the 99% fat free kind, I was able to get away with not using an egg. I used a small cookie scoop to form the meat balls and placed them on a nonstick jellyroll pan. My meatballs were a little smaller than the recommended golf ball size so I browned them for 10 minutes, stirred them and browned them for another 5 minutes. I then added them to the slow cooker along with some spaghetti sauce. I cooked the sauce and meatballs on low heat for 3-4 hours. They kept their shape due to browning them in the oven first. They were flavorful and moist. I will be making my meatballs in this manner from now on - so fast and easy!

Excellent and versatile basic recipe.  Add more spices to suit your family tastes.  Our preschool granddaughters loved them.  Also great for meatball subs with Italian or barbeque sauce.

these were AWESOME i had all the ingredients because there is hardly anything needed! i added about a 1/4 cup of water maybe a little more to moisten them, used ground beef instead. And added some garlic salt, parmesan, and basil. my boyfriend LOVED THEM and i work at an italian resturant and he said they were better then the new ones at my work.

These were great for the kids.  They made them all by themselves (except for the cooking part, of course).  They were a little greasy-I would use half of the oil next time.  The kids LOVED them!

Made these exactly as described, except I added fresh chopped basil into the mix. Served with whole wheat penne and homemade spaghetti sauce (Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce from this site). YUM!

These were so fast and easy to make. They were a hit with my four year-old son. He loved them! I did take the advice of others and added some finely Chopped Onion, Crushed Garlic, 1/2 tsp of Ground Sage, 2 T of Shredded Parmesean Cheese, Salt, Pepper, 1/8 Cup of Water, and I used ground italian salad croutons for bread crumbs. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again. I put them in with some fresh homemade cheese ravioli and marinara sauce. Absolutely delicious!

Easy to make and they turn out nicely browned.  I cook these with Lana's Sweet and Sour meatball sauce from this site and they always go over well.

i liked that this recipe was really quick and really easy.  the meatballs are a bit bland though.  i had them with bow tie pasta and a tomato basil sauce and it was good with the sauce.  would NOT eat these without some sort of sauce, but a great recipe starter!!

Yes, this is a great basic recipe with lots of flexibility for spices and type of meat. I'll spare you the detailed list of what *I* added, but I do suggest Worcheshire or even Tobasco sauce, which I haven't seen listed in other reviews. As much as I love fresh basil, you might as well save it for the sauce where you can add it at the last minute to maintain it's flavor. Baked in the meatballs, most of the fresh basil taste is significantly diminished (it does add nice green specks though). Also, if you grate or process your onion, it will be the best consistency for holding meatballs together and distributing the flavor.

With a little "extra" added to these, they are great! Onion pdr, garlic pdr, oregano and basil. Mix all up. Bake as instructed.  Put some hoagie buns under the broiler for a few(with a slice of cheese). Throw on a couple of these balls and add some spaghetti sauce on top. Delicious!

These are good because they are not only fast but they are also very versatile. You can add garlic, onion, or herbs (like basil or oregano). Thanks for the family-friendly recipe.

I was a little nervous due to the simplicity of this recipe, and the fact that ground turkey is usually pretty blah without much seasoning.  I followed the recipe and added parmesan cheese, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, oregano, and two dashes of soy sauce.  They were FANTASTIC!  Soft and moist and flavorful.

Like other reviewers, it's simple and works great for kids.  I on the other hand added 2 tbsp chopped garlic, 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, a dash of garlic salt, a dash of onion power, a dash of rosemary and a dash of sage.  All combined it was a wonderful experience.  Super easy and super tasty.

This was a great base recipe for me. I added minced white onion, plain bread crumbs, a packet of dry italian salad dressing mix, fresh basil, fresh oregano, fresh thyme, fresh parsley, and some garlic powder. My family LOVED them! We will definitely be making this again.

This is an absolutely terrific recipe. It's simple, easy, fast and good tasting. The baking is a nice twist as I usually cook meatballs on the stove. This is cleaner and works really well. Next time I'll add a bit of parmesan and see how that goes!

I made this last night with penne pasta with muchroom marinara for friends. It was a nice way to make having meat optional.  My children prefer to just have sauce and noodles when my husband has to have his meats.. Also i was able to spice up half the recipe with franks red hot for him:)  A healthy option i used was replacing the bread crumbs with finally chopped oatmeal.. They were wonderful!

What a great recipe! I made this for me and my husband and we both loved it. A couple things I changed. Since I had to scale this down a lot, I used some mayo instead of an egg. I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs so I just added my own italian seasoning. also salt and pepper to taste! turned out wonderfully!

The simplicity of this recipe make is so great, you can play with your seasoning to achieve the flavor that best fits your palate. I added Oregano, basil, parm cheese, some minced onion, garlic powder. I will make these again and try this with fresh basil and about 5 cloves of fresh roasted garlic. They are light and airy and I much prefer these to the dense beef meatballs. They are actually very similar to meatballs I had while living Naples Italy.

Very good. I added a TB of olive oil, parmesan cheese and minced garlic (as others had suggested). Quick and delicious. Only 4 stars as I prefer to cook meatballs in sauce.

Fantastic base recipe!  You can add any ingredient to suit your tastes. I added minced garlic fresh, minced basil, a little pepper, oregano, and italian seasoning.  They were super easy and soooo delicious!!  These meatballs are even better than those made with ground beef and much healthier.  Thanks for the recipe this is going in the favorites!!

It was very simple and fast to make.  It stayed true it's name.  I did add a little salt and pepper to give it more taste.  But you can't beat it for the calories you get.

Nice basic recipe.  You can do almost anything to it bring it to your taste.  I made it more greek style and added oregano, red pepper flakes, and feta.  Not sure of my amounts..just what ever felt right for the mixture.

So simple and delicious! I followed the recipe steps exactly, but added more ingredients, including diced onion, celery, carrots, oregano, basil, nutmeg, garlic, and salsa. Yummy!

This turned out great.  My daughter is seven & starting to take an interest in cooking, so she helped me make them.  We used crushed italian croutons, and added a splash of steak sauce & ketchup.  Everyone liked them.

These were great! We are trying to lighten up our meals so we used ground turkey Italian sausage.  Added a little minced onion, garlic powder and worcheshire with the bread crumbs.  Baked the meatballs on parchment paper for easy clean up. Hubby made a simple marinara sauce and added these to simmer the last 30 min.  Baking your meatballs is the only way to do them!!

Perfect, easy recipe.  Substituted ground beef and doubled the recipe.  Served some tonight with a homemade sauce over pasta and then froze the rest for later use.  Love it!

Used 96/4 ground beef, no bread crumbs (I'm on a low carb diet), it came out okay but needed something more to flavor it up.

My husband said the kids really tore up on these (I made ahead of time and my husband threw them into spaghetti one night when I was out of town). I tasted one of them when they were just warm out of the oven with a little ketchup. I thought it tasted pretty good. I asked my 12 yr old daughter what she thought and she said, "They were okay." So hence only a four. I would make these again though.

THESE WERE SO GOOD!!!
I wanted to just throw something together, so this and some fried rice were just what the doctor ordered. I didn't have Italian seasoned breadcrumbs though, so I added tarragon, onion powder, parsley and cilantro. It was great!

I gave this recipe 5 stars based off a couple of revisions.  As other members suggested, I added sage, parm cheese, and a sprinkle of water to the mixture.  I didn't have italian seasoned bread crumbs, so I used part plain bread crumbs and part panko bread crumbs, and added my own italian seasoning.  I baked the meatballs for a total of 25 min (rolled them on all sides so they were crispy brown all over..yum!).  When I told my husband that we were having turkey meatballs with spaghetti, his reaction was, "but I like beef".  Once he tried one of these meatballs, he quickly retracted his previous statment and decided that turkey tastes better than beef!

These were ridiculously easy to make. My family, getting a bit tired of my recent cooking experiments, were overjoyed when I served them the old Spaghetti & Meatballs favorite with these quick meatballs. I used canned sauce and served garlic bread on the side. There were no leftovers.

The best, plain and simple!  I make these as written and my kids gobble them up, but I also 'doctor up' this recipe with other seasonings (fresh garlic, parmesan cheese, sage, red pepper flakes, etc.) when I want a little extra kick.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

These were delicious! I used the ice cream scoop and it made 9 large meatballs. I also added 1 1/2 t. basil, 1 t. garlic powder, 1t. red pepper flakes, and 1/2 t. kosher salt. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

Good basic meatball recipe. I used ground beef because that's what I had on hand, and it worked fine. I added some seasonings and also grated parmesan before rolling the meatballs. Half in the fridge for tomorrow, half in the freezer. Next time I will double the recipe.

I am done ever buying frozen meatballs again!  I usually don't change a recipe too much and than rate it but I threw some shredded parm, onion powder and garlic salt into these.  After tasting them, they were perfect by the way, I think they may have been a little bland without the additions.  These are one of my new favorites!

Very easy and very tasty - that makes it my kind of recipe!  My kids love them. These are great in spaghetti sauce and wonderful on meatball subs.  

Edited on December 17 to add:  I made these tonight with sweet Italian sausage instead of turkey.  They were so good I ate at least 5 of them before I put them in the spaghetti sauce!

I thought they were fine as written, but my husband definitely thought something was missing. I'm now going to have to invest the time in tweaking this recipe to make it more flavorful. That said, I will make these again because the recipe is a good base for turkey meatballs. I prefer to limit our red meat consumption whenever possible.

Simple, moist, and easily varied for those who do or don't do all of the spices that can be added to this great basic meatball idea.  Timing and sizing were PERFECT (and I have a convection oven)...  This went great with the raviole and red sauce we had.  Paul was greatful.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!  This turned out to be such a hit in the house.  I also added the parm (lots), garlic powder, onion powder, and salt and pepper.  After the directed cooking time, I transferred to pan with oil to brown - I should have done this first, but I didn't know that it wouldn't brown the oven. My family loved it - definitely a keeper!

Really moist, tasty, and EASY. I baked them  in the oven as directed and then simmered them for about a half hour in marinara sauce and served them on rolls as meatball sandwiches--YUM! I will definitely make these again.

This was pretty good.  I should have used more garlic powder like other reviewers suggested.  I did use 1 med onion chopped as well as some carrots (get some veggies into the kids).  :)  Because we can't have gluten, we substituted gluten-free bread crumbs.  Next time, I will definitely add more spices and it should be even better.

Great recipe for kids. If you cook it for adults then you probably will want to season it. Me and my kids enjoyed it!

I think this is a good starting point for meatballs, gives you a good idea of the basic recipe.  Then you can add in whatever herbs you like to personalize it to your own taste.  We added 2 Tbs. parm cheese, as well as some sage, garlic, and salt/pepper.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend last night because he really wanted meatballs!  I thought these were a great healthy option with the turkey.  I added a pinch of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  They baked as recommended and were really pretty good!  I think I'll have to make these again!

It was a good recipe, but I used whole wheat bread pulsed in a coffee grinder for bread crumbs vs. italian seasoning bread crumbs.  My daughter is allergic to dairy so I had to make the substitution and it turned out great.  Thanks for a good basic recipe.

As written, this recipe needs some help. It's crying for more flavor. Some onion? some garlic? Herbs? The flavored bread crumbs aren't enough to carry this recipe. There is no reason to use 7% fat turkey. Lower is ok. Try to purchase ground turkey without added salt. Store ground usually is salt free.
On the plus side, and the reason I gave this a two, is because it is fast. Cooking in the oven is a good idea.

Thank you for the recipe!  The pros:  My daughters (6 and 4) were able to help with this and loved shaping the meatballs and they baked beautifully.

The cons:  We added quite a bit of spice and I think next time we might try a turkey/italian sausage combo.  Although they weren't dry, they weren't juicy like we expected them to be.

Still, you gave us a great place to start!  Thank you!

Yummy & so easy. Made them with lean red meat & added Parmesan cheese to the mix, plus a teaspoon of chopped garlic. For breadcrumbs, I used fat free Italian seasoning croutons (mashed up in a ziplock bag, for fine crumbs). First time making meatballs & the Family LOVED them!! Even my 4 year old went crazy for these meatballs. They were a hit. Next time I want to add some worcestershire sauce for a little kick. I like quick and easy meals, this is a topper, for sure!! Also, used a lowfat spray-on olive oil, for the pans.

They took longer to cook then expected, and were a little dry. Next time I will use more seasoning, and make sure everything is timed better.

I was looking for a meatball recipe to "knock my socks off," but this was not it.  First of all, I had a hard time finding ground turkey that was 7% fat.  Had to use 5% instead.  Then it just didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped, even though I added 2 Tbsp. Parmesan cheese, 2 cloves minced garlic, some extra Italian herbs, salt and black pepper.  My husband thought it was just so-so.  My son ate all his pasta, but only 2 bites of meatball...unusual.  I might try to make it again, but will definitely use lean ground beef instead of turkey.

This needed some flavor, even though I added some of the herbs mentioned in other reviews I still think it lacked flavor. These held together perfectly and were easy to make so I'll make them again and keep playing with the spices!

So simple but absolutely delicious with very minow tweaks. Adding water is a must to get the breadcrumb/egg mixture blended well with the meat and it also keeps them very moist. I only added garlic powder but you could add any seasoning you like. I have doubled the recipe and mixed 99% lean with the fattier ground turkey and it works well. You definitely need some fat.

Not that it needs another 5 star review, but I have to say this recipe delivers as advertised.  These are fast and they are friendly in my belly! :)
Yummy and easy.  Make these when you do your next spaghetti night, they are so much better than the ready made frozen ones.

This were fast and friendly like the title states, but needs a bit of a kick.  I would add some herbs and spices to it, probably some parsley, pepper and oregano.  All in all, a good basic recipe that can easily be added on to.

I used this recipe to break in some new bakeware and the meatballs didn't brown that much but the flavor was great.  I added some ground Italian seasoning along with the sage, onion & garlic powders.  Fast AND friendly!

These were great, but I think that maybe they need a little something- dried herbs maybe. They also may taste better with darker meat- I used breast meat. Still we loved these. We ate them in a garden blend spaghetti sauce on fettuccine. I used the leftovers for meatball sandwiches- yum!

Great recipe .. tasty, easy and figure friendly too! I added a little more bread crumbs as mine seemed too "wet". Also added 1 minced clove of garlic, 1/4 yellow onion very finely diced, 1 tsp worcheshire sauce and S & P.  Awesome!

These were great! Quick, easy, and tasty.  Not at all difficult to make - the kids can even help roll meatballs so long as they wash their hands really well before/after. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and super easy. I used 7%-fat ground turkey, and added garlic salt, dried oregano, pepper, and parmesan cheese to the italian bread-crumb mixture.

I made the revisions SandraM suggested.  This was very good - and healthy, too.  I also topped the meatballs with marinara and parmesan cheese and popped it back in the oven for a few minutes before serving.

Definitely listen when they say to NOT use 99% fat free turkey, it was really dry, even with added egg/water.  However, it helped when I put the leftover meatballs in spaghetti sauce overnight.  The meatballs the next day were much better.  I added some garlic powder and chopped onions too.

So quick and tasty!
I added parm cheese and turned the oven up to 400 degrees for more crispy meatballs for the last 5 mins.
My husband usually doesn't like turkey but he LOVED THEM!

These meatballs are quite good.  I make them a lot because they are relatively fast & easy.  I add a bit of water and parmesan cheese as suggested by others.  I have tried this both with lean hamburger and lean turkey (7% fat), and I prefer the turkey preparation...better consistency.  Make sure you make the meatballs no larger than golfballs; in my first batch they were too big and didn't cook through.  Thanks for sharing this one!

These are great! We love using turkey instead of beef and this is a easy and tasty recipe. I added a few seasonings (onion and garlic powders and Italian seasoning.)I had to bake them a little longer because I think my meatballs were larger than the recipe intended (I ended up with 10). Thanks! This one is a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made it with ground chuck and ground turkey.  We prefer the turkey.  I made it with lower fat white meat turkey with excellent results. I just added about 1/4 cup of water.  I also add a couple of TBSP of grated parmesan and I use the italian seasoned bread crumbs.  We like them with whole wheat spagetti and Paul Newmans Sockarooni spagetti sauce.  They are also excellent leftovers.

I liked the overall flavor of these meatballs, but they were still pretty bland even though I added worcestershire, ketchup, bbq sauce, spices, salt, pepper, garlic, etc to them....   I think I will try them again using half lean turkey and half sweet italian turkey sausage.  This was great for freezing- I'll review again the next time I try it.

I added all types of extra seasoning and can't imagine them tasty if I hadn't done so. The great thing is you can add your own flavor. Good luck.

we liked them! i'd definitely add some onions and seasoning next time. i used ground beef, and it was fine. but when i heated up the greased pan, it smoked up my house a little. probably won't do that again, either.
other than that, they were great.

Foolproof. I lost track of time while cooking them, they were in the oven for 40 minutes and still didn't dry out. I did add some stuff to the mixture (garlic, parmesean and fresh basil) but its a great basic recipe that you can't mess up.

This is a good recipe to make with children.  I made them with a 3-year-old and we just used our hands to mix the ingredients.  I added some oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary and parmesan cheese.  These were quick to make and everybody liked them.

Adaptable and delicious!  As many other people here, I altered the recipe to add some more spices, garlic and onion.  They were perfect with spaghetti, and then the leftovers were excellent on french bread with barbeque sauce.  Never again will my husband eat a meatball sub from subway.  I was very surprised with how well they turned out, considering how easy they were to make.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Giving this 5 stars because the kids ate it all.  They were kind of bland for me.  If you are looking for a good kid friendly dinner this is it plus it is easy to make.  I just put them on pasta and added some marinara sauce.

I added parmesan cheese, but next time would add more spices.  They were good, but a little bland.

Fast and Friendly is the perfect name. I added 1/4 Cup parmesan cheese and used my premeasured cookie scooper instead of an ice cream scoop. Great recipe thanks for sharing.

Have to give top rating! Very simple recipe, and my 5 yo loved! He told me I could make these every night. He actually ate four of these. I can say that has never happened. My others liked as well, so you can bet I will be making again! Thanks!

This were so good, and so easy. I like that it used turkey, so we could cut out some of the fat. I will make these again.

The meatballs were leaner than I like.  And while I enjoyed the tang in the sauce, I thought it was too sweet.

This simple recipe was fabulous! My toddler and husband both loved it.They were good with rice and a mushroom gravy, as well as mixed with alfredo pasta.

Next time I'm going to add soem garlic for kick.

These were great. I don't cook much my husband does almost all the cooking and he was amazed when I made these. I added a little minced garlic and onion to spice it up. Taste great and very quick and simple to make!!!

Very good recipe though I did add a diced onion, can of mushrooms cut into pieces, onion soup mix, and some worcheshire sauce. Very, very yummy. Wish I didn't tell my hubby it was turkey though now he won't eat it. My kids and I loved them though.

Good foundation recipe for meatballs.  I used beef, and added garlic powder, onion flakes, and because I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, I added Emeril Italian seasonings.  They turned out great. I made them for Halloween with spaghetti and spaghetti sauce, and added a green olive for an "eyeball" effect.  They were a hit at the pot luck!  Thanks.

I was very pleased with the end result and so the rest of my family. I just added some vegeta spice and made it with plain bread crumbs, I did not have the italian. Also I added finely choped onion and some chives. We loved it.

Very quick and easy. I did add a little milk to help keep them moist. My 16 month old son loved them. I ended up adding them to bow-tie pasta & alfredo sauce. Will make again.

just started a diet and made these meatballs.  Only 57  calories apiece.  I added garlic powder for just a little kick.

Easy and yummy! I used plain breadcrumbs with dry italian seasoning, that's what I had. Next time I'll use italian crumbs, my dry seasoning had too much rosemary for my taste. This is such a good basic recipe to add things to. It was great for my kids just the way it was though! I'll be using this again!

I made these with regular bread crumbs and italian seasoning, after baking tossed in my spagetti sauce in the slow cooker all afternoon. These were fantastic and  so tender, never would have known they were turkey!!
Delish!!
