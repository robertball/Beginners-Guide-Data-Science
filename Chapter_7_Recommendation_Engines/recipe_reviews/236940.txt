good pancakes, i typically just do boxed gluten free pancakes but i decided to step outside the box and try something different. i cooked these on low to keep them from burning, the first one i cooked on medium-high and it turned black. thats the only change i made and the rest were pretty good.

Instead of using a banana, I used organic unsweetened applesauce and added some cinnamon. Instead of adding bacon bits to mix, we ate the bacon on the side, but I cooked the pancakes in the bacon grease. Both my 12 year old and 22 year old LOVED them! I also just put all ingredients in a bowl and mixed with a wisk, to keep it slightly lumpy, which is what makes pancakes fluffy. I made the pancakes pretty thick and next time I will make them thinner to get more even cooking (I'm still just learning to cook with coconut flour.) I will definitely be making these again!

I found this recipe to have a rather "flat" flavor, even with the bacon.  It is important that they be cooked on low heat so they don't burn.
