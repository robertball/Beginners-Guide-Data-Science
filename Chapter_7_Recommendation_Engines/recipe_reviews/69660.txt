These were pretty good pork chops.  I would have liked if they were a bit more tender, so I think next time I will simmer them in the broth, soy sauce, and vinegar longer until they are fork tender, before thickening and finishing the sauce.  The sauce for this was awesome!  The recipe makes a lot of sauce, so I served extra at the table for dipping because it was just too good to waste!

My family and I thought this was a bit bland. I'll make it again but will season the chops with garlic, salt, pepper, and maybe ginger and perhaps saute them in butter. Five minutes per side didn't give my chops a very appealing color, so I'll probably saute them till they're golden brown. As another reveiwer stated, this will ensure more tender chops.

Excellent dish! I added some pineapple chunks to the last step as well. It gave it more flavor and made it more appealing! Easy to make! I loved it!

Overall this dish was good!  Personally I think the sauce had to much of a soy taste.  I would have liked it a little sweeter.  I will make this again and just not add as much soy.

I have a hard time getting my family to eat pork chops, but they loved them prepared this way.  I took others' suggestions and cut down the soy sauce to 1 1/2 Tbs. and used crushed pineapple instead of pineapple juice.  Next time I think I will cut the pork into pieces ahead of time and make it more like a stir fry.

I used a little less soy and added pineapple chunks per others' recommendations.  I also added some vegs to round out the meal...some red & green pepper strips I had leftover from a salad and a can of water chestnuts.  I also went easy on the brown sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet.   It was easy to make and not messy.  My husband liked it a lot, I liked it fine, my older daughter thought it was okay, and my finicky little one at least ate it.  It's not something I would like to eat often, but it's good occasionally.  The leftovers were fine the next day. My only real complaint is that the chops were not very tender.

Fantastic! We loved it, my husband couldn't stop complimenting me. I used pork tenderloin slices, and a small can of pineapple chunks with that juice. Other than that I did everything else according to the recipe. Oh ya and I added garlic as others suggested. I'll be making this regularly! Thank you Breanna!!

I used more pineapple juice and added ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  It turned out great and I think the seasonings helped.  We both loved it!  Makes a good amount of sauce and is perfect over rice.

Not bad at all, but it could use a little tweaking to make it an awesome dish.  The meat needed a little more cook time, about 15 minutes more.  I was out of soy sauce and substituted worcestershire sauce, which moved it further into the realm of sweet, but it was still good.  It needed something zippy, though: cayenne pepper or garlic next time.

I followed the recipe - except I doubled it since I had 8 pork chops (not boneless).  I also had some fresh pineapple that I sliced and added to the top of the pork chops.  We found, even with the pineapple slices there was almost no pineapple flavor in the sauce.  The soy sauce overpowered everything which would be great except I was expecting more of a pineapple flavor.  Maybe a different brand/type of pineapple juice would increase the flavor.

Fantastic! I used with fresh pineapple which added additional flavor. The pork chops were very tender and flavorful. I sprinkled with some garlic salt and pepper while simmering. Loved the sauce on top of brown rice! I will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious dish! However, per the suggestion of other reviewers, I sauteed the pork chops (which I sliced into smaller pieces) with garlic, salt, pepper, and a tiny bit of butter in olive oil until they were golden brown instead of just for five minutes. The pork chops were nice and tender as a result. I think next time I might try adding some onions too!

The sauce is what makes this recipe. I used it to go over sliced pork tenderloin. The only thing I did differently was to use a small can of crushed pineapple instead of just the juice. There was lots left to top the rice I made as well!

Very easy to make.  My kids asked for seconds and thirds - I ran out of food.  The sauce turned out great.  I added pineapple chunks at the end as well.  Will be making again.

I made this for my boyfriend and my mother and both of them loved it!  My boyfriend keeps asking me when I'm going to make it again.  I served it with white rice and added some green and red peppers, as well as some onions and chunks of pineapple to the sauce which added a wonderful tastey touch.

We loved the sauce! I added some pineapple tidbits for added texture. Try and buy a thin cut of pork chop for its tenderness.

This was just OK. I made it at first exactly as stated, then tasted it. The sauce was pretty bland. I added more brown sugar, ginger and the remaining pineapple juice I had (probably about 1/3 cup) and it got better. The pork chops did come out tough, as others have stated. Served it with rice and a frozen veggie mix and it was pretty good, except the tough meat. If I ever make this again, I'll be sure to sautee and season the chops so they're tender and flavorful. Serving with peppers and onions would add to the flavor as well.

As others did I reduced the soy sauce to 1.5 tbs and I sprinkled in some garlic powder. I also tossed in a can of pineapple chunks during the last step. Overall, this was very tasty, and a bit tangy. Reminiscent of a sweet and sour Chinese dish with a pineapple flavor instead of an orangey one. My husband said he really liked it but wouldn't want to eat it all the time, and that sounds about right to me!

Needs cracked black pepper! But other than that it was simple to make and tasted good over rice.

I used some fresh pineapple I needed to use. Cut into chunks, and after sauteing chops, I browned the pineapple in the pan/drippings.   Sampling proved a bit bland taste. Added a pinch of ginger, garlic and onion powder, as well as minimal salt and pepper.  Instead of pineapple juice, since I was using fresh, I used some cider I had.   My hubby likes sweet and sour, so I threw in some sliced green pepper to tender-crisp just before serving and a chopped fresh tomato, about 5 minutes. Did serve with rice. GREAT!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut up the chops into bite size pieces before placing them back into the finished sauce, and added pineapple chunks with the juice. I served with asian vegetable mix and white rice. DELISH!! Hubby loved it!

We loved this recipe and it's so so easy! I watched over my 10 yr old as she created this very tasty dish! We did modify it. We sprinkled the pork chops with cajun spice before cooking give it a little "kick" and we added pineapple chunks to the sauce in the final step.  Served it with Almond Rice Pilaf and green beans. We will definately make this again!

Made this for hubby...wanted something new other than our regular pork.  I couldn't eat it...(pregnancy has made my tastebuds go crazy), but hubby liked it.  Said it was just a bit too sweet.  I will make again, but tinker a little to suit our tastes.  Thanks for the post.

Used boneless country style ribs to make recipe instead of chops.  Also, put chunk pineapple and diced up half a red bell pepper for some color...thanks for sharing this, Breanna20...it's a keeper in my household!

The pork chops were pretty bland. I seasoned them with salt, pepper, and a little ginger before browning in butter. For the rest I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was delicious! But it didn't thicken up much, so it just ran off the pork chops and I couldn't get the flavor to "stick". And the sauce was really the only flavor to these pork chops.

Tasty sauce although I had to sweeten it and thicken it up a bit for my family's taste buds. I wish I could learn how to keep pork tender...any stove top recipe ends up tough. Hubby liked enough that he plans to take leftovers to work tomorrow.

Really tasty, I ended up adding pineapple to the top of the pork chops when I served them, which I think tied the meal together nicely.

These were excellent.  I'm from louisiana and usually wish I would have added more spices after I try a recipe, so this time I just did the first go round.  I salt and peppered the chops was all but cooked them slowly by simmering in the broth due to many complaints about dry chops from other reviews.  They were just right.  I also added pineapple chunks and sliced onion to the sauce.. amazing!

Cooked the chops well, they were pretty juicy, but the sauce was kinda bland.  Perhaps some spicy with the sweet next time.

I added ginger and browned pork chops a bit longer than recommended.  Used light soy sauce.  I had canned pineapple chunks in which I used the juice in the sauce and had the chunks on the side with rice.  The sauce was very good.  Next time will try it with fresh pineapple.

This was yummy!  I had tenderized chops, so being tender wasnt an issue but I did cook it in the gravy in an attempt to further enhance the flavor.  I thought I had soy, but didn't so I used teriyaki.  I added crushed pineapple instead of juice.  There was alot of gravy and while rice would have been good, I was in the mood for mashed tators and the gravy was even good on tators :-)

The sauce this produce was delicious. The only thing I do different is cook the chop longer and grill it.  I've made it over a dozen times per the husbands request. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was very average for us.  We enjoyed it but will probably never make it again.  The sauce was disappointing.  Wished I would of added some garlic as others suggested.  I did add some pineapply chunks but still thought it lacked in flavor.  Thanks!

I think the sauce might have been the factor that ruined this for me. This promised to be a delicious meal right up until the end, where it turned out to be pretty awful. It was salty and sweet and tangy all at the same time, only not in a good way (though I realize that does sound pretty good). I can't explain it. Maybe I did something  wrong :(

This was quick, easy and tasted amazing!  I grilled some slices of pineapple and added them when I added the pineapple juice mixture.  I also grilled the pork chops on the griddle grill instead of heating them in the pan.  It gave them great grill marks and made them more tender then the 5 min. in the pan. The sauce made enough to cover the chops and anything else we wanted to!The kids loved it!

This is a good basic recipe to build on.  I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, added freshly ground black pepper and a generous dusting of powdered ginger as the chops were browning.  I also doubled the time I simmered the chops because I like pork to be fork tender.  Put pineapple rings on top of chops toward end of cooking time.  Best of all, I have sauce left over to use on top of stir-fried chicken!

This was a great dish! VERY easy and very tasty. I hate overly sweet pork. This is perfect. As others have mentioned, I also added pineapple chunks to the last step. It really gave it that extra "yum." I served mine with some veggies (carrot/broccoli/cauliflower frozen mix). It probably is awesome with rice, though. I was out at the time :)

I'll be making this again! Thanks!

Since it was only for myself, I used 2 pork chops that were specially bought at 1 inch think.

Didn't use brown sugar, couldn't see opening a plastic bg for for the amount needed, only to have it dry rock hard. I substituted dark honey for sweetness, used red wine vinegar instead of the white.  

I also used 1/2 of a tangerine sectioned, seeds removed and cut each segment into 3 or 4 chunks.

After the chops were fried, I poured off the oil and butter mix and deglassed the pan with the chicken-pineapple juice, added the chops back and added the pineapple chunks and added rinsed water chestnuts. set to simmer and covered the pan.

Diffently a keeper! I only had 3 pork chops but still kept all the ingredients the same except I added a lil bit more brown sugar at the end. Plus I added some pineapple chunks which was a great add! I put the sauce over some rice and made a quick, easy and good meal. Maybe next time I will throw in a few more vegatables.. Thanks.

This was a great sauce to go with pork chops and rice.  I added chuncks of pineapples as well as finely chopped red peppers to add some texture.  Great flavor!

No one ate these...this says a lot on my house. I used a poorer cut of pork too..on the bone, however they still turned out really tough with little flavor. I think a more intense sweet and sour flavor would improve the taste - along with using a thicker cut of boneless pork chop and baking instead of frying.

I goofed and added way too much oil, forgetting the sauce wouldn't work out in the end!  But they tasted good anyway.

Turned out better then I expected! Has a sweet, bbq flavor. My Uncle loved them -- they didn't affect his heartburn at all.

Had pinneapple juice that I had to get rid of so I thought I'd try this.  It was easy - and I thought it was just ok and was going to give it 3 stars.  My guy LOVED it though - so taking his vote into consideration - I'll rate it 4 stars. It made a lot of sauce and it was good to drizzle over rice.

I read all the reviews first but unfortunately the suggestions didn't help. Even my own changes didn't seem to make a difference. Very bland. Not sweet enough. For some reason you can't even taste the pineapple. Tough, even though I soaked them in Kosher salt for three hours prior  to cooking. I wouldn't use this recipe again. Sorry!

This is my new favorite way to prepare pork chops.  The chops come out  moist and tender and the sauce is delicious on the rice.  I added some pineapple chunks to the sauce and it was the perfect addition.

I used coconut oil to brown the meat instead of olive oil and cubed the boneless porkchops instead. I used only half of the amount of soy sauce. It was really good. I also used only a half a cup of pineapple juice and put chunks of pineapple in the mixture. Would definitely make this again!

Very good!  I mixed everything up and baked the whole thing in the oven at 375 for 25-30 minutes. I omitted the oil, added a dash of garlic salt and used an 8 oz can of undrained crushed pineapple instead of just plain juice. Baking them slow in all the liquid made the chops very tender & juicy.  Served over sticky white rice.  Hubby said add to the rotation!

So yummy! It was a hit for the whole family! I used 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp teriyaki sauce, and I also used crushed pineapples with juice. Other than that, I followed the recipe. This one is a keeper for sure!

This is a great recipe! I did make some changes that were suggested by others. Salt, pepper and ginger seasoning before pan frying with olive oil and a little butter in skillet. I cooked longer to get more coloring then transferred to baking dish. Deglazed with chicken stock and followed recipe except I added sauce to baking dish and put in a preheated oven at 450 for 37 min. I did use center cut that was thin so if using thicker cut may take longer. While cooking in oven I prepped skillet (no heat) with a medium sized can of pineapple chunks in juice, brown sugar and cornstarch. I did use extra cornstarch but I think I had extra liquid. After chops were cooked I removed chops from dish and scraped all liquid into the skillet and warmed together till thick. I did add a half a tablespoon of butter to the sauce to make it shine then transferred everything to the baking dish to serve at the table. Yum! The whole family loved it.

I always modify a receipe a bit when I cook. After I seared the pork, I added it to the boiling chicken stock mixture. I then put the pork back in and let it summer for more like 30 minutes, it came out so tender! I also added extra pineapple juice than listed, and threw in crushed pineapple and cubed pineapple into the simmering pot T the end. My guests asked me to bottle it and sell it!!

Made this for dinner tonight - very yummy! Served with rice. As other reviewers suggested, I adjusted the recipe using less soy sauce, adding crushed pineapple, and more brown sugar. I also used rice vinegar & let the pork chops brown in step 1 way longer than called for. It made plenty of sauce even though I used 6 pork chops instead of 4. Definetly would make again!

I like to make the recipes as is the first time then tweak it to our tastes. This could use some salt, pepper or other seasoning on the pork before cooking. The sauce was good, and would definitely be tasty with pineapple chunks and veggies like carrots, broccoli and water chestnuts.

These were o.k.  I'd give them a 3+ if I could. They weren't too sweet, but I just felt like they were missing something.  Definitely agree with others about simmering longer for a more tender bite.  Maybe these would benefit from marinating in the sauce overnight.   I'll try it again, but for now I'm saying they're just ok.

Very tasty and super easy to make.  We used pineapple-orange juice since that's what we had, and it turned out great.  Not too sweet.  It also makes A LOT of sauce, which went great over our brown rice and steamed veggies.  I saved the leftover sauce and plan to try it over pasta tomorrow night. We'll definitely make this again.

I have nearly no cooking skill, and I was able to make this for myself and 4 very hungry, very picky guys! I'm making it again tonight and my boyfriend can't wait to get off work just because of this recipe! I used fried rice instead and pour the sauce over everything. I think I'm going to try this again with ham next time! Thanks again, it is wonderful!

This recipe was delicious!! Even my boyfriend loved it and he's a fussy eater. I took the tip of adding the chunks of pineapple, but we both agreed we didn't care for it so I will omit it next time. We had leftover the next day and the sauce was even more flavorful. Thank you for the great recipe!

I followed the suggestions of some of the others:  I cut the pork chops into chunks; seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and ginger; used 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce and pineapple chunks.  The pork was a bit tough, and the sauce was bland. I don't think I'll be making this again.

Love this recipe!  Easy to make and it requires ingredients that I already had.  I made it and the only changes that I would recommend is seasoning the pork when you brown it.  I used salt, pepper, and roasted garlic seasoning.  In addition, I added some grilled pineapple to the sauce and it was wonderful.  I would recommend this recipe.

Great recipe! I followed it as written except for the pineapple juice. I had fresh pineapple that I cut into small chunks but I didn't get much juice so I sqeezed an orange that I had, for the juice.

All of us really liked the sauce, but the pork chops were a little tough.  Thank you for your recipe.

This was such a great change of pace for my pork chops.  Easy and sauce was wonderful.  I added crushed pineapple served over rice as suggested.  Perfect!

This was okay. I thought there was way too much soy sauce in it. Might make again without so much soy sauce and add in pineapple chunks.

This recipe was quick and easy. When I started making this I thought I had pineapple, but I had to use canned pears. My husband said the pears were the best part of the dish. I also added red onion, fresh pepper, ginger, and garlic. The pork did turn out dry, as I expected only because that was what others had wrote. How do I fix that? Wish I knew. Will I make it again? Maybe.

I just thought it was soooo delicious.  My family enjoyed it so much.  The sauce for this recipe is so good I may even use it with chicken.  It would also make a good sauce for stir fry!

One of the best dishes I've ever made! I loved how different it was from what I usually have. I added pineapple chunks and a frozen blend of peppers and onions. Absolutely fantastic!

I fixed this recipe last night for my husband and 2 teens.  They loved it!  I used boneless porkchops and cubed them before cooking and I used crushed pineapple.  Worked great.  I added the cubed meat to the pineapple mixture after it thickened up and was fantastic over some rice.  Served mine with steamed veggies.  We have ratings in our house that we use and this one fell under "keeper", thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I did the following different. I dredged the pork in flour mixed with cinnamon before browing the chicken.  After I browned the chicken, I cooked a half can of pineapple chunks over med heat for 2-3 minutes and set aside.  I followed the rest of the recipe except that I added then the cooked pineapple to the sauce mixture after it had boiled. Hubby loved!!

My family of 4 gave mixed reviews for this recipe.  I thought it was fabulous.  My oldest daughter didn't even want to eat it.  My husband and youngest daughter both said it was just OK.  I guess this recipe is a matter of taste buds.  It was kind of like sweet and sour, which I love and my daughter dislikes.  If you like sweet and sour, you'll love this.

This was an okay weeknight dinner, but no one really loved it. I did reduce the soy sauce and added pineapple chunks, but it really did not do much for the recipe. I don't think I will make it again. Not bad, just not our taste.

This recipe is only "ok".  The pork was a little tough. The sauce was a little rich. I made two changes. I put one tablespoon of soy sauce instead of two, and I used crused pineapple. It was very easy to make.

This was good, but I think next I will marinate the pork chops first .. the taste of the sauce which was good.. the pork didn't seem to pick up.  I used crushed pineapple to give it some texture.

Guess I'm in the minority here, but no one in my house would eat these.  My 5 yr. old (who LOVES pork chops) wouldnt touch them.  My hubby, who usually has something positive to say about every recipe I try, couldn't finish his.  My mom, who loves not only pineapple and pork, but asian food as well asked me to please never make them again.  Sorry to be so negative, but we this was neither sweet nor sour, just....wrong somehow.

Very nice. Used crushed Pineapples. Didn't cook for quite as long. I guess it depends on the thickness of your pork chops. Definitely doing it again!!!

This was good for a quick, easy supper for my husband and I, but not company fare.  I added pineapple chunks like other reviewers, and I think that was a positive change.  Thanks for the post.
