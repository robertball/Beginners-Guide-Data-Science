Very good.  But a bit rubbery the first time around.  The second time I added 1/2 tsp baking powder and they fluffed up - rubbery texture GONE.  I mix up the spices sometimes.  Even with the sodium content of the cottage cheese I still add about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt to improve the flavor.  I use whole eggs to avoid waste.  I also blend the oatmeal FIRST to make it more flour-like.  I remove the oatmeal flour, then blend the wet ingredients and add the oatmeal back in a little at a time so it doesn't stick in blobs around the edges.

Loved these waffles! I used 4 whole eggs instead of wasting 3 egg yolks (just a personal preference). I would do a few things differently next time though... I put the oats into the blender first, which made it hard to mix, so I would put the oats in last. The waffles didn't stick in my cast iron waffle maker like other reviewers said, but they also didn't rise much. next time I'd add some baking powder to give them a little more fluff. Great recipe! Thanks :)

I had all the ingredients, and must say these were a change from the usual waffle. I liberally sprayed my waffle iron with non-stick spray, and they still stuck (even though the waffle iron itself is a non-stick waffle iron) - how I managed a picture I'm not sure, but these waffles need some help to prevent them from turning into a lego style waffle.

Excellent recipe. I followed a couple of recommendations of others by adding 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder to the batter. I also mixed all in my food processor. I ground the oatmeal to a flour consistency first, removed it from the processor and added the baking soda and baking powder to it. I then mixed the remaining ingredients and added back the dry. Results were a crisp on the outside, tender on the inside waffle!

I have made these one hundred times as a meal prep for weekly breakfasts. 

The first time I made them as directed and they were good. This is a great recipe to tweak. 

The following million times I have made this have been much different. 

First, I blend two cups of oats in my food processor so that it becomes flour-like. I then pour that into a bowl for a minute while I mix everything else into the food processor. I use: 4 whole eggs, Teaspoon each of baking soda and powder, Whole tub of store brand fat free pineapple cottage cheese, Splash vanilla, Pinch cinnamon, 2 TBS turmeric , 3-4 scoops FurtherFood collagen peptides, 2-3 TBS chia seeds 

I blend all of that together and then add the oat-flour back in and mix again. 

This makes 10 waffles- enough for my boyfriend and I each to have one until I make them again. I usually eat mine with peanut butter and a sliced banana on top; sometimes drizzled with maple syrup. 

Thank you for this recipe- sorry I hacked it all up! STILL GREAT!

Love them! I made this for my husband, and just told him it was a new recipe (but didn't tell him they were healthy or what was in them).  He said they were good and gobbled them up.  This will be a new addition to our breakfast rotation! I added a little baking soda, and they were fluffy and crispy.  I sprayed the waffle iron and they came right out with no problems.

Following the advice of other reviewers I blended the oats first and removed them. I added the 1/4 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder to the oats. Then I processed the wet ingredients, added the oats back in and blended for a few minutes. These are fantastic! It is hard to find a good protein pancake or waffle recipe, so this has gone immediately into my "Keeper" pile!

The basic recipe is great, I played with it a bit and now I have the best tasting protein waffles I ever made with a nice waffle like texture, not so rubber like the usual protein pastries.

I replaced the cottage cheese by 2 % fat greek joghurt (200g), increased honey to 20 g, added 30 g of vanilla whey protein and 1/2 package of baking powder. Makes 6 waffles with my maker with 147kcal each ( 13 g protein, 4 g fat, 14 g carbs).

Five stars simply because my anti-healthy kids love  these waffles.  Not for waffles and peanut butter, my kids would perish so they know their waffles.  I've tried other sneaky chef recipes and my kids were on to it.  These waffles work like a charm.  Thank you!!!!

Excellent healthy recipe for high protein, low fat, and great taste. I used 3 whole eggs and 2 whites. I added 1/4tsp baking powder.

So yummy! My kids love them! They are really versatile. I have made them a few times. Most recently I didn’t have enough cottage cheese so I subbed some Greek yogurt to make up the difference. Sometimes I also add a teaspoon of baking powder to make them a bit fluffier. They are good as written, though.

My husband doesn’t know there’s cottage cheese in here! We will keep it that way. He is literally pickier than a 2 year old, so I need to find ways to sneak certain foods into his system. This is one! THANK YOU!

I was surprised this had such high ratings, then I read some reviews. The first five I read made significant changes to this recipe and then rated it highly. I made it as writted, and it’s very bland.  Also note that it says it serves 3, which is odd but true.

I was looking for a healthy recipe and could count the WW points.  This is awesome!  High protein means it's filling too.  A serving is 4 points by my calculation.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder and used whole eggs.  I would add a pinch of salt next time, just as I add a pinch of salt when I make oatmeal.  

The instructions for my waffle maker said to use 1/4 cup but as these do not raise or spread out as much, you will want to increase the amount of batter.

I've made it twice now, once as waffles and once as pancakes. Most awesome recipe. Healthy and tasty. I used the recommendation from other reviews and added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and dash-1/4 tap of salt. I used almond extract once and it was tasty.

one member of family just went gluten free. This recipe is inexpensive enough that I can make it for the whole fam. I used quick oats, 1/2 yogurt, and 3 whole eggs. I also added 1 teas baking powder.  turned out really good. we love the tang the yogurt gave. made a little over 2 cups of batter.

These are a really good protein waffle. I too added baking powder to fluff them up. I also made them with a jack o’ lantern face for Halloween. Who says healthy can’t be fun?!

I can't believe how AMAZING these taste!! I'll admit when I mixed everything up and I could see the cottage cheese pieces I thought - no way is this going to be good. I mean, I like a Belgian waffle as much as the next person, I'm not like a protein pancake aficionado I just want to watch my calories - but these are GREAT. They taste like French toast. I did use a light syrup because I have a sweet tooth, but I do think some fruit for a topping would also be fine.

I made these as a healthier alternative to plain waffles for my toddler grandchildren (ages 2 1/2 and 4).  I added sprinkles to the top before closing the waffle iron.  Next time I will just stir the sprinkles into the batter right before cooking.  They are heavy but with the cottage cheese and eggs, that is to be expected.  I used four whole eggs instead of separating them.  These were great.  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out great!  Very simple, few ingredients, and much more flavor than regular waffles.  Even my husband loved them!  We were thinking we'd mix it up some next time and add more fall flavors. I may add some pumpkin. I think they could be awesome with some fine grated (and squeezed very dry) zucchini.  Awesome Recipe! Thank you!

I absolutely love these waffles! They are a staple in my healthy breakfast repertoire now. It's great that you can get the yummy waffle that you love without any unhealthy ingredients. I top with some thawed mixed berries :)

I did what the first reviewer said and was very happy with the results.  I thought they would taste funny given the ingredients, but they tasted pretty normal and good other than have a little eggy texture, which wasn't a bad thing.  The only additional thing I did was add a little salt so it wouldn't be bland.  Just what I needed after a morning workout!

These were excellent! I made them as pancakes, added about a tsp of olive oil, a couple dashes of nutmeg, and voila! Ok, ok... they're not as wonderful as regular pancakes, but the protein packed into these babies make up for that. ??

Delicious and super easy to make!! My girls absolutely loved them :) my trick: I use almond extract instead of vanilla and added nutmeg too.

decent waffle, tasted a little on the eggy side but I definitely a non issue when considering the protein in just one serving.  I didn't have the same sticking issue as the previous reviewer.   thanks for this recipe, it's so hard to find a high protein breakfast food that you can meal prep in advance.
