I used Truvia instead of white sugar and Trop 50 brand orange juice. My family loved these carrots and I literally could not stop eating them. VERY tasty. NOTE: I had a serving and a half leftover this morning that I made into a Carrot-Banana Smoothie.......just as great in my smoothie, lemme tell you.

Very good side dish and quick to prepare. I used Splenda and will bump up the amount of ginger next time just because I liked that flavor in this. The OJ and the ginger work together nicely in this recipe. Thanks, larkspur, this is a keeper.***UPDATE 6.9.18: This is one of our favorite carrot side dishes, it just never fails. I increase the amount of ginger a bit, and I cut them vertically into long pieces (just like the presentation a little better). Quick, easy, and always a winner!

I made this tonight to go with my roast pork... and it turned out wonderful, I did change one ingredient which was instead of sugar, I put in honey. Added the ginger to taste as well ... think it ended up being about half a tsp... Wonderful recipe and it's going to be a part of turkey dinners of the future!

This was GREAT! Easy, fast, delicious, healthful; this is a winner.  I made a few minimal changes:  I left out the sugar (felt like between the sweetness of the orange juice and the sweetness of the carrots, it was redundant) and didn't miss it at all.  And the sauce was very thick so I added a little more juice.  Otherwise, made it exactly as written.  The flavor is wonderful -- lightly tart, lightly sweet, with a generous hint of ginger but the ginger is nicely balanced by the orange juice.  Family loved it, I loved it ... I'll be making this again, soon and often.  Thanks for posting!

Too much butter.  This was an interesting change to the brown sugared carrots and I liked the citrus flavor. Thanks for the recipe though.

So simple and yet so great. Sauce is thick so we just added more orange juice. Lovely taste.

Carrots with Orange Concentrate juice has been in my family for years (I keep a can in the freezer).... use about a tablespoon or two depending amount of carrots.  Adding Ginger or lemon or your favorite spice or butter is even better.  I may try to mix the juices  and spice in a sauce pan, add a tad of corn starch to thicken it and the pour over carrots on serving dish.

Delicious recipe. I made it with the butter in at the beginning, turned out nice and creamy. As well, I added grated ginger to add an additional flavour. The ginger and orange really complimented one another in this dish.

A little disappointing. I liked the little flavor I could taste, but it just didn't come across. Maybe because I used fresh squeezed oj and fresh ginger? I'll try it again with normal oj and extra, extra fresh ginger and see if that helps.

This recipe deserves a lot more attention. It is super easy and tastes great! It uses simple Farmer's Market ingredients. I adapt it to my low-carb diabetic diet (using Splenda instead of sugar) & it still tastes great. I suggest using more orange juice than called for -- 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup. (Squeeze it fresh & add a little zest for more flavor) The ground ginger adds a nice bite. I steam rather than boil carrots. And don't skip the butter!

I used baby carrots to save on time, and substituted apple cider for the orange juice, thinking it would add more of a fall flavor for Thanksgiving.  Couldn't taste it much--they came out mostly buttery.  Probably better with orange juice.
