Made this exactly as the recipe indicted and was very disappointed. It was spicy, but dry. It really needs a sauce. We tried dipping it in a honey ginger BBQ sauce.

I played around with this and added some teriyaki sauce--the amount of marinade didn't really cover the tofu, so I also added more lime and soy sauce.  It turned out relatively well, but a bit too salty--probably all that teriyaki and soy sauce I added.  I wonder if tripling the lime juice would be best.  Not bad, for a tofu recipe--it does add flavor to the tofu!  thanks for the recipe.

I made this, but based on reviews made a few additions and it turned out really good. I think they scaled this recipe too small when they wrote it out. I used zest from 1 lime, but juice from 2 limes and added slightly more soy sauce. It was good. I really like cilantro so I added little more than what it asked for and slightly more olive oil.

I thought this was good. I added Worcestershire a lot more cilantro, lime & cayenne. I will make again.

Tasted great. For the non-cooks complaining, you need to adjust the measurements to your liking, like you would with any recipe.
