I used canola/olive oil and Madras curry (the hot kind), and I didn't peel the carrots or sweet potatoes. But otherwise followed the recipe. It was so bland that I needed to add granulated garlic and A LOT of Herbamare (Zesty) to bring it to my taste. Next time, I will double the curry - half Madras and half the regular kind - and keep a bottle of hot sauce nearby.

I loved the soup. It was quick and easy to make, and so nutritious.

I made it as written, then tasted it.  The soup was a little bland. It may have been that my carrots were not sweet enough. I added a little more ginger and some cinnamon to warm the soup up. I will make it again as written.

This smelled and tasted wonderful! I doubled the recipe, used vegetable broth, and added salt.

Excellent soup as is!  Even my daughter who has professed to not liking sweet potatoes was surprised to hear that it was one of the main ingredients!  Will be making it to serve prior to the Thanksgiving turkey!

I really like this tasty healthy soup.   I substituted some canned  sweet potatoes.  I wanted a little texture to the soup so I didnt puree it i just used a potato masher to smooth it out a little.

Fabulous flavor!  I added an extra sweet potato since the original soup seemed a bit thin....garnished it with a dollop of sour cream & red pepper flakes (we like heat in our house). Definitely will be making again!

The only change was I used chopped onion rather than leek. This is DELICIOUS. It is now in my collection as well.  WOW
