This is actually the recipe that led me to this site a couple of years ago. I didn't love this as is, but I'll keep working with it, now that I have more experience making hummus. For those concerned with the safety of eating this: It's absolutely safe, and it's better for you than "cooked" hummus because it's easier to digest. The problem with the funky smell could have come from your sprouting method. Beans need to be sprouted in a large jar with a mesh or cheesecloth lid, lying on its side (so the beans are spread out) in a dark but well-ventilated area. If yours were moldy, it could have been because there was not enough air getting to them. As for the question of whether this is raw: It's raw because the beans are not cooked; "regular" hummus uses cooked beans and is therefore not raw.

My 4 yo picky non-vegetarian son who likes regular hummus LOVES this recipe.  I am so grateful for this recipe.  My son and I've recently developed hayfever and we are trying to fortify our bodies with more enzymes from fresh raw food.  Other than the basic salad and fresh cut vegetables, I had yet to venture into real raw food prep.  This is a great introduction.  I did make an error though, I soaked the beans for almost 2 days (changing water twice) and forgot to let the beans sprout, nevertheless it was just as good and I'm sure the enzymes were activated. I also held back a bit on the garlic (i used one big clove) because I wasn't sure if my son would like it too strong since the restaurant versions we usually consume taste rather bland.

For the reviewer who stated "all hummus is raw"...you are incorrect.Hummus is made from COOKED beans (all canned beans have been cooked prior to canning) in most cases (if not all) which leads to a "Cooked" final product.The natural enzymes in the beans have been modified and altered by the cooking...any temp over 114 degrees F. constitutes "cooked".

I loved this whole idea. Sprouting was a blast. I let my sprouts grow to about  3/4 inch, then placed in refrigerator. They grew in the fridge too. I made two batches, one without placing in hot water, and one with. The truly raw hummus did indeed have a very green taste, once the sprouts were ground in. The other hummus (beans placed in the boiled water) was not as strong at all. Some of us ate the raw version (poor baby didn't have a choice :)) and the others much preferred the one according to recipe. Great idea, will do again, if just to sprout beans for snacking! P.S. Flavor-wise, the raw sprouted beans taste like fresh green beans, and the heated-sprouted ones tasted just like corn on the cob to us! Really! 12/4/10

I cannot tell you how many hummus recipies I have tried. They've all been terrible. I was actually getting ready to give up, and go back to buying it, when I found this recipe! 

This hummus is fantastic. It's easy, a no-brainer to make and very healthy in that it's raw. My husband and even my TWO YEAR old  love this hummus!

Really good hummus, tastes like normal cooked hummus.  As a matter of fact, after letting the beans steep in hot water for 60 seconds, they went from tasting like fresh peas to normal garbanzo beans.  It makes me wonder just how "raw" they are in the final product.  I'm sure they're a little better for you than canned garbanzo beans, but probably not by much.

I've been eating the wrong thing all this time and not liking what I tasted! Now, after having made this recipe for Christmas to include my Iranian son-in-law (who gave it two thumbs up!), I've changed my mind...it is really, really excellent hummus. It's very easy, too. I will be making this again, particularly since I had absolutely no problem getting it to look like and act like hummus. Thank you so very much for sharing. You've done me a great favor and others, too, I'm sure.

Love this recipe. I have made recipe several times. I have never had any problems with anything smelling moldy or bad. Perhaps those reviewers had bad/old garbanzo beans to begin with. I have to admit that I usually make hummus from canned garbanzo beans as it is faster and easier, but this recipe is by far my favorite when I have the time. I add different things to flavor it differently. Roasted red pepper is a favorite additive. Artichoke hearts and lots of garlic is another favorite of mine. I mix all the ingredients except for the water and add it last only as needed. If the texture still isn't right, I will add a little extra virgin olive oil. I also usually add some ground cumin for more flavor. As a garlic lover, I seldom only add 4 cloves of garlic - usually I add a lot more (about double that).

This hummus was great.  Will make again.  But, make sure you add enough water.  It was probably my fault, but mine was too pasty.

This hummus is definnately worth the time to sprout the beans- very light with all the same great taste as traditional hummus.

This recipe works. While it may be healthier, the texture isn't as good as when I cook dried garbanzos and make hummus the old-fashioned way. I also use more tahini and a little olive oil in mine. Good recipe though.

You shouldn't expect this to taste like the store bought, commercial hummus.  However, after a certain amount of time this began to taste pretty darn good.  When I first made it I was pretty disappointed.  After dinner (about an hour later) I re-tasted it and it seemed to me the hummus had had enough time to let all the flavors mix, and the beans to soften some and I can honestly say it tasted good.  While it still retained some of the "green" flavor of the sprouts, overall, I give it a 4/5.    I also added cumin, black pepper, and some oil to the recipe.  Should note that I live in Israel, so it's pretty hard to impress me with a hummus recipe...4/5 is a recipe that I will make again.

Excellent taste. Never having tried a four-day recipe before, I enjoyed this, and let the beans sit in a 8 by 8 brownie pan for their sprouting, with plastic wrap over them.  I spotted one moldy offender on the last day, so ventilation is important, and I will omit the plastic wrap next time.

Okay, so you might have to work with this a bit but it is so worth it! I've made a lot of hummus and this is one of the best recipes (super extra points for me for being sprouted as it's healthier!). 
Definitely don't leave the sprouts too long or in too small a container or they'll ferment. Wash them at LEAST twice a day. 
I started in a food processor but it wasn't getting smooth. I poured it into the blender and added more water until it was blending smoothly. I also did a bit less lemon and a tad extra tahini. 
Letting it sit really gives a chance for the flavors to come together- even better the next day!

Do not try to use canned beans instead of raw ones - the water/bean ratio is off and you end up with major trouble.

Very, very good! My husband even said it was "comparable" to his "incomparable" favorite from a restaurant. Cannot stress enough the importance of the hot water dip; soaking beans leaves a bitter coating on the outside, and nothing else will wash it off. I actually sloshed my sprouts around in the hot water for five full minutes, which probably defeats the purpose of "raw," but I don't care. The sprouting alone increases the beans' nutrition and digestibility dramatically as it is. Also, the barely-cooked beans can make a grittier hummus if your food processor is not so snazzy. I used my blender and it was perfectly smooth and light.

I have to give this five stars.  My husband ate almost the entire recipe by himself.  It is EXTREMLY strange tasting, but very good.  You almost think it has cheese in it because it's so rich!

This recipe has merit - definitely taste like the regular hummus which surprised me.  I made a fo-pau in that I didn't let the water sit for 1 minute before placing the beans in the water for another minute.  That may make them less raw for those who are strictly raw.  I'm just trying to add more raw and less animal protein in my diet.  Anyhow, I used a mixture of half chicken broth and half filtered water - and this is the mixture I put in the hummus.  When I cook beans, normally I cook them in chicken broth.... but I think I want to try plain water next time.  I used 3 tbsps. lemon juice, 2 1/2 heaping tbsps. home made tihini, 1 tsp, ground cummin and doubled the garlic.  I used a food processor - which made it grainy.  I will use the blender after the food processor next time.  The hummus has a sweeter flavor than the cooked version... but I've found that to be true of many raw dishes I've prepared so far.  Still experimenting with raw. BTW - I soaked the beans for 24 hours, rinsed them thoroughly once and let them stand in a collander overnight to get the water out.  They have a very tiny nub - which means they were at the very early stage of sprouting... still ok to use this way. Rinsing every 12 hours is of major importance as is proper drainage when sprouting - if you don't do that, expect to get that fermenting  or moldy thing going on.

I had higher expectations for this recipe due to the 4 out of 5 star rating.  I thought the beans tasted quite green and could use a bit more salt.  I added extra tahini, but my regular hummus recipe calls for 1/4 cup so that is what I was used to as far as flavor goes.  This hummus was decent, but I miss that garbanzo flavor.  I agree with another poster who said these taste like green peas.  I won't make this recipe again.

It's good, but after you put the beans in the hot water it's not really raw anymore. Rich, but not worth the effort for us.

Great recipe.  Only I got impatient with sprouting time.  In my 75 degree home, little nubbins of sprouts were seen after 24 hours, so I rinsed them, put them in my Vitamixer with water just to cover.  Added Tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, Himalyan pink salt and finest ground pepper.  It came out superb without have to wait or do the hot water thing.  Try it. Commercial hummus gives me a stomach.  Not this.

This is good!  It was worth making garbanzo bean sprouts for!  Some of the beans had started to ferment, but the hummus was delicious.  I figured that I eat sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), so I could go along with fermented beans!  Great recipe!

Delicious!  This was my first time making raw hummus, and it turned out perfectly.  It's amazing the flavors that come through in raw hummus as opposed to store-bought processed hummus.  This was definitely a crowd-pleaser and husband pleaser.

This is really good. It is raw so it has a slightly different texture/taste than regular cooked beans hummus but it is delicious! I added a handful of fresh lemon balm from my garden to the processer. I also drizzled with olive oil. I soaked the beans for about 4 days but there was just small sprouts inside the shells still. It still came out great and I know the raw sprout enzymes are still in the goodness of it.

AMAZING flavor! I added two pinches of Cumin and used organic sesame Tahini, then added about two tablespoons of raw sunflower seeds.  Very very nice!

So delicious. Also, if you don't think that you'll eat it all, it freezes quite well (which makes it handy for a time-deficient college student like myself). Boiling the beans is a MUST that you should not forego.

I had a bunch of assorted beans I'd just sprouted as a first try, and I didn't like them. Then I found your recipe and used them. Wow. Very good. And this is from a Greek girl with very high hummus standards. Will definitely sprout beans again (garbanzos this time) just to reproduce this. ps, was great spread on grilled eggplant and  rolled. Thanks for this.

I did not care for this.  It definitely tasted raw, I did follow the recipe exact.  However, I now sprout my chickpeas for my other recipe (which then cooks the chick peas in the crock pot for 6 hours) This activates enzymes and makes it healthier, even though I did not like this recipe, I would like to say thanks for the idea to sprout first!

WOW, just WOW!  I've tried to make so many hummus recipes and while some had a good flavor, none of them had the right consistency...until this recipe!  This makes the most perfectly smooth, creamy, delicious hummus.  I'm not sure if I used extra large lemons on accident because mine had a VERY strong lemon flavor...but a few more garbanzo beans and some extra cloves of garlic and it was perfect!!  Soaking the beans makes all the difference; way to go!!

I was really disappointed with this. I try to incorporate a large amount of raw, living foods in my diet, and I sprout beans and grains often. Unfortunately, even after it sat in boiled water for a few minutes, the beans (and the resulting hummus) tasted like grass! It's edible, but not yummy. Did I do something wrong to the beans? I'm not sure. I may experiment with it another time, but I am not happy with this result.

This is an awesome recipe!  It is identical to the hummus that is sold at the local organic grocery store that goes for $3 for about a cups worth!  I added roasted red pepper and dried basil to make it roasted red pepper hummus.

I hate submitting negative reviews but no one should waste their precious time and money on this recipe.  I followed the directions and did not care for the results.  That raw bean taste is just overwhelming and never becomes that nutty velvety deliciousness I have come to know from other hummus recipes.  Canned beans or cooked from dried beans produce a result far far superior to this.

A very tasty treat!  I just finished blending the hummus after waiting through the soaking and sprouting stages eagerly...and I was not disappointed.  I am going to start the next batch soaking today because I know the hummus I just made will not last for three days!  Thanks for sharing.

I have been sprouting a lot of seeds, beans, and legumes, and chickpeas (garbanzos) is one of the hardest to get just right. So I started leaving them submerged in the water until they sprout, which is usually less than 24 hours. That way, I can avoid the problems from letting them sit out at room temp while exposed to the air, which seems to be what makes them smell and taste sour by the time they sprout. The sprout is very small while underwater, but it's OK. Refrigerate soon after draining and rinsing the sprouted chickpeas until you're ready to use them. (You can use some in salads, too.) 

They work well for hummus if you have a good processor, depending on the texture you want, but they might not grind up to be perfectly smooth. A high-powered blender works even better, and does make them as perfectly smooth as you want. So I now use a vita mix VS (with variable speed). Their web site has basic instructions for blending hummus in all types of vita mix blenders.

This recipe seemed to me as if it needed some more flavor, so I add various combinations of extra ingredients such as (or sometimes all of these): raw peppers (or roasted red peppers), extra virgin olive oil, raw and/or roasted pine nuts, more lemon juice (if you like extra lemon flavor); sprouted peas, lentils, and beans; sun-dried tomatoes, and spices (like cumin, cardamom, coriander, cayenne, (and a very little bit of) allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg). 

Also, I use raw and/or roasted sesame seeds with or inst

I thought this was a wonderful recipe, I followed it as written except I used a sprouting seed combo of Adzuki bean, garbanzo, Mung bean, and snow pea. I did have to modify how much water to add, like 2-3 TBS instead of the 1 cup called for, but very tasty and wonderful on flatbread and crackers. It is a healthy tasty snack. try it!

I have made this twice. I love the process and the health benefits, but I found that it was missing something. I looked through a few other raw hummus recipes and found more spices added. I think that this is a great base recipe, I added another tbs of tahini and a little more lemon. The key ingredient for me was cumin. I added it little by little to taste, probably about half a tsp. It brought out that familiar taste I was hoping for. I made it in the evening and ate the whole tub by the next afternoon. Delicious. I suggest adding some flavor, but this is now my go to recipe. Thank you!

I made this recipe as is and I have to say not only is it not worth the effort, I question the safety of eating it.  I let the beans sit to sprout and within a few hours they began to get a funky smell.  This funky smell continued to get stronger despite rinsing the beans twice a day.  When they had fully sprouted several of the beans were actually moldy.  We decided to make it anyway and even after submerging the beans in hot water the funky smell continued (we did remove the obviously modly beans).  The taste is...well it's very sharp and sour.  I don't think this is because of the lemon.  We're going to eat it (because we don't like to throw things out) but we do have concerns as to whether or not its actually safe to eat.  To make it taste more editible we had to add lots of cumin, more garlic and salt.  And we had to add about twice the water to make it close to smooth.  Oh, and it also blew out the motor on the blender we were making it in.  And it was a Vita Mix $400 blender.  Recipe not recommended at all.

Different from other cooked-bean varieties of hummus - this tastes fresh, clean and "sprouty". I used a tsp of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because my kids aren't fans of spicy garlic, and I used liquid aminos instead of salt.  I only had 1 T of tahini left in the jar so blended in some whole sesame seeds.  The best part of this recipe was watching the beans come to life on the kitchen counter - the kids loved helping rinse them and check for sprouts (we sprouted the beans in a bowl covered with a towel). Thanks for the recipe, Emilkalil!

I was really excited to make this hummus after reading the great reviews, but after finishing it, I would be very hesitant to share it with anyone else. The flavor is odd to say the least, and I couldn't get the hummus smooth no matter how many times I ran it through the processor. It may be that I don't have a powerful enough machine to get the beans as fine as they should be, but this hummus fell way below my expectations.

I did exactly as it said, and it was nasty. The beans smelled foul after sprouting, and it tasted the same way. I did the boil water, sit for one minute thing and it was still awful. I think I will stick to the cooked chick peas next time.

I love this simple hummus and it is quite easy to jazz it up and make it your own by adding different things such as garam masala or other spices. I recently also mixed pumpkin and doubled the spices. My brother in law ate it all.

OMG!  Two weeks ago I started a low fat raw vegan diet, right after following LCHF Keto for four years.  I thought there was no way a raw hummus recipe with no oil could possibly taste good.  This is better than my cooked recipe full of olive oil!  I had to use limes instead of lemons but it was still delicious!

I added olive oil and more tahini.  I loved it.  The texture was different, but taste was good and very agreeable with the system.  It made a ton.

I've been making my own hummus for a few months now but never knew I could make it raw.  It was super easy, amazingly tasty and definitely worth the wait.  Thank you so so much

Excellent recipe! I followed it precisely until the spices part. I added a few extras for my own liking. The best hummus ever!

The blurb at the beginning is misleading - all hummus is "raw".  I have never heard or seen a recipe where you cook hummus, so I am not sure where they are going with this.
