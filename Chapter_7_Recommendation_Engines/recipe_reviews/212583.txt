I don’t usually cook recipes from a company. I like recipes from “you people”. I used 6 skinless chicken thighs. I think ½ large onion is plenty! The fennel was great and the reason to try this recipe; I have never cooked w/ fennel prior. I looked on youtube “how to slice fennel”, which was helpful. This dish just tastes like chicken w/ mushroom soup, which is good but I’m ready to step it up to a new flavor. YES! It was good. Worth repeating? No. And the reason why is because there are better recipes out there. Try the "Chicken Thigh Fricassee with Mushrooms and Rosemary", that was good!

We get our produce from a co-op. This week's produce had fennel, which I've never cooked with before. I wanted to cook something using just the ingredients I had on hand and this recipe seemed to fit the bill. I made a few adjustments while making the sauce. I don't really like a super strong cream of mushroom soup flavor, so in addition to the soup, I made a little white sauce with milk, flour, and butter, and also I added 1/2 cup sour cream at the end of cooking. Those two ingredients diluted the soup down and made the sauce a little creamier. It turned out fairly well. My husband is my litmus test because he's extremely picky and he actually did like this. I think I will make this again if I get fennel in my produce basket, but next time I think I will also add some sauteed mushrooms.
