This is a nice moist cake that's not too sweet, which really brings out the flavor of the fillings. I used salted butter, (omitted the salt) fat-free yogurt, and semisweet chocolate chips since I had them in the house. I live at about 6000 ft. and didn't make any adjustments for that but it turned out great anyway. This is tasty the way it is, but could also carry a glaze nicely. This cake is best when still warm. Keep it tightly wrapped or in an air-tight container and eat it within a couple of days as it has a tendency to get firm and dry.

Has good flavor and texture.  I used crasins that I soaked in orange juice, and I can't say I got them dry.  I did use 1/2 light and 1/2 dark brown sugar in the cake, I won't do that again, it made the cake look burnt on the outside.  I sprinkled it powdered sugar.  Great way to get rid of yogurt and cream cheese... I was at the verge of throwing out.

This rises high and gets very fluffy. It's also very yummy but isn't as sweet as I thought it'd be. I used dried cranberries instead of the raisens, and chocolate chips as well.

The cake so lovely and moist, I would make it again!
The recipe was very simple and easy to follow.
I did not include the dried fruit as there weren't any in my pantry at the time I decided to bake this cake. The end result still came out very moist and delicious.

This turned out delicious for me. I used raisins, dried cherries, walnuts & white choc.chips. white chips bring such a rich sweetness. I cut the sugar to 2 cups.
