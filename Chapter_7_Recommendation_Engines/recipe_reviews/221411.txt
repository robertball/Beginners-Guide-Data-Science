I went to Poland for the first time this summer and fell in love with chlodnik - I was so excited to see the recipe here. I need to try a few more times before I perfect it myself, but this recipe is fantastic! Just be careful with what you might be wearing when working with the beets!

Wow!  Amazing recipe.  Certainty the best borscht I've ever had, hot or cold.  This is a great summer soup, very mild and refreshing.  My beets didn't take 15 minutes to cook, they took 30.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect.  I didn't add the hard boiled egg to the mixture.  Instead I topped each bowl of soup with the eggs and a bit of sliced dill pickles.  SOOOOOO GOOOD!!!!

Wow- such beautiful color.   This was great for the 100 degree days we've been having.  Perfect summer food although it may be a bit "challenging" for pickier palates.  The fresh lemon juice is very important.  Try serving it in a martini glass- so pretty. Other chlodnik recipes include chopped radishes as well.  I really enjoyed this, thanks BJoslin!

Delicious soup, hands down! The only problem I have with the recipe is that it never states when to add the beet greens or the lemon juice. Since my beet greens weren't very good anyway, I left them out entirely, and I added the lemon juice to the beets after they  cooked and cooled. I also topped the soup with the hard boiled eggs before serving instead of adding them directly to the soup. Overall though, it's a really great (and beautiful) soup. Makes for an easy and nutritious lunch to take to work too!
