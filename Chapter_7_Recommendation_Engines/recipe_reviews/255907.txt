Basically, I followed the recipe with three exceptions.  #1 - I DOUBLED the recipe.  #2 - I disregarded the bacon quantity and method of using the bacon.  I prefer to cut up 1 pound of thick sliced bacon, cut into 3/4"-1" pieces, and fried to "extra crisp".  I did not place any bacon on  top.  #3 - I increased the Bourbon to 1 cup rather than 1/2 cup.  There wasn't enough left for a good midnight snack!!  Prepared as a side dish with Pineapple Pulled Pork.  Added oven roasted potatoes and called it dinner.  Final Note:  The beans were too "soupy" when doubling the Dr Pepper and Bourbon, so I took off about 3 cups of liquid from the beans, set it aside, reheated at dinnertime and it became a marvelous sauce for the pulled pork.  Enjoy, I did!!!

I made these beans for our get-to-gather for our  Memorial Day celebration yesterday  I made them exactly per the recipe and cooked them; probably another 30 minutes as they were still a little too soupy, but were they ever good.  I've been asked to make them again for the Fourth of July.   I think they are super delicious and most everyone else did also.  This is an excellent recipe..

Made as directed.  They were just a little too sweet.  Next time I will lessen the sugar and increase the mustard, paprika and cayenne.  I used Makers Mark bourbon.

1.7.17  I had concerns that 3 hours @ 350 would be way too long for baking these beans, and mine were perfectly done in 65 minutes.  I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings using one can of beans.  I wanted my bacon slices on the top crisp, so I didn't cover the casserole.  I forgot to add the Worcestershire sauce, but still,  these were some of the best baked beans I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).   dwfalls78, thanks for sharing your recipe.

Wow!  I made  this for the 4th and they were super easy and good.  I did add an extra can of pork and beans and didnot adjust the other ingredients.  Ive never been a baked beans person but these were very well received.

I hate to be a stick in the mud and only give 4 stars but. I doubled this recipe and had to scoop out the extra “soup”. I doubled recipe. If I make again, I would drain the beans before adding the rest of the recipe. Great taste though.

This recipe was awesome!! I added butter beans and a can of green beans and a little more cayenne pepper and everyone loved them.  I will make this recipe again, only  a larger batch because there weren't any leftovers.

I made this in a crock pot cooked on high for 4 hours then low for 2 hours. Best beans ever, I made it for a party and everyone loved it. I did add 1 pound of cooked hamburger, one chopped onion and 1 bell pepper which I sautéed together before adding. Excellent! Will make again.

Delicious! I upped the bourbon to 1 cup and also limited the wet sauce to 3 cups since other users complained about soupiness. I doubled the onions and the bacon and it was BANGIN. Incredibly flavor and perfect!

I made this to bring to thanksgiving and it went over well. I doubled the recipe and omitted the onions entirely because my brother in law has an allergy to them. I followed a combination of tips from some of the other reviews that said it came out soupy when doubled and it came out perfect. Here’s what I did:
Because we love bacon I fried up a whole pound (though my kids ate some so probably  only 0.5-0.75 actually made it into the pot). I drained the four cans of beans (remember I’m doubling the recipe) in a strainer but didn’t rinse. I drained most of the bacon grease off since a pound makes a lot more than the original recipe would have called for, I left enough in my cast iron Dutch oven to sauté the garlic. I omitted the step with the onions entirely. I combined all the sauce ingredients (doubled) as directed to keep the flavor consistency except my store didn’t have cans of Dr Pepper so I used one 20 oz bottle. I meant to go back and add another 4 ounces but forgot. I only added 3 cups of the sauce mixture in when I added the beans since people said it got soupy. (About half of what I made- I threw the rest of the sauce out but it would have made a nice sauce for something else if I was making a meat). Since I was on a time constraint I didn’t want to worry about raw bacon on top so I omitted that and simply covered with the lid of my Dutch oven. This came out perfectly- not soupy when cooked for exactly 2 hours; I stirred twice during that time. At one hour the flavor

This recipe works great! Some of the tastiest beans ever! Followed the recipe almost exactly, except had to use bbq sauce instead of ketchup, since we were out. Definitely will make again. Maybe more bacon next time, but that's just a personal preference.

This was excellent! I changed it up a bit, because I don't care for either DP or Bourbon. So, Irish whisky and Root Beer was delicious!
