My sister and I made this for a Christmas dinner (with roast and sauteed portobello mushrooms), and it was fantastic. The only change we made was to use real bacon, because we had some on hand.  The dish is very colorful, very flavorful, and incredibly unique -- but not at all difficult to make and seems impossible to mess up.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I have never liked spinach, but once I tried this, I just fell in love! I always serve it with emerals seasoning! This is the best side dish I've ever made,it goes good with just about every dinner, and when I brought it to my sister she made it 4 days in a row! This is a great recipe, and I recommend it for every beginner in cooking, becuase it is good, filling, and uniqe. :)

I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and skipped the pepper gravy. It was good, and I'll make it again. I'll roast the garlic next time. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic meal! Only difference I made was to make my own bacon bits and then fry the peppers in some of the fat left over. My husband and I really enjoyed this meal, our youngest didnÂ´t even want to try it at first "cause it looks funny" but tried some abit later and liked it then.

Fabulous!  I did not make the gravy for the potatoes as the recipe suggested.  They were great and super easy for my dinner party.

This was a really good recipe. You can't taste the spinach in the potatoes at all..so a good way to sneak in some veggies!  The bell pepper gravy was really good.  I love the combination.  I'm already wondering what else the gravy would be good on.

The bellpepper gravy was amazing.  I think I will use red potatoes next time and real bacon and I like the suggestion of mushrooms.

I didn't think this had great flavor but I like the idea.  I'll keep playing with it.

Great unique recipe! The gravy has a lot of flavor and is so yummy, and the spinach is a great way to switch up your mashed potato recipe.

These were horrible. I love spinach and couldn't taste it or anything but the peppers in these mashed potatoes. I would suggest making a standard traditional mash potato over these any day of the week.

These potatoes stand alone without the gravy. While the gravy was also very good, it hides some of the other flavors. I didn't really feel like one needed the other but they were good together, if that makes sense. I used red skin-on potatoes, cooked in the micro in a covered dish for about 8 minutes, and rough chopped the spinach. It was still a little hard to incorporate but a bigger bowl is all that was probably needed. I subbed 1% milk for the cream. The gravy was also good on the oven fried pork chops that this accompanied.
