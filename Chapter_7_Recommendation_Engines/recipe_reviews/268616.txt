Sorry, but I can not say that this was anything  that I would make again. I have made other mug cakes before and some have been OK. Thought I'd use up a lonely banana on my counter and try this recipe. Glad I wasn't hungry!

It doesn't have a lot of flavor and  the texture is not very appetizing.  I did add chocolate chips to it which made it somewhat better.

I would have given 5 stars for taste, but gave 4 due to my small adjustments to the recipe. I always keep frozen bananas for smoothies, so decided to try this mug cake. I used only 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 packet Stevia sweetener, and regular vegetable oil instead of olive oil. It was moist & had good banana flavor; and was plenty sweet.. I would make it again.
