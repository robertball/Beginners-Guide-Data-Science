Well, kbchmura, my review, sadly, will be what NOT to do with your lovely recipe for this sandwich!  Do NOT try to use a hamburger bun, no matter how good the bun is!  It's just too much softness and soaks up the butter and doesn't get crunchy enough!  Maybe if I'd broiled the buns with just the butter first that would have helped.  DO make sure to season the chicken well.  The next time I pick up some hoagie rolls----like your recipe clearly calls for----I will try this again!  Thank you!

I only had hamburger buns so I toasted them at 350 for 5 minutes then I brushed with the garlic butter and added the chicken and mozzarella cheese and baked as directed.  It was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely be making this again!

Kids and husband liked these. Easy to make. I used filleted pan fried breasts and French rolls. Nice Sammie.
