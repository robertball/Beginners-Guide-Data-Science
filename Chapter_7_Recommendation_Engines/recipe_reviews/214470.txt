I hadn't thought of serving quinoa with pesto before so this recipe was a great idea starter for me. As well as the pesto, I added lots more tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, chopped olives, chopped spinach, pine nuts and ate the whole thing with a little grated Parmesan on top. Delicious!

This was deeeeeeelicious. I love pesto, so this was perfect for me. I felt like it needed something else, though... so I added a can of chickpeas and it was great.

Quick and easy for a main dish or a side dish.  I added sliced carrots at the end with the tomatoes for more color and some crunch.  My husband had seconds!

I make this as a side dish with grilled chicken and add feta cheese - it's delicious!  I also make a cold salad by adding cucumber, red peppers, green onions, and feta.  It's a wonderful lunch in the summer!

Decent enough. Honestly, you could put pesto on a car battery, serve it with a side of brussels sprouts and you'd hear no complaints from me. Pesto is the man. Pesto is God's favorite food. I added three chopped hard-boiled eggs to this because it was breakfast, next time I might leave the yolks a little runny.

This was so simple and tasty!  I did add 3T of pesto, used veggie broth and a bunch of little grape tomatoes.  Then I decided to add more - some baby spinach, black olives and garbanzo beans.  Nice addition to my "quinoa recipes".  Thanks.

Very good.  My husband does not like quinoa but I thought I'd give it another go and he really enjoyed.  My 16 month also ate it up.  FYI, you can do quinoa in your rice cooker and it comes out perfectly.

Not what I expected.  I added 3 tbsp. of pesto as others mentioned.  I also added roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts, parsley, parmesan cheese and two pinches of sugar.  The consistency was a little goopy.  Either there was too much chicken broth or I didn't let it sit long enough.  I didn't eat any right away but placed in the fridge so the flavors can blend together.  Hopefully it will taste better after being refrigerated!

More pesto is needed, I doubled the pesto the second time and it was much better.

This was great.  I took some advice from the other reviewer and added about 1/2 cup sundried tomatoes, 1/4 cup pine nuts, and 5 oz chopped spinach.  I topped it with grated Romano cheese and it was excellent!

Super delicious! I used the Spinach Basil Pesto recipe from allrecipes.com and added some prosciutto. I would have given it 5 stars but I altered it a bit, although I am sure it is delicious as-is. Easy too. Yummm

This was good and simple. I made enough for about 5 people and added 3 grilled chicken breasts. I also added some parmesan cheese and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh! Everyone liked it and some even asked for the recipe. I think next time I will make this with some spice to it!

REALLY delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth. My husband, not a fan of "veggie recipes" turned his nose slightly up at this when I told him what I was making, HOWEVER, he had countless servings and went on and on how tasty this was. My 9yr old scoffed it down too. Thank you for an easy, wonderful recipe!

Giving it 4 stars for the idea but I modified it like so: 1C white rice + 2C chicken broth + chopped tomatoes + frozen spinach + lots of pesto + rice cooker = easiest meal ever.

I really liked this. I had some already cooked left over quinoa from another recipe (about 2 cups). I put in at least 2 heaping TBSP of basil, tomato pesto, a TBSP of sundried tomato bruscheta, chopped up about 1/4 cup pecans, 1/2 a tomato (all I had), 3/4 cup fresh spinach. It is really yummy. I will serve it on a bed of spinach as a side for dinner. Quinoa is so nutritious and whole grain.

I made this as I am trying to use quinoa more often in our diet. It was delicious. Mostly because of the pesto. I added chicken which I fried in the pesto first as well. The children were a little taken back by the green colour of the whole meal. I said it was 'Hulk food' and that was OK. The pesto dominated the flavour so the quinoa was not really noticed.

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half and followed it exactly.  I used cherry tomatoes because thats what I had.  My pesto was reduced fat.  Delish!

This was OK, not great. I didn't have quite 2 tbsp pesto, but I don't think that was the problem. I think maybe it could have used a squeeze of lemon or lime juice. I added some cooked garbanzo beans, which was good. I also cooked with water instead of broth, but that is because I don't like quinoa cooked in broth. I might make again, but it won't be a top go-to quinoa recipe for me.

I freaking love this stuff!!!  I only gave it a 4 cause my kids wouldn't eat it.  I'm not sure why cause they love pasta with pesto.  It's wonderful, I was secretly excited to finish it off by myself!

This is very good. I've never cooked quinoa before, but found I needed to add a good bit more liquid before it was completely cooked. The pesto add a wonderful flavor. I used homemade that I'd frozen previously. I will make this again.

Yum!! I love quinoa and this dish was absolutely delicious. My dad, who is not a big quinoa fan, even complimented me on it. The changes I made were to triple the pesto, and also to add 1/2 cup of chickpeas. The chickpeas turned out to be a great addition. Love this recipe and will be making it again!! Thanks for sharing:)

I thought this was a bit dry, but my fiance loved it and wouldn't stop raving about it, so am giving it five stars.  I did make several changes. Instead of cherry tomatoes, I used sun-dried tomatoes.  Also threw in some kalamata olives.  Topped it with chopped walnuts, but would use pine nuts next time (we didn't have any).  I put in extra pesto to make it less dry, and then even added some flax oil.  Topped it with feta.

This is simply awesome. I've made it several times but had forgotten to review it. Super easy, healthy and pairs well with lots of different dishes. I love quinoa and try to find new recipes but I keep coming back to this one.

I loved this! this was my first experience with qunioa and I am quite pleased. The pesto flavor worked very well with the red pepper; this was a great accompaniment to stir-fried veggies, too. Will make this again very soon (:

Made this to the letter and it was delicious!  Pulled to cubes of homemade pesto from the freeze and dropped them in the hot quinoa still froze.  Worked like a dream.  Thanks for sharing will definately make again.

This recipe is really great. I added pine nuts (a suggestion from another reviewer), 1 additional tbsp of pesto and also about 1 tbsp of olive oil. After the additions it tasted amazing! The pine nuts give a nice added texture and flavor to the recipe.

Doubled the recipe for a crowd and it worked out perfectly. Used half fresh tomatoes, half sun-dried. Delicious!

This was very yummy and a great way to introduce my family to Quinoa. I added pine nuts, sliced little grape tomatos, garlic, and right before serving tossed in some arugula. I think my soup stock was a tad too salty so next time I'll use reduced sodium chicken broth. My daughter wanted it the next day for her lunch box!

I doubled the (store-bought) pesto, but it still tastes mild for a pesto lover. Added slightly cooked carrots and black olives. Like it overall, but little oily compare to other quinoa dishes.

This was our first time ever eating quinoa! I went with this recipe because we had all of the ingredients at hand. It was very yummy. I used 1/3 a can of garlic and olive oil petite diced tomatoes instead and next time I would use less pesto. It was pretty strong but tasty! Will make again! Thank you!

Oh my gosh I loved this! I read other people's reviews, and I did not have any of the problems with the quinoa being dry. My can of chicken broth was 14 ounces, so I just added two ounces of water to make two cups. I think the liquid to quinoa ratio is pretty important. I added 4 tablespoons, just because I prefer a richer taste of pesto, but it would be fine as written. I think some pine nuts would really complete the dish, so next time I will add those. I love quinoa, and enjoy getting ideas for new ways to cook it. This was a creative and easy way to do that. It might be nice to try other types of pesto with this recipe. Maybe arugala? I will be making this again.

I don't like quinoa because I find it bitter.  I rinse it well, maybe it's just me....BUT making it with pesto is a great idea and the bitter edge is mostly gone.  Family loved it too.

Delicious. It makes a perfect recipe base. It would be fine as a side dish, but I wanted to make it into a meal, so I added cubed left over chicken breast, about 3/4 of a yellow pepper (any colour would be good), and about a cup of mushrooms. I also added an extra tbsp of pesto, and a bit of sea salt. It was so yummy. Next time I'm going to try it Greek style and take out the mushrooms and add olives and tomatoes. It even tastes good cold and would make a really nice salad. I will definitely be sharing this recipe.

Loved this!!  I agree, it's a good base dish and I am already thinking of new things I will add next time.  This time I took the other suggestions and added some olives and pine nuts.  Wish I had parmesan for the top of it.. sounds delish!

I recently made this for a potluck at church.  It was easy and very tasty.  Though I must admit I did add more pesto but I like a lot of pesto flavor.  Next time I might try to add some garlic grilled chicken added too as my husband doesn't always like to go meatless.  Makes a great base recipe.

This was very easy and very good. Couple of changes that I made – – was out of chicken stock so I used vegetable stock. Turned out very good; I added a little bit more pesto than what was called for as well as a little bit of olive oil. Delicious.

Followed the directions for the most part. I ended up adding maybe 3.5 tbsp of Pesto though. I also added chickpeas and shredded Parmesan. I couldn't stop eating while I was cooking. Oh almost forgot I added some lemon juice too. Eating as I'm trying this out. Thinking I might add feta cheese into one of my lunch bowls.

I have made this for numerous parties and  it us well liked.  I do add more pesto than recipe calls for and  use cherry tomatoes and mozzarella balls..   I always rinse my quinoa first and just cook in water not a fan of cooking it in stock.

Delish! I used a bit more basil and added feta cheese because it was a little bland and I wanted more of a full lunch. Thanks for the recipe!

Great lean side.  Just use reduced sodium vegetable broth (I used mushroom) and then diced some mushrooms and added it to it.  Super yummy and easy.

Even tried this with brown rice instead of Quinoa, it was a great change to the everyday rice!
