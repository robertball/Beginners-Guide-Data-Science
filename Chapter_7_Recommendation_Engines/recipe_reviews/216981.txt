Props to the recipe submitter for using homemade corned beef (not out of a can, like the 2 top rated recipes on the site). I think, as written, this recipe is a solid 4 stars, and I did try to follow closely, but the end result seemed to be missing something. I used leftover corned beef from the recipe Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches. I did omit the olive oil, and instead just used 2 tablespoons of salted butter. I also omitted the carrots. I had cooked the potatoes the night before, so I diced them up and added them to the onions while they were cooking. In addition to the recommended ingredients, I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I also used quite a bit of fresh cracked black pepper (I didn't want it spicy, I just wanted it to have a nice bold flavor). I then pressed it in to the pan and let it cook on medium low to get just a little bit of a crisp on it. Served it with an egg and toasted rye bread, and it was absolutely killer.

This is EXACTLY how I make my corned beef hash.  I, too, make sure that when I buy a corned beef, I buy one extra big so I can have a piece leftover for this hash.  The onlyt thing I don't do is add the carrot...AND...I use potatoes that have been pre-cooked.  I generally bake a few long white potatoes a day or so before I make the hash...you could also use the leftover potatoes if you started out with a New England Boiled Dinner.  This is JUST delicious!

This  is way better than canned hash! Even my husband loves it! I cooked a pre-seasoned, marinated Garrett County brisket for this, so it also had a mustard seed and bay leaf flavor, as well as the thyme that this recipe calls for. I am going  to make this for my mom next time she visits; she also loves hash and I think she will find it marvelous.

I've been trying to find the perfect hash recipe.  This one came out great with a few modifications.  First i blanched the potatoes in my deep fryer for about 3 min at 375.  I mixed it all together and put it in the oven at 350 for 30 min and the potatoes browned up nicely.  I'll definately be making this one again!

I also buy an extra piece of corned beef for hash, but I cook extra potatoes for the hash.  I put it all in my meat grinder with onion alternating the meat, onions and potatoes. Put it an a large bowl and mix well. I separate it and put it in zip lock bags and put in the freezer for future use.  When ready to use, take what you'll need from freezer and put it in a fry pan with some butter, cook over low/medium heat until it gets a little brown.  Flip it until it browns a little on the other side and serve.  This was my mother's recipe and has been in the family forever, passing it down from one generation to the next. Absolutely delicious!!

I just made this dish for my fam...and it was a hit! I used a couple other herbs for flavoring such as rosemary, parsley, oregano, basil, mint, sage and thyme, and those herbs made this dish sing! I did however make this a little thicker by adding some chicken broth and finishing it with some monterey jack cheese. I then made some sunny-side up eggs and placed them atop of the hash, and....a masterpiece....I will be making this in the near future!

A beautiful, colorful, filling dish.  However...  I really can't say that it knocked my socks off...  it's a lot of work for a ho-hum dish.  I made exactly per recipe instructions.  A solid three-star.

Excellent! I omitted the carrots, only because I didn't think the recipe needed them, and it was fantastic! Will absolutely make again!

This recipe was a wonderful use of leftover corned beef!!  The hash turned out beautiful - almost too beautiful to call "hash" !!   I had about two servings of corned beef left (not two pounds as called for) but still used six medium red potatoes and followed the rest of the recipe as written - including the fried eggs on top.   For three adults and four finicky little ones, it was just enough.  Two of my children loved it.  Our pickiest eater didn't care for it, but still ate it (that is worth three stars alone!).  My husband and my mom both had seconds.  If there had been any leftover, my husband said it would be delicious in scrambled egg and wrapped in a soft tortilla for a quick breakfast.  I made the hash in one skillet, then transferred to an oven safe serving dish and placed in the oven to keep warm.  I then fried the eggs in the skillet and placed on top of the hash as they were done.  I served it all nice and warm at the table family style (unlike our usual plating in the kitchen and then taking to the table).  Beautiful, yummy, comfort food!!

But can I just say this is not what the Irish eat on Patrick's day? They eat bacon and cabbage. Not bacon like a slice of bacon but a round of bacon. Or a joint of bacon. Having said that, this is a great recipe. Very tasty.

I liked this recipe because it had beer in it! The recipe calls for a 4 pound corned beef, but I could only find a 3.5 pound at my supermarket. I put the crockpot on for six hours on high, (that was far as it would go on high), and it was done by Supertime! 
Good, I would give it five stars, but the only spices the recipe called for was the spice packet inside the corned beef packet. This is not enough for me, so I added some garlic powder, and stuck one bay leaf inside the crock. Came out DELISH!!

This really came out good.  My leftover corned beef was really salty to begin with so I took the advise of another reviewer and soaked the cooked meat in water before I started this recipe.  I covered the meat, set it in the fridge for about 4 hours and the meat came out hardly salty at all  Thanks for the advise.

Great recipe.  The thyme adds a great kick of flavor.  I added sweet red pepper to it along with the carrots for nuition as well as flavor and color.  Did not have onion so I used onion powder.  Will be making again.

Wow this is fantastic.  Family just raved about this recipe.  Just a word on this.  I had used may largest fry pan and found that as I had put the meat in it was not going to be big enough.  Had to use my large stock pot.  It worked great for me.  Will be making again.

Everybody thought it was very good except maybe Roger.  Everybody thought it was missing a seasoning or something.  I didn't put in very much seasoning at all.  If you have the leftover sauce from my corned beef recipe it is good on it.

The only hash I ever had as a child was the canned type (gags).  This was an entirely new experience and one that I absolutely loved.  Fantastic.  Only change was that I used left over potatoes we had boiled when making the original Corned Beef & Cabbage meal.  Served with the obligatory fried egg.  Yummmmmmm!

I am making a very similar recipe to this one this morning with leftover corned beef and red potatoes from last night.  Plan to add a bit of swiss cheese and Will top with a fried egg, but will also top off with hollandaise sauce. The mixture of the egg yolk and hollandaise sauce is sooo good.  Had a similar dish at a small breakfast cafe.

I had left over corned beef and potatoes so this was a natural selection. I used dried onion (re-hydrated first), left out the carrots, and used dried parsley and thyme. That made it really quick and easy. The most time consuming part was cutting the meat and potatoes up into small pieces. I like finely diced hash. Served with an egg over easy make a great meal.

This was delicious and a great change of pace. Around St. Patrick's Day, corned beef is cheaper than buying a pound of bacon!  I left out the carrots per others' suggestions.  Smells delicious cooking too!

The picture looked appetizing so i tried it. I wasnt raise on corn beef hash so i didnt know what to expect. I served it with an egg on top, and to me it made a huge difference in flavor, my husband gobbled it up. I probably wont be making it again though. I'm not a fan of corn beef hash.

This was the best corned beef hash I've ever made or eaten. I did follow the advice of another user and added additional herbs (rosemary, parsley, oregano, basil, mint, sage and thyme) & topped the portions of those that wanted it with a egg.  The herbs are really what brought out the flavors! I served this to company and it was a hit with everyone!

To get a hint of smokiness to the flavor try adding 1/8 tsp of Schilling Grill Mates "Mesquite" spice.

We loved this, I did omit the carrot, mostly a personal preference.  This sure beats eating corned beef out of a can.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made it simple by using frozen cubed hash browns, and my left over corned beef cubed. Good and simple just the way I like it.

Great recipe! I was very happy to find a recipe for this using fresh corned beef instead of canned. I used the leftovers from St. Patrick's Day. Left out the carrot. Thanks!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was great. May be the first time I've made hash with a home cooked corned beef. I covered the pan and  poached eggs right on top at the end. The only changed I made was par boiling the potatoes (thank you prior reviewers) and I added about 1/3 cup cream when the corned beef was added. Excellent recipe.

My wife said it was the best she has ever had (she is Irish). I incorporated all the review tips. Used braised corned beef, extra baked ahead potatoes, carrots, herbs and cooked uncured smoked bacon first to crumble stage and added at end. Did not need olive oil or butter, had too much grease and had to pour it off as the corned beef rendered way more than I had anticipated. Was so good! I agree with Debra as I also buy extra and braise one just for hash.

My husband and I make this for guests all the time and we get rave reviews, thanks for this wonderful recipe!  The only changes that we made were soaking the corned beef in water the night before to remove some of the excess saltiness and using frozen hashbrown potatoes just to save time.

Amazing recipe!  I've never cared much for corned beef hash - this recipe has changed all that.  One reviewer said she makes corned beef just so she can make hash. I thought to myself how strange - well now I am a believer.  Would definitely consider making the brisket so I can have hash.

Thanks so much for sharing.

This was a fabulous way to finish up our St. Patrick's Day corned beef. It was even better than the traditional recipe we had with cabbage, potatoes, and carrots from the crock pot. I did add garlic with the onion and included green onion with the red onion. I added a scrambled egg to my plate, but my husband just mushed his up real good on his plate. Awesome taste!!

Great recipe.  I use left over corned beef and red potatoes from St. Pattty's dinner as well as adding the fried onions.  I omit the carrots.  One extra ingredient I do add is some Maille's Whole Grain Dijon Mustard, to taste.  Delicious.

This was our breakfast this morning!  DELICIOUS!  I too used leftover potatoes from my corned beef and cabbage I made yesterday. I made this exactly as it is written and I wouldn't change a thing!  This was our first time having Corned beef hash and the added egg on top, just took it over the edge!  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will be making this again for sure!

We will be making this each time we have leftover corned beef. We used the uncured corned beef from Fresh Thyme and it was so tender and delicious. I cooked onions until translucent before adding potatoes and then covered them for the first five mins to let them cook through a little better. I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of garlic powder towards the end. A lot less work than cooking the potatoes ahead of time...just took longer and less cleanup this way.

It was good but not the best!  For my taste there was too much thyme.  I'll make it again but I would half the thyme and add more pepper.  I like a little bit of spice so i'll add a small amount of garlic and jalapeno.

This is a family favorite. Like others commented making homemade hash requires a fresh made corned beef not canned.  I boil my corned beef with a stout beer the night before and then use a food processor.  I omit the carrots and the butter. I sauté my onions in olive oil. What makes this recipe is the thyme.  Best recipe for real corned beef hash!

So easy to make.  So tasty.  I rarely find a corned beef hash in a restaurant that is any good.  I'll never order it again, just making this at home!

The easy way out is to use O'Brien frozen potatoes along with the left over corned beef. Very tasty and very easy to use up your corned beef. Give it a try.

To make this easier, I cut the potatoes, corn beef and onions, put in food processor and pulse until about the size of orzo pasta.  Then melt butter and oil on medium high heat,  then put in the corn beef mixture and fry until the potatoes and onions are cooked.

I've made this twice now. I did omit the carrots. I also found if you put a steel mixing bowl over the corned beef before cutting it up it stays moist and tender.  Overall, this is a family favorite!!

"I purposely cook a whole corned beef just to make hash. "
Yeah, me too. I don't usually eat high sodium foods like this but occasionally I will treat myself. So slow cooker all day then corned beef and Swiss on rye for dinner and then this great recipe for hash the next morning. Both were terrific.

This is a family favorite. We have made it 3 years running and it is one of the most requested dinners by my daughter. I boil a 2 1/2 lb corned beef brisket traditional style to use in the recipe; trimmed the fat, and diced. We never have leftovers!

I used boarhead corned beef from the deli, and I put all ingredients (separately) in my food processor, which  definitely saved on time. It was good, my family liked it and I would consider making it again, with a little less peper.  Also I read somewhere if you put two tablespoons of heavy cream in it,  it will give it a nice brown crisp bottom, which did seem to work.

Amazing recipe.  Simple but SO good.  Omitted the carrots, but otherwise made as directed.  Makes a lot, but good as leftovers...just cook the eggs fresh after reheating the hash.  YUM.  Best ever.

Excellent, easy prep. I used a slow cooker for the corned beef - approx 5 hours - and combined it all in a 16" iron skillet. Delicious.

This is how I make my Corned beef hash as well. I add a handful of baby spinach before serving and I serve it with an egg on top and HP sauce too. It's also great with some grated cheese on top, and put under the grill till cheese is melted.

I boiled the potatoes ahead of time and did not add the carrots.  Also used Wigley's Corned Beef only available in the Detroit, Michigan area.  Very tender and well seasoned.  I added a couple of eggs at the end.  My husband loved it!

Very good for a brunch after a long weekend.  I microwaved the diced potatoes for 5 mins before adding to skillet as another reviewer recommended to quicken cook time.  Just realize that this does take up to 45 mins to cook so if you have the patience, it is well worth the effort.  I added garlic powder in addition to the other spices from recipe.  Didn't add veggies, just onion and potatoes, and a can of corned beef hash from grocery store.  There is only 2 of us so this made adjustments per Allrecipes serving size suggestions. My fiancé loved it!

I cook with what I have.   So I substituted white potatoes with sweet potatoes and added crumbled blue cheese top offset sponge I'd the sweetness.   Everything else is the same as the recipe.  Good basic recipes that is easily modified.   I'll be making it again and experimenting with ingredients.

I made this with a few changes.  I baked the potatoes in the microwave ahead of time.  Cut them up and browned them in the onions.  Seasoned the potatoes and onions before adding the corned beef.  This was the best corned beef hash that I have ever made.  I will definitely be doing this again.  Everyone raved about it!!!!

My only complaint was using Thyme.. I like thyme and use it all the time in my recipes but that seemed to be the outstanding taste in this dish, but I loved how easy this was to make and will definitely make this again and just omit the thyme. Thank you! This was so much better than the canned stuff!

I was using leftover corned beef. I didn't measure ingredients, but used what I had on hand and followed the cook's directions. It was delicious - four of us ate it and loved it. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good, I did make a few changes.  I used tater tots to shorten cook time.  I added a tsp of apple cider vinegar.  It was delicious with fried eggs on top.  Also tried a little hot sauce on top and it gave it an extra little zing.

Delicious!  I always cook potatoes and carrots along with the cabbage and corned beef.  This recipe was perfect for my leftovers.  I sauteed the onions...added the chopped potatoes and carrots...and browned one side.  I flipped it over...added corned beef, a bit of garlic powder, a slash of Worcestershire (as suggested in other reviews). I browned the other side...gave it a stir and received rave reviews.

I thought this was a good recipe.  It seemed like it was missing something, but I couldn't figure out what.  I added some garlic powder and a little red pepper.  I served it with cheddar cheese and eggs.

this was very good! I used the leftover corned beef , potatoes, carrots and followed the rest of the recipe accordingly. I did add some worcestershire sauce per the one review.
Very fresh tasting, we did enjoy it with an egg on top!

Excellent! I didn't have much corned beef left over so I had to reduce the recipe. In future I'll make a bigger corned beef for sure.

I  substituted diced canned potatoes I had in pantry, dried parley instead of fresh and hash still came out delicious!  I also ground leftover corned beef in the food processor, instead of cubing.

I used a non stick skillet. This was very good. Browned up very nicely. I used left overs from St. Patricks day. The potatoes were already cooked. I also added a chopped cooked beet that added great color and flavor.

I found this recipe when I didn't have much corned beef leftover, so I scaled it back accordingly and left out the carrot, parsley and salt. This was my first attempt at making corned beef, and I have to say it was very good.  I'll be making it again.

Delicious.  I wish I had followed the recipe and cut things into 1/4" cubes as instructed.  Due to my own laziness, I cut them larger.  It would have been better had I not done that.

This recipe is great.  I'm glad I made it before I checked the reviews.  I only read three (just now) and I really don't understand how these people can give this recipe a bad rap when they not only change the ingredients but the cooking instructions as well.   I think they should just save their ink. I prepared this as directed and I think it was terrific.  It's a great recipe and would not change a thing.  Thank you for a keeper!  Debbie

Followed directions pretty closely and turned out great. I had some leftover potatoes and carrots that I cooked with the corned beef the night before, so I used those, with the addition of a few more raw potatoes because I didn't think I had enough. Added a little worchestershire sauce and garlic powder for flavor. Was very good! I will make this again

Holy cow....this was delicious! I made it exactly as suggested, used the leftover potatoes and carrots that I had boiled with the corned beef last night hoping that it would workout ok that way... and man... did it ever! A couple of fried eggs on top and it was a wonderful breakfast! Yummy!

I use the vegetables that I cook with the corned beef to make hash, eliminating  quite a bit of the prep in this recipe as written...also gives the hash a far better flavor.  Adjust the veggie/beef proportions to your liking - 6 potatoes, one carrot and an onion seemed rather light for 2 pounds of meat...to each his/her own, but I added 2 more potatoes, another carrot and a small slice of the cabbage cooked with the boiled dinner.  Of note...I always use small potatoes so that I can cook them whole...it prevents the spuds from breaking apart or getting a mealy texture...most likely why I added more to balance the meat.

I omitted the carrots and grated the onion and added the onion and onion juice.  Someone said she thought something was missing, so did I.  I added horseradish . . . I always do when I'm making corned beef or roast beef hash . . . turned out great.

I did make a few changes to meet our tastes.  Chopped the onion to make 1 1/2 cups.  Husband didn't like the idea of carrot.  The only seasonings I used was salt & pepper.  This was my first attempt using corn beef.   I had  roasted my own corned beef for another recipe & had enough left for the hash.  Can't wait to make it again.

Had a terrible cut of corned beef already cooked with potatoes and carrots.   Made 1/4 of recipe.  Saved my beef!   Extra Frank's (or Tabasco I was out).  This is great and easy.

We love homemade corned beef hash!  This really is delicious.  I followed along exactly and added diced roasted peppers for color and flavor.  Fried eggs to top it off and a quick sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese.  Heaven!

So delicious!  This is my only go to recipe for corned beef hash - have made it several times and my family loves it.  Thank you for sharing :)

Pretty tasty, but next time, I would definitely save time and just use frozen cubed hash browns.  I added some onion powder for some extra flavor, as the hash was a little bland.  Think I'd skip the carrot next time, too.
