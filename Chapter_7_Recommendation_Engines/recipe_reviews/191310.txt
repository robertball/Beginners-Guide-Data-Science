Neither my boyfriend nor I are really into fish, but we try to eat it a couple times a month for variation and because of the health benefits. This recipe was really fantastic. We cut the recipe in half - and instead of using 1 1/2 teaspoons of fresh ginger, we used used a little over 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger. Tasted great! :)

Good flavor, but I think I should've let it marinate longer.

Excellent!  I only had the chance to marinate it for 10 minutes, but with fish, you don't need (and shouldn't) anything more than 30 minutes.  The yogurt/soy sauce mixture has a slight chocolatey scent..interesting. :)  I covered them with black pepper, before popping into the oven.  I baked them at 375 F for 20 minutes on a oil-sprayed foil-lined baking sheet, and then 425 F for another 5 minutes.  I topped with my own sauce (plain yogurt, chopped green onions, chopped cilantro, 1/2 avocado-mashed, lots of black pepper)..  fantastic!  Healthy, moist, easy, fast, and delicious. :)

I had been craving salmon for a while, I found it on sale $5.99LB for the wild one and jumped at it since it's $2-3 more everywhere else. I made this and it was a hit!! The family really enjoyed the flavor and was super simple to fix. I will make this again for sure!! Thank you Dannon

This is very good, but you may need to bake it a little longer after you broil it, depending on the thickness of the fillet.  (I did:  About 10-15 minutes at 400 degrees.)

I would give this a 2.5 if I could.  I didn't like the ginger-soy flavour with the salmon, it overpowered the fish rather than complimented it, and the yogurt gave it a bit of a strange texture.  I won't make this again.  If you want to disguise the taste of salmon then perhaps you should try this.  It might benefit from the addition of some garlic.

This was pretty good!  The yogurt is kinda throwing me off slightly, and I'm still trying to figure out how much I like it on there...but other than that the flavor is good!

I thought this tasted really good! It gave the salmon a nice mild flavor and went perfectly  with the smashed cauliflower from this site. I will be making this again.
