I gave this a four-star rating instead of a five only because of the modifications I made to the recipe. Based on other reviews that I read, I omitted the onion soup mix. First, I made a seasoning mix of black pepper, garlic powder, seasoning salt and cinnamon. I rubbed this into the bone-in pork chops and seared them in olive oil. While they were browning, I mixed one cup applesauce, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 tablespoons margarine and 1 chopped red apple (I didn't have green ones on hand). In a 9x13 pan, I poured 2 tablespoons butter mixed with 2 teaspoons minced garlic. I put the browned pork chops in the pan and poured the apple mix on top. I kept the cooking temp and time the same. These chops came out so juicy and tender, the best I have ever had. My guests were not that hungry but ate 'em up anyway!! Don't let the other mediocre reviews stop you from trying this recipe. It's a good base, just modify to your family's taste and you will have a real winner!!

I tried this recipe after eating my wifes dried out nasty chops for some time now. It was a big hit even though she did not eat. The kids and I loved it and they dont want mom to cook anymore.
The meat was tender and juicy and the sauce was very tasty.

A waste of perfectly good pork chops.  I was excited about this recipe but hesitant about the onion mix.  I should have followed my instinct and just prepared the dinner with the apples.  The onion overpowered the mix.  One bite was all it took to make us scrape the chops clean and head for the barbecue sauce.

The first time I made this dish, it was not a big winner in my house, the onion soup mix overpowered the apple flavor.  I modified the recipe by halving the amount of soup mix to use and added a pinch of cinnamon(or use cinnamon applesauce)and 1/3 cup of brown sugar(per 4 svgs.).  The result was delicious!  My boys, who are the pickiest eaters absolutely loved this!

I followed the recommendation of other reviews and the pork chops turned out fantastic!  Very moist and tender.  The meat was eaten off the bone!

Preheated oven to 375. I browned the chops w/ a rub of some pepper, seasoned salt, and cinnamon.  Used approx 1 cup apple sauce, approx 3 tbsp marg, one sliced granny apple, small amt of brown sugar and cinnamon heated in a sauce pan.  Melted a couple tbls of butter and one clove minced garlic to bottom of baking pan then placed the browned chops in the pan and topped w/ the apple mixture.  Cooked for approx 30-45 minutes but lowered the heat to 325-350 after about 25 minutes as I was awaiting guests.

I will be making this again soon!!

I've found so many recipes, all good, on this site.   Sadly, this is not one of them.  I threw it out (and my husband is unemployed, so I can't afford to toss out food) sorry, not to my liking at all.

This recipe is my dad's favorite pork chop recipe.  He absolutely loved them and couldn't stop raving about them.  I added a little bit more applesauce then it called for.  One word of advice would be to make sure you mix the applesauce and onion soup mix up good together before adding the apple pieces.  And like some reviewers stated you might only want to use half a envelope of onion soup mix the first time making it.  I didn't pre-brown the chops but I don't think it made much of a difference.

Not a fan - the ratio of onion soup mix to applesauce was to heavy for me.  Would not try again.

I followed CERRAIN18TH's suggestions and the pork chops came out some of the most delicious I've ever had.  My wife loved them so much she requested them for her birthday dinner.  I also suggest homemaking your applesauce with a recipe on here for even more amazing flavor.  All in all, just plain awesome.

This was quite good. I had read the other reviews and was concerned about trying this recipe, but took the leap and did it. Here are my thoughts. If you are expecting your granny's pork chops and applesauce, then, yeah, you're gonna be disappointed. So, disabuse yourself of that notion right now. These won't taste like that. Also, the recipe didn't specify sweetened or unsweetened apple sauce. I used unsweetened. I think that makes a difference. These were moist. They were flavorful. went well with rice and were great left over!

I have to say after reading a lot of these reviews I was nervous about this recipe. I decided to try the recipe anyway and it came out awesome!! I did make some small changes based on the reviews. I only used a half packet of the onion soup mix, added a little extra apple sauce and sprinkled a little cinnamon in the mixture. Great recipe. I will absolutely be used again!

I liked this recipe almost as is.  I only had two chops, so I cut the recipe in half and added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.  I like onion soup mix, so it didn't offend me.  My husband is not such a fan but he didn't notice it was there - probably because I only used 1/2 the packet.  I like this recipe and plan on playing with it in the future, such as possibly breading the chops and adding cranberries.

I only cooked the pork chops for 20 mins and they were dry and the apples werent cooked enough! I gave 3 stars because my family loved the flavor. I will make this again but I will have to figure out a way to cook it differently.

This recipe was super easy and good comfort food! It was lacking in flavor....not sure how to improve it, but it was kind of bland.   My boyfriend loved it, I am open for suggestions on any improvement (I don't use pork much) :)

Loved the modifications suggested by CERRAIN18th - the rub really helped keep them juicy. I suggest you start with chops that come from locally raised grass fed pigs. It makes all the difference in flavor, and supports the local farms!

This was a very easy recipe and helped save some not so wonderful pork chops.  Next time I may add some water or juice to thin the sauce a little.

My husband loved it. I used pork steaks insstead of pork chops.  Also took the advice of others and seasoned the pork steaks while browning them. Also, use the cinnamon flavored chunky applesauce and added cinnamon.  Quick and easy

These were OK. I liked the chunks of apples, but agree that the combination with the onion soup mix was a little strange. They were decent but not sure I'd make it again.

This recipe was ok, if I used it again I would only use 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix, if at all, and wouldn't cook it as long, they came out a little dry.

I USED 2 INDIVDUAL SNACK CUPS OF APPLESAUCE, AND 1/2 PACK OF LIPTON ONION SOUP MIX, SWEETENED WITH A SPRINKLE OF CINNAMON AND BROWN SUGAR. I USED THE OTHER 1/2 OF THE SOUP MIX ON SOME CUBED POTATOES WHICH I LAYERED UNDER THE CHOPS. THE POTOATES WERE GOOD, THE CHOPS WERE... OK, ALMOST CHINESE TASTING. WE COULDNT DECIDE IF WE LIKED IT OR NOT. I WOULDNT MAKE IT AGAIN.

Moist and tender, but we (my boyfriend & I) didn't care for the flavor of the sauce.  However, I did omit the fresh apple, because I was pressed for time.  I don't think it would have made enough of a difference, though. Scraped off the sauce & ate the chops.

I followed a mixture of alternate suggestions that seemed fit and was hoping for a result worth the extra time. The chops while pan searing smelled wonderful with the spice mix and the sauce had lots of flavor. 

Unfortunately when I took a bite it seemed as if all those flavors just dissapeared and the sweet apple vs. pork flavors were more contradictory than supplamentery. I see potential in this recipe but I disliked it as it is. Maybe stuff the meat with a thicken version of the sauce or just do it all in a skillet.

I love onion soup mix and love apples. But these two simply don't mix. I didn't like it at all and ended up throwing it away. Even cut amount of onion soup mix in half and it was still too much.

This was my first allrecipes.com recipe to try!  I love adding fruit to meat and salads, so thought this sounded good.  Based on some other reviews, I did not use the onion soup mix, instead opting for some brown sugar, more cinnamon, and some other spices.  However, I think next time (and there will be a next time!) I will try adding half a packet, it could have used the extra bite.  My partner and I ended up adding some onion powder after the first few bites, and it helped a lot.  Very good recipe - it made the kitchen smell like Autumn!

Excellent! My family loved it! Two notes: I had to cook for about 45 minutes to reach the proper internal temperature. Also, don't chop the apples too finely or they will become mushy.

The combination of the onion soup mix and applesauce sounded intriguing, but the reality was different.  Definitely too much onion flavor and it didn't go very well with the sweetness of the apples. I won't be making this dish again.

I was excited to try this recipe but was hesitant about the onion soup mix. I should have trusted my instinct. The onion soup mix over powered the applesauce and apple. I even tried adding some cinnamon, but it didn't help.

This was, by far, one of the worst recipes I have found on All Recipes. The onion was completely over-powering; seemingly negating the flavor of applesauce. I would not reccommend this recipe.

This was alright, we did alter it a little tho, we only used 1/2 the pkg of onion soup and added brown sugar (1/3 c) and a dash of cinnamon. The chops were very juicy, tho we did eat it with the mixture scaped off the top, otherwise it was a little too appley. We will make this again although it wasnt eathshattering, it was good.

I took a risk and cooked this recipe for out of town company.  It was a HUGE HIT!  The chops were so tender and moist I was so amazed!  I think the next time I'll use 1/2 the onion soup though and I used home made chunky applesause.  WONDERFUL is all I have to say.

Thumbs up!  just finished dinner and my husband and I are very pleased.  I might have browned them too long but they were tender enough.  I added pineapple slices to the top and that was awesome!  I also added pick-a-pepper, which was a bad move (won't do that again.)  Had I stuck to the recepie and added just the pineaple it would have been excellent.  I am a terrible cook so we were all amazed I could produce something this good!

Aweful, I even followed the recipe (slightly cooking the apples before). I understood the applesauce and apple.  The onion soup was wrong on so many levels.  It was almost sour.  This was so bad my fiance couldn't even finish it.  I scrapped the apple/onion topping off the left over chops.  The actual pork was good; i gave it two stars for the cooking process.  I don't even know if I can attempt this again, leaving out the onion soup.

I should have read the other reviews before I made this.  It's in oven now but a few minutes ago I tried a bit of the mixture.   I too should have left out the onion soup mix.

I didn't take time to read the reviews so made as directed.  Half way through, I decided to dip a spoon in the sauce.  Bitter and strong onion soup flavor, so I sweetened some more applesauce with brown sugar and mixed it in.  It was very good.

It wasn't horrible...but it wasn't great. If you really want to wow someone this is not your recipe.

This was a big dissappointment! I made it for a special night and it was an embarrassment!

First off, I put half of the amt of onion soup mix - which I think all together, it shouldn't be in the recipe. 2nd, I had to cook it for 45 minutes instead of 30. Additionally, I think that even if the onion mix was ommitted, it would have a very bland, boring taste!

Definitely halve the onion mix.  This wasn't my style, but it wasn't bad.  I would recommend trying it out, as other people enjoyed the flavor.  It is pretty cheap and easy to make.  It is definitely a unique and interesting taste.

The pork chops tasted nicely, but the onion soup was a little too strong in the applesauce.

The pork chops themselves tasted great, however, the mixture of applesauce and onion soup mix DID NOT taste very good. I'm thinking about trying this recipe again but this time not adding the onion soup mix. I expected the meal to taste sweet but defintely it was not.

The recipe was easy enough to put together.  But, I didn't like the apple and onion mixture together.  The pork chops were juicy though and once I scraped the topping off, they were okay.  My husband liked it but not enough to care if I make it again.

This has become my special occasion dinner.  Made it last weekend when meeting my boyfriend's parents for the first time.  They gave it rave reviews!  I also combined this with another recipe and stuffed the pork chops.  Very good and will be making this recipe very often.

I followed the suggestions made by CERRAIN18TH, using boneless chops. They turned out well, but next time I think I would halve the cinnamon.

my husband said it was very good and he would definitely eat it again, but it was sweeter than he prefers.  I do not eat meat so I personally did not taste it, but it smelled very sweet, but delicious while baking.

My husband says, "Other than ham, I'm not a big fan of glazed meat."  I would have given it a 3, because of the unique flavor of the granny smith apples.  I don't particularly care for pork chops, so this recipe made them taste much better!

A few changes made this a 5 star recipe for me.  Followed a few reviews and cut the onion mix in half, also was a bit short on applesauce, so added a third a can of whole berry cranberry sauce.  Also sauteed a 1/4 onion when I browned the chops.  Turned out delicious.

I liked this and I made changes that other reviewers did as well.  I did the rub before hand of pepper, season salt and garlic powder (I didn't have any cinnamon on hand). I added butter chunks and brown sugar (eyeballed it) to the apple sauce and apple mixture. My son, who is picky, ate 1.5 pieces of pork chop.  We all loved the meal.
