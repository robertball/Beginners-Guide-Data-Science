Delicious! Could be called "Cranberry Cherry Tea" since the flavor of the cherry gelatin really comes through.  I have been drinking it both hot and cold, both ways are equally good.  I added the 1/2 cup sugar when I stirred in the cherry gelatin so the sugar would melt easier, rather than adding it at the end.

A little too sweet. Maybe leave out the added sugar?

Just made the Cranberry Tea for the Holiday Open House at my antique store.  It was such a hit.  My customers loved it and a few are returning to get a copy of the recipe.  I made each batch of tea for 20 servings but reduced the amount of sugar.  Perfect served warm with an assortment of mini pastries.

Absolutely love this. I would rather have this than coffee or tea on any of our cold minnesota winter days!! Thanks sooo much for submitting this one. (I like to use a coffee filter to steep the spices in it. It works great)

This is the best - everyone LOVED it!  Added the sugar while the mixture was still hot, but otherwise followed the recipe precisely.  Kept it warm in a crock pot.

I made this recipe for 80 plus people and almost everyone raved about it.  I think it was a bit too sweet and I may cut down a tad on the sugar, but overall VERY good!

This was very good. A nice change, especially on a very cold day. My husband liked it better with vodka though.

I found this recipe several years ago and it is one of most requested things I make for the holidays.  This year I am making it for the 4th time today and I usually make it for 48 servings at a time.  I think this speaks for it self as to how good it is.  We live in Texas so one of the best things I love a bout this recipe is that it is wonderful hot or cold depending on our weather.

Very good and very different. I had to at least double the spices, if not triple them to get a good balance. Otherwise it just tasted like a fruit punch

This recipe was fantastic. I didn't have any instant tea powder so i used iced sweet tea and brought it to a boil and ended up putting the spices straight in because I didn't realize they would collect. (My only problem) Also, even though I'm a total sweet tooth I used 1/4 cup of sugar. For the orange juice I used Simply Orange with Mango and for cranberry juice I used white cram-strawberry. I'm in love.
