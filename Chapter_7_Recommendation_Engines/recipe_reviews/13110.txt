I live in Spain and this was good!  A definate keeper.  I used rice vinager rather than the white wine (a little sweeter) and substituted tomato juice in place of the water/tomato paste.  Many raves from my guests.

Really impressed -- as were our two guests.  After a scorching hot day, this soup
was a pleasure to make as there is no standing over a stove!  It tasted the way
I always imagine and hope a Bloody Mary will taste though the few times I've
tried them I was disappointed.

Use RIPE tomatoes as it really does make a difference (I had just the usual 
underwhelming grocery store tomatoes and set them in a sunny window for a 
few days till they were red).  I knew they still weren't wonderful so used half 
fresh mixed with a can of chopped tomatoes in plain juice (skipped the 
tomato paste the recipe calls for as it seem a duplicate).

I also had to substitue red wine vinegar for the white and didn't make all the 
extra toppings - but I did make bruscetta/croutons.  To avoid fuss, I just sliced 
baguettes into longer diagonal slices and brushed them with a mixed up 
dressing of olive oil plus garden herbs (lots of oregano or marjoram, some 
thyme, a little rosemary) plus a pressed clove of garlic.  I put them on a rack 
under the broiler for just a few minutes and they were a wonderful complimentary
flavour (and it wasn't enough to warm up the kitchen!).

It made four generous servings.  We will definitely be making this again as all
the ingredients fit will fit the garden glut of tomatoes and peppers we predict!

Good recipe, and very flexible. By that I mean, you can play with the amount of tomatoes, vinegar, cucumbers, etc. I don't use the tomato paste at all, nor the eggs or olives. I've added red peppers at the end, red onion rather than regular, etc. Very good, and fun to make. My sceptical husband is now a convert!

I made two batches this weekend and both were good.  The second batch I made with rice vinegar as suggested in another review and I liked it much better.  The vinegar taste was not so strong.  Cilantro was also a very good addition. Don't skimp an the croutons!

Good base recipe. I chopped some of the vegies and the rest I whirled thru my food processor. Added cayenne for some zip, skipped the olives and instead of using water, I thinned with vegetable juice. Very refreshing and so healthy; maybe too healthy; might add a little vodka to this next time; HA, just kiddin'!! Thanks so much Michelle!

I served this meal to my friends on a hot summer night with some white wine and crusty bread and it was a hit.  It could use a little more of a kick (might add tobasco next time), but was satisfying as is.  Not perfect, but very good.

A few days later, the left overs took on more of the vinegar flavor.  If you make this it's important not to make it too long ahead of when you intend to serve it.

I made a lot of modifications, but wow, it made a great Gazpacho!   I skipped Step 3 and did not add water or chop additional vegetables, but I did add a diced leek before refrigerating, as well as one fresh jalapeno, diced. I used red pepper instead of green, low sodium/low sugar rice vinegar instead of white wine and omitted the black olives.  For the croutons, I used 2 Tbl fresh basil and 1 Tbl of dried oregano.   Before serving, I added the hard-boiled eggs and some chopped fresh herbs: parsley, basil and chives.  The end result made three large servings. The only thing I'd do differently is cut back on the garlic (maybe 1 clove in the soup, 1 clove on the croutons).

I love trying different versions of my favorite recipes, but in this case I think I still prefer my recipe. This was good, but not enough "zip" as written.  Didn't use the eggs, but the shrimp I added was a welcome addition.

I thought this was wonderful!  I didn't use the eggs or the tomato paste, and for spices I used basil and tarragon.  So pretty served in white bowls.

This is an excellent, flexible recipe.  I do not use the fresh tomatoes, especially if I am making it on the shoulder of the season (spring or fall).  I use nice quality diced tomatoes and it comes out delicious.

The easiest and freshest of all the gazpacho recipes listed here. You don't need tomato juice like the other recipes, and I also skipped the tomato paste and olives. I added a spoonful of pesto for flavor and texture, but it would be equally good without. A keeper!

Excellent balance of flavors.  I chopped the veggies for a long time, and finally chose to use a food processor with the rest.  It worked well.  (Is that allowed?=)   Is there any reason a food processor shouldn't be used here?  

Also, this recipe can be very easily spiced up into a base for salsa.

My husband loves Gazpacho and he loved this recipe. I made the soup as suggested and topped it with only the onion and scallions. We also added some crab. Great recipe!

Delicious, I followed some suggestions like to use rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar, also vegetables juice. I omited tomato paste. Rice vinegar is already spiced so I didn't adtded salt. It's a winner for the summer. Thank you Michelle Chen.

Very delicious.  We garnished with the hard-boiled egg, scallions and croutons (store-bought).  This has a refreshing flavor.  I used a hand blender to semi-blend before serving.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Did not add any water. Drained the seed pulp from the tomatoes through a fine sieve and used that liquid instead. The ingredient list has garlic but only for the croutons. Liking garlic we added three cloves minced to the gazparcho. Choose to go red with a red bell pepper rather than a green. Added one small hot red pepper finely minced. Liked the black olives in the soup. Used fresh coarse cracked pepper and milled seasalt. Made the croutons but did a double batch. Put a spoon of basil pesto on top of the soup in the bowl. Didn't make the side of chopped egg or cuc diced. Basil and other herbs were fresh from the garden.

When I made this it was fantastic.  It reminded me when I lived in Spain, father was in the US Air Force, and it brought me back.  Next time I fix this it will be in the summer though.

This Gazpacho tastes great. (Though I "had" to add some cilantro!) Good consistency, and all the veggies take part in the flavor.

Since you make it at about double concentration, it fits well in the fridge, and you can take out what you need any time.

I love gazpacho and was craving a nice fresh bowl of it.  I made this however, and was really disappointed.  I used white wine vinegar as specified, and the vinegar flavor was quite overpowering.  I salvaged the veggies by mixing with pasta and a can of garbanzo beans.  The result was pretty tasty, but I'm still looking for a great gazpacho recipe.

I've never had gazpacho before, and although I loved the flavor of this, I couldn't get used to eating it so cold. I ended up heating it through a little and really liked it. I could have done without the olives though, and the egg was forgotten about. Anyway, thanks, Michelle!

Good recipe. I did add a whole can of tomato paste for extra flavor and some extra veggies. The crutons were to die for.
