I gave this five stars, and I think people who like soup should check it out. I love this recipe, except that I dice my veggies and leave it chunky rather than puree it, and I add cooked chicken to the finished product. Other than that, I love it. My family garnishes it with Parmesan cheese.

I love beans and I'm always looking for different ways to prepare them.  This soup is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.

This soup turned out to be so savory and warming that it is now on my list of comfort foods. Instead of using all stock, I used a combination of stock and filtered water as the base along with the wine. This made adding more salt necessary. I also omitted the carrots, and I also did not purÃ©e the soup. However, to thicken it, I smashed some of the beans on the side of the pot which allowed me to control the consistency perfectly. The bacon and the topping really make this soup. Delicious!

This was very good! I made it as an appetizer, but it ended up being all we wanted for dinner! I added ham to the leftovers the next day, and it was even better!

Followed the recipe - pureed most of the soup and all of the veggies, created texture by mashing some beans against the side of the pot.  I thought this was REALLY DELISH!  I am not a white wine drinker but I did have a decent bottle on hand - I think that added a delicate aspect to the flavor.  THANKS!! UPDATE: I recently discovered my blood pressure is a bit high, so I am looking to avoid salt.  This in one of my favorite soups.  I never noticed how much salt is in canned beans. 
 So I made it with dried cannellini beans, using the 'rapid soak method '(cover with water, bring to a boil, boil 2 minutes, let sit one hour).   I substituted EVOO for the bacon.   Used the same amount of liquid as I had using canned beans.  Cooked soup, covered, on low heat for about 3 hours, although it was probably done in less time than that.   Substituted white and black pepper for the salt.      Good!  Sharing if this helps anyone :>).

Family tested and approved....No need to change a thing. Except to perhaps double the recipe.

This soup is excellent! Instead of cooking the bacon with the veggies, I make a ton of the bacon topping and put a great big dollop on each bowl of soup. Oh, yum!

I made this following the recipe exactly and found it to be very bland. I loved the crispiness of the topping and the pureed consistency of the soup but I think I'll find a different recipe for white bean soup next time I make it because I'm not sure how to alter this to make it better.

I had to hop online and give a 5 star rating the same night I made this for dinner. I was not expecting to like this, I only made it cause my husband has very high blood pressure and the white beans are good for him. (and yes I shamelessly left the bacon in). Soooo Good. Great flavor, great texture; I followed every bit of the recipe and would not change a thing... and 90% of the time there is something I change. I encourage anyone on the fence to give this a shot, at least once.

I soaked and cooked 3/4 cup cannellinis and 3/4 cup navy beans the day before instead of using canned beans, did everything else by the recipe and soup was delicious. I over cooked the topping garlic but it was still so good with the subtle taste of bacon.

We tried this hearty, substantial soup and really enjoyed it.  I used a tablespoon of the crushed red pepper flakes rather than the 1/4 spoon suggested but red pepper flakes vary in strength so I think it is a matter of adding them slowly until you get the "hit" that suits you and your family.

Excellent soup! I tweaked a bit . . . Used a pound of dried small white beans (soaked and cooked) and a 12-oz. package of bacon. Left out celery and wine. Did not blend or use the basil topping. This is a soup I will make frequently!

Very tasty.  Used turkey bacon to cut down on fat and left out the celery because I personally don't like celery.  An important tip- Make sure you blend the mixture in batches because if you put the entire thing in the food porcessor at once, it will leak out of the middle.  I wasn't thinking and poured the whole thing and ended up losing a lot of the broth.  It was still very good though!

Very good!  I was not sure I would like but I really enjoyed it.  I did not have fresh basil so I skipped the topping part and just added some more seasoning to the soup.

6.19.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/215948/tuscan-white-bean-soup/ ... While I liked this, it reminded me of linguine with white clam sauce - the sauce, obviously - without the clams.  'Could use a little pep.  Surprisingly light.

I made a few changes to this recipe based on what I had. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine, and 1/3 dried instead of fresh basil (not the same, I know). I also omitted the bacon. While the soup was very thick, it was very flavorful and delicious. I will definitely use fresh basil next time!

I made this recipe exactly as is, although I didn't use the brand name items (different brand of beans and homemade chicken stock).  It was delicious and the ultimate comfort food!  Will definitely make again.  Fast and simple, delicious dinner!

I love this soup, so easy to make!  I do sub out the chicken broth with veggie broth and use whole baby carrots instead of dicing.  I, like others, do no puree it.  One person said that found it a little bland, I'd suggest adding a bit more basil.

I love this recipe!! :-)

I made the recipe exactly as instructed. We found it to be bland and too bacony. I reheated and doctored the next day by adding sour cream to the soup and mixing in all the topping and it tasted so much better and more gourmet.

I made this soup and give it 5 stars! I didn't puree it, but left it chunky like we like it. Anyone who finds it bland didn't add all of the ingredients. It was perfectly seasoned with a little spicy kick, which we loved! I will definitely make this a regular in my kitchen!

Did anyone else notice this soup is very similar to split pea?  Here I thought I was making something very different (yes I even added the sauteed topping) and that is how my daughter evaluated the soup.  Good, but not crazy good.
