It might seem like nit-picking  but after all, when ingredients for basic recipes (like biscuits) are essentially the same, it's the little differences that can make a recipe good or great - I'd make a couple of changes if I were to make these again.  A little salty, a little too garlicky and, and, I'm surprised I'm saying this since I'm not a fan of sweetness in biscuits, not enough sugar.  I'd increase the sugar by half, more if you like your biscuits a little sweeter.  I'd decrease the garlic powder by half.  I realize that "garlic" is in the title but it isn't pleasant when the garlic lingers on your palate long after you've eaten the biscuit!  The salt, rather than enhancing the flavor, was a little sharp.  I'd reduce that by half as well.  The cheddar, while okay as is, was a little much - I would have been happier with half the amount called for with that too.  As for mixing, it seemed to me to make more sense to combine all dry ingredients, including the garlic powder, and to combine all the wet ingredients - in other words, to mix the mayonnaise and milk together - and then add the wet ingredients to the dry.  I like shortcuts whenever possible, so  I made these as drop biscuits, using a 1/4 cup measure for each.  The recipe doesn't direct you to do so, but I lightly greased the baking sheet with cooking spray.  Once out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter.

Wow these are great.  The only thing I did was not use the salt due to blood pressure and the biscuits were fine.  Other than that followed the instructions as written.  Will be making again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

A.MA.ZING!!!  I doubled the batch, but made it as instructed, except I didn't have any parsley.  They turned out incredible.  Will definitely be making them many more times.

Great biscuits!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I made drop biscuits.  I melted butter and used Costco garlic plus to brush on them while they were hot  -  Fantastic!

I don't know why there is mayo in this recipe... I doubled the quantity... I'd scale back on the garlic and salt. Cheese has enough salt alone.

Not sure what I did wrong but the dough was a gooey mess, we'll see how they taste.
