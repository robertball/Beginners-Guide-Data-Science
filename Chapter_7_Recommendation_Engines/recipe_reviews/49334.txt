I found the long list of ingredients to make this bread a little daunting but that was part of the fun of making it!  I was also attracted to the healthy additions of oats, bran, buttermilk and egg.  I wasn't sure of the necessity of the baking soda, why dry milk powder in addition to buttermilk or why oat bran in addition to rolled oats. I also used one of my two bread machines, the new one, that I'm not all that familiar with, particularly in what order I should PUT all these ingredients!  This was a true experiment, much as I now understand it must have been for the submitter, who remarked that this recipe is "the end result of trial, error and continuous tweaking."  Well, it paid off.  I really liked this hearty, oat-y, but soft bread.  I don't know how or why all the ingredients work together but they do. This is a great bread, something a little different than just plain white, and I actually prefer this to the heavier, more strongly flavored wheat bread. It's a beautiful creamy beige in color, with flecks of the oat bran throughout, reminding  you that you're eating something a little healthier for you than just plain white bread too. (Though just plain white Italian bread will ALWAYS be my favorite!) I'm not sure why in more than seven years only nine people have reviewed this recipe - the last review nearly two years ago -  but be assured this is a wonderful, grainy, flavorful bread I hope more people will try in spite of the long list of ingredients.

I used lite soymilk in place of the buttermilk and wheat germ in place of the bran since I was out of both, and the bread still came out really nice. I made it by hand and baked it for about 35 minutes at 350 in a loaf pan, and it made a huge puffy loaf. Tastes best plain.

Very good bread. I followed recipe exactly but needed to add about another couple ounces because the dough was too dry. The bread is moist and flavorful and baked up into a beautiful loaf. I used dry buttermilk powder mixed with water instead of commercial buttermilk. I will definitely be making this again.

A very flavorful bread.  We all loved it.  It kept its freshness for over 5 days.  Very dense but trust me -you'll love the flavor. GREAT TOASTED.

This made a beautiful loaf of bread that was delicious.  I made a loaf for my bread-loving boyfriend.  He took some to work and shared it with a work buddy who proclaimed it "(insert profanity here) good"...very high praise indeed coming from him!

The bread turned out O.K., rose to the top and had a nice texture.  The flavor was missing something.  I'll stick to my Oatmeal Bread which has molassis and more oats in it.

Nice bread.  Soft like a white loaf but chewy and with a hint of whole grain flavor too.  I thought it was the best of both worlds but wasn't counting on bf agreeing; surprisingly, he really liked it although he muttered the crust was a tad hard.  Very nice, easy loaf.  I made my own buttermilk with lemon and milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

Superb! Some of the best bread that has ever come out of my bread machine! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, but still used the "white" cycle and it came out perfect!

This bread tasted okay; it didn't stand out as good or bad, just bread. It rose nicely and the texture was good. It was a bit too salty.

I don't own a bread machine but was looking for a recipe to use up some buttermilk.  If you don't have a bread machine, you can still use this same basic recipe, using standard bread-making technique (although I used my stand mixer to knead), and it turned out absolutely delicious.   I had no oat bran so I added an extra 1/4 cup of oats, and I left out the dry milk powder, and decreased the salt to 1 tsp.  I used one sachet of active dry yeast, which I proofed in a little warm water with a tsp of sugar first. Then I pretty much dumped everything except the flour into my mixer bowl and mixed with the regular mixing blade for a few minutes, then switched to the dough hook and mixed in the flour (3 cups was sufficient). Once everything had pulled together I kneaded with the dough hook on low speed for about 7 minutes.  I put the dough into a buttered bowl and covered it with a towel, then allowed it to rise for an hour. Punched it down, and put it into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper, allowed it to rise for another 45 minutes. Then baked for 23 minutes @ 325 degrees.  It was absolutely delicious.  (Did I say that already?)

Loved it. A little different from a wheat bread. Just a little sweeter but a very good texture.

This bread was so good! The only change I made was using wheat bran instead of oat bran because that is what I had. The next time I make this (and there will definitely be a next time) I will use the light setting on my machine instead of medium since the crust was overdone.  Otherwise, it was scrumptious!

I made this bread to eat with dinner tonight and my family loved it!  I used 1 1/3 cups wheat flour and intended to put in 2 more cups of all purpose flour.  When I went to check on it I realized I forgot to add it (oops) and started trying to add it before the first rise.  I didn't succeed in adding then entire two cups, I probably left about 1/4 cup or so because the bread was so heavy I thought my bread machine motor was going to break.  It sounded seriously stressed.  The only other change I made was adding 1 tbsp. of wheat gluten.  It rose to a perfect 1.5 lb loaf in my bread machine. I decided to make another loaf the same night for French toast in the morning.  Knowing the flour problem I purposely left 2/3 cup flour out to add at the end of the kneading cycle.  My goal was to get all of it added since others had followed exactly and had it work.  Well I got almost all of it...probably about 1/6 cup was remaining.  I just checked it now and again it is perfect in size and smells great.  Next I will try adding extra buttermilk and possibly a little vegetable oil. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This bread was good, but it didn't especially stand out from other bread machine breads I have made.  I'll make it again.
