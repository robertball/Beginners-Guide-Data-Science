I have only made this with chicken breasts but it is AWESOME. It is one of my all time favorites. The longer you marinate the better it is! I usually just use the oil, limes & garlic. Yummy! I also like to slice the breasts & use with grilled veggies for fajitas!

This was very tasty.  I didn't have limes, so used lemons.  Didn't have lawry's seasoned pepper, so used fresh pepper.  This is definitely a recipe to make over and over.  Will get lawry's seasoned pepper to try with this recipe, but, I can't see how it would taste any better.  Delicious!

One word-DELICIOUS!  This was a huge hit at our house, even my 4, 6 and 10 year olds loved it!  I used regular pepper, and garlic powder with the olive oil, lime, and seasoned salt.  This will be at the front of my recipe box for sure!!!!!Thanks for a great recipe.

My family liked this recipe. The chicken was very moist and flavorful, however very, very salty. 

I used bottled lime juice in the bag and used fresh limes to squeeze on the chicken while cooking.  
I will make this recipe again. 
Thanks-

This is a favorite recipe in my family.  The only thing I do differently is to use 2 cornish game hens quartered.  They are wonderful and take just 25 minutes.  I grill for 5 minutes, then turn every 5 minutes, squeezing the limes and sprinkling with Garlic Salt.  Last night I had to use chicken pieces and I didn't think it was as tasty as the cornish hens.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!  This recipe is outstanding!  It is quite simple and yet the taste is incredible.  My family prefers boneless skinless chicken breasts and I don't typically have "seasoned pepper" on hand, so I just use regular ground black pepper.  Thanks for an AWESOME way to grill chicken!

Lots of flavor and much yummier than I expected. My husband loved it too.  I used the leftovers to make pita sandwiches the next day.

Marinated my chicken for about 4 hours. Flavor was great. Had to bake it in the oven as we had a snow storm today and I didn't feel like grilling in it! Family loved the flavor. I used garlic powder instead of salt, thinking with the seasoned salt it might be just too salty. Squeezed the lime pieces over the chicken before popping it in the oven. Will make again when I can shovel out the grill.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.I squeezed the limes after placing them into the bag.  The meat was very moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make again.

Surprisingly full of flavor. My variation uses seasoned salt, garlic pepper salt, and lime juice instead of limes. I cube chicken too for more flavor. Used this marinade for chick kabobs on the grill- it was heaven. Have also sauteed chicken in the marinade- just as good if not better. Can not believe how easy and delicious!

This sounded so simple and easy, I thought it would just be so-so, but it was fantastic! I omitted the garlic salt with parsley because I didn't have any. Also used bottled key lime juice instead of fresh. I think the chicken was better the day after as leftovers! Thank you for a great, easy recipe!
