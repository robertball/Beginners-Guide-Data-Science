I'm not typically a fan of refrigerated biscuits but I liked this recipe and thought it woud pair well with the tortellini soup I made. Homemade rolls this is not, but in a pinch this semi-homemade version was a nice treat for something hot and fresh from the oven. I I made no changes to the recipe and was entirely pleased.  Just the right amount of "cheesiness" and a nice blend of herbs.

I had to cut the recipe down to 1 can of biscuits as I only had an 8 X 8 pan. These were simple and  hand the spices on hand.What I really liked is I didn't have to go shopping for anything extra to make this.. I used a 46 cent can of biscuits...

These were really, really good. I was actually surprised how well they turned out. This is a great recipe to use up extra cans of biscuits.The only thing I did differently was add parsley flakes and some paprika for added color. Will be making this again.

I used the spices of this recipe with the "Herb Biscuits" recipe...using the idea to quarter the biscuits from that recipe and bake them in a cake pan (one package instead of two).  That recipe didn't call for cheese so I omitted, but next time I will try with cheese (we're cheese people).  The flavors melded perfectly.  Can't wait to make again.

These are pretty good. Great way to "spice up" canned biscuits. Gotta love inexpensive, easy to prepare foods.

Easy and very good.  I used one tube of "Grands" biscuits, which makes 8 large biscuits and just fit into the 11x17 pan perfectly. I kept the rest of the ingredients and baking time the same.  They turned out great.  The only change I would make next time is to use more garlic powder.  Goes great with a pasta dinner or with soup!

Ever the pessimist, I was thinking "why put in an 11x17 dish?  Seriously, cook for 25 minutes?"  I am so glad I tried these.  We have biscuits at least 4 nights a week and this was a wonderful change!  Great with pasta. The butter made the biscuits crunchy on the bottom but kept them soft in the middle.  The biscuits puffed up and fit the pan perfectly. YUM!

These are fantastic. I especially liked the dill weed. I'm a little biased here -- everything with dill weed tastes fantastic to me! My only caution with this recipe is that I do not personally think it needs quite as much butter as the recipe calls for. I did add a sprinkling of black pepper, because I love it. Thanks for the recipe, it certainly made whack'ems taste a lot better than I expected!

These were good.  They went well with the spaghetti marinara that I made.  Next time I think I will add some grated garlic before adding the cheeses.

Considering this was canned biscuits, these were pretty good!  Great for when you need a quick dinner bread.  I used an 8-pack of Grands biscuits in a 9x13 dish and they were perfect.  Hubby and the kids especially liked them!

These weren't "wow" but we enjoyed them. I was expecting a lot more flavor, maybe I didn't do something right. I used 8 jumbo biscuits (16 oz) and put them in a greased 9x13 pan. Like another reviewer, I liked that the bottoms were nice and browned. I'll probably try something like these again, though!
