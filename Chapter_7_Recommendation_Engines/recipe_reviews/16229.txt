Very good fruit dip!  I didn't need quite so much of it, but it was definitely a hit.

I usually make the full calorie version of this dip. While this wasn't horrible it just wasn't as good. I think I'll stick to the original version.

Fast, easy, and this made my husband very happy as he had "caramel dip" for his apples. I used Neufchatel cheese. The flavor was very good and caramel tasting. I scaled this down to 2 servings and they were generous indeed. I'll fix this again. Thanks for the tasty recipe Cindy!

My grand daughter made this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is so good and easy. As others have said, it disappears fast.
