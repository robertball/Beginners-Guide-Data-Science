Just loved the flavor combo of the different fruits. Was an excellent pie. Probably one of the best pies I've made. A keeper.

I made two of these for a group of 12, and the raves were awesome!  One guest said it is absolutely the best pie she has ever eaten in her life.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so pretty, with the orange, red and blue fruit juices bubbling through the lattice top.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  It is a magnificent ending to a meal!

Have you ever tried a new recipe & it overwhelmingly exceeds your expectations??  This was it tonight. This is very tasty as written! But I always make some tweaks, so here they are:
Since I only have deep dish pie pans, I added a bit more fruit (1 cup), 4x the lemon juice (I like some tang with my sweet), a little less white sugar, double the cinnamon & added a 1/8 tsp nutmeg, plus a tsp each of vanilla & almond extract. Hoo boy... This is a winner!!

So incredibly delicious and simple.  My husband LOVES  pie, and while he has one that is his favorite, this one is the new go-to for summer months while peaches and cherries are in season. Amazing -- only change I made was a 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Loved it!!!

I made this pie just as the recipe days except I used a little more of each fruit. It minded up great. I used a lattice for the topping as I do that really well. There were no leftovers and the pie disappeared vert quickly. Everyone just loved I and I got a lit of kudos. This will go in my cookbook as a favorite.

Absolutely the best and a big hit at our dinner party last night. I followed the recipe exactly and threw in a few raspberries for fun. I can’t wait to make this again.
