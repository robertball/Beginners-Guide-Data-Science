This cake IS very good, but I'm only giving it 4 stars because the directions are wrong.  I checked my cake @ 30 min. (because I never want to overcook anything) and it was pretty far away from being done.  Checked it at 35 (like recipe says) still runny, 40 min still not done.  I finally took it out after 43 minutes because I hate anything overdone.  I wish I'd left it in another five minutes because the middle still wasn't cooked.  But the rest of the cake was and with the topping it is delicious!

This IS yummy.  I cut way back on the sugar, though, - 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown.  And I added cinnamon to the batter and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 45 minutes.  Some chopped nuts added to the topping were the finishing touch.  Mmmm.

Delicious.  Just cook the topping on top of the stove first, it will thicken up then spread and broil.

Excellent cake.  Mine also took closer to 50 minutes to bake.  I added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in addition to the nutmeg.  Very easy and very yummy!

This is close to the old Quaker Oats "Sunshine" Cake...which uses 1 C boiling H2O to 1 C Quick Oats, 1 t cinnamon and 1 1/3 C flour with the broiled icing! Alway been a favorite staple at our house from kids thru Grandkids!

Great tasting cake, with a caramel flavour.  I had to cook mine 10 min extra.  Used desicated coconut for topping, but found the topping a little greasy.  Next time I'll try the flaked coconut, or use less butter.

A very old favorite recipe!  We always used cinnamon rather than nutmeg. My daughter took this recipe, as an assignment, to a Bethesda, MD Junior High cooking class. Her teacher "insisted" that the recipe was wrong and the topping had to be baked rather than broiled - and then gave her a failing grade because the cake was overcooked!

The cake was great, but the 'frosting' top wasn't so thrilling. Definitely too much butter. After spreading it on, I waiting a minute for it to settle & then I had to get paper towels to blot up a LOT of butter. I'm a butter lover, too, so I was a little shocked at how greasy it would have been had I not done that. I'd prefer a thicker topping, a ganache maybe? But the cake was excellent, a BIG hit w/ my 2 & 4 year olds.

My mother used to make this cake when i was growing up so it was great to find the recipe and make it again after so many years.  The cooking time, i agree, is off...i had to bake it for another 20 minutes for it to be done..but was worth the extra cooking time!

Cake was very dense but enjoyable, topping was more like a thin macaroon than a frosting? We all liked it, all ate it - but it was a bit odd.

I usually like to make a recipe as it is, without any changes, the first time. I liked the nutmeg flavor---delicate, mellow. I was not concerned about the "wet oatmeal" ingredient, as I have a  chocolate cake recipe made the same way. There was definitely a variance with the cooking time---it took an hour instead of 45 minutes. I just kept checking it every 5 minutes. Next time, I'll use a larger pan than recommended. I remember a delicious broiled-topping cake from my Jr. High school cafeteria. They didn't skimp on the topping, and it always sold out early. I actually plan on increasing the amount of broiled topping on this oatmeal cake recipe the next time I make it.

Tasty cake! Took quite a bit longer than stated in the recipe- about 60 minutes here.  Used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Skipped the homemade frosting and to save time, used the store bought coconut pecan frosting. Really tasty! Will used this again.

i made this with high expectations.   Took much longer to bake than was told.  I used half the butter it said to use in the topping. I also used butter instead of shortening in the cake and added a little cinnamon.  Easy to make.   Very moist!   Couldn't taste the oats or  even tell it had oats in it (texture)!   Taste was ok, but nothing great.                much better next day

Delicious. The cake is so moist and the frosting is heaven! I do prefer cinnamon to nutmeg for the spice though.

This cake was so delicious. Our neighbors came over twice in one day to have some. It did take closer to 50 minutes for it to be done in my oven. I imagine the coconut topping would be great on box yellow or chocolate cakes too when I don't have the time to make the oatmeal cake from scratch, but the cake/topping combination was incredible.

I was a bit unsure about a cake with soaked oats in it, but that just made me more curious to give it a try.  I halved the sugars to half a cup each and also added cinnamon.  I was not game enough to try the suggested topping, so made an orange cream cheese frosting instead.  Very, very nice!

I can't rate this because it was actually my husband who made it (his first cake!). But I was impressed; it turned out great! The nutmeg stood out more than I expected. I thought it was pretty good, he (not being a fan of oatmeal taste) didn't care too much for it. I would give it 4 stars. I'll probably make it again myself a few times again, as it was a very yummy cold-weather treat.

I will not make this recipe again I did not make any changes to the cake.  It was tasty--just too dense and heavy. There are so many other cakes that are lighter.  I did, after reading other reviewer comments reduce the sugars to 1/2 and guests thought the topping was still too sweet.  It isn't really a pretty cake to serve either.  I won't be making it again as there are so many other cakes that I prefer to bake and serve (carrot, red velvet, Italian cream...)

My cake was raw in the middle after 40 minutes.  I loved the coconut icing, but next time, I will bake it for 50 minutes.

Verry good and moist. I thought it tasted like banana bread, probably due to the nutmeg. I did not use any frosting, it doesn't need it, and i baked it in a bundt pan. Makes a great coffee cake that way.
