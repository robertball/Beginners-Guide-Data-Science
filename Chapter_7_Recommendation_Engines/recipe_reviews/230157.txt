To make this super easy, I loaded the feed tube on the food processor with the halved sprouts and sliced them.  The lemon juice really brightens the flavor resulting in a tasty bacon dressing which would be good on so many things.  Honestly, I don't think the brussels sprouts flavor shined through and wondered just how much differently it would have tasted with regular sliced cabbage.  Either way, it was good!

We are big fans of Brussel sprouts, the underestimated, under appreciated gift from the garden!  The bacon dressing is one I've used many times and is basically the same one I use for German-style potato salad (without the lemon juice).  The entire dish is very flavorful and a most welcome change-up for a side dish.  I did follow the suggestion of lutzflcat and used the food processor to slice the veggies after I cut out the core.  Easy and delicious!

I am one of the "don't like BS" but I made this recipe and its now thumbs up for BS!  If you want a different salad recipe then this is a good one, and if you take it to a pot luck rest assured that your salad will be the only salad made with BS.  I will keep this recipe and make it again.

Roasted the halved sprouts in butter first instead then tossed them in the bacon dressing... My wife and even my 10 year old daughters loved them!!! Highly recommend this recipe!

I added Tabasco to the dressing instead of cayenne. I think the addition of craisins or something similarly sweet would be a nice addition.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was really good.  Didn't use the oil to cook the bacon (bc why do you need it?  Just adds fat) and drained some of the bacon fat before adding rest of ingredients.

My husband loves brussels sprouts, but I do not. I have been looking for a recipe we can both enjoy. This is it!  The flavor of the fresh sprouts is much better than cooked, in my opinion. 

I made this for our family first, they loved it!  I made it again for an extended family gathering where everyone, except one young nephew, enjoyed it. (I highly agree with lutzfulcat's recommendation of using a food processor; thinly slicing all those sprouts was tedious)

 I did find the cider bacon dressing to be a bit bitey as written, but added another 1-2 T of brown sugar to balance it out. ( I also liked the flavor of the lemon juice).  When I made it for extended family, I tossed in 1/4 C finely chopped onion, 1 zested carrot and a handful of dried cranberries. I  brought some blue cheese crumbles to add to taste. Very good, a different salad to enjoy.

This was very good, but I had some left over and tried to eat it the next day, I did heat it up a little. It tasted really bad, so I guess when you make it, you have to eat it the same day.

I have only recently found out that I now like brussel sprouts. Not all brussels, but when cooked right they can be a great side dish. So I have been looking for a new way to use them other than roasting and pan frying and stumbled onto this recipe. What a great way to feature this veggie! Its very similar to a warm cabbage slaw and definitely added the fresh crunch my dinner plate needed. I will admit that I hate the smell of apple cider vinegar but once all combined it is not only tolerable but gives a great acidity that cut all the other fats on my plate. My wife definitely liked this dish and is very happy I found this recipe. Keep the recipes coming Chef John!

This was so delicious.  Made the recipe just as written, everyone loved it and ate the whole bowl.  Planning on taking it to Thanksgiving to expose my family to something new.  Do not skip the step of cutting out the core of the brussel sprout.  It's what can make them bitter tasting.  They were delicious just like this.  A little labor intensive on the prep for cutting them up but totally worth the end result.  Will make this many times in the future.

I thought it was very good and a nice change from the same old salads we usually have. I didn’t use oil to fry the bacon and I sliced some green onions because I had them but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I saw one reviewer say it was not good the next day so we just dressed our salads in our own bowls and then saved the salad and dressing in separate containers. It was fine leftover, we just heated the dressing and put it over the remaining salad.

I thought it was good, but you really need to shred the brussels sprouts finely. This recipe makes quite a bit, I'd guess more like 6 good sized side salad servings.

I wanted a low carb version, and to use up some kale and green onions in my fridge.  So chopped kale along with the Brussels sprouts and made my dressing with toasted sesame oil, mayonnaise and lemon juice with the bacon and some salt.  Microwaved the chopped veggies for  1 min and mixed in the green onions and dressing.  Served it warm.  It was a hit!

We loved this salad!  I might trying white corn syrup or a guava syrup next time, they're already dissolved.  Looking forward to making this a main dish summer salad by adding some cooked white beans and topping with hard boiled eggs.  Marilyn

Surprisingly fantastic! My husband's first reaction was "raw?" but we both loved it! Added a bit of extra meat on top and made a hearty, filling dinner salad out of it. Will definitely be experimenting with different varieties of this recipe!

Made a double batch for our family Xmas Eve dinner. Added sweetened, dried cranberries to make it a touch more seasonal, other than that followed the recipe to the letter. Ît was a hit with the family! This one is making it into our regular rotation. Thanks to Chef John for the tip on slicing Brussels Sprouts for raw salads. I’ve done it before without removing the core and this turned out much better. Classic flavors in a new way, great recipe!

I don't think I'll ever roast Brussel Sprouts again after making this. I used White Balsamic Vinegar and less than what is called for. Subbed Maple Syrup for the brown sugar.  Added raisins for sweetness.

I love this dish! So does everyone else that eats it! For Thanksgiving I added craisins and pan toasted pecans. Huge hit!!

I followed the recipe and liked it. Next time I'll try cooking the shredded sprouts a bit until slightly softened or even slightly carmelized. But it was good "as is".
