How Ironic! I had leftover chicken wings from the superbowl party (way too many choices and made way too much food as usual). So I deboned them heated up the already sauced meat tossed that with some chopped celery and then put homemeade blue cheese dressing out for people to assemble their own sliders. A BIG hit!

Delicious and so easy! I used Kings Hawaian Whole Wheat Mini Rolls and Lite Ranch Salad Dressing to dip them in. Lot's of heat from Frank's Buffalo Sauce & the finely chopped carrot and celery give it a very pleasing crunch. Thanks for sharing!

made these for my family with some changes/additions and they were a hit!! i am a novice and this recipe was easy and awesome! i have 3 tummies that love the heat and my mom can't take it so i saw that frank's makes a "sweet hot bbq" sauce (and they were 2 for 3 at the store!) so i made a separate marinade for her (a lot of dishes so i didn't mix!) i used crumbled fat free feta cheese (since blue cheese is so sharp and she's a wuss) and estimated enough carrots and celery for her batch and baked it in a smaller square pan. i used the "hot buffalo" version of frank's for the main batch and they turned out incredible! 1 heat-lover was struggling a bit because it's HOT! i also used reduced fat crumbled blue cheese (i try to make stuff that is as healthy as possible) organic boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks and browned some italian dinner rolls in the oven that have barely any fat and organic ingredients! great recipe...thanks for sharing!!

Incredible melding of flavors! Husband loved them! I did alter a tiny bit. I used boneless chicken breast and didn't add the blue cheese to the chicken bake. I added butter and blue cheese to the hoagie roll and broiled them for just a couple minutes (maybe 30 seconds too long haha). I added spinach leaves and some blue cheese dressing also. They was yummy!

I was disappointed. I was so excited to try this recipe and frankly it isn't cheap to make. I cut back a bit on the blue cheese AND THANK HEAVENS I DID! It was overwhelming - and I like blue cheese. Probably won't bother with again. Too bad. Might try just chicken and sauce together on a bun with some blue cheese dressing but I'm deleting this from my box.

Great recipe! I wasn't too sure about so much blue cheese but it turned out delicious. I used a 4 oz container of crumbled with about 1 1/2 pounds of cooked chicken cutlets that I shredded. I thought about making it as another reviewer mentioned (topping with blue cheese dressing) but the melted blue cheese really does give it a nice sharp flavor. Not too overpowering just delicious and easy! I will make these often!

The blue cheese was really over powering in this. I would definitely use way less next time.

MMMMMichele these sliders were MMMMMGOOD! I forgot to add the veggies. I had some dinner rolls that are a little sweet I split them open and layed the bottoms in a baking then topped them with the buffalo chicken mixture. I put their hats back on and warmed them up in the oven. Only my DD and I like blue cheese and it gave the sliders just the right taste. My DS thought they were delish too! Really great weeknight dinner idea with school starting next week. I almost bought a roasted chicken but decided to roast my own glad I did. It saved me a few precious bucks. Thanks Michele.

I want to start by saying that I LOVE buffalo chicken ANYTHING. These were so-so. It may have just been the texture personally I think it was the celery. Next time I think I will leave it out and then put it on top of the finished sandwiches. Also I did not add the carrots I'm just not sure how that would have worked together... The chicken mixture was good though. I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce. In theory these are a good idea I just need to tweak them to my own personal taste.

I made this for a Superbowl Party. I made it with chicken I grilled myself (I already had the chicken in the freezer just used what I had). Fixed it sorta like the receipe and used Texas Pete Buffalo Sauce. I cut back on the blue cheese (not a big fan of it) and no carrots (forgot them). I used ranch dressing on the rolls before adding the chicken mixture. My kids LOVED them. I'm glad I cut back on the bleu cheese for me. Was just enough kicking flavor. Will be making again. Can't wait to try it with the rotisserie chicken.

Hubby and I loved them but were too spicy for our kids. Next time will make two batches one more ranch based with less spice for them

Delicious easy recipe. I used the small sweet bread rolls and toasted them in the oven for 5 minutes. Great paired with carrot and celery sticks or a crispy slaw. Good gametime food.

Very tasty. To save a few fat calories I used 1 part Franks and I part chicken stock as a replacement for the butter in the wing sauce. It tastes the same but came out a little watery. Probably removing the lid from the dish at some point might help that out.

The whole family loved this. Omitted the carrots and just used a couple squirts of bluecheese dressing instead of the crumbled bluecheese. Will be making these over and over. Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried it and loved it. The rotisserie chicken is often sold much cheaper than a raw whole chicken but it seriously depends on the store. I got one for 2.99 at one store 3.99 at another and 7.99 at another. It really depends on the store. I couldnt get a raw one for under 5. I recently started buying the rotisarie at the cheaper store for sandwiches and fillings for tacos casseroles etc.

YUM!!! This was wonderful as a slider but it would also be great as a dip. I made Bill's Blue Cheese dressing to put on top and that just took it to a whole 'nother level. We will definitely be making this again.

This is an awesome dish for a football bash! The blue cheese really tames the heat though. I will try it again with a little less blue cheese and a little extra hot sauce

I made this recipe but I used franks red hot thick sauce and peppercorn ranch instead of regular buffalo wing sauce. It turned out to have a spicey and peppery zing. We loved it

Very good! Most of my family and friends don't like blue cheese so when I brought them to a gathering I told nobody the ingredients. Everybody loved them and all were surprised to hear about the cheese.... will make again!

Super easy and was a big hit! I used Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. I didn't add the carrots and celery since no one in my household really wanted that added. I did add blue cheese crumbles and a blend of shredded cheese and mixed it with the chicken prior to baking it and it turned out wonderful. None left over.

This turned out terribly. I used half the amount of blue cheese it says to use and it STILL was waaaay too much. Definitely won't be making this again.

It sounded good but it was dry. I'm thinking maybe some actual blue cheese dressing mixed in with the chicken might do the trick.

I followed this recipe pretty much to the tee. With sandwich add ons like spinach leaves ranch/blue cheese dressing and heated buns this was great. I did listen to other viewers and I only used (1) 4 oz blue cheese- was plenty. This will look very dry when you put in 9x13 but stick with it. Use slider rolls - toasted. Delish!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he loved it!!! The chicken I used was rather large so I added a little extra buffalo wing sauce and I didn't quite have 2 cups of blue cheese so I added some Feta which I just happen to have and it came out great!! I had a football get together later on the same day and at first a few people complained about the carrots but by the end of the afternoon it was all gone....I guess the carrots weren't a problem after all. I will definitely make this again!!

Just made this for the first time this evening. Started by roasting a whole chicken. Shredded into a casserole dish mixed in the diced celery and carrot some Frank's Buffalo Chicken sauce and blue cheese. Used way less blue cheese than the recipe called for. Probably about a 1/4 cup instead of 2 cups. Had the right amount of blue cheese to cut through the spicy sauce without overpowering. Will definitely be making this again!

We made this for the super bowl and loooooooooooooooooooooved it. Since a lot of reviews said there was too much blue cheese I cut the amount in half to one cup. I also increased the amount of buffalo wing sauce to about one cup. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly (I may have sprinkled a little black pepper over the tray before putting it into the oven). It was great and easy. The most time consuming thing was de-boning the rotisserie chicken and chopping the celery and carrots. There was no need to add extra sauce buffalo sauce blue cheese or add blue cheese dressing at the end. I used Hawaiian rolls and toasted them in the oven for a few minutes. It was amazing.
