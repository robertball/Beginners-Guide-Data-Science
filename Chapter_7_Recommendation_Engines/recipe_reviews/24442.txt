I have made this recipe twice. First I made it with the changes suggested by some readers: 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 3 cups cranberries, 1 cup sugar and a 9 X 13 pan. But the applesauce diluted the intense cranberry flavor, and the crust wasn't substantial enough (the bars were too flimsy). So the second time, I used the following ingredients, also in a 9 X 13 pan:   4 cups cranberries 1 1/3 cups white sugar 3 tablespoons orange zest 2 cups rolled oats  1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup packed light-brown sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 sticks butter  I baked it for about 35 minutes at 370 degrees. The cranberry filling had the intense flavor I wanted, and the crust was substantial, making for a firm bar.

I doubled this for a 9x13" pan, with a few modifications to the filling only.  Instead of doubling the cranberries, I added the directed 2 cups of cranberries, then I added 2 cups of peeled, chopped, apple and cooked till tender and reduced. Then I added 1/4 cup of apple juice with 1 Tbsp. cornstarch stirred in to thicken filling.  The end result was an awesome filling without the bite that often accompanies cranberry recipes.  Everybody at my picnic loved it!

These are dangerously delicious.  I make them in a 9 x 13 pan, increasing the amount of filling by adding unsweetened applesauce to the cranberry mixture.  I use whole wheat flour.

This bar has everything a person wants in a desserty bar. Crunchy,Tart,Chewy,Sweet! All rolled up in one delicious bar! If you like cranberry treats, then this one is for you! I made it in a 9x13 instead of a 9x9(didn't own one). And increased the cranberries to 2 cups, and increased the sugar to 1c. Other than that the recipie is wonderful!! Putting it in a foil lined pan makes removing this dessert a snap, as well as cutting them into squares. A+ Nicely done!

This recipe is GREAT! I work at a coffee shop and we order cranberry walnut bars from somewhere else. I tried them and wanted to find a recipe so that I could make them at home. This recipe looked like it was the closest match so I tested it out. I added about 1/2 a cup more oatmeal, 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts, as well as some allspice, cinnamon and cloves to the dry mixture and used 1 (16 oz) can of whole berrry cranberry sauce as the middle spread instead of making the cranberry sauce myself.  They turned out amazing and almost the exact flavor of the ones we sell at the coffee shop!  One more thing, I did use a 9x9 pan put I had no extra because I make a very thick bottom layer and also worked the bottom layer up the side of the pan halfway. I saved just enough of the mixture to cover the top of the cranberry sauce.

I've made thi recipe for my husband's lunches for the last three weeks.  The first week was with the cranberries.  Last week I used blueberries.  This week it is raspberries with a few cranberries thrown in.  He loves them!  I think I have figured out the problem with the left over dry ingredients.  Usually I increase the recipe for a 9x13 baking dish. This week, I made the recipe as shown for a 9x9 baking dish and still used a 9x13 baking dish.  It was just the correct amount of dry ingredients with not a ton left over.

I carefully followed the instructions for the crust, though I was leery of the amounts.  Even though I increased the amount of butter called for to 1 cup, the crust was very dry and it tasted "floury".  AND, what is the baking powder for?  There are no ingredients to activate its leavening action, so it does nothing.   I will probably make these again, but will use common sense in making the crust:  less flour, more butter, a bit more salt and definitely no baking powder.

Really yummy! I only had a 9 x 13 pan, so I increased all of the ingredients by 1.5 and baked about 25 minutes. I then broiled for just about 2 minutes to give it an extra crispness. I substituted lemon zest for orange zest, and added just a dash of lemon juice to the cranberry mixture. The only thing I'd do differently is add a tiny bit more brown sugar to the crust next time. A really great snack on its own, or downright divine warmed up, drizzled with caramel and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Even the kids loved it.

This was good, but the proportions are way off.  Next time I would double the cranberry mixture.

I totally cheated and used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce (it was about to expire and that was why I chose a cranberry recipe).  I cut the crust down to eleven servings and put it in a pie plate with extra time in the oven.  It was flipping awesome--but really sweet, so those that don't like that beware.  Somebody mentioned adding extra butter to the oats but I found it to be pretty buttery and rich with the amount in the recipe (and I LOVE butter).

If you put fresh cranberries, sugar and lemon zest in a pan...it is dry. Nothing to boil!!! I winging it by adding some OJ. Fingers crossed! But recipe needs to be corrected.

Really good but this makes enough dry ingredients for a 9x13 pan.  You may want to increase the cranberries to 3 cups and add an extra 1/4c sugar.

These are outrageous!  I've made a second batch already!  I used lemon peel instead of orange peel for the second batch and I like it even better!  "Wait until cool to cut"  You've got to be kidding!  These are half eaten up right out of the oven!

This recipe is so easy and yummy!!  I used fresh strawberries instead of cran and used lemon zest instead of orange and it came out soooooo good!! . I cut them into  bars and then cut the bars in half on the slant and it looks and tastes like store bought.Used an 8x8 pan so had to bake for about 8 minutes longer.

I made this in a 9x13 pan by increasing crust by 1 1/2 and doubling the filling. I added 2 tsp cinnamon to the crust and added the juice of 1 orange to the filling. I used about 2/3 of the crust on the bottom and 1/3 on top.

These were delicious!  One of our favorites now.  I added six more servings to the recipe to create more crust. I used a 9x13 pan and the same amount of filling.  They came out perfect.  I feel like less filling makes it easier to cut and not soggy.  I also added a little bit more of orange zest to make it more orangey.

Great for Thanksgiving! I had already made fresh cranberry sauce, so I was able to skip the first step and use the extra sauce I had made.

Delicious. The first time I made them I only had quick oats available. They were very good but next time I used large flake oats and the texture and flavor was much more to my liking. I have also used a mixture of blueberries and cranberries with great results.

I made these following the recipe exactly. The oat part was definitely floury. I think doubling the cranberry portion would've helped, and possibly adding more butter or something to moisten up the crust/topping. My topping was powdery instead of crumbly. However, the overall taste was good and my husband ate most of the batch. He said it's like a cranberry version of one of those fruit/grain bars you get at the grocery store.

These were very good, I made a double batch so it could fit in a 13x9 pan and the family devoured them.   A little sweet but still very good.

I think this would be far better baked in a larger pan.  In a 9" square pan it is really thick and the top crumb mixture never really baked properly, even with more than 10 minutes extra baking time.

These are really good. They did take longer than stated to cook. I had to add a little water to the cranberries and they took about 25 min to cook down on low. The bars browned closer to 25 min. I didn't have oranges but found out after I started the recipe (sorry). I'm sure that it would be as good with the orange zest.I used Snoqualamie Falls oatmeal I sprinkled some cinnamon into the crust. They are a little sweet but they are very good while still a little warm...and you could serve them with ice cream...I am having one now :) 
Thank you so much for the post!
I used a 9x13 pan too....

Very tasty.  I used a 14 oz can of whole cranberry sauce instead of cooking frozen/fresh cranberries.  It made the recipe even easier!!  Like other reviewers I fit all into a 9 x 13" pan.  Thanks for the recipe...I was searching for awhile for this one.

These are so fantastic, I could have eaten the whole pan myself. (I love cranberries) Served them at a Family Reunion, even the men there asked their wives to make sure they asked for the recipe.  Thank you, so much

I didn't use the nuts; I never do.  My family has enough nuts.  These bars were so good!  It surprised us all, as the cranberries were no longer too tart to eat!

I made these with a pint of lowbush cranberries (lingonberries) I canned last year. I followed the crust directions, went easy on the salt, 3/4 cup sugar (brown/white mix) and used half & half quick/old fashioned oats. After I cut in the butter, I sprinkled 1-2 teaspoons of water for good measure. In retrospect- unnecessary. 

THey came out awesome. perfect texture- not dry crunchy like some other similar recipes I've tried.

Followed the directions and used the 9 x 9 pan. I swapped the butter for the I Can't believe It's Not Butter Sticks.  I thought there was too much oat mixture for the amount of cranberry. The cranberry mixture came out way too thin. I could barely get it to fit the pan. As for taste, I could taste the salt, so I would cut back on it. (Could have been my butter choice) I suggest, if trying this recipe to increase the cranberry mixture by another 1/2 and then maybe putting the whole thing in a 9 x 13. Has potential but needs tweaking. I also had to cook mine for about 20 minutes.

Easy to make, very tasty, but WAY to sweet!  Cranberry items are supposed to be tart, but too tasty to ignore so I'll try cutting sugar in half or better, next time.

These were very good.  I used a 9x13 pan, and I added some slivered almonds to the topping.  For the filling I used 3 cups cranberries, 1 cup sugar, 1 diced apple, some apple juice, a little orange juice, and orange zest, then thickened it with cornstarch.  They were still pretty zingy, so I'm glad I added the extras.  I served it with ice cream; then took the rest for friends to sample the next day.  They were a hit.

Excellent recipe with the modifications ... Instant gratification, by the time the kitchen was cleaned up the dessert was ready. Modifications to original recipe: used 9x13 pan, 3 cups cranberries and 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 cup sugar. Broiled the top for 2 minutes until golden. Very good! - Thanks for the suggestions!

I increased the recipe by 1-1/2 to fit a 9x13 pan.  These bars turned out really sweet.  They were still good, but I would either reduce the amount of sugar cooked with the cranberries or the brown sugar in the crust.  They were really good frozen!

Sometimes simpler is better.  Great recipe to substitute anything you have, on hand, for the filling.  Used Strawberry jam, today.  Will try the cranberry filling, next time :)

This was OK when very fresh, but it was extremely sweet, very buttery, and needed to be baked longer.  I baked it for 25 minutes just because 15 seemed so short, and it still got extremely soggy within a day of baking.  I also wish I had followed my instincts and added some spices like cinnamon and maybe nutmeg.  Even though it was super-sweet, it ended up tasting kind of bland and boring.

Wow, these are awesome! I took the advice of others and usesd a 13x9 pan. Also increased the filling. I used 2 cups cranberries and 1 cup pomegranate seeds and then strained to remove the seeds. Also increased sugar to 1 cup. Took these to work and everyone loved them!

yummy. I added a cup of applesauce to the sauce. It turned out quite crumbly but still delicious. I also used a 9 x 13 pan with no changes to the recipe except the addition of the applesauce.

These are simple to make and delicious. I used frozen cranberries and added about 1 TBSP of orange juice during the cooking process. I also used my food processor to make the crumb crust/topping. I mixed the dry ingredients first, then added chunks of cold butter and pulsed until I had crumbs. My coworkers enjoyed these. I cut them into triangles for serving.

These were good.  A lot more work than I anticipated (though it would be easier if I had a zester- I just used a vegetable peeler.)  I thought they tasted very good, but I wouldn't make them again.  They weren't as addictive as most desserts.

Just made these and had to eat them warm out of the oven...yum! I didnt have any fresh oranges for the rind so put a litte orange liquor in the cranberry mixture.  Also cut down the dy ingredients by 1/3 (ie, used 1 c flour, 1 c oats etc) and it was the perfect amount.  Will try using 1/2 apples 1/2 cranberries next time.  Great way to use fresh cranberries up.

Doubled the fresh cranberries and orange zest, used 1 cup sugar and 1 tbsp water to make the sauce.
1.5x the base for a 9x13” pan but still had too much base.
Baked and cut nicely - had some zip to it (our preference).

So delicious! Per reviewer suggestions, I increased the cranberries to 3 cups and I'm glad I did as that seemed to make the right amount of sauce for my 8.5" square glass pan. I like the tartness of cranberries so didn't increase the sugar.  Like other reviewers, I had to add a few splashes of water to the cranberry/sugar mixture to get it to start breaking down. I used fresh cranberries instead of frozen so maybe that made a difference?  Instead of using all oats, I blended half into oat flour. I omitted the baking powder. Baked for about 30 minutes, with the last few minutes under the broiler to brown the top. I finished with a dusting of powdered sugar.

This was a great dessert for our Thanksgiving meal and I will definitely make these again with cranberry and will experiment with other berries as well. I used unsalted butter but still tasted a tad salty, so I'll cut back on the salt next time.

these are very good. I made the bars according to the original recipe,  baked for about 30 minutes. they came out great. I put the pan in my freezer for about an hour after baking, so they would firm up quicker. worked great.  I will double the amount of cranberries next time for more filling.  yummy!

I had to substitute the fresh cranberries (not available) for another fruit.  I followed the recipe as is with frozen blueberries. The fruit mixture was not getting thick, added a tablespoon cornstarch.  Worked out perfectly !   Couldn't stop eating them, will make for guests next time, :)

I made this pretty much according to the recipe with the addition of half a cup unsweetened applesauce. The bars collapsed in the pan and had to be spooned out. There seemed to be too much in the way of flour and rolled oats. Not what I was hoping for so I doubt I'll make them again.

I needed to use up some extra cranberries, so I thought I would give this a try.  I felt this was lacking something.  Way to much batter left over,and the middle seemed a little sticky.  But, it was good.  The flavor wasn't over whelming. A little melted white chocolate over the top, or maybe some honey would have been good.

Substituted dried cranberries...for smaller pan 9x9" I used 1-1/2 cups dried and 1/2 cup orange juice I cooked for about 15 minutes to soften berries.  Instead of orange zest I used 3/4 cup orange marmalade and no added sugar (I like tart things so you might need to add some sugar if you want a sweet filling} cooking this with berries about 5 minutes. Based on other comments for larger pan, I cut back to one cup each of oats and flour.  I like my holiday cranberry bread combination so I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and chopped pecans to the topping. Delicous! Next time I think I'll spread some white chocolate chips on top to play up the tart/sweet.

Addictive. I do agree, a 13x9 inch pan might have worked a bit better. I pretty much followed the recipe except pilfered a bit from Cook's Illustrated and before making topping, cut in about 1.5 tbs butter and a couple more brown sugar. I thought the amount of filling and the tartness were perfection.

I used another reviewer's suggestion and added unsweetened applesauce to stretch the fillling and cut the tartness, then made it in a 13x9 pan, these worked pretty well and the foil made them easy to get out of the pan.  I do think something to cut the tartness is necessary because even with what I did they were almost too tart.
