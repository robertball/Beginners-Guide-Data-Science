Great recipe! It was the hit of our outdoor COVID compliant socially distanced summer birthday BBQ. I used an 8 oz. block of feta cheese (crumbled) and kalamata olives. Delish!

Great Salad! Might try Fontina cheese instead of the Asiago.

This was delicious!  Used a little less vinegar (1/3c vs 1/2) and same with olive oil.  Amazing!

This is a super summer salad, fresh and delish. 
I would though reduce the amount of red wine vinegar by a little as it was too vinegar-y for us (a little baking soda helped as a quick fix to cut that though - I Googled it). And I did add more cheese (fyi, I didn't have asiago so I used feta - which I associate more with Greek food myself). You can never have too much cheese right?   
Tomberry tomatoes (the cute little itty bitty tomatoes - whole, not cut) I had on hand was also a fab substitution - didn't have cherry or grape). Substitutions are fun - welcome to C-19 cooking!  
Definitely will make this again though. A big hit.

Made it for lunches  for the work week.  Covered & refrigerated it over night.  Great recipe to use up the abundance of cherry tomatoes  & cucumbers.
