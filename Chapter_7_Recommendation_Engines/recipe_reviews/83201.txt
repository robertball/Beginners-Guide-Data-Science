This is a great soup. 

I always kvetch about people who make so many changes to a submitted recipe that it is no longer recognizeable.

So I am sad to admit that I made the following substitutions:

I didn't have ground beef so I used 2 1/2 links of leftover italian sausage. I was out of peas so I used a can on garbanzo beans instead. I can't bring myself to use canned spinach so I used 1 box of frozen. I forgot about the pasta until it was too late. So I left it out. 

Honestly I can't see myself using ground beef and regular peas the next time I make this becasue I was so pleased with the results I got tonight.

This recipe was a hit for my whole family.  It had great flavor.  I used a can of beef broth instead of the cubes and cut down on the water.  Will definately make it again

This is really good.  I didn't have the 15 oz. can of tomatoe sauce, only an 8 oz. so i added half a small can of italian diced tomatoes and like 2 teaspoons of tomatoe paste to sub.  It turned out great.  When I added the macaroni though I did have to add like 2 1/2 cups of water b/c there wasn't enough juice for the mac. to cook.  I was worried it would taste to watered down b/c of the water...BUT IT DIDN'T!!!  Lots of flavor...wonderful!!

This was very good.  The only change I made was to use orzo instead of macaroni.  I will be making this again.

I didn't change a thing, and this entire thing was eaten by five adults.  It was fantastic with a nice spice to it from the pepper.  So good on a cold fall day!

This was great!  I used a box of frozen spinach and some frozen peas instead of canned for better flavor.  Also used penne pasta because it was what I had on hand.  It was wonderful and I can't wait to make it again.

This was wonderful!!  I had to make a couple of substitutions---I used potato that I had pre-cooked in the micro (because I didn't have time for macaroni to cook) and I didn't add the beef boullion because I didn't have any.  Still delicious and a wonderful change from the sauce, chili, taco, etc...that I normally use ground beef for.  Thank you!!!

My family loved this.  I used diced italian tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  Also used one can of beef broth instead of the boullion.  I didn't measure the maccaroni, think I got too much.  It was not like a soup, more like a goulash, but everyone loved it.

I substituted fresh veggies for canned and added another can of tomato sauce. I also added fresh chopped basil. It cooked up as a hearty stew - very good flavors all mixed together and brought out by the Italian seasoning base.

Just made this today.  Very hearty and tasty.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of each serving.  I bet it will taste even better tomorrow.

I liked this recipe a lot. I made it exactly as written, except that my cans of tomatoes were a little bigger (by .5 oz.) and the spinach was likewise smaller. Also, it didn't say so, but I opted to drain the can of small sweet peas I used. I didn't add more water or tomato sauce, as suggested, and I slightly regretted that. Not that it didn't taste great, but the results came out fairly thick (a "stewp", as a friend of mine suggested I call it). If I make this again, I'll definitely add more liquid. But it was a very flavorful, veggie-rich dish, and I highly recommend it.

i made this even easier by using my crock pot. i used italian sausage instead of ground beef and a can of white beans instead of peas. i sauteed the sausage and veggies then dumped everything in the crock pot on high for about 5 hrs. then  i added alphabet pasta and cooked for 30 more mins. turned out pretty good. i think rinsing the spinach will help decrease the canned taste. i will try that next time i use it. *Update* I made this again but rinsed the canned spinach. It improved the flavor. Glad I have found a use for canned spinach since it is so reasonable.

I really enjoyed making this. I was looking for something for a loved one with a cold, but didn't want regular soup. To keep it from drying out, I used two cans of beef broth instead of the bouillon cube and two cans of tomato sauce. Really great stuff.

Allison looooooved it. It was okay. Maybe next time use Italian sausage and ground beef together.
