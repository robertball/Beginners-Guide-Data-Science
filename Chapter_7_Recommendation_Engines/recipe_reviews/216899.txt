I made these as is with the exception that I used poblano peppers instead of bell. Why? Well hubby does not care for bells and well poblanas just seemed right. I roasted them in the oven beforehand, let them cool, and removed most of their skin and they were mmm mmm good. I think I will add black beans or corn the next time I make them and also sub the colby jack ( I used a colby blend this go around because that is all my store carried) for cheddar or mexiblend. As written I give these a 4 but with the sub of poblanos I give it a 5 all the way. Thanks for sharing Jasgirl!

I have always made this with Poblano peppers - a mild Mexican pepper and have never added tomato sauce. Instead I place a good-sized slice of sharp cheddar into the pepper first; add the taco meat mixed with some cooked rice; more cheese on top and bake for 20 minutes. It's much more Mexican.

sounds delish, I will have to try out the meat mixture next time I make stuffed peppers.  I've found a way to make awesome stuffed peppers is to core the peppers, stuff them and then put them in the crock pot UPSIDE DOWN.  Add two cans of canned, diced tomates (fire roasted are the best), two cans of water and cook on high for about four or five hours.  This cooks the filling nicely as well as softens the peppers.  House smells great and the fam is very happy!

FABULOUS!! I also pre-steamed the peppers in the microwave.  I put four halves in a covered dish with a tablespoon of water for 2 1/2 minutes.  All ingredients I used as per the recipe except for omitting the salt since I think the taco seasoning has plenty of salt.  I cooked the ground beef separately since we have a vegetarian and mixed the beef with the other ingredients together after filling her peppers.  I put the raw rice and the proper amount of water along with all of the other ingredients in one pot and simmered them all together.  The rice absorbed all of the other flavors beautifully.  I spooned tomato sauce on top of each pepper then topped with taco style cheese.  What a hit!!  I'm sure they'll be asking for this all the time!  P.S. the peppers were from the garden!  May try banana peppers or jalepenos next time!

Loved this recipe!  My husband doesn't like rice, so I used black beans instead and it was delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe - I've already passed it along to my friends.

This was an amazing recipe - that taste was PERFECT.  The only change I made was to cook the peppers for 20 mins rather than steaming then before filling them.  Will be making this one many more times!

Made this another time and only let the meat mixture simmer for 10 mins - it still came out delish!   (yes I was impatient and hungry!)

Great recipe and a welcome change from the norm. The only things that I modified are that I used 4 peppers, 1 green, 1 red, 1 orange and 1 yellow. I only used one can of tomato sauce in the meat and instead of topping with the other I topped with Rotel Original version. I will use a bit less water next time since the meat mixture turned out a bit soupy...good, but soupy. I put the peppers in the slow cooker and put on low for 4 hours. I have a picky family and they loved these. Oh yeah, I put three hunks of colby/jack in the top of each pepper the last hour. Excellent!

If you have the time, try making in a slow cooker. No need to steam them. Melted in my mouth!
Delicious!

try this with shredded cooked chicken instead of the ground beef and salsa instead of the tomato sauce...you can omit the water and step 1.  In a large bowl, mix the chicken, rice (increase to 1 cup), taco seasoning, 1 cup salsa, 1 cup mexican cheese blend, salt, pepper, & garlic powder; omit chili powder and use a can of green chilis, drained, instead.  Stuff softened pepper halves, top with additional salsa and bake.  You can add more cheese on top the last few minutes of baking.  And if your family doesn't like peppers, the filling can be baked as a casserole in a lightly greased baking dish instead and served with crushed tortilla chips.  Delicious!

I made these tonight.  My neighbor happened to be here when they came out of the oven and we both loved them!  I did, of course, doctor them up a bit.  I decided to use Mexican rice instead of plain rice.  And instead of tomato sauce, I used 2 cans of Mexican style stewed tomatoes.  I added a little dried cilantro, some cumin, some oregano, and some ground coriander.  I also tossed in a small can of diced Ortega chiles.  Basically, I threw in anything "Mexican" I had in the pantry.  VERY tasty.  Can't wait until tomorrow for the leftovers.  (And this filled 5 whole peppers... 1/2 cup of rice just isn't enough.  I used about 1-1/2 to 2 cups of Mexican rice.)

These were good.  I used 8 ounces of ground beef and one cup of rice.  Also added some chili verde salsa.  The mixture filled four large pepper halves - I used red bells.  I softened the peppers in the microwave in a covered pyrex dish for four minutes and they were perfect.

A straightforward and simple recipe.  All enjoyed, although the Mexican spices tasted more like Tex-Mex rather than real Mexican.  Finally, the dish definitely needed much more heat for our taste, in order to consider them Mexican.  It was still a well-rounded meal for a weeknight. Thank You

These were really good.  I cooked them in the crockpot and they turned out perfectly with way less work.  To cut down on the grease, I used 90/10 ground beef, mixed it uncooked with 1/2 c. brown rice (also uncooked) and all of the other ingredients, stuffed the peppers, put them in two layers in the crockpot, then poured the tomato sauce over the top. Cooked on low all day and they were perfect. This is definitely how I'll do stuffed peppers from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

VERY YUMMY!!!! I made many changes though ....just because I end up deciding at the last minute to make a recipe and so I don't always have the ingredients. I used chicken instead of ground beef. I used fajita seasoning instead of taco. I used salsa instead of tomato sauce. I used grated med. cheddar instead of Colby-Jack. And...I added Frank's Red Hot sauce. It was GREAT!!!! Also, I broiled the peppers insted of steaming them. I don't like my peppers too mushy. The only change for next time would be to add a little more spice because we like spicy food.

These were absolutely fabulous!!!  Stuffed peppers are my favorite thing to order at a mexican restaurant, and this recipe was my first attempt at making them at home.....so glad I did!!!  I followed the recipe exactly---except that I had to use green peppers because my grocery store was out of red.  They turned out perfect!

These were great and easy peppers.  I used yellow peppers as those were the cheapest ones.  Used more than 2 teaspoons of chili powder as we like it spicy.  As others stated in reviews I also softened the peppers in the microwave.  And maybe used about twice the amount of cheese.  The boyfriend asked if he was to eat the stuff out of the pepper, I had to tell him you eat the pepper as well.  He is not a veggie fan but raved about these and had seconds.

These stuffed peppers were AWESOME!!!  I am a bartender and I cook for my customers every day.  I was kind of nervous about serving these but they were a big hit!  I didn't change a thing except that I made enough for 30 people.  The recipe is perfect; I will definitely be making this again!  YUM-YUM!!!!!!!!!

These were great!  Even our 9 yr-old daughter, who was initially afraid to try them, ended up asking for seconds.  The only significant changes we made were to increase the rice to 3/4 cup and we added about 1/2 cup of black beans to the mix.  Yummy!

This is a fantastic base recipe! I used poblanos because my hubby doesn't like bells, swapped the rice for black beans and added corn. It was great! Next time I'm adding quinoa or lentils cause it was a little on the soupy side. It's definitely going on our weeknight rotation! I even sent it to my mother and brother in law.

A keeper for sure. I used lean ground turkey instead of ground beef & substituted rice with 1/2 can of black beans.  I also softened the bell peppers in the microwave. Easy to assemble ahead of time is a plus.

I've made this several times, and the only thing different I do is add finely chopped fresh mushrooms, to reduce the calories, but not the volume. My husband loves this and I have to keep him out of the pot to make sure the peppers get stuffed! We love it, thanks! Great dish!

LOVED them. Only added some Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning, sea salt, and I also added more Monterrey Jack cheese to the tops and sprinkled a little cilantro on top. Fabulous!!!!

This was awesome.  I steamed the peppers over the  water the rice was boiling while I cooked up the meat, meaning I steamed them a little longer than 3-5 minutes.  Also, I did not have any Colby Jack cheese, so I substituted real Mexican Cheese- either queso blanco or queso fresco.  I forgot to pour the second can of tomato sauce over the peppers and didn't cover the baking dish with foil- didn't thoroughly read the directions! Used yellow and orange peppers instead of red.  They looked beautiful and the flavor of the meat mixture is very complimentary to that of the peppers.  Hubby raved- said they were better than the ones his mom used to make and believe me that is saying something.

I'm sorry to rate this so low but these just weren't for us.  There was too much meat, it was overpowering and just tasted like we were eating spoons of taco filling.  I think it is a good idea, but maybe add more rice or even some black beans and cut the meat in 1/2.  Thanks anyway.

I doubled the recipe and made these in the crockpot. No need to steam the peppers first. I also used the Taco seasoning 1 recipe (doubled) from this site and didn't need to add any extra seasonings or chili powder (my chili powder is very hot though)!
I used 1 28oz can of crushed tomato instead of tomato sauce and chedder cheese as that's what I had in.
Cook on high for about 3- 4 hrs or longer on low temp.

I was in the grocery and found poblano peppers "reduced for quick sale."  I followed this recipe as written, but added some chopped onions and (obviously) used the poblanos instead of bell peppers.  I purposely left some of the seeds in the poblanos after broiling them and removing the skins, and then stuffed them per the recipe.  I also slathered these with Mexican style cheese when they were almost finished baking. These were a hit with me, my mom and husband!  I know my son will gobble the rest of them up when he gets home tonight.   Thanks for a great recipe!!  :-)

Good. Maybe next time I'll try turkey or tofu and a different brand of taco seasonings. I really like the recipe and cutting the pepper sideways, duh, so much easier!

This recipe is fantastic...........it will now be a regular in my house.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but did add more rice and a can of black beans and cilantro.  I also sprinkled Mexican blend cheese on top the last 5 minutes of baking.  DELICIOUS!!  Thank you for the recipe!

I guess I don't get it.  It just tasted like a taco in a chili rather than a tortilla. I followed the recipe exactly, if I were to make this again I would double the rice since the rice to meat ratio was too low in our opinion.  In fact, I'm going to reuse our leftovers- including the chilis once chopped- as taco filling tomorrow. But I think I'll keep looking.

These were awesome! I used a can of Rotel like some suggested, and sprinkled with shredded instead of cubed cheese.  I also put them in a crockpot - so the peppers softened.  We had very small peppers from our garden. We sliced the stuffed peppers and ate them on a flour tortilla with some sour cream.  They were terrific.

When I first saw this recipe, I thought it had the basis to be a real winner. So I changed it by using poblano pepper, hot taco seasoning, added chopped green pepper and red onion and s serrano pepper (I like it a bit spicy). Next time I would add 2 serranos or one habanero. One pepper per person is enough and I had left overs so it became the filling for tacos the next night. Good flavours and great presentation.

I love this recipe!  I made this tonight for myself and it is amazing.  I used ground turkey and brown rice to be a little healthier and you really can't tell at all because the stuffing is so flavorful.  This is a great recipe for dinner parties.  It also keeps for awhile, so you can eat it throughout the week.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This was ok.  I stuffed tomatoes instead of green peppers. I didn't pre-steam them, I forgot to add the tomato sauce at the end and I topped w/ shredded cheddar.

These are excellent!  I used extra lean ground beef and sliced reduced fat cheese instead (because that's what I happen to have on hand) to make it a bit healthier and they were still very good.  I also only had a 1/2lb. of the ground beef so I doubled the rice, and only used 1/2 of taco seasoning packet.  I took another reviewer's advice and broiled my peppers about 2mins each side, gave them a nice flavor.

I've never made stuffed peppers or even eaten them before and these are amazing!! Very easy and quick.  My boyfriend loved the meat mixture so much he wants me to use it to top pasta....and anything else!! I used half red and half green peppers.

I love these... but this is not really a new recipe. I remember eating these when I was a small kid and I'm now 40. This was once a really popular dish in California... Although I've had it with all sorts of variations in the cheese... and some make it with salsa. It is a really tasty meal though. I was actually looking for a recipe that uses mini bell peppers... I was hoping to read reviews as to wether it was good... Guess I'll just have to take that venture on my own! Thanks for posting a recipe that took me down my own memory lane!

These peppers were great but I made a lot of changes. I used green peppers because that's what I had. I didn't have the packaged taco seasoning so I substituted with Taco Seasoning II recipe on this site. I left out the rest of the seasoning (chili powder, salt, garlic salt and pepper) because they were already present in the seasoning recipe. I thought I might add additional seasoning after tasting but it wasn't necessary. I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce by mistake so I added 1 cup of rice to compensate and didn't top the peppers with sauce, just the cheese. I didn't make the recipe as written because I didn't have the packaged mix but I'm glad I made it this way and reduced the salt.

I thought these were really tasty. I did exactly as the recipe said except I cored the peppers and then broiled them for a couple minutes before stuffing them and baking them. I cooked the rice in beef stock instead of water for added flavour. We ate these with garlic bread - YUM. Having a leftover one for lunch right now (they reheat well in the microwave).

These were awesome!!! Simple, delicious and so tasty. I added some onions and hot sauce for personal taste preferences and steamed my bell peppers in the microwave before using so that they were softer and easier to cut through when done baking.

Wow.  Great recipe.  Very filling.  Picture perfect results if you follow the recipe exactly.  We had a lot of left over meat mixture.  Ate it with chips while the peppers were baking.

This was quick and easy. I used salsa instead of tomato sauce, hot & spicy taco seasoning, and added a little bit more rice. I used 3 large yellow and orange peppers and had filling leftover, which I froze to make a bigger batch next time. Delicious,  thanks  for sharing!!

This recipe was really delicious! I used green peppers, double the rice and half tomato sauce and was very good! I will definitely be making this again!

This was great! I made these as an easy lunch to bring to work. I added 1 cup black beans, 2 jalepenos (canned), and some black olives in there as well. I also seasoned the 2nd tomato sauce before putting on top. Everything else was as-is. 

Loses one star because the cheese doesn't melt very well using the technique described in this recipe. It either dripped off the side of the pepper or didn't distribute at all, leaving a large glob of cheese in the middle. I'll probably shred the cheese next time.

I steamed the pepper halves in the microwave with a tablespoon of water for 2.5 mins.  I prefer the peppers to not be too mushy but more slightly softened. Boy did the kitchen smell good with: ground beef browning with taco seasoning, garlic, chili powder, salt, and some cayenne! Added the rice in the mixture with tomato sauce and spooned into the pepper halves.  Topped with cheddar cheese and baked.  It was easy to adapt into a vegetarian serving also - so a real win/win for me and a solid 30 min dinner.

Delicious! I tripled the rice, and didn't split the tomato sauce mixture. It was an accident, but I'm glad I put it all together. I'm not a fan of tomato sauce by itself. I tried red, orange, yellow and green peppers for this. I haven't had my leftover red peppers yet, but the orange and yellow peppers were great with this! Tastes even better the next day. I microwaved my leftovers a little, then put them in my toaster oven for ~15 mins. The peppers were nice and soft. This dish is really good with tobacco sauce on top. Thanks for the recipe!

I love Allrecipes! I changed it to chorizo which is the Mexican sausage instead of plain old ground beef.  I also spiced it up by using poblano peppers (use gloves when cleaning out the seeds) as some of the others suggested.  Serve with scallions and a little cheese on top and sour cream/salsa on the side.  You can also change it to brown rice or quinoa which I did.

This was a big hit with my husband.  I made a few peppers as the recipe stated and I made a few using changes suggested by other reviewers.  Although the original recipe was good as is, we preferred the peppers with the adjustments made.  The adjustments on the second batch were to use poblano peppers, ground turkey, & instead of putting a cube of cheese in the middle - I just uncovered the last 5 minutes of baking and added cheese to the top.   I also didn't pour any additional tomato sauce on the second batch I made.   Either way you go - I think you will like this recipe.

I was out of taco seasoning so I used ground cumino, extra garlic powder, chili powder, and 1/2 chipped onion, mixed into the ground sirloin. These are fabulous! I didn't have to pre-steam or blanch the peppers and they came out marvelous, full of flavor! My boyfriend raved about them and wouldn't let me share with friends, saying to "stop giving MY left-overs away".

A tastier variation on the usual stuffed pepper! I make them with ground turkey to up the nutritional value, mix in a can of niblet corn into the filling, and top them off with grated cheese. Lastly, I never pre-cook the peppers, otherwise they're too mushy! I stuff them raw and cover to bake. Gives the perfect textured pepper!

I made these with red bell peppers that I steamed in the microwave for a few minutes.  I added chopped cilantro to the meat mixture, while cooking, and used a can of Rotel since I failed to buy tomato sauce.  Topped with shredded cheddar and baked until bubbly and brown on the top. These had lots of flavor. These arent my favorite dish in all the world but a great, and somewhat healthy, midweek meal.  We will be making them again.

Delicious! I just used 2 full bell peppers for my boyfriend and I and hollowed them out for a full pepper each. I used brown rice and some hot sauce since I didn't have chili powder. They were rich and especially good with tortilla chips. My boyfriend and I both loved these -- definitely recommend!

This was very easy to prep. I added sauteed garlic, onion, and green pepper to the meat mixture. I also cooked some thick cut bacon and broke it up on the top of the stuffed pepper before I placed it in the oven. Great for a football Sunday. BANGIN!

i gave this recipe 5 stars based on little modifications that i made. first, i listened to other reviewers and cooked the rice with the meat in chicken broth. instead of hamburger i used 97 lean turkey and it was very good. way healthier. my family likes spicy food, so i added some canned jalapenos and jalapeno juice to the mixture, simmered it all for 25 minutes and it came out perfect. used red peppers and since i like them crunchy, didnt do anything to them except clean and cut lengthwise. very easy to make and makes a lot of leftovers,which i am gonna have tomorrow with sour cream tomatoes and soft tortillas. 
very pleased, thank you for a recipe!!!!!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers.  I really didn't care for that much green pepper.  (Store has 0 red ones)  However, the filling on these is really good and would make tasty tacos or burritos.  I'll use the filling again.  Everyone liked the filling, just not the peppers.

Really loved this. Might try shredded cheese mixed in, instead off the chunk which doesn't disperse next time. I used the Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning recipe and I think that's salty enough - this doesn't need the extra salt, ours was quite salty (esp with the loaded sodium in the tomato soup).

Very tasty and easy to make! I did not steam the peppers (I like them crunchy) and also cut the simmering time down to 10 min. Also used chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, as I had an open tin that had to be used up. Will definitely make again!

I wanted to use the rest of the green peppers from my garden and this seemed like a good recipe for this.  My peppers were on the medium size so I used 4 of them and much to my suprise the filling quantity turned out to the perfect amount. I followed the recipe exactly except for the size of the peppers.  Will make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of sauce cos' I didn't have any and it was great.  Also used medium cheddar and that was great too.  I treated them almost like a taco and had salsa, sour cream and salad on the side.  Yumm.

Seriously good and a nice change from our usual vegetable based meals. Very pleased that I halved the amount of Chilli I used though....maybe American Chilli is not quite as hot as what we use "down here" but 2tsp would have blown our heads off!!
I did double the amount of rice used too ... meant that I had sufficient filling left over for another crack at this yummy dish!
Thank you Jasgirl.

We will make this again! With this recipe I was able, for the first time ever, to make stuffed peppers that were not watery! Loads of flavor! Way too much salt though for our taste. I sauted a small diced carrot and a quarter of an onion diced and added to the beef. I also used sharp cheddar cheese because that is what I had and it was wonderful. This one is a keeper!

This was great !   Even if you don't like peppers, you'll enjoy this meal, eat the filling or add it to tortillas.  Very flavorful.   I doubled the recipe but shorted myself on tomato sauce.  Added salsa and a little water, was great.  Only one pepper left that was gone later that night.

I thought there wasn't going to be enough rice when I read the recipe but I stuck to it and it was the perfect blend of rice and hamburger.  Easy to make and there were no leftovers

Excellent recipe.  Only change I made was to replace the tomato sauce with diced tomatos with green chiles, I did not pour tomato sauce over the peppers.  Came out great!

I just made this recipe for supper, and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!  I've never been a big fan of stuffed peppers in the past, but these I LOVE!  My husband is a picky eater, very hard to please, but he loved this recipe too!  This recipe is definitely a keeper, no changes necessary.  I will definitely be making this again, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

These were absolutely delicious!  I followed someone else’s lead and used 4 peppers and only 1 can of tomato sauce for the filling.  Then I used the Original Rotel tomatoes for the top.  This is on my forever list!

Made this tonight for dinner and loved it. I just baked in the oven and skipped the steamer, who needs that in their lives when you have to get dinner done. Used Mexican cheese and omitted salt, pepper and chili powder and used no salt tomato sauce (I have a sodium restriction) I’ll make this again.

This recipe was amazing. A little leg work up front but worth it 100%. I made a double batch of the meat/rice mixture to save in the freezer for another time. This recipe is so adjustable too for any family's preferences. My husband raved about this recipe when I first served it - it has been added to our regular rotation ever since!

Everyone I serve this to loves it. If I run short on time, or forget, I won't steam the peppers, just leave them in the oven longer, or don't, it doesnt matter. Also I usually dice the top and bottom of the peppers and throw that in with the mix. Definitely a go-to!!

I made this exactly as written other than using ground turkey instead. This was absolutely yummy.  After they came out of the oven I sprinkled with a little extra shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. This is a keeper for sure.

Very good!  I didn’t have Colby-jack so I mixed grated cheddar into my meat mixture before stuffing. I might try pouting enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce next time for more of a Mexican flavor. However, it was excellent as is!

Excellent. I tried it with bell peppers and poblanos. I did like the flavor of the poblanos but I thought the bell peppers presented better. All the poblanos I could find were very long and flat. They were a little hotter in general than I would have preferred. May have to play with the chili powder and taco seasoning. I used Trader Joes Taco seasoning. Maybe another brand? All in all it was a hit at my party and would make it again.

This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers, and they turned out excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I make them, I'd like to try topping them with salsa and taco sauce rather than tomato sauce. The tomato sauce on top was fine, but I think salsa would complement the taco-flavored filling better. I also plan to double the rice next time, because there was very little in this recipe and I think it could have used more.

These were very tasty; my husband ate four of them so next time I will have to double the recipe. The only thing that I will do different next time is to use shredded Colby or Monterrey Jack cheese. The cheese cube just sort of sat there like a cheese gob. These are a great alternative for boring Taco Tuesday.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I might replace the rice with chopped zuchinni to remove the starch. Added a little onion and 2 cloves of garlic. I used 1 can of tomatoe sauce instead of 2, makes for a thicker sauce. Steamed  the peppers for 5 min. before adding sauce and then put in oven for 35 min. Great Recipe

My family doesn't enjoy super spicy food so I didn't add the chili pepper. I added an extra half cup of rice. Over all I think this was a great twist on stuff peppers will make this again in the future.

Amazballs!!!! loved this recipe, as we are from the UK we tweaked slightly by using a tin of chopped toms and it was great, I am not a lover of peppers so I made my wife peppers and I stuffed my tacos with the mixture. we loved it so much that the following evening we heated some nachos added the remaining mixture and topped them with melted cheese BEAUTIFUL!!!

These were super easy and delicious! The only things we changed was using our steamer for the peppers, less chili powder because I don't like a lot of spice, and we didn't use the whole 2nd can of tomato sauce. We will definitely make these again.

Love it!! The last time I made this, I didn't have any taco mix on hand, so I used a little more salt and chili powder. And I prefer to use fresh garlic over garlic salt. Definitely a favorite dish here!

I made these cause my husband loves mex food..but I used ground turkey and mozzarella to lessen fat.  Not a bad recipe.  For those w/o a steamer..put a Pyrex w water in stove w peppers in separate pan.

Thanks!!

This recipe was great. I used ground turkey and brown rice. I also added in some mexicorn and black beans for a Tx-Mex feel. I was out of tomato sauce so I used canned tomatoes and some salsa.

This was AMAZING.  I followed the recipe as written, except I put the peppers in the microwave instead of steaming and they turned out perfect and the texture was just right. There was a lot of extra meat sauce that we enjoyed later with tortilla chips. But you could easily freeze this and use again, the possibilities are endless.  Very tasty all on it's own. I will definitely be making this for my next dinner party.

This recipe is a keeper!  You can use whatever kind of cheese you want--we had chunk cheddar cheese and cut it into cubes.  I made the recipe as is, except  I did saute 1 small onion and 2 cloves garlic (minced), and then added the ground beef to cook.

Great recipe!  Easy to prepare and tastes good.  I usually do make extra of the meat mixture to freeze for quick preparation for another dinner later.

AMAZING, i only rated 3 instead of 5 because i made alot of changes based on others reviews, i did NOT steam the peppers because i prefer them crunchy, and im glad i didnt because they were slightly mushy slightly crunchy placing them in the pan raw and then baking them for 30 min, i also added corn and black beans to the mix and that was GREAT! i also used salsa instead of tomato sauce! also a great addition because it added chunks of tomatoes to the base! i also used a fresh red chili pepper from my garden instead of chili powder...i only had yellow and green peppers on hand and i preferred the yellow or use a more mild pepper like the red it call for, the green was just a little over powering (but im just not a fan of green peppers, my husband loved the green pepp), also i used some rice a roni mexican rice i had on hand and could bearly taste it in the mix i even added more than called for, will be trying other flavors and more than doubling the rice....the "stuffing mix" makes a ton so be prepared for extra, but as good as they were i will prob portion it up and freeze it for future peppers or taco filling!!

I really liked this recipe!!! Glad I tried it. It was a little too spicy for my boyfriend (he has chronic heartburn) so I cut the chili powder in half. Great in burritos too!

These were pretty good! I added more cheese to these peppers and used low sodium taco seasoning. I wish I had steamed the peppers for longer; they were not as soft as I would have liked, but overall I was happy.

This was my first attempt at making stuffed peppers & I thought they were quite simple and very tasty! I basically followed the recipe with the exception of using shredded cheese instead of the cube - I mixed it in w/the filling & added a bit on top for good measure :-) I also used 1&1/2 lbs beef as we have home grown beef that came pkgd that way, am looking forward to the extra filling in burritos :-)

Made this for my family and everyone loved it (even the picky eaters)! Followed the directions except cut back on the water, and added some corn, onions, salsa. & shredded Mexican cheeses on top.  Was a delicious, quick and easy recipe that I will be making again soon!

I made this using the Taco Seasoning II recipe I found on here, per someone else's suggestion, and I used Goya Mexican rice, and it was GREAT!  I also made half vegetarian, for my oldest daughter.  We all loved this, I would definitely make it again!  Thank you!

Thank you for posting.  My family really liked this dish! 

I would have rated 5 stars if the cheese was more mixed in with the meat rather than a nugget of cheese.

Very good.  Being Texan, it rang true for good mexican flavor, and am using the leftover meat in tortillas tomorrow for lunch.  5 stars beccause it's a dual recipe.  Filling for peppers (any kind) and tortillas for an enchilada dish.  I prefer a little spicier chili punch, so next time going to half and half the tomato sauce with picante sauce...just because, but will make again.   Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious!   I used red peppers but have also used pablano peppers to stuff.  The meat mixture, followed recipe except for using chunky picante sauce in place of tomato sauce.   Also had a little green chile verde sauce in the fridge and added that as well.   I used small chunks of pepper jack cheese to each pepper, topped with a little more picante sauce and finally some shredded sharp cheddar.  Baked for 35 minutes .  Topped with a avocado, thinly sliced jalapeño and a little sour cream.   Yum!

I also changed some things.  I substituted Macayo's enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and added shoepeg corn.  I did not add the salt as I thought the taco seasoning had enough.  But, that is personal taste.  I added the enchilada sauce and shredded monterey jack cheese the meat, then added some shredded jack cheese and sauce to the tops while baking.  I did not used any cubes of cheese!  We both enjoyed the change from regular stuffed peppers.

I made this last night with a few changes. I used ground turkey instead of beef and substituted the tomato sauce for a can of Las Palmas Green Enchilada Sauce..almost the whole 28oz and mixed shredded  cheese in the turkey mixture and on top....It was delicious. One note is to make sure you soften the red bell peppers really good before stuffing..

Don't change a thing, it's fabulous!  Everyone loves it.  I have used both green peppers and red peppers and the red are better I think.  This gets rave reviews and is super easy to put together.  If I want to "stretch" it - I sometimes add a little more rice than called for and I usually use brown rice. The peppers are quite filling!  Thanks for the tasty recipe!  This is a "regular" dish at my house now!

Delicious. My son says these are a lot like chile rellenos. I made it without the chili powder or ground black pepper, and it was plenty spicy enough.

I used home grown tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and knor spanish rice. The peppers came from my garden. Delicious!

Ok.  I haven't tasted this recipe yet but this is definitely not authentic.  The authentic Chiles Rellenos are way different.  Taco seasoning just sit well with me I guess.  I gonna try making these cause they do look good either way.  Thanks for sharing.

I used a homemade taco seasoning in this recipe and it turned out like I expected with amendments to the taco seasoning as specified in the recipe. The only issue I had was with the bell pepper skins.  I may try roasting and skinning the peppers next time.
Thanks for the recipe!

This is a HUGE hit with my family! I personally don't like peppers so I doubled the recipe and what didn't get stuffed in the peppers I wrapped in a tortilla! I cooked the rice in my rice cooker and that seems to work perfectly!

Great recipe!  To prepare for my vegetarian daughter's family I substituted a can of black beans for the ground beef and used brown rice for additional fiber.  I also used a good salsa instead of tomato sauce, and grated cheese on top.  The hallmark of a great recipe, in my opinion, is one that can be modified to suit other occasions with good success.

I made these last night and they were delicious! I did a few things differently though: Instead of using a steamer to soften the peppers, I used the microwave. I put the halved peppers in a large bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, cut a few slits in the top and microwaved them for about 3 minutes. I followed the spices and seasonings exactly as the recipe calls for but I used hot/spicy taco seasoning instead of regular seasoning. If you do this, I recommend using a bit less chili powder. The meat mixture was still delicious, but the chili flavor was a bit TOO much (and I love chili flavoring!). Also, I found that this recipe can do with or without the cheese cubes. The cheese stuffed into the middle doesn't do any more for the recipe than the obvious (a glob of cheese in the middle). Instead, you could sprinkle shredded cheese on top of the peppers for the last 5-10 minutes baking time.

These were decent and if you like stuffed peppers they're just another variety of that. I was hoping they would be different enough for my husband to be Ok with them as he doesn't prefer stuffed peppers but they were not. Won't be making again but only because of personal preferences - would encourage others to try though.

Not crazy about this one.  The filling was too salty even though I used low salt seasoning and the lack of rice just made it seasoned meat in a pepper.  Might make again with adjustments.

We enjoyed them so much more that traditional stuffed peppers. Both my husband and myself loved the Mexican flavor and the buried cheese cube and will definitely make them again. Six peppers made two meals which is perfect for an additional night with just reheating.  I also used only half an envelope of Taco Seasoning, which was perfect for our taste.

Used plobano peppers, fresh garlic and enchilada sauce iso the tomato sauce. Everything else the same. I was pretty unimpressed by the results. Tasted very processed with the taco mix. I am quite surprised at the number of rave reviews. Don't think I will be making this again. But thank you for the submission and the effort was pretty minimal if you need to get dinner on the table in a hurry.

These are wonderful. I did make a few modifications, I added about 1/4 cup of salsa to the mix for an added kick and instead of the cube cheese I added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the mixture prior to filling the peppers.

I made this using chorizo instead of hamburger.  I also used 2 cups of cooked rice & added a can of roasted green chilies.  I also mixed in shredded Mexican cheese into the meat & rice mixture, then stuffed the peppers.  I really like this recipe.

I adapted this recipe and cooked it in the Crock-Pot for 4 hours. I used a liner for the Crock-Pot, and added a 15-ounce can of tomato sauce and a 15-ounce can of bruschetta tomatoes to the Crock-Pot.  For the meat mixture, in addition to the ingredients listed, I  added a Vidalia onion, 1 can of niblet corn,  5 mini red, yellow and orange peppers, an egg, a sprinkle of breadcrumbs and substituted milk (for the water) to make my mixture. (Instead of sprinkling the dry taco seasoning into the meat, I blended the taco seasoning with the milk.  Yes, it didn't all completely dissolve in the milk, but when it was mixed into the other ingredients, it blended perfectly.)  I then stuffed the mixture into 3 green bell peppers.  Extra meat mixture was rolled into mini meatballs and added to the sauce. I cooked this for 4 hours and added one can of DRAINED black beans during the last hour of cooking.  This turned out phenomenal, incredible flavor and texture and clean-up was so easy.  For this meal, I did not need any other sides because of the rice, beans, peppers, corn and tomatoes.

Turned out great! I added more rice to feel up more peppers for my recipe. Shredded Colby jack cheese worked fine and I put cilantro on top. Would be ever better with fresh cilantro. I also used garlic powder instead on garlic salt. My husband and I loved it!

Very flavourful. I found them a bit too spicy so next time, not as much Chili powder. I cut the bottoms to sit flat and added the cheese first, but, of course, my cheese melted out the bottom of the peppers-DOH!

Best stuffed peppers I’ve have so far. However, I did make a few adjustments for my family’s taste... (adjustments)-Add ground Italian sausage, onions & garlic to beef. Season beef/sausage mixture (add rosemary/oregano/sazon/adobo). Add Rotel diced tomatoes w/chiles. Add some cheese cubes to meat mix while simmering (stir when melted). Serve with green salad and fresh garlic Tuscan bread. YUMMY

I made some substitutions. I used salsa as a base in the pan and used diced tomatoes in with the meat mixture. To add a creamy note I used cream cheese and sour cream in with the meat mixture inside the pepper. And I topped all with shredded cheese.

I haven't made stuffed peppers in ages and I found this recipe.  It's really tasty.  I only used one can of tomato soup.  And I didn't have taco seasoning so I winged it.  I will be making this again.  I used green, red, and yellow peppers.  I like that you cut these in half rather than remove the tops.  So happy to have found this recipe.

I made it with Turkey meat and I made my own taco seasoning  (see recipe on allrecipes.com) 
I also used sharp cheddar cheese and preheated my peppers in the microwave. I used one green, one yellow and one red pepper.  I also made my rice on the side and served it with cooked corn. So delicious and healthier too.

DELICIOUS! I used ground turkey, added onions, and jasmine rice (my boys love that). It was a hit with 3 teenage boys and my husband. Served with guacamole, sour cream, and side southwestern salad.

Very good, I was out of taco seasoning, so used what i had that would be found in it.  Even hubby said he'd have them again.  Made alot of filling so i froze about half of it for another time.

Sooooo good! And so easy to make! I used turkey meat and a full cup of rice plus I made the pepper cooking part easy and microwaved them (after cutting and removing seeds) for four minutes. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe as written. Took about 35 minutes in my oven at 350 and we paired it with simple cooked veggies. Everyone LOVED it, even my picky kids who claim they “hate” stuffed peppers ; )

I used quinoa instead of rice. Added some crushed tortilla chips for texture. It was a bit spicy so a side salad went really well: tomato, lettuce, green onion and I would have added cilantro and avocado if I had some on hand. Also, there is always extra mixture left which goes really well in an egg scramble for breakfast!

This is my first time to ever make stuffed peppers. I did make a couple of changes, I added chopped onion and black olives. I also cooked this in my instant pot, and broiled cheese on the top afterwards.

OMG SOOOOOOOOO Good!!! The only thing i did different was bake the bell peppers at 375 for 20 minutes cause i didn't have a steamer and i did that while the meat mixture simmered for its 20 minutes. when i filled i did the cube in cheddar cheese in the middle and did slices  of pepper jack cheese on top!  the meat mixture was wonderful!

also I  just dumped a 16 oz can of tomato sauce in with the rice and meat. i didnt pour it on top (i missed that part in the instructions, but it turned out good!)

I started out using this recipe and it was a huge hit in our house!! I used shredded Mexican cheese, because I always have that on hand. 
Over time I added corn and black beans to the mix and my whole family (including toddlers!!) Love it. 
Sometimes we eat the filling over crunchy tacos instead of in peppers

This was super easy and had great flavor! The hubby didn't think the peppers were cooked enough, but I thought they were fine. I might try the poblano peppers next time.  The filling had great flavor!!

Love these!! I frequently use this recipe but it's easy to mix it up. I like to make them when we have company or if I'm bringing food for someone as they reheat pretty well. I add a little over a cup of rice, half a can of unseasoned black beans, half a can of fiesta corn, and some green chiles and usually have 6-8 servings. The leftovers are great to throw into a tortilla on toss into a salad for lunch. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is definitely a 5-star recipe and is so versatile! I made it the first time without any changes and it was delicious, as is. Let me note that poblano peppers are not recommended for stuffed peppers like this recipe. Then to roast them beforehand? That's ridiculous. If you want a relleno then fine, make them, but these are not rellenos! The second time I made it I did change it up, but only because it was what I had on hand and I wanted to healthy it up a bit. I used ground turkey, instead of beef; fire-roasted tomatoes and diced chiles, instead of tomato sauce; brown rice; and when done, squirted a lime over it, put a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and sprinkled it with cilantro and it was just as good! Both times I made a salad with a baby spring mix, chopped avocado and tomato and served with a cilantro avocado yogurt dressing and my family loved it! This includes 2 boys (one 6'2" and the other 6'4" and both over 280 lbs) who practically love cheeseburgers for breakfast. lol! This really is a wonderful recipe and as is, it's still delicious!

Delicious! I used Daiya dairy free cheese instead and still delicious! Also did not parboil peppers and turned out fine as they steam under the foil when baking.

Great Mexican-style peppers with room for even more custom additions.  I upped the veggie count by treating the rice more as Mexican rice, with peas, corn and sliced black olives. I also added a lot of cilantro in it. Oh, and I added a can of Rotel-style diced tomatoes to the meat. Finally, on the rice, I borrowed the seasoning for Funfetti Rice here (heavy onion and garlic powder). Finally, I used Spanish tomato caldo powder in the rice water to give that reddish hue of Mexican rice. I served with  light sour cream and additional cilantro.

My family actually loved it and so I will make again.  I did follow another posters recommendation and make it in the slow cooker.  It may have honestly been better as written roasted in the oven.  In my opinion, it came out a bit runny with the tomato sauce.  I would have liked a thicker meat-rice ratio.

The recipe is simple, easy to follow, and tasty, but I think it needs some tinkering to get it to 5 stars.

I made this exactly as it was written. I thought these were very good and not that hard to make either. I had a little extra of the meat/rice mixture left over so make sure you buy large peppers to hold as much filling as possible. I wouldn't make any changes to this.

I made these and changed this recipe up becuase I wanted more of a Mexican flavor. I used 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 chopped white onion, 1 tablespoon Spanish Gardens taco seasoning,  1 can original Rotel, 1/2 cup cooked rice (I cooked the rice in chicken stock for more flavor), a couple pinches of salt (the taco seasoning I used does NOT have added salt, so this needed some salt), 1 heaping teaspoon of minced garlic, serveral shakes of ground black pepper, 4 poblano peppers, and shredded Cobly jack cheese. I cut the Poblanos in half length-wise, deseeded, and roasted them in the oven on 400 for 15 minutes. I browned the beef with the onion, salt and pepper and drained the grease. I  added the garlic, taco seasoning, rotel, and let it simmer about 10 minutes while the rice cooked. Then I added the cooked rice. I spooned the ground beef and rice mixture into the Poblano peppers and sprinkled the shredded cheese on top. I popped them back in the 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes (until the cheese was nicely melted). I served them with sour cream. These were fantastic! Great starter recipe you can make tweaks to for your own taste!

Excellent and easily adjustable to suit your personal preferences. I halved the recipe  and stuffed 2 huge red pepper halves. Perfect amount. Also used ground turkey instead of beef. Instead of steaming, i just blanched the peppers for 3 min. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe closely, with one minor change. I didn't add any chili powder to the recipe, as my taco package was 1.5 ounces, instead of 1.0 as the recipe called for. I would make this again, but it wasn't anything really special.

I made no changes to this recipe other than my cheese cubes may have been slightly larger than 1 inch and I put as much filling as I could fit in the pepper. It was delicious! I will most certainly be making it again. I may even use this filling recipe for tacos. Loved it!

Awesome!!   I added black beans, an onion, and a small can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos.  (Made it more chopped in the food processor) and did 2 packages of taco seasoning instead of 1.  It made 6 medium size peppers and I still had some left over which I served in a tortilla wrap the next day. I served it with sour cream and guacamole.  The cheese cube in the middle is great, don't skip that step!  I did top them with cheese as well.  

Will make this again, in the peppers and to serve with tortilla.

added about 2 cups rice and could have added more.  Added petite canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Mild.  More spice? use salsa instead?

Delicious! I made my own taco seasoning and didn't pre-steam the peppers since I like a little crunch. I did add a splash or two of beef broth to the baking dish to help steam them, while cooking and for a little extra flavour. I had to sub the tomato sauce with a can of tomato paste and equal amount of water.  I missed the 3/4 cup of water in the recipe for some reason but found the consistency great as it was. Served with a little extra cheese for sprinkling and some sour cream. Next time, I think I'll try using salsa for the tomato sauce for even more zing. Thanks for a great, easy and delicious recipe!

I added a can of baked beans in tomato sauce and reduced the amount of tomato sauce by 1/2.  I do like the fact these peppers are open faced as opposed to stuffed.  Will make again!

I added Sazon con Azafran (2 packets) with the taco seasoning instead of chili powder, garlic salt, etc.  Used salsa in the meat instead of tomato sauce.  Then mixed the chili powder, garlic salt with the second can of tomato to pour over the stuffed peppers.  Also added some diced onion and black olives to the meat mixture.

Excellent. My family loved these! Nice to have an alternative to traditional stuffed peppers. This recipe can also easily be made vegan by eliminating animal and dairy ingredients and adding black beans.

My family loves this recipe.  It has become one of our favorites.  The only changes made were no salt and garlic powder instead. This makes the natural flavors come out wonderfully and doesn't need the salt, especially if you eat it with a good salty tortilla chip.

I needed to use up peppers (bell peppers, banana, gypsy,  and mammoth jalapeno) from my garden, and I happened to have leftover taco meat in the freezer, so this was perfect!  The fam loved it!  I also steamed my peppers in the microwave, like some other reviewers suggested and topped the stuffed peppers with salsa before baking.  Will make this again.  A nice change from our regular Italian-style stuffed peppers.

I usually hate peppers, but this was amazing! I used portobello mushrooms and black beans instead of ground beef, doubled the rice, left out the cheese, and it was still delicious.

Super easy to make, and delicious! The second time we made it, we added some shredded cheese on top and put it back in the oven for a few more minutes at the end, and it made it even better.

These came out really good. I used ground turkey instead of beef and organic brown rice.  I wanted more spice so I substituted hot sauce for the water and added a diced jalapeño when browning the meat. Instead of tomato sauce I used hot salsa to cover the peppers. I sprinkled cheese on top before baking. Thanks for the recipe:)

I made this for dinner. I added fresh jalapeño & tabasco peppers. It was great & my son loved it. The bell peppers were perfect, cooked but still firm. My oven runs a little hot so I only cooked them for 22 minutes.

I made this recipe with about 8 small bell peppers from my garden. I thought it was great! Steaming the peppers for 5 minutes at the start is a step I would NOT skip. It made the peppers the perfect texture when they were done.

My husband doesn't like ground beef so I subbed ground turkey instead.  The filling sounded a little bland so I added a 8 Oz can of black beans and a small can of green chillies. You have extra filling after stuffing the peppers so I took the advice of another reviewer and made the extra filling into enchaladas with a can of red enchalada sauce and they where delicious.  When I make this again instead of using the second can of tomato sauce on top I will us the enchalada sauce instead. Very tasty recipe overall.

Great recipe! My favorite stuffed pepper recipe by far!! Instead of the tomato sauce, I used Rotel in the meat mixture for some extra zip and because my family is not a big fan of tomato sauce, then topped the peppers with more cheese!  Have made this several times and will def make again!

I was looking for a stuffed peppers recipe that I thought would still have a lot of flavor substituting ground turkey for beef. This was really a fun one and delicious! I made a few changes that I think were good; I added corn, in place of the second can of tomato sauce on top of the peppers I used salsa, and when it came out of the oven I topped it with some chopped red onion, cilantro, and sour cream. We ate them with tortilla chips.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe brings some pizazz to the conventional stuffed pepper.  We  are seniors and not big eaters so started with half  the recipe and cut  one large yellow pepper into quarters.  Hubby loved them.  I froze a bit of extra filling for next time.  A little added ketchup and other leftovers should make another meal..

'Didn't exactly follow the recipe, but I have comments for anyone who is listening.  :D  Less meat, more rice, add beans or refried beans.  Top with cool toppings like regular tacos.  As is, almost a taco burger with a pepper.  'Not that it's bad, but room for improvement is all.  'Glad I tried.

I made these but used Old El Paso cheesy rice and shredded cheese versus the cubed cheese.  I have now made them three times and everyone that has had one loves them!!!!  These are fantastic.

So delicious an easy to adjust to taste.  I sautéed a small onion and couple cloves of garlic, and a jalapeño then browned meat in it.  I also swapped quinoa for rice and worked really well.  I also used used hot taco seasoning mix, my hubby and I like spicy!  Got rave reviews, thanks for sharing.

Making these again Sunday as they were a hit first time around. Used yellow, orange and red peppers just for fun and followed the advice of another to use the crockpot.  I put the peppers in the slow cooker and put on low for 4 hours. They turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic Recipe!  Followed the recipe with only few changes; used ground Turkey instead of beef, Mexican low fat cheese blend instead of Colby Jack cheese (dietary restrictions), topped the cheese with chopped fresh Cilantro.  Used Non-stick foil un top, so the cheese wouldn't get stuck to it.  Jasgirl, thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Very good recipe. I used green bell peppers and omitted the cheese because I wanted to try them without the cheese this time. I also added diced onion when I browned the meat. I loved it and will definitely make them again.

These are absolutely delicious! Have made them a couple of times and we love them. Great flavor. I steam my peppers before filling and baking them, not sure if that makes any difference, but they are nice and soft.

I made this recipe after not making stuffed bell peppers for over two decades. I was not disappointed. It was great!
I did change a couple of things. Instead of cutting the peppers in half, I took the tops off and stuffed them. I layered meat and cheese to the top. I used a cheese mix of Jack and Cheddar. Instead of tomato sauce on top, I used Bueno Red Chile that I had made into a sauce and added a bit of cheese on top of that. It was totally yummy!! The hubby loved it and so did I and I will be making this again.

This was incredibly popular with everyone as far as taste- except me.  I found it a little dull but I might be losing my tastebuds, who knows?  I have to go with the majority opinion that it is fantastic.  My complaint was how labor-intensive it turned out to be.  For all the trouble, I guess I expected something even more fantastic than it apparently already is.  Anyway, you can't go wrong with this, if you don't mind putting the effort into it.  Taste the beef before stuffing and season to your taste!

I made the dish using red, yellow and orange peppers. And substituted jarred marinara sauce for tomato sauce because I was out of tomato sauce. Also had no white rice so I used a quinoa and brown rice mixture. OMG. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

This is a wonderful recipe! I'll keep the review short & sweet. To make it easier on myself, I swapped the rice for black beans, only used shredded cheddar cheese (that's all I had on hand) & added sour cream to the top layer of the peppers. They were scrumptious!

FANTASTIC! I followed the directions exactly and added salsa to the sauce as some recommended. I also used red, green, yellow and orange peepers to give my family a variety.  They LOVED them!

I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I used yellow, orange and red peppers.   Only had 1 8oz can tomato sauce, but did have an 8oz can of salsa.  Mixed them together and added half to meat mixture and half on top.  My husband & I loved this recipe.  Will make this continually while the colorful peppers are abundant & reasonably priced  this time of year.  Thank you.

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the tweaks I made. I used 4 peppers and skipped the steaming step. I used my own taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I from this site), and I used a full cup of cooked brown rice. I added 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning to the second can of tomato sauce, and I topped each pepper with 1 tablespoon of shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of using the cheese chunks. This was a nice change from your typical stuffed green pepper recipe!

I love the fact that the "stuffing" in these stuffed peppers is not dense like a meatloaf but rather is more crumbly with a nice even taste throughout.  Next time I will not precook the red peppers (or just a quick blanch) so they remain "al dente" and not soft.  But the flavors are right on!

I would add fresh jalapeño instead of cayenne or chili powder.  I do that to my guacamole as well and everyone loves the fresh flavor and authentic flavor.  Great recipe, definitely making again.

Awesome recipe as is but of course I've modified it because that's what I do. The chili powder was too hot for my kiddos so now I leave it out (but hubby and I loved having the leftovers to ourselves!). I found that I like fajita seasoning much better than taco because I was cooking and discovered myself to be OUT of taco seasoning!!! (how did that happen?). I usually use a 1.33 lb package of beef from costco, 1 cup uncooked rice (so it makes more than 2 cups cooked), and I add 1 lb. package frozen mixed vegetables, either nuked before adding or let them simmer a bit in the stuffing mix. I double the rest of the stuffing recipe (so that's two packets of fajita seasoning as well). Instead of steaming the peppers I rub a little oil on the skin, then broil them skin sides up on low for about five minutes until the skin starts to blister brown. I don't let them get dark, but it really adds some nice roasted pepper flavor. A chunk of cheese inside would be delicious but then I'd have to go buy Colby-jack cheese when I could just use the shredded Mexican cheese blend I always have in the fridge so of course that's what I do. Since the stuffing is basically doubled the peppers end up being smothered rather than stuffed. This is my favorite recipe lately!!

Flavor was great. But I will use shredded cheese the next time for quicker melt. Also I tried the poblano peppers roasted as I reviewer suggested, but that is a disaster waiting to happen. To small and too flimsy to roast and fill.

I made as instructions mostly..... Added a pound of sausage which was a nice addition.  The whole recipe with the addition of sausage was enough to pack 8 whole peppers.  We use green, red and yellow peppers.   Used  the microwave to steam as well.  A great topper add tomatoes and sour cream to garnish.  Butter bread on the side!  Perfect meal.

Me and my husband loved these.  I followed the recipe exactly except I steamed our peppers in the microwave and added a little light shredded Mexican cheese on top before cooking.  The only thing that I think might make this a little better is to add another 1/2 cup of rice.  The 1/2 cup that was in the recipe is not a lot, so I think it could benefit from another.  We will definitely be making these again!  Second time I made it, I doubled the rice and liked them even more!

I made these as  directed but felt the filling was a little "light" in the protein department and heavy on the chili flavor.  I think the next time I might add some beans to give them more protein and some cumin to balance out the chili.  Otherwise they were pretty good and will make them again.

It was great just the way it was.  Steamed the large peppers for 3-4 min and after baking they were perfect.  Very tasty and I actually made the beef mixture the day before which made it easy to get ready for company...and all the pots and pans were done! also the cold beef mixture stopped the steamed peppers from over cooking.

Used green peppers.

Great recipe! Healthier than regular tacos but most of the same flavors.  Might use shredded cheese next time to get it more evenly spread around!

This is one tasty dish!  When I first reviewed the recipe, I was concerned that it might be a little too 'warm' as  I'm not one who cares for really spicy food.  To my surprise, the peppers (red, orange and yellow) were quite well-seasoned and maintained their texture throughout the baking cycle ( I did curtail the chili powder to 'one' tsp fearing that it might otherwise be a bit hot).   Overall, I found this recipe to be  both enjoyable and easy to prepare.  Recommend!

I changed a few things.  Took a previous reviewer's suggestion and sub'd black beans for rice.   Didn't use chili powder but used two pkgs of taco seasoning as I doubled the recipe.  Didn't add salt as taco mix had plenty.  Microwaved peppers cut in half (green, red, yellow and pablano) for 6 minutes to soften.  Then I stuffed them added a chunk of cheese, topped with tomato sauce and baked as directed.  Nice change from regular stuffed peppers.  Used leftover pepper for breakfast with a fried egg on top. Delish

It was good, but I added a can of black beans and a can of Mexican corn.  It gave it more substances.

I had only 2 bells that needed using so instead of stuffing them I chopped the peppers and mixed them into the meat mixture and topped it all with slices of colby jack.  There is only 1 of me so I have been eating it for the last few days topped with some sour cream.  I don't like wasting food but that wasn't a problem here.

I made this with Rotel (spiced it up a little more than I wanted), and used less rice because I don't like rice that much, but added a half chopped onion, cooked the rice with the meat mixture. Steamed the peppers in microwave with approx 2 Tbsp water. I  didn't have cubed cheese so inserted cubed Velveeta. I also used a half envelope of taco seasoning.
I had doubts that I would like it, but it turned out surprisingly good!  I may add some chili beans next time I make it.
I'm keeping this recipe with my favorites, and am going to make a vegetarian version for my sis.

This was very good.  The only changes I made was to use only one can of tomato sauce and some enchilada sauce for the second can of tomato sauce.  Next time, I think I will make it more of a casserole by chopping the bell peppers into chunks and adding more rice as it was just a little too much bell pepper for me.

We loved these. We will be having these regularly.  I used half the rice, and topped them with Rotel instead of tomato sauce. Next time will drain the Rotel and will soften peppers a little more.  So good and easy.

Made it to the exact recipe ingredients.  However I put in a 1/2" thick layer of meat combo, put on the cheese block, then topped with more meat. Used up all the filling and the cheese really just permeated the whole pepper.  They were outstanding.  My wife absolutely loved them as well.  May try a variant with poblano peppers but these will be made again !!!

I thought this sounded simple and easy.  

My husband does not like red or green peppers so I took the suggestion of one reviewer and substituted Poblano which are my favorite.  I googled a recipe for how to roast poblano chili peppers which, unfortunately, was not a good one.  I followed the  instructions exactly but the pepper seemed to disappear into the burnt skin.  

Other than that I followed the recipe for Mexican Stuffed Peppers exactly except for adding more rice as the filling seemed to thick and spicy.  I can't imagine topping it with salsa.  

I laid some canned green chilis as a base which helped, but it would have been better with poblanos. 

 Ok, but not what I would call 5 star even if I had used  the regular peppers.

I made this last night.  I use "Taco Seasoning 1" from this site as I am able to leave out the salt.  This dish was absolutely fabulous!  I used red and orange bell peppers as they are sweeter than the green ones.  My husband definitely said it was a keeper!

We only had one red pepper and some green peppers, so I made one of each. They were great! The only change I made to the recipe is using home-made taco seasoning rather than the stuff from the store. That recipe is also on this site. We'll be making this again!

We liked it.  I made my own taco seasoning from a recipe on this site...and instead of adding rice to the mixture, I added riced cauliflower and doubled that.  I also sprinkled shredded cheese on top the last 5 minutes and served it over brown rice.  My husband really liked it.  I liked it too.  It was easy and I'd make it again.  It didn't blow my socks off...but there we are.  I'd make it again.

I will definitely make them again.  Thank you so much.

This is very good. Made it several times. Tonight I overcooked the peppers until they were mushy so I just diced them up and stirred it all together with the beef mixture and served over rice with cheese. This way was fantastic too! I think I liked this way a little better than baked in the oven! Great recipe all around.

Excellent recipe! I made it with bison, cheddar cheese and Trader Joe's taco seasoning, which is extra spicy!

I added black beans and used shredded cheese on top and half a slice of Colby jack cheese in the bottom of each pepper. Those were the only changes I made. Yummy. Added sour cream on top and ate with tortilla chips

Had to substitute crushed tomatoes and a small can of tomatoe paste.  Careful with the salt.  Great twist to an old favorite.

Great the way as written.  Turned out perfectly. I cut the water to 1/4 cup, not sure if I needed to or not.  I did have to use 4 peppers. Mine may have been small.

this had an excellent flavor, however, reading the recipe, I felt that ½ c. of cooked rice was not enough for six pepper halves so I put 1 c. and it still wasn't enough for my taste. I also omitted the chili powder as I don't like things super spicy and with the taco seasoning the heat was perfect. If I make it again, I think I would use 1.5 c. of cooked rice but all in all, an excellent recipe and I will probably make it again.

Other than using chicken sausage, I followed the recipe. It was delicious. A pop of chili powder in each bite really thrilled. I doubled the cheese cubes inserted and they melted into GOOEY deliciousness. I served with avocado, sour cream, nachos. By the way, I steamed my peppers in the microwave before baking. Came out perfectly.

This was very good.  I did not steam my peppers first.  I just cut them in half, filled them, and baked them.

Creative and simple! And you can make it as high or low in calories as you want! I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey and used prepared brown rice.  I diced about 1/2 C of mushrooms and sautéed with the ground meat for depth and moisture. I used yellow and orange bell peppers, simply because I had no red on hand. TOTALLY DELICIOUS!!!!

They were easy and turned out tasty.  I don't like straight up tomato sauce so I added chili powder and taco seasoning to it in addition to in the meat.  I also used pepper jack cheese for more spice.  you could cut the meat by using black beans and corn in the rice mixture.

I have made this several times now and love it! I usually just microwave the peppers before filling them. There is always a little filling left over so I use it to make a burrito or quesadilla for my son.

Pretty good, at least as a base. I will definitely build on it in the future. I already added more rice and beans, as other people recommended, but still felt it could use more. More spice, more veggies, and perhaps even some bacon or chorizo. So, will definitely come back to this one, but will alter it a fair bit. Thanks for the starting point, at least!

We love this recipe.  We like "unstuffed" peppers better than stuffed peppers:  It's easier to eat "unstuffed" peppers, the mixture heats more evenly, and you can make it on the stove top.  I start the rice in a separate pan, put the ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onions, chopped peppers and spices in a large, covered saute pan and cook until the onions are soft and the beef is browned, then add the tomato sauce, and most of the cheese.  As soon as the rice is done, I add that, and cook uncovered for a few minutes.  I use Pepperjack and cheddar cheese, shredded, rather than colby jack, to spcie it up a bit more, and the shredded cheese gets distributed more evenly than cubes.  Scoop it into bowls and put the rest of the cheese on top.  YUM!

These were amazing!! I followed the recipe almost completely. The only thing I did different was use green bell peppers, and I cored the peppers and removed the insides. Other than that they were wonderful, my husband loved them!!
