Hey people - this recipe would be "great" if you just take a moment to read my suggestion. About 30 years ago, I came across an article in a magazine that had interviewed the owner of a very successful restaurant. Since he was retiring from his business, he was in a generous mood, and decided to share his secrets! (Great guy - wish I had met him!) Anyway, all you have to do to ensure a great beer batter is to do the following: add one can or bottle of beer (12 fluid ounces) to 12 ounces of flour (do the math yourself this morning, please, as I'm kinda tired from work!). Basically, the batter is just a 1:1 ratio of beer to all-purpose flour. Therefore, you can make any amount of batter you choose to - 2 cups beer, to 2 cups flour, and so on. THEN, with a whisk, mix those 2 ingredients well. Cover with a tea towel, and leave it alone! Let it sit for 3 hours, and you're ready to do anything! (A chemical reaction occurs between the beer and the flour during that time period.) Get out your seasoned fish filets, dip it in this mixture, then drop one at a time into hot oil. Don't crowd the cooking vessel, and turn only once, as the author of this recipe suggests! Drain on paper towels, serve hot! If you're feeding a crowd, and want to keep the fish warm while you're cooking the rest, place fried filets in a slow oven (200 degrees F) while you're frying up the rest. This batter also makes the best onion rings!! (The man who shared this recipe owned a steak house.) Enjoy! ~ Lauren

Great! I was having a problem with it being greasy although I drained it on paper bags. Then I switched to 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg and it solved the problem - found out from tv that egg yolks hold the oil.

This recipe is just like you would find at a restaurant.  For anyone that has a problem with the beer batter not sticking to the fish, I have a simple trick.  Set out a bowl with about a cup of flour, and before you dip the fish in the beer batter, coat the fish in flour.  Also- to keep them crispy, make sure to drain the excess oil on a paper bag after frying. You shouldn't have any problems after that!  Great recipe!

Well I made this recipe tonight for dinner....and I only have one question.  Why hasn't anyone mentioned the OVERWHELMING amount of salt in this batter?!?!  This was my first attempt at frying fish and while I did forget to coat the filet's in flour (so the batter mostly fell off), the batter was almost inedible because it was so salty (and I'm a salt lover!).  We may try this again making sure to flour the fish and I will reduce the amount of salt by at least half.

I bought two bottles of beer and did one batter with the spices used in this recipe and then I did another batter with the same recipe using only salt and pepper. The spicy batter is GREAT for onion rings and  potato cakes and my husband continued to use it for his fish, but I personally liked the plain batter for my fish and prawns. A good quality beer should be used and not light beer.
I had no problems with this batter not sticking, but if it is a problem dip fish into flour first and then the batter before frying. This batter makes a really nice crunchy fish that does NOT get soggy. I don't know how people got soggy fish from this recipe.
Make sure to salt fish or anything fried for that matter after removing it from the fryer. Learned that from Emril. Wonderful fish and will use this batter again and again. Goodbye to the corner Fish-n-Chip shop.

Deep frying 101; always lightly coat with flour to help the batter adhere. Other than adding more seasonings and less salt, this was a great recipe Linda! Thanks so much!

This is another in a collection of probably a hundred beer batter recipes.  It's good, but nothing to write home about.  I agree with other reviewers...cut down on the salt!  Also, if you want a nice crisp finish to fried fish put them on a rack not on paper bags or towels which tend to hold the oil coming off the underside and make the filet gooey.  Also, here in Wisconsin you always use 2 bottles of beer.  One for the fish, the other for the cook!

This sounds great, I do make my own version but it is almost the same...
What's wrong with you people the recipe does say salt & pepper taste.  If it's too salty blame yourselves not the recipe.  I really hate when I read reviews and the person feels they need to change everything, that is not a review on the recipe posted that is a review on your recipe only.  Make it the way its posted and then rate.

I was very pleasantly surprised.  The batter was crispy and light, the best I've made yet.  Just a tip, be sure to pat the excess water from the fish before dipping into batter to ensure a nice crispy coating.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Way to much paprika and very salty.  There was also a lot of batter left over that just went in the garbage.  It did however fry nicely and was very crunchy on the outside.  Maybe I'd try it again with half the ingredients and even less salt & paprika.

Remember to drain the fish on paper bags for the best crunch! This is
a family favorite at my house. I cut amount of the paprika in half and replace the
other portion with Old Bay (seafood) seasoning. You can make the batter ahead
so you have one less thing to do when you get home from work.

The spice/flavor was good.  I used less salt and added some Old Bay spice as well.  I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also, I should have read some of the other reviews first.  The batter was too thin and didn't adhere to the fish.  I also made onion rings with the leftover batter.  My suggestions: (a) either use half the beer or extra flour; and (b) dip everything you plan to fry in flour first, then the batter.

I did this as written and it was ok. I think I like it better with a little thicker batter. I also add a 1/2 tsp of baking powder to the mix. It puffs up the batter a bit and gets extra crunchy. And make sure you use  a good stout beer. This recipe needs a full bodied dark beer to really get the flavor you're looking for.

turned out great....just a friendly reminder to people complaining of too much salt.  Garlic salt is different than garlic powder(granulated garlic)... if using the garlic salt, omit the salt....otherwise it would be very salty.... dry fish with paper towels before putting fish in batter, and heat oil a few degrees hotter than called for because temp will drop when fish are added... dont overcrowd pot, and keep warm in a 200 degree oven while finishing whole batch....

The recipe does ask for far too much spice.  I halved the spices and it turned out great.  I did find I had a lot of batter leftover, I will make less next time.

Excellent recipe.   I used olive oil for the frying, and took others advice to coat the fish with flour before the batter.  The fish was actually better the day after we fried it.  I reheated it in the oven at 450 degrees for about 10 minutes on a greased cookie rack atop a cookie sheet...it dried the grease out and made the fish more crispy. I'll remember that!

Tried this tonight and it was mighty tasty!  Next time, I will add the beer more slowly to gauge the thickness.  First time I have ever done a beer batter and am glad I gave it a try.  I guess I have always been afraid of wasting a beer...

As written I would rate this recipe 3 stars at best. However I did modify the spices and preparation based on other reviews, with very good results. I did not season the fillets with salt and pepper. I did lightly coat them with flour before dipping in the batter. As for the batter, I cut the spices in half and will reduce the amount of paprika even further next time. Make a well in the flour, add beaten egg and some of the beer, and stir into the dry ingredients.  Add beer until the batter is the right consistancy. My batter wasn't to thin and I shook off the excess before frying.  Two other tips that I can offer are:  make sure your oil is very, very hot, and chill the batter before dipping your fillets.

Good basic beer batter recipe. ALWAYS remember to lightly flour your fish fillet before dipping into batter, or the batter won't stick. Same thing goes for battering chicken, onion rings or veggies (we LOVE beer-battered mushrooms!). For the batter, I used 1 tbs paking powder to 2 c flour, 1 egg, kosher salt, black pepper and a dash of cayenne and added enough beer to make a thick batter (similar to pancake batter consistency). I used a bottle of Stella Artois, because that's what I usually have in the fridge, but have used Newcastle and Bass. For the flour dredge, I used a cup of flour seasoned with kosher salt, black pepper, garlic and onion powders and paprika. Using a fork to dip the fish into the batter REALLY helps to ensure an even coating. Remember to make sure your oil is hot enough before placing fish into the pan - I set my deep-sided electric skillet to 375, and it was perfect. As with fried chicken, drain the fried fish on brown paper bages. It keeps them crispy and really absorbs excess oil.

This was great. I added other spices (cumin, mustard powder, oregano) on top of the basic recipe because I was making fish tacos, but it had a solid foundation. I did not find it too salty, rather a flavorful contrast to the mild fish inside. The texture was nice, stuck to the fish well, and had a great color when it was done. I had extra batter at the end and just fried it straight and it actually happened to work really well for the non-fish eater at our table!!

There was nothing wrong with this recipe at all. Flavors were great, preparation was as I expected (I was hand battering fish for goodness sake, I knew it wasn't going to be box mac & cheese easy~) My only "complaint" is that I felt guilty eating this! I could just feel fat clogging my arteries & weighing me down! So, I will make these again, when I'm looking for a special treat, but I can't make these too often at all!

As another reviewer suggested: Used 1 part beer to 1 part flour (with a little extra beer) and spices (dill, garlic, etc.).  let sit covered with tea cloth for 1-3 hours.  dredged fish in flour before dipping in batter.  soo crispy and delicious!

This was okay, but I wish I would had read more reviews before making it. Following advice of those I did read, I coated the fillets in flour before battering them, and cut salt by quite a bit - good tips.  What I WISH I would have done: Cut paprika in half and gotten the oil hotter (it was hot, but not hot enough-fish was cooked, but soggy even after putting in paper bags). I'll probably try this again, but with the above changes.

Very good. I added 1/2 t baking powder per another review to "poof" the batter and some Old Bay. Next time I will try the suggestion of using egg whites only (2) as the yolk holds grease.

the secret to ANY fried food is a constant, high heat. if you can not maintain a high heat, do not fry or it will absorb oil and be soggy. this recipe is fool proof and good for batter dipped veggies too... i eliminated the salt all together and just sprinkled it on at the table to taste..

The best beer batter fish ever!!! I prepared as written exept in place of garlic powder I used onion powder. I also only used about 3/4 of the beer and will only use half of it next time to make the batter a little thicker. Very good and will make again!!!

I think this is FANTASTIC!  I am noticing alot of people saying it is salty, or that the batter came off, a very light dredge in plain flour before  the batter should help...but mostly? Make sure your oil is hot enough, and stays consitantly hot! Oil that is not hot enough, or overcrowding, will make the batter not stick. It doesnt get to make a "shell", it just gets soggy. ALSO, be sure that when it says garlic powder, you dont accidentally grab garlic salt. if you only have garlic salt (as I do) omit the salt. Mine came out delightful, not too saltly at all. Next time I think a little Old Bay might be called for! Use the beer you like too! Its like cooking with wine, use what you would drink!

I received a little fryer for Christmas and tried it out using this recipe.  I scaled it down to just 2 servings.  I assembled the beer batter 4 hours ahead of time, much like another reviewer suggested.  I dredged the fish (tilapia) in flour first as others and then into the beer batter.  This fried up beautifully in about 4-5 minutes.  I drained the first filet well on brown paper and kept it warm in the oven while I fried up the second filet.  This was very good and the fish stayed nice and moist.  If you’re looking for a beer batter recipe, look no further.

This recipe was amazing! I had a picky eater over for fish and chips and I made this. He said it was the best fish he's ever had, and that he'd never be able to eat restaurant fish and chips again!  I did make a few changes after reading other reviews: I didn't have any beer on hand (we're not beer people) so I substituted it with what I had - Sprite. I was worried that it wouldn't work but it turned out wonderful. Second, I submerged all the fish into the batter and then stuck the bowl in the fridge for thirty-fourty minutes. This helped when it was time to fry, none of that delicious breading sloughed off!   Otherwise I followed the instructions word for word! WONDERFUL!

Great recipe. I cut the salt in half and coated the fish in flour before dipping it in the batter. Drained it on paper towels to remove oil. Came out perfect. Just like a restaurant.

good morning, I used the basic spirt for this recipe but as PrettyMissusR shared I proofed the batter (flour and beer) on the counter like a sourdough starter. when the batter was ready, I seasoned the  Fillets with a homemade fish rub (paprika, garlic powder, ground corriander, celery salt and pepper) it is a very simple rub for a delicate white fish fillet. Down here in Florida we eat alot of Spotted Sea Trout, it is a light flavored fish simular to Cod or Northern Whitefish. When you put the seasoning on the raw fillet you keep the seasoning on the fish by sealing it in batter or coating....this helps to keep you fry oil cleaner and that lets you recycle it more times as long as you filter it before storage....anyway a great recipe...keep it clean and keep it hot.

This was my first time to use a beer batter for fish.  My husband really loved it.  I used only 1 tbl. of paprika fearing that it would be too spicy for him.  It came out perfectly seasoned.  I also used a wheat ale as that's all I had, so it made my batter darker in color.  It still tasted great!

We've been eating a lot of tilapia lately, and I've been using a cornmeal based breading.  We were looking for somthing a little different so I tried this one.  We loved it.  I was worried about the amount of spices, the paprika seemed to be a lot, but it was great.  I half the recipe so I only need half a bottle of beer, so hubby seems happy with an excuse to finish the rest of the bottle for me.  How helpful he is. :)

First time I ever made this, SO EASY and no perservatives like the boxed versions, turned out EXCELLENT! After patting fish dry, coated with flour before putting fish in batter. You'll know when the fish is done when brown in color, yes, but when it started to fall apart in oil when you go to flip/remove it you'll know. As with other reviews, less salt recommended. I used a brown ale for the beer. Will make again in the future.

I read the reviews before I made this...I seen a number of reviews that thought it was too salty. Well...I don't know if this made a difference or not but I followed the advice of one of the reviews that said to let the batter once mixed sit for 3 hours. My family didn't think it was salty at all in fact...I said the next time I make it I will probably season a little more. Used the remaining batter for onion rings...what a light, quick and delicious meal. Also...thanks for the tip  on dredging the fish in flour before frying...did that with the onion rings as well and didn't lose any batter on any!

Great recipe! I kicked this batter up a notch and added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne & 1/2 teaspoon of Montreal Steak seasoning and made some of the best onion rings I've ever had. And yes, IT IS IMPORTANT to dredge in flour before dipping in the batter! I prefer draining on a wire rack as opposed to the brown paper bag (which I tried) per a few suggestions. They did, however, remain nice and crispy. Thanks, Linda, for a great recipe!

I've had better beer batter, all the paprika & garlic powder make for an odd, overwhelming spice combo...fish looks beautiful when fried up tho! Also fried mushrooms in it and those got rave reviews when paired with garlic ranch dip.

This is the first time in over 4 years since joining this site, that I've ever felt compelled to write a review immediately following a meal. I just finished eating fish tacos made with this beer batter, and believe you me, it is "made great"! It's superb! I used almost half the amount of seasoning suggested and sprinkled just a bit of salt on each piece after it was cooked and I thought it was just right. The cooking temperature suggested is perfect. Thank you SO much for sharing your lovely recipe with us, Linda!

The batter flavour and consistency was fantastic however, it was way too salty. simple and quick to make, I doubled the batch and made as per recipe. I used the batter to make flavourful onion rings (3 large onions) and with 1/4 of the batter left, I added a can of beer, a cup of flour and 1 egg. The fish I found was still a bit too salty for my liking.   All this to say, as another reviewer would do, I would do a plain unflavoured batter for my fish and use the flavoured batter for onion rings.

I'm not a fan of "white" fishes but I'm trying new recipes out for variety. I made this for my family and the kids loved it! They said it was a keeper. I did halve the recipe, though because it sounded like too much for a family of four. You do have to make sure you pat dry the fish real well before dipping in the batter to ensure you get a good coating.

I really shouldn't be rating this recipe as I didn't really follow it.  I used almost a half and half ratio with flour and beer, but tweeked it a little bit.  I used 1 1/2 cup flour to almost a whole bottle of beer.  There was about 1/4 cup left in the bottle.  It was too thick was a half and half ratio.  I added freshly ground pepper and alot of garlic powder.  I let it sit for an hour.  I also floured the fish before I coated it with the beer batter.  I also drained the fish on a paper grocery bag and it stayed SO crispy.  It was AMAZING!  I LOVED it!  The best beer better I have EVER had!!

Awesome recipe thanks for sharing! I did use only 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of pepper. My husband agreed it was the best batter ever! I also used it for onion rings. Just slice up an onion into rings -separate them and dip the onion rings in flour and then dip in this batter. Fry til golden brown. YUM!!!!

Great tasting batter, will definitely use this again. I used the left over batter on the fries that I made with this to try and match the battered fries I have had in New England from the fish & chip restaurants. Wasn't exactly the same, but still tasted good. Just make sure you let the excess batter drip off the fries before you stick them in the frier. For those who gave this a poor rating, adjust the recipe to your "salt" taste the next time, but down give it a bad rating just because it has too much salt for you.

The best batter I've tried!!!  make is light and crispy.  I used fresh garlic and didn't make it too strong.  Makes a large batch, so can probably half it.  Thanks for sharing!

Thumbs up from all 4 males in the house!  The only thing I changed was the salt amount, (1 tsp) and a few shakes of Old Bay seasoning, and no paprika, (not a favorite in this house)  Definitly drain on paper bags, bass and catfish tasted great tonight!

Nobody in my family liked this recipe.  The batter separated from the fish and was very soggy eventhough the oil was hot enough.  Taste was bland at best.  Will keep fishing for a different recipe.

Recipe is fantastic, son is chef, he suggested cut garlic to 1/2 t, add 2 t of baking powder to dry ingredients. Coat fish with corn starch before dipping fish into batter. Fish was perfectly crisp. Made my tarter sauce. A must keep recipe. Thank you, Linda

Thank you to the top reviewer of this recipe.  Adding the 1:1 ratio of beer and flour worked. I also coated lightly with flour for batter to stick to fish which it did. I omitted all salt except lightly salted the fish and that turned out perfect. My family loved this recipe and it was the first time I did fish this way. So a great sucess. One note I used an organic  white whole wheat flour from King Arthur.  It turn out very well. Thank you for all the reviews to make mine turn out great.

Very Good! Will most definitely be doing again.
Used a local Stout as the beer, the rest of the recipe as-is.

I have made this 3x ad keep forgetting to make this review, but I remember today.  This is some kind of delicious.  I cut up a whole sweet potato and cut into french fry sticks and go ahead and place those in the batter and then into my deep fryer first before the fish.  Then I do the fish.  Salt the fries a bit and voila! Fish and Chips   On soooo good.

This was an excellent batter, light yet flavorful and mostly crispy. Some of the pieces didn't crisp very well, even after putting them on the paper bag, but the flavor was still great (we used wild-caught sole instead of cod, only because it was on sale), and it turned out awesome! I agree with the others, definitely lightly dusting in flour before dipping in the batter really helps keep the batter while cooking.

I'm sorry to be the downer here... but all we could taste was the garlic powder. The base recipe is decent but the garlic powder is so incredibly  over powering, we could not get past it.

Go with the video suggestion of rolling fish in flour before dipping in batter - best fish and chips ever.

I LOVED this recipe! We used fresh skinned bone-in trout and fried the whole thing. Also, we substituted ground red pepper (1 & 1/2 tsp) for the paprika. So amazing! Love the spice! Better than any fried fish I've paid for in a restaurant!!!

Pretty good but only used half the salt and it was still almost too salty.  Will use less of all the seasonings next time as I think the paprika was a bit much too.  Hubbie really like it. Said it was "pub style".  Will make again but with adjustments to my taste.

I think my recipe is much better---like the fish and chips from shops in Canada and England.Do you think they use beer?Hardly.Not cost efficient.Dredge slightly moist(not wet)fish with a LITTLE flour that is lightly salted,shake off any extra flour,allow flour to dry.When ready to deep fry make up the batter to your favourite "regular old fashioned" pancake mix,dip fish into batter,let any excess drip off then plunge coated fish into sizzling oil(mix 1/2 corn 1/2 lard). When ready it will float to top, puffy,golden and hot.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed and thought it was awesome!  I guess it's a matter of taste.  The batter stuck to the fish just fine.  Maybe patting the fish dry is the trick.  I had quite a bit of batter left over, and I had a zucchini in the fridge, so I made zucchini sticks with the batter.  They were great too!

This was my first time frying fish and I thought it turned out really good.I had no problems with the batter not sticking but I did dry and flour the cod fillets first.I just used about 10 oz of the beer because that looked about right..I didn't want it too thin.I also halved the spices after reading some of the reviews but we thought it could have used a little more salt.The fish turned out nice and crispy and was delicious with a little lemon and green tomato relish.

This was very nice and not at all greasy. We used fresh wild halibut...and it was great. I followed others suggestion to flour the fillets first and it worked great keeping the batter on the fish.   I've never 'deep fried' fish before though so I'd have liked some indication as to how long a fillet should be cooked for. Luckily I got it right...but now forget how long I cooked them for!

This recipe is great for all types of fish!  I fried halibut & had great success.  I added 1 tsp of cayenne to the batter for a bit of a kick.  It isn't too hot with all the beer, flour, and tartar sauce - but it adds a good flavor.

Recipe needs some fine tuning. I would add half as much salt and paprika. I used some hot sauce about 1/2 a teasp and skipped the black pepper. I'm from Saint Lucia, fish needs hot sauce. i served with some tartar sauce. Great for making fish fingers for parities. Just cut the fish up smaller.

I adjusted this recipe because of the other reviews, and I wish I hadn't.  I did use 2 egg whites instead of one egg.  I cut the salt only by a half a tsp, and the other spices by half, adding 1T of Phillip's Seafood Seasoning to the batter, and to the 1 cup of Flour I used to pre-batter the fish.  After the first batch of fish, we tasted and it was bland, bland, bland.  I then went back and added all that I had cut out. . .PLUS some more salt then it had asked for. . .SO all this to say, I think this recipe, if done correctly, DOES deserve 5 stars.  Leave the salt alone!  I wonder if the other people accidently used 2T instead of 2t.  Will def do again.  I also did with shrimp, and that was even better than the fish!

This is the BEST beer batter I have tried!  I make my batter just a little thinner consistency of pancake batter. It's very versatile and works with salmon, cod, halibut and trout.(So far that's all I've tried). P.S. I've even substituted non-alcoholic beer. I've never had a problem.

I used all of the suggestions from the other reviewers to not make it soggy:  I dipped it lightly in flour before dipping in batter, I only used egg whites, and I drained on paper bags.  The grease temp was perfect, and the flavor was ok...but they were soggy.  The fish was wonderful once I took off that wet blanket of fried batter.

This recipe had just the right amount of seasonings.  I used 3/4 of a can instead of a full to make a thicker crust-it was just enough for 2 pounds of Walleye Pike.  Also, I didn't have enough oil to deep fry so I used a deep pan with 1/2" canola oil on med-high heat.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Although the crust pieces had a good flavor, the fish was soggy and the coating did not stick well. I used  catfish. Maybe I did something wrong???

All in all I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I'm not an expert at deep fried foods nor have I tried a lot of batter recipes, but this one was easy, quick, and my kids loved it.

I just bought a deep fryer and used it to make this recipe.  It was perfect!  Just like the fish you get with fish and chips in restaurants.  It was so easy.  The only problem was that it left a lingering fishy odor in our home, which remains five days later.

Loved this! I agree about flouring the fish before battering it, it really helps. Made great sandwiches~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Used this recipe tonight for dinner. Didn't have any cod, so started with 2 tilapia filets, and then raw 5 jumbo shrimp finally followed by onion rings from one one medium onion. Still had about 1/4 cup of batter left-over. Since the tilapia coating came out a little think after cooking, thinned it out before cooking the shrimp -- this perfect (used the entire 12 oz bottle of SA Boston Lager). The onion rings didn't hold the batter as well as the tilapia and the shrimp. Next time will start with the slightly thicker batter for the onion rings, then thin it out for the rest. Everything was delicious!

As posted, it's a little bland. I added a few more seasonings. Also, I agree, it should definitely list that you have to coat the fish with flour before the batter.

Great recipe, but I used Michelob Ultra.  If I could do it again, I would use a malty beer like Sam Adams Boston Lager or maybe a stout like Guinness.  Would make again. 5/5.

Soggy and that paprika is overwhelming. After two bites, we all just peeled off the batter and salvaged the fish. Never again.

This is a great batter!  Had some fresh fish and wanted a good batter for fish tacos and I found this.  Use a good beer, no lite. Use more or less of any of these spices, it depends on what you like.  You do need to pat dry or batter will not stick.
Do not over cook your fish.  
This is a keeper!

What a great recipe!..I do mix my beer with equal amounts of flour and allow it to set covered for several hours. When I'm ready to use it I add the rest of the ingredients the recipe call for. I also dust my fish with flour before I dip in batter this allows the batter to stick to the fish.

If you use the beer and flour only suggestion (which makes a great batter), be sure to season the fish heavily.  We will make this again.

Just tried this recipe today and followed all the instructions, exactly. It was wonderful! I didn't use the suggestion to coat the fish with flour, first and the batter still stuck like glue to the fish. I didn't notice that it was overly salty, either, but maybe that's because I used a 'scant' two teaspoons of salt. I instinctively knew that was a lot of salt so I was conservative with it, while still adhering to the recipe. Great batter. Will also try on onion rings!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of dredging the fish in some seasoned flour before I dipped it in the batter so it would stick better.  Turned out great!

I did not care for this recipe. As I always have batter left over when I fry fish, I decided to make onion rings as well.  I used a deep fryer and heated it to the correct degree, then put in the battered rings.  When they were "done" I took them out, but could NOT get them out of the fryer basket.  They were stuck on.  Tried every kind of tool to get them off.  Scraped off what I could and tried the fish-same result.  The majority of the fish was stuck to the basket (in a deep fryer full of oil?!).  The seasonings were a bit much, too. So I think I'll stick to my milk and egg and flour recipe and an old fashion frying pan.

Excellent overall recipe.  I questioned the huge amount of salt and pepper and garlic powder in it so I halved it.  It was fine for me.  Just make sure the oil is HOT or you will have soggy battered fish.  Definitely roll the fish fillets in flour first or the batter just slides off.

Using the flour coating first seemed to give me great results. I did forget to salt and pepper to taste the fish after patting it dry. I would have liked it to be more salty. I did have a ton left over like everyone said and was able to make onion rings as a side so it seemed like a win-win to me.

I hardly ever give five stars, but this batter is great! Turned out perfectly crispy and stuck well to the fish. Will definitely make it again. Want to try this batter with onion rings, and maybe even mushrooms!

The batter had only an ok taste and it slid right off the fish after it was cooked. It was also more oily than crispy.

This is very good - restaurant quality!  This was my first try at deep fried fish and I'm happy I chose this recipe.  I realized after I started making this that I was out of garlic powder so I used garlic salt instead and eliminated the regular salt.  I took other reviewers' advice and dipped the fish in flour before dipping in the batter.  Also, I think that 12 oz of beer is way too much (too thin). I used about 10 oz. of Sam Adams lager and it was a little thin.   Next time I will reduce it to about 8 oz, making this just perject!

This recipie was outstanding! I did increase all of the seasonings especially the paprika and salt. I also dipped the fish (I used catfish) in some panko before frying in my deep cast iron skillet. I only used 1.5 quarts of oil and fried one piece at a time to avoid overcrowding. It makes A LOT of batter, and there will be some left over. Thanks so much!

Interesting...I liked the flavor of the batter.  I added about a teaspoon of onion powder which rounded out the flavor.  I rolled my fish in flour before batter and the batter stuck like glue.  I will agree with some of the other reviews ... the batter absorbs and holds the oil... this is a TRUE fish and chips batter, so it was on the greasy side but still delicious!!! We will make this again.

Loved this recipe. Be sure to half the salt though. And I used a deep fryer to cook them. (They turned out amazing)

This wasn't the type of beer batter that I had expected because it was quite thin. The taste was pretty good though so I may try it again and make it thicker, not sure but it just didn't work as is for us

I followed this recipe exactly. It did not work. All of the batter fell off as soon as the fish hit the oil. No stars from me.

This is a really easy and tasty recipe.  My kids ate it up (which isn't very common).  I did cut back on the spices as it seemed like too much for us, but this is a matter of personal preference.  I had some batter left over so I also used it with zucchini and it was GREAT!!  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again and again. ..

My whole family loved this recipe!  I used the past suggestion to use 2 egg whites and I didn't use as much Paprika (about half).  I also didn't have garlic powder but instead used a garlic pepper seasoning and didn't add any additional salt until a bit after frying.  I only had Heineken Light and it turned out very well.  I also used flour prior to dipping the fish in the batter.  My batter was a bit thicker that the recipe suggested it would be, but still turned out great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this with sole. Took the advise of some of the reviewers and halved the spices. Not good idea, the batter wasn’t very flavorful. I may try again, or may try something else.

This was so simple, fast and GOOD!  I had the cod and my husband kept complimenting during our meal.  The flavor is fabulous!  I used a bottle of Bud.  I did put less garlic powder in the batter just because I wanted to taste the fish, not garlic.

Pretty good!  Makes a great base recipe.  I left out the egg (just not a fan of egg in beer batter) and halved the salt.

This is just what I have been looking for......crispy and not heavy. The breading doesn't soak up lots of oil while frying, since it was so thin. (I must admit I almost added more flour until I read the directions again. 
 I was a bit afraid to add too much seasoning for our taste, so I halved the pepper and the garlic powder.  It was so good and now I will not feel bad about adding the full amount, I don't think it will be too much spice.
I used this to fry some catfish nuggets and they were quick to fry and so tasty. 
I will use this for all my fish now.
I'm so glad I found this recipe. Thank you. Donna

This was really good!  I actually would have liked more flavor from spice or herbs, so I will probably add something to the dry mix, maybe more garlic and pepper, next time, but overall a great recipe!  This recipe is actually enough for 8 oz of fish though.  I doubled the recipe since I was using 8 oz, and had a ton left over.  It didn't go to waste though!  I fried up some potato wedges using the same batter....very good!

I was making this for a friend that was from England and wanted some good fish and chips and he said it was spot on! I was a bit skeptical after putting in the paprika because the batter turned red but it came out amazing! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really tasty batter, but despite the advice about flouring before dipping in batter to keep from loosing the batter in the deep fryer, it does not matter. After about 1/4 of my fish lost batter in the deeper fryer, I decided to heat oil in a cast iron skillet and finish the frying that way & it worked much better. I did not loose batter. If you do not have a cast iron skillet, you any non-stick skillet and it should work just the same. Also, I did reduce the amount of salt to 1 teaspoon and substituted old bay seasoning in place to the reduction. So very Good!!!

I am not a fish lover..I won't even eat canned tuna.  However, when my husband made this for dinner, and convinced me to try some, I was very pleasantly surprised!    Also, on a side note, as an experiment, my husband and I also discovered that this batter works perfectly for onion rings as well!

This was very good. I used tilapia. It did taste sort of fishy but that is because I had to use the tilapia..would have been better with a different kind of fish. we also made onion rings in the excess batter and they were awesome!

This batter was delicious! I used Negro Modelo beer, because it was the only kind I had on hand, and it was perfect. I added some Old Bay seasoning, and used a skillet instead of a deep fryer. I used about half the batter to make onion rings - this batter is even better for them!!

First, way better than the fish & chips I had at the English Pub at DisneyWorld, second, if you are having trouble with cooking time, remember, the recipe calls for cod, a thin fish, if your fillets are thicker, as in haddock, halibut, then it will need a few more minutes.  as for talapia, that fish is a marketing scam and doesn't belong in anyone's kitchen.  If you are still having trouble with cook times, watch the fish in the fryer, it will tell you when it is done...overcook a small piece, then undercook a small piece...see the difference in the bubbles..when it looks like it is done, it probably is...this recipe was not at all salty for me, altho I did substutute old bay for paprika..The breading did get soggy after about ten minutes. As for those who had a problem with the taste, this is most funny to me...beer is a major ingredient, the recipe does not specify a particular brand, so how can you blame the recipe..??  If you don't like the taste, try a different beer..!! I used a Sam Light and liked it a lot, have also used Bud, and enjoy that. As a beer drinker, I prefer Coors Light..All beers are different..I thought it an excellent recipe for fish and chips...good job...!!

Very good recipe! I followed it to the "t", had no problems with the flavor (not to salty...I actually added salt right after frying) or the crunch (use the paper bag, it works)...I use only kosher salt though, so maybe that is the trick.

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first.  I followed suggestions here and decreased the salt to 1 tsp instead of 2.  I also used a smokey sweet Spanish Paprika.  I was certain that it would be too much paprika but it was just fine.  I did, however find that there was too much garlic powder.  I used haddock and found that the garlic sort of overpowered the flavour of the fish.  I'm going to make it again because it's one of the best beer batter recipes I've found so far, but in the future, I'll use 1 tbsp garlic instead of 2.

THIS IS THE BEST FISH I HAVE EVER ATE. I USED COD AND SPRINKLED IT WITH SALT, PEPPER, AND LOWRY'S STEAK SEASONING, THEN I DIPPED EACH SEASONED PC INTO FLOUR.  WHEN MAKING THE BATTER I SUBSTITUTED THE 2 EGG WHITES INSTEAD OF 1 EGG....GREAT RECIPE

Very good batter! Used it for walleye fillets and YUM! Only changes I made were decreasing salt to 1 tsp. and I coated the fish in flour before dipping into batter. I tried one batch with a little thicker batter after reading some of the other reviews, and we all liked it better with thinner batter. I recommend using the whole beer.

upon reading the reviews on too much salt I omitted the salt and used only the garlic powder and emerils essence in the batter and lightly sprinkled the fillets with season salt before flouring My family and neighbors loved it!

I thought it was very good. The batter stayed on the fish since I'd floured it first. The batter was light and crispy. I think I would add more seasonings next time.

I don't have a deep fryer so I put about 3 inches of oil in a pan and fried the fish in that. I did coat the fish with flour first and that did help the batter stick to the fish, but when I went to fry it the batter would stick on the bottom of the pan and come off the fish. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the taste is bland, I think I will add Old Bay seasoning next time. The fish also seemed greasy, maybe due to frying it longer in a pan instead of a quick fry of a deep fryer.

Very good batter.  I agree with Linda McLean(hey there Linda)..fish batter 101 = flour before batter (hence the picture posted has batter missing off of the fish).  I added dill and cayenne to the batter, just because my "staple" recipe calls for it, other than that all I can say is that it didn't stick to the bottom of my deep fryer basket as my staple recipe does so that makes it even better!  Fish came out perfectly coated and yummy.  Will use this again, thanks so much Linda!!

The taste on this was OK, but it wasn't the kind of beer batter I was looking for. This isnt "english-style" fish. The batter was too thin, didn't puff up, and was kind of orange in colour. Taste was OK I guess, but I probably won't make again.

After scaling recipe in half, I tweaked it slightly since I did not have any garlic powder. I used pressed garlic and some finely chopped fresh onion. Otherwise recipe remained the same. I have to confess, this batter made excellant fried cod, and I'm sure would work great w\ any lean fish. I live in Florida by the Gulf coast, so I've tried many a fied fish, and this batter IS a winner!

This was the first time I tried to deep fry fish.  I used salmon instead of cod. I fried one piece without batter and the rest with batter. I'm not sure the batter added very much.

I made this recipe with half the salt, half the pepper and half the garlic but I still felt it had too much garlic for my taste.  I did like and will make it again it's just that I'm not fond of garlic and fish.  My husband loved this recipe.

I salted & dredged dried fish in flour before dipping in batter  as suggested by another reviewer to help batter adhere to fish.    Was perfect.   Another  reviewer suggested a 1 to 1 ration, beer to flour and cover with tea towel for 3 hrs before dipping.  I will try this because it sounds really good too & also recommended for onion rings.  But I don't have a lot of cooking patience anymore and following recipe as is was more than great.

Very good! I used less salt and pepper since there's some directly on the fish and less paprika. Overall, great, light batter.

This works great with Mahi in the Florida Keys to bluegill in Michigan! We substitute sunflower oil for better fats, but this is so easy to make and you always have the ingredients!

Wonderful! Light,crisp and crunchy. Only making two fillets for myself and my wife, I cut up a sweet onion, dredged it in the batter and we really had a great treat.

The batter was too runny.  After the first batch, I added another cup of flour, based on other recipes.  If I had to make it over, I would probably not add the egg and, add at least 1/2 cup more of flour, and only half of the spices.

very close to Hank Doktor's secret recipe from the legendary Greenwoods Restaurant in Darien , New York  !!! ... Hank did his with huge Icelandic HADDOCK fillets served whole (never ever broken) !!! ... one of the "secret'' ingredients (besides paprika ) was to fry them in Crisco oil , and the other "secret"  was one part all-purpose flour to one part RICE flour !!!

Can't give it 5 stars because the wet ingredient amounts are too high.  Make it thick like waffle batter and it will work.

I made this tonight and wasn't sure what to expect. I followed some of the reviews and modified a few things. I made the batter 1:1 ratio of flour and beer. I let it sit for a couple hours. I added the seasonings to taste by estimating per previous recommendations and used 2 egg whites instead of whole egg. I coated with flour first  and then dredged in the batter mixture. It was so good! My husband said it tasted like Long John Silvers! I will definitely make this again!!

This worked out great and we loved it. We did make 2 changes, based on comments, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. First off, we used WAY less salt.  Does not need to be a salt bomb. Secondly, we dusted the fish in a bit of flour before dipping it in the batter.

Would definitely make this again. We used Haddock not cod too, but I don't think the type of fish really matters since this recipe is more about the beer batter.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because the beer and spices make for a wonderful batter; I adjusted the salt and pepper to our taste since we are on a lower sodium diet.    It's the best fish batter recipe I've ever had and that includes from the fish and chip shops!   Thanks to the FryDaddy, it makes frying in oil simple.

Has anyone tried making this type of batter with another type of liquid besides beer ? Maybe a certain type  of soda pop or seltzer water ? I have made tempura type batters with fizzy beverages and the batter is very light and crispy. However we want that super thick crunchy crust that only comes from a beer type batter. If anyone has actually successfully made a beer no beer batter I would love to get a tried and true recipe !

This recipe was super easy. I had everything on hand and it turned out great. I took the advice of some reviewers and seasoned my fish with old bay and floured the fish before adding to the batter.plus I salted the fish lightly immediately after frying and it turned out great. I did the same to a few slices of onions for some wonderful onion rings.this is now my go to beer batter from now on.
One tip watch the temp of your oil make sure it not to hot or cold.. 360degrees. Its make a difference in how your fish turns out.

I really loved this recipe.  The key was using fresh caught wild halibut instead of cod.  It's the Cadillac of fish next to the cod and so freaking tasty. I used fresh garlic that I grated instead of the powdered garlic and I used a nice red ale for the beer.  Also, I used peanut oil instead of the vegetable oil which was much healthier and came out amazing.  Best fish and chips I've ever made!

Soggy, greasy mess.
Completely ruined the cod and the shrimp. The garlic paprika  added no noticeable flavor and the beer was nonexistent.

This looks so good and I would want to try it.  Only thing is, I never know what to do with the oil that`s left over after frying.  How do you dispose of it?  Update: Well I made it and didn't like it at all.  I think my oil was too hot so it got a dark colour fast without truly cooking the fish.  That was a waste of $20 of cod and now I'm left with a frying pan full of oil!

I have made this several times and loved it each time. This last time I added flour to thicken the batter up I put 1 tsp paprika and 2 tsp Old bay seasoning instead of the Tablespoon of paprika. Used extra batter for onion rings. Mmmm so good!

I enjoyed this recipe immensely. Followed recommendations and floured fish first, and I also allowed batter to sit for a few hours. Beer flavor was evident. One thing, it was stated that batter should be thin, there was no explanation. Well, my batter was NOT thin and it did not cook evenly. Totally my hard-headedness! Have enough remaining to try with some shrimp that is thawing. I expect improved results since I thinned the batter. Perfect recipe!

Excellent flavor of the beer! I did what one reviewer suggested and let the flour and beer sit for a bit.  Of course I didn't add the rest of the ingredients until ready to fry, batter was still excellent.  You could taste the mild beer flavor coming through.  We used a local brewed ale.

I deep fried cod with this recipe. I did change one small thing. That's two tablespoon of garlic. I used one tablespoon. I figured it would ruin the flavor of the cod with too much garlic powder. It was "okay". Nothing exciting

Trying to find fish recipes that my family will like. Who doesn't like beer batter fish? My family apparently. I followed the directions to a "t" and the batter was runny. Let the fish drip from wire racks and they were really greasy. I might try this again though using some of the other peoples suggestions.

This recipe produced a very flavorful crispy fish. I tried it as is first, then I rolled the fish in panko bread crumbs after dipping. I am not going to take away from this recipe but suggest you try one piece of your fish this way. Great Recipe. Thanks

Cut the paprika back and still found it to be way too much.... Especially if you use a smoky paprika.

I didn't have  much faith in this recipe.  I usually don't do well on deep fried foods.  I used tilapia and it was so delicious.  I dipped it in flour per someone's suggestion and the batter stuck to the fish and fried up well.  This is a keeper for me and I think I will try it on chicken one day too

This recipe worked well only if you made sure fish was patted dry and dredged thru a little mixture of flour, salt and pepper prior to dipping.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe, but my husband liked it.  First of all, I used a lite pale ale beer and  all of the spices it called for (although I only used a dash of paprika). It came out really bland. On a positive note, the batter stuck really well to the cod, because I floured them before frying. I also fried it in canola oil, which I read was healthier  than vegetable oil.  I will make this again, but with a darker, better quality beer, and will only  use salt and pepper (while omitting the garlic salt and paprika).

I (pretty much) took the advice of PrettyMissusR and let the Flour/Spices mixed with the beer (I didn't measure, I kind of "eyeballed" it) sit for a couple of hours,then I mixed in an egg and let it sit around another hour. It was the lightest,best batter that I have ever made or eaten! Neighbors came over at couldn't stop eating!

This was great. The dh loved it and that's saying a lot since he is not a huge fish fan. Followed the recipe execpt for cuting down the salt to 1 tsp and the paperika to 1tbsp and adding one tbsp of old bay seasoning. I also choose to use boston original lager. Worked great. It didn't give off a huge beer taste which I enjoyed. I will be making this again.

Very good. I took the other reviewers suggestions to heart and substituted Old Bay for the salt and halved the amount and it came out perfect. The directions say to salt and pepper the fish and then add salt and pepper to the batter, that's way to much seasoning and overwhelms the fish flavor. Just season the batter and even then cut back some.

Watch the video on this recipe before trying it. I read the reviews (about too much salt, etc.) In the video she uses 1 tsp. of salt not 2. She also floured the fish before putting it in the batter. I found the batter too runny and probably should have gradually added it until the "right consistency" for my taste. I used most of the bottle of beer (about 10 oz)..then had to add flour for some substance. The flavor was great, the paprika adds a nice color as well as a kick and a recipe that I would use again (as corrected). I used it with haddock. I was disappointed with a "sogginess" aspect ..I used a deep fryer and used the manufacturers recommendations and am second guessing the temperatures of the oil (as well as setting the fish on paper) and not on a rack in the oven (200-250') as I usually do). I like the star ratings but have found many people give high stars to recipes that have to be altered, changed or added to. I find it tedious to have to read all the reviews before I get the recipe that works. Thank you Linda for submitting this recipe. I think that after a day of fishing, fresh caught fish would be glorious on the deck and perhaps the whole beer shouldn't make it into the batter but elsewhere where it could be put to good use. Cheers! & thanks.

Having been on my own and cooking for myself for the last ten or so years, I don't consider myself to still be a rookie cook.  However, deep frying is something new.  I fixed this without changes.  The three stars is an overall average because... the taste was easily five star, however there was a heavy after taste of oil which I gave as three stars... the cleanup afterwards was a minus two stars.  Do not put the fish in the deep fryer basket as I did.  The batter stuck the fish to the bottom of the basket and and the fish was submerged in the oil so there was no need to turn the fish but when I tried to remove the fish from the basket it was stuck like glue. The batter was stuck solid to the basket and when I tried to remove the fish, the batter pealed off and was looked like it had become a permanent part of the basket.  I spent almost an hour soaking and trying to remove the batter.  So... do not use the basket to cook the fish.  Just drop the fish into the oil and forget about the basket....

Made this tonight, and my whole family loved it. Only modification suggestion is coat the fish with a light dusting of egg then flour before immersing in the batter for best results.

Made this twice already and it's great with the cream dory fillets I buy here in the Philippines. I like the consistency of the batter but I wish I could add just a little something to make it a tad tastier. Maybe a side dish could bring more flavor out or seasoning it for a little longer.

first I not a great fan of spice so if you're like me reduce the garlic and paprika to 2 teaspoons then ad some vinegar an baking powder or better some baking soda. the vinegar and soda make a crisper batter when fried (learned that from a successful fish and chip wagon hey,the UK know what there talking about) they where so good that my best friend said they where better then the fish and chips she had ever had. better then the ones her family would travel 10 hours there and back from Toronto just for those fish and chips.

I have used cod several times with this recipe and it is delicious.  Sometimes I have trouble with the batter sticking so you definitely need to dip the fish in flour or something first before the batter, but the batter is great!

The batter was very tasty but for some reason my fish didn't come out very crispy and rather soggy. I kept checking the temp of the oil to make sure it was hot enough and also used a paper bag to drain instead of paper towels but they still were kinda soft. I even watched the video for this recipe to make sure I followed it step by step. The batter was very good though, I just wish it would of been crispier.

Amazing taste, I have done with different kind of fish and with other spices and it goes  incredible good with everything.  I didn't use butter because I like healthier cooking, but with less amount of  canola oil is really good.

I never make fish because I hate fish. But my husband loves it so I thought I would give this a try for him. He loved it! I decided to give it a taste. Craziest thing - I liked it. I hate a whole piece. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

i have made this twice now.  I used the batter for cod, chicken tenders and fresh cut french fries! Yum.  I also used two different beers.  The french fries worked well with a stout and the meat with an amber pale ale.  I do flour/season salt before I dip the food in batter.  My husband requested the chicken again!

I've tried a lot of battered fish recipes and this one turned out the best.  I found cutting the fish to smaller pieces works best and dredge in flour before dipping in the batter.  Batter sticks to the fish better that way.  Definitely will make again - the search for the perfect fried fish is over!

Toooo much paprika. Your fish is not golden. My batter didn't stick well either. Will try everyone's tips. Overall fair. The recipe from the grocery store at the fish counter is better. Simple 1:1 beer, flour, tsp season .

My first beer batter fish and chips and it was great.  Nicely seasoned and very easy to make.  I would say that I might add a little more salt the next time, but AS IS, cooking this recipe will get you kudos all 'round.

Made this for dinner tonight, reducing the servings to 2 people and using one filet.  Followed ingredients, except used a whole egg and didn't have garlic powder so I used onion powder.  Cut our filet into big nuggets, but you could do whole or even sticks.  Tested one nugget to ensure batter was seasoned perfectly.  Fried each nugget until they were a golden brown, let drain and rest before serving.  Delish!

This was very good. I took the advice of another poster and dipped the fillets in a seperate bowl of flour first then the batter. I also only used egg whites.

Made the recipes as written, except I reduced the salt and pepper in the batter down to 1 tsp each.  This was a decent beer batter recipe, but both my husband and I felt the paprika took over the flavor and it was just a wee bit too much.  Will make again, but will cut the paprika down to 1 tsp as well.

OMG! I used Walleye instead of Cod for this recipe and it was Fabulous! I've gone out for fish and paid good money for dishes that didn't taste half as good! I truly cannot say enough about this recipe.

i loved this. i added a little Cayenne pepper to it though and the first filet i made took a long time so in preparation of that evenings dinner i pre-fried the pieces with the batter and then right before dinner i battered them a second time and fried them. It made the breading super fluffy and very crisp and flavorful. you should try it

Great recipe. Unfortunately, I cut the salt in half because several reviews said it was too salty, and it ended up being too bland. I wonder if they used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. I think 2 teaspoons of salt would be just right, and I will make it that way next time.

Am about to make this for supper, and as a pre-review, I am using flounder, freshly caught, andI am using Labatt Blue beer. I am going to cut the salt because I have only garlic salt, in which I am using only 1 Tablespoon, and will be following the rest of the recipe as is. (I would use the full 2 T of garlic powder if I had it, and only half the salt the recipe calls for). I am also doing some with a flour dredge, and some without to compare, and draining on brown paper..:) I love a light and crispy batter, so looking forward to making this!

_________________________________________

Ok....so have done the fish, and the batter was really good. I am rating a 4, JUST because I changed the recipe a bit to use what I had, and when I make this again, I will follow the recipe to scale. I tried both flour dredged and not and to be honest, I preferred the non-dredged. I found the lour dredged ones, drier, and less flavorful. If you prefer to dredge, then I would say to up your spices.  Anyway that you put it though, this is a great recipe that I will definitely be using again and again! Thanks!

This batter is fantastic!  My review is missing one star, as the amount of paprika listed is too much. The finished product ends up looking overcooked because of the dark colour.   I have since made this again and only added 1 1/2 tsp paprika.  My boys all love it. Yum :)

The only change we made to this was to scale it down to 6 servings.  Did not change the recipe at all, used cod fillets, and did not add extra flour.  I used Corona Lite for the beer.  We did six fillets, 3 at a time, making sure to let the oil come back up to frying temp in between batches for a couple of minutes so that the batter would adhere.  Kept the 3 fillets that were done, warm in a 200 degree oven on a paper towel in a pan.  Served with home made tartar sauce, malt vinegar, or ketchup depending on preferences.  Very good flavor, light and crispy batter, will definitely be making this again.  This would be fun to play with using different seasonings like Old Bay.  Would make a fantastic fish sandwich in a crusty roll with tartar sauce and some fries and slaw on the side!

We tried Cod for the first time and found it to be pretty tasteless.  Not a fish we would have again.  The batter was good and we followed the recipe exactly.  We did a test piece of fish and found the batter to be too thin.  We added about 1/3 cup more of flour and did another piece.  MUCH better!  I used my deep fryer with the mesh basket and it stuck to it something awful!  Would use a cast iron pot next time to prevent this.  Everyone liked the fish for the most part but requested we use a different fish.  Will likely make again with modifications.

Little less salt. Used seasoned salt instead. A little less garlic powder. No need to salt after frying. Fried okra, summer squash, green tomatoes, and red onions.

I made this last night and it was AWESOME!  I've tried several different beer batters and they've all been lacking that pizzaz.  This certainly did the trick - it was thick and had lots of flavor.  We made these into fish tacos with a mango, tomato avocado salsa also on this site, they were super delicious!
We will definitely be making these again.  Thanks so much for sharing.

The taste was good, but the batter fell off the fish.  I saw on tv that you want to let the fish dry after rinsing it, or the batter won't stick.  So don't make the same mistake I did.  And I spritzed it with a little lemon juice and it tasted great.

I cut back on salt (if I use any at all) when cooking "salt water fish".  As such, I never add to canned fish and the like ... no complaints after many many years of making crab, tuna or salmon salad even when I had my catering business.

Lacking in flavor, but mechanically is a nice batter. My husband really enjoyed it, but I thought it was missing something.

An absolutely fantastic beer batter recipe!  I had so much batter leftover that I made beer battered onion rings, broccoli and mushrooms.  Fantastic!  Used a light beer because that's all we had on hand, next time would prefer to try with a dark beer.

I didn't add the whole beer, I only added enough for the batter to get thick, using the whole beer makes the batter too thin for my taste. I also coated the fish in flour as suggested, worked like a charm! Very delicious!

Came out great.  I ran out of garlic powder, so just used garlic salt.  I didn't have any paprika left, so didn't use it.  I used the tip of flouring the fish before dipping in batter.... the batter stayed on just fine and was very crispy... very yummy and was a hit with my husband... will definitely make again.

Made this tonight. Since I don't drink alcohol, I didn't know what beer to use that would be best. I ended up using a pale ale, and it still came out great. My friend told me afterwards that a hoppier beer would be better, and that Samuel Adams lager would be a good choice, so I will try that the next time I make this. I doubled the recipe, and the only change I made was substitute all of the paprike for Old Bay seasoning, and reduced the salt by half. I used cod, and had enough to make onion rings and fried zucchini. this fed a family of 4 adults with more than enough. I also dredged the fish and veggies in flour first before dipping in the batter.

It tasted so yummy!  I used Tilapia because that is what I had in my freezer.  I also took advice from other reviewers and cut back the spices a bit, I was not disappointed..very delicious.  Thank you Linda for sharing this recipe with everyone :)

I can't believe this is on here.  I am so disappointed. If you like deep fried fried fish without breading which is what you end up with at the end then this is for you.  Beware! this is a waste of garlic powder, paprika, flour, and egg.  Aweful!

Thought this recipe was good as is, but will definitely be adding more than spices than the recipe calls for.  I also pan fried it, rather than deep fry--came out PERFECT.  Can't wait to try onion rings with this recipe....YUM!

I'm giving this 3 stars based on how well the batter stuck to the fish.  The taste was amazing, I have to say!  Very light and crispy, not heavy.  However, I did have a hard time getting it to stick on the fish, and even had my fryer up all the way.  I also used it on onion rings, which was a total bomb.  Ha!  The batter didn't stay on them at all and just made a mess of the basket.      I'll probably keep looking, but the taste really was great.

As another reviewer stated, 'Epic Fail'.  I don't know if using half frozen fish ruined it but all the batter slid off the fish to the bottom of the oil and caked there.  The fish became small little grease patties as a result.  Next time I'll try fresh fish.

Batter came out spongy, way too thick, just nasty.  Was not crispy or thin at all.  Gross.  I had to peel the batter off after it was done cooking.

I never knew it could be this easy! I didn't use a deep fryer, just a saute pan with oil to cover.  They came out so great! I used Old Bay instead of paprika, used no salt, and Pyramid Hefeweizen for the beer.  Delicious, will make again!

I am very particular about my fish and chips.  This batter was wonderful...as good as or better than most restaurants.  I halved the flour, garlic, salt, and paprika.  I also added about a tbsp of seasoning salt (no MSG).  Used a full bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager.  I don't think a lite beer would taste as good.  Thanks very much for the recipe. :))

Excellent recipe.  We use the batter for fish and onion rings.  We live in a small town (pop. 1500) and the local restaurant used to have a Friday night fish fry, but with the economy they have closed in the evenings.  Now we can have our own fish fry anytime!  Thanks!

This recipe turned out amazing!  I loved it.  It was my first attempt at frying fish, and it was a great success.  I made sure to coat the fish in flour first (I did a trial one, and the batter slipped off too much).  I also reduced the salt by half b/c others mentioned it was too salty.  All in all, this recipe was really good, and I look forward to making it again.

My first attempt at beer batter, and boy did I find a good recipe to use!  I also cut back on the salt to about 1 1/2 tsp.  Will definitely use this every time we fry fish!  BYW, you can get away with pan frying this in about a half inch of oil! -- just be sure to flip after five minutes.

Again, like many others, I cut the salt to less than half, hence the 4 stars. I was in fish-fry mode today; I prepared this in addition to the Coconut Shrimp II from this site. With this recipe I cooked sole and bay scallops, a pound of each, and had batter let over. I rolled half the battered fish in Panko crumbs for variety and really enjoyed that, maybe more than just battered alone. I prepared this batter first and refrigerated it to let it rest while I prepared the other stuff. Really good, definitely a keeper. My family came home to find me slaving over the hot stove 9no deep-fryer) and they all exclaimed that it smelled like a delicious seaside restaurant in the house! Thanks for posting.

These were very good, the only thing I did different was leave out the egg and add some lawrys seasoning to the mix. They were perfect just like you got them at a restaurant.  We fried up some crinkle fries and had fish and chips for dinner.  My husband loved them.  Will make again.

This stuff is horrible.  I didn't have any problems with it sticking to the fish.  I used cod and made sure it was patted dry with a paper towel.  It cooked up okay and actually looked pretty good.  But, the taste was horrible. Too much salt and I love salt.  The mix of paprika and garlic poweder along with the over salty flavor overpowered the fish. I will not be making this again. Yuck!

Nice tasty batter mix, although I did scale down the spices a bit. Wish I could figure out how to keep the fish crisp though. Next time I will drain fish on paper bags instead of paper towels - which made it soggy.

This was my first attempt at making beer batter fish.  I found it to be very simple and tasty. Thanks to suggestions of coating the fish in flour, I had no problem with the batter staying on and the fish was nice and crispy.  My son doesn't like a lot of pepper, so I cut the pepper and paprika in half and only had 1 Tbsp of garlic powder left so I used that and 1 Tbsp of onion powder.  I did not find the amount of salt in the recipe to be too much, however I did not salt or pepper the fish before rolling it in the flour & batter.  Will make again - Thanks!

I used 3 filets of tilapia that I cut into 2 inch pieces.  put tilapia in a bowl with 2tbs of lemon juice, 2tbs of parsley, salt and pepper.  For the batter - 2 eggs, 1/2C flour, 1/2C beer, 2tsp of cayenne.  Dip pieces into batter and into the pot of oil. I had no problem with the batter staying put.  Delicious!  Took only a couple of minutes to cook.

This batter came out great.... I added 1/2 cup extra flour because I was frying a lot of fish... and it was too thick with only 1 bottle of beer... so I actually added almost a whole other bottle. People who said the batter was too runny... I think it is supposed to be runny... I fried some fish at different consistencies as I added more beer and thinned it... the fish fried with the thinner batter came out better.
Also I did not think the spice was too much at all... I added extra flour so I also added extra spice so it would be proportional to the original recipe. The only thing I did change was the amount of salt because I would have hated for this to come out too salty, based on other reviews. Other than the salt... I think this is exactly what I was looking for and will definitely use again.

I loved the flavor of this batter and so did my 9 year old.  I used half the amount of paprika and just under a teaspoon of salt.  I followed previous tips of using flour to keep the batter on the fish.  My batter was soggy, probably due to a lack of paper bags,  I tried using a cooling rack with paper towel underneath instead.

Easy, quick and delicious! MMM mmm :p  
If you make this batter on the thin side it doesn't work as well for onion rings.  Make the rings first with less than the full amount of beer added.  Then for fish add more beer until thin.  

I used pollack and a nice dark Porter from Deschutes Brewery.  Yummy!  Thanks!

This was good with the modifications others had suggested.  Either use more flour OR less beer and you'll get the best batter!  I didn't add any salt since I had pre-coated my fish in a spicy flour mixture, and this helped the batter stick to the fish. I refrigerated leftover batter to use the NEXT day on some chicken.  When I fried the chicken, it puffed and browned like the fish the day before, but the coating was chewy rather than crunchy.  I guess the batter doesn't keep well overnight. This recipe is definitely good to use the same day, but I would not recommend making it in advance.

YUM!  These are great!  I used fresh tuna my sister-in-law caught, and it was awesome!  Very flavorful, and I didn't find it over-seasoned or too salty at all.  I did follow others' advice and dipped in flour before putting in the hot oil, and it definitely helped because my batter was super runny for some reason.  I try and stay away from fried food for the most part, but these are awesome and we'll be having them again!

This batter turned out quite well which surprised me considering how thin it is once you add the entire beer.  I did dip in flour first and it created a nice thin, crispy crust.  I may try only 6 oz of beer next time since I prefer a little thicker batter on my fish.  I was worried about too much salt as other reviewers mentioned but I used sea salt and it wasn't too salty at all.

This was a fantastic batter, the best part about it was it required no weird ingredients. Just stuff you already have in your pantry. Make sure your oil is hot enough to ensure this comes out crispy

This was excellent! My only problem was it had too much salt. I only put one teaspoon salt but it was still too much. I didn't have paprika so I omitted it but the dish still tasted great! The batter was surprisingly light and it went so well with the cream dory fillets I used.

Good.  I laid the fish in flour before dipping it in the batter, and that turned out better than putting it straight in the batter.  It needed a little more spice, but it was good.

I never fry foods, so this was an adventure, (watch out for the splattering oil),...but it turned out good!  I only used salt and pepper for the spices, and salted the pieces when they came out of the pan.  I also used the batter for onions, very good!

Very good. Used in my deep fryer so it wasn't very easy to get the fish out of the basket. I had to turn it over and dump it out. Got a bit messy but it was worth it since my family raved over it. My husband was shocked it was so good, I guess he didn't think I could do it?

Wow!  I used fresh flounder and my wife said it was just like Cap'tn D's fish with hushpups on the side.  There was a lot of unused batter, so I will use less next time even though I used 4 boneless filets on our first attempt.  Dried the fish and the coating turned out SO crunchy!  Nice.

Tasty!  The batter was fantastic!  I would definitely make again.  I also mixed a little of the batter with my chip batter for delicious fish and chips!

I've made this several times without any changes to the recipe and it's great.    We've had it with red snapper and everyone loves it.  I always have plenty of batter leftover so I will eventually adjust that.

Made exactly as directed and it ruined my fish.  Wasted some really nice and expensive Canadian cod. ..... honestly I would never use this recipe again

Also, the instructional video attached uses a  different measurement for salt than the actual recipe, as in half the amount.  I noticed this when I decided to watch the video to see if maybe I had made a mistake, but no..... it’s just a bad recipe

This was the worst beer batter recipe I've ever used. It doesn't coat the fish well enough, so most of it slides right off and what little is left on the fish does not get crispy at all. We even tried putting it in the oven for a few minutes to crisp it up, but even that didn't help.  The fish itself was tasty, in spite of this awful batter.

I took the advice of the “critical” review of 12 oz flour, 12 oz beer, let sit for 3 hours and it was perfect. Can’t get any easier. Next time I would season the fish however, it was bland but the batter puffed up so nice and was so crispy.

Love it!  Pat dry the fish thoroughly, lightly dredge in flour before dipping in batter.  Always be sure your oil is HOT before each batch to prevent soggy batter.
Delicious!!!

Ugh. Way, way too much paprika and garlic. I accidentally halved the amount needed and it was still overpowering.  

Also, no mention of keeping the batter cool, or letting it rest. We did that automatically.

Will be moving on to a different recipe.

Sounds good and making tonight. A warning before I or anyone else makes it!  Check your frozen cod loins for trisodium phosphate As ingredient.   And cut salt accordingly!   Every 6 oz loin of mine already has 230 mg sodium!  I am cutting salt added by 1/2 or will be way too salty.   Fresh loins from seafood market should not have that preservative on them. Unless previously frozen.   Ask!

I  added one 12 oz beer to 1 cup flour and let sit for one hour for the batter (no seasoning, no egg). I used 1 1/2 tsp of salt instead of the 2 tsps called for and added 1/8 tsp dill weed to the above called for spices plus 1/4 cup flour and a tbsp of corn starch for a dredge (different from recipe). I dredged the cod in the seasoning first and then dipped in the batter and straight to the fryer as directed. 

Fried until golden, checked internal temp to be +165 F, hit with some salt, and put on a cookie sheet covered with paper bags in a 200 F oven until all pieces were cook.

The cod was amazing; light crispy batter, perfectly seasoned fish - served with homemade tartar sauce.

The batter requires 1/2 Tbsp of baking soda and at least an additional 1/2 cup plus of flour. The recipe as it is does not puff up enough,  is not crispy all over and is too thin to completely cover the fish.

Our fist time to deep fry fish. What a great and easy way to cook fabulous fish. We loved it. Will try onions as well next time - now that we know what we are doing - and maybe some squash. Thanks Linda Olar for a great meal!

Not a fan of this recipe. We followed another suggestion and used only a egg yolk in the recipe and still not impressed. Batter was way to *fluffy*  This recipe is one we wouldn't make again .

Followed pretty much the whole recipe with minor changes.  Doubled the recipe, used 500ml of beer, so 2/3 of what it called for, 3tsp of salt and 3 tsp of pepper, instead of paprika i used 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Used 4 whites from eggs, not the yolks, and after patting dry the fish i tossed in a bag of flour.  Put in the fryer at 375F cooked for 4-4.5 mins on either side, came out amazing!!

First of all, thanks to all for the recommendation on reducing the salt.  As a "salt-a-holic" I take these recommendations with a near-literal grain of salt.  I reduced it to about 1.5 teaspoons, and I salted/peppered the filets, too. It was just right for us on the saltiness-side. 

Where this recipe is a bust for us (and I'm shocked that more folks haven't called this out) is the INSANE amount of paprika and garlic powder it calls for!  I had to do a triple-take to ensure I saw it right... TWO TABLESPOONS for each?!  I halved it for both, and we were just overwhelmed with the paprika in the finished product. (Garlic was up there, but tolerable.)   Possibly reduce both of these, too... to maybe a teaspoon?

I made many times for shrimps, scallops and fish filets.
I omitted the egg and the garlic from this recipe it made the best batter ever.

It’s really easy to make and to also cut in half. And the fish is tasty. I’m going to ry this with Guinness in the near future.

Made as written. I did dip the filets in flour so the batter would stick better. Also use this batter for onion rings. I usually double the recipe and do fish and onion rings together. Really good!

Note: I’ve used this recipe with my AirFryer and what a lovely result! The fish I used was Haddock and Catfish. By allowing the batter to sit for a few hours helps the coating stay on the fish. Excellent for those of us who enjoy the fish with a thin coating of batter! This recipe has become a family favorite. Thanks for sharing ??

This was a lot heavier than I expected, and I followed the recipe and included tips (like placing fish on a wire to drain)..  it ended up very greasy and heavy, not flakey/crunchy like I’d expected from all the great reviews. 

I’m going to keep looking.

Way way too much Paprika! 2 teaspoons would be more like it, not 2 Tablespoons! We ended up scraping off most of the batter and still had overpowering paprika flavor that  lingered on our taste buds for hours after our meal.

Turned out well. I put a little bit of a pepper/flour mixture as a coat on the fish before the batter so that it would stick better. Worked out great!

Used this recipe for Good Friday supper.  A nice light tasting batter.  I did add a little extra flour after frying the first piece and then the consistency gave a perfect coating to the fish.

Great consistency. We'll definitely use it again. Recommend more seafood to make use of all the batter. Also, can pan fry with less oil.

I followed the directions meticulously, and what I got was -- well, a disaster.

Mainly, the batter would not adhere to the fish during the cooking. 

The cod fish had no taste whatsoever -- unless you consider the gross excess of garlic and paprika a taste.

I followed the recipe exactly . I pat dried the cod before I dipped into the batter. The crust browned but was soggy as could be. It was not crispy at all. The oil was trapped between the fish and the crust. It was a total disappointment and we ended up throwing it all out and not eating any of it except the first initial bite we took.
All of my ingredients were brand new and the fish was fresh from the meat market.
What did I do wrong??
The oil was hot enough

I can't imagine using this recipe as given.  I I thought I'd try something new but....

I'm sorry, but it is just too overpowering for for fresh  haddock.  

I dumped the batter and went back a more classic level of seasonings.  Keep it simple.  You will be glad you did.

Short story, it turned out very good and I will make this again. Long story, I took time to read many of the reviews, especially negative ones that offered tips and took their advice. Specifically, I used equal amounts of flour and beer, cut the paprika and salt in half, and used 2 egg whites instead of 1 whole egg. I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp baking powder. This will become my goto batter for a lot of things.

I should have read the reviews with suggested changes first, the batter was way too runny as is and I did not let it sit.  Result was very oily fish with very little batter on it.  Be sure and let the batter sit and add more flour.

This was an excellent recipe. I made sure the cod was patted very dry prior to applying the batter. I used guiness as my beer of choice and it turned out excellent! I usually like tartar sauce with fish but this didn't need anything except maybe a slice of lemon

Batter didn't stick, had no flavor, and was soggy-not crunchy like it's supposed to be. The color of the paprika makes the fry look like it sounds full of flavor, but it's not. I've made plenty of beer battered fish and this recipe is lacking :(

This ''Beer Batter'' is great... I didn't add the egg to the dry mixture, however I dipped the fish in the egg, then into the batter....The batter stayed on & tasted great... I reduced the salt, for dietary reasons,  but  we could add salt ''as needed'' while eating it... I'll make the recipe again...WE loved it!!

I cut the recipe in half.  I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup beer.  I coated the dry fish in flour prior to putting in the batter.  It turned out perfect.

I made this and thought it was very good, I did not put 2 table spoons of paprika only 1 and just 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.
The fish was crispy and great.

So I decided to make it,  after all the great reviews.  Way to bland. No flavor.  This batter needs more spices. I used Coors Light, and it just was not good. I. wanted to also make fried mushrooms with the remaining but not anymore. Try a different recipe.

First attempt at Fish & Chips. Once I figured out my new mini deep fryer and that I shouldn't use the basket, it worked out ok. Skipped on the garlic powder and followed the recommendation for the 1:1 beer to flour ratio after the first ones seemed to too thin. Once the I got the batter the way I thought it should be the fish started coming out great. Deep frying is a messy chore and even though the fish turned out tasty, it will be a while before I try this again.

Skipped the black pepper because we aren't fans of too much heat, and the only paprika I had was smoked. Happy accident, it was amazing! I also dunked some whole mushrooms in it and fried them as well, and they came out beautifully - very tasty! I only needed about half a beer, by the way.

This is a delicious and crispy batter. Due to some reviews complaining of saltiness, I wanted to err on the side of caution and only used 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper. It turned out perfect!

This is an excellent recipe! Light and fresh, I halved all of the spices, used non-alcoholic beer and it was fantastic. I also mixed the batter up several hours before I needed it, covered it with a light towel and just let it sit on the counter. I used cod that I had in the freezer, so I defrosted it and made sure to dab it dry with paper towels. After rolling the fillets in flour, I dipped them into the batter and fried them for about 5 minutes, until golden brown. They turned out perfectly, using a small Fry Daddy. I did make sure to put them in one at a time and also made sure that they weren't sticking to the basket or each other after about a minute into the frying. I served it with tarter sauce made with mayonnaise, relish and a bit of lemon juice. Perfect!

followed recipe as suggested, set my oil temp correct. Finished product was less than crisp and crunchy than expected. Even got soggy on the bottom with it sitting on a wire rack. What happened? won't be trying that again. I would leave the egg out.

Not really sure what happened but I followed the recipe on point and I am an experienced cook but the flavor was not good. This unfortunately was a first fail for me in the kitchen. I wouldn't recommended this recipe.

I have cravings for fried seafood every now & then but I live in DC where you can't get great fried seafood like I could back home (Cape Cod). I tried this a few times & I LOVE it! the batter comes out so crispy & the fish was light & flakey just like back home. I'm gonna try doing scallops this summer. 

make sure the oil is hot!

Hi folks..recipe is a keeper just cut the paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper by half measurements when making this recipe and it'll turn out A1..I found using a full bottle of Corona beer as well gave it a lighter taste than using a stronger darker beer/ ale..pat your fillets dry with paper towel and lightly flour then dip into the batter mix and let it drip off until you can see the fish fillet then drop it into the deep fryer always turned out great for me..no excess flour build up on the inside of the fish coating..better than alot restaurant recipes I've tried in my area...

Pretty good recipe. Great advice from previous reviews on coating fish with flour first. I didn't add much salt and this recipe could have used more. I went light on the garlic and paprika but should have used a full two TBlspns on each. Not really much flavor to the batter so maybe some additional spices would help. I put my fish on a rack above a baking sheet when done and they were crispy all around. I would say you could probably cut this recipe in half. I had two pounds of halibut  that I cubed and I still have at least have the beer mixture left.

After adding 2/3 bottle of beer the concoction was way too runny.  Added additional 1/2 cup flour.  Although this makes a great flaky batter, the garlic and paprika were OVERWHELMING!  My breath could kill a vampire right now.  Going to omit them next time.

Makes WAY TOO MUCH batter. I doubled it because I had 1.25 pounds of fish. I had so much I made 1 pound of shrimp (delicious). And still had about three cups left. 

Per cup of flour I added 1T Old Bay, skipped the salt and pepper, and added 1/2 T dill, along with the garlic powder and paprika overall nice flavor.

Ok..... after a little bit of research I have figured out the secret step that was left out of this recipe. A very, very old cook book I found gave this explanation for deep frying. "Wet won't stick on wet and Dry will not stick on dry". So... Here's the remedy for your batter not sticking.  You must run your fish under cool water, pat dry and THEN coat it with flour BEFORE you dip your fish into the wet batter. Take it from my experience . The batter was good but the directions lacked direction. Hope this helps those that the batter floated to the top of your deep fryer.

I followed the recipe precisely, and used a pale ale as the beer choice. Our fish was Alaskan halibut. 

The flavor of the batter was not bad, but it wasn't visually appealing to me. Due to all the spices, this batter is very dark in color--much darker than any beer batter I've ever eaten or seen, and even before cooking.  I suppose that doesn't matter too much, but I would prefer a batter that fries up to a golden color. 

The batter adhered nicely to the fish, so that wasn't a problem.

In all, it was OK, but I probably won't make this again. I'll continue my search for my ideal beer batter!

I used Guiness for the beer, and I thought it came out fantastic. Not thick or doughy like some batters. Will make again.

Very good but salty.  Next time I'll reduce salt by 50%.  If you need to watch your salt intake or you just don't care for salt that much you should also consider cutting the salt.  Otherwise it was very good!

I did not use the seasonings for the fish and it fried beautifully. I did put the seasoning into the leftover batter and made mushrooms and onion rings that were very tasty.

I read reviews and cut the salt a smidge, but I added salt and pepper to flour.  We do not eat lots of salt but I did not find it too salty.  I also cut the fish into nuggets and fried them in a deep fryer for 2.5 minutes.  Served with fresh tartar sauce made with sweet relish.  I was worried when I saw how red the batter was but it fried up golden brown and delicious!  Great recipe.

No problems getting a crunchy coating to stick, I rolled the fish in flour, then the mix and let it rest for about 20 minutes before frying.  Something in the flavor was lacking, using this on cod. After the fish was fried, I used the rest on onions for onion rings and they were great.

I usually have trouble with battered cooking, but this seemed easy and the reviews looked promising. Looking at the ingredients, you can tell it's going to be salty between salting the fish, salt in the batter, and the garlic powder. I love paprika but I adjusted it to a tablespoon and about a half and I used my new love...smoky paprika. I also did not salt the fish, only pepper and Mrs. Dash, and I reduced the garlic powder by half. I also love the suggestion by another reviewer to coat in a little flour first, along with patting it dry before dipping, that helped and I made sure my oil was hot enough and only turned once. It came out pretty good. I probably left about 2 or 3 tablespoons of beer in the can because I did not want really thin batter. I am going to spice it up more next time though, maybe cayenne pepper and some other seasoning  my goal here was more to get the batter to stay on and to get it cooked properly. I had some batter left, so it might be good to plan shrimp or maybe onion rings, which I don't like so I might opt to try coating some thick cut fries or whatever. This batter seems like it would work for most anything. Now if I can only get the chicken right. :-) Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews!!!

This was my first try at frying fish, so I was a little nervous. It came out great, light coating and flakey fish, I couldn't stop eating them. My son said that it was restaurant quality. I will definitely be making this again and again, no need to look for another recipe.

First, I made it exactly as written except changing whole egg for 2 egg white to decrease absorbing grease. Was a little bland for Hubby and I.  Second time I added 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper. We enjoyed the kick. Excellent starting point. Oh yeah, also tried with chicken.

We love this beer battered recipe for both fish and the chips (potato wedges) we serve with them. I am sure I can feel my arteries beginning to harden with every delicious bite. I may have a heart attack, but I will die happy with fried fish in my belly.

I can see how the fish would be good but sadly it's just too greasy! I have never added eggs to a beer batter but I wanted to try something new. So sad to waste a nice piece of fish. If only I read the reviews first.

Didn't work. The batter would not stick to the fish even after I coated it in flour, it would just slide of and if it did stay on then it would dissolve in the oil.

It was fantastic! I did everything as instructed and it was easy and fast and stayed on the fish for the most part very well! I did 7 normal sized cod fillets and there was plenty leftover! I will definitely keep this recipe around!

Solid recipe; I tried it using sole to yeild different results. The batter turned out to be more of a crispy coating rather than a batter, but nonetheless it still turned out quite well. The batter itself was a bit bland, so try adding vinegar and a bit more salt.

Great!  No need to go out for fish fry if you have some good tasting fish!  I didn't put much salt in the batter, in fact I lightly salted the battered fish after it was done cooking.  Also did not use pepper.  I figured that is up to the individual who's eating it.  I also did not use any paprika.

Turned out delicious! I took some suggestions. After reading the reviews, I decided to add a little extra flour because some of the comments I'd read said the batter was too salty. I also used three egg whites (from a different review) instead of two since I added the extra flour, and I added Old Bay seasoning to the batter. After taking them out of the oil I placed them on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe except for the beer. I added about a cup of milk and two tsp. of baking powder and we absolutely loved it!

I usually do not like fish but I really liked this recipe. I did soak mine in milk and old bay seasoning first. Then I patted them dry with a paper towel and I salt and peppered then lightly brushed flower so they would stick to the batter. I would mention less is more on these. Make sure you do not get to much batter on the fish, because it will get soggy when there done with the grease.  You just want a thin coat. I used this on Fresh water Bass.

I was looking for a batter recipe for calamari.  I could not find one specifically for calamari so when I saw this one I thought I'd give it a try. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter. It was delicious!!!  It took my calamari from OK to fantastic.  Tonight I made it again but halved it. I like a little spice so I added 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper to the flour.   Using fresh squid caught at our dock, cleaned and cooked within the hour, it was the best calamari I have had.  This will be my go-to recipe when I need a batter.  As is for basic batter, add cayenne to jazz it up!!!!!

This is an excellent batter.  I used halibut and found the batter light and crispy.  I did however cut the salt in half when I made it.  I would agree with the other reviews that it does not need this much salt and was glad I cut in half.  It was just right with 1 teaspoon.

I made it today! I didn't used salt, I used Old Bay and not on purpose I only used 1/2 cup of flour and not the whole beer as it looked too watery, I also didn't 'lightly coat with flour' therefore the mix didn't stick?? however the fish tasted very good. I'll try it again following the instructions.

The batter itself was awesome, not too thick and it was very crispy. I would adjust the seasoning however, I would double up on all the seasoning and I had substituted chili powder instead of paprika. I used the left over to make onion rings which were awesome.

Such a wonderful recipe!  I made this with halibut and it turned out great - Definitely restaurant quality fried fish! The only thing I noticed is the recipe says you should be able to see through the batter but when I did that, it was spotty.  I'd go for a little less beer than is called for in the recipe.

The batter is too thin. Two tablespoons of Paprika? Really? I also suggest using baking powder, since it makes it a little more crispy.

Thumbs down.

I've never made cod before, but hubby caught it by accident, so I hunted for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand.  I thought the proportion of the spices was perfect, other than I cut back on the salt, as I do with most recipes.  One important tip that several of the reviewers mentioned is to dip fish in flour before placing in the batter.  I read this the first time I used the recipe, but forgot about it the second time, and most of my batter was lost.  Thanks for sharing easy, tasty recipe!

Love Love Love, my husband and I loved this!  We used Coors Light but next time I will use a dark beer like Arrogant  to really bring out the beer flavor.  I thought, at first, the paprika would be overpowering because it turned the whole batter red.  Boy was I wrong!  We had 2 pounds of freshly caught Alaskan Halibut and ate like kings.

basic, good fried fish batter!  Would use it again.  I prefer something spicier, but this was more suited for my whole family.  Made a large quantity.

Fantastic!  I have been craving fried fish, but didn't want to pay for it.  I did not have paprika, so I used dill and garlic salt.  Per another review I let the batter sit for about an hour.  It was light and crispy, the batter stayed on.  The BEST fried fish I have ever made or ate.  Thank you, this will be a regular for me.

I followed the recipe but thought the batter was a bit runny so I added a little more flour.  It came out great.  Had plenty of batter left to make onion rings also and they came out great too.  I will use this recipe again in the future!

These were very good.....my fish fllets were a little bony and maybe not the best choice but the batter turned out fab.  I loved the beer in there too.  We used ours in fish tacos with sauce and cabbage.  Yummy!

This was Great! I followed a few other reviews and made onion rings with the left over batter and they tasted better than the fish, however I'm not a huge fan of cod so that might have been it, however great recipe! The only thing I did was do double dip the fish in the batter then plain flour and back in the batter for a thicker coat, maybe I won't add as much beer next time.

To thicken batter, add an additional 1/2 c flour and seasonings. *Garlic salt was substituted for garlic powder and salt.

I made this recipe with fresh smallmouth bass caught on a fishing trip. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I made it twice in one week. I was even asked for the recipe. Great with a squeeze of lemon juice and/or tartar sauce.

Thought this was an excellent recipe. My family loved it. I followed some of the advice. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and I coated the fish with flour before I dipped it in the batter. Thanks for this one.

Awesome...I also floured the fish beforehand and added some bay seasoning and took away some of the paprika...very good.

This did not work for me.  I got better results just by dipping the fish in flour then in an egg and again in flour mixed with seasoned cornmeal which I added pepper, obay, garlic and seasoned salt.

I started making this recipe and realized how much salt and spices it had.  I started all over and only put 1 teaspoon of the spices.  I can't imagine if I would have used how much was called for.  The fish turns out a really pretty golden brown.  The taste was pretty good.  You have to use the flour in order to make the batter stick.  I think you could probably use less beer.

My fish turned out great! I did however change up the recipe a bit because there were a few things that were a bit off in my opinion.  I noticed that the amount of spices was a little heavy handed. I reduced the paprika and garlic powder to 1 tablespoon, and only added 1 teaspoon of salt to the batter. I lightly salted my fish before dipping into the batter, and it came out perfectly seasoned! I know it's a beer battered fish, but I didn't have it on hand so I substituted water + a teaspoon of baking powder. I added a bit more flour because I like a thicker batter. If I'm going to make something deep fried, it better be worth it! Good base recipe, but it's open for a tweak here and there.

this was a great batter! I used it on Walleye and it turned out wonderful. I took someone else's idea and used some of the extra for some onion rings. YUM! I made as directed except added a little extra seasoning. I'll experiment with other things. What else can you batter. LOL

This was absolutely great.  My family loved it though I thought the batter was a little thin.  The only problem is that we ran out of fish..very good.  I will use again.

It has great flavor, I had problems with the batter falling off. I solved this by rolling the battered fish in meal before cooking. Very yummy!!!

I liked this recipe, but I don't know that it was fantastic. After reading other's reviews, I got nervous about making it too salty. I only added a little salt and that was not enough- at all. I will try this recipe again, but use the amount of salt originally called for. I did double the amount of flour, but not the seasoning because I was making over 30 fillets of various sizes. I used fresh red and white snapper that my husband caught on vacation in Florida. I also refrigerated the batter like suggested in other reviews. I also did not add the whole 24 oz. of beer (remember I doubled). I had just enough batter for 35 various sized fillets.

Loved this recipe, but I tweeked it. I use Codfish, nice 1 1/2" thick pieces. I doubled up on the recipe. For 2 LBS. of cod, I use for the batter, 2 cups of flour, 2 eggs, 2 bottles of 12 ounce lager beer and 5 TBLS of old bay. For the fish, I pay dry, and season lightly with salt, pepper and GARLIC POWDER, not garlic salt.  The key to this is to make sure the batter and the fish are at room temperature when you are ready to deep fry. I also fry at 375 a few pieces at a time. This is key to get a crispy fish. This is a very flavorful recipe, the key to it is Old Bay and lager beer.

Made this for halibut fish and tofu "fish" and chips. I cut the salt to about 1/2 tsp. Fried to a very pretty golden brown and had a good crispness to it. Was a little unexciting though.

This worked well for my first time doing fish and chips. I used Guiness as the beer, so the fish seemed to brown immediately as the batter was a brown color. I was worried it was going it was burning, but turned out fine just was dark. Definitely think you could cut the salt in half and not sacrifice any flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Awesome batter recipe!!  Used the remaining batter to make fried pickles and my daughter raved that they were restaurant quality!!  That is a great compliment.  I cut out ALL of the salt in this recipe and substituted Mrs. Dash No Salt original blend...tasted great!  Highly recommended for ANYthing calling for batter!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was absolutely fabulous texture and taste!  Next time, I will reduce the salt next time; we all agreed that it was a bit salty, but we still ate all but one piece and loved it.   Even my spouse liked it, and he dislikes seafood for the most part.   The leftover piece I heated in the toaster oven and it was as crispy and tasty as when I originally deep fried the pieces.

Very satisfying and so easy! Used spices mentioned + Old Bay, from user suggestion. Cut out the beer/flour and used whipped eggs/crushed saltines instead-I highly recommend it. The saltines create a crunchy texture and very little waste, compared to using flour for the batter/dredging.

We have a favorite Irish pub that just has the lightest beer battered fish that we just crave.  Now we know how they do it!  The hub made it and did coat the filets with flour first.  He thought next time he'd add a little flour to the batter, also.  I think it just "felt" wrong to him with it being so thin but the finished product says, "Don't do it!"  He cut the salt down to 1 t. per other reviews.  It was then pan fried it Smart Balance.  SO delicate and delicious!  Thank you very much!

I made chicken nuggets and onion rings with this batter and was not pleased with the flavor.  Stick with fish. The batter is very light and airy.  Flavor is a little bland.  The chicken nuggets need a crunchier texture then this recipe provides.  I think that using an egg white instead of the yolk could cut down on the greasiness of this recipe.  The flour helps keep the batter on and it has the perfect texture for fish. It is worth trying this recipe out.

Omitted the paprika, garlic powder and used lemon pepper instead. Also omitted the egg, and used self rising flour since that is what I had on hand. Really good recipe. Wonder if I can bake instead of frying? Think it would be healthier even though I used smart balance 3 blend omega oil. Still kinda greasy will try baking next time.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did what other reviewers mentioned and reduced the amount of salt.  I also did the dip in flour before the batter.  There was left over batter so I added some heat to make it spicier and sliced some red peppers and dipped them in the batter and fried them.  They turned out very tasty, almost better then the fish.  I will definetly be using this recipe again.

I only gave 4 stars because I changed the recipe a little. Cut down the salt and paprika. Add Old Bay seasoning. I just added 1/2 bottle of beer and added 1/2 cup of milk. I mixed all the dry ingredients first and then add an egg, lastly with beer and milk. I mixed them well and let the cod sit in the batter for 10 minutes. The fish came out beautifully fried. Just like restaurant quality.

A decent basic batter reipe but too thin for my taste. Did a test batch according to the original recipe and I did not care for it.  I made another batch omitting the garlic, cutting the salt and pepper to one teaspoon each and added a half cup of flour.

Best batter I've used.  I prefer a corn meal batter so I substitued that.  I also used egg white and cayenne pepper.  Super crispy, yummy batter

I chose this recipe because my boxed beer batter mix was too low for dinner. I was happy that it stuck to the fish nicely and browned up well. But when the fish was served, the batter would come off easily, and it definitely had more of a flour-y taste... not so tasty with fish. Next time, I will use a recipe that requires cornmeal instead. But thanks anyway!

This would have been pretty good but I used a bottle of Guiness from a friend's advice.  too dark and beer tasting for my family's liking.  Oh well I will rate again after trying with a different beer.

Although the fish fried great and looked really good, I found it to have an odd taste.  Almost too salty.  I don't know if it had to do with adding lemon pepper instead of regular pepper to batter or using Bud Light.

Excellent batter! I didn't even use any salt and it turned out great! Made it with cod. Paprika really gives it a kick.

We loved this batter on the cod however it didn't get crispy enough for us.  Next time I will try cooking it longer.  Recoating and refrying was a definite failure because the coating all fell off. The paprika really made it!

We made this with sturgeon caught yesterday. It was awesome! I did not read the reviews first and followed the recipe exactly except using egg substitute. The flavor and texture is perfect. Next time I will dredge the fish with flour first to get the batter to stick better and use a little less salt, just because it didn't need it. Thanks!!

I thought this recipe was great!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and didn't use as much salt and coated them with flour before dipping them in the batter.  I also didn't fry them in a fryer.  I just put about an inch of oil in a large skillet and cooked the fish over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side.  Fantastic!  This was the first time I had made fish and chips and I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Cut everything in half. Used Alaskan Halibut. Just a pinch of salt and listened to the comments for adding the flour before going into the batter. Call this Ratouille. Thanks

I was very skeptical having not ever tried this beer batter fish. let alone cooking it myself, but I will say, it was great! My fiance and son enjoyed it, and we had enough left over for fish sandwiches the next day. Next time (very soon) I will add more seasoning to the fish first.

This was great... I used white bass instead of cod. I used Corona beer and coconut flour, and it was great!!! After frying them I put them on rolls, smothered them with mayonaise and it was incredible!!!! They were great alone too, I just love them on rolls with mayo.

First time I've ever tried cooking with beer.  The batter cooked well over the fish.  But I find it a bit flavourful.  Well, that may be good for some but I found it a bit too much paprika and ground pepper.  It stuck to the fish well and cooked well without any raw batter underneath.

This was a good recipe, but a little too saltly and pepper-y (is that a word?).  Next time I will use less.  I suggest reducing both and allowing the beer batter and fish taste to be more prominent. Also, I used an "ale" beer, and it had just the right flavor (other than the salt and pepper).

I used this batter for shrimp and oysters. It was great. This has lots of flavor--all of the other beer batters we have tried were a little bland. It also comes out a very attractive color due to the paprika.

This recipe is excellent. I did, however, modify a little. I had no paprika so I substituted with Old Bay seasoning. Other than that, I loved it and so did the family and friends. I will definitely use it again.

Easy and tasty.  Made just as recipe decribes.  First time I made fried fish that everyone in my family enjoyed.  Thanks!

The overwhelming-salty flavor overpoweres the beer -- and the fish for that matter. Perhaps, some of the spices recommendations by other reviewers would give this dish the flavor it is sorely lacking.

My boyfriend and I loved the way the fish came out!  It was tasty and not soggy at all.  I took the recommendation to coat the fish in flour before dipping in batter and it came out great.  Thanks!!

My kids are such picky eaters, I wasn't sure how they'd take to it since the batter did smell a bit funny before frying it.  But they loved it and asked for seconds!!!  Excellent beer batter!

This just didn't work for me.  I dusted my filets with flour but the batter still slid off in the fryer.  The flavor of the fried bits that fell off was good, therefore the 2 star rating as opposed to 1 star.

I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more flavor to this recipe. It was easy to make but I will either look for a new recipe or seriously doctor this one up. Sorry.
