I didn't bother with the garlic salt, just marinated and grilled.  Delish!

This was delicious!  My husband and I scarfed it down and didn't have to add any salt or seasonings.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect just the way it was! Make sure to baste the eggplant with the marinade throughout grilling.  Thanks!

I love eggplant and balsamic but I didn't like them together. However, hubs really liked it so it's a 4. I made this as written without the optional fish sauce. Several reviewers said that they found it too salty and I wonder if a step is missing in the recipe as it should be rinsed and dried before marinating. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't use the fish sauce, but the result was still really good. This is my go-to marinade now for both eggplant and zucchini (I quarter the zucchini lengthwise into spears). My husband now actually likes to grill veggies!

Followed exactly including the fish sauce and thought it was great. I probably used a little less of everything because my wife isn't crazy about balsamic vinegar but it was really tasty!

One of my favorites! So easy and delicious. Brought this to a work pot luck and turned so many people on to eggplant.

Followed recipe completely. My husband and I love eggplant and balsamic vinegar so I was sure we would like this, but we did not. The balsamic flavor was too strong for one thing, but I am not sure that was the whole problem.

I made it as per instructions. However, I used my George Foreman grill. Quick and easy cleanup. They came out kinda crunchy. Yum

This was great. My husband who hates eggplant really enjoyed this. He asks for it. This was great, but made some changes.  First, instead of the eggplant, i substituted ground beef. Then instead of olive oil i used some taco seasoning and served it in cute taco shells...It was amazing.

Followed recipe as written, eggplant was dry and tasted very salty. Will not make this again. The salt took too much water out of the eggplant and made if very dry.

Perfect! I salted it and added  the ingredients to the marinade, didn't even wait to let it sit before pan grilling it. Added grilled peppers and tomatoes.

We enjoyed this and even our kids said it was good!  We followed the directions and grilled it. A good way to use eggplant!
