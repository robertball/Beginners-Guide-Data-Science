These have a great flavor and are so easy to make!  The texture is more like a muffin.  The only change is that I added some of the 'Everything' seasoning to the batter before filling the muffin pan to give it more flavor.

These are what used to be called 'plain muffins' but with the everything seasoning added on top. They rose and baked up fine but the taste was nothing special. My advice is to dab only a small amount of the egg wash on top of the batter, using your fingertips, rather than trying to brush it on. The egg wash was thick enough that blobs of it fell into the muffin tin cups. I removed as much as I could and stored the remaining wash in a closed glass jar in the refrigerator, then used it next time as part of a quiche. I appreciate the contributor posting this for others to share but it was not worth the effort to have only 5 muffins.

A bit more like biscuits than dinner roles, but easy and tasty.
