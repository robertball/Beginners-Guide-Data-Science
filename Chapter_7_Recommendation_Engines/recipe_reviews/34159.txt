One way to avoid a soggy crust is to bake the chicken on a rack.  Take the rack out of a roasting pan or use a self standing a cooling rack.  Set it on top of or inside (depending on whether or not is is a standing rack) the pan you're cooking the chicken on.  Lay the chicken on the rack.  Air will circulate under the chicken and the bottom will not be soggy.

We love spicey food, (including the kids) so this recipe was right on target for us. I didn't have any buttermilk in the house, so I used ranch dressing. The flavor was great, so the next time I make this I'll use the dressing again. To help keep the coating on the chicken, you need to let it set. After breading, place the chicken in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I took the advice of another reviewer and placed the chicken on racks to help keep the bottom crispy. We really loved this! Thank you!

I make this all the time so glad I found it and tried it. IT'S A KEEPER!!! My family and I love it. I dip the chicken in egg before dredging in dry mixture, coating sticks to chicken better also makes thicker and crisper crust. Also tried bone in cut up chicken  pieces done the same way just bake longer until juices run clear. Thank you Anna

Wow, talk about a GREAT recipe!!! I didn't marinate the chicken in the buttermilk mixture. (I didn't have time) So, I just put some of the hot sauce (Chicken wing hot sauce is what I used) in a little bowl, and rolled the chciken in it till it was coated in the sauce before I coated it with the flour/bread crumb mixture. Also, I used vegetable oil instead of Olive Oil to pan fry it, because Olive Oil has that strong flavour, and I didn't want the chicken to tast like that. Anyway, SOOO yummy and crispy! Not at all greasy either. Deffinetly will be making this again!

This recipe was a winner at out house!

I refrigerated the chicken after breading as another reviewer suggested.  If you still are having trouble making your breading stick, you may not be getting your frying pan hot enough before you put your chicken breasts in.

I turned my chicken breasts over halfway through the baking time, so both sides would be crispy.

The chicken came out very juicy and tender, and the crust was delicious.  I'm going to kick up the hot sauce and cayenne next time I make this.

Very yummy.  I used Frank's hot sauce with this recipe.  I took the advice of Linda McLean and let the chicken sit in the fridge after I coated it with the breadcrumbs, and they cooked perfectly.  I skipped the oven part and just browned these in a little canola oil.  You could taste the hot sauce in the chicken...I guess it soaked up the flavor and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing Anna.

This recipe was an excellent combination of flavors. I will make this one again. I did add an egg to the mixture so that the bread crumbs would stick better and it worked out very well.

Love the idea of this but it needs a lot more spice (heat and flavour). I didn't shallow fry before baking. Just put the chicken pieces on a roasting tray and sprayed all sides with olive oil. It turned out lovely, crisp and moist but just not enough flavour.

this was my first attempt at fried chicken, i made it last night.  i used drumsticks instead of breasts and it was very good.  kind of spicy, but not overwhelmingly so.  i thought the crust could've used more salt though.

What a great way to prepare chicken! I'm a diabetic so we used whole wheat stone ground flour in lieu of the all purpose white flour and splenda in lieu of the white sugar. We also used Panko bread crumbs. We, also, followed others who suggested dipping  the marinated chicken in egg prior to applying the breading mixture. This really worked for keeping the breading on the chicken as it browned. It is also important to not disturb the chicken as it browns and to use a spatula to turn the chicken over. Lastly, we topped each browned chicken filet with Parmesan cheese prior to baking and used a rack to bake the chicken on. The chicken turned out very crisp and flavorful. Thank you for sharing a great recipe. This is going to be a "regular" on our family's dinner table.

I didn't bother browning the chicken in the olive oil.  Instead, I just placed the chicken on my preheated pizza stone and it turned out great.  I've found using the pizza stone for alot of chicken recipes keeps the chicken moist and outside quite crispy.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I added a little more cayenne pepper and used Frank's Hot Sauce and it came out delicious!!!  I made sure the oil was very hot before I put the chicken in the pan and I didn't have a problem with the breading falling off. I will definately make this one again!

Just made this.  I didn't have any bread crumbs for the first time in 10 years so I used crushed corn flakes.   I also used a whole chicken that I cut up and skinned.  I split the browning part up into two batches to not crowd the pan.  I used about two tablespoons of olive oil for the first batch....not enough and the pan was not hot enough.  Half the batter fell off.  I upped the heat and oil for the 2nd batch and it seemed to work much better.  The problem was that wherever I tried to touch the chicken the batter fell off.  It still came out delicious.  I'm going to half to try this a few times to get the batter sticking issue fixed.  I may try an egg or two the next time around.    I have a question for anyone to answer:  Does anyone else freeze the marinade and bread crumb mix for the next batch?  I've been doing that for years and haven't had a problem.  If I had raw meet in it I put the expiration date the same as I would for whatever meat I marinaded in it.

Fabulous!  I don't even usually like meat, but I was fantasizing about the leftovers all the next day only to come home to find my brother eating the last piece!  Great spice and delicious crust.  The advice about baking in a rack is completely vital to preventing a soggy crust.

This is such a tasty dish!  I made a few changes:  I did not marinate the chicken with the buttermilk and hot sauce.  I simply covered the chicken in the hot sauce and then dredged it in the breadcrumb/spice mixture.  I refrigerated it for 30min, browned it according to the directions,  and then baked it on a rack to help the breading stay on the chicken.  I like spice so I used 3tsp cayenne instead of 1/2tsp.  It was perfect!

Thought the recipe was very good even though I changed it up a bit.  Save yourselves a step and DON"T fry the chicken.  Simply drizzle the olive oil on the chicken and bake.  This saves alot of time.  Thanks for a good oven fried chicken recipe.

I used this recipe more as a guide than anything. I didn't soak my chicken in the buttermilk, i didn't use the hot sauce, onion powder, sugar, garlic salt, salt, paprika, or cayenne pepper. Instead of all those spices I used 1 heaping tablespoon of Cajun seasoning. I know... I pretty much ended up with a totally different product, but it was delicious!!

I knew this was going to be good before i even tasted it. I too used ranch dressing instead of the buttermilk and i think this is probably the BEST chicken i have ever tasted. And i truly mean it! The spices were beautiful without being too overpowering and the chicken was lovely and moist. Took other suggestions of baking on a wire rack. I used chicken tenderloins to make chicken strips and served it with Honey Mustard Dressing from this site... divine!!!

Kind of time-consuming to make, but the end result is really yummy.  Based on other reviews, I refrigerated the breaded chicken for 30 minutes before frying in very hot oil, and it worked like a charm, I lost very little of the breading.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs (had on hand), otherwise followed recipe exactly, and served the chicken over plain pasta with a little marinara on the side.  It definitely has some heat, but it's pretty low-key.  I was worried about the hot sauce making it too vinegary, but that wasn't a problem.

Doubled crumb mixture.  Dipped chicken in beaten egg with a bit of buttermilk/hot sauce mixture added, crumb mixture and then let pieces rest before re-coating.  Let coated chicken pieces rest on wire rack in a pan for a few minutes before spraying liberally with olive oil.  Baked in 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes, turning halfway through.

This turned out so much better than I thought it would! The spice was perfect. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the chicken on a rack to keep it from getting soggy. Also fried the chicken in vegetable oil instead of olive oil because it was all I had. The chicken was tender and moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside! Great!

Very tasty!  Only complaint is the breading comes off the chicken when flipped and removed from baking dish.  Will dip in egg and then breading mix next time around to help the breading stick to the chicken.

My family liked it. I only marinated for 1/2 hours and I skipped frying it in olive oil. Instead, I sprayed it with butter-flavored Pam and baked it on a rack as suggested by others. Will make again. In fact, son has requested recipe to give to his girlfriend

I made this with drumsticks instead of chicken breasts and the result was great!  This dish goes great paired with the Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes and the Green Bean Bundles of Joy from this site.

My husband and I love spicy food so I thought this would be a winner. It is an awful lot of work for something that tastes so bland. My 15 month old baby even ate it. Definetly refrigerate the chicken with the coating on to prevent it from all falling off and use the rack in the oven or it will be a big soggy mess on the bottom. I will not make this again.

The coating was good, but the marinade didn't add a good flavor.  I used tabasco, and it didn't make the chicken spicy, it just gave it an unfavorable flavor...

Delicous!! even though I changed it a little. Instead of breadcrumbs I used Ritz crackers since its all I had. I made this with chicken breast & cut them into strips and just Fried them in a some oil.. enough to coat the bottom of the pan well.. I dont suggest frying it with big pieces If you use Ritz crackers  since cracker-crumbs darken fast. I used chili powder in place of the paprika since i was out..  and I only used a pinch of cayenne. My picky kids LOVED it! Thank you Anna!

My husband loved this chicken and thought I should rate it a 5.  He asked to make it 2 days in a row!  The flavor is very good, and the chicken is tender.  Very easy to make.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the breading does not stick.  But I will definitely make it again.  I used panko bread crumbs, and since I didn't have buttermilk I subbed ranch dressing.  Other than that I followed the recipe.

I made this exactly as written as far as the ingredients, but did take other reviewers' advice and used a roasting rack to prevent the chicken from getting soggy. My chicken came out nice and crispy w/ no sogginess. Great recipe overall, though perhaps a bit too salty. I think in future I will use garlic powder rather than garlic salt and same w/ the onion salt. Or, possibly just omit the regular salt.  The chicken was juicy and the topping crispy and spicy. Thanks Anna!

I cut up a whole chicken and needed 2x the coating mixture to cover everything.  I skipped the frying step, sprayed the pieces with butter flavored cooking spray, baked them on a cooking rack, turned them over halfway through to crisp up the bottom.  It was really good.  Very moist and flavorful meat and the coating was crisp and delicious.  It was better than fried chicken, so much less mess and EASY!

This was really good! I used Tabasco for the hot sauce, but if I made it again I would try something different, maybe Frank's or even a buffalo style sauce.

This chicken was wonderful!  It wasn't super-spicy, just hot enough to bring the flavors of the hot sauce and cayenne out.  I've already made this several times and my family really enjoys it.

This was a winner. I'll make this again.

Because I normally brine chicken, I didn't find the overnight marinade troublesome. I used a chili sauce (Heaven and Earth brand Dragon Fire Sauce) instead of Tabasco and the chicken had great flavor. 

I didn't use the egg dip but my breading stayed on well. I think the secret is to get the pan very hot first, then add oil which will almost immediately be ready for the chicken. Then do not disturb the chicken pieces until the bottom is browned; turn over with tongs. (Of course this method means you cannot use a non-stick pan  because it is dangerous to heat them empty.)

After reading all the great reviews, I have to say I was really disappointed. The chicken didn't get crunchy at all. The flavor was also not the zip I was looking for. I'm no fan of "bird" anyway so it really has to snap to get my attention. Even my husband who does love chicken wasn't overly impressed. I doubt if I make this again.

The taste was fabulous!  My 7 year old said I made the best chicken in the world! It wasn't hot at all.  I used Frank's hot sauce.  HOWEVER--I'm rating it 4 because of the breading, it wouldn't stick.  I used a rack, but because of the steam between the chicken and pan it still fell off on one side.  But the smaller chicken tender-sized pieces had no such problems.  Next time I'll use chicken tenders, or try rolling it in an egg, or using more flour/less bread crumbs.

My family loved this recipe.  I was only able to marinate for 4 hrs (I think that cut down on the heat from the hot sauce).  I did like the other reviews, placed chicken on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet to bake and the breading stayed was crispy.

I don't like spicey, but this worked because even the amount of spice called for was not even too much for me.  I made it when I was pregnant and really wanting fried chicken and this sufficed though it wasn't anything too special.

I wish I had pounded the breasts thin, but did not. I also did not use enough hot pepper sauce in the marinade. I used the seasoned flour, a beaten egg and panko crumbs and rested the coated chicken in the fridge for awhile. I browned the chicken in a mixture of butter and olive oil. I used cookie rack in the pan to raise the chicken and avoid soggy bottoms. It was tasty!

Great recipe!  I fried the chicken for 2-3mins on each side, then baked it until done.  The outer crunchy coating came off when I plated the chicken but was crisp like traditional fried chicken.  Tastes great leftover too!

Pretty good....I used boneless chicken tenders and made my own buttermilk with fat free milk and white vinegar. I totally eliminated the "frying" step and went right to baking them. Brushed with a little olive oil first. Not super crispy but then again I did not fry them, tried to go healthier. Yummy non-the less. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I left my chicken to soak in the buttermilk overnight and after coatong my chicken I put it in the fridge to set for 1/2 hour or so. I would like to try again with thigh meat to see how that comes out.

This recipe is fabulous when it's baked on a raised rack, rather than the more complicated (and less healthy) original way. It's a major hit in my household, especially when I substitute our home-grown and -dried insanely hot crushed pepper flakes for the cayenne pepper. I've also tried several hot sauces for the buttermilk marinade and my family likes the BW3 Wild sauce best. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this a few times but never use any flour or cornstarch like the recipe says. I was out of buttermilk and the store i went to didnt have any so i got ranch like i read in another review and used it instead. It came out even more flavorful than the buttermilk! I also use 2 Tablespoons of cayenne pepper instead of 1 teaspoon. its always full of flavor and spicy. Its my sister in laws favorite chicken now and shes a really good mexican cook.

This recipe turned out well for us.I used Trader Joe's Chipotle Habanero Pepper Sauce, and only approx. 15 drops of it (stuff will melt your tongue!) I mistakenly added dried basil to the mix (thought it was the cracked black pepper at first) and I decided to omit the cayenne. I added more garlic flavor (granulated) and went heavy on the paprika. Took Lin's advice from the reviews and let the prepared chicken rest for awhile (maybe 30 minutes) before frying, and had no probs with the coating falling off. I only baked them for about 20 min. ~ chicken was very juicy and flavorful,the breading was delicious and we'll definitely be making this one again. Thanks AnnaG!

Delicious with just enough heat. After reading other reviews, I was concerned about the breading falling off. I flattened the chicken breast for more even cooking, cut the large breasts into 2 pieces and I used extra oil each time I added the chicken to the pan. I cooked it on a little higher heat (Our gas cooktop seems to cook hotter than electric) for only 2-3 minutes each side - the crust was very brown. I used tongs instead of a fork to flip and remove the chicken and I didn't lose any breading. It was great, thanks!

EXCELLENT new chicken recipe! Although you have to plan ahead to let the chicken hang out in the buttermilk, it is well-worth the wait! Delicious and easy! ...to give to a friend that just had a baby, I prepared up to putting in the oven and gave them the instructions for baking. I eased up on the cayenne to make them kid-friendly for that batch, but otherwise it has a great kick! Will make again and again!!

I skipped the cayenne pepper since I didn't have any. I ended up using about 2 Tbsp of olive oil per 2 chicken breasts. I did keep the chicken cool before frying and baked it on a rack over a cookie sheet.

The resulting chicken was good, but I still had a problem with the breading staying on the chicken. It mostly stayed on. Not sure if I'll try it again.

This is a very good recipe.  I used thighs instead of breasts and it turned out great.  I love a good, crispy coating and this was just the ticket.  Will make again.

Spicy oven fried chicken at its best! I took the tips/advice from other reviewers:  1. dip the chicken in egg before breading  2. refrigerate breaded chicken for 30 min. before pan frying to allow it to set 3. used cookie sheet & baking rack in the oven to keep it crispy.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt & cut the sugar.  The chicken was crispy, moist, & had just enough spicy.  we loved it! great recipe!

I'm not a fan of super spicy food but this has a great balance of flavor and spice. I made this for Chicken BLT Salad with Ranch dressing and it was delicious! Somehow I ended up forgetting to cook the chicken in the skillet before baking (next time I will try not to forget) and it still turned out fine. I turned the broiler on for about 2 mins to make sure the breading was still crispy.

The flavor was great and the chicken was moist.  My only complaint is the breading turned mushy in the oven.  I wish I had just finished frying it in the pan.  After reading some of the reviews, I will give this another shot using a rack.  Not ready to give up on it yet because I really liked the flavor.

Delicious! Baked on a cooling rack set in a baking sheet to avoid the chicken getting soggy underneath.

I wish I could pick simpler recipes...but it was delicious. I did my own thing again...I used a whole chicken, ended up being around 14 good sized pieces sort of like KFC. I doubled the recipe but for the marinade used 1 cup milk made into buttermilk with 1 TB lemon, 1/2 c ranch( great idea!), 1/4 c hot sauce...extra marinade really isn't necessary. Only had 3/4 c bread crumbs so made up for the rest with crushed corn chips, needed about 2 1/4 c for a 3 lb chicken. Strangely even though I was cooking chicken with bone in, not breasts, it was done at 35 min at 400. I followed the spice mixture...so very good.

I'm on the fence about this one.  I made exactly as stated just used bone in chicken instead.  I was thinking I could skip the browning in the pan step, but wanted to make it the first time as written.  I think next time I will skip that step and throw it in the oven.  I did have some problems with the breading, but I think it was all the handling of the chicken from frying pan to the oven pan.  I did not find it to spicy- just a hint.  I used tabasco in the buttermilk mixture.  You could taste it, but not the heat of it.  My kids ate it no problem.  I would probably give this 3.5 stars.  Thanks for sharing.

Even though my whole family love it, I don't think I'll make it again. It seemed like it took forever to make, with frying first and then baking. Also the coating didn't stick too good and it was very messy to make. I have a similar recipe that is just baked and it's much quicker and coats better. However it did taste good, just not worth the hassle.

My husband described this as spicy and creamy. Very moist. Could certainly use more cayenne, like 1 teaspoon. Used my own toasted whole wheat breadcrumbs, did the egg dip and baked on a wire rack, and it looked just like Sarah Jane's pic.

I liked it a lot, I messed up a little though. I used garlic SALT instead of garlic powder and it came out way too salty. I think it will be delicious when I do it again the "right" way. I used skinnless, boneless chicken breasts sliced in half to make 2 thin flat pieces. This worked well, no pounding required.

This was pretty good. I wouldn't say "the best". It was very, very tender due to the marinating. (I let mine marinate for a day 1/2) If you like spicy - I would suggest adding even more cayenne! My boyfriend said this was the best chicken he ever had. But I think he was REALLY hungry. ;-)

Like so many other reviews, the breading just wouldn't stay on. We dipped it in bread and tried not to move it much while browning, but it just fell apart. The flavor was only ok and they were not good at all leftover.

This recipe was just ok.  It's was nice and spicy for most adults but the kids thought it was too spicy.  You could easily adjust that.  It just seemed to take a lot of work for not much reward.  Will keep looking.

Wow, this really is terrific, moist, perfectly spiced chicken. I used panko bread crumbs and they worked great. I also egg-dipped the chicken before rolling it in the bread crumb mixture and didn't have any trouble with the coating falling off. Great recipe! I will make this again!

I made this tonight and it is REALLY good! My husband had some friends over and they really liked it. I'm giving it only 4 stars b/c I had a hard time with the breading staying on. Next time I will coat in egg before adding the dry mixture. It's a keeper! Thanks.

I cook for 4 college football players, this was a bit hit with them, asked for a repeat. the only thing i did differently, is to add a handful or so of grated parmesean cheese to the breading mixture before coating. soaking in buttermilk overnight makes the chicken very moist and delicious. this is a keeper..

My husband and I both loved this recipe. He said it was his favorite chicken he's ever had! Very moist and spicy.

The only changes I made was I used pounded split breasts to decrease the oven time. I didn't have any trouble with the coating sticking, but I did use a fork instead of a spatula to flip which may have helped. I baked it on a rack as well so both sides were nice and crispy. Yum!

This was really tasty!  I halved the amount of hot sauce (as I don't eat things too spicy) and it still had a good kick.  Satisfied our craving for fried chicken without all the grease!

This recipe was very good and had a wonderful spicy flavor but the problem was that my coating all fell off in the pan.  It did not stay on the chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to keep the coating on I'd love to hear them as the flavor was wonderful but not sure I'd make it again due to the coating not staying on.

We loved this spicy hot chicken recipe. I doubled it for the 5 of us using 8 breasts & there were no leftovers.  The recipe didn't say whether to cover the chicken or not during baking so I did it both ways and it was much better covered with foil.  It tasted more like sauteed chicken.  Uncovered was crispier & more like fried chicken. 
I will definitely be making this on a regular basis...thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved loved loved this one! We love it hot...it didn't affect us too much, because we burned off our taste buds long ago..hehe. But we really loved it. My grandfather, however, was sweating by the time he was done! AWESOME for adults...but I don't think many kids will enjoy the hotness.

I made the recipe as written.  I thought the flavor of the chicken was great.  It had just the right amount of spice.  The seasonings worked very well with the buttermilk/hot sauce base.  The only thing I was not completely happy with was the breading got a little soggy during the baking.  I was hoping by using a wire rack it would come out crispy, but it was not the case.  It was not completely soggy, but it was not crunch either.  We had some leftovers and it made awesome chicken salad.  I will be making it again.

It was okay.  I followed the raters' advice and let the breaded chicken sit.   I also put it in the oven on a rack.  The flavor was okay but the breading didn't stick as well as hoped.

The taste was okay.  I may make it again and play with it a bit, but overall was disappointed.

Used finely ground corn flakes rather than bread crumbs and I left out the sugar and added a bit more cayenne to turn up the heat a bit. Used Frank's Red Hot Original but a hotter sauce would kick heat up a notch. Large breasts which I cut in half to speed marinate (2 hr) and to give a better crumb coating to meat ratio and more flavor. Definitely bake on rack for a crispy finish. Served with homemade buffalo wing sauce and homemade bleu cheese dressing for dipping.

really good. although, think the game changer was using 1/2 c panko breadcrumbs in addition to a 1/2 c. regular breadcrumbs for crunch!

Really wonderful recipe!  I used buttermilk and some ranch dressing since I saw that one reviewer used ranch instead of the buttermilk.  I also let the skillet get good and hot before putting the chicken in it after reading some people had problems with the coating coming off.  It was a little tricky keeping the coating on, I must say.  But overall, definitely worth the challenge.

The coating mixture was delicious, and the chicken was tender and tasty! I had two minor issues with the recipe, though. One is that it didn't make sense to me to dirty both a frying pan and a baking dish. So I put the chicken breasts directly into a baking dish and sprayed them with oil, and was happy with how they browned. The other issue is simply that neither Mr. Pickypants nor I are "heat people." So I cut the hot sauce in half, and did not marinate the chicken in it. I don't know if it was the remaining hot sauce, the cayenne, or both, but these were still on the hot side for us. I will definitely make this recipe again, but will work on reducing the heat while retaining those flavors.

This was delish and a HUGE hit! I had chicken tenders on hand so I reduced cook times slightly. I took the advice of placing the chicken on a rack with a roasting pan (covered with foil for easy clean up)and the chicken came out perfect! It was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I actually placed the chicken in a roll to create a sandwich instead. My kids compared it to Chick-Fil-A, YUM!!! Thank you for the awesome recipe!!!!

These were fall off the bone good!  I used wings and hot sauce instead of pepper sauce.  Did not think they were spicy at all.  Used a combination of panko and italian bread crumbs.  Pan fried for probably less than a minute, placed on wire rack on cookie sheet and in oven for 25 min.  Followed others and let them set for 30 min in fridge before putting in skillet..no sogginess at all!  Made eggplant french fries to go along.

A tasty dish but I won't make it again. I think that I might have enjoyed it more without the hot spices.  Don't get me wrong, I'm from New Mexico and we love spicy foods, but  I feel the minimal heat somehow cancelled out the flavor of all the other spices.  The chicken was very tender  and moist.  I used a good quality Ranch dressing, as no buttermilk was available the day I wanted to make it.  The calories and fat from the doing it this way were not worth it in my opinion.   I don't doubt that it is a great dish for many people, but I'm going to look elsewhere for a similar dish that doesn't require any frying at all, and that uses panko bread crumbs, buttermilk and a mix of regular spices.

Would have given 5 stars for the flavor if the breading would stay on and the bottom would be crispy.  After browning (which took off quite a bit of the breading - will try Linda MClean's suggestion next time (used her ranch dressing suggestion); placed chicken on rack in oven, but the bottoms still came out soggy - and they were crisp from the browning when they went in!  Great flavor, tho, and will keep trying to find a solution.

This was OK but kind of bland as others have mentioned.  I skipped the pan frying as I figured that a lot of the bread crumb coating wold just fall off.  I used chicken breasts on the bone and had to cook it 1 hour 15 minutes.  Maybe seasoned bread crumbs would add more flavor.  I used panko bread crumbs for extra crunch but this recipe just wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting.

Is this ever good!  I halved the amount of cayenne and hot sauce.  I didn't have time to soak the chicken in the buttermilk/hot sauce for up to 8 hours - just 30 minutes but I also let the chicken set in the fridge for about 30 minutes after it was fully breaded.  The breading stayed on during the browning process and after it was out of the oven.  I used thighs and they cooked for just over an hour.  My hb and I feasted!!

Awesome! I add more cayenne pepper though as I like the heat to bump a bit more and sometimes I'll use panko instead of standard bread crumbs. I also make sure to let the breaded chicken set for a while before cooking to it's less likely to fall or crumble off during the initial pan frying or moving around. It still doesn't adhere to the chicken fully, but mostly good enough.
I'd actually give it a 4.5 star rating.

Dont get me wrong it was ok and ill make again, ill add more seasoning next time and i did not have a problem with the breading falling off.

I loved it...but my boyfriend thought it was a little to spicy. It was very hard to keep the breading on while frying. I did dip it in egg first and I used a spacula to flip it to try and keep the breading in tact.

Juicy and tasty chicken. The breading did fall off while I was browning the chicken, I tried to stick some of it back on... so while it didn't look all that pretty, it did taste good. I even dipped the breasts in egg before breading them, but oh well. I had planned on making this for my boyfriend and making something else for myself, since I can't take spicy food, but this wasn't too spicy for me at all. Also, I did bake these on a rack, so what little breading was left on them did crisp up all the way around. :)

This is really good.  I had to omit the garlic because I live with a vampire.  I used skin-on thighs and legs and I didn't brown them before baking.  I placed them on a rack, sprayed them with some canola oil spray, and baked them for almost an hour.  They were delicious.

I made this for my family and absolutely NOTHING was left. They are every bite and crumb. Even the 3 year old. I did like another commenter and used a cooling rack in my baking pan so that the chicken was crispy on all side. DEFINITELY will make this again!!

Swapped Italian style panko for bread crumbs. Followed advice and let coated breasts chill before cooking. Also used a rack to ensure crisp coating during baking.  Didn't pre-fry, and probably should have. Took almost an hour in the oven at 350. Will try again with pre-fry because the flavor is heavenly and if it works,  will upgrade to five stars. Definitely worth the effort!

Great recipe! Did chicken strips for the kids and half breasts pieces for my husband and I. Skipped the cooking on the stove. Used whole wheat panko breadcrumbs which are brown anyways...only took 18 min for small pieces. When chicken was on sale last I actually put the chicken and buttermilk and hot sauce in a freezer bag. Then 2 weeks later I pulled it out, as it defrosted the chicken marinated. Def recommend using cooling racks on top of foil or parchment paper on cookie sheets to get crisp "fried" yumminess. I also tend to do the breading of the chicken at least an hr before baking to make dinner time calmer and it always seems to help things stick...works with pork and fish too. Spray the racks with nonstick spray. Making this again soon.

Thank you for sharing your recipe with us. Unfortunately this dish was a mess for me. I was concerned that the hot sauce flavor would overpower the chicken, and based on that I decided to use half the recommended amount. I love spicy food, so my concern was about the flavor of the hot sauce, not the level of spiciness. Even with cutting the sauce in half, it overpowered the flavor of the chicken, and we did not enjoy the dish. The rest of it was great, so next time I will omit the hot sauce and perhaps increase the paprika and Cayanne pepper just a little bit.

Very tasty recipe. I made it as is the first time, then added more hot sauce and cayenne after that.

I didn't have time to marinate overnight so I did for a simple half hour. I also did not have buttermilk so I used ranch dressing, and I also doubled the amount of cayenne pepper.  It was done in 20 minutes after browning it in the oil first, and was incredibly moist and tasty.  Will def use again.

This is a great recipe! I added more cayenne pepper because we love spicy things but this was absolutely great! Oh and I blended bread crumbs in a ninja to get it really smooth and skipped frying the chicken in the skillet; just dipped it in an egg mixture, and then coated the chicken with the coating.

I made this twice. Used buttermilk, skillet smoking hot, and breading crumbled off chicken both times. Flavor was good though.

Listen to the other reviewers!  The key to making the coating stick is to put the coated chicken breasts in the fridge for at least 30 minutes prior to frying in oil.  Make sure the oil is hot prior to placing the chicken breasts in the pan.  I found that peanut oil works quite well.   My personal changes: When marinating the chicken, I used buttermilk mixed with Siracha sauce.  Spicy, but not overly so.  I also used panko bread crumbs which made a light crunchy coating

I added a bit more spice than the recipe because of our personal taste.  I also was looking to avoid the whole fry thing so I think the title is a bit deceiving.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and baked it on my pizza stone.  Overall, great concept and flavor, but I still had an issue with lack of crispiness.  I will try the egg dip before breading next time.

Very moist and flavorful.  As written though, the bottom of the ckn is soggy - thus a 3 star rating. 

ps:  If you're not a fan of buffalo wings, cut back on the hot sauce (the vinegar in it comes through in the flavor)

My family really enjoyed this chicken.  My suggestions for improvement would be to pound the chicken into thinner fillets and make sure you marinate the chicken in the buttermilk/hot sauce combo for the total 8 hours recommended.

I'm not into spicy, so I removed the hot sauce, cayenne and sugar, cut the paprika in half and added an extra half teaspoon of garlic. As was noted in the magazine article this recipe makes twice as much of the coating as necessary.

We all liked it, even the kids! Next time I may experiment a bit with the ingredients to give it a little more pop. I didn't have any issues with the breading staying on when I followed other user's suggestions and refrigerated the breaded chicken for half an hour before I fried it, and I used a roasting pan.

It was good, but rolling your chicken in a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese is even better and you skip every step except, dip in milk (any kind), dredge, bake.

Delicious!  Prepared it just as the recipe states- only slight variation was I used smoked paprika instead of regular.  I can see how the advice to let it sit in the fridge for 30 min. after breading would help as I had to be very careful so the coating wouldn't fall off.  But my family licked the platter clean!

This was overall a pretty good recipe. I don't like spice much so I had to substitute a little. If I were going to make this again I would definitely pan fry for a few minutes before the oven vs. spraying and baking on the rack; definitely would have been crispier.

I made this last night for our Breaking Bad finale dinner. I was hoping for a thick, crispy skin but this just didn't deliver. I think the best part of having "fried" chicken is the skin so I left the skin on which was a big mistake. A lot of the coating and skin came off in the pan when I was browning the chicken. I would have given it more stars because that's really my fault for not following the recipe exactly however, the chicken didn't have much flavor and I marinated it overnight.

Tried this last night and it was delicious! Best oven-baked chicken I've ever made! Will definitely be making again! Only marinated for 2 hours but still tasted great. Took the advice of others and cooked on a rack to keep the coating from getting soggy.

VERY YUMMY!! I also used Frank's hot sauce, it was the right amount of kick. If you're like me, you can increase the cayenne pepper for an extra spicy touch. I usually don't use measuring tools when I cook, so I added all the ingredients by visual scale; therefore, no matter how you make this recipe, you can't go wrong. I added oven baked fresh cut fries and biscuits to complete the meal.

So good!  Recommend baking with a wire rack on the baking sheet to avoid it getting soggy.  Otherwise breading flavor was so good and chicken was tender.
