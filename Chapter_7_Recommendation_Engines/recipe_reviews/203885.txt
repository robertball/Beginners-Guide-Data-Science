I baked them for around 20 minutes at 375, turning them over halfway through the baking time, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Served over pasta with the sauce and mozzarella for an easy and quick meal!

I put my zucchini slices in a bag with flour first so the egg would stick better. This was a tasty side dish.

I love these!  I made them several times.  The original recipe was also 5 stars but I did a couple of things different the last few times.  First, I didn't mix the parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs but sprinkled a little on top after frying.  Also I breaded a whole bunch at one time and put them on cookie sheets and stacked them up and froze them for a couple of hours and then put them in freezer bags for later use rather than breading them every time I want some.  I also use ranch dressing instead of spaghetti sauce and Mozzerella cheese.  They taste just like fried zucchini that I used to get at Coco's restaurant in Tucson.  Wonderful side dish.  UPDATE: I now use only panko bread crumbs.  I also add onion powder and some dried parsley to the bread crumbs.  I tried to dip them in flour prior to putting them in the egg as some have suggested, but then I had trouble getting the egg to stick to the zucchini.  The egg sticks to the zucchini just fine without the flour.

This was easy and just what I was in the mood for! I had one medium-size zuke so I cut the crumb mixture in half--1/4 c. each of bread crumbs and parm and 1/2 tsp. garlic salt. It still ended up being more than enough. I also used 1/4 c. olive oil for frying and it was perfect. I didn't serve them with sauce, but ate as a snack with the melted cheese and it was delicious!

I accidentally bought a cucumber instead of a zucchini. I still made the recipe. It was awesome. I think that is a testament to how good this recipe is, haha!

Great recipe! Didn't have much to grow up on so in order to simply eat these vegetables my mother would call these "fried green cookies" and it worked. Just without the parm and seasonings; flour, salt and pepper did the trick. I made this recipe AS IS but adding Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs and it is fantastic!! I did try the 'cover with flour' technique but usually when i do that i add cornstarch just to make it even more crispy. Still made it taste great! Plus my 2 yr old son wouldn't stop grabbing them off my plate. Definitely a permanent keeper for my book.

Good recipe.  I always sweat my zucchini with a sprinkle of salt and let them drain before frying.  And I find that using Crisco shortening is better for frying - veggies turn out lighter and crisper.

Boy was this good.  I love fried zucchini and only make it once a year.  I did not use the mozzarella cheese at the end, but the zucchini was still delicious.  Having the oil at the right temperature is important in this recipe...too hot, and it will burn quickly, not hot enough and the zucchini just sits and soaks up oil.  I used more oil and kept it at 350-375 degrees, frying just a few pieces at a time.  Can't wait for next year's zucchini crop to do this one again.

I haven't had much success with frying veggies before, but this time I hit the jackpot, though I did add a few steps.  I first sliced the zucchini into 1/4 inch slices and let them dry out on a paper towel on the counter for about a half hour.  I then coated them with flour mixed with salt and pepper.  Then I dipped them in the egg, flavoured with a little hot sauce.  I then mixed bread crumbs with fresh chopped parsley and cajun seasoning.  I then put them on a plate, single layer, and refridgerated them for about an hour or so.  I then fried them up about half a dozen slices at a time.  Once they were golden brown, I added just a touch more salt and pepper, while they were still hot.  I didn't have any cheese on hand or tomato sauce, but I can't see those ingredients adding anything but more yummy flavour!  These turned out amazing!  I can't wait to make this again and, next time, I will add the cheese and tomato sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I coated the zucchini in flour seasoned with garlic salt and onion powder, then dipped in egg/milk, and finally coated with fresh-made breadcrumbs and Italian seasonings.  A very tasty way to use up some of that surplus of summer squash.  Mmm!

I cant take complete credit for this suggestion-but, the recipe is much easier if you lay them out in a shallow baking dish and bake them-much more healthy!!

My husband brought home a zucchini from a friend at work, and said he wished he knew how to make fried zucchini like his grandmother used to make.  I decided to try this recipe...and WOW!  It is so close to his grandmother's.  I might have added a tad more garlic salt, but not much.  Very yummy.  We're going to keep this recipe!

We have so much zucchini in our garden, I've already made these 3 times so far this summer.  I tried the traditional frying the first time, but the oil kept getting so dirty (and didn't seem too hot) that it was very frustrating.  But, baking them as one of the other reviewers suggested, was perfect!  375 degrees for 20 min (flip halfway), was so good!  You can also get more done in the oven than in the frying pan; win-win all around!

I halved this recipe for a wonderful snack.  I dipped a few pieces of the zucchini in the egg and then shook in a plastic bag to coat with the bread crumb mix.

This recipe tasted wonderful. I made a few small adjustments by using frozen zucchini/squash and putting it with noodles and sauce.  While going through prepping everything... my husband and son (who hates veggies) would not stay out of the zucchini.   A+ in my book.  This is a keeper. THANKS!

This was really good.  I only made a couple of minor changes.  I used an eggplant (I didn't have zucchini) and instead of frying in oil I baked for 30 minutes at 375 (as another reviewer suggested).  I also used Ranch dip instead of the spaghetti sauce.  Will definitely make this again!

we had way too many zucchinis in our garden this year and some of them grew to the size of clubs.  So this recipe was perfect for them.  Great as a side afternoon snack or a meal.  Thanks for posting!

I've been meaning to try this for a week.  After a visit to the local farmer's market, I finally got around to try preparing this recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of zucchini, but wow, this was great and surprisingly  filling.  It could easily be a main course.  The presentation is nice also; I did add sprigs of fresh basil for color.    I also baked instead of frying.

Good, solid fried zucchini recipe. You don't even have to do the tomato sauce and cheese steps if you're just looking for fried zucchini. I was surprised I didn't need to dredge the zucchini in flour; I followed the recipe with the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese....it worked out really well.

I made this using panko that I seasoned with Italian seasoning.  I also cut back on the garlic salt and reduced the amount of oil, which worked out very well.    I served the spaghetti sauce on the side for dipping.

Excellent recipe for one of my favorite drive-thru snacks. We were given 4 very large zucchini so this was a great way to use it up. My family doesn't like zucchini very much but my girls enjoyed this with lots of cheesy sauciness. I added this to my recipe box, thanks!

Good, but a dusting of flour before the egg works better and helps to keep the breading on the zucchini while frying.

This is absolutely delicious. They really don't need the cheese and tomato sauce but they are good both ways.

Made this tonight and it was a hit with my kids! They asked when they could have it again! I only used 1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup parm with the garlic salt and then just 1 egg and that was plenty to cover my one zucchini that I sliced. I did not even add the mozzarella. And I served it with ranch dressing, salad, and meat lasagna. I will definitely make this again for the kids.

I loved this! I am lactose intolerant and left out the parmesan cheese and used very little mozarella. I also left out the garlic salt since the seasoned bread crumbs had enough salt and seasoning in it. Came out VERY delicious and I will be making this again. :o)

This is a little time consuming because the zuchinni has to be fried one layer at a time, but it is worth it.  Very crispy and tasty.

Great way to make zucchini!  Unfortunately I had to leave out the sauce because we're out, but it was still perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was an awesome idea for either an appetizer or a side dish.  I did not fry the zucchini, as I hate to add the extra fat.  Instead, I used seasoned Panko bread crumbs for the breading mix and added 1/2 tsp garlic salt & italian seasoning to the crumb mix.  I dunked the thinly sliced zucchini in egg, then the crumb mix & laid slices out flat on a baking sheet.  I baked the breaded slices in a convection toaster oven at 400 F for 8 minutes per side.  I did not add the mozzarella, as I did not think it needed it & I didn't want a soggy texture.  They were nice, golden & crispy & I served with a nice marinara...nobody used the marinara (they were delicious just plain).  Wonderful new addition to my recipe box...thx Kelli!!!
5/14/15 EDIT: I just made these again as described above, only used egg whites instead of egg & they were even lower fat with minimal change in flavor.  I served these with a creamy horseradish sauce & couldn't stop eating them...delicious combination of flavors...thx Kelli!!!

This is an excellent recipe! I have made it many times, but never tried frying it. I always bake it in the oven. But either way is fine because I will use the olive oil no matter what, if by using it to fry or spraying the cookie sheet with olive oil cooking spray.  But one idea hit me as I was beginning to make these again: instead of using as a possible side dish or snack, why not make it into a PANINI SANDWICH... Once you're  done cooking the zucchini, heat up ur Panini Press,   using the bread of your choice, layer some  of the fried zucchini on the bread, top the zucchini with the spaghetti sauce or even roasted red peppers  and then the mozerrella cheese then top that with other piece of bread. Spray the Pannini Press lightly with olive oil cooking spray (*Note: spray the Pannini press prior to heating). Once Press is heated, put Pannini sandwich on grill, put down other end of press on top of sandwich and grill it until cheese melts and sauce is heated through and to the doneness of how you like your bread... There you go! A nice Fried Zucchini Pannini Sandwich to serve as a meal for lunch using Kelli's recipe!!

Tried this recipe last night and it was outstanding!  I used yellow squash and zucchini and baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  Other than those changes, everything else was the same.  The squash was crispy and well seasoned.  Husband says it's a keeper.  Will definitely make again!  Kudos to Kelli.

This was just ok for me. I think some more spices would help. Also, I think I would make the slices a little thinner, otherwise they are still pretty hard after frying.

This was delicious. You just have to watch to get the perfect done-ness. Not so good if the zucchini is beginning to mush.

This is the closest I have found to the way they are served in a favorite restaurant. It is very good. I used zucchini from my garden that have a much higher moisture content. Next time I will try store bought zucchini.

I made it but didn't have mozz cheese, so substituted cheddar & monteray jack (combo) & others w/o cheese @ all, also didn't have any spaghetti sauce! So I'm sure it tasted a lot different than it was suppose to, but it was still good!

great appetizer that is easy to make.  I added a little Italian seasoning and parsley to the dry mix. I skipped the pasta sauce and served it with blue cheese salad dressing for dipping

Made exactly as written and loved it! My only issue was I threw all of the zucchini slices in a bag with the bread crumb mixture so they didn’t come out evenly coated. Next time I would do half at a time.

This is a simple and easy introduction to fried zucchini. I used Italian breadcrumbs, left out the mozzarella cheeze and used my homemade marinara as a dip. I didn't like the idea of sitting the zucchini in the sauce as I feared it might lose crispiness that way. I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely make again (I think I can do better next time).

Delish!! Made it twice in one week. First time added the parm to the bread crumbs, second time I did not. I liked it better the second time.

This is one of our favorites.  We grow zucchini and fry fresh.  I made a few modifications to the recipee.  First, instead of plain bread crumbs, use Panko Italian bread crumbs.  Next, coat with flower before dipping in egg mixture.  Lastly, instead of putting the mozzarella on in the pan, put it on after removing and when all slices are done, put in oven at 375 for a few minutes to melt.  This allows you to serve all slices warm.

I made it as directed except that I halved the recipe and I still had enough for one whole zucchini.  My hubby and I loved it!

I couldn't get bread crumbs to stick to zucchini! So, I'd like to try them again & maybe a good idea is to coat w flour first! Thank you whoever here mentioned that!!

left out the garlic salt and parmesan cheese.   Added smoky Cajun seasoning for a little kick.  fried in a little bit of olive oil.  did not use the mozzarella cheese or the tomato sauce.  they were tasty with the Cajun seasoning.

Wow, amazing!!  I'm not a huge fan of veggies, but who doesn't like something cheesy & fried?! This was easy, delicious, and I'll definitely make it again.  I used parmesan-flavored bread crumbs, and omitted the mozzarella cheese & spaghetti sauce at the end.  Instead, we dipped these delicious zucchini rounds into ranch dressing.  I wonder if this would work with mushrooms? Might be worth a try!  Thanks for sharing, Kelli!

This is such a delicious zucchini alternative. I did not top with the motzerella and served it with ranch instead of spaghetti sauce and they were scrumptious!

I like this shape more than the "fries" style, no left overs and I would make again.

It was OK, but a little too much. Try slicing them length ways,  brushing a little olive oil on both sides,  sprinkle parmesan cheese on them and bake them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, then broil them for 4-5 minutes until they are golden brown. Salt and pepper to taste.

I have made deep fried Zucchini for years and I use tupperware bowls with tops - but my variations are:
I agree that the zucchini needs to be 1/4" thick or it will be too soggy) then I add them to milk and let it soak just a few minutes, then to a bowl of flower, salt and pepper (shake it good so the zucchini is covered in it), then add them to egg mixture (again, shake the bowl), then add to italian bread crumbs (last shake guys).  I put them in a deep fat fryer 350 degrees until brown (not too long or zucchini will be soggy and not too soon or zucchini will be too hard).  I then use ranch dressing instead of spaghetti sauce.
My mother was not much of a cook but my grandmom, she was awesome.  Only problem was she never measured.  She called it "guestimating".  Thank you for bringing this recipe to the forefront of my mind - I haven't made these in forever!

I made these using panko breadcrumbs that i seasoned myself,(the pre-seasoned store-bought crumbs had too many scary ingredients in the list so i went the healthy route) Any way it turned out great. Good way to use up zucchini.

I fry "zooks" all season long, using your recipe and sometimes my own but I always fry using saved bacon grease, I never have enough bacon grease to fry with, so I save every drop until I get enough.

Oh very good. I did use a little flour in a bag to coat them before putting them in egg. Added 1 tsp of Mrs Dash onion/herb and garlic/herb seasonings. Family loved these, ate 'em all!
