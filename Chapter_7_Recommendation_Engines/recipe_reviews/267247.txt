Very delicious flavoring! I added some Panko seasoning to give it a crunch! Served with butter and it was delicious!

This was quick and easy. Not to mention light and tasty. I will make it again but will probably use jumbo shrimp. So they don’t fall through the rack.

Made this recipe exactly as written.  It was very tasty. Will definitely make again. I think I’ll reduce the cooking time by a minute or so next time.

i made this after getting an air-fryer from the better half. directions are spot-on . i used no-salt lemon pepper and let the shrimp sit in the sauce @ 30 minutes while i was goofing in the yard. it sure did look good. my wife and ( surprise daughter / 2-legged stomach ,that walked in unepectantly ) sure seem to enjoy it. i got sliders instead. great recipe! thanks brian!

This was really amazing tasting.  I used on top of a lemon infused pasta.  I also added mushrooms to the shrimp when I seasoned them and put them in the Air Fryer as well.   Super easy to do, took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.  Can't wait for leftovers!
