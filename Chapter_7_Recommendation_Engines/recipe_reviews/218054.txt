Thanks for a simple recipe!  I needed to use some ingredients we already had so I sub'd the italian sausage with beef sausage; I used fresh grape tomatos instead of canned; I steamed fresh broccoli in place of the rabe; and I used farfalle instead of rotini.  The King loved it and so did I.

This is a delicious basic sausage pasta recipe. So easy and fast. I used left over grilled Italian sausage and grilled veggies. I used chard instead of broccoli rabe. I cut up the sausage and threw it in the skillet with the garlic. Then added leftover grilled veggies, tomatoes (I used Italian style drained), and added the chard at the end just 5 min until it wilted. Note: you can chop up the chard stems and add that with the veggies. Delicious!

This recipe was delicious.  I made it exactly to the recipe and will make one change next time I make it.  It seemed a little dry so I will add another can of tomatoes.

It was good. I substituted fettuccini for rotini,  cauliflower for broccoli and smokies for spicy sausage. I cut up the smokies, and sauteed them in my cast iron pan in 1 c. red wine. I added 2 yellow peppers, 1/2c. feta and a tbsp of dill to the recipe. I also pressed 6-8 garlic cloves, since we enjoy a lot of garlic.

I used regular broccoli and italian sausage (no spicy). It was delicious. Great easy recipe!

I'd go with 2 bunches of broccoli rabe instead of 3

Really wasn't into the broccoli rabe. I steamed it first, but it just remained too bitter for me. The rest was fine. My family just picked around the rabe.

Maybe it's because I'm not a huge got italian sausage person but this was just okay to me. Seemed a little bland to me saut√©ed onion probably would have been a good addition.
