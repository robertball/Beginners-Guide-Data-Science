Loved these indeed!  The right amount of fruit and coconut made for a wonderful frozen delight. I only got three popsicles though...I wonder if me drinking half of the mixture as a smoothie had something to do with it? :-) Make a double batch of these otherwise you'll be writing a review of a wonderful smoothie. Delicious frozen and just as is! Thank you MsNingyoo for this perfectly calculated recipe.

Oh yes, this recipe is a keeper.  We thoroughly enjoyed these creamy ice pops.  The coconut, banana, pineapple, and kiwi are perfectly balanced, with not one dominating, with the flavor leaning toward a pina colada IMO.  I used light coconut milk and sub'd Truvia for the sugar.  Another thing you'll like about this recipe is how easy it is to make.  These would be the absolutely perfect snack or dessert for a summer BBQ (actually perfect any time in this house!).  Well done MsNingyoo.

I used sweetened vanilla coconut milk and omitted sugar. I also blended the kiwi into the mix instead of having it chunky. As promised, they were light and refreshing, perfect for an ungodly hot summer day.
