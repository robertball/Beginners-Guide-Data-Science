I made a few changes...regular rather than sugar free pudding...instead of the pumpkin pie spice, I used 1-1/2t. cinnamon, 1 t. nutmeg, 1 t. ginger, 1/4 c.  light brown sugar. (There had been a review that it wasn't spicy enough, but this helped).  I also followed another reviewer's advice and used cashews in place of the pecans.  It was a huge hit!

I made a few changes to the recipe but the basics were still there.  I used: Regular instant pudding instead of sugar-free, canned pumpkin for the pureed, cashews for the pecans and extra cool whip.  This dessert is a hit!!!!

This was pretty good, especially for a lower sugar recipe.  It had a little bit of a bitter taste, but I'm not convinced it was because of the recipe.  (Maybe due to a bad package of pudding?)  I chose this recipe because I was craving pumpkin and had all the ingredients on hand.  I might make it again for a quick, reduced-sugar dessert.  I agree with the first review - about 3 1/2 stars.  So I'm making mine 4 stars to balance us out!  (And no, I do not even know that person!  How funny our names are so similiar!)

This is really about a 3 1/2 star. The only thing I would do different is add spice to the pumpkin filling. It's lacking! I like the traditional pumpkin pie that is much more flavorful. Now it's time to experiment until the pumpkin has some kick!

Looked really pretty with the toppings as instructed, and pretty easy to throw together. I did the modifications suggested to pump up the spice flavor, but it was still lacking something "special". The pumpkin flavor really dominated; I didn't taste the butterscotch.

I will definitely make it again, the toffee chips & pecans add a nice crunch to the pie.
I did make some changes, I used 2/3 cup of 1% milk instead of the milk powder and water.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I did 1/2 teasp. of cloves & 1/2 teasp. cinnamon.  Forgot to take a picture but this is a delicious pie!

I make this pie but with a few modifications.  I make a baked gingersnap crust...8 oz gingersnaps, 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c butter.  Combine in food processor.  Bake for 10 min at 350 F.  I use Instant butterscotch pudding mix but not the sugar free.  I top it with equal amounts of toffee bits and Maple brown sugar glazed pecan pieces.  My friends think it's a winner and have asked for the recipe for Thanksgiving dessert.  When I first read the recipe I didn't think I would like pumpkin and butterscotch, but it's really a great combination.  The gingersnap crust makes it really special.
