I'm just a beginner, so I thought this would be a good one to try. Its great! With food coloring, its very pretty. Instead of flavored extract, I added a tbl of water to a packet of kool aide (cherry) and put that in. Yummy!

We are using this recipe to make our wedding favors. We were able to spray candy molds and use a candy funnel with stopper to put just the right amount of mixture into each mold. We now have beautiful, inexpensive, calla lily candies. I omitted the food coloring and chose almond flavoring. The candies are stunning and our guests will absolutely love them!

Great recipe! Used it to make a candy bowl!Tips on improving your luck with candy making.
1. If it's still a liquid, you either added too much water or you didn't reach the needed 300°F to reach a hard crack candy.

2. If your candy holds up but is kind of sticky when you eat it, you've made a soft-crack candy which forms at 275°F. Keep it on the heat longer.

3. Temperature is EVERYTHING in candy making, be patient and let it get as hot as it needs to be. Investing in a candy thermometer is useful but not entirely needed. If you don't have one handy, try out the drop-technique. Dip a spatula or spoon into your boiling sugar and drizzle it into ice cold water. When the strands come out brittle and glass-like, you've reached a hard-crack

4. Use a flavoring that's made for candy making! Not all flavorings are made to hold up at 300° in fact, most burn off completely before that leaving your candy flavorless. Lorann Oils is a great brand for hard candy.

5. DO NOT let uncooked sugar granules touch your candy before it hardens; it will cause the entire batch to quickly crystallize and become grainy. This includes the granules that splash up on the sides of the pot in the beginning! Keep those scraped down!

6. For a quick and easy cleanup, fill your pot with water and put it on the stovetop to boil. You can also throw in any candy coated utensils you used along the way!

I've made this recipe twice now and one time I thought I would make banana flavored candy with banana extract (have used this before in other recipes and is delish!).  I put in even a little more than the recipe called for and it smelled great and everything.  But come time to break the candy and try it, it tasted like nothing, just sweet.  Not even a hint of flavor, no smell, nothing!!!  Bleh!

Now another time I took another reviewer's suggestion and used one and a half packets of Kool-Aid dissolved in just a bit of water and this was much better... unfortunately I ruined the batch by putting it in a glass pan thinking I could cut it into squares before it cooled... dumb idea.  Anyhow, I will try this again using another flavor of some sort, I'm not sure if it was the recipe or just that banana is a bad flavor to make candy with!

Excellennt. I scaled it back to 12 servings and doubled the flavoring. While it was still hot but touchable, I cut it into strips and twisted it around chopsticks, to make ribbon twists, and they looked great.  If it is sticking in your teeth, you didn't let it heat up quite enough, try going all the way to 310 degrees using the (lowish)medium heat. This will normally take 20-30 minutes to heat after the boil is reached. If your burning it, turn your heat down to the low side of medium heat and take your time, it'll come out fine.  Good luck!

I made this last year at Yule and it was a huge hit with all my guests. One tip I can share is just after pouring use a pizza cutter to add horizontal and vertical lines to the candy it make it break into nice uniform pieces.

i kept burning it until i started taking it off the heat at 250 degrees, but i think that is soft candy.  I also put at least 1 tbs of flavor instead of 2 tsp.  This stuff is really good.

I made this and it was very easy. My kids loved helping and picking out the colors and flavors. Be sure to use a large saucepan instead of the medium or you'll have a big mess to clean up.

My Mom and I just used this recipe for our first ever hard candy making adventure! It was a decent size batch, so half will stay at home while the rest will follow be back to college. Our advice: be patient as the sugar boils (it took longer than we expected, and we even thought our thermometer was broken at one point!), use wooden (versus plastic) utensils, and for raspberry flavoring at least, we were glad we used an overflowing teaspoon.  Thanks for the good recipes and great memories!

I like this recipe. The only thing I'd change is using a large pot instead of a medium sized pot. I spent two hours hovering over the mixture in the medium sized pot, having to decrease the heat when the bubbles began spilling over the side, and then turning the heat up when it all subsided. Very frustrating! Once I transfered the mixture to a large pot, it was ready in 10 minutes. I used this recipe to make a candy rainbow for a cake top. I used 4 cake pans decreasing in size (12", 10", 8", 6", and then a ring from the lid of a canning jar), sat them, greased, one inside the other. When the mixture was ready, I quickly poured some into a large cup, added the color, and then poured into the space between one pan and the next. I did this for each color. I was happy with the result seeing as it was an experiment.

This recipe is VERY simple and easy to follow.  It does take patience.  If you use Kool-Aid as suggested (one packet to a TBSP of water) the flavor and color are great.  I wanted root beer candy and used 1 TBSP of extract as in the recipe, but it does not taste like anything.  Next time I'm going to use 2 TBSP of extract for sure.  

**EASY way to clean your pan:  Wait a few minutes for the pan to cool a little (to avoid warping the pan) and boil some water in that same pan.

I have made this candy a few times and enjoyed making it each time. But, I want to say this, who ever wrote the directions for the recipe didn't take into account that a novice candy maker like myself would try it or they assumed everyone would know this because they weren't very detailed with their directions and don't say exactly at what point you should add the extracts or oils for flavoring. And I have noticed a lot of people saying the flavor wasn't very strong. Try waiting for the boiling to completely stop before you add the liquid flavoring. If it's still hot enough to boil you loose most of the flavor to steam vapor. You may find you don't have to double the amount you use after all and you don't have to be forced to use koolaid as flavoring either.

I have made this many times and it usually comes out great. For some reason this time the candy sticks to your teeth soo bad that it makes it hard to eat... Does anyone know why its sooo sticky to eat this time. Oh and its sticky to eat not to the touch...

First time trying this and it came out wonderful. The only difference I made was in the flavoring. At Walmart they have these little flavor packs in the cake icing dept. as they are used to add in white icing to make different flavors and they are about 89 cents each. They come in great flavors such as bubble gum, strawberry, orange, and others. They work great as they are already colored. The bubble gum came out the prettiest shade of pink....just like bubble gum.

I loved this recipe!  I did have to change the amount of extract from 1 tbsp to 2 tbsp.  My first batch of strawberry was mostly sweet, so I doubled the amount of extract in the orange and it turned out perfect.  I live 7000 ft. above sea level and it still worked great!

Love this!  We have made red/cinnamon and green/wintergreen for our kids teachers each year at Christmas.  So easy they have been able to help since kindergarten...they are especially good at cracking the candy into pieces.  TIP: to make waiting for 300 degrees easier, keep a lid on the pan (easy if you have a digital thermometer) or wrap foil across top if using regular candy thermometer.  It makes it go quicker.

I make several batches of this each year everyone loves it. It is much easier to use parchment paper in place of greasing pan. Also use 1/2 to 1 dram of flavored oil. You can find the oil at a decoraters grocer or online. Lots of flavors available. My personal favorite is amaretto.

I'm a beginner. This was super easy and came out perfectly with the Kool-aid. If you want a deeper color though, I would add color paste. I was able to pour into molds and the taste is right on!!!

Used blue jello and Fumaric Acid(commonly used in store bought candy) for flavor and color, amazingly good! This was my first attempt to use a recipe to make hard candy, I highly recommend using Fumaric Acid if you are making fruit flavored candy or just want to give it a little extra kick. Fumaric Acid is a natural chemical that gives fruit that tart kick.

Made cinnamon candy with this recipe and unfortunately will probably end up throwing it all away because it lacks flavor. I suspect it was because I used cinnamon extract and not cinnamon oil. I even double the extract quantity with only a mild cinnamon flavor as a result. I may try the "kool-aid" flavoring next time. Otherwise, the texture and ease of this recipe is spot on! Thanks!

Great recipe! This was my first time with hard candy, so I followed the recipe exactly.  I chose a peppermint flavor, and it could have used more, so I would recommend using a little more than the amount that is listed.

blue food colouring turned green. Probably as the the colour of mixture was yellow. Still the suckers turned out. Use cookie sticks as ones for chocolate (plastic) don't  withstand the high temperature.

This was a fantastic recipe! It was easy, didn't take a lot of ingredients, and tasted good! For those whom are adding flavoring, I would definitely recommend adding more flavoring then less. I put in the amount recommended and it wasn't as sweet as I would have liked. Other than that, it's a great, fun candy to make!

This is awsome candy. I used 2 packages of Ice Blue Kool-Aid (because it was all I had) and 1 1/2 TBSP of water. It turned out perfect. I can't wait to make it agian with different flavors !!

This is wonderful! Just as easy as it sounds, and tastes just like I remember it. I can't agree more about the waiting, it seems to take FOREVER, but it is well worth the wait.  When I added the flavor I thought it would be ruined since the little bottles from the drugstore only contain about 2 tsp of flavoring (surprise!), but any more cinnamon & it would have been too hot. The flavor was perfect, thanks so much!

This looks like the recipe that I have for a candy called Stained Glass Candy. We made it every Christmas growing up. As teenagers we made it as a fundraiser near Christmas time for our church youth group. Some of my favorite flavors are: cherry, lemon, orange, cinnamon, butter rum and anise. We didn't powder sugar the top. It is great way to get your kids involved by having them help break up the pieces.

Followed the suggestion of using an unsweetened kool-aid packet+1 tbsp of water. We made a batch of berry blue. It was a big batch, maybe half next time. Everything turned out great. Keeps in a sealed container very well, I did not use any powdered sugar either, seemed to be just fine. No complaints! Homemade jolly ranchers, yeah....

This was probably my fault, but the candy didn't taste very good.  I ended up tossing out the first batch (made with Kool-Aid powder as suggested by several reviewers), because it tasted really "off".  I figured out that I probably had scorched the sugar syrup by cooking it over too high of heat.  The second batch was "okay", but the flavor was still a little funny and wasn't strong enough (I used lemon extract this time, tripling the amount the recipe calls for).  I think I'll keep searching for that perfect hard candy recipe.

The recipe looked great and the texture was perfect but I suggest adding a lot more extract. I added a little more than a Tbl. and I can barely taste the strawberry.

This is so easy.  My 4year-old and I made it together this year.  It makes a great gift.  Most craft stores or candy making stores will carry a variety of flavors.  We love Butter Rum, Anise Oil, Root Beer, Clove, and Chocolate!  Powdered Sugar is optional but add before candy cools!

This is like the recipe I grew up making everyyear for xmas. And if you want, once u add the food coloring and the extract. Put the confectioners sugar on counter (or baking sheet) Pour the candy onto this and then take scissors and start cutting it into pieces and then roll those pieces in additional sugar... COMES out GREAT

I tweaked the recipe for my specific needs (mainly I had been given six lbs. of gummy bears and needed to get rid of them).   Instead of flavoring, I added a couple of handfuls of gummy bears.   Also, once it had cooled a bit, I pushed gummy bears into the (still liquid) candy for garnish.   It's fantastic! It's very sweet but very, very good.

OMG, this is exactly how my grandfather made it every holiday season. He used to make red, green, white and yellow. Each got stored in a coffee can right next to the fruit leather and other dried fruits. My favorite was always wintergreen and anise.

This is one of the best hard candies I have ever made.  My famly loved it and I've made it 4-5 times. Great for Christmas.  Another way it to change It from orange to lemon.  Lemon is a little more tricky, because the extract is so strong.  But in the end I loved it

My biggest problem was putting in a foil lined cookie sheet.  I did not "sift" my powdered sugar which turned out lumpy and probably didn't properly dust the pan, therefore the candy stuck to the foil and had great difficulty getting it off. Will try parchment paper next time.  Also candy didn't quite reach 310F but used the "dropping"into cold water and it was hard strands.  Sticking to teeth.  Will wait till 310 degrees next time.  Thanks for all the comments which really help. :)

I'm just lucky that I pay attention so that when it did boil over, I was able to move it to a cool plate and quickly scrape away the spillage from the hot cooking top. It smoked a lot though and almost became my first ever fire alarm breach.

So easy! I didn't even put the flavoring in and they are great. If you try this it is easy to see when it is about ready. Boil it in a large sauce pan until it stops steaming and the boiling sounds different and that is it. good luck.

i replaced the water with home brewed (extra concentrated), green tea, and cut the flavoring, and got amazing results. i'm going to try with coffee and other teas in the future. as for anyone who doesn't want to make that much, i thirded the ingredients,
sugar- 1 1/4 cups
corn syrup- 1/2 cup
water-1/3 cup,
flavoring-1/3 tbsp. 
i know some people have trouble reducing recipes.

Super Easy recipe for Hard Candy! The only thing I would do different in the future would be to add more flavoring.

Perfect! I suggest being really alert when it is hardening because the first I made this I totally flunked that part! I also don't think the dusting was necessary. Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe. Didn't even have a thermometer, but by following the directions it set up perfectly. My only complain - couldn't taste the orange flavoring. Next time I will try doubling the extract.

I had to make a cake that looked like a beer mug with a suspended can of beer pouring a stream of beer into the mug.  I used this recipe for the stream of beer effect.  It was so easy and worked amazingly well.  Looked like the real thing!

This candy never got hard for me.  I obviously did something wrong since everyone else gave it a good rating.  I wish it worked, but I probably wont be trying this again any time soon.

This is a great recipe and it makes a ton of candy.  Unfortunately, I tried it with only one little bottle of the flavoring which was 1 dram or 1/2 tablespoon.  I recommend the full tablespoon or two of the 1 dram bottles.  I am going to try and half the recipe, except for the flavoring, because I want to make multiple flavors.

soooo fun and a huge hit! I cut the recipes in half and used a package of Blue raspberry coolade in place of the coloring and extract, forgetting to cut back the amount on the coolade.  That turned out to be the best mistake I could ever have made! JUST LIKE A JOLLY RANCHER!

Very straight forward easy recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and it still worked just fine.  I found the extract amount to be just perfect - I was using pure peppermint extract.  Worried if it was strong enough though (after reading other reviews) I did a hard ball test into water and then tasted the cooled ball to make sure the strength was there.  After cooling it tasted just the same. I also used a silicone cake pan so didn't bother greasing it.  The candy solidified and I could just stretch the pan off around it.

Great recipe!  As long as you know how to get to the hard crack stage, you won't need a thermometer.  Also - needs lots more flavoring than stated!  I needed two vials per batch, the recipe only calls for one.

Great recipe! This was my first time making candy. I bought a $2.00 candy thermometer from Walmart.  Just do not spray Pam in the bottom of the sauce pot if you have one of those expensive ceramic ones. It will burn!1

This was short and easy. I usually wake up in the night and want something sweet. Tonight I didn't have any hard candy. This was an excellent 2 am fix.I did use vanilla instead of orange only because I didn't have any. Next time I will try the kool aide.  I do need some suggestions on how to make it so it doesn't stick to your teeth.

Super easy recipe.  First time making it and it was a breeze. To those of you having problems:  the mixture will bubble when it begins boiling, give it a good stir and it will settle back down to a low boil.  DO NOT stir the mixture after it begins boiling.  Used a candy thermometer and just had to wait for it to hit 300.  Add the f in after it hits 250

Simple recipe to make.  Easy instructions to follow.  Just like the hard candy mom made when I was little.

As an added step, I would recommend doing a child water drop test before pouring your candy out of the pot.  Take a 2 cup measuring cup and fill with cold water.  Drip some of your candy into the cold water.  You should see little "teardrops" form in the water.  Pour the water out and the candy drops should be crunchy when you bite them.  My thermometer was off so many first couple batches did not harden.  The drop test tells me when I have reached the perfect temperature.

Turned out great but I think it's important to note how long it actually takes to get to 300°. Good thing I looked it up or else I would have taken it off way too early thinking my thermometer was broke or something. If you don't have a thermometer you can also put a drop of the mixture in a cup of cold water and if you can then roll it into a nice round ball with your fingers, it's done.

Never made candy before but followed the instructions to a "T" . Before the candy thermometer could even reach 270 it boils over in a "Medium saucepan" ruining my stove top. I then looked at the guide on the thermometer and it said for hard candy only do 260 degrees fahrenheit. The instructions need to be more detailed and reworked it seems. I'm glad some people had luck with this recipe but i would at the least use a large saucepan to help avoid this. I knew something was not right when after adding the water, sugar, and syrup the combined products came about 1/8 inch from the lip.

This is a great basic recipe for making any flavor, any color candy. I used this recipe for leftover prickly pear juice (from jelly-making). For the candy I didn't need flavoring or coloring, but I followed the boiling directions exactly as written. I was able to get temperature up to "hard crack" in about 40 minutes. My tips: use a deep pot for boiling. Cover cookie sheet with plastic wrap or large ziplock bag before breaking up cooled candy (this stuff flies when fractured!). The broken candy edges are sharp, so pieces should be small. They will stick to teeth, so finish completely before going to bed (unless you want cavities!)

I added citric acid to make them a little bit sour and they taste SO GOOD!!! The only thing that I dislike is that some of them have slightly remelted and melded together. I guess thats my fault for leaving them out in July  ; )

Regular flavour extracts are alcohol-based. When added to a hot candy mix, it just evaporates, leaving no desired flavour. I found candy flavours at the Bulk Barn, and then online at places like eBay. The only trouble is choosing a flavour! The 3rd time I made this recipe, I got brave and substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup, and didn't add anything artificial. It reached hard crack faster, but the resulting candy disappeared pretty quick, too! I've also experimented with the water portion of the recipe, using marshmallow and horehound tisanes, adding mint for the flavouring. The result was home-made cough drops!

turned out well, though there were changes from born from necessity. 1st, I used a little less than 1/2c of corn syrup and it worked just fine. 2nd, all I had was regular sugar, so threw some in ma food processor and went with that. have a great day!

A fun addition to neighbors ' Christmas goodies.  Struggled to find a flavoring that we liked and finally agreed on the pina colada  extract.  This was fun and easy to make as a family.

I am cheating. I have made hard candy before but, not this recipe. This recipe seens fine except, I think better results are acheived by using flavored oils instead of extract. The alcohol in the extract dissipates & the flavor is less intense in the end product.

This was my FIRST TIME making candy, and I thought this would be a good recipe to try. It worked AMAZINGLY It was so much fun to do with some kids I was babysitting and we used Kool Aid Cherry flavor it tasted amazing! Tip: When the candy is hardening put it on Aluminum foil, or wax paper. That way you dont have a sticky mess to clean up! Thank you for this recipe!

My daughter and I had so much fun making all kinds of flavors!  We even cut them into thin strips when it was still soft and made ribbons.  They were cute!  Can't wait to do it again.  The recipe was so easy, a couple of days later my MS aged daughter made 2 more batches on her own!  Be sure to use non stick parchment.

The recipe was easy enough. The problem I had with it was i nor anyone else could taste the flavoring. I used Lorann flavoring. If you use Lorann flavoring with this recipe you will need more than a one dram bottle. This recipe makes a lot of candy so it is really too big for just one bottle of lorann.

This was the first reciepe I did on hard/rock candy (I was making a vanilla flavor to get an idea on what it's like making hard candy) and I did get a taste of what it would've been like IF I didn't burn the batch. 5 stars on the recipe itself, but my batch... couldn't eat itxD

This is SO easy and so fun to make. This was my first rock candy recipe and if you are a beginner looking for an easy project, do this! Just a tip: When you add the flavoring stir it once or twice to combine it. Also, this won't work almost at all without a candy thermometer. I made strawberry flavor and my family is so happy! Also, the flavoring was pink but it didn't change the color and it turned out clear. If you want color, add food dye. I have shared this with all my friends and family, as it makes a TON. Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic. I used yellow dye and lemon extract. This recipe takes time. Do not rush the sugar coming to temp. I put the candy in small rubber bottom ice cube trays. when the candy is set, flip over onto dish or parchment paper and pop out.  I put them into plastic bag with a bit of powdered sugar and shook till lightly coated so they don't stick together. Lastly...not a recipe to make with children. Boiling hot liquid sugar can burn skin very badly.

I made this as is and used a lemon extract with an alcohol base that didn't work so well.  Obviously I need to use an oil flavoring and will do that next time.  I made a second batch and used lime jello in it.  The candy was really good!  It dissolves in your mouth faster than if I just used a flavoring and was not clear when it hardened but it was still very good.  I guess this is open to a wide amount of flavoring options.  I haven't tried the koolaid idea yet but I will definitely get around to it.  I didn't let the temperature get exactly to the hard crack point but it was close.  The sugar was beginning to darken a bit and I got anxious so I took it off the heat.  Very good experience over all.  I will definitely be making more of this.

Never made any candy before in my life and it worked great. The only issue I had was the flavoring was almost non existent. I added 1/2 tsp and thats not enough. Was wondering if the flavoring can "burn off" if you add it too soon to the mixture after removing from the heat.

This was fantastic!! I was a bit worried when j was cutting in the butter since it was straight from the fridge but it worked out well. There's very little left and I made it for 6 people this morning. The only thing I did different was that I sprinkled more cinnamon powder on top of the raw batter in the pan before I sprinkled in the crum topping. I will be making this a lot in the future! Heck probably again this week for work!

Will have to try again. This is obviously something that takes practice, and there were a few problems I encountered that were not mentioned in the recipe. It takes a *long* time for the sugar to dissolve, and little bubbles form during the stirring stage that make the syrup look like it still has sugar in it. Also, and this may be an issue involving my stove or human error, but I simply could not get the mixture up to 300 degress. I nearly burnt it trying to do so. Those issues aside, this was a really fun recipe to make that looks and tastes great. I made a bit of a mess playing with the long fibers that formed on the spoon! I also used some of the leftover sugar stuck on the side of the pot to make a candy jellyfish: I took a plastic spoon and scraped some sugar to form a ball, then slowly pulled it out to form long fibers. I liked this recipe, and will try to iron out the kinks the next time I make it.

This is great especially for Christmas. I made cinnamon and poured it out on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. When it was just beginning to set up I scored it with a pizza cutter and when hard, it broke into perfect square pieces.

So much fun to make and see the results, but definitely needs flavor. A tablespoon of raspberry extract did nothing, and we did wait until it stopped boiling to add it. Will try the kool-aid next time as other reviewers have suggested!

Super easy to make - turned out perfect for the Frozen themed cakes I am making! I didn't use the confectioners' sugar because I wanted the candy to look like clear ice.

Easy and fun to make! I made half as much, used ginger tea for my cup of water, and topped it all with powdered ginger instead of powdered sugar. It turned out great! Next time I think I'll play with the shaping of the candy itself, but overall, a fun weeknight kitchen experiment!

I made this recipe to use as part of a Frozen birthday cake (pieces of blue ice sticking out of the top), and it came out great.  However the powdered sugar was stuck to the candy, dusting it white instead of being a clear blue.

Worked like a charm! I made 1/3 of the recipe and it was more than I needed for the accent work on a "Frozen" themed cake. For reference, it could have easily spread out to cover a half sheet pan. Also... I made it on a whim and didn't realize I only had (3!!) jars of DARK corn syrup, but I went with it anyway, dying it blue at the end, unsure if the blue would really come through and it worked perfectly!

I worked without thermometer, but suggestion given in directions was enough.  It took me longer to get to the right temp as I worked slowly to build the temperature up, but the results are more than perfect. oh, and kids are happy too!! thank you!!!! :)

4 stars only because I wish it would have said approx time to leave boiling on stove.  I don't havea candy therm, and my other therm must have been off. I didn't want to burn it, so I took it off too soon apparently.  Ill try again with candy thermometer and I know to keep it on longer now.  I used banana extract and 10 drops blue food coloring.  Looks great for disneys Frozen "blue ice" that I'll be using for a cake!***


EDIT***- 2nd time around was a success!  I bought a candy thermometer and it does need to stay on the stove a LOT longer than you would think.  I did not time it, wish i would have to give readers an approx but i will be making it again this weekend and will try and remember to time.

I tried this recipe last Christmas and I am making it now for our Ladies Christmas Dinner tonight. I absolutely love this recipe.  I added just about a whole bottle (1 fl. oz.) of cinnamon, peppermint,  or other flavoring. It isn't too strong for us.

This was easy to make but you'll need to double the flavor and next time I'll only make half a batch.  After breaking it up it is very sharp and I'll find a new way to shape it from now on.  I did use all natural colors and flavors and this has a great flavor to it.  I may also not heat it to 300 - 310 so maybe it'll be a little softer, this candy is very hard candy.

Great candy and very easy! The hardest part was patience waiting for it to get to 300 degrees.  I gave this four stars because the flavor was not near enough. I did strawberry the first batch and it just tasted like sugar candy. Second batch I used about 3 TBS of orange and it was just right.
