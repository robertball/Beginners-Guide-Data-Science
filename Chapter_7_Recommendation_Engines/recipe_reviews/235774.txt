I used lean ground turkey and the recipe was good. However, the noodles absorbed most of the sauce so they were pretty soft. I cooked it on low heat in my slow cooker for about 6 hours. If someone has any ideas on how to bake it so the noodles don't over cook and absorb all the sauce, please let me know and I will definitely make this again. Also, I paired it with the cheesy Italian bread from this site and it was awesome

Made twice, because I couldn't fit all of this in my Crock Pot at once! Both times they came out the same... Tasty with some crispy browned pasta (I like it that way but it might not be for everyone.) I used bulk chicken sausage, and layered it in the Crock with meat on bottom, pasta, sauce, cheese, and topped with onions. Made a ton of food.

I did it lazy mans style with prepared sauce. I also did vegetarian- added mushrooms subtracted meat. I found cooking time is way too long. 4 hours on high and I got burnt noodles on sides. 3 hours high, maybe 5 low is plenty.

I've made it twice using ground turkey and Italian sausage in one and turkey sausages and ground beef in the other.  The pasta definitely soaked up the spaghetti sauce, but I just added a can of tomato sauce to my leftovers.  The second time I made it for friends and everyone enjoyed it immensely.

I made this exactly as the recipe says (except I didn’t have sausage and used 2lbs antelope burger) but only had 4 hours to cook so I did it on high. It was a huge hit! The noodles were perfect that way- not soggy like I’m reading a lot in the other reviews. Next time I plan to make sure I have the sausage but still use some kind of wild burger (that’s all I cook with), either 3/4 or half the noodles, and add another can of spaghetti sauce. This made a HUGE meal and we don’t need quite so much with just 4 of us and no microwave for hubby to heat it at work. I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't use all the ingredients listed in this recipe. I par-boiled the Ziti. I layered the slow cooker with chopped onion, tomato sauce, fresh basil,salt,pepper and oregano, 1/2 measurement of ricotta, cooled Ziti evenly. Sprinkled 1/2 measurements of mozzarella. Repeated the layer.Cooked on low for 6 hours. Easy dinner, yum and easy clean up. Left overs as well.

Came out very good!  I topped it with meatballs and just made a basic marinara sauce instead of the meat sauce.

Great.  But I didn’t put in noodles until 20 minutes before it finished. Can always do longer but can’t undo the shorter.

I am making this on Christmas Eve.  Should the noodles be cooked before adding them to the mixture, or should they be dry?  The recipe does not say.

I can't give this recipe five stars as I had to modify it a bit. 

I halved the recipe which worked out great for a family of 4 and we still had leftovers. It fit just fine in my large oval-shaped slow cooker. The original version would not have fit in it!  I halved the pasta, meat, sauce, but not the cheese. It turned out really nice. To ensure enough moisture, I put a bit of water in the sauce cans, about 1/4c of water, to get the last bit of sauce out. 

To cut down on dishes to clean. I cooked the meat in a large saucepan. Removed it. Then cooked the onion and garlic in the same pan. Then I added the meat and sauce to it and warmed it up a bit. 

I added additional garlic. basil, and oregano. I also added fresh sage and parsley.

Just made this recipe, left out the peppers because I am spice sensitive, and skipped carmelizing the onions and garlic due to lack of time before leaving the house.  It still came out fabulous!  I made it in a 7 qt hamilton beach slow cooker, and the recipe filled it up nicely, it took about 1 hour less to make than indicated cooking on low heat.

We will definitely be making this recipe again!

Tastes very good, but seriously makes a VAT of pasta! My family of 5 ate this for TWO nights, and there was still some left.

I used whole wheat pasta. I felt it needed more liquid but my slow cooker was already filled to the max before I got all the ingredients into it. I'll probably try it again but with some changes.

I followed the recipe exactly and (unfortunately) the pasta reminded me of canned 'beef-a-roni'. I will say that the first night it was palatable and I'm not saying that the flavor was bad, the flavor is definitely there. It is just that the pasta ends up mushy-(sp ?). I will try agagain except, I will add the pasta much later ! Again the sauce is nice

I thought it was going to be a little dry so I added a cup of V-8 Juice to spice it up and keep it moist, and it was great

I made it as the recipe says and couldn't fit it all into my crockpot. I made it for a potluck and everyone did rave about it. I will make it again but I have a few changes that I will try.
