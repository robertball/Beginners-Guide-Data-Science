Very fast and easy.  Tastes a little like a burrito.

This is a great way to dress up leftover chili!  Just be careful that the chili recipe you use isn't too "soupy", or it's quite messy!

This was such a quick and tasty meal. My husband added salsa instead of the sour cream. I will make this again.

I love chili cheese burritos from the national fast food "mexican" chain, but these were nothing like that.  I'll keep going through the drive thru.

These were very good!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, except I rinsed my beans before adding them to the meat mixture.  I served them with macaroni and cheese and it was a hit.  Everyone, including my 4 and 2 yr old requested seconds and then thirds, which rarely happens.  I will definately be making this again.
