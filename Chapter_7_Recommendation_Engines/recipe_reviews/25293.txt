This recipe tastes great!!  I steamed onions in Microwave steamer instead of boiling them (faster).  Also, since they weren't very big, I cut them in half and laid them in the bottom of the pan and then spooned the filling on top before baking.  Turned out great.  Highly recommend.

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday, and he loved them.  I thought they tasted good, but weren't worth the effort. I added some other veggies (celery and mushrooms) to the stuffing because I wanted to use them up, but even if I subtract the time it took me to chop those, the prep/cook time for this dish is way underestimated.  I did most of the work the night before, and by the time I washed/chopped the pepper and parsley, cooked the sausage and rice, cleaned, boiled, separated, and chopped the onions, then mixed and stuffed them, it took me almost 2 hours.  That's not even including melting the butter and baking them the next day.  I recommend getting really big onions.  When I boiled mine, I had to discard the first one or two layers because they were too mushy.  I don't think I boiled them too long either, bc the inner layers were still pretty firm and it was hard to pop them out without tearing the outer layers.  The flavors and instructions in this recipe are great, as far as stuffed onions go, but I just don't think the concept of stuffed onions is worth the effort.

My parents went wild for these - especially my dad. I would keep the onions on the smaller side personally and the idea of melting one's fave cheese on top is a grand idea.

This recipe was very good. My oldest son helped me prepare them and to my surprise all 3 of my children enjoyed them.  I used hot sausage which didn't make them too hot, and I used regular onions.  I was concerned b/c I only had 2 really large ones.  The smaller ones actually stayed together better and were the perfect size as a side dish! I think we would enjoy hot sauce mixed in with cheese on top!  I'll try it next time!  Thank you!

It seemed like a lot of work, but maybe I'm lazy.  Took the onions a lot longer to cook enough to be able to dig the center out. Had to use a grapefruit knife.
Was rather blah in flavor. Won't bother to try it again, but if someone wanted to jazz it up a bit, it's o.k. for a one time "impress" your company.  I would buy smaller onions.

I scaled this down to 2 servings, and made it with 2 spicy hotdogs instead of pork sausage. The 2 onions I used were pretty huge, so I ended up boiling them for about 30 mins. Husband liked it more than I did. I wasn't at all keen on the parsley.

This recipe was nothing special.  I thought it was a lot of work for just an ok dish.  The stuffing mixture was good, but I thought the onions were really bland.  I think I'll stick to stuffed green peppers.

I loved this recipe, which was delicious as is but then I also modified it a bit and I see that this recipe is easy to make your own.  I used turkey sausage and brown rice and it was just as good as the original recipe.  This recipe is wonderful as is, but easy to modify to your own taste. LOVE IT!

The microwaving option has these main advantages: Less mess, less cook time and---most importantly---vegetables cooked in a microwave cook from the inside out. (Cooking time determined by the size of the veggie.) As for the filling, parmesan is a great and covenient way to add salt, flavor and an added tactile texture for the palate. Hope this is helpful. (Note: Can also use vegetarian "sausage" and a little red pepper flake in place of meat, to make this a purely vegetarian course!) P.S. My Star Rating is based on the recipe given; it's YOUR challenge to make it a 5-Star recipe of your own. Stop whining and start cooking! ;=}

Good Recipe. I Grilled my onions on the grill with a light dusting of cajon spice wrapped in foil, then followed the recipe. Made it a better that ok dish.

The filling was EXCELLENT!!!! Will definately use that in mushrooms. This recipe took forever to make. My onions were not soft enough when I served them (I did use large onions though). I don't recommend using large onions because they take longer to cook and you don't need that much onion! Next time I'm going to use a single layer of the onion and attempt to roll them like "stuffed shells".  I also added fontina cheese on the top!

this is also a good company dish alternate on platter stuffed bell peppers of different colors. Not only pretty but healthy. I used half ground sirloin and half sausage stuffed all with the rec. given. Steam the onions with salt and pepper on them this brings out the flavor, serve with salad and buttered carrots. Very colorful meal

I thought this was just OK.  I absolutely LOVE onions so figured this was right up my alley.  I think there is something about boiling onions that takes away from the 'onion' flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it was fine, just not as WOW as I was expecting.  My boyfriend (who has learned to tolerate onions now) thought it was great!

These were really good. Like a few people have said the prep time is a little lengthy, but it is a fun project for two to do in the kitchen. Also I found it a little difficult to remove the centers of the onions. Overall this is a really good recipe and its perfect for a side dish with something off the BBQ.

This was interesting and very tasty. Taking others recomendations next time I'll use the microwave to prep my onions and I'll use smaller ones. I cut out the cream cheese and egg I used a box of a rice cheese blend and that worked great. Thanks. Loved this

I totally agree: it is virtually impossible to stuff the onions, which led to a kind of stew in the end.  It's not worth the effort, and the taste wasn't bad but also not sublime.

This looked really good.  But, when I made it last nite everyone thought that it was anything but good.  The cream cheese seemed to mute all the other flavors and the rice, cooked as per the instructions in the recipe, was mushy ...  Sensing that the stuffing was not turning out tasty, I added garlic, more oregano than specified, and I might have tried some kind of hot sauce as well ... but my wife doesn't like ALL hot sauces.  So, this dish was a big failure.  However, the onions were tender and tasty ... and I will try this again, only with some other kind of stuffing ... still awaiting an inspiration.

As much as I love onions, my stomach couldn't take it. It was tasty but not something I would make often as it's difficult to hollow out the onion.

I love this recipe! It's even great reheated the next day. I omitted the green peppers because I don't like them, and I use packages of flavored rice which cuts down the cooking time and adds a little something extra. Also, I buy the BIGGEST onions I can find, slice off the tops and bottoms, and before stuffing I cut them in half. It's WAY easier to scoop out the centers this way.

What did I do wrong?  I cut off the tops and peeled the onions and boiled them for the time stated, and I never got a shell off of the outside I could use.  Guess I should have cooked them longer or used grapefruit knife or scissors on the inside.  I'm accident prone, so that really isn't a good idea for me, ha!  So I chopped up the semi-cooked onions, added some chunks of mushrooms and some mushroom soup, some spices, some rice, some cheese.  Some bread crumbs to top it with a bit of butter in hopes of a casserole.  It's in the oven now, so time will tell.  What a hassle and so totally not what it was supposed to be.
