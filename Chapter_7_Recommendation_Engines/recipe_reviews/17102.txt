This was so quick and easy - and Delicious!
I ended up using these minor substitutions:  Butter instead of margarine because that is what I had on hand... a bag of frozen (and thawed) pre-cooked cocktail shrimp with tails cut off... Velveeta's mild "Mexican" cheese... Button AND  Shitake mushrooms... red onion.  WE LOVED IT!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did thin the sauce with a little half-n-half due my children not liking anything too spicy.  They loved it.  It was even better the next day.

Surprised by husband with this for Valentine's Day.  I used a 12-oz. bag of precooked, large shrimp (thawed, of course with the tails remove).  I thinned this with a 12-oz. can of evaporated milk.  Try it first as the recipe is written and decide for yourself...anyway, it is WONDERFUL!

Excellent and very different from other pasta recipes. Simple and easy, except for the deveining of the shrimp. Rich and fattening so need to substitute ingredients. Dan and Stacey loved. David did not.

Very good recipe that is easy to make.  Tasted great leftover and warmed up with a little milk to keep it creamy.

Oh my goodness! Yummy!  I substituted jalapeno cream cheese and added a little milk (about 1/4 cup) to make it more saucy.  The whole family gobbled it right up, even the kids!  Definitely a repeater!

This dish was excellent! The only reason I gave it four stars though is because this recipe's leftovers were a little too fishy for me!

This recipe turned out GREAT!  I used the velvetta pepper jack cheese.  I added 1/4 tsp basil, minced garlic and black pepper.  I used a pound and 1/2 of shrimp.  My boyfriend said this should be on the menu at Copelands! I will definetly use this again.

Wonderful! Made a quick weeknight version with Ragu Cheddar Cheese Sauce. I was worried it wouldn't taste good, but it was delish! A big hit with the entire family. I'm sure with fresh ingredients it would be even better. Versatile - I'll also try it with browned ground beef instead next time around.

Excellent!  I made it exactly as recipe states, using velveeta mexican cheese.  Very tasty and rich.  Next time I make it I may "water" it down with some milk or half/half, it was a bit too thick for my liking.  Still, tasted like something from a restaurant.

Tasted too much like mushroom soup. Was good, but was expecting it to have more of a kick in the taste.

I made this for the first time a few months ago!  My bf loved it so I had to make it again last night. I used sharp cheddar cheese spread and added one jalapeno.  I added 1 garlic clove, salt & pepper, basil, garlic powder, and a little bit of red crushed pepper.  Served it with bow tie pasta!  It came out really good!

Super duper good!  A hit with my family.  Only changes I made was to use regular velveeta and half a can of green chilis.  I also followed other people's suggestion to use 1/2 soup can of milk.  I seasoned with 2 bay leaves, oregano, basil, parsley and garlic powder.  Love it!  I will be making it again soon.

This was fantastic although I did make some changes. Added garlic to the onions and mushrooms, used velveeta and added chopped jalapenos. I also added probably about a cup of half and half to thin it out. Served on top of bowtie pasta. My boyfriend absolutly loved it!

The most delicious shrimp pasta recipe I've ever made!  Perfect amount of "kick" and flavor.  I added a chopped bell pepper.  We practically licked the pan!

Not being a fan of condensed soup, I did this:  Put pot of water on and boil angel hair pasta.  Sautee onion, garlic and seeded jalapeno pepper in olive oil until translucent; add shrimp (I used a package of precooked shrimp with tails removed) and simmer until warm. Add about 3 ounces of cream cheese and stir until incorporated; add in a few capers if you like and toss over angel hair pasta.

I usually only give 5 for really gourmet recipes, but I loved this and so did hubby, which is a bit unusual. I made as written but used bowtie pasta, really yum! There was leftovers but they were gone by time I got home today! (Made last night, hubby worked at home today :) and got to it for lunch!) Dang! I should have sneaked it out with me for lunch! Loved it, will make again SOON! Will try giving it to daughter home from college... Thanks so much for recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe. I made a few modifications only because I did not want jalapenos in it. I used white american cheese and I also used some garlic and parsley. I thought it was good and my husband liked it too. But not a 5 star.

I tried this last week and it was one of the best things I have ever cooked, my father a husband loved it and so did the kids...I couldn't find the cheese spread so I just bought a half pound of deli sliced jalapeno jack the land o lakes brand. it was amazing and it goes good with chicken a hamburger as well...I will definitely keep this a a weekly dinner.

I was skeptical when I tried this recipe; I'm not a big fan of shrimp or pasta but wanted to make something different. Boy, was I surprised! I didn't have any processed cheese, so I used shredded parmesan and tossed in some shredded pepper/jack to round it out. And it was even better 2 days later as leftovers. Will definitely make again.

This was the easiest yet most succulent pasta dish i have had in a while. I am italian and have had several different shrimp pasta dishes but with the simplicity of the recipe this is one of my favorites.  I didn't have any pepperjack velveeta but at the end i added chopped jalapeno and it was awesome.

This is a fantastic dish. I did modify it a bit though. I used shredded Monteray Jack cheese, half a soup can of whole milk, 1/4 tsp. garlic & herb seasoning, and rotini pasta. Other than that I followed the recipe. My wife absolutely loved it. This recipe will definately become a regular in our home.

This is the best quick recipe for me!  I travel a lot and this is quick and easy to prepare for my limited kitchen on road!
The recipe is easy to follow and it is delicious!  I feel like I am eating out at a four star restaurant without the big bill...and very little effort!

I used velveta mexican and salad shrimp.  Very easy! I will look around for a different processed cheese.  But a great variation from normal spagetti!

Mmmmmm Good!  My 2 and 5 year old even loved it.  I doubled the sauce and added small pieces of chicken and garlic.  I used Cheez Whiz w/ jalapeno and red bell pepper and added some cayenne pepper and garlic powder for a little extra "kick".  Thanks for sharing!

I fixed this dish last night along with my wife. We didn't think the kids would love it, but they did. We thinned the sauce with a little milk, but it was still delicious! We'll do this one again.

This was excellent! I only put in half the amount of cheese and used 4 ounces of regular cream cheese, because I thought it would be too spicy for my husband. He told me to use the whole 8 ounces of jalapeno next time!

I'm not rating it fairly yet, because it was a little too cheesy for me. Seems like it needed more spices of somekind. I'm going to take a suggestion and make it with basil, 1/2 can green chiles, etc and see how it turns out next time. Kids loved it though.. They said it was just like Mac n Cheese.

This turned out to be an ingredible dish that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed.  I made a few slight changes to the ingredients based on what I had on hand and to make it a little lighter on the calories.  I used 98% fat free soup and 1/2 soup can of 1% milk in the mixture. Since I already had regular velveeta and some left over chopped green chili's (1/2 of 4 oz can)on hand,  I used these two ingredients in lieu of the jalapeno processed cheese and it worked beautifully. I cooked the angel hair pasta for 5 minutes.  We look forward to eating the remaining left overs.

The sauce was very good and I will make it again, however, my famiy all thought that it would be much better on a hardier pasta, such as penne, the angel hair was weighed down by the sauce.

We LOVE this!  I don't keep jalapeno velveeta on hand so I just use regular (not a big fan of spicy food).  I also add milk to make a good creamy sauce.

Turned out GREAT!  Almost like shrimp augratin but over pasta.  I think cooking the angel hair for 5-7 minutes is a bit long.  3 minutes is good.

I thought this recipe was really good and easy to prepare and I would love to eat it again.  However, my husband didn't care for it (darn it) so I guess I won't be making it for myself!  I used a 1/2 of a 1 lb. block of Mexican Velveeta for the cheese.  It had a very different, interesting flavor.  Try it!

Excellent recipe!! I made several changes. I'm not a fan of processed cheese so I replaced it with Philadelphia brand whipped cream cheese with chives. I believe that was a 7 ounce container. I also added more shrimp. I used fettuccine instead of angel hair pasta.  The fettuccine was fresh, not box. I also added Old Bay and some parsley.

With a few changes to lower sodium, I will definitely make this again.  Do not use canned mushroom soup and save yourself all the sodium and additives.  Saute the mushrooms in butter first, then add the onions and garlic, followed by some half and half and the jarred cheese.  Wonderful slightly spicy sauce and quick to make with thawed cooked shrimp.

So good! I reallt don't have any criticism for this recipe which is unusual for me! This is the first 5 star rating Ive ever given! Only change I made was using regular velveeta b/c I didn't have the flavored. Then I added a little crushed red pepper to give it some zing.

This is a great recipe. I have been a shrimp hater for along time. My F.I.L. makes a shimp dish (not this one) that has turned me around on shrimp. This is a family farovite.

I had to substitute the cheese for a simple "mex" cheese mix...it tasted great though!

Just made this but forgot to get the mushrooms. Its still pretty good. As I dont eat shrimp, I made mine with beef sausage and chicken. Next time I will try it with mushrooms and add some green/red peppers.

I loved this recipe! All I had was regular Velveeta, but I sliced up some jalapenos and sauteed them with the onions and it really gave it a spicy kick! I also added some crab meat, and cut back on the butter. Delicious! Thanks for sharing.

This was really tasty. The only changes I made were to use regular Velveeta and add 1 can of rotel, 2 tablespoons of both chili powder and cumin.

This is really good and simple. I added a bit of 1/2 and 1/2 as another reviewer had done.It was a bit thick before that.I cooked the shrimp seperately from the sauce. Put a little olive oil and sauted with garlic salt and some Luzianne Cajun seasoning. I thought this way I could freeze what was left of the sauce for another meal since shrimp doesn't keep too long. I had plenty for 2 adults and 2 kids. My kids gobbled it up. Serve with garlic toast and ceasar salad, yumm!

Good recipe but I decreased the pasta to 8 oz.  I fixed it the first time with the full amount and it was too much pasta.  Everything else is great as is.

After reading all the 5 star reviews and making the recipe, I was very disappointed.  The recipe was very thick with just the addition of the condensed soup and required a lot of additional milk so it wasn't like glue.  I followed some of the advice an added garlic and basil.  I didn't have processed cheese spread so used some shredded cheese and tabasco sauce.  This recipe was a big disappointment and I would not make it again.

I love this recipe. I still have to make it for my soon to be husband but I really liked the flavor of the mexican cheese and the shrimp, mushrooms, and onion. This is very flavorful.

Another Keeper!!! I used Mexican Velveeta and couldn't use the full amount it called for, and glad I didn't since my children found it too spicy.

Made this for a family luncheon. My family enjoyed it. I did make a few alterations.  I took the adice and added milk to make it more creamy and velveeta for a little kick. I also used red onions chooped. I will use this again
