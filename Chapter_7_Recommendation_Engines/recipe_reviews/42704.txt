I'm a personal chef, & this recipe gets rave reviews. I agree with other reviewers- blanch the asparagus for 1 minute, plunge into an icewater bath, & drain. I used chive & onion soft cream cheese, and sprayed both the bottom of the pan, as well as tops of finished bundles with olive oil. Also, buy the best prosciutto that you can afford, ths helps with the saltiness factor. Elegant, & good either warm or chilled!

I have a couple of comments on this recipe.  I recommend using black forest ham or any other type of deli sliced ham instead of prosciutto.  It stands up to the cream cheese much better and goes very nicely with the asparagus.  I've made this before as a cold appetizer and it's great that way too.  To do this, boil the asparagus for 1-2 minutes (depending on thickness) just until slightly softened.  Immediately immerse in ice water.  Drain and blot dry.  Assemble as directed and refrigerate.  You should boil the asparagus even for the cooked version or it will be crunchy.  I found that if you boil the asparagus you should reduce the oven time to 7-8 minutes or the ham begins to get too crispy.  Really good either way.

Excellent combination of flavors!  Very easy to prepare.  Only change I made was peeling the asparagus first.  (unless they are pencil thin).  Peeling the stalk to about an inch from the tip makes it so tender (removes woody toughness).

I followed the recipe to a tee using 2 to 3 asparagus spears in a bundle, and very softened cream cheese. I also tried one asparagus spear and cream cheese w/ the prosciutto...I found that the saltiness of the prosciutto overpowered the single asparagus spear. This side dish is outstanding with asparagus bundles, however ! I would even recommend using many asparagus spears... I was disappointed because we ate all of the asparagus and didn't eat all of the prosciutto, although i LOVE it! No salt needed, it's salty enough! My advice: add more asparagus.

Phenomenal. The best asparagus recipe I have seen. Make sure to baste the bundles with olive oil so they don't dry out.

This is a quick, easy and very elegant side dish. Like a previous reviewer, I simmered the asparagus (about 3 mins) then immersed it in a bowl of ice cubes and water. They stayed beautifully green even after 12 mins in the oven. Great tip!

This is great cold appetizer. Blanche asparagas and immerse in icewater.  Makes the asparagas bright green. Very Delicious!

OMG! this is a winner!!! it's not only easy to make...but SOOO GOOD!! I made it for new years and even the kids had it! I served it as appetizer and people didn’t have “enough room” in their tummies to have the main dish! The blanching is crucial! And using a very thin slice of Prosciutto is the perfect combination!

this recipe is excellent. I made it for Easter and it was a huge hit! I peeled the larger asparagus and blanched them all for 1 min then ice bath. I combine white asparagus with green for an awesome presentation. I also used garlic/herb cream cheese. Roasted at 450 for 12 min. YUMM

I love impressive and easy recipes! I made this for a food & wine tasting and even my guests who dislike asparagus raved about it. I used provolone instead of the neufchatel and it was delicious, but ran short for the last few and substituted with cream cheese. I served it with store bought pesto sauce. Yum, yum, yum. Even good cold. Pairs very well with Pinot Noir.

This dish was amazing and a hit.  I followed it, using the tips of the other reviewers.  I cut the thick ends off of the asparagus.  I boiled for 2 min.  I immediately submerged in ice water for 1 min.  I blotted dry, and set aside.  I sliced the prosciutto long ways into 2 strips and placed a light layer of garlic and herb cheese spread on both slices.  I wrapped 4 asparagus with 1 strip of the prosciutto.  I placed each bundle in a greased baking dish, and lightly coated the ends of the asparagus with a little olive oil, so that they would not dry out.  I baked for 8 min.  They came out perfectly, and I will definitely make this again!!!

For a twist, I wrapped 1 purple asparagus with 2 green ones. And instead of Neufchatel I used chive & onion cream cheese. I blanched the stalks first, as others had suggested (great idea!). NOTE: Presentation wise, they look better when the stalks are lined up on the bottom and varying heights on top. Also, try to wrap the prosciutto evenly around the middle, starting with the thinner/narrower end of the meat and ending with the wider end.

As others suggested, I blanched the asparagus first and put about 3 pieces of asparagus per bundle and used regular cream cheese. Only thing I will do differently next time is when you wrap the asparagus with the prosciutto don't follow the pictures. Wrap it more like a candy canes stripes so that every bite has prosciutto in it. This reduces the saltiness, when the prosciutto is spread out. Excellent recipe. I always seem to under or over cook asparagus but this was the perfect amount of time.

This recipe is great. Blanch the asparagus, and bake it for about half the time. Depending on the prosciutto you buy, you'll want to soften the cheese (or use whipped cream cheese). The prosciutto that I bought was very fragile. This made the cheese spreading a frustrating mess.

Fantastic!!!  I followed the advice of several other reviewers who recommended chive and onion-flavored cream cheese.  I also blanched the asparagus for one minute before rolling.  I don't know if that was necessary, as the proscuitto probably could have cooked longer before becoming too crispy.  

I will definitely make this again.  It was a perfect side for our Valentine's meal of Broiled Scallops and Cheesy Polenta (both from this site).

Blanched the asparagus first and then cut the baking time to 7 minutes as suggested by previous reviewer. Also drizzled with a balsamic glaze. The ladies at the retreat I took these to, loved them and asked for the recipe!

I love this. It does not take very long in the oven if you like the asparagus crispy. Here is a tip that works for me. I put the prosciutto in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes. It makes it much easier to spread the cream cheese on the slices and as soon as you spread the cheese on, they thaw out.

I wanted to use these as appetizers instead of as a side dish so I trimmed the asparagus and chopped each into about 3 inch stalks then blanched for 3 minutes in boiling water. I immedietly put in ice water. I used deli sliced ham cut in half spread with chive and onion cream cheese and secured with toothpicks. I only baked 8 minutes, and these turned out great!

The combination of asparagus, Neufchatel, and prosciutto is phenomenal. I highly recommend blanching the asparagus - I did not and the asparagus came out of the oven a bit dry and wrinkly, hence the four stars rather than five. (It still tasted good though.) Will definitely be making this again.

This is great!  I followed the advice of other cooks and blanched the asparagus for 2 minutes in boiling water then plunged them in ice water to cool.  I spread the prosciutto with herb and chive cream cheese and cooked them on a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.  People raved about this recipe.  I've had similar recipes without the cream cheese but think that it adds that little something extra to it.  Makes a wonderful side dish.

This was super easy and delicious.  I blanched the asparagus for 2 minutes, then into the icy water as some have suggested.  I wrapped two slices of paper-thin prosciutto around about 5 spears, and popped them into the oven at the last minute.  They were perfect.

Seriously easy and seriously good. Sure, the prosciutto seems to get a bit saltier when you bake it, but that's what cocktails are for.

I did a twist on this. I grilled the asparagus and use the chive and onion cream cheese like the personal chef commented. But I drizzled Olive Oil and a Balsamic over with cracked pepper before grilling!
Delish! No cold water bath or heating the oven up!
Easy...Easy...

Be sure to get good quality prosciutto - that helps with the saltiness factor. I did as other reviewers suggested and blanched the asparagus first before spraying with PAM and putting in the oven.

This is my favorite way to eat asparagus.  It's just so good!!!  We blanche the asparagus so it's pretty and then broil at the end to crisp up the meat.  Love love love it!!

A wonderful recipe. I blanched the asapargus several hours in advance and cooled. Then spread a mix of cream cheese, minced onion, minced garlic & chives into a thinly sliced strip of prosciutto and wrapped around 3-4 asparagus stalks. I placed them all on cookie sheet lightly basted with olive oil, and also basted each asparagus bundle with olive oil so they do not crisp too much.

Delicious!  I highly suggest cooking the asparagus completely, then wrapping with prosciutto/cream cheese and baking for only a couple minutes.  The prosciutto is much better before it gets too dried.

First I broke the asparagus where it "wanted to break" at the stem end.  As others have suggested, a quick blanch followed by submersion in ice water stabilizes the asparagus for a quick cooking.  We grilled it for just a few minutes after wrapping in the cream cheese-smeared prosciutto.  What a great recipe for asparagus!

My go to app recipe when I need to impress at social events! Do not do anything to the asparagus except cut the bottom part off of the whole bunch where the bottom rubber band is and wash it. There is no need to peel it, par-cook it etc., that just takes away from the simplicity of the recipe for an upscale result. 
Definitely let the cream cheese soften to room temp, and place in a FREEZER plastic bag.  Cut off one corner and pipe a zig zag onto the slice of proscuitto to save yourself a ton of time.

I make this regularly throughout the summer, as I've never even considered making it in the oven so we have always grilled this.  I start w/ raw asparagus and the grilling cooks it perfectly!  We love that is still has some crunch to it.  Definitely stay near the grill so it doesn't burn, but definitely try the grilled version I can't imagine that the over version would be better !

Delicious!  Will definitely make again!  Followed the advice of others and blanched the asparagus for 1 minute. Put in ice water then patted dry with paper towels.  Reduced baking time to about 10-12 minutes.  Also used plain, softened cream cheese and (land o frost brand) smoked ham instead of prosciutto (3 slices ham per bundle of 2 asparagus spears).  Also, sprayed the pan with olive oil and the tips of the spears (someone wrote to do that to keep them from browning too much).  Yum, yum!

these are delicious and very easy to make... everytime I make them they are literally gone in a minute... good for when you have company over as a appetizer w/ drinks...
I blanche them, and I usually use philly cream cheese onion & chive for the spread... I always get someone asking me how to make them, I have given out this recipe maaaany times!

I brought this to Thanksgiving 2009...a great hit! Pay attention to the cooking times and temps..and if you're making a lot, leave part of the prosciutto in the frig until you need it...if it gets warm, it's hard to separate.

Great recipe!!! Got rave reviews for this one!  I did boil the aspargus for a minute to bring out the colour and then patted dry, spread whipped chive cream cheese on a whole slice of prosciutto, wrapped up 4 to 5 thin asparagus in each one and only baked for 8 minutes.  Everyone loved it. I used a whole slice of prosciutto and didn't find it too salty.
Very easy, looks very elegant, and so tasty!!!  Will definitely make this again!

FABULOUS!  When I hit a 5-star recipe I say "I would serve this to the Queen of England!"
Great hot/great cold. Bundled 3 spears as others did. Perfect. 
Her Majesty would love this. :)

Made this last night, and used Black Forest ham instead instead of the prosciutto. Also used cream cheese with chives and onions which was great. We used pencil asparagus, which we like the most, wrapped the ham around 6-8 stalks, put it in the toast-r-oven for about 4-5 minutes on broil, came out just fabulous.

Served for Christmas dinner as an appetizer.  I blanched and peeled asparagus with potatoe pealer
to get rid of any tough outer fiber.  After assembly with cheese and prosciutto I placed them under the broiler for about 20-30 seconds to melt cheese and slightly crisp the prosciutto.  Served at room temp.  Everyone loved them!

Fabulous! I made these exactly except for the baking. I bought asparagus on the thinner side and wrapped them in a bundle of three. We were cooking on the grill that night so we grilled them on med-low. Turned them a few times and when the cream cheese started to show, they were done! The prosciutto was left with amazing grill marks.

i brought these to Easter at my in-laws and everyone loved them.  After blanching the asparagus they looked really bright green.  i spent a little extra on the Prosciutto but just used a seasoned cream cheese on the inside.  Awesome appetizer!!

This was fast and easy. We enjoyed it. I brushed with olive oil, but otherwise made as-is. I think next time I will try a flavored cream cheese, like the onion chive.

YUM!  Using recommendations from others, I blanched the asparagus before wrapping it in the prosciutto.  Then I stored them in the fridge overnight.  We grilled them the next day for Easter brunch so the prosciutto got nice and crispy and had a wonderful charcoal flavor.  Everyone raved about them!  These were definitely a crowd pleaser.

LOVE this! I blanched the asparagus for one minute(more than that and it started to get stringy), drenched in the cold water. I used roast beef instead of prosciutto due to cost and picky eaters.

I liked them baked and then cold. Baking gave the roast beef a bit of a salty flavor kick that it needed. Having them cold the next day was a little heavier than straight from the oven, but still great.

Everyone loves this.  I just have to remember to make a lot!  It looks so fancy :-)  I agree with one reviewer who said to use the best prosciutto that you can get and it will be less salty but very good.

I drizzled olive oil on the asparagus and then seasoned them with a little salt before cooking them in a grill pan for a few minutes.  After they cooled I used soft goat cheese and prosciutto.  Sooooo delicious served cold!  And they looked so pretty with grill marks!

A crowd favorite!  They look so elegant, but are so easy.  Depending on the size of the aspargus spear, I wrap 2-3 together if they are small.  Enjoy!

These were so much fun!!  They tasted wonderful, and were very eye-appealing.  They took a while to prepare, but were a very different and impressive way to present asparagus.  Even after they were cold, they tasted great.  After they were put together, they could wait for several hours before baking, which made them easy to fit into the schedule.  I used thinly sliced Black Forest ham, too, instead of the Prosciutto.  Was less expensive and not as salty.  Would make a good appetizer.

I always make this fancy looking side dish for dinner parties.  I blanch the asparagus and put it together well in advance and pop them in the oven 15 minutes before dinner is served.  For evenly crisped prosciutto be sure to flip your asparagus midway through!

Yum!  Used black forest ham and chive 1/3 less fat onion and chive cream cheese.  Wrapped 1/2 thinly sliced ham around 1 spear.  Did not cook.  Served cold at a tailgate.  Almost too fancy for a tailgate but DELISH and GONE!

An awesome asparagus recipe!  Love it, sooooo good.  Because I can't find Neufchatel cheese, I use onion and chive soft cream cheese.  It works great.  I have tried this recipe both by blanching the asparagus beforehand and not blanching it.  I don't think it makes much of a difference in terms of how it comes out.  But this is just delicious - I think it comes out like a very "fine dining" dish but it's so easy to make.  A sure fire winner.

Be sure to use thin asparagus.  I did not have prosciutto so I used bacon.  Delish!  I broiled for a few minutes prior to serving so the bacon would get nice & crispy....My husband loved it!  We love asparagus roasted so this was a nice change.... Super simple, too!

This is my favorite appetizer.  I use a garlic and herb cream cheese and make it in the toaster oven leaving the big oven free for the meal.  Do not pre-cook!  I undercook it slightly and leave it in the toaster oven on warm while preparing the meal.  I also place it on top of garlic toast and sprinkle all with a good olive oil. YUMMMM

Really good!!  I made this yesterday but made it on a whim and noticed today that it was sorta on here.  I cooked the asparagus in hot water for about 2-3 minutes (in salted water) and put them into a ice bath.  Once out of the ice bath, I salted them and peppered them.
I cut up monterey jack ('cause that's all that I had), sliced up some basil and mixed the two together (cheese and herb).  I layed out the proscuitto and put the cheese mixture at the begining.  I put the asparagus in front of the cheese mixture and rolled them up.  Did about 12 of them or so and I put them in the oven on 375 for about 7 minutes or so. Husband LOVED them!  Great recipe (well, the recipe that I did - I will try this one out) :)

Fantastic recipe!  I get rave reviews for this every time I make it.  I use swiss cheese rather than cream cheese (it's easier to just wrap a slice around each bundle of asparagus).  I like the idea from some other reviewers of blanching the asparagus first - think I'll try that next time.

I thought this was pretty good.  Initially I thought it was salty but then the flavors of the asparagus and cream cheese started to blend and I was very pleased.  I made this as a warm side dish.  It went well w/steak and baked potato.  I did use the Prosciuitto.   At $17.99 a pound I just got two thin slices.  I put three asparagus around half a slice.  The hint about using softened cheese was a good one.  In the oven @ 350 for 20 minutes and it was good.  I drizzled some olive oil on top before cooking.

Pretty good, but my asparagus wasn't done in the time the recipe says.  I would suggest steaming the asparagus a bit, then putting it under the broiler for a few minutes.  Tasted great though!

I blanched the asparagus for 3 minutes like so many reviews said to but they still came out crunchy.  My asparagus were pencil thin too.  I used 3 stalks and they were in the oven 9 minutes before I removed them because the cheese was oozing out.  Maybe I should have blanched longer? The stalks were quite flimsy when I wrapped them, so I was surprised they ended up so crunchy still.  The taste is good, but they are too hard to eat as a finger food, as the stalks slipped out when biting into them and the proscuitto would pull off.  It was cut pretty thin, but maybe I'll have it cut thinner next time.  If there is a next time.  Not sure I'd use the cheese again either.

I used Jalapeno cream cheese! Perfect!  I could have done with out the prosciutto though.  I don't think for the expense that it added that much flavor.  Hek, I think ham would have been fine.

Since my little grocery store does not carry prosciutto very often I had to substitute with thinly sliced bacon. My family will not let me come to a function with out this dish! I now make quadruple batches just to satisfy their appetite!

This makes a for great make-ahead appetizer, but I like to wait and bake just before serving.

I made the recipe according to killian017 suggestions.  My only question is:  Should I have turned over the wraps halfway through baking?  The bottom was crispy and the top was not.

Scrumptious and easy!  Followed recipe for 8 for an elegant holiday potluck dinner.  2 lbs of asparagus (thick spears) yielded bundles of 5 spears.  Take the Neufchatel out an hour early to come to room temp.  Instead of spreading cheese on the delicate prosciutto, spread the cheese on the asparagus bundle and wrap the whole thing in prosciutto.  EZ Peazy.  I didn't blanch the asparagus.  Just spritzed the bundles lightly with olive oil; 450 for 15 minutes - beautiful and yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

It was wonderful! I did blanch the asparagus as suggested and then decreased the oven time to 8 min. We used 3 good size spears for each bundle. Will make again and again. Very easy!

This was a very flavorful side dish. I took the advice of other reviewers and blanched the asparagus before wrapping and baking. It helped them stay green and not dry out. The dish was very tasty overall, but we had some issues with the stalks being too fibrous and chewy (not the recipe's fault though). The proscuitto and cream cheese went really well together and not salt was needed because the meat was salty enough on its own.

Delicious! The asparagus ends were getting too done, so I ended up pulling them out early (around 9 minutes). Will try again in a glass pan instead of metal. I couldn't remember what type of cheese I needed, and ended up using white farmer's cheese - worked out great!

Very good. I've made this many times since finding this recipe. I also blanch the asparagus before wrapping and roasting, per the other tips here. I'm still experimenting with bettering the results (they keep ending up very greasy and/or burned), but taste-wise, I can't complain! :)

LOVED the Asparagus!  The only tip I would give: Make sure you eat them right away.  I took them to my sister's house and by the time I got there, they were cold and not as good as when I tasted them at home.  But nonetheless, people LOVED them.  THANK YOU Trish!!

Delicious. It took a little time to spread and wrap each one, but it was easy to do and well worth it. I prepared these several hours ahead and stored them in the fridge on baking sheet. I took them out and baked right before serving. Guests ate every last one. Will definitely make again.

I blanch asparagus for 1-2 minutes depending on thickness and plunge in ice water to stop cooking. slice prosciutto lengthwise, spread a little garlic and chive cream cheese on meat and spiral wrap around a single asparagus spear. chill until ready to serve. Guaranteed to be a hit!

This was part of our '09 Christmas Eve dinner - and everyone really liked it. It was served room temp, as well as eaten cold the next day. Seems to be tasty any time but right straight from the oven. The only reason it's 4 stars vs 5 is because it's not quite to-die-for - but it's close!

I love this recipe.  Normally, I do one asparagus spear per wrap, and I do like to mix in a few garlic cloves (crushed) with the cream cheese.  To me, the prosciutto is a delightful treat.  I have not tried this with bacon or lunch meat, and I don't plan to -- why mess with perfection?  Outrageously good.

AWESOME was the concensus on these from my 15 dinner guests!! I had to use garlic and herb cream cheese, which I spread on the prosciutto thinly.  I did blanch the asparagus for 2 mins. and then wrapped them up, 5 in a bundle, almost 3/4 of the way. Baked for 15-20 mins. These were a HUGE hit and will definitely make them again and again!!

One word to describe this dish, "Fantastic"!  Make sure to blanch the asparagus spears for one minute, then put on ice to stop the cooking process.  Also, make sure to Pam the bottom of the pan. When finished, lightly drizzle the top of the spears with olive oil. DO NOT add salt. The prosuito is plenty salty, trust me on this one.

I completely agree with Kate's review of this recipe.  However, I wish someone would have told me not to be so liberal with the cream cheese.  Use only a very thin spread on the prosciutto or it will over power the bite. (I NEVER before thought there could be too much cream cheese!)  This was a very pretty and easy side dish.  I made it ahead of time and took it to my boyfriend's parents for the final baking.  Very impressive.

Yum!  I needed a quick appetizer/tailgate dish and I have been wanting to try these for a while.  I actually used regular deli ham and chive cream cheese.. it was SO delicious.  I cut the asparagus into thirds to make it a bite sized.  I also blanched the asparagus, and served the dish cold.  Even my green-hating dad liked these and I couldn't stop eating them.  Great recipe.

This is such a good recipe. Sometimes the simpliest are the best.  I've made this two different ways.  First, I made it exactly like this recipe for a side dish.  Everyone loved it.  For an appetizer, I did not bake them and boiled the asparagus for 3 minutes then rinsed in cold water.  I served them cold. The trick to spreading the cheese is to only spread it on the ends.

Wonderful side, beautiful too! Some of the spears became a little dry. Also, you don't need much Neufchatel, I acutally cut the prosciutto in half and used 1/2+ teaspoon cheese per grouping.

This is wonderful. Blanch the asparagus for a minute or two (add to boiling water), then immediately drain and put the asparagus in an ice water bath. While the asparagus is soaking in ice water, spread onion & chive cream cheese on the Prosciutto, take 3 spears of asparagus and wrap with 2 - 3 slices, depending on how much you have. Drizzle a little olive oil on the top. I was baking pork tenderloin at 350 for 20 minutes so I just baked these along with the pork. They came out perfectly! Thank you for the recipe Trish!

I've made this recipe a few times and it is super easy and a crowd pleaser.  I've made a few alterations that have made it even better (in my opinion)  Use fat free cream cheese and just spread on prosciutto lightly enough just to make it stick to asparagus.  Have them slice proscuitto thick enough so it doesn't fall apart.  Then i cut up chives, basil, and green onion finely and sprinkle it on the cream cheese after spreading on prosciutto. Wrap asparagus.  Then lightly dust with garlic powder and black pepper.  Yum!!

I guess I didn't acutally make this recipe at all, but rather used it as a guideline.  I blanched my asparagus first and then just wrapped 3 or 4 spears in one slice of prosciutto. I then baked for 10 minutes. VERY good!  Next time I'll make them with the cream cheese.

This was a big hit.  Next time I'll bake the asparagus on a wire rack inside my pan becuase the salt from the proscuitto "juice" made the asparagus very salty.

Excellent recipe.  I followed another reviewers recommendation and used onion and chive cream cheese.  I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit.

This was very good and it was well liked.  I blanched the asparagus a few minutes before wrapping them.  I used white and green asparagus like someone else mentioned but I found that the white was somewhat more difficult to bite than the green.  I will probably just use green next time. The cream cheese was a bit difficult to spread onto the prosciutto but I managed. I may try a different cheese sometime.  I used bacon when I ran out of prosciutto.  Very fun recipe. ***UPDATE. I made this again, but this time used very thinly sliced corned beef and added goat cheese to the cream cheese.  I was told that it was much better than with the prosciutto.  Plus it was at least half the price.

My husband loved it but I thought the saltiness of the prosciutto overpowered the flavors of the cheese and asparagus. Next time it might be worth wrapping bunches of 4-5 asparagus stems instead of just 3 to help improve the ratio of asparagus to prosciutto. But overall a fun side dish with attractive presentation, so I'd definitely try it again.

Big hit at Christmas!
I followed the advice of other reviewers and blanched the asparagus first. This made it really easy to make a ahead of time and cook right before dinner.  They looked amazing!  I will make these again - next time I will wrap more of the asparagus and not just the middle.

All I have to say is OMG! This is wonderful. I made this last night for Christmas dinner and there was none left. we even had to have a vote over who got the last one.
After reading others reviews, blanching the asparagus for 2-3 minutes is crucial.
I had small to medium sized asparagus so there was no need to remove the skin from them. I also used chive and onion cream cheese, which was amazing.
This was a fast, and elegant side dish, which had everyone in my family thinking I was such the chef!!!

I peel and blanch the stalks... do the ice bath etc.. one thing I do differently is use a good soft goat cheese. I use only enough proscuitto to wrap the stalk with one layer. Spray with olive oil and run it under the broiler to crisp and shrink the meat to the stalk. I serve them room temp as appitezers and warmer if they accompany a meal.

Nice change to eating steamed asparagus.  I didn't have cream cheese on hand, so used a parmesan ranch dip spread instead.  It was great!  So easy to make.  I chilled them after cooking and took them tent camping with us...Nice elegant appetizer while we were waiting for the burgers to cook!

This appetizer is a favorite among all asparagus lovers. Provolone cheese wrapped along with the prosciutto is another tasty option that people love. I also sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan and sprinkle with hot pepper flakes. As noted,blanching first and spraying with olive oil before baking is worth the extra steps.

Wonderful new appetizer recipe.  We served this at Christmas and despite being asparagus, it was gone in no time.  We are serving it at a cocktail party next week and are so looking forward to enjoying this again.  A little expensive, but a nice treat!

The amount of cream cheese can be determined by taste. I only put a very thin amount on, and you couldnt taste it, but helped with the taste. The prosciutto was the ingredient that gave it the extra savory taste.

These are excellent, I had the deli slice the prosciutto really thin and used it to wrap 4 spears of aspargus. Not too salty at all.  (I also dipped the aspargus in boiling water for 1 minute prior to preparing as others suggested but not sure this was necessary as I prefer with a slight crunch instead of too soft)

I really loved these and will probably make them again.  I took the advice on blanching the aspargus first and then I cooked it for about 15 minutes as directed.  I was surprised at how salty the prosciutto was (more so than bacon) but I put 3 asparagus spears per piece so it balanced it out.

I gave this recipe a try on Thanksgiving and it was liked by some, but not all. Wrapping the asparagus with the prosciutto was a little tuff at first, but once you get the hang of it, the time goes by a little faster. (if you use deli prosciutto, the slices are thinner so it will be a little harder) One thing about the recipe that i didn't agree with, was the cook time and heat. 15min. in 450 degrees will dry out the prosciutto and less time will leave the asparagus raw. I will give this recipe a try again, but will try to cook the asparagus first so i don't have to leave the wraps in the oven too long. All in all, I thought it was a pretty good recipe.

I really enjoyed this, although getting the prosciutto to separate was my biggest problem. My slices kinda shredded but it still tasted great.  I did blanch the asparagus before wrapping, I think this made a big difference in the presentation, it makes the green really "pop".

This is a great recipe.  It can be played with a little and still turn out great.  My favorite variation is to spice it up a little and use prosciutto and horseradish cheese - delicious.

These were awesome!  My one comment is to make sure the cream cheese is really soft, since prosciutto is so thin, to avoid tearing it when spreading.  Thanks for the great recipe!

What a recipe!  Talk about easy and presentation.  It has it all.  Thanks Trish for sharing!!!  I used cream cheese and only used 1/2 slices of the prosciutto as they were large slices.  I also blanched the asparagus spears for 1 minute in boiling water and afterwards immediately shocked them in ice cold water.  This really brought out the green color and ensured the spears were crunchy, yet cooked after baking.  Served this dish at a dinner party and everyone raved!  We'll have this dish regularly!

It was so easy to make. We loved it. The only thing is the prosciutto edges burned a little. I left it in the oven for the 15 min. I think next time I will try 10 min.

Very good, however, make sure you use thin asparagus and not stems that are too thick. Instead of the cheese, I used Alouette spreadable herb cheese. Very easy to spread on the proscuitto. I did think this was very salty but I believe that was because of the brand of prosciutto I had purchased. Will make again. Very nice presentation. Think this would go great with beef tenderloin or lamb chops.

I have this recipe and make it all the time! I use real cream cheese. Be sure to add just a little minced garlic, salt, and pepper to the cheese before spreading for added flavor.

WOW!  WOW!  WOW! These were soooooo good!  I just made them for an ordinary dinner, but they would be so perfect for company, too.  I sprinkled a little olive oil and garlic salt on the asparagus.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

Great flavor!  I've had asparagus wrapped in bacon before, but the sweet creaminess of the cream cheese along with the saltiness of the prosciutto just tickles your taste buds.  It's a family favorite

Very good. I did blanch the asparagus, and bundled 2-3 stalks per slice of prosciutto. I used whipped cream cheese since I had it on hand. Delicious.

SO, so good.  Used very thinly-sliced prosciutto, and blanched the asparagus first.  Cooked for 10 minutes, probably would do 12 minutes next time for crisper prosciutto.

I'm an Spanish living in England and I rather do this recipe with Spanish iberico ham, Prochiutto is good but pata negra ham is something else, at least the one I buy online in www.jamonarium.com . They have some kind of ham bites idels for salads like this, and the taste is strong and juicy.... delicious!!! 
Thanks for the recipe guys!!!

My family loved this!  I only gave it four stars just because I made a couple "plain" without seasoning the cream cheese (I didn't have true Neufchatel), but then we added lemon pepper into the next batch and it was so tasty.  I'd absolutely do this again!!  Thank you Trish, for sharing.

I make this as a cold appetizer and it is delicious!  I blanch the asparagus first, then cut into 3 inch pieces.   I wrap about 3 pieces per bundle with prosciutto (i use about half a slice per little bundle, but you need to test for your own taste) It is so easy and quick and looks nice on a plate for a cocktail gathering.

These flavors combined are quite delicious. Works well with a main entree of beef.

I added 1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese to the neufchatel cheese.  The cheese held up very well and it was a delicious side for filet mignon.  My son-n-law does not like blue cheese but he went back for a third serving.  I will definitely do this over & over.

It's GOT to be a "5". I haven't done it yet.. but for years I've been roasting/grilling asparagus wrapped in prosciutto - without cheese. and IT'S delicious! Like most; real quick blanch then ice bath - evoo, S&P, and some garlic powder. If I roast in the oven, I finish off with a short shot under the broiler to crisp the wrap. It's sooooo good. But I'm tryin' the cheese addition tomorrow at our pool-closing party coz' it sounds like it rocks!

I have made these for a while now.  You can cut down on the salt by using cream cheese.  It doesn't seem to be so salty.  I usually do these on the barby, 
I use two to four asparagus at a time and it works wonderful.  I also used the light herb and garlic cream cheese.

I used a garlic herb spreadable cheese because that is what I had on hand, and wrapped 3 spears per piece of sliced prosciutto ... and it was amazing.  The cooking time was perfect - not mushy or overdone at all!

This was a winner of a recipe... especially to take to a party which I did with rave reviews.  I changed it up a bit, because although I did have the prosciutto I didn't have the Neufchatel cheese.  Instead I had very thinly sliced provolone cheese.  So I wrapped the three asparagus first with the cheese and then the prosciutto around all (using the smaller asparagus)  No par boil ... into the oven for ten minutes basted with olive oil and spritzed with lemon juice (lightly).  Let em cool and party away.

This was AMAZING!!! My boyfriend and I ate an entire bundle of asparagus even though they were just a side. I did the same as other reviews by blanching them first, but for a little added dimension, I cooked them on the BBQ. Awsome in the oven also but BBQ'd was amazing.

These were delicous but very rich and a little too salty for our taste... it was hard to eat more than one bundle. All in all I would make these again but maybe use less chese or leave out the cheese next time.

Probably the best vegetable dish I've ever had!  I used light chive and onion cream cheese and super thin prosciutto.  I also blanched the asparagus first.  This dish was a big hit.

This is a great appetizer and so simple to prepare. Partially blanch your asparagus if you are using thicker stems and quickly put into ice water to stop the cooking process.

This recipe is not only delicious, but it looks elegant and dresses up any meal.  I followed some of the reviews and substituted the Neufchatel cheese with Onion & chive flavored cream cheese and before I wrapped the asparagus in the prosciutto I blanched the asparagus in boiling water for a minute.  Everybody at Christmas Dinner just loved it and raved about how tasty it was.  (Little did they know that it only took me a couple of minutes to prepare).  I definately will be making this recipe again and again!

Really great!  Used garlic and onion cream cheam cheese and black forest ham instead of the prosciutto.  Cooked the asparagus crisp-tender before baking and sprinkled fresh black pepper on top.  Served room temp.  They were the first to go!  My guests stood over the pan and ate them as appetizers!

This is incredible. Truly. So easy to make and so simple, yet they look beautiful and taste even better. I used 5 stalks of asparagus each and wrapped the proscuitto on an angle so the whole length was covered. Did not blanch first, just made as directed. I brought it to a dinner and they were devoured. Thanks!

This was a great hit at Thanksgiving (Canadian).  It's difficult to find Neufchatel in Alberta so I use cream cheese instead.  I would recommend using 3+ spears (using new asparagus that are thin and tender) and half a slice of proscuitto spiralled around the bundles to help tame the saltiness.  I put the bundles on a pan in the BBQ (we were short on oven space) for 15 minutes and they were delicious!  The tips were a little crispy and it made this wonderful carameling on the proscuitto.  Now a staple of the Thanksgiving meal.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 is because adding feta to this makes it amazing! Just roll up some feta with the asparagus - and bake for 10-15 minutes - no need to turn... like I said: Amazing!

This was a great side dish, way better than boring old plain asparagus. Did not find it too salty at all. Maybe buying a higher quality prosciutto made the difference, not sure. I added some fresh chives from my garden to the cream cheese. Will make again for sure!

My Hb and I totally LOVED this dish.  What flavor it had. I used 4 asparagus per each slice of prosciutto with chive and onion cream cheese.  I found the more cream cheese used, it helped decrease the saltiness of the meat.  Cooked at 400 degrees for 15 mins. because I was making Gouda and Spinach Stuffed Pork Chops from this site.  I did not blanch the asparagus - no need.  They came out perfect.  Will definitely make again and again.

Great easy recipe for a nervous cook like me.  Made this for a memorial day bbq and they went over like gangbusters.  Making them again tonight for a get together with friends.  I agree with many of the posters to boil the asparagus first.

This is is so yummy - my guests were amazed by the look & taste of this dish.  I made with chive & onion cream cheese & also put a little olive oil & salt on the "exposed" part of the asparagus before putting into the oven.  These take a little bit of time & the proscutto can break as you're spreading the cheese, but it doesn't matter once you get it on the asparagus.  Try it!!

This was fabulous!...I used thin ham because I was making it for 20 people. It was great hot and at room temperature. Looked very elegant, too.Everyone raved. I think next time I make it, I may flavor the cream cheese a little. Delicious!!

I did not like the cheese in this recipe, to put it mildly.  If I make this again, I will use real cream cheese and halve the amount.  Otherwise, the proscuitto and asparagus came out well.

Truly delicious. I couldn't find Neufchatel cheese, so I just used what I had on hand - sliced Swiss cheese. It was super easy, and  because I left it in the oven longer than 15 minutes, the prosciutto had a nice crunch to it.

Loved these. I did put cream cheese on some but didn't like it as much as I did without it. I also used bundles of 3 stalks of white and green asparagues and 2-3 slices of prosciutto. Really classy and good. Thanks!

Looking for "southbeach" friendly recipes and this is a keeper.  I used light garlic and herb laughing cow cheese in place of the cheese in the recipe, and it was great-and already softened.  Super easy to throw together for a quick party!

I made this Saturday and loved it!!!  The only thing I did differently was cook it longer.  I actually forgot it.  I probably left it in the oven 15-20 minutes.  However, it was larger asparagus, and I think it needed it anywya.  It was still a little crispy when I took it out.  The leftovers later were just as good - maybe better - at room temperature.  We'll definitely make this again!!

This is awesome!  I am definitely going to make this over and over again!  I did blanch the asparagus before and I used an herb cheese spread.  Unfortunatly the first time I made it I left it in the oven while we finished our course prior and that was a big mistake! Do not overcook this.  Otherwise, this dish is so easy and wonderful!  Very elegant!

One of my all-time favorite appetizer recipes.  So easy to make and I don't even measure the cheese anymore. I just spread it directly on the asparagus until I think the proscuitto will stick and quickly wrap.  Delicious salty crunchy goodness!

I saw these at my friend's party and they were very tasty. She didn't bake them. She pre-cooked the asparagus for 1 or 2 minutes and wrapped the prosciutto over few stems of asparagus and some cream cheese. She tied it with a chive. Very nice presentation and a great tasting appetizer. I made it few times myself.

OMG, this is SOOO good.  I use my own variation now, as I've made this so often.  Fresh asparagus, snapped at the ends, coated in oil, and spices, then baked after wrapping in prosciutto.  The saltiness really compliments the dish.  A new -now old-favourite!

These are so delicious and rich. Excellent holiday dish. Very Very good! The bacon was crisp and the asparagus so tasty. I wish I hadn't gone so lightly on the cheese. Next time I will cut the stalks shorter (about 5 inches) as the wider end was a little tough and stringy. I fixed 12 bundles of these, and everyone had seconds. Mine took about 18 minutes to cook. All we could say was "WOW"!!!

I tasted these for the first time last Christmas. I wanted to make them today and found this site. I loved Nancy, Kate, and Molle's ideas. I used cream cheese, and chives made from fresh spring onions. Made sure to cook and blanche to help with the tenderness. Then spread the cheese and wrapped. I did one asparagus at a time. I didn't add but a pinch of salt to the cream cheese though. That way it wasn't to salty. I brushed the pan with olive oil and then the wrapped spears, I then baked them like the others said at 400 for 10 to 15 min. Mine came out at 12 min They were so-sooooo good. My family loved them! Thanks to all the reviews! Oh I almost forgot, I also made a lemon beurre blanc sauce and drizzeled it over them on the finished product. That lemon flavor was great with the salty taste.

I made this as an appetizer to a Manicotti alla romano recipe I found on here. It paired perfectly!

I used a creamy goat chesse as no supermarket or Gormet store in my area carried that type of cheese. My husband LOVED it!!! I only wrapped the proscuitto in 2 pieces of asparagus... next time I will do 4 as it was a little salty... I didnt blanch it, it didnt need it at all it was fully cooked and crisp. Next time I may just use cream cheese to spread. 

I also made prosciutto and fresh mozzerella cheeseon a fresh bay lef with a little salt pepper and olive oil..... this helped cut the saltiness of the asparagus. I may do melon wrapped in proscuitto next time as well.

SO so good.  I blanched the asparagus in boiling water for 2 minutes, and only baked for 10, which gave it perfect color and texture.  Used 5 thin spears per bundle and a little less cheese and probably less prosciutto since I had super-thin deli slices.  All in all it was incredible easy and good and so pretty!

Excellent!!  I use light cream cheese instead of neufchatel, and prefer Di Parma prosciutto to the regular.  This one is imported from Italy.  It is much more expensive and a lot less salty.

My prosciutto was sliced so thin I had to use a couple of pieces but that was fine. Also, when I scaled the recipe to 16 serving it said to buy 2 lbs. I only bought one and that was plenty. At $15.00 a lb I didnt want to buy more than I needed. I imagine regular cream cheese would work the same also. Great recipe though.

Beautiful presentation and tastes good.  I blanched the asparagus first and trimmed/peeled the thicker stems.  Next time I would make sure the prosciutto was very thin.  This time it was a bit too thick and got a little tough when baked.  I made them in the am and put them in the fridge for an evening dinner party.  I probably could have made them the day before and they would have been fine.  Definitely a good recipe but not quite a 5.  I will make again.

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because, as written, it's not as good as it could be. The amounts of prosciutto and neufchatel cheese called for are WAY too much. For a bundle of 4 asparagus spears, it's best to use one paper-thin (as thin as you can get it) slice of prosciutto, spread with about a tablespoon of neufchatel. The smokey and saltiness of the prosciutto soaks into the cheese and asparagus while baking. Also, be sure to brush each bundle completely with a bit of olive oil, to keep everything moist. These would be lovely served on a ring of blanched red sweet pepper. Try it with smoked salmon too!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  I buy asparagus in large bunches and eat this for a couple of days.  I do embellish on the recipe a little.  I have used Philladelphia soft cream cheese swirls (garlic/herb and chives/garlic).  Sometimes I sprinkle fresh chopped jalapeno or roased red peppers on the cream cheese.  I have tried several different hams but prefer the prosciutto to everything else. Excellent recipe to play with a little.

This is an AWESOME recipe! Couldn't find prosciutto first time around, so we used regular ham (which is, of course, thicker) and provolone cheese and it was incredible! We are using it as one of our appetizers at our wedding reception in August!

Even my kids loved this one!  Nice side dish for entertaining. Have also made it without the cheese when in a pinch, but brushed the asparagus with a little olive oil before wrapping.  Worked in the oven, and on the grill.  Thinner asparagus in most tender...adjust your cook time accordingly if your asparagus is especially thick or thin.

BINGO!!!!!! OMG! I have made MANY of the recipes on this website,and I have to say, this is one of my favorites!  I had about 10 people over for a casual dinner and that was the first time I made it. Everyone raved about it! I had so many requests for the recipe and one of my good friends told me today she has made it 4 x's . (it's only been 2 weeks!) I will continue to make this, it is wonderful, easy! I think next time, I might sprinkle some toasted pine nuts on it. I served it with grilled pork roast. YUMMY!!!!

OH WOW!!!  Very GOOD!  I've made this a few times now and it never gets old.  It is the most requested recipe in the house right now.  I do steam the asparagus for a bit before completing the recipe.

This recipe was great!!!!!!!! I spread softened cream cheese on the prosciutto before wrapping the asparagus, which help hold it in place and adds a great flavor to this combination. After making it for my husband(who is not a veggie eater), he asked me to make again. I prepared it in advance, so all I had to do is cook it when the company arrive, and it was a hit - thanks

INCREDIBLE! These were fantastic! Talk about EASY to put together! Used a honey-ham, real cream cheese and pencil-thin fresh asparagus. Patted with olive oil once rolled up and sprinkled garlic salt on top before cooking. I cooked these with another dish at 350 for 45 minutes and they were fine. If you are looking to impress - these will do it! This recipe is what this website is all about - making us look like professional cooks! Thanks for the post!

We are moving and I had already packed my recipe book with this recipe I made last spring. I got a big bunch of asparagus at Sam's and am so thankful that I was able to find this delicious, easy-to-fix recipe.  My husband doesn't care much for asparagus, but he loves it fixed this way.  We make a meal of this with a salad.

Always a hit and gone before anything else.
Personal note here for tracking. 2 bundles of asparagus, 1 brick of cheese, and 3 packages of prosciutto perfectly yields 18 which fit exactly on 1 baking sheet.

These were very tasty, but they were rather time intensive (spreading the cheese on prosciuto slices). I made them to take to a family gathering and they didn't travel well, so best to plan to serve them right away.

Made this for Thanksgiving one year, and I think I ate all of them by myself. People don't seem to like asparagus as much as I do. I usually roast the asparagus and add a balsamic reduction over the top, but this is a good alternative for the holidays.

Easy and very tasty.  I tried it with and without the cheese.  I think the cheese is important to counter the saltiness of the prosciutto.

Loved it! Added a little thick balsamic reduction and a touch of garlic salt. Used a sheet of tinfoil overtop to keep some of the moisture in asparagus. Thanks! Love this recipe!

I took the reviewer's advice and used chive and onion cream cheese, blanched and ice bathed the spears, and brushed the pan and ends of the spears with olive oil and these turned out AMAZING. Served with filet mignon with shrimp cream sauce and fancy roasted baby potatoes for an intimate Christmas dinner for two. Will be making again.

I made this recipe for a family gathering where one family member will not eat pork; I substituted thinly sliced Montreal smoked beef for the prosciutto. I decide to roll the asparagus in a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper since the beef was less fatty then the prosciutto. I then followed the recipe as described. It turned out well with many family members enjoying the dish. The beef did not crisp like the prosciutto, but for non-pork eaters, it worked.

made this dish a couple of days ago.  replaced the Neufchatel with Boursin cheese.  used Boar's Head prosciutto.  baked for only about 7 minutes (the asparagus was thin). everyone loved it.  will be making it again for a party in a couple of weeks.

Very tasty but is on salty side. So as others suggested, I wrapped 3 spears with half a prosciutto slice.

This is wonderful and definitely a hit. My husband loved it and I will serve for an elegant dinner party. 

I added garlic season, onion powder, salt and smoky paprika to the cream cheese for added flavor :-)

This was easy and delicious. I spread prosciutto slices with a thin layer of garlic and herb cream cheese and grilled bundles on a grill mat. Drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  A keeper, and elegant enough for company.

Great recipe! I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and cracked black pepper to the cream cheese. I also drizzled a little olive oil over the veggies before baking too. Pairs well  with cherry tomatoes.

Looking for advice on this recipe! I’ve made this quite a few times as written and loved it! The cheese and prosciutto caramelized and it was amazing! The last couple of times it was good but didn’t caramelize. I’ve tried different types of prosciutto and the cheese and I’ve never been able to recreate it. Any suggestions on what might ‘recreate’ the sweet, salty caramelized deliciousness?

Admittedly, I've had a few drinks, but I have to say, this might be the best thing I've ever tasted and so simple.  I did take other's advice and blanche first.  Thanks you for the super simple easy recipe (and keto friendly!!).

I tried this for the first time as a side dish for Thanksgiving, and I loved it, as did my family.  I didn't have the recipe when shopping, just that I'd heard of asparagus wrapped in prosciutto, so I picked up both and then looked for the recipe after I got home.  Followed the advice of others and blanched the asparagus.  Didn't have Neufchatel cheese, but I did have Laughing Cow light garlic & herb cheese wedges.  Softened up two wedges in the microwave to make them spreadable, and made the recipe that way.  I also sprayed the pan with olive oil spray, and then when all the asparagus was wrapped and in the pan, did a light olive oil spray over that to keep the tips from drying out.  Oh, wow!  And for you weight watchers out there, a bundle  is only 1 smart point!

This my second time making this recipe.   Fries time was at Xmas 2015 and everyone love it.   Now for Father's Day 2016 instead of using regular prosciutto this time I used Smoked.   I did not blanch my asparagus, but did trim the bottoms for presentation .    Best recipe and my favorite one to go to.

I do not like asparagus. Have tried every year for sixty plus years. This year I tried it with this recipe. Wow! Wonderful! I will definitely make this again. I did blanch the asparagus first, and I sprayed my baking dish. Used soft veggie cream cheese.

I have made this a few times now. Just without the cheese. Didn't have any the first time and liked the asparagus the way it was, so that's how I make it. I am sure it would be great with the cheese. I love cheese. Hubby not so much. 
The prosciutto has plenty of flavor and gets nice and crispy in the oven. I think we also have made it on the grill before... just put aluminum foil underneath.

my husband will only eat asparagus if its completely soggy(ewwwww), but I like mine with some crunch. I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect for me. once I finally talked my husband into trying it he had nothing bad to say. definitely adding to the rotation.

My husband and I loved this.  I did blanch the spears for 1 minute and cooled in ice water.  Blotted dry.  Used a bit of regular cream cheese dotted on the prosciutto and sprinkled a bit of herb garlic seasoning on .. then rolled them up and roasted for 14 - 15 minutes.  I used three spears to a bundle.  Will definitely make again.

Yum! I made 4-5 spears per "wrap". Blanched for 2 minutes. Used herb & garlic cream cheese. Sprayed on top and baked on a stone. Easy and elegant side.

Wonderful! What a great dish! I did blanch the asparugus and than plunge into an icebath and drain as another reviewer suggested I also used the chive and onion soft cream cheese as the other reviewer also suggested. Simple, yet elegant!

My husband isn't a fan of asparagus but loved this take on it.  Unable to find the Neufchatel cheese, I used an herb and garlic Alouette spread which gave it a nice tang!  Definitely, brush with olive oil. This side dish is quick, simple, fresh and really dresses up a meal.

Excellent.  The Neuchaftel adds a little extra but main purpose is to hold the prosciutto in place.  Used for shower and it disappeared quickly.

Made this tonight. very simple and amazing. had to sub cream cheese for the neufchantel, unfortunately. Due to availability in my rural area. I also used Soprasata instead of prosciutto to add some peppery flavor.  Definitely worth trying!

I made this recipe and really enjoyed it.  I also used the onion and chive cream cheese which added nice flavor.  If I make this again I would use ham instead of prosciutto so it's less salty.

OMGoodness! So easy and yummy. I have never left a review before but this super easy and yummy recipe earned it. Didn't say how much cheese to use but I used about a tablespoon. Everyone loved it as a side to our Easter meal.

I'm not a big asparagus fan but loved it cooked this way. So easy! My family loved it too. I will try brushing with olive oil next time as the spears were a little dry.

This was really good.  I however like the saltiness and used an extra piece of proscuitto.  I think the next time I will blanch them like others have suggessted.  Also I think I may try to use white asparagus as I do like that better than the green

Didn't have cream cheese so used sliced Muenster. Blanched first then baked about 7-8 minutes. Hubby ate second helping of veggies! That never happens.

Fabulous! I wasn't sure if I would like this, even after it was cooked, but every bite was like heaven. As suggested I blanched the asparagus and added some chives and pepper to the cream cheese. It's a keeper!

I  put some chives and onion cream cheese in the prosciutto before wrapping up the asparagus and this is awesome.  It gives an extra bit of flavor.  No Ned to blanch the asparagus.

This was delicious. I was surprised how salty the prosciutto was once it baked. Glad I didn't add any extra salt. I'll be making this again for sure.

The whole family really enjoyed this.  My husband comments every time I make this, "Why can't the restaurants make asparagus this good?"  Its a quick little side that makes your plate look like a fancy meal!  (I've substituted onion-flavored cream cheese with great success.)

Always blanch spears before roasting to keep color bright green.  
This a great versatile recipe.  I've served it as a side dish with a roast, along side a spring salad with berries, at a brunch with Eggs Benedict and as an appetizer.  

I've used as is many many times.  I've also replaced the cream cheese with a softend strip of provolone and a shmeer of dijon.  
Now, if using the cream cheese, I add fresh chive and parsley, fresh ground black pepper and a pinch of garlic powder or cayenne.   It's also so easy my kids like to prepare it too.

Another twist on this recipe is to use pickled asparagus.  I like to use a good salami spread with cream cheese.  This is a great cold appetizer.

recipe as written was good but salty. Next time, wrap 4-5 asparagus per prosciutto. Or, use a better quality prosciutto or Black Forest Ham thinly sliced per 3 pieces of prosciutto. Also, spray bottom of pan with olive oil spray. Next time, may also be nice to try a chive or onion cream cheese instead of Neuf. cheese, but the 1/3rd less fat Neuf. cheese I used this time was still really good. Only cooked for 8 minutes. Maybe cook for 10 next time and flip bundle halfway through. Excellent recipe!

Used cream cheese.  Super yummy.  Pre-blanched, but do less next time.  Used 3 asparagus per bundle, still quite salty.

This was awesome!  I used cream cheese like other suggestions, but even without cream cheese this has an amazing flavor.  Very quick and easy!

I read the reviews before making this, and decided to blanch the asparagus first and cut the baking time by a few minutes. I also used chive cream cheese, and it was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making this dish again.

This was fabulous! I made this for a Christmas appy and used frozen Asparagus from Aldi and skipped the blanching step. Also, I used Black Forest Ham like someone else suggested! Everyone gobbled them up immediately out of the oven!

Delicious, easy and something all of my guests enjoyed. I used half slices of prosciutto and light cream cheese in a tub. A light trickle of olive oil might have given the spears a more tender bite, and a sprinkle of kosher salt might have been nice. Next time!

Excellent flavor. I didn't have prosciutto, so I used bacon which I partially fried a bit then baked it on a wire rack so the bacon was really crispy. I'll be making them again one day!

I did the whole blanching thing and I received RAVE reviews about how perfectly cooked this was.  only needed one package of costco proscuitto (1 pound I believe) even though I at leastd tripled the recipe.  used almost one whole package of cream cheese.  made at least 15 bundles of 3. (used a thing of costco asparagus)

I made these for our Christmas Eve dinner and it was the first thing we ran out of. I used flavored cream cheese and used it sparingly. The prosciutto was thinly sliced too. This was the perfect side dish, even for non-asparagus eaters. I made them again for dinner guests this week and it was a big hit, again. This will be in my rotation of side dishes from now on. It's simple, yet elegant and delicious.

Easy and impressive!  Made for Christmas brunch and everyone loved them.  The asparagus was on the larger side so I blanched them first to help soften them up a bit.

LOVED these! Made for a Christmas potluck and they were a hit! So elegant to serve but so simple to make. On the advice of others I blanched the asparagus and then used the Laughing Cow Herb and Garlic Cheese. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

I couldn't find any Neufchatel cheese, so I purchased chive and onion cream cheese instead and it worked fine.  Don't use too much prosciutto, and use the recommended 3 spears to each prosciutto or else it will be toooo salty!    I steamed my asparagus for a few minutes before placing in the oven ti soften it up a little bit.  Everyone liked it but remember,3 spears to each slice of prosciutto!

Amazing! I'm in love with asparagus already so I'm always looking or new ways to prepare it. I basically made this exactly as described except I used goat cheese instead of the Neufchatel. I'm pretty obsessed with goat cheese as well as asparagus so it seemed like a no-brainer for me. I have to say it was divine! I'll definitely be making this a regular.

Wow, this is fantastic as an appetizer or a vegetable dinner item!  I read a number of reviews and took their advice.  I cooked the asparagus 2 minutes, blanched in cold water and dried.  Then I decided to cut the appetizer pieces in thirds for easy handling.  I wrapped 3-4 little stalks containing a mix of flowers and stems with a ribbon of proscuitto... that had a thin layer of cream cheese spread on it.  They seemed to stay together nicely and were about two bites each.   I also baked some according to the recipe and they were delicious too.  This is a REAL WINNER.  Thanks for the recipe and all the comments!

My oldest son ate most of them. I baked them a little longer because we like our prosciutto and asparagus really crispy. I tripled the recipe so we had left overs so I wrapped extras in foil and refridgerated them. Every 10 minutes I heard the foil being unwrapped, my son ate the rest cold!

LOVED this recipe!  I made it and brought it over to my boyfriend's parents (nerve-wracking!) and they couldn't stop raving.  It's fun to play around with different cream cheeses, and I always sprinkle garlic powder before rolling up.  I also lightly graze the tips of the asparagus with EVOO.  Could not BE any yummier...thank you!

This recipe is amazing!  Based on other reviews I pre cooked the asparagus for 3 minutes and I used an herb and garlic cream cheese.  My boyfriend said it was without a doubt the best asparagus he's ever had.

Very unique. I really enjoy this appetizer. I would use less prosciutto since it is very salty or substitute a different type of meat.

This is awesome when you use shaved asisgo instead of the creamed cheese. Lay the shaved asiago onto the prosciutto, roll and place on the bbq grill for 10 minutes "rolling" to abtain grill marks. Great presentatio and taste!! You'll be the "Bell of the Ball" at your next party.

I took the advice of blanching the asp first but I also used light cream cheese and green onions.  I was perfect.

This was great. I can't eat pork products so I used thinly sliced mesquite turkey and it tasted great.

This was excellent.  I followed suggestions and blanched the asparagus.  The color was vibrant and the taste delicious.  It is really important to use good quality Prosciutto for this recipe.  I also wrapped bundles of spears in with one slice of prosciutto (4 spears).  i think I could have gotten away with putting a few more spears since they were so thin.   I used softened cream cheese as the filling.   Will definitely make again.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner in an attempt to recreate an hors d'oeuvre from our wedding and while I wasn't impressed with them out of the oven I loved them cold! I did not personally care for the warm prosciutto. It seemed to become almost overly salty. I did what others did and blanched the asparagus first. I would make again but I think I'll leave the oven out of it.

Would you believe this was the first time I have ever eaten asparagus!  My friend raved about the recipe.  I thought it was OK - purchased prime proscuitto, followed the recipe exactly, yet found it somewhat tough to cut through the proscuitto.  I would make it again, on occasion for the presentation.

I followed the cooking time in fact didn't cook them as long and they still came out tough.  I think I'll try again though because all other things considered I like the recipe and it sure is easy.

Great! I followed the advice of others and blanched the asparagus for 1 minute, submerged in ice water, then prepared as directed. Bacon was a tasty replacement for the procsiutto, which isn't available in my rural grocery store.

Really easy. Really good. This is a must have at any party when asparagus is in season. Be sure to buy the thick asparagus as I don't think this would work well with the thin ones. I did this with zucchini (I cut them into wedges) and it turned out great.

I had to modify this recipe because I could not find the Prosciutto or Neufchatel in stores near my home.  I used garlic & chive cream cheese and thin sliced smoked bacon rounds.  It was a huge hit and my friends favorite part of the meal who doesn't even like asparagus.

The prosciutto didn't get cooked fully through even after 20 minutes at 450 and the asparagus was too crispy.

This was very flavorful. The prociutto has a very strong taste and pairs nicely with the asparagus and cheese.

Excellent holiday appetizer!  Added the onion/chive cream cheese and wrapped 2-3 spears per bundle.  So good!

Made this for hubby (I am not a fan of asparagus).  He really seemed to love this.  It looks great and smells fabulous.  I will definatly be making this again.  Thanks for the post.

So Yummy.  I love this recipe.  Took previous suggestion(s) and blanched/ice- bathed the asparagus, used onion/chive cream cheese and drizzled lightly with olive oil.  (For me, this will replace the "sweet green bean bundles" recipe that I make from this site, because this variation is less greasy and perhaps more flavorful that that option.)  A keeper.

Couldn't find neufchatel so used mozzarella and then topped with parmesan. The prociutto was the perfect balance for the asparagus.

I loved this recipe. What an elegant and different side dish or appetizer. The only thing I wasn't keen on was the saltiness of the prosciutto- but that is no fault of the recipe.

These had pretty good flavor.  They made a great side to go with the Chicken Cordon Blue II recipe also found on this site.  The prosciutto was very difficult to work with, however, being that it is typically sliced so thin.  I ended up slicing each piece of prosciutto down the middle and only using half on each piece of asparagus.  I used a garlic and herb cheese spread which gave it great flavor.

SUPER!  Can't ask for a better tasting or looking side dish to any meal.  I made it for our New Year's Dinner and everyone raved over it.  I made it as directed.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I have to bring this to EVERY gathering.  The guests love it and it's always gone before dinner is served.
