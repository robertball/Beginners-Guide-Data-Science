This sounded like the perfect crumble for Fall! It seemed like 1/4 cup of sugar when using an entire bag of fresh cranberries seemed like it would be a little too tart for our taste, so, I upped the sugar on the fruit to between 1/2-3/4 cup.  I am glad I did because it was the perfect amount of sweetness for me.  My husband still thought it was a little tart.  I prepared the rest of the recipe as is.  It wasn't a traditional crumble.  Using an egg in the crumble made it more cakey against the fruit, but, I liked it that way.  I did think the use of the white sugar in the crumble made the top too crunchy.  I also think it could have used some extra cinnamon in the topping.  With a few tweaks, I think this would be a delicious crumble.

I thought this was delicious fresh out of the oven. I skipped the nuts and increased the 1/4 cup of sugar to 1/3 cup to help cut the tartness of the fresh cranberries.

The topping was certainly not "crumbly" - it baked up and tasted like a crisp cookie. Not at all what I expected or wanted. Filling was good.
Update 11/13/18 - Add a star! Was m-u-c-h better the next day, chilled! The topping softened a bit and became really yummy.
I'll now make this again and try some variations - pecans rather than walnuts, maybe a touch of orange zest or oil. (King Arthur Flour has orange, lemon and lime oils. Pricey but but worth it. Also try their Fiori di Sicilia - a blend of vanilla & citrus. My "secret ingredient" in many things.) Soak the raisins a little to plump them up.
Definitely a thumbs up. Not 5 Stars because you have to wait a day to eat it.

Overall, this was very good.  It was a little tart, and I will increase the sugar next time.  Based on what others said about the crust being cakey, I eliminated the egg and increased the butter to 1/2 c, cutting it into the other ingredients cold rather than melted.  It turned out sweet, golden and crisp.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for thanksgiving as a different twist on cranberries.   I will make it again but I definitely will add more sugar to the cranberry and apples.   I didn't add raisins because we don't care for them, otherwise I followed the recipe.   too tart and the top was hard and crunchy,  not crumbly at all.  I will adjust the topping next time too.
