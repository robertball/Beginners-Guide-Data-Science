I did make this using real crab from a can and the entire thing is only 3 net carbs without a bun. It wasn't bad. I ate it plain but it would probably be better on some good keto bread.

Loved it! Instead of celery I used celery seeds. Delish!

This was absolute heaven served on a grilled buttered roll.  I omitted the green peppers (personal preference) and used green onions.  The celery adds a nice crunch.  This is a keeper.
