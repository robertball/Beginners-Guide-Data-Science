This has become one of our favorites in the house.  It is simple and basic in flavors, but absolutely delicious.  The only thing different I do is to cut the butter in half and it still turns out creamy.  And the paprika is definitely a must, just like Baking Nana said. Thank you Lilly for this 10 star recipe!

This really surprised me.  It is very good.  The only thing I did different was to season each layer of potatoes with salt and pepper& paprika - the paprika is NOT optional, at least in my opinion.    Next time and YES, there will be a next time I might add some dried chives to the layers.  Thanks - this was a tasty addition to our St. Patrick's Day dinner.

Very bland, tasted them after baking and added cheddar cheese just to give them more flavor.  I have other recipes similar to this one that I prefer.  Thanks Allrecipes for your website.  I will still be trying your recipes.

My mother always made these and now I make them all the time! So easy and simple to make. I have made them with canned evaporated milk and shredded frozen hash brown potatoes and we thought they were just as good. If you use canned milk just keep in mind that it gives it a slighty different taste. My hubby actually likes them better with canned milk. These are a good side dish with just about anything but I always make these with meatloaf.

Made this for 6 adults, and this disappeared, nothing is left - it was a huge hit!  I followed the advice of adding paprika with each layer, which worked out great.  It's basic in flavors, which is why it's so good.  The only thing I might do a bit different next time would be to very lightly sauté the onions before layering the dish.  Thanks, I will definitely be making this again!

I made this dish in honour of St.Patrick's Day. It was quite delicious! I added garlic salt to one layer and I substituted the whipping cream (as I didn't have any) with cream cheese, thinning it with a few tablespoons of milk. I was enjoyed by all!

I thought this was delicious and paired with a lean protein and some other veggies, isn't that out of line for a dinner as far as calories.

This is such a lovely and simple side dish. As others suggested, I sprinkled each layer with salt, pepper, paprika and minced fresh chives. YUMMMY!

These were delicious!  Made them exactly as recipe stated.  Next time I’ll use the Simply Potatoes hash browns instead of all of the work grating potatoes. I cooked them a bit too long and ended up adding some extra half and half.  Mixed it all up and popped it back in the oven for a few minutes while steaks were finishing on the grill.  We loved these!

It was SO bland. I added extra onion and seasoned every layer with parsley, salt, and pepper. I also added crushed red pepper and chives just because I enjoy big flavor and it seemed a bit light. Still after the first bite I realized this just didn't work, it just wanted something, It felt very unfinished my husband and kids felt the same way. Since I had tons leftover the next day I decided to try a couple options to save it since I hate waste. I added cheese, garlic powder, and more red pepper and baked it until cheese melted, it helped a bit. I also flattened them into patties and added garlic salt and fried them in butter, that was the best save and actually very good but this recipe is still not worth making again in my house.

I made as directed and they came out perfect, although it never did bubble as the recipe stated.   My family thoroughly enjoyed this dish.   When I make again, I will be increasing the amount of onions, otherwise I will leave it as is.   Thanks!

This is really good! Nice basic flavors, which make it a comforting dish. Only changes I make are using sweet onions, and adding a little cheddar cheese on top. Thanks!
