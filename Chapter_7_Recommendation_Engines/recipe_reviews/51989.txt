There's a reason these things are fried and now I know why....I even tried to cook these two different ways: folded in a triangle and in a mini muffin tin. I turned up the oven and even sprayed a little Pam on them. They were hard and overly crispy on the ends and yet seemingly undone in the middle. There was no way to salvage these. The filling however is actually very good, but I used real crab vs. imitation and green onion as it's milder in flavor. This is definitely a case where I should have paid attention to the lower ratings.....

I halved the recipe since there were only three of us.  Also, I lined a mini cupcake pan with the wonton wrappers then filled them so they were like little cups.  The filling was outstanding.  I'm suprised I had enough because mu hubby kept stealing bites.  Will make these again.  I am only rating a 4 since I didn't make exactly as directed.

I made these as written.I've never made any kind of these before. Next time I would put a little less sugar [it does state'to taste'] With the not frying thou, I don't no, there a little chewy. I had to put the broiler on to get them to brown a little bit. Good flavor, had enough filling for wonton wrapers.

Fantastic recipe.  This recipe would work with salmon, crab, shrimp or anything else.  The cream cheese and sour cream combination is perfect for flavor.   I read other reviews and people said they didn't come out crispy or they weren't like fried wontons. I disagree! I did NOT spray the cookie sheet and I did NOT add any spray/oil to the wontons before baking.  I put mine in the oven for 12 minutes on 400, they were very crispy and delicious!   I will make these again.

These taste great - the filling really does taste like what you could get in a restaurant.  While I like the healthier baked option, the texture is very different - didn't even crisp when I sprayed them with cooking spray.  Maybe if they were broiled for a few minutes...  I added more green onion than called for and included some of the green tops to add more colour. Really tasty overall.

Good crab rangoon without all the calories of fried crab rangoon.  This was my first attempt at making rangoons.  This recipe is very easy to work with and it makes a lot.  I made a half batch with fat-free cream cheese and it made 30+ rangoons.  I think nothing can compare to a "fried" crab rangoon, but this was very good and I most definitely will be making them again.  I added some fresh chives in the cream cheese mixture.  I baked on parchment paper rather than spraying a cookie sheet.  Mine came out nice and crispy.  To keep my edges from getting hard, I folded them up and attached to the seams with water.  I used a pastry brush dipped in water rather than my fingers.  This method just seemed to go faster.  Thanks Laura for a sharing a recipe that was a nice compliment to another AR recipe - Pork Fried Rice for Two.

I have been making a filling like this for years.  It is very delicious.  I use canned crabmeat and not the immitation one and I use low-fat cream cheese and sour cream. However, I put the filling in mini phyllo cups and bake. Very delicious. Way less calories than frying.

I thought the flavor on these was very good. I made them in an attempt to recreate the crab wontons at Pei Wei as my daughter loves them. They are VERY simple to make and they crisped up *fairly* well in the oven...I just know that the texture of the fried ones is so much better. Since this isn't something we'll make frequently, I think I'll try pan frying them in a bit of oil next time...just to see if we can get the texture a little crunchier. I also used green onion instead of regular onion. Served them with a sauce of orange marmalade, chili-garlic sauce and a splash or two of rice wine vinegar...very tasty. Thanks for a good recipe.

These were delicious! I placed them in muffin trays and cooked them for 10 min at 350 and then broiled for 5 min. It made them nice and crispy. I also folded mine in a wonton style and used light cream cheese and added green onions instead of reg. Mmmm hit at the party!

Fantastic no-fry recipe! Making small 'goons and with the lighter versions of cream cheese and sour cream mine came to 55 cal each. Deep fried are yummy but we're off all deep fried foods for now. My husband says he likes these baked rangoons better than the deep fried local Chinese places because the crab flavor is the top note rather than grease or sugar. We prefer them as snacks without sauce. I enjoy finding healthy recipes and regularly makeover otherwise unhealthy-for-us recipes, so we never feel as if we're missing anything. Thanks so much!

The filling was good. I knew it wouldn't be as good as a fried one but  I was disappointed that the centers  of the wontons didn't crispt up, even after I added a few minutes under the broiler.  I will experiment next time using a spray of oil over the wonton before cooking or trying to bake them in mini muffing cups to see if that helps.

Crab Rangoon is one of my favorite foods and I think this recipe is almost as good as my favorite restaurant. The filling is really,really yummy!!! I did add a dash of soy sauce. I will  never make this recipe again though... I hate making wontons! Worst cooking task EVER! I love the chef at my local place even more having made them myself! I ended up folding them into rectangles and it was somewhat easier. I wouldn't bake them again either. The texture wasn't the best even trying all of the tips from other reviewers. They need some grease :-) I still have half a batch of filling and will  just heat it and use it as a dip because I never want to fill a wrapper again! But if you are patient and can make 48 you should because the flavor is fantastic!

These were ok, too much garlic in my opinion.  And it would be so much better if they were deep fried but trying to keep very low fat so it was ok.  I may make these again trying just a pinch of the garlic.

Wonton wrappers are not meant to be baked. They come out of the oven burnt on the edges and barely palatable, and extremely chewy. It doesn't take much to fry them....I do not own a fryer so I simply put some oil in my skillet and cooked them on each side until they were golden brown and crispy-as wontons should be.

This recipe was so tasty.  I loved the innards of the wonton.  Mine came out very crispy on the edges, so in the future I might brush with a bit of oil and broil them instead.

this a great, quick way to make these at home. the filling will keep for a day or two in the fridge and my husband loves them enough that I make a full batch for him to snack on a couple nights in a row. The changes I made are to spray them with a bit of cooking spray before oven. and if I want the wrappers to be crispier I will use mini muffin tins to place the wrappers in, lightly spray with cooking spray, oven for a couple minutes, then fill and return to oven to finish baking. the filling is visible this way but they are crispier

These taste very close to the ones available at a local buffet. I thought the onion was a bit overwhelming -- next time I'll cut back to maybe 1 or 2-teaspoons, finely minced. I made two batches -- one with crab, and one without. Either way they tasted good. You MUST squeeze out all the air and seal well, or the filling will leak out. I think if you stuck a pin in the middle of each one before baking, the filling wouldn't leak out. I sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray before baking. They would be awesome if deep fried.

I used half the sugar and 3/4 of the garlic powder.  This was still way too much garlic.  The wonton wrappers corners should be folded under to help keep from over browning.

I experimented with both baked & fried versions. The fried version was definitely more crispy but we enjoyed the baked version as well. But I think the ingredient measurements are WAY off because I have a ton of the filling left. It's delicious just wasn't expecting left overs.

I was so excited about these, but they were disappointing. Nothing like the restaurant crab wontons, but of course these aren't fried. I didn't like the filling very much...too much sugar and not enough spices. Real crab meat might have made them a little better, too.

Wonton wrappers do not bake well. The taste was good but they were very hard and unpleasant to eat. I ended up just eating the filling by itself. I will make these again...but I will fry them.

I made this with a gluten free wrapper. The filling totally tasted great. I did add scallions in addition to some chopped onions, a dash of lemon juice, a dash of pepper, and I backed off on some of the garlic. I also used fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese. This was amazing! Tomorrow I'm going to make it with parmesean cheese and spinach as a crab dip. YUM!

This was a great recipe.  I also checked out other ragoon recipes and found that they also used about 1/2 tsp of soy sauce.  This made it not as sweet, but instead had a little more body.  I also read that everyone loves them fried rather than baked so I did 1/2 and 1/2.  The baked ones were a little chewy, but frying these makes a mess.  But I must say, the fried were better.

Try to buy fresh wonton wrappers (from an Asian grocer...they are only about $1.49 for a large stack and far superior to the ones at the regular grocer). They make for thinner wrappers - but this recipe is a keeper. Tweak it for whatever you have on hand, and do spray your oil on them to help them crisp. I'm really into potstickers,so I'm used to browning/steaming...but for an app - you do want  to bake them - it's better than frying.

These turned out perfect! I made a sweet version mixing some brown sugar with cream cheese. After it was finished backing, I sprayed it with butter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top. SO GOOD.

These were good.  I haven't had any sort of crab rangoon before.  I can see they would be better deep fried since baking them couldn't cook them as evenly.  I didn't like how the pinched tops got all crispy and hard, and the bottom/sides were still soft.  The filling was delicious!  I'd probably serve that with crackers or pita chips!

The filling is AWESOME (used 1/2 onion in chopper doodle and 1 TBS sugar)  Would use as cracker spread or over noodles, but the wontons crunchy and yucky, didn't like the rangoons, just the filling!  And I had a lot of filling left after making 48 rangoons.

As good as it gets without the fat of a deep frying! Really tasty. I suggest halving the recipe unless you're preparing for a crowd. It makes a lot! Use reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream, mince the onions very finely, chop up the crab or mix it in with electric beaters. Good amount of crab to cream cheese ratio.

This recipe is great. I halved the recipe and it made 24. Only other change I made was that I fried them.

I made 3 batches of this recipe for my daughter who had a pot luck at school. The first without the seafood and 2 with seafood. While it was a big hit, I agree not frying them do make the wrappers a bit hard in places and chewy in others, we had quite a lot of filling leftover. That is quite good and I may just use the filling recipe in the future to serve with pita chips as I did with our leftover filling. For this, I consider this recipe a good find!

The filling is great minus the imitation crab meat.  I used only 8oz. of imitation crab and all I could taste was a plasticy flavor.  However, I tasted the filling before putting the imitation crab in it and it was too die for.  Just curious if anyone else has had a problem with imitation crab tasting like plastice?  I will definitely rate this a five because, afterall, it's not your fault that the imitation crab was awefull...lol  Thanks for posting your recipe.

I made this recipe exactly to the recipe, except instead of baking I fried them. The only thing I didn't like was that the garlic powder was a bit overwhelming, and I would use a little more sour cream.

I was skeptical of the idea of "no fry" crab cheese wontons! They didn't get crispy AT ALL! I let them cook longer than listed and then they just burned but still were not crispy!! In addition the sugar that is listed ruined the filling! Wish I would have stuck to my regular fried method!

The filling is really good but the wraps just didn't do it for us. Maybe we're used to Chinese restaurant style. They just didn't have that crunch. Plus, if I would've known how many this actually makes, I would've halved it, but that was my mistake. These weren't terrible, they were just ok.

So good! The garlic gave it a zingy heat and the sugar balanced it right out. The addition of the sour cream made it rich and creamy. This is a keeper for sure!

These turned out wonderful! I did cut the recipe in half (it still made a TON of ragoons) I turned the oven to 400 and did not spray butter on the pan or on the ragoons. They browned wonderfully and only needed to be cooked about 5 mins (until the tips of the wraps turned golden brown) of course they are not going to taste fried because they aren't but in both my and my husbands opinion they taste MUCH better than the fried ones ;0) I also used fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream and you would never know ;0) I new all time favorite :)) Thank you!

I made these according to the recipe with the exception of subbing green onions for the usual variety.  I even used low fat cream cheese and sour cream, and for this "healthy" baked version, I thought they were awesome!  I baked at 375 rather than 350 for 15 minutes and the edges crisped up nicely.  They obviously weren't crispety crunchety like the deep fried variety, but being rescued from a dozen grams of fat was worth it!  Dipped them in the Sweet & Sour Sauce I from this site.  YUM.

i dont know WHAT went wrong when i made these but the ends came out super hard and crunchy, my boyfriend said we shouldve buttered the outside before putting them in the oven BUT i would say going to cupcake tin way is MUCH better in the future i am going to be doing it that way. I enjoyed the filling a lot though :) very good just crunchy outside layer was not so nice :)
