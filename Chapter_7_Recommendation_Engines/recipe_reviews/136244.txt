I thought this sounded different from fried fish so I gave it a go.  The end result was very tasty but it was a bit messy looking, the crumb coating didn't stick to the fish very well.  I will try it again but add some egg to the mayo before coating and heat the baking tray before putting the fish on.  Tasted great though and much healthier than fried fish.

I didn't love this recipe. The potatoes are tasty, but the fish is just kind of blah.

This was my first attempt at fish and chips and it'll definitly won't be the last time. It was SOOOOOOOOO GOOD! Thanks for such a great recipe!
