I followed this recipe exactly except for the heavy cream. I substituted 1 can of cream of chicken soup for the heavy cream and it turned out great. My husband commented on the meal and my 3-year-old and 5-year-old ate it all. I served the chicken with a side of rice pilaf and LeSeur peas.

I have to say I was disappointed with this recipe.  The plus side was that the chicken was very tender, I'll give it that.  What I was picturing when I looked at the ingredients was chicken with an alfredo-y sauce on it, but I have to say it tasted very bland.  I would say the dish certainly is not worth all the fat in it.  I would rather make alfredo by itself which is much tastier.  If I did make this again I would definitely add garlic powder, and probably some other spices with it.  The recipe is a good starter but it isn't very tasty at the moment.  Sorry to be a downer!

This is a great easy recipe. I followed "gatorgirl"'s advice and substituted a can of cream of chicken for the half and half. I also added two cloves of minced garlic to add some flavor. This is a great recipe and my family loved the dish.

This dish was really fabulous!! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because it is a little cream-heavy on the taste. I would probably add a little more lemon juice and maybe some garlic next time.

WOW! DELISH! I made this recipe but not to the T. I was very generous with Parmesan Cheese. I also added garlic powder and doubled the recipe. I served it with brown rice and it was good I served it again the next night over whole grain penne pasta. GREAT! Will cook this again! My husband was very pleased!

A nice easy basic recipe. I chopped the leftover chicken and stuffed Peppy's Pita Bread (from this site) with the chicken sauce and a bit of rice. Wrapped them in foil in the refrigerator and heated them up at 350 for 15-20 minutes. My husband begged for the sandwiches for all three meals today!

This is a pretty good recipe. Im giving it 4 stars based on the orginal directions. I did cook the sauce seperate to be sure this would be something my family would eat and i did have to modify after tasting. I brown the chicken in a pan first then added the cream and some cheese. Its very heavy on the cream taste and not much else. I added a little melted butter chopped sweet onion garlic and 2 tablespoons chicken stock and that helped get rid of the milk taste. I also used some garlic powder and onion powder on the chicken with salt and pepper and seasoned the flour. will make this again but too heavy for weekly rotation. Very glad I tried this Thank you snowgirl9!

Wonderful recipe! This is something I will certainly add to our regular rotation. I usually find myself adding or taking away something from an ingredient list right off the bat but this is great as is. The chicken was so tender and moist and the sauce was excellent. The only thing I would add is a little bit of grated parmesan cheese to the top of the chicken before coating and also a sprinkle of fresh parsley on top of the chicken when it comes out of the oven for both flavor and aesthetics since the chicken and the sauce is pale. This is such a yummy recipe and the leftovers held up fine and tasted great! Thanks so much for sharing!

I hate to admit it but I messed up this recipe. Did you ever start to make something and when you are in the middle of it you didn't have as much of the ingredient as you thought? I didn't have enough parmesan however the dish was wonderful. If you like a creamy moist chicken dish you should try this. I did add some chopped garlic rosemary and lemon zest because others said it was too bland but it would be great as written. This recipe is a keeper.

I thought this was a very good meal. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. The chicken was tender and moist. I just wish there had been more sauce to put over my noodles so next time I think I'll just add a little more cream.

We love this recipe! It has actually become my husband's favorite and he requests it all the time. I found this recipe when I was looking for a recipe I could use some leftover heavy cream with and it was perfect. I always serve it with rice. We've also tried egg noodles but didn't like it as much. The only change I've made is I usually add an extra cup of cream. It's delicious!

This was just OK for us. Used Cream of Chic soup instead of cream. IF I would make again would add garlic and basil. Only tasted white sauce. Sorry.

For Valentine's Day I wanted to do something different for my wife and family so I decided to make dinner - something I haven't done in a long time (and even then it was rare!). This recipe looked great so I decided to give it a shot. It turned out great and my wife and I really thought it was delicious! Its pretty simple and it really impresses.

OMG. This was sooo good.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley and a touch of rosemary to the flower.  Did not have lemon juice, so I had to do without.    I did use three times the paprika (I’m Hungarian, that’s just what we do).   Very easy to make.  Chicken was very moist.  This will be my “go to” meal.

This was great. I made this the other night and my boyfriend and my parents loved it. It was easy fast and tender. I served it over egg noodles I did make 2 changes though instead of heavy cream I actually used a can of cream of mushroom soup and added peas to it which made it GREAT.

This was good I made it as is (might have added more seasonings I'm terrible about doing that subconsciously). I served it over white rice and spooned out some of the liquid on top of it. Not an award winner for me but it was worth making.

I have been looking for a creamy chicken recipe for awhile now. And i think this is the perfect one. I did tweak it a little. I followed a couple other people's suggestions and here is what I came up with. I seasoned the chicken with onion powder garlic powder and s&p. I added a couple of dashes of paprika to the flour. I sauteed 1/2 onion and 1 garlic clove in a little butter for 2 mins. Then I added a 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the onions and garlic and cooked it for another 2 mins. Add chicken stock mixture to heavy cream in a bowl. I also added extra parm cheese and about a 1/2 cup of shredded Italian 5 cheeses on top. This all was topped on egg noodles. Soo yummy!!!

This was amazing and so easy to make! I did make a few changes because I didn't have heavy cream or cream of chicken soup. I used cream of celery soup added chicken bullion and 1/2 of water. Served over spaghetti noodles. My children kept telling how good it was! will definately make this again

I've made this twice now. Chicken gets very tender and there's a nice subtle taste of lime. Cream makes it a very rich dish however.

wow. I added garlic and cilantro and this became an awesome mexican-style dish. The idea to cook in cream saved chicken breasts for me. I thought I would never get them to come out tender but this recipe worked great! I warmed up a diced tomato/ green chile mix (just some straight from the can rotel) and put it on top of the chicken to give it some color and served with spicy rice.

This was very good but I did make a few exceptions just because it seemed too basic. I used some onion powder on the chicken. Sauteed some mushrooms with some garlic added a small can of peas (for color) and used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream to cut down on the fat a bit. I think even if I had stayed true to the recipe it still would have been very good because the simple changes I made weren't a huge deterrent from the recipe. I put this over some Penne pasta and really wish I had doubled the sauce because it was not "saucy" enough. Overall this is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I tried to make the recipe for two but failed to cut the heavy cream down to 1/2 cup. I used a full cup so it came out tasting a lot like heavy cream. Next time I will pay more attention to the measurements. I am still giving it 4 stars because it was my mistake and I know if I had measured right it would be awesome! I'll make this again soon the right way and rate it again...

Very good easy recipe. I have a habit of putting minced garlic in everything...so I did add some to this recipe as well. I also followed others and had used cream of chicken soup instead of the heavy whipping cream. Will be making again.

Yup this is a keeper. Made it pretty much as written though I added some Italian spices to the flour. Very easy relatively quick and made a nice sauce for pasta

Very simple and tasty we used coconut flour instead of regular flour and added some garlic powder... I think this dish would freeze very well. Will definitely try the chicken soup modification.:)

I made it the way that is in here and it came out delicious I just would recommend to bake at least for 15 more minutes to cook properly cook the chicken

This was a great recipe -- easy to make with extra ingredients laying around and my VERY picky eater son absolutely loved it. Maybe not the healthiest recipe out there but it's very tasty. Served with Basmati Brown Rice Pilaf and steamed green beans.

I've made this twice in the last two weeks. My kids just love it. They had friends over the last time I made it and I was afraid there wouldn't be any left for my husband and I. It got devoured. Definitely not low fat but worth the splurge once in a while.

I followed the advice of others and used cream of chicken. One can for 2 lbs of chicken breast worked out wonderfully. Also added minced garlic. This recipe is delicious! A little bit of citrus (in my case a lot might have used too much lemon but I like it) creamy without being heavy and very yummy. I'm saving this one for sure.

I browned the chicken a tad after coating in flour and butter and sprinkled garlic powder and a little sea salt over the chicken before poring cream mixture on top. Also since I'm cooking for a crew (even if I don't really need to... Ya know in case someone shows up around supper time) I made it with heavy cream and cream of chicken. I used paprika and dried parsley on top for garnish and plated over a bed of fettuccine.

Really good base recipe. Although I added garlic powder and red pepper flakes and it was amazing!

Dredged chicken in flour with salt and pepper, sauteed in butter with a little oil in iron skillet with onion.  Poured half and half over top, added shredded cheddar and cooked in oven for about 10-15 minutes.  Served with angel hair pasta.
