I make this every winter and follow the recipe exactly. It’s amazing and sooo addictive. The caramel popcorn is so light and basically melts in your mouth like cotton candy.  I keep the broken up chunks in the freezer until I’m ready to serve them because it keeps everything crisp, crunchy, and delicious. I think this is the problem a different reviewer had who said it was chewy. Just follow the recipe exactly, keep it in an airtight container in the freezer, and it’s one of the most amazing snacks you’ll have for the holidays.

I made it today but it turned out soft and chewy. Never had that issue before. It does taste good, though.

I made this with my mom and I liked it.
