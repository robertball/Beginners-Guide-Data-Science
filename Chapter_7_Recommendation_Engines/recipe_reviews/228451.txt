One of the best things I have ever made.  One thing that I changed is that I cooked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and 10 minutes at 400 degrees just to brown the top. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

This was delicious... it turned out way better than I ever imagined. I did add crispy french onions on the top and  I think it added great taste and texture to this dish. The family loved it.

Made this last night, with a few adjustments. Added 4oz softened cream cheese to the mayo, and 1/4 cup milk. I also used boneless chicken thighs cut into chunks and omitted the mushrooms. Threw in some egg noodles and made it into a casserole. Wish I had used a little more garlic, but other than that, it was awesome! My family loved it too. Definitely going to make it again. Maybe add some spinach too next time.

I agree with most reviewers that a recipe should be made first and then reviewed.  However, based upon other reviews I decide this dish need a little more flavoring.  I took others suggestions and used a 1/4 c is cream cheese, 1/2 cup greek yogurt, 1/2 cup grated parmesan and 1/4 cup of mayonnaise.  I mixed these ingredients together and added a small amount of freshly grated nutmeg.  I sauteed half a chopped onion and the added a 10z package of chopped spinach and two freshly minced garlic cloves.  Once cooled, I added the spinach and onion mixture to the cream cheese mixture.  I chopped the chicken (I brined the chicken first for about 4-6 hours) and added the chicken to the mixture.  I poured the mixed into a baking dish sprays with Pam and then added more grated parmesan cheese on top.  Then baked following the directions.  This was a fabulous dish I served with freshly baked french bread.

I made this just as written and it was really good. I made it better for me by making another version - used low cal cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic instead of mayo, used cheddar instead of parm, used jarred regular sliced mushrooms and added French onions on top. I must say I loved it more.

I thought this tasted great! I love these ingredients together so I'm glad I tried it even though it hadn't been reviewed by more than one person. I followed exact recipe except that I cooked on a bed of rice. Delicious!

This was a great starting point. I added cooked ribbon noodles to the ingredients to make it more of a casserole. I also substituted the mayo with condensed cream of mushroom soup. I added chopped broccoli as well and topped it with French-fried onions.  I know I made it into a new recipe, but I was grateful for the ideas in the original recipe and rate those with FIVE STARS.

I made this tonight and it was great! After reading the reviews, I subbed the mayo with cream cheese and added a package of frozen spinach. Omitted the mushrooms, since I'm not a fan. Since some reviewers had mentioned it was runny, I put layer of cooked rice on the bottom of the casserole dish. Then I topped with raw chicken, then the cheese/veggie mix on top. So good!

The flavor of the dish is excellent. I cubed the chicken because I hate cooking chicken breasts because the thin part is over cooked and the thick half is undercooked. The dish came out a bit watery. Next time I'm going to precook the chicken and just hear the topping over it. I also used half mayo and half sour cream. I also added fresh spinach. I will make it again with a bit more tweaking.

We really liked this dish a lot, and it gets bonus points because it's super quick and easy!  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream instead of all mayo. Besides adding 1/2tsp. of garlic powder, I also put in 2tsp. TJ's seasoning salute. Baked for 40 min because of really thick chicken breasts.

This was tasty! I've made artichoke chicken MANY times and really enjoyed the addition of the mushrooms. Mine took a little longer to cook than stated, but my breasts were pretty thick. I think next time I would layer the chicken w/ the mushrooms and then mix the artichokes in w/ the mayo mixture, just because, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this dish FANTASTIC!!!!! Everyone including my 5 year old grandson loved it. The only change I used marinated artichokes drained but mixed the liquid with the mayo & cheese  . I cut the chicken breasts to look like tenderloins. Easier serving & eating!

I made this for supper and my husband and myself loved it. I would make again. The only thing I would change is if the chicken breast is  thick I would cut in half.  The leftovers  are good too.

Excellent recipe.  Really quick and the whole family enjoyed it.  We cut back a little on the mayo and did add French Fried Onions to the top for the crunch.  We served it with Parmesan Orzo and a green salad.  Easy week night meal and good enough for company!

This was excellent. Good Flavor.  Warning: the above directions do not state if you should cover or not. DO NOT COVER!  This tasted excellent but looked awful.  Next time I will not cover as it had one other side effect, which was it turned out a tad watery.  Overall excellent recipe & very easy which tired mommy enjoys!  I ended up dicing my chicken and adding 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream as other reviewers stated the mayo taste was too strong.  I also used fresh garlic & added a bit of pepper.  No salt however because Parmesan already tastes salty.  It was all gone with no leftovers so that's always welcome!  Will make again - with no tin foil over top next time.

Wow, I can't believe this was so good! I did make some personal preference changes, which I know makes some people lose their minds, but too bad.  I added some chopped spinach and I added minced garlic with the mayo/parm cheese mixture instead of garlic salt.  This is in no way a low calorie dinner but it is super easy to throw together and it is so delicious.  Its definitely going into our regular rotation.

Parents liked it, kids didn't.  It took 50 minutes to cook the chicken (hard- with a crying hungry family that expected 30 minutes to dinner).  At 30 minutes the chicken was hardly cooked. I cut up the chicken and but it back for another 20 minutes.  Next time I'll cut it up before I put it in the oven in the first place.

Planning on making it again soon. We chopped up chicken into small pieces and cooked before adding to casserole to try and prevent it from having too much water. I almost would go with more artichoke hearts. Soooo good over pasta!

This is now on the must have menu! I, like others, did 4 ounces of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of mayo. I use Costco marinated artichoke hearts. I also topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so used canned. I also added marinated sun-dried tomatoes (also from Costco and made locally). Served on a bed of egg noodles and since there was a good bit of juice in the bottom of the pan I poured that over the egg noodles. Super easy to make. 2 thumbs up!

UPDATE: I made this using 8 ounces of cream cheese and 8 ounces of sour cream (instead of the cream cheese/mayo mix). HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I upped the amount cause we LOVE the extra sauce over the egg noodles.

made a smaller version using leftover rotisserie chicken taken off the bone.  I added some leftover asparagus and chopped onion.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream thinned out with 1/4 cup milk.  Melted cheese in the sauce then poured over the chicken, asparsgus, and artichokes.  Flavor was wonderful, but the sauce did separate slightly.  I will have to play around with the sauce, but will definitely make thisnagain.

This was beyond delicious. I recently discovered I like artichokes so I got some cans of them. Wasn't sure what I was going to make until I found this recipe. I had all the ingredients so thought I'd give it a shot. Thank god I did!! I only had regular mayo so used that I stead of light mayo. I don't like mushrooms so I omitted those. Took someone else's suggestion and added French fried onions on top. I could eat this every night it was so good. It was also so easy! I like dishes where I don't have to sauté something on the stove then bake then blah blah blah. This you literally just prepare the chicken, mix up the sauce, put it all in a dish, and bake for 30 minutes. Would be great for company too. I thought it looked very pretty. Next time may try spinach like someone else suggested. Awesome recipe! Thanks!!!

EXCELLENT!!  So much flavor with so few ingredients.  Definitely my favorite chicken recipe.  Super quick and easy to make.  May have to bake a little longer if your chix breasts are large.

This was a HUGE HIT!!! I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added Cream cheese to the recipe. I also topped with Parmesan Cheese and put in under broiler for five minutes to get a crusty layer.

This was an easy and yummy meal. I will cut back on the cheese next time but other than that very good. Chicken comes out super moist.

Fair warning to everyone if you double the recipe; it is very wet. Pretty much everything in this meal sweats more than a herd of New Year's resolution goers at their first gym day. it's really fine if you don't mind fishing the chicken breasts out of a flavor lagoon. And no I didn't pour the jar of artichokes in with its water. I also had to cook it twice because after the first 30 minutes of cooking, I found the chicken was still entirely raw and  pink even though they were nearly room temperature going in the oven. Despite the flood and the mutant breed of heat resistant chicken, it was still very tasty.

I didn't like this.  Love all the ingredients & made basically as instructed (but 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream).  Not much flavor and too watery.  Served w/ Orzo & Broc.  Not sure I'll try again....maybe w lots of tweaking.  Bummer- wanted to love it.

Very easy but a bit rich. I added spinach to the mix and spread over the chicken. That was a nice touch.

OK - thanks All Recipes.com.  I made this.  Due to a few review comments and my own "intuition ". I made a few changes:  I partially precooked 4 boneless chicken breasts for 5 minutes and cubed.  Put all ingredients together and added cooked noodles, 4 oz. each of cream cheese, sour cream, and milk.  Turned casserole into bakers and cooked for 40 minutes.  One word:  YUM !  Deb from MI

Super-easy with great flavor.  I have made this recipe twice now and will keep it in my family's rotation.  I love the flavors of artichoke, mushroom and cheese, it is delicious.  The difficulty I am having is that it comes out with a lot of liquid on the bottom of the pan (I am using regular mayo.)  I may try with less mayo next time.

The recipe was good if you like artichokes, but itis more of an adult meal than for the family.  As others said, definitely double the sauce.

Similar to the Hellman's parmesan crusted chicken recipe except for the artichokes and mushrooms. But the Hellman's recipe calls for seasoned breadcrumbs sprinkled on top and that makes all the difference!

I made this for dinner for 4 guest and myself and they loved it and so did I. I made enough for 8 and froze the leftovers in individual servings. It was easy to thaw and heat in the microwave and was just as delicious as when it was made. The modifications I made were: half sour cream & half mayo, instead of light mayo; added one 4 oz can of mild green chiles; did not use mushrooms.

This dish went over great! I had a small problem where towards the end of cooking it was soupy. I drained and cooked it down then returned to dish. It was great. Could have been that the chicken had been filled with water.

This is really, really good. But you know what, it's even better the next day (leftovers). I forgot to get the mushrooms but I did have 2 cans of artichoke hearts. I will definitely make this again and again, though not too often since it's kinda rich.  The orzo past suggestion was awesome. I put sautéed broccoli rabe on the plate next to it and the pairing worked well with some artisanal bread.

Flavorful and delicious.  I made a few changes.  Drained, squeezed and diced a 10 oz jar of marinated artichokes, diced and sautéd mushrooms before adding to mixture, and used half cup mayo and half cup sour cream.  Seasoned chicken breasts with Mis Rubin’s White Magic instead of adding garlic pepper to sauce.  Cut breasts in half as they were large/thick.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Perfection.  Thanks for the idea starter. It’s a keeper!

Used alternatives posted by other readers. I used 1/2 c. Light sour cream & 1/2 c. Light mayo., 3/4 c. parm. marinated artichokes (drained) and fresh mushrooms. I added Greek seasoning instead of garlic pepper etc.  I did slice the chicken breasts lenghthwise to approx. 3/4 inch to ensure even cooking. I expected a sauce topping but had a yummy coating on a very moist piece of chicken. Cooked 350 for 45-50 mins.
It was well received by husband and considered a “keeper”.

Delicious! My hubby said it 'was phenomenal'....a keeper for sure (the husband and recipe). :)

A couple small changes: I used an artichoke salad mixture I purchased from Aldi, just sounded good. I chopped everything up small - also I put the mushroom/artichoke mixture on the bottom and laid the chicken on top. Baked about 40 mins on 350 and broiled approx 2.5 so the top was nice and brown. Very tasty! I made the kale & avocado quinoa salad to go with it.  :)

This recipe is never a disappointment!!  So easy and yummy. Made it for my in-laws once and it’s one of there favorites now...they even copied the recipe down. When I make it I always double the mayo mix. Covers the chicken more especially if you add a few more pieces!! Love it

I used a small rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I removed the skin and pulled the chicken pieces off the bone .
I covered the 9 x 11 baking pan tightly with foil for the first 25 minutes , then removed the foil and turned up oven temp to 400 for 10 more minutes to brown the top. It looked great and tasted wonderful. I will make it again.

This is delicious (and so easy)!  I am on a no-grain diet and very low sugar.  The ingredients are everything I can have and tastes amazing!  I agree with the reviewer that suggested putting it under the broiler for a couple minutes before serving - it really makes the dish!

Very tasty. I think I might season the chicken first next time. Otherwise very yummy. One question came up though...wasn't sure if I should remove all of the juice/grease from the dish. The chicken is sitting in a pool of liquid. Any suggestions?

Awesome way to give chicken a new flavor! It's even better as left overs. I served it over rotini and spinach with a little shredded romano cheese.

Delicious!  Great for guests.  Chicken is really tender and flavorful.  Added some sautéed onions and onion powder for flavor along with a few shakes of garlic powder  and seasoned chicken with a little lemon and pepper seasoning.  Will try it with adding spinach as well.

Easy and delicious! Didn't have crimini mushrooms so I used a gourmet blend from Publix. Definitely will be cooking this again!

SO DELICIOUS. I doubled it for my big family - had a few leftovers that were devoured the next day.  I took the baking advice of others to brown the tops - and only because i had a bag of baby spinach, I sauteed and sort of sprinkled/placed around on top of the chicken breasts, under the artichoke layer... I dont have picky eaters, but I have opinionated teens, and this by far got the most compliments ever for a first time dish.

We love this dish, but we use to 8 ounce breasts instead. It takes 15 minutes longer, but it makes a great presentation!

Very delicious! We just finished the leftovers from last night and wished there was more. Other than adding fried onions on top I made the recipe exact. I think the topping would be great over rice also.

I made it as recipe said but baked it  35 minutes.    I used  portabella mushrooms.  My husband couldn't quit raving about it.  I served it with orzo and a bed of spinach. You must try it.   It was a little watery  but the juice was also good over the orzo.   I will definitely make it for company and often for ourselves.  We will enjoy the leftovers. I think the reason it gets watery is because they put so much solution in the chicken..I used  fresh mushrooms  those would make it watery also, but adds so much to the dish.  Don't use canned mushrooms    it would be a very good dish for a low carbohydrate diet also.

YUM! Used  1/2 light mayo and and 1/2 Greek yogurt. My mushrooms were already cooked, so at the end it looked a little dry. I added a splash of coconut/almond milk. I also put down a bed of fresh spinach before layering the rest of the ingredients, and cut my chicken in chunks. Served with a little garlic bread. Was all I could do to keep from licking my plate!

Soooo heavenly!!!  All leftovers were gone by the next day.  My (pretty particular) husband's only complaint was that there wasn't more of it!  I did follow a few of the suggestions and put over egg noodles, added some sour cream, and French's fried onions on top.  I also added some dried minced onions.  I had been scared there wouldn't be enough flavor, but it was so yummy.  I will be making this very often!

Wow!!! I've made a lot of recipes from this site and I got to say this one is now on my top 5 list for favorites.  I only made slight changes.  I didn't use light mayo, I used Hellman's regular.  I also topped the recipe with organic uncured bacon bits before putting in oven.  I think I cooked it for about 40 minutes uncovered.  Served with steamed broccoli and rice.  Loved it!!

The flavor of the mayo/parm/garlic  mixture, mushrooms and artichokes was Wonderful.  I did cut my chicken breast in half, since they were so big and they cooked in the 30 mins..  The chicken still didn't have much flavor itself though  and I even sprinkled the breast with garlic powder just to season. It was very moist though.  I also had a lot of water in my dish even though I drained the artichokes.  I will make again because I loved the topping. Next time I will cut up my chicken into smaller pieces .  I'll try and dry out the artichokes more and maybe that will help with the extra water.

The sauce was excellent! it is worth the time and money to use a fresh block of parm cheese and fresh artichokes. I tried with jar artichokes (so they were seasoned) and I felt that the seasoning of the chokes was too strong and salty for the dish.  when I mixed the mayo with the fresh grated cheese, I had a lumpy mess that gave me doubts, but it melted down beautifully and tasted amazing!!

The mayonnaise and Parmesan mixture was kind of thick  which might have been my fault, which then resulted in the chicken and mushrooms and the mixture not quite cooking into a mixture. They all tasted rather separate from each other, which was a bummer... I added some sun dried tomatoes in oil for added color and taste and I think I should have added more. I think this dish could have been better with more colors and taste.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to use rotisserie chicken.  This was a HUGE hit with my family, and has become a favorite recipe of family and friends.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make one change - instead of using all mayo, I used 3/4 plan greek yogurt and 1/4 mayo. I made it for a group of friends and everyone loved it. I recommend this substitution if you're looking to make it a little more healthy!

Made this for dinner tonight and thought it was delicious!! Only changes I made were that I chopped my artichokes before adding to cheese mixture, I used  1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and minced garlic. I also cut my chicken into strips and put salt and pepper on before adding cheese mixture. Omitted the mushrooms because I didnt have any but will have to try again next time! I made bowtie pasta, put chicken on top, the cheese mixture, topped with italian bread crumbs, baked for 30 min and it turned out yummy!! Will definitely use this again!!

Loved it, but I only gave it four stars because I made some changes. I used two boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 1-inch pieces, replaced the mayo with fat free cream of mushroom soup, seasoned with garlic pepper and added French fried onions the last 5 minutes for a crunchy topping.

I tweaked this recipe a bit. I'm not a fan of mushrooms so I substituted black olives instead. I also added 1/4 c of ranch to the mixture for some kick and garnished with fresh chopped tomatoes. Turned out excellent.

It was OK, not great.  Although I followed the directions exactly as written, it seemed to be missing something.  I did use marinated artichokes as suggested by someone else, but it was still a little on the bland side.

So good! My only changes were a little less mayo and I used three cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder. I had to bake mine for 45 minutes. Will cook this again!

I used canned artichokes and was not successful at getting the bitter taste of the preservative out.  Next time I will use jar marinated artichokes.   My husband said it was a salty meal.    It also needed to cook 45 minutes not 30.  It was just OK, not great.

This turned out very well.  My husband doesn't like artichokes or casseroles and he ate it so that's a win.
