I followed the instructions up to adding the chicken, then dumped everything in a crockpot with 5 chicken breasts, used less water, cooked all day long until the chicken fell apart.  Skipped the lemon, brushed some pita breads with garlic/cilantro butter, stuck them under the broiler until golden, served with toasted almonds sprinkled over the curry and basmati rice.  Turned out very good and super easy.  A keeper.

The best curry I ever made.  I did make a few changes though.  I ommited the cayenne because I used hot curry powder and I also added a table spoon of cumin and a 1/2 c of plain yogurt.    I also, took the tip from another reviewer and thickened it up with corn starch.  I then put this in the oven and cooked at 200F for 3 hours.  It came out so tender and flavorful.  This is my new curry recipe from here on out!

I love chicken curry...(my mother-in-law is Queen Curry..her beef and chicken curry dishes are beyond compare), but I'm glad you posted this one Colleen.  Now I can claim I know how to make this wonderful dish.  The cinnamon is a must..it gives off a unique flavor not acquired by other spices.  We usually use a cinnamon stick instead of the powder and don't remove it.  Thanks again.

I have a boyfriend who is 1/2 Indian.  He was so surprised when I made this along with Indian Dahl with Spinach (also on this site) which was also wonderful.  He said it tasted very authentic and came quite close to his own mother's ... Now that's a compliment !!!  I loved it as well.  I did add more cayenne than it said though and more curry than it said, and crushed red pepper as we both like spicy food.  I recommend it highly !!!!

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts which I browned in olive oil with the onions...I added extra cayenne, black pepper, and two pinches of salt...I alos went heavy on the ginger, cinnamon, and red curry powder...at the end I used one potato which I diced really tiny and a splash of lime juice...WONDERFUL!!! I come from a long line of southern creole/cajun cooks and my husband is used to that kind of food...after his millionth bite, he told me that this is DEFINITELY a keeper!

Fantastic recipe, I've been searching for a hearty curry like this for a long time!  I followed others advice by only putting in 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and using chicken stock rather than water, I also blended the onions into a paste rather than frying them chopped.  I added cornflour to thicken and organic half fat yoghurt to mellow the spices.  There's lots of disgreement about spicyness - I like mild curries so I thought this was quite spicy, it your pallet is more suited to super hot then you probably need to add hotter/more curry powder and cayenne pepper.  Fantastic, I will definitely use again and would use to entertain.

I read several reviews and compared several recipes before making.  Quite a few thought this recipe was bland so I made a few changes.  I used this as my main recipe and took a few hints from Curry Chicken II.  I used about 3lbs of wingettes(only chicken I had on hand.)  I made the following changes according to Curry Chicken II - 4.5T of curry powder and 1 can each of chicken broth and cream of chicken soup(instead of water to cover) I also added a dash of accent and a lot more than a dash of Goya's Adobe and a creole seasoning instead of salt.  (I did not use any cayenne pepper because my curry powder was HOT).  I omitted the ginger(didnt have any), and I omitted the lemon and tomato paste(just over looked them while toggling between recipes.  However, mine was so good I doubt I add them in the future)  I cooked in a crock pot for about 6 hours on low.  I added in potatoes half way through.  At the end I thickened my sauce with corn starch.  Served over rice.  This was to die for!!!!!  I have definitely found my curry recipe!

This does not taste like Indian curry at all but it is still delicious.  I've omitted the tomato paste and lemon, and added 2 potatoes and some carrots.  I use a few extra garlic cloves, and lot more salt as well (a pinch is not enough).  I also use boneless chicken tenders.  I suggest simmering this for an hour or so.

I made this for a group of friends.  I wanted to try out a curry dish.  I followed the recipe as is.  It went over pretty well and was pretty easy to make.

Initially, I was disappointed. I've had spicier morning breath than this stuff. Needs to be more specific on water amounts and salt is definately needed in quantities above a pinch.

Only after doctoring was it was edible.

As a fan of Indian cuisine this disappoints.

Being a huge fan of curry, and after the amazing smells wafting from the simmering sauce, I'd expected an incredibly flavorful dish, but I'm sorry to say that my husband and I were disappointed - the taste was a bit bland.  Perhaps I'll add more curry next time, maybe some coconut milk as well.

I'm sorry, but my first thought when tasting this was, "All that time...for this?".  The flavor is OK, certainly not bad, but there's almost no heat to it, and it's just not very exciting.  Only change to the original was to cut cinnamon in half, which definitely was a good idea.  I also had to cook about 30 minutes before the chicken was done through.

Delicious as well as super quick and easy!   I experimented with a couple of variations but the one that I liked most was when I used 10oz of Chicken Broth and 10oz of Plain Yoghurt instead of the water and then gradually added Corn Starch to thicken. I like my curries with a lot of sauce and creamy and this came out perfect! I also only added 1/4 Tsp of the Cayenne as I don't do too well with spicy.    I would recommend having the spices all pre-prepared in the two steps so that you can just dump in when the recipe calls. I didn't do this the first time and ended up in a mess.  I make eoough for the six servings and put the remaining into freezer bags and then take one out before I go to work which is defrosted by the time I get home and then I just heat up.

this is the first curry i have ever made, seeing as i am an experienced curry eater! the recipe given would result in a totally bland meal, just too...watery? so i added cumin and extra paprika, about 5 times as much salt, and spicy paprika. reduce the amount of cinnamon! also, i would say add more garlic, so you have about 3-4 teeth in the curry. Add slightly more of the tomato than was given, and some pepper too. i had no turmeric, but you must add some! this makes the curry an explosion of tastes just like it should be at a good restaurant! everyone loved it, and they ahve already ordered it from me for next time! my rating lost 1 star because the given recipe wasnt what it should be, yet with a few re-adjustments, it deserves 5*+!!UPDATE- i dont care about my 4 stars, i tried this again the day after cooking, and i must say ive NEVER eaten a better curry! thank for the recipe, will make it over and over and over again!! :)

Fantastic curry! Everyone loved it, even the onion hater. Served with raisins and peanuts. The sweetness of the raisins added just the right touch. Will definately serve again.

This recipe does taste a little bland as is.  I do believe that things can be added to it to make it better.  For sure, next time I am adding chicken broth instead of water to cover.  I think that will make a big difference.

I love this recipe, I am now a huge fan of chicken curry because this recipe has shown me how easy it is to make. When the recipe almost done(after water is put in), I suggest putting it in the slow cooker for a few hours, this really brings out the flavours.

This is quite yummy!  My 1st time ever making curry and so simple! I did add 1 tsp of salt rather than the pinch and then a 1/2 cup minute rice to the last 5 minutes to add more filler.  It was fantastic!  Thank you so much for sharing such a Yummy simple recipe!

Excellent. I used PaigeCentral's idea of adding cream to it. Instead of her yogurt I added light sour creme (I didn't have plain yogurt). It was very tasty. I cooked everything according to the recipe and then placed it in the oven on 200F for 3 hours. I didn't add anything to thicken it because it absorb a lot of the juice and what was left I was able to pour on the rice. I used red curry (spicy) and omitted the pepper. Also, I used smoked paprika which was tasty.

Hubby said the best curry I've made and satisfied the curry craving. I only changed a few things, used chicken broth in place of water, left out the lemon and sprinkled some Goya Adobe seasoning along with the other spices. We like spicy food, so I did use the full 1/2 t of cayenne pepper. Also I thickened the sauce with about 2 1/2 T of corn starch dissolved in water. Lastly I let it simmer for about an hour  served with rice and steamed broccoli.

I liked this recipe. I sauteed the onions spices as directed then put them in a crock pot with the chicken. I used drumsticks and thighs, bone in. I removed the skin. Next time I would use bone in breasts. I wouldn't put as much water in the pot as I did this time. I have lots of gravy.

We eat a lot of curry and I thought this was really good and easy. This works alone over rice or as a basic recipe to which you can add any assortment of veggies. I made it with chicken thighs, removed the skin, browned and then use the pan drippings in place of the oil. I also used chicken stock instead of water. I will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe several times and we love it, but I made some changes from the beginning.  I don't add tomatoes, I use chicken broth and white wine to cover.  I cook it much longer than listed.  I also add 1/3 EACH of raisins, scallions and green olives. YUM! Easy, you can prepare it, put on simmer and go do a bunch of other things and make rice and salad at the last minute.  Great company dish!

This was my first attempt at curry, and I found it delicious!  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, tomato sauce instead of paste, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll throw some cauliflower in to simmer with the chicken.

Yummy with a dollop of plain yogurt on the side!

This is an excellent recipe!! I ommitted the cayenne and lemon juice and put a little white wine in with the chicken. My family enjoyed it, even my 4yr old and 19mth old. Will definitely use again.

I followed the instructions exactly, but the sauce was too pasty and I had to add a lot of water to make it smoother.  It was also more bland than I expected, and I had to add more salt and lemon than the recipe called for.

really easy, really good. the slower you cook it and the longer, the more tender the chicken. i cooked it on low for 1 1/2 hours just waiting for my husband to get home from work. used 1/2 the chicken & onion, but full amount of everything else, b/c i like it saucy. used chicken broth instead of water. didn't have ginger & it still tasted great. can't wait to try it with ginger. added cut up baby carrots, would add peas and potatoes. added extra curry & salt. the lemon at the last minute really changes the flavor for the better. if you are tasting along the way, remember that! i felt like it needed something until i added the lemon.

I used one large sweet onion and about 2 t grated fresh ginger, omitted the sugar, and added 1 c coconut milk yogurt (which is naturally sweet) and 1/2 c diced red, orange, and yellow peppers. I also used corn oil instead of olive oil to fry the onions. It was excellent.

Love this recipe!  I made with chicken breasts cut up into bite sized cubes.   A hint to cut down on prep time is to use frozen breasts cut when slightly frozen.  Will cut prep time on this recipe in half.  No need to cook an entire bird.  Also cuts down on the fat without losing an bit of flavor.   I added another dash or 2 of curry and a bit more spice but this is an excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I was looking for a recipe very similar to my own because I'm not at home but want curry. I haven't made it in so long I've forgotten half the ingredients and needed a reminder. As I looked the ingredients over my recipe came back to me (of course). I didn't really change anything, just added potatoes because that's what I usually do, of course I fry them first, I also put everything in the slow cooker. I usually add coconut milk but didn't have any so I didn't bother. BTW, coconut milk in curry is better than yoghurt in my book.  The recipe smells delish and tastes even better. Cheers!

Excellent recipe! I added 3 sliced carrots, a bunch of snow peas, broccoli, and mushrooms and cooked them with the chicken and served it with rice. I would also add some corn starch to the sauce to make it thicker. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as stated, except I used all chicken legs instead of the whole chicken, left out the cayenne cause it was already pretty spicy, and I added a little red curry paste at the end because I didn't think it had quite enough curry flavor.  I probably should have listened to the other reviews that said to cut back on the cinnamon. While I was cooking, my husband asked why the whole house smelled like cinammon! I thought nothing of it, since cinammon is pretty aromatic, but in the finished product it was definately a little overpowering. Next time i'll probably try adding a can of coconut milk to mellow the spice and thicken the mix a little bit. Oh yeah and only use like half the cinnamon!

This tasted like the chicken curry I get in Indian restaurants. I love Indian food but the wife doesn't so I can't satisfy my craving very often. I used bonesless, skinless thighs and a little more salt. This was wonderful. I would like to try another curry powder. McCormick is fine but I would probably get something better and cheaper at an authentic market.

My family really enjoyed this.  I did use coconut milk instead of the water.  I also added a bit of chicken broth.  Next time I'll use all coconut milk and maybe add a little more curry or add tumeric.  Overall, it is something I'll be cooking again.

I don't know if it's authentic, but I was looking for something I had in an Indian restaurant in England many years ago.  I used chicken breast tenderloins.  Not knowing what kind of onion, and thinking it might be the little ones, I used half of a large red one.  When chopping it in my "magic bullet" it mostly turned to mush.  The spices looked a little scary when frying them, but it was surprisingly easy and very delicious.  I actually forgot to add the lemon juice and cayenne pepper.  It was very mild curry, but I think it's a very flexible recipe that is pretty hard to mess up.  Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces so it soaks up more of the sauce, and will mush up all the onions.

This recipe is so delicious my family raves about it every time. I always add a cup of plain yoghurt and a tablespoon on cumin. I also use a couple of dashes more of garlic powder and salt. It's really good with flavored rice (add chicken bouillon cube with cinnamon sticks, cloves, and curry powder to water before the water boils. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great base recipe. But I took a bunch of the suggestions from the reviews and added some spices to round out the flavor...Tumeric, Cumin Seed,  Also I added an entire head of cauliflower and a bag of frozen peas (because I've had veggie curry and it usually contains those veggies) which produced twice the food and made it a fuller meal! Because I added the veggies of course I had to just about double all the spices/liquid.  Also added 3/4 cup plain yogurt which made the sauce a bit thicker and creamier. My hubby LOVED this curry and I will definitely use this recipe over and over and over. Goes great with a chilled bottle of wine--GREAT suggestion!

Yeah, this is a keeper.  I scaled down the recipe for 4 servings.  I used skinned chicken bone-in breasts cut in quarters.  Added carrots and substitued chicken broth for the water as others noted.  I also stirred in some plain yogurt at the end to thicken it up just a bit.  Served with some couscous and made a really good curry dish.  Hmm which wine to pair with it???....:)

Excellent!  I used 1 pound chicken breast chunks, halved the curry since 3T seemed like a lot, halved the cayenne since I'm a wimp, and used only a small amount of onion/oil.  Using other reviewers' suggestions, I used 2c chicken broth instead of water and added diced carrots for the last 5 minutes and served over rice.  No, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the end result was delicious.

This was a nice change of pace.  However, the chicken came out a bit dry and the flavor overall needed something to give it more pop. We ended up adding sourcream to change it up and that helped a lot.

I think this recipe is a good starting point for chicken curry. Unfortunately, when I made it the spices weren't strong enough and the broth tended to get a bit watery. This recipe is good for people who don't like over-powering flavors.

We really enjoyed this!  Since my husband won't eat onions, I combined the spices, garlic & oil and made a paste, which I then heated in a skillet.  Added the tomato paste & chicken breast (cubed) and covered with water.  The chicken cooked very quickly, so I removed it with a slotted spoon so I could cook down the sauce.  It was pretty thin, so I made a slurry to thicken it up a bit.  The cayenne & lemon juice really made the flavor sparkle!  Served it over plain white rice with a salad.

I was very happy with this recipe.  I used 3 boneless chx breast cut-up.  I didn't measure the spices exactly but put about 2 tbl of curry.  I also added a jalapeno pepper and omitted the lemon 'cuz I didn't have any.  I used about 1 1/2 cups water with a chicken bouillon cube.  I served over brown rice and sweet potatoes.  This is a keeper!

My first try at this recipe was rather dissapointing.  It was very bland and made me wish I had seasoned my rice.  I could tell from the simmering scent that a whole tsp. of cinnamon was too much.  I would have cut that in half.  I agree with someone else's idea to try chicken broth instead of tomato paste.  I had to add LOTS of salt.  When all was said and done, it was only edible after adding LOTS of soy sauce and hot sauce!!!

Two of us really liked this dish, the other two, not so much.   Still, I'll make it again--with a back up dish for the picky-pickys.   It's good over rice, or rolled up in flat bread as a sandwich filling.

Excellent, easy recipe with complex flavor.  Was much better adding some cumin and eliminating tomato paste though.  I'm sure this recipe can tolerate many substitutions/alterations.

It was good, but not amazing.  I ended up feeling like I could have added chicken to a box of curry rice and had an equally satisfying meal.  I used boneless chicken cut into bite size pieces, that may have had a negative impact.

Yum!  I will definitely be making this one again. This time a little lighter on the cinnamon.  It was a tiny tiny bit on the sweet side.  Very nice recipe, though.

This was the first Curry that I've ever made.  It was absolutely tastey.  My 4 yo loved it!  I did follow a few suggestions made by other members.  I used a 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, cooked it in the crock pot for 3 hours, and potatoes and carrots.  It's amazing how the lemon juice made the dish perfect!  Thanks for the receipe.  It's been added to my "Recipe Box". :)

I just made this a few hours ago, and it was great! I really liked the lemon juice added at the end, I've never made a curry with that ingredient before. I used chick peas, black beans, and peas instead of chicken because I didn't have any.

I scaled back the recipe (and the calories) for just my husband and I by using about a pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs, only 1/2 a tsp of cinnamon, 1 large onion, 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1 cup of stock instead of water. I followed the rest of the recipe and simmered on the stove for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes or so. It was amazing!

I might try this again, since I'm the one that messed up the recipe and it probably deserves another chance. I added potatoes without adjusting the salt and ended up with the blandest curry in the world. Like I said, that's my own fault and I'll give it another shot sometime.

I made this for dinner last night and both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  Next time I'd put in maybe 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon - maybe 3/4 but not the entire teaspoon.  It wasn't too overpowering, but I wish that spice would've fell a bit more to the background.  I will definitely make again - it was delicious served over coconut rice!

First review on allrecipes.  I love curry have never cooked it so I used this as my starting point.  I doubled the chicken and added a little extra curry and cayenne.  I also added broccoli and carrots at the end.  I wanted the vegis to be al dente.

I have made this dish several times.  First, I use chicken breasts cut into cubes instead of a whole chicken.    The dish is AMAZING!  I have never made it and not wanted more.    The time for making this dish is completely off if done right with fresh ingredients.  If you do the simple math on the cooking time alone it adds up to more than 20 minutes (not including the actual time it takes to brown the onions.)  Prep time is way off.  By the time you chop 3 onions, measure out the spices, juice 1/2 a lemon, and cut chicken into pieces, you are WELL over the 10 minute prep time stated.  If you are going to make this dish, it is MOST DEFINITELY worth the time invested in it and is fun to make.  Just don't kid yourself and think dinner will be done in 30 minutes.

This was my first curry recipe and it was so easy to make.  I did make one alteration to the recipe.  I cooked the onions and spices together on the stove but then I put the chicken in the crock pot with onions and spice mixture on top of the chicken.  Then I added a couple of cups of water, cooked on high for a few hours until the chicken fell off the bone.  YUM!

I made this dish with red curry. I cooked the onions and spices just as the recipe calls for, I poured that over my chicken thighs, carrots, potatoes and chicken broth in the crock pot and cooked on high till the chicken was done about 3 hrs. This dish went fast. Everyone loved it. tasted like a traditional Indian dish that we order at a local place and pay 5 times as much for. I served this with curry rice, white rice and some buttered and toasted tortillas. so yummy

The recipe was good. It had a lot of flavor except it did need a lot more salt. Putting rice underneath definitely added a texture and taste. I put a little too much ginger, so it was an overpowering ginger taste. I stir-fryed it in a pan, very good results.

We love curry and this one was a disappointment.  It smelled amazing, but lacked flavor.  We feel adding the water diluted the spices.

This was a pretty good recipe especially for the short amount of time it took to make it. I only used 2 onions and 1.5 lbs of chicken. It could probably use a bit more salt and something to thicken it a bit. Otherwise, very tasty. I served it over basmati rice. My boyfriend loved it; I will make it again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I did make a few changes, as suggest by other reviewers...only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of organic plain yogurt, and I baked it in the oven for 3 hours at 200F.  I made a few tweaks myself...instead of 2 cups of water, I used 1 cup chicken broth (2 satchels of chicken bouillon in 1 cup of water) and 1 cup of coconut milk.  The coconut milk, along with the yogurt gave it a more creamier taste.  I also omitted the tomato paste.  It was very simple and quick to make.  This will definitely be added to my weekly rotation!  Thanks for making this available!

Two things!!! 1.you will need to cook this dish a long time and 2. use chicken stock to cook in.  I used a whole cut up chicken and was nervous about the amount of water I needed to cover the pieces.  I thought that the taste at that point was not very strong so I added chicken boullion cubes to the water.  Later...much later about 2 hours I was pleased to see that it had boiled down enough to be called a sauce and not soup...I added a handful of raisens and a chopped carrot and pepper to the sauce.  The end result was very good!

We really enjoyed this! I used fresh ginger and used chicken breasts cut into big chunks. I followed some of the tips here and added more water so we had plenty of sauce and reduced the cinnimon a bit. I also used spicy curry powder so I didn't add pepper at the end. Also - i scopped out a 1/2 cup of sauce and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt - mix together in a small bowl and drizzle over the top. it makes it for a pretty presentation and adds a tart zing. I will add veggies next time - it needs some green!

This was my first curry dish from scratch. It tasted great and everyone enjoyed it. However, one person asked if there was cinnamon in it, and after I responded yes...it was all they seemed to taste. Maybe next time I will put just a tiny bit less of it. Still...it was Delicious with some potatoes, carrots, baby corn, bamboo, water chestnuts, and peas!

This was pretty darn good. It tasted authentic without using any of the real genuine Indian ingredients one would expect. My family enjoyed it. My only complaint was that following the recipe closely you don't wind up with that much gravy or at least I didn't. Next time I would double everything at least. Tks for a keeper!

I was excited to try the recipe, but it didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. It was still good, but needed some body to it...I may thicken it up next time as some others have suggested, or may add coconut milk and a little more spice.

I found this recipe to be extremely bland. Curry is all about strong, distinctive flavours and this barely tasted of anything to me. I ended up adding ground coriander, black pepper, double the salt, turmeric, garam masala and extra cayenne to taste to give this recipe the kick it needed.

I read the many great reviews of this curry. When I made a batch, I couldn't have been more disappointed. It had a mediocre flavor, and the texture was not right, it was too thick. I made another batch and left out the tomato paste, but to no avail. Any curry I have ever had at an Indian restaurant is better than this stuff, and I have eaten in at least 50 Indian restaurants, and I always get curry. But, all is not lost. Yesterday in the big health food store I found pre mixed curry sauce! This is made by Maya Kaimal. It is a 15 ounce plastic jar, costs about $5. Save yourself the time and trouble of making the  on this recipe, and buy yourself a jar of Maya Kaimal, you will be delighted.

This is a great dish!  I made it one day on a whim because I had all of the ingredients and it is now our favorite dish.  The only adjustments I make are that I use about half as many onions and 1/2 the cayene pepper, but its delicious either way.  I also cook it much longer than the recipe calls for, usually 3+ hours, then shred it with a fork, leaving some sauce to pour over the rice.

I usually modify (depending on what I have on hand or what my family will like).  I used 1/2t cinnamon and added a 1/2t of turmeric.  I simmered in chicken broth and salted to taste.  I also added 2c yogurt and 1/4c flour.  Turned out great!

Made this in my crock pot & cooked for 6 hours.  I used breast meat instead of a whole chicken and I added some carrots.  I also added more salt, about 2 tsp. but it needed a little more once plated. I also lessened the cayenne b/c of my own personal tastes and also lessened the cinnamon a little as well.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and since I used about 1.5 lbs of chicken, I would lessen the water if I made it again.  Overall, very good!

Definately will make again.  I added eggplant potato & corn before the chicken, very enjoyable.  Next time will try using lamb instead of chicken.  Thanks

This was not a spectacular dish the first day - it smelled very curry-ish, but tasted too chickeny.  But it did taste much better the second day.  I also had to thicken the sauce with some cornstarch.  Next time I'll use more curry, garlic and cayenne (because we like spicy).  I'm sure this is a very flexible recipe!

This recipe was very tasty, and my family of 3 adults absolutely loved it. However, I have had  both Jamaican and Indian curry (which are basically the same thing) several times, and have been trying to find a recipe that duplicates it somewhat well.  I found that although this recipe was excellent, it is not reminiscent of what I know as 'curry chicken.'

This recipe wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like typical curry.  I found it spicy hot, but still somewhat bland.  I don't think I will make this again.

This dish made me love curry, I have never 
liked it up until now. I have made this dish 
for about 10 friends and they still speak to me 
(seriously, they have all loved it) about 5 
of those have got the recipe off me.  I get asked
to make it all the time.

Easy to make but not what we expected for flavor.Perhaps something less spicy.It's possible it's just a miss match for taste.

My husband is from Pakistan and loves this recipe. I did change it very slightly, adding more tomato paster and taking out the cinamon, only did that because the brand of curry we use has quite a bit of cinamon in it already... We love this recipe and my husband asks me to make it often for his lunches at work.

this was really good.. i used SUPERSWANKY28's tip about putting it in the crockpot and PaigeCentral's about adding a tbsp of cumin.. i added a couple of tsp's of salt and chopped up a couple of carrots, one potato, and one large zucchini and cooked them in the broth after the chicken was finished.. i used three chicken quarters instead of a whole chicken.. i won't talk about bf almost eating the entire thing.. but yes it was that good.. ty for the recipe

This was the first time I had ever even SEEN curry, I only made it because my boyfriend had been begging me to. It was amazing! I served it over jasmine rice, and had chocolate cheesecake for dessert to mellow out the spiciness. I was short on curry so I only used 1 1/2 T, and added extra of all the spices. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used granulated instead, and used my crockpot so the chicken would fall apart. SO GOOD!! we finished eating an hour ago and he keeps going back for more - definitely a keeper! I loved the lemon at the end, perfect touch.

To thicken, instead of cornstarch and water, try mashing some boiled potatoes in coconut milk to make a paste - I used my hand blender, and it worked great! Good recipe, simply add more or less of the seasonings to appeal to your taste.

It was ok.  I used alot of suggestions from other viewers.  No one left clear measurements for the tumeric, and cumin.  So i just winged it.  I used a about 1.5 table of each.  The dish is still missing something.  I will make it again.

I omitted one thing (ginger) and I think that's where I made my mistake. My husband and brother thought it was too cinnamon-y though I enjoyed it and the lemon definitely made the spice pop. Also, I think I cooked it too long because the gravy was way too thin. I'll definitely try again, without omitting a thing.

fantastic! Following the advice of another reviewer I also added a shake or two of cumin, turmeric, and chicken broth instead of the water. Absolutely delicious! Adjust cayenne pepper to taste - we like spicy! Served with steamed broccoli and sticky rice. The next day, we through it all together and stir fried. If possible, even better than the 1st night! Husband wanted new batch for night 3. Thank you for sharing.

Easy and delicious. I used chicken breast cut into pieces and didn't have a bay leaf on hand and it was awesome. Another time I made this I didn't have the tomato paste so i used ketchup....still amazing. Sometimes i use splenda rather than sugar...amazing. This dish just can't go wrong, my boyfriend makes requests for is all the time. Thank you!

This is a great basic to go off of and the spices can be altered to fit any taste preferences.  I always add a little milk or cream to it, as well as use chicken stock instead of water.

I've made this recipe twice, making just 3 additions.  I add cornstarch, as others suggested.  I add a bag of spinach at the end of cooking.  I also add plain yogurt and stir it in.  Yum.  Easy and delicious.

This was amazing and easy! I used potatoes and carrots, 1c. chicken broth and 1 can coconut milk. I didn't add chicken because I poured curry over Katsu chicken recipe from this site to make a favorite Japanese dish. Definitely a keeper!

Very good and easy and flexible.  I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the paste as that's what I had on hand.  I added a potato, carrots, and celery too.  It made a great meal of the two chicken breasts I had when we had unexpected dinner guests.

This was excellent. I just made this tonight. I ran out of curry powder so I only used about 1 tablespoon and I didn't have ground ginger so I had to use fresh. I also used Thai Coconut Curry Chicken broth instead of water. After it was all done I thickened it and served it over white rice that I also cooked with the Thai Coconut Curry broth instead of water. So so good.

Recipe was not that bad i had to change some things though..I suggest adding less cinnamin then called for, mine had an overwhelming cinnamin flavor when finished.  I also had to add way more salt then called for.  To kill the cinnamin flavor we added a couple of dashes of tabasco to our bowl and that really set it off! Overall it was good, i have never had curry before so wasn't sure what to expect but i will stick w/ those changes aforementioned.  Served over white rice.

A good base curry, but I felt as if it could have more flavor. Indian food is wonderful because of the rich-flavors common in the dishes; this one felt a little too tame and not because it wasn't spicy. I might add more ginger or possibly even chili powder next time.

This curry chicken recipe is delicious!! i followed the directions to the tee and it came out great!  Next time I might try a few variations such as adding potatoes and carrots to the pot and maybe cutting down the cinnamon to 1/4 of a teaspoon, the flavor was very strong, but other than that, it was a crowd pleaser!! I am definitely making this recipe again.

I used the slow-cooker like other recommended and added some extra salt  for taste.  I served it with brown rice topped with toasted almonds and cilantro.

This was very good. I made it in the crock pot and the chicken turned out so tender and delicious!  It had good flavor, but the sauce was a bit thin and oily. I would make it again with a few tweaks. Thanks!

Really tasty. I recomend only using chicken pecies. They are easier to handle. It was just spicy enough for me because I didn't use the peper. Serve over vegtables and rice

Very good - thanks!! I think next time I'll use chicken that is already skinless and boneless to speed the process. The end result was delicious!

I thought this recipe was excellent, although I did make a few changes.  I used only 1 lb. of chicken breasts and added sweet potatoes and carrots.  I also doubled the amount of spices and added a pinch of red pepper flakes and cumin.  Also used chicken broth instead of water.  I loved it and my roommate had 3 helpings!

I made this recipe for 60 people!  I cooked it slowly for 7 hours the night before, and then served it the next day.  It was a huge success - everyone loved it - not one single complaint, and lots of people asking for seconds!  I added chicken stock rather than plain water, which I think helped.  My kids loved it so much they begged me to make it again a few days later.  This time I was only cooking for 5 and didn't cook the night before, although I cooked it slowly for a good couple of hours.  However, the recipe was really disappointing.  Everyone kept saying it 'lacked something' and wasn't as nice as the last time.  I'm not the world's most dedicated cook so I probably won't bother with this recipe for just the family, but if I was making for a large number again then I would definitely use the recipe and cook the night before.  Thanks Colleen!

My husband and I like most curries, but have not had much luck with this recipe. We tried cooking it in a slow cooker to let the flavors blend more but were still not impressed. It smells great but lacks something to pull the flavors out. Also, seems pasty...maybe a curry paste instead of the powder would make a smoother sauce.

My husband loves curry, so I tried this recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that it needed something extra to make it good.  I topped it with cashews and golden raisins, which made it taste a lot better.

I was very disappointed in this dish and I almost never got this horrible smell out of my house.  I will never make this again.
