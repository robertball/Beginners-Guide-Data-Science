Great!  Note that you can use quick or old-fashioned oats.  I didn't use chocolate chips, and these were the perfect oatmeal cookie.  You could add 1 cup of raisins, and this recipe would be identical to the one on the oatmeal box.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used dark brown sugar, and a combo of white chocolate chips, walnuts, and dried cranberries.  These are hands down the BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever made/had.

The recipe must have lasted good to others, but I am not such a fan of oatmeal.

This one gets 5 stars because of the look on my boyfreinds face when he bit into one of these. I went with rasins instead of the chocolate and I omited the salt. Perfect oatmeal cookies! Crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. I also rolled these into small balls and dipped one side in sugar. I baked them with the sugar side up to give them a little bit of a glaze on top. Will make again, and often!

These were really good cookies. I only used 2 cups of oats, and found that that was enough.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, and they  were delicious - even after a few days.

Very good recipe. Not the best I've ever tasted, but real good just the same. And I think there's a perfect amount of oatmeal in these cookies--especially if you like something that's a bit better for you than the average chocolate chip cookie.

These were awesome! I took a batch to my daughther's preschool program and they were a hit.  I did half of the batch with the Swirled Choc. Chips (white choc/choc) and half of the batch with raisins, they were both delightful. The recipe made exactly 4 dozen cookies.

Whenever I bake cookies, these are the ones I make.  Didn't actually see this recipe until today, but it's the same one as Quaker Oats' (under the lid of their oatmeal canister).  Only difference between the two is Quaker Oats says to use raisins, but I use chocolate chips like this recipe.  To keep them soft (or make them softer), store them in an airtight container with a couple slices of bread.  It works!

I have to admit these cookies are really easy to make, but there is just way too much oats in this recipe! I just made these cookies last night, and it's like eating a bowl of oatmeal - uncooked! Sorry, but next time I'll make chocolate oat cookies I'll have to use a different recipe.

i mixed in 1 cup mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup regular chocolate chips it was nice to get a big chocolate chip in every few bites and the oats help me produce more milk and this recipe was perfect it worked for my needs since it was more oats than flour ratio. cookies are yummy!! and will definitely make them again!

I've been looking for this for a while, this was the recipe on the Quaker oats container years ago. In my families opinion these are the best cookies period, my Mom always made these when I was a kid. We don't add the cinnamon.

I made a few modifications to this recipe: I didn't use the choc chips and I replaced the vanilla extract with almond essence. I found these too almondy but my family loved them. The texture was lovely though!

I substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine instead of 1 cup margarine.  They turned out very chewy!  Really tasty and easy to make.
