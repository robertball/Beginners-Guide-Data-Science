I made these brownies without changing anything except the topping (I omitted the sugar and just used 1.5c of chocolate chips), and they were perfect!  I would consider them more of a cake than a brownie though.  They are so delicious (you would never know there was zucchini in these!), we even ate them for breakfast!  *I did bake them in a 13x9x2 dish, instead of a jelly roll pan, which probably just made them thicker.  It baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

LOVE IT!   I've tried many and always ended up too cake-y   (in defense of the recipes, I've also tried to substitute applesauce which I've learned changes the texture.

They were moist and chewy.  My husband said "these are REALLY good"  and he mocks anything sweet with vegetables in it.

Good flavor.  After tasting it, found it to taste much like my mother's sheet cake, so decided to add the frosting that would be on her sheet cake.  My family loved it with the frosting.

This was a big hit!  I did not use the walnuts and I used Splenda for the sugar.  After I pulled out of the oven I took a spatula and spread out the chocolate chips to make it look like icing.  All my family and friends loved them, even asked me for the recipe.  Great way to get picky eaters to have some vegies!!

I had extra shredded zucchini after making Zucchini Bread, was looking for something to use it up, and stumbled upon this recipe.  I didn't sift anything, was not real exact on measurments, and used a 9x13.  This was EXCELLENT! More "cake" than "brownie" but so tasty.  I skipped the walnuts, but the topping was delicious.  It's all I can do to not grab a square every time I'm near the kitchen :)

Delicious!  My family absolutely loved these and had no clue that there was healthy zucchini in there.  I thought they were more cake-like than brownie, but it may have been because I used a 9x13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan.  But, in any case they were just the right amount of sweet and chocolatey goodness.  These are going to be a definite keeper in my house!

Perfect right out of the pan brownies! Not over chocolatey. If didn't know it was there, would never guess they have the zucchini in them. Will definitely make these again!

Probably the best Zucchini cake/brownies I've had. Great consistency/texture and not too sweet.  The chocolate chips on top add the sweetness it needs. I made without the nuts and don't think they're needed. I also made in a regular cake pan.

These are super moist - more cake-like than brownie - but very tasty! I didn't have cocoa powder, so I melted one 1oz. unsweetened baking square and creamed it in with the butter and sugar. Also didn't have chocolate chips, so I used chocolate mint chips instead. Will definitely make these again!

I made this recipe exactly as it is stated and it was wonderful. It is not as heavy as a brownie and not as light as cake. I really enjoy the texture of these brownies. I ate 3 pieces and I can hardly wait to eat more!

Okay if you're just trying to use Zucchini but it was not anything like a brownie.  It was like cake and nothing more.  Will look for another recipe or more likely adapt a real brownie recipe myself.  Was very, very disappointed.  Had wanted something rich enough to pair with vanilla ice cream.  Too late to make something else for guests.

This was surprisingly good! Next time I will add the chocolate chips into the mix, rather than on the top because they didn't melt. It certainly rose, though!

I tried this recipe today. Instead of putting the chocolate chips on top I just added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips to the batter. It was so good!!
I baked them to share but ........ I'm not sharing!!!!

Great chocolatey flavor, very moist.  Unless you tell people, they won't even know there's zucchini in these brownies!  I omitted the walnuts and used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 1 cup.

These are sooooooo good!! I only topped with chocolate chips and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I do agree that it's more of a cake texture but I love cake as much as brownies so I don't find that to be a problem at all. Just sweet enough and insanely delicious!

Amazing! I substituted coconut oil for the butter so they took a little longer to bake, but turned out delicious. As other reviews said, it is more like a cake than a brownie.

If you have an abundance of zucchini in your garden, or even if you don’t, you may want to try this recipe.  It is wonderful.  As commented by previous reviewers, the title of this recipe is a misnomer.  I found this have a light, cake-like texture.  Because it makes a jelly roll pan size and is delicious, it would be perfect to bring to cook outs or other large gatherings.

Great recipe! Recieved many compliments. I followed the recipe exactly except for the 2 tablespoons of white suger on top. I only sprinkled the chocolate chips & walnuts on top. I didn't want them too sweet as I am diabetic and with that only change they were perfectly delicious. Plan to make them again & again.

Hands down the best brownie I've made. I kept all ingredients as listed.  After it cooled, I added a can of Hershey's chocolate frosting microwaved about 10-15 seconds.  It was divine!

I've never made a dessert with zucchini so I was a bit skeptical. These were really good, though. Even my ultra picky children liked them! Will definitely be making these again.

In my opinion, this would fall under the category of snack cake and not a brownie.  The texture is delicate and moist with a light cocoa flavor.  The topping is what makes the cake.   The chocolate chips melt into the batter to give it pockets of gooiness while the sugar forms a delicate crispy layer much like a glaze.  The nuts, of course, add crunch.  However, I left the nuts out because I didn’t want to open a new bag since this was more about using up leftover zucchini and a bag of chocolate bits ‘n pieces that were on the shelf.  The chocolate pieces that I used melted into the batter more than it would have had I used regular chocoalte chips, but it was still delicious.

Made these in a 9x13 Pyrex. Definitely more cake like than brownie, but still very yummy. Skipped the walnuts & didn't have choco chips.

These were so delicious and moist. You couldn’t even tell the zucchini was there. This gave me something to look forward to when it was time for dessert. Very pleasant and creative brownie recipe, 5 stars!

this recipe was AMAZING! I used brown rice flour instead and sprinkled a 1/4 of a cup of coconut over the top. I also replaced a 1/4 of a cup of the butter with applesauce.  Turned out well. I highly recommend this recipe!

I didn't know what a jelly roll pan was and used one that was too small. Use at least a 13 x 9 cake pan. 9 out of my 10 kids asked for seconds.

We loved this!  It is more cake like but holds up well to eat with your hands - put some in the kids lunches (goes well with coffee this morning too!).  I ended up putting three cups of zucchini because I over-shredded and just tossed it in.  It is very thick and "pudding" like.  I put it in a 9x13 pan and cooked for 30 minutes.  I don't have to worry about hiding zucchini- kids will eat it - but it is not terribly visible for those who do want to hide it (chocolate covers it up).  I had a ton of M & M's left over from something else so, crushed those up, sprinkled on top, for fun.  When the bumper crop of zucchini rolls around every year this will be a staple!

Wow!  I have been a member for a few years and this is the first time I have commented.  These were fantastic and so easy!  I could only find the skinny zucchini from the grocery store - bought 3 but needed only two.  I hate to make icing so the chocolate chip/nut topping was perfect!  The only thing I will do differently next time I make them (and there WILL be a next time) is shred the zucchini finer so my youngest doesn't say "what is this green stuff?"

These were "okay", but not great.  They were somewhat dry.  I'll stick with my other recipes for zucchini brownies and chocolate zucchini cake.

I was worried about how these would turn out.  The consistency of the batter was thick so I added a teaspoon or two of canola oil.  My reason for making these were to get some zucchini into my son who has food texture issues and is a very picky eater.  I thought these tasted good and I agree with the reviewer that stated they're in between a cake and a brownie.  There was no hiding the zucchini though.  It's there and noticeable.  My soon took a bite expecting a brownie (funny how he'll eat anything sugar based w/out a problem!) and I could tell he liked it until he got a little string of zucchini on his tongue.   Will cut down the zucchini by a cup when I make this again.  Everyone else loved it as is!

This is a great recipe, very tasty! It's more like a cake texture than a brownie, but I love that it does not need frosting. Kids loved it!

Update:Made a second time by substituting granulated stevia for sugar. It turned out good, obviously not as good as sugar recipe, but for a lower calorie option it was good.

Excellent recipe and I would make this again.  More of a cake-like consistency rather than brownie.  The sugar and chocolate chips on the top were more than enough for a topping.

Loved this!  Came out a little more cake like than brownie, but the taste was excellent!  Not too sweet.  I did not put on the extra sugar on top, chocolate chips, or walnuts.  The second time I made this I added 2 drops of peppermint for a little twist.  It was excellent!

It looks and smells amazing! I am not using the chocolate chips, walnuts, or sugar. I cut the sugar to one cup, and am using a cinnamon cream cheese frosting instead to bring out the zucchini.

I made these brownies today - I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips on the top.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  They were cake-like, not chewy and moist as I like my brownies - pretty mild chocolate flavor as well.  I will not make these again.

I made it exactly as written.  I have made zucchini brownies for years but lost my recipe. I had high hopes for this one. The brownies were overly salty and the taste was terrible. Yuck.

I followed the recipe exactly (no nuts though as my kids don't like them) and they turned out moist and delicious.  Each of my children loved these brownies, even after I told them they had zucchini inside!  This is a winner

Very good taste, but this is definitely not a brownie (cake texture).  Also, next time I will bake it in a 9x13 pan since I would prefer a thicker "cake."

Very tasty, moist because of the grated zucchini and still tastes almost like a brownie, a bit less dense and rich, but still full of chocolate and yummy!
Definitely recommended!

This is moist and delicious but not very chocolately or brownie-like.  I served this "cake" slightly warm with some softly-whipped cream and it was wonderful.  Next time I think I'll at least double, if not triple, the cocoa for a little more intense flavor.
