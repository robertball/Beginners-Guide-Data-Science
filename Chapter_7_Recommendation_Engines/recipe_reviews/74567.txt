This was good. I did not pre-heat the oven and put the fish in for 25 min, it was a bit to long, leaving the fish dry. I will make again but start checking around 18-20 min.

I love salmon and added this to my "200 ways to cook salmon" list.   The recipe needs to be corrected.  As one reviewer noted, 25 min is too long to bake this dish.  The cooking time shown in the header is 15 minutes, about right, and the TOTAL is 25, which is what is shown in the instructions as the cooking time.

I love this salmon recipe. But I had to double most of the ingredients since the original recipe was little bland and not spicy enough.

By far the BEST and juiciest salmon ever! I used red pepper flakes instead and added sliced tomatoes on the bottom, the last 3 mins of cooking I broiled it to brown it

Great glaze!  My husband loved this. He likes a little kick to his food.  Did change a few things though.  Used 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for the chile pepper, 2 tsp horseradish mustard for the whole grain, and lemon juice per another review instead of lime. Basically just stirred all ingredients together and poured on salmon. His favorite salmon recipe yet!

okay...normally I change a recipe to my personal taste but I left this exactly as is other than I only had one salmon fillet...I am not kidding when I say - AMAZING marinade. Amazing. Eating fish when dieting can get boring, but this was so spicy, and tangy that it was so enjoyable to eat. Excellent excellent recipe. My only tiny modification was cooking time- 15 minutes was all I needed. Thanks for making eating fish a really tasty experience!!

Good flavors here!  Needed to use dried chili pepper and lemon juice.  No mortar/pestle, just whipped it all up in a mini-food processor.  Mixture was not very 'pasty' however, more liquid.  Turned out good though!

This was great. I reduced the pepper (I'm a wimp) and used spicy mustard instead of regular. I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Instead of whole grain mustard I used dijon mustard - GREAT! My boyfriend and I love it. I had forgotten to save it and just not rediscovered this great recipe and meal. It's going to turn into a regular on the menu. Thanks!

This was excellent.  I did use hot sauce instead of a dried pepper as I did not have one and increased the mustard to one tablespoon.  (We love mustard.)

Unfortunately the flavour is not balanced. Mustard makes it too acidic and in general it is a sharp mix of asian and western flavours which does not work. I love salmon with honey, mustard and butter coating though.

This salmon was rather tasty, though next time I'd substitute cayenne for the rep pepper flakes I used (just a personal preference). I used a garlic whole grain mustard, so ours was extra garlicky. My husband called it the best salmon ever. Alongside crispy garlic fries and stir fried vegetables, it was a very nice dinner.

Great salmon recipe and easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe except I used whole grain mustard with horseradish. This will definitely be one of my top 5 salmon recipes.

Easy go to recipe when in a rush.  Added 1/2 tsp hot horse radish because I didn't have any grainy mustard.  Used dijon.  Very good not too spicy.

This was very good. I used Dijon mustard (all I had) and red chile rings and it didn't really make a paste-more of a sauce, which was fine. They cooked for about 15 minutes and were spicy (I gave the chile rings to my husband and he loved it) and delicious. The foil in the baking pan was a genius idea-clean-up was so easy! I will definitely make this again.

I made this tonight, and it was the best fish recipe I have ever made. I did use cayenne pepper instead of the red (they aren't turned yet) and I used lemon instead of lime juice. Super recipe, I will be making this again for sure!

excellent.  reduce the cooking time to 15-18 minutes though.  remember salmon can be eaten raw, so medium rare is where you want it.  i cooked it for 20 minutes and it was medium-well.

Absolutely delicious!  This was my 1st attempt to make salmon at home, I usually don't make it b/c my husband doesn't like salmon.  I chose this recipe b/c it wasn't the typical boring butter, dill, lemon fish recipe I see all the time, plus I like my food with a little kick.  Since I didn't have a dried chilie pepper, I used 1tsp of red pepper chili flakes and broiled it at the end as suggested by other reviewers.  I served this with Filippino garlic rice and mixed veggies-yummy. Even my 9 year old liked it; this one is definitely a keeper!!

A winner way to make salmon.  I used 2 chilis and lemon (didn't have lime), mustard was dijon & took extra time to mince the garlic, since I don't have a m & p.   Thanks for this recipe Napur.  Also thanks for the tip from Jet'sMom - I cooked it for 18 minutes - it came out just right. Those who like strong flavors rather than delicate ones will appreciate this dish.

I found this quite good, but since I never achieved the "paste" stage of the recipe (did anyone?), I added some honey and brown sugar.  It was slightly sweet but still with a bit of bite!

Very yummy salmon!  We did it on the BBQ, only because if it's nice out, hubby HAS to BBQ!  Used red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp is approx equivalent to 1 dried chile pepper).  The lime juice and whole grain mustard really came through in flavour...very nice!  Served alongside simple grilled zucchini - great meal!

This was a great recipe and an awesome new way for me to make salmon. I too did not have a dried chili so I substituted w cayenne pepper/red pepper flakes. I also added a little siracha sauce. I also sprinkled a little bit of panko crumbs on top just to add a bit of a crunch. The two things I did notice was that the sauce recipe definitely needs to be doubled, and that's just for two filets. Also, as per other reviewers I baked on the top shelf for about 15 min and even that was a tad too long (I prefer my salmon on the rarer side) but in the end the fish came out moist and delcious with quite a kick to rave reviews!

May I suggest for those like myself who have a hard time deciding from all the wonderful recipes here: I was torn between this and the "earth, sea and fire salmon" recipe.  I LOVE the fact that all the ingredients for a full meal are in that one and that the natural taste would definately blend well, but again I was torn... so I combined the two.. the mushrooms were underneath the salmon and then the sauce for the salmon taken from this spicy garlic version!!!  mmmmmm.  Thanks for a great meal idea :)

I used red pepper flakes in lieu of red pepper and it was very tasty.  Another good salmon option.

Please....don't cook the salmon for 25 min.! A 6 oz serving??? Maybe 15 and then let it rest.

very good recipe, simple and quick. I substituted a few items because I did not have all the ingredients. I substituted 1/2 tsp hot mexican chili powder and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper for the "1 dried red chili pepper";  I used spicy brown mustard in place of the "whole grain mustard" - never heard of that one; kosher salt in place of "sea salt"; lime juice in place of "fresh lime juice"; and took my fish out of the oven after 17 minutes.  Fish had a nice "kick" to it, not too spicy but still tasty.  Next time I would just cook for maybe 13-15 minutes so it would be more flaky.  Anymore than the 17 minutes at 400 degrees, would have been too dry.  My family really enjoyed this one, thanks!

LOVED it!  I increased the garlic, used crushed red peppers and had to use hot and spicy mustard instead of whole grain.  I didn't measure the lime juice (and should have since mine never turned into a paste) but no matter because the taste was heaven!  Will definitely make again.

Doubled the spices, as suggested, and used red pepper flakes and dijon mustard. I just mixed it all up in a small bowl and brushed it on both sides. SO tasty!! My boyfriend actually wildly praised it!

this was very good.. my salmon was done in about 20 min's with a preheated oven.. i didn't find the dish to be bland but salmon is very flavorful even with just a squeeze of lemon.. i used luv2bake's substitution's.. crushed red pepper flakes (but i only used 1/2 tsp), horseradish mustard and lemon juice (reduced it to 1.5 tbsp).. bf said he wished we had more so he could have seconds and maybe even thirds.. so yummy.. ty for the recipe

I used a lot of Basil and at least 4T. Olive oil and a splash of white wine. Very good, like the lime, I usually use lemon. Nice recipe, will make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I didn't change a thing except I used a food processor to grind the ingredients.  The garlic was not as fine as I wanted it so I added the mustard, lime juice, salt and pepper to the food processor and it was perfect! This one will definitely be a regular at my house! Thanks, Natalie!

It doesn't get much simpler than this to make a flavorful dish.  I increased the chile pepper because I like heat.  Served with israeli couscous and side salad.

Loved it!! Very flavorful. I used an extra clove of garlic because we are garlic lovers! I also used 1tsp of red chile pepper flakes as I didn't have a whole dried pepper.

Delicious! My husband said it was the "best salmon flavor ever." I only substituted cayene/red pepper powder because I didn't have a dried chile pepper and I added more of everything (garlic, lime juice, etc.) I will definitely make this again!

Kids and hubby liked it so, five stars from us.  I didn't really measure and just used cayenne pepper for the spice.  I did use more garlic and "not" fresh lemon juice, because that was what I had on hand.  I also overcooked the fish by three minutes, 15 minutes is the max on this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  Yummy, easy and fast.  Be careful of the cooking time.  25 minutes might be WAY too long.  Hence my 4 star rating.

WOW- I was totally surprised by how delicious this dish was!! After tasting the sauce, I literally almost threw it away- it tasted soooo strange to me.  But, my husband convinced me to give it a try.. and thank goodness!  It's actually much more subtle of a flavor than I expected (I think b/c our salmon filets were a little thicker) but DELICIOUS!!  We served our salmon over the "Caesar Salad Supreme" recipe from this site for the BEST Salmon Caesar Salad I've ever had!!  Thanks! Ohh, and we grilled our salmon, instead of baking it, basting it on both sides with the paste while it cooked.... yuuummmy!

This one is a keeper!  The family loved it.

I made a few modifications:
-Used 1 tsp red dried chile pepper flakes instead of a whole chile
-Used Magic Bullet to grind/blend since I don't have pestle and mortar
-Used a sheet pan lined with parchment paper
-Doubled the recipe since I was making 1.5 lbs of salmon

I made do with Inglehoffer honey mustard (not as sweet as some).  I thought it still needed a little something, so I added honey for a little more sweetness, which bumped my rating up a notch!

It was fairly easy to do. I might have overdone with the spices but it was good.

When I realized I didn't have the requisite marinade time for my go to salmon recipe, I searched my recipe box and found this recipe.  It look easy enough, I had all the ingredients, and it called for baking. In. 

I doubled the garlic (#thereisnosuchthingastoomuchgarlic), used crushed rep pepper flakes, and the juice of 1/2 of a lemon. No mortar and pestle, so I simply combined in a bowl and then spooned onto the waiting salmon fillets. 

Two thumbs up!  This will replace my go to, as I appreciate the quick cook time and lack of marinating time. Thanks, for the recipe!

Loved this recipe and it is now my salmon favorite! I forgot to buy a dried red chile pepper, but had New Mexico red chile seasoning, so I used that instead.  Worked out great! 
A keeper for sure. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I used frozen grated lime, fresh grated pepper, and also grated the garlic. I cooked it in in a heated cast iron skillet for a crispy crunch on the skin. Fast, fresh, delicious!

We have tried this Salmon recipe and love it. It doesn't have that overpowering fish taste. It is a mellow salmon, mustered, garlic and lime blend. A real treat.

Easy and delicious!  I like lots of flavor so I used the entire recipe but only ONE salmon filet.  I would suggest, if you are using two salmon filets, double the other ingredients.. can't wait to make it again!

Great flavors, fast and tasty. My husband was over the moon about the flavors in this recipe. The whole grain mustard really is key to the dish. We will definitely make again.

I used olive oil to coat the aluminum foil. I mixed minced garlic, olive oil, salt, crushed red pepper, and mustard. Once the mixture was think enough I spread it over my salmon (4 pieces) and baked for 20 minutes. The salmon was very tender and juicy.

Just ok, but I would not make again.  It just seemed like the wrong combination of flavors.....they kind of clashed.  I think the red chile pepper puts it over.....maybe it would be better with just the garlic, lemon, and mustard?

I made this recipe for  my husband and mother in law (I don't eat seafood) and they raved and raved about it.  My husband is a picky eater and he really enjoyed this dish.  Because we like things spicy here, I added some sriracha sauce (instead of dried red chili) to the paste.  Also, I don't have a mortar and pestle, so I wasn't able to grind things together.  I used regular mustard.

It was probably me, but, sorry I found the sauce to be too sour; I did not get the browning and it's a good thing I checked after 20 minutes because it was overcooked (yes it was recommended to check). When I try again, I will reduce the citrus, place it closer to heating element to get the browning effect and cook it for 15 minutes then check.  Thanks anyway.

Delicious!!  My family loved the lime and spice.  I am a garlic lover, so I did add a couple more garlic cloves.  All family members like spice, so I used 4 dried chiles.  Can't wait to use on other things.  Putting it into the rotation.

we eat a lot of salmon in our house so i'm always happy to find another way to prepare it. this was delicious. the only thing i did differently was, instead of using a mortar & pestle, i put the ingredients in a mini food processor. so instead of having a paste i had a very thick sauce. it still sat on top of the fillets without spilling off the sides. this one is definitely "a keeper.".

This was really good and very simple to make. I doubled the ingredients because I made 3 salmon fillets. I also just used about 1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes instead of a dried chile pepper. Delicious!

I usually do not write reviews but I could not let this one pass.  This is the best salmon recipe I have ever tried and it is VERY easy and quick.  I did not have a dry chili so I used about 1 tsp of chili pepper spice blend that comes in a tube.  So my seasoning was not really a paste.  I made it for my husband and I then my sister surprised us with a visit and we all raved about the dish.  Looking forward to make it for my next dinner party.

This recipe was easy to follow and delicious. I have 4 children and they all loved it. My husband said this is a keeper and he wants it next week. We made it with rice and a fresh salad. Great Dish!

Very tasty and very easy.  I usually have this stuff on hand so it's going to be my new go-to way to cook fish.  I used red pepper flakes instead of grinding a whole chile, so I got it a bit hotter than my daughter liked, but the rest of us thought it was fine.  No biggie, the amount is easy to adjust.

I should have cut back on the garlic. It was not fluid enough for me - if I added more olive oil and lime juice, it might have turned out better

This was superb! I used red pepper (cayenne) instead of red chile pepper. The salmon itself came out tender, moist and flaky. The paste mixture was surprisingly mild. I served it with new potatoes and a romaine salad. Very much recommended for ease, ingredients on hand and flavor. Thank you.

Amazing!  My husband and I just enjoyed this meal with wild rice, green beans, a slice of garlic toast, and a glass of red wine.  I had double the amount of salmon so I doubled the amount of seasoning... very spicy, but very good!!!

I had to substitute a large pinch of dried red pepper flakes for the dried chili pepper, but otherwise made it exactly as is, and it was delicious, garlicky and rich!

Apart from adding a touch more lime juice, I made this as written. The sauce itself is delicious, but a little goes a long way. My filets was slathered in it, and I could barely taste the salmon at all. This wouldn't be too bad if I'd used a really mild fish like tilapia or basa but I like the taste of salmon, and it was completely lost.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients but i stuck as close to it as possible and it was fantastic. I put in 1/2 tbsp of crushed chili pepper flakes, I used Dijon mustard & lemon juice. I just mixed it together and poured it on top of the salmon filets. The flavor was great!

We thought this was just okay.  Not bad but a little boring for our taste. I did follow the directions as written.  Sorry

Absolutely delicious and so simple to prepare. Just mashed with a fork (no mortar and pestle here) Used bottled lemon juice too. Yummy!
