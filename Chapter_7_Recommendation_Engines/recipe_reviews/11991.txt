Great tasting noodles.  My Mom has used this recipe for years.  To save time though, I suggest rolling the noodles out into desired thickness, and then rolling the dough into a log.  Then starting at the end, slice the noodles into desired width.  Afterwards, just toss them around until they are all uncurled into noodles.  Will save you a ton of time from just slicing them while lying flat.  Also keeps them more uniform in shape.

Same basic recipe that my grandmother and great-grandmother (full Cherokee) used to use as a basic starter.  I just taught my granddaughter the recipe and what can be done with it.  Same recipe, rolled a little thinner, use a glass to cut out circles, fill, fold over, and crimp with a fork to makes raviolis.  Make one inch balls with the dough and add to chicken or beef stew for great southern dumplings.  A real American classic.

Easy and great tasting, just like my great grandma's.  A secret ingredient that my great grandma used to add was a few drops of yellow food coloring. Makes your noodles look very yellow. Noone could figure out for years how her noodles were so yummy and yellow, always thought it was more egg yolk.  She was 99 before she told anyone! Now the family secret is out!

Excellent!! Decided to let my bread machine do the work. I put it on the pizza dough cycle which is a 50 minute dough cycle. When it was done I took it out, rolled it, cut it , dried it and we had it for supper!! Sooooo easy that way and so delicious!! Thanks!

I used my Kitchenaid and dough hook, which was a lot easier. Rolled them out and used a pizza cutter to cut them.  They were excellent!

Very tasty!  Used this recipe to make lasagna noodles; everyone raved about how good and thin these were.  No comparison to store-bought noodles.  Can also add pesto, lemon zest and ground black pepper, chives, oil-packed sundried tomato, etc. for a nice change.

This recipe is a staple in my home. It's so versatile. I add poultry seasoning when making noodles for chicken soup, and add garlic powder & basil when making noodles for use in Italian dishes. And for the occasional kid-friendly treat I divide the dough into 2 to 4 batches, and add a different food color to each batch. Serve cooked noodles with butter -- and watch the children go wild. (Haha. Children are so easy to please.) I can offer some insight to making great noodles: Don't add baking powder, as some folks have suggested, unless you like a really thick (more dumpling style) noodle. Working the dough too much, and not adding butter or oil will result in tough, rubbery noodle. Divide the dough into batches, and roll each batch. This helps in rolling the noodles very thin. The thinner the better (unless you're making chicken & dumplings). Happy cooking!

Good recipe.  As others have said they are thick but great in stews.  I cut down on time by using a pizza cutter to cut the strips and hung them to dry on stackable cookie racks.  worked well

Super easy and good.  I used my pasta machine to roll it out and had my 2 year old cut shapes with miniature cookie cutters.  I didn't wait for the pasta to dry, I just added it to my boiing chicken soup. Yummy!

I have been making noodles like this forever, so I know this recipes is delicious.  Don't forget to put some salt in your dough and before you cut your noodles, put some pepper. I repeat: BEFORE.  It tastes better that way because your raw noodles will have pepper inside them while they are cooking. Also, egg noodles, are so delicious, but pretty time consuming, so make way more than you need. Freeze those bad boys so you have some ready for next time.  Before you stick them into a freezer bag, let them dry.  If you plan on cooking them right away, they do not need to sit out and dry.

These were not bad, though I don't think my search for the perfect egg noodle recipe is over as yet. I think that 1/4 in. in thickness is way to thick, much better to stick to 1/8 inch. Also, I would recommend boiling the noodles in chicken broth for added flavor. I served these with the slowcooker beef stroganoff from this site, a fantastic dish that camouflaged whatever flaws the noodles may have had.

Not only were these easy to make, everyone loved them.  To dry them out, I also put them in a 200 degree oven for about 5 minutes.  Worked well.

Sorry I didn't get a pictue. It was gone too fast! I didn't change the recipe at all, only the preparatiion. I threw everythng into the food processor like the Barefoot Contessa does her pie dough. I pulsed it about 5 times and than ran it until it became solid, which was about 45 seconds. 
I floured my hands real good to remove the dough from the food processor. I kneaded it about 5 times and let rest for 10 minutes. I roll all pasta and pastry using a pastry cloth and a cover on my rolling pin.  Only a little flour is needed. I rolled it out very thin and used my 5 wheel pasta cutter to make the noodles. This was unbelieveably fast. The noodles were very tender. I used them for chicken and noodles. Thank you Linda. I would give this 10 stars if I could.

Quick, simple, cheap, and delicious. If you haven't made homemade noodles much, FYI: you don't have to dry them first. My mother and I have made homemade for over 60 years. We just use egg, salt, flour & a little water. But we cook them in chicken broth. When cooking, don't overlap & don't stir them – not until they rise to the top. Then push to the side and add more.

Just like my mom used to make! I halved this recipe and it fed 3 with no leftovers. FYI, I rolled mine rather flat - about 1/8 in. I also made them narrow, not wide, and rather short too. I tried the Swiss roll method, but the pizza cutter was much faster. I allowed them to dry for only 30 min., but I remember my mom drying them for up to 3 hours. I cooked them in salted water with a little EVOO and they were done in about 3-4 minutes. They rose to the top of the boiling water when they were done.

This is very similar to the way I make mine except I don't use milk and butter.   I always figure on one egg per person and (depending on the weather) a 1/2 cup of flour.   I just toss my eggs and salt in my Kitchen Aid with the whisk attatchment and let er rip.  Then switch to the paddle attatchment and start adding the flour.  Roll them out and cut them with a pizza cutter.   If I want a thicker soup I toss them in the boiling broth immediately.  For brothier soups - Just let them lay there after drying for a couple of hours and then add them to the broth.

I would strongly advise against adding salt to any fresh pasta dough. It dries out the dough and makes the dough much stiffer than it should be, and consequently the noodles are thicker than they should be, as they are more difficult to roll thinly. Add salt to the sauce or soup you will serve the noodles with instead! Otherwise, this is a great basic egg noodle recipe.

This was my first attempt at making pasta, and it worked! the noodles were a little thick, so next time i will roll them thinner. This was easy for the beginner pasta maker.

These were fabulous!  So easy to make in my kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook.  I boiled them in 3 cans of beef broth w/ 1/2 cup heavy cream and they were so tender and amazing!! Didn't need anything else to flavor them.

Same as my husband has been making for years except we never cook them in water. We cook them one of two ways. In a chicken soup base to make homemade chicken noodle soup, or the day after we have a pot roast. He makes them huge and wide then and we cook them in the juice from the pot roast. Serve them with the juice poured over them and salted. mmmmmmm Comfort food at it's finest.

Excellent noodles.  I used a little flour when rolling them out, and had no problem getting them thin enough.  When they were the correct thickness, I dusted them with flour, rolled them up, and sliced them to the desired width.  Then you toss them in the air to separate.  Thanks for this great egg noodle recipe.  They will be a major part of our homemade chicken chowder for years to come.

I wanted an authentic Amish style noodle so used this recipe with water instead of milk and veggie oil instead of butter.  Rolled out 1/16" and used in Turos Csusza from this website.  I rate this "5 D's"!!!!  Delicious, delicate, divine, decadent and diverse.  Used fresh eggs from the hen house that were still warm...and used a few drops of yellow food coloring.  This recipe is by far one of the best ever...Kudos!!!

I am giving these 5 stars for taste and easy - I must say I used my KA roller attachments and rolled these really thin (down to setting 5)  they were plenty thick once cooked - I can't imagine what they would have been like if I had only rolled them to 1/8".

I used my pasta machine to roll out(one time through on 2) and cut this dough.  It needs about 1/2 to 3/4 cup more flour to do it this way.  Also be sure to flour the dough well.  I liked this recipe.  I'll use it again.

Very simple, this was my first try at making egg noodles and they turned out wonderful! I prepared mine with my Kitchen Aid mixer and only kneaded for 2-3 minutes using the dough hook. The dough was easy to work with. I will never buy egg noodles again for my homemade chicken noodle soup!!

I really disliked these. They tasted too much like flour to me, and in my opinion needed to be A LOT thinner.

These worked out really good in the turkey noodle soup I made. I made the noodles the same day as the soup. They took longer to dry than I anticipated, so I ended up using my hair dryer on them. It worked pretty good and the noodles were delicious!

I have been using Allrecipes for quite a while and have had many successful turnouts but this is an incredible dough.  I forgot my recipe at home so used this one and it was fabulous, I will continue to use this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I found another way to easily cut the dough.  Use a pizza cutter.  Its really quick and goes through the noodle dough smoothly.

The noodle dough recipe that I've made in the past is good, but is very difficult  to use with my hand-cranked pasta maker.  I was therefore looking for a new noodle recipe and decided to give this recipe a try, although I was somewhat leery about kneading the dough.  (I was afraid kneading might toughen the dough.)  This recipe worked great in my pasta maker and the noodles were not tough, although they weren't as light as noodles made from my original recipe.    I will definitely use this recipe again - - perhaps to make pierogies.  The ease of using this dough in my pasta maker is worth the trade-off of having a noodle that isn't quite as light as my other recipe.

Just finished cutting with the pizza cutter and they are curled up to dry. First pass at rolling was fine and cut the noodles and they stuck to the sheet. Rolled it all up in a ball and started over with more flour on the sheet. This time it worked. Only change that I made was to roll it out and then let it dry on a rack for a few minutes like my Grandma Velma BEFORE I begin to cut them.  Can't wait to use in my home made chicken noodle soup. (Chicken was boiled and deboned last night).

This recipe produces a great homemade egg noodle. They remind me of the kind you get in the freezer case at the grocery store. The tip is to roll them as thin as possible as they will plump up some while cooking. I use a pizza cutter to cut mine after I roll them out and it helps me to keep them small. I haven't frozen them yet for later use, but I am going to try that soon. Thanks for the recipe!

I've used a similiar recipe like this one for years. Our recipe differs by using evaporated milk and no butter. I use a grooved rolling pin and can cut out noodles in no time. Some pickled Jalapenos goes extremely well with them. Cajun spice is another great flavor to sprinkle on them for a change as well.

Made these as an accompaniment to Beef Goulash.  My husband said they were very good.  I thought they were ok, so 4 stars it is.  I do think that herbs added to the dough is a great idea as some reviewers mentioned, and I should have tried that today.

I wish I had found this recipe years ago.  I love making turkey noodle soup out of leftover turkey after Thanksgiving.  I had an extra turkey in the freezer and decided to make it over Easter week.  We were away at a lake cabin and I figured it would give us lots of leftovers.  I was tired of buying expensive egg noodles at the store and thought to look on allrecipes to see if I could make my own.  Boy am I glad I did.  This dough is so easy to work with.  I've made homemade pasta before, but always with a pasta maker which is a bit of a hassle.  This was the easiest recipe.  The dough was so nice, I was able to roll it out with a wine bottle since we have no rolling pin at the lake.  Then I simply cut up the noodles with kitchen shears.  Worked great.  The only compliant I had was that the noodles were a little tough, however, by the time we got to the second bowl they had softened up.  I just didn't realize how long I needed to cook them.  Most homemade pasta I've made doesn't take long to cook.  These take longer, but hold up nicely to reheating.  If you've been wanting to learn how to make your own noodles for homemade soup, this is the recipe to use!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Pretty much the same as my grandma used to make. She was the best cook I ever knew. She kept all of her ingredients very, very cold including the flour, putting it into the refrigerator the night before making the noodles. After mixing she separated the dough into three sections and wrapped two of them in plastic wrap and placed them into the refrigerator while she rolled the other out. Dust your board well with flour, roll out, cut and then put on a flour sack towel with extra flour to help the drying process. Repeat this process with the other two pieces of dough. These noodles can be frozen in a zipper bag after they are completely dried. Iced water can also be substituted for milk. If you do not overwork this dough these are the best noodles you ever ate. It might take some practice but it is worth it!

Very good noodle for soup.  Things I did a little different:  After reading some reviews, I boiled the noodles separately in Chicken Broth colored with a few drops of yellow food coloring, then added them to my soup.  I also used a pasta roller to roll out the dough, but left it very thick (#6) and used the fettuccini setting to roll out the strips.  Then I just cut them to about 1 1/2 " lengths.  Made awesome Kluski-style noodles!  Will make again, thanks so much for the recipe!
***Later Note: have made these about 50 times. Always perfect.  Have started adding yellow food coloring per another review, and also adding 2 tsp chicken bouillon powder to the flour for even more amazing flavor!  Thanks again!!!

Made these to make beef and noodles.  Delicious!  they're not a light and airy noodle, so if that's what you're looking for, these are not for you.  Wonderful old-fashioned noodles!

These are awsome noodles. Ive always used just salt and eggs, water. Never no butter or milk. From now on I will be making these. Always let your dough sit for the 10 minutes. Thanks for something new! Lisa  Update: Just made again, this time I added 1/4 tsp. of thyme, pepper, parsley, and garlic, to the dough. Wonderful!

Excellent noodles for a homemade soup. My family likes them 1/4" thick. Big and hearty. I cut them into fun shapes with very small cookies cutters too. No changes to recipe.

I've been using a pasta machine and using the recipe that comes with it that calls for water and oil. I've never made them with milk and butter. Decided to look for a new recipe and tried this one because it had so many good reviews. I think they were the best I've ever had. Today I'm going to make more for the freezer but I'm doing them by hand this time. The machine makes them too thick and I  want to try the thinner noodles. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I have never made pasta before and this was a success.  Very easy and delicious.  I used whole wheat flour and 1% milk.  It had the texture of gnocchi.  Thanks for the "keeper."

My first noodle making was a success!  I used a bit of olive oil instead of butter in the 2nd batch, and that was fine.  I also used cake flour in the second batch, and I found it easier to roll out.

These are so easy to make.  I took 3" pieces and made circles with them.  They cooked in about 5 minutes in boiling water.  I topped them with butter and mozzarella cheese. delicious.  I intend to make more and will make ravioli. I don't believe I will buy store bought  pastas anymore.  Surprisingly easy to prepare and so much more tasty.  YMMM

These noodles are good but I personally would leave out the butter, the butter makes the consistency more gooey and more difficult to knead and roll out.

Excellent recipe.  I tried another recipe first and ended up throwing all the dough out because it wouldn't stay together.  This makes a lot of noodles, so be prepared.  I used a Kitchenaid stand mixer with the dough hook for the kneading and it worked great!  After rolling out the dough, set it on plastic wrap.  I tried wax paper and the raw noodles stuck to it...quite the mess.  Great recipe!

These are basically the exact same egg noodles I have been making since I was a kid....recipe was passed down. The only difference I use 4 egg yolks, in place of 2 whole eggs and use cream in place of milk. I tried this recipe as written and I prefer the heartiness of my recipe. these were good, we just like a denser noodle.

Excellent! I halved the recipe and used about 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (the equivalent of 1 cup whole wheat, 1 1/2 cups regular for the full recipe). It worked very well! I also did what others said and rolled up the pasta to cut it. However, I didn't have enough flour on it; some of my rolls stuck together too much to unroll, so I had to redo them. Be sure to use enough flour when using that method. ;) I served them tossed with butter, garlic, parsley, and Parmesan. Wonderful!

I made these noodles for dinner tonight (chicken and noodles that is). They were great. I rolled them as thin as possible to avoid the thick ones from other reviews. I also mixed and kneaded by hand. Thank you for this recipe. I will be making these often.

I've used this recipe 4 times, now, and it gets better every time.  I've never had noodles come out so consistantly great, and with such ease.  They're very little effort, and the taste/texture is well worth it, instead of dry storebought noodles.  Best noodle recipe I've come across.  EDIT: Years later, this is still my outstanding overall favorite, and it makes FANTASTIC dumplings, cut into little pillows, and thrown into boiling chicken broth with all the flour clinging to them.  I had to add this, I'm making them right now!

These were really easy to make and tasted great with a beef stroganoff sauce. I used the pasta machine to roll them out and then used the pizza cutter to make the noodle shape.  These tasted a lot better then store bought.

This was so yummy! Please believe me when I tell you my 5 year old is a picky eater! Last  night I made these and he wanted 3rds. YES THIRDS!!! I did not change a thing and it turned out perfectly. Reminds me of the recipe my mom used to do when I was little except it used 5 eggs. Love only using 2 in this one. I think maybe next time I will add a little fresh chopped parsley to the dough before rolling it out and cutting it just for some color! EXCELLENT!!!

I followed the recipe and I had great noodles. I cooked them fresh, didnt wait them to dry. 1 carton chicken or vegetable broth, 3 table spoons soy sauce, 3 table spoons mix dried vegetables.. this is my way of cooking.

Who knew making noodles could be so easy?  I used white whole wheat flour, my Kitchenaid, and a pizza cutter.  I also used olive oil instead of butter.  I will probably make my own egg noodles from here on out.

These were awesome. I made two batches and they turned out great both times. I mixed the dough with the dough hook in my stand mixer and rolled them using a hand crank pasta machine and cut them into fettuccine ribbons. After they were partially dried I cut the ribbons into 2 inch strips for chicken noodle soup.

Really delicious egg noodles!  I used rice milk and Smart Balance Light in place of the milk and butter to make it dairy-free.  Once and a while I throw and extra yolk in or two.  Delicious, simple, and a lot less expensive than fresh store bought!

I think the taste was great - however this was my first attempt at pasta making and it turned out strange. First- there was no time frame for letting the pasta "air dry" before cooking, second, while it was cooking it looked a lot like dumplings, it kind of always had a strange dumpling gooey biscuit like texture to it, and lastly this recipe should have included a what to look for when done paragraph. Ultimately the pasta was chewy yet strangely firm.. I boiled the noodles for a good 20 minutes.. and it was still chewy. Unfortunately that was the only thing ready and available to eat tonight.. so I am Hoping that they can be a little - or possibly a lot under-cooked and still safe to eat. I think the only reason why this recipe failed for me tonight was because I am too new to homemade pasta and don't know what to look for. I will try this one again after chatting with some pasta veterans :) If anyone would like to help me out it would be appreciated too :)

Made these tonight to serve with the Simple Hamburger Stroganoff recipe also on this website...These turned out perfect!! I only had to let them dry for about 45 mins before I cooked them...Very sticky but well worth the work!!

These were pretty good but they need to be much thinner I think. They were very easy to roll out and I just cut them in strips using a pizza cutter.

Make sure you cut these thin or they taste doughy even when fully cooked.  Very easy recipe and very tasty...even when a little doughy!  This was my 2nd time making the recipe and both times they turned out great.

I made these noodles for chicken noodle soup, and my husband really liked them. I followed the instructions but thought they were a bit thick and not as tender as I prefer. Still haven't found a recipe like my grandmother used to make!

Not even close to Mom's.  I couldn't find my mom's recipe for egg noodles and didn't want to call her for the recipe and get into a 30 minute convo at the time so looked online and found this.  These are dense and rubbery.  I could even tell when I was rolling them out they weren't going to be very good.  My mom's recipe is very light and fluffy and tastier too.  I guess some people like dense noodles, but not me.  Off to call mom now.

You definitely need some pasta maker when using this- if the noodles are not cut thin they were very heavy. I used whole wheat flour which turned out great!

I have been making these for ever and we never let them dry any longer then it took the chicken stock to boil. And we always rolled them real thin the rolled into a log and cut into slices then unrolled and cutg into 3 inch strips and ate with mashed potatoes. Also we never put anything in it but eggs flour and salt. And we boiled chicken or made a roast and cooked the noodles in that.

These were great!  They cooked for about 10 min. in my homemade chicken noodle soup.  The dough is hard to roll out though.  Just keep at it and you will be happy with the results.

I used these noodles in a casserole.  It definitely made it special.  The noodles themselves tasted great, but I did struggle to make them thin.

These were easy to make, the dough was nice but they were a little bland and got kinda "goopy" when I boiled them.  Make sure you roll them thin though...really thin!  I will probably try these again but add a little salt.

A good basic recipe with excellent results.  I let it rest 20+ minutes.

I roll the dough out thin then dust with flour and roll it up into a roll and use a knife to cut the noodles, then unroll them.  I never dry mine because I like them thicker and the extra flour helps thicken the soup.  I cut at an angle so as not to have such long noodles.  I have not tried putting milk and butter in mine but I will next time and putting some herbs in the dough is an excellent idea.  I bet it would be good with chives.  I also use the same dough to make home made raviolis.  Cheese and meat filled.  My family loves them.

A nice noodle recipe - although you have to be super careful with them after they dry or they will crumble on you.  I roll them out thin, then cut them with an herb mincer and hang them on hangers off my cabinet doors to dry.  Yum!

I grew up eatting my grandmothers famous chicken and noodles. However when she passed away her noodle recipe did too. :( I've been searching for many years ... thought I had scored the same recipe or close to until i cooked them.  I've made this recipe twice now.. first time i followed the recipe as stated... and they were really tought and over  just horrible. 2nd time I added additional table spoon of butter 1/4 tsp of baking soda, and -1/2 cup of flour. Better but still not great! Guess I will keep looking.

Made these not too long ago they were ok but they could have been better. That was my fault though I don't think I rolled them out thin enough.

I make homemade noodles all the time. Up until now I always used my Grandmothers recipe. The only difference is this recipe uses milk not water. I will say the milk makes all the difference in the world. The dough is like velvet when you roll it out. Lovely recipe.

These were so easy to make and very tasty when cooked in homemade chicken soup. After drying the rolled sheets on a clean towel for the specified time, I just cut them into thin strips with a sharp knife and hung over a plastic hanger until no longer sticky. I used half the noodles in the soup and froze the other half.  The frozen noodles cooked up just as nicely.  A lot easier to make noodles from scratch than I would have imagined.  Thanks for the recipe.

After reading a review that said to add yellow food coloring to the recipe and finding that I didn't have any, I used a few strands of saffron mixed in a very little bit of hot water.  The noodles were beautifully colored and tasted faintly of the saffron (which I love).  Next time I will try 1/2 semolina flour.  This is an excellent and very easy recipe for a beginner pasta maker.

This was my first attempt at making any type of noodle or pasta at frome scratch.  These noodles turned at amazing.  I halved the recipe for a vegetable soup.  These egg noodles are a definite keeper and we will make them over and over again.

First time making egg noodles though I have made various other types of pasta in the past. This recipe is tasty for sure. I had a problem with thickness despite the fact that I rolled it as thin as I could without it getting transparent. I didn't dry them either. I just dropped them into a  pot of boiling water and fished them out. Then I stored them in the fridge for dinner later tonight. They DO roll out heavenly and are indeed tasty!

Such a great and easy recipe... Just mix, knead, rest, and roll. I sat my 7 year old and 3 year old down with the rolled out dough and a pair of tiny cookie cutters (a star and gingerbread man) - these were only a couple of inches across at most. They had a great time cutting out the shapes which made a fun addition to our chicken and vegetable soup. 

As to taste... My 7 year old is a picky eater, but loved these noodles! My mother-in-law, who believes herself to be the world's best cook, also liked them. 

This recipe is a keeper!

We found these to be a much softer noodle than is to our taste. We prefer noodles with a little more substance to them. They rolled out like a dream, however.

Superb! I used them our favorite beef stroganof recipe and now my husband preferes that I never use store bought again. One trick I used was to roll the dough up and use a sharp!!! knive to cut strands but I also sretched the strands for a beautifully thin noodle rather then labourisly rolling them thin. No 2 doughs will ever be identical when using a cup measurement for flour and other variables so I had to add more milk, but this is not a fault of this recipe.

These were truly excellent.  Made exactly as the recipe indicates, and I rolled and cut them by hand.  Let them dry overnight and added them to homemade chicken noodle soup from scratch.  I even think they're as good as my mother's and her noodles are famous in our family!

Great recipe! They were tender & a great addition to my chicken soup. The recipe made enough for the soup & half left to freeze for later. I boiled them in a bit of stock before adding them to my dish (egg noodles will suck up quite a bit of your broth). Take your time rolling, the more you roll the easier the dough is to work with. Five stars!

I like this recipe.  I like the texture and the quantity of the noodles.  I make the Savory Roast Chicken on this site, then use the leftovers and these noodles to make chicken and noodles the next day.  I find it goes really fast when I roll them out then use a pizza cutter to cut'em.

The noodles are boiling as we speak, but I found this recipe the best for egg noodles. I'm a "tweaker" so I found this a bare essential to learn to make your own noodles and then spread out from there. I also agree that the instructed thickness was too much but in recipes I look at certain steps as suggestions. None the less, great recipe and I shall also be using this recipe for stuffed shells soon.

This was my first time making egg noodles so I decided to try this recipe based on all the good reviews. I recently bought an Imperia pasta maker & this was my first time using it. I rolled the dough out & worked it down to the thinnest setting. I made some wider width noodles by cutting them with a knife & also made some by cutting the sheets in 2" pieces then running them through the fettucini attachment for a thinner width. I used the wide ones in Hungarian 
Goulash & froze the rest to use later in chicken soup. The taste of 
these was absolutely sublime! I will definitely make these again.

These noodles are super yummy!! I followed others tips and mixed it in my Kitchenaide stand mixer with the dough hook on. Dough came out very elastic and rolled out smoothly. I did not have the time to let the noodles dry for an hour as suggested. They sat on the counter for about 15 minutes before I threw them into my chicken soup. They came out great, even my picky four year old loved them! Next time, I will try to make them ahead of time and let them dry out a bit more and see if the result is any different. Thanks for the great recipe!

They were hard to work with and so I did not get the best taste out of them. I am going to try another recipe before I go back to this one.

My mother left me a recipe - but it was for a huge batch, way too much for my crockpot full of chicken broth.  This one is just as good, and I even forgot the butter - they were still great.  I second the recommendation to roll this to the desired thickness, roll into log and cut to desired width.  That is the way my mother did it, and it is much easier.  If I were to make a large batch, I'd haul out the pasta machine.

This is totally the best way to make homemade noodles. My grandchildren absolutely love these. I let them put the dough through my pasta noodle press, they love to help, and they also unroll them from the log when I roll out onto the table. Have been making these since I lived at home with my parents. They are outstanding...

I was so excited to try this recipe because I got a new stand mixer. They turned out AMAZING! The first time I have ever made noodles that they ever turned out! Thanks for the great tips such as rolling the dough thinner and cutting them narrow! Love these! Can't wait to make them again! :)

This was my first time ever making egg noodles and I was so nervous.  I grew up in a household where home made meals were second to takeout and fast food so it is important to me that my family gets great nourishing meals from the heart and these noodles hit the spot. I would suggest rolling them as thin as possible because i feel mine were a little to thick but still delicious, they will definitely be a winter staple in our home for years to come

For anyone who doesn't have milk for this recipe and decides to add half and half cream instead...DON"T DO IT!..  I did...and the dough was so still I could barely roll it out. I had to stand on a chair to put my weight down on the rolling pin to get it to move. In the end I managed to make great tasting pasta, which my 4 year old said looked like french fries..lol.. she ended up eating 2 bowls of pasta. The flavour is good, and I will definitely be making again, but with milk this time...fingers crossed..

I thought this was pretty good. I made my own noodles (for the first time!) for this recipe... I didn't add the mushrooms because I knew my husband wouldn't eat it then... but my kids loved it! I'll be making it again...but I'll probably just buy egg noodles next time. Mine were just so thick! - but that's my own fault :)

Now that I've moved from altitude to sea level, it is a joy to be able to make anything with flour!   I agree with the reviewer who said to use the Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook. Make SURE you let the dough rest for the allotted 10 minutes. This is what makes the noddles nice and stretchy.  I also used my lasagna attachment to get the dough to the right thickness (setting #2). I separated the dough into three sections and made a roll to fit within the rollers. I used parchment paper sprinkled with flour to catch the "lasagna" sheet.   I then used a floured pair of scissors to cut the noodles (approximately 2 x 0.5 inches each). Once cut, I grabbed a handful and made sure they were all evenly coated with flour and separate. After a period of air drying, I placed them in a warm oven (170F) for five minutes.   Since I already had a nice beef stew to put on them, I just cooked them in boiling salt water for the recommended three minute. Perfect!  For those concerned about lack of flavor, yes...you can cook them in a seasoned broth. Or you can add ground herbs to the flour mixture. I actually added a little more salt (1 tsp.) to the flour mixture since I always use unsalted butter.  This is a fantastic, easy recipe and I highly recommend it.  Deb

Oh wow, these were phenomenal! I rolled out the dough and used a a glass to cut circles to make raviolis, as another reviewer suggested. I filled with the Spinach, Feta, and Pine nut ravioli filling recipe from this site. Then I folded over and crimped with a fork, as another reviewer suggested. If you use that filling recipe, you can half it, as I half twice as much as I needed. I made between 25 and 30 raviolis - Thank you for the recipe! I LOVED it.

This was my first try at making noodles, and they turned out great! I served in chicken noodle soup. I tried rolling the dough into a "cigar" then cutting it, but my dough stuck together. I ended up using a pizza cutter after I rolled the dough flat, and liked the results much better.

This is exactly what I needed for a dish my mother in law makes. She doesn't measure anything when she makes the noddles so I looked for a recipe that seemed similar and this one is dead on.  The dish is really simple. She takes a bone-in smoked ham and boils it for about 3 hours until it's fall off the bone tender. You might need to keep on adding water as needed. Then, she removes the ham and cuts it up. She adds potatoes (in chunks) to the liquid and cooks until tender. Then, she adds the noddles and when the noodles are tender she returns the ham to the pot. That's it!! We serve it with freshly baked bread and Voila! Easy comfort food.

These are really good noodles. I use them when I make crockpot chicken noodle soup. As others have suggested, I use a pizza cutter to cut the noodles. After cutting, I then roll each noodle like a snake - just for a moment to give them a round consistency. I dry them on a cookie drying rack if I have time. Sometimes I use them almost immediately. The rounded consistency reminds me of my great-grandma's noodles. She died before I ever took an interest in cooking and she never wrote down her recipes.

I have made these several times, and they keep getting better... In my fine-tuning of this recipe, I have increased the salt to 1/2 tsp, 1/2 tsp of black-pepper, heaping-tbsp of dried-parsley... I do not dry the noodles before cooking... I use home-made chicken stock to boil these in, when about half-cooked, I add 1/2 pound of pre cooked-beef-shredded and finish cooking... Put this over buttered-lumpy-mashed-potatoes with a side of whole kernel corn and you have a meal fit for a king...

Very disappointing, the texture was okay, definitely rolling them thinner is better, but even my homemade chicken noodle soup couldn't mask how bland these noodles were.  On the plus side, I gave this 3 stars because I do think with some tweaking it would be a great recipe.   For now I'll stick with the my mother's recipe (my favorite) that calls for 3 egg yolks, 1 egg and a lot more salt.  Although I may consider trying milk and butter in it and see what happens!  Tip: a food processor fitted with the dough blade mixed the dough up beautifully.

Very good.  I didn't worry about letting the noodles dry the second time I made this because they were very hard to get off the surface without destroying them.  Be sure to roll them out as thin as possible.  I cut them with a pizza cutter. I have also made them with whole wheat flour.  I would suggest using 1/3 whole wheat, 2/3 white flour.  Then they are hearty, but not too overpowering wheaty.

WONDERFUL!  I used my mixer with the dough hook and my pasta machine to roll and cut them.  So easy. Three of us ate them all with no leftovers!  I'll definitely make them again with absolutely no changes.

This recipe is excellent. A few changes, I froze the dough for 20 minutes and added extra flour on top before putting it in boiling water. These noodles have to boil for about 20-25 minutes, so they are not as gooey in the middle. I cut them into about 1/2 inch squares because they fluff up in the boiling water. I added these noodles to the chicken noodle soup recipe I found on allrecipes.com. I made this recipe in 1 hour. I will use this egg noodle recipe for future gnocchi meals as well.

i made this recipe as is...and it was fabulous.  i did as someone else mentioned mixed the dough in my breadmaker.  My breadmaker runs for 90mins, so i let the dough mix until it looked uniform (5-10 min).  I turned it off and let the dough sit for 10 min bf rolling it out.  i used them in a recipe from this site, beef noodle soup.

Try cutting fun shapes from the dough, I used stars, hearts and gingerbread men shapes (cookie cutters) it added to the prep time, but the look on my son's face when he saw a giant Star shaped noodle was priceless.

The rest of the dough I cut up with my pizza slicer (round,rolling blade thingy) and I added a little chopped, fresh parsley to mine, yummy.

I had so many noodles I decided to try freezing half of them.  I put them on a plate in the freezer in a single layer.  After a few hours I transferred them to a freezer bag.  I used the noodles about two weeks later in a soup and they tasted just as good as the fresh ones.

I just made these noodles according to the recipe and increased the resting time to 45 minutes, I was able to roll  them very thin.  When rolled out completely and only 1/8" thick, the pasta sheet covers about 2 foot square. I dusted the top with flour, rolled the whole thing into a jelly roll and cut with a kitchen knife with no problem.  Super easy and a lot of fun to make.

After reading this recipe, I contacted my mother-n-law who is an excellent cook 
most of the time.  Her recommendation was to add 1 tsp. of baking powder, so that is what I did.  I made Beef-n-noodles with about 1/2 the noodles. I followed most all the other directions for cutting and drying. Only about 1/2 the noodles were dry enough to use.  I would recommend making them on wax paper.  Also, used my mother-n-law's suggested cooking time of 10 minutes. If you don't have a noodle cutter use your pizza cutter. Hope this is helpful information for you.  I will use this recipe with the above changes again!

I have used this recipe from my grandmothers days....(same ingredients as hers)  I love to make them in the morning, throw them in the crock pot, take your chicken stock and add a little flour to make a gravy on the stove and add the gravy and the noodles to cook on low all day.  They get all yummy!!!

This is a very good recipe, I use my pasta roller to roll them out and then cut. I wanted my noodles thick and this was just right. Mine stuck together pretty good, next time I will use flour when I am cutting them and maybe dry them flat for a few minutes before cutting into smaller shapes. Be warned this is a huge recipe, the whole recipe made way too much for my large batch of chicken noodle soup (half would have been perfect). The do come together well and roll out easily.

I used half wheat and half regular flour, just to be healthy, and this was awesome. Much better and lighter than storebought.

I have made this recipe several times.  I cut the pasta into strips and add it directly to a hot simmering pot of soup.  It cooks right along with the soup.  This recipe works well for other pasta dishes, but because it turns out kind of thick for me, I like it best in soup.

This recipe is very similar to the one my mother used when I was a child.  One tip: After rolling her dough, she would roll it jelly-roll fashion and using a very sharp knife would cut it to the desired width, then unrolled it before drying.  [I remember the first time I ever "bought" noodles at the store I felt SO terribly guilty that I couldn't confess to my mother what I had done!  Later it just became a way of life, with no guilt attached.  How could I have gone so wrong?]

Knead five minutes?!?!  These should not be kneaded.  I should have trusted my instinct.  You don't want to develop gluten because that will make them tough.  They are still good when tougher but not as good as they would be if done correctly.  it is also more difficult to roll out when they have been kneaded.  You can't get them as thin.  Treat these lightly like you would a pie crust or biscuits and they will be much better.

This is the same recipe as my grandmothers who passed it down to my mother who taught it to me. I was so excited when I found this because honestly I didn't know anyone else made them like this! FYI they are a different texture than store bought egg noodles, they are supposed to be chewy. One trick after you roll out your dough nice and thin roll th dough up like you would cinnamon rolls, from the long side up. Then just cut the rolled out dough and have your kids unroll the noodles, this was our favorite thing to do as kids. Our favorite part of the noodles was the thick end piece because its more like a dumpling. They do puff up a lot so make sure you have the right size pan.

I made these for a chicken noodle soup I was making.  I did deviate somewhat but they still turned out great.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup semolina  flour(pasta flour).  I did not use butter or salt.  They took a while to cook but their texture and taste was great.   thanks

These are my favorite noodles so far!  I made them in my kitchenaid mixer.  I did have to add a few more tbsp of flour because the dough was a bit sticky as is.  I put them in homemade chicken noodle soup.  YUM!

My family and I love homemade noodles. We've tried about 6 different recipes now including an old family favorite passed down but this one takes the cake. Very easy to work with and the taste is wonderful. Will be replacing all our noodle recipes with this one. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is a classic noodle recipe... thick and al dente when you boil them. I doubled my batch so I would have plenty of leftovers. I used two boxes of chicken stock and a can of cream of chicken to thicken.  My husband loved these.

This was my first time making noodles at home. Overall, this is a very straight-forward recipe and easy to follow. My only difficulty was rolling out the dough. I ended up rolling it into a box-like shape about 1/4 inch tall, and that into strips. In the end, the noodles looked like cut up bacon strips, but they tasted great and added a lot to the soup I made it to go with.

I made these the other day for the first time, and I've got to say they're FANTASTIC! Totally worth the time and effort to make these wonderful home made noodles. I used them in chicken & noodle casserole, (which I found here as well), and it turned out beautifully. I didn't even bother drying the noodles entirely, and they came out great. Definitely roll them out as thin as you can get them though. My family loves them!

this was the easiest noodles i have ever made and i have tried a lot of recipes. it was fast and made a great warm supper, i didn't have time to let them try but they were still great. i added them to 2 cans of cream of chicken condenced soup and 1 can of chicken broth after it was boiling and also added at the last minute some pepper and a small can of mushrooms.  will make over and over again. THANK YOU

These were easy to make, but too bland for my family.  Next time, I will use more salt in the dough and maybe add some pepper as well.  I also had a problem with them being way too thick, but that's my fault, as it was the first time I've ever made homemade noodles and I found it difficult to get them thin enough for my taste.  Plus, I'm cooking at high altitude and that always makes cooking new things a challenge!  I'll definitely try making these again, with a bit of tweaking.

these were really good.  i didn't quite understand why everyone was talking about the thickness of their noodles.. and then i made mine and realized it wasn't how thick the noodle was but rather how wide.  my poor noodles were double their original size when done boiling.  but nonetheless my girls devoured them asking for more.  will definitely be making these again and freezing them.

I put these in homemade chicken noodle soup and my husband said, "Your noodles look funny...but they sure taste delicious!" I didn't have a rolling pin so that was the most taxing part of the whole recipe - I rolled them out using a can of green beans (no joke). But they turned out really delicious! I will definitely make them again.

These are soooo.... good.  No more chicken and dumplings for me.  Just make you sure cut them narrow, they do expand a bit.  Also, I didn't have time to dry mine and they worked just fine moist.

I'm so excited about this recipe.  It was so easy to make and the family loved the noodles.  I used leftover roast and broth to cook the noodles for a new meal. I plan to use them in homemade chicken soup soon.  I just need to try and freeze a batch of noodles to see if they be just as good pre-made for future meals.

I made these for my Chicken Noodle Soup.  They were delicious however I did have some issues cutting them and hanging them.  I used a pizza cutter which was easy but I was working on my counters which are tiled.  Bad idea! When I went to hang to dry, a bunch fell on the ground :( So my advice- use a flat surface to roll out and cut, and if you're hanging to dry- do it over your clean countertop just in case!  Other than that I'm extremely excited I made noodles and they were perfect in my soup!

These noodles are AMAZING! I make them with chicken noodle soup, and they are always a hit. They are one of my favorite comfort foods.  When I make them in soup, they freeze very well, also. (not that we have much left over to freeze!) I wouldn't change one thing about this recipe. It's perfect!

I love this recipe. I use 1/2c V8 juice or tomato sauce in place of the milk to add a little extra color (and healthiness) to the noodles and my kids cant even taste it. I also will make up many batches in by bread machines and cut and freeze them for quick use later.

I am impressed!  Not only are they incredibly easy to make (I've never made noodles before) but they are delicious too!  I can't wait to try the recipe again and flavor the dough like another reviewer said.  Maybe even mix in various mashed veggies so I can get my picky 6 year old to eat more veggies.  The food coloring idea sounds great, too.  But just this basic plain egg noodle dough is definitely a keeper!

I've tried 4 different pasta recipes in 4 days since buying the Kitchen Aid pasta maker attachments. This is by far the best and the easiest. All the other recipes were too dry and lacked flavor. I made large butternut squash raviolis with this dough....AMAZING! I'll never use anyother recipe! THANK YOU!

Awesome, my family won't eat store bought noodles anymore, great in chicken soup.    BUT, make sure you put at least 1 tsp of salt, and roll them thin and make small noodles,because they really fill out when cooked, more so than packaged ones. A must try for everyone, I used half freshly ground wheat for half the white flour, and still turned out awesome.

This is a great recipe! I had never made egg noodles or any kind of noodles before and these turned out great! I will definetly make these many more times. One tip I have is to make sure your surface is generously floured before rolling out or they will stick to the counter. Happy Cooking!!

This was my first try at making homemade pasta and I was very pleasantly surprised by how easy it was and how good they were.  I will definitely be hard pressed to go back to store bought noodles.  I used these in chicken noodle soup and served them with beef stroganoff....and they were a big hit!  Used my KitchenAid with dough hook to mix and that worked great....I have now purchased the pasta roller attachment since I plan on making more pasta in the future!

These noodles were great in my chicken noodle soup. They reminded me of my grandma's noodles when I was a kid.  I should have rolled them out a little thinner but the family loved them. Thanks for a great recipe!

Exactly what I was looking for! The noodles have a wonderful texture and are the perfect addition to my homemade broth-based soups. The dough is easy to work with, and my children love to help shape it into noodles.

Thanks for this recipe.  I spent years trying to replicate the egg noodles and "sauce" my grandmother used to make, and this with a minor modification seems to be exactly the way to go.  I found an "Amish" Egg Noodle recipe that recommended boiling in chicken broth (or turkey broth?) for at least TWENTY minutes.   The result was that with the exact same ingredients in this recipe, a nice healthy "gravy" was produced by the noodles.    Grandma always served her noodles as a side dish for Thanksgiving, and this combo recipe nailed the tastiness and sauce consistency.  I did a test run tonight.   I do think she put parts of the turkey in to boil with the noodles.  I'll probably put some turkey drippings in (apple and apple juice based) to see how it turns out.  Thanks again!

1st time making homemade noodles & it was very easy & they were very good.  I used 1/4 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup half-&-half, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  We cooked 1/2 the recipe last night (i threw a few Knorr tomato & beef boullion cubes into the water) & i froze the remainder to cook another night.  Will definitely make this again!  Next time, however, i'll divide the dough into 2 or more portions before rolling out, as we found we preferred the much thinner noodles i cut from the edges over the thicker ones from the center of the rolled dough.

Thank you! I used to always make our chicken noodle soup with storebought dried out egg noodles. But it started bothering me that my darling stepson always preferred the canned homestyle chicken noodle soup at his mom's house, over the soup that I'd spend a lot more time on. So then I got my mom's egg noodle recipe and my soup instantly became the best soup ever. However, it was a simple recipe like 1 cup flour, 1 egg, half a shell of milk. This recipe is signifcantly better. ;) Thanks again.

I made no changes to the recipe with the exception of following the yellow food coloring tip from "purduejennings."  I've frozen my noodles for making soup tomorrow, but I did try a few - they are very yummy and they will make a wonderful addition to homemade soup. :-)

These were so easy.  I usually use a recipe for dumpling strips, which have a great tender flavor, but take a long time to prepare because I have to cut in shortening.  With this recipe I used the suggestion to put it in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  I was even able to double the recipe and it came out perfect.  The dough was nice and stretchy and so easy to work with.  This will be my new noodle recipe and I'll just save the other one for special occasions.

I've never made noodles before and didn't really know what to do at every step. My dough was pretty sticky so I added some flour, but I wasn't sure what it should feel like. I also forgot to knead the dough for 5 minutes and have no idea what "dry" noodles should feel like. Despite this, my noodles turned out pretty good. Mine were thick, so I called them dumplings. Evidently, this is a very flexible recipe. Thanks for inspiring me to try pasta making!

Easy recipe that tastes great; I tend to roll 'em thin and eat them with sauce. I especially loved the tip about rolling the dough and slicing noodles off the end to work quickly and make the noodles more consistent--gives the noodles a professional look.

I'm used to egg noodles that take a few more eggs, so I was eager to try these.  They turned out very good.  The dough was very malleable, and tasted quite good.  Because I wasn't fixing for a lot of people, I froze half the dough (after cutting and drying) and am interested to see how those noodles will turn out.  I will be making these everytime I'm craving chicken noodle soup.

I have made these noodles twice (as beef and noodles) and they are very much like the noodles you would get in an Amish restaurant or store (like Das Duchmans Essen Haus). I didn't hand roll them I used my Kitchenaid Noodle roller and cutter attachments. When using a machine I found it was good to work in small pieces and reflour often working from thicker to thinner slowly to keep the correct texture and shape. I worked in small batches flouring each batch before setting aside to dry. This is messy but worth every bite. I found that making them too thin just didn't have the same homemade feeling you got with a thicker noodle. I cooked them in beef both and added some garlic powder to the dough to add a kick. I precooked the beef in a beef and onion broth the day before and let it simmer for 5 hours so it was extra tender. I added the noodles to the mixture after they were cooked. This recipe is one for the file and one to pass on.

Traditional homemade egg noodle recipe but this is the first one I have made where it made a nice size batch!  Love these and I roll them out and cut them with a pizza cutter to speed up the process.  They boil up so fast and I served them with the "Beef and Noodle" recipe on this site.

I'm brand new to making noodles so I tried this today using the exact ingredients and then using my Kitchen Aid hook to kneed it.  I did small batches to roll out, and the pizza cutter to make "noodles".  Pretty flour-y and kinda rubbery - I may try it again as I learn this process, but all in all?  Not worth the time to me - I'll just go to the store instead ;)

These turned out excellent! I used my bread machine on the dough cycle and let it do all of the work.  No more store bought frozen egg noodles.

Good recipe. I've made a few noodles in my time and would like to offer some tips. First of all, when rolling out dough, try using cornstarch for that phase. Somehow  makes it easier. Then, once you have your dough as thin as you want it, dust it well with cornstarch and roll it up like jellyroll. Use a sharp knife and slice your noodles to width. Unroll to dry of course. At one time I used a folding laundry rack for hanging my noodles to dry.

I probably did something wrong, but I really wasn't too happy with these. I decided I would substitute half a cup of white flour for wheat flour, and all I could taste was wheat. Also, they are VERY thick and hard to eat if you don't spend an hour cutting them in tiny, tiny, strips. There's got to be a better recipe somewhere!

Next time I'll divide the dough into two and make thinner noodles as well as adding a bit more salt to the dough when making the noodles. Good for a thicker chicken and noodles soup.

I give this recipe 5 stars for two things...nostalgia and taste.  This recipe took me back to when I was a child in the 60's and we would go to Gramma's for Sunday dinner.  This is the same exact recipe that she used and got from her mother.  This recipe was used in our family since before the 30's I believe.   I never knew the exact ingredients, but I remember sitting on a stool next to gramma as she put everything in the bowl (gramma never measured anything out, she did it by pinches of this and handfuls of that) and mixed it together and then rolled it out and she'd give me a small piece to roll out with my own little rolling pin.  Thanks for bringing the memories back and providing the recipe.

There were very good.  All I had in the house was soy milk, and they turned out yummy.  These reminded me of my Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother's egg noodles.  She simmered hers in chicken stock and cooked them until almost all the stock was reduced.  Now if I can just get the ratio right.

Had a random craving for egg noodles like the ones my mom used to make when I was little.  I knew they were pretty easy - but couldn't remember how.  This was exactly like she used to make and were the perfect addition to my chicken soup!

I had never made noodles from scratch before so this was the perfect recipe for me.  It was easy and tasted great.  I did make a little change by using buttermilk and by adding a little dry basil to the mix.  It added great flavor.  Next time I will be sure to roll the dough out as thin as possible because mine were a little on the thick side.

Made this with two friends for our husbands.  We had some store bought pasta on hand in case of a disaster- which we fully expected- but these turned out amazing!  I probably won't be making them too often simply because they are a bit tedious for my style, but they would definitely be fun once in a while!

Never made egg noodles before b/c I thought it would be too difficult.  These were perfect - rolled out easily and flavor was just like the noodles my grandmother, mom, and dad used to make. Lots of positive comments from my family.  I did take advice of others and added some garlic powder and onion powder to the mix.  Also dried in the oven on 170 degrees for a little while before dropping into my soup.  Next time I will make a double batch and freeze some.

Very easy good tasting recipe.  This was the first time I had ever made my own pasta.  I used it to make lasagna noodles.  Everyone complimented and asked how I got the noodles to melt in your mouth. I will definately use this again.

I've made these noodles several times now, and they're awesome!  I think if I ever put store-bought noodles in chicken noodle soup again, my husband would revolt!  I usually make them the day before and dry them on cookie-cooling racks on the counter all day.  I roll them out pretty thin (1/8"ish), because they fluff up quite a bit when you cook them.  I've been cutting them with a pizza cutter, but I'm going to have to try Holly's tip of rolling them into a log!  Genius!  It would be faster AND make transferring the noodles to drying racks soooo much easier!  One tip: remember that the noodles are going to be covered in a light coating of flour, which will thicken your soup, so make sure you have plenty of liquid in the soup!

Great recipe. Have made it several times and keep forgetting to write a review.  My husband and kids loved the thick homemade noodles and it is really easy enough to do anytime.  Have not had to buy egg noodles since finding this recipe.  thanks!

This was my first attempt at homemade noodles...  It was quite a bit of "rolling" work - but sooo good!!  I made Turkey noodle soup and added these - my husband and I loved it!!  I will use this recipe from now on.  (I did not let them air dry - I just dropped them in as soon as I finished rolling....still great!

These noodles turned out great! They were very easy make and to roll out (which I absolutely hate doing)!  I rolled them out real thin and sliced them thin too for noodle soup and it was excellent!

This was a great recipe.  I let my daycare kids cut out the shapes.  It was an interesting looking chicken and noodles, but they had a blast and really enjoyed eating them too.

I just made these and they were awesome!  I used about 1/2 of the noodles to make homemade chicken noodle soup and took the rest to and used it for butternut squash ravioli.  Both turned out really great.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy!

These noodles were perfect! I've tried to make noodles before, but they didn't turn out quite like I wanted. I cooked noodles in turkey broth, and added frozen veggies..mmm good! The noodles are great as is, but next time, just for kicks, I plan to add basil & garlic. Thanks for sharing!

My grandmother used to make homemade egg noodles and I used her recipe for years.  I actually tried this recipe instead and it is something about the additional ingredients vs. g-ma's recipe that really make the noodles pop.  I serve them at thanksgiving annually and I've been told by the family to never go back to the old recipe!  Grandma had only used flour, eggs, and salt.  The added milk and butter just make this recipe BETTER!  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  PS:  Last year instead of chicken broth I made turkey broth and the noodles took an additional step up in flavor.  Highly recommend!

Great tasting noodles.  Just make sure you get them rolled out thin enough and cut them small enough.

This recipe was definitely easy.  I used my KitchenAid mixer with the pasta roller/cutter attachments on thickness setting of 4.  Setting of 4 on the pasta roller is about the thickness of store bought fettuccini.    I cooked the noodles al dente.  I liked the taste of the noodles, but I was not so keen on the texture. I felt that these noodles did not have the ‘tooth’ that I look for in noodles.  I’m wondering if I a substitute some semolina flour would help the texture.

My family loved these noodles. This was the first recipe I have ever used and will probably be the only one too. I will do as others suggested and roll the dough out thinner and cut narrower noodles.

These were good- they had a old-fashioned homemade flavor.  I mixed them up in my Kitchenaid.  Make sure you use plenty of flour when rolling these.

These noodles were very tasty and easy to make! I didn't have time to let them dry completely, and they still cooked up well and tasted great! I boiled them in beef broth instead of water; this gave the noodles extra flavor. Thanks for a good any easy recipe!

These noodles have a really comforting homemade taste, and they're soooo easy to make. I put them in some chicken soup for my boyfriend when he was sick, and he loved them. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

This is my recipe that I have used for over 50 years.!!! But now I change it by adding either beef or chicken base from Cosco or Sams to the dough mixture and get even a better flavored noodle.  All time favorites for my friends and family   BARBARA

These were just the right flavour though I think I will need to learn how to make them not quite so tough or thick. Otherwise. They were a hit for supper!

I make these noodles every time I make chicken soup. I want to try to make some stroganoff with them sometime as well. I never realized how easy homemade noodles are to make - and it's definitely worth the little extra effort!!

LOVE IT!  This recipe is very simple to make and tastes so good.  To save on time, I dryed out my noodles in my toster oven on low for a couple of minutes instead of leaving them out to dry.  This recipe was great with my homemade turkey noodle soup.  Thanks =)

I have made egg noodle for years using my grandmas recipe. I decided to try something new. This recipes is so good. The next day the noodles are just as good as the first, they arent all mushy like most noodles get. I will be using this recipe from now on. Sorry Granny.

I don't know what I did wrong. Followed this recipe exactly, turned out a gluggy sticky mess. Added a whole lot more flour to it but it was still very sticky and hard to work with. Let it sit for about half an hour...still couldn't work with it. I ended up not using it, fearing that the result would be a tough rubbery noodle...

I have made this 4 times in the last week! We can't seem to get enough and company continues to rave and devour them! Excellent! Thanks you! I did change flour to 3 cups, salt to 1/4 teaspoon, and milk to 1/2 & 1/2. Also added 4 drops of yellow food coloring.

This is a great recipe!!! If you have a problem with the noodles being tough, just cook them longer. 
Be sure to cut them small if usng them for soup so you don't have to cut them in the bowl. My daughter suggests using a pizza cutter and cut in random shapes and just air dry while making the rest of the soup.

Love this recipe and we use it all the time! Homemade noodles are so much tastier, healthier, and cheaper. We have a pasta maker, so I think that takes a lot of the work out of it. We sometimes have friends over for a big pot of homemade chicken noodle soup and it always gets rave reviews. Just a little more effort than buying noodles, but the satisfaction is unbeatable (unless maybe you bought fresh noodles, and I'm sure that certainly wouldn't be cheaper)!

I had difficulty rolling these out thin enough. After I cut them I let them air dry over a clothes hanger for about 2 hours and then put them in soup.

I made these noodles for home-made chicken noodle soup. They were very good - much heartier and tastier than what you would buy at the store. I will definitely make again.

I made these last night with some homemade chicken soup, exactly as the recipe said they turned out really well.  I made them mid morning to let them adequately dry out, but next time I will probably make them close to the time of adding to the soup.  I will also roll them out thinner. I separated them after cutting and let them dry on a kitchen towel on the counter. They took to long to cook.  Next time I will try to use some whole wheat flour, and smart balence instead of butter.  I also would like to try egg substitue to make a cholesteral free version. I will definately make again, they made my soup extra special with not much effort.

This is by far the best noodle recipe I have ever made, better than my moms old one.  I even used fat free milk so next time I am going to try it with wheat flour to make it even better for my family.

These tasted great, but they turned out a bit thick.... My fault though. It says 1/8 to 1/4 and that is almost pushing it. it's an easy recipe to fallow.

These turn out great for my big pot of chicken noodle soup. Though I have never let the noodles dry before putting them in the pot. I just make them right after I put the chicken on to cook and cut them. Then put them in about 40 minutes later.

Noodles were very heavy and pasty.  Made exactly as stated in the recipe, my husband and I found these to be  quite unpleasant.  Very likely the addition of some baking powder would be helpful, but I won't waste the time or ingredients to make this recipe again.

My grandmother and mom made such good noodles, I wish I had watched them!  This is the best recipe I found but they never turn out right.  Takes forever to cook them, the broth all cooks off and I have to keep putting on broth.  I tried cooking them in water first then finishing them in broth, but still takes them forever to get tender.  And yes I've rolled them so then before cutting them they are thin enough.  Don't have a clue what I'm doing wrong.  They end up good but just not thin and tender.

I have never made noodles before this recipe and it was incredibly easy. The dough was very workable and the noodles tasted great. The next time, however, I will roll the dough out even thinner. (1/8" thick max) and cut thinner noodles. They were just too thick, but I will make these again.

Follow up review: Recently made this with my 12 year old grandson who is a noodleholic. He thoroughly enjoyed the whole process of making and, of course, eating the noodles. I have made these on several occasions. They are easy and taste great. I also purchased a pasta maker to standardize the thickness and the width so now they are perfect.

I added another egg and just dropped little pinches of dough into rolling chicken stock. They were very bland and tasted too much like flour by themselves. They are definitely not as "eggy" as I would like. After cooking in the stock and absorbing the flavor and salt, they were fine.

Fantastic noodles!! My family likes the thicker noodles so I cut the in 1" squares, boiled them in chicken stock, teamed them up with my chicken and gravy and put it over some nice hot biscuits.

These remind me of how my Mother always made. The only difference, she never used milk or water. If she was making beef and noodles or chicken and noodles, she always used the beef or chicken broth. Gives your noodles a lot more flavor.

I tried this recipe today and the ingredients were pretty much the same as my moms recipe.  However, I did find the mixture a little dry and added a little more milk.  My mom didn't use egg whites, only the yolks.  I used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook attachment and mixed until it formed a ball and then kneaded for 5 minutes.  I wrapped in Saran wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.  I have my moms pasta machine, which is a manual machine, and was able to roll the dough through the machine on several settings until I got the thickness that I liked.  The first batch that I cooked was a little to thick for me and so reduced the thickness with a lower setting. I don't like thick noodles and I don't like them cooked al dente, my only 2 complaints with this recipe which is why I gave it a 4. I served it with my grand mothers chicken broth recipe.  Takes me back to my childhood when my mom would make this dish.

Very tasty noodles! Can't beat homemade. I used olive oil instead of butter and used an extra egg, less milk to make up for the extra egg. Taste was divine. By hand I couldn't roll them thin enough, so they were pretty thick once cooked. I'd get a pasta machine if I had enough self control to not eat theses noodles daily. ;) I'll make them again. Hubby and kids lapped them up.

Great recipe I use this all the time for anytime I need noodles. My little tidbit is I roll out the dough in a big circle. The use a pizza cutter to cut the noodles. Its much easier and saves a lot of time.

Just like my mom made except I used the chicken broth instead of the milk.  Put's a little more flavor in the noodle. Must of been good cause by the time the family ate, there were no leftovers.

I made this egg noodle recipe tonight. I added and extra egg to the recipe and divided the dough into manageable pieces so that I could roll them thin. Worked very well.

These noodles are just like my grandpa used to make when he made his *famous* beef stroganof. I have been using this recipe for the last few years for noodles for my chicken noodle soup. 
They are just... divine. 
I live in Utah and (I assume altitude has something to do with it) have to add about 2 Tbs more milk, or I just have a floury mess. 
But overall, this is, by far, the best egg noodles recipe I have tried.

I loved them. I am 73 years old and my mother and grand mother used this recipe. On thanksgiving they would make these noodles. They would make there own chicken brouth and put these noodles together 
and called it Chicken (N) Dumplings WOW was they good. My wife would
make them 1 time a month. That is what you call chicken N dumplings.

I DID TRY THIS RECIPE...and I made one small - no very large change...I used Trader Joe's gluten free flour mix.  It was great.  No other changes and followed instructions as is.  Very simple and very good.  Neither my husband or I are gluten intolerant but my daughter and 2 little grandsons are.  My daughter loved my mom's homemade chicken and noodles.  My mother has been gone for many years and my daughter is now 43 but can still remember Grammies home made noodles.  I have noodles in the freezer for you daughter...

I have been using this recipe for over a year now and would not use another, everyone raves about them and wants the recipe. A pizza wheel, or any wheel with a scalloped edge works wonderfully.they plump beautifully even when you do not dry them. I have rolled them, cut them and thrown them in the pot on many occasions and they always turn out wonderful.

This recipe is a keeper! We only made one batch before deciding if we want to make a big load to freeze, these were worth it. We did make some changes as we are dairy free. I replaced the milk with almond milk and the butter with olive oil. Absolutely delicious.

Very easy to make, but not much flavor. I topped them with browned butter and that helped. Would be better with stroganoff or other meat/sauce topping than plain.

I made the recipe exactly as described. Noodles came out doughy and too chewy. The only way I would make them again is to try them through a pasta machine. Maybe making them thinner will make them palatable.

When I am really in a hurry, I simply tear off pieces of the dough without rolling it.  Tear and toss them into the boiling soup and cook.  Kids like the pieces that are like little dumplings. 
Thanks for a great recipe!!

I am 18 and this is the first time I have ever tried making noodles. I must say it was an excellent recipe to start with. It was easy and the process fun. The dough was just a little bit too sticky but I made it work. When the noodles had dried I cooked them with some soup starter and they just soaked up the flavor. A good recipe for great noodles.

These noodles were very tasty.  This was my first attempt at homemade noodles and it won't be the last.  I used the noodles in chicken and noodles and it was great.  The dough was very easy to work with.

These were great. As someone who has never made homemade noodles, I felt very accomplished and impressed with the results. They're so homey; thicker than regular noodles, fabulous taste, and a wonderful texture. I had cut the recipe in half for just two of us. These are fasntastically easy, also. For those of you who have never made homemade noodles, they take  a lot longer to cook, but they are so worth it! Worth the effort to have completely home made noodles. Bravo, thanks for the recipe!

These are a little bland even in a flavorful soup, but take on more flavor the longer they sit in a broth. If you don't let them dry as long, they are more like little dumplings than noodles (which I like).

Yummy noodles. This was my second time making noodles by hand, no pasta machine roller. I rolled the dough as thin as I could ( it is pretty dense) with rolling pin and used pizza cutter to cut thin strips. Much better than first time which was too thick and wide and doughy. I will double recipe next time as it was only enough for two or three.

Ahhh, just like my momma used to make! Delicious!! But to those who are fussing because these are too thick, well the answer is as simple as rolling your dough a bit thinner. Problem solved! ;)

I just made these for turkey noodle soup (the last of the Thanksgiving leftovers, yay!). This was such an easy recipe! I mixed and kneaded by hand and was blown away by how it came together. Another egg noodle dough I've used for dumplings has never come out this fast and easy. We just moved and I haven't found my rolling pin, so I improvised with a heavy drinking glass. I didn't change anything, and as others have done on here I used a pizza cutter to slice the dough (and threw them right into the pot of boiling soup). Thank you for the keeper! I'm looking forward to using them with other recipes.

I had my husband mix the dough, he said it was easy. It came out great. I hand cut the noodles. The noodles were very very good the entire family loves them.

Made these for Tuna Noodle Casserole, I had no egg noodles, and fresh pasta ALWAYS taste better anyway!  :D   I made them as instructed, I think mine turned out a little thinner than the ones in the picture, which was fine.  :)  Be careful to not to overcook them, as they get mushy fast.  But i felt they actually tasted exactly like store bought, but with a softer, yet still chewy, texture.  I wont use any other recipe, for me, this is the perfect egg noodle.  :D    

God Bless ~Amy

These were very good!  Reminds me of the kind the old Polish wedding cooks used to make (yes, I'm part Polish)!  They weren't very pretty to look at but they were easy and tasty!

I make ham and noodles   every time i have left over ham from holiday dinner. these are perfect in the  boiled ham bone juice/water. I only let them dry about 30 minutes on the counter.  They take in all the flavor of the broth and just make it fantastic. Thank you

Thank you Thank you for this delish recipie. This was my first time of making homemade noodles and will not be my last. My Italian friend tried them and wanted the recipe. I made the 10 portion and added white pepper, garlic powder and onion salt straight to the dough while mixing. ( I used my bread machine as well.) Next time I will roll out thinner but I cut wide strips ( great for noodle sandwiches ). I know what my Christmas presents this year is going to  be. again Thank You!

This recipes rocks.  I've made at least 18 pounds=1 batch of noodles without a single modication.  Little bit of flour to keep dough from sticking.  My family & Church love these.

These were fun to make and very easy. I followed the recipe as written and had no problems.  The noodles were delicious!  I did cook them longer because we do not like our noodles al dente.  I used the bread hook on my Kitchenaid.

Always hard to go wrong with homemade noodles, and these did not disappoint.  So much like the homemade noodles I remember from childhood.  Now I have no excused for not making them more often.

This is a fantastic recipe.  This brought back memories of grandma's noodles (and tasted just as good raw as her's).  I dried them in the oven on 170 degrees and made them the day before I needed them.  There is nothing that says home made goodness like homemade chicken noodle soup with homemade noodles!

Very good taste.  The butter in the recipe makes the noodles thicken or swell when you drop them into the broth, which then makes them take longer to cook through the dough.  They are just as good without the butter.  Be sure to roll them very thinly.

These are amazing! My father is a long time fan of egg noodles, so much to the point that he will go get store bought egg noodles.  I tried my had at home made noodles for Thanksgiving (gutsy, I know) and my father will never go back to store bought.  I am thinking I need to purchase a noodle press now.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good basic egg noodle.  Used a pizza cutter to cut them and it was quick and easy, when I tried another suggestion of rolling the dough into a log and slicing, I didn't care for the uneven shape where the sides folded from the pressure of the knife.

These noodles are very good. They turned out thicker than I thought they would be but that could be the cook as this is only my 3rd time making noodles from scratch.  These are better than the frozen egg noodles you buy in the store but not as good as my grandma's noodles.

This is the 2nd time that I have made these now.  I do use my kitchenaid with the bread hook.  I also use these noodles to make my own chicken and noodles.  Using chicken, onion, celery and broth.  Delicious.  Reminds me of a dish that my mom made a very long time ago. True comfort food.

I have been looking for a noodles recipe that makes these delicious noodles for years. These are just like my mother and grandmother used to make. I used 4 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs as my mother used to.

Amazing!  I've never made noodles before and was quite frankly skeptical that something so simple could really be so tasty. I'm sorry I waited so long to try!  Perfect for my turkey noodle soup.  Will make again and again....can't wait to show it off!

Wonderful recipe.  An easy way to cut them-roll them out and then use your pizza cutter to slice through them.  Easy as pie-I mean noodles!!

great recipe. i used my kitchenaid. i used half the recipe for lasagna roll ups that day and froze the other half. i pulled out the dough and let it thaw in the fridge overnight. the second half i just tore off little bits for dumplings. i threw them in raw towards the end of cooking time in a slow cooker stroganoff recipe. turned out really great

These were very good.  Took quite a bit of time to make, but really they weren't too difficult.  I ended up splitting the dough into three portions to make thin noodles, wider noodles, and ravioli-like pasta.  For those I cut out tiny circles and folded them in half over a mixture of spinach, egg, feta cheese, and pepper.  They were great in a soup a few days later.  They freeze well also.

Well...this must be easy enough. I've made it twice already. Once was a sort of impromptu "What shall we do for dinner?" moment, and quick calculations suggested this in chicken broth with some veggies and a bit of crumbled sausage. >>> I am still working on my technique; my noodle results are not as tender as I would like, yet, but I do think it has to do with my novice standing. I'll keep on.

These are great! I have never made any kind of pasta before so I was a little skittish of this recipe. I am soooooo glad I tried it! They are WONDERFUL in my chicken noodle soup! I am going to try subbing the V8 next time and see how that goes!

I'm of Czech descent and these came out just like the soup noodles I'm accustomed to. So if you prefer thicker, dumpling-style noodles, as opposed to pasta or slippery packaged egg noodles, this is the recipe you've been looking for! I don't use butter so I added the same amount of olive oil, I also had a bit of leftover cooked polenta which I added about 1/8 c. of to give it some tooth. Then used the pasta dough cycle on my bread machine and followed all the other instructions as written. Texture was perfect and the right amount for 1 pot of chicken noodle soup. You can also freeze these if you don't plan to use them right away.

The taste was great but the dough was very tough to roll thin. Not sure how to fix that or whether that's how it is supposed to be. The end result was thick noodles, but they were delicious.

The taste of these noodles reminded me of the ones my grandmother would make for thanksgiving.  I made these for chicken and noodles, and unfortunately I was becoming pinched on time, and didn't allow them to totally dry out.  Which then turned into Chicken with a thick broth, with bits of noodles, because they dissolved. I will remember to allow more drying time in the future.  Otherwise, a great recipe.

Quite tasty and easy to make. I made the noodles too big but the right thickness so next time I'll have to cut them thinner. Served with Beef and Vegetable Ragout from Allrecipes and boiled edamame.

I just made a double batch of this, and while it is very good taste wise, the thickness is just too much. I think 1/16in would be much better unless you plan to cook these in a rustic stew, where "heartier" noodles are desirable. Everyday chicken noodle soup will need thinner noodles. But overall, I really like this recipe.

I really liked these noodles for my chicken noodle soup! I will surely make them again one day. My only problem, I forgot to let them rest and rolled immediately after kneading and they still came out yummy. My whole family loved the soup!

These puffed up a lot when they were cooked.  I rolled mine to about 1/8 inch and they were still VERY thick.  They were like noodle dumplings...which were kind of tasty, but not what I was expecting.  After rolling these out, I hung them on a coat hanger to dry.

I didn't read all of the reviews but I use a pasta machine to "roll" my noodle dough out.  It works so easily and my noodles are all the same thickness.

These were the perfect egg noodles to make! I've been using my grandmother's recipe forever, with problems every time, it always came out too dry and crumbly and would never come together. This one all came together within a few strokes of the spoon. Defiantly a keeper!!!

Quick and easy to make, I didn't let them dry long.  Cooked in 6C broth with some shredded left over roast and gravey and thickened it a little.  Made some fresh "Country Green Beans" with another recipe from this site. These noodles turned left overs into a great new meal - my husband said YUM!

This was my first attempt and I was so proud.  It was fun too.  I used plastic hangers to dry the pasta.  I had them hanging all over the kitchen.  A day I'll remember with a smile, especially  since my family thought they ROCKED!

This was my very first time making noodles and I had a great time. The whole family liked them (DH, and 6 yo daughters included). The dough was perfectly fine for my pasta maker. I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe (though might try to flavour with herbs next time!). I did use Australian measuring cups (which contain slightly more than US ones), perhaps that helped my dough! :)

These are both awesome and easy - especially since I cheat and use the dough hook on my mixer.  I made the mistake of halving the recipe the first time I made it, since it's just two adults and two picky kids.  I always make the full recipe now.  I use a heavy french pin to roll it out, then use a pizza cutter to make skinny strips.  I lay them over the rolling pin to dry.  Really good - husband now refers to these as 'the good noodles'.

Excellent recipe, hubby and sons loved these, no more store bought for us!  I kneaded the dough by hand and ran it through my hand crank pasta-maker on number 3.  This was a fun recipe, the kids loved helping and eating their own homemade noodles.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

First time I ever made egg noodles.  Can't believe how easy it was.  If I can offer one suggestion, roll these very very thin and cut in narrow strips.  Mine puffed up on me as they cooked and ended up a bit thicker than I like, but the family loved them.  They were delicious.

Used for Thanksgiving and made with turkey drippings and broth. Yummy, easy and absolutely no clumping. Definitely roll them to 1/8 inch and for faster drying, cut them thin.

Love this recipe! This is the same recipe my mom taught me when I was little! I use a plastic pizza cutter when I'm cutting the noodles; I find it much easier! Also, it's so easy to "spice it up" for other dishes like adding italian seasoning, etc, for chicken alfredo. 
I normally let my noodles dry, but if I'm in a hurry, I've cooked them right after cutting.

These can be made any thickness you want....I did it like my mother and the National Cookbook of 1856 advises...Roll out dough paper thin, roll up tightly like a jelly roll and cut paper thin...
Mother never put butter or milk  in them, it was at least a dozen of egg yolks, no whites ...Hers were rich, but these were just fine without all the yolks

Good basic recipe, just wish it told you how long to dry the noodles for.  I admit that the environment does affect drying times but an approximation would be helpful.

Really good noodles. I like mine much thinner, so I use a apsta roller machine to roll them to 1/16th inch and then use the fetuccini attachment to cut perfect noodles.
They still swell up, so don't worry about them being too thin. If you only roll the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, they will be a half inch thick when they cook, and that's just a nasty globby wreck. My method makes really nice thick egg noodles that aren't grossly thick. I also had seasonings to my flour before rolling. Sage, rosemary, black pepper. You can use lemon pepper, turmeric, spinach powder...anything at all :)

What a gooey mess! My noodles turned to mush when I set them to the side to air dry. They all stuck together. I tried to salvage some with no luck. I tried again from the start,but then they all clumped together into one big ball in the pot. I think I give up.:(

Hubby got me pasta roller and cutter attachments for my Kitchen Aid for Mother's Day. Already had steak soup in the Crock Pot, so I made my Very First Pasta Ever. I cooked half directly in the crock pot (rolled to a 2, fettucini cut) and I froze the rest. Next time I will let the pasta sit a bit longer before portioning so it can fully hydrate. Per another reviewer, I added black pepper to the pasta as well as salt since it was going into strongly flavored soup. Kids both asked for seconds.  Husband is extremely happy with the results, and I am ecstatic. This will be a go-to recipe. Almost foolproof!

Followed the recipe exactly and each time I make these my family wants more.  I roll them thin and slice with a pizza cutter into strips and then pieces.  I usually mix them with sauerkraut, and  serve with pork chops or smoked sausage.

i should have known, this recipe was a hoax  when it said roll it out 1/8 to 1/4 thick, i used 8 egg yolks to form a dough, let it rest for 30 min. then rolled it out  it was impossible to roll t out thinner doing so made the dough to fall a part. After cooking tasted like dough, not egg noodles

These were great.  I added them to a Turkey Noodle Soup.  The family loved them.  The only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of garlic powder when I added the salt.  Another reviewer talked about  rolling the dough and cutting the rolls.  This was easy but took some time to unravel.  Next time I might try using a pizza cutter instead.  My son was shocked that I made the noodles from scratch.  My sister in-law said it made the soup and took it up a notch.

Reminiscent of my mom’s hand made egg noodles growing up in the Midwest I decided to try this recipe. I hand cut them and rolled  them so they were thicker and they took quite a long time to cook in the turkey broth.  I did a second batch using my pasta machine and they were much thinner in a fettuccine cut. I added those to broth  and they cooked within the time on this recipe.  I think the other trick is drying time. Drying for a couple of hours and then placing them in a Ziploc bag in the fridge will cook them faster then if you allowed them to dry overnight.  The overnight drying of the hand cut created more of a dumpling texture rather than a soft noodle texture. Perfect for freezing so spend a Saturday morning having a noodle fest and you’ll enjoy the fruits of your labor for the winter months.

This was a hit with my cooks !!! I made it in my restaurant as a staff meal (to put in a tasty soup ! ) and the cooks all loved the noodles, they asked me to make more of them next time so it was more noodle to soup ratio !! A++++

This recipe is very easy to follow, and you should definitely follow the recipe to the detail.  Personally, I didn't let any of the noodles dry, which is recommended for egg noodles.  Because of this, my noodles became extra wide, almost tripling in size versus doubling.  I do recommend these noodles for a newbie

Just what I was looking for...
Easy to work with. Good texture and a nice al dente firmness.
Works very nicely with my dough hook and pasta roller.
Substituted garlic infused olive oil for butter with delightful results.

As another reviewer stated, these noodles were way too thick and tasted like flour. I rolled them out to 1/8" and thought they were too thick but this was my 1st time making them so I kept the directions spot on. Big mistake. Packaged egg noodles aren't available here so I wanted something similar in look, taste, and texture to store bought and this recipe is definitely not the one.

This recipe's instructions were fun to make with my 5 year-old daughter.   We added ranch seasoning for a bit of flavor.  Next time I will use 4 yolks instead of 2 whole eggs.

Good recipe. But I kneaded the dough for a very long time, until it became very hard (then the noodles will not spread in the broth) and also I rolled it very thinly, so that the table can be seen through the dough.
I will definitely use this recipe next time

This is the only noodle recipe I have ever known. Don't over mix, it can make dough tough. I don't cut noodles. I pinch little pieces off and dry them. Kind of like tiny dumplings. I add a bit of onion juice and a couple shakes of garlic powder. I also only use eggs straight out of the coop. Undoubtedly, the eggs make a rich, vibrant,  yellow , tasty noodle.

Very good, like mom used to make.  BUT DO NOT USE RICE FOUR!  Rice flour breaks down to mush when boiled.

This has been my go to noodles recipe  for years now. I have given them away for Christmas and have made them for guests more times than I can count, always getting rave reviews. I roll mine out very thin and this works out great for me.

I love these, growing up my gram would make these for her chicken and Dumplings and eventually I started doing the same! The kids and hubby loves it too which is a plus in my book! I've made these noodles for our family for 5 years now any time I make chicken and Dumplings! Thank you for sharing this recipe and helping others to see that they to can make their own pasta in just a few minutes!

My first time making noodles and I loved them! They did turn out thicker than I anticipated but that's okay! I also didn't let them dry at all and they were still amazing. The best noodles I've ever had!!

Okay so I just made the egg noodles and they are as so many stated very good.  And like a lot of the posters they make a ton of noodles so that's why I just made half of the recipe for a pot of chicken soup.  Here's what I did = after mixing the ingredients and kneading, I placed the dough ball in saran and let it rest in the frig overnight. 

Then since many said that they needed to be rolled thin, I cut the dough ball in half and rolled them out separately - this made it much easier to handle and roll out to a thinner consistency.

And one more tip that I followed was to put one whole tablespoon of butter in the recipe - remember I'm talking about making just half of the noodle recipe.

Then after rolling out I dropped them down in a flavorful homemade chicken broth and let them cook maybe 5 minutes or more and they were very delicious.

I think when some of the posters said that they weren't flavorful - you have to remember that noodles are not flavorful in themselves but if you have a flavorful broth and add margerine or butter to the broth you will have a very delicious noodle.  So there is nothing wrong with this recipe and I would suggest to those who were disappointed to try it again with some of these suggestions and that's what I did - so I don't take credit for my good result - because I just followed all the excellent suggestions of other posters on this website and to all of you I say thank you.  Your comments were very helpful.

Perfect noodles! I made a big pot (12 cups) of chicken noodle soup and only used half. I'm saving the rest of the dough in the fridge for a meal later this week.

This is my go-to egg noodle recipe. When we have family get-togethers (which tend to very large in numbers) I like to make a slow cooker full of these noodles, add some cooked diced chicken and a chicken gravy (could do same with beef). The cooker is always scraped clean and people ask for the recipe...

This was my first time making homemade noodles since I was a young kid helping my grandmother. For anyone with the dietary restriction of gluten, this recipe can be made using rice flour in place of all-purpose (wheat) flour in a 1:1 ratio. They turned out wonderfully!

They were easy to make but did taste a little like flour. Although after they sat in the broth over night they of course took on the flavor of the dish and were yummy.

I found it quick and easy,  I don't measure things exactly,  and I don't take extra work sifting or whipping,  just added the ingredients and mixed with a fork and they came out wonderfully.....I cooked them longer than three minutes though,  they were still very chewy at three minute...it made quite a lot....have one more batch to cook.   I just used them now,  didn't dry them.....and I roll my noodles quite thin,

Very close to how I was taught, but with water and not milk or sometimes oil. The suggestion of adding spice to the egg is spot on. If I'm using the same type noodle in beef stroganoff I'll mince up some fresh mushrooms finely to the eggs then mix. Or parsley for flavor and looks in chicken noodle soup.
Your only limited to your imagination

This came out perfect.  I had to make it again, because I didn't think there were enough for the 6 of us.  As it turned out the noodles are thicker and heavier than traditional noodles so way more filling!  I put some in the fridge to cook for later.  I used my tower cupcake rack to dry them on, it worked perfectly! I definitely will use this recipe as a standard, thank you!

This was the first time I have ever made homemade pasta, and it will NOT be the last! This yielded the perfect results for what I wanted- they were added to turkey soup using the leftover Thanksgiving turkey carcass. The dough did require quite a bit of kneading to get it smooth, but boy was it ever worth it! I used a pizza cutter to slice the thin strips of noodle, let them dry for about an hour before adding to my simmering soup. I let them cook low and slow for about 20 minutes, and they were incredibly tender and almost like dumplings. Everyone in my family was super impressed, and loved the results. Thank you for turning me on to homemade pasta!

Same recipe that my family has used for generations!  Excellent. Rolling out thin is hard because you just cannot measure. I am sure that the negative reviews came from an inexperienced noodle maker.  You eventually get a 'feel' for the thickness that you want. The ingredients are point on. The flavor comes from what you put them in to cook them. They take on that flavor.  Standing ovation!!!! Great recipe!

These are great for homemade chicken noodle soup!  I rolled them as flat as I could, cut them with a pizza cutter, and tossed them into the boiling chicken broth to cook.  

I will be using this recipe again!

Made it and loved it, just like the noodles that my grandpa makes and as a person on a tight budget it is easy and affordable. :)

I love home made noodles, and made these tonight.  I tossed in about a teaspoon or so of fresh ground black pepper and they were perfect.  By the way, if you like your noodles fluffy, add a little baking soda, and if you like them chewy, like I do, omit the oil.

My mother used to make these in the 50s and 60s, but not by rolling them out and cutting them.  She (and I) make balls about the size of a small orange, and cut the individual noodles on the palm of her hand into the boiling water, so they forma long noodle that is thicker in the middle and finer at the edges.  Toss them into a pork roast and let them cook for a while, but save some for tomorrow, when they are always better.

This is the same recipe i have used for many years , its a hand me down from grandmas to mother to me, i eve n use this dough for pierogi which i have taught my 11 year old granddaughter to make, with perfect results every time.
my advise to anyone who does not have a pasta machine to cut the noodles is to roll it out thin and cut into strips with lots of flour, stack and roll jelly roll style and cut the desired size noodles. so easy

We made these for lunch to put in our tuna noodle casserole.

I used 2 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, as I didn't have enough all purpose to do the trick. I also used a pasta machine to roll out and cut the pasta because I was given one from my mother in law.

It turned out delicious! All the kiddies loved it, too.

Slice the noodles as thin as possible, since they bulk up during cooking. This recipe turned out great.

Very easy and ran the dough through my pasta maker. Made both fettuccine and spaghetti noodles. I do not feel like they tasted like flour as some have mentioned. I also know that most people add another yolk to get a yellow color; only for presentation. These noodles were white, but tasted great!

This is a great basic recipe. I normally add another egg yolk to the dough, seems to make it richer and comes together better for me too (possibly because I always sift the flower? It isn't moist enough with just the 2 eggs, but adding the egg yolk makes it perfect -- and more yellow!). It's flavorful and delicious, perfect in chicken noodle soup. Thanks for sharing!

I made the following modifications:  1.  Used sour cream instead of milk. 2.  Used dough hook on stand mixer. 3.  divided into 4ths and rolled paper thin.  4.  cut into THIN noodles.  See picture.  They are/were great.

I had to add a fair amount of extra flour...but that always seems to be the case with fresh pasta so I was prepared. I can't say I love thick noodles, but my father has been requesting "dumpling noodles" like his mom used to make so I gave it a go. I made a half batch to put in some homemade chicken noodle soup and they were a hit so what more can I ask for? Great recipe!

These were good. We only dried them on the counter for 30ish minutes. They were not doughy like I expected them to be. Roll them super extra thin. 
My only complaint is they were a little plain.

Made these noodles for my family using my Kitchenaid stand mixer and the dough hook. I received rave reviews from the entire family. The noodles were very tender, perfect in my homemade chicken noodle soup. I will definitely be making these again, sooo easy!

These were very, very good egg noodles.  I made them for Christmas and they turned out great.  I did have to add quite a bit more flour than it called for, but that's always an ingredient that has to be adjusted.  Will definitely make these again.

Kneaded the dough in my zojirush bread maker (as I do all kneaded dough) set on manual for 12 minutes. Took Holly D's suggestion and rolled to cut. Need a dusting with a little more flour to prevent sticking when rolling up.
My daughter says the best I've made.

Perfect when cooked with chicken stock/broth. Added about 1/2 cup of butter and salt. Yum!

Yummy noodles - I did roll mine a bit thinner. This pasta dough also freezes well.

Made the dough in my KitchenAid and it came out perfectly! If they don't roll out as thin as you like at first, just cover the dough with a towel for a few minutes. Works like a charm!! Love it!!

Do love this recipe.  Reminds me of the noodles my mom and grandmother would make in HUGE batches.  I've made it according to the recipe and have even subbed the milk for water due to some dietary needs and it still was fantastic.  I will say I don't let them sit and air dry.  I use them right away.  They are the perfect noodle for a homestyle chicken noodle soup.

Great basic egg noodle.  I use the dough hook on my kitchenaid and either a pizza knife or rotary pizza cutter to cut the noodles.   One batch is enough to split into two or even three soup sized portions.  News flash for some of the negative reviewers, you can roll the dough thinner if you don't want thick noodles ;)

Great tasting smooth texture, family loves them.  Also quick and easy. I cut them with a pizza cutter to make things a bit quicker and it  does not catch on the dough like a knife as do many of the other reviewers I see. I roll mine thick or thin depending on which way I am craving them. The longer they dry the more they absorb the broth or whatever flavor they are cooked in.  I quick dry them in the oven at 200 until they are done and have even made them the day before and stored in fridge. Taste great in anything but our favorite is chicken and noodles.

Excellent recipe. My grandmother made these once a week or so. She would roll it out kind of thin, string a couple lines up in the kitchen from cabinet to cabinet and put the rolled pancakes over the line until they had dried out some. After they had dried out a bit, she would roll them like a log and then cut them. She'd sprinkle a little flour over them and with her hands shake them out a bit over the table and let them dry out for later use. I really miss watching her make noodles.

Made these tonight and they were great! I had a hell of a time rolling them out, so use a big rolling pin, or be prepared to do some work. Totally worth it, though.

I thought the noodles were great. My husbands grandma uses a similar recipe. I just did not use it because it is for 48 dozen ravioli. I did use my kitchen aide mixer attachment to roll the pasta to my desired thickness.

This is almost exactly like my grandmothers recipe that I've struggled with for years. My biggest issue was getting the noodles to dry in a timely fashion. This recipe uses a 1/2 cup more flour and butter instead of vegetable oil. I made a double batch this Thanksgiving and they turned out perfect. Cooked them in the turkey juices and drippings and OMG, they were the best ever!

My boyfriend and I absolutely love his mother's chicken noodle soup over mashed potatoes, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make noodles like her... This recipe is just is good, if not better than hers. I've fallen in love with these, and plan to make more tonight for my sick boyfriend. ?

P.S.: I *LOVE* the thickness of these. If they're not thick, you're doing it wrong in my opinion c;

These noodles are great and to those that think they are too thick just roll them thinner if that's what you're looking for. For me that is one of the things that make this an excellent recipe.

I tried this for dinner last night, just the noodles. Loved it. We used the noodles to go with short Ribs turned out wonderful. To cut my noodles I used a cutter I bought in Bologna Italy at a kitchen store. The texture of the noodles was excellent and I recommend to everyone. Thanks

These are wonderful!  The dough is a pleasure to work with.  I see that a lot of people are complaining that the finished product is "too thick".  LOL Well why didn't they just roll the dough out to their preferred thickness?  That's silliness.  I have made these thick, thin and I've even simply pinched off small pieces of dough when I didn't feel like rolling them out.  No matter what way I've done them, they have turned out perfect.  I use this recipe in stroganoff, soups and just plain buttered noodles.  You really cannot go wrong with this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent, I followed the recipe, except that I added a bit more salt, some black pepper and French Thyme to the noodles. I made this in my Cuisinart mixer with the dough hook. Wonderfully easy to roll out, a nice tender dough, not too sticky. I used the noodles in homemade chicken noodle soup. The family loved it!

First time making homemade noodles. These are the best. I just added my own spices and such. May have to add a little more milk than a 1/2 cup, I did. But all in all GREAT.

This is the only recipe I use. Watched my grandmother make noodles without a recipe and was never able to get it quite right. I know this isn't close to her recipe...she didn't use milk...but my family loves these!  Roll them out thinner than you think is necessary, they plump as they cook.

This is my go to recipe for noodles!!!  I should have rated it awhile ago.  I love them and how thick and hearty they are.  Sometimes if I'm lazy I just pinch the dough off in 1/2 inch sizes pieces and toss them in soups and stews.  My kids love to help me and it's just plain fun.

I let dough rest for about a half hour - even longer at times. I made 4 batches today to give as Christmas gifts. I rolled thinner (you can roll to any thickness you want) and they are drying nicely. These are very very good noodles - it rolled out very well  after the resting, used tons of flour for rolling and cutting and they are perfect. Thank you for a fab recipe!!  Cooked up beautifully - just like grandma used to make.

these noodles were great and super easy my husband will refuse to eat egg noodles and less they are super thick so this work out to my advantage well I did cut him to the eighth inch and they were huge but that was perfect for us if you do want thinner I do suggest rolling them out more cuz they do plump up quite a bit when you cook them

I made these exactly as the recipe called for. I cooked them in vegetable broth and vegetable stock adding water and salt, pepper, and parsley.

I gave it 4 stars because everyone liked them. I did not give it 5 stars because it is seriously lacking in salt. I had to add salt to it and I am not a huge salter. I tend to under do the salt figuring others can add at the table. This was too bland even by my standards. It depends heavily upon the food that covers it. I think either I will try it again with more salt. If it is still bland I will look for  simpler recipe. For something so bland I would prefer not to waste so many ingredients.

Good recipe, just like g-ma's. I rolled the dough in a similar fashion to cinnamon rolls and then cut the roll down in 1/2 in. increments.  Don't forget to use quite a bit of flour in order for the dough not to stick (you can get off any undesired flour if you want).  They taste extremely good if you boil them in homemade chicken broth, or use the canned version of broth.  The extra flour acts to thicken the broth, add salt and pepper to taste.

I tried this recipe and it's not quite as good as my grandmothers, but it is pretty close. It's a pretty simple recipe but it's not that easy. I ended up rolling out half of my dough at a time so I could make it a little bit thinner.

Fantastic, easy and better than what I had growing up.  Do use adequate flour when rolling and roll them thinly--probably the thinner the better.  While they CAN be put directly into boiling water or stock, the time I had the most success was when they dried fully....even if you just put them in the oven for a few hours on the lowest setting.  And, as with so many recipes, this tastes so much better after it had been refrigerated for some time.  This is my go-to recipe for quick and filling noodles.

These were delicious!  I used my kitchenaid dough hook to knead them and my hand cranked dough roller on setting 5.  Probably a little thinner that I should have gone but they were so good.  I used a pizza cutter to cut them into squares and used them with my beef stroganoff.  All three of my kids devoured them.

Excellent noodle recipe!!!  My family always used only the yolks with a shell of ice cold water per egg and half cup flour with a pinch of salt per egg.  The noodles were rolled as thin as possible and dried over the backs of the kitchen chairs, which also made them stretch thinner.  I like the addition of the butter and milk, as the dough was less sticky, making it much easier to roll.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Perfect egg noodles every time I've made them. A big improvement over my old recipe which just called for water instead of milk and didn't have any butter in it. Much better tasting and better texture too.

I love these noodles. There easy to make and I now love making home made chicken noodle soup. My kids and husband love them too. I slice some thick and some thin and give the thicker noodles to my baby so he can handle them better with his hands (he's only 10 months old).

I didn't use any special tools, just a bowl, my hands to mix and some kitchen shears for cutting strips.

My family has always loved chicken with egg noodles - a favorite!  When we moved to Sicily in 2007, we couldn't find the frozen egg noodles which we used in our recipe anywhere.  For some reason, I believed that it was very difficult to make homemade egg noodles, so we simply gave up on chicken and noodles.  Then I found this recipe!  SO EASY AND DELICIOUS!  I'll never rely on frozen egg noodles again!  I have a very happy family!

I made the dough in my breadmaker on the dough cycle by adding the wet ingredients first then adding the flour and it turned out great!  SOOOO easy to make!

Fabulous.  I used them in chicken and noodles.  Nothing beats home made noodles.

Very easy recipe, excellent noodles.  I used these in the Easy Chicken Noodle Soup from this website, and they were perfect!  I also made a batch with half whole wheat flour, and that was great too!

These were easy and very good! Perfect in my homemade chicken noodle soup. I didn't roll them out quite thin enough so they were thicker noodles than I would have like, but next time I'll know. Thanks for this recipe!

I made these noodles and cut into squares for my chicken pot pie and it was AWESOME!!  They were WORTH the extra time it takes to make them instead of using dried pasta!

These were so good and so easy. I never knew homemade noodles would be this easy or I would have been making them long ago. Won't find me buying from the store again!

They did take longer than I thought they would to dry (maybe mine were fatter than they should be) but I cooked them like that anyway and they were fine. Delish!

Great recipe (especially with the suggestion of substituting some whole wheat flour) and thanks for the cool suggestion of letting the kiddos cut our shapes.

These were great.  I have never made noodles before and this was so easy.  I used my pasta machine and my eight year old grandaughter helped me.  We had a wonderful time making these.  I will be making them often.

These noodles tasted good, but were much more moist than other egg noodle recipes I have tried previously.  Required a lot of extra flour to roll out.  Once dried out and cooked though, they were very tasty.
