This was great. I use Marzetti Slaw dressing all the time, although because it is a tad sweet, I often mix it with a little lite mayo. I used real crumbled bacon instead of bacon bits. Thanks!

This was a very tasty slaw! I didn't want to buy slaw dressing so I used 1/4 c of wasabi mayo instead, which added a nice kick. Even my husband liked it. :) Will definitely make again.

This recipe takes ordinary cole slaw and kicks it up a notch.  The blue cheese and avacado enhance the flavor and everyone is surprised to see tomatoe. This is now the only kind of cole slaw I make.
