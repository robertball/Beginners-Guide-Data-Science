I used this recipe when I was throwing a chili cookoff at my house and I decided to compete in the "Most Interesting Ingredient" category. This was a wonderful recipe, but I did change it: I used a large can of pumpkin, I substituted black beans, I added approx. 1/4 cup chili powder and doubled the cumin and added approx. 1/4 cup sugar. I actually won my own chili competition with this recipe! It's wonderful! (but some of the best recipes are ones that you alter to fit your own style!)

My potluck guests loved this chili.  I used 1 1/2 lbs hamburg instead of 2 lbs, added 2 15 oz cans of black beans and an additional can of kidney beans (drained), an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin puree, omitted the sugar and added 2 tsp cumin and 2 tsp cayenne.  This was fabulous chili!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Teresa.

I won an "Iron Chef" competition with this (the secret ingredient had to be pumpkin - was totally unique!) Did add a few things though -
2 cloves minced garlic
FULL can of the pumpkin puree
"dash" of kosher salt
and a lot more chili powder
....delicious and unique!

This is a great unique chili!  It rather reminded me of a middle eastern dish because of the cinnamon blended with cumin.  (yes, I added a bit of cumin in addition to the chili powder.)  I also used tofu instead of ground beef, which is my usual vegetarian substitution in chili.  A great combination of flavors to give a delicious chili!

I listened to other reviewers and made the following adjustments: used 1 # of ground turkey & 1 # of ground beef; used one red bell pepper instead of green; instead of tomato juice I used 2 (15 oz.) cans of tomato sauce; added 2 cloves minced garlic; added in the whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin; used 2 T. pumpkin pie spice, 1 1/2 T. chili powder, reduced sugar to 1 T. brown sugar; added in 1/2 tsp. cayenne, 1 tsp. curry, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, and 1 tsp. cumin.  With these changes, it was the right consistency (not runny as the tomato juice users complained of), and flavorful. I think it tasted even better the next day.

Very good chili.  Used 1 lb fround beef and 1 lb ground pork.  Also used good quality ancho chili powder.  Thought the smokiness of the ancho chilis would compliment the pumpkin.  Did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I used a mix of cinnanmon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger.  Only used about 1 Tbps of sugar.  Used about 3/4th of can of tomato juice just because I like my chili thick.

Entered a chili cookoff competition at work with this recipe and came in second.  Everyone gave it high marks and mainly wanted to taste it due to the uniqueness of using pumpkin in a chili.  Am planning to enter it in a chili competition at a local festival next year.

This recipe is a perfect blend of chili and pumpkin pie.  The spices comingle nicely on the tongue.  It was a hit with my picky husband and 3 year old.

Loved it!  Fall is my favorite season and this chili fast-forwarded the seasons for me.  My husband thought it was too sweet, but I finished it off.

Quick and easy to make, and VERY tasty!  I don't have any kids, but I think kids would like this chili because it's not a super-spicy chili.

I used this recipe to enter a church chili cookoff and I won for having the most original chili.  It was good, but not the best.  I will probably make this again though.

I made this recipe for a chili contest at my office and I won the 1st place! I did make some changes to it: I added a couple of fresh jalapenos, cumin and cayenne pepper for an extra kick. I used green, yellow, orange and red bell peppers and they gave the chili a wonderful color! I also added salt (lots) and cut back on the sugar.I used black beans instead of kidney and substituted V8 for the tomatoe juice. I also used the whole pumpkin can. Everyone loved it!!! Thank you for posting this recipe! I am the 2008 Chili Champion! Yay!

Hmmm.  I like pumpkin, both in desserts and in dinner foods, but I think what I didn't like about this chili is that it's throwing the dessert right into the dinner... I don't enjoy sweetened meat, so I left out the sugar, but the pumpkin pie spice was still very sweetish (even though I put in less than 1/2 tablespoon for a big vat of chili).  I'd suggest starting the pumpkin pie spice at 1/2 teaspoon, and taste-testing from there to see if you want to add more.  I ended up increasing the chili powder by at least double, and adding a tablespoon of cumin, a tablespoon of beef bouillon, a tablespoon of tomato bouillon, and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (too mild otherwise) to mask the sweetness of the pie spice.  I also increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and added black pepper to taste.  In the end, that combination worked for me--it came out tasty and appealing, even for my boyfriend, who doesn't like chili.  But given that the recipe makes a *lot* and it's not my favorite ever, I don't think I'll make it again (save my spices and puree for pies!)

This has been a big hit at Halloween parties 2 years in a row.  I use 1 pound ground beef, 1 pound sausage (I've used regular and hot), 1 onion, serrano peppers (2), 1 can black beans, 1 can canneliini beans, V8 spicy juice, 1 can Rotel, 1 can fire roasted tomatoes, 1/2 cup pumpkin, 1 TBSP pumpkin pie spice, 1 TBSP ancho chili powder, no sugar. I cook the beef, sausage and onion on the stove and then put it all in the slow cooker on low. Yum - Enjoy - this is a spicy version.

Used ground turkey instead of beef, black beans instead of kidney beans and a full 15 ounce can of pumpkin because I didn't know what to do with the rest of it - tasted great but I will cut back on the sugar some next time - thanks

Amazing sweet chili. I used diced green chilis instead of bell pepper and added some crushed red pepper. I also used real pumpkin (not from a can). Added a little salt when served and it was amazing!! I never go for seconds but I did with this chili.

I thought this turned out very well. I made a number of changes that other reviewers suggested: 1 tsp cumin, a little over 1 tsp cayenne pepper, somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 cup sugar, quite a bit of salt, and way less pumpkin spice, and the whole 15 oz can of pumpkins. It ends up being like a normal, not very spicy chili with just a hint of pumpkin. It was a big hit with my guests.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. I added a little more pumkin than the recipe called for. It made the chili even more creamy and flavorful.

My husband said this was the best chili he has ever had. I used an extra 1/2 tbs of chili powder because we like things spicy. I also used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin. What was I going to do with the rest of it anyway? It made the chili thick and hardy. This recipe is a keeper!

It is super easy to make.  I made this for a Chili cookoff at work and won.  I added a can of black beans,  and a red pepper diced (I hate diced tomatoes, so I had to trick myself into eating them).  I forgot the sugar that the recipe called for but it came out great.  I'm not sure who decided the serving size, but this made a HUGE amount of chili.  I recommend this recipe to anyone!

Loved this recipe!  I doubled the pumpkin (I used homegrown pumpkins), added more sugar and a bit more chili spice.  I also used jalapenos instead of bell peppers.  Yum!  I've already made 3 batches and plan to make more.  I so recommend this fabulous recipe.

This is by far my favorite chili recipe.  It is delicious and nobody knows there's pumpkin in it.  It has a sweet dark rich taste and when it sits over night, it's even better!

I love this recipe!  We prefer a leaner diet, so I altered this by using turkey instead of beef, omitting the sugar and adding a crushed garlic clove, black pepper and frozen sweet corn.  I like my chili spicy, not sweet.  It turned out great!

Delicious,  even the kids liked it.  I left out the green peppers, added a bit more pumpkin and spices.  It won 1st place in a Habitat for Humanity chili cook-off in Lebanon, Oregon.

Delicious, easy to make. I used ground turkey seasoned with a little taco seasoning and the entire can of pumpkin puree. My family and friends loved the chili. I plan to make this often. Thanks for the recipe!

I would give it more stars if I could, trust me! It was absolutly the best chili I have ever had. I've already given this recipe to my sister and a friend from work, who say they will always make this chili over any other kind of chili from now on. I only chopped the onion and bell pepper instead of dicing them as I like chili on the chunkier side. Also, I substituted ground turkey for the hamburger meat. Incredible flavor, slightly sweet, thank you for this recipe!

This chili came out great!  I won "Most Unique Reserve Champion" with this chili during our annual chili cook-off this year.  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I added two cans of black beans, doubled the chili powder, added 2 tbls. each of white ground pepper and cayenne pepper, and doubled the pumpkin pie spice.  This chili hits you with a nice sweet flavor followed by a little heat.  Perfect!  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was okay, but being from Texas I prefer my chili really spicy.  I decided to try this because of my love for pumpkin.  I used all low sodium ingredients and only added 2 tbsp of sugar because I was afraid of it being too sweet.  Not bad but just not my taste.

This is better than the version of Pumpkin Chili from another source that I have been making.  I left out the tomato juice and used 4 14-1/2 oz cans of diced tomatoes; put a full 2 cups (equal to one can) of pureed pumpkin, added LOTS more chili powder, and used minced hot banana peppers instead of bell peppers.  Added black beans too.  What I gleaned from this recipe was using pumpkin pie spice and brown sugar--my other recipe didn't include that, and I really think that was a good flavor, sweetness to balance the hotness.

Turned out a bit bland, could not taste the pumpkin at all, and definitely not enough chili powder.  Still, a good place to start from.

After a few modifications, as recommended by other reviews) I thought this dish was great! I added: 2 cloves garlic, 16 oz pumpkin puree, 2 cans black beans, and double chili powder. I am vegetarian so I nixed the meat all together. While everyone loved the dish, next time I will leave the pumpkin a little on the chunky side for texture (I made it fresh). The puree made the chili taste like the beans were mashed, which I guess is a matter of textural taste. Anyways, I am looking forward to making this again! It was fast and easy to make as well!

This is a winner. I too changed just a couple of things. I used more pumpkin, almost a whole can, and added cayenne pepper for a kick. I didn't have tomato juice on hand but had bloody-mary mix and it worked just great! YUM.

Delish; I make this every year for Halloween using black beans instead of kidney beans and a 15 oz. can of pumpkin puree.  I increase the chili powder to 2 tablespoons, and decrease the white sugar to 1 - 2 tablespoons or to taste.

The chili was awesome! I added some corn, white kidney beans and black beans. Used Tomato Sauce instead of Juice and petite diced tomatoes with green chilies. I did not use hamburger but stew meat instead. After about 4 hours in the crock pot the beef was very tender. The substitution of diced tomatoes with green chilies made it a little hot for my wife. I, however, thought it was just spicy enough.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and a side of corn chips.  I would recommend this recipe wholeheartedly! After 2 bowls I am full, happy and now sleepy.

I am a chili purist, but this was very good.  Use the basic recipe but feel free to add to it as your taste dictates.  I used V8 instead of tomato juice for added flavor.  I also used orange and yellow peppers instead of green for color.  Don't be afraid to add a variety of beans(black,kidney,chili,etc.)  Definitely season to taste.  I used a package of chili mix and pumped it up with cayenne, cumin and chili powder.  Sweet with a little bite. Oh, brown sugar works great too.  I was hesitant at first but will definetly do this again.  Thanks for a fun and yummy recipe!

This chili turned out pretty good!  I followed the advise of other reviewers and used a full 15 oz can of pumpkin and I also used turkey meat instead of beef.  I chopped up a couple of jalepeno peppers and only used about 30 oz of tomatoe juice.  Doubled the amount of pumpkin spice and also added a couple teaspoons of cummin. Don't forget to use SALT!!

This chili is great and customizing makes it better.I used orange bell-peppers bc it visually gave the idea of pumpkin.I added cumin and used brown sugar to give more authentic pumpkin pie taste. The whole recipe is nothing without the pumpkin pie spice-that is the main distinguishing flavor. In fact the pumpkin puree does nothing for flavor only texture. People want to know there really is pumpkin in the chili. I entered this in a competition and won a prize- tasters like the originality, seasonality (in Oct.), and different flavor from others:-)

What a unique, even bizarre chili, but it sure was good.  I wouldn't let my wife near the kitchen while I was preparing it, for fear she would run and hide.  But she loved it as did our notoriously picky twelve year old.  I did add a few diced jalepenos, but beyond that, I stuck to the recipe.

The first thing my husband said after tasting this recipe was "you put something weird in your chili, didn't you?"  He prefers my regular chili recipe - I thought it was okay.  I tried it because I love different pumpkin recipes.  I substituted pinto beans with jalepenos for the kidney beans.  The big surprise was that my picky 5 year old son ate 2 servings.

We have had an annual chili party at our farm for 28 years.  We cook three kinds of chili, 15 gallons of each in cast iron kettles over an open fire.  We serve one kettle of hot spiced, one kettle of mild spiced, and one kettle of a specialty chili.  Each year has been a different specialty recipe with this year being this Pumpkin recipe.  We had over 125 guests and the Pumpkin received the most compliments of any specialty chili we have featured.  It was curiously delicious and very appropriate for the Fall season.  Our rule is to never repeat a recipe but that may have to change!!

I took this to a chili cook off at my office (without trying it first). Used balck beans, added 2 cans of pumpkin and omited the sugar. It was a hit! After everyone took a tiny first bite....I only had an empty cockpot to bring home.

This was fantastic. I added a tsp of cumin and cayenne respectively and the whole can of pumpkin puree (therefore omitting the need for the sugar). There was no overtly pumpkin taste but the chili was much more filling. I will definitely make this again.

For cooks who may not have "pumpkin spice", an acknowledged substitute is to mix 1/4 cup cinnamon with 1 Tbsp each of ground ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves. I used clamato in lieu of tomato juice and it tasted just fine. Sprinkle some cheese and a parsley sprig across the top for garnish. Delicious!

Delish! I had pumpkin pie filling that I wanted to get rid of and used this along with 3T or so extra cumin (omitting the sweeter spices called for in the recipe). The substitution made me nervous but it still turned out great!

Great chili; left it in the crock pot and went down the the Circleville Pumpkin Show.  It was nice to come home to.  I used 1 can of kidney beans and also cooked some black beans.  I didn't measure the pumpkin but I'd guess I added more like 1 cup.

Delicious! I followed the directions exactly and I was worried that it was going to be too sweet. Luckily my fears were quickly proved wrong with the first bite.  The pumpkin flavor is subtle and just enough to make this the perfect fall dish.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is great stuff!  I'm making it right now for a Halloween-themed potluck contest and it's so good I'm not waiting for the results to post my review.  Who would have thought a chili with such an unusual ingredient would come out so good.  I was leery of the pumpkin pie spice too but it really blends in well.  Of course I did a few things differently.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (DH doesn't eat beef), doubled the amount of pumpkin and chili powder, and added garlic, cumin and a little cayenne pepper.  In my opinion, there's no way sugar could possibly improve this dish (to the contrary!) so I eliminated it entirely.  I'll make it exactly the same way next time cuz there definitely will be a next time.  UPDATE:  I've now made this several more times and it comes out great every time.  It even inspired me to come up with my own dish, a coconut-pumpkin curry with shrimp....delicious!!

This is the best! I love it. The only thing I did differently was use a red bell pepper instead of a green one, but that is because I don't like green peppers! This is very good, my family enjoyed it!

Awesome recipe!  I added carrots and black beans (instead of kidney) and it gave it has a very festive appearance.  I made four servings and changed/reduced the white sugar from 2 TBSP to 2 tspn of brown sugar.  I WILL be using this one again.

Too sweet.  I think next time I will try it without the sugar because I liked the other flavors- then maybe it would be a five star.

Love this recipe. I was hesitant at first, but brought it to a family party. Everyone loved it, expecially my super picky brother. It is so unique! I kept everything exactly the same as written.

This was a good hearty chili, but the Pumpkin Spice flavor was a bit too much for me. I reduced this spice by half and it  still overpowered the rest of the ingredients. However, I really enjoyed the addition of the pumpkin puree'. I also added a beef bullion cube to round out the flavor of the chili. If you are looking to try something different, then this is for you.

This is a really good recipe, but it should say season to taste because it is pretty bland.  I like to add salt and pepper, and more pumpkin pie spice.

I took this to work and everyone LOVED it (as did I).  We all kept going back for more.  A definite keeper in my book!  Matter a fact, I’m going to make it again for a party next weekend.  

Here are the changed I made.  I didn’t have regular Chili Powder so I used Chipotle Chili Powder.

1 lb ground beef & 1.25 lbs ground turkey
19 oz can Black beans & 27oz can Kidney beans
32 oz V8 juice 
Full 15 oz  can pumpkin puree
1 Tbsp White Sugar & 1 Tbsp (heaping) Brown Sugar
1 ½ Tbsp Cumin 
2 cloves Garlic minced
Salt & Pepper 

I also seasoned my meats while browning with a little extra of all spices so that all fla

This chili was awesome of course I changed it more to be healthier and to include what I had on hand. I used dried beans. black and red kidney. I added the 3 Tablespoons of Cumin, and only used 1 Tbls of sugar. Added about 3 Tbls of sirachi chili sauce and biggest change was I used fresh butternut squash instead of canned pumpkin. I just cut it in half, microwaved it cut side down until soft and the mashed and added to the chili. The consistancy was wonderful. Also served with Jasmin rice and RF sharp cheddar. Awesome will def make again.

Wow.  Pumpkin adds an intriguing and mysterious flavor to chili!  This is what my chili has been missing for so long.  With pumpkin, you don't need lots of spice, nor lots of seasoning, to make it taste good.  Normally I add a lot of cheese and corn chips to my chili--not this time.  You can't tell that you're eating pumpkin.  All you know is that this is the best chili you have ever tasted.
Disclaimer: our chili did not precisely follow this recipe.  But pumpkin belongs in chili, as much as beans and tomatoes do.

I love this recipe.  I've made it a few times now...sometimes as written, sometimes with additions.  I always tend to add at least a 1/2 tsp of cayenne and use spicey v-8 juice, as I like a kick.  Last night I added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter to it and it gives it such a rich taste.  Probably not an addition for everyone, but I'm loving it.

Good but missing some heat. I like sweet in savory dishes but even this was a little too sweet for me. If I try again, I will leave out the sugar and add some chili powder. As for the pumpkin, you really couldn't taste it but it added a lovely creamy texture. Makes me want to try pumpkin puree in other stews/soups!

We really enjoyed this, but I did make a few changes... One can of tomato sauce instead of 46oz of tom juice, a full 15oz can of pumpkin, a rounded tablespoon of cumin, reduced the sugar, a full tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, and put a nice pinch of salt in.  It had a nice, thick consistency this way and wasn't quite as sweet as it could have been.  Next time we make it, I am thinking about roasting some jalopenos and adding those in - the chili could definitely use some heat  :)

I made this for a party at work and it was a huge hit!!! I made a few substitutions as other people have done as well: I only used 1 pound of ground beef, and added 2 cans of black beans I used 2 Tbsp chili powder and added 1 tea cumin and 1 tea garlic salt Only used 2 Tbsp of sugar I like my chili a little on the thicker side so I used 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce and 2 cans full of water. Will be making this again!!!

I was very excited to try this seasonal chili. My husband liked it, but i was not ecstatic about it. I feel like there could have been more ingredients to give the chili a less soupy feel and the recipe could have called for more pumpkin! I'll make again, but i'll add more beans, some cut pumpkin and more vegetables!

This is my new favorite chili. I did modify it by increasing the amount of chili powder to 2 tbsps, I added 2 tsps of cumin, substituted brown sugar for white sugar, and used the easy pumpkin puree which already had the pumpkin pie spices added to it. I also took the advice of another poster and added 2 cloves of garlic. It is a little bit on the sweet side, but it's an unique twist that brings something special to table. Thanks for such a great recipe. Well done!

This is the definition of fall, it smells so delicious, and tastes great too. It is very mild, but flavorful. I didn't add any sugar and don't know that I would. If you are looking for your "typical" chili, don't try this, but if you want something different and fun, this is it!

Don't use all of the tomato juice.  The pumpkin taste is not very strong, so don't be afraid.  The chili is pretty sweet, so use less sugar if you don't like sweet chili.  Pretty good overall.

I enjoyed trying this chili recipe, but it required lots of doctoring on the spices to overcome the blandness of all of that tomato.  My falt, a recipe calling for 48 oz tomato juice and an additional 28 of whole, I should have known better.  On the upside, it does make a ton of chili, and it is certainly mild enough for the kiddies.  Next time I might consider subing a pound of the ground beef for some spicy italian sausage, and definitely cutting back on the juice for a little thicker chili.  Like others I did double the chili powder, added cayenne pepper, tripled the pumpkin, and added cumin & a pinch of clove.  I added more pumpkin pie spice, too, but the pumpkin flavor was lost.  My hubby loved this.  Thanks for your submission.

This is delicious. I entered this in a chili contest and won! I added a bit of orange juice (1/4 cup?), a bit more pumpkin, and almost doubled the seasonings. I added 1 t. of cumin, and a sprinkle of ginger too. I love this recipe.

This was an amazing way to use the leftover pumpkin from my pumpkin pancakes.  I added some cumin and nutmeg and a little more pumpkin than the recipe called for.  I didn't have kidney beans or green peppers or pumpkin pie spice, so I used black beans, a red pepper and a combo of cinnamon, ginger, and allspice.  My boyfriend has requested that I make it again soon.

I'm afraid I have to weigh in on the side of "too sweet."  The recipe was certainly very easy and it makes a TON!  Our palate for chili runs to the spiced not the sweet, so I had to add 2 more tablespoons of chili powder, some cayenne and cumin... about a teaspoon each.  The pumpkin is a fine idea for a thickener but I would leave out the pie spice, as recommended by other reviewers, and cut back on the sugar.

I thought this sounded interesting, so I tried it.  It was easy and tasty.  The flavors blended well.  It freezes well, too.

Mmmmmm! So good! Sweet and spicy. I used brown sugar instead of white, a whole cup of pumpkin and added a strong dash of cumin. This warm and inviting- perfect for a Fall or Winter comfort food.

The pumpkin and spices added an interesting twist to this chili.  For the pumpkin pie spice I used a scant 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. each of ginger and nutmeg, and scant 1/4 tsp. cloves.  I increased the chili powder to 2 T and decreased the sugar to 2 T. I also added a little red pepper.  I served this with pumpkin cornbread (from this site) using up the rest of the can of pumpkin.  I've decided to change my original rating from a 4 to 5, because this chili just keeps tasting better and better and quite addicting the longer it sits.  I gave it a 4 before mainly due to the fact that I had to add more chili powder and red pepper, but with those added it is definitely a 5 and with those pumpkin cornbread muffins, has become my favorite fall meal.

It was fantastic. We were sorry we ate it all. It had the most amazing spicy flavor. Rich in sides of a good dish. Will make it most of the time when i make chili. I use my home frozen pumpkin from the garden, wonderful.  Pat thanks for posting it.

This may be my all-time favourite chilli recipe! The flavour is so rich and complex, don’t be shy about the pumpkin and pumpkin spice. I make this in  a crockpot (so easy to put together!). I cook the meat, peppers and onion the night before and drain well. I add a 398 ml can of pumpkin, and increase  the spices: chili powder 3-4 Tbsp, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 Tbsp pumpkin spice, 2 tsp cumin, and salt and pepper. I used a 700 ml can tomato sauce &~1 cup water instead of juice (texture was perfect, we like it thick), and 2 cans black beans, so we can call it pumpkin stew with beetles.  I cooked the meat, onion and peppers the night before and drained the fat. In the morning it took 5 min to put it all in the crockpot and stir it up, before cooking on high for 4 hours- check as you can turn it down near the end, once flavours have melded together.  Will make again every fall. Got rave reviews at various staff potlucks!

Tried this recipe and used ground turkey instead of beef.  Got rave reviews from my husband and a thumbs up from an accomplished cook-friend.  This has been added to our permanent chili rotation.

So, not a fan :0(  It was alright.  I made it for a trunk or treat chili cook off and hardly anyone ate it.  It was crazy sweet, like it did not go together.  Interesting though.

I made this for my family because I looove pumpkin and I really liked the idea of this recipe. I tweaked it a little bit, I added garlic, carrots, and celery because I'm a fan of veggies. I also cut out the sugar and added 3 times the amount of pumpkin called for. All in all, it turned out really nice! I was very pleased with the consistency and the taste of everything, it was nice and thick and hearty with all the veggies in there. The seasonings were just right. My only complaint is that even with 3 times the amount of pumpkin called for, I still couldn't really taste it much... It tasted great and it tasted like chili, and it had a nice sweet smell, but the taste of pumpkin didn't necessarily come through especially well. Still a great recipe, I'll be using it again!

I made this almost as written.  I wanted the option of adjusting the spice level, so I reduced the amount of spices and sugar by about 25%.  I did not add more later as it seemed to be plenty.  I served the chili at a holiday party and nearly all of it was eaten.  The flavor is very mild, which worked well for the kids.  The adults added Siracha to their bowls for heat.

This turned out amazing! I added a can of green chilies, used 2 green bell peppers, lots of garlic, and lots more chili powder. You can't really taste the pumpkin but it's still soooo good! Better the next day too.

It was a little too sweet at first but after we got used to the taste, it was yummy.  It takes awhile to get used to the sweet pumpkin in this chili but it was easy and we all ate it up!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a Big hit at a chili cook-off I just participated in, we had people from all over the place asking if this was the pumpkin chili booth they'd been hearing about. I added a little cayanne and cummin just to give it some heat and chili flavor but it's good either way.

Tried this 'cause it just sounds like Fall.  It's easy and tastes OK.  We were glad to try it, but probably will not do it again...he likes my regular chili better.  I did learn from the recipe to use tomato juice instead of tomato paste and water...much easier.  Thanks.

I thought this sounded funky but wanted to try it.  Glad I did.  The pumpkin flavor wasn't very strong.  I didn't add sugar b/c I assumed it really wouldn't need it.  Second batch I made I added red pepper flakes which took over the that pumpkin flavor.  First try, I used half a green pepper and it overpowered the chili.

This was so good... prefect for a fall evening.  I did make a couple changes based on other reviews.  I used a whole can of pumpkin, 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of tomato juice and 1 pack of taco season (just because I realized I was out of chili powder 3/4 of the way thorugh putting it all together).  I also cut back on the sugar just a bit. Will certainly be making this often this winter.

This was an interesting dish.  I understand that this is supposed to be a different kind of chili.  However, it is too sweet.  I'll definitely make this again.  I think next time I'll add a little more heat and cut back on the sugar.  My son loved it.  He ate two bowls and leftovers for lunch.

Verbatim except for omitting the sugar, this was just your average very mild chili; the pumpkin puree and pumpkin spice were almost undetectable. Too much tweaking is necessary to yield a chili worthy of having the word pumpkin in the name (so I suggest looking for another recipe if you seek a chili with ever moderate pumpkin flavor); however, this is a decent recipe (omitting the pumpkin pie spice and again, the sugar) if you are looking for a way to sneak in vitamins... although if this were the case you probably would also instead look for another recipe not quite so heavy on the ground meat and heavier on the vegetables and beans. But as for this recipe, you should, at the very least, double the amount of pumpkin puree, pumpkin spice, and chili powder.

This recipe is very unique. It was good but a little too sweet I thought. I would go easy on the sugar and add some cayenne pepper for heat. Also, not alot of tomato juice for chunky chili. Good flavor still, just a few changes.

This dish was fantastic!  I used meatless crumbles rather than the ground beef.  I also cut the sugar by half and added some cumin.  Everyone loved it - no leftovers!!  I will make a bigger batch next time!

Is was edible but it's just not my taste (or my family's) It actualy reminded everyone of sloppy joes. I won't be making this again.

I thought this recipe was a bit bland and needed something added, but certainly not sugar or salt.  I agree with others that it probably needs more pumpkin.  I'll stick to my recipe which is ALWAYS great.

A subtle, pleasant alternative to the chili I grew up with; this is the first chili I've made on my own (sad--I've been on my own for years!) and I will definitely make it again.  I used a whole 29 oz can of pumpkin and doubled the chili powder.  Next time I think I will use more beef and fewer beans.

This Chili was exceptional!!!  My husband and son both loved it and asked for 2nds and 3rd. The only thing I added was grated cheddar on top and served it over bow tie pasta.  This is a definite keeper and great for Sunday Football Dinners!!!

Absolutely the best chili!  About half way through dinner I told our kids there was pumpkin in it and they did a slight recoil in their seats, but then kept right on eating.  The house smelled like Skyline Chili while it was simmering for an hour.  It doesn't taste like Skyline (and it isn't supposed to), but we do love that smell.  I made the following changes and can't wait to make this again this fall and winter:

no bell pepper - doesn't suit some of our stomachs;
substitute 1 of the cans of kidney beans with a can of black beans;
substitute V8 for the tomato juice;
use more pumpkin - I had a partial can to use, maybe a cup, wouldn't hesitate to use a full can next time;
use less pumpkin pie spice (1/2 t.);
use less sugar (1/8 cup);
add 1 t. cumin.

Recipe looks great, but I haven't yet prepared it.  Although I appreciate the ideas from reviewers who make changes, I would appreciate it more if they would: 1) prepare the recipe as written first, 2) then prepare the recipe using their own creativity, 3) and lastly review it after testing both versions.  I really hate having to sift through all the 5 star reviews of people rating their own recipes highly.  I'd like to see the ratings of the original recipe first.  3 stars only because I haven't prepared the recipe yet.

As-is, the recipe was very bland, so I followed the recommendations of other reviewers (added the rest of the can of pumpkin, added 2tsp cayenne and 2tsp cumin) and it was pretty tasty.

I made a HUGE pot of this for a football party- let it simmer on low all afternoon so people could eat as they pleased. Everyone raved- it was delicious! The only thing I did differently was to use more chili powder, add cumin, and also a good amount of cayenne for heat. I'll be making again!

I REALLY wanted to love this recipe and could not wait to make it but I have to say that although I'm eating it and not hating it, I wouldn't make it again. The only thing I did differently than the recipe calls for is add the entire can of pumpkin instead of only the half cup because other reviewers did this and gave positive reviews. I will have to find another way to get my pumpkin fill this fall.

I have only made the recipe twice, but it's always been a hit. I like a heartier chili, so I have a tendency to lessen the amount of tomato juice (by about a cup) and up the pumpkin puree (to a whole cup - or one whole can). Serve over white rice and VOILA - delicious sweet chili. I'm still tweaking the ingredients a bit to thicken / make more flavorful. I'll post more options once I've experimented with them.

Great festive twist on classic party food.  A little unusual, but everyone went back for 2nds.   We served in a hollowed out pumpkin for extra Halloween flair.

This recipe is great and easy. I changed things by eliminating the onion, adding an entire can of pumpkin, 1/8 cup sugar, 1/2 tablespoon chili powder, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of kidney beans and added 1/4 tablespoon cayenne. Perfect for a cold night.

I was surprised by how much I liked this!  I made the recipe almost exactly as written, but I made it vegetarian by leaving out the beef and putting 1 cup extra beans in the blender with 1 cup of the tomato juice and then adding it to the chili.  This gives it a slightly meaty texture.  I think I'll use less tomato next time, though.  It's a bit too much with the diced tomatoes AND the juice.

This is pretty good! I still prefer a more traditional chili, but I would make this again! I had to change a few things...I cut the recipe in half and I used a whole red bell pepper to keep with the color scheme ;) I didn't have any tomato juice so I used one 15 ounce can of tomato sauce. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I subbed cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. I used 2 cups of real pumpkin puree instead of canned. and omitted the sugar and used 2 tablespoons of sugar free Hungry Jack syrup instead. Turned out very good! I'm on a diet and can't have sugar and the syrup added a nice flavor to the pumpkin. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of salt.

Absolutely wonderful! I did change a few things based on others reviews. I used 15 oz of tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice, one can of Rotel tomatoes to add some extra heat and only 2 tsp of sugar. I also used ground turkey instead of the hamburger and 2 cans of black beans. Everyone loved it! Will *definitely* make again. Thanks!

How amazing! I've been having the notion to add pumpkin to chili lately. I started a pot full, then did a search and found this recipe. I'd already added the half the listed ingredients, and so proceeded with confidence. It is delicious!

Wonderful flavor! Try it with a dollop of sour cream, heavenly!  It turned out a little "soupy" for me, next time, I'll cut down on the amount of tomato juice.

It was very good.  I used 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef.  It got rave reviews at our chili cook off.

Great Chili.  I suggest adding the pumpie pie spice a little at a time to taste.  The full tablespoon was just a bit too much for my taste although the chili was still great.  I used 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans because that is what I had on hand.  Freezes very well.  Definately a keeper, will make again.

Loved it. I also used a whole can of pumpkin, and a about  one and half tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice. My husband has always hated chili and he gobbled it right up.  Will be making again.

I make this with a tofu crumble and it is delicious and far healthier than the meat option - best thing is my family doesn't know the difference since the texture is the same and the chili is flavorful enough to hide and hint of the tofu! =)

So I halved the recipe, used a whole red bell pepper from food chopper, kept pumpkin at half cup, an because this house is soo ridiculously sly of new things, replaced the pumpkin pie spice with paprika/black pepper/etc. With not even sitting an hour everyone started eating it, so the flavors never got to meld >.

This was a tasty very mild chili. I didn't end up added the extra sugar as I tasted it after adding the pumpkin pie spice and the chili and thought that it was sweet enough. I also ended up increasing the chili powder alittle bit and threw some cumin in just to amp up the chili flavor. I served it on Halloween and all in all everyone there thought it was pretty good-although no one was really able to taste the pumpkin in it.

LOVED the recipe as well as the group of Halloween guests we had over. As recipe calls for - was very liquidy and quite bland. Couldn't taste the pumpkin at all. Added 1 extra can of kidney beans, the rest of a 29 oz can of pumpkin, 2 extra Tbsp of chili powder, 2 extra Tbsp of pumpkin pie spice, and 1 Tbsp cumin. Then it was awesome!! Will definitely make this again, but without all of the tomato juice to start with and definitely more chili powder, pumpkin pie spice and some cumin. :)

Awesome!  I made this for a Halloween Party we had and people loved it. My modifications: NO tomato juice.  I have tomato juice in chili.  Instead I used 2 quarts of canned tomatoes.  I also used 1/8 cup of sugar (any more would have killed people with sweetness).  I used about 2.5 tablespoons of chili powder, and the 3/4 can of pumpkin puree.  GOod stuff.  My husband liked it and he doesn't normally like chili.  Will make instead of my 'normal chili from now on.  THANK YOU!!!

This was great just a bit sweet and not spicy. I fixed just as directed. However, I next time I will make some changes. I will leave out the sugar and add more chili powder. It was just not spicy enough for me. Even my husband who does not like spicy thought it was too sweet. It was a hardy meal and will for sure cook it again.

I definitely wouldn't ue all of the juice, it makes it way too watery for chili.  I would use half of what the recipe calls for.  I also put half of the sugar in the chili and it was still too sweet.  I used the whole can of pumpkin and liked the texture.  i added curry, salt, and pepper to this recipe and it was an interesting addition.  It did win our chili cook off, though.  Just not my taste.

I LOVE pumpkin recipes so I had to try this out. I used ground turkey instead of beef, but other than that, did not change a thing. I agree with others - the spices are pretty bland, which would make it a good kid's chili. I am not a huge fan of spicy food, but I still found myself adding a LOT more chili powder and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes after the first taste. I was disappointed that the pumpkin flavor was mostly lost unless I really looked for it - and the can of tomato juice was HUGE... I think I am used to my chili being a bit thicker. This is by no means a bad recipe - but I would probably choose one of my other favorite chili recipes before I chose this one again! I might try adding pumpkin to my favorite chili recipe on this site: "Laura's Quick Slow Cooker Chili."

Delicious!  I can't follow a recipe to save my life so my  end result is quite different from this recipe, but I feel it deserves a five-star rating because of the inspiration it provides.  The pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and (brown) sugar, combined with red pepper flakes, cumin, and green chilis give this a wonderful sweet-and-spicy flavor that's pleasing to the palate.  Thanks for the idea!

SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  I'm SO glad that I made this.  I followed the suggestions of others, and did the following:

Added 2 cans of black beans instead of kidney beans.

Added a little more pumpkin than what was called for -- maybe (1) 15oz can and a half?

Added about 5 sliced carrots.

Added more spices overall, to taste, including more pumpkin pie spice, some cumin, some cayenne pepper, some more cinnamon, more chili powder, more ginger...  Even then, the chili wasn't horribly spicy.

I also didn't add the whole can of tomato juice - maybe just 3/4 of it.  I wanted a nice, thick chili.

The pumpkin makes this chili rock out!!  And it's nearly impossible to screw up the recipe.  Just dump stuff in a pot and let it simmer.  Duh.

What a nice twist on traditional chili. I followed the recipe to the letter, however I did throw in one chopped jalapeno. I gave some to my boyfriend's mom (a chiliholic) and she loved it (can't go wrong earning extra brownie points ;) ). I found that it tastes even better the next day, too. Thanks BMWRIGHT69.

I would make this again for sure, but maybe add a little more kick with some added spice.  I cut the sugar in half, and added a teaspoon of cumin.  Husband loved it...couldn't put his finger on the secret ingredient.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this a 4-star rating b/c of the ingenuity! Who woulda thought to add pumpkin puree to chili! What a wonderful idea! We had to leave the beans out, as we have family allergies to those & the green pepper, so we added twice the amount of meat called for. We omitted the pie spice & sugar b/c we tend to like things like this more savory than sweet.  We seasoned our meat w/salt & pepper as we were browning it. We went easy on the chili powder b/c we have a 14 month old, added a little cayenne & cinnamon per other reviewers' suggestions. I myself would suggest to leave cinnamon out if you like savory things more - it does add this 'sweet taste' to the chili which we didn't love, but  handled; I think it's b/c we're used to cinnamon being in sweet baked goods - not that it really makes it 'sweet.' I guess chili's just the kind of dish you have to tweak to your liking. But really a great idea - a good way to sneak in lots of Vitamin A into your family's diet.  Thanks for the recipe!

My new favorite recipie!  I love how the pumkin pie spice blends with the beef.  I replaced the beans with mushrooms, and tripled the pumpkin (made the chili nice and thick), but used exact amounts for everything else.

I'm not a big fan of chili but after trying this recipe, I'll never look at chili the same way again.  I loved it! Even my husband thought is was great and his taste for chili runs on the spicier side.  I ended up adding the whole 28 ounce can of unsweetened pumpkin puree and then only added 1/8 cup of sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe, somewhat sweet. I added more pumpkin than the recipe called for (probably doubled it). Figured if I was making pumpkin chili, might as well taste as much as pumpkin as possible! Yummy!!!

I think it is an interesting chili. It's been simmering on the stove now for a bit and I can see why some reviewers think it tastes better the next day. I substituted one red kidney bean for black bean and used two pounds of ground deer meat- also used fresh pumpkin that I have cooked. The pumpkin pie spice I made myself by combining cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and ground clove. At this point of tasting, the flavors haven't totally incorporated. I was going to leave out the sugar, but sprinkled in just a little bit to enhance the flavors. I will make this again.

This is a unique tasting chili but very delicious.  I took other reviewers advice and added the whole can of pumpkin. I also added more chili powder and only 1tbls of sugar. I also used an orange pepper instead of green. I would definitely make this again.

I've made this a bunch of times and each time is awesome. I typically use 2 peppers instead of 1 (one has to be orange!), a can of black beans and a can of kidney beans, no sugar, throw in some cumin and sometimes some cayenne, defintely the Spicy V8, and sometimes a jalapeno. Oh, and the whole can of pumpkin for sure. It never comes out overly spicy either. Delicious!

I appreciated using this recipe as a base for my own. 
Changes I made:
I cubed fresh pumpkin instead of the puree
All spice instead of pumpkin pie seasoning
Turkey instead of ground beef
Herbs, thyme and rosemary
Salt instead of sugar
Onion and garlic powders
Also added black beans and corn

Thanks for helping me make this dish awesome.  I've wanted to make this for years, and it was my first time using fresh pumpkin which is awesome.

Ok I didn’t exactly follow the recipe to a T but that’s because my hubby hates pumpkin so just mixed a tablespoon of pumpkin purée to a bowl of the chili that he already had made.  He makes super spicy chili and this helped cool it down a bit.  I really love pumpkin and it was so delicious.  Tomorrow I’m adding some pumpkin spice to it as well and I don’t think that  it will need sugar as the pumpkin purée already adds sweetness and flavor!

I make this recipe every year all through Fall. I omit the tomato juice and sugar, use fresh tomatoes and use the juice from those. And to add color I use a bright bell pepper. I also double all the pumpkin, I didn't feel like I was able to taste the pumpkin. It's a hit every year.

2 stars may be a little harsh, it was definitely edible and wasn't the worst thing on earth, but it was a little disappointing. I usually like the cloves/cinnamon combination in savory foods, but it didn't seem to work here. It's hard to define the problem with this recipe, because it was flavorful just not the best flavor combination, maybe using real pumpkin rather than canned affected it? It was just eh. Might be worth trying to make it without the chili powder?

Have made this twice (both times with ground turkey) and always gets rave reviews. I bump up the chili type spices (cumin, ancho, etc.) and bring down the sugar level just a little and add some apple cider vinegar for balance. It’s great at leftovers too and would be good with rice. I placed third in a chili competition with this non-traditional chili.

Following what others said, I did less sugar and added some cumin. I also didn't have tomato juice so instead I used a small can of tomato paste and a can of chicken broth.

Delicious.  I used black beans and omitted the tomato juice.  Used a 28 + 15oz can of tomatoes and some beef stock to make up the liquid needed. 48 oz would have been way to much liquid.   Used 1 cup of pumpkin.  Replaced chili powder with cayenne pepper.  Changes were made to what I had on hand.

Yum! I made this vegetarian by using soy crumbles instead of ground beef. I used a large onion & pepper. I sauteed the onion & pepper then added the spices and cooked for 2 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. I used 3T chili powder, 2T sugar, 1/2t pumpkin pie spice, 1/2t cumin, and 1/2t cayenne. My meat-loving friends raved about it and could not believe the chili was vegetarian!

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this chili! I made some tiny tweaks, but I will probably try this again with the real recipe just because it was so good that I now trust the person who posted this with my life. My changes were:

 I didn't add the sugar. I was worried it might shift the emphasis from being chili first, to being a dessert hybrid

I added cloves. Actually, I just didn't have pie spice, so I just used a shake of cinnamon and then ground up some cloves which really came through in the finished product, giving it a rich, fall flavor which we loved.

Will definitely  be making this again, and haven't stopped bragging about it since the night I made it. It's great!

I used homemade puréed squash rather than canned pumpkin and never measure spices but otherwise I followed the directions exactly and loved the results of this recipe. A perfect meal on a chilly fall night.

This was delicious!  We made it on Halloween which was just right for the season.  I added chopped garlic to the onion, omitted meat and white sugar, and subbed in a tablespoon of brown sugar, used 3 cans of beans (black, kidney and pinto), some frozen corn, 1/2 bottle of V8 and a can of tomatoes, a sprinkle of chili powder, cumin and cinnamon.  This is an unusual and versatile recipe. Thanks!

I use this recipe every year for our apartment complex's Pumpkin Party. I have made a few changes though. I use a red, yellow, and orange bell pepper (no green). It looks really festive and pretty in the finished product. Even though I up the amount of meat, beans, pumpkin, and peppers (for a larger group), I only use a little tomato juice, no more that 14 oz. Forty eight ounces seems a little excessive to me, even when cooking for a large group. I also leave the sugar and tomatoes the same as the original recipe. This is always a hit at our event.

This was delicious! It wasn't sweet as one person stated. I did every thing the recipe stated except, I did one can of red kidney beans, one can of white kidney beans and a can of light red kidney beans. It had a great flavor and very mild! We loved it!!! It was also hinted with pumpkin, it was not overwhelming and my husband couldn't even tell it was in there. So I understand why some folks did the whole can! A must try!

Loved the idea of pumpkin in chili, but I changed this quite a bit:  I used stew meat cut up into tiny pieces, yellow bell pepper for color instead of green, black beans instead of pinto, and a full can of pumpkin.  I also added additional chili powder, cumin, a bit of cayenne, garlic powder, and a couple tablespoons of a BBQ rub I make.  It was voted a favorite at a Super Bowl party.

Great recipe! Won People's Choice at a Chili Cookoff at work. The taste was wonderful. I did add about 2 cloves of minced garlic because well I love garlic. Going to make again this year but going to try making it with half beef and half spicy sausage to give it a little more kick! Great recipe. Bring on the fall!

This is a great chili. Even my husband and kids like it. I used about 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin that I had frozen from the fall. I added cumin and some extra dashes of chili powder and instead of canned beans I used a bag of dry beans that I soaked overnight and then simmered before adding them to the chili. Excellent!

This recipe was "okay." Not the best chili I've had. I was disappointed that I really couldn't taste any pumpkin. And I had to add a lot more chili powder than what it called for. One tablespoon wasn't nearly enough.

I love this recipe!  It's a hit every single time I make it.  I add chunks of real pumpkin to make it more hearty and a jalepeno or whatever chile I have to spice it up a bit!

I've made this every year for the past 4 years at the start of Fall and I love it.  I usually sub the white sugar for brown sugar, add 2 pumpkin beers, and only use half of the tomato sauce.  If you make it as-is, it will be VERY runny.

Loved this recipe! It's a great way to change up traditional chili.  I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. venison steak cubed.

this was good but needed a little tweaking. i didn't even use half the tomato juice and it was still very liquidy. the taste was good though. i like a mild chili so this was perfect for me but my family likes it a little spicier, so they added red pepper flakes to their bowls. i also substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and doubled the pumpkin.

It was tastey and unique. Loved the flavor, but I feel like it was missing something. Also, it was VERY meaty. It is worth making again though. Next time I will double the pumpkin, half the meat, add about 3 cloves of minced garlic, and add some smokey flavor. Also, I think red onions would be nice.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was posted. I had to doctor it so much.The chili still came out just OK. I will not be making this again. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the time to make it.

I did like the flavor of the spice, but didn't find that there was a good balance between the acid and sweetness.  Although it was good and ok, after each bite I kept saying...."it's just missing something.."

On to find another pumpkin chili.

I really loved this chili. I've tried a few different chili recipes on this site, and this is one might be my favorite. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin, so next time, I think I'll add a bit more. I didn't have any tomato juice, so I used tomato sauce instead. I think this resulted in a thicker chili, which was fine with me, but I think it would have been good with the juice too. I also added a little salt, and used a combination of kidney, black, and pinto beans. It was great!

So I made quite a few changes, here's what I did:
Ingredients:
2 lbs 80% lean 20% fat Ground Beef
1 15 oz can Bush's Dark Kidney Beans
1 15 oz can Bush's Medium Chili Beans
1 Green Bell Pepper
2 Jalapeno Peppers
1 yellow onion
2 cloves minced Garlic
10 oz Pumpkin Puree (pureed the pumpkin myself)
46 oz Tomato Juice
28 oz diced tomatoes
2 1/2 tbsp. Chili Powder
1 tbsp. Ground Cumin
1/2 tsp. Cayenne Pepper
2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tbsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice
1 tbsp. Sugar. 
With these changes, the chili turned out really good, even better the next day. I thought a 1/4 c of sugar would have been too sweet, and there wasn't enough spices in the orginal recipe. I'd say if you want a medium - low heat in a chili this is the way to go. Thanks for the recipe, got rid of my leftover pumpkin puree. And good luck cooks of allrecipe.com :-D

Made this tonight and really liked it! I ended up adding more veggies (I had some to use up). I realized as we were eating dinner that I totally forgot the sugar. Oops! It was still very tasty--loved the way the pumpkin pie spice complimented the chili powder (and cumin--I love cumin so I added @1tsp). I didn't have tomato juice so I put crushed tomatoes in the food processor & added water. I didn't end up using all of it-no more room in the pot and I like a thicker consistency. But I am so glad I tried this--I will be making it again!

I decreased the ground beef to 1 lb. since I prefer a veggie/bean based chili. I used 1 lg. onion, 4 green chili peppers, 15.5 oz. drained and rinsed black beans, 15 oz. organic tri-beans drained and rinsed, 23 oz. spicy V8 juice, 14.5 oz. diced tomatoes with juice, 10 oz. original Rotel with juice, 1/2 c. heaping pumpkin puree, 1 T. pumpkin pie spice, 1 T. chili powder and 2 T. sugar. My intent was not to alter to the recipe only use what in my cupboards since I'm moving. Initially, I omitted the sugar but it was definitely missing something so I added 2T. and it hit the mark. If you want a soupier chili, keep the lid on while simmering otherwise remove the lid. I will store in the fridge overnight and then separate into Ziploc bags to freeze for later. I will definitely serve over rice or noodles. Delicious!

I make this recipe every year! It's one of our fall staples.  We recently became vegetarian, so I now sub the ground beef for some Beyond Beef grounds or similar. I also add a little extra pumpkin puree, use spicy V8 instead of tomato juice, add in some dried red pepper, sub in red bell pepper for the green, sub in sweet potatoes for the 2nd can of beans and sometimes add in jalapeno.

Like the concept of this recipe. My husband and toddler enjoyed it. Followed the recommendations of other reviewers and added additional pumpkin and spices.  We like things flavorful. I didn't have pumpkin spice, so I followed recommendations for spice substitute (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves).  The final results had a strange after taste, so it my be that I was heavy handed with one of the seasons (like cloves).

I made this last year, and it is the ONLY chili my husband has EVER actually "liked" I'm making it again this year but I'm adding more seasoning. This is the best chili for cool fall or cold winter weather! I use one can of diced tomatoes, one can of "fire roasted" tomatoes, 2 cans of chili beans rinsed and drained, and I cook it in my crockpot on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. I love this recipe because when I have a sore throat, chili hurts! But since this chili is mild, it is soothing!

This was the most amazing chili I have ever made. I did put the whole can (small can) of pumpkin in. And added a little hot pepper and instead of white sugar, brown sugar. I will be making this for our state's chili cook off. This is excellent!

Best chili recipe! For more kick and flavor I added 2 tablespoons of pumpkin spice and the whole can of pumpkin puree.  I actually bought organic pumpkin pie filler which already has spice in it as well!

This was very good - especially after about a day of letting it sit and allowing the flavors to mingle. I used Splenda in place of the sugar. I also didn't have any canned tomato juice on hand so I substituted 4 cups of freshly juiced tomatoes (done with my juicer) and 2 cups veg. broth. Because I was not using commerical tomatoe juice,  I had to add quite a bit more salt - 1 to 2 TBs. This is not a spicy dish; if you like spicy, I would recommend adding cayenne pepper to the recipe. All in all, very good.

I made this chili for our day after Thanksgiving family get-together, and it was a hit!  I used 1 lb. turkey and 1 lb. ground beef, and my husband and his father raved about it.  In fact, this dish may become a family tradition for the day after Thanksgiving! Thanks!

I loved this recipe, but I made a few changes because I used what I had in the kitchen...I browned 1 1/4 lbs of ground turkey meat with some frozen diced green peppers and onions, i used 1 can of Bush's mild chili magic and 1 can of Bush's mild chili beans, 1 cup of mild salsa, 1tbsp of cinnamon, 2 pieces chopped celery, 2 spoonfuls minced garlic, a sprinkle of thyme leaves and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper, and the 1/2 can of pumpkin.  I omitted the remaining ingredients the recipe calls for, because the bush's chili beans already have the spices and tomato paste.  This recipe is not spicy at all (just the way my family likes it!) and it is very easy! I don't have a stove so i had to use an electric skillet and a crockpot.

I just love this recipe. I've only made it twice, last year and again today.  It's a great option for those who dislike spicy chili. I did what another reviewer said and added more chili powder, cumin, more pumpkin, and a little salt.
You can really do whatever you want to this chili and it's going to turn out great.  I only gave it 4 out of 5 because there's something missing and I can't figure out what it is. lol

We just made this dish again on 11/23/09 and again I thought something was missing.  I signed on here and read my review and found it funny. Still a great dish, but we felt it was a little on the sweet side this time.  I may reduce the sugar by half next time.

Yum Yum! I made the recipe as is but wasn't thrilled with the flavor so I added an extra can of beans, the rest of the can of pumpkin and a lot more chili powder and salt. Then it tasted super yummy! So, no big changes, just more of what was already in it. Thanks for sharing. I never would have thought about pumpkin in chili. It's an awesome way to get a big boost of nutrients into my husband.

Unique flavor, I did not have tomato juice, replaced with tomato sauce. I only added 2 Tablespoons of sugar, it was enough sweetness for me.

A nice change of pace, but a little bland for this tex-mex family!

This was ok, the kids didn't appreciate it much though.  Seemed too sweet, and I left out the sugar!  Would try again, maybe with more pumpkin and more seasoning.

I was trying to use up cans of pumpkin after Thanksgiving. This was really good, but next time I would omit the pumpkin pie spice.

I thought it was edible, but bland- even after adding chipotle chilis to it.

I tried this at our town's Chili Cook off, and loved it!  Not being a pumpkin fan, I was hesitant at first.  I made it for our monthly Euchre group, and everyone raved about it as well.  This is definitly a sweet, not spicy chili.  I tweaked the recipe to accomidate what I had in my pantry, and it still turned out fantastic!  This is a keeper!
