delicious!  we have made them for the last couple holiday seasons.  they are a favorite of my whole family.  we use vanilla, instead of almond extract.  and we roll them in powdered sugar after they have cooled.

Yes! These are absolutely NUT BUTTER BALLS!  I followed the directions exactly.  Made 9 dozen (that's 108 cookies, recipe actually made more so don't be afraid to make them a little bigger) for a Cookie Exchange Party for the Holidays.  They are just like I remembered as a child.  I used the vanilla extract and used less walnuts (finely ground) as a reviewer suggested.  RICH with butter ~ DELICIOUS not too sweet ~ THE BEST combination of butter, powdered sugar and walnuts!

I made these with pecans run through my food processor, and they came out DELICIOUSLY. I did roll them once while still warm but also rolled them a second time after they had cooled. This is such a necessary step that I'm amazed it didn't appear in the original recipe; otherwise, your cookies have a bunch of "bled-through" places where the oils work through the confectioner's sugar -- most notably where your fingers touched it when rolling while warm and then placing on whatever you used for a cooling rack. Having made a double batch, I stored them in a plastic one-gallon ice cream tub with a sheet of waxed paper between each layer of cookies. Before setting any cookies on each sheet of waxed paper, I sprinkled more confectioner's sugar on the paper. I also sprinkled the tops of each layer of cookies before placing the next sheet of waxed paper. This seems to be helping them stay fresh, as well as keeping the cookies looking just as good as they taste.  I will definitely make this again; I could eat an entire batch all by myself!

I made these once with almonds and almond extract, and once with hazelnuts (filberts) and vanilla extract. They were both good, but didn't quite have the melt in my mouth texture I wanted.

This is the same recipe as the one I know as "almond balls."  My recipe uses only a 1/2 tsp of almond extract and just 1 cup of finely-chopped almonds; otherwise it is identical.  These are easy to make and each one is a tasty, powdery mouthful of subtle almond flavor.  This is one of the desserts featured at our group's Norwegian julebords in Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara.

Extremely easy and tasty...a few adjustments...I used only 1 cup of nuts w/ an extra 1/2 c flour, and it was still a little too nutty (you REALLY have to like nuts) and make sure you ground the nuts really fine.  Will make again w/ less nuts and I'm sure I'll love them even more!!

After reading all of the reviews I decided to have a go at doing some things a little differently than the original recipe. 
     First, I remember these cookies having that delicious almond aroma, it just pulls you in by the nose tempting you to take a bite. So, instead of using what the recipe calls for I substituted
1/2 tsp almond extract and a tsp of vanilla.

Next, on the first batch, instead of rolling them into balls, I used a small butter scoop and put them on the cookie sheet with that. The second batch, I rolled into balls. After baking, they are both the same shape, flat on the bottom and domed on top. So why go to all of the trouble to roll them? I don't care if they are balls, they are still beautiful.

      Last, I only used one cup of pecans. 

      These delicate little cookies dissolve in your mouth in a bite of tender, buttery, pecan flavored goodness. Served with a nice latte... they are a little bite of heaven. My husband says "It doesn't get any better than this!" 

Thank you for sharing the recipe and to all of you who offered suggestions.  Hmmm... I wonder how these would taste if I put ______ in them *WEG*

I took these to work for our Christmas celebration.  They all loved them! Several asked for the recipe to give to their spouses.  I will decrease the nuts to one cup next time but that is all. This recipe is definately a keeper.

They were great! Really easy. We ended up using only 1/2 inch balls/cresents, because the 1 inch crescents became way to big.

Very good.  A tad floury in taste but I'm pretty sure that was my fault for not measuring exactly right.  I will definately be making again.  I think I'll experiment with a little extra sugar as well.

Fantastic cookies! I used vanilla extract instead of almond as recommended because that is what I had on hand. These will be a regular cookie recipe, that's for sure!

This is a very good recipe, but I changed it up.  I didn't have any walnuts in the house, so I used the 2tsp of vanilla instead of the almond extract and 1C mini-chocolate chips instead of the walnuts.  YUMMY!

These turned out just like I wanted them to. I made the dough and threw it in the fridge while I made another cookie recipe. By the time I was done it was firm enough to roll up and pop in the oven. I'll definitely make these again!

These cookies are VERY rich, but oh so good.  I had these at a Christmas market in the town we are living in, in Germany, and my husband loved them so much I thought I would make them for him.  I used pecans, as that is what the ones we had at the market used, and they turned out yum.  These cookies are also fairly forgiving.  I put them in the fridge Christmas Eve, and then forgot about them until Christmas day.  I made them today (the day after Christmas), and although the dough was a bit crumbly (they were in the fridge uncovered for about 12 hours, until I remembered them lol), they still formed nice balls.  They also kept their shape of a ball a bit more, so if someone is looking for that to happen, perhaps let them chill a bit more?  These are so soft when they come out of the oven- you really cannot mess with them for about 10 min or so after they come out, or they just fall right apart.  I will make these again :)

Butter balls have been a family tradition since I can remember.  Every Christmas we make about 2-3 batches and give them away as gifts to our friends and co-workers.  Every year people ask "are you going to make those powdery balls again."  LOL.  Its an EASY recipe that everyone will enjoy making together and eating together!!!

The nut wasn't a ball shape by the time I pulled it out of the oven. It had melted down somewhere in between ball and cookie shape. The first one fell apart when I tried to take it off the cookie sheet (maybe it was too hot?). I also used 1/8 tsp of salt, vanilla extract, and used pecans that I put in my nutibullet which came out super fine. I used unsalted real butter. Overall, good taste. I just wish they would hold their form.

My recipe, which is over 50 years old, uses only 1 1/2 cups of flour and NO sugar in the dough. All the sweetness comes from the powdered sugar you roll them in, and they are very tender and melt-in-your mouth. I am going to make them with finely ground black walnuts, and think they will taste amazing. I usually use english walnuts or pecans.

Really freaking good! Used hazelnuts roasted by pan, and had only vanilla aroma so i used 2 tsp instead, and the rest i did exactly as written. I tried to roll the balls in powdered sugar right after they came out of the oven, its actually better to wait a little bit till warm, not burning hot.  =)

These were really good. These remind me of cornstarch/melting moments cookies. They are light and crispy and melt in your mouth.

OMG, hands down the BEST cookie I have ever made.  I did what others suggested, added 1 tsp vanilla in addition to the almond andup the confectioners sugar to 1 cup, AMAZING, melt in your mouth and soooo easy!  Thank you

I have enjoyed this recipe for years but decided to try something different.  I rolled the dough around a dark-chocolate Hershey's kiss.  WOW - so good (especially if you eat it warm while the chocolate is still melt-y)!  I rolled in powdered sugar, too.

These came out great.  I gave 4 stars because the dough was a bit crumbly and I had to spend extra time forming the dough balls.  However, they came out fantastic and I will make them again.  I made them with pecans.

These cookies are fantastic. We've made these every year with a different recipe for our holiday cookie day and this recipe turned out great. Even better than the old recipe I had. I am so glad I tried this. Everyone loved them!
