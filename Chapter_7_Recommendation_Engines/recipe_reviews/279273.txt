Surprisingly tasty! This just goes to show you that simple ingredients often make the best-tasting recipes. I used a center cut filet that was about 1 1/4" thick. The only change I'd recommend is only baking for 15 minutes tops.  This will ensure a perfectly-moist piece of salmon. If your filet is even thinner, start checking at 12 minutes.

Super simple and clean up was a breeze. Made as directed and we thought it was great. I will definitely make again.
