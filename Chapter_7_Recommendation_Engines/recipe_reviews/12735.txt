This was very tasty...I used frozen cooked shrimp and a lot less oil and it was still delicious.

I added 1 tsp of curry, a cup of white wine and my left over rice pilaf..it was very tasty.  If you like the base, shrimp & onions...work with it..make it your own.

It was yummy... i used curry instead of turmeric. I added 1 cup of brown rice to the recipe and obviously more water, stirred it often so it wouldn't get stuck. If you add the rice make sure you add enough water. It wont ruin the recipe. I also made some falafel balls to complement it :). Great for a rainy day. I tried it another day adding carrots and potatoes. yum!

We lightened up a little on the onions. We were happy the way this turned out and it was a good way to use up some left over shrimp we had in the freezer.

This was a success!  My husband, who doesn't particularly like shrimp, asked me to make it again (!) this time with curry powder instead of turmeric.  I browned the onions instead of just softening them, which I think gave the whole dish a slightly mellower flavor.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy.  I did make a few tweeks.  I used three different onions; shallot, yellow onion, and white onion.  I browned this instead of just softening. I also diced up a green bell pepper and threw that in with the garlic.  I used a little more tumeric than called for and it was spot on!  I think I would go a little lighter on the black pepper though.  It was a tiny bit spicer than I would have liked. I served this over brown rice and with a spinach & goat cheese salad.  Delish!

I love onions and my husband loves shrimp but neither one of us much enjoyed this recipe.  I ate one shrimp and that was more than enough for me. The following day I rinsed off the left over shrimp and put them on a salad. Other reviews seemed to like this recipe but I'm sorry to say it is just not for us.
