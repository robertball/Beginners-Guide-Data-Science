This one was ok.  We have lost our grandmother's raisin bread recipe, and I wanted something a lot like it - a white dough that you let rise before baking.  This was the closest I could find.  It did pretty well; getting all the softened yeast off the bottom of the bowl, to dump it into the dough mixture, is tricky.  It might be better to dump the rest onto the yeast, since missing some yeast can be a big problem.  If you can plan the time, this is a nice and simple treat...but, it's not my favorite.

I made this recipe for a fondue party and received a lot of compliments.  It held up well for dipping.  The only changes I made was to use approximately 5 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour (instead of 6 cups of all-purpose flour) and I only used about 1 1/2 cups of golden raisins (instead of 2 cups of regular raisins).

i added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts, and soaked the fruit first. i came back into the kitchen after 30 minutes because i could smell burning! when i took the bread out of the oven it was burnt on the outside and still uncooked on the inside. it smelled very good though. next time i will reduce the temperature when cooking. looked good too though!

for some reason my bread didn't rise.  I'm wondering if my yeast was effective..   The cooking temp. is too high and the time to cook is too long.  I wish I would have read reviews before baking.

I am happy that I did read the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and the dough rose well and was easy to work with. I read another review about time and temp and adjusted the temp to 350 and the time to 40 minutes. (we recently downsized and I am still hating my "electric" oven/stove). I checked at 30 minutes and it was DONE DONE DONE! Thank goodness I took it out! The crust was quite brown but I brushed some butter on it immediately to soften it. It IS very tasty!  If I make this again I will be certain to lower the temp and decrease the time and check often. AND, it does smell wonderful.

I don't know whether it was my oven or the recipe but mine came out a little burnt and I had to turn my oven off at 40 minutes. The remaining 10 minutes cooking time were all residual heat. So I should probably take it out at around 35-40 minutes mark next time.  

The rest of the recipe went smoothly. It was fairly easy to follow.
