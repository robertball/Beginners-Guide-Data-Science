OK I have been on the search for the best pancake or cake cake as my kids call them. This is it, I was so surprised at the taste and moistness. I was very leery of making it as I have tried several from this site to no avail. We don't keep cream of wheat in the house normally as my kids wont eat it, so I made a special trip to the grocery just for it and OMG was it so worth it. I have never even thought about writing a review until now I want to get on the top of the highest point and shout it to everyone "OMG you have to try these" I followed it exactly as written, but doubled it(wanted way more then 5) well it made 8 cake cakes and I still have a whole bowl full in the fridge, this is the first time I have ever save the batter usually just toss it but I am thinking that it would be a mortal sin to toss this batter...lol... I did top it with my own syrup that I will be posting on this site Strawberry banana yummyyyyy...thank you so very much for sharing this with the world....

This is a very good recipe for vegetarians. Cream of Wheat is high in iron which is hard to get if you are vegetarian. The pancakes were very good, I doubled the recipe and got 14 pancakes. I did as follows:  2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 2/3 cup cream of wheat 2 tbsps sugar 1 tsp baking soda 4 tsps baking powder 1 1/2 cups milk 3/4 cup blueberry yogurt 1/4 oil 2 eggs 2 tsps vanilla 2 cups frozen blueberries  This made the batter thicker and it was sweet enough for us.

These were wonderful! I doubled the recipe, used soy milk, whole wheat flour and half the sugar. I made half the batch as is and then added a cut up banana, some raspberries and a handful of chocolate chips. They turned out so well. I will be using this recipe again.

Very, very good. Only change I made was using nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Both my kids and I really loved these. I did let the batter sit for a bit and rest before cooking. As with any pancake recipe, DON'T OVERMIX. I served this with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup also from this site. A+!

DELICIOUS!!! I've been looking for a recipe for theses ever since IHOP stopped serving them. I made them with the "Absolute Best Pancake Syrup" from this site, and they were absolutely wonderful.

Love, Love, Love these griddlecakes!!  I was looking for a way to use up a big box of Malt-O-Meal (DS wanted it and then decided he didn't like it) and came across this recipe.  I have made this recipe several times.  I usually double it each time I make it.  I've made with the sour cream and have also substituted plain yogurt and vanilla yogurt that I needed to use up.  Cook on the electric griddle at 350Â°.  These pancakes are wonderful and they freeze great for a quick breakfast.  My family just microwaves for 30 seconds, flips them over and 15 seconds more. We've even toasted them in the toaster with great results.  Thanks CSYJNAMOM for sharing this recipe.  I've shared it a few times with friends.

I have never had Cream of Wheat but had a couple of sample pkts to use & no one brave enough to try them:) Found this recipe & am soooo glad I did! These are fantastic!! Thick, but not too much so, GREAT flavor(used cinnamon roll flavored Cream of Wheat so added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon). I'll be buying Cream of Wheat regularly now just to make these-they're THAT good! Thank you so much!

I used regular Cream of Wheat since it is all I had on hand. It didn't seem to matter since they came out very good. I do agree with another reviewer, the batter is runnier than your usual pancake batter.

These were so good!  I substituted whole wheat flour, decreased the white sugar to about 1/8 cup of brown sugar, I didn't have sour cream so instead I soured the 1 1/4 cup milk with lemon juice, and mashed up a ripe banana and substituted that for the 1/2 cup sour cream.  They rose increadibly well and turned out light and fluffy.  I'll definitely be making these again, thank you for the great recipe! :)

These were definitely fantastic! I only made a few changes. I used regular cream of wheat because that's what I had on hand, I used brown sugar instead of white, and I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream - just because I didn't have any sour cream. But I was happy that the lighter alternative still tasted really good! At first I had trouble with them cooking too fast and burning, but after a few attempts I got the hang of it. All in all, definitely some of the best pancakes I ever had.

These were pretty good pancakes. A nice little change from ordinary pancakes. They definitely taste a little different from the regular (sweeter) and are worth making again. My husband and baby liked them too.

Best pancakes I've ever made! So creamy and slightly sweet....I cut the sugar by half because it seemed a little sweet...but overall it was amazing...they are thick and just delicious with butter and maple syrup!

This recipe is excellent! I made a few changes: I used a splash more milk to make them a little thinner...we prefer thinner pancakes :) I warmed the milk for about 1 minute, then mixed in the cream of wheat. I had that sit while I prepared the rest of the ingredients, then added it to the batter mixture. I used only 4 tbsp of sugar and a little less than 1/2 cup of oil. Next time I would like to try using 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce for a healthier version. We LOVED these pancakes and will make these again for sure. I also made a blueberry sauce for syrup..delicious!

Wow...I don't even like pancakes but get forced to make them a few times a year for my pancake loving family.  I have tried several others from this site and they all tasted like soggy bread.  This recipe was wonderful.  I made it exactly as written (by the way if you are using cream of wheat individual serving packets 1/3 cup is 1 1/2 envelops).  Don't hesitate to try these...you won't be disappointed!

We loved these pancakes!  You could taste the cream of wheat but it was not weird.  I would it give it more stars but 400 calories for 2 pancakes seems like a lot to me.  I will make these again but I will cut down on the sugar and use yogurt instead of sour cream.

These are the best pancakes I have ever had or made. I use regular cream of wheat instead of instant. Since I enjoy the texture and flavor, I increased the cream of wheat to 1/2 C. I have used nonfat yogurt and nonfat sour cream and have noticed that the pancakes come out a bit dry. 
I also bake bacon until crispy, crumble it and mix with the dry ingredients.  It is very important not to over mix. Mix only 12-15 times. Leave small lumps of flour. (they will cook out). Top with warm maple syrup. MMMM good!

Love these.  Make them all the time.  We love the addition of the cream of wheat.  It adds a subtle texture to the pancake.  I always double the recipe, but leave the oil the same.  They are great as leftovers as well.

Loved these. Was a little skeptical at first but, I had a box of cream of wheat that my kids did not like so I was looking for a recipe to use it up.  The only substitution I made was I used wheat flour.  These were great, kids loved them.

This recipe is fabulous as is!  I made exactly as instructed and they turned out perfect.  We served with butter and syrup.  They have some sweetness to them, so you really don't even need syrup.  I may try omitting the sugar next time or subbing some truvia instead.  Thanks so much!

These are some of the best pancakes ever!  My only issue was I had to let the batter sit for a few seconds because my first scoop was to runny.

These were great!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (our Cream of Wheat was the 2-1/2 minute variety, and I used light sour cream), and we all thought they were super.

I have a pancake recipe that I've used for years, but it calls for vanilla yogurt and I didn't have any on hand.  I found this recipe and was a little concerned because I did not have the instant cream of wheat...I had the 2 1/2 minute kind.  WOW....both myself and all of my family visiting for the holidays were extremely impressed!  I had to triple the servings, and it's a good thing I did because everyone at more than they normally would.  My in-laws have a friend that has a pancake recipe that I have been trying to get for years, but she won't give it up.....says it's a family recipe.  My father-in-law said that these were better than hers!  This is my recipe of choice here on out.....enjoy!

These are very good pancakes.  A little heavier than I prefer.  My second best pancake recipe from this site.

These are great griddlecakes! I did make a few changes to the recipe to make these a bit healthier calorie-wise.  I cut the amount of oil to 1/8 cup, used nonfat plain yogurt rather than sour cream, and used splenda rather than white sugar.  The cream of wheat gives a great texture to the griddlecakes.  I've even frozen a few for breakfast during the week! Thanks for the recipe :)

These are the best pancakes hands down!  No joke!  My kids would like to eat these every day and my parents and brother have been coming over and asking me to make them too! The only thing I did different was add more milk.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will never use another!

Incredibly easy to make, completely delicious, and totally versatile.  I'll swap out the sou cream for greek yogurt, change up the spices to my mood, and add any assortment or fruits/nuts/seeds.  Wonderful recipe!

I love these and so does my family.  Even my daughter who would never touch Cream of Wheat on its own.  Once I even made them without sour cream and they turned out good too!  Nice change from a regular pancake!

I've tried several different pancake recipes and I think these are my favorite. They're rich & delicious but still light, and the cream of wheat adds a great flavor & crisp texture.  Other than adding blueberries I followed the recipe exactly.

These were awesome. I used the regular cream of wheat. The first pancake was a little gritty but the ones after were gradually better from just sitting in the wet mixture and then gettting cooked. I used lowfat vanilla yogurt and it still tasted really good. :-) I will continue to use this and tell my mother about it as well... yummy! Thank You!

I thought these tasted great and I loved the Cream of Wheat (though some of the kids thought it was too much cereal).  The batter was a bit runnier than my usual recipe, but not too difficult to work with.  I will make them again!

...Update 6/22/09 : instead of using 1/4 cup vegetable oil, I now use 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. A great compliment to the recipe. Also if using whole wheat flour instead of a-p, add 1/4 cup milk to original recipe. ...Original 4/14/09 : Definitely a keeper! I've made the recipe every couple of days - we've had them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner since finding it in March '09. One change: since I don't keep instant Cream of Wheat on hand, I used my 'favorite' - 2-1/2 minute Cream of Wheat. Great taste.

These were so good, my whole family loved them! I was looking for pancakes with some "texture", and these were perfect. I was out of sour cream, so I used buttermilk instead, and it worked great. These will definitely go in our regular rotation.

I've been making this recipe for about a year, and they are best pancakes I've ever made or eaten for that matter. They freeze very well, I typically double the batch and freeze half. I just grab them out of the freezer and heat in the mic for 30 seconds and I'm a super mom on weekday mornings.

This was lovely.  We have pancakes a lot in our house and these are definitely above the bar!  I made some health conscious changes - Whole wheat flour instead of white, apple sauce instead of oil, evaporated milk instead of sour cream.  They still came out fluffy and delicious.

These are really good pancakes!  I used a couple of those instant Cream of Wheat packets (Original flavor).  Next time I'll try the Cinnabon packets or the Maple Sugar packets, also included in the Instant Crm. of Wheat variety pkg. This recipe is worth the trouble of making homemade pancakes, a good way to sneak extra vitamins into your kids, & way better than those box mixes.

I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted plain greek yogurt and it worked out great!  These pancakes are SO GOOD!  I've been making country griddle cakes for years, trying a lot of different recipes out since IHOP stopped serving their country griddlecakes where I live, but this is the first recipe that I've seen that has sour cream, and this is definitely as close to the real thing as I've gotten, maybe even better, these pancakes are really that good!

This was delicious!! The kids and I loved it! I am a vegan so I made these changes:
egg - applesauce
milk - vanilla soy milk
sour cream - imitation sour cream

Kids didn't even notice all the soy products and absolutely loved them!!

These are the best pancakes I've ever made! They really do taste just like ones you'd get in a breakfast restaurant (like IHOP). They are light and fluffy, although you can kinda feel the cream of wheat... but you won't mind!!! I don't write many reviews, but these pancakes are so good I had to!

I have been trying to eat healthy options which are never appreciated by my 18 and 10 year old.  I made these today with white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and light vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  I did not mess with the sugar, oil or egg.    These were very good.   I new I would like them but was surprised that my children liked them....they do not like anything that is the "healthier" version of what they are used to.    I will make again!

Excellent pancakes!  I didn't have enough sour cream and substituted strawberry yogurt for it.  The yogurt gave the pancakes a mild strawberry flavor.  I'd consider using blueberry yogurt next time or the sour cream the recipe calls for.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Perfect Griddlecakes!  Reminds me of those I had growing up.  My husband said he liked them more than regular pancakes...my kids ate them down.  I used "regular" cream of wheat...still turned out great!

I used the 2.5 minute Chocolate Cream of Wheat. Delicious! Made a double batch which made a lot of food. But we love pancakes and this may be the new favorite!

These are good, but not worth the trouble. Not very distinguishable from standard pancakes.

Light, fluffy and delicious pancakes.  Used whole wheat flour of course, added a half cup of blueberries and used brown sugar instead of white.  Seemed very nutritious.

This is a keeper! The pancakes are very moist and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I didn't have instant Cream of Wheat on hand so I used the regular kind that needs to cook longer. I really don't think it makes much of a difference which type you use.

Amazing! My kids loved them. I made them with cinnamon apple cream of wheat and replaced some of the flour with whole wheat (omitted vanilla and lowered sugar slightly). Can't wait to make a double batch next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

The only thing I did differently was add a little extra flour because it seemed a little to watery. Thought I also used maple and brown sugar cream of wheat. My husband really enjoyed these and I wouldn't hesitate to make them again in the future.

they were pretty light and fluffy, but you could taste the texture of the cream of wheat.  I did add a bit of pumpkin pie spice, I wanted to flavor them a bit, but couldnt decide which one to use.  I would make them again and play with recipe some.

Very good recipe! I didnât have vanilla extract so I used 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  The almond extract makes these pancakes taste amazing!

Made this for brunch today for the clan, there are 7 of us so I tripled the recipe which made a little too much but they turned out wonderful! we love cream of wheat and these are basically like pancakes with a hint of it. Everyone enjoyed this from my hubby down to my picky toddler. Very unique and interesting, and I will definitely make these again. Thank you very much from all my little ones, for sharing this recipe!

This is my first time using cream of wheat as a recipe ingredient and I was floored by how delicious these were. I did make some changes to these to increase nutritional value and reduce the sugar.  I replaced half a cup of the white flour with a combination of almond flour, shredded coconut, ground flax, chia seeds and wheat germ. I only added about 3 tablespoons of raw sugar, but added a mashed ripe banana and I used sweetened vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream. I reduced the oil by about half as well. I also added about a 1/3 cup of finely chopped walnuts.  I topped them with some slice bananas and mandarin oranges warmed in honey. I have to say these were probably the most delicious pancakes I've ever made. The cream of white really adds an interesting twist and I can't wait to experiment with other dishes.

Awesome pancakes! Just like the ones from IHOP they no longer make . Next time I may adjust with less oil & applesauce instead to make it healthier.

Made these pancakes this morning & they were great!  I love cream of wheat so I thought they would be good.  Better than expected. Depending on how many pancakes you're making, you don't need a lot of cream of wheat. Delicious recipe & will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again.

I was addicted to the IHOP country griddle cakes and was devastated they haven't had them.  This recipe has been just what I needed to have those fantastic pancakes in my life again!  I don't make pancakes often because my 12 year old doesn't care for them so it seemed like a waste of time to keep making them.  After she tried this recipe, it is now our go to for breakfast about once a month.

Thank You so much for this recipe, it's perfect as is!

These were pretty good.  I used two packets of Cinnabon flavor Cream of Wheat.  The pancake batter is pretty thick, but makes for nice, hefty pancakes.  I used Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Made about 8 pancakes for us, and hubs decided to put bacon on several of them, which actually was pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This combines my two favs - Cream of Wheat and pancakes! I have made them by omitting the oil and they were still tender and moist.  Very very good! I add a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter and it's delish! I have made these 2 weekends in a row.

Five stars!! I was surprised at how good these tasted. The cream of wheat adds a nice texture and taste.
--As an additional comment, my family does not like pancakes very much. These received praise nonetheless.

I made a LOT of substitutions (goat milk + lemon juice + tapioca starch for the sour cream, mashed banana for the egg, sub'ed brown sugar for the white and reduced the by half, sub'ed half the flour for whole wheat... oh, and used malt-o-meal instead of cream of wheat 'cause that's all I had!) and these still came out GREAT.  My kids loved them and asked that I make them again.  Woot!

Best pancakes ever, the texture was perfect not soft and gummy. I used all W.W. flour and powdered milk. I cook everything on high heat and ruined the first few. Must use med heat. Then they are perfect. Very filling. Thanks

Great recipe! if someone messed up it definitely was not the fault of the recipe but of the preparer. These are the BEST way for me to get extra protein into my two year old granddaughter who is not a big meat eater , she loves her pancakes in the mornings  so I usually make a triple batch and send them home with her mommy for the freezer. And my fussy hubby loves them .

I have made this recipe a few times and love it. So far I have always doubled or even tripled the recipe, and have yet to have even one pancake left over!
I did not use instant Cream of Wheat so I was concerned it would be crunchy but it wasn't. 
Ran out of sour cream one time so I used yogurt, worked great. I've also tried using some whole wheat flour with great success.

Very good as written! Looks too thin but I gave it a chance and they turned out yummy! Made more like 16 medium sized pancakes.
