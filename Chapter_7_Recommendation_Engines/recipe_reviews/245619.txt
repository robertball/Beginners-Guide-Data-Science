Delicious!  A real treat. I served it for brunch with a fruit salad. Used frozen spinach, old white Cheddar and crusty French loaf (day old).  Added 6 green onions and assembled the night before. It's a keeper!

This was the bomb at my very large family's Easter breakfast! The only addition was I carmelized an onion and mixed it into the spinach layer. Folks asked for seconds & the recipe! Annnd no leftovers! Going to have to make 1 1/2  next time! Yum!

I used 2 cups half and half and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  Be sure the bread soaks up just about all the liquid.  It was the first time I made a strata, and it was a big hit.  Delicious!

Made meat -free. Added 3 eggs to the 12. Added carmelized one large yellow onion instead of meat, spread over spinach. Used combo of 2 cups half and half and 1/2 cup heavy cream. Was definitely creamy enough. Added a little more salt because no bacon. It was a HUGE hit. Will make again, for sure!

Great recipe. I chose to make this breakfast strata...because I have weanie kids who won't eat so many things. I only did spinach on one half but put extra bacon on the other.  Other than that followed the recipe. Turned out amazing..
Even for picky boys.

Have also tried it since using mushrooms, onions and peppers diced and saut√©ed  for a few minutes in olive oil. Added it on top of fresh chopped baby spinach. We used some peper jack this time with the cheddar cheeae...and broiling for 1 to 2 min at the end was worth it.

This was excellent. I made half a recipe and only subbed in sausage for the bacon. I really liked the spinach layer as a nice change up from the typical breakfast casserole recipes.  And the cheese amount was just right; not too much and not too little. I put mine in a 9 by 7 inch casserole dish and it was a little "tall" but it didn't really affect cooking time. I baked it covered and then broiled it for 4 minutes.  Delish!

This is fantastic. Only change was added more cheese because we like it cheesy and used 15 eggs and splash more cream. Omitted the cayenne as hubby doesn't love it spicy even if I do. My family and friends all asked for the recipe. Thanks Chef John. Love your videos..they really help!

My family absolutely loves this. I double the egg mixture because we like a lot of custard and add chives and dehydrated onion flakes to the egg mixture. Thank you for this recipe. You can get creative with this. Sometimes if I have broccoli instead of spinach I will use that.

Huge hit for Christmas morning! Super easy and very delicious. I used sausage instead of bacon, half milk, half heavy cream and a dense sourdough bread since I made it the night before.

I cut the recipe in half since I had not made it before.  I used half and half rather than heavy cream and had to use frozen spinach because I was out of fresh (squeeze out all of the water).  Also did not add bacon because I'm a veggie so I added some green onions.  The recipe doesn't say to cook covered or not.  I cooked it with the lid on. Glad I did because i think it would have dried out otherwise.   It was pretty good way to use leftover bread and eggs from our chickens.  -Thanks
* I thought I'ld add if you reheat this the next day in the toaster oven  it's even better -

This was a hit in our family! Thanks for another great recipe! I used all milk and I actually halved it and made it in a smaller casserole dish. I subbed bacon with sausage since that's what I had on hand. I also sauteed some onions and peppers and mixed it in with the bread/egg mixture. So GOOD! This is definitely a keeper!

From the first fork full everyone was impressed by its deliciousness!  It is rich and savory without feeling heavy. I made it as presented but added two small boxes of frozen spinach, drained. We all love spinach. Even my 10 y/o grandson liked it. everyone else LOVED it! Not difficult to make either. Let mine sit in the fridge overnight. Definitely try it!

3/4 of a 2 day old baguette was calling to me to make this dish, which was only half the needed breading amount.  The other half was Arnold's sandwich bread, which is soft and dense.  So, my breading was a combo of tough & soft.  It worked out great.  The spinach I had was fresh and that's how I layered it in the dish.  Came out fine without precooking. Used 20 ounces of extra sharp cheese, divided into 3 sprinklings.  Used 2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. table cream.   I assembled the dish and baked it about 2 hours later.  Once done, I let the strata set for about 10-15 minutes before serving and it set up nicely.  I also watched the video which was helpful.    Looking forward to trying this again with different meat/veggie combos.  Thanks for sharing.

I wish I could give it 4.5 stars - this was very tasty although it ended up runny in the middle after 45 minutes. I will for sure bake longer next time for a firmer texture.  

I did 1.5c milk and 1c heavy cream, and also added about 8oz mushrooms that I sauteed thoroughly in advance.

One of my all time favorite recipes!  I have substituted 2 cans of evaporated milk for the cream and have also used 16 oz. of sour cream - both worked out perfectly.   When we rent a condo for vacation, this is the recipe that I make to use up leftovers the day before we check out.  We can then microwave any remaining for a quick breakfast the next morning  before we get on the road!!  Thank you, Chef John!

Delicious  and easy, what could be better than that .  Followed the recipe without changes just to see how it tasted and I would t change a thing. I used fresh spinach that I wilted in a steamer.  Even my picky eater grandson ate it. Definitely will make again.

This was really good! My kids were turned off by the spinach, but they did eat and enjoy bites without it! Could easily substitute a different meat if needed.

Absolutely amazing.  My entire family love this breakfast dish.  The only ingredient I didn't add was the nutmeg and i cut the amount of salt in half.  I will be making this again.

This is a very good strada, though it takes a while to put it all together, so do as I did and make it the night before and let it sit in refrigerator.  I used 1/2 the bacon and put artichoke hearts (drained) on the other side, opposite the bacon side, for my vegan wife.  Both sides were great!  Th finished dish was quite cheesey, which was OK for our family. and baking for 40 minutes in oven firmed up the bread nicely, and cheese was melted perfectly.  A great, great dish!

Easiness rating is a 5. This looks really hearty and nice when served, but it is actually super easy to make. I left the bacon out to make it a vegetarian dish. I was worried that it would need a crunchy, salty, fatty substitute, but it really didn‚Äôt. The hint of cayenne and salty strong flavor of cheddar was enough to make this taste good, even without bacon. I reduced this recipe. I used 3 eggs in a 5"x8" glass dish. I made it for one person, but it was big enough for two to three people as a main dish.

Made this for hubby to take to a men's meeting.  They loved it.   I used sausage instead of bacon because its what I had. Added some hot sauce.  The wild card was that I didn't have bread, but had a lot of naan. Was concerned it would make it too dense. But it seemed to work. Smelled wonderful.

An absolute keeper of a recipe. Assembled it the night before Thanksgiving so I wouldn't have to worry about breakfast and I got more requests for this recipe than anything in the actual dinner! Made with a day old french country loaf, thick cut bacon, frozen spinach, and sharp tillamook. I'm gonna add mushrooms and possibly some green onions next time. Seems like a great way to use up whatever you have around vegetable, cheese, or meat-wise.

Came out delicious. Left overnight to soak and was worried the ahh would not rise enough , but it did. Added Schroeder mozzarella cheese to the top as well as a sprinkling of herbs de Provence. Will try with sausage as well.

I made this with leftover ham (instead of bacon).  I've been making strata for years, but happy to have Chef John's take on the make-up of the custard and how to layer it.  You could also use sausage and include sauteed mushrooms, onions or bell peppers or any other vegetable you might use in a quiche.

This dish is so yummy!!!! The only thing I changed, which I never do to recipes, is I used cheddar & Swiss cheese and a little bit of diced onions. So good, writing this in my personal cookbook, it‚Äôs a keeper.

Very good breakfast casserole ! I made the night before with few changes. I tried to cut down on the fat content. So, I skipped the bacon and used low fat cheese and  a mixture of 2% milk and Half and half for the cream. I will add some mushroom next time.

Have made this several times and have one tip to add.  Purchased 8oz spinach in a microwavable bag.  3 mins,
open the bag and just enough to give this a nice layer of spinach.  Excellent recipe

It was good, made as stated with no changes except used frozen spinach. Different than the usual casserole but I thought it was too bready. pretty dense.

Made it, great recipe - a bit putzy, but used Collard Greens instead of spinach. Added a bit of onion and garlic powder and it was a very good brunch dish. Made my bacon ahead of time to save baking - I preferred using cooked bacon.

This is by far the best strata that I have made.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8 X 11 inch pan.  I prepared it the night before, placed it in the refrigerator and baked it the next morning.  I let it sit for 10 minutes before cutting.  Perfect.

Tried this but eliminated the spinach because of picky eaters. It was a big hit! Took leftovers to Mom who hates bread pudding & she loved it also. I used Arnold Artisan bread, it was easier to cut and denser than French. I should have let it bake another 5 or so minutes as center was not quite as done as ends. However there were no complaints at all. The video was really helpful. This will be made many more times!

It makes a HUGE amount.  I split into 2 different sized pans, one for me and hubby and one for taking to a ladies brunch the next day.  The recipe performed perfectly and was an all around hit.   Suggest that the first thing you do is cut up the bacon and begin cooking it.    I also used half & half mixed with whole milk instead of the pure cream.   i cooked the smaller pan that night and stored the larger in fridge for cooking the next day before the brunch.

Great recipe!  I used Chef John's tip and subbed some milk for cream.  
This recipe lends itself to other veggie fillings like sauteed onions, peppers, or broccoli.  Important to remove as much moisture as possible for even baking.

Followed the recipe, but turned out rather bland. Next time I will add onions and garlic powder and serve with plenty of
salsa...maybe mango salsa?

If possible this would receive no stars.  Nothing unusual and repeated ad nausea on this site.  Obviously, those who extolled  do not understand the "science" behind  creating "new" dishes.

Very good.  I took the advice of another reader and cooked it a little longer.  I think it caused everything to dry out too much.  Next time I will make it exactly as it appears.  I did add green onions.

I made this for guests...and enjoyed the leftovers. I used potato bread available at our local store. It made a beautiful presentation. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Used thick creme fraiche so not as juicy, also Brie. But still tasted fab!
