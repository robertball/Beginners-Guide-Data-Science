Easy and delicious recipe.  My kids ate several helpings.  You can make it with sticky, white rice as well.  Very delicious; the cilantro and mango make a delightfully refreshing combination.  We couldn't get enough.

This rice was good.  Not great.  I made it with Jasmine rice - but that was the only change.  Could have used a little more lime juice to enhance the lime flavor.

I rarely if EVER rate recipes horribly low, but this recipe needs some SERIOUS flavour.  It's quick enough to make but needs some spices/herbs to make it pop.  It was extremely bland.  I would also disagree w/ cubing the mango.  I think a rough chop is fine.

This recipie was very bland I had to add a ton of extra lime just to get any flavor.  Also the mango just didn't seem to go... Will probably not be making again

I wanted to like this recipe much more than I actually did.  It wasn't bad and I will probably try making it again, but it was missing something.  I did use white rice because that is all I had on hand.  It was a little dry...I think next time I will add more lime juice and hopefully that will compensate for the "missing" ingredient.

Pretty good.  The mango I had on hand was a bit over ripe, so the rice was a bit stringy.  But I really liked the flavor of the rice.  A nice change.

Very good!  I'm not a big fan of brown rice, but have been trying to find ways to incorporate it into our diet.  This was definitely a perfect match to the Grilled Fish Tacos.  Thanks!  Oh, I also through in a chicken boullion cube when cooking the rice.

I was disappointed that I couldn't find a mango in any of my grocery stores.  I had to use a can of tropical fruit.  It was good but my family didn't like some of the fruit.  I liked it but made the mistake of stirring in the fruit and letting it sit.  I should have known better it made the fruit warm.  I used dried cilantro which I added in the beginning so it could simmer.  I think it also needed more lime juice. Also, I will probably try it again with white rice.  I can't get my family to like brown rice.  Overall I think it is a refreshing change for a side dish.  I am definitely going to make it again and hopefully find some mango!

Tasteless, I had of extra ingredients. I added garlic,  pineapple, cracked black pepper, salt, dried basil, and a sauce. The sauce was a mix of soy sauce, vinager, and brown sugar. After all those extras the taste was allot better.

YUM! The only thing this needed was some salt to really bring out the flavors. This went perfectly with grilled shrimp. I'd say this makes more like 8-ish servings, not 12, so plan accordingly. I added a bit more lime juice, but that's just personal preference. I will definitely be making this again. It's simple and delicious!
