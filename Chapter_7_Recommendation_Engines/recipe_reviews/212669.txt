A rare combination of easy, exciting and actually wholesome, a great way to impress any guests. Adding garlic and onion to orange seemed a bit weird at the start, but the tastes blended together marvelously. The orange and onion rings are a perfect side dish in themselves, I just added some fresh herbs for serving. Will do again!

Very easy to make and was delicious! I almost always order Duck a l'orange whenever it is available on the menu, so it is nice to be able to make it at home. My husband likes it but thinks that it is too 'orangey', but then again, he generally does not like fruit in his main course - cranberry sauce with turkey grosses him out... But I think this is a winner!

I never made duck before and this recipe was a perfect first time recipe.  I didn't have orange marmalade but I used citrus marmalade and it was really good.  I would definitely make this again with only one minor adjustment.  I'd only use one garlic clove.

I have made this a few times and enjoyed it. 25 min is a bit long though. The meat was tough so the next time I soaked the duck in stale beer for 24 hours. Worked like a charm!!!! Also using the "juice" from the duck works great for making rice to go with it!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and was very impressed. We do not eat a lot of duck so I wanted something that was easy and full of flavor. This recipe is both. I believe the key is NOT to overcook the meat. The orange flavor was not overwhelming at all. I served this with rice and steamed vegetables. Will definitely make again.

The breast is overcooked and the fat did not render properly from the skin. Look up Chef John's orange duck recipe. Much, much better. You must score the skin and render the skin in a pan, maybe after that you could put marmalade on it and finish in the oven.

I don't eat duck.  But. My husband is a hunter and I told him I would cook the duck for him.   He said it was okay.  He stated that it was tough.  He thinks I over cooked it.
