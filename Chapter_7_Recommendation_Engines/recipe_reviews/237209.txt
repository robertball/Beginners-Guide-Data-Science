All my family enjoyed these quesadillas. The only thing I didn't add was the chili powder because I have 2 little girls and they don't like too much heat in their food. I used a red bell pepper that made the food more colorful. I didnt add any bell pepper to the Pico the Gallo because that's not the common way people have it in Mexico. I served it with Charro Beans (Frijoles Charros).
