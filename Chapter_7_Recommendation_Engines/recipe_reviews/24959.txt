Easy, incredibly delicious, beautiful, and tastes far more sinful than it is! Serving suggestion: serve with fresh raspberries that have been washed and mixed with a little sugar and Chambord.

A classic old fashioned recipe, best contrasted with an old fashioned egg custard sauce over the top. Just like grandma used to make.Comfort food dessert!

When it is fresh, it tastes mostly like a meringue, the texture being that way due to the egg whites.  I had no complaints about the taste per se, just the odd texture for a pudding.  I found the lemon juice to be slightly overwhelming so I would opt for vanilla next time.  When the remaining desert cups had sat overnight (this made too much for us to get through in one sitting) the meringue collapsed and left an even denser but odd, sticky texture.  I found making it to be far more labor intensive. On the bright side, it was beautiful and certainly themes well if you want to represent snow!
