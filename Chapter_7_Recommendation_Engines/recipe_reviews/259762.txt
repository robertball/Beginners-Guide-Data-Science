Just a quick update.. I make this a bunch for my Gluten intolerant wife. I find that it is very forgiving about what kind of gluten free flour you buy so to save money I will buy any gluten free flour on sale. Also I have added  many add thing like raisins etc.. Although I put it together as recipes states and then add the nuts, rasins etc.. and I have had no problem..

If you want this recipe to work:
Not the basic setting, it's just setting people up to fail, unless you are going to babysit it.  If your bread machine does not have a gluten-free setting but does have a rapid rise setting this will work.  If your only option is the basic I suggest running your bread machine empty and watching it.  Find at what time it does the 3rd quick knead of the bread mine is around when it has about 1 hour and 45 min left for the whole process. About 5 minutes before it gets there (I just don't like cutting it too close), cancel the machines process and let it sit for a couple of mins and then press bake.  This is gluten-free bread which does not like to nor does it go well when made to rise repeatedly.  If you do it like this the bread will come out much much better.

Is quite good. Simple and straight forward. I did use a spatula to make sure everything was mixed well. I would recommend a slight beating of the eggs, just enough to break the eggs. I substituted sugar for Splenda, the oil for ole ic oil and used gluten free flour with xantham gum. I like the texture, taste pretty good. Beats paying $7 bucks at the supermarket. Top in my list.

All in all, it’s not a bad recipe. I find bread maker breads rather heavy and I was a litte worried as gf bread tends to heavy naturally. Even my husband had a couple of slices and said it wasn’t bad and he hates most of my gf recipes.
