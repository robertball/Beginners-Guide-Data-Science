Loved it.  A great mingling of flavors. I slightly modified it: added two cans of beans, 1 teaspoon curry,  the whole can of corn and green chiles because I didn't want to waist it.

I didn't make it exactly as in the recipe as I didn't have ancho chili pepper or fire-roasted corn on hand.  I did add red bell pepper though.  This chili has a very hearty flavor, and it's very spicy.  Good though.  It's also a very thick chili.  If I made it again, I might add some water.  Would make this again!
