I can't believe that there aren't more "raving" reviews for this recipe!  I have made it several times, and it comes out great everytime!  I use a creamy alfredo sauce to top this pasta dish, and I have gotten terrific comments on it!  If you are a pasta lover as we are in my family, then you MUST try this recipe!  My hats off to you, Laura Smith!  Thankyou for a great dish!!!

This was delicious, I did saute the steak and vegetables with some fresh garlic and I think it would have been perfect just like that. I added some tomato alfredo sauce, which was good, but next time I won't use sauce and eat as is. Quick and easy, and a nice twist to both pasta and steak.
Thanks!!

This was wonderful!  I wasn't sure how to handle this recipe initially becaue the description of the recipe said to use your own sauce but the directions and the ingredients didn't say anything about using a sauce, so here's what I did, and it was great.  I used a jar of Alfredo Sauce and added garlic and pepper for a little more flavor.  I mixed the Alfredo Sauce with the cooked spaghetti and served the "Lush Pasta Mix" separately so everyone could top their own spaghetti with as much as they wanted.  The whole family loved it and I think it'll turn into a family favorite!!

Not much flavor and it seems that steak and pasta should not go together.

I didn't put sauce on mine.  I wish sauce was in the ingredient list because I would have purchased it if it were on my shopping list.  Anyway, this isn't very flavorful without sauce.  I ended up putting fresh parmesan on it and that pepped it up a bit.

This was delicious. I had to use only green peppers cause my daughter ate my other one before I could use it. I didn't see the sauce in the discription so I missed it until I read some reviews. Luckily I had a jar of spicy pepper sauce in the pantry. Tasty meal. It did need salt. Served with garlic bread

I also made this with alfredo sauce, but did make a few changes to the recipe based upon what I had on hand. I used zucchini instead of mushrooms, added lots of garlic, and used two tomatoes instead of one.  I also used a whole green pepper instead of half red.  The flavor was great, but was disappointed in how dry it turned out--there was not a lot of liquid to help flavor the alfredo sauce.  May use a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid next time to make it more sauce-like.

I made this using zucchini instead of the peppers since that's what we had (and my husband doesn't really enjoy peppers). It was served with alfredo sauce. We enjoyed it and will definitely have it again.

i made this for my boyfriend's birthday. I really don't cook often so I made a trial one and the actual one for his birthday.
I notice that the steak was a bit bland, so I add salt and pepper to the steak, rubbed it in and then added lemon juice. I placed the steak (with the lemon juice) inside of a ziplock bag and let it sit for a few hours. Turned out superb! =D

We loved this - used leftover grilled steak cut into strips, left off the peppers (husband dislikes), and stirred some alfredo sauce (recipe from the site, II, I think)into penne pasta, just amazing!  Thank you!

I liked this dish. I added garlic and used buttered noodles.  Quick and easy.  Will do this again. Thanks.

This was ok.  I think it would be better with chicken.  The steak with alfredo sauce just didn't appeal to us.  Michele, ontario canada

I made this when I wanted pasta but hubby did not want sauce. He raved about it and dug in for seconds!! I recommend using Ro-tel for a little kick. Yummers!!
