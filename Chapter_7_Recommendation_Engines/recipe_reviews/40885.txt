This fudge was so easy and super delicious! I love the little hint of mint....Just refreshing enough and not to rich...

This fudge was delicious!  Not too too sweet, but rich and chocolately.  The mint cookies are a perfect addition for a refreshing taste.  I loved it!

I love chocolate and mint together and this recipe satisfies that craving.  With the ease of this recipe I certainly won't mind making a batch every now and again when I feel the need..er..urge.  After cutting, I placed the fudge in the freezer and each day since it's been made I've been "sneaking" a piece....I think I prefer it straight out of the freezer!  I plan on adding a few pieces to the cookie tray I'm taking to mom's on xmas eve...the rest will stay in the freezer for me.  ;)

I am not much of a fudge lover & I have never made it before...but everyone in my family loves it so I decided to make it for a Christmas gift exchange. I made the first batch last night and I had to hide the fudge so I would have leftovers for the party on Saturday. 
It was SOOO easy and tasted even better!!! If I could give it 6 stars I would! :)

This is probably the best fudge I've ever had! I actually goofed and used all semi sweet chocolate instead of the milk chocolate it calls for, and it was awesome! Definitely a "Got Milk?" treat!

The recipe was easy and made fudge with a good texture.  Something was off with the flavor though.  I can't quite put my finger on the problem, but I probably won't make this fudge again.

This was fair. The flavor was good, but the texture was very dense, not very fudgy...I really don't know what could be done to help that out at all. There are better mint fudge recipes out there.
