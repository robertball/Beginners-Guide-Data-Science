This was fantastic!!! Ok, I didn't use the egg powder (it grosses me out) and I used 1 pkg. of rapid yeast. They are so light and with a perfect texture. I shaped them into 6 large rolls and they're the perfect size for sandwiches.Also, I cover them with a dish towle after they come out of the oven to keep the crust soft. I'm makeing another batch for tonights BBQ and shaping them into hot dog and hamburger rolls. I just added more oil, water and flour to the recipe but not more yeast. We'll see how they come out.

Finally!  I did it!  I made a whole wheat bread that came out correctly.  Thanks to the poster of this recipe.  I didn't use my breadmaker as it's broken, so I kneaded it in my Kitchenaid Mixer w/the kneading attachment.  First for 8 minutes, let rise for 50mins, then knead again for 8 minutes and let rise for 30mins, then cut and shape into 3 pieces and let rise again with a wet towel for 20mins.  Stuck it into a preheated 375 oven for 20 minutes.  Voila!!  Perfect small baguettes for lunch.

Very easy to make, but it made a really small loaf of bread. Definitely excellent for those on a diet. Tasted great!

This was SO good! I almost gave up on my bread maker. The last few breads have caved in. I decided to try this one after hubby had a health scare (really high blood pressure). We need to change our eating habits. I used 1 egg white for the powdered egg, 1 T splenda & 1 T sugar, added flax & vital wheat gluten - 1T. Wonderful!!! Even hubby said it was delicious. I have noticed my machine seems to only work on rapid rise so that is the setting & yeast I used for this one.

Perfect 1 pound whole wheat loaf. I used AP flour instead of the bread flour, and whole wheat pastry flour instead of the whole wheat flour. We live at 4600 ft. so I add an additional 2 tbsp. of water and used slightly less than 1 tsp. yeast to keep the loaf from falling. The result was a very light and airy bread. Will definitely use this recipe often!

the is by far the best recipe for bread machine. i was scared that the loaf will be too big for my small machine but it was just perfect. 
i did however make some changes 
i used 10 g of sugar and i added some dried herbs thyme , oregano and basil for extra flavouring.
i really reccomend this recipe .. oh also i didnt need to add extra flour or water. 
i am sure this will be a keeper (^ ^)b

This is a very good everyday bread recipe!  I've made it four times in the past week and it has turned out perfect every time.  I have stopped buying grocery store bread because of all the additives, this recipe is so simple I know it by heart already.  It's easy to throw the ingredients in the bread machine and go about my day without much time or effort.  The size is perfect for getting sandwich-size slices for my kids, and they love it toasted with butter too!  The small loaf also requires I make a fresh loaf almost daily, which my family appreciates.  This will be my go-to daily bread recipe from now on.

Good recipe (Thanks Scotdog for passing it along - AND for your tips).  I didn't have powdered egg substitute so I went with one egg white (per SD) and I used 2 cups of soft-milled whole wheat bread flour instead of mixing the white/WW.  I also added 1 Tbsp flax meal and 1 Tbsp of WW Gluten..made for a a very softy, fluffy bread.  I made it in the breadmaker on the dough setting as I like to bake my breads in the oven.  Once done in the bread machine, I rolled it out on the counter with a rolling pin and then rolled it up jelly roll style (like a French Loaf) and then let it rise for about an hour and then baked it...YUM! Pics coming to computer screen near you soon! :) Great recipe with Scotdog's tips, next time I may add some chopped sunflower seeds or walnuts....hmmmm...so many choices!

I had to make this twice because the dog grabbed the first loaf.  So, I tried again.  I used the breadmaker to make the dough then took it out and baked at 350 for about 35 minutes.  I didn't use the egg substitute--didn't have any--and had to add about 1/2 c flour to the mix.  It turned out a very light whole wheat loaf with good flavor.  I didn't use wheat gluten and didn't really need any, although it did take a while to rise.  Still, with patience this makes a very light loaf.  Thanks!

it made a small but good loaf. i added 1 tbsp of vital wheat gluten, it probably made it an even 'lighter' loaf.

This is a terrific and easy recipe. Works just as well with a kitchenaid mixer..Check the review & instructions given by crispystuff here on site..didn't need the egg, and used olive oil because that's what I had on hand..my husband says its even better than his Dad's bread! The only substitute I made was doubling the yeast to 2 tsps because my yeast had been sitting in the fridge a while! Kudos to the recipe provider!

This is a good base recipe. I used canola oil instead of veg oil, and I didn't use the egg substitute. Still turned out great in my bread machine!

Stalking Pomp:  This is very easy to mix up.  It did take awhile to raise.  I did not get the light and airy bread others got but it was still good. I used "White Whole Wheat" (that way the kid does not know) hehe... I will make this again, I might try just a bit more yeast and double it so I get a larger loaf of bread.  Thanks

This bread was fantastic. I left out the powdered egg but made the rest according to the recipe. It is so, so good. The perfect softness. Even after two days it was still soft and delicious. I'm going to start baking a loaf every day or two.

I didn't use the egg substitute (I didn't have it on hand) and used my bread machine on the dough cycle, then removed, shaped, let it rise and baked it at 350 until browned on top.  The bread came out soft inside, with a crust that could easily be cut and evenly sliced into sandwich bread. The flavor was good and it was devoured by the whole family.

very good recipe.  It came out so nice and light!  I substitute the powdered egg for 1 egg and added 1 Tbsp of gluten.  Also I didn't use machine and kneaded by hand.  Took 1 hour each to rise before and after putting the dough in the pan (could use little bit longer for the 1st rise) and baked 350 F for 30 min.

This was my 2nd loaf of bread and I love it!  My dh and 22 mt old love it as well.  I will definitely be making it again.  I love the smaller loaf.  It makes it so much easier to cut and get thinner slices.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Nice light texture and the whole wheat adds a nice nuttiness.  Made with Kitchenaid mixer for the dough and then rose/shaped by hand.  Very small recipe, made 6 dinner rolls (baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes).  Plan on doubling or tripling the recipe next time!  I think this is a nice basic recipe that you could add flavors onto depending on what you are using the bread for, this could easily become either savory or sweet.  Skipped the optional egg substitute, used olive oil for my vegetable oil, 1 T. maple syrup instead of 2 T. white sugar, didn't have bread flour or rapid rise yeast so just used all purpose flour and regular yeast in same amounts.

Great and light wheat bread! I did not use the powered egg (didn't have any on hand). I think it might have been my bread machine, but the ends of the bread were kind  of crunchy. Overall, yummy bread and I will definitely make this again!

I've made this twice now, first time, fluffy, next time very dense - don't know what I did different. Regardless, this is very good.  Made a loaf yesterday, and my husband asked me to make another one tonight.  Thanks for the great recipe

I omited the powdered egg.  It is perfect!!!  Note: I once tried to add an actual egg instead of the powdered egg an it fell apart.  I would not suggest trying to do that.  It comes out perfect without it.

Well, I'm fairly new to bread baking in particular but I am  quickly coming to enjoy it. This recipe is the most user friendly yet. I went conventional over machine though.  I only let it rise once for about 20-25 minutes as well. A four strand braided wheel was the perfect fit for this wonderful tasting wheat bread.

My 13-month-old daughter has had major issues with gaining weight, so I decided to make some whole wheat bread since it has more calories in it then the airy loaves in the store.  This recipe is DELICIOUS!!  I didn't have honey on hand, so I tried my luck on this recipe and am glad.  I also didn't add the powdered egg, and I put my bread machine on rapid cycle so it would be ready faster.  Make sure you check the dough a minute in like it suggests--I had to add about 2 tbsp of water.  The bread is ooey, gooey, and OH SO GOOD!  It'll be hard to save it for my daughter instead of eating it all myself!

This is a great recipe!  Of course, the yield is too small for my machine (I believe it bakes 1 lb loaves), so I doubled it.  I'm sure it would have been just great if I had followed the recipe exactly... Instead, though, here's what I did (and it turned out fine the way I did it, too, which isn't all that different): for the first measurement, I did everything exactly the same, except that I replaced the powdered egg substitute with ground flaxseed.  Then, for the second measurement (since I didn't realize I needed to double it until after I measured it the first time), I put in a little more wheat flour than unbleached white.  I also added in an extra teaspoon of salt (by accident).  I didn't use any flaxseed for this measurement, either; and, instead of the vegetable oil and sugar, I put in 2 tablespoons of honey.  Because the yeast didn't look like it was being mixed in, I added a little extra water, too (about 1/4 cup, probably).  Not sure I could ever make it exactly the same way again, but it worked, contrary to what I was expecting.

This bread was wonderful! As soon as it was cool enough to cut, my family was eating it with honey as a snack...Now, I'll just have to make another loaf!  Thanks so much for this easy recipe we just love it!  ps/I left out the egg

This was truly easy and tasty.  Did not use the egg substitute (didn't have any) and used 1 1/4 tspn active dry yeast (didn't have rapid rise) and it turned out light yet with a firm texture.  My little one's ate is straight out of the breadmaker!  And went back for seconds!

This is a great recipe. Easy to add extras to including jalepenos, rosemary, garlic, black olives, green chiles, &c. to make an artisinal bread, too! Lately have been using AP flour instead of bread flour. The first batch did not turn out too well. However, think I figured it out: AP flour, when you measure it, must be pressed down in the measuring cup to measure a correct cup! Also have added a guinea fowl egg to it; substituted olive oil; and a little half-n-half. All turned out splendidly. Finish with butter and garlic salt on top, too, for a terrific twist!

Turned out perfect first time I made it. I used 100% white whole wheat flour, 2 T melted butter, 1/2 t 21 Seasoning Salute from Trader Joe's and omitted the egg powder.

This is a good recipe for sandwich bread and toast.  I have made it many times now as we use our bread machine weekly to make bread for our lunch sandwiches. I do not add the optional egg mix, I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

This makes verrrrry yummy and nutritious bread. I did not use the egg powder because I didnt have any, and I used shortening instead of the veggie oil.  For the flour, I used half all purpose, half whole wheat bread flour.  It was great!!!

I use less sugar and add 1 tablespoon gluten when I have only all purpose flour. I double the recipe and use the dough cycle, then bake in a regular pan with dough to spare for some buns. Best bread recipe I have found so far.

The taste was very good but the loaf was very small. In the future I will probably double the ingredients. It was surprisingly moist for a whole wheat bread and my husband says it is divine when toasted.

I made a few substitutions. I am on a low sodium low carb diet so.....I used 1 tablespoon organic sugar and 1 tablespoon molasses, 1/4 teaspoon light salt. It turns out well, a little bland but such is the life of low sodium low carb. It is moist and rises well. Definitely my go to recipe for my bread. I even use it for pizza dough and add pizza seasoning when I mix the dough.

Good loaf of bread.  The bread had the perfect amount of moisture so it wasn't damp but did not leave your mouth dry.
Was a small recipe too so it allowed the bread to fit nicely in the toaster.

I have since converted it over to my stand mixer and it still works good

I don't have a bread machine so I put the bread dough in my Ninja blender with the dough hook and kneaded for 8 minutes. Turned it onto a pastry board and kneaded it until it was smooth and elastic to touch. I used whole wheat white  flour in place of the bread flour. Still, with the changes to the original I had to make due to the ingredients I had on hand at the time, this recipe made a small loaf that suited my husband,and me. This bread makes great toast! The toast from this whole wheat bread is  so good with apple cider jam and butter!

It was the first perfect whole wheat loaf I have made. I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt as a precaution to sinking. I used sunflower oil and omitted the milk product. Enjoying this recipe.

I made this twice, doubling the recipe both times to get a full-sized loaf. It was delicious, but both times I had to add an enormous amount of additional flour. The second time I used honey and sugar crystals in place of plain sugar - nice flavor!

Great recipe. The bread tasted amazing. I didn't have egg substitute so I used 1 egg white. I also used 2 cups whole wheat bread flour instead of the white flour/ wholewheat flour mix. Turned out great. Texture was lovely and so was the taste. My new go to recipe for whole wheat bread

I make 2-3 loaves a week, because that's how much we love it; especially my 16 month old toddler. I don't use the egg substitute (even though I have it) because I forgot the first time I made it and it was still awesome.

Pretty good, I used a real egg and then 3/4 cup of water minus the volume of the egg (if that makes sense). Very easy!
