I followed the recipe exactly and the livers turned out quite tasty. I did find it a little too sour though; I will tweek it a bit next time.

Wonderful. I gave it a 3 for three reasons. I had to adjust the lemon and red wine vinegar according to my taste. Second, I didn't have brandy. Third, I added about 2 tablespoons of tomato juice to cut down the acidity and to improve the consistency. However, that being done, if you are South African and don't have Peri-Peri sauce, try this recipe. It will remind you of sitting outside at Sunnyside Hotel, listening to music and enjoying true SA Peri-Peri chicken livers.

Good but not great. I love chicken livers and we usually eat them floured and fried with gravy (healthy!) or fried with onions similar to this recipe. However, I'm not sure the work, even though it was minimal was worth the difference. My wife ate it but didn't really care for it. I'll stick to my other methods. 

I did make a couple of changes. No peppers or brandy. Other than that, right by the book. When I look at the photo that was shown though, my Peri Peri looked nothing like that. I've uploaded a photo for comparison.

Interesting flavor, but I felt the vinegar overpowered the dish.  If made again, I will cut back quite a bit on the vinegar.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I bought veal liver and had no clue how to prepare it. This recipe was my solution. I had no worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar or brandy, so used red wine and balsamic vinegar instead. The balsamico was a nice touch and made up for the missing worce sauce. During dinner we put on our top 10 list of tasty dishes. Thanks for sharing!

I used lime instead of lemon. I would have liked it spicier but it was very flavorful. Marinating livers made them very soft. I will make this again.

I liked it.  Part of my 'secret single behaviour' when my wife and kids leave me on my own, as non of them thinks they like liver.  Silly people.  I found it to be 'makes-me-nose-run' flavorful, and delightful with fresh bread or rolls.  I have no complaints or ideas as to how to improve.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because I'm a hard marker.  And, by the way, the closest approximation to my favorite semi-fast-food Peri Peri Chicken Livers experience that I've been able to create at home.

WOW! So many flavours going on at once in your mouth.  The creaminess of the chicken livers, the tang of the vinegar, the heat of the pepper flakes, and the smoothness of the brandy.  Outstanding. I'll be making this one again.  I'm going to try it on pork as well.

Wow, what a great, easy and fun to make recipie. I was givin a pound of chicken livers and wasn't to sure what to do with them. Outside the obvious bacon wrapped version.
 Mmmmmmmm...... just like like the submitter stated great with bread to soak up with. The only thing I did different was the heat. It is a meal that screams "Give me hot Sauce!". 
 A meal that has Manly Man in mind.
 I didn't have any Brandy but substituted Burgandy.

I added 100ml of white wine together with 50ml of brandy and simmered to allow alcohol to cook off.
Also used chili flakes in lieu of red pepper flakes.
Excellent taste.

Excellent. Very tasty . Makes a good starter. It's a South African favourite and your recipie is very close. A touch more heat is required for perfection.

I love Nando's hot chicken livers. This recipe is better -- fresh, tasty - herby. Heaped my ts of pepper flakes and added some cayenne powder.  If you like livers, you have to make this recipe.

Woah! What a wonderful recipe! These chicken livers were delicious and melt in your mouth tender, and in a mild, aromatic almost curry-like sauce (which I would have never thought would go together so well).  
I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, and just added a little more stock and water at the end to thin out the sauce (it reduced more than I would have liked while I simmered). I served this with a huge dollop of sour cream on top, which was a great creamy addition with the tomato flavour - and bread to soak everything up.
I didn't find these livers spicy at all - mind you, my tolerance for heat the high - so next time I may add a little more red pepper flakes. 
I can't speak to the authenticity of this dish, this is the first time I've had anything Peri Peri, but I can say its absolutely delicious as is. Worth trying!

The sauce was very good! I was given some chicken livers and did not know what to do with them. However, I discovered that even though I liked the flavors of the dish - I don't like chicken liver at all. I bet that the same sauce and treatment would be yummy on chicken breast, though!
