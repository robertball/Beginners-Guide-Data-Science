These were really good for chicken burgers, which normally tend to try out. The only change I made was to use less bread crumbs (2/3 cup instead of 1 cup) because I don't like the spongy texture which results from too much binder. I really liked the method of mixing the onion, garlic, breadcrumbs together in the food processor.   I didn't cook as long as directed as 7 minutes per side would definitely dry these out.  I topped the patties with guacamole, cheddar and bacon. Yum!
