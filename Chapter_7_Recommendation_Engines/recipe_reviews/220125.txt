I loved this.  I followed it to a tee with the exception of using a boneless 2 pound roast (I'm a one person family).  I used the other ingredients at their original volumes though and it made an absolutely awesome mushroom gravy.  I served it over egg noodles.  The leftovers were even better!  The house smelled amazing while it cooked.  True comfort food and a keeper recipe.  Thanks, Chef John!

This is almost identical to the recipe I have used to cook pot roast for quite some time except I do mine in the same Dutch Oven I use to sear the roast and then put into the oven at 250 degree for 4 hours or even longer.

I do have 2 quibbles with his recipe however:
1) I normally use a 50/50 ratio of beef broth & dry red wine and

2) In those circumstances dried herbs will work at least as well and be far less expensive.

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't have time to brown the meat ahead of time, so I just put everything in the slow cooker for 10 hours and it tasted fabulous.  Will definitely make again.

I'm a fairly proficient slow cooker user and have made many a pot roast in mine.

I have to say this recipe went so far beyond my expectations as to be astounding. The true center of this recipe is the braising of the beef. I went beyond my usual Carmel color and went ahead to an almost blacked meat. 

The reward was some of the most beautiful sauce I've ever had in a pot roast. About 1/2 an hour before completion I added several quartered potatoes just because and the sauce made them the other star of this great meal.

I've used several of your recipes over the past year or so but really wanted to provide comment on this one as one of your finest. 

Good old fashioned America cooking on steroids! Thanks for all you do Chef John.

Okay for the most part.  "Pot Roast" is not a specific cut of meat, but with many cuts used (certainly the chuck roasts populr in the US) this is likely to come out overly fatty.  The flour is not necessary- use a nonstick pan to brown the meat.   If you want to use flour to thicken the liquid, it should be added near the end- long cooking will destroy most of it's thickening ability..  I have no idea what the food industry has against beef stock, but it's a better choice here (and many other places) than chicken.

Great recipe, and the mushrooms/onions/garlic mixture on top of the meat is great; I used this as a basis for my crockpot pot roast today. The only things I did differently were to use beef broth instead of chicken broth (seems a better fit, reinforces the beef flavor), and deglazed the mushroom/onion mixture with 1 cup of red wine (scrape the bottom to get all the good bits, then simmer until the wine is reduced), and then used just one cup of beef broth. Nothing smells better than pot roast cooking all day long in your home! I posted the recipe and photos in my blog, www.culinaryspirits.wordpress.com .

I've made this recipe twice, both times its turned out fantastic! Second time I made a few tweeks based on other reviews. I used a 3.13 pound boneless roast (for 2 people with leftovers) and seared it until almost burnt on both sides, ie got nice dark coloring and a nice crust on the roast. Only additions/changes I did were: I quartered Yukon Gold potatoes (like 6-8 potatoes) and put them in with the celery and carrots at the bottom of the pot. I put the roast right from the searing pan into the crock pot on top of the veggies and let it rest in there instead. I used Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth and got a great rich flavor and I added 1 Tablespoon Low Sodium Worcestershire to the mushroom/onion/broth mixture and let simmer before I poured over the meat. It smelled great when I walked in the door and made a great dinner (and leftovers) on a cold October night after work! Highly recommend!!!! Thanks Chef John!

This was the best recipe i have found so far. I have been trying for so long to make a tender roast and end up with something quite similar to a brick... In this recipe I put the crockpot on low instead and used chuck roast with a lot of marbling and it was amazing! Thank you Chef John!

Someone mentioned about not tasting the fresh herbs. fresh herbs should be put in towards the end of the cooking time, otherwise they lose their intense flavor. Maybe more should be added towards the end.

Great dinner and leftovers make a great stew for later on.  I make one addition. I add two tablespoons of Sweet Vermouth.

This recipe is a real winner!! Be sure to follow the directions through and you will be extremely satisfied. It takes about 20-30 to prep the meat and sauce before you add it all to the crock pot. So if you're making it before you leave to work, remember that. Once I came home, it was perfectly tender and ready to eat. I removed some of the juice in the pot and made a easy gravy. Start with the roux, equal parts butter and flour in sauce pan, whisk together til it looks like frosting. Then slowly add the juice that you removed from the crock pot. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer and boil til it reaches your desired thickness.

This was delicious, no need for gravy,the mushroom mixture really keeps the meat tender and very flavorful! My husband loves to serve with egg noodles and red cabbage. Reminded me of Sunday night family dinners when I was a kid only better, a family favorite!

We liked this dish very much.  It did indeed need salt pepper after cooking.  I also wish I could've tasted the rosemary and thyme more.  Perhaps I will try adding a bit more next time.  Any suggestions?  I followed the recipe except using a top roast and adding red potatoes to this dish, excellent!

Delicious!  As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted beef broth & red wine for the chicken broth and threw some peeled, quartered potatoes in the slow cooker about 1.5 hours before the end of cooking.  Also, I used a 3 lb boneless chuck roast.  The meet was tender and the sauce/gravy was delicious!  Will definitely cook again!

YES YES YES!!!!! (i added a splash of red wine with the chicken broth...ok maybe more than a splash) You have to sear the meat as John says, it gives it depth. I have also made this using herbes de provence for the seasoning

My family said this is the best roast I have ever made, not really any "leftovers" left.  Followed recipe exactly except I had to use dried herbs and after reading previous reviews, I added a little more salt and pepper.  I got a late start so ended up cooking in oven at 250* for about 4-4.5 hours.  They didn't even want to bother with eating it over noodles or mashed potatoes.  Next time I will add potatoes, but will have to use larger roast if I want leftovers or plan to feed more than just my hubby and 11 yr old son as they devoured a 2.5 lb roast.  I wasn't sure about the chicken broth, but the rave reviews erased my doubts and the house smelled fantastic!

I used a 3 lb. boneless tip roast and omitted celery due to our personal preferences. I also used jarred pre-minced garlic, dried herbs, pre-sliced baby bella mushrooms, and just under 16oz. baby-cut carrots to make it easier.  I'm no chef and accidentally added the tomato paste before the flour, LOL, but this roast was delicious!  I didn't even bother trimming the meat like I usually do (was running out of time for it to be ready for dinner) and the fat literally just fell off the meat when pulled out of the cooker.  The resulting liquids resembled a sauce or gravy of sorts, and was tasty on the mashed potatoes.

This recipe is the very first thing I've ever cooked in a slow-cooker.  (Grandma's '70s 4 or 5qt. old-school cooker lol! Thanks Grandma!) I love that this is the only roast I've found so far that included rosemary (my absolute favorite herb) and also thought it was super cool that it did NOT include creamed soup or liptons onion soup mix (not that I'm hating on those recipes... they are really yummy too!).

Thanks for such a delicious addition to my recipe box.  I'm sure it will be a recurring meal for us here!  :)

Cooked a 4½ lb boneless roast (that came tied from the butcher) for 7 hrs in the crock pot, for four people, and it turned out GREAT! Everyone agreed that it was the best roast and best gravy they had ever eaten; even after we were done, we stop ourselves from picking at the leftovers. The roast was literally falling apart and had it not been tied, I could not have gotten it out of the crock pot. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used ½ cup red wine and increased the chicken stock (concentrated) to 4 cups.

Best pot roast I have ever made. I did double the amount of fresh thyme and rosemary as per another reader's suggestion. The gravy was spectacular; I loved the fresh taste without the overload of salt you get when you add dried soup mixes or condensed soups. Served with yukon gold mashed potatoes. Awesome meal!

I was psyched by all the rave reviews on this recipe.  The beginning seemed fairly labor intensive for cooking in the crockpot (I usually stick to the "just dump everything in" kind of recipes) but figured if it helped me make a decent pot roast, it would be well worth it.  Unfortunately, my labors did NOT pay off.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY with the exception of using dried herbs vs. Fresh.  My pot roast came out very dry, and when I say very dry I mean we could hardly eat it.

My first attempt at a crock pot roast - absolutely fantastic!  I don't like mushrooms, but it was still amazing.  Cooked pretty much as the recipe stated except that at the end I added some cornstarch/water to help thicken my gravy.  My cut of meat was a Beef Eye Round Roast, 3.52 lbs.  I cooked on high for 5 hours, then reduced to low for probably another hour.

Another hit! As Chef John indicates in the video, using the correct technique is important. Definitely worth the time to give your roast a good sear along with prepping the mushroom and onion to a caramelized state prior to adding to slow cooker. Only minor change I made was to use 2 cups (homemade, no sodium) chicken broth and ½ cup dry red wine. If you’re using the 7-bone roast, plan to spend some time skimming off the fat.  Served over extra wide buttered egg noodles.

Loved this recipe as I LOVE all of Chef John's recipes!! I always add to my recipes, just because that's who I am LOL.. anyway, used a 6 lb boneless "English Roast" cause that is all I had on hand, added 1-1/2 cups of red wine to deglaze pan after I added the tomato paste (a bit more than called for), added way more carrots, mushrooms and garlic (cause I have a big eatin family), added "quartered" red potatoes about 1-1/2 hrs prior to turning the crock pot off (because I was lazy and didn't feel like making mashed).  I turned crock pot on lowest setting and cooked all day YUM YUM!!  Also, no fresh spices that day so I used dry.  I am not a lover of THYME, so I will leave that out next time haha(PERSONAL CHOICE!!!).  Also I always add more spice than recipes call for, just because we like a LOT of spice!!  Next day, served dish with spetzle and OMG was it GOOOOOOD! Thanks Chef John for another GREAT RECIPE!  LOVE YOU MUCH :)  and Bon Appétit!

This is the best pot roast I have ever made. All I can say is wow. Reminds me of the way my mom made it growing up. Tender pot roast, wonderful flavor and a good smelling house too. Fabulous served over mashed red potatoes with the homemade gravy on top. No changes for me, I like it the way it is.

Just made this for dinner with guests and it was a HUGE hit. I've made lots of roasts and this was pretty much the best I've had. I used a 3 pound sirloin roast, cut the chicken broth a bit and added a half cup of red wine. Also used dry vs fresh rosemary and thyme. Flavor was fabulous.

This recipe was absolutely amazing!  I wasn't able to find a 5lb bone in roast.  I used a 3lb boneless.  I also didn't use mushrooms because of a food allergy. The meat was moist and tender and so delicious!  I strained the juices and added a flour slurry and made a gravy.  I also added small white potatoes and had a complete meal in the one crock pot!  It was delicious.  My boyfriend devoured it.  I would absolutely make this again.

This is the same basic recipe I have used all my life.  I have ALWAYS felt anytime you braise any meat in a crockpot or in the over, it's important to sear the meat (with well-seasoned flour) to help impart additional flavor and color.  It also helps to thicken the sauce/broth which is makes a great gravy.

So easy and very good! The beef was so juicy and tender - it fell off my fork! We didn't have all the vegetables so we added broccoli and I also added potatoes, because I couldn't imagine pot roast w/o potatoes!

I usually make pot roast in a cooking bag, but tried this recipe for a change. We were delighted with the tenderness of the pot roast, and it made a nice gravy after I removed all the yum-yums once the meat had been removed. I added cut-up potatoes with about 90 minutes left to make sure they were done and that worked out well. The cooked-down celery made a great topping over the meat after carving it.  Next time I think I'll try beef stock vs chicken stock, just to see of it's any better. Recommended!

This is WAY labor intensive and really didn't merit all the work.  I'll stick with my basic broth and Italian seasoning over a beef roast with cut-up veggies in a crock pot.  Takes 1/4 of the time and the flavor is better.

Five stars for tasting good and for being a slow cooker recipe that doesn't have canned soup or any other processed food.  I have had such a hard time finding slow cooker recipes with whole food ingredients, and I will use this one as a guide to experiment with as I try to expand my slow cooker repertoire.  Try this instead of the one with 2,000+ reviews that does no more than throw a can soup and a seasoning packet (both loaded with msg, cholesterol, and preservatives) into the crockpot.  It tastes way better, it's way healthier, and it only takes about 10 more minutes to put together.  I am not a fanatic when it comes to eating "naturally," but I do like to eat real food.

My first time making beef pot roast. I have decided to add potatoes along with a touch of fish sauce for deeper tasting. It is soooooo gooooood.  I will make it again.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

I usually love Chef John's recipes, but this one left me kind of flat.  I was trying to find a way to use my slow cooker that didn't involve cream of (fill in the blank) soup.  I believe the flour on the meat created sort of a messy consistency to the sauce at the end.  Also, this is a rather greasy cut, and the boiling that takes place in the slow cooker just distributes all the fat into the other ingredients.  I prefer a slow oven roast.  The meat was tender, and I had plenty of sauce using only 1 and 1/2 c. of BEEF broth.  In fact, I think my 5 quart cooker would have overflowed with 2 and 1/2 c. of liquid.

Really very good recipe.  Used beef broth instead of chicken broth, and dried herbs instead of fresh... And boneless rather than bone in... Its still was fantastic!  The prep is very important... Makes all the difference I believe.  Thx for posting!

Just OK, I didn't notice any difference in flavor from when I would just salt and pepper the meat and throw in some carrots. Actually, I thought the celery just doesn't belong with roast beef.

Thank you for a lovely change to my boring pot roast recipe. I used a large London Broil and cooked some small organic  potatoes separately in a light chicken broth. Since my roast was only 3 lbs, I had room to add them at the end. Meat has become so expensive, and being a fitness nut, my kids love when I add potatoes to anything. It helped stretch my budget. But loving the mushrooms. (I also  pulled the meat apart when it was done. Keeps the meat with the meal. Another budget stretching trick.)

Growing up, pot roast was a Sunday dinner staple. It always smelled delicious, but it really didn't taste like much of anything.  So, for years I was anti pot roast!! I stumbled upon this recipe a couple of years ago and now this is in our regular dinner rotation. I make this recipe completely as written and would not change a thing. Thanks Chef John!

I knew right away that this recipe was from an experienced chef. If you want the flavor you have to take a few extra moments and steps to sear the meat, saute the onions etc.etc.  The end result is that a normally tough piece of meat has been tenderized and the combinations of flavors is amazing.  The only thing I did differently was I used home made organic beef broth (cause I had it) and red wine. (also I take the time to cook my mushrooms in butter till they are brown and crusted with sea salt then add the wine and scrape up the tasty bits) OOOh La La!!!!

Wow!!  This is an incredible recipe.  I used a 3 pound boneless chuck and it melted in our mouths.  It made a delicious gravy too.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with boiled potatoes.  My family couldn't get enough.

I used a 3 lb rump roast (had on hand) and used the rest of ingredients as listed. I didn't have fresh rosemary or thyme, so I put 1 teaspoon of each in the mushroom sauce. I cooked it on high for 3 hours and then 4 hours on low...still wasn't fork tender, so I put it on high again for another 1 1/2 hours. Finally started falling apart (it was a pretty thick piece of meat). Taste was awesome, but it did need more salt. Served over egg noodles. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good - I did modify it a bit - I left out the mushrooms and carrots because I didn't have any on hand.  And I used a boneless cut and dried herbs.  But it was very tasty and a big hit with the family.  I strained the juices and thickened them a bit with a flour/milk mixture to make gravy and served with mashed potatoes.

this is BEST pot roast recipe ever!! The only changes I made was to finish cooking in the oven instead of the slow cooker (I didnt have a lot of time. I also seasoned it with a little meat tenderizer. My husband and I enjoyed every bite. This is a keeper.

This was my first attempt at making pot roast and it was perfection over mashed potatoes! I couldn't find a bone-in chuck roast so I used boneless and it was fantastic. My boyfriend said it may be his favorite meal ever.

Very good recipe!  I did modify it though. Mostly because I can't have pot roast with out potatos.  The rest of the tomato paste would have been wasted if I only used one TBS of it, same with chicken broth. Modifications: 1. I used less than 5 lbs pot roast and it was boneless.  2. I added potatoes.  3. I put the whole small can of tomato paste and whole box of chicken broth in and added more flour.  4. I used dry rosemary and thyme. (all i had). Those are minor changes for a pot roast.  It was very good and I've made it twice so far.  I make it at night, cook till morning, then reheat in crockpot for dinner. Simple and delish!

No one believed that this was my first time making pot roast.  The meat was tender and flavorful, just how it should be!

I made this today and it was delicious. The delicious smell tempted us all day while it cooked. I cut up my meat (a nice slab of chuck roast) and seasoned it with all the seasonings in the recipe plus powdered onion and garlic since I hate the texture of the "real" things in my mouth. It was so good that I forgot to take a picture! So mine is of the tiny bit of leftovers in a plastic container :) so yummy!

This is the third time I have made this recipe.  It is by far the best pot roast recipe I have ever made. Full of flavour and the gravy is great over mashed potatoes. I agree that searing the beef is key.   The tomato paste adds that little something  and sautéing the onion garlic and mushrooms adds a lot of flavour.  I also sautéed the celery.  This is a permanent part of my recipe box.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Unfortunately I wasn't all that impressed with the dish even though I not only followed the instructions but when I found it lacking in taste I added some more herbs.  Also the gravy was thin.  I did however enjoy it the following day when I added more veg and thickened the gravy.  I did expect more taste especially after taking the time to brown etc on the stove first. It is so interesting to read other reviews and then have expectations not met.

My first even pot roast. Absolutely delicious! Worth the wait! My husband loves it. It's a healthier version than using dry onion soup mix and canned cream of mushroom soup. Two thumbs up! :)

This Slow Cooker Beef Roast recipe was wonderful!
We are living in South Korea for the next year, so this was a wonderful "feel like home" dinner. 
Since beef is so expensive here, we were fortunate to be visiting relatives at Kunsan Air Force Base, where we were able to get some U.S. beef.
Thinking I had everything now to make a wonderful dinner, I realized that I did not have any tomato paste, so I decided to substitute it with a teaspoon of Korean 'hot pepper paste.'  WOW...now that gave it a kick.
I didn't have any celery, so I used carrots and potatoes on the bottom.
About 10 minutes before we were ready to eat, I added some Korean dumplings to the top of the roast and simmered them in the juices. 
Needless to say...It was a hit with my husband and neighbor.
If you can't be at home, you can sure make the best of it with this recipe. Thanks Chef John!!!

YUM!!  I especially liked the flavor of the mushroom gravy/sauce.  It tastes similar to Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup, which is not always available at the store.  I think I'll use this recipe from now on.  It's even better and you can control the amount of salt, and other ingredients.  I also used a smaller chuck roast, without a bone.  It was so tender.  I removed the roast from the crock pot at about 7 hours.  I also was cooking small red potatoes which I removed from the pot at about 4 hours. (If I was not going to be at home, I would not put the potatoes in for the full day.) Typically, I add bay leaf to pot roast, but did not miss it at all with this recipe.  I loved it Chef.  Keep them coming!!

I followed this recipe exactly. This is honestly the best slow cooker roast I've ever eaten. My husband literally didn't talk for 5 minutes and licked the plate clean. Thank you for the PERFECT recipe - easy to follow and delicious results!

I was looking for a pot roast recipe I could adjust for my Mom's gluten intolerance and this was it!  I used corn starch instead of flour and left out the mushrooms as my hubby doesn't like them. I will make those separately with bacon and onion.  Added about 1/4 cup red wine and homemade chicken stock.  It smells divine!  I will also make mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and boston lettuce with sour cream herb dressing---super YUM for a sunday dinner.

I followed this recipe to the letter.   It was so easy and I actually had fun making it.   I am NOT someone who you would call a cook.  In fact, I am about as novice as they come.   Because of an injury that has me out of work, I have taken over the cooking in my house.   I have always been able to cook the simple dishes, but, now that it is my duty, I have had to step it up.  This being said,  I can't stress enough how EASY this recipe was to make.    Everybody in the house says that this was the ABSOLUTE BEST POT ROAST that they had EVER HAD.   Can't wait to try it again.

Another winner from Chef John!  I made this exactly as written, except my roast was just over 2 lbs. and I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used 3/4 tsp each of rosemary and thyme.  I also added a little Montreal steak seasoning to the salt and pepper before I seared the meat.  I cooked it for 6-7 hours on high.  It was delicious.

AMAZING POT ROAST!!! I WILL MAKE IT ALL THE TIME LIKE THIS!! no soup mix or pot roast seasoning packet. And perfectly seasoned!!! Just had to add a pinch of salt when I served it but its better to add to the the roast rather then being overly salty when its done!! It turned out amazingly tender!!! the flavor was fantastic!  I used baby portabellos for the mushrooms and it gave the roast a nice rustic flavor! my hubby ate 2 servings!! My two year old son even ate it and my four year old daughter loved it! GREAT RECIPE!! If I could give it ten stars I would!!!

Excellent! Followed the recipe as written with the exception of using dried herbs instead of fresh. Using my faithful Dutch Oven, I baked this, covered, at 300 degrees for several  hours - adding the carrots and celery after the first hour. Served with mashed potatoes -very tender and tasty - thank you, Chef John !

Can I offer my own variation of pot roast? Just made this past week for a company dinner.
Used a can of ale, cream of mushroom soup;onions, potatoes, multi-coloured carrots; lots of italian seasoning;one packet onion soup mix(  instead of salt) 5-6 cloves of garlic; rosemary and bay leaves(removed after three hours)5-6 squishes of Heinz Spice Ketchup: and almost ¼ c maple syrup!
And yes, altered seasoning as it cooked on high for about 6-7 hours.
Made oodles of gravy and meat was tender and very yummy! The vegs were wonderful. Served with asparagus which I roasted with olive oil and parmesan cheese.
Improvising sometimes really works!

OMG! I'm not a beef eater usually, but my roommate is, so I bought a blade roast on sale. I followed the recipe, only substituting the chicken broth for vegetable broth (it's all I had on hand), and it turned out perfectly. I made a plate up for my neighbour who was feeling ill, and I got a voice message from her saying only this: 'YUM,YUM,YUM,YUM,YUM,YUM...!' I served garlic mashed potatoes with the gravy and it was delicious. The browning of the meat made all the difference, I think. Thank you for posting this!

I just made this and it was fantastic.  My roommates loved it.  The only complaint I had was that prep actually took an hour.  I'm either not very experienced or I forgot to hire someone to pre-cut everything.  Aside from that I highly recommend it.

I wanted comfort food and this recipe delivered. Pot roast is a favorite of mine amd this was so easy to put together. It was reaIly simple to prepare. The only difference, I was making for a weeknight dinner so I cooked it on low for about 10 hours. It was so tender and delicious.  I served with mashed potatoes, carrots and sauteed spinach. Definitely will be working this into my rotation,  I forgot what great weeknight meals you can make with a slow cooker. Thanks Chef John!

This was very good. Made as directed with the addition of extra herbs towards the end and put potatoes in during the last 1 hr 1/2. I happened to make it on a night of a huge winter storm here and THE only piece of meat left in the store was 3.5lb top roast. I HATE carrots. These are excellent in the slow cooker for hours in the gravy. Melt in your mouth good, so if you have kids who won't eat their carrots, try this.

It turned out good, but like some others, I didn't really taste the spices at all (me having to use salt and pepper after the meal is cooked....rare for me!); thus why I gave it three stars instead of 4 or 5. We followed the recipe almost to a T...we omitted the mushrooms out of personal preference, and added some sliced potatoes, because having a roast without slow cooked potatoes just didn't seem right. But thank you for the recipe anyways!

I am sure this is a five star as is.  However, I did make some modification.  I used 2 cups low sodium beef broth and a cup of red wine instead of the chicken broth.  I used a a boneless roast.  It came out amazing!  It takes just a little more effort than some recipes but so worth it.

Absolutely delicious!  I used boneless chuck roast and doubled the amount of mushrooms.
My family is asking for this meal again this week.

Excellent!  I prefer to cut the beef into chunks about 3in cube. This way you can get the seasonings and flour on all sides. You can add a half-cup of burgundy wine for "bourginon" flavor.

Fantastic! Served over hot buttered spiral noodles seasoned with garlic powder.  Also, had it with a side of cottage cheese with fresh chives mixed in.  Wonderful compliment to it ~ Kids and Hubby loved it.  Sharing with all of the ladies at work! Thanks

This made a very tender roast with amazing gravy--I used beef broth instead of chicken.  If I made this again, I would decrease the cooking time or cook on low.  My roast came out quite dry.  I only cooked it on high for 4 hours, then switched to low for 2 hours, but I guess I still let it cook too long.

Made it today and it was the best!!!!  Because I'm Hispanic and love spices, I made my own rub for the beef other than that followed every step. It was tender, flavorful and the gravy according to my hubby was PERFECT!!!

Good for the tenderness of the meat and vegetables, just 'light' on the flavor. Using beef stock or beef stock and red wine would definitely make it richer. Adding a bouquet garnet for subtle earthy tones could also be a plus. Easy to follow, hearty a

Fantastic. I added turnips but other than that would not change a thing! If you like roast on the medium rare side I would decrease the time to 4 - 4 1/2 hrs.

This was easy and delicious.  It smelled awesome while it was cooking.  Next time I will add more veggies because there was a lot of meat.  My family enjoyed it.  Keep the recipes coming Chef John.

Oh. My. GOSH! This is the best pot roast I've ever had (sorry, mom). The only pain is that you have to cook the onions and sauce before hand which makes it hard to do on a weeknight. I made the sauce the night before and kept it in a separate container in the fridge. In the morning, I poured the sauce over it and then put tiny Yukon Gold potatoes on top (I have a small crock pot). I put it on low for about 3 1/2 hours and when I got home, I turned it on high for another 4 hours. Remember, mine was cold from being in the fridge. It was perfect. The meat is crazy tender and the potatoes were soft without being mushy. Will definitely make again - hopefully I don't lose is recipe!

LOVED this recipe! And so did my family! There were a few things that I did differently: I didn't use mushrooms (because my husband doesn't like them) but added potatoes instead, I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, and I cooked the roast for seven hours on high instead of six hours. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and this pot roast was the bomb! Thanks, Chef John... you're the man!

Fantastic recipe. Watch the video- it's very informative. I use a large bone in chuck roast. You must brown it and get a good crust on it before adding to the crockpot. Then the caramelized onions and mushrooms are what make the dish. The whole thing comes together beautifully and is nothing like those horrible pot roast recipes where they throw everything into the crockpot raw. I serve this over mash potatoes and it is always a winner with everyone.

This was AWESOME! Embarrassingly enough, I have never made any kind of entree in a crockpot, let alone a pot roast. I am a terrible cook and thought for sure I'd mess this one up but I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out fabulous. Easy and relatively quick to prepare. I opted not to add potatoes as many suggested and instead made garlic mashed potatoes. Such a good & hearty meal. The only thing I'd change is adding more carrots and celery next time but that's just a matter of personal taste. Definitely try this one! It will be going in my recipe book.

Loved this recipe, and have made it at least 12 times so far, and after trying to make it better i've done good things and not so good things. First, heavily season the meat before the sear, try using larger chunks of salt if you can. 2nd, Use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, gives you a better sear, and tastes better in the final product. 3rd, add additional salt, you can try different things, i add about a tablespoon of soy sauce, but its up to you. Do not add more than 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, this will make the roast taste sweet, and the meat will flop apart. make sure the meat stays in the slow cooker for the full time frame, even if you do get a boneless chuck roast, and always de-fat the roast before serving. This last thing is just something i've noticed, try to use a smaller pan for the sear, I use a 10", helps hold in the moisture as the heat drops less when the meat is added (you'll notice less bleeding in the pan).

this is fantastic. truly a great dish to enjoy on a cold winter night. i added a bit of lemon zest for that extra "oumf" of flavor. not overpowering. if i could, i would eat this everyday. good job.

This recipe was good. However, it was not delicious enough to set it apart from other pot-roast recipes, to be considered 'excellent'. I like your recipes Chef John, but I shall skip this one. Thank you for posting it.

I tried this for the first time today and it was wonderful. I added corn starch to the left over juices and it made the most delicious gravy; no additional seasoning necessary. I didn't change a thing and will be keeping it for future use!

It was so nice to try a real pot roast recipe that didn't involve pouring a can of soup and onion mix in a crock pot.  With kids that eat gluten and dairy free I was able to sub the flour for another kind and it was a wonderful family meal!  I accidentally bought a boneless chuck roast rather than bone in - but still perfect!

Very delicious !! I cooked at the conventional oven for 4 hours on a 250F temperature. It was very tender and moisture. Added more salt and pepper in the end. Added also all more thyme and rosemary in the middle of time.

Very tasty.  Had never made a pot roast before, and it turned out wonderful.  I only wished I had started making it at about 9 in the morning, so I could have let it cook in the crockpot for another hour or so to see if the meat would be even more tender and yummy.  Thanks for the recipe and video!  My family loved it :)

This was very good!  The first time in the crock pot with bone in.  The second was in the oven at 300.  I think next time, if the oven is used, 250 or 275 is better when you put it in at noon.

I followed the recipe but the roast I cooked was boneless.  It was okay...the meat was a little stringy and chewy.  Won't make again.

I've been cooking roasts like this for a long time and it's so true about the searing on all sides... great flavor. My only difference is occationally I will use a 1/2-3/4 cup red wine in the pan after the searing for a different flavor. Other wise the rest is the same. Just wonderful!!

I did not care for this recipe at all.  The beef was fairly moist, and the vegetables cooked nicely, but the flavor wasn't my favorite. My butcher recommended a bottom roast, which is a better cut that the top roast. Mine was around six pounds, and I cooked it on low for around 8 hours. It cooked nicely, but again the flavor was just so-so. I won't be using this recipe anymore.

Really, really good. Used a 3 lb roast and the whole can of tomato paste but kept all other measurements as stated in recipe. Cooked in oven using oval 8qt LeCreuset for 4 hrs at 255. Meat was tender and had great flavor. Will definitely make again!

Husband and I both loved it. Best to cook on low overnight so meat can be flaked with a fork. Thicker sauce makes for a more stew-like consistency.  Add potatoes along with the other vegetables.

Love this recipe--its become a staple in our house.  I don't use the tomato paste, mostly because I never have it on hand, and it comes out great.  I always make a ton extra to eat for leftovers or to put away in the freezer.

I followed the recipe except used a 2.5 lb. pot roast instead of 5 lbs. It is great!!! We had it over mashed potatoes and it is a wow meal. You will not be disappointed if you make this meal.

I made it in a covered roasting pan. 400 for 15 min., then 325 for 3 hrs. or so. Excellent, except there wasn't enough gravy for us. Will double the gravy ingredients next time and maybe add some extra veggies. I'll definitely be making this again. Nice change from the traditional brown gravy.

I couldn't get fresh herbs so I used dried.  Otherwise made exactly as directed and enjoyed a really great Sunday night dinner served over mashed potatoes. Even hubby who is not a big potato fan scarfed this up.  Adding to my regular crockpot section so thank you Chef John for another great recipe.

Husband said he could have eaten the entire thing himself. Works really well with any type of root vegetable and the mushroom sauce on top is key to flavor. Seasoned the beef but did not rub it with flour and I think that gave a better sear. Cooked in Slow-cooker on low for about 10 hours because neither of us could have made it home from work sooner.

I though this turned out well. I didn't even have the mushrooms or celery and it was still fine. When it was done, I removed the beef. Then, I poured the liquid in a gravy separator which I then strained. The liquid was between and au jus and a thin gravy. It worked well with the meat and potatoes. I also really liked the carrots, wish it had a little more of them. I also liked that it wasn't as salty as using packaged seasonings or canned soups like so many pot roast recipes utilize today.

Amazing, I had substituted tomato paste for A-1 & mushrooms for green pepper, added red wine, potatoes, green onions and shallots to the regular onions for more flavor!

I really loved this recipe. The beef was so tender it just fell apart. It was as good as mine but my other family members didn't like the herbs since they were not used to that flavor. Would definitely make this again.

This recipe would be easier if I could just put all the ingredients in the slow cooker but I guess the meat will not turn out to be as good as when you seared it first. I ran out of tomato paste so I just used tomato sauce and it turned out good. My husband loved it and my kids surprisingly ate it too. I made potato perogies as the side dish and my family loved it. So all in all I think this recipe is amazing!

This is the second meal for this fine recipe. Lacking some of the ingredients , and to far to run to the store, i did some substitution. I used beef stock instead of chicken and tomato sauce instead of paste, increased the flour to thicken.

I wasn't able to find a bone in roast so I used chuck roast. Otherwise I left everything exactly as directed and served with mashed potatoes. Everyone, including my 2 children with special needs who only like peanut butter, loved it!

Have made many chuck roast or pot roast like at least 60 in a crock pot. First I some time brown it with no flour and it and still comes out great with different spices like bay leaf I have used different ways of making it like with cream of mushroom soup, onion soup mix, Better than Bouillon, also added red wine to make it really tender of course Vegies and potatoes It is all done by matter of flavor u went but taste it when it goes in crock pot. Mine is about 8 hours for this is tough piece of meat and then I just stir it with flour in crock pot  with everything in it and thickens up fast and comes out excellent. Just play around with it. But I would never think of using ranch or Italian dressing mix for this roast and like one person said to salty in another recipe of course it would be. Have fun and enjoy. I sometime compare recipes from other sites and then make my own Chuck Roast. Sorry no picture. This recipe is close to mine.

Good recipe, loved the result.  I made a one change.  The use of chicken stock puzzled me.  I used beef stock instead.  Also, my mushroom of choice is crimini.

Tremendous, but rather fatty. I made as written, except with dried herbs, and it was very tasty but not particularly good for you :). The broth made for an amazing soup the next day as well!

Ditto review of 3/16/12. The smaller boneless 2 lb roast worked fine for me and my husband. The flavors were terrific. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes on the coldest night we have had in GA in years.  Had some nice leftovers. Enjoy!

Let me begin by saying. I hated roasts..I had bad memories from childhood of these dried up roasts, and I vowed never to eat them again. However, we ended up buying part of a cow from the local fair, so, of course, some of the cuts of meats were roasts...O, no, what to do. Well, I stumbled upon this recipe and used a 7 bone roast with it. Wow, amazing. I did add more chicken broth to the crock pot. Now, I see that I should have added fresh herbs toward the end of cooking time, so I will adjust that for the next batch..Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Flavor was good. Roasts in the slow cooker are always overcooked so I took it out an hour early. It wasn't tender at all.

Great recipe! Followed recipe exactly, and my husband said this was the best roast he has ever had. Love that I didn't have to look at any other comments. Just simply a great recipe, perfect as is.

This recipe was delicious! I made mine with boneless chuck roast. I didn't have fresh rosemary or thyme so I used dried ones, but it still turned out great! Will definitely try again and again!

This was the best roast ever and it was so easy to make. I did add a splash of red wine to the onion mixture before adding to crock pot. Will add this to our regular rotation recipes and pass it along to my family!! Excellent!!! Thanks Chef John

I loved this recipe. I will, however, have all measured ingredients ready before starting to sear the meat.  This is definitely a 'keeper'.

I did make a few adjustments. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste because I didn't have any, I omitted the mushrooms, used 1/2tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp dried thyme, and used a 2.5lb roast (kept the rest of the ingredients the same). 
ALSO, I added potatoes at the end like a review said and my potatoes weren't done. I would suggest putting them in half way through or even at the beginning on the side of the roast submerged in the juices. I used red skinned potatoes and cut them into about 1-2 inch cubes. Really good flavor!

I have tried this recipe and it's good, but I think it's even better cooked covered in the regular oven at 275 degrees over time.  I also left out the tomato paste and used beef broth instead.  I also sear the meat very dark, only saute onions, garlic and mushrooms quickly in the pan with some butter and then pour over the roast.  Add more raw onions and mushrooms and cover.  275 degrees for at least 3 hours.  Test meat so that it slices, but doesnt fall apart.  You can also add a large can of Cream of Mushroom Soup about an hour before it's done and wisk it into the juice.  Cover again and when it's done the gravy will be thick, creamy and delicious.

I've never liked pot roast until this wonderful recipe came across my path. Everyone raves about it. Some may bulk at the "extra" work in prepping the roast before slow cooking but it is essential to obtaining that amazing and full flavor. I am so thankful I gave pot roast a chance again AND that this was the recipe that I found to make it with! Thanks Chef John!!!! PS...the only change I made was using Italian Seasoning instead of Rosemary since I didn't have any.

Prep time for me was longer than 20 minutes. Cooked this on low for 8-9 hours. Came out very good. My kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds. I'll make this again.

I chose this recipe because it had no processed foods (canned soup, etc.), and oh my am I glad I did!  This has to be the tastiest pot roast I have ever tried.  The only things I did differently were: 1) I used 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary and thyme added along with the onions rather than fresh; and, 2) used Vegetable Better-than-Bouillon because this is what I had on hand.
Next time I would love to try this with baby 'bello mushrooms rather than the standard white!

This is a really nice way to make pot roast.  I used a 2.8 lb chuck roast and added some potatoes to the top of the pile.  Rosemary and her friend Thyme missed the party, I'm afraid.  They were victims of laziness to go to the store to get them.  However, the roast was pull-apart tender in 5 hours and was still very tasty.  While time-consuming in the preparation, the results were worth the time spent in the kitchen.  Another great recipe, Chef John!

YUMMY! Made this pretty much as written except forgot to buy the mushrooms. It was still delicious, although I'll remember to put them in next time since we like mushrooms. I also followed one reviewer's suggestion to add potatoes (red ones quartered) for the last 45 mins. So glad I did. There was lots of liquid to go with the meat (which was fork tender) and vegetables (cooked just right). I did add a little sprinkle of salt to my serving, but that's just my taste. Thanks for the recipe.

OMG-delicious!  It takes slow-cooker roast to a new high!  Followed recipe to a tee, only  I needed to use up portabello mushrooms which I bought at our local Farmers Market, and I added 3/4 cup of Blushing Pink wine from our local winery and reduced that much from the chicken broth.  The family says it's a keeper!

Excelllent pot roast. I have tried differnent slow cooker versions and by far is the BEST!!!! The only addition I did was double the mushrooms and onion.  I also made extra mushroom gravy on the side.
Thank you Chef John

This recipe was great! Although my family loves pot roast, I normally find it a little boring. Adding the mushrooms and cooking for several hours made it both tender and very flavorful. I made two tweaks: I left out the tomato paste (I'm allergic);it was great without it. I also added some fresh sage to the herbs.  I will use this again!

This was awesome! The meat was fork tender and as a pot roast it stood out with the rosemary and thyme.  It made the house smell good all day and I'll use it any time of the year for sure. Chef John is inspriring as he makes all his recipes seem so easy.

I've made this recipes about 5 times. It's not only cheap to make but so easy. I change the tomato paste when i don't have it and i use tomato sauce and it still comes out tasty. I love it and I really do think people who are lazy to cook a whole meal or is busy that day should truly give this recipe a try.

This was a delicious slow cooker meal!  I used a 7-bone roast as the Cook's Note suggests.  The only change I made was using dried herbs instead of fresh. Everything was so flavorful that I can't imagine using fresh herbs would make a big difference.  I loved how all of the veggies absorbed the rich flavors of the gravy.  I served the roast with mashed potatoes--delicious!

DON'T CHANGE A THING. I have been making roast beef for 45 years. This is by far the best. Could not find a good bone roast so went without. Tastes fantastic.

I have been looking for the perfect roast recipe and this is it! I used a three pound rump and did add red wine at the time of the broth. SO good!!

Over the years, I have made this recipe many times for friends and always: "it's the best pot roast I've ever had"! A few changes I have kept: double the mushrooms, garlic, and tomato paste; added bay leaf to the court bouillon (rosemary, thyme in cheesecloth); add quartered potatoes at 2.5 hours left. Of course, I made it the original recipe and it is impressive!! Today, I am on Keto diet so I cut down on the tomato paste, no potatoes and replaced with almond flour. So far, it worked great as a thickening agent on the mushroom mixture. We will see

This was amazing. I, too, was apprehensive about the recipe as some items seemed to not fit. BUT, sometimes you just have to trust the recipe. And it did not disappoint. I left out the oil and butter, not needed, extra fat for no reason. My only complaint is that I used a 3lb boneless and should have used 2 as I had originally planned, as there were no leftovers!  That just means I get to make it again! Yum.

I really love this pot roast recipe!!  I always follow it exactly with the exception that I use dry herbs to keep costs down.  This recipe builds layers of flavor.  I also think serving the roast over mashed potatoes is brilliant!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it is a staple in our house now!

I followed the receipt to a tee, but it tasted extremely bland. One package of dry onion soup mix improved it dramatically.

I found the cooking time insufficient for the meat to become tender.  I suggest cooking on high for 8-9 hours.  Also, the meat is bland.  My recipe tweaks include marinating in red wine over night.  I also add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard,  1 cup of red wine, beef broth instead of chicken broth, and 1-2 chicken bouillon cubes.

I do mine in the same Dutch Oven I use to sear the roast and then put into the oven at 250*f. for 4 hours or even longer. I do have 2 quibbles with his recipe however: 1) I normally use a 50/50 ratio of beef broth & a good dry red wine and 2) In those circumstances dried herbs will work at least as well and be far less expensive too.

I made this recipe on a busy day due to its simplicity and I was not disappointed.  I used a 3.5 lb roast.  I added a few potatoes to add some bulk to the meal.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of broth to help steam the potatoes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the result was excellent.  My entire family enjoyed the recipe and I immediately added it to my "favorites" list.  You could add more spices if you wish to make it five star worthy, but this recipe certainly provides a strong foundation for a quick, hearty, and flavorful meal.

I used potatoes but make sure you put them on the top of the roast, otherwise they'll get soggy and almost nonexistent after being cooked for for 5 hours.

I made this meal for my picky family of 5 including 2 10 year olds and a 13 year old. It  was a huge hit!!! Very flavorful and moist. I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of using beef broth instead of chicken broth which added to the delicious flavor. I served it over a bed of wide egg noodles.   Thank you for this amazing recipe. I will definitely be making it again.

I was expecting great things from this recipe due to the rave reviews. I made it as a special meal for my husband when he returned from a business trip. I was disappointed. While this recipe was okay, it wasn't amazing. Yes, the meat was tender, but flavor was lacking.  The only change I made was using beef broth instead of chicken broth (based upon comments) and a smaller sized roast (2 lbs). I have made better pot roasts than the one from this recipe.  And, everyone knows to brown the meat before adding to the crock pot for added flavor.  The gravy was too thin to serve over egg noodles. It really needed potatoes. I have a good palate and this was only okay.

Great recipe. I used a 5 pound chuck roast and seared on "all" sides. I used a 6.5 qt slow cooker. If using less than a 6 qt slow cooker you might want to use a smaller roast as 5 lb is perfect for a 6 qt. 

I altered the recipe by adding twice the amount of carrots and celery. I also added more mushrooms. I added a bag of baby red potatoes (with the skin on) for the full duration.  I used beef broth instead of chicken broth ( 1 and  34 cup beef broth + 34 cup red wine is the most ideal). 

I did not add flour to the sauce as the recipe calls for, i only added the initial flour to the roast before searing.

Very important, cook on LOW for 8 - 9 hours, not on high for 6 hours. 8 - 9 hours on low will give you a very tender juicy roast, high for 6 hours will give you a dry and tough roast.  

I have made this recipe a few times with minor tweeks and the above is the best way imo.

I added some red wine, and made a gravy at the end.  My husband LOVED this!

Second time: I followed the recipe to the T, except for using dried herbs in place of fresh.  Wonderful!  We ate it over mashed potatoes.

This was my first attempt at pot roast. I followed the recipe exactly (although I doubled the amount of mushrooms because I had too many!) and after 6 hours in my slow cooker, the roast and accompanying sauce was out of this world. I served it with roast root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, parsnips and and onions). A perfect home-cooked meal.

I use a smaller piece of meat(small family), and substitute beer for the chicken broth. If you don't have a crockpot, put it in the oven in the morning, between 200 and 250 degrees. It'll be ready for supper. You can be adventurous with the vegetables: whatever you put in will taste good.

Wonderful Recipe! The only thing I did different was I used Garlic Salt vs salt and also instead of 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth I used 2 cups and 1/2 cup of sherry.

OOH, this was delicious!  I made it today, and followed the directions.  I used a 5 lb pot roast, the butcher cut it for me, since it was so large.  I did sear it for 5 mins on each side...using lots of paprika, salt and pepper.  I used 2 cups of chicken stock, adding another 1/2 cup of water.  I served 8 people with left overs.  I cut the roast across the grain after cooking it on high in my crock pot for 6 hours.  I put the slices back in the crock pot juices before my company arrived so it was hot and juicy.  Served with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies.  wow. Follow the receipe and you will be glad you did!  Yummy!!  Oh, I used dried herbs, it was fine!

Took a little more time than other 'crock pot' recipes, but this is worth it. Makes an excellent juice/sauce. The only thing I changed was I did not have fresh rosemary and thyme is I used crushed. Hit with the whole family

I used a smaller, boneless roast, also used coconut flour instead of AP flour to make it Paleo and Gluten Free. This was DELICIOUS. Chef John always brings it!

WOW!!  I used a chuck roast and followed recipe except for mushrooms which 2 out of 4 of us don't like but sorry didn't add and they could just pick them out!  Only thing I did was rub some "Gravy Master" on the meat before browning it - my Mother taught me that one.  I was thinking about not using chicken broth since I always use beef broth but I did and glad.  I think Chef John knows what he's doing!  Oh man I just thought about it - forgot the herbs!! but was just awesome and didn't miss a thing.  Great recipe - meat just fell apart - works for me!

5/9/2014: Very pleased with this recipe. The whole family loved it, and I loved that it was flavorful without being excessively salty. Finally, an excellent slow cooker recipe without a packaged mix or cream-of-something soup!

11/2/2019: Amazing with venison instead of beef! 

12/27/2019: Would like to add that the pre-crockpot prep (chopping, searing, cooking down the mushrooms, etc.) takes me a full hour. I make this a few times a year and have found it company-worthy, but too much work to be on the menu very often.

Have made it once following the recipe to the letter. I'll give it 9/10 stars, so it gets a "5" since we're rounding up. Family thought is was good, but didn't rave over it so let's say they give it 7 or 8 of 10.

Personally, I like the leftovers...

I love this recipe!!! I make it at least twice a month and it's makes too much for my fiancé and I so I usually freeze half. So we end up actually having it 4 times a month!! I serve mine over white rice and add more carrots and celery because I like a lot. I also add little potatos. I don't like rosemary or thyme so I've never had it with this but after a few takes I noticed it needs to be seasoned a lot with salt and pepper. Overall it's an amazing recipe and a must try for all!!

Excellent recipe on its own or as a starting point for modification. I chose an extremely lean beef pot roast and ended up needing more broth as it cooked. I also added potatoes. What ended up coming out was pot roast with a touch of stew-like quality. Definitely an amazing meal for a cold rainy day.

This was very good.  Followed the recipe other than only using one 14.5 oz can of chicken broth instead of 2.5 cups and also only had dry rosemary and thyme on hand.  I used a boneless roast instead of the bone-in.

This IS my new beef pot roast recipe!  I think it's the juxtaposition between the beef and the chicken broth that makes the big difference.  I've made this several times, get raves from all.  Only thing I do differently is use Italian Seasoning dry herb mix in lieu of those specified, and omit the mushrooms--simply because I use what I have in my pantry/fridge at the time.  I've added red wine to the last few versions, and it was delish!  I added a couple potatoes to some versions to thicken it more.  Mainly, I steam the potatoes and more carrots just before dinner, and add to pot roast just before serving.  Great recipe!  Great meal!

I made this for my fiance and his parents last night because his mother, who is going through chemotherapy, is having a hard time finding foods that taste normal to her and that she has an appetite for, and everyone loved it including her, and she ate every bit and even woke up in the middle of the night for seconds, thanks for sharing, I will for sure be making this again =)

This recipe is by far the best pot roast we have ever had!  Even my 11 & 13 yr. old raved about it. I didn't have fresh rosemary or thyme, so I added about 1 tsp. of each to the roast and it was delicious! I made garlic mashed potatoes to go with it and it topped it off perfectly. Well done, Chef John!

Chef John is amazing.  This recipe was very good.  My husband, however, had purchased a bottom roast (ugh) -- not a chuck roast -- (cue: ridiculous argument about receipes and meat) -- so, anyway. . . I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but, it came out better than I thought.  I did cook it on slow, though.  Once you get all the ingredients in the slow cooker, the gravy smell [while cooking] is literally intoxicating. Plus, I love this recipe because it doesn't use any dry soup mix, and the mushrooms, really, the mushrooms, add such a savory taste.  I would even add more mushrooms next time.   Absolutely delicious.  Also, I used dried thyme and dried rosemary, I eyeballed those to about 1 - 1.5 teas each, respectively. And, I thought my prep time was more than 20 minutes, but again, I had to sear all sides of the bottom roast.   I will say, do yourself a favor and get a fresh loaf of french crusty bread b/c believe me, you will want to soak up as much of this gravy as possible.

I would like to thank the chef that submitted this pot roast recipe.  I really appreciate recipes that use fresh, basic ingredients.  I don't want to use canned soups, dried soups and other processed foods in my food that contain wayyy too much sodium.  This was absolutely delicious.  Thank-You Chef John!

Best pot roast I ever made. I used boneless chuck. It was small (under 2 lbs) and it was done in under 5 hours. Kept the onions big to match the size of the carrots and celery which I left in big chunks.  Great recipe, thanks!!!!

Wow, this was fabulous and the best slow cooker roast I've made in 20 years. I don't usually brown mine because then  I might as well just braise it on the stove top and get the same results rather than dirtying two pots. Jaime Oliver wrote for his scrumptious Jool's favourite stew, that he's done it with and without browning and the latter came out better. When using the crock pot,  Iusually do mine on low for 6-8 hours, but it seemed it did much better on high.  Next time I'll add sweet potatoes and maybe butternut squash during the last hour.  Testing continues.....

I make slow cooker pot roast frequently but thought I would try this recipe for a little different twist...delicious! I used sliced baby portabella mushrooms which add flavor (I don't usually use mushrooms). Will make again.

What an Awesome recipe! I did use a Venison Roast in place of the Beef pot roast. To be honest, had a friend over for supper and he did not know that it was a Venison Roast! I did follow another person suggestion by using a cup of Wine (Sangria only type on hand)and then use 1/2 cup beef broth plus did not have flour on hand, so I put a cream of mushroom soup in w/the onion, mushroom & wine mixture. Let it simmer for maybe 5-10 mins. If I could give it a 10 I would.

Delicious. I used a 2.5 pound roast, and it was done in just a few hours on High. Didn't have fresh thyme or rosemary, so I used about a tsp dried of each. Once done, pour the liquid into a fat separator to make a nice gravy.

Fabulous!  This turned out nice and tender and very flavorful; I served it at Christmas dinner and got lots of compliments.  It was well worth the extra 30 minutes or so up front to sear the meat and saute the mushrooms and onions before popping it all in the crock pot.

Loved this. I was too generous w/tomato paste. Needs more carrots & onions. Don't break up the meat in pot, it will be tender. Needed a bit more corn starch for thickening. Use half chicken & half beef broth.

Wow!  What a hit!  This recipe made an amazing meat n' potatoes meal for my meat n' potatoes husband.  I only had a small can of mushrooms on hand, so that's what I used.  Using fresh would have made a huge difference in my opinion.  My husband can't stand mushrooms, but he ate every bite on his plate and said it was the most outstanding roast he'd ever had.  I made good ole mashed potatoes.  I didn't have any tomato paste on hand, so I used about 1/4 cup V-8 juice.  My only disappointment was my chuck arm  roast was only 1.75 lbs., so not leftovers.  I will definitely make this again!!

Fantastic recipe.  The flavor of the meat with the preparation and the mushroom gravy is outstanding.  I made two changes to the recipe.  Used beef broth instead of chicken since I had it and added a cup of red wine to the gravy.  Also took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and served it over egg noodles.  YUMMY!

I had stew meat I was looking to use and replaced the 5 lb roast with 1 lb of stew meat.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.   I served it over mashed potatoes and my daughter couldn't get enough of it.  It was awesome!

This recipe is very tasty! Searing the meat before you put into crock pot really adds a lot of flavor and so does the chicken stock. I would not change anything about the recipe, except maybe to double it because there were no leftovers!!

I am a transplanted Brit and have tried making the All-American Pot Roast several times but never been pleased with the result. Then I made Chef John's recipe. Wow! It was awesome. I had a 3lb chuck roast and cooked it for 8 hours on low. It was perfect. I substituted 1 cup of red wine for 1 cup of the  beef broth but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband, also a Brit, pronounced it utterly delicious! I will make it again for  the family.

This was my first time making a pot roast, and it turned out wonderfully! I did have to search for an actual cut of meat, since 'pot roast' is not a cut. I used a 4lb chuck roast and it worked perfectly! Skipped the celery because I can't stand it, but there was still plenty of flavor from everything else. Mashed potatoes and green beans on the side made for a perfect, warm, family dinner. Thank you!

I seared it my insta pot t other then that kept the recipe the same.  Tasted great.  Wife freaked at the price of the beef but all the stuff + salad and rice, came out to cost under $10.00 per plate.  Would have cost me more then that to eat out for four.

This recipe had great flavor. I read through many reviews and made a couple of changes. Instead of using 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth, I used 2 cups of beef broth and 1/2 of red wine. I also added a tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce. My roast came out a little dry and chewy, in some spots, but it wasn’t so bad. I think my slow cooker heats differently, as I’ve had the same issue with other recipes. I always cook for the amount of time it states. I will definitely be making again, however, will cook for maybe 4 hours on low next time.

Right off the bat, I want to offer a very important criticism! If you cook it on high, then you run the risk of having very dry meat.  
>
Since I have moved to Norway and they don't write beef names in English, I didn't know what to look for, and my son, who speaks Norwegian and English, looked it up, but still couldn't find a chuck roast, so we settled on what they called Entrecôte. That worked rather well for us! 
>
I also added 6 small white potatoes, and since this was so close to another recipe, which used red wine, we tried it Chef John's way first, and then we added the red wine and tried a little of that too.  We broke off a small chunk of meat with each tasting and served it over mashed potatoes, saving the chopped potatoes and vegetables for making beef stew, which is basically the same recipe as Chef John's + the red wine, except that you break the meat into bite-sized pieces and add flour water to it at the end to make a nice gravy. 
>
Chef John is right: Searing the meat does trap in all the juicy flavor and frying all the vegetables does make it taste better. I would recommend frying them in a wok for even better taste. There's something about woks that make everything taste so much better! 
>
In the end, after I broke the meat down into bite-sized chunks, I added some flour water using 2 tablespo

Delicious! I used 1/4 cup red wine and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce to deglaze meat searing pan. Into the crock pot crock pot I added an envelope of onion soup and 1/2 cup black coffee.

Very good. Used a smaller roast for the two of us, still have some left over. Did not serve with potatoes, watching our carbs. Will use this recipe again.

I actually liked this recipe. Made some minor changes based on other reviews, used beef stock and put some worcestershire sauce. Next time I would use a little bit more butter and cook in low for a few hours then high. Definitely making this again :)

I served it as a main dish for my New Year's dinner with friends. They loved it! It's also a fun recipe to make. I enjoyed the video and learned good tips. The reviews from others were very useful, too. My only changes were adjusting the servings to 10 (it all fit well in the slow cooker) and replacing one cup of the chicken broth with red wine.  It came out great and my friends appreciated.  Also,  I was generous with the kosher salt I used to marinate the meat so I did not have to add additional salt or pepper once it was done, as suggested, but this is a personal preference.

I served with baked rosemary potatoes, green beans, salad, fresh bread and a nice cup of cabernet.

I substituted dried Italian seasoning instead of fresh herbs  and dried garlic powder instead of fresh. Couldn’t find the recommended cut of meat so used 5lbs of beef chuck roast. It turned out flavorful and moist. The family raved about it MIL asked for recipe!

I really would rate this a 4.5 as is. What Really made this end up being 5 quality was the suggestions by other reviewers, which I incorporated.
1. Instead of 2 cups chicken broth, I used 1 cup beef broth, and 1 cup red wine ( both were added slowly and reduced in the mushroom sauce).
2. I learned to do roasts low & slow. It'll be good on high, but I cooked mine on Low for 8 hours, and it Really makes a difference on tenderness (I also used a boneless chuck roast).
*Searing the meat like the directions say is definitely a step you don't want to skip, either*
If your roast is smaller (mine was 2.5 pounds or so), it's ok. still do the same amount of mushroom sauce. You'll be grateful. 
for my veggies I used butternut squash and brussel sprouts (get fresh for both), and I made a potato leek soup to go with this. Deee-lish!

This meal was very tender and stress-free. I used cream of mushrooms instead of chicken stock and removed the mushrooms from the list. It didn't make sense to me to use chicken stock in a beef dish, but using the cream of's... allows the dish to be thicker to start with. I cut off all fat from my roast first starting with a lean cut of beef not the 7-bone roast. So there was no grease to remove from dish. Now I know why so many use a slow-cooker. I will make this again but next time with more carrots and by adding fresh green beans and potatoes.

I have made this pot roast several times mostly with chuck roast.I generally cannot get the 7-bone with bone on.  It is always delicious! I have served this to my family of 4 and to several other families with success.

The only changes I make are:  (1)  I sautée or sear in the order it goes in the pot -- carrots & celery, roast, mushroom/onion mixture; (2)  I switch to low heat after 2-3 hours and take the roast out when it falls apart  in nice big chunks, rather than small bits; (3) I add a bit more tomato paste and 1/2 cup less chicken broth for a more robust sauce.

I used a chuck roast and pan seared it in cast iron that had some bacon fat in it. The only other change was that I used a 14 oz can of beef broth. This was the most amazing pot roast we have ever eaten! Will definitely make again, but I will double the amount of carrots next time, as we love them!

Delicious! I will absolutely make this again. I did have to make changes since my family doesn't like celery, which I omitted. (I just cooked the meat on top of a large roughly chopped bag of whole carrots that I had lining the pot) I had canned mushrooms on hand and they were fine mixed with the onions (I minced them so that my picky non- mushroom eating family had no clue they were eating them) . I also used 1 tsp of ground cloves, dry Italian herbs and thyme, a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce and then I added about 3-4 large peeled potatoes, each cut into 3-4 large pieces about 30 min. before the roast was finished cooking. I only had a 2 pound boneless chuck roast and it was the most tender, flavorful roast ever. The next time I make this, I will definitely cook a larger roast because everyone loved it so much that we ended up with absolutely no leftovers. ** I usually do not make alterations to the recipes I try but I was anxious to try this, especially since we had a sudden cold front, and decided to just do the best I could with what I had on hand and it was TRULY DELICIOUS and incredibly easy! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Delicious!  Made this just as the recipe stated...without measuring a few of the ingredients.  My children and husband all loved it! (Even my child who hesitates eating meat!)

I made rice and had leftover mashed sweet potato.  I ended up adding mashed sweet potato to each plate as well, which offered a nice sweetness to the overall dish that everyone enjoyed.  So much so, I would make sure I have sweet potato on hand for future meals as well! 

Will definitely make again, thank you!

I omitted the butter, mushrooms and tomato paste. I added 1 packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the chicken broth in the pan and used 4 cloves of garlic. I bought 2 bags of frozen stew mix that had celery, onion, potatoes and carrots. Took the onion out and cooked it how he had it. Cooked low  for 10 hours using a 4 lbs English roast with bone. Next time I will add another 4 carrots and more potatoes. Used home made chicken stock.

From now on, all my searches will start with Chef John's....

Let me start off by saying that I don't normally like pot roast because it seems to lack any depth of flavor. Used about 1c beef broth instead of chicken, crushed tomatoes instead of paste and dried spices instead of fresh because that is what I had. Also substituted Monterey  seasoning for pepper. Will use the paste next time. The best part was using the leftover meat in a beef stroganoff recipie! (Rich and Creamy Beef Stroganoff from this site).

I've tried many pot roast recipes and this one is by far the best! I refuse to use cream of anything soup or Lipton onion soup mix. I used fresh herbs from my garden (doubled the amt) beef broth bc that's all I had on hand and added red potatoes. Leftovers were even better! This will be the only pot roast recipe I will use.

Quoting my darling husband, OUT OF THIS WORLD"!!!!!  He also said, "This is the most tender pot roast you've EVER made!"  And I've been married 25 years; so I've made A LOT of pot roasts!!  I followed the recipe to a tee, EXCEPT I used a boneless roast AND instead of  2-1/2 cups of chicken broth, I used 1-1/2 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of red wine!!!  Exceptionally DELICIOUS!!!!

For all who were complaining that it lacks salt (and/or seasoning, which, in case you don't know, may be greatly enhanced by an extra pinch or two of salt) please note that it tells you at the bottom of the recipe to ADD SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE!! One person's salt /seasoning preference is not the same as the next person's, and the suggested amounts are just that-suggestions. Any experienced cook knows this and will expect to tweak cooking recipes to their personal preferences. This includes other "optional" ingredients, like mushrooms, celery, etc. If you don't like it, don't put it in, but please don't bother putting it into your review or complaining that you don't like it. You're only exposing your finickiness. I've not actually made this recipe, but it's very similar to recipes? I've tossed together that were delicious. My personal opinion is that those of you who are switching out chicken broth for beef are compromising the flavor. Some of my most outstanding dishes that have garnered the most compliments have included chicken/beef combinations. The two flavors complement each other. However, if you really prefer all beef, go ahead! But please don't bash the poor person who dared to think outside of the box and combine chicken broth with beef! :) I think all would do well to remember that in reviews, the most helpful ones are those that stick to the cooking time, consistency/texture of the food, etc. because taste, after all, is highly debatable.

It's a standard pot roast recipe ... as a side note, I really don't understand the attraction of slow cookers... IMO there isn't anything I have cooked in a slow cooker that doesn't come out better in a dutch oven or even a 5 qt chicken fryer.

I have made this with many cuts of beef and they all turned out perfectly. The only substitution I make is beef stock for chicken stock. Last week I varied by using a 4 pound prime rib roast cooked on low to 135° internal temp........fantastic!
Don't skip the sear at the first....very important to the flavor.

It was pretty tasteless.  The only change I made was Beef broth in place of chicken and it was low salt beef broth.  I'm nervous to try it again.

Dueling pot roasts. I made 2 roasts simultaneously with this recipe. One in slow cooker and one in Dutch oven. Followed recipe except I used 2 smaller roasts (2.5lbs because my slow cooker is small....thus the 2nd roast in the oven). I had no tomato paste, so in slow cooker I used some tomato sauce. Both were great. The slow cooker was slightly better. I think because the meat was more fatty. Will definitely make again!

This was my first time ever making Pot Roast so I can't necessarily compare to other recipes, but I must say it turned out super delicious. 
I couldn't find fresh herbs so I used dry, and based on another's review I used a half of cup of red wine to help bring out the flavors from the dry herbs and I think it did the job.
Great Recipe overall, and definitely something I will make again as a holiday favorite.

My entire family loved this!  It really is very good.  My husband is THE cook in our house, but even he said it's better than his.  The only changes I made were: adding dried rosemary & thyme to the salt and pepper when I rubbed it in,  and using beef broth instead of chicken broth.  Definitely a keeper.

Delish! Used chuck roast & doubled up on the mushrooms & added baby new potatoes. Seasoned all layers when cooking. I thought the fresh thyme and rosemary were a fantastic addition. Will make again, soon! Fantastic!

Ok I know people are annoyed when you change the recipe but in my defense I didn't have any mushrooms and nobody in my family is a mushroom fan. I made this otherwise using the same ingredients as the recipe called for and it was YUMMY, YUMMY, YUM.
Another confession- I happened to have an eye round not a 7 bone roast, and I didn't have 6 hours, so I made it on the stove-top in 2 hours. 
BUT IT WAS GRRRRRRREAT!

This was SOOO good! I had an English roast so trimmed the fat off before using it. Left out mushrooms and added rutabaga and potatoes instead (next time I will use one or the other as they taste similar).  Used several tablespoons of V8 instead of tomato paste. Took other's suggestion to add a bit less broth and make up the difference with sherry cooking wine (2.5 c beef broth-- not chicken-- and 1/2 c wine). Next time instead of sautéed onion, I will sautee the celery and garlic and add 1 or 2 onions cut into chunks to cook with the other veggies. Cooked on high five hours, it was super tender.  Thank you Chef John!  Hub said to give this one 5 stars!

3.13 pound boneless roast (for 2 people with leftovers) and seared it until almost burnt on both sides, ie got nice dark coloring and a nice crust on the roast. Only additions/changes I did were: I quartered Yukon Gold potatoes (like 6-8 potatoes) and put them in with the celery and carrots at the bottom of the pot. I put the roast right from the searing pan into the crock pot on top of the veggies and let it rest in there instead. I used Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth and got a great rich flavor and I added 1 Tablespoon Low Sodium Worcestershire to the mushroom/onion/broth mixture and let simmer before I poured over the meat.

I made this recipe as-is with the slight exception of adding chunks of potatoes in with the carrots. Cooked on high in the slow cooker and was good to go in about 4.5 hours as I used a 3.5 lb cut of meat. This dish had a wonderful, unique flavor that will certainly be enjoyed in this home again and again. Thank you, Chef John!

I have made several variations of pot roast and this one finally got my wife's approval. Her major complaint was always that they were too dry. I really think the bone in roast is what made the difference. It is virtually impossible to find a bone in (7 bone) roast where I live. I actually had to have it special ordered. The butcher said that people don't like to pay for the bone but agreed with me that the bone is what makes it so good and actually there really isn't that much bone anyway. The only thing I did is used dry rosemary and thyme instead of fresh and after 3 hours, it was bubbling so much that I turned it to low and cycled between low and high hourly for a total time of 7 hours. I will never do a roast any other way after this! Thumbs up Chef John!

Due to time constraints, I cooked the roast in a dutch oven on top or the stove. Additionally, I omitted the tomato paste and added basil to the seasonings. Fantastic roast, my husband's favorite beef roast. Have made this several times and comes out flavorful, juicy, melt in your mouth roast.

Used a little Montreal Steak Seasoning on roast before dredging it in lots of flour before browning it very well.  Used beef broth instead of chicken broth. Put a few potatoes cut in thirds in crock pot about half way through cooking time.  Used a package of gravy mix towards the end to season up and thicken the liquid.  Was a hit at my house!

I loved it! I cut the recipe in half and added some red potatoes on the bottom with the carrots and celery. I also added some extra chicken broth once I put the boneless 2lb chuck roast in the crock pot in order to make sure I had enough liquid. I cooked on low around 7-8 hours. The roast came out so extremely tender! I will make this again! My family loved it. Thanks to the chef that shared this recipe!

Ohh My Goodness!?!?! Soo amazing!! The only difference i made was boneless meat, added chicken bullion cube to broth, added 1 1/2 tablespoons more salt to broth, and smashed (not mixed)  my mashed potatoes with milk, sour cream, butter, salt, and pepper and i had a winner with the  whole family!!

I used a 2.5 lb. shoulder pot roast because we are only two, but kept all other ingredients the same as we like extra veggies and sauce.  I subbed 1/2 t. each of dried rosemary and thyme for the fresh and used beef boullion instead of chicken ~ why wouldn't you??  Since I was out of flour, I thickened with cornstarch at the end, which worked out fine but nothing I did compromised the original recipe.  It was delicious!!!  Served over baked potatoes since my husband didn't buy mashers and I liked it with a dollop of sour cream but next time I would probably put potatoes in the crock pot, as I usually do when I make pot roast.   My husband and I are looking forward to having the leftovers for dinner in a night or two, I wouldn't be surprised if it's even better!

Great recipe! I omitted mushrooms, turned out great. Had to thicken the gravy afterward. Red wine in this recipe would be great! I'll try that next time!

I've made this a handful of times now, it's been exceptional everytime. I'm actually making another as I type this. He only thing different is I add quartered red potatoes in the last half hour of cooking.  They are cooked thru before adding but only enough so that the skins are still firm and slightly crunchy.

Great! My roast was 3 lbs, I was out of Tomato paste, mushrooms & chicken broth, I used Tomato sauce about 5 tablespoons & Campbells beef consume diluted some, tasting as I went along, really good taste. I added the baby carrots at the bottom of the crockpot, meat & sauce. After 2 hrs or so added peeled potatoes. Made gravy with the sauce using cornstarch.
Next time will use the chicken broth and I'm going to try the Golden Mushroom broth/soup also.

I've been cooking pot roast for years. My recipe when I was working. Laughed at Chef's comment. Throwing everything in the slow cooker and let it cook, "well that just.. stupid." Though it always worked and was good, this recipe is delicious. It is more time consuming but worth every savory morsal. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried. Next time fresh just to see the difference. Use a chuck roast since the store didn't have any bone in. Everything remained as written. My friend said he could smell it from the garage. Made homemade Mashed Red Potatoes & the gravy was full of flavor. It's a keeper for sure. Thanks Chef.

I love Roast Beef, my family loves Roast Beef I grew up eating home cooked Roast Beef 3-4 time every month sometimes even more often. I've eaten Roast Beef at many restaurants (I think you get the point I love a good roast). This is a fantastic Roast Beef recipe and even rivals my Granny's famous Roast Beef(we have over 50 people on that side of the family and they all love it). It is easy to prep and taste just fantastic. I love the added tomato paste and the chicken broth which he recommends. The juices of the meat add to the chicken flavor giving the gravy a lighter, but more dynamic flavor that is definitely worth a try. I do everything he recommend except I get what ever good quality chuck roast is available and it always comes out perfect. Good luck and enjoy. Thank You for the sharing this recipe.

This is sooooo delicious and quick and easy to prep I would recommend this to everyone. My husband loves this dish the meat and everything combined is so tender and tasty. The one thing is if you're not a fan of the herbs all over your dish you might want to put them in a cheese cloth. Otherwise I made it as the recipe called for.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  I followed all directions then added 1 cup of red wine - poured it over the roast in the slow cooker before turning it on.  Love this recipe and will be making it again for dinner tonight.

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband,who up to this point was not a pot roast lover, requests it all the time. Usually I will tweak recipes to suit our tastes but this one needs none at all. So good to finally have a beef recipe that does not require red wine and heavy beef stock. The video is great also. Thank you Chef John.

I have made this recipe twice and both times, it was wonderful. I like that it's made with fresh on hand ingredients and not prepackaged packets of dressing. Most of those are loaded with sodium and other artificial additives. The prep is simple and not that time consuming. Browning the meat with salt, pepper be flour is a must to seal in juices and provide a nice sear on the meat. Thank you Chef John for a wonderful basic pot roast recipe.

I discovered this recipe only 3 months ago but have already made it 4 times. In place of tomato paste I use ketchup and though the recipe doesn't call for it, I put a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce in with the mushroom sauce. Searing the meat really boosts the flavour and I love how it takes only 5 hours in the slow because it's partially cooked. I'm never organised enough to start mine in the morning.

I made this for the first time tonight. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to substitute the closest boneless equivalent for the bone-in beef since that's what my grocery store offered.  I wish I had added more salt and pepper to the dish when it was done, as the recipe suggests.   This will make good leftovers tomorrow night.

You can't lose on this recipe...seems every Chef John recipe I've tried comes out great! The Guy KNOWS how to cook, and more importantly, how to share his knowledge with others. 
My Roast was GREAT and my kids(twentysomethings) came over and it was the hit of the Sunday Night Dinner. And not hard to make either, the key is that browning before braising :) and a good long cook time, fork tender!, for next day leftovers at work that Knock Your Socks OFF!

SUCH an amazing recipe. My sister just had a baby and so I made this for her when she came home and she and her husband can't get enough! I made the recipe exactly as it is and every time I ask my sister if there's anything I can do for her, she always asks me to make this dish!

I made this today....yum!! I did use beef both instead of chicken and used 1/2 cup of Malbec in place of 1/2 cup broth. Instead of salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme I seasoned the meat with Uncle Chris Steak Seasoning.  All other ingredients remained the same, I did follow the directions. I used a 3 pound chuck shoulder cut of meat.

We made this last night, and it was ALMOST perfect! We used a end-round roast instead of the 7, and it's got so much juice in it I ended up skimming out the liquid and thickening it - so if you don't use the 7, I would add a bit less chicken stock so that you don't have to do the extra step (just wanted to let people know so that they can avoid my mistake :))

As I stated before, this is the BEST POT ROAST EVER!  The only things I changed were: put a bag in my crock for easy cleaning, couldn't find a 5 lber roast so I did 2.5 lb w/bone because I think the bone adds something special and good. Also a 2.5ish boneless. I like the flour idea during searing. After the loving in the crock on high for about 5 hrs, I skimmed the fat and held back some "crock broth"(1/4  cupish) let that cool and added about 2 TBLSP of flour and mixed. Then, added that to to simmering deliciousness for a gravy. Thanks Chef John for an another AMAZING recipe!

I absolutely loved this!   It was so easy, and came out even better than I thought. The meat was so tender, and the carrots were very flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly, and also served it with mashed potatoes.  Wouldn't change a thing!

We liked the taste of this roast.   But this is not a 'quick and easy' crockpot recipe. The preparations took me at least half an hour, maybe more.

I've made a lot of mediocre pot roasts over the years.  My family doesn't get excited about them.  This pot roast surprised my husband - "this is DELICIOUS," he announced, and my picky son ate his, too.  There is a trade off - what I like about slow-cooking is the idea that one can "throw everything in and forget it" - and this recipe is front loaded with a little time and effort.  The end result, though, is superior to other slow-cooker pot roasts and therefore worth it in my opinion. (Regarding variations - I did add some marsala wine while I cooked the mushrooms as they were becoming dry.  Other than that, no changes).

This recipe was great! Family loved it. I had to use dried seasonings. I used the petite carrots in the bag.  Browning the meat I think made a huge difference in the final product - I would not change a thing.

Best slow cooker pot roast I've ever made!  Followed the recipe to a tee, except used a 3 lb cross rib roast...kept all the other ingredients the same amount.  Searing the meat is essential to this recipe, as is using fresh, not dry rosemary and thyme.  The mushroom gravy is very flavorful.  I have a smaller oval shaped crock pot and the 3 lb roast was perfect.  Cooked on Low for 3 hours and High for 3 hours and the meat was tender and fall apart delicious.  Served it over rice pilaf and everyone loved it!

I love this pot roast. I tweeted it a little bit. I use beef broth instead of chicken broth, also added a beef gravy mix for a great tasting gravy. I would like to know if anyone has tried this in an Instant pot?

Recipe was easy to follow.  I didn't have any tomato paste.  So I used 2-3 tbsp of pizza sauce as substitute.  Also I couldn't find pot roast at the market so used beef round chunks.  Pretty tasty.  My preteen kids liked it too.

This turned out great. I didn't have mushrooms so I improvised. In order to make up for the missing mushroom flavor I added additional pepper paprika and little tabasco. It had a different flavor profile, but it was excellent. I can't wait to make it with the mushrooms, however I will definitely keep the Tabasco variation,because my family loved it!

This was totally delish.   I always had a problem with my beef being tough and stringy.   I just finished a bowl of the veggies and meat.   Like another user I put some potatoes in at the last hour cooking time.   Yummy.   It came out like a stew and the leftovers can be made into BBQ beef sandwiches.   I give this recipe five stars and thank you chef John for a delicious recipe.

Awesome flavor and simple recipe. Thanks John! I made sure to generously season the roast and gave it a dark searing on all sides before adding to the slow cooker. Used a bottom round roast. Added a bit more celery and a ton more carrots, cause the family loves them. Omitted the mushrooms. Served with garlic roasted potatoes and green beans. Just finished the little bit of leftovers for lunch today. Will surely make this one again! Delicious!

It was good. It was WAY too much work for a slow cooker recipe. I will likely try and make it again without doing all the simmering and sauteing called for in the recipe.

Great recipe. Followed the instructions and it came out great. I added new potatoes as well. Needed to add a little more salt after it was cooked.

Followed the recipe except I used beef boullion (Better Than Boullion brand) and Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning for the rub - the result was a fantastic meal :) . I should add that I used sirloin roast and plan on trying this recipe with chuck roast soon as it's on sale this week so stay tuned for another review :)

Very tasty! Next time, just before serving, I'll put most of the sauce in a pot on the stovetop and add flour to make gravy.  My sprigs of thyme and rosemary were very small (about 4 inches). I'll double the amount next time, or try dried herbs, as I'd like even more herb flavoring.

Fabulous!  I wanted to add more Italian flare to it so in the flour coating for the meat I added extra seasonings - italian seasoning, sage, McCormick tomato basil garlic & some basil.  I then cut my meat into 3 huge chunks, salt & peppered it and then dipped it in the flour to sear.  It smelled delish!

Another first-rate Chef John recipe.  My whole family loved this, as is usual with Chef John recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly, with careful attention to the techniques of preparation and order of adding the ingredients, as he mentions in the video.  I would have added a photo, but we ate it all before I thought of it.

Even my grandmother would be impressed.

This was very good.  Skipped the flour to make it GF and used a little coconut oil instead of veggie oil.  Also used dried herbs.  Made a flavorful, moist roast.  Will definitely make again.

10 stars if I could!  This is some of the most flavorful pot roast I've ever made!  Usually the family is dousing it in Lea and Perrins, but not this time...delicious!

The first time, I accidentally used a whole 4 oz can of tomato paste but it turned out great, so I did again this time with the same result.  I did double the carrots and celery and used dried thyme and rosemary.  My kids and husband love it!  I serve it over egg noodles and it's full meal!

First thing I cooked in my slow cooker.  I divided the recipe in half as my crock is quite small - maybe four quarts?  Anyway, it's cooking now, but I think it's going to be delicious!  Thanks Chef John!  Loved your prep tips too!  Cornelia

I made it for my family for Christmas yesterday and everyone loved it! I used a five pound boneless rump roast because that was all that was available at the store and it still turned out great. Instead of chicken broth i used a can of french onion soup with some beef broth and since i didnt have tomato paste (turns out the one i had i thought was good had expired lol) i used ketchup. i also put a few more carrots and celary in because the family likes veggies. The carrots are melt in your mouth soft and it was a super easy recipe. Great for christmas when you dont want to run back and forth from the kitchen too.

Delicious! I made this just as directed except probably more mushrooms and a little more onion than called for. 300° in the oven (covered in an oval roaster) for about 5 hours and it turned out great. I removed all the veggies and liquid and put in a pot with about ¼ cup heavy cream and 2 tbls flour brought to a boil and thickened up nicely. I shredded some of the beef and put it atop a small bed of egg noodles then topped with the thick sauce. Marvelous end result and well worth the effort. I have a lot more shredded meat leftover than sauce but I'll probably save that for something else. Oh and instead of chicken broth in the recipe I used vegetable broth. As a small note, this did not end up with a celery flavor which was a plus for me since I'm not a big fan of celery.

I don't know why I bothered looking at the one 3 star review I saw saying that chuck roast comes out too fatty... I used 7-bone pot roast just like the recipe said and it turned out perfect. Flour and all. This recipe is amazing. I love using my slow cooker... its so easy and so tasty! Chef John's recipes have never failed me. If only he had more slow cooker recipes.

This was a big hit! I used my dutch oven to sear it for five minutes each side and put in the oven. I used half chicken broth and half sweet vermouth which made a very good gravy. The meat was tender and moist. I am doing this recipe again tonight only I will try it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.

Roast was great! Our family likes the oniony/brown gravy type to go with it better than this juicy sauce. I realized I could have thrown some corn starch or flour to thicken but just didn't that day. Put some potatoes in on the top of roast for the last hour. Overall very good.

This is the BEST pot roast I have ever cooked. I followed the recipe exactly as posted and the meat just fell off the bones.  I served the roast over bowls of mashed potatoes along with some crusty rolls for dipping in the gravy.  Delicious.

This was really good. I made this a couple of weeks ago. BF really liked it and said that it was very tasty and a keeper. I just wish I would have doubled the veggies and that the gravy was thicker. But not bad the first time around. I will make this again.

This was excellent - of course, it's from Chef John!  I doubled everything except the roast - only had a 2.5# boneless chuck.  I also added 4 large peeled russet potatoes.  Everything tasted excellent - I guess the tomato paste & chicken broth make the difference.  I did do the long sear on the meat & really sautéed the onion & mushrooms well. Rave reviews from myself & dinner guest!  Thanks CJ - you're great! I've never failed to love a recipe from you!

I was really excited to try this recipe due to the ingredients and the "5" stars.  Unfortunately, it didn't give me what I was looking for.  It lacked flavor, in my opinion.  It was just so-so.

Husband loved this. Only things i did different was use an equal ratio of beef broth and red wine in place of the chicken stock as suggested by a reviewer and i dried herbs. Hubby said I can't make pot roast any other way after this. Thanks Chef John

1 word: Delicious! I haven't done it with a BEEF roast, but I sure have done it a lot with VENISON roast. My husband hates mushrooms so instead of sliced, I would chopped them up really small or avoid them altogether.  The only other change I made was using baby carrots instead of regular carrots.  I use more veggies whenever possible to encourage my husband to eat more of them.  The sauce thickens nicely in the slow cooker so I didn't have to thicken it later.  Made it a lot in the past year (at least once a month) and will be making it again tomorrow (venison neck roast).  Can't wait!

Changes to the recipe: 3.75 lb pot roast (well marbled purchased from Costco), 2 onions, 1 14oz can of chicken broth, 1/2 14oz can of beef broth, .75lb of cremini mushrooms, 2tbs of flour, 3/4 of a 16 oz bag of baby carrots, no tomato paste, no thyme and no rosemary. 

I coated the pot roast with salt, pepper and flour.  I then browned the roast and transferred it to the crockpot. Since I used baby carrorts I did not chop them.

The roast cooked for 4.5-5.5 hours.  When done, I transferred the cooking liquid to a pot and brought it to a soft boil. I think mashed 3tbs of corn starch and 3tbs of butter together in a bowl.  I then transferred the mash to boiling liquid and allowed to thicken.

I will make this again.

It was good and easy to make!  I added potatoes because I think every roast should have a potato but stuck to the recipe otherwise...not one complaint at the dinner table :)

I make this recipe with a rump roast ( any size ) Salt and pepper roast, brown roast in olive oil, put in slow cooker with chopped onions, garlic and thyme. Pour one can of CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup over top. Add 1/4-1/2 can of water or chicken stock. You will get juice from meat.
Cook for 5 hours or until tender. One hour before done add cut up potatoes. When ready to serve add carrots cooked seperately.
Easy

This makes the BEST stew ever!  I cut the roast into 2 inch cubes to make beef stew, otherwise I followed this recipe exactly.  I am going to make it again. It truly is perfect as is.  The gravy is fantastic and my family couldn't believe how well it turned out. The mushrooms add so much flavor and depth. Be sure to watch the video! Great recipe!

Could only find a boneless roast (maybe 2 lbs?) and though the flavor was good it was way too much liquid for that much meat. There is quite a bit of prep before it goes in the slow cooker so make sure you allow plenty of time if making it in the morning before work. And I wasn't expecting a pot roast w/o potatoes. It just didn't seem like pot roast without potatoes. I'll add some if I make again.

Excellent! Almost the same as my recipe with the exception of mushrooms and tomato paste. I like to use a 7 bone roast for this as well because of marbling of fat and marrow from the bones. I might be a little more efficient than Chef John in that I have the carrots and celery chopped ahead of time and in the crock pot so that I could transfer the meat from the skillet to the crock pot immediately. I usually add a can of drained green beans and add the fresh herbs during the last half hour of cooking. I was surprised to see that Chef John added the fresh herbs at the start. Fresh herbs should always be added towards the end of the cooking time.

My husband made this for dinner tonight and WOW, it is delicious! Simple, hearty food with great flavor. Since there's just 2 of us we did a 3lb Round Roast instead of bone in and it was just fine. It will make for about 3 meals for us, so it's also very economical!

I followed this recipe, except that I used a smaller chuck roast and more veggies and potatoes.  I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and used red wine to deglaze the pan, and that added a lot of flavor. I didn't have fresh or dry herbs so I omitted them but it still had flavor. My husband even liked it, so it was a win!

This was fairly easy (and would be easier without the sauteing).  I doubled the mushrooms and I'll add potatoes next time.

Worked out pretty great!  This is my first attempt at slow-cooking, and I really underestimated the amount of salt needed to make it "to-taste", for both the initial rub and when serving.  Would have been good to know what the average measurements are for the salt in the ingredients portion of the recipe (instead of just "to-taste").  Other than that, pretty rockin'

Not technically 5 stars YET but I just put everything in the crock pot and looks and smells HEAVENLY! Can't wait for dinner. Only changes I made was instead of chicken broth, used half beef broth/half red wine (all I had on hand). Also added a pinch of red pepper flakes in with the herbs since we like our pot roast spicy! Looks good!!!

Absolutely the best pot roast I have ever made. I have been looking for a recipe with loads of flavor and I found it. I did add fresh garlic and cream of mushroom because I did not have mushrooms. Skipped the chicken broth and tomato paste. This will be a family tradition recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe. I've tried a lot of slow-cooker recipes and never felt compelled to leave a review.  This however was worth it. I added potatoes as I always love those with a roast and it came out great. Can't wait to make again for company.

I used 2 chuck roasts around 2 1/2 lbs. each. Followed all the directions expect for the slow cooker, I didn't think I had enough time to use the slow cooker. Cooked it in the oven at 275 degrees for about 4 hours. Absolutely delicious and I had leftover Chef John's mac and cheese. Perfect dinner on a cold night.

Easily the best slow cooker recipe for pot roast that I've ever found.  The tomato paste paired with the mushrooms makes the most delicious sauce.  My kids asked me to make it again--while we were still eating it!!  The whole family LOVED it!!    **Made this Gluten Free by using cornstarch instead of flour.**

Very yummy! I did make a couple changes. Added 1/2 cup of yummy dry red wine to my satueing vegies then returned my browned roast back in pan for another 5 mins. Then put it all in crock pot. Also used beef stock/broth. Wow theres nothing like smelling a yummy roast in the fall when you come home from work!

for 2people i bought a 3.5 lb bone in beef pot roast (which was on sale at my local vons for a little over $10 total price) & my hubby & i ate the whole darn thing (our maltipoo had the bones;) . remember there will be a lot of fat at the end! 
i followed to a T .. i added thickly sliced parsnips & subbed beef broth.
yes, a fantastic gravy can be made w/cornstarch.. serve w/ mashed taters.. & youve got a top notch dinner!

Thank you again Chef John!! This is the first recipe that I have made from this site without reading any reviews first.  It was incredible.  I did add extra mushrooms, only because you can never have enough.  The leftovers were also excellent. I've made many pot roasts, but this will now be my go to recipe. Chef John has the best recipes, videos, and techniques.

No leftovers!  Everyone loved it.  I could not find a bone in roast,  can only imagine how good the flavor would be with bone in.  Next time I make it I will put in more carrots just because we like carrots but really a good recipe just as is.

This is absolutely delicious! I'm not much of a beef eater but I enjoyed it and my husband who is a beef lover said it tastes like it's from a gourmet restaurant. Love the fact that it's all-natural, no processed ingredients yet so easy and so good!

Absolutely fabulous!!  This is hands-down the best slow-cooker roast recipe I have made or tasted.  The only change I made was to double the mushrooms, as we are fanatics of mushrooms with beef.  The roast was so tender, not at all stringy and tough like some other recipes I have tried, and the gravy was perfectly seasoned.  I can't wait to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  The preparation is definitely worth the extra time; no recipe that simply calls for just dumping everything into the cooker even comes close.  My compliments to Chef John; this recipe and technique are definite keepers!!

Fantastic recipe! I got a 3 pounder instead of 5. I used beef broth & red wine instead of chicken broth.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried rosemary.  I was out of thyme (heh) so I had to use Italian Seasoning instead. Hubs & daughter loved it.  Best pot roast they ever ate.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Very Tasty ! I used a large chuck steak/roast which I trimmed any excess fat off of and turned out very good. Followed the recipe and searing the meat definitely helps. Will make again .

This was amazing! I had to leave out the tomato paste, carrots, and celery because my husband doesn't like them and I added potatoes. The flavor was so amazing I was surprised and my husband enjoyed it as well. I will def make this again

Wonderful.  I usually use beef broth instead of chicken, but either one works well.  This makes a delicious gravy and could not be easier to make.  The smells are nice to come home to.  Mmmmm, rosemary...  :)

Good base recipe. Substitute half the broth with some wine, toss in some extra vegetables, adjust the spices according to taste and you can't go wrong. Definitely replaces the other pot roast recipe I got from this site.

Great recipe!  I left out the tomato paste (because I didn't have any) and it turned out perfect.  I also used fresh garlic.  I added my carrots for only one hour at the end so that they were not too mushy.  Thank you for sharing!

This roast was amazing! I started the roast too late in the day for dinner so I cooked it about 6 hours and then let it settle in the refrigerator overnight.  Next morning I popped it back in the cooker and heated it up again for lunch and it was amazing... so soft it just fell apart.  I transferred the juices to the stove and thickened it up a bit for gravy and served the whole thing with mashed potatoes.  My first roast and I will be doing this again!

Only changes were as per other reviews and used beef broth instead of chicken broth. It was very tender and well received by our guests.

Wonderful! Very flavorful and tender....only changes that I made, no flour when searing, used one cup red wine and only 1 1/2 cup  stock .... at the end of cooking added a touch of heavy cream and thickened a bit with cornstarch. Loved by all served with polenta  and great leftovers the next day!

I made this recipe on a cold day in Chicago!  It was perfect.  The only  additions I made were more veggies as we are a veggie family.  The only thing was ( maybe I'm slow in the kitchen,) It took me 45 min. to prep by the time I cleaned, cut. spanked and braised.  It was well worth it.

It was very good, with a nice rich gravy. It was a bit more like a stew, than what I expected.

I made this according to instructions (ok, I added more mushrooms). We thought this was a great main dish and the accompanying vegetable went well with it.  The 6 hours of braising in the slow cooker resulted in a tender pot roast.  Chef John emphasizes the initial sear to the meat which seals it for the long braising process.  Always nice to see Chef John's recipes-a great resource.

Always amazing.  It take a little time the first time to prep, but I've done it three times now.  Get everything out.  You can cut most of the veggies while the meat is browning.  Family loves it!

We had a wild bear roast in the deep freeze for a while, and I finally got the courage to make something with it. This recipe was easy and it turned out so tender and delicious. I added a bit of worchestershire sause and used left over venison gravy from an earlier crockpot meal that turned out  so great, I saved the gravy to use on noodles. But ended up substituting the chicken stock with the left over gravy. Also added baby protabello mushrooms the recipe. I bet even with a beef roast, any of my additions would make it special.

I followed the recipe except for the rosemary as my husband doesn’t like it, and some extra vegetable bullion.  It turned out great, and 2 days later, after leftovers sat in the fridge, I heated it in the oven and it might have been even better.  Served it with mashed potatoes to friends who I wanted to visit with, instead of working in the kitchen.  Give this one a shot as written, folks!

Made in a stock pot, then baked at 250 for about 5 hours. Meat was perfectly cooked and fell apart. I also used beef broth, added a lot more of all seasonings (garlic, rosemary, and thyme!) I like these types of meals to be hearty and flavorful and these changes accomplished that! It was a delicious dish!

Chef John needs to take a trip across America to find the grocery chain that ever has a 7 bone beef Chuck roast available.  Darn few and a recipe that doesn't explain that a boneless Chuck will work is a recipe constructed by someone not a home cook.  Otherwise the recipe is a great template to play with to adjust to a family's taste profile.

Amazed at how good the mushroom sauce was. Next time, I’ll make a second batch to add when serving, since the flavors changed while in the cooker. I used beef broth and some red wine, and added some gold potatoes. I had used an Eye of Round Roast, which was a bit too lean and came out rubbery after 4 hrs on high. I let it cook another hour with the lid off and that helped the sauce thicken and the roast dry enough to be fork tender. I will definitely make this one again!

Loved how this recipe turned out!  Followed the recipe as written with the addition of a 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce that I added to the mushroom mixture after the garlic has cooked for a minute. This will be my go-to pot roast recipe from now on. Thanks Chef John!

I have to say this was by far the BEST pot roast I've ever made! The only changes I made was that I used beef stock instead of chicken, substituted 1/2 cup of the beef stock for red wine, added lipton onion soup mix, and 3 potatoes toward the end. It was absolutely delicious!!

Like all recipes prepared by any decent cook will be tweaked according to the desires of the person preparing it .  That said, there are so many negative reviews I wonder if some people just like to complain or just don't know how to cook.  A review negative or positive should in some way assist others in making the dish as good as possible, and not to convey a sense of mean spiritedness.  For those who made comments and gave positive recommendations to enhance the recipe...  thank you..  BTW  turned out great!!!

The meat was very tender and the mushrooms and onions were a tasty addition. I did not add the tomato paste as I did not have any. I agree that additional seasoning. is needed, perhaps the addition of Lawry's Season Salt. I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth.

Really good! I used beef broth instead of chicken and doubled the carrots because we like them. Everything else I kept the same and served with mashed potatoes. The taste was great. The meat was fork tender. Next time I’ll thicken the juice into a gravy because it didn’t come out thick.

Loved it!! I used beef broth instead of chicken broth and it was out of this world. Loved the addition of tomato paste. I served it with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, cornbread and a avocado salad as our Sunday family dinner. Everyone loved it. Definitely going to make this again!

Tender and very good and it smells so good in the house.  I guess I didn’t season enough  because I found it a little dull taste wise.  But it was tender and appealing. I will try it again and add other earth root veggies plus more spices.

I followed recipe exactly and then decided last minute to add mashed potatoes and turn into a shepherds pie ??— I added flour in the crock to the liquid for 5 minutes ( took meat) then put in a Pyrex added mashed potatoes to top and cooked for 20 minutes in the oven— it was fantastic!!!! The flavors work really well for a shepherds roast beef pie!!!!

Very good. I must say, this particular video is so relaxing to watch/listen to. A bit like a Grandparent reading a bedtime story to you. Except for the smaller sized cut of meat, made everything as-is. So easy, so good. Thanks, Chef John.

This was the best roast I've ever had!  I used a large deer roast and followed directions except I didn't have rosemary. I added a couple other spices from Penzey's. Will be making this again & again.

Great recipe!  I didn't add mushrooms, since I don't like them, and threw in a couple tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and used beef broth instead of chicken.  I didn't have a bone in roast, so used one without and cooked it on low.  Everyone loved it!

I didn't have the chicken broth, celery,  or tomato  paste so I just used water and added a little extra salt, a couple more carrots, and red potatoes (cut into fourths)  and it was very good!  The next time I'll follow the recipe to see how that tastes!  Very easy and I will make it again.  We love left overs!
PS:  I will make sure to cut off more fat from the roast the next time I make it.  I had a lot of fat floating on the top that I had to remove.

I made the pot roast, but couldn't find a 5-pound slab of beef, but found a 3 lb. and 1 1/2 lb. ones. Also was low on stock, but Guinness Draught made a great substitute! Came out really well, definitely good comfort food in winter. Will probably  add some Chipotle pepper next time to get some more kick.

Good pot roast. Better after it has sat in the herbs longer so 2nd & 3rd day better flavors.

Easy and delicious! I used a bottom round roast because it was on sale but it worked great. I also used chicken bone broth instead of just broth to add more protein. I counted up the nutrition info and mine had higher protein & less fat than what’s listed on the recipe.

I didn’t have tomato paste and it still came out very good. Also, I only had one very large carrot so I added a little extra celery and I added peas about 1/2 hour before being done.

The next night I followed Betty Soups suggestion to make beef ragu out of the left overs. This was a huge hit with my family.  I chopped up some of the leftover meat  and added it and some of the leftover vegetables and gravy to one jar of Classico traditional pasta sauce and warmed it  for about 15 minutes.  Put sauce on top of cooked egg noodles and served it with  Broccoli  and French bread.  Super easy and super yummy!

This pot roast is amazing!  I make it two or three times per month and all I get are rave reviews.  I was shocked when my brother in law said he liked it and he HATES mushrooms!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated for months, but when my husband and I started doing Whole30, I had to make a couple minor changes.  It tastes just as good as the original, if not better.  All I had to do was substitute ghee for butter, olive oil for vegetable oil, and omit the flour.  We occasionally double the mushrooms because we love mushrooms.

Great recipe! I used Coleman’s mustard powder on the roast instead of regular flour. Gave it a little zip! Definitely a keeper recipe!

I’m not a good cook so I followed the directions exactly,  using a boneless 3 lb pot roast. It came out so fantastic!  It was so juicy and flavorful, it is one of the best pot roasts I’ve ever had and gave me such a great feeling to have cooked it myself!

Made it per the recipe and it was excellent.  The mushrooms make the gravy awesome.  Next time  I may add some red wine as some reviewers have suggested to increase the volume of gravy and see if it makes it even better.  This is the only way I will cook a roast from now on!

11.19.18  When I make pot roast, I’m looking for a one-pot meal.  Chef John says to serve over mashed potatoes. No way, not getting into making mashed potatoes at dinner time, so I did cut up a couple potatoes and added to the pot along with the other veggies, as well as a couple extra carrots (just because we love them).  My Mother always cut little slivers in the roast and inserted garlic slices, and I’ve continued that tradition.  This turned out not nearly as flavorful as I’d hoped, and although my meat was not extra fatty, it turned out  greasier than other pot roasts that I’ve made.  I did skim off the fat as best I could.  I’ve never added celery to a pot roast before, and won’t do that again, we just didn’t care for it.  The meat was very moist and tender after five hours, and I removed it from the pot to make some gravy.  Unfortunately, the juice in the pot didn’t have a whole lot of flavor.  I added some Wondra® mixed with beef broth, that helped a little, but even added a bit of beef bouillon to elevate the beef flavor more.  This has had some very good reviews, and although certainly not bad, I must honestly say I was a bit disappointed.

This is the second time making this recipe.  It was delicious both times. I made as directed but omitted the mushrooms as my husband requested.  This is my new go to pot roast recipe. Thanks Chef John! Appreciate all your suggestions in your videos.

They only thing i changed was the beef because my market did not have the bone in. Oh and i forgot to pick up tomato paste so i put a tomato in my "Ninga" blender skin and all with salt and boiled it down.--not sure that made a difference but i felt like a chef on chopped.--- Other than that followed to a T--Holly Molly sooooooooooooo good. I am making this for Christmas--It's a set and forget with no regret--now i will have time to make appetizers.--Thank you

The first time I made it with cut up russet potatoes added to the vegetables (rather than serving over mashed potatoes). I did not trim the fat off the chuck steak (7 steak not available) until it was cooked and ready to eat. 3.5 stars.

The second time, I trimmed the chuck steak, cut it into bite sized pieces then proceeded with salt, pepper, flour sprinkled into it before placing in hot oil. Remainder of recipe as given by Chef John, and served over mashed potatoes - perfect! 5 stars

No need for the extra salt and pepper seasoning at the end.  Ensure you season the meat well in the beginning and all will be good.  I would double the onion and mushrooms and also add 1 more carrot and celery stalk.

Did not add the carrots, did add a bit more tomato paste and used beef broth instead of chic broth.  It was fantastic!

This was a perfect guide to making a delicious pot roast. I loved that the ingredients were all real and simple. The only substitutions I made were based on what I had on hand. No fresh herbs so I used Italian seasoning and extra rosemary. No tomato paste so I used ketchup. I used a 2lb boneless pot roast and added some beef broth because i didn’t have that much chicken broth. It turned out so great. Will definitely make again.

Honestly, this was so good. It was my first roast, and it turned out perfectly. I did have beef stock on hand, and I used it instead of the chicken stock. I put over mashed potatoes, and it took it over the top for me.

The cooked just the chuck roast in the slow cooker and it was tender and tasty.  For an inexpensive cut of meat, it came out pretty tasty.

Absolutely delicious!!  Melts in your mouth and is as good as/better than anything from a restaurant.  I used chuck roast, doubled the tomato paste and garlic and cooked in the oven for three hours at 425°.  Since I used the oven instead of a Crock Pot, I increased the amount of chicken stock and added some red wine.  So good!  Thank you, Chef John!!

What the #&%@?? I HATE pot roast. Always have. But I make it for my husband because he loves it. So I tried this recipe. I figured he would like it because he doesn't like wine in his food. What I DIDN'T count on was that I would love it too. It is amazing!! Chef John, I will be checking out your other recipes to see what else I might love if made in the right way. Just not Okra. Not. Ever. Okra.

Yes, I will def make this again! My changes were, I used a 5 pound rump roast, I didn't add tomato paste to the saute' of onion and I added celery instead of mushrooms! I also added 2 parsnips and 4 Yurkon Golden Potatoes, washed with skins on (because the skin contains lots of nutrients) and cut up to the pot. I also added a few shakes of the herbs "Everything Bagel" as my last ingredient! The flavor was amazing and my son, a grown man now, was very happy to come home to THIS ENTREE'!

I used a quality boneless roast because that is what I had. I didn't have fresh mushrooms or celery so I used small red potatoes and some celery seasoning instead. I also put dried herbs in the juice/gravy.  It turned out very well.  I will make it again.

Man this was gooood. I had a 2-lbs boneless roast and cooked it on low for 8 hours. Added a couple of red unpeeled potatoes to make it extra hearty and this was finger licking good with a warm piece of home made crusty bread.

I was looking for a crockpot pot roast recipe that doesn't require any pre-packaged soup mixes or other ingredients I don't stock in my pantry and that I could modify for my husband's low carb diet.  There was a bit more prep work for this crockpot meal, but the effort was worth it.  This was exceptional!  I only had a 2.25 pound pot roast, so I basically halved the recipe.  Instead of chicken broth, I used 1 cup of water and a heaping tablespoon of Better Than Boullion.  I did not use any flour or butter (we didn't miss them!).  Both my husband and I loved it. We'll be adding this into our regular rotation.

the meat fell apart as I picked it up and out of the cooker. Tender and very tasty.
Not a big fan of mushrooms, but they gave it great flavor and we enjoyed the meal.

Used beef broth instead of chicken and cut out the celery, and it was very very delicious! I used a 2 lbs of beef since I only feed 2 people which left me plenty of liquid, so planning on making a scrumptious gravy as one previous reviewer recommended.

I made this for our traditional noche buena, the family meal at the stroke of midnight on New Year's eve. Everyone loved it but when I do it again, I'd cook the veg separately to keep the crunch.

I added more spices, didn't use tomatoe paste,I put in twice as much potatoes, carrots &celery because my crock pot is huge. It tastes scrumptious. I suggest adding more potatoes if not in the Crock-Pot another pot.

I love Chef John's recipes and humor! I have made this many times and it is a hit in our house! I follow the directions almost completely every time. If I don't have tomato paste I have substituted ketchup or tomato sauce in the past. This is a hit with my 5 year old  and my hubby and many different family members that have come to visit!

I usually make my pot roast with instant onion soup. I had a pot roast, but no onion soup, so I made this. Oh, so much better! I used dried herbs, about a tablespoon of each, I used a whole 6 oz can tomato paste. For the veggies I didn't have any mushrooms, I put whole baby red potatoes on the bottom of the crockpot with the celery and carrots. I did flour and brown the roast. That seemed like plenty of flour to me. I sliced the onions and put on top, then poured the sauce over. This was so good! I might try beef broth next time, just to see if it's an improvement. Thank You for a wonderful recipe!

Yummy! Wow, I think I tried 20 different pot roast recipes and finally found this one that deserves a page in my recipe book! Thank you again chef John for an awesome (sauce) recipe! Followed the recipe, but forgot the fresh herbs and used Italian seasoning (already had it) instead. Will definitely use this over and over again.

I made this recipe with a 2lb boneless eyeround because it was on sale, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly . The gravy was delicious (the measurements given provided plenty of it too) and the meat was fork tender and flavorful.  I thought this made a delicious crock pot roast, and I will definitely make it again.

It was ok. I didn’t add enough carrots, but the fat from the cut of beef seeped off into the broth and the veggies and gave it a weird flavor.

Awesome! Perfect recipe. I did add baby potatoes and fresh green beans just because that's what I like but fallowed the recipe other than that. This was perfect. I've made it three times now. My four year old loves it and she's become quite picky lately.

This dish turned out to be amazing. Thanks so much for providing this recipe.  I did make a change at the end, as I made a roux then blended in the broth. Once boiled, I poured in a small amount of milk mixed with flour.  Boil and stir.  Salt and pepper to taste.  The gravy was amazing and really finished the dish off nicely.  I made homemade biscuits to go with the meal, which were a welcome addition.  I highly recommend making it.  I used the freshest, organic ingredients and the meal was Divine.

Made this for the first time last night. It is a delectible, refined, elegant version of Pot Roast . It's different than my usual in that it has chicken broth instead of beef, mushrooms instead of potatoes, fresh thyme and rosemary instead of bay leaf and marjoram and I can't recall ever making a sauce with tomato paste before layering everything in the slow cooker. The only thing I did differently was use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for browning.   My husband enjoyed it also. I didn't take a picture.  It looked identical to the one in the video.

This recipe didn't work out as i thought it would when it comes to tenderness. i used the slow cooker mode on my instant pot and let it go for 6.5 hrs and it wasn't quite tender, so i pressure cooked it for 15 mins. without much difference. The flavour is outstanding though. i didn't have any fresh herbs so i untied and unrolled  the roast and smeared the inside with the two grated garlic cloves and some Herb de Provence.  i re rolled and tied the roast and seasoned with a little homemade steak spice and seared it. Next time i will let this go over night in the instant pot on slow cooker mode and see it that makes a difference.

Good recipe..  Would make again.

I tweaked it by cutting the onion in half cross wise and cutting each half in eighths.
Instead of the chicken stock/broth I used 1 cup beef stock and1 cup red zinfadel wine, and added 12 small red skin potatoes.

This was really yummy. I did have to substitute ketchup for the tomato paste.....so what the heck, I threw in a good splash of red wine.  We served it with mashed potatoes and I also made some gravy out of the liquid.  The leftovers were even better!!

My husband dropped hints about pot roast, so I tried this, and he raved about it for two weeks.  The only thing I changed was I added potatoes.

Super yummy!!  This is the BEST pot roast I've ever tasted! I followed the video recipe closely by well salting and peppering the 7 lb roast.  It seemed excessive, but the final result was wonderful and there was no need to add further salt.  I also sprinkled garlic powder generously on the roast before adding the flour and 'spanking' it in.  I then seared it very well as directed. To the mushroom mixture I added 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce and doubled the tomato paste.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used the equivalent of dried Rosemary 1/2 tsp (very potent) and Thyme 2 tsp and added that to the mushroom mixture.  I doubled the celery and tripled the carrots on the bottom of the slow cooker since I had an army of kids to feed!  I also pushed down under the juices,  6 medium quartered red potatoes and 1 lb halved Brussels sprouts after the 5th hour of cooking.  That time was also opportune to pull out the fat and bone, breaking up the meat to smaller pieces. The potatoes thickened the juices perfectly and made a wonderful gravy over the next 60-90 min of cooking (the last 20 min with the top off to further thicken the gravy and finish off the veggies).  The next day leftovers were even more rich, though it hardly seemed possible!  We will definitely be making this many more times to come!

It was hands down the most flavorful roast  I ever made.
The gravy I made with the juice was amazing and the mushrooms are a must as they gave so much flavor to the gravy.

I added 5 large garlic cloves, a fresh chopped red jalapeño and used beef broth instead of chicken.  Wonderful depth of flavor!  Also cooked it on low for 6 hours, and used a regular roast beef cut without bone.

I made this by the recipe except I added potatoes in addition to the veggies and it came out great, vert tasty. The only thing I might suggest, it calls for cooking time between 5-6 hours, I think closer to 5 hours would be better. I cooked a full 6 hours and the meat got slightly dried out.

This is the best recipe for roast I have ever made!  I’ve made this recipe several times with different cuts of beef - bone in and without bone.  I had to use beef broth because I ran out of chicken broth.  It always turns out mouth watering and scrumptious.  I made a double recipe and my family ate second and third helpings!  No leftovers!

I made this exactly as listed, threw in a bay leaf and omitted the thyme, as it was under two feet of snow today!  Added potatoes and some  additional carrots the last hour of cooking... ( I hate super mushy veggies )
then thickened the gravy with some flour and water when it was done.. awesome.. got rave reviews..

Delicious and easy.  I did substitute one cup of red wine and 3/4 cup each beef and chicken broth for the 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth.  This is going to be a winter favorite for sure!

Everything about the recipe was good, including adding red wine. It was delicious. 

However (why I gave this 3 stars), is that being new to "slow cookers" as opposed to crock pots, which are entirely different, this and many other "slow cooker" pot roast recipes  called for a cooking time of anywhere between 4-6 hours on high temp. Some said high was around 350°. Needless to say that 3 hours into cooking, the house was smelling real good (as I remember my grandfather cooking up a pot roast in the basement), I went to check on the roast (chuck), and it was a crusted hockey puck, albeit, still semi edible if you can believe it.

Looking at the book that came with the slow cooker roaster, it's a little vague, but it did say that a well done roast takes about 1 hour at 350°. If I read it before I started cooking it, I would not have believed that I would get a fall apart chuck roast in 1 hour, but based on the 3 hour results, who knows.

So 5 stars for the recipe, 1 star for the cooking instructions. I'll try this again, but next time, I'll probe the meat, and use a timer!

Great recipe for a nice chuck roast cooked slowly in a crock pot. I used can mushrooms and beef broth but other than that I followed recipe. The thing about this cut of roast is you shouldn't expect it's going to fall apart after slow cooking. However, the flavors and vegetables combined make it comparable to a classic New England Pot Roast dinner which is one of my favorites when the weather is on the cold side.

The flavor in this roast was great! I followed the recipe (for the most part, I always adjust some things and don’t measure much - it still turned out delicious), and wouldn’t change a thing! I will definitely be making this again.

As usual, I just use the recipe as a guideline, never making the same dish the same.  Came out very good - meat fell apart.  Vegetables were tender and tasty.  Even made a good roast beef sandwich with some of the left over meat.  I would recommend trying this - it is fun!

This was great! Used a 3.6 lb. Angus chuck roast and trimmed fat from edges. Everything else was to recipe. Didn't have much fat to skim off during cooking for 5 hrs.. It makes its own yummy gravy too. First time out on this recipe and it was so delicious we will most definitely make this again. Thanks Chef J.

Made this exactly as written and it turned out FANTASTIC!  Taking the time to brown the meat and sauté the veg and then make the sauce/gravy in the pan was so worth it!  I made it a week later without taking those steps and it was still good, but there was certain depth of flavour that was missing.   Thanks for sharing this recipe Chef John!

Great recipe and a crowd pleaser! I added potatoes. I just read some of the other reviews and will try some of the variations recommended. My crockpot has a thermometer that will turn the unit to warm once it reached the desired temp. I'm glad I used it because on high it cooked much faster than the recipe recommended. It was done in roughly 3 hours.

This was good and very similar to the way we normally prepare pot roast. We don't usually use mushrooms and we enjoyed this addition. The only thing we did differently was that we added Yukon gold potatoes. Fall comfort food!

I actually took this recipe and used it on a pork roast. It worked wonderfully. It only needed to cook for like 4.5 hours, but the broth and flavor was amazing. Definitely great flavor to use for homemade gravy too!

This recipe is a keeper.  Made recipe as written but added a couple cut up potatoes in the bottom with the celery and carrots.  Added a few extra carrots as well. Also put in some frozen peas near the end. So delicious!  Thanks Chef John.

I followed this recipe to the letter and although it was good, I didn't feel all the early vegetable preparation at the beginning was really worth it.  Slow cooker recipes should be super easy and quick from a preparation perspective.

Really good.  Will become my new "go to" pot roast recipe.  May add some small red potatoes next time.  Followed directions exactly except I didn't have the fresh herbs on hand.....used dried herbs instead.

I used a 5-lb boneless roast (instead of bone-in).  Other than that, no changes.  It was the tiniest bit bland, but that was probably due to me not using enough salt and pepper when seasoning it on the front end (I didn't want to make it too salty since it called for broth, etc.).  This was a whole-family-pleaser though --- my husband's favorite part was the mushrooms.  I cut the onions into big slices so that my youngest could pick them out.  My middle child even liked the cooked carrots (and she normally hates cooked carrots).  I will definitely make this again down-the-road.

This pot roast was delicious. I also put in potatoes & turnips which I browned after removing the onions & mushrooms from the frying pan. Part way through cooking in the crock pot, I added two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. This recipe is more time consuming than just throwing the ingredients into the crock pot & flipping it on, but the recipe is definitely worth the extra work if one has the time.

Excellent recipe.  I did deglaze the pan with a cup of Cabernet Sauvignon...used a 1/2 and 1/2 blend of chicken and beef stock = 1 cup.  Served with fondant potatoes.

This roast was savory and delicious! The only thing different I did was cook the roast on low for 8 hours as opposed to high on 5-6 hours. I kept everything else the same. The flavor combination was fantastic! I'll definitely use this as my go-to pot roast recipe.

This was delicious and easy!! Probably the best pot roast recipe around. The only thing I did different is generally seasoned the meat with Lawry's garlic salt and a little pepper. We are all garlic lovers.

Very very tasty! Couldn't find bone in but worked out fine.  The only other change is I used baby carrots and didn't measure anything. Put over top of mashed potatoes. Will make again.

Made this for my hubby and I and we loved it.  I used dry herbs because I didn't have fresh on hand and used beef broth instead of chicken. Also added some halved miniature potatoes.  Delicious! Making it again tonight for company!

One can of chicken broth next time. Otherwise, watch the video and it should be great. Next time some red pepper flakes to kick it up a little.

First time making Pot Roast.  Prep time was longer than I expected but it turned out amazing.  Tender and juicy with the vegetables.  I didn't have beef stock so I used vegetable stock and it was still amazing.  The house smelled like food paradise and still lingered the next day.  Chef John does it again!

Best Pot Roast I've ever made and I have made more than a few. I  followed the recipe with only a few modifications. Added twice the amount of fresh herbs and seared the roast without using flour. This will be my new go to recipe for pot roast.

I am only one in my household; so reheats are needed. It's fantastic first-served but "meeh" beyond that.

Suggestion for other sole household cooks: cook fresh veggies for each leftover session. The meat and potatoes hold up fine. And a fresh baguette is always a nice touch!

I have made this pot roast multiple times and it's a favourite recipe for sure! I used a boneless cut of beef and cooked it on low for 8 hours, then high for another 2 hours.  The meat falls right apart. Absolutely delicious!

I followed the recipe as written up to the last minute.  There was quite a lot of liquid in the crockpot after I removed the meat and veggies.  So I made a slurry of cornstarch and red wine and stirred it in to thicken the gravy.  Everything tasted great, but the meat was stringy and dry in my opinion.  Good thing I had lots of gravy!  I will probably try this again with a different cut of beef.  Maybe a chuck roast, instead of a tip roast.

I made this with the big venison roast and it came out perfect. The only thing I might do different would be to add a little less salt on the roast.

Good grief this is a good one. Best recipe I've found here. if you follow the recipe to the letter you can't go wrong. I strained then thickened the crock pot liquid, then served it over noodles. worthy of six stars.

This roast was so tender I swear I think it just melted in my mouth. The flavor was excellent. Thank you so much for sharing.

Great! My only suggestion is to flip the roast half way through the slow cooking process so both halves of the roast marinate in the broth mixture :)

This was delicious. I used all "low sodium" ingredients so a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese was the perfect addition. I served it over Pappardelle pasta. Yummy comfort food on a rainy evening!

Delicious. Simple and elegant. I used a boneless 2.75 LB Pot Roast cooked in slow cooker on high for 5 hours. Served with wide noodles and horseradish. Savory. Leftovers a must for next day sandwiches. I added Red Pepper Flakes, about 1 TBL on top of roast prior to adding the mushroom onion mixture. Will make again. And again.

I made this recipe carefully following the directions. The braising of the beef with salt, pepper and flour was wonderful. However, we did not care for the sauce. Next time I will follow the braising directions but switch over to a different gravy recipe.

I made this 2 weeks ago. I had a 5lb chuck roast put it in the crock pot for 4 hours on low. I needed to turn the crock pot to off for 2 hours.  It came out wonderful.

Good, a bit overdone, which may be due to the new slow cooker and my lack of experience with it.  I'll add carrots, potatoes, and more liquid next time.

I followed this recipe as it was written except I was out of celery. It may have made a difference in the flavor. I was happy with it though. I thought because I had a 2.5# chuck roast I would only have to cook it half as long, but it took the full 5-6 hrs to really fall apart. I would definitely make it again. Be sure to salt it @ the end because it needed it.

Will definitely make it again. Used a boneless chuck roast, sliced it horizontally into two 1 1/4" slabs. Cooked one of the slabs and made two meals for my wife and me. Froze the other one and will slow-cook it in a week or so. Makes a GREAT meal over red mashed potatoes.

Truly enjoyed it.  Used a 3-1/2 lb roast but kept everything else the same.  Leftovers were just as good.

First time cooking in my Crock Pot.  Meal came out good.  I added 1/2 cup wine to recipe.  Meat was nice & tender, but not as tasty as I'd like.  The juice was flavorful so it made the difference.   Will most likely make again.

I only made 2 changes to this excellent recipe:  I used bison pot roast meat, approx 3 lbs.  The meat was lean and I was nervous that it would be tough but it was  good and tender!  The second change was that I added red wine to the beef broth....oh yes, I used beef broth instead of chic broth.  I also added baby potatos, red and yellow. Everyone loved it and was savoring every bite.   Chef John, you rock and you never fail to impress with your phenomenal recipes!  Thanks so much for your contribution to my happy household!

My family loved it!  The only substitutions I did was use a 3 pound roast, dried Thyme and cooked on low for 6 1/2 hours - added cut fingerling potatoes on high for another 1 1/2 hours .  It was a big hit!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe but I did make a few changes.  I love potatoes so I added small red potatoes to the recipe.  I didn't have any mushrooms (he isn't a big fan of them) but I added a can of cream of mushroom soap on top of the meat. I was going to be out all day, so I cooked it on low for about 8 hours.  It was awesome.

Made  this past weekend during our first New England blizzrd, perfect comfort meal for a blustery evening! It was silky and delicious and would highly recommend.  The only changes I made was to season the roast and dust with flour  and searing on stove before adding to crock pot. I think it adds more flavor as well as helping to thicken gravy. Also I waited 5 hours before adding potatoes & carrots  and then cooked 3 more hours till done so they weren't turned to mush.

Delicious recipe. Only thing I did differently was add some small red potatoes and thickened gravy.

Flavor very good, but the cooking time in my slow cooker was WAY off.  I ended up moving it from the Slow Cooker after 6 hrs on high to an enameled dutch oven on the stovetop for an additional two hours.

Loved this roast!   I used a boneless chuck roast (store did not have bone in roast).  I had a LOT of sauce leftover.  It has such a good flavor, I froze it in hopes of finding something  to do with it.  Had all day, so I cooked it on low for 9 hours.   Searing the meat is a must.  
My dinner guests loved it!!   Served it with mashed potatoes savory green beans and artesian bread with dipping oil  I will be keeping this recipe.

I thought this was very good!  I used up about a cup of left over turkey broth and added a cup of beef stock and about a half cup of red wine. I also doubled the amount of carrots just because we like lots of carrots with a roast.  Also tossed in a bunch of baby red potatoes for the last hour.  The broth/gravy has a great flavor, it will be my go to pot roast recipe from now on!

I used a 2.5 lb. boneless chuck roast. The meat could not be Anymore tender!!!!  The liquid left over was too fatty to make good gravy unfortunately but I assume that was from the fat on the meat combined with the veg. oil AND butter used to sear and then cook onions and mushrooms.  Beyond tender though!,

I needed a recipe for a big crowd, and I liked the basics of this. I didn't quite double it, but I used 8 lbs of pot roast, 4 cups of broth, and a rough double of everything else. Since carrots and celery are not favorites in my house, I used cubed potatoes, parsnips, and butternut squash instead. Everything was super flavorful and tender. I would definitely make this again.

This came out great! A lot of prep time for me, but it's so good that it's worth the extra time. Took the advice of other reviewers and used beef broth instead of chicken. I definitely seared the heck out of the meat also. Might be the best thing I've made in the crock pot so far!

I reeally liked it, but the spices overwhelmed it. Next time will try putting half the amount or use dried as sometimes I have found fresh can be very potent. I used stewing beef cubes and it worked very well.

This is an excellent recipe. I love cooking roasts in the slow cooker. Followed this recipe closely. Don't forget to sear the roast first. Will definitely make again.

This turned out amazing! My husband was able to shred it with a plastic fork! Here's a few things I did: left out the mushrooms due to personal preference of my audience, doubled the onion, used beef broth (because I ran out of chicken without knowing it!), added more fresh seasonings based on other reviews, cut the carrots and celery ahead of time and just let the meat rest in the crockpot rather than another dish, and cooked it on low for about 8 hours. Most of my edits were out of necessity, so I can't blame the recipe. Haha! Hence the five stars with so many edits. I have already shared this recipe and absolutely love it!

Excellent gravy. I did not have any tomato paste and didn't think it would make all that much difference.   Husband complained about the appearance of fresh rosemary and thyme in his food so next time I will probably use dried.  I usually make the slow cooker pot roast recipe from this website that has cream of mushroom soup in it.  This was a nice change.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Absolutely delicious. My first time making it and only added baby potatoes halved to the slow cooker. I also strained the leftover juices, simmered them on med/high and added corn starch to thicken and the gravy was great.

I didnt have fresh thyme so I used dried thyme I already had in my spice rack.  Turned out great!  I slow cooked it overnite on low for about 10 hours.  Served it with mashed potatoes and it was melt -in-your- mouth delicious!

Worked well with a 3 lb boneless chuck roast.   Great flavor!  It's just my husband and me, so I froze part of the roast and veggies in a Food Saver bag and a few weeks later dropped the frozen bag into a large pot of water, brought it to a boil and then simmered it till it was thoroughly heated through - it was as good if not better when reheated.  Next time I plan to make a larger roast so more can be frozen for later.

The broth can get fatty,  it's a good idea to strain the broth put it into the freezer to allow for the fat to go hard ontop, dispose of fat, then your left with fat free broth

It was a hit for my family for Christmas. But I felt like it needed some worcestershire sauce, so I put some in after everyone left and it was much better.  I also added in chopped potatoes when I was making the dish, in quarters. Very good.

I used a 2.5lb chuck roast, cut about 1/4 of the liquid, and cooked it for 3 hours. It came out great. Next time I would add garlic powder and onion powder to the roast for a little more flavor, but otherwise it was delicious.

Easy to make and turned out amazingly! I cooked mine on LOW setting even though the instructions said HIGH.  I also didn't have celery in the house, so I used a tablespoon of celery seed just to have that flavour. So tender that it was falling apart as I was taking it out of the slow cooker!

This is my Go-To pot roast.  I added the entire contents of the 8 oz can of tomato paste.  Why waste the rest?  Didn't use the '7 Cut' chuck, but I did use chuck roast and it came out perfectly.  I had never made it before, yet it played to rave reviews at a dinner party we hosted.

This was my first attempt at using my crockpot. I pretty much followed the instructions except omitted the celery and microwaved some peas just before serving. Loved it! It does need more seasoning, though. It was missing *something* and I'm not sure what. I just may throw in a packet of onion soup mix and give that a try. That's how my husband makes his from scratch.

Very easy to make slow cooker roast. My carrots were a bit mushy, and the mushrooms designated, but the meat was flaky and the overall taste is really good. Is a very hardy meal. You could serve with a salad and have a complete meal.

I made this recipe as stated except used rump roast and beef broth instead of chicken broth. The meat was tender and pulled apart, didn't even need to cut it. I will certainly make this recipe again.

I did not make any changes.  I prefer to make it as written for the first time around.
The taste was very good and the slow cooker suited my schedule that day.  The great advantage of a slow cooker in my life is that I feel that I can safely leave the house for a few  hours.
For the amount of prep work I would like to try this again oven roasted.  I think that the final product would have benefited from the caramelization provided by oven roasting.
All in all, a good "busy day" recipe.

Made this today with 1. 1/2 lb  boneless beef.  Seared meat very well on all sides, took 20 mins (top, bottom and two sides).  Used beef broth for gravy 1.1/2 cups and 1/2 cup red wine.  Added veggies as suggested by Chef John.  This was amazing!  Had it on High setting for 6 hours.  Took beef out to rest for  15 mins before cutting.   Added 1 tsp Bisto gravy mix  to thicken gravy a little.  Definately 5 stars.

Perfectly good recipe. Am not fond of fat so used a london broil.  A tough piece of meat, but was exceptionally tender after the 5 hours. Liked the combination of other ingredients and subtracted nor added anything.  Will do this again.

Easy & good. I used veal chunks vs. a roast, and I also omitted the mushrooms and added potatoes, just because of what I had on hand.  Versatile recipe.

Best roast EVER! I have been working on a good roast without the store bought mixes or GMO soy sauce. This is it for sure! Changes I made; did not use mushrooms or celery because of personal preference, and instead of chopping my onion I cut it up into chunks. We like to eat the cooked onions with our meal. I make my own chicken stock and the batch I used for this was heavily seasoned already, so I did not use the rosemary and thyme in the recipe. It would've been too much of those two herbs. But if I was using my bland stock, I definitely would have added the two as listed. This roast was so tender, so much WONDERFUL flavor.  Made the best gravy from the juice. My very diverse family ate this up and asked for it again on the next menu! And with a family of nine, to find a unanimous decision is saying something! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This recipe is perfect. Easy to prepare and easily adjustable for quantity. The taste is just right, with subtle savory seasonings (try saying that 3 times fast). It occurs to me as I write this review that I have become a Chef John fan! Whatever I'm looking for, if he has a recipe for it I know it will be a good choice.

Made this recipe and both my husband and I really like it . I used dried thyme and didn't have tomato paste on hand so substituted barbecue sauce and it was still good.

I made this precisely how Chef John recommended. Half way through the cooking (6hours) I tasted the jus. Needed more oomph. So, I doubled the fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary) and used the rest of the can of tomato paste (smallest can). It fell apart as promised after 12 hours at low on the crockpot. Instead of mashed potatoes, I cooked medallions of sweet potatoes separately and put three on the plate with the beef above and the vegetables around with a ladle of defatted jus on top. Everyone loved it. Using the retrospectoscope, I'd have added more carrots. A superb recipe...and since I had to buy two chuck roasts to make the poundage he suggested, I now have another couple of meals available. 

I served this with beer bread. A real peasant meal (a sated peasant, pleasantly sated.)

Excellent dinner, thank you for the recipe! 
I made it one step easier & faster: put in a bag of baby carrots instead of washing & peeling & chopping big carrots. Next time, I would put little red potatoes in to cook with the roast, carrots, mushrooms, onions, rather than serving separate mashed potatoes too. We've never tried this "7-bone" piece of beef before, but highly recommend it, it was tender & delicious. Lots of fat though, needed to pull out the fat pieces with tongs after about 5 hours in the slow cooker along with the bones to get it prepared for dinner. Served it with crescent rolls to dip into the tasty brown gravy.

Delicious! This is the best pot roast I've ever had. I followed the directions just as noted only difference was using dried rosemary.  The braising of the meat makes the difference.  Also the sauce with mushrooms and onions is amazing.

I enjoyed the meal, great taste .cook time was perfect and went well with the ingredients.  I did add a few ingredients with my cook, Beef Bouillon,  basil leafs , butter gold potatoes, tomato sauce, dry brisket rub,  the searing really is the star of this recipes prep. Searing locks in flavor and you really can appreciate that when it comes time to serve this dish. Great meal yall enjoy ! Over all good recipe ,but personal touch and ingredients should be used to taste. Have fun cooking !

Fantastic recipe!!  I followed the recipe with a boneless pot roast instead of bone in.  Also I added chunks of potatoes 1/2 hr before it was ready. Super tender meat, great broth. I will definitely be making this one again.

This was delicious! Only change I made was using beef broth instead of chicken and I added more cornstarch near the end to thicken up the gravy. I'm becoming a chef John fan very quickly! Thanks!

Wonderful flavor!! Do not skimp on the salt and pepper... we are a low sodium family but had to add salt to our plates before enjoying- and yes I coated well at the beginning. Perhaps the potatoes I added absorbed some of the seasonings. 

I added sliced red potatoes when the slow cooker had about two hours remaining. The meal was rich and flavorful without being overwhelming. The chicken broth (vs beef) conolimented the dish as it allows you to enjoy the flavor without limiting you to a few bites because of the intensity. 

A must try- again and again!!

Will make again. Thus is simple old school cook. So you know it's good. Using the slow cooker and added turnips.  Nice Fall meal. Only way to get the colors of Fall in sunny south Florida is to cook with them.

Absolutely amazing, my family of 7 devoured it. My 1 yr old went to sleep in his high chair before the last bite. Someone in the reviews said they followed the instructions down to the tee and it came out very dry must didn't follow the full instructions. The only thing I added different was worchestershire sauce half way through cooking.

This was really good, but made a few changes- seared in bacon grease instead of veg oil, didn't use flour, or butter,  or tomato paste (didn't want to open a can just for 1 Tb.) didn't have mushrooms, used beef stock instead of chicken broth and added a bay leaf on top of the meat. Also didn't have celery or rosemary, used dried thyme, subbed sweet potatoes for white potatoes. I also added 2 Tb. worshestire sauce.I also stirred in about 1/4 cup corn starch mixed in beef stock to thicken it. Cooked overnight on low and we had it the next day for lunch- just 2 of us, so I used a 2 pound boneless English roast. Perfect! Will make again! maybe with a 1/2 cup red wine mixed in next time:)

I have never made a roast in my life and this turned out perfect the first time.  I did add more carrots just because I love them so much.  I cannot wait to make this again for family!  It was also even more tender and flavorful as leftovers.

Oh. Em. Gee. Followed this with no modifications other than I could not find any bone-in chuck roasts so I used 2 lb boneless. This was so incredibly delicious, we had to restrain ourselves from eating all of it. We are on a low carb high protein diet and I decided I wanted to try a different recipe for a pot roast, though I was a little sad by the high calorie count, it was a wonderfully indulgent meal! I will indulge in this again in the future! If you want a little less calories you can cut on the chicken stock or omit it completely, but do know you will be sacrificing flavor.

This is outstanding! I used 5.5 lbs of boneless chuck roast and cooked it on low for 6 hours (my slowcooker tends to overcook), and it was perfection. My new favorite pot roast recipe, thanks!

Few changes for convenience and availability - browned beef in bacon grease and pan used this AM. Had steak rub on hand and gave that a go. Had turnips from last CSA share of season so why not put them in? Parsley in place of other herbs - flavors are so mixed up by now anyway. Put potato and onion chunks in for last hour. All was wonderful - plus benefit, house smelled great all afternoon.

This was a decent pot roast however it ended up oily and the gravy did not thicken the way I had hoped. 

I used a 2.5lb boneless chuck roast as I was only cooking for two.

It was much better the second day after I skimmed the (thick) crust of fat off the top.

Next time I will try using a thickening agent like flour near the end of the recipe to thicken the gravy up, if I decide to give it another chance.

I made this for the first time last night and followed the recipe exactly as it was called for with 2 small changes. The only changes I made were using a pork butt instead of beef because my wife is Hindu and adding quartered peeled white potatoes to the crock pot. I invited my parents over to eat with us and we baked fresh sourdough bread to soak up the gravy. Everyone loved it. My Mom asked for the recipe twice!

Amazing! Only used carrots and potatoes.. Included the chicken broth and seared the roast in garlic first. Delicious! Did not use flour or mushroom mix..

As always, Chef J scores another winner. The difference here is the browning of the roast and the chicken broth. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This was not my mother's pot roast! This has to be the absolute best pot roast I have ever had. Moist, succulent beef dripping with goodness...The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 cup of a dry red wine (I used Hob Nob pinot gris). 
Now I'm drooling...

Chef John does it again.  And this time with a slow cooker!!  Glad I tried this.  I followed the recipe except for a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used a 4.75 pound beef chuck roast (I think that's what it's called).  It was alot leaner than Chef John's 7 bone roast and was a much different shape.  It was thicker and sort of triangular shaped.  Figuring that the thickness of the meat probably makes a difference, I just "butterflied" the piece of meat I had by cutting through the meat until I was able to lay it out flat, a 15 second process.

As others have said, I agree that the browning of the meat with flour is essential to this recipe.  I had two portobello mushroom caps (6 oz total) so I cut those into cubes rather than using regular sliced mushrooms.  I actually think that the texture of the cubed portobellos added to the whole taste/texture of this recipe and will use them (only more of them) next time!  I used 3 BIG carrots and cut them into chunks a bit larger than in the picture of the dish.  Maybe 2 inches.  Due to not having any fresh rosemary or thyme, I used dried.  I just eye-balled how much I needed and added to the simmering onion and garlic mixture.  And I'll admit that I sneaked in about 1/2 cup of dry red wine and used only 2 cups of chicken broth.

I didn't have fresh thyme and made a much smaller roast, so I scaled down just a smidge. Loved the fresh rosemary and the mushrooms, neither which I'd ever used in a pot roast before! This one's staying in my go-to file!

I actually made this  with pork  shoulder instead of beef and because I was working with pork I added to the dry rub a mix of brown sugar, cumin, and some wiri wiri powder I had on hand (to add some spice). I followed the recipe otherwise except using more tomato paste and chicken stock than did he.  It came out amazing!! My best pot roast ever! Thank you again Chef John!

I've used this basic recipe for years. Using a bone-in roast and browning it before coking are the two keys to achieving the most flavorful and tender pot roast. My husband is very sensitive to garlic so I leave it out, but other than that it's mine to a tee. I use whatever broth I have on hand, chicken or beef. Make this one for your Sunday or weeknight dinner for family or guests and you'll never be sorry!

This was absolutely delicious! I used a boneless chuck roast and put it in the oven at 250* for about 5 hours. (My crockpot was too small). I will definitely make this again.

Bone-in pot roast was harder to find than anticipated, as  two of my local grocery stores do not carry it. I had to settle for boneless. We had to add significantly more salt and seasoning than the recipe called for. We found that we needed to move the meat periodically and cook it for longer than called for, in order to make it easier to chew.

I've made pot roast in a million ways over the years, but this was by far the beast tasting pot roast. I followed the recipe exactly except I used dried herbs.  I didn't have any rosemary so I used dried tarragon.(Hubby is not a big rosemary fan and I love tarragon.) We both loved it. Definitely my go to pot roast recipe from now on. Thanks Chef John.

I enjoyed this crockpot recipe.  The only issue I have with this recipe is that there is a bit of prep work required before it can all be put into the crockpot, which kind of defeats the purpose of using the crockpot...but I guess if you want better results, you'll have to give it more effort!

I didn't use the bone-in chuck roast, like it stated (only because I only had boneless chuck roast).  Like another reviewer, I had the idea of adding chunks of potatoes as well since I thought they would add more substance to the vegetables.  The sauce was thick enough but it could have been a bit thicker, for my taste, so that it adheres to the meat and the vegetables better.  I think I'll use a bit more flour next time (and add it towards the end, as one reviewer stated, to thicken the sauce more).  I might also substitute beef broth for the chicken stock, as another reviewer criticized.  Never occurred to me that I should use beef stock when using beef meat versus chicken meat, duh!

All in all, I was impressed it turned out as well as it did, even though I had to do much more prepping than I was prepared to do.  I think this recipe is "guest worthy."

Delicious. I would recommend a 7 or 8 quart slow cooker for this as the amount of ingredients overwhelms a 6-quart cooker.

Have never made pot roast before, and am pleased to say it turned out perfect! I also used beef broth instead and threw in a splash or so of red wine. I try to meal prep for the work week.. And will have no problem eating this left over!! Thanks chef John!!

My family really enjoyed this---the second time I made it I did make a few changes--I doubled the carrots and added a can of cream of celery soup towards the end to thicken it.  I plan on adding potatoes to the next batch.  It was tasty, easy to make and the seared beef was wonderful!

I enjoy a good pot roast that falls apart when you try to cut it. Unfortunately this one didn't but my roast was a little smaller so I didn't cook it the full time. Perhaps that was why.

I personally didn't like the taste of the rosemary and thyme (especially the texture of the herbs).    It was tender, but that was the only good thing about it.

This was an easy to make recipe. It made a great mushroom, onion, carrot, tomato gravy that served perfectly over mashed potatoes.  I used a chuck roast that I had in the freezer and it came out juicy and tender.

To me it didn't have enough flavor. I didn't have rosemary or thyme so I added basil to the gravy. I would suggest adding more flavor to the sauce. I used 1.6 pound roast and the meat literally fell apart on its own.

This is now my go to Pot Roast recipe, my husband and I love it! The only adjustments I made were to substitute the mushrooms for red potatoes, since my husband doesn't like mushrooms. I also just use a bag of baby carrots and generally add way more broth than called for. We serve it over fresh rice and it is delicious every single time!

I followed the recipe set for 4 servings. However, I used doubled the celery and carrots and added 3 potatoes. I will use the idea of searing the meat and mushrooms/onions and will blend this with other recipes.

This is by far the best pot roast I've ever had.  The few extra steps, searing the meat and sauteeing the vegetables makes a huge difference.  I used a smaller roast, added a fourth cup Merlot and subbed potatoes for the celery. There is room for variation but I recommend following the steps for prep and assembly.

Delicious! The only thing I did different was used boneless roast and omit the mushrooms. I added red wine to onions after flour was mixed in. I was pressed for time so I cut my roast in half and cooked  it on high for 4 hours and it came out so tender you could literally cut it with a spoon. Yum!

It was good.   Next time, I will add more fresh herbs for more flavor.  Cooked for 9 hours on low...had to work.  Only change I made was to use beef broth, that was what I had on hand and I added more carrots so I had a veggie already made.

I cut this recipe in half and left out mushrooms because I forgot to buy them.  I also used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  Otherwise I followed all the ingredients and instructions.  This is a good recipe I served with lumpy mashed potatoes but I felt it was lacking in some depth of flavor.  Maybe I didn't salt and pepper it enough at the beginning.  One reviewer said they added some sweet vermouth, which I will try if I make this recipe again.

Couldn't find a 5lb bone-in pot roast; substituted a 2-1/2lb boneless chuck roast and all went well.  Although this isn't a simple "chop and dump" slow cooker recipe, the extra processes of browning the roast and preparing the gravy were easy enough and the end result was delicious.

This was great  - and despite the extra step of searing the mean, quite easy to throw together.  I did find it a bit bland and had to season heavily at the end, before serving.  Overall it was quite good and the meat really was tender, as promised.

This comes out wonderfully juicy and tasty.  Searing the beef with oil, precooking the mushrooms, this is the 2nd time I have made this.  It comes out amazing!   The meat falls apart.

I'm a novice  with the slow cooker and let me tell you that this recipe "WOWED" my dinner guests, I served it with egg noodles as some suggested. The only thing different? I doubled the fresh  herbs and added parsnips to the veggie mix. I'll definitely make it again and again.. 
PS: Don't forget to serve with some bread to soak up the savory gravy it'll yield..

I've made this four times now. Sometimes with more mushrooms, sometimes with green garden onions, sometimes adding potatoes near the end (yum). Great basic recipe that makes this inexperienced cook appear as if he knows what he is doing. Searing the meat well is key! Blacken that baby up and get ready for yummy.

This was terrific!  I have made so many pot roasts in the slow cooker that ended up dry - don't know why - but this one was moist, SO flavorful - delicious.  I served it as suggested with the mashed potatoes and made gravy: adding 1 cup  liquid from the crockpot, added to flour dissolved in 1 cup cold water and heated in a sauce pan with salt and pepper.  I used dry rosemary and thyme.  The best part was the delicious sauce - mouth watering.  Our grocery did not have bone in roast, I used 4.5# round tip roast.  I sauteed the roast, then the mushrooms, garlic, onions exactly as specified and thought they may have been over done, but they ended up adding to the flavor.  Terrific!  We will make again and again.  I cooked on high for 6 hrs. and then it was on warm about a half hour.

This is a excellent pot roast and is without potatoes, that are not on my diet from the Adundance Project by Dr. Thaddedus Gala where I am losing weight for the first time.  I can not have any bread, dairy but I can use coconut flour for the flour in this recipe - Thanks Chef John I love your recipes.

This is a basic recipe that can serve as a base for experimenting or as the only recipe you'll use for a Pot Roast.  All the right, basic flavors are here and you can just enjoy it as is.  I don't have a Slow Cooker so I can only use my dutch oven in at a low and slow temperature. Every thing comes out fine and the flavors are just like Mom's and the roast is so tender.

I loved this dish, and our guests did too! I checked the reviews beforehand and substituted a chuck roast and beef stock for the original meat and stock in the recipe. The meat was soft and delicate and the flavors of the sauce really infused in the meat. It came out beautifully and I can't wait to serve it again!

This is a lot of prep work for a pot roast, and it is totally worth it! The flour really helps it retain its moisture. I followed the recipe exactly, and I got the best pot roast I've ever had!

I am a big fan of chef John. His recipes are battle tested. This is a favorite. Yes the sear is important to flavor ... but add 2 to 3 X the mushrooms. It will be the best roast you ever "crocked".

Far out. This was good. The only thing I did different was to make a Mirepoix for extra flavor and add red wine. For the reviews that used a whole can of tomato paste . . .why? Sounds like overkill to me. Why not just purchase the paste in a tube so you can use just the amount needed?

Yummy yummy. I used 1.5 lbs of left over boneless brisket to replace the 7 steak. Doubled all the veggies and everything else. Prepared it all just as chef John demonstrated. It took a little time to chop, sear, and grill everything but it was totally worth the taste. I had a few left over baked potatoes in the fridge so I diced them, steamed them in the microwave and beat them in the blender with butter, a little juice from the pot roast, and milk as needed and they quickly transformed into seasoned mashed potatoes like magic. As suggested I served the mashed potatos under the pot roast and it was heavenly, delicious and healthy. We shredded the brisket and mixed it back into the pot to make it stretch after it was done roasting in the crock pot and there was more than enough meat, 4 or 8 lbs of meat doubled would have been way too much meat. The whole family loved it, and I am 6 months pregnant so even the baby in my belly was dancing around after I'd eaten some.. It is a very homey, warm meal perfect for a family, one to remember and I will make it again. Thank you chef John!!!

I searched everywhere for a pot roast recipe and finally found this one that didn't require packets of dry seasoning . Well one day I just decided to do it for my husband since he loves pot roast with mashed potatoes and garlic bread. It was delicious I followed every single step did not change a thing. I'm currently making it for the 3rd time and I'm so excited to eat. Thank you so much for this recipe. I'm Hispanic and don't usually cook different food other than Mexican food.so finding this recipe is a keeper. Thank you chef!!!

This Was Delicious..
I Didn't Have Any Fresh Rosemary Or Thyme..But I Did Have  The Grinders .. So I  Used My Flour Sifter & Put The Thyme, Rosemary, Salt & Pepper Into The Flour.. Mixed It Up Then Sifted It Onto The Roast Before I Seared It.. And Used Some In The Mushroom/ Onion/ Garlic To Finish The Sauce.. 
It Turned Out Wonderfully.. & Ohh Smells So Good..

This is hands down the most amazing pot roast I have ever made.  The meat comes unbelievably tender and juicy.  I did add a table of worcestershire to the cooking onions/mushroom.  I also added red wine the first few times I made the pot roast, but it was a big mistake.  The one time I didn't have wine on hand, I just used broth, and it was the best I had ever cooked!  Chef John knows what he's talking about.  No wine.

This was very tasty, and I could tell the difference between browning the pot roast ahead of time and just placing it in the crockpot. The addition of flour on the turns the broth into a gravy which is a great addition to all the vegetables. I did not include the celery because my family dislikes celery, but everything else I did follow (using dried herbs and not fresh).

This looks fantastic (and easy enough that I could make it without problems).  I am NOT a fan of mushrooms - does anyone have a suggestion for what I could use in their place?   I was thinking I could just start by browning chunks of onion and delete the mushroom step, but really don't want to foul this up.  Thanks for your help. I'm not the best cook when entrees are concerned. Baked goods are more my "thing" but I want to build a selection of dinner dishes I can make relatively easily.

This was pretty tasty, a lot of work for a slow cooker meal, but still quite tasty. I followed the directions for the recipe closely, but did make a few changes  to the ingredients  based on what was on hand. Beef broth instead of chicken broth. I added some potatoes. More carrots and celery because my family likes lots of veggies. And added two bay leaves. What I liked most about this recipe is that it has wholesome ingredients. No sodium filled flavor packets or cans of soup. Give it a whirl. You will be glad you did.

This was so worth the extra effort. I'll never use the onion soup/cream of mushroom soup recipe ever again.  Like others, I used beef stock and red wine in place of the chicken broth. I upped the veggies too but omitted the rosemary (personal preference) Made a great gravy and served it all with garlic mashed potatoes.

I use a 3 pound slab of beef, don't know what cut it is. Because I used a 3 pounder I cut the time to 3 hrs. It came out great! I would, however, definitely stress to use fresh rosemary. I used dried and you could barely taste it. I've learned my lesson.

Excellent recipe!  I put a 3 pound boneless cross-rib pot roast in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on low and it was perfect.

Strained some of the liquid from the cooking broth and put on the stove top with a flour slurry to thicken (equal amounts of flour and cold water whisked together...add a bit of the hot liquid to the slurry and then mixed into the pot).  Had to fortify it with a little granulated garlic and beef bouillon to give the gravy more flavor.

Delicious as is but made a few changes. Made a dry rub of salt, fresh cracked pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, rosemary and thyme. Wrapped rump roast  in plastic and refrigerated over night. Seared well and followed recipe  as written except beef broth because I didn't have chicken broth. Awesome taste!! Seriously try using smoked paprika - it adds additional depth of flavor. Yum!

The only things I did different are, I only used a 3lb roast, skipped the rosemary and didn't have thyme sprigs so sprinkled ground thyme on meat before adding mushroom/onion mix. Also, I added about 15 or 16 of those little yellow potatoes. You would think that using beef broth would be more logical but the chicken broth brings flavor you wouldn't believe. The result was an awesome dinner. I will add this to the regular rotation at meal planning time.

Love this recipe. I always eat it like a stew. I use whatever roast is on sale, take out the celery (personal preference), and add a few chopped up potatoes. I usually season the roast with steak spice, and add about a cup of frozen peas towards the end. After cooking for 5 or 6 hours on high, the roast shreds easily and mixes beautifully with everything else. I often add a couple spoonfuls of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up, but totally not necessary. Yum! Makes great leftovers, too.

I made this last night and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly, but decided to add potatoes chunks after the roast had cooked for a couple of hours.  Perfection!  I will make this again.

This was amazing!  I don't normally enjoy pot roast it seems they all taste the same, but this one was so good I went in for seconds.  Even my pickiest eater couldn't get enough of the sauce!!

I added a sprig of rosemary and sage.  Also, added a bay leaf and a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce.  I used one cup of dry red wine and 1 1/2 cups of beef broth instead of chicken broth.  I put in 6 medium potatoes cubed with carrots and celery just so it would be a one pot meal!  My roast was only 3 pounds.

Best beef roast I've made yet.  I added 4 pieces of bacon to the top of the roast which was amazing.  The whole thing turned out great.  I might add some potatoes next time just to have as a side.

Made exactly as is except with boneless meat. My family (teen boys) really liked this and said it was a keeper. If the gravy would have been thicker and had a little more flavor I would give 5 stars. Next time we will try it with beef broth and see how that tastes - also an additional onion. I served over mashed potatoes.

Increased the amount of each vegetable by one half.  (We like lots of veggies.)  Otherwise, made as written.  It was delicious and will definitely make again.

I love this recipe.  It's easy and Really delicious.  I couldn't find a bone in roast, so I just used what I could find.  The method and flavor still produced a very tender delicious roast.  I didn't have tomato paste, so I used a really good red wine, probably about 1/2-1 cup, as the acid component and it was just soo good.  This is now my go-to recipe for pot roast.

This is a really great recipe. With the exception of using a bone-less roast, i followed it to a Tee. After following it to the end, i found that the meat on top was not as tender as i expected it to be. The juices of the meat and broth were not enough to cover the entire roast. (I'm not sure if it was supposed to.) Regardless, the roast was not tender and it doesn't say in the recipe to turn the roast over. Well, this is what i did. I would suggest turning the meat over at 3/4 total cooking time to allow the other end to be submerged in the juices. Let it cook on low for another 1/4 of the original total time. By far, you will not be disappointed!!

PERFECT.  No leftovers which makes me sad, but we saved the sauce to put on pasta tonight. I used boneless since that is what I had in the freezer and it was AMAZING.  PERFECT>  Thank you.

This was nice but I found it bland. Need to spice it up next time. I do need to note that I used a boneless chuck roast so that could have made a difference.

This is the easiest and most delicious recipe I have ever followed. My boyfriends mom recently gifted us a slow cooker.  I was excited to try it so I offered to cook for his family one night. Never made a roast before or used a slow cooker in my life! I followed this recipe almost exactly except I used a beef chuck roast, dried rosemary, and added a few extra veggies. I must say this recipe is AMAZING! I was so happy and proud of how this turned out and so was my boyfriend's family! Took about 20-30 minutes of prep work chopping everything, browning the roast, and making the topping.. After that the slow cooker did the rest. Will definitely be making again and again!

My family hasn't stopped talking about this pot roast since I made it. They loved the rustic texture with the chunky carrots and mushrooms. I followed the recipe exactly, however,next time I might try adding a little red wine. I served the roast over Parmesan Smashed Potatoes. 5 stars Chef John!

Absolute perfection! My whole family LOVED this beef roast. I followed the recipe exactly as written - except that I used a boneless roast because I couldn't find bone-in at my store. I'm so glad I took the extra time to brown the roast and cook the mushrooms and onions. The flavor was amazing!!!! I will never search for another beef roast recipe --- this is IT!!!! Thank you, Chef John!

I used mushrooms, onion and bell peppers instead of the traditional carrots and potatoes. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup which made a wonderful gravy.

This worked out really well. My roast was almost 6lbs. I had to borrow a bigger cooker because ours was a size too small. Anyhow, our household isn't a fan of the fungus so I omitted the mushrooms. I get the impression that they impart a lot of flavor into the chicken broth because when I tasted it at around the 3 hour mark it seemed very bland. I added 3 tablespoons or so of worschester sauce (I used 3 cups of broth) and a few generous shakes of McCormick GrillMates Montreal steak seasoning. This helped to make the sauce a little more flavorful and robust. Then at around the 4 hour mark I took the advice of other commenter and threw in an extra sprig of rosemary and thyme. The final product was pretty good, albeit still a little thin on the flavor profile. Next time perhaps I'll add a beef bullion cube or do a 50/50 chicken and beef broth. I think I would try some red, and maybe green peppers in the mix, as well. 
The meat was absolutely fork tender as promised. The veggies were soft but not mush. I would like them a tad more al dente personally but there's not an easy way to add them later, since they need to be at the bottom. Now I'm just nitpicking, though. Cook this. You won't be sorry.

This was phenomenal! I used a boneless roast and sodium-free chicken broth. Then I added some quartered red potatoes toward the end. This is definitely my new go-to pot roast recipe.

Didn't use the bone in roast, but it was still absolutely fabulous!  We have never had such a tender, delicious roast beef before and our guests loved it.  They couldn't stop oo-ing and aw-ing over it.  Also, when serving the roast, I just poured all the broth, mushrooms and vegetables into a bowl and everyone ladled it over their mashed potatoes like gravy.  They thought it was better than gravy! Thank you for sharing your secrets, Chef John!  We love your recipes and when people compliment my cooking,  I always say, "I can't take credit.  It's another Chef John recipe from allrecipes.com!"  You're becoming quite the celebrity around here. :)

We used arm roast that was on sale. Other than that, we followed the exact directions. It's amazingly good!

quite possibly one of the best pot roasts I have ever tasted!  Will be making this quite often this winter.  We added a few medium sized red potatoes, which we cut in quarters.

Added Sweet potato also...hubby loved it! It literally fell apart and better than prime rib at a fraction of the cost.

Loved the way this came out. I used some different steak meat with not so much fat to go with the recipe but it turned out so tender and flavorful with the mushrooms. Didn't have the onion on me but will definitely try it out next time.

Loved this pot roast! I don't care for cooked celery so I left it out and compensated with extra carrots. I also omitted the mushrooms because my family doesn't like them, and finally, I used beef stock in place of the chicken because I had it on hand. This was a wonderful meal with lots of flavor and a simple prep. I will be saving this one to make again.

Absolutely the best Pot Roast recipe I've ever made.  Followed recipe as written except, did not have tomato paste so used tomato pesto instead.  Came out exceptional, added whole red potatoes last two hours of cooking.  Total cook time 7 hours on low used 3.5 lb. boneless chuck roast.

We loved this!  I accidentally put the whole can of tomato paste in instead of the 1 tablespoon it called for... tasted great, will probably put 1 can in from now on.   Will definitely make this again!

I used beef broth and red wine, as I didn't have any chicken broth - DELICIOUS!  Even my kids love this recipe.  The gravy and vegetables poured over the beef and mashed potatoes after...omg...

I also used my heavy duty casserole pot and put it in the oven on 250* for about 5 hours.

This my new fav roast beef recipe - thanks Chef John!

I think I cooked it a bit long (or maybe not long enough?); it wasn't falling apart tender. Not bad though, and the flavour was lovely. I look forward to leftovers tomorrow and will make this again.

I made this just as written and used a bone-in chuck roast. The flavor was great. The only thing I wish I could change is the amount of fat in the meat. You definitely need to skim fat off the top but can't get it all.

I love this recipe.  I do however use Kitchen Boquet with the salt and pepper when browning the Roast instead of flour.  And I use Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth.  I'm sorry, but I prefer Beef Broth with Beef dishes and Chicken Brith with Chichen dishes and the same with Vegitable Broth with Vegitable dishes.  Maybe it's just me, but I've never had any bad/negative comments.

This was a great recipe.  I fixed it for a large luncheon (40 people) ....appreciate the ability to change number of servings that adapts the recipe to how much of everything I needed.  Rave reviews from the crowd.  

Definitely have saved for future!

I have tried many slo cooker roast beef recipes but this one is the absolute best. I put small potatoes under the roast as well. I didnt have fresh herbs so I substituted Herbes de Province that I had crushed in my mortar to freshen the taste. It was outstanding.

Yum! My only suggestion would be to consider making this recipe ahead of time so that you can de-fat it after.  A gravy separator is helpful in making the gravy or meat juices less fatty.

I put in a can of golden cream of mushroom mixed with a cup of beef broth and a sliced onion for the bed of the roast. I seared the roast on all sides (coated with salt/pepper flour) before I put it in the crock pot and added the veggies about half way through.  I used small butter potatoes, carrots and celery.   Everything was delish!  Have some bread on hand for dipping in the juices!

I thought this was good (husband was not impressed), but this was a whole lot of work for something that really didn't taste much better than any other way I have done roast in a crock pot.  Like the addition of mushrooms, but if I made again I would simplify the first six steps, use less broth and cut the onion in larger pieces.

OMG! I don't normally like mash potatoes but this recipe is outstanding and I now LOVE mash potatoes! My husband who loves mash potatoes and claims to be a mash potato connoisseur, couldn't believe how good this is. Thank you Chef Johns, you did it again! The mash potatoes were like you said, light and fluffy and not gooey and nasty. Thank you!!!

TO DIE FOR! I omitted the mushrooms, I don't like them. I used chicken broth as the recipe called for. Used Trader Joe's Cabernet Pot Roast - added carrots and potatoes, a Lipton Soup Mix, a package of Betty Crockers Gravy mix, onions, garlic, frozen veggies and dried spices. Also thickened with corn starch. Cooked all day in slow cooker (added potatoes and frozen veggies in last hour). SO good. Next time I might leave out the gravy mix and add a can of cream of mushroom soup. Note to self: make this again.

I made the recipe just as suggested.  The taste was very good, but the meat was very very tough.  I checked it at 5 hours and left it in the crock pot for one more hour.  I was expecting a much more tender roast.

Very good meal, followed the recipe until the last few minutes.  Thought the taste was a little bland for me, so I added a tablespoon of wooster, which was more to my taste.  Will use again, but maybe add a few more spices.

Made this in the morning and turned it on for 7 hours at work. I used a boneless pork shoulder (on sale) and it turned out great! Instead of salt and pepper and herbs, I used a house sweet BBQ dry rub, and pasta sauce rather than tomato paste. When cooked, the pork pulled away so nicely and the sauce was great. Next time, I would try putting the carrots and celery in halfway through cook time, as they were a little soft to my liking :) made for great leftovers!

This has become my go-to recipe for pot roast.  Since I normally do roasts around 2-1/2 lb., but use the full sauce recipe, I have to thicken it with cornstarch after removing the roast to make the gravy (and add some Gravy Master, my secret ingredient). I use powdered spice rather than fresh - no problem. The one significant change I make is to use sherry (real sherry, not cooking sherry, which is too salty) as a substitute for part of the chicken broth; I much prefer this flavor to the results from using red wine.  Add the garlic; you'll get a burst of garlic smell which subsides after a bit as it blends; add the sherry as the first liquid, and you'll get the same effect - a burst of sherry smell which subsides as it cooks in.  Then add the chicken broth. If I'm lazy, I put potatoes and carrots in the cooker before the roast, with a bit more chicken broth as a starter, and cook them all; sometimes I'll dice an onion into the vegetables to add to the gravy.

So much better than pot roast recipes that call for mushroom soup, and packets of gravy, onion soup or italian dressing.  The only changes I made was omitting the onion due to a sensitivity in the family and seasoned the roast with Emeril's Essence spice (Food Network.) I made a roux from the fat I skimmed.  It made the most tender, flavourful roast and delicious gravy with a little kick.  A definite keeper.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  Cooked as written with the exception that I didn't have mushrooms and cooked in the oven.  It just seemed bland.  And the reviews are so good for this recipe!

Very good recipe.  I used a 3lb. eye of round roast and cooked it for 3 hours, which was great for the roast, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped. Per other's suggestions, I turned the juices into gravy (adding flour), and served it over egg noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. Really good meal, but needed something more- maybe just salt and pepper. I'll try the recipe again and try to improve it a bit.

This was one of the best pot roasts I ever made. The meat was so tender and flavorful, but the best part of the meal were the carrots. I served those as a side dish and even though I don't particularly like carrots, I found them to be irresistible!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe which is sure to be made often.

This recipe is really great.  It is definitely the best I have tried for Pot Roast, great taste.  I also added red potatoes, but did not add carrots, celery and potatoes until the last 4 hours of cooking in the Crock Pot.  They were perfect, not soggy.  Served it with a loaf of fresh French Bread used to dip into the yummy sauce that is made from the roast and vegetables.

Let me preface this review with a disclosure that I didn't actually eat the pot roast. I have been a vegetarian for 20 years, but my husband and children are a bunch of meat-eaters. They went crazy for this dish! Even my 2 year-old couldn't get enough of it. And I wasn't completely grossed-out making this recipe because I didn't have to do much handling of or cutting the meat, which says a lot. Searing the meat made a mess of my open-burner stove, but I might have used too much oil, as it splattered all over. Next time I make this, I will leave enough time to completely clean my stove afterward. Thanks, Chef John, for making me a superstar in the kitchen!

Super easy, I followed the directions exactly except I used a 2lb boneless pot roast.  My family and guests loved it.  I also added potatoes for the last hour.  Absolutely delicious.

This is one of our favorite meals.  Great recipe as written, and forgiving for those of us who never leave well enough alone.  I haven't tried a Chef John recipe we didn't all love, and this one is no exception.

Can also use Stew Beef. Add a splash of red wine along with the beef stock- SO good!

Excellant, awesome, the BEST! We all loved it.
Thanks for this recipe, making it again for dinner tonight to share with another family. Can't wait for what I know will be awesomely delicious meat. This time I'll shred it into chunks and serve in pretzel buns.

This recipe is excellent.  I used a chuck arm roast, and it was fall apart tender.  The sauce infuses a fabulous flavor into the meat and vegetables.   The only thing I did differently was used beef broth, not chicken, since that just seemed weird to me.  I will definitely use this again.

This was the best so far pot roast recipe I have made.  I added a can of 14oz dice tomato's instead of paste.  I also made the best gravy with the liquids after I took out all the vegetables and roast.  I shifted gluten free flour (Bob's Red Mill) and let it cook for about 15 minutes served over mashed potatoes ....Yum!!

Great recipe! Followed recipe, except due to preference, I used half beef broth and half red wine in place of the chicken broth. Very good flavor and tender as well.  Husband said it was one of the best he has tried.  It is a keeper! Thank you, Chef John

Made for book club and it was kind of dry and not as flavorful as I was expecting.  Maybe I used the wrong cut of meat?

I enjoyed this recipe but it was one of those things where I did not use measurements. I definitely used all the ingredients and added extra spices. I definitely have to try this again and write down what I did cause it was just right.

My family loved this. I also used a smaller boneless roast, but with the same amount of the other ingredients, so I had a lot of gravy to put on my rice. I also used beef stock instead of chicken broth as some people recommended.  I added chopped potatoes about 1/2 hour before the roast was done, came out great. The prep work takes a little longer than I expected, but it's well worth it.

Followed recipe minus the celery and it was delicious!  I'm not sure what the purpose of putting flour on the roast while searing it but I did it anyway.  i might skip that next time. I also added potatoes about an hour before it was finished which i definitely recommend!  My only complaint is that it was a little greasy so make sure you get as much fat off the meat as possible.
