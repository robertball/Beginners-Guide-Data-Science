IMPORTANT: don't use raw flour... it's easy enough to pasteurize! All you have to do is stick the flour in the microwave for a minute stir it up so it doesn't form clumps and and microwave it for another minute (2 minutes in total) this kills any bacteria that may be in the raw flour and makes this cookie dough safe to eat!!!

It is not the raw eggs that can give you food poisoning when eating cookie dough, it's the raw flour which was not made to be consumed without baking. The edible cookie dough you buy in the store is made with treated flour.

I didn't have milk at the time so I used water instead. I doubled the recipe, but not the sugar. Then, I used 3 tablespoons water instead of 4. It turned out perfect!

First and most important... removing  just eggs doesn't make any edible cookie dough  recipe "safe" . It's been in the news about raw flour and salmonella poisoning. But  it's super easy to  toast / bake raw flour and it also adds a nice flavor dimension. The fastest is to put 1 cup in a medium size fry pan and stir in medium heat for 5-6 minutes. The flour changes color slightly and you can smell the nuttiness . Raw flour is probably not one of the first things that comes to mind in regard to food safety but it can be just as dangerous as raw eggs. 
So as to changes... less salt and by all means experiment with other flavor chips. Personally I like using butterscotch  and chocolate chips.

It was amazing! I do have to say, you really want soft brown sugar, and softened butter. It makes it so you do not need to use an electric mixer, and everything is a lot easier. I really do like how in this one you do not need to put it in plastic wrap and whatnot. Also, put the flour in the microwave for one minute, then stir it, and put it back in for another minute. This makes sure that no bacteria is in the flour, and the cookie dough is safe to eat. It was all eaten in a heartbeat and we loved it!

Spread the flour on a baking sheet and bake it in the oven before use!! Or microwave like the other comment says. NEVER use raw flour for edible cookie dough.

This recipe tastes pretty good. I used it to make cookie dough bonbons and let it sit in the fridge overnight  before I rolled and coated them. This resulted in the "dough" getting very dry and made them very difficult to roll and coat. If I make these again I would either add more milk before letting it sit in the fridge or just roll and coat them immediately. Even though they were a bit dry, everyone at the party loved them!

Way too salty.  I baked my flour so that wasn’t an issue. The dough would be good if the salt didn’t over power.  I will search for a new recipe.

I made this to go in ice cream and was perfect!  I froze tiny pieces and added it to the ice cream churn just before freezing ... this cookie recipe is perfect because it has no eggs!

Very good. Somewhat unami taste, which was very much appreciated. I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave before putting them in. Simple change, resulted in a much more even distribution of sweetness. I initially halved the amount of chocolate, which was fine, but ultimately after slowly increasing, I deemed the best amount to be 3/4 cup. I also mixed by hand instead of by machine (I just like that part of the process). Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe, and I found the result to be very good.

It is made with brown sugar so it is sweet but not as sweet as with normal sugar. I'm guessing this route is healthier so maybe that could be an excuse to do brown sugar, however it does taste great and it is cool that you can finally eat cookie dough by itself

Perfect! So delicious!
I did follow the recipe, but had to sub in half regular sugar along with the brown.  I used what chocolate I had on hand which was a mix of chips, M and Ms, and dark and regular bars chopped up.  Just what you think of when you think of cookie dough!

The ingredient amount were accurate, i just needed to add a little more milk and it came right together. i also added some nutella to make it more chocolatey.

Delicious and super easy!! I did use raisins instead of chocolate chips though, since I didn’t have any.

Taste is good, very sweet.  But doesn't quite taste like chocolate chip  cookie dough. I never dreamed I'd say there's such a thing as too many chocolate chips, but there were. I should have just put in half and added more until it was perfect.  Be sure not to burn the flour when you bake. I only baked for 5 minutes but tasted burnt, so baked some more.

Waaaaayyyyyy too much flour in the recipe. I added an extra 1/2 cup of butter, 3/4 brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 cup of milk. You’ll end up with more dough but at least it’s edible.

I did the flour pasteurizing in the microwave which worked nicely, but warmed the dough when I mixed it, so I had to refrigerate it before it tasted better. Overall, the dough was good, just not as good as regular cookie dough. I also think that if you really like cookie dough it would feed more like 4 people instead of 8.

This was really good! However, it didn't refrigerate well... when I took it back out a few days later, it had become crumbly... oh well, cookie dough is still cookie dough! Was very sweet, my friends and I all loved it (and trust me, we eat a lot of it!)

Absolutely Delicious! I mixed it with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and made chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who likes eating chocolate chip cookies batter.

Made it about a week ago for my family of three, we saved over half- muched on it throughout the week straight out of the freezer. I didn't have mini chips, so I just used milk chocolate chips and some white chips. Also, because I have really great extract I only used a few drops. I also cooked the flour prior to making it and let it cool, it doesn't have to be treated flour- all they do is bake it, heat it. Heat it, let it cool, ta-da, you're done and it's safe for eating :)
The comment that "egg isn't the problem" is incorrect. Egg can pose problems, it can give you salmonella, even pasteurized; although pasteurized is in fact safer. "Food poisoning" no, not unless you cross contaminate with something different...

Anways, we loved it so much I am making a 4x's batch to take to game night with a group of friends.

I'm a hero now!
My son asked for this and it is a new favorite in the house. I looked up how to cook the flour and chose to microwave the flour until it reached a temperature of 160 degrees to kill any possible ecoli bacteria. Everything else was made exactly as written.

You could toast the flower in your oven for 5 minutes at 350 degrees. This can get rid if the Ecoli bacteria. I thought the consistency was a little more dip like but that makes it easier to eat it with a spoon. I let mine cool in the fridge so it could firm up a bit.

I made some changes due to not having chocolate chips and the one review that said it was runny. I used only 1 tsp milk, added 1/4 cup white sugar, 2 TBS cocoa powder, and did not add salt or chocolate chips. Turned out great! Like chocolate chip cookie dough when the chocolates are melted in.

I am no cook, but this recipe came out great!  I added white chocolate chips in stead of semi sweet and used it as a dip with graham crackers.  Wonderful!
