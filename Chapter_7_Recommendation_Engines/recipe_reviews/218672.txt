This is a great breakfast when you want something else other than the usual eggs or cereal options. It feels very satisfying and it being gluten-free is a bonus for us!  This will become of of our regular breakfast meals!

I thought this recipe was ok, maybe I have a bit of a sweet tooth but this was not very palatable. I added some brown sugar to taste. I also found the nutmeg to be a bit over powering so i would recommend maybe only a dash next time. This recipe has potential just needs a few adjustments.

I didn't follow the recipe to a t, but it was pretty good.  I forgot to get lime juice, so I didn't use that, and I bought precut peaches found in the produce section.  I should have used more peaches and probably used lime juice as well.  Overall, I like it and I believe it is a great way to use quinoa.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Spectacular, although I did make a few changes based on ingredients I had on hand.  I cut the nutmeg in half and then topped with Noosa peach yogurt.  Probably because Noosa has so much darn sugar, this really made the dish a pleasant kind of sweet.  We did drizzle honey on the yogurt but left out the lime juice.  I could have eaten two or three bowls of this!  My version is not as healthy, but it sure is delicious!

I love this.  Quick and easy. Simple to tweak to personal tastes (choice of fruit and yogurt).  I topped with some pumpkin butter (like apple butter) for 'fall' flavor.

First time trying quinoa and was skeptical...used can peaches in water as sub. for fresh due to season, microwaved vs stove top cooking due to time requirements..Looking forward to having it again.

This is awesome. I only added 1/2 the nutmeg and I used full fat plain greek yogurt, and I used some lemon honey to taste. I mixed spices and honey into the quinoa then mixed that with the yogurt  AND JUICY CHOPPED FRESH PEACHES!

This was very good.  I cut the seasoning in half, because my kids don't always like a lot of cinnamon.  I also liked mixing some honey into the quinoa itself.  I used two of the snack packs of peaches in juice, since I needed to used them, and it was still really good.
