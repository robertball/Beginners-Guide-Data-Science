This was one of those nights where I desperately needed groceries but didn't want to go. So I searched for a recipe that contained ingredients I did have and "wa-la" Pasta and Beans it is! A good start for a side dish but here is what I added/changed. I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil, drained and rinsed beans, tossed in the beans and a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Then I added the drained pasta (reserving a 1/4 cup pasta liquid) and tossed this all together. I sprinkled with a little extra olive oil, parm cheese, red pepper flakes and balsamic vinegar.  I served it next to Herb Crusted Chicken and everyone ate it very well!

After reading the instructions on this dish, I thought it needed a little something more.  I added italian seasoning while simmering, dropped in some spinach leaves once the simmering was complete (they wilt almost immediately w/ heat) & I included a few tablespoons pasta water (a tip I always see mentioned on the cooking shows).  I thought it was tasty and will likely make again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I love Italian cooking and cuisine and cook it often.  This was a simple, yet delicious and satisfying meal.  I doubled the entire recipe to make sure I'd have a lot of leftovers.  I also added some crushed red peppers in the sautee'ing process since I like food with a little kick.  This was wonderful!  Thanks Jen!

This is delicious as written.  Not all Italian dishes are seasoned with basil and oregano.  You certainly can add any spice you want, but this dish is great as written.  I seasoned "to taste" with salt, as the recipe directed, but then put black pepper and parmesan on the table so this could be added.  Definitely a kid-friendly dish.  Make sure to use fresh tomatoes, not canned.  Cook the pasta in some salted water, too.

Yummy!  Easy to make and delicious.  I made some very minor changes, but the original recipe was good.  I sauteed the onion and then added about 7 or so cloves of minced garlic.  I added salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and basil before adding the tomatoes to bring out the spices.  I chopped one tomato and added two cans of tomatoes with garlic, basil, and onion and 2 cans of beans.  I used whole wheat elbow pasta although penne would have been perfect.  When the pasta was ready, I threw in a bag of baby spinach and shut the heat off.  I took about about 1/2 cup of the cooking water and added it to the beans.  Drained the pasta, threw it in the pot with the tomatoes and beans and combined.  Fantastic and although I doubled the recipe and added a few changes, it was a delicious vegetarian meal that even the meat eaters loved.

Simple, healthy, but lacking something.  I have used a similar recipe that adds, garlic, lemon and sage. It is much tastier!

I liked this recipe....but I felt like it was a little bland..so the second time I made it I took some of the suggestions of the other reviewers...like adding spinach and parm and a little more seasonings...but this was a good recipe.

Good but very basic recipe, so adding your own twist is needed.  I added garlic to the sauted onions, as others had suggested. I also added cumin, chili powder, and crushed pepper, along with the corn cut from a leftover cob.  I used pinto beans (all I had, and I drained them first), and added one 15 oz. can of peeled tomatoes.  I served it with whole grain penne, and it was delicious.

I doubled this recipe and took it in a casserole dish to a pot luck. Everyone loved it, including my husband! The hardest part was finding the beans, but it was worth the extra effort.

This was a great, quick meal with things I had on hand.  I used dried minced onion instead of a fresh onion, and fresh grape tomatoes instead of canned, and threw in a few cloves of minced garlic.  My 6 year old ate 2 bowls of it and even the 2 year old loved it!  It's not the best thing ever but it's fast, cheap, and yummy.

Yuck.. Way too plain and simple. I did not like it so i ended up changing the whole recipe. I added celery, green peppers, salt&pepper, Parmesan cheese for topping and lots of tomato juice and kidney beans. Still wasnt great.

I omitted the onion and added diced, raw bacon to the tomatoes while they cooked.  I also added some shredded swiss cheese and parmesan at the end then tossed it to let it melt before I served it.  Oh yeah.

This was a good recipe to kind of play around with.  I drained and rinsed the kidney beans first, minced a few cloves of garlic and sauteed with the onion, and instead of fresh tomatoes I used a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (undrained) which added a little bite to the dish. Yum :)

this is a healthy, easy staple for me. needs a bit more flavor, so i usually saute chopped garlic with the onion, add some crushed red pepper and basil at the end, and finish with parmesan.

I didn't wanna go out and go shopping, so I was looking for a recipe that called for stuff I already had in the pantry- this was it. I've never used cannellini beans before so I substituted them for pinto beans and added spices to the mix. I went a little overboard with the spices (sadly) so I didn't really like what I came out with. However, the next day, I smashed the beans and added a little bit of chedder cheese to the mix which calmed down the spices. It was fantastic!!! I will definitely make this again. A fairly healthy meal that is actually tasty is hard to come by nowadays.

Nutritious, but very bland. I even like all the ingredients alone, and it still wasn't very flavorful. I even tried adding some fresh parsley, fresh garlic, and Parmesan, and it still was very meh until I salted it heavily. Perhaps it relies heavily on the salt from the canned beans to carry it? (I used dry beans I had cooked previously.)

Great recipe if you are feeling too tired to cook (10 minutes! to a healthy tasty meal thats got a bit of everything - protein, carbs, veg). I think you could add a few things to your liking and make it even better - I added garlic, a pinch of cayenne pepper, oregano, and some black pepper - I think with some parmesan it would be good also but I was out of cheese! Thanks for saving my dinnertime!

We found this very good, and great for a meatless meal.  Added sprinkle of ground red pepper, Italian seasoning, and some garlic from a jar.  Sauteed garlic last few minutes with onion.  Delish!  Thanks!

I took some of the suggestions in the previous reviews and made this work for me.  The fresh tomatoes made this authentic.  This was a great, hearty winter day meal.  I had it with a big salad.  My results didn't look anything like the posted photo.  Having lived in Italy for two years, I learned two things:  buy quality olive oil and don't overcook the pasta.

I used red kidney beans because it's all I had on hand -- would have been better, creamier and prettier with white beans though. While the recipe was good alone, next time I will add a small amount of tomato sauce to it as well as I prefer my noodles coated with sauce a bit more. I added some red pepper flakes to my serving (some spicy-food-haters in the household) and that sure took it up a notch! Might add some parm next time. Will make again.

I used this recipe as a springboard to use some ingredients I had on-hand when I returned home late one day and didn't have time to make the roast I had planned for dinner.  I used 1 can canellini beans, 1 lg can diced tomatoes, 1 onion and a box of penne rigati pasta.  I threw in some basil and garlic powder while it was cooking.  My family enjoyed it but we agreed it was missing something, not sure what but I'll be playing around with this one again just because it was so quick, easy & fairly healthy I would assume.  All in all, it saved the evening and we have enough left over for hubby to take for lunch tomorrow too.  Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

This was good.  I think the two cups of pasta is the already cooked amount.  I cooked two cups dry and it was way to much.  I used a can of garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes in place of fresh.  Served with parmesan cheese on top.  I would make this again.

It was good, but to make it even tastier. Sautee some bacon and crumble it up then add to mix, also add parsley, bay leaf and a splash of white wine.  Red onion is also good to use.

Needs some added spice.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and a tablespoon of oregano.  Nothing can beat this for a FAST and healthy meal at a bargain price!

I doctored this up a bit, added some spinach, used some garlic powder...all I had in the cabinet was rotel, lol!! but all in all a nice simple but filling! I also drizzled some olive oil over the whole thing. This is my first time with cannellini beans, tasted them briefly at a friends house and fell in love!

Sometimes it's just about getting down to the basics, and like what others said, using what you have on hand. This recipe suits all of the above - and is wide open to so many other additions. I will make this again!

Good basic recipe for when you are in a pinch and can't make it to the store or are low on funds. Please doctor it up and add spices, or cheese, it needs something to make it better.

This was very bland.  It does need extra spice.  Also the beans went mushy, so don't cook them too long.  If I were to do it again I definitely would take the advice of some other reviewers and add garlic and seasonings.  Also, canned chopped tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano would be a good substitute for the tomotoes.  I wonder if I was supposed to drain the beans.  Usually you do, but this recipe doesn't specify.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, however I did add more spice to it.  To the oil and onions I added 2 gloves of garlic, finely chopped.  When it was time to put in the beans I added some fresh ground black pepper, salt, and some of the "emeril lagase" seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes. 

The beans provided a kind of "buttery" flavor, and the extra seasoning added more depth.  I might make this again... Beano might need to be added in the next batch...

I tried this recipe last night and my kids said it was a keeper. The only thing I did different was to saute a little garlic with the onion because we LOVE garlic.

Used the recipe as a head start with pantry ingredients: bowtie pasta & a can of diced tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic. Proceeded with recipe & topped it off with a handful of fresh grated parmesan. Delicioso!

I made this last night with farfalle pasta, cannelloni beans, onion, red and green peppers and some mushrooms.  I didn't have tomatoes so I used diced organic fire roasted tomatoes in a can. It was unbelievably good!  We all went back for more. Thanks for sharing this!

I loved this! So simple and I always have these ingredients on hand.I added a couple small cloves of minced garlic. And really, you can use this as a great base recipe and easily customize to your liking.

Great base, but lacked flavor. I let onion and garlic sauté in a bit of olive oil and seasoned them with salt, black pepper, red pepper, dried basil, dried oregano and dried rosemary. Once fragrant I added two cans of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of cannellini beans and 1 TBS of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. I let this come to a bubble and then simmer on low for 15-20min while I cooked the pasta. I tossed it all together once the pasta was drained with some fresh chopped parsley and Parmesan cheese.

You can make an even easier version of this by sauteing some onion in olive oil adding black pepper and a can of Campbell's pork and beans then adding cooked pasta.  I use elbows. It's pretty much the same thing but alot quicker.

Perfect for a summer dish. I added 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp capers, juice from 1/2 lemon, handful of spinach and 1/2 tsp oregano. Sprinkled with parmesan. Family loved it!

Although I am a fan of simple meals, this recipe was bland without some additions.  I added minced garlic, red pepper flakes, chopped fresh sage and basil.  Serving it with freshly grated romano cheese made all the difference.  With the additions, it was a tasty dish.
