This was AMAZING! We loved it! Just the right amount of heat and the lime added the acidity it needed.. Perfect combo. I used 1 pound of shrimp for 2 of us. The sauce was just the right amount for 2 servings ( I only used enough cooked pasta for two of us). If I were to make this for more than two I would DEFINITELY adjust the recipe accordingly and double or even triple the sauce. No one wants dry pasta.

Fairly easy to prep. The requested amount of Sirachi resulted in a fairly spicy shrimp. If you have a mixed quest list use 1/2 and put the sirachi as a side. The shrimp provided a nice sauce which we thickened a bit and mixed into the spaghetti. Definitely a keeper in our menu
