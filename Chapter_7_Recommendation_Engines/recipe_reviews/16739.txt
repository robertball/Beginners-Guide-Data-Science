I love the dressing!  I mixed and matched veggies, but the dressing is what really makes this tasty.

Liked the salad, but did not like the dressing at all.  3T of mustard combined with 3T of salad dressings & brown sugar is not a mixture I'm going to try again.

I really like how this salad looks with all the bright vegetables in it.  I made a few changes:  I boiled the carrots and broccoli with the pasta for the last two minutes to brighten them up and make them a little more crisp-tender.  I also added some fresh basil and extra balsamic dressing because I thought it needed a little more flavor.  Overall, I liked the recipe.

This was wonderful.  Very easy to make. I used a pesto type dressing.  I would make this again.

I found this recipe last summer when I needed a meatless salad to take to a barbecue for some vegetarian friends.  Luckily for me, I had made a large bowl because everyone there absolutely loved it.  I had to share the recipe and have been making it ever since.  I LOVE the dressing and have been using other combinations of vegetables but the dressing is what makes this salad!  Thanks for sharing it.

This was a total flop!  All you could taste was the Dijon.  Perhaps the brand we used, Beaver, is just too strong.  I had to rinse all the salad out in a colander and then just squirt some Italian dressing on it.  The veggie and noodle combo was fine, but the dressing ruined it all.

I didn't think this was so great.  It was dry. I made an extra batch of dressing the next day and it didn't seem to help much. I doubt I would make it again, but if I did, I'd leave out the peas and probably the broccoli....too many vegetables made it look kind of unappetizing.

Very good.  I took this to a picnic and it was very popular.  The dressing is great.

Loved this!  A wonderful light-tasting pasta salad.  Will make this often for summertime bbq pot-lucks.
