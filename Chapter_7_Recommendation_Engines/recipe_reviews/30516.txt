This recipe was faster than the time shown. I simply added the chicken to the brine for an hour
and spiced it up and then placed it on the grill! The depth of flavor was incredible and I was able to make
it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts without the breasts coming out dry!

Chicken has great flavor & very tender. I cooked it in the oven, so I also added liquid smoke & 1/3 cup olive oil to seasonings. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe - we soaked it in the brine for an hour as recommended and covered it with seasonings.  We had excess seasoning so we added the rest of a bottle of beer and basted the bird several times while cooking.  The breast of the chicken was SOOOO tender and it cooked all the way through.  I even had to use a 4 pound bird - all I could find - and it was done in the time specified in the recipe.  Definitely something I'll do again.  I picked off the rest of the chicken and will use on nachos!  Thanks for the recipe.

this chicken was so wonderful!  being winter in PA i did not have the option to cook  it on the grill, so i improvised with the slow cooker and the chicken was so tender it was completely falling off the bone.  i just rubbed the chicken with the spices and put the brine ingredients into the bottom of the crock pot.  i also added some whole red potatoes which had amazing flavor and were perfectly cooked at the end of 8 hours on low.  great dish!

I made this in the oven w skinless/boneless breasts adding a touch of olive oil as someone else suggested. Baked it in a covered dish w a bit of the brine(which wasn't necessary but gave a lovely marinade for another dish") ). I didn't have any liquid smoke so I added a tsp of Chipotle Chili Powder for it's smoky flavor. My husband RAVED about this recipe and what's more he went back into the kitchen to serve himself every bit of what was left! Thanks!

This was wonderful! I left the chicken in the brine for two days because things kept coming up and I just didn't have time to grill. My hubby was pleasantly surprised and really loved the flavor and juicy, tenderness. I will definitely do this again.

I used the spices in this recipe to season a standard beer-butt chicken. My entire family raved about this.

Great recipe!  The chicken was moist and tender.  I followed the directions exactly.  I was worried that it was going to be a little spicy but it wasn't at all.  The combination of spices was really good!

This recipe was GREAT! I ended up using more beer than called for because I used a craft beer and it was too early to be drinking. HA! I used 24 ounces of beer in the end. I also just used a package of legs and thighs that I already had instead of a whole bird and left this brine going for two days because we had things come up. It was big hit with the family so I'll be making it again.

Wonderful flavor, easy technique. However, I can't figure out why the recipe calls for "divided use" with the chili powder, so I used the full 2tbl. in the seasoning mix.

This was good, but needed a little more seasoning for my taste.  It turned out very tender and juicy.

Juicy - moist and the rub was great on the outside.  The inside tastes like.....chicken.  I cut a whole chicken in half - brined as directed.  I thought the spice mixture might be too much but I added it all - to both side of the chicken.  Grilled indirect (low) for about 1 hour  30 minutes.  A nice spicy crust but the chicken itself was ....well, just chicken.

We had this for a family dinner, and everyone wanted at least seconds, some 3rds!  I pretty much followed the ingredients, however I fixed it in the oven.  It was delish!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved the brine, made the chicken very juicy.  I halved the recipe and used it on breasts.  Next time I would use a different seasoning, too much curry for my husband and me.

Pssst. I will tell you the secret to this recipe. 

Add a little olive oil to the spice rub. Then gently pull the skin away from the chicken. Rub the spices UNDER the skin as well as on top. The chicken will be super flavorful and the skin will be nice and crispy.

You're welcome ;)

So moist! I used boneless skinless thighs and baked at 375 for 40 minutes. Great for St. Patrick's Day.

Chicken had a very good flavor.  I found that even on a very hot grill, this took way longer than the suggested time.

Great recipe. The rub is ingredients I wouldn't have normally put together. If you are a wimp (like me) it's a little too spicy. My family is not so wimpy and loved the little bit of heat.

Will absolutely make this again. I made it with chicken breasts and they turned out super tender.

I did feel like this recipe got more flavor into the chicken than the tipical beer-can-chicken method.

Everyone Loves this!!!!! I cater for a living and I have used this base of a recipe in many applications. It works everytime. I recommend serving this with some sort of yogurt sauce (cucumber dill etc)on the side. I love using boneless thighs on the grill because it will be juicy and delicious. I recommend braising the chicken in a citrus beer like a summer shanti or Corona. Enjoy people!!

I did this exactly as called for with the addition of some liquid hickory smoke. I also used chicken legs only and they came out fantastic. Used the chicken for chicken and dumplings and they were so fantastic.

i used the brine but ended up with my own spice on chicken because i found out i was out of cumin and did it in oven with potatoes and carrots on top was very very good.
