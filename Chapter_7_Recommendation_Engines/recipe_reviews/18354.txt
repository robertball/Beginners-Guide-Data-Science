Very good pie.  Next time I will use a pre-cooked pie crust.  I did discover that it's worth the extra trouble to get out the mixer for merangue.  Takes too long by hand.

A fun twist on classic lemon meringue. The recipe was a bit unclear...I ended up not using a pie crust! It was still good though, and I used a berry/lemon drink instead of just lemon, so it was pink and my daughter loved it!

If I am reviewing wrong forgive me. I made this pie it is excellent if you reduce the sugar and use real butter instead of margarine and use lemon zest instead of the flavored drink powder. ( Whats REALLY in that stuff anyway?) I made 11 of these for my cafe and found I liked it without a crust better and it needed to be chilled thoroughly to cut right. ( Im using a pie slicer sprayed with a small amount of oil but I still think with a knife this pie needs to be almost freezing to cut well for presentation. A good recipe but needed a few changes. Thanks!
