These were really easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly, using the foil baking liners and filling them 2/3 full. They puffed up quite a bit during baking, so I was worried about how I was going to get the cherry pie filling to stay on the top, but as they cooled they shrunk back down quite a bit, leaving a nice little well in the center for the pie filling. I made these for a Christmas party and everyone seemed to enjoy them. The only thing I'd do different next time is leave out the nutmeg. It really overpowered the "cheesecake taste" of these goodies, almost giving them an eggnog or custard-like taste, so I really think they would be alot better without the nutmeg. Overall a great recipe though -- Thanks! :)

I have made this recipe before only use a Pecan Sandie for the crust instead of a vanilla wafer - it makes for a much tastier dessert!!

These little cheesecakes were a huge hit! These are so simple to make, they are so cute and taste wonderful! This recipe is must to make, especially for a party. Everyone wanted the recipe. I will definatley make these again!! If you use the "small" muffin pan, you can get 72 mini cheesecakes, I did. I used bite size vanilla wafers for the muffin cups, the regular size don't fit and added sugar to the cherry pie filling. If you follow the directions they'll turn out perfect.

YUM!  This recipe is a definite keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added an extra teaspoon vanilla and omitted the nutmeg, based on other's reviews.  Don't worry about using the vanilla wafers... the whole thing was delicious!  I served with Comstock blueberry, peach and cherry on top.  Beautiful presentation.

These are soooo easy to make!! I doubled the vanilla and added a dash of salt. I didn't use the nutmeg and substituted with finely chopped lemon peel. I topped with cherry pie filling and a slice of mandrine orange for presentation. I'm tempted to make a chocolate version with an Oreo cookie instead of vanilla wafers...stir in mini chocolate chips and top with chocolate ganache and a swirl of white chocolate (leaving out the lemon peel or nutmeg in cheesecake for this one)These are marvelous to play around with..and great to eat!!! original version is 5 points on Weight Watchers!!

I also used graham cracker crumbs to keep the "traditional" cheesecake flavor.  A big hit, beautiful presentation with the cherries on top.  I found I had to bake them a little longer than the recommended time, but it was no problem.  I'll definitely keep this one around as a great, finger food style dessert.  Thanks!

I first made this recipe about 25 years ago for a girl scout baking contest, lol.  I was looking for something quick and easy and bite-sized for dessert and I remembered these, hoping I'd find the recipe here and voila!  I left out the nutmeg and added a little bit of lemon zest in its place.  I also find these "fit" best when you put the cookie in bump-side-down.  Don't worry if they don't go all the way to the bottom of your muffin tin--the wafer will soften during baking and it will sink.  (If you use Reynold's foil mini muffin liners, they're a little too big for mini muffin tins anyway and they actually work perfectly for this recipe.  Again, no worries that they don't hit the bottom of each muffin cup.  It's okay!)  This recipe makes at least 44 (not 24, the way the recipe states) and I always fill the cup with filling.  It collapses after baking.  Thanks for this oldie but goodie!  Nice to have these back in my recipe box.  :)

Used chocolate chip cookie dough for crust, cooked dough about 7 minutes and cooled before filling.  I would leave out the nutmeg and maybe add a little sour cream for extra creaminess.

I made these for a family get-together and they were a big hit with young and old alike!  Didn't have a single one left to take home, and I found out later that my brother had even "hidden away" a couple of them before they were gone to take home with him later.  I made half of them plain with cherry pie filling on top, and the other half I folded  mini chocolate chips into the batter before baking, and then topped them all with whipped topping.  A very quick and easy recipe, and quite yummy, too!

This was good.  My mom used to make these all the time for us when we were younger.  There is nothing better than coming home from school and being able to eat one of these for a snack.  The nutmeg was a little too overpowering (read reviews after making).  Will make again, but reduce the amount (or might leave it out all together).  Thanks for the post.

Good but next time I would not use the nutmeg (or maybe half of the amount) Also, I would use the mini muffins because the cheesecake is too big for one vanilla wafer if put in a regular size muffin pan.
Thanks for recipe

This recipe is great!  It opened my eyes to easier cheesecake making.  I rarely make cheese cake because of the time, cost and leftovers. I was able to mix up the ingredients before the oven got to temperature.  I left out the nutmeg and instead used 1/2 tsp. orange peel and 1/2 tsp. lemon peel.  I froze them in the muffin pan overnight and put them in a freezer bag the next day.  The day of my party I put chocolate topping on them 3 oz semisweet choc melted, 1 tbs. melted butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup whipping cream. Mix the chocolate, butter, and sugar in mixing bowl. Slowly beat in whipping cream until you get spreading consistency.  I'm going to try using some of my favorite cheesecake recipes and cook them in the muffin pan with different cookies (Oreos & thin mint).  I used both mini vanilla wafers and regular sized vanilla wafers (in their respective pans).

These came out great!  I made over 300 of them for a large catered event.  I did leave out the nutmeg.  For a convection oven, cook at 275' for 13 minutes.  I topped with sliced almonds, lemon filling and zest, toffee crunch and drizzled chocolate, cookie crumbs, mini chocolate chips, holiday jimmies and swirled chocolate.  I can't wait to make these at home with the kids, they're gonna love them!

A great dessert to have in the freezer for drop in guests! I've used pecan sandies and Girl Scout shortbread cookies for the base, both with good results. I would also recommend the following variations...omit the nutmeg, double the vanilla, add 1 tsp lemon juice, use 1/3 less fat cream chese to cut down on calories (not fat free). Use foil baking cups, or spray with non-stick cooking oil and place directly in muffin pan.

These are delicious and easy.  They are best when made in the aluminum muffin liners instead of the paper liners.  I removed the liners for presentation.

These are very simple to make and very eye catching as well as versatile. I went by the recipe exactly but omitted the nutmeg; overpowers vanilla and takes away from cream cheese. I added two simple extras for added taste and texture, after placing wafers i made a small batch of graham cracker crust w/butter & grams mix until crumbly...sprinkled gram mixture on top of wafers, filling in around its edges (1 tsp-1 1.2tsp) i aslo topped my dark sweet cherry topping w/some Natures Valley 100% Natural crunchy granola bars OATS 'N HONEY-crumbled up in ziplock bag then sprinkled on top.

Very easy and delicious! I omitted the nutmeg as suggested and added a little more vanilla. I also thought the sugar was too much so I only did 3/4 cup. I added cherries on top and everyone loved it. People took them all home!! They were delicious little treats. Maybe next time I will add a little bit of lemon for more flavor. The vanilla wafer worked great for me! Everyone thought I made an actual crust =)

This is so easy and they turn out so cute! I might mix the cheesecake mix in a blender or something next time because the consistency wasn't the smoothest when I did it myself. I added only a dash of nutmeg as well and reduced the sugar. I used various fruit preserve and fresh fruit as toppings as well as a dallop of whipped cream and finely chopped nuts or sliced and toasted almonds drizzled with dark chocolate and white chocolate. You can be really creative with these. I usually box 4 beutifully presented cheesecakes into a fancy little box to give to friends on birthdays and they love it!

Good desert for a party!  The only thing I'll probably change next time is to try something different for the crust.  The vanilla wafer didn't cover the whole crust, and also got a little soggy.  I wonder if a graham cracker square would work for a crust?  I'll keep messing with the crust...the cheesecake itself turned out great.  I added mini chocolate chips, melted carmel, and drizzled chocolate over the whole thing for a pretty presentation.

I cut this recipe in thirds, which may have been the cause of the texture that wasn't quite smooth enough for me.  But the good news:  I didn't have vanilla wafers, but I did have...SHORTBREAD GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!  They made the most incredible "crust."  I'll use them for many other desserts that call for a graham cracker crust from now on.  You should try it!

These were great!  I use graham cracker crumbs instead of cookies - about 1 1/2 tbsp - and pushed it down firm with my thumb.  I found that the mixture made 20 mini cheesecakes, not 24.  I also added extra vanilla!  Yummy! Nice job Sue.

This recipe is excellent.  The batter has a nice consistency.  My recipe only made 20 cupcakes, double for a large crowd.  I topped them with Pollander All Fruit - Black Cherry.  Delious.  Next time I will freeze some.  Thank you

Took others advice and left out the nutmeg. I also used light cream cheese and 3/4 cup of sugar. The blueberry pie filling is sweet enough so you don't even notice. Didn't know what to expect with using the light version of cream cheese, but they set up just fine for me. I did bake them about 5 minutes longer, but worth it to make them a bit lighter.

My mother used to always make these for parties, I loved them but never got the recipe.  When I found this, I immediately made them for a gathering of friends.  They were great!  I also topped my cheesecakes with small mandarin orange slices and blueberries.

We made these, but made them in miniature muffin pans, baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  Based on reading the other reviews, we also omitted the nutmeg & used 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla.  They got rave reviews at our party.

I personally didn't like the strong nutmeg flavor of these cheesecakes. They were also difficult to eat - the vanilla wafer crust was overly soggy, they stuck to the cupcake liners, and the cherry pie filling on top was extremely messy.
However, they looked very festive for Valentine's Day.

Yummy!!!!!! Followed the recipe to the letter except for the nutmeg. I, too, used extra vanilla instead. This recipe yielded 24 regular-sized muffin cups. I topped them with cherry pie filling and they made a cute and convenient dessert. I used foil baking cups and served them right out of the cups. This would be excellent for a party or potluck.

I can't believe how easy these were to make.  I made them for a friend's wedding and they were devoured within minutes!   I left out the nutmeg.  I added lemon curd on top with a very small slice of fresh lemon and a mint sprig.  They were beautiful and delicious!  I would definitely make again.

I've made these for years and have never used nutmeg.  Instead I add lemon juice, not extract, just the juice.  I also line my muffin pan with cupcake liners to contain all that yummy stuff!!!

ABsolutely delicious! The first sign was when i tasted the batter (awesome!) I reduced the recipe by thirds, and it made six good-sized cheesecakes. my husband and I ate all of them in one sitting. I used cherry pie filling and a little more vanilla then the recipe called for. The only thing that was bad about this recipe were the wafers. They turned out brittle and greasy- kinda gross. We just ate around them.

I made these for a graduation party and they were a hit. Didn't change the recipe one bit and they were great.  However, I wasn't sure on a lot of things and thought I'd add for those who may also be unsure.  You should use the mini cupcake pans and liners.  An entire vanilla wafer can go in either way (makes no difference).  However, the entire wafer won't be flat.  In order not to have any dead space, I pressed down hard with my thumb to break the wafer.  It allowed the wafer to sit on the bottom and more cheesecake on top.  There will not be a lot of room left for filling.  I filled mine to the top and it was fine.  They rise just a bit in the oven, but don't stick to the pan because they recede upon cooling. Upon getting out of the oven, they will look cracked and not so great, but as soon as they cool and you put the cherries on them, they are beautiful.  Mine made way more than 24 mini cupcakes, one batch of filling made over 75 and there would have been room for a couple more, but I ran out of wafers.  Maybe it's 24 servings?  3 per person?

This was by far the best little cheesecake for a crowd! Incredibly easy and sweet to eat! I followed the others advice and doubled the vanilla, but omitted the nutmeg. I did have to bake for 25 min..but that may just be my oven misbehavin. Easy to freeze so I didnt have that to worry about when needed. I will be using this recipe forever. Everyone loved them! Thank you!

Love this recipe... easy & tasty!!
Definite keeper!!  I just put the paper cups into a regular muffin pan and dropped a vanilla wafer into each one.  They turn out fine.  I also omitted the nutmeg.  No leftovers just lots of compliments!

The yield on this recipe was way off for me.  I followed it to the T.  I got 11 and 1/2 mini cheesecakes!  I filled the muffin cups a bit over half full, using a 1/4 cup measuring cup.  Dont know what happened, but they were excellent.  I used the nutmeg, reading the reviews while they were baking, and I agree it is overpowering. Will not use it next time.  But hey, I have 11 and 1/2 eggnog tasting mini cheesecakes!

This are excellent and so easy to make!  The only thing is that the vanilla wafers don't exactly fit in the muffin cups.  I might try crushing them first and then putting them in next time.

Simple cheesecake recipe that you can't really go wrong with, good but not great.  I used low-fat spreadable cream cheese and there wasn't much of a difference in taste.  It's an easy way to cut down on calories without having to change the recipe.  I ditched the wafer idea and made mini pie crusts using the Healthier Graham Cracker Crust(http://pie.allrecipes.com/AZ/HealthierGrahamCrackerCrus.asp) recipe on this site and put them into large muffin pans.  A little dessert I can take to work.  Delicious!

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  When you need something quick, universally popular and to feed a small crowd in a hurry, this is it!  I am going to try it again, next time in my mini muffin tin, with a variety of toppings such as caramel sauce and apple pie filling (and maybe even a little sprinkle of nuts!) or kiwi and fresh peach and strawberry, etc.  Like little elegant petit fours but much tastier and way simpler.

I made these before but had lost the recipe, I'm glad I was able to find it again.  These are the best.  I make them for parties and for my co-workers to gobble up.  It's also a wonderful recipe that children can make or help with with yummy results.  Thanks for sharing Sue.

Made these in cupcake paper cups and served them at a social. The vanilla wafers I bought were too small, so I had to crush them and then add some melted margarine to make it bind. Found a small enough glass to press the crust down instead of using my fingers. Also added a tad more vanilla as I was using imitation. Each cup took 1/4 cup of mixture. Even the mixing bowl tasted good. So fast and simple and inexpensive.

Very yummy!  This made 22 1/2 reg. muffin pan sized cheesecakes for me.  I used organic chocolate crushed wafers (without any butter) for the crust putting about one rounded teaspoon in each.  I also added crushed Easter m&m's to the cheesecake as well as an extra 1/2 tsp of organic vanilla.  I topped them off with a bit of shaved dark chocolate and 2 cadbury's mini eggs.. I used paper muffin cups with easter designs on them :)  I also used splenda for the sweetener, though i may try something different next time... maybe even maple syrup!  They cracked after only 16 min in my oven.. with the thermometer reading 300F in the oven!

I used the mini muffin papers and tins, and found the vanilla wafer did not fit.  So I ground up the vanilla wafers in my food processor and melted some butter and made a vanilla wafer crust instead of switching to graham cracker.  Skipped the nutmeg though.  These were excellent.  Great recipe.  Family went nuts and so easy to make.

I have used this recipe for many years and it's always a hit. I omit the nutmeg. Instead of canned pie filling for a topping, I use seasonal fresh fruit (blueberries, sliced strawberries, kiwi, thin sliced Meyers lemons, etc.) or shaved chocolate. Topped whipped cream (or reversing the order and putting the whipped cream on, then the fruit), they make a very special treat. For a casual get-together I have presented the cheesecakes plain and in small bowls, set out an array of toppings so everyone can have fun making their own creation to enjoy.

This is a great recipe. I followed other poster's advice and added an extra tsp of vanilla and left out the nutmeg. I also made a graham cracker crust since the wafers are too small for regular muffin tins.

This didn't come close to my mother's cheese cake. The nutmeg really gave these mini's a bizarre taste and the wafers tasted funky too. The one good thing about this recipe was that the texture was just right.

it was extremely simple to make, i had fun doing it! but i'd reduce a bit of the nutmeg next time, 'coz it kinda overwhelmed the taste of the cheese. nevertheless, it was really delicious; most people who tasted it was surprised that it's not from a bakery store!

These came out very stiff after refrigeration and lacked the punch, maybe due to the lack of milk or sour cream. I've made cheesecakes before and they came out delicious. But sorry, not this one. I'll stick to Chantal's NY Cheesecake.

I get requests for these cheesecakes all of the time, especially around the holidays. I usually get 18 cupcakes out of the batter, filling each cupcake liner using a 1/4 measuring cup. I also cook for 23 or 24 minutes instead of the recommended 20 minutes. I put a cupcake pan with water in the rack below to minimize cracking. Make sure your cream cheese is a room temp for smoothness. I didn't have any nutmeg and used 1/8 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and it turned out delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly as listed and had no regrets.  The Vanilla Wavers are absolutely fine as a base and the cherry topping is probably mandatory.  An absolute hit at the potluck.

They were delicious.  I followed others advice to omit the nutmeg and filled the cupcake holders 2/3 full and it was perfect.  I used graham wafer crumbs for the crust and swapped out the white sugar for brown.  I did only 1/3 of the recipe and got 24 mini cheesecakes of which 12 were in slightly bigger cupcake holders.  The only ingredient I didn't third was the vanilla; I used 3/4 tsp which was just nice.  Easy to eat these bite-size cheesecakes as they were light and not too filling.

I'm giving this 3 stars because of the amount the recipe says it makes. I wanted to get 4 dozen so I doubled the recipe. After I made 4 dozen I still had a bowl full of batter! I ended up making a 9x13 cheesecake too! I decreased the among of nutmeg as well. I only used 1/4 tsp. In the double recipe.  Otherwise, they were delicious, just like I like them.

Really disappointing. Followed recipe but omitted nutmeg based on other reviews, and doubled the vanilla. These still had no taste and were dry. Didn't seem like cheesecake at all. I would definitely not make this again.

I omitted  the nutmeg and doubled the vanilla. I also mixed in crumbled Oreo cookies for my brother-in-law that isn't a fan of fruit toppings. Next time I'm going to try crumbled thin mints.  These are always a hit!

Not bad at all.. Could be better. Love the muffin idea though. That part was good. Could be more cream cheesey.

Just OK..they looked nice for a holiday dessert table but the taste was not overly exciting.  Easy to make, definitely omit the nutmeg,maybe add some vanilla.

These are so good. Cute and Yummy!! I grated a dash of nutmeg, instead of 1/4t...we couldn't wait so we ate some after they cooled but before we chilled them...Good, but MUCH BETTER after chilled.

These were simple to make. And they were good to eat. I made them for Thanksgiving dessert. Everyone liked them. Everyone was either saying that they weren't too sweet or they weren't that cheesy. All great reviews!
