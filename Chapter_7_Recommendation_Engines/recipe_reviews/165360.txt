I love these little guys! (And so do my dogs:) Sooooo healthy.  If you freeze them in small Dixie Cups with popsicle sticks, here's a trick I use to catch the melting drips: Save those plastic lids from Pringles cans.  Cut a small slit with a sharp knife just long enough to insert the popsicle stick in the center of each lid.  Cover the Dixie Cup with the stick down the center of the puree.  When the pop freezes, the lid will form a drip barrier.

These were great for a fast throw together ice pop the night before one hot day. I used low-fat strawberry yogurt poured into little dixie cups and used "tongue depressors." Easy for little kids to handle.

My kids loved these!  I made them with strawberries too.  To make them a little sweeter I added a little jam to sweeten.  My niece was visiting and isn't crazy about trying new things so I "glittered" them by adding some colored sugar crystals before putting them into the popsicle molds and she was quick to dig in when they were frozen.  A healthy treat for kids who love treats like Go-gurt!

This was so simple!  I didn't have peaches, so I used nectarines.  Wonderful way to cool off on a hot day.  I'm going to try it with strawberries tonight.

This is good, but I liked it better unfrozen as a treat. The freezing made mine  way too hard and lost its "creamy"ness. Maybe because my yogurt was fat free and my peaches were with pear juice instead of syrup. I neeeeded some honey for sweetness too. Nice for a light  treat.

we used plain whole milk yogurt instead of vanilla, and it definitely needed more sweetener! so i guess my 3 stars reflect my substitution, but we didn't like these at all. my 21-month old son didn't want anything to do with them & he ate a fresh peach instead.

it's a good recipe especially when you live too far from your favorite frozen custard's franchise,(you know what i'm talking about?) just subsitute some softend vanilla frozen custard, for the yogurt.

So easy and delicious in the summer.  I had a whole box of peaches to use and was looking for something new and fun to eat and enjoy with my fresh peaches.  The worst part is blanching and peeling the peaches, but then my son helped me puree them and mix together.  We save some of the yummy mixture to eat unfrozen, too, but we freeze several in the tupperware molds or the push-up molds.  Use the "light" nonfat yogurt for an even better lo-cal treat!

A yummy (and healthy) treat!  I bought a 1/2 peck of peaches from Michigan to make some jam, and had some left over.  I made some fresh and froze some for making during the colder months, too!  Did the same thing with my blueberries from Michigan, too!

My niece loved these! I added blueberries I wanted to puree the blueberries into the pops but...... We put them into Icecube trays and they turned out perfectly although the peaches were a little tart we drizzled honey on them when we served them!
YUM
