Why anyone would use ground beef for this recipe and then rate it I don't know. Followed recipe just as written. Loved it.

I will give this recipe five stars even though my puff pastry was not golden on top ( I think I did not thaw the dough properly and maybe oven temp). Other then that they were amazing! I made them for a mediterranian christmas party and they were gone before anything else. I made a taziki sauce and a mediterranian red sauce for dippers YUM! FYI do not substitute for beef like the other rater Lamb and Beef taste completly different and the spices will seem wierd with beef. :)

OMG this was the best thing since the invention of the fork!  Pretty much followed the recipe except I used a half pound of lamb and made the 18 wedges with a tad left over!  Go figure. This is a good tip about using puff pastry. Do not bear down on the edges as it will not puff up as well. 
Roll with a light hand and reduce pressure on the edges.  I also baked at 400* @ 15 minutes. I do have a convection oven so that might make a difference in performance.  This is definitely a keeper!

Made a few changes based on what was available and taste(s):  used ground beef, 1 onion, 1.5 Tbs ground ginger, 3 cloves chopped garlic, and 1/4 tsp of cumin and cinnamon.  Omited cardamom. Looked really nice and tasted great.  Since I used 2 onions less than the recipe called for, was probably a tad more spicy than intended..but we liked it.

As is this recipe was not great. The proportions were way off. Three onions to one pound of lamb?  Unless everyone else was using ridiculously small onions, each off my onions yield about a cup. I used one onion (or one cup of onions). I used a jalapeño because our store did not seem to have green chili peppers. The spices and taste of the meat was excellent. Unfortunately my next problem came with the pastry sheets. Cutting them into nine squares made for a very small bit of dough that definitely did not even fit a tablespoon of meat in. Not a single one of my triangles could hold shape. If I try this again I will cut the sheet into quarters so each triangle can actually have a decent amount of meat and close up properly.

Giving 4 stars only because the filling was about twice as much as I could put into the puff pastry. This was tasty, especially with a little sour cream to cut the heat (I used jalapeño peppers, so mine were pretty spicy), also used some Garam Masala in place of the individual spices just because that's what I had on hand. I will make it again, but buy more puff pastry next time.

I could not find the paste at the store so I took garlic cloves and fresh ginger and minced it together.  I did need to cook for about 20 minutes, the family enjoyed these “meat pies”.  They were a little more work than I usually so for a weekday meal.

I had to add more seasoning for flavor, but it came out well enough that my family loved it.

Fantastic!  They were devoured in minutes....  Had a lot of the meat mixture left over; could have probably made at least another 9 if I had more puff pastry.
