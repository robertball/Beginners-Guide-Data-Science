Interesting recipe. The soy sauce works well the the egg and the water/sugar combination makes the omelet light and fluffy with a touch of sweetness.

I might scale back the sugar next time, but other than that: this is how I'm cooking eggs for now on. It tastes just like the egg I've had on katsu don.
