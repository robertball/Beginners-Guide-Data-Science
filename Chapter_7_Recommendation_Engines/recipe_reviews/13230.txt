This is the quickest and best french onion soup I've ever tasted! I add 5 soup cans of water to bring down the sodium level and add 2 Tbls. of cooking sherry or you can use white wine vinegar!  it's a very good recipe and very good tasting!  I use croutons and mozzarella and provolone cheese to top it of in the broiler.

WHen I first made this recipe I thought it was really salty.  I tried low salt/low fat broth.  Now it tastes great and is better for you.

Very Good!!
I used 4 14.5oz cans of broth(2 of each) and added 1 cup of mushrooms when I sauted the onions. Also added 1 cup of white wine.  Au Jus packet gives it a great flavor, also added a dash of worsheshire sauce.  Next time I'll try it in a crock-pot. Highly recommend.

The problem with this recipe is that it calls for CONDENSED broth WITH NO WATER TO DILUTE IT. Try swapping regular broth (not condensed) and it will be FAR less salty (or better yet, use low-sodium broth and add salt yourself to taste).

I came looking for a recipe that used au jus because I had some left over from making the "French Dip Sandwiches" also found on this site. I will look no further! I replaced the beef broth and the au jus packet called for in this recipe with the leftover au jus from the crockpot recipe. It was a little salty, but I think that's because I used regular soy sauce instead of reduced sodium. I'll fix that next time and I expect it will be perfect! My best friend and I loved this, and my husband even took to it and he's never really cared for French onion soup. SO YUMMY, and you'll have two delicious meals with minimal preparation! THanks for a great recipe!

I did a couple things different than the recipe.  I didn't fry fresh garlic I just used pre-minced garlic out of a jar.  I used a beef bouillon cube with the suggested amount of water.  I also used low sodium chicken broth.  Next time I am going to use more onions then the recipe calls for.  I made croutons with the "Garlic croutons" recipe on this site.  I made them pretty big for a nice covering for the soup.  My taste-tester is a big onion soup fan and he gave it five stars.

This wasn't a bad base French onion soup. I did change it a little. I omitted the garlic because I was out. I found that it was really salty so I diluted the mixture a little with 1 of the empty broth cans of water and added about 2 tablespoons of sugar. Turned out great with awesome reviews.

This recipe was ok. It was extemely salty. Also, preparing the garlic was a bit of a pain. If you are looking to make a better "quickie" french onion soup, combine a can of condensed french onion soup mix undiluted with a packet of dry onion soup/dip mix and add water and/or beef or chicken broth.

So much flavor! I loved it! I added 1 cup Mushrooms to the large green onion while being sautéed. Plus 2 Tbsp of cooking Sherry and a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture.    I thought this turned out very good!!

Just made this for supper. YUMMY! It was very simple and VERY delicious. After reading the other reviews I took their advice and added some water along with the broth so it wasn't as salty. I think you could taste it before putting it in the oven to make sure it is to your liking and adjust if needed. The only other changes I made were to use french bread slices instead of croutons and mozzarella instead of swiss. (only because of personal preference)

Thought I would try this soup as I start eating real food again. This was so so salty that I couldn't eat but half of the bowl. It is 2 hours later and I am craving water! I quartered the recipe and this was pretty good. Thank you.

5 stars for my husband's raves alone! LOL. French Onion is his favorite soup and he had TWO bowls of this for dinner. Slight changes to the original recipe on my part. I put in 2 onions, used 1/2 tsp black pepper, 3 tblsp butter, did not fry garlic and used low sodium non-fat broths. With health issues, I had to bring sodium way down. Thanks so much for this recipe. He's already informed me I'll be making this again. :)

Kudos to the poster of this recipe!  This was the absolute BEST French Onion Soup I've ever had . . . The au jus was just magnificent.  The cheese was delicious.  My fiance loved it.  My neighbor even ate some.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Quick(ish) and easy. The longer you let the onions caramelize the better, of course - up to an hour (but it just requires patience, not much attention). I replaced the beef broth with cooking sherry, though if I had beef broth on hand, I think it would have been more authentic. I am going to try this on my mother - wish me luck!

how delicious!  a new favorite in my household.  the smells of this soup cooking, alone, is worth the small effort.  the only thing i did differently was change everything about the original recipe that i'm rating.  the original recipe didn't look good to me so i changed everything about it, talked about how good it turned out, then gave it 5 stars.  i hope this review was helpful.  idiots.

This was great!  I modified mine, based on what I had in the cupboards.  I did not have the au jus packet so I added 3 cubes of beef boullion and 3 of chkn boullion.  Also added garlic w/out searing it, and also a pinch of sugar.  Then, used toasted french bread instead of croutons.  After soup was done boiling, I added 3 oz. of cooking sherry, and that improved the flavor.  Used 32 oz of beef broth and 12 oz chicken broth (both UNcondensed).  SHredded the swiss chese, and it melted perfectly.  LOVE this good base recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Good recipe, and the speed factor is a plus.     Lower in butter than most, which I appreciate.   A couple of things I want to mention:

If you read the labels on the au jus mixes, you will find that there is a tremendous variation from brand to brand.  This may have something to do with the saltiness issue being reported.  In some things, brand names are superfluous, but in something like this, it makes quite a difference.  The choice of croutons will also make a big difference.

I think it better to use grueyere cheese and to shred it, rather than slice it.  

Thinly sliced onion rings may be traditional, but  messy and difficult to eat are also traditions with French onion soup!   I find large dices to be easier to negotiate.

Super good.... you don't need the au jus mix it makes it a little too salty...Added 1/4 cup or more of red wine for a great taste. Also added 3-4 cloves of minced garlic. If no oven safe bowls are available you can just put the cheese on top of the soup and microwave it in separate bowls. Very tasty and simple.

My dad makes the best French Onion Soup that takes ALL DAY LONG. I have very high expectations of what this soup is suppose to taste like. IT WAS AMAZING. I made it exactly the way the recipe said. Everyone that says its too salty, I think is crazy. It had so much flavor! And flavor is what makes it good! I will be making this many times in the future! Thank you so much!!

Delicious easy to make soup.  Next time I make it I will 1 or 2 more onions as I like lots of onions, though the basic recipe was very good with only 1 onion.

It's become a staple in our house! Absolutely love it!

I sweat the onions to make prep time faster, and use two (14oz) cans of beef stock, 1 can of reduced sodium chicken stock and 10-16oz water to reduce salt flavor.

This turned out delicious but too salty.  I did not make exactly as stated because I could not find au jus gravy mix anywhere in the grocery stores.  I tried to make my own au jus gravy mix.  I sauted minced onions in butter and then added some flour to coat onions and slightly thicken au jus.  I then added beef broth, cooking sherry and worcestshire sauce.    I know that au jus is made from beef drippings but since I didn't have any this was my best alternative / guess.  I also substitued the croutons for toasted french bread slices and used provolone cheese instead of swiss.  Next time I make I will use low sodium broth and it was way too salty.

This was really good and very easy to make.  Ny husband who doesn't like to eat soup because it doesn't fill him up didn't even eat his salad.  He was too full, I guess this one is very satisfying.  I'll make this one again for sure.

Very tasty! I did add some water so it wasn't so salty, and I prefer my cheese mixed in, so I just put it on top at the end and let it melt.  But overall absolutely delicious!

This is one of the better soup recipes here. Much of it comes down to what type of onions you use, however.  Personally, I went with sweet Vidalia onions,  swapped the portions of beef and chicken broth, and added a quarter to a half cup of vermouth for flavoring.  Came out great.

I added a roue of yoshida sauce and flour and a few tbsp sherry. Needed 3 onions for that amount of liquid. Didn't use the au jus gravy pkg.  Yummy

I think I've messed up this review a few times... But here's what I did. I thought it was a great recipe, I just did a few simple things different.  I sautéed 2 large onions in 2tbs butter in a cast iron (ceramic lined if you're interested) Dutch oven. I did take a long time sautéing because I wanted them to be really caramelized to maximize the flavor. I have skimped on this before and I think it's SO much better if you really take the time. I threw in the garlic cloves at the end of that to get a little sauté on them. Being that I cooked the onions so long I wanted to deglaze the pan with something I had read on another recipe. It actually said bourbon or cognac but all I had was Crown Royal so I went with a 1/2 cup of whiskey. It deglazed, I got added flavor, and it cooked off super quick so didn't really add much time to the recipe. I then followed the recipe exactly only added a bay leaf and some extra water but not a whole lot because it wasn't THAT salty in my opinion. I used French baguette and mozzarella because that's what I had and I loved it. Turned out great and I really loved the au jus addition which I wouldn't have thought without coming across this recipe!!! Good stuff! Thank you

Yum. I added an additional onion and followed other's suggestions and added 1 tsp of worcestershire sauce and 2 tbsp of sherry cooking wine. Fanastic! My kids love onion soup and I haven't found a recipe I've truly enjoyed, until now. Thanks for sharing!

Have made this four times now and have received rave reviews each time.  Only adjustment I made was adding 1/3 cup of cabernet savignon to the broth. This one is a keeper.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this soup.  I used about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder rather than fresh garlic and low sodium beef broth and it just turned out fantastic.  I will definitely be making this again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I followed the directions exactly, except I added a tiny bit of red pepper for my boyfriend. He's not happy unless his nose is running. It was fantastic!

great soup i altered it a bit by adding one cup water to take salty taste away and when i caramelized my onion rings i added brown sugar i also used squeezed garlic instead of fresh and minced up more onions with it to get it brown later you could also bake it in the oven on 350 for awhile.
