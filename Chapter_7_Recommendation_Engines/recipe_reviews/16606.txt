This recipe gets 5 stars for taste, but only 3 for clear instructions. The instruction assume you know how to make a roux. Luckily I did so it was easy enough. I added two cloves of garlic to the roux...yummmm. I steamed the spinach, and used that water to make the roux, but it was not enough so I also added enough milk to make the 1/2 cup. It was GREAT! next time I might add some chopped onion. Garlic and onion make just about everything wonderful!

this recipe has the basic ingredients to get you started, but it needs a little half and half to get the cream flavor.

Thank you for uploading a recipe using fresh spinach and a roux! Almost all of the recipes on here just microwave frozen spinach and add fat free milk (bleck!). I doubled the amount of spinach and added a few crushed cloves of garlic to the butter when I was melting it to make the roux and about 1/2 cream after the roux had thickened to make it a bit creamer. You can also add 1 cup diced cooked artichoke hearts (or even the kind packed in water/oil) to make a spinach artichoke dip. Instead of garlic it is also really good with some nutmeg to make it taste Swedish.

I make this with a small package of frozen chopped spinach. Drain after cooking and make my roux with a little more butter and flour. Until a creamy consistency,then salt and pepper. Should cook roux a couple minutes to get rid of flour taste. It is pretty good. Thanks Terry

This was very tasty.  I made a couple of changes, after reading the other reviews.  First, I steamed my spinach in vegetable broth and used that in my roux as well.  I also added a tsp of garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm only giving this three stars because to me, this wasn't the creamed spinach I'm used to eating. Where was the milk or cream? I kept reading the recipe thinking that maybe I just wasn't seeing it. After I made my roux I added milk to the pan, stirred until thickend and then added in my spinach.

I had a craving for creamed spinach, and I have never made it before so wasnt sure what to look for in a recipe.  I was craving something along the lines of boston market creamed spinach, so maybe its because I was wanting something specific that I didnt think this was great.  Kind of bland, I did saute some onion in the butter before making the roux, but would like a little more flavor.  Definately edible, just not memorable.

As far as creamed spinach goes... this is the best creamed spinach I've had. However, it's still creamed spinach. :)

This was met with mixed reviews. My husband and I couldn't even swallow our first spoonful (yuck!), but our 2 yearold couldn't get enough. He finished his, then cleaned off our plate as well. I'll make this again......for him.

This really wasn't bad. Spinach was on sale for dirt cheap so I had a bunch to cook up. I found this recipe to be tasty and simple, maybe a little runny but I guess that's how it's supposed to be? Boyfriend ate it, but he wasn't raving or anything. I would say spinach lovers will like this, and spinach opposers most likely will not. Will make again if I have hordes of spinach in my fridge again! :)

I really hate to give this such a low rating but honestly it is so bland and the instructions well are very poorly written. I have no idea how to make it better. After cooking I tried others suggestions and nothing helped. Thanks for sharing but this ones not for me. May just be my taste buds as most everyone else seems to love it.

I gave this four stars because I made  adjustments based on other reviews.  It is a good base recipe, but it needs a little kick, a little cream, and slightly better directions.  I benefit from knowing how to make a roux so that helped.  I boiled the spinach, about a pound for 4 minutes, without bothering to take off the stems.  I let that drain while I melted the butter in a pan, added garlic and a dash of nutmeg, and then the flour.   Instead of water I used half and half for that creamy flavor.   Once it thickened I added the spinach and then topped it with parmesan cheese.  I put the final product under the broiler for a minute to give it a nice brown top.  Everyone at the table loved it, even my 7 year old.  I will definitely be making this again.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but this was not what I would consider a traditional creamed spinach as it was lacking anything resembling creaminess. It was rather bland and just tasted like cooked spinach.

It’s a great base recipe.  Also works just fine with frozen chopped spinach.  I did make a couple of changes because I like a more distinct flavor.  I added minced garlic and onion to the roux before the spinach and sprinkle with a bit of shredded Parmesan once plated.

Great start for a basic recipe. I only needed a single serving so I adjusted the ingredients and added a little diced onion, chestnuts, shredded parmesan cheese and cream to the rue before mixing with chopped cooked spinach, delish!

Easy basic recipe, good as written, and an excellent starter recipe for your own personal touches.
