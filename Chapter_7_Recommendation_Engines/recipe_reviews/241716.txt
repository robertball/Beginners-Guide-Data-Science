We very much enjoyed our dinner, and we have some leftovers!  That's good for us!  I used a package of Costco organic chicken breasts that I cut in half horizontally and did not pound out.  I cut the other ingredients in half, and they were just right.  I used panko crumbs, and I used 2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier on top.  I do think that 25 minutes at 350 would be too much for what I made, so if the chicken were to be pounded out to 1/4 inch, I wouldn't want to bake it for that long.  As it was, I baked mine for about 15 minutes at 350.  We will definitely have this again, and I'd serve it for company any time!  Thanks, NANNYMM!

This recipe is excellent! I might add that if it were possible this one rates 10 stars! I never change anything the first time that I make it & I can not see that I will make any changes. It is outstanding as is!
One lady complained that it mentioned the wine twice, the #1 was to make the wine sauce & #2 was to tell you when to add the sauce...both times were necessary! The other complaint was that it did not say when to place the lemon slices on the chicken nor when to add the lemon juice.  You add the lemon slices after you salt & pepper the chicken in the baking dish & it tells you to add the lemon juice & broth simultaneously after scraping up the bits & pieces.
I'm 80 years old & my daddy & "Mama", my grandmother taught me to cook. The first thing they taught me was  "if
using a recipe, take the time to read ALL of it slowly, then make sure that you have everything on hand, take your time, always follow the recipe the first time." I would like to add that food should always be prepared with love, many people are so into fast food that they think cooking should be as fast as fast food. NOT SO! There are recipes can can be rushed but never do a recipe as excellent as this one without taking the to do it right! My thanks to NannyMM & her mother for this excellent dish!  Margo

Oh, boy! This lovely chicken was served to three generations, and everyone said this recipe is a keeper. I was too lazy to pound the chicken, cutting the breasts in halves instead. The orange liqueur added another dimension I didn't expect. I forgot the lemons, but I'm sure they would have boosted the flavor even more. I served this with risotto on the side. I would be proud to serve this to company! Thank you for a terrific recipe!

For 6 servings: Using 1.5 - 2 lbs thin breast pieces, I soak the chicken in milk for a few hours. I combine 1/2 c cheese and 1/2 c breadcrumbs in a bag, and heat less than 1/2 c olive oil until very hot in a saute pan. After draining the milk, I toss the chicken in the crumb mix and I fry the chicken briefly on each side, then add to a greased dish. I top each piece with a thin slice of lemon and prepare the sauce. I leave a small amount of oil in the pan, to which I add 1 c wine, 1 c chicken broth and 1/4 c lemon juice. I bring this to a boil and reduce it by about half. I add the sauce to the dish and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees.

This is an absolute winner.  The flavor and tenderness were exceptional.  The only modification I made was using the whole can of chicken broth and adding extra wine.  I alway made sure each piece of chicken received some Grand Marnier.  The only other advice I will give is do not over cook (people tend to cook chicken too much).

So simple to make and almost restaurant quality
I think there is an error in recipe because mentions use of wine twice but not when to add lemon. Added lemon juice after bringing to a boil . Will be a go to recipe for me. Loved it !!

I agree with another reviewer. Tasty, but it is a lot like Lemon Chicken Piccata with more work. There is a GREAT recipe for Lemon Chicken Piccata added by LemonLush that we have made several times!!

I made this tonight... It was delicious!  The only thing, well 2 things I couldn't find in the recipe where to put the 1/4c lemon juice so I just squeezed some juice into the sauce and I left off the brandy. Thank you for the recipe.

This was delicious. It was similar to piccata, but the Grand Marnier really gave it a different flavor. I requested that my husband make it again pretty quickly after he made it the first time. I suggested using panko to make it a little crispier, but the chef said no :) Thanks for sharing!

I for the most part followed the recipe.  I added the lemon juice to the wine and broth reduction.  I did not have lemons to lay on top of the chicken.    I was too light on the Grand Marnier.   I will definitely make this one again!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is one of my favorite meals to order out and I'm so glad I tried this recipe. My family LOVED it!!!! Chicken was tender and flavorful and super easy recipe. Only changes are I followed others and added 1/4 cup more broth and wine for more sauce and added a tablespoon of capers as I was cooking down the sauce. It also doesn't say when to add the lemon juice so I added with the wine while cooking down. It's a 5 star recipe!!

Excellent. Very easy. Only four stars because I didn't know what to do with the lemon juice and the white wine was listed to add twice. I would make again and now that I know about the small ingredient issue it I'll even be easier. Tastes great

This recipe is a total keeper!!!   I was so thrilled with how simple it was, yet how amazing it tastes AND it's so presentable with the lemon slices on top.   I wouldn't hesitate for a second to make this for a dinner party.    It literally came out looking exactly like the cover photo, which is actually pretty rare.   Definitely pound the meat out to an even thickness.   I even sliced the thicker portion of the breast in half so it would be thinner before I started pounding.  (Sometimes if you pound a thick piece too much, it disintegrates).    I made the recipe exactly as printed, no modifications and the amount of lemon flavor in the sauce was just perfect.   Frying in 1 cup of olive oil seemed extreme to me.   I probably used half that and still had oil leftover in the pan.  There does seem to be a typo in the recipe.   Where is says "Add white wine and chicken broth", it should say "add lemon juice and chicken broth".  This was just sensational!!!!!

This is a MUST TRY recipe!  My family and extended family raved about it - they even loved eating the crunchy lemon (which I have never tried).  The only change I made was to use 3 packets of Costco's chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, because that's all I had on hand, and it turned out to be moist and deliciously flavorful.  I will definitely make it again!

I have a question.. you fry the chicken in 1 CUP of oil? That's more like deep frying, right? Do you think this would work with just a few tablespoons in the pan? 1 cup just sounds like SO much...?

It was really good. The only thing I thought it was too much lemon flavor for me.  I will make it again, but I would add half the lemon juice than the recipe calls for.

I am not a "lemon" type for savory dishes - never squeeze it on fish or chicken, but I tried this recipe anyway because the photos  looked so good. This chicken was awesomely incredible. The breading stayed intact, the chicken was moist and tender, and the resulting sauce was delicious! A really easy recipe that produced a restaurant quality dish.

There is no mistake in this recipe, you have to read it all the way through.  It tells you exactly when to add the lemon, and how to proceed. The only thing I did was to cut back a bit on the Olive Oil, by about 1/4 cup, and it worked well.  I do think this is even better than what I've had in restaurants.  Will definitely be making again, and not just for company!   Thank you nannymm !

This was so good.  I used the thin sliced breasts so I didn't have to cut them in half or pound them.  My kids said that it was a little too lemony, so I'll probably just reduce the amount of lemon juice or omit the lemon slice on top next time.  I also cut the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in half.   I'm glad I did.  The breasts were covered with the mixture, so if I hadn't, I would've thrown a bunch away.  I also didn't use a whole cup of olive oil.  I used just enough to sauté the breasts (may 1/3 to 1/2 cup).   I served it with egg noodles and spinach.

This was very easy to prepare and tasted delicious...nice and lemony.  The only thing I suggest is to make sure you saute it till its crispy so it doesn't get too soggy in the sauce.

This is a great recipe and I made it exactly how it was posted with the exception of pounding the chicken, I just cut it in half. I make this often.

This chicken recipe caught my eye. I had most of the I cedianta on hand except the white wine and I made it anyway. I used red wine but the white definitely makes more sense. The chicken was moist and delicious and I look forward to making it again with all the listed ingredients. ;-)

Loved this recipe!!!  I have a chicken piccata recipe that is super easy; so wondered whether this was worth the extra work. Hands down this is wonderful and worth the extra effort.

I think the recipe as written is pretty spot on; other than the confusion of when to add the lemon juice.  I added with the chicken broth.

This is really good .  I  had  a Rising so I used that . I didn't  have  lemons so I skipped  that part. I  added lemon juice to the sauce , although didn't  say what to do with it. My coating  wouldn't  stick  to  the  chicken, but other than  that  it was good. Will make  again .

Very nice recipe, even without the white wine reduction.  Made if for my wife then two days later made it again but doubled the recipe so we would have plenty of leftovers.  Wife raved about it to my daughter so now she's wowed by it as well for the fancy Italian restaurant quality taste.  Used regular Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons of dried parsley, and served on a bed of pasta, along with peas for color. While I did slice the chicken breasts, I didn't pound them the second time...much easier.

While this is similar to chicken piccata, the difference is, I hadn't ever seen a recipe for it where you cook it in a lovely sauce in the oven after browning it, and boy oh boy, did that ever make the chicken tender and juicy! It just melts in your mouth. Thank you for posting what will now be one of my favorite recipes of all time.

My son, who is a super picky eater, picked out this recipe. I almost tried to talk him out of it because I thought it was too much effort.  I am so glad we tried it.  I didn't have any lemons in the house, but other wise I made it exactly as written.  Yummy!

Sooo good!! I think I will just drizzle lemon juice on chicken breasts before baking instead of lemon slices and not use the orange liqueur next time. It was a little too citrusy for me. Other than that it will be added to our regular family menu!! It paired great with some angel hair pasta and roasted asparagus. Bon Appetit!!

The only differences was that I did not use the orange brandy and I cut the pieces of chicken into large nugget sized pieces.
This was absolutely delicious and my husband and I loved it!

This recipe is fantastic! One of the times I was planning on making i I had run out of lemons so I used a lime instead. Turns out lime is also excellent on it.  be sure to try it that way.

A year ago I started cooking dishes outside of Hamburger Helper, Spaghetti, and dishes anyone can make.  I use All Recipes as a great resource for excellent dishes, reviews, and to experiment.  This dish was by far the best I have tried so far.  Awesome flavor!!  It takes longer to make as you are multi tasking quite a bit to make everything come together in the end.  This recipe is restaurant quality for sure.  Try it.

The chicken was good but I made modifications. I used less wine and more broth, less olive oil, and I cooked it about 15 minutes longer. All the breading came off when I browned the chicken so I just scraped it out of the pan and put it on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. Overall taste was good.

The flavor for this recipe was very good....not too strong, not too subtle.  Just right!

I doubled the amount of wine and broth the recipe called for, and thickened it up with some water/cornstarch.  We like to pour some of the sauce over the pasta we served with it.

Definitely will make this again.

This sounded like a good recipe.  I think the problem for me was after marinating in milk, the recipe makes no note of drying the cutlets before breading.  I am an experienced cook and should know better.  However, the result of not drying the chicken was a soggy chicken breast which, in spite of all the oil the recipe calls for to brown it never really made it to crispy as I had hoped.  Maybe it’s one of those recipes that is good but can be made better by a creative cook.

This  IS a restaurant quality meal! Instead of plating over pasta I made the All Recipe "Mashed Garlic Cauliflower" recipe. Incredible meal that all raved about. Will definitely be making this again and it is a recipe that is great to make for large group dinners.

I prefer chicken cutlets instead of a large breast.  Less cooking time. I use more lemon,  and I really believe bone-in broth is far superior to regular chicken broth

Delish! Followed several comments& mixed bread crumbs with panko. I would strongly suggest double or tripling the sauce AND once it boiled (the broth, the wine, the lemon juice) I would not reduce it by half or at all. It reduces in the oven & I had zip to spoon over my pasta. I think it will cook down in the oven to a nice sauce as it cooks uncovered. I also would quarter the lemon slices just to make it easier to eat. I like the little extra burst of lemon with a bite of chicken...maybe it's decoration(?) If not, the rind is pretty hard to cut after cooking. I tossed my pasta with olive oil & butter & some herbed garlic salt. Clean plates!

I have been making this recipe for many years. It is definitely a family favorite...one of two that my adult daughter always asks for when having dinner with us. I follow the recipe as written and have never had a problem or complaint. For those who say they don't pound the chicken, please do it next time!! It does make a difference in the texture of the chicken.

This was outstanding. I used Parmesan cheese instead of pecorino Romano to use up what I had in the fridge. I used a Moscato wine. I used a little less lemon than the recipe called for as my fiancé doesn’t like a strong lemon flavor. The chicken came out so moist and had a delicate, but rich flavor. It was very easy to make yet it’s delicious and elegant enough that I could make it for company. Absolutely loved this recipe!!!!

Excellent flavor, didn't have pecorino romano so used parmesan (think was a little salty), also cut lemon juice
in half would cut cooking time to 20 min.  I cut as others
recommended chicken breasts horizontally in 1/2 and
did not pound.

Very good - I cut out the lemon slices and use lemon juice. I also put ham on top before putting it in the oven, and sometimes I top that with mozzarella - super yum.

really good! didn't have orange liquor so skipped it. added mushrooms to pan drippings with a little oil and sauted them then added wine, lemon juice and broth. I think soaking the cutlets in milk and pounded makes the difference they were so moist and delicious!

LOVE this recipe!  The flavors are balanced, smooth and delicious!  I didn't have the Grand Marnier and used a sprinkle of orange peel on the chicken under the lemon before baking...I'm sure the original recipe is superior, but mine still tasted great.  I actually put veggies in the sauce as it reduced to accompany the chicken.  The kid that doesn't like vegetables ate them and thought they were good!  One kid didn't like the veggies or sauce...I think she didn't like the wine taste, but she still loved the chicken.  We will keep this in our rotation...thanks for an excellent recipe!

I followed this recipe to a T, almost. Perfect. Though my wife suggested a slight bit less lemon juice. Used triple sec instead. Can't complain because every bit I cooked was eaten.

I was looking forward to this meal based on the reviews. My issue was I have never had Romano cheese before so had I realized that no one in our family is a fan of it then I wouldn't have bothered making it. It stunk up the whole house and I gaged when taking a bite. No one ate anything-we threw it all out. My suggestion for beginners is to make sure you like the flavour of this cheese. I've been trying to make new dishes for our family and didn't know what Chicken Francesca is like but went with it. I'm sure this is a great recipe for that but not something my family likes for flavour. Also found that the lemon juice really soured the dish too much!

I've made this twice-- once for my family and once for company. It is lemony, flavorful, and delicious! A lot like chicken piccata but without the capers. 

Tip for thin-sliced chicken breasts: partially freeze them first (or start from frozen and partially thaw them). It's much easier to slice cleanly and evenly this way.

I also didn't bother to soak the chicken in milk, nor did I add Grand Marnier as I couldn't justify buying a whole bottle of it just for one recipe. Also, dried parsley actually works better in the breading than fresh parsley. Next time I make this, I'm going to try dipping the chicken into a beaten egg to see if that helps more of the delicious breading to stick!

I was very disappointed with this dish.  I did everything as per the recipe called for except use "1 cup of oil".  I used about 4-6 table spoons of oil to saute the chicken.  I have no idea why  this recipe calls for 1 cup of oil.  I followed the directions and when it was done, I had the most horrible looking sauce.  It was brown and yellow-green.  Right away, myself, my husband and my younger son didn't like it but my older son scoffed sit down.  When I tried it with the grand mariner (a tiny drizzle)  It didn't make it any better.  I really can't complain because in 10+ years I never cooked an allrecipe dish that was this disliked so I consider myself lucky.   This website has provided me with amazing meals to feed my family with and I'm so grateful.

I very much liked this recipe, although I did a few things differently.  The Chicken Breasts I buy are really large, so cutting one was sufficient for two.  I  discovered that I was out of bread crumbs, so I ground up about 1 1/2 cups of dry Stove Top Stuffing, the rest I fixed the same but I omitted the Grand Marnier because of the Stuffing mix and its flavor, instead I enjoyed it while the chicken was baking.  We both liked this dish and I'll fix it again the same way!

I cooked it as instructed but I did not have the liquer to  add.  It made a beautiful presentation on my Sunday dinner table which is always more special than the rest of the week, to me. My family enjoyed it and thank you for sharing it with us. I will make it again soon and share it with my sisters.

The breadcrumb mixture didn't stick very well to the chicken for me. When I made it the second time, I just sprinkled the mixture over the chicken in its pan and baked it that way. Worked out well. Both times were absolutely delicious :)

Wow, I made this tonight and it was really good! The only thing I added were some capers (about 1 tbs) because I like that saltiness .  Excellent recipe and I didn't think it was too time consuming.

The next time I try this  I will use 1/2 cup of white wine id any. It could have been the wine I bought since I don't really drink but it was too strong a taste even when adding all the other liquids. I did not use the grand marnier since it smelled like there was enough liquor taste in there already. Overall, if it wasn't for the strong taste of wine it was good. If anyone can help me find a good white wine please let me know.  Thanks

I made this but my family said it needed garlic. I loved it, however, the way it is with this exception; I added roasted red peppers to the chicken before putting it in the oven. It added a good flavor. I will make this again soon!

It was very tasty. My husband and one son liked the flavour. My other son thought there was a bit to much lemon. I didn't have the liqueur so can't comment if that makes or breaks the dish. But the lemon/wine/stock combination really works in this dish. The Chicken was very juicy.

Making this tonight, sounds really good. People get really crabby about altering recipes and then giving mixed reviews...Which I get to a degree, however, common sense says if u hate some component of a recipe, don't add it! My complaint in this recipe has nothing to do with the recipe...It's the people who clearly did NOT read the recipe close before leaving reviews. Geeezzz

Great! Would definitely make again. As other people mentioned, it doesn't say when to add term lemon juice but it mentions adding white wine twice sooooo typo? I love how the lemon on top soaked into the chicken and gave a great citrus flavor. Next time we make it, we are going to put it on pasta. Has a chicken piccata feel to it. Yum!

Very flavorful. This chicken stays moist and tender. The bread crumb crust keeps the sauce from sliding off. Very tangy with the stated amount of lemon, I'd probably use Meyer lemon next time.

This main course was terrific!  I cut the recipe in half since it was serving 2 people.  Still had enough left over for another meal for 2!

With my hubby and I both prepping, it still took 45 minutes to get it ready to cook!  Worth every minute!  Next time I would add capers to the sauce.

Was an absolute hit! Making it again this weekend for friends. I also added Limoncello to the sauce which made it a little sweeter but gave the sauce more depth. Was amazing the next day too! Served it with a basic risotto and fresh basil.

I could not find where to use the lemon juice! It is in ingredients but  could not  find its usage in the actual recipe. Nevertheless, very moist and very tasty.

the taste was really good - I had trouble keeping the bread crumbs on the chicken and not on the pan!  I also don't see where you add the 1/4 cup of lemon juice - is that a typo?  I'll try it again - perhaps my oil wasn't hot enough.

Chicken was extremely tender and tasty. Followed recipe exactly. Wife loved it, My problem was must of the bread crumb mixture came off in frying pan so next time I will go from milk to flour then egg and breadcrumbs.

The only thing I did different was after soaking in milk and dredging in bread crumb mixture didn't seem like enough stuck to chicken...so I second dipped in egg and dredged back in mixture. Was amazing- we loved the recipe. Thanks!

Between us, my husband and I have over 100 years standing at the stove!  We followed this recipe precisely, and  I found that it tasted like . . .wet chicken with soaked bread crumbs on it.  My husband finished his portion and said it was OK, but not a repeat.

Came out very good the first time.  Used orange juice concentrate as a 1 to 1 sub.

Also accidentally used the wrong cheese.  Allrecipes shows a picture of Parmesan cheese in the ingredients section, realized later it was suppose to be Romano...still came out good...would love to try it with Romano

The recipe is different, but in a good way, nice way to change it up

This is a lot like Chicken Picatta.  Way less calories with that recipe.  It is cooked in very little oil, and then make the sauce to pour over it.  This recipe is good, but you can get the same effect with a lot less oil, milk, etc.

The chicken was moist and had a good flavor. However, the wine mixture was too much, it made the bottom half of the chicken mushy. If I make it again, I'll serve the wine mixture in a separate bowl and ladle the juices on top of the fully cooked chicken, right after plating it.

Sorry I disagree as I don't think this is anything like Lemon Chicken Piccata. These are not only pounded out, they are then soaked in milk (I used buttermilk).  they are also breaded in a mixture of crumbs and cheese.  There are no capers and it has just that wonderful drizzle of Grand Marnier at the end. I did slightly brown the lemon slices in the pan before making the sauce.  Delightful and company perfect.  I have also made Piccata and find both ways excellent and company perfect.  Edit- LOL I just came across Ina Garten recipe with no capers and with breading, so I guess it is all in the eye of the beholder- or recipe maker.  Both ways are delish!

Used only chicken tenderloins since that's what I had on hand, so no trimming or cutting streamlined this step. Soaked and pounded them per the recipe, and skipped the Grand Marnier altogether, but this recipe is STILL a keeper...even our picky kid was happy with it. It tastes like the chicken is drenched in butter, when in fact, there's virtually zero butter in it...olive oil does virtually all the heavy lifting.   I'd describe the result as chicken piccata with a hint of cheese goodness. What's not to like about that?! Some suggestions and observations: could have made half as much breading and probably still coated all nine of the chicken tenderloins I used. Used panko rather than regular bread crumbs,  but realized regular crumbs would give virtually the same result since the whole dish gets to soak in the wine-broth-lemon juice sauce for 20-30 minutes in the oven. (The  panko had pretty much lost its crunch by the time it got to our plates.) I ignored the instruction to use a cup of olive oil - instead, I slicked the pan generously to fry the tenderloins and the added a little bit more oil before adding the wine, broth and lemon juice. Do put the lemon slices on the pieces per the recipe, if do no other reason than it makes the whole dish seem that much more luxurious and eye-appealing. This dish IS yummy enough to serve company, but it made my family feel pretty special on an otherwise average Tuesday night.

I would definitely make it again. The only change I made was to add Herb and Garlic Salt to the crumb mixture.

Yes, the family enjoyed it. It was very good. I liked the added lemon taste. I really could  not taste the orange liquor and used 2 tablespoons as suggested by one of the reviewers. A lot of my coating came off  in the pan during the browning. Any suggestions how to keep it on the chicken?

Yes, I omitted the milk soak being lactose intolerant of milk but not the cheese. Used bait of apple cider vinegar to moisten chicken prior to dunking in batter.
