This is a dish to experiment with.  I've made this for years, and I've made some important changes to it that I find make the recipe better.  First, cream of celery soup compliments the crab better than cream of chicken.  I've tried cream of mushroom, chicken, etc, and nothing is as tasty in this as the cream of celery.  Second, don't buy expensive finely cut hashbrowns.  Buy less expensive shoestring potatoes or the cubed hash browns. They hold their texture better and absorb the butter and mixture and make a better casserole consistency, otherwise it ends up soupy, almost like mashed potatoes.  When made right, this is a GREAT side dish, but you should experiment to see which way works best for you...

This is one of my all time favorites now.  Definitely reduce the butter (I only did a half cup in the bottom of pan) and the cheese (I just used one 8 ounce package).  I love seafood so this one was a hit.  I even made it with smoked sausage kind of as a breakfast casserole.  I like this one because I can prepare it the night before and leave it in the fridge and just put it in the oven when I get home from work.

The potatoes turned out really soupy!  Way too much butter, and I love butter.  Definetly will try again and use 3/4 cup butter.

This recipe has the potential to be really good. I do wish I had read the reviews BEFORE making it. I agree that it calls for WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER! The dish had butter oozing from it everywhere! Also, I cut back on the cheese to 2-3 cups (8-12 oz). I'm glad I did because the 4 cups would have been too much...and I'm a cheese lover. Will definitely make this again with a butter adjustment. I'll also try the cream of celery soup as suggested by another reviewer. Might even add a little onion for added flavor and a light sprinkle of bread crumbs to top.

This is a great recipe, but I made a few changes to it. I used real potatoes instead of frozen hash potatoes. I peeled, cut, and boiled them along with cut up califlour. When they were done boiling I mixed in 1 cup water with 1 can of cream of chicken soup, I also threw in the crabmeat. When I was done with that, I transferred it into a baking dish and topped it with cheddar cheese to make a lovely casserole. It tasted SOOOOOOO good. Hubby  gobbled it up and then asked me to make it the next day. I ommited the sour cream & butter but next time I will definately add it. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very filling and my youngest son could not get enough.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I used a little less than half a cup of butter,tried cream of celery soup, and used about a cup to cup in a half of cheese.  That seemed to work and I did not have the buttery mess that some reviewers spoke about and the cheese was not overwhelming. I was glad I read reviews before I made this one but will definetly make again.

This recipe has potential, but it's a little different for my taste.  I used 1/2 c butter and it was way too buttery.  Butter oozing from everywhere, Yuck!

Hubby loved this recipe!  I did too.  But like the previous poster wrote, it's too soupy.  Next time I will only add 1/2 cup butter.  Thanks for this recipe, it will become a favorite around my house!

I wish I too had read the reviews first...way too much butter...heart attack waiting to happen.  I will try it again with some of the other viewers' ideas.  It has a lot of yummy potential.

Didn't like too much.  Not very good with imitation crab meat.  Very messy dish.

Made it with real (deep fried) potatoes, a quarter cup of butter, cream of mushroom, and about two tablespoons of Old Bay. Almost restaurant quality -- the only downer was the difficulty of properly frying potatoes at home.
