I really like these cookies. They remind me of Chocolate Chip cookies with out the chocolate chips.  I was worried about the 400 baking temp but it worked out fine although mine were done at about 7 minutes.  Nice crispy edge and a slightly chewy middle.   Oh, they do spread so I ended up doing 8 to a sheet.

A solid cookie recipe. I made this originally so I could just pop a couple in the oven now and then when my sweet tooth got the best of me. It pairs REALLY well with dark tea. I did notice that it was done at 7 minutes, though I left it until 8. At 8 minutes when it cools down it resembles more of a ginger snap consistency (I didn't add nuts, none on hand!), but it makes a really good thing to dip into your tea! Also, if you don't have cinnamon, you can mix up whatever you want to add. I used 2 tsp cake spice, but I'm willing to bet pumpkin spice or any combination of allspice, nutmeg, etc., would make wonderful additions/substitutions. Enjoy!!! (ps - 1 tsp baking soda and 2 tsp cream of tartar is really just 3 tsp baking powder!)

I wanted to make cookies, but was low on time and out of some of the typical cookie ingredients (chocolate chips, peanut butter, even oatmeal -- it is past time to get to the store!). I had what I needed to make these and they came out very good. I used all whole-wheat flour and subbed 1-1/2 tsp baking powder for the baking soda and cream of tartar (thanks to hereforfood for the tip). My kids do not like nuts, so left those out. Also, I didn't have time to refrigerate, so instead of rolling into log and chilling, I scooped out dough with tablespoon measuring spoon, rolled into a ball, then flattened. Good cookie!

Wow, this is one superb cookie! I did, however, make a few changes.. I subbed almond extract for the vanilla, and chopped, blanched almonds for the walnuts. Also, I skipped the roll, wrap, and refrigerate step, and I simply rolled the dough into tight little balls, and flattened with a fork like a peanut butter cookie.

I love these cookies, made per recipe , but once they were backed and cooled off I dipped half the cookie in chocolate and it was amazing and they look pretty. Next time I will infuse the chocolate with orange zest!

I love an easy, quick recipe. I did not use Walnuts this time. For my oven 7 min. Makes a nice crunchy, crispy cookie. Donâ€™t space them too close together. I put parchment paper on my cookies. Makes a good amount! Enjoy! Thanks for the recipe.

Thank you for posting this recipe. My mother made these cookies for me when I was a youngster (about 60 years ago).

I am looking forward to making these for old times sake as they were a favorite.

Thanks again!
