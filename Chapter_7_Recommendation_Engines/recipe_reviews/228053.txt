This is a great base to work from. I added onions in with the broth. For a fuller taste I added sesame oil and fish sauce. Never can be too much ginger for me, so I was generous with adding extra.

I created the recipe. I just wanted to add a few comments.  I too add a little sesame oil as well, and always serve over rice.  Ginger tip: I always keep a hunk of ginger in my freezer and then when I need some, I peel it and it is easy to grate when frozen.Note to previous reviewer, if the fish was "spongy" then you are correct, you did not cook it long enough.

My fiancé & his best friend (and I) loved this! Added onions to the original broth like some reviews said. My fiancé ate his over a "simply asia" garlic basil noodle bowl, while the rest of us used brown rice. I used low sodium soy sauce, but ended up adding salt in the end, so regular soy sauce is probably worth it! Clean plates and compliments all around. I got too excited to take a picture, but it looked as good as it tasted!

This was pretty good. The flavor was good, though I wasn't thrilled with the texture of the fish. It wasn't really flaky, but more like spongy. Maybe I under cooked it? It's worth making again. I wish I had served it on rice. I also wish I had cut up some yellow onion in bite sized chunks to cook with the ginger and garlic. Then it would have been really good with rice! I will make this again, but I think I might try to kick up the flavors with a touch of toasted sesame oil and a bit of red pepper lakes.

A great and easy catfish dish that ISNT fried! I added a bit more ginger and garlic, and put asian leeks, and chopped onion into the broth with a bit of sesame oil (not that it needs it - it never stuck to the pan), some fish sauce, rice wine vinegar and a 1-2 other varieties of mushrooms. We've done this a few times with roasted beets and sauteed beet greens, as well as with steamed veggies and even just as the fish over a large asian inspired salad. Good quick dish!

This was so good!  The only thing I changed was that I added some onions and sesame oil to the broth as other reviewers suggested.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Good but needs a bit more flavor.  Serve over rice.

it was a hit . thanks for the different twist on catfish I had to use Tilapia as my store was out of catfish . it was still good . I think I will just adjust the ginger root and make it less for future.

We really loved this recipe.  I added some sesame and fish oil and doubled the ingredients, so we had a nice sauce to pour over the rice.   So happy to have found a new VERY healthy recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe needs major tweaking, it might just be the amount of ingredients, but it was kinda boring. :/ A good base, I'll make it again but will be playing around.

This was a good way to cook catfish as it came out tender and flaky.  The flavoring was on the bland side even though I added onions and sesame sauce as others suggested.  I will make this again but will add crushed black beans next time.
