Absolutely the best sandwich buns I have ever made, with or without the toppings. I have been baking breads for over 15 yrs. and they are my new go to buns. I think it's the omission of the yolk that makes the difference. Makes an excellent sandwich loaf also. Stays soft and fresh for days. Home bread bakers must give this a try. Big fan, Chef John. Thanks for all the great recipes.

These have become a family/neighborhood favorite! We sub onion for the caraway, my family isn't fond of the seed, and they still are fabulous! Easy to make and they go with just about everything. They have replace regular hamburger buns on our menu.

Awesome recipe!! Made this (and the beef) for dinner tonight.  I haven't historically had the best success with buns or rolls but that is more poor execution. These turned out great! I didn't get 12 out of the recipe but I wanted to make sure they were big enough to hold the sandwiches. Only deviation was I used a beaten egg rather than egg whites for when they were called for but that was just out of laziness...still worked. Will definitely make this again!!

These were so easy to make. Took no time at all before they were out of the oven and served to the family. Beef on a Weck was awesome!

I made these to use as buns for hot chicken sandwiches that are like the restaurant ones. Anyway, I made them exactly as written and put them in the freezer because I was making them for a church get together the next day. They turned out perfect. Everyone loved them. Today, I'm making them with half stone ground whole wheat that I grind myself. We'll see how well they do. The dough feels wonderful!!

The rolls taste great and have the right consistency but I’ve tried this recipe twice and I cannot get them to raise to the size they are supposed to be.  After making them a second time, I watched the attached video and realized the technique used in the video differs slightly from the instructions as they are written.  I’m going to follow the video more than the recipe next time and will hope for success!  Two main differences are that the recipe doesn’t say to put them in the oven to rise and it also does not specify to whisk all ingredients by hand, not with the whisk attachment for your mixer.  My mixture wasn’t getting as “foamy” as it should in the first step and I think that’s why!

I made this exactly as written and they were easy and delicious!  The rolls turned out with excellent texture and flavor.  The caraway seed was a nice but not overpowering touch.  I'd love to see if there were a way to make them a bit lower in carbs, but these are worth it!
