These are hands down AWESOME!!! I added peppermint extract & chocolate chips to half and the other half with cherry extract and shaved bittersweet chocolate on top and they were both gone!!!!! Def. a keeper in this house!! Next time i'm going to try Splenda in place of the sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The egg/sugar mixture never really stiffened.  At the suggestion of a friend I added more cream of tartar and it seemed to help some.   In the morning we woke up to 1/4" thick little blobs of goo that would not come off the greased pan without turning into a gooey mess.  I probably won't try this one again which is unfortunate because it seemed so simple and my gluten free daughter would have loved these.
