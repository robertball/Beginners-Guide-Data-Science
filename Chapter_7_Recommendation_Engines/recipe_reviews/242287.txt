Mom's Polish Stewed Cabbage Haiku: "Ate with egg noodles. I used shredded coleslaw mix, instead of cabbage." For a time-saver, I used a bag of coleslaw mix, but did everything else as written, although didn't leave mine quite as long as 45 min. in dutch oven, only b/c I didn't want the cabbage to turn to moosh. Maybe it was the vinegar and carraway seeds (two things that I haven't used in all of the other cabbage/sausage recipes that I've had from AR), but something about this one didn't appeal to us quite enough to want to make again. Daughter only wanted the buttered egg noodles and the kielbasa, and husband didn't lunge at the leftovers the following day, so while we're cabbagaholics in almost all its forms, it's unlikely we'll make this recipe again.

Really good recipe. I didn't use sausage but otherwise made it as written. Will be making it again.

Good, but not my favorite. A little boring, honestly.

Just took it to a potluck, and it was a real hit! Easy, good long term in crock pot, seasoning is nice. There are a few variables. I make my own sausage and salsa, cabbage heads very in size, etc.I have every reason  to think they would all be very good.
