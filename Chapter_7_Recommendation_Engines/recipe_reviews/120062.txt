I had a serious craving for fried rice and this recipe did not disappoint!  I doubled the recipe and am glad that I did. I marinated the pork in the Chinese Five Spice, about 1/4 c. brown sugar, a splash of soy and a about 2 tbsp. rice vinegar for about 45 min.  I used green peas instead of broccoli and added egg.  I love the fennel seed in this recipe and my house smelled wonderful while I was cooking.  Thank you Laura!

The first time I made this recipe I found it extremely bland, but with a lot of potential. Following another reviewers suggestions I marinated the pork with brown sugar and soy (which is a MUST)along with he 5 spice, added some peas and a scrambled egg with some hoisin in it. Also I added about a tablespoon and a 1/2 of hoisin sauce while frying the rice, some garlic powder and a dash of MSG and black pepper. The last change I made was to use sesame oil instead of regular and it made the most delicious fried rice I've ever had outside of a chinese restaurant, the fennel seeds add a fantastic taste. I highly recommend crushing them first or they add an odd texture.

My husband and I love this dish! I have made it many times. I always marinate the meat in soy sauce, brown sugar, and 5 spice for as long as possible before cooking, and I always skip the fennel seed. I have used various cuts of pork, chicken and beef, many different vegetables, and sometimes sesame, vegetable, or olive oil, but always this same basic recipe.

I doubled this one so that we would have left overs for lunch.  This is really great.  I didn't have 5 spice powder.  However, I used a spice powder that we fell in love with while living in Japan for 4 years.  I let the pork chunks carmelize a bit just to add depth.  DH say's this is a keeper!

This recipe had nice flavor. I needed more oil than it called for. I flavored my brown rice with chinese five-spice powder, soy sauce and garlic powder before cooking it to so it had a lot of flavor already.

This was really very good! It had a nice flavor with the 5 spice, but I also added brown sugar and soy sauce to marinate the pork as someone else suggested. I also added egg. It tasted very light and healthy, but definitely not bland!  I wish I would have doubled the recipe for leftovers. I think next time I will add mushrooms and peas. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is very very good, I didnt have loin so I used the pork steaks from my freezer, and i did double the recipe. I ate so much I was crazy full, my children ate it right up.There was more prep than Im used to for a week night, but it was well worth the extra few minutes. Thank you

I hardly ever follow a recipe. This is so easy. I had planned to cook this on Thursday, but my husband came home and took us out to eat, so I had already chopped all the veggies (lightly in a food processor). Last night I threw this together and it was good. I had all of the ingredients and it was easy, pretty much effortless. Nice and light for Asian food.

This is a very good recipe! I marinated the meat in combo of soy sauce, brown sugar and Chinese 5 spice. I had never used fennel or Chinese five spice before so I went with only the Chinese five spice, leaving the fennel to try another time. I also used white rice and increased the soy sauce (personal taste).  Other than that I followed the directions as stated.  It's been put into my monthly meal plan!

I found it to be a very subtle flavour so can see how others would call it bland.  My husband and two kids though all went for second helpings which is rare so I can't complain!  I left out the onions and broccoli and added in peas and doubled the chinese five spice but didn't marinate.

Very good stir-fry.  I increased it so that I had 6 servings.  I only gave a 4-star rating because I didn't use the fennel seed nor did I have Chinese five seasonings, but instead used a chinese seasoning packet.  This is loaded with flavor and is quick to put together.  I think the key is to have your rice cold.  Leftover were enjoyed by my son for lunch the next day.  Thanks Laura for sharing.

I love this recipe, I have made it a few times now and it is the perfect way to use up some leftover pork loin. I just add it at the end to heat through with the other ingredients. The recipe has a very flexible flavor profile that complements any other vegetables you want to use. Thanks!

This gave me a great base for making Pork Fried Rice. I didn't have the chinese five spice they called for... and I was making it for a family of 6. I used a pork loin roast that I had made the day before and wanted something besides the typical pork b-b-q. So I fried that up with some low sodium soy sauce, and then removed it. Added the veggies and 4 garlic cloves, diced and more soy, and then added the rice and pork back in and fried it up. It was awesome! I don't know what the caraway seed or spices would have done, but in case you find yourself like me and lacking those things.. the garlic and soy sauce were perfect! I also cooked my rice with a couple of beef bouillon cubes. Hope this helps you out! Yum!

This was just ok. I made the changes several others suggested and marinated the pork in soy sauce and brown sugar.  It still didn't taste like the classic fried rice I was expecting.  It was bland.

I was looking up recipes so I could use up my fennel seeds and found this.  It was pretty tasty and something I'd try again.  I think next time I will marinate the pork for more flavour.

Love the mix of Chinese Five Spice and Fennel seed - I was trying to use up leftovers  - roast pork loin and quinoa so I made those substitutions.  I used 1 tbsp of soy and a teaspoon of sugar plus minced garlic clove when warming up the pork.  Also added asparagus to veggies since I had it.  Great!

This was a little bland and a lot dry.  This dish is obviously meant to be healthy and low in fat but it really needed some sauce.  We doused it in soy sauce, but that obscured the Chinese 5 spice powder.

Thanks so much for posting this simple recipe! My fried rice has never come out quite right. I have to say - for the sake of time and available food in the kitchen - I skipped the fennel, but will try that next time. I doubled the recipe - used Success brown rice - and added red bell pepper. Thanks again!

This recipe is great, and is really really flexible.  I also used it to use up leftover pork and rice that I had on hand. I used all the veggies called for, and even added in peas, and zucchini.  My family ate almost all of it, and it was gone by lunch the next day!

I made this recipe the first time because I had left over chops. It is amazing! Making again today. Probably enhances the fennel flavor since there is fennel in my pork brine
