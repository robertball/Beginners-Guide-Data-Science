Loved this, but I was a little lazy. When I was in the store getting the chicken, I bought croutons, put them in a Ziploc bag and banged them just a bit with a rolling pin just to reduce the size, also picked up some bacon bits. (I guess I was real lazy) Sprinkled the croutons and bacon bits into the delicious salad and everyone loved them. You can call me lazy on this one, but........oh heck, I'm just lazy.

Made this for lunch last week and my daughter and I loved it. I used leftover chicken and stuck with my homemade caesar salad dressing from this site. So delish and thanks Michelle!

I planned on following the exact recipe, but bought flat bread by accident, so  I decided to make pizzas....mmmmmmm! I chopped the chicken then mixed it with the dressing and topped the flatbread added the cheese and baked. My picky son even liked it (without the lettuce of course) I will do this again and will bake a little longer, I liked the edges that got a little crispy! also did not have rosemary so I left it out. I WILL FIX THIS AGAIN and will try the pocket thing too maybe? idk? it was sooo yummy this way :) did the chicken exact and was surprise how moist it turned out. I let it completely cool before cutting.

Very good easy recipe. I like to bake the pita halves for a bit before I stuff them. This gives the pita more texture.

This was definitly good, but if you're not a fan of caesar salads you won't like it, because that what it basically is, in a pita. Anyways, my husband and I both enjoyed the recipe quite a bit.

This is a wonderful recipe! I adapted it to put on rolls rather than pitas (for a party) and did not make the croutons (which made it quicker). People RAVED about how good it was! I have made it three times now and the chicken is best marinated in italian dressing - it really did improve the taste. Tossing in some tomato is yummy, if desired.

I made the filling ahead of time for a quick and easy dinner after a day of work.  If you like Caesar salads, you'll like this dish.  I'm trying to reduce my sodium intake so I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and table salt.  I didn't bother with the croutons.  Also, I cut back on the amount of Caesar dressing.  One bottle seemed like way to much.

Whenever we go out to a local restaurant - my boyfriend has to eenie meenie minie moe between his fav. cesar pita or his fav. burger.  I thought I'd bring one of his favorites to him.  Yes -this is easy but it is awesome!!  I fried the chicken w/ the spices using a few TBLS of butter vs. the whole boil thing.  (I can't wait to try this grilled this summer).  Like others - I skipped the crouton thing and we didn't miss it.  I also found flavored pitas - which are awesome.  A big thanks Michelle!

This is a great idea for lunches during the week. I did make some changes (sorry) to account for logistical issues. Since I was taking it in the morning, I thought the croutons would gt soggy by lunch and/or/dinner, so I left them out. I also did not mix the lettice in with the rest...just pu in there when I built the pita. That way, I made the chicken/cheese/caesar mix on Sunday and just built my pita in the morning before heading to work. Worked out great and then the lettuce was still nice and crisp. Thanks for sharing- his is definitely a keeper in my lunch rotation!

Yummy! I browned chicken tenders along with the seasonings and then just diced them. My whole family enjoyed them in the pitas as something just a little different.

Mmmmm, that was so good!  My husband just finished his and asked if I could make these again!  High praise.  I don't think I changed anything but used bacon bits and store bought croutons.  I also served it all on a spinach wrap.  Thank you!

Loved these, but they were a little more labor intensive than I had bargained for. These may be the best pitas I have ever made. I just need to make sure I have plenty of time to work before I attempt again. Thanks.

This was a great recipe! I was trying to make this healthier and lower in fat so I omitted the bacon and instead of using bottled of Caesar, I made Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce from this site.

This was great, and not difficult at all to make (well, I had two sets of hands in the kitchen).  To all the people that didn't make the croutons -- you're missing out!  They added just a bit of crunch, without being as hard as store-bought croutons, and really improved the overall texture.  I wasn't originally impressed by the idea of boiling chicken, but it worked out very well.  Will definitely make again!

This has quickly become a summer family favorite.  When I first started the recipe, cooking the chicken according to the instructions seemed strange.  It ended coming out great and helped with some time management (and heating up the kitchen) when I skipped a few steps and purchased caesar croutons instead of making them from scratch and used bacon bits.  We also used wheat wraps instead of pita bread, but they are delicious!

This was a huge hit!  I added more dressing, chopped the lettuce smaller  and spread them on mini pitas and served them as appetizers.  They were gone in seconds!

My family really enjoyed this.  For the most part we followed the recipe.  Our two exceptions were that we grilled hte chicken and used spinach tortillas to make wraps instead of pitas.  The homemade croutons were very easy to make and well worth it.  We will definately make this recipe again.

A classic combination and it's nice to see it in a wrap instead of salad. Although I love salads and eat them daily, switching it up is always nice. This worked very well, although I'm not a fan of poached chicken so I cooked it by sauteing along with the herbs. I also left out the croutons. The crunch would be nice, but adding bread to a sandwich filling didn't appeal to me. The quality of dressing is going to make all the difference here, so I made my own. Very nice, light summer meal.

Tastes just like Caesar salad stuffed in a pita pocket.  I bought the croutons because I have a favorite brand that I love, but I did take the time to make homemade pita pockets using the recipe for “Peppy’s Pita Bread” from this site.

So amazing! I meant to follow the recipe exactly but made a few modifications as I went along. I didn't want to pay $4 for 6 pita pockets so I bought something called tortilla bread. It's a tortilla but thicker/fluffier. So we ended up having chicken Caesar tacos basically. Also, we didn't mix the chicken in w/ the salad. I cooked the chicken as directed, but instead we put the chicken directly into the bread and then topped it with a tiny bit of dressing, and then the salad. This meal was so refreshing and fun! It is going into my monthly-meal cookbook.

Very good! Used low-fat classic ceasar dressing (didn't use the entire bottle), turkey bacon instead of regular, whole wheat pitas, and forewent the homemade croutons for premium store-bought. Served it cold. Great recipe to prep early and serve later.

Made lots of changes to the recipe: used garlic basil wraps instead of pitas, seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, sea salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper and baked instead of boiling it. I also skipped the croutons and used packaged bacon bits. I also used packaged lettuce, which had carrots and red cabbage in it. I also added some onion to the salad. Used Cardini's Caesar dressing. Yummy!! I enjoyed these a lot and ate two in the same day. I thought they tasted like wraps from a certain fast food place around here. Hubby didn't like it as much---left his second one, and didn't bother to take it to work with him. This also is not a good recipe for kids---my toddler only ate a few bites. I would have given this at least four stars, but since the family wasn't impressed, I gave less. Maybe I'll make it again for friends.
