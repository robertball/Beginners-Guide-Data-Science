It was a really good starter recipe.  I added a bit to the ingrients, pickling salt, and changed the cooking method a bit.....I added a few spices like dill and basil, for just a little extra and added all sorts of different peppers esp hotter ones like chili peppers to give it a bit of color and extra kick since the vinegar and cooking will take away the heat of the peppers. BTW, if you don't like the heat of the peppers, you can add a little oil to the bottom of the jars before filling and it will help to take away some of the kick of the peppers!  I also put some pickling salt in the vinegar/water before boiling, just a TBSP or so.  Takes away a bit of the sour taste some might get.  I also filled the jars differently, making it a lot easier and a lot less dangerous in my opinion.  Instead of actually cooking the peppers, onions, garlic, and spices with the Vinegar/Water; I stuff them into clean jars and poured the really hot vinegar/water mixture over them.  I then re-cooked the jar with lids on to make them seal, like the recipe.  This allowed the peppers to cook in the jars through the boiling process, but not lose as much heat and crunch.  It was also a little easier in my opinion, allowing me to stuff my jar completely with the cool, just cut ingredients, instead of having to ladle and stuff hot peppers into the jars, making sure they were filled and not burning myself in the process.   Hope that helps and thanks for the great idea!

Simmering for five minutes turned the peppers to mush. I tried it a second time just adding boiled liquid to the jar full of peppers and it came out just right.

Whew!  I made these with a bunch of jalapenos and 2 cayenne peppers.  I did throw in some evoo and fresh herbs as suggested by another reviewer.  I also threw in some cherry tomatoes and green onions after I removed the pan from the heat -- I think you could pickle alomost anything in this mixture.  I had some of the mixture left that wouldn't fit in the jars, so I added some more peppers for a few minutes, added 1/4 c. sugar and 1 T. salt, tossed it in the blender, and made some kickin' hot sauce.  Simple recipe and pretty in the jars, too.

A very simple and easy recipe.  I use it to pickle banana peppers from my garden.  I never seem to get enough peppers to do large batches so I scale down this recipe to do one jar at a time and then I refrigerate shortly afterward.  Sometimes I will cut up new peppers and put them directly in the previous, already being used, jar and it turns out well.  Great flavour overall and I hope to plant more next year just so I can use this recipe again and have more!

These turned out quite well, but just a bit too vinegary.  Maybe increase spices a bit to compete with the vinegar?  
Note:  I initially wrote this review quite soon after canning the peppers.  Now, 9 months later, I can say that these peppers are EXCELLENT!

This was very easy and simple.  As one of the others stated that soon after the taste is OK but when you let them "age" they are excellent.

Uh ok, look, this is ok but like a few others I am not to keen on cooking the peppers in the liquid unless you like mushy peppers. Better to pack the jar with peppers, and then pour the cooked liquid on top, slit each pepper about an inch (or 1/3 the length of the pepper for smaller ones), so th eliquid can enter the peppers. pour the liquid till it reaches about 1/4 inch from th etop, placed lids tightly on the jars and put them immersed in near boiling water for about 10 to 15 minutes to seal jars. Let the jars then cool to room temp and I place them in the compact fridge in my basement that is set at a temp setting of 1. It holds about twenty jars. Let them "cure" for about 3 weeks to a month and man, great. I add to th ejar with peppers, about 6 slivers of raw onion, 1 cinamon stick, 1 bay leaf, and about a teaspoon of peppercorns. They are a little spicy, not too spicy, but have a great flavor. Eat them plain, with crackers, or for cooking in sauces. This is th esimplest way to can or jar pickles. You don't need all the fancy junk like pressure cookers, canning pots. You kitchen needs one large pot and maybe, maybe a couple medium sized pots depending on how many jars you want to do at one time. I usually do six at a time. easy and idiot proof.

I've been pickling hot hungarian peppers, jalapenos and habaneros for a long time.  I bring the brine to a full boil. I put the peppers and a piece of garlic in hot sterlized jar, ladle the hot brine into the jar, put approximately 1 tablespoon of evoo, and cover with hot sterlized lid and cap.  That's it.  Let sit for a month before opening.  We are opening some jars now from last August and the peppers are nice and crisp.  Be sure to wipe lip of jar off before putting on cap.  Work quickly with each jar but don't try to do more than one jar at a time.  Store in cool, dark area.   If you enjoy hot hot, try making hot pepper jelly.  Habanero hot pepper jelly served with cream cheese and crackers is the best.  Just a dab of jelly though.

I made a double batch of these today which yielded 7 qts for later and 1 1/2 qt for the fridge. They are a big hit!! I added 1/2 c. olive oil,1 1/2t.basil and 1 lb. baby carrots per batch.  Easy and awesome flavor. Can't wait to taste the ones that are for later, they say the flavour really blends well. Awesome recipe!

I, like some of the other reviewers, made my first batch and it turned out mushy. I am currently working on my second batch which I used 1/3 c pickling lime and a 1 gallon water(just a guess). I am crossing my fingers that this batch turns out less mushy.   I also added the pepper raw to the jars and then threw the hot vinegar mix on top. Spices were .at the bottom of the jar also added quite a bit more spices to mine. I added tumeric (hoping to improve the color), peppercorns whole, brown mustard seed, along with the garlic. The taste is amazing. It tasted just like pepperocinis. I used half banana peppers & half anaheims for the first batch. This second is all banana. Not hot but full of flavor. I will make a few batches this summer and report back the best ratios

I made these last summer.  My husband said that they were way to vinegary.  So I made several batches and experimented.  I ended up using 6 cups of water and 3 cups of vinegar.  I also added some salt "to taste" to the vinegar.

Everybody loves them and always ask for the recipe. Quick and easy to make. I do not cook my peppers at all. I chop em' and put em' in the jars and pour the hot vinegar over them. Water bath as it says. Taste fabulous!

I made these back in August/ September but just opened the first jar. Since when I make dill pickles they are supposed to be stored for a min. of 8 weeks I figured to get the full flavor out of these I would do the same. They were definately worth the wait. I gave a jar to a friend of mine last week and she has already requested a 2nd jar b/c they are so good. Thanks for this great recipe.

I decided to make these before I went to work this morning and it really only took about 10 minutes.  I scaled it down to 10 servings and it nearly filled a 3 cup jar.  I didn't do a water bath because I put them in the fridge.  I used what I had picked-banana peppers, 2 jalapenos, and I decided to throw in a green tomato.  YUMMY!  I set it on my counter at 7:30 and ate some at 1:00 and they were fantastic.  I will certainly make this again with whatever I have on hand, but the jalapeno is the important part for the spiciness. Super Easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe!
Oh-I did not boil the veggies w/ the brine, but just added them (minus the tomato) for the last minute of simmer then put them in the jar on top of the tomato.

These are very good! I had a bunch of banana peppers (hot and sweet) to use up, so I thought I would give this a try. NOTE: I did not use the other peppers called for because I didn't have any, but will definately add them next time. I did cut my peppers into thinner rings. These would be great on a sandwich or as a pizza topping. I did not find them too vinegary as others said. I thought they were perfectly flavored. I will definately be using this recipe again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought the peppers were pretty good but tasted really sour from the vinegar. After opening the jar I added some pickling salt and they tasted much better.  I will make this again but next time I will add salt during the cooking process.

This is the best basic recipe.  We add peppercorns, dill seed and mustard seed.  We don't do the bath, just let it sit in the fridge for a week or two and then they will be gone.

Would not ever use this recipe again. Can't imagine how bad it would be if I hadn't followed Kelly's comments. Total mush and no color. So disappointed

I reduced the heat for us by using only 1/4# of banana peppers and using Anaheim chilis instead of jalapenos.  Everything else stayed the same.  These were so nice having them around for sandwiches or just snacking.  Thank you!

I had to substitute cayenne peppers for the serrano because that is what we had growing in our garden. Also added about 1/4 cup thinly sliced carrot to each jar as I filled them.  I had so many peppers that I wound up tripling the recipe. Since the recipe did not specify I assumed from the picture that processing/boiling time was for pint jars. I used some quarts and some pints.  Processed the pints for 15 mins and the quarts for 25 mins.  All sealed perfectly. Yummy!

These were FABULOUS! Much better than I expected. I did add a little olive oil and fresh basil for extra flavor and I did not crush the garlic, I halved it or quartered it so that there were nice big chunks in there. We waited 6 months before opening. I can't wait to make more and give them away as gifts. I will definitely be growing more hot peppers this year.

Made this using whole red chili peppers in place of the serrano peppers.  I cut the banana peppers in 1 inch chunks and sliced the jalapeno peppers.  They looked so pretty in the jars.  My husband could barely wait until it was time to open a jar.  They were very good and we've enjoyed them on pizza, salads, & sandwiches.

I scaled this recipe down quite a bit and only used the little green hot peppers. We eat this along with a lot of the asian dished I prepare. My husband and mother-in-law absolutely love this stuff.  Have some tissue ready...it will cleanse your sinuses.

It's pretty basic and good for beginners.  I never boil my peppers. I do a raw pack & then add the liquid. fresh garlic is best. & I add a little bit of sugar to take the edge off the vinegar.  My husband LOVES these and his buddies buy the product for me to make it for them.

Easy to make, and peppers taste terrific! We had an abundance of hot fresno and anaheim chiles this year - this recipe was perfect! We sliced them in thin rings instead of big chunks, and did not process them - no need if they are kept in the fridge, as the vinegar will inhibit spoilage.  We did add some sea salt to the recipe - about 1 teaspoon. Can't wait to put them on a homemade deli sandwich - they taste very similar to store-bought pepperoncinis! Yum!!

Good taste but the cooking time of the peppers seems to be too long since the peppers turned out mushy.  Next time we will either simmer for a shorter time or simply add the boiling water to the jars.

Good recipe. Needed some salt for flavor after opening the jar from the pantry, so next time I make it, I'll just add salt to the vinegar mixture.

This is a good basic recipe. The only thing I would add in the directions is PLEASE WEAR GLOVES! Look up" jalapeño hands" and you will see the importance. At first, it doesn't burn, but after two hours, I felt horrible burning. An hour later, I was in tears, trying everything I could find on the internet. It was a horrible experience.

I did this recipe last year, added chopped olives, chopped celery, & chopped carrots for color. It was so yummy I made a triple batch & canned the triple batch! What a "treat" for folks who like a little heat with a sandwich or as a pickle side dish! I gave away a few jars as gifts and everyone wants more this year! (I gave them the recipe...LOL)

Way too much vinegar to water ratio for my taste. Next time I make it I will do 4 cups vinegar to 2cups water.  I made 5 pints and still had plenty of liquid left over.

This is the Ball Blue Book recipe, word for word, EXCEPT that the original recipe does not call for the peppers to be cooked.  This is why they turn mushy.  The original recipe probably could have been written more clearly, but it requires only the pickling solution to be boiled for 5 minutes, then it is poured over the peppers which have been packed into hot jars.

Third year I have used this recipe and have consistently been happy with the results (as is a sibling who keeps demanding I share them with him). As it is sometimes difficult to get  fresh jalapeno and serrano peppers at my farmer's market (in western Canada) I have substituted what are sold as "Crimson Hot Peppers" and "Hot Portugal Peppers" to go along with the hot Banana Peppers. I also include one clove of garlic and about 1/4 teaspoon of black peppercorns in each jar when canning. The Crimson peppers in particular make a nice visual contrast to the light green/yellow colour of the majority of banana peppers. I did find that the recommended 5 minute initial cooking time did make the peppers too soft, so have only blanched the peppers for about 1 minute the second and third time I used this recipe which resulted in a firmer finished product. Being at over 1,000 metres over sea level, the extra processing time involved seems to make up for the reduced initial cooking time.

15 servings makes about 3 pints. I filled the jars with the raw ingredients , then poured the boiling vinegar mixture to fill jars and they cooked well while canning.

I added 6 T of sugar to the brine.  This cut the vinegary-ness but did not lose the pickle flavor.

First time canning as an adult watching my mom make 1000's and 1000's of jars of every vegetable grown on the farm for which I worked.  Looks like everything worked well canning-wise, but as far as this particular recipe, cooking the peppers for 5 minutes is far too long.  Blanching them for a minute or two, roasting them slightly in a skillet or over the grill, or not cooking them at all would prove to be a better approach to preparing the peppers as mine ended up softer than I'd like.  I'm sure they'll taste just fine in 6 months!
