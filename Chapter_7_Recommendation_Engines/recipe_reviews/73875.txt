Made it for the 1st time last night and we all loved it.  Very creamy.  Next time I won't add as much sugar, but will keep everything else the same.

Everytime I make this potato salad everyone wants the recipe.  I use a little more onion, no carrots, and celery only if I have it.  I also add a little extra celery seed to the dressing.  I top the salad with sliced hard boiled eggs and sprinkle with paprika for a finished look.

Wonderful! I also omitted the carrots (our least favourite veggie)as well as the butter. I also reduced the sugar to a scant 1/2 cup and added 1 tablespoon of celery seed to the dressing. I increased the apple cider vinegar from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup and instead of plain milk, I used buttermilk. I also made the dressing in the microwave. After the dressing cooled, I mixed it in with the spuds and added a good handful of chopped fresh dill. This is our "summer salad of the year"! Thanks MelCavell.

I've made this recipe several times now, and I like the sweet flavor of it, though sometimes I decrease the sugar a bit. I don't like celery so I substitute about a teaspoon of celery salt, and I use green onions. This doesn't replace my standard potato salad recipe, but its great for a change of pace.

Thanks for a delicious recipe.  I've made a different cooked dressing for years and this one is much creamier.  I added salt & celery seed to my own taste since an amount wasn't listed.  I also added green pepper & olives (personal preference).  This dressing would also be great for cole slaw & macaroni salad.

Used red potatoes instead of white. While this taste ok to good for us, I just plain thought it was too much work. I will revert back to other recipes. Thanks anyway.

This recipe was just perfect! To all the people who say it's too sweet- You must let it sit!  When I tried it immediately after it was done I was concerned about the sweetness.  Next day- all the flavors were blended and everything was wonderful. Only thing I did different was shred the onion.

I'm so happy I found this recipe it tastes great and it's been in our family for generations. I, too, left out the carrots. A great way to use eggs - especially since I have 30 hens!

I enjoyed watching the egg emulsifying in the pan...and the salad was great! My husband, who is so picky about potato salad, loved this one. I also thought the sugar suggested in the recipe was too much so reduced it to half the amount.

Although I liked the cooked dressing & would try to use it somewhere else it did not make the best potato salad in my opinion. It might be quite good in coleslaw.

Wow. I was skeptical because of the added veggies (carrots, celery, etc.), but this is honestly the best potato salad I've ever had. We did replace the regular onion with two green onions, although I might even consider purple onion to give it a bit more color.  It really is a spectacular potato salad!

This is so sickingly sweet I'm just lucky I tasted the cooked dressing before I added in any mayo, I ended up by throwing it away, at this point I feel this is worthy of only a 1 star, if I make it again I will reduce the sugar to 2 tablespoons and then I will edit my review...TO ALL WHO MAKE THIS RECIPE make certain to reduce the sugar amount!

My mother in law always made potato salad just like this...and I am so happy I came across this recipe because now I can make it and it tastes just as good! Thank you so much for publishing this recipe-it is indeed the best potato salad...and completely worth the time and work it takes to make it.

I thought this was great!  I cant stand potato salad thats straight mayo.  This is sweet and tangy.  The only change I made was to shred my carrots instead of chopping them.  I think this will be my new go-to recipe for potato salad.

I've tried many different recipes, this is by far the best I've made! It's a bit sweet (which I like) and the dressing is very creamy. Tastes like the Amish Potato Salad you buy at the store/deli, but without all the chemical ingredients & preservatives. I'm not a mayonnaise fan (yes, I'm one of those "Miracle Whip people"), but I used 1/2 Hellman's/Best Foods and 1/2 Miracle Whip which probably added to the sweetness. I might try just a serving with a bit of pickle relish (sweet or dill?), but I don't think I can improve on this recipe. I followed it exactly and it's perfect!

Absolutely fantastic!  I didn't add the onions or celery and used Bread and Butter pickle juice in place of vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar and flour in place of cornstarch.  I added half the dressing first, tossed with celery salt and then 2 hours later added a little more - It tastes like I bought it at a deli!  Wonderful receipe!

Made a couple of changes, as I  am an untrained chef,lol. 
First, I peeled potatoes first and used goldens, then cut sugar by about half, used twice as much mustard-dijon, added saffron to hot mixture then cooled and used miracle  whip  instead of mayonnaise, also cooked baby carrots with taters then cut up chunky.
Turned out like hollandaise potato salad, RICH! 
Best i ever tasted, and I'm not saying that just because I made it!

I made this a few years ago for my mother's birthday and it has become my signature dish. Anytime there is a family gathering, my family requests this potato salad!

This is awesome!  I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and would use even less next time.  The recipe is labor intensive, but potato salad, to me, is a special get-together food that I only eat occasionally.  Thus it is worth the work.

I had been buying amish potato salad in the store for years and decided to try to make it myself when I found this recipe.  I made it yesterday.  I cut down just a little on the onion and shredded the carrots instead, as this is how it is in the brand I usually buy.  The flavor was excellent!  I think I might not have let the egg mixture thicken long enough though, as it was a little runny instead of creamy.  I want to have this for my cookout for labor day so I'm going to make another batch tonight, this time letting it cook longer to thicken up more.  As for those who think it's too sweet...you must have never had amish potato salad before, as this is normal!  Excellent recipe!  Thankyou!!!

This is really good salad!  My family didn't think that it was to sweet.  It does sound like an insane amount of sugar, but it doesn't taste as "sugary" as we imagined it would.  Thank for sharing!

I've been horrible at making potato salad and decided to try this recipe as we used to live in Lancaster, PA and liked their Amish Potato Salad.  This recipe was close to what we were used to there and I'm sure I will make it again.  My husband really liked it.

Disappointing - I had high expectations.  I had bought a local grocery store brand Amish potato salad and it was awesome - I was excited to see try this recipe becuase I was sure it would be even better homemade. Maybe I did something wrong, but by the next day we threw it out.  It was not good at all.  I have a tried and true potato salad recipe I will stick with.  If I ever try this again and it turns out better, I will update.

Made this potato salad several times, everyone enjoys it very much.  Reminds me of the potato salad my Grandma made.  I cut down on the sugar amount, and use celery salt instead of celery seed and no butter or celery.

I just opened Julie's Cafe in Elkhart, IN on Oct. 8th, 2014 & last week I was asked to cater a company staff luncheon/meeting for the field technicians of a local branch of a national corporation. I had made a batch of this as a side dish choice in my Cafe so when I met with her to do a tasting I took this as one of my offerings....:She loved it!!  Ordered 5 lbs of it as one of the sides.  When I made the initial batch, I didn't have plain vinegar in the pantry, so I used red wine vinegar & it adds a little zing to it so I keep using that. Tx!! Julie.

I have made this twice now for different parties.  Both times all of it was eaten.  That says a lot when it is gone quickly.  The only change is I used less sugar.  This takes longer to make than traditional potato salad but it is so worth the extra time and steps.

Almost perfect. But if you want the real deal Amish potato salad, use evaporated milk instead of regular milk. Stir in sweet pickle relish at the end. To avoid runny dressing, squeeze the relish try in a clean linen tea towel or several layers of paper towels before adding. THEN you'll have real Amish potato salad.

My first attempt at making potato salad and this came out pretty good. I did dice the pototoes before I cooked them only because that's how I've always seen it done. And based on other recommendations I cut back on the sugar a little bit.  I have to admit, the egg mixture started to scare me when I was mixing the egg, sugar, and cornstarch. But once I added the other ingredients I could see it coming together better.  I might try this again, but honestly it just taste like regular potato salad to me. But it's still good. Thanks for sharing

Great recipe!  I grew up in Gratz, PA which is in the heart of amish country.  This reminds me of the potato salad that we had as a little girl.  I just made the recipe for a labor day picnic.  My husband doesn't give food compliments easily and after trying this potato salad, his reaction was, "Wow!  This is the best I've ever had!"

This is the closest thing to the potato salad my grandmother used to make. I lost the recipe she had for the dressing but I think this is pretty close and it is very good. I cut down on the sugar a little since it is quite sweet but still a very good recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe.  We frequent Amish Country in Holmes County Ohio and this is very close to what the Amish Door serves as their potato salad.  We have also made this with splenda and we do reduce the sugar. Thank you for sharing this.

I made it for 16 people and I think it called for a little too much onion.  Otherwise, very tasty.  I added radishes and I shredded the carrots.

This is one potato salad that definately gets better with age. I used yellow potatoes which made it very buttery. It yeilds a lot, so you may want to reduce the amount of servings if you do not have big crowd and a week of lunches to pack.

I made this for a weekend BBQ and we were not happy with it. I thought it had way too much vinegar. However, a family friend that was over, loved it. I gave her the recipe but won't be making it again myself.

I usually omit the celery seed, and celery because the wife doesn't like them. I omit the hard-boiled egg because I don't like it. This makes the recipe a heck of a lot easier. And it's *still* freaking delicious. My go-to side dish for most occasions. It's definitely on the sweeter side, but I find this to be the best potato salad there is, period.

Excellent potato salad.  We cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons and roasted new potatoes for added flavor.  Everything else was as written.

Absolutely delicious and authentic. Most of my family still reside in the Pennsylvania Dutch area and this is just how my mother made her potato salad.  When I made this, however, I did not have nearly enough potatoes for the sauce, so I would boil 12 medium sized reds next time.

I LOVED THIS!!! I love potato salad in restaurants, especially the one at our local Viennese/German food joint, but whenever I tried to make it at home, it was so bland, no matter what I did.

This was FAR from bland. I made it almost exactly to the recipe, except for the celery, celery seed. Loved it!!! 

The only thing I wish would change about the recipe is the amount of potato..."six medium potatoes" is a very inexact measurement, and I didn't have any potatoes that I would call "medium" so I guessed, and ended up with too few potatoes for the sauce, and had to boil more.

I omitted the salt and added onion powder instead as I am on a low salt diet for health and I do not use salt when I cook.   I also added about 1/4 cup of mustard hot dog relish that was sitting on my counter.     I must say it was alittle on the sweet side with  3/4 cup sugar but I don't think I would decrease it next time.   I also added bacon bits for garnish and flavor.     I definitely will be making this salad again.  Love the creaminess of the dressing.     It was perfect.

I made this exactly as directed (doubled) and it is by far the best potato salad I've ever put into my mouth.  I've been a potato salad fan all my life and I can't believe I've gone all of these decades without it.  It's so incredibly good, I tacked it to the bookmarks bar.  It will be my go to recipe for potlucks and church events from now on.

I'm ashamed to say that I've been making boring potato salad ever  since I thought I learned how to make it (b4 internet). Well my palate has changed recently so I knew I needed a change. I only made minor changes but I think this recipe is a keeper. I prefer to peel and chop my potatos prior to cooking them so I don't have to wait for them to cool after. I also cut the sugar down 2tbs and still found this sweet on the day of, but the next day, it was creamy and delicious. I also double the eggs. Note that your home will reek of vinegar, but it's a trade off I'm okay with.

3.8.18  As with most food these days, I cut the sugar waaaay back, otherwise, followed the recipe as written.  I’ve had mayo dressing on potato salad and egg dressing on it, as well (my father made his with egg dressing when I was a kid), but never had the two combined.  And we liked this creamy potato salad!  In the future, I’m going to add some crumbled, crisp bacon; just think that would make this even better.  I like all kinds of potato salad, but I’ll admit I’m a little picky, but we really liked this version!

Will change the amounts for the dressing, way too much for the amount of potatoes. Flavor was great though. Will definitely make it again.

I made this with some changes, and my wife really liked it.

I cut the sugar down to 1/2 of a cup, and it was still quite sweet. I also upped the mayo to 1.25 cups, and this helped the dressing remain sticky. I also added more potatoes than suggested, which still worked well. If this seems to be drowning in sauce, try adding more potatoes.

Tip: If the dressing seems too runny, you might not be cooking the dressing long enough for the corn starch to thicken. The corn starch really does take at least 10 minutes to set with constant stirring. I thought it might have set at least three times before it really did - wait it out, and it will get noticeably difficult to stir in the end. This is one of the few instances where I would suggest that you trust the clock, not your gut!

P.S. I made it without carrots or celery (both of which my wife doesn't like) and it was still good. This would make a good base from which to experiment with different crunchy vegetable additions.

This is really the recipe I have used for 40 years minus the carrots.  Always well received at potlucks, reunions and picnics. I do not use as much sugar. If you do not like sweet things scale back the sugar.  You can always add more before you stop cooking sauce. Easy peasy.

I've made this twice now, the first time I added the amount of sugar it calls for and it was WAY to sugary. So the next time i added half and it was just right. So i suggest only adding half the amount of sugar it calls for.

Just too sweet for me. I should have really thought about how much sugar was in it before I made it. I ended up adding a lot of extra mustard to try to balance it out. The dressing tasted more like a sweet coleslaw dressing. It's a good recipe if that's what you're looking for...it's just not the type of Amish potato salad I'm used to.

This is a really good recipe, it is however sweet, if you don't like a sweeter tasting potato salad this is not for you.  I did not use all the dressing on my potato salad and used the rest up in some chicken salad adding onion and celery and a few shakes of salad supreme and it was outstanding.

Left out the carrots and celery because when I first made it with carrots and celery, we didn't like it. This is the only potato salad I make. I was buying the Amish Potato and Macaroni Salad from Walmart. But they recently changed the recipe. It's no longer sweet and has very little, if any, egg. So now I am back to this recipe. And my kids and husband are happy about it. My mom grew up in Pennsylvania Dutch country also, and I'm sure she would have loved this too. Thanks for sharing.

The flavor is excellent, but like some other reviewers, the salad dressing was too runny and way too abundant given the salad ingredients. I'm disappointed with the result after the time, ingredients, and expectations that went into it.  I'm hoping that a day later, more of the dressing will have absorbed into the salad ingredients.

Wonderful old-fashioned potato salad. My husband and I agreed that it tasted like our 'Grandma's' and that is a really great thing!  My daughter-in-law said it is exactly like her grandma's and she told me that her grandma makes up a double recipe of the dressing becasue it keeps well in the frig and she could then make up a bowl of potato salad quickly. I tried it and really does keep well, so it works if you have a family and will use that much in a couple of weeks.
