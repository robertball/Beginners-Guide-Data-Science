This wasn't bad, just not as good as I thought it would be.  I love all the ingredients so I guessed that I would love them all together.  I didn't.

Made as written except the tiny shrimp were more expensive than small shrimp so I used small shrimp instead. Loved this except that I thought it needed a sprinkle of salt or vinegar based pepper sauce such as Frank's or Louisiana Hot Sauce. I also recommend using fresh cilantro. I will make this again with a couple of tweaks.
