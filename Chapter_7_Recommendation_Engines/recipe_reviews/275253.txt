These turned out good. I cooked mine for a full hour to get a nice crisp on the shell. They've got to be super crisp if I expect the husband to eat the shell. If you haven't tried cooking baked potatoes in the air fryer, you need to. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.

The cook time in my fryer was perfect! Will do it this way again.
