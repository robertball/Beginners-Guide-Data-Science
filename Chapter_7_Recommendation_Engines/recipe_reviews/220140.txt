I made this as written, and it came out just ok.  The custard filling seemed extremely thick - it started thickening up immediately when I started cooking it, and had big globs in it that I had to break up with wooden spoon.  This pie actually tasted better the next day, and whipped cream on top helped a lot.

Great combination of my favorites--in-season strawberries, custard, and graham cracker crust. I used a vanilla bean for the custard, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.
