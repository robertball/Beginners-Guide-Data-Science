I've always been a fan of Jello Shots. I make mine every Christmas/New Years without fail. Want to make this even better? Try this with Whipped Vodka. It's freaking IN-SANE.

I've made these for years and love them.  Sometimes I add a dash of canned Whipped Cream on top for fun.  Try other flavors.  Using orange flavored gelatin with vanilla vodka makes them taste like Dreamcicles!!

Spray the shot glasses with non-flavored Pam or nonstick spray so the shots just slide out!!

I used slightly different measurements but this is the same thing I made for my party this past weekend. They were a big hit! I've also made them with raspberry flavored rum and vanilla vodka and black cherry jello.

I've been making Jell-o shots for years and am always looking for new recipes. This one is very good. My other favorite is melon Jell-o with Midori. We always use condiment cups for the Jell-o shots that way you can put tops on them and they are transportable.

Jello shots are great for parties. These were some of the best jello shots I have ever made. My guests loved them. Hurray for Jello Shots!

These were excellent at our poker party/New Years Eve party. The ladies especially enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing.

Made them in a square pan and cut into squares. I used black cherry jello and vanilla vodka. I would probably use a different flavor next time.

Yummy!  I made this as a last minute addition to a party and stuck them in the freezer to speed up the setting.  Half way through I had to make more as they were so popular!

I made these for the 4th of July.  I thought they were a little strong but the rest of the family loved them.  In fact as I write this I still have a few in the fridge waiting to be sucked down.  I doubt they will last past today.

This recipe definitely has inspired me though.  I see endless possibilities for jello shots over the course of the summer.

Good. I used whipped creme vodka which was really good with it.
