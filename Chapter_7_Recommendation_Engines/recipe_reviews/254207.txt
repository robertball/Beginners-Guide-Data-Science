This was absolutely delicious and I can’t wait to make it again. I was looking for a recipe to use up some apples on the counter and butternut squash in my freezer. I didn’t have sausage on hand but did have bacon which was a wonderful swap. I also substituted the syrup with honey because it was all I had on hand. This recipe is very forgiving and versatile. You could add cranberries for a Christmas side, or add in other types of squash. Acorn squash would be delicious with this glaze and some chopped apples! This recipe is a wonderful base for all things fall.

Excellent! Served hot. The apples took longer to cook down, they were very firm, but it was easy to time each element of this dish so it came out hot. The family loved it. Very sweet.

I turned it into a casserole. I followed recipe but cooked squash and apples in casserole dish for 45 minutes (at 350) then mashed it up, added sausage and warmed for another 10-15 minutes. It’s great because I needed a gluten and dairy free casserole for a brunch. Hopefully everyone likes it - my hubby said he loves it! Very fall.

Made it! Really good. Great without the sauce, delicious with it. For lower glycemic days I would omit the sauce.

Such a simple recipe and, Oh, so good!  This is both savory and sweet with the flavors of Fall running through it.   The sweetness of the apple, the creamy, savory butternut squash with just enough sausage blended in, it's a hit!
It pairs perfectly with an ice cold glass of milk.   Just delicious.

Amazing! The flavors are so well combined and the texture is so right. The milk just works perfectly. Thank you for sharing.
