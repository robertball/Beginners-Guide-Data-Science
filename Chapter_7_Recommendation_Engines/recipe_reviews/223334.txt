This recipe was good except that is was a bit sweet. I would not add the extrq sugar that is calls for and I used onely onc can of creamed corn which seemed to be enough.  I think this would be a good recipe for a potluck.

I got my picky eater to eat zucchini and squash,lol. I did shred the squash and red onion  instead of chopping. I would omit the sugar in the future, it really isn't needed and use fresh  garlic instead of garlic powder.

Pretty good but rich.  I sub'd out vegan sour cream for the cream cheese b/c I'm lactose intolerant and there didn't seem to be anything missing from the taste.  I found the savory taste a bit off putting only because I do eat corn casserole which is quite  sweet.  I might make again b/c it is a good way to get rid of zucchini, but I'd keep out the onion, garlic and black pepper.  Still, all in all, pretty good.

This is good comfort food, but for all the vegetables in it, it only tastes like corn and cornbread (which might be the point).  I was just hoping for a few more flavors.

Wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be.  It was lacking in taste and texture.  I read back over the ingredients after I tasted it to see if I missed something.  I did use fresh garlic and yellow onions instead of purple and only one can of cream corn instead of two.  Perhaps I will try again when my next batch of zucchini comes in.

Definitely a keeper! I substituted all yellow squash rather than using squash and zucchini.

The favor was great but the texture was a little off. I baked it for an hour and it still was softer than I would have preferred. I think if I make it again I will omit the second can of cream corn.

I was on a mission to use what I had in the house so I replaced zucchini with asparagus. I didn't have Parmesan so I used shredded cheddar cheese. I omitted the regular can of corn, used more pepper, and some salt. Turned out great!
