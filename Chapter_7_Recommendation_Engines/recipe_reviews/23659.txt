Great and sweet. I fixed it two times without cherry pie filling, and it was excellent. Be sure to cool completely the chocolate/sweetened condensed milk and to beat cream until very stiff. Quick, easy, tasty.

The taste was very nice, but it didn't set up.
Which may have been my fault.

This tastes great, but the filling is too liquid to stay in the pie.  I had a deep dish crust and it still spilled over the edge a bit.  Also, I had to leave it in the freezer overnight for it to be solid enough to cut--the refrigerator wasn't good enough.  Still, I really liked the taste of the filling and would make it on its own, possibly paired with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

I used an 8 oz container of cool whip instead of heavy whipping cream. I also didn't do the almond extract or cherries on top, but put extra cool whip on top and then garnished with chocolate syrup drizzled across top and some chocolate shavings.  It was delish!
