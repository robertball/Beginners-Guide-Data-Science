Made it twice, just using 1 cup of honey, no sugar. 2nd time used gala apples instead of pear. Both times turned out awesome. Super easy!

The cranberry sauce was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!   I reduced sugar to 1/2  cup and substituted 1/4 tsp  ground cinnamon .

I discovered this recipe for Thanksgiving and we loved it so much I made it again at New Year's.  I always hold back the honey till the end and add to taste, as you never really know how tart the cranberries will be or how sweet the pear.  I recommend clover honey because its mild flavor will not compete with the other flavors.  I also used a Bosc pear the first time and an Anjou the second. Both were good.  Thanks for a new holiday tradition.

Great recipe, but I opted for Gala apples, no sugar and 3/4s cup of honey. Everyone but a few youngsters seemed to like it.

Well I made last night review overall good but a few people didnâ€™t care for the cinnamon taste brought out.  If you love cinnamon, great recipe, if so-so cinnamon can probably not the recipe for you.
