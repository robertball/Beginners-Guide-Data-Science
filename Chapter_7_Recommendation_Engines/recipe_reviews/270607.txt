I absolutely loved this dish! I added a little bit more bacon bits and I added about a cup more of cheese!

I agree with Betsy.  This was absolutely delicious.  I made as written except I didn't add the butter.  I figured once I mashed it up, I could always add it if it wanted.  I did make a HUGE mistake when making this in the IP.  I read the directions incorrectly and left it in the pot for 5 minutes before decompressing.  If you do this, you will come out with broccoli puree. (Which is scrumptious; and which everyone thought it was supposed to be LOL).  I'll make this again and hit the vent as soon as the minute is up.
