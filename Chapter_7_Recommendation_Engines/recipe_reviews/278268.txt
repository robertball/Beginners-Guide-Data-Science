I love baking with my grandson, and we made this over the weekend.  It was a lot of fun to mix and make, and an unusual presentation that set it aside from just the same old cookie baking routine.  Plus it tastes amazing!  Really moist.  My only caution if you are baking with small kids with short attention spans is the 45 minute cook time...have another activity planned while it's baking.

Supervised my 8yo granddaughter making this cookie. She had a grand ol' time. It came out very well and we sliced it into small pieces. 4 stars because we both agreed it was too sweet. Next time we'll cut the white sugar down to 6 or 7 tbls.

This is good but it could be better. The cookie dough tastes flat not as good as regular cookie.
