This was one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. I don't like to bake and this turned out so simple and successful. I was so pleased.I used a bag of silvered almonds that I bought and had in the house.  I thought it tasted like a toffee bar. It was a pleasure to have something turn out so good and no hassle. Thanks!

these are great and pretty easy to make. Not by any means healthy though. I really couldn't bring myself to use more than 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter and it turned out really well. This is really sweet though and it's a good thing to cut into really really small pieces.

I've made these every year as christmas gifts for the last 5 years. Everyone raves about them. I use cinnamon graham crackers and add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the butter mix while baking. I also use the high butter fat European butter. It gives them a richer,fuller taste.

So simple even a caveman could do it, Really! :)  These were the most popular snack at a recent get together.  Super quick from start to finish, and you probably have all the ingredients on hand already.  If you love the taste of toffee, you'll love these - YUMMMMM!

These were a hit at our party.  I tried chocolate on just a few of them and I definitely liked it.  I will put chocolate on all of them the next time i make them.  So simple and pretty tasty!

I didn't have any almonds so I used cashew chunks instead. I expected the bars to taste more like toffee, but it's probably the almonds that give it the toffee-like taste. I would use less butter too, they are a bit oily. Other than that though, super easy and quick recipe. :)

Well, apparently I am worse than a caveman. *sigh* I don't know where I went wrong. Maybe because I cut it in half to fit in a 8x8 pan?? It seemed to watery to put on top of the crackers, it just made them soggy. I'm afraid to try it again. :(

I have made this recipe with brown sugar and regular sugar - both versions are excellent.  I prefer the white sugar version.  Just remember if you do use the white sugar, don't add vanilla.  My kids LOVE this recipe.  On the white sugar version, use 2 sticks of butter melted with 1/2 cup white sugar.  More than sweet enough and delicious!

Delicious. Kinda like a praline. I reduced the sugar and the butter, still great and simple.

I used to make this with my Mom when I was a kid. Lost the recipe, but this is it! Thank you! By the way, it is an excellent sweet, not TOO crunchy cookie. Always one of my favorites during the holidays.

This recipe was too sweet for us.  Somewhat greasy.  If I made it again, it would have less butter and sugar.
