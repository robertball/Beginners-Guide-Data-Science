This is really good. I made it for Thanksgiving.  I had rave reviews.  I put the dressing on the whole salad and regretted it.  If it is not eaten with in an hour or so it gets slimey.  The flavor was excellent.  Also  a few previous reviewers mentioned that the dressing was to much and I'd like to say that you have to use balsamic vinegar and stone ground mustard.  Balsamic vinegar is milder then other vinegars.  That may be why others found the dressing to much.

"Great salad!" was H's comment about this one (and I make a lot of great salads, so he's no sucker). The dressing IS strong, so you probably don't want all of it. If you're going to toss it as instructed, just use a small amount to start. I drizzled it over the salad and had it on the side for people to add more if they wanted. Fruit, balsamic and blue cheese is always big hit with me. Thanks for the recipe!

I tweeked this somewhat.  I didn't have pears so I omitted them.  I didn't have blue cheese so I used feta cheese.  It was a big success.

The taste of the dressing was not what we expected. It was very strong. It over powered the sweet taste of the apples and cranberries.

I couldn't wait to try your recipe since you said it was great.  The dressing tasted very good, but the salad turned wilted before I could get it on the table (less than 3 minutes).

Really enjoyed this salad.  Great flavor and texture.  Perfect light salad for summer.  I used Feta instead of blue cheese and I might add a litte red onion next time around.  But all in all really liked this and would make it again!

One of my favorite salads. LOVE the dressing. I used romaine cause that's what I had on hand, and omitted the apple cause it just didn't need it. The pear was plenty.

This is the perfect salad - I do make this from time to time, although I use a little less mustard and add some sugar or honey to the dressing.

Skip the mustard dressing and make a simple balsamic and it gets five stars. I've even added sliced steak for a main course. Use Paul Newmans light balsamic in a pinch.

I thought this salad to be delicious!  The only thing I did differently after tasting the dressing was to make a double portion, put it in a pretty jar, and allow people to add it to their own greens, knowing that it would be too bold for some.  It also kept greens crisper.  We paired with a savory chicken dish.

Excellent salad! My husband said it is the best he ever had!??!! I substituted the blue cheese with chunky fresh mozzerella balls cut up  and used candied pecans.. This definetly is a keeper. The salad dressing was easy and tasty complement. I also substituted the pear with an asian pear.

This was pretty good, but really missing something.  I think the dressing needs a little sweetness to it...maybe some honey wisked into it?  We ended up using WAY more blue cheese than called for to add some more flavor.  I would suggest doubling the blue cheese, wisking some honey into the dressing, and only using tart (maybe green) apples.  We enjoyed this, but expected better.
