It came out absolutely perfect!
If you increase the guava paste by 1/4 cup and the baking soda by  1/4 tsp it will be super moist.

My mother and I made this guava cake recently in Hawaii, where you'll find that most guava cakes are light and spongey, with a natural tinge of guava-pink. This particular recipe yielded a moist, sweet, orange-colored cake that was almost like banana bread. This cake was especially good the next morning for breakfast, sliced like bread and slathered with a bit of butter. Few people, even in Hawaii, are likely to find fresh guavas, however. Try guava paste from specialty food stores. Enjoy! Aloha!

born and raised in Hawaii, i am addicted to guava cake. i gave this recipe to a friend in Hawaii, it is so easy to make because guava's grow on every corner of the streets on the Big Island. it was a hit!, it was different than the original "Hawaiian Guava Cake", the original is Pink and very fluffy, almost like an Angel Food Cake tecture. But, this was delicious as well...

This cake was so good! I used canned guava paste in place of fresh guavas. It turned out like a bread more than a cake. Will make again.

Really a lovely cake.  I had so many compliments.  I would suggest being very careful when getting the guava pulp--the seeds would make an uncomfortable finding in your cake!  Overall, this was more like a spice cake; very moist, but I don't know if many people could have figured out it was guava without my saying so.  That said, everyone liked it and I was asked for the recipe by three people.  Just as a note, I used freshly grated nutmeg and put some guava nectar in the frosting.  I will definitely make this cake again.

I live in Africa and its guava season. Didnt know what to do with my ripe guavas so I googled guava recipes and it brought me to your site. The cake came out fluffy, sweet and guavalicious, I put a drop of lemon essence to add flavour. Im gonna ask my neighbour if I can use some of his guavas to make another cake tomorrow!

It was pretty good.  If you are using fresh guava, make sure you get all the seeds out.  It's annoying to bite into a seed.  I made some frosting with guava nectar because the cake doesn't taste much like guava.

This cake was great!  My guavas were not bursting ripe so they didn't have as much flavor and as a result the guava flavor was really light.  It tasted very nutmeggy and clovey.  I made a cream cheese guava icing that everyone else said they tasted the guava in, but not so much the cake.  However it tasted yum!

Very subtle Guava flavor. I used fresh over-ripe yellow guava shells, pureed with a little bit of pear and water to help it along. I increased the amount of guava by about 1/2 cup, used a square 9x9 pan, and baked it for 50 minutes, reducing the temperature 1/2 way to account for the extra guava and smaller pan. It came out perfectly moist. I would eliminate the spices next time, to see if it brings more of the Guava flavor. But it's really good, and rich.

This is a great recipe.  My 5 guava trees are keeping us busy.  I scoop out the guava pulp, mush it and boil in some water on the stovetop; I haven't added the store bought guava ingredients, just using our "locally sourced" guavas.  I haven't figured out how to get rid of all the little seeds but they don't seem to bother anyone in my family. I also baked it in a loaf pan for a bit longer than specified here - just using a knife in the cent to know that it's done.  Tasty, tasty, tasty!

this was really easy to make & allowed me to use some of my excess guavas. my boyfriend ate some of it plain and a dinner guest tried it with with whipped cream & sliced guavas. no one loved it- but they ate it and said it was good. i didn't like the cake itself, so didn't want to spend too much time trying to create an icing/glaze- as i have a lot more guava to process so am going to look for a different cake recipe. but it was incredibly easy to make so i am giving it 3 stars for that.

I halved this recipe and made it as muffins.  They turned out fantastic!  The texture was perfect, crispy at the edges but smooth and almost creamy inside.  I like it as-is, but the next time I make it I will swap out the spices for ginger powder to see if the guava flavor comes out a little more.  Oh, I also threw 2T of chia seeds in.

Wow, this is SO good! I halved the recipe and since I had no guava juice at home, I substituted with more guava puree and added a little water to balance things out. Added a wee more baking soda as suggested by Raquelns, and topped it with some fresh cream and more guava puree just before serving. Awesome!

I made it twice
!st time as written except 1/8 t of nutmeg
2nd time no spices just a dash of vanilla
I preferred it plain. The guava flavor shined through.
Good moist tender cake.

Very good use of pineapple guavas.  Dense like an applesauce cake but with a definite guava perfume.

I love this cake..it's soooo tasty and can be eaten without a sauce or icing.
