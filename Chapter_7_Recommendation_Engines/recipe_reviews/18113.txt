Excellent!!  This was delicious - instead of broiling, I baked the eggplant (400 degrees for 45 minutes), then peeled, drained and chopped it.  I also decreased the olive oil down to 2T rather than 3T.  Will definately be making this again!

I have had eggplant caviar many many times and it has never tasted or looked this bad. 

Dill does not belong in eggplant caviar. 'Nuff said.

I added a little garlic powder and used chopped scallions.  Everyone spread it on crackers and raved at our family reunion!

I found my first attempt with this recipe a little too salty--my fault for seasoning before tasting.  I think when I make this again--and I will--I'll add 2 cloves of garlic, a little lemon juice, and cut down the salt.  I found it to taste better cold.  Not kiddy food, but the grownups will like it.  Thanks, Ms. Mann.

I make a version of this from a different recipe that has garlic and capers instead of onions, and basil and parsley instead of dill.  I bake some pita bread to make "chips" to server alongside this dish.

This is delicious with some slight alterations.  All they had at the grocery store were slightly smaller eggplants so I broiled it 10 minutes on each side.  In the meantime, I sauteed an entire small onion I diced with 2 cloves of smashed and chopped garlic in just a tad bit of olive oil.  It only took a few minutes.  I added that to the eggplant pulp.  I didn't measure my other ingredients.  I did it more to taste.  I also left out the dill.  It did need a nice amount of kosher salt to add some flavor.  I plan on making this all the time.  My husband and I both love it.

Yep.  Looks icky in the end, and still tastes really good.  I took pts from other reviewers...cut back on OO, added garlic powder, cut back on dill a bit.  I like the fact that it is low-cal, and healthy.

Well, this recipe definately caught my eye!  Eggplant Caviar??  It is WONDERFUL.  Even if you don't like eggplant, you'll never notice it!  This is definately a dish for onion lovers.  It is quite oniony.  I had this as an appetizer for Easter Dinner and everyone loved it!  ***Note:  It looks quite icky once mixed, but it's delicious, never fear!!

Everyone loved this recipe - even the kids. The dill makes it. The only thing I measured was the olive oil, and it was not greasy at all. Omitted the salt. Yes, it does not look all that appealing, but once you convince people to give it a try, they really like it!

I gave this 2 stars because I spent more time tweaking this recipe that it ended up being different than the original recipe. So much that I will make whatever it was again. I thought this recipe was bland and I added small diced tomato, pine nuts and  seasonings. I wasn't crazy about the dill idea so at first I omitted the dill. After tasting and tasting with the salt and pepper (onion and garlic powder too) I finally added the dill and that helped but something was still missing. 

I love eggplant and always looking for new ways to prepare it. This recipe is a great base to add your favorite seasonings if your not happy with the dill or taste. This may be about balance - between the salt olive oil and pepper?

You know how it is - you see a recipe, read rave review after rave review. You make the meal, and it's fantastic! You look back at the reviews and see one that gives the meal 1 star. You wonder 'What the?? What planet is this person on? The meal was awesome!!!' Well, as far as this recipe goes, I *am* that person. Sorry, but this was horrible. It looks unappetizing, smells weird and tastes even weirder. This is the 3rd time I've had egg-plant (or 'aubergine' as we call it back home), and I have yet to see the appeal.

This was much too salty, but has good flavor. The consistency was too slimy and I wasn't sure how to fix that.

It was quite good for how simple the recipe is though there was a bit too much salt in the original recipe for my liking. An unusual taste at least as far as my personal experiences go but enjoyable.

I was disappointed in both the flavor and appearance of this dish.  I didn't have fresh dill because I couldn't find it in the store so maybe that makes the difference.

Not like my mom used to make.
Eggplant has to be chopped too with a knife along with onions and tomatoes. Add a little garlic (chopped)  and that is it. The secret is how to chop eggplant. It has to be in little pieces no larger than 1/8 of the inch.

I must have done something wrong when I cooked this.  It was not very tasteful even though it was edible.  I am not rating how it looks because there is nothing u can do about how mashed eggplant looks.  Will try one more time, maybe.

it was missing something in flavor.  Also, I baked for 10 minutes on each side and when I cut it open, it wasn't cooked in the middle, so I baked longer, but still--it was hard to scoop out the insides and the texture wasn't quite as smooth as I would have hoped.

I modified this recipe since it looked too plain to me. To save time I used my meat grinder and grinded eggplants, tomatoes, onions. Mixed it all in a bowl and instead of olive oil, I added mayo with some salt and pepper. Of course garlic is a must in this dish. I love this with rice crispy crackers and my daughter loves it too.

I made some tasty changes to this recipe.  I grilled the onions and garlic, gave it a wonderful taste instead of raw onions.  I did not add the dill, instead I added capers to taste along with the salt and pepper. I added 2 tablespoons of EVO and boy was this Eggplant the best.  I had a similar dish at a  Persian Restaurant called the BandBar in the Gas Lamp District of San Diego, California and the eggplant was the best appetizer I have ever eaten with Middle Eastern flat bread...Wow!!!  :)
