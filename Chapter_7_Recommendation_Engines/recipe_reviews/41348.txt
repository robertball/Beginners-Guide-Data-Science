I used a different marinade, but this horseradish sauce is AWESOME.  I increased the horseradish to 2 Tbs. and substituted 1 tsp. onion powder for the green onions.  It was great with the flank steak and even delicious with hash brown potatoes (I'm going to try on baked potatoes next).

Not bad, at all.  I was suprised that the meat was tenderized so much.  I used a low-cost piece of meat and it turned out very well.

My husband and I ate this last night and loved it.  We especially liked the horseradish sauce. I work for a catering company that makes a full-fat horseradish that is to die for, and this came pretty dang close.

This was a good marinade and a flavorful dip.  I made exactly as stated except I broiled it in the oven.  Makes ordinary meat seem a little more special.  I served this with one of my all-time favorites, Horseradish Potatoes which can also found on this site.

I am sorry to say that I didn't actually prepare the meat, just the sauce, to go on some Italian beef sandwiches.  SOOOO good!!  :)  I will DEFINITLEY make this sauce again and again!!  (and you can't beat that it's low fat... :)

I didn't even use the horseradish sauce. The meat was so flavorful and tender. This is definitely one I will make again and again.

I enjoyed th sauce very much. I look forward to the marinade, however I will have to waite for the flank steak. I used the sauce on a regular steak. I actually have a craving for the sauce, I want to use it on my hamburger.

YUM-O!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a great recipe!  We served this for company and got RAVE reviews from a friend who doesn't like horseradish. I ate just too much because it was soo good!! I can't wait to have it for leftovers tomorrow!  I bought hard rolls and I'll use the leftovers with the sauce for an awesome lunch!  WOW!  Great combo of flavors.  Thanks for this!  I feel like a total gourmet-even though I'm only a good cook!  YUM!

Just made this. I gave it four stars for the meat/marinade. Unlike the others I didn't think the sauce was spectacular, it was just ok. Tasted too much like mayo.

I did not use the marinade for the flank, but used the horseradish sauce recipe.  Very nice sauce for any steak!

We love this! Both the marinade and the sauce are terrific! My husband loves sauces to go with his food and this horseradish sauce is one of his favorites. Great to serve for company - I usually do this and marinated chicken terriyaki so that way you have both beef and chicken for your guests.

I used top round London broil for this recipe.  I assembled the steak and its marinade in the morning. Next time, I'll do it the night before.  The leftovers made excellent sandwiches using the  horseradish sauce instead of mayo or mustard.  I did double the horseradish and add a pinch of black pepper; however, I really like horseradish.

Although I am self admittedly not a steak fan, the rest of the family loves them so I made this and even I enjoyed them.  Rather than flank steaks I used strip steaks that were on sale, and the steaks came out quite tasty.  The marinade was easy and light on ingredients and prep time, but the meat should marinate as long as possible (mine marinated for two days).  The horseradish sauce was excellent, it is a recipe that I will use just for horseradish sauce in general.  Overall an excellent way to prepare steak.

You really won't miss the fat with all the flavor this has.  I used fresh crack pepper instead of the hot sauce because I thought it went better with the other flavors.  For a real flavor kick if you can find it, get some fresh horseradish and finely grate it into the mayo and sour cream instead of prepared horseradish.

My husband and I love horseradish so I could hardly wait to try this recipe.  I wasn't disappointed, it was excellent!  I didn't have flank steak, so used sirloin, otherwise I followed the directions as given as was rewarded with a great steak dinner.  Thanks.
