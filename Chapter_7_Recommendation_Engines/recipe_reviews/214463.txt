Pretty good and extremely easy.  A little vinegar-y for our tastes so I think next time I'm going to use half of the brine and use beer for the rest of the liquid once in the crockpot and add a little more brown sugar into the spice blend.  I like cooking meat with beer in the crockpot as it adds a certain sweetness.  I think this might balance the vinegar out for me.  I look forward to trying it again soon!!

I loved this recipe for a pork roast.  I've had trouble finding a good one I like.  The spices were a good combination and not too much.  Next time I'll add some whole potatoes in towards the end to cook in with it.  I wouldn't change anything with the spices or anything, I liked it the way it was written.

Very easy recipe. had trouble finding a pork shoulder that small, bought an 8 pound, but just doubled the recipe and it turned out AMAZING. This is my first time trying to cook a pulled pork recipe....my teenagers wanted to know when i was going to fix it again! VERY GOOD!

I used the recipe exactly as stated. It was perfect. After it was done I added some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to the meat. I didn't overdo the sauce but enough to my taste. My husband just adds extra sauce to his. I have made pulled pork many times and this is the best!

best. pulled. pork. EVER.  I used cider vinegar and pork tenderloin because that's all I had.  After RAVE reviews from our guests, one of them asked where we had the pork catered from!  It was "melt in your mouth amazing" per my husband.

I made this for our 4th of July celebration with 2 couples from Church. I've been receiving compliments for 3 days. Every time I run into one of the guests they bring it up again. What I did was after pulling the pork I added about 3-4 tablespoons of KC Masterpiece Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and mixed that up real well. Then I put a bowl of the same sauce on the table so everyone could put on as much or little BBQ sauce as they wanted. It's been said this BBQ was as good as any restaurant and I'm in NC where BBQ is a really big deal. While it takes a lot of time it's actually very little work. Other than the sauce I followed the recipe exactly. Best ever BBQ sandwiches

I made a 8 lb shoulder in my largest slow cooker and it fit fine. I was worried about some of the comments re:the vinegar taste so after brining overnight, I drained off half the liquid and replaced with beer. Cooked overnight (about 14 hours) and woke up to the most delicious smell filling the house! strained the liquid into a bowl and added the meat and let cool in the fridge. OH MY GOD. The BEST BBQ I have EVER had bar none! I stored the pulled pork in the liquid in the fridge and no one least of all me could leave it alone! Served it as sandwiches with my homemade hot and sweet BBQ sauce. HEAVEN! GREAT RECIPE FOR LIFE!!!

Was a great hit! I used hawaiian rolls and made mini-sliders. Make sure when shredding to get all the good meat away from the fat. Will use again!

Loved the recipe, but who has the space to put a ceramic bowl in their refrige that can hold a 3 or 4 pound pork shoulder? I've got food (and beer!) to keep cold! :D  I kept the vinegar\water ratios in tack but chose a large (1 gal+) freezer bag to put the pork in. I then put that in a plastic trash bag as a "leak-proof" measure and tied it off in a knot...other than that, it's a great recipe!

Easy to prepare! Cooked for 8 hours in crock pot, was easy to pull apart and separate the fat from the meat. Added about a cup and a half of barbecue sauce for flavor. It was the hit of the party!

This was my first experience with brining.  It was a great recipe to start with.  We loved it.  However, the next time I will put the crock pot in the laundry room to cook, as the vinegar smell really bothered me.  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe.

I tried this and had the same to much vinegar flavor. Ended having to through it out. When I went back over the recipe sure I had done something wrong, noticed what must be a miss print in #2. Was it suppose to read pour out brine leaving 2 inches in the bottom? This might have made a difference. Would like to try again making that change.

I made this for a Sunday afternoon get together and it was a major hit. I drained off most of the brining liquid and added a beer as some reviews mentioned. I also took the time to sear the outside of the roast with salt, pepper, and paprika before putting it into the crockpot. This really helped add some flavor and some texture to the meat. I added a tablespoon of Old Bay, a few cloves of diced garlic and an extra onion to the crock pot as well.  

One review mentioned boiling the remaining sauce down and adding a little brown sugar, which was a wonderful idea. It turned into a delicious homemade barbeque sauce with some extra tweaking.

Finally, I made some cole slaw from the "Awesome Cole Slaw" recipe found on this site and served it with the meat on buns. It was seriously awesome.

Eat it.

This is awesome! All kinds of compliments. Some even saying it was better than Dickeys. I've used apple cider vinegar and the regular distilled vinegar and the apple cider vinegar is better.

This was soooo delicious!!  I used apple cider vinegar, but other than that I followed the recipe  to the letter. My pork shoulder was about 4 pounds.  I let it brine about 16 hours and it cooked for about 9 hours.  Pretty easy to shred, and basically fell off the bone.  I served on toasted kaiser rolls, and topped with coleslaw.  Perfect game day dinner!

I've made this 3 times now, and it was best when I soaked it in vinegar/water for 12 hours, then added the kosher salt, then soaked for another 12 hours.  Not too salty, not too tangy.  Perfect!

To the reviewer who cooked the roast and then put it in the refrigerator to pull apart the next day, and then found it to be very fatty:  you need to pull it apart while it is still warm, 15 or 20 minutes after you have taken it out of the slow cooker.  That way it shreds easily and it is easy to separate the meat from the fat.  The same principle is at work when you de-bone chicken.  As soon as it is cool enough to handle, that's when it will slide right off the bone.  Once it is cold, it is a different story alltogether.

This was great! I forgot the salt in the overnight brine (used mostly white vinegar with what little apple cider I had left.) Omitted onion (didn't have one) and cooked on high b/c of what time I started it. So yummy and moist - I always add bbq sauce to my bbq but this was so moist it didn't even need it.

This is a great recipe for pulled pork. I couldn't find a 3 lb. shoulder so I bought a 7 lb. and cut it in half. Put the other half in the freezer to cook a pot roast later.  Followed the recipe exactly, when it was done I strained the fat from the sauce and discarded, brought the sauce to a boil added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup brown sugar, poured it over the pulled meat. It was delicious!  It needed just a little more sweet to off set some of the vinegar.  Also tried it with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and it was so good.  The blend of both spice sets really compliment each other.  Made some cole slaw to go with it and YUMMY!
This is a keeper. I live in NC which known for it's pork barbecue.  This is about as good as any I've had before. It's good with or without the Sweet Baby Ray's.

Just making this now. It's my first time using a slow cooker and first time making pulled pork.  Am concerned about the amount of vinegar left once pouring off just enough brine to expose 1/2 inch of pork.  The spice mixture is literally heaped on the exposed surface of the pork like mountain.  This can't be right.  Should I pour off more brine?  Don't want to ruin $40 worth of pork.

I love this recipe.  The pork is so flavorful and tender. That hint of vinegar is so unique and wonderful. I did use Apple Cider Vinegar. I didn't have Kosher salt so I used regular. And like other reviewers, I found that the original recipe has a potential error.  When draining off the liquid, you can expose 1/2 the meat or even 2/3 of the meat.  I've made this 3 or 4 times and will never make the other recipes again.  And like others, I prefer Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.

Great recipe! We listened to a few reviews and changed the white vinegar to apple cider vinegar - a little bit more expensive but worth it!! We also used a bone-in pork shoulder as it was on sale at our local grocery store - terrific!!  We brined the pork over night for 12hours and then removed as much liquid as recipe called for - then added about 1bottle of beer as the remaining liquid as suggested from other reviewers. Delicious!   This is an easy, crowd pleasing, tasty recipe I recommend. We will definatley make over and over.

I don't like vinegary food and was nervous after some of the reviews, but this is terrific and was a special request on a family vacation recently. 

I do make a couple changes. I use apple cider vinegar and a 6-7 lb. shoulder. You don't have to increase any of the other ingredients and since the pork takes up most of the space, you use less vinegar and it's not as tangy. Then I drain the vinegar to expose 1/2-1 inch and rub half the sugar mix on the pork and sprinkle the other half into the vinegar mixture for more even flavoring. Terrific, moist and easy to shred. You can eat it as is, with a little sweet bbq sauce or in eggs.

You should have seen the kids' faces when I told them we were having pulled pork with slop sauce for dinner. Slop sauce, what's that?! It has become a family favorite. This is really easy and comes out great. I make this every time pork roast goes on sale. I use apple cider vinegar and add a little more brown sugar and some cayenne pepper. Being from the South, I like the sweet heat!

3 stars for flavor, 4 for tenderness, 5 for aroma! If/when I make this again (I probably will because I love using my crock pot), I'd substitute a bunch of the vinegar with - ??? - maybe plain old apple cider.  We had friends for dinner who are originally from the South, though, and they really liked it, so it could be just a regional thing - plus the fact that due to a change in plans, we left it marinating for 3 days instead of 24 hours.  Oops.  ;)  I'll definitely give this another shot, though.

Excellent! Excellent! Reviews say strong vinegar taste -- not to me. I used 1/2 apple cider & 1/2 distilled vinegars Cooking time varies with slow cooker.

First, the smallest I could find was a 6 pounder and it barely fit in my BIG cooker.  I had to first slice off huge amounts of fat on the thing.  I followed the original recipe - brining, slow-cooking.  Put it in frig to pull apart the next day.  Well, it was tender but it was so fatty throughout that I pulled enough for two sandwiches and threw the rest away.  There was just WAY too much fat for our taste.  I'll stick with slow-cooking beef that's not as fatty or artery-clogging.  Tasted fine.

very very strong vinegar taste. i'd cut down by 50% and try it again as it drowned out all of the other lovely spices. texture was good however.

This recipe is great.  I substituted apple cider vinegar for white and I forgot the onion but it still came out great.  I particularly like this recipe because it will go well with any bbq sauce you put on it afterwards.  Some have complained about to strong of a vinegar taste but I disagree, I enjoy the subtle vinegar flavor.  Great recipe and plenty left to freeze.

I am from NC and love Eastern NC style BBQ/pulled pork!  This is SO easy and delicious - I used cider vindegar, brined about 8-10 hours and cooked overnight in croc pot for 8-10 hours! I had recently purchased a vinegar based bbq sause in the grocery so I used a bottle of that and some of the brining juice to cook it in... didnt even have to use extra seasonsing/spices.

I followed this recipe exactally the way it was written. I soaked the pork roast for 12 hours and cooked it for 8 hours in the crockpot. Although this recipe was very easy, my entire family found the taste to be over killed with vinegar. I will never try this recipe again,.

Hope you like vinegar! My husband and I love pulled pork. Made this recipe exactly and anticipated it all day. What a let down. The vinegar was so overpowering we won't be eating the left overs and we could barely finish the meal. The only good thing I can say is it was extremely tender. I can't believe more people have not commented on the flavor.

It had too much vinegar--and I grew up eating German, so I know about vinegar. There just was not any "zing" besides the vinegar. Would not waste my pork on this recipe.

Excellent!  Used a 6 lb. pork shoulder roast, bone in.  Added as much of the liquid as my 6 qt. slower cooker allowed leaving the 1/2 inch uncovered.  Doubled spices.  Cooked on high 8.5 hours.  It was a hit, and I don't usually bring the main course meat dish!  After shredding and putting meat back in slow cooker, added a little cayenne pepper and BBQ sauce.  How I wish there were some leftovers!  Thanks.

The recipe is super simple to make. I made this recipe almost as directed. I used one less cup of vinegar after reading some of the comments; but I'm sure I could have used the proper 2:1 ratio as directed without a problem. I stopped my after 8.5hrs instead of going longer and it was falling off the bone; but I'm sure if I had gone another hour to hour and half it would have been even better. Regardless, I will definitely be making this again.

I couldn't get past the overwhelming "tangy" flavor from the vinegar marinade and I love punches of flavor.  It's an easy recipe and the seasoning on top was nice but I wouldn't make this again without major changes, starting first with the quantity of vinegar.

This turned out to be an amazing dish! I used red wine vinegar instead of white and we all loved it. I served it on a big toasted bun with a tiny bit of BBQ sauce and a salad on the side. It was a hit! I will definitely be making it again.

Okay, the smell was great when I walked in the house from work.  I used 4 c. apple cider vinegar and 4 c. white distilled vinegar.  Made everything else exactly the same.  It was very over powering with vinegar.  My daughter, who loves meat even I don't like, couldn't finish it.  We put some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on the buns also and still too much. I can tell it can be a perfect recipe for pulled pork, but just have to figure out the right amount of vinegar.

This is THE MOST fantastic recipe I have ever made. I followed it TO-THE-LETTER only after separating the pork did I add some honey bbq to the mix. I made it for a family of 3, and we had well over 2/3rds left over. 

Amidst writing this review, I am nibbling of course on leftovers. 

I can't tell you how easy this was to prepare, and make. I have passed this recipe on to people I know who love pulled pork sandwiches as much as I do.

Thank you! This is a keeper.

I have been making a different pulled pork recipe for years.  This recipe smoked it!  It was OUTSTANDING.  I did 2-to-1 on the vinegar and let it brine for 24 hours.  Well done!

This came out beautifully.  Not too fatty, and without the full-on bbq flavor that most crockpot pulled pork recipes seem to have (I prefer to sauce after pulling).  I had been concerned it'd be too vinegary but you really don't get any acid taste except a very faint bite which is quite pleasant.  I did, however, use apple cider vinegar instead of white, since that was what I had around and I think it's got a nicer flavor anyway.

Extremely tender, tasty, and easy. I cut the chili powder in half to be sure that it wasn't too spicy and it was still delicious. Served as sandwiches with BBQ sauce on the side. Just wish that I'd made a larger roast -- this is definitely not 10 hearty servings.

The pork shoulder was tender, but for my family the vinegar was too strong for our taste. I dont know what I can use instead of the vinegar, because the dry spices where a very nice flavor. I even poured off more than 1/2 of the vinegar after the marinated time to reduce the vinegar taste. I will not be in a hurry to make this again....the pork is still in the refrig, but as for a tender pork shoulder this recipe did deliver, but a little off on taste.

Too vinegarrrry!!  Easy recipe, but next time I would use a standard brine maybe mixed w/beer.  The rub was good  (added paparika for a little kick) and could be used on fish or chicken.  
Served w/ bbq sauce to cover the vinegar taste ontop garlic toast.

I made it exactly as written. It was spectacular! Tender, moist and awesome flavor. I fished the onions out and discarded. No BBQ sauce needed, in my opinion! I'm adding this to our family favorites! I think my pork roast was about 4#. It makes alot--I would estimate it serves 8 ppl at least. YUMMY!

I was hesitant about trying this recipe because of the vinegar but it had good reviews so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did, it's awesome!  I used slightly less vinegar than the recipe called for only because I didn't have enough.  It was just the right amount of flavor.  Super easy recipe!  Will be making again soon!

Definitely going to use this one again.  I don't have THAT much vinegar on hand so I ended up using about equal portions of white and cider vinegar with a touch of white wine vinegar just to have enough to mostly cover the meat.  I also didn't have ground mustard on hand - so I used whole mustard seeds.  Might be missing something (will have to see next time), but it still turned out really nicely with a lovely tangy taste to it.

Excellent taste for such a very simple recipe. Last night we had carnitas and tonight pork shoulder sliders with BBQ sauce and Hawaiian rolls. Mmmm. Love it!

Other than the fact that you need to begin prep a day before you want to serve, this recipe is really easy and not to mention tastes fantastic!  I add a little BBQ sauce to the shredded meat, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  For the leftovers, I freeze them in muffin tins and then store them in freezer bags.  The resulting single serving "meat pucks" are just as good as the origional when thawed out later!

GREAT recipe. Seems time consuming but its really not. I've made it several times and have had to leave out some of the spices on occasions because I didn't have them on hand and the meat still came out delicious.

The meat had the perfect consistency but the amount of vinegar was too tangy for my families tasts.  Next time I will cut the vinegar in half or drain much much more of it out before cooking.

I was skeptical after reading the reviews of too much vinegar taste. I did not think it had much of a vinegar taste at all. I thought it was excellent. I added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper to rub. I used  Sweet baby Rays bbq sauce with the pull pork which was delicious. I also tried one with a mayonnaise garlic mix in addition to the bbq mix. 1 cup mayonnaise and two cloves of garlic minced mixed together. This was even better.

First time ever cooking pulled pork and using my slow cooker. Something went wrong, because the taste of vinegar is very strong; the pork meat was very dry, and my hopes went cascading to the floor.
I need to find another recipe, if I find the strength to resist the pull from the pork at the store!!

this was fantastic.  as recommended by other reviewers i used apple cider vinegar and poured off enough brine to make room for a can of beer, rubbed the meat down with spice mixture and placed in slow cooker.  awesome.  will definitely be putting this on my summer menu list!!!

Ugh!  Way too vinegary...wish I had listened to some of the negative reviews.  I'm definitely a vinegar person - even put it into my chicken soup when I'm eating it, and my favorite barbecue sauce is the Kansas City style (vinegary).  But when I take a bite of this, and if I inhale when I'm taking a bite, I feel the vinegar in my airways!

Holy white vinegar!  This cleared the sinuses of the entire household.  Even before tasting it the whole house smelled sour.  Awful.  I followed the recipe exactly, though, so am baffled as to how many cooks found this to be a good recipe.  Had to throw it out.

My family didn't like how this smelled while it was cooking, but LOVED it when it was ready to eat! It had a smell similar to Indian foods. I added Lucille's BBQ sauce to it and it was so delicious!

I couldn't find a solid 3 lbs pork shoulder so I used steaks and it cooked a little fast. I set it to high until it boiled and reduced it to low and cut the cooking time in about half and it turned out great! adding bbq sauce upon serving and i'll be eating sandwiches for days. Also adding garlic, carrot, celery (mirepoix) and sachet d'epice with bay leaf, peppercorns, herbs, really helped give this dish a depth of flavor and I would recommend it. (search to find out defs on these french culinary terms)

The pork was delicious. I have a small crock pot, so adjusted the vinegar/water and cut down on the salt a bit. I was nervous that it would taste like vinegar, but it didn't. I also added some Sweet Baby Ray's after shredding, and served more on the side.
Excellent recipe!

wow - this was extremely tender but the vinegar flavor overwhelmed the pork. we used a tomato based sauce - went a little on the sweet side to help override the vinegar...don't know if I would make this again.

This was great. Followed the recipe exactly (halved the meat and so used less vinegar/water) and was not disappointed. My 9yo daughter loved it. I made homemade buns to go with it. Mixed in a touch of sauce. I'll be making this for football parties.

I made this recipe as written and my family ate it as quickly as they could, and asked when I planned to make it again.  I was a little hesitant with all the vinegar, but I think that's what gave it such a great taste.

This is the best!  Even my finicky daughters, ages 7 and 8 look forward to this meal.  I add  some barbecue sauce after I've drained the meat and shredded it, and then I let it cook on low for about 30 minutes--YUMMY!  Be careful with the vinegar.  One time I made it, and it was too vinegary.  The brining is what makes this recipe, though.   It's so easy and great to make on a busy weeknight.

I made this recipe for a birthday party and everyone loved it.  Some put barbeque sauce on their sandwich and some liked it without.  I made it the day before the party so when I put it in the crock pot to heat it on the day of the party I added a little bit of water so that the pork wouldn't dry out.  DELICIOUS!!

This was delish.  I had my doubts about soaking the shoulder all night in water and vinegar, but turned out it was the right thing to do.  The pork broke apart and was moist and tasty.  I will make it again.

Yum! This recipe is a classic and just perfect in our opinion.  I served with just a bit of BBQ sauce mixed in and pickled red onions and it was so tasty.  This is a great base recipe... add some cumin and tex-mex spices and you have your self some Tasty pork for tacos. Thanks Dan!

This has WAY too much vinegar in the ratio, I even reduced the amount by 2 cups and it was overwhelming almost inedible. I would strongly suggest a better balance of acid salt and sweet, I feel the left overs which were plentiful because nobody could eat much will do well soaked in a soup or drenched in a sweet or spicy BBQ sauce to reduce the acidity...but that could be my optimism and refusal to give up talking.

Turned out really amazing, dare I say indistinguishable from the pork shoulder my husband smokes on the green egg?! I used an almost 8 lb piece, that was as small as I could find. Brined for the full 24 hrs. Poured off a little extra brine to make room for a bottle of beer. Used spicy brown mustard, not ground mustard since I didn’t have any - but that worked just as well. Cooked on low for 10 hours and it was falling off the bone tender. Walked in the house with my 4 year old who said “mommy that smells delicious” ??

I read the reviews and altered it myself. I did the Apple cider vinegar, water and salt brine for 24 hours. Poured more than half of the vinegar mixture out the next day, added 1 beer, and sprinkled brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, and chili powder (I just didn’t have cumin and mustard). Added an onion and cooked on high for 10 hours. Removed the pork from the fat into a separate bowl and used hand mixer on lowest speed to shred (awesome and easy!!) added 1.5 cups of favorite bbq sauce and served it on potato bread sliders with Mac and cheese on the side. Hubby loved it.. sooooo good!

I always cook and shred pork before I add BBQ sauce. I never had brined or seasoned pork while cooking. I used apple vinegar and did 3 to 1 for water to vinegar. Also, I added a tablespoon of onion and garlic powder to seasoning. I really did enjoy it but next time I think I'll make a third of my liquid be beer.

I used less vinegar than suggested and used a combination of apple cider vinegar and white vinegar.  The meat is very tender and well cooked but has a vinegar flavor  to it.

I used cider vinegar as others had suggested.  This was THE BEST Pulled Pork of all the variations I have tried!!  The meat was perfectly tender and wonderfully spiced with just the right amount of vinegar tang.  I just bought more pork and vinegar to make it again!  My shoulder was very large, so cooked the full 10 hours.

My family loves this recipe as is. BBQ sauce is usually added and served on buns. Good as leftovers too and I like it better without BBQ. It is also good served without sauce over rice.

I did make miner changes. I removed half of the brine after marinating and replaced it with a can of  beer. It was absolutely, melt in your mouth amazing. It has a very small hint of vinegar that is pleasant. I don't even plan to use barbecue sauce on mine but I can see how it would very appealing if used. I have made pulled pork many, many times and this is right up there among the top three best recipes I've used. I will definitely make this again. My husband RAVED about it and he's used to me making great pulled pork. He asked if I  would prepare this for a company fund raiser they do in the summer at work. Several coworker of his have been smoking pork roasts to sell for this for many years and he believes this recipe will give them a little competition. ??

Excellent!  Only change was that I didn't have the dry mustard.  We did add just a little bit of bbq sauce in the end.   Will be a regular in my house.  Husband loved it.  Super easy.

I've made this exactly as written a couple times now. Making it again tomorrow. I love that you don't need bbq sauce with the meat, just a little of the defatted cooking liquid. Nice and tangy. Whole family likes it.

I feel a bit funny rating this recipe as I did not follow it to a T and I am not a pulled pork connoisseur. Scared by so many people saying it was way too vinegary, I used for 4 1/2 lb shoulder about 2 cups of water, one cup of apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, and about one cup of beer. The meat became wonderful, but is maybe lacking a bit in tang, so next time I will use more vinegar as the recipe calls. I think those who think it is too vinegary may be judging by the taste of the liquid, not the meat separated from it. 
This is a great way to cook a random pork shoulder bought by your husband and forgotten in the freezer for a few months. Also, the dried up clump of brown sugar in my pantry is now considerably smaller! 
For once, you can get ALL the meat out of a pork shoulder very easily. The product is very lean as the fat has melted away. Of course if you add the liquid to the meat after, this is a different story. Will definitely try this again!

I was curious about brining, but will never do it again. This was so salty it was almost inedible. The rest of the spices were delicious... but would never, ever bother with brining again.

This recipe is a keeper. I used a good quality apple vinegar rather than the white vinegar called for, but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully. It was so tender, it was difficult to get out of the crockpot. I'll make it again.

was not too sure of how it would turn out. i did let it simmer for an hours or so more due to me starting it out too early . an hour before i put in my potatoes and eggs to make tatersalid, which really gave it a unique good flavor. this is one i will make more often.

So delicious!  Everyone I make this for raves about it!  I do cut the vinegar down and add either hard alcohol of some sort or beer.  Tastes a bit better - probably only because I am smelling the vinegar all day it seems too strong.

Easy and delicious, one to repeat.  One doesn't need to use as much fluid as specified if the marinating bowl is small enough, just enough fluid to immerse the pork.

Loved this!!!  My husband was speechless and kept saying "Wow" and how tender the meat was. It really was incredible, better than we get in restaurants.   Our  5 year old said, "This is yummy Mommy!".  This by far is our family favorite and I am adding this to the rotations I will make from now on. Thank you for putting this on this site.

This is AMAZING!  I have tried multiple pulled pork recipes and this tops them all.  I made the recipe almost as-is and it was perfect.  I just didn't have enough white vinegar so I did 1/2 white vinegar and 1/4 apple cider vinegar and 1/4 white wine vinegar.  In my opinion, the absolute best way to eat this is with some meat, a little of the cooked onion, coleslaw, and your favorite BBQ sauce ... all on top of Costco's pretzel buns.  Oh I could just DIE!

Delicious and so easy!  Followed other reviewers' advice and drained off half the brine before cooking and replaced it with beer.  8-10 hours on high seemed long, so I checked after 6 hours and it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as written except i used 1/2 cider vinegar and 1/2 white because I didn't have enough white on hand.It smelled great and was tender.Made sandwiches with bbq sauce,cheddar and onion rolls and loved it.Used it the next night for tacos with salsa and sour cream.You could really taste the vinegar with the tacos.I love NC style bbq but without the heavier flavors to mask it this was too tangy for me.

Amazing!  I didn't add as much vinegar as it asked for because I simply didn't have much.  But according to other reviewers it would have tasted too vinegary anyways.  It came out perfect!  This is a keeper!

Yum! A recipe that is easy tweak so you can give it your own signature touch whatever that might be. 

I let it sit in the brine 24 hours. Removed the necessary amount of brine and added a bottle of beer and cooked for 10 hours. I will definitely be making this one again.

This is good barbecue. I like St Louis, Memphis, East Carolina, South Carolina, western Carolina, TExas, you name it. I've learned to enjoy all flavors and you won't hear me whining about too much vinegar,too much mustard, etc. IF you don't like barbecue, don't eat it! 
Slow cooking pork is the way to go as far as I'm concerned. Only thing better is one of those roadside huts with the smoker out back.

This recipe produced a tender, juicy pulled pork. I was worried about the vinegar but it came out great! Add your favorite BBQ sauce when eating for customized flavor. Quick and easy!

Made it just as written and loved it! It reminded me of the pulled pork at Dixie Kitchen (in Chicago).

Excellent, just as it is with no adjustments.  We used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce with it to make pulled pork sliders.

Brined on Sat. Cooked on Sun. morning at 5:00 a.m. as I was heading out the door to participate in a cycling event. Still asleep? Probably since I screwed this one up by forgetting to add the brown sugar when I cooked the roast!! It was still very delicious and tasty. My husband commented on the "vinegary" taste, so I can't wait to tell him I forgot a key ingredient. In the brine I used 1/2 sparkling apple cider I wanted rid of and 1/2 white vinegar with the water. Prior to cooking I drained more than 1/2 the liquid and added one 12 oz. bottle of beer, which provided plenty of cooking liquid. In addition to the onion I added about 6 small cloves of garlic. Next time I'll drain all the cooking liquid to get rid of any residual salt, since that flavor was very evident to me (could also be because I forgot the brown sugar!). The meat literally fell of the bone. Very easy to shred and remove the fattier bits. The shredded meat went back into the cooker on a warm setting for "serve yourself" convenience. My roast was 2.75 lbs. There is PLENTY of meat left over for us to have lunch all week and then some. Would easily serve 10 people for a party.

I have done this many times now.  I use pork loin.  I do just as directed and it comes out great every time.  I put it on buns.
