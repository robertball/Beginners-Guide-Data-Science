I submitted this recipe and the webmasters changed it. I do not add cream and I make mine much healthier. I just use a T or two of butter or spread and steam my sweet potatoes in the microwave in a bag. I love these potatoes!

These are terrific.  I tossed the potatoes with olive oil and roasted in covered dish.  (Just think it gives a better flavor).  Per another review, I used only 1 Tbs. butter.  You can also cut the fat by using evaporated milk.  Sooo good.  Find the chipotles in the Mexican section of your market.  The leftover chilies can be placed in Ziploc, squeeze out air and put in freezer for another use.  They are great in homemade salsa, too.

I followed the instructions of the original poster and used a T of butter only and did NOT add any cream. This was delicious and SO EASY! If you dont like spice then cut the pepper ingrediants by half or up the amount of  potatos you use. We LOVE spice so we thought it was GREAT! Awesome way to pep up sweet potatoes!

I love these two items and never thought to put them together.  They mesh so well!  I was in a hurry so nuked the sweet potato before mashing and baking but I do like the taste better of potatoes cooked in the oven so will do that next time. Also, I like really spicy food so added extra chipotle.  I almost always have sweet potatoes around and since I froze the remaining chipotles in seperate containers I can whip this up on a whim.  Will definitely add this to the side dish rotation.

We liked these a lot. I followed the submitter's review and left out the cream and only used about 1 T of butter. Next time I think I will reduce the adobos/adobo sauce a bit because it was a tad on the spicy side for us. That's just personal preference, though.

This recipe caught my eye, because it sounded so unusual and I don't like the sweet marshmallow recipes. I was not disappointed; I've made them twice and both times got rave reviews from my guests. This one's a keeper.

Awesome idea for mashed potatoes. I followed the submitter's instructions and steamed my potato in the microwave and skipped the cream. I also skipped the butter, and didn't miss it. Just mashed sweet potatoes and chopped chipotle chilies - and it was DELICIOUS!

Made this to use up some leftover chipotle peppers. Not bad, will defintely make again. Just have to watch the amount of chipotle used if you're not used to spicy food.

absolutely delicious.  This does not need the cream and less butter is good - still rich tasting and creamy texture.

I used Bruce's canned yams for this to make it easier on myself.  I tend to love chipotle pepeprs and have used them in several recipes, but they made this dish too spicy/hot to eat.  I added some honey to cut down on the spice but it didn't have enough of an effect.  I even added more half and half to no avail.  I think one small chipotle and 1 tbsp of sauce would be plenty for this, and we like spicy foods, so if it's too much for us, then others should be careful with those peppers.  I would make it again reducing the peppers and sauce because the underlying flavor is great.

I'm always looking for interesting side dishes and this was tasty.  I've never used the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce before, and the strong liquid smoke smell did turn me off a little.  I used 2 peppers and did not find this to be terribly hot, in fact I thought it could have used 3 peppers.   I will definitely make these again.

I have made these a few times and just made them for Thanksgiving and they were a hit - I only gave them four stars because I think the called-for amount of chipotles and adobo sauce is a bit much but it depends on taste.  I halve it and it's plenty spicy, without overpowering the natural flavor of the sweet potatoes.  I leave everything else as is, half & half etc. and they are terrific.

Fantastic recipe--I taste after each addition of chipotle in adobo as it gets very spicy very quickly--we love spicy, but make sure you taste it to be sure how hot it becomes!  A great sweet/hot side dish--thanks!  I would have never thought to combine these two ingredients I use all the time!

I have never liked sweet potatoes, but I decided to make this for Thanksgiving.  After the first bite, my mouth was on fire, but I LOVE this recipe.  I think I should have only added one pepper for my guests who don't like spicy as much as I do, but I thought the recipe got even hotter and better after a day in the frig - great leftovers!  I will make this often from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A new favorite I will make again! However, I did make a couple of changes: I reduced the butter to 1T and substituted Greek yogurt for the cream (and since Greek yogurt is so much thicker than cream, I added a splash of low-sodium chicken broth).  The tang of the Greek yogurt really complemented the sweetness of the sweet potato and the smoky heat of the chipotles.

I added honey butter, milk and regular county crock butter in addition to the chipotle sauce. It came out delicious! I love sweet and spicy flavors, so this was a hit for me.

I did not add a pepper, but I added more of the adobo sauce and some minced garlic (my kids don't like too much spice).  The potatoes were great!

I love spicy food, but for sweet potatoes, two whole chipotles (one per potato) and two spoonfuls was WAAAAY to hot and overpowered them. Did not like this recipe.

The sweet and the spicy flavors complement each other deliciously!  I love this recipe.  Sometimes I make it just because I crave it.  No cream needed -- like everyone else says.  This is a fantastic TG sidedish too!

I did not like this at all...the chipotle + the sweet potatoes did not go down very well at all.  I gave three stars because it is very original, and maybe it's just my family's taste buds!

This was awesome!  I was looking for something with a bit of spice to go with my teriyaki pork tenderloin.  This was perfect.  It was only 2 servings, not 4.  I used half the peppers called for, but next time I will use the full amount.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is definitely a kepper.
