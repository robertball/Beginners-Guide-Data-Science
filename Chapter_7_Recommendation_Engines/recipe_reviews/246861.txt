My BF has a thing for blueberries and truthfully I don't particularly care for them for anything other than eating fresh.  One day someone mentions the idea of a blueberry bbq sauce and I'm intrigued so after hunting down half a dozen options and trying them all this is one is by far the winner.  The only change I made was using a homemade chipolte blackberry jam.   It's particularly good for bbq'ing chicken over charcoal on the grill.
