This turned out great! I did put in on high for a few hours because it just didn't seem like it was getting thick. But in the end it was excellent. I made this as a last minute Easter dinner with roasted asparagus and a fruit salad for dessert. We just finished the leftovers and they were even better! Highly recommend this recipe.

This tasted very good! As written, the recipe basically makes cheesy ham mashed potatoes. The ham I had was pre sliced so I just chopped it up, next time I want to use cubed ham.  I used a bag of frozen chopped potatoes (cheesy bacon flavor), and they kind of mashed themselves in the slow cooker.  If you don't want the potatoes to be creamy then cook them separately then add to the ham mixture at the end.  This would be a great side dish for Thanksgiving too.

Surprisingly good and easy to make.  Delicious for leftovers. I was surprised to find in the supermarket bags of chopped potatoes with peppers and onions already part of the mix...I was originally confused by the first ingredient thinking I had to add these separately. Neat! For us, 3lbs of ham was too much and it needed to be cubed ahead of time. Next time we will use about 2lbs of ham and will try adding cooked, chopped bacon for a smokey kick.

It came out much soupier than the picture.  I even added a cup of frozen veggies (corn, peas, carrots).  Next time I'm going to add more veggies and a teaspoon of flour to thicken it up.

I used Simply Potatoes Southwestern style and they were really good.  I doubled the recipe and brought to a work potluck and none were leftover. I liked the kick from the potatoes, but next time I think I'd use the regular kind.

This was good.  I only had "normal" potatoes on hand which I cubed and that turned out great.  The one star off is for the directions, I found it very confusing.  For example where do the onions and peppers come from?  And I didn't notice there were two types of cheeses.  Overall it was good, and we will be making it again.

Update:  I use this recipe in regular rotation and it has never let me down!  I leave it on low for over 9 hours and it is still fine.  I throw everything together the night before, put the crock on in the morning and when I get home, dinner is ready.  The ham can be cubed or sliced, it will work either way.  You can use frozen hash browns or plain diced potatoes, but we prefer it with the peppers and onions.  My family requests this often.

My family loved this! it was very easy to make and everyone gobbled it up. I did not get frozen potatoes w/peppers and onions, instead i cut up 1 sm onion and a few potatoes. (the potatoes turned out perfectly cooked!) and in the end i sprinkled real bacon bits on top. will be making again for sure!

This was really good and really simple!  I used regular potatoes instead of frozen and didn't add the onions and peppers (personal preference). I ended up using four whole russet potatoes.  I also used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery soup - again, personal preference.  It was really very good!  Next time, however, I may cube the ham before adding it just to make it easier to serve when finished.

Yum this was so good.  And couldn't be easier to make.  No cutting, slicing, or pre-cooking anything.  What could be better?  My family loved it too.  Didn't change a thing- made it exactly as written.

Completely, amazingly easy. My husband said it was good, took some for lunch the next day, and my incredibly picky son actually ate it.  I cubed turkey ham, which worked well.  The sour cream is definitely a crucial ingredient.  I used frozen Potatoes O'Brien and threw them in the crockpot about half frozen.  They held up and didn't turn to mush, which worked well for us.

Made this tonight. Before I could snap a picture the slow cooker was empty, so on that note it will be made again.

Really easy and really good. Followed the recipe exactly, but used less ham, since it seemed like I had tons of ham after about 1.5lbs. For as easy as it was, this had tons of flavor and was fantastic. Will be making it again.

This was good. My husband thought it was way too cheesy, and I admit I could have used less cheese and liked it more. No other complaints though! Very yummy.

This is a super easy one and everybody loves it.  I change up the soups and cheeses from time to time, just for something different.  My son likes it best with Swiss.

My family loves when i make this. I saw that some other review said their potatoes turned out mashed, i don't thaw my potatoes, i use south western frozen diced potatoes, my husband doesn't like onions, using them frozen makes them turn out just right. I also use mexican blend cheeze for extra flavoring. So easy to make and tastes so delicious!
