Wow, perfect recipe! I made homemade buttermilk with lemon juice and 2%, letting it sit for an hour. Then prepared the dressing (2/3rds portion for the two of us for use several days) with all of the ingredients, using extra fresh crushed garlic, and a little extra cayenne. I used Point Reyes Blue Cheese, which together made a wonderful flavor. Served it about 3 hours later (canâ€™t wait to taste it the next couple days!). We had just gone to Costco so had the Artisan romaine heads, which I quartered, rinsed, and left in the fridge in a stainless steel container for a couple hours. Perfectly crisp! Two quarters per person, with the dressing, freshly fried bacon bits and plenty of cherry tomatoes chilled briefly and halved. This is a superb recipe!

I made this to go along with a roasted turkey breast I made with a Mexican style rub.  I used "real" bacon and omitted the sausage, but kept everything else the same.  I used a balsamic  vinaigrette for the dressing - everyone was impressed and it was even great the next day.
