This scallop dish is pure heaven. I followed Chef John's recipe exactly. You must use fresh tarragon. The sauce was so good I actually licked my plate. The second time I made this, I added a few drops of Bristol Cream sherry to the sauce mix. It gave an unbelievable depth of flavor. We served this with Steamy Microwave Zucchini.  That recipe is on this site. The third time I made it, I put a slice of whole grain Oatnut bread on the bottom of the serving plates, topped it with the zucchini, and poured the baked scallop gratin over the top of each serving. The sauce from the gratin flavors the zucchini and soaks into the bread. This is a wonderful low calorie one-dish meal that is quick to make and everyone loves it.

I do enjoy scallops, but Corey absolutely loves them. When he dug into these scallops, he was definitely happy. I asked him if there was anything about them he didn't like, the answer was NO. When I asked him if it was a 5-star recipe, he said YES. I had to agree with him. I couldn't get fresh tarragon at the grocery store, but since I don't care for tarragon, I wasn't too disappointed and picked up some fresh marjoram instead. I have to say that homemade creme fraiche makes my heart sing, so I loved that part of the recipe. I forgot to pick up a lemon at the grocery store, and today being Good Friday, everything was closed. I went to our local fish and chip store out of desperation and asked if they would sell me a lemon, and they gave me one, no charge! I knew the recipe would have missed the lemon zest. The scallops were delicious, but I thoroughly enjoyed dipping the French bread in the sauce. It was pricey, but it was worth it. What a treat!

This is such a great recipe for scallops and can be tweaked in so many ways.  I followed the basic recipe, and served over cooked fettucini,  along with steamed broccoli drizzled with a garlic butter sauce, then sprinkled finely grated fresh parmigiano reggiano and finely chopped fresh basil over the entire dish.  This is a real treat.  And, my wife said I HAVE TO make this again.

Wow, this is an amazing way to serve scallops!  My husband is normally the seafood chef in our home, but when he tasted these, he said he bowed to me as the scallop chef!  I used vermouth instead of white wine as I usually substitute and we loved the delicate way the scallops cooked, and the divine sauce laced with the flavors of lemon, wine, and tarragon.  This is good enough for a formal dinner party!

This was awesome.  I took recommendation to serve with a zesty micrwave squash and layered it all over oat bread to soak up the juice.  Wife said it was better than going out.  Thanks to all for the recepie and the suggestion.

I could not find crème fraiche the first time I made it, so I substituted mayonnaise. It was still very good. I have since made it with crème fraiche and I'm not sure which is better. It is very important that the scallops are nice and dry, and I am reducing the amount of wine (I use dry vermouth) a bit so the marinade is thicker. I like another poster's idea of placing a slice of baguette in the bottom of the gratin dish to soak up the sauce. I will do that next time.

This is GREAT I made for a special dinner, and all I got was high fives!! The only change I made was sour cream instead of creme fraiche. Do make sure you have LOTS of crispy bread. You will love this EZ recipe!!

I sent my first review off accidentally before I was done. This is my new favorite way to make scallops. I did not have creme fraiche so I used mayonnaise as another reviewer suggested and it was fantastic. Served with steamed asparagus and chunks of rustic Italian bread we bought that morning at the bakery. I can’t wait to make some creme fraiche and try it again.

Delicious, quick and simple! This was my first time making scallops and this recipe was perfect for a first-timer! I watched Chef John’s video where he shared substitutions. I didn’t have the creme frais so he suggested heavy cream. I also didn’t have tarragon and his suggestion of dill worked well. I would like to try again with the original recipe. I served it over angel hair pasta and my picky four year old ate it!!

Taste was delicious but the consistency was too watery.  Next time we'd make a reduction with the white wine and tarragon.

Couldn’t find crime fraiche used whipped crepe cheese and yogurt, no whit wine used crepe sherry.  Cooking time WAY off.  I had large scallops like pictured and with sauce on them it too 10 minutes @450 and 5 more on broil to get them opaque.  No tarragon, used fresh basil.  Yummy!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I did substitute with sour cream and parsley because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will use a little less lemon zest only for personal preference. Thank you again Chef John for another keeper!!!

It was a lovely recipe and very easy to make. I didn’t have the creme fraiche so I had to improvise with sour cream. I’m sure the slightly sweeter flavor of the creme fraiche would have been great but the flavor was great either way.

If I make it again I'll be modifying the spice amounts.  Also I think the recipe is written for a gas oven.  Having an electric one the broil function doesn't quite work the same.  I had to add another 2 minutes.  Everything came out well cooked but I thought it lacked in flavor.  Recipe only called for  a pinch of salt.  Better add a bit more than that!

This is a good recipe, I thought 2 tablespoons of tarragon was a lot, so I did 1 1/2 and would only use 1 next time and more lemon. Used Chardonnay for vino, and make sure you sprinkle the parm evenly as too much in one area dominates the taste. Thank you for sharing.

I used dill weed, parsley, and lemon pepper instead of tarragon, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper. The dish was delicious. We had it with rice and broccoli.

This recipe is excellent just the way it is! The flavors are perfectly balanced and really make the scallops sing. We ate it with crusty bread and spiralized zucchini. So delicious!

There is no option for asking a question, so I am going give it a 5* rating based on its ingredients.  Before I make it, would Chef John suggest an herb to replace the tarragon?

I love scallops and although I did not have creme fraiche, I used mascarpone!  It turned out to be a great substitute in this recipe. A definite make again!  I enjoyed the texture of the scallops after brining them in the cream liquid.  It’s an important step not to skip.  I topped with a little Parmesan on last stage of broil and melt in your mouth delicious was the result!

I made this tonight.  After reading the other comments I decided to use half wine and half sherry.  Due to the consistency it was more like a scampi.  I served it over spaghetti and it was great!  Definitely will be making again.

Turned out great. I used Daisy’s sour cream because I couldn’t find cream fraische. Very tasty anyway.

I just made this recipe by Chef John.  I really love Sea Scallops. I am always looking for something different with Sea Scallops. The recipe is really easy to make. Fun. I gave 4 stars because the sauce was okay, I am looking for a sauce with a deeper flavor. Now, my husband and I enjoyed the recipe. But, I think next time I am going to try maybe 1 tablespoons in each dish of sherry instead. I will omit the white wine. That’s all. Oh and maybe sprinkle a little panco.   I love Chef John’s videos and recipes. We even had the bread, bagettes is what I had. Dipped the bread in sauce. I wish the sauce was thicker. It was too watery for me. But again, this recipe is suppose to be on light side. I totally understand. Anyways, thanks again Chef John. I love your videos, it sure helps. And I love the way you explain about what we could use if we don’t have  crème fraîche. I love the way your layer back and making us feel, it’s okay, type thing. Good Job Chef John!  Merry Christmas!

Meh. I wouldn't make it again.  To be fair I didn't use dry pack scallops. I bought seafood counter sea scallops. I did dry them very well so they were not wet. I made everything else exactly as written. I used my fancy gratin dishes. I lovingly tossed the scallops into the mixture. It looked good. It sounded good. I poured the remainder of the mixture on top of the scallops. I dressed them with some finely (microplane) grated parmesan and poured the rest of the butter on top.  I baked them at 450 degrees. I broiled them for 4 minutes as well. I scooped them onto our plates beside the prime rib for the ultimate surf & turf.   The sauce was runny at best. The flavor was, well, meh. I don't know where I may have gone wrong other than the aforementioned scallops.

This is easy and delicious!  It is very rich and we made it as a main course.  We served it with French Bread for dipping and asparagus.  This is now on our favorite list!

My girlfriend and I I really enjoyed this. I felt like [maybe] the sauce came out a little too thin and the cheese on top mostly dissolved into it instead of melting on top. If I were to make it again I would try to have the sauce thicker or add [most of] the cheese at the end.

Wow!  This was an excellent dish.  Simple to make, simple ingredients and a flavor out of this world. I did substitute half and half for the  the crème fraiche, but it was still excellent! Great recipe!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe.  I will likely make it again when I have access to fresh scallops. Our scallops were of supermarket variety which I believe was the limiting factor for this recipe.

The family enjoyed this.  I made two substitutes: I used sour cream for the Cream Fraiche and I used a small amount of dill instead of tarragon.
