Based on others feedback, I used 1 Cup of regular milk. Then I added 1/2 Cup of frozen peas, used only 1 and 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese, then added lots of black pepper. Lastly, I used crushed saltines for the topping. A wonderful 1950's dining experience!

Deeelicious!!  My boyfriend asked me to make him a tuna noodle casserole like he had when he was a kid.  I decided on this recipe because it seemed basic and traditional. It was not a mistake to go with this. Super easy and very tasty. Got lots of compliments. I just added a little more tuna and some canned peas.  He even asked me for leftovers again tonight, and he never eats leftovers!

Yummy,Yummy this was a great recipe. This is my favorite tuna casserole yet I only changed a couple of things. Instead of leaving the onions raw I sauted them with one stalk of clerey. Since I didn't know what to do with the left over evaporated milk I used the whole can. Instead of American Cheese I used a Edam. It turned out very creamy and moist. Will defenetly make this again and again.

This recipe just saved my life!  Well, maybe that is an exageration but it definately saved me money.  This was tasty!  I halved it and it still made tons..substituted bread crumbs for potato chips and topped it with sliced tomatos.  I also tried low fat, low sodium cream of celery but I think that regular would be the better...oh, and I also tossed in extra spinach, onions, and peas...very excellent!!!!

I don't get all the positive reviews here.  I am not a chef by any stretch of the imagination, but this is bland bland bland.  All the people who seem to love it have changed the recipe.  That's what makes these recipes on this site frustrating.  You see four or five stars and think "Oh, this must be wonderful"...and then you read the reviews and people have turned the recipes into completely different concoctions.  Oh well.  Thanks anyway.

When I made this I doubled the amount of tuna, added more cheese, and added a splash more evaporated milk that what was called for. It turned out very good. I'll definitely make it again in the future.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it! The only thing I did different was to substitute the shredded American cheese for shredded cheddar/mozzerella/taco mix that was left over from tacos the night before. It was only half of what the recipe called for, but I thought it was definately enough. I will make this one again! Very easy to make!

Being tight on money, I looked for an economical yet delicious recipe. This was it! It was so simple, everything was on hand and my family devoured it!  I used cheese slices since I didn't have the shredded and I think it made it even cheesier and more wonderful! Loved the potato chip topping! Definitely a keeper!

This was great!!  It was just a bit dry for for our families taste, so I will probably add more soup next time. The left overs seem very dry but if you just add some milk to it and microwave it. It brings out the creamyness.. Great Tuna Casserole !!

I really wanted to make this less carb-y so I cut back on the pasta a little and added in some chopped red bell pepper, chopped zucchini and some shredded carrot. I did saute the vegetables (including the onion called for in the recipe) in a little butter/evoo before adding it to the casserole ingredients. We don't like american cheese so I used a cup of extra sharp cheddar. I made sure it was extra sharp WHITE cheddar so I could use less of it but still know it's in there--this way it cuts back on some of the fat in this recipe. After mixing up the pasta with all the other "casserole" ingredients, I did add in another half cup of milk as well as some fresh ground pepper. It seemed to need it, I could just kind of tell. The milk I used was fat free evaporated milk, again to cut back on the calories. The potato chips I used on top were sour cream and onion kettle chips. I didn't have much more than a scant half cup of this with a side of vegetables but the kids both had seconds. They didn't even notice the pasta missing or vegetables in it's place. I'll make this again, though I think it needs more tuna. Good base recipe--I really fought with myself wether it needed three or four stars. It's really right in the middle. Three and a half? I know I changed a bit but it was all to make it healthier or less dry.

This was very tasty. I happened to only have cream of mushroom soup with garlic, and the garlic taste just seemed to add to the recipe!  My husband especially liked it, and asked that I make it again sometime soon!

This was a delicious casserole..I lightened it up a bit and made a few changes to it. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would have been quite dry without my changes. I used Ronzoni Smart Taste egg noodles, 1 1/2 cups of skim milk, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, 3 cans of albacore tuna and fat free shredded cheddar cheese. I also used a whole onion and topped it with reduced fat Ritz crackers. Yum! The whole family loved it. Very creamy and cheesy.

This was my first attempt at tuna noodle casserole and it was very good.  It's not something that sounds good to me but my husband requested it so I gave it a shot.  I made some substitutions based on the reviews and what I had on hand.  I used 2 cans of soup and 1 can-ful of fat free milk.  I used about 2 cups of velveeta.  I only cooked my noodles for 6 or 7 minutes because I HATE mushy food.  They came out perfect after 15 minutes in the oven.  I covered half the casserole with potato chips and half with frenches onions.  The onions were the house favorite.  Will definitely make again.

Despite being in my 40's and living in the hot dish capitol of the world (Minnesota), I have never made tuna casserole!  My daughter requested it "just like grandma made."  I've never had hers and chose this recipe based on the comments.  This was wonderful!  I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, an extra can of tuna, and used what I had for cheeses (fat free cheddar and mozzarella).  And since I didn't have any potato chips, I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top.  I'll definitely make this again!

My family deff. enjoyed this dish. We added way more tuna a whole can of evaporated milk. We also didn't have any shredded american on hand so Land O Lakes make a sharp american you can get in the deli I used that and crumbled. And we also didn't have regular chips so we used salt and vinegar.  We sauted the onions and warmed the sauce to melt the cheese befor we mixed in the noodles. It was the best tuna noodle I have ever made deff. a keeper!!

This was pretty good, I think I overcooked my noodles a little bit (if you do that, it will get mushy) --otherwise this would have been perfect :)  So don't over-do the noodles!

This was a very good casserole. I used Bow Ties for the pasta.  I wanted to make sure it was creamy enough so I used the full can of evaporated milk, added an extra half can of mushroom soup and half can of regular milk.  Because of reviewers stating the onions needed to be sauted first, I used French Fried onions instead and put 2/3 cups in with the rest of ingredients, cooked it for 15 min. then put the rest of the remaning onions on top to cook for an additonal 5 minutes more. It was nice and creamy and reheating in the microwave the next day, it remained creamy.  Great recipe!!

A good starting place... I shouldn't really rate the recipe, because I used the tips of others and made something different. I used farfalle (bow tie) pasta, 16 oz. bag, 1 can 2% evaporated milk, 1 box Trader Joe's condensed portabello mushroom soup (very flavorful), 2 c jack cheese, lots of fresh ground pepper, about a cup of mild Maui onion chopped fine, 2 7-oz cans of albacore tuna and about a cup of frozen peas. For the topping I used bread crumbs mixed with butter, salt, and pepper, and reserved a bit of the cheese to mix into it. My version was very good comfort food, neither dry nor runny. I'm always trying to sneak more veggies into my casseroles. Next time I'll try adding chopped asparagus to the pasta water at the end of cooking. Other possibilities are red and green sweet pepper and scallion.

Easy recipe that kids or adults enjoy. I also used regular milk but only 1/4 cup. In a separate pan I heated frozen corn, peas and onions with a TBLS of butter and salted. To the noodles I added Velveeta instead of shredded cheddar, cut into chunks. Mixing 2 cans of tuna instead of one then topping off with 1/4 tsp of onion powder. I mixed everything together but the noodles really good; then added the noodles hot to help melt the cheese. After it had baked at 350 for 20 min covered with tin foil. I topped with casserole cheese from Kroger Then put the crushed chips on top and let it go uncovered until the cheese melted. My kids love it when daddy cooks this comfort food...lol

I do not understand why this recipe has such high ratings.  This is very bland, we did not care for it at all.  You need to vary too far from the original to make it tasty.

Very simple, easy-to-follow recipe.  Great one for adding your own touch.  As is, I think it's a bit bland.  I used two cans of tuna, upgraded the cheese to smoked gouda (tasty and melts beautifully), and used a cup of whole milk instead of the evaporated milk.  Also, I used french fried onions instead of potato chips.

Not a bad tuna casserole. I used yellow cheddar and added frozen peas. My onions were undercooked and a little overpowering. If I make this again I will omit the onion and add a few less noodles.

I feel like I must have done something really wrong - I did put in 16 oz of noodles but then added 1 cup of milk - those were the only changes and it turned out DRY and the onions -RAW. I could try to make this again but I think I will be trying a different recipe.

Great recipe for this classic!  Just like my mom used to make when I was a kid, right down to the chips on top.  Comfort food at its finest.

not my fav.  it's dry, bland and the onions were still crunchy after 20 minutes.   This is one recipe that needs tweaking.  Terrible as leftovers too.    I will not make this again.   bummer.

I thought this was a little dry. Next time I would add more milk. Someone else here suggested adding a little milk to the leftovers before microwaving. Also, I used 2 cans of Bumblebee chunk white tuna. It was awful, not a chunk to be seen but just a lot of flaky bits and very fishy tasting. Next time I will use the good solid white albacore you can get at Costco (Kirkland). Nice big pieces of tuna and not fishy at all. I also reduced the cheese to about a cup and a half. I will definately make this again but just be careful of the brand of tuna. It's worth it to pay a little more.

My 38 year search for the perfect tuna noodle casserole recipe is over. I am the biggest tuna noodle casserole snob, and found this recipe AWESOME.  It's VERY creamy and has great flavor.  I also added peas like other viewers.  Will be making this again over and over.

12oz of noodles is way too much for this recipe.  It was not a creamy tuna casserole.  You can't taste the cheese or tuna and the onions were raw.  I would never make this again.  It was not good.

Super easy - added chopped onion cooked in a bit of butter, extra pepper and garlic powder.  Did add a little more milk so it wouldn't be dry. Covered with bread crumbs then cheese.  Outstanding!

I made several changes to the recipe including: seasoning the soup with a dollop of sour cream, worchestershire sauce, dill weed, salt, pepper, paprika & cayenne pepper.  I sauteed onion, fresh mushrooms & celery in butter prior to adding to soup. I used a combination of cheddar cheese and mexican blend instead of American cheese.  And lastly, I used a topping of bread crumbs, butter and parmesan cheese.  Very rich and filling.

I made a lot of changes.  I didn't have cheese or potato chips, so I left them out.  I substituted with cream of chicken with herbs.  I added 10 ground allspice berries, and ground Hugarian sweet paprika in with the mix, along with some salt and pepper.  The recipe came out spicy and savory, without a heavy tuna flavor.  It was great.  I think the evaporated milk was what made the dish so special.  It probably wouldn't have occured to me to do that.  Will make again. Thanks.

Really tasty and quick. I loved the chopped, uncooked sweet onions! Instead of potato chips, I topped the casserole with uncooked roma tomatos sliced in 3/16" rounds, plus fresh bacon bits.  Next time I may try cream of celery soup instead of mushroom soup, which made the flavor a little intense for some.

I found this recipe to cook up rather dry and bland. Using it as a base, though, I doubled the amount of evaporated milk, added some celery and a can of peas, switched bread crumbs for the potato chips, and it cooked up moist and more flavorful.

Day before grocery shopping.... plus I forgot to take something out of the freezer... so tuna casserole came to mind.  Instead of the same one I always make, I entered tuna and noodles into the recipe finder.  This was good.  I had some Half & Half to use up so used that in place of the Evap milk. For the chips on top I used Sweet Onion Maui Kettle chips.  They added an interesting taste!!

mmm this was yummy! I used whole wheat noodles, an entire can of evaporated milk, and also added a package of mushrooms and an extra 5 oz can of tuna.  Next time I will add another package of mushrooms (one pound total) and double the onion. I sauteed the onion/mushrooms before adding to the casserole.  Next time I will also add another can of tuna (so, 15 ounces total). Carrots might be good in it too. All in all, a keeper!

This was on the dry side even though I added extra milk.  I used Amish noodles, only made 10 ounces and didn't use them all since there was too much.  Added 2 cups of Colby/Jack and frozen peas.  I had French's onions on hand so I topped the casserole with that.  Hubby told me not to make it again.

I have been cooking for many years and consider myself experienced, however, I have never made a tuna casserole because I've always thought anything is better than a boring old tuna casserole! But the hubby loves tuna, and I wanted to do something else with it besides tuna salad. This is easy and delicious, however, the 15-20 min. in the oven was not long enough to cook the onions. I didn't have American cheese but had a shredded white that was "pizza cheese": a combo of mozerella, parmesan, and provolone. I didn't have chips so I used ground pretzels. I will definately make it again, but I jotted down on the recipe to add peas and slivered almonds next time, because those two ingredients would complete this. Thanks Karena!

This recipie was so easy and so flavorful. WOW! I had never attempted Tuna Noodle Casserole before and was amazed at how simple this is. I did take aa couple of readers advice though. I did add frozen peas as well as a whole can of evaporated milk which I believe came to be about one cup. I did not use potato chips. I used a mixture of bread crumbs and panko which I added on top of the cheese topping. A sprinkle of Paprika on top makes it very pretty. Excellent recipie. Thank you!

EZ and good. I made 1/2 the recipe and added a box of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup peas, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and 1Tbsp sherry . I used 6 oz of tuna even for 1/2 the recipe and could have used more. I still feel this recipe needs "something" Parmesan cheese helped after serving. I used a combo of potato chips and panko crumbs for the topping. Omit panko, stick w/ the potato chips...more flavor. I still can't taste the tuna.

Since I wanted to make the Tuna Casserole and the only ingredients I had at home was the can of tuna so I went to the grocery store to get supplies. Instead of half of a cup of evaporated milk I used the whole 5 ounces that I got at the store (it's just a little less than 3/4 of a cup) because I didn't want to waste what I had left. Also I was at Kroger so I got "Casserole" cheese and I got 2 "2 cup" packages but I used all of it anyway. I also used a little extra onion... which I might not do next time, but I chopped it up pretty well, so it wasn't that big of a deal. I might also use a little extra tuna next time since it was pretty cheesy (which I personally like) and so the flavor wasn't all there. It was pretty good dish! Everyone enjoyed it! I will recommend this recipe to others!!

I skipped the American cheese and potato chips.  I did top it off with pecorino cheese and I used a little bread crumbs.  Also, I added a bag of frozen peas.  Not health food, but it was a good way to use up some pantry items and very quick to make.

We liked it.  I used 2 5oz cans of tuna and a whole can of evaporated milk and added peas in with the onion.  We didn't have potato chips so I used bread crumbs.  It was still really good.

After reading a few of the reviews, I made this wonderful, wonderful dish!  I ended up using an 8 ounce package of egg noodles, 2 cans of tuna, 1/4 cup chopped onion and the whole can of 2%evaporated milk ( and the healthy request mushroom soup).  I also put in about a cup and a half of frozen peas and used 2 cups of shredded 2% milk cheddar cheese.  DH and stepson absolutely RAVED about this!  I was even told that this could go into the bi-weekly rotation! Now that's a HUGE compliment!!!!!  Thank you!

I didn't care for this as much as I thought I might. It was good but didn't "Wow" me.   Maybe I just wasn't in the mood.  Probably tuna casserole isn't a "wow" kind of dish. ;) However, my son devoured the entire casserole by himself (minus one serving for me).  All in all it was a hit.

My husband liked this, he said the potato chips on the top were "awesome".  I, however, thought it could use a bit more flavor, maybe more onion and some spices. Over all, it was creamy and good though.

I personally liked it a lot.  My husband didn't, but little did I know that somehow in his entire life he had never had a tuna casserole (how does that even happen!).  It was creamy and had just the right flavor I was expecting.

This is a great recipe that welcomes variations and adaptations.  All by itself it's fairly typical for tuna casserole, but it provides a great framework for experimenting.  I used a bit more liquid ( 3/4c. evaporated milk, 1/3c. water 1/3c. sour cream)and added frozen veggies, doubled the onions and paprika, used sharp cheddar, and buttered the noodles.  The saltines worked out very nicely too.

Very good recipe as is. Second time, doubled the tuna, used sharp cheddar, saltines on top, and substituted 1 cup regular milk for the evaporated.

Great recipe! I did make some motification based on taste and other ideas from reviewers. 
-Saute onion briefly
-Use more evaporated milk
-Salt and Pepper a MUST!!
-Add a can of peas....
I think that's it. Just a GREAT recipe and one for the book....

This came out very dry and it really didn't have much flavor to it. I added more cheese and more evaporated milk but that didn't make a difference at all. I don't think I'll be making this again.

Yum, yum!  No more tuna helper.  This gives a lot more portions and tastes much fuller than the box brand.  I sub'ed three flavor spiral pasta instead of the noodles and it turned out great.

Very tasty and easy.  Used 1/2c salsa instead of 1/3c onion.  Also used colby instead of american cheese.  I will make it again.

My son asks me for this at least once a month. However we like left over so we use two cans of tuna, use barilla plus because if you are going to eat carbs you might as well have more protein, only use a 12oz can of evaporated milk, use the 4 cheese blend Mexican from the Walmart instead of american cheese, add in 1/2 cup of pamersan cheese, use two cans of cream of mushroom soup use crushed Frito's on top instead of potato chips, and his favorite add a can of sliced water chestnuts.

Mighty tasty!  I overestimated my stock of shredded  Velveeta and had to substitute what I lacked with about two cups of shredded meunster,  which I will probably do on purpose next time,  it turned out so good!  I  also used smoked  paprika and a  touch of  cayenne pepper,  both of which added  some warm depth of  flavor.   I  also sauteed my onions before incorporating.  Will definitely make  again!

Good quick, frugal meal.  I added peas to mine.  You don't need that much cheese, especially if you used sharper flavored cheese.  I had a 16 oz package of egg noodles so I just doubled the recipe.  Also, I would give the onions a quick saute before throwing it in.  They came out a bit raw for my liking.

Made this one evening when I didn't have a lot of time, and not only was it easy, but it was also delicious! This was the first time I had used crushed potato chips as a topping, as I had always thought that particular topping would be too salty. It was salty, but not overpoweringly so. Next time I make this dish I may try crushed cornflakes with maybe a bit of garlic and onion powder, along with more of the  paprika. There are several possibilities for toppings, including panko with melted butter or crushed crispy onions.

This reminded me of one of my childhood meals! I made just a few changes b/c this had a ton of noodles! I used 3 cans of albacore white tuna, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 small 5oz. can of evap.milk. 2 cups of shredded mild cheddar cheese. I seasoned with lemon pepper and salt. Topped with crushed saltines and dotted with butter. Then I drizzled another small can of evap. milk over the cracker topping. It was very moist and creamy and the topping was golden and crispy. Delicious :)

This was ok but nothing earthshattering.  I felt it had way too much cheese and definitely not enough tuna.  I'm not sure I'll try again, but if so I'll cut the cheese to 1.5-2 cups and add another can of tuna.  It was a little bland, so I might add peas.

My son made this twice once with canned chicken and the other with canned tuna (we preferred the canned chicken). We added some other cheeses both times, once with cheddar and Velveeta, and the next time we used Fontina, and Cheddar. We also replaced potato chips with french fried onions. This reminded me of the casseroles I ate growing up.

This was a wonderful idea. I never thought tuna could taste good warm/hot. This was an easy dinner to make and my kids ate it including the peas that I added, and my husband (the pickiest eater ever) ate 2 plates. I will recommend this for eveyone....

Great Recipe! It was my first time making tuna casserole and it came out great! My boyfriend is so picky and he loved it! Used 1 cup of regular milk (didn't have evap. milk at home) and wheat thins instead of chips. Very good!

Normally I'm not a fan of tuna fish, however, this casserole was excellent and I went back for seconds.  To suit my own taste, I changed it a little by adding a can of peas, three cloves of garlic, a celery stalk, and I added an extra can of tuna.  I didn't have the eveporated milk, so I filled the soup can up with 2% milk instead.  I really do think the casserole would have been too dry if I hadn't added the extra milk.  The half a cup of potato chips wasn't nearly enough to cover the top, so I added more just to finish the the remainder of the top.  I had a guest for dinner and recieved lots of compliments and had to print another copy of the recipe.  This is easily the best tuna casserole I've ever tasted. Thank you Karena for a great recipe!

This is the best tuna casserole recipe! I took others' advice: sauteed celery and onions in chicken stock, added extra tuna, and used lots of black pepper. My family went crazy over this! My husband hates peas, so I made two versions -- one with peas and one with asparagus, and both were equally popular. My stepdaughter's boyfriend hates tuna, but had a big helping, raving how flavorful it was.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

I love how cheesy this recipe is. I doubled the tuna and evaporated milk and poured in a dash of pickle juice. I also used 1/2 american cheese and 1/2 provolone just because that's what I had on hand. We were out of chips, so I used crumpled up cheezits instead. I can't wait to try this again with the potato chip topping. I think I might add a bit of onion salt and garlic to the mix just to flavor it up a bit more.

5 stars for a quick, easy, cheap, and delicious meal! I added frozen peas, used less cheese, substituted bread crumbs for potato chips (didn't have them) and of course, lots of pepper. YUM!!

If you like the flavors of tuna, mushroom soup, chedder cheese and onion, this is NOT bland!  This is pure comfort food!  Not spicy, not hot, not "gourmet". Just like Mom made.  The only thing I added was a little garlic powder, because Mom did. Wonderful nostalgic recipe!  Thanks!

Good ole' comfort food!  I used a full can of evaporated milk, 2 cans of tuna and a little less cheese.  I also used some mini bowtie pasta instead of the eggs noodles since that's all I had at home.  My hubby even went back for seconds!

Wow!  This is wonderful!  Definitely comfort food for us!  I used the Healthy Request version of the mushroom soup, used the whole 12 oz can of evaporated milk (since it was so thick), used linguine noodles instead of egg noodles, sauteed a small onion and a stick of celery in a tablespoon of butter, then added frozen corn and spinache, and cut the frozen peas down to about 1 cup.  I used Roasted Vegetable Ritz crackers for the topping since I didn't have bread crumbs.  This was soooo good!  My 4-year old daughter was licking the bowl!

Pretty yummy!  I didn't have any chopped onions, so I used a little bit of onion soup powder and it worked out fine.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out pretty good.  It was not too dry at all.  I do think when I make it again (and I will make it again) I will use a different type of cheese.

Very disappointing..was expecting a great casserole from the rave reviews this recipe got, but that wasn't the case.  I added milk as recommended by other reviewers, but it was still very dry.  I covered it in aluminum foil, but the top layer of noodles still got dry and chewy.  I will not make this again.

Very good, quick and easy to make.  I had to double the recipe for my family, and thought that sounded like to much cheese, so I just used 3 cups, and used chedder becuase I don't care for American cheese, and it was perfect.  Very Good!!

I changed it up a bit to add celery, onion, American cheddar cheese and substituted cream of  celery for cream of mushroom  soup.  I think I would cook the celery and onion before combing it because they were a little on the crunchy side.  Otherwise, very good base recipe.

First time making (and eating!) tuna casserole! I followed the recipe nearly to the letter with the exception of using macaroni instead of egg noodles, only a cup and a half of cheddar cheese (because that's all I had) and adding a half cup or so of frozen peas (for added color mostly). It turned out fabulous and will be definitely making again and again! Wonderful too was that my husband loved it as well, and together we ate more than half the pan!! ?????? I wasn't sure I would enjoy warm tuna and that's the reason I've never made or tried a tuna casserole, but I was dead wrong!  I encourage anyone who feels the same, to try this recipe. It's quick, easy and economical.
A triple win in my books!!

No tuna for us...allergic so I used canned chicken.  Also used spiral noodles and garlic mushroom soup.  Fried the onion w celery and brown mushrooms.  Added half and half cream to the soup (about a can full) and warmed the peas in micro.  Topped with rest of cheese and then fried fried onions from Costco.  Delicious!

Agree that this is a good base recipe,  but I add Worcestershire sauce, salt and fresh ground pepper to bring out the flavour. Otherwise, it's way too bland.

After looking at others reviews, I made a couple changes - used minced onions instead of regular onions (my daughter is not a fan of onions).  also used soymilk instead of evaporated milk & added to the cream of mushroom soup & 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  used two cans of tuna to 1/2 bag of noodles.  added curry powder and garlic powder for seasoning.  This was excellent - perfect seasoning, good balance of noodle-soup mixture.  Highly recommend this with these changes.  great base recipe.

This is a really good recipe. It tasted great!  I did add peas and used a pinch of onion soup mix instead of the onion and added a dash of garlic powder.  We loved it.  Although I do not think this was too dry, I like my casseroles more saucey so I will add another can of soup next time.  There will definately be many next times.  Thanks for the recipe!

The BEST Tuna Noodle Casserole! : I changed it a little though:)  Substitute evaporated milk for 3/4 cup whole milk, ommit paprika, substitute potato chips with 3/4 cup french's fried onions.  Also, I began the recipe with sauteed onions in 2 tbspns of "I can't believe its not butter" then added the cr of mush soup, 3/4 cup whole milk and 2 cups of shredded cheese on low heat until evenly melted. then add 2 small cans (or 1 big can) of premium white tuna(chopped) and cooked noodles.  Stir and place in casserole dish and top with a layer of shredded cheddar and french fried onions at 350 degrees for 25 mins. (next time maybe I'll try to also add chopped green onions or even better leeks lightly sauteed...yum my family loved it! enjoy)

This is very similar to the recipe my mother used, but with the addition of cheese.  I was reluctant to try it but it makes it even better!  I used two cans of cream of mushroom, a full can of 1% milk, two cans of tuna, and instead of chips I mixed in some french fried onions and sprinkled some ontop 5 minutes before it was done.  I omitted the onion and added a can of peas and a can of sliced carrots.

This was great!  Others I've made have been dry, but that wasn't a problem at all.  The only thing I did different was used jalapeno queso potato chips, so I omitted the paprika.

This is basically the same way I make it, but I've never used evaporated milk (always use 2%), and I've got to say the evap. milk makes it much better! I used the whole can of milk, and 2 cans of tuna. It's good and easy!

Loved this recipe. True comfort food, made just like when we were kids. Didn't change a thing.

I substituted the evaporated milk with 1% milk, added only 2 cups of cheese, added a clove of garlic, added some garlic powder, and used melted butter mixed with Italian bread crumbs as the topping. I also used one box (16 oz.) of medium shells instead of the egg noodles. I had to use a 3 qt. casserole dish to fit all the noodles. It came out good and my family really liked it, although it could have used more seasoning. I also think I should have put more liquid in it since it seemed a little dry.

My family loves it and I love it because it's quick and easy!  Next time I'm going to add some Parmesan cheese and garlic. I might also try this basic recipe with a pound of ground beef instead of tuna for beef and noodles.

This is relly good with 1/2 pepper cheese. Tuna casseroles are often a little bland, and this gave it a little zip! My husband loved it.

This was great!  My evaporated milk was expired, so I just used 1 cup of whole milk, and it was terrific.  I also used different fun noodles, which always appeal to my little ones!

This was good.  I did break up slices of American (6) and I heated the onions in butter until they were soft.  It really needed salt and pepper but otherwise I would make it again.  If I have cheddar next time I'll use that but the American works if that's what you have.

This reminds me of my mother's Tuna Noodle casserole. I omit the onions and add some cheese to the soup mixture then mix noodle and top with cheese then chips and paprika. Very tastey!

Like other reviewers, I thought this casserole was too dry.  Considering the amount of noodles in the recipe, I think the evaporated milk, soup, and tuna can stand to be doubled.  As the recipe is written, such a large amount of the noodles end up dry because there's not that much liquid.  Also, a 1.5 quart pan wasn't large enough.  I'll be trying this again but will add the whole can of milk as someone suggested, and I may double the soup, tuna, and onion, too.

Excellent and quick!  You have to watch it in the oven to save the chips from burning on top.  I dotted mine with butter, skipped the paprika , added lots of pepper and added frozen peas.

I didn’t follow the recipe exactly just because I didn’t have evaporated milk so I used regular milk but other than that it was the same. I tried this recipe because my husband, first of all is not a big fan of tuna casserole, but because the tuna fish casserole I use to make is dry. This is not dry. It is very good and I like the potato chips on it. It gives it that layer of crunch. Very good. You can easily add peas or what ever left over vegetables you want and I’m sure it would be great. My kids liked it.

I made this but did use the entire can of my little, mixed up cheeses with colby jack, sharp cheddar, and bit of white Americans. Also sautéed onions, celery, and button mushrooms. Seasoned with dill weed and paprika, topped with tomatoes and homemade bacon bits and Italian bread crumbs. Used what I had as so many did, and also recognized it needed more seasoning to counter for strong tuna taste. Overall great base and apologies for rating after changing .

This was wonderful. I only used 2/3 of the noodles and had to add more milk to moisten it. Great flavor that DH said could go on the rotation list.

This had the potential to be delicious but the recipe as written came out a little dry. I would use the entire can of milk next time. Also, if not pressed for time, next time I’d sauté the onions a bit beforehand because they were a little overpowering. Lastly, I’d probably add 2 cans of tuna. I would make it again though!

I changed the process a little. I cooked the tuna with some seasonings added garlic and also the chopped onions so they would be tender. Also instead of using chips I used French onions crushed on top with shredded mozzarella cheese topping and it came out amazing definitely recommend these changes and recipe

I use 2 cans of tuna, shredded sharp cheddar, onion powder because the ones that eat this dish don't like the crunch of onions, and I throw in some garlic powder.  Husband and daughter absolutely love it!

This is a really basic tuna casserole recipe like mom made. You can dress it up any way you like to fit your own memory of the dish.
 I added another 6 oz. can of tuna, and about a cup of milk.  I skipped the chips, and used a Tastefully Simple capful of Onion Onion! seasoning instead of the fresh onion...next time I might go a little lighter on that (like a 1/2 capful). I thought it would be really cheesy, which I did NOT necessarily want, but it WASN'T. Just creamy-pleasant surprise. Served it with peas and flaky biscuits. Quick, easy, tasty, made with staples in my kitchen. A+!

It's a good jumping-off point, but bland without a few tweaks. I added salt and black pepper, frozen peas and whole kernel sweet corn. If I had them, I would also have put in mushrooms and celery. I also doubled the amount of tuna, and in future will probably add more of the cream of mushroom soup and milk- it needs more moisture (possibly bc I added extra quantity with the other things).

this was really good. unfortunately I didn't have milk as one viewer suggested, I used unsweetened almond milk. it turned out great. I'd definitely make again with revisions.

I tripled the onions (I sweated them before I added them) and peas, doubled the  mushrooms and tuna, singled the cheese, mushroom soup &  pasta  and I did not use the milk; my hubby and family of 4 ate ALL of it (save the 2 servings of leftovers I put up for my husband and I for lunch,). I *will*be making this again! oh - and I used shredded mozzarella instead of cheese product, and left out the paprika

I subbed cream of celery for the cream of mushroom.  Fairly pleasant comfort food.  Not exactly what I remember from childhood (too much cheese I think).

A quick and simple main dish. I used leftover rigatoni instead of egg noodles and topped with French's dried onions instead of chips. This is terrific for nights when you've forgotten to thaw something.

I aadded a few spices to it and still found it bland. Perhaps we are not tuna noodle casserole fans.

We loved it, we will definitely make it again. I used a cup and a half of my homemade mushroom soup that I had frozen and saved for a rainy day and it was really good.  My only suggestion for homemade soup users is to add some salt and pepper to taste, to add flavor. Can soup has enough salt for the dish already.

I would do cream of broccoli instead of mushroom soup and peas add a little extra to it (and make it healthier:)

A little dry, but that is better than mushy.  Used red onion and really liked that.

This is just like my mom's recipe.. It doesn't need altering at all. I always season it up with garlic salt and lots pepper. I always put frozen sweet peas in it too.

the casserole is in the oven, and i'm sure it will be yummy, my question is, when was the last time anyone saw a 6 ounce can of tuna! after i emptied the can out there was less than 3 ounces of tuna, the can said 5 ounces, guess they add the can in the weight, put 2 cans in, still not 6 ounces, so added part of another can.  but all in all it looked great and cant wait to taste it
