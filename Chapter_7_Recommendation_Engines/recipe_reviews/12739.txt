My husband and I loved the breading flavor, which is like eating cajun fish and the french fries at the same time.  

The coating is excellent for any skinless, boneless meat:  I have now tried it with fish fillets, chicken thighs, and pork chops.  If you are afraid of frying in butter, try spraying all over the meat with butter flavored Pam, dusting it with coating, spraying again, dusting again, and then one last spray before putting it into a hot oven on a foil lined pan. 

If you are afraid of the spicy heat (or have picky kids), start off with only 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne and add a little more to taste each time.  I like to add a pinch of crushed thyme and dried onion to the mix. 

Thank you Kristi. You made my Ash Wednesday supper a hit.

No one in our family liked this...sorry.  We love fish. We have it every Friday...it's a Green Bay, Wisconsin tradition. Thought we'd try a new way of fixing it and found this recipe. The problem with this 'breading' is that you cannot taste any fish at all.  It's sooo crunchy and it soaks up soooo much shortening that it was just blah, greasy and crunchy.  Not at all what we were looking for.  It began to get very dark on the outside, but after almost triple the recommended cooking time, the fish was still not flaky and cooked through.  Tried a second batch....exact same problem.  Definately won't be using this again.

My family and I love this recipe.  I make the coating exactly as written and it turns out excellent every time.  I do dry off the fish (walleye) after soaking and dip in a beaten egg before dipping it in the coating mixture.  Make sure the oil is very hot for best results.  My three year old asks for this fish every day.

THis was such crispy fish. I used half yellow cornmeal half flour and will do so next time too. Also I think next time i will use mustard powder instead of the pepper. ALSO - the next day I used the leftover mixture to make MEATBALLS for Meatball Grinders with a Yummy Sauce. Wow it was great!!! This stuff makes great meatballs. Just added a couple of eggs and the meat.

This was really good.  I wasn't sure about the potato flakes as a crust, but it was really good.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I just left it out, and honestly, I think it probably would've been better with it in.  I thought it lacked enough flavor, but my husband, who is a very picky eater, really loved this recipe!  He said he'd like it once a week (which is a HUGE compliment for him!).  I cut the fillets into strips to make "fish sticks", covered each strip in potato/flour mix, dipped in beaten egg, and then back in the potato/flour mix.  I wanted a thicker crust and it worked really well.  Thanks for sharing, this is a good recipe!

I really like this recipe! I generally don't like deep frying because my house ends up with that greasy restaurant smell, but this wasn't bad.  To cut down on fat I used canola oil, and I didn't have any potato flakes so I used finely crushed saltines.  The spices were great.  I will definitely use this again when my dh begs for a fish fry.  Thanks!

'OH MY GOODFISH!' This is the BEST! Fish Breading! I just made my Walleye from Burt Lake last week..:) Used this breading recipe and.. even my B/F said this is GOOD! only thing i changed was used my McCormick red & black pepper blend instead of caynne pepper but, i bet it is good with a hotter pepper! I used veg oil in a deep fry pan heated the oil to hot, dried the fillets, dipped them in egg then dredged them in the breading and fried in the hot oil till golden brown and done! AWESOME! thank's Kristi! this is a keeper :)

This is a great recipe.  We love it.  Easy to make and whoda thunk potato buds could add so much?  I added a little bit of Old Bay seasoning too to give it that Chesapeake Bay touch and substituted flounder and orange roughy for the cod.

This fish is really good with some changes. For the first batch I followed the recipe exactly but the coating just didn't stick, so then I dipped it in eggs then in the breading mixture then back in the eggs and back in the breading to give an extra coating. Delicious!

This was excellent!!! We like things spicy so I added alot more spices and I think I'll use 1/2 cornmeal & 1/2 flour next time.  Thank you Kristi!
P.S. I tried the 1/2 cornmeal mixture yesterday and it was even better (the fish stayed crispy even cold).

Was very good and crunchy for oven baked fish.  We were looking for a light fish recipe - didn't want to fry it - and this hit the spot.

This is a great recipe!  My family loves it and always wishes I had made more.  The fish is very tasty and seems to melt right in your mouth.  I usually make the amount of coating called for in the recipe, but instead of dredging in a bag, I put the fish in a bowl with the coating, making sure to pick out any fish peices and fry them.  I then put the extra coating in a freezer bag and freeze it until next time.  There doesn't seem to be any negative effect to this, and I don't think it's unsanitary, as the coating is kept at a very low temperature until I fry the fish.

We go salmon fishing every summer on Lake Michigan, and always have a plethora of fish in our freezer. On Fridays during Lent I try to come up with creative new ways to fix salmon.  I ran across this recipe and gave it a shot even though it recommends white fish.  It turned out great, but I have to confess that I am a double dipper, and I think that is what put it over the top. After dredging and coating a first time, right before I put it in the pan I dredge and coat again.  I will be making this recipe again!!!

The whole family enjoyed this recipe and my husband said it was the best way to use instant mashed potatoes that he had ever heard. I followed the recipe to the letter but i will cut the cayenne in half next time, just as a personal preference.  I will DEFINATELY make this again

Really loved this one. Used on Haddock filets. Crunchy, nice seasoning, full flavor. I've never fried fish before but that's what the family wanted. Will definitely make this again. Only thing I did differently was use a beaten egg prior to dredging in the dry ingredients (versus soaking in cold water.) Yum!

This is a GREAT fish coating! It's not your regular run of the mill bland same old same old! My kids are 3,4 and 6 and they LOVE it! They eat 1 to 2 fillets each! Using tilapia is the only change i make because it is alot less expensive. TRY THIS RECIPE!!!

Loved this!  I also dipped my cod in egg before the coating.  Beautiful and so yummy!  Next time I will add more cayenne pepper for a little more kick.  I have saved the rest of the coating to use at a later time for something else. We had homemade fries and coleslaw with our cod and it was a restauraunt quality meal for sure.  Reminded us of food from San Fransisco's Fisherman's wharf vendors.

I did not have enough potato flakes so i used 1 1/2 cups of potato flakes and 1 1/2 cups flour. i also used salmon and then deep friend it. this was very crispy and delicious. oh and i also addded 1/2 cup italian style bread crumbs. This is a very good recipe, the only thing i would highly reccomend is not soaking the fish in water. dry it really well and then dip in an egg and milk mixture then coat with dry mix.

Yummmmmy. Thank to all for the great suggestions. I dredged in potoato/flour dry mixture, then the egg, then the dry mixture again before frying. I also cut the fish in about 1" strips, which helped the crispiness and made it nice for dipping in tartar sauce. Didn't have shortening, so used canola oil. We loved it.!

This was my first time to fry fish and I think it turned out pretty well.  Just make sure that the oil is hot enough or the breading will not stay on the fish. I made the mistake of turning down the heat b/c I thought it was too hot, but it wasn't.  Overall, it was really good.

Made just a little different. Used three pie plates for my work station.Put together about 2 c. Panko Bread Crumbs to 1 c.Corn Flake Crumbs, with about 1 tsp. of salt and 1 1/2 tsp.of Old Bay in one pie pan, then in another pie pan I added about 1 c. of flour with 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp of Old Bay The last an egg mixed with water beaten. Put your piece of fish in egg mixture, then in flour, then back in egg, then in Panko,bread crumbs. Fry on high heat, fry till it's the color you like, [flipping over to each side]drain on paper towel lined cookie sheet. Put in 200* oven to keep warm till your all done frying.

I left out cayenne(kids), used canola oil, made 1/2 batch breading, it was plenty. Very good, easy, 
also great as onion chips. Definate keeper.

We really liked the crispiness of this and it had good flavor.  I didn't find that it held any more oil than any other coating (used canola). I had exactly 1# of cod - 4 fillets - but only needed 1/2 the amount of coating mixed. No problem - I froze the rest for next time. Thanks for posting!

I'm from Singapore and I tried cooking this recipe for my family and everyone loved it!
There were some problem looking for the ingredients in Singapore, for example, potato flakes and what is cayenne pepper? We used the packaged bread crumbs instead, and everything turned out great! Didn't add cayenne pepper.

Thanks Kristi

I had some fresh sea bass but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it and this recipe was delicious. I made a couple of changes though, I didn't have potato flakes so I just used flour. (I want to try this again with the flakes though.) Also, I whisked an egg in a bowl and dipped the fish in that then sprinkled the seasoning's right onto the fish then dredged in the flour and fried in butter. My fish had skin on so I only dredged and seasoned one side and cooked skin side first. The skin crisped up so the fish easily came away. I served it with new potatoes cooked with butter, salt and pepper then a sprinkled some freshly grated parmesan cheese on top and had green beans with chopped sweet pepper. I would definitely make this again!

WOW!! I didn't know that homemade fish sticks could be so crispy! I made the dipping mix, only adjusting the spices to reflect what I have on hand.  Fantastic.  Will definitely make again.  We used some halibut up that was getting too old to taste good grilled. The kids all liked it except my 2 year old.  That may have been due to other factors though!  You sometimes can't tell with that age.  Anyway, I loved them!

I found myself out of my regular fish fry so I immediately pulled up this site and found this seemingly easy and well received recipe.  I followed these directions exactly.  I found the fish greasy and the coating tasteless.  Perhaps we are just more accustomed to spicy, crisp and  DRY fish. I, personally, think the biggest problem with this fish is that the coating makes the fish absorb too much of the grease, making the fish itself "wet" and gummy instead of the flaky and moist texture you would want.   I used Talapia, the easiest fish in the world.  Our normal fish coating is dry Louisiana Fish Fry.      Don't hesitate to try this because of my review.. I'm sure I must have done something wrong being that so many others raved about it.  This is just one person's opinion:)

Hard to rate this one. I am sensitive to wheat and left out the flour (as suggested) and the only instant potatoes I had on hand were more granular than flaky, which is probably why the breading didn't stick to the fish while frying. I ended up with a pile of bland, crispy potato bits and even blander fish. Will try again with flakier dry potatoes. If it's a significant improvement I'll change my rating.

3 = liked it  I didn't love this, but that's OK cause I shouldn't be eating fried food anyway right?  My fish didn't look like the picture at all. I didn't have that much coating nor was it as nicely colored.  I will not try this again, but I liked it :)

Great recipe! Did change it a bit, used one cup dry potato flakes, one cup Panko and one cup flour.  Reduced the spices, but next time I'll use the full amount. Fried in Canola oil.  Breading nice and crispy.

Very tasty and crispy. I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup cornmeal as other reviewers suggested. I also added an egg in the milk dip to help the mixture stick to the fish better. Great recipe.

Definitely a keeper!  No leftovers like usual.  My son actually went back for seconds which never happens with fish.  I've tried it with both haddock and salmon fillets ans they both rocked!  The spicy "kick" made the fish.

We've searched for a crispy fish recipe for close to a year now.  I've made them all - and not been pleased w/ any - UNTIL THIS!!! I made a mistake and added 1c bread crumbs instead of the flour.  We loved it so much, I doubt I'll make the change.  I did add the garlic powder to the potato flake mixture - but to the fish, I sprinkled paprika, cayenne pepper, sea salt and onion powder on both sides. I also lightly whipped 3 egg whites to coat the fish before dipping it in the dry ingred.  We fryed the fish in peanut oil heated to approx. 375 degrees.  The fish fillets were done in approx. 2 minutes - and were not oily.
This recipe is a home run!!!!!!

I've always got potato flakes on hand (for thickening soups/stews/etc.) and never thought of it as a coating! VERY nice change of pace from seasoned bread crumbs and much crispier! Have made this several times now... will try with 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornmeal as one reviewer suggested on the next go 'round. Thanks! (I'm going to 'borrow' this coating for some b/s chicken, too!)

This is an excellent recipe. I usually use fish fry and it always turns out well, but I had to try this one. The outside is SO crispy, and the inside stays moist because you don't have to overcook to get a crisp outside. Thanks for a new favorite!

Made this as written with the exception of only putting in a sprinkle of chili powder due to serving to a 1 and 2 year old. It was great but needed some additional flavor. Next time will make with full amount to see if that helps. :)

Wow -- this was great.  I am not inclined to fry foods often but I am glad I did with this one.  I used fresh ocean perch filets, they were light, crispy and delicious.  homemade tartar sauce was the icing on the cake and my husband and daughter GOBBLED this up.  I was thinking we would have a lot of leftovers -- not at all.  And, I used brown rice flour in addition to the potato flakes to keep it gluten free.  Thanks for the great recipe -- I will be making again.

This is the BEST fish breading recipe I have ever made!!! So easy that I know it by heart!!  I now keep a container of it on hand all the time.  Sometimes I'll throw in a little panko for extra crunchiness.

This is a favorite recipe exactly as written, but now that it's in my rotation, I use garlic potato flakes which I now keep on hand just for this recipe, 1/2 C of the flour and as a long-time Marylander, I should move out of this beautiful state if I didn't substitute Old Bay for the cayenne.  Very, very good recipe.

Definitely a keeper!! Hubby likes a crunchy batter and I prefer a smooth batter, but I gave this a try. I was pleasantly suprised at how this turned out. I used the exact ingredients (no variations) and deep fried in oil. It wasn't too spicy either. It was actually perfect. We are definitely making this again!!!

Great recipe! I used regular salt instead of season salt, as I was out of it. I also just fried the fish in vegetable oil. It came out great tasting and crunchy, how we like it!

I thought this recipe was good, but still lacked just a bit of flavor. Maybe adding lemon pepper instead of ground black pepper, as well as sprinkling a bit of lemon juice on the fish would help. I thought the amount of spice was great, but adding some citrus would be perfect.

Very Good tho I did cut potato flakes and flour in 1/2.I used low sodium seasoned salt,also I used Crisco Vegetable oil for frying,healthier choice than shortening. Drained well in paper toweling twice. SUPERB.Thank you.

My hubby takes over in the kitchen whenever we have fish for dinner.  He found this recipe and made a few changes.  He sub'd steak spice for the cayenne pepper, we only had regular shortening in the house and he preferred to dip the fish in egg before putting into the potato coating.  Doing it this way gave the coating a more golden look.  This was a very tasty way to do the fish and my kids inhaled all of it.   Thank you for this recipe!

We loved this recipe.  It was perfectly seasoned and the coating stuck to the fish perfectly.  I always have problems with the coating flaking off during frying, but this came out great.  The texture of this was wonderful-it truely is "crispy" fish.  The only change I made was frying in canola oil instead of crisco.

I was looking for a fried fish recipe that didn't use eggs and came across this one.  I cut down a little on the pepper, substituted cornmeal for about 1/3 of the flour, and fried the fish in canola oil.  It turned out crunchy and yummy!  I did have a lot of "breading" left over, so next time I'll make half the amount so it doesn't get wasted.  Thanks for the good recipe!

I tried it with the cornmeal instead of following as written.  I didn't like the cornmeal crunch.  That said, I think the potato flakes alone were bland.  I could taste dry potato flakes over the fish a few times and wished I'd added more seasoning.  It IS a great base!  Will try again!

My 9 year old loved this. I did not have the cayenne pepper and had intended to leave out anyway due to the kids but my husband felt that it needed more flavor. So, next time I make it, I will put some in. I took another person's advice and cut the coating ingredients in half. It made more than enough to dip the fish in.

This is wonderful, best fish breading that I've ever had very crispy just as the recipe states.  I always have to have tar-tar sauce with my fish but not with this recipe.  I will add a little more seasonings next time though.  I'm going to try it on chicken too.  Thanks, wonderful recipe who knew potato flakes make such a crispy coating???

This was the first time that I had EVER fried fish, and I was really nervous.  I am a vegetarian, but not averse to cooking for my husband.  Not only was this easy, but he raved on and on about the fish.  This is a definite keeper!  I did change a few things, however.  I threw in about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and omitted the cayenne pepper.  I used about 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning instead.  My husband said that it was the most flavorful fish that he's ever eaten!  Thanks!

This was excellent!!! We left out the cayenne pepper (for the kids' sake) and it still had great flavor.  I had just pulled a package of frozen fish from the freezer and put it in the cold water while I was mixing the dry ingredients... it was thawed and ready to cook by the time the oil was at the correct temperature.  We will use this one many times!!! Thanks :)

I made this recipe with fresh walleye and it was awesome!  We didn't fry the first batch long enough so it wasn't real crispy.  We fried the second batch a little longer and it was crispy and had great flavor.  It took no time to prepare and was even good the next day.

I didn't add the 5TB black pepper called for, believing it to be excessive  for something to be fed to children. The potato flakes added an interesting new texture that was quite good.

Crunchy! Crunchy! Crunchy! so, i changed this a bit, due to gluten issues and my husband hates spicy things. Instead of cayenne, i used oregano (1 tbs) and powdered garlic (1 tbs). Instead of the flour, i used fine corn meal (masa). it was quite wonderful.

I had never fried fish before trying this recipe.  It was super easy, and delicious!  I used canola oil for the frying and it turned out crispy and beautiful.  Great recipe!  I won't use it often because I don't like to eat too much fried food, but when we're hungry for 'fish n chips' this will be the go-to recipe!

Being vegetarian, we used a vegetarian "fish" just to see how it would come out.  Like another reviewer we used canola oil instead of shortening and crushed saltine crackers instead of potato flakes.  Wow!  Surprisingly good results.  Thank you Kristi!

This was a great new recipe.  It really did make it crunchier than my other recipes.  I didn't have the problems others mentioned about the breading staying on, use cold water, shook off and then padded down with breading.  I used my deep fryer and didn't over fill w/fish(maybe that helped).  While adding all the seasonings I thought that it called for too much cayenne after seeing all the pepper it called for, so I only used 1/2 the cayenne, it could have used the full amount. My daughter said it was the best fried fish I'd ever made.  That's saying a lot, I make fish a lot.  So you know, I'll be using this again.  Make it just as it calls for.

I am really impressed! It is extremely easy. I used walleye and pike boneless fillets. I fried it in peanut oil and added some oregano, basil, celery salt, onion powder and nutritional yeast for some extra flavour.

Excellent.  I never cook fish, but this recipe sounded so good I had to try it.  My husband couldn't stop telling how great it was.  I just wonder if you can broil it instead of frying it for health reasons.

I made this for dinner tonight with Swai fillets (very inexpensive and extremely mild)...absolutely awesome. My 9 and 5 year old children both scarfed it up. I just used regular oil in my fryer.

Made this last night and it was fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly but only added 1 tsp cayenne. It was not too spicy and I think next time I will add the 2 tsp called for.  I had enough of the coating left over for another batch.  My family raved about this!

EWe just had this cripsy fish. I used almond flour instead of AP flour. Also added a little cayenne to flour. After cooking fish I cooked shrimp covered with same mixture . The other ingredient I changed since I didn't have potato flakes was panko crumbs. Very good. Will make again.

This turned out fabulously.  Better than eating at a restaurant for sure.  The only things I changed were that I used Panko bread crumbs in place of potato flakes (didn't have them) and used regular vegetable oil to fry.  I plan to try Grapeseed oil another time.  Also left out cayenne since we are spice wimps.

I used this recipe for haddock, and substituted 1/2 cup corn starch - instead of flour- tasted great! Will make this recipe again- but I shouldn't have flipped the fish because it fell apart- the shortening is deep enough to not flip.

I'm sure this would be amazing deep fried but I went for a pan-fried version. My only complaint is it is WAY too spicy--and I LOVE my food hot. I will cut the spice in half next time but will def. make this again. Lots of flavor, delicious, just too much cayenne.

Very good.  I needed a batter that didnt have beer in it because we dont have any beer on hand so I tried this recipe.  I did just as the recipe states only I substituted 1/2 of the shortening for canola oil just because thats what I had on hand.  It came out nice, crisp and tasty.  For those that have a problem with getting their fish crispy be sure that your oil is hot before you add your meat whenever you fry something.  Otherwise your breading will absorb the oil and not crisp up.

This recipe is fantastic! I made the recipe exactly as called for except for using regular crisco instead of butter crisco. This is so much better than any fried fish I have ever had!  I will this recipe over and over!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Fantastic! The only variation I use was to dry the fish after water soak and dip in beaten eggs before coating the Flounder. Pan fried until golden brown turning once. The butter flavored shorening, used for frying, adds a nice flavor. Great recipe! I'll be using this for all of my fish dinners unless something better comes along.

This was VERY YUMMY! I used fresh Largemouth Bass (I live on the coast and have an endless supply of freshwater and saltwater fish). The only change I made was that I used milk instead of water to moisten the fish filet.

This recipe is great. My daughter has an egg allergy, so this a quick, easy and tasty way for her to have fish. Both my fussy kids loved it. I blanded it down a bit, and added some chicken stock to the batter for flavor.

This breading is wonderful! My whole family loved the fish prepared this way. I fried the fish in a sautee pan with a little bit of canola oil instead of deep frying it.  Just turn when golden brown.  Very good flavor and crispy.  Really brought out the taste of the fish.  I also used butter and herb instant potato flakes since I was out of the plain.  Very good!

Doctored up the seasonings a bit but LOVE the use of the potato flakes!  Boyfriend usually doesn't care for fried foods but he LOVED this!  Served fried cod with "Rachel's Wasabi Cocktail Sauce" made hecka hot as preferred.  Will add this one to the roattion for sure!  Thanks!

This was quick and easy.  We liked how crispy the coating was but we found it way too salty.  You can really taste the seasoning salt as well as the cayenne. If I make this again, I would cut back on the seasoning salt and probably leave out the cayenne all together.

I have tried many fish recipes and they never turn out. For once I found one that did. My husband and I both loved it. The outside was crunchy and the inside was so moist. This will be the only way I will prepare fish for now on. Thank you for sharing this great recipe with us.

Maybe I did something wrong but this wasn't that great.  A little blah I thought.  I'll try it again and add a little "something"

Wow! I thought this was great. I hadn't ever fried anything before, nor had I ever cooked fish, and it was STILL great! Very flavorful, I thought it was better without tartar sauce. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the high fat and sodium content-- one reason I don't fry foods very often. I will definitely try this again and follow the suggestions of other reviewers for baking instead of frying. Thanks for the great fish recipe!

Tasty fish!  Nice and spicy.  Rather than use shortening for the frying, I went ahead and just sprayed my pan with some olive oil.  It was a little harder to cook, and flaked more, but it cut alot of the fat out.

Killer recipe!!  It was SOOOOOO good!!  Very crispy, wonderful texture and tasted GREAT!  Spice it up with more cayenne and black pepper if you wish.  Also good baked, for a lighter version, just spray pan with cooking spray, spray coated fish with spray butter and bake for a few minutes then broil to brown. mmmm mmmm good :o)

This created a light crispy crust which didn't smother the flavor of the fish.  Great!!  The recipe makes enough coating for 8-10 fillets.  I bagged up the leftover coating and will use it again next time.  And there will certainly be a next time.  Thanks.

I had no meat thawed for dinner but I found some wild caught Alaskan Pollock fillets I bought a frozen bag of on some great sale. :) I just couldn't follow the recipe. I didn't have the ingredients. I did have flour and but no potato flakes. I try to keep some around but must have used them up. I found some Panko and used that instead. I also had Old Bay seasoning so subbed 1 Tbls of that and about a tsp of granulated garlic, because I love garlic. I decided to use an egg and a bit of milk to help the coating stick better. I dried the fish thoroughly by patting with paper towel. Dredged it in the flour mix, dipped in egg mix and then again in the flour coating very well, pressing it in. I cooked it in my deep fryer and they came out so pretty and even better they were delicious. I will never eat fish and chips again without comparing it to this.

I made this for the very first time. And I used coconut flour and regular flour. I did not have the type of flower that was in the recipe. And I fried it in my cast iron skillet. I think it came out pretty good! Thank you!

We liked this recipe. I did however have to make substitutions; I used regular crisco and added 2 tablespoons butter as I did not have butter crisco and I used Italian bread crumbs.

This recipe was really quick to make. Made as written except I used margarine to cook instead of the butter flavored shortening because I didn't have any. Tasted really good. I will make this again!

This was so easy to get a nice golden brown, crisp, fish (Pollock).  Make sure the oil is hot enough before you start to fry.  The flakes added so much to the end result.  For years I'd been using store bought fish coatings.  I've seen a lot of variations to the recipe in the reviews and may try those myself.  I guess I will keep the leftover mix for meatballs or salmon patties.  I'll be making this again on fish night or sooner.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I altered the recipe by doubling the amount of garlic powder. It would have been bland otherwise. But if you double the garlic, it's a 5 star recipe. Best catfish I've ever eaten, cooked perfectly, and SO EASY!

Used this recipe with some halibut I had caught in Alaska, as well as with some perch caught locally.  We thought the halibut was best, but we had allowed the halibut to marinate in butter for a day in the refrigerator.  Both fish were very good.  I did add some things, as I didn´t have potato flakes.  I used 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup  butter cracker crumbs, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp seasoning salt, 1 tsp Santa Maria spice, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp pepper.  Cooked in coconut oil at 325 degrees.  Excellent!

The fish is delicious and love the breading mixture; however, I find dipping the fish in egg first instead of water was better for coating the fish.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer that said they added a little onion powder and thyme. I also dried the fish well and dipped in egg then the flake mixture and back in egg and back in the flakes. I used oil instead of shortening. Came out great! Will definitely use this recipe again! @alyssasfoodpics

The chips turned out great. The first batch of fish did too. Next time I'll use two pans for the fish, because the 2nd batch turned out less crispy and didn't hold together as well after cooking in the same as the first.

Worked out great! We may three changes:
1. My wife can't have gluten, so we used coconut flour
2. My daughters won't go for anything spicy, so I left out the red pepper (but the black pepper was fine)
3. I didn't want to use the amount of oil it would take to deep fry it, so I covered the bottom of some glass baking dishes with oil a few millimeters thick and baked the fish on that, turning it over half way through

None of these changes caused any harm, and even my son, who doesn't like fish, really liked this recipe. Thanks!

I have finally gotten around to reviewing this recipe. I make it about once a week. So easy and so delicious. You can use it for any kind of fish. Since potato flakes are part of the recipe I usually make instant mashed potatoes on the side with corn. Everybody loves this, and I am sure it would be a great way to get little ones to eat fish!

Very crispyis texture. Delicious taste. This is my new recipe for fish taco coating(I used to use a beer batter but it gets soggy). This recipe holds the crispiness even after it has cooled. When you are making a lot of fish, and dont want to eat in shifts, this is the recipe

my husband made this for dinner tonight.  We both loved it.  The breading is great.  The only problem was we did not cook enough.  Could have eaten more.  A definite make again.

It was just okay. The problem was when dredging the fish in dry mix it only picked up the flour and nearly none of the flakes. My fish using Panko bread crumbs was better due to this failing. Seasoning was very good however and will use this without the flour I think.

Delicious!  My husband is so picky about fish, and he loves this recipe.  It's especially good if you dip the fish in egg then the batter and then egg and batter a second time.

I thought I had followed the recipe exactly after reducing it by half, because it is just hubby and I.  I ended up with way too much batter and it did not stick to the fish as I had expected.  I will try this again because it was tasty and will update if I have better luck next time.

We usually use a store bought batter called shores for making my fish but I did not have any left and did not want to run to the store so I found this recipe and I really liked it about as much as I liked Shores.  My husband said he liked it too but liked Shores better but what does he know :)~  It was delicious and I will continue to make it for our fish.

Delicious recipe.  Not the authentic English fried fish, but a nice change.  I would half the dry ingredients as there was way more than necessary for coating the fillets.

This was a good recipe, but not great.  Followed recipe to the letter (that's the only way to give a fair rating).  Loved the breading crispiness, but it needed a little more flavor.  The cayenne seemed a little "much" for us. I know that sounds like a contradiction, but I guess the seasonings just weren't right for us.  I do recommend everyone try this recipe, however.

Outstanding!  Easy to prepare and my family loved it.  There wasn't a piece of fish leftover.  I used fresh crappie.  Thank you!

Excellent!  My husband brought home fresh sea bass, so I quickly searched for a winning way to prepare it.  The whole family loved this one!  Will definately make it again, and soon.  Crispy, tender, moist and flavorful. Thank you for sharing, Kristi!

By far the best fish and chips I've ever made.  I've made this a few times.  It's easy and delicious!

This is SO easy.  The quickest most delicious meal ever - I dont even LIKE fish!!!  I will add a little more Cajun seasoning next time, also Cheddar mashed potato flakes maybe.  I had halved the recipe, and even bagged half of that (as per previous recommendation) for more fish fry for next time!!!!!

This is a terrific coating. Very light and crisp. I used fresh Halibut and fresh Alaskan Salmon. Wonderful!

This was great. My husband is very picky about his fish, and he loved this.  I will definitely make this again and again.

GOOD recipe.  The review of 3-30-00 by ddwmitch puzzles me.  The recipe, as I read it, says 1 Tbs of black pepper.

This was wonderful!  I had guests over when I fixed it, and they wouldn't leave until I gave them the recipe!  Definitely a keeper!
