I did not boil the seeds.  I just rinsed them, let them air dry for about 20 min. then mixed them with the butter, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, ground cloves and nutmeg (didn't use cardamom) and baked.  My boys LOVED them!!!!

The boiling is unnecessary.  Just rinse and dry.  Seasoning is wonderful!  Don't skip the cardamom as it adds great interest.  I added pinch a salt and reduced to 1/2 tbsp sugar.  The kids and I ate them all in an hour!

Did not use cardamom.  Did not cook as I already brined it over night in salt water.  Tried 250F but after 90minutes they were still a bit chewy.  I then tried 300F and that worked best.  Note: I made 5x the recipe which may have altered the cook time/temp.

I was looking for a sweet pumpkin seed recipe. This one turned out pretty good. I could mostly only taste the cinnamon and sugar, so I was a little disappointed that the seeds didn't taste like pumpkin pie but they were still good. I probably just needed to adjust the spices and would try this again.

This is good, but I am told regular pumpkin seeds with salt and old bay seasoning is better.  I did change my personal pumpkin seed recipe to boil the seeds first, let them dry, then put them in melted butter and seasoning to help it stick.
