Although the recipe says a package of puff pastry dough, the recipe made it sound like only one sheet was needed.  I did struggle a bit getting the pastry into the proper size, ended up with way too much filling, at which point I realized I should have used both sheets.  The filling was tasty, and if you are good with pastry - would make a nice appetizer, although I though they lost a lot once they cooled to room temperature.  Much better when hot.  It reminds me of one of my favorite recipes, which used the very thin sliced pepperidge farm bread cut into circles and fit into buttered muffin tins.  You can bake the bread until golden and remove from the cupcake tins, you have little tart shells, then, and you could use this recipe as a filling.  I think I would try that next time since I struggled with the pastry dough.

I made quite a few changes with this based on what I had in my kitchen.  I used onion instead of shallots, oregano instead of thyme, and butter and milk instead of heavy cream.  Still, it turned out great and my boyfriend and I both loved them!  I'd like to try it with regular pastry, since I had a problem keeping the puff pastry closed, but the puff pastry is SOOO tasty!

These were fantastic. I didn't measure anything though. I used some dehydrated wild mushrooms that i had, and i have no idea how much they weighed. The dehydrated mushrooms worked surprisingly well, I rehydrated them in skim milk, then in warm water, then dried them and fried them a little in the onion and garlic and oil. I also only used one sheet of puff pastry since I was only cooking for the two of us. I was too lazy to convert the measurements so i just put everything together. I didnt have any shallots so I used onion. I probably used more cream since I like things saucy. I had a lot of extra mushrooms and sauce so I kept it warm and put a little on top of the pastry when it was time to eat. My husband really liked these and even went back and ate some cold ones later. It is a very classy side for a beef or chicken dish. I will definitely be making these again.

The pastry is a bit tricky to work with, but if you roll it thin enough, and don't stuff them too much, it works quite well. I used dried thyme, and it tasted great - to liven the recipe up, though, I added a large splash of balsamic vinegar into the mushroom mix while looking them. It gave the recipe that extra touch. SO delicious!

this was excellent...I couldn't get the puff pastry to turn over and seal( put a bit too much shrooms in the middle)so I just boated it up around the shrooms and it puffed right up like a tart, I added a bit of stilton to the top and namnam!

I am going to try this again. I did not have access to Wild Mushrooms and used Button and Baby Portabella's instead.  It was very very watery.  I also had difficulty cutting the pastry into the correct sizes.  Actually ended up making them more like ravioli with a top and a bottom.  It was very tasty and I will try this again.    I think this may take some practice. Loved the puff pastry.

Very tasty, but next time I will chop the mushrooms finer so I can cram more in! I tasted more pastry than mushroom. Which isn't always a bad thing!

Rather than do the pockets, I used a mini muffin pan. Left each serving uncovered so I would have enough dough for 24 mini bites. Also left out the heavy cream in an attempt to cut calories and had no shallots. Tastes just as good with the garlic, mushrooms, thyme and cheese alone. Soooooo yummy! Thanks :)

Loved this! Changes I made, I used fresh oregano instead of the thyme (due to availability), and I measured out bigger squares. I did use butter on the puff pastry to help it brown. Husband asked for seconds, and my 3 yr old loved to eat the filling before it went into the pastry but not after (not sure why). Overall it'll be a recipe I keep and use often, with variations, of course.

good taste if you like mushrooms...my puff pastry didn't come out right.  spreading butter between sheets will give you a nice golden brown and make it tastier.

The mushroom mixture was very good. I didn't have fresh thyme so I substituted ground thyme and it added a wonderful flavor. I didn't make triangles out of the pastry. I rolled out both puff pastry sheets and cut into 12 equal sized rectangles. I spooned the mixture onto one rectangle and topped with another rectangle. Took a fork and crimped edges. Brushed with egg wash and sprinkled fresh Parmesan cheese. Baked 20 minutes and it was super yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Susan!!

These are fabulous but I recommend a few notes here.  If you don’t read this entire review, scroll down to the ** most important tip. 
Purchased already sliced baby Bellas and they were way too thick, even after cooking down. I ended up using a food processor so the filling consistency would be smoother inside the puff pastry. Don’t over process, avoid mush consistency, but the flavors blend nicely with a finer chop. I chose 1/2 baby Bella, half cremini to save some cost. 
Substituted 1/2 c sour cream for a creamier texture, and a tangier flavor.
Puff pastry is the right dough- I used a fork to TRY to seal the sides but next time I’ll maybe use melted butter with the fork tine press to keep the pockets from bursting open during the bake. 
****if you only change one thing ... put an egg white wash on top of the pastry. Improves the presentation to be light, toasted brown and shiny. This is an absolute must! The first batch wasn’t pretty.. 2nd batch with the egg white brush was gorgeous. 
Even though many turnovers were split open and a little scary looking, these were gobbled up by my neighbors and there were many lovely appetizers competing for attention. 
Truly delish and this was the closest recipe to what my mom used to serve in the 70s. This turns out to be a timelessly appetizing appetizer.

Normally, the first time I make a recipe I do it exactly as it says. Then from there I’ll tweak it if I have to. This time, unfortunately, I didn’t have some of the stuff so I changed it just a bit. I only had two packs of exotic dried mushrooms which ended up being 8 ounces when rehydrated. To that I added 8 ounces of  regular white mushrooms.  I find  roasted garlic to be too tame, so I just sautéed raw garlic with the onions. Since I didn’t have shallots, I just threw in an extra clove of garlic with the onion. 

 For those who said the filling was too watery, that just means that you did not cook your mushrooms long enough. You have to cook the mushrooms until there is no longer any liquid left in the pan. I was a little concerned when I added the cream because I was afraid that would make it watery, but it did all get absorbed and everything was fine.  

For those who said there wasn’t enough puff pastry, the directions clearly say one ‘package’. There are two rolls of puff pastry in the package and you must use both. I also brush the top with an egg wash. My only complaint about these is that they’re small enough to just pop way too many into your mouth. Thanks for the recipe. It’s wonderful.

The filling is great. I used onions, caramelized. Some mushrooms, thyme and half and half and finally Parmesan cheese. The problem is, it should call for two sheets of puff pastry

These were delicious! I only had the 5 inch squares, so I tried to cut them in quarters (2.5 inches square) and they were too small. I am trying them again today with the sheets. Everyone raved about them. I could eat the filling just by itself!!

This was such a delight to serve as an appetizer last night. I used 8oz wild mushrooms (morels, trumpet, & oyster) and 8oz crimini. Since I found my Parmesan cheese to be moldy when I went to use it, I substituted a cup of grated Gruyere. The puff pastry  I bought from Grand Central Baking was made with real butter and I also believe that helped make it turn out better than the pastry with oil in it. I will definitely be making this again and will use a little bit more fresh thyme for extra flavor.

Very tasty. I may try a version in the future with some ground meat added but they are great as is! It was a bit tricky figuring out how thin to roll the dough and how much filling to use. I had some filling left over once I was out of puff pastry.
