I have been making this for years, from a recipe a friend gave me. The ONLY change, is we add 3 tbs mayo to add a little creaminess. We eat this on lsices of toasted baquette. I takes slices of baquette, spritz w/EVOO and toast under broiler and when I have time rub garlic cloves over the hot toasted slices. YUM!

This crab dip went over very well. It was gone in no time!  I did change it a little bit.  I doubled the amount of crab meat.  I used 2 cans for a total of 12 ounces. Absolutely NO imitation crab meat ever! I doubled the amount of green onions and to add a little flavor and creaminess I added a 2-3 tablespoons of Miracle Whip.  Also a couple of dashes of Red Hot didn't hurt.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good dip.  I added grated sharp cheddar cheese and used real crab, then baked it in the oven for 15 minutes. Next time I will use less garlic.   Thanks

Per other reviews I used a chive and onion cream cheese and let the finished product sit in the fridge overnight. I think it would be a little lacking in flavor without the chive and onion cream cheese. Very easy, very tasy, took to a potluck and left with a clean bowl. Will hang onto this recipe.

I 2.5 times this recipe and substitute 1 lb of real crab meat for the imitation.  Everyone raves over it. It's the request for all the parties I'm invited to.  I always serve it hot. Sometimes I put in bread bowl, other times just serve with crackers.  Either way it's terrific.

I have made this three times for parties.  It seems to be the only dip that never has left overs.  I use the onion and chives cream cheese, double the crab and green onions.  Add 3 tablespoons of Helmans real mayo, sprinkle of cayanne pepper and add 1/3 cup of shredded tex/mex chedddar cheese.

I have this same recipe which my mother-in-law gave me after she served this wonderful dip at a party.  The only difference is that she adds 1 to 2 tablespoons of horseradish.  For those of you who like a little kick, it's perfect!!

I had been looking for a crab dip recipe that closely matches a dip served at a local restaurant. This isn't it exactly, but this one is sooooo good, that nobody seems to be able to resist!

My family loved this dip. I added a bit more green onions to give it more color. I would definitely refrigerate this dip over night. The flavors are much more bold when done so!

Very good taste, however, that is with using REAL crab. I used 2 cans fancy lump crab meat well drained. Also, this dip was very runny, don't know if it was due to the canned crab I used even through I thoroughly drained it. Don't know how to remedy this without altering the flavor.

This was a pretty good and really easy recipe. I added some celery and a little onion so it would have more taste, and I used cream cheese with chives.. I thought this recipe was a lot easier and better then the others that called for cocktail sauce or horseradish.

Make this all the time since I catch the crab and keep in my freezer until needed. But, I just use Neufchatel, two tablespoons of Mayo, Garlic power and small green onions. Made it for the NFL Championship last weekend with Coho Salmon fingers which I caught also...

I varied from the recipe a little I had real crab and I ended up using a little Hellman’s to get a creamier consistency and served cold. Served it with Baked Potato Skins to eat while watching the playoffs. Was gone in no time.

This was a big hit!  I wasn't initially thrilled with the result but once it chilled overnight, it really made a difference.  I used 1/2 yellow onion instead of green onions and added a couple shakes of hot sauce as someone else recommended.  I tried a little after heating in microwave and didn't like it, so I served it cold in a sourdough bread bowl.  I will definitely make again, as it was very easy.

Very Good.  Served on crackers.  I added a drop or two of liquid smoke to some of it to try and it was really good.  Smoked Crab dip, Yum!

Was a hit at my book club meeting.  I skipped the copped onion and used onion powder instead (personal preference).  Also used real crab meat instead of imitation.  It was really good, but could have used a bit more 'kick'.  The leftovers were even better after having set even longer.

This was pretty good - could have been a 4 or 5 star if I had the green onions.  I subbed a shallot and the flavor was pretty strong.  I also added some tobasco but not enough to really make the dip spicy.  I may try again but will definitely use the green onion.

I made this dip because I fish for dungeness crab and needed something new to try and now I love it!. My wife is addicted. I use real crab and added a little more crab than what the recipe called for. I like it cold and either use sourdough or french bread for dipping, but chips, crackers, or just about anything is good.

I made this Crab Dip and it was really
 good.I used 1/2 cup Chives and Onion Cream cheese,as I only had one can of crab meat.I used only one green onion.I
used some Old Bay Seasoning and some
Lawrys seasoning salt.I also added some
extra lemon juice.Next time I think I will omit the sour cream and lemon juice,unless I am using quite a bit of
cream cheese.Dip is supposed to be thick.
My dip was on the sloopy side,but it left
a mouth watering taste in my mouth.

The flavor of this recipe was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but nothing to shy at either.  The garlic flavor was a bit much in this recipe.  Perhaps half would be better.  Considering the time it takes to make I'll probably try this again.  Baking in the oven may also help intensify the other flavors.

Based on others' suggestions, I modified things a little and it turned out fantastic!  I reduced the lemon juice and Worcestershire to 1/2 tsp. each, only used one clove of garlic (we're not big fans), added 2 Tblsp. of mayo, used seasoned salt instead of plain, added a little cayenne and a little Old Bay.  Let it sit overnight and served it cold with crackers.  It disappeared quickly, no leftovers. Yum!

WOW! This dip was devoured the first night I made it and I have had requests already for it again. I used no-fat cream cheese and couldn't tell the difference! I also used real crabmeat. It is also excellent if warmed up for about 4 minutes in the microwave before eating. I topped it with chives which adds a little extra color and flavor.

Nothing special. Kind of bland.  It does need a kick.  We ate this on bagels and topped it with cavair

I used canned crab meat.  I also added chili powder to give is a kick.  Over the top before baking, I piled on parmisan cheese.  It was wonderful!

I went with this recipe because it had no cooking and had some spices to keep it from being bland. It was pretty good, I’d make it again. The only minor things I changed was minced sweet onion for the green onion and half a chopped roasted jalapeño and  drained canned crab meat.

Made as written and it was very much lacking in flavor. Needs something to give it a kick.  After making it as written I tried a bit of worchestershire sauce.. still didn't care for it.  I will try it again using REAL crab next time.. just didn't taste like anything to me.. I was disappointed.

Easy, fast and gone in a second once it hit the appetizer table!

Very Good.  Added some Cayenne for a little kick.  Will be making this for years to come.

I am upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  I am still making this recipe, basically as written, over 3 years after I made it the first time.  As written it is excellent.  I have tweaked it by using cheap, frozen, small shrimp that i chop up instead of crab.   It is always gone in about 3.5 seconds.

This is a great recipe...fast and easy with no "fancy" ingrediants (meaning most people will have everything they need on hand to make this).  I do not use imitation crabmeat...I buy the cans of fancy lump crabmeat located in the canned tuna section. Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This dip is delicious hot or cold. Every time I make it, people rave, and inevitably, someone asks for the recipe. I serve it with a loaf of Pillsbury French bread that's been baked in a flower-shaped tube and a loaf of cocktail rye. Crackers are great too. Thanks!

Delicious! I did do a couple things though--I added 2 Tbs. of chili sauce and I roasted the garlic before adding it.  We loved it cold.

This recipe was very good, but just like the other reviews said....much better the next day after the flavors become more bold.  I added extra chives.  Everyone preferred it cold rather than hot.
