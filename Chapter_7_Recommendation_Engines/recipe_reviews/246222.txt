We enjoyed this soup. I used broth and meatballs that were homemade. I did cut the recipe back to two servings as there are only the two of us. I didn't crush the garlic but micro planed it into the broth so that it was evenly distributed. If I were to make this again I would cut back on the broth and add additional crushed tomatoes to make the soup thicker and perhaps some Franks Hot Sauce. Thanks for sharing.

We really enjoyed this soup but I did slightly change the cooking method. Made 4 servings. Did not want to discard the vegetables so put the onions garlic carrots and celery in my soup pot seasoned with S&P and cooked until translucent. Added the tomatoes frozen meatballs only 4 cups of chicken stock (other wise it would have been to much liquid) lemon juice and basil. Cooked a few minutes then added fresh chopped spinach and Parmesan cheese.

Excellent. Didn't have frozen spinach, so I used canned (no salt). Used reduced sodium broth for health purposes. Added diced zucchini, bellpepper and onion. 
 I also skipped the step about adding, boiling then removing the veggies before cooking the main ingredients.

Loved this soup. I cut the carrots celery & onion up into soup-sized pieces and kept them in the soup amd added some pepper. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Very tasty. Will be one of our regulars.

4 stars for the audacity of discarding the vegetables. WTH?. Yes. You can make it in a crockpot. Give it 6 hours on high. I made my own meatballs with Italian spices. About 1.5 to 2 lbs will do. And I used fresh spinach. Chicken bullion cubes are all I have so I just dropped 2 in with water. I just had a add a splash of white wine and a few bay leaves. And good grief don't sift out the vegetables. Why? It's soup. Excellent soup. Will make again!
