Interesting. Used fat free evap, don't think that made a difference. Whipped up beautifully. The texture is thick and foamy but very light on the palate, so it takes a little getting used to. You expect something more dense from the look of it, but what you get is ethereal when you take a spoonful. Give it a try. Oh, a hint, chill your bowl and beaters or whip with your evap. Will give you even more volume.

I've been making something like this for years. We call it creamed jello. I decided to try your recipe to see the difference and I prefered mine. I use only 1 cup of water versus the cup and a half. Also, I skip the cooling down and just throw it all together and mix. Mine has a thicker consistency but still soft and fluffy. With the product I ended up with, there is NO way that this could ever be put into a mold. I also use 2% evap milk to save on calories. You can use any kind of jello you like. The possiblities are endless.

I let my gelatin set up a little more than I should have....it was a little difficult to incorporate w/out deflating the whipped milk but didn't seem to affect the outcome any. I swirled part of the recipe into tiny glass custard cups & tucked them in the middle of some HUGE rose blossoms I cut off one of my rosebushes. I garnished them w/ a couple of fresh raspberries & rose petals (I only use organic products on my roses). The rest of the recipe I poured into a mold & we had it the following day. Lovely recipe...thansk Apple Jacks! Next time I may try subbing juice or even wine for the water to add extra flavor.

This was sooo good and really hit the spot. I used sugar free jello and fat free evaporated milk.  My jello had set up too much when I went to get it from the fridge, so I nuked it for a bit to loosen it up and then beat it into the milk. It was perfect.. nice pretty pink, no red clumps and just delicious. I'm going to try this with another flavor jello next week

this is wonderful.  I did not put the jello mix in the fridge, I just left it on the counter to cool to room temp. It definately serves more than 5 people.

A very old recipe because my mother used to make it with different flavors of jello.   Suggest you use only 3/4 can of evaporated milk.  Always the first dessert to disappear at a church supper.

I am peruvian and this was a common dessert in my grandmother's home in summer. I have also tried it with lemon (lime) juice plus grated lemon rind and unflavored jello plus powdered sugar. We have a very sweet tooth for desserts in Peru and I had a friend who always made this for the people who did not like it very sweet.
