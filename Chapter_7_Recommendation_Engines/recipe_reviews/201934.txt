First of all, my fish looked like the picture which AMAZED me because although I'm not a beginner cook I tend to over batter fish.  This was AMAZING.  My fiance loved it! There are things I changed just to suit my tastes...(I am sure the original recipe would have been just as good.) I added onto the normal salt and pepper...Old Bay, garlic salt, more paprika, a little ground red pepper, onion powder and then I dusted it with flour.  What helped me know that the pan was hot enough was something I learned from the Food Network.  I just took a tiny pinch of flour and tossed it in the oil...if it started to cook or bubble...that's how you know it's ready for the fish.  I did not use the extra unsalted butter.  THIS WAS AWESOME! My fiance ate the whole thing before I could sit down! He said it was better than his mom's! :) He even told his mom about it!  Thank you so much for this dish!

So simple and good! You can add whatever seasoning you like to the flour. (I used blackened seafood seasoning) I made a garlic-butter, parsley and lime sauce to go on top. yum.

Just made this for dinner tonight. It turned out great. My family and I thought it was a great way to prepare tilapia. My filets didn't need 4 min per side. I only had them on each side for approx. 2 min. Paired this with a green salad and it made for a great, easy and quick weeknight dinner.

I used lemon pepper seasoning instead of regular black pepper. If gave it a hint of lemon flavoring. Very good.

It came out better than I anticipated, I rarely use flour for breading fish. And, I've never fried Tilapia, always grilled or baked. Yummy!

As written we rated a 4 as we felt it needed a little more spice.  The next batch we took the advice of others and added in Old Bay Seasoning and left out the butter as we felt in was not necessary.  Yummy

Delicious recipe! I added the spices (garlic salt, pepper, crushed oregano) to the flour before I coated the fish as well, which reduced the spices I had to add directly to the fish. Also, instead of brushing the melted butter on top of the fish during cooking, I added about half a tablespoon to the olive oil, and then heated the two together before adding the fish, so the fish seared in the oil and butter. My fish did not need 4 minutes per side either, they were perfect at about 3 minutes a side. So yummy, cannot wait to make this again!

This is my first review! I made this awhile ago but i have been making it on the regular basis now for awhile! This was AWESOME! I was looking for a way to prepare tilapia other than baking it and this was a HIT! The only difference i do is add a little lemon juice to the butter before drizzling it! Perfect!

This was a wonderful way to prepare tilapia. We were very pleasantly suprised. I used "Blackened Seasoning Mix" from this site to season the tilapia, along with some salt. I skipped the butter to cut back on calories. We didn't miss it at all. I know this recipe will be making a repeat appearance at our dinner table!

We followed the recipe with the salt and pepper mix. We felt that we were going to have a problem with the oil. Seemed like we didn't have enough to give the pan a good coating. Other than that we loved the fish and would plan on cooking it this way again.

This recipe is pretty good as is, however, I felt it needed just a little something more.  I made it a 2nd time and seasoned the fish with some Old Bay, along with the salt and pepper.  I also squeezed a bit of fresh lemon onto the fish once it was done cooking.  These two little changes brought it from a 4.5 star to a 5 star.  Both times I made it I served it with brussel spouts and rice pilaf.  I thought it paired well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been cooking tilapia this way for years, my sister cooked it for me once and now this is my go-to recipe for tilapia.  I started using Season-all instead of salt and pepper and it adds enough flavor that you won't need the butter(not discounting the deliciousness of butter, sometimes you want to save on the calories).  Try this for your fish tacos with a nice corn salsa and a side of cole slaw!!

AWESOME! So light and wonderful. It went great with brown rice and broccoli. My husband loved it. I did add some lemon juice at the end, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again (and often!).

So easy. I was worried it would have a fishy taste since the recipe did not call for lemon. None whatsoever. The entire family loved it. We will be making this again.

Great!  My hubby loves tilapia, but I could take it or leave it...but this recipe had me taking seconds!  I substituted italian panko bread crumbs for the flour & it was perfect.  Since no egg is used the panko didn't completely cover the fish, but added the perfect amount of texture and taste.  Served this with a homemade tarter sauce, steamed carrots & sesame green beans...wonderful!

I really enjoyed this recipe - very simple, yet tasty.  Nice alternative to the normal way I cook Tillipia (which is my favorite fish because it is so light in flavor) which is breading and pan frying. Similar, but this recipe uses less flour and less oil, so a bit healthier.  

I used some gourmet salt for extra flavor - Salish, alderwood smoked sea salt on one side (which adds a nice smokey flavor), and Hawaiian Pink Jurassic sea salt on the other. And of course the pepper and flour as well.  The searing, butter and the coarser salt gave it a nice bit of crunch.

I also topped it off with some tomato, sliced olives, capers and balsamic vinegar that I warmed up in a pan - for a mediterranean touch. 

Very nice!

Super simple, super fast and super yummy!  Had a half dozen tilapia fillets and about 10 minutes to cook them up and this was just incredibly easy and yielded a slightly crisp outside.  Kids loved it!

love this recipe - easy, healthy and very good.  I use a little parmesan in the flour occasionally for an extra zing...be sure to use a non-stick pan.

This is an absolutely beautiful and simple recipe. I was looking for an easy way to prepare my tilapia on allrecipes, but you'd be amazed at what most people consider "easy" or "simple". This recipe really fit-the-bill, though. The one difference I made to the recipe was that I used Kentucky Kernel Seasoned Flour, but I'm sure it still would have been golden brown and delicious with regular all-purpose flour, too.

 I paired this fish with bacon and brussel sprouts as a side-dish. Everybody in the house thoroughly enjoyed this tilapia, so this recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was great as is, but the last few pieces I brushed with Grey Poupon with horseradish deli mustard before placing in the flour.  It added such a wonderful flavor, and was still so easy.  Loved It!

Quick, easy and delicious! Done all in less than 20 minutes! Full of flavor Tilapia fillets that will leave you asking for more, served them on a bed of white rice with a green salad and a Heineken! So good I'm definitively making them again for lunch or dinner!

This was great! Very basic, nothing fancy, but sometimes that is what you are looking for! I used Swai fillets for this.

This was excellent. I followed others suggestions and added a little onion powder, and garlic salt, and the flavor with the butter was amazing. My very picky six year old had two helpings!! That's unheard of in our house. This will definitely be added to our rotation.

This couldn't have been easier and it tasted great too. There are so many ways you could go with this recipe...but the way it's written is yummy.

I made this and it turned out great it really did look like the picture. Instead of using salt I used mrs. Dash and it tasted just as good. I recommend it it's quick and easy to prepare.

The flour needed some spices for flavor and heating/cooking with olive oil on medium high heat will not work as it has a low smoke point.

This was very good. I've been on the hunt for easy tilapia recipes and this one worked great.  The flour added a nice crunch. I might make it even crunchier with parmesean cheese added to the flour next time.  I put Tony Chachere's cajun salt on everything so that's the only thing I added.  Delish fish!

Good and easy. I added old bay to the flour. I forgot to salt and pepper. Tested oil by putting a pinch of flour in the oil. However my tilapia tasted fishy.

This was so good! I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, so I added a dash of garlic salt and cayenne pepper to the flour. It was perfect! It was so good, I ate two pieces to myself, then made two more pieces for lunch the next day. Will definitely make again. (The only reason I gave it four stars was because I added the spices to the flour, otherwise it's definitely 5!)

It was okay but it does not smell good at all. I would reccomend putting ketchup on it but its still going to be the same. If you are a fish lover, you might like this recipe but I wouldn't be so sure. But some people realy like this type of food.

I thought this was pretty good and I'm not a huge fish fan.  I added most of a packet of Old Bay Seasoning to the flour mixture and just realized I forgot to brush on the butter at the end.  Oh well, it was still good!

this recipe seems like the perfect starter way to cook tilapia. i'm just getting started learning how to cook and i liked this recipe. it's simple and easy to follow and turns out really well. it also allows for further experimentation, so next time i'm going to add different spices and also may nix the butter. (like what @LesleyfromWI said, it seemed unnecessary)

Wonderful!  This has a great taste and very easy to make. Before I added the butter I squeezed a lemon over the fish. I served on buns with homemade tarter sauce for a filet of fish sandwich. My mother was impressed (which is hard to do) and my picky eather gobbled it up.

I've made this several times, but this time I added 2 T of corn meal. I think it makes it a little extra crispy. also  a little  garlic powder .  The recipe works well.

I have made this recipe many times without changing a thing and it's excellent.  Occasionally I top the fish with some shredded parmesan cheese at the end of the cooking and this also makes it wonderfully good.

A little bland. A few days after making it, we made it again but used Old Bay rather than salt & pepper and it was great. Thanks for the starter recipe.

Easy and excellent!  I added additional spices to my flour (crushed red pepper, garlic pwdr, tarragon) and I added the butter to the cooking oil.  Perfect for a quick weeknight meal or a last minute dinner with guests.

I tried the recipe almost exactly as written but seasoned with cajun seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper and added fresh lemon juice (1/2 lemon) to the melted butter. It was delicious! It was so easy. My husband loved it too and he is not a huge fan of tilapia nor frozen fish filets, which is what I used. I will be making this again.

This was delicious. I used blackened seasoning instead of salt and pepper and made it in my cast iron skillet. I served it with a marinated tomato and green pepper garden salad and broccoli cheese rice. Everything came together in under 15 minutes. Will probably make this once a month.

I made a delicious mistake with this recipe.... I accidentally used powdered sugar instead of flour. Now, normally that would end terribly, but not with this recipe! It was amazing! I would recommend trying it. I am normally not someone who likes the sweet and savory mix, but this really made a great combination. It may be clear that I am not someone who cooks very often or is a good cook (I mean, I did use powdered sugar instead of flour), but this recipe was really simple and came out great. I also substituted the salt and pepper with garlic and herbs because my wife doesn't like salt and pepper.

This is a simple yet very good recipe! I added Bragg organic mixed seasoning to the flour - I used a bit more olive oil than 1 tbsp but wow was this ever good - my kids loved it! I served it with steamed veg and lemon spinach couscous.

Very good and extremely simple! Like most other reviewers, I seasoned with Old Bay, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Instead of cooking in olive oil and adding butter at the end, I cooked the fish in 2 tablespoons of butter. The flavor was delicious!

I sprinkled on some garlic herb bread crumbs instead of flour. Also added some white wine halfway thru cooking. First time cooking tilapia; turned out pretty good. Served with bacon wrapped asparagus and spicy sweet potato fries.

This was delicious. I cooked it 3 minutes on each side, and it was perfect. I added, as some others had, garlic powder, old bay, oregano, and 21 Seasoning Salue from Trader Joe's. No salt. Made some tartar sauce and sqeezed on some lemon.  Delish!

Yum! Very good recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added onion powder and paprika in addition to salt and pepper (would've added Old Bay, but I don't have any). Although a lot of reviewers said the butter wasn't needed, I decided to go ahead and use it anyway. I think it gave it that nice finishing touch. I will definitely be making this again!

I used cajun seasoning and put it in the flour. Much better after that.

A tad bland, and I missed my normal garlic/lemon /olive oil flavor (marinate for one hour with some salt and pepper before cooking on a hot stove, and it is perfect).  Topped it with some remoulade which helped, and was needed...alone it would have been lacking.  Sure was pretty with the seared coloring, though!  I may do this again and tweak the flavoring so there is more kick, because I loved the way it looked so much.

I rated this a 5 because it is quick and very good. The fish was extremely moist and delicious. I have never pan fried tilapia before, but I will be definitely making this again.

Easy & good!!  I added Old Bay & Paprika as others suggested & omitted the butter.  I think it would be a little bland w/out these, that's why I gave it 4 stars. My only regret is not making more. Thanks for sharing!

Best option we've tried for our bag of frozen tilapia.  And the only recipe that our kids would eat.  Granted it isn't the most flavorful, but it does turn out nice.

This recipe was awesome and great for a night when you don't have a lot of time.  I used a garlic-type seasoning instead of salt and pepper and it turned out delicious.  The texture of the fish was wonderful using the flour-oil pan searing method.

Really good.  I missed out on the butter and parsley, just forgot but I don't think we really missed it.  And hubby had lemon at the table as I don't care for it.  We really enjoyed this and hubby went back for thirds.  Adding this easy and fast fish fry to our regular rotation.

I needed a quick and easy pan seared fish recipe to pair with the dill sauce I had made from the Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce recipe, here on AR, and this fit the bill.  I just made two servings for Hubs and me, and let me just say that all that flour is not needed and you'll end up throwing most of it away.  For my two servings I used just 2 T. of flour, seasoned it with salt, pepper and some Old Bay, and I still threw at least half of that away!  I pan-seared the fish over medium heat, because I was afraid the flour might burn at the higher temperature.  This was delicious served with the dill sauce, but the flour coating seemed to be rather tough and pull away from the delicate fish.  I think we would have preferred  a panko/parmesan encrusted fish, but this was good and neither Hubs nor I was complaining.  If you're in a hurry, this certainly is quick.

I'm going to be the odd one out here and say that this recipe didn't wow me.  Usually I bake tilapia with lemon pepper on it and myself and the kids eat every last bite.  I made this recipe as written and it came out of the pan looking like the picture but flavor was not there.  Being that tilapia is such a mild fish to begin with, it is a blank palette to incorporate anything you want.  I'll stick with baked and lemon pepper.

This is my go-to recipe for Tilapia.  It's quick, easy, doesn't have many ingredients and is flavorful.  I don't like frying in a lot of oil, but this is sautéed in just a bit of healthy oil and comes out moist with a hint of a crispy coating.  The only thing I change is  substituting Bay Seasoning for the salt and pepper, which we love on any seafood.  I like uncomplicated food and tastes, not boring, but healthy and flavorful.  I have tried other recipes for Tilapia but always come back to this one...I rated it 5 stars for flavor and ease of preparation...

I have been cooking tilapia dishes for years and this is my most common way of cooking it. (Be sure to sift the flour once so it will coat the fish evenly and sear more quickly.)  The trick is finding the proper temperature and keeping cooking time to a minimum. Never leave the fish unattended while it cooks. One caution however, it is getting more difficult to find tilapia that has not been farmed or taken from heavily polluted Asian waters and I won't buy either.  The stuff from S. American waters is probably much safer to eat. Or you can easily substitute any tilapia recipe with flounder or sole.

Tilapia has a fragile flesh and delicate taste.  This is THE BEST way to prepare it.  Easy and delish!  The white flour coating is perfect, but put generous amounts of lemon pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and salt in it.  Sauté the fillets in 1 T OO and 2 T butter, and be sure to bring oil up to browning temp, then just cook for 2-3 min on each side.   After turning fish, sprinkle top with more onion and garlic powder and lemon pepper.  Sauté for 2-3 minutes and turn out on plate.  Drizzle pan dripping over fish and squeeze fresh lemon on, to taste, before eating.  Great over wilted spinach.

This was great.  My kids always complain when I make fish, so I don't make it very often. Was looking for an easy recipe. This was it. Everyone liked it and requested I make it again. I definitely will... so easy and tasty. Very basic, but that was a good thing during a busy week.

I made this recipe and it was great! I made a few modifications, I used gluten free flour and added a few other seasonings (garlic & onion powder, paprika and red pepper) to the fish before I floured them.  My kids and husband LOVED it.  I also made a tomato, onion, and bell pepper salsa to go over it along with a little slice of avocado.  That really set off the flavors! I highly recommend this dish!!

This is a great way to prepare Tilapia. The fish came out flaky and moist, but it lacked flavor. It needs something more to make it a really good recipe. I really liked how the fish came out so I'll try this again with more seasoning or a sauce. UPDATE: I made this again using Old Bay seasoning and the flavor was much better. The fish still came out flaky and moist but the "crust" was more flavorful.

Made this twice already with Swai and both times, I forgot the butter at the end. Oh well, it was yummy anyway! I don't like pepper, so used season all. 1/2 c. flour is too much. I didn't measure the second time, just eyeballed what I thought was needed. It's a fast, easy, and tasty recipe.

I cook this all the time and Hubby LOVES it!  It's a great way to cook flounder or sole, too.  And, depending on my mood, I may "bread" the fish with flour, bread crumbs, panko, or with nothing at all. I add the butter to the olive oil to cook the fish, though. Delicious!!

As written this was a little plain - second time, we mixed 2 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning with the flour. Recipe can easily be converted to gluten free by substituting either rice or quinoa flour. You can cut down on the fat content without sacrificing flavor by mixing the butter or margarine with the olive oil in the pan for frying, rather than topping the fish with it.

We prefer Basa over tilapia , because it can sometimes be very fishy. This is an excellent, easy recipe that I use quite often.
In addition to S&P, I also sprinkle on dill and also add some butter to the olive oil.
This recipe would be great with any fish and any seasoning for that matter. It really has a nice firm, not crunchy coating.
Thank you for Sharing.

This is an easy way to prepare Tilapia.  I generously seasoned the filets in a lemon pepper seasoning before giving them a light dredge in the flour.  Instead of brushing the butter on afterward, I just melted it in the pan with the olive oil for frying.  They were delicious.  The flavors were locked in due to the pan searing and there was no grease residue.  This method works great on many other types of fish as well.  Served with rice pilaf and asparagus, this makes for a lovely meal.

This is my favorite way to make fish - so quick and easy.  One thing I do differently is to begin with 1 T each olive oil and butter, then I don't add any additional butter.  Like others have mentioned, I generally use a cajun or similar seasoning mixture instead of plain salt and pepper.  Finally, I like to accompany this with sauteed spinach.  I remove the fish from the skillet and cover to keep warm, then give the skillet a quick wipe down with a paper towel only if it looks too browned.  I add additional olive oil & butter, garlic, and fresh spinach, then cook for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.  The spinach cooks down in about 2 minutes - perfect.

I'm on a tight budget and after springing for the Tilapia fillets, I skipped the olive oil and settled for Canola oil and a pat of butter for each pan of fish I fried.  I used the seas salt and the pepper, but I didn't use the lemon.  A bit too zesty for my taste.  Instead, I lightly sprinkled the skillet/pan with Lawry's course ground garlic w/parsley and for each side of each fillet, lightly sprinkled with Mrs. Dash.  Was very happy with the results and  served it with my own cole slaw.  The hubs loved it, and I foundered.  LOL

Very easy and delicious.  I added some other herbs to the salt and pepper, and I didn't add the butter on top, but otherwise followed the directions.  I can see changing up the spicing for a different "mood" to fit whatever else I'm preparing to go with it.  I foresee more fish on our menu after discovering this recipe!

Very good. I changed up the recipe by melting 1 tbsp oil with 1 tbsp of butter in the frying pan. I added 1/4 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning to the flour in addition to sprinkling the seasoning on the fish. Then drizzled lemon juice over the fish prior to serving

This is great, so simple. I've never been much good at pan cooking fish but we're trying to eat healthier and my husband doesn't like poached or baked fish. I left out the butter at the end but other than that I did mine and my daughter's exactly as the recipe, and for my husband's I used Adobo instead of the salt (since he has to have Adobo on pretty much everything he eats). Came out perfect, tender but not mushy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside.

This is a great basic recipe. You can really season the flour anyway you like it. Personally I like to add some paprika and garlic powder. But the possibilities are endless! I also mix in the salt and pepper with the flour rather than putting it directly on the tilapia.

I substituted coconut oil last night and served with Garlic Dill New Potatoes and steamed kale.  Prepared extra butter from the potato recipe and drizzled it on the fish and veggies, too.  Will be fixing this about once a month now!

This was great!  I did add onion & garlic powder and paprika.  Seared the fish in the pan for 4 mins on each side and finished in the oven for about 15 mins because I like my fish well done.  I will make this again.

I followed the recipe as is, and really liked the flavor.  I added some garlic and lemon juice which made it better.  I liked pan searing, but my fish took a lot longer than 4 minutes, I guess it depends on how thick your fish is.  I liked the crispy outside and flakey inside though.  Oh, something that should be mentioned in the recipe is that the oil needs to be nice and hot BEFORE you put the fish in.  The recipe says to heat it up all together.  I will definitely try this again.  Better texture than just baking.  And mine looked like the picture too, but the kids got into before I could take a pic!

Update: I've made this several times now.  The whole family loves it.  I don't add the butter on at the end anymore - I don't find it's needed.  It's quick and easy, and way better flavor and texture than baking.  This is now my go to fish recipe.  We've tried it with Catfish, Cod and Halibut.

Tried this recipe with a few moderations tonight.  Family loved it.
Instead of flour I used 1/2cup cornmeal. Added paprika,onion powder and
garlic powder to salt and pepper.  The filets came out golden brown and
very tasty.

To avoid a bland flavor, season the flour before you dredge the filets. I had six filets and next time, I'll only use just less than 1/3 cup flour; most of it is wasted. I added a teaspoon each of Penzey's Mural of Flavor and seasoned salt to the flour, and I'm certain it made a difference. I forgot to add the melted butter at the end, but we sprayed each filet with some butter flavoring and it worked fine. For a really quick meal, serve this with couscous and your favorite steamed veggies or salad.

I love, Love, LOVE this recipe!  Such a great weeknight meal.  Rather than all purpose flour I used whole wheat flour (all I had on hand, and hey...you can always use more whole wheat in your diet!) added a bit of garlic powder and tada!  quick easy weeknight dinner that I didn't even have to feel guilty about!  Served with rice and salad.

This was pretty good, although not out of this world. Next time I will probably try adding additional seasoning in addition to what was called for. Also, the fish was only lightly browned, as it was definitely done and would have gotten too dry to get it to the dark color in the photo. Everyone's stoves are different however, so I don't blame that on the recipe. I suppose I could try frying at a lower heat and see if that helps.

Not sure if I did something wrong or what... this was my first time pan-searing fish so maybe it was just because I'm inexperienced, but this did not turn out how I expected. I followed the directions as is but my fish was kind of plain. It did have some nice crunchy browning around the edges but the meatier parts of the filet were still softer, which maybe is normal, not sure. I also would have preferend a little more seasoning to the fish, but I suppose next time I could play around with that. My husband liked this fish but I just found it missing something.

This was very good and very easy - a nice alternative to broiled tilapia drizzled in (fill in the blank - we eat a LOT of tilapia).  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it was a little "delicately seasoned" for my tastes.  I amped it up a bit with spices that we like.  It tasted a little like oven baked chicken, had a nice crisp/tender consistency, and was consumed by the kids without complaint.

Delicious and simple!  This is pretty much fool-proof.  I skipped the brush of butter, just to keep it slightly healthier, and instead gave it a squeeze of lemon once it was on the plate.  Served with roasted garlic couscous and steamed asparagus...excellent meal!

I thought this was okay. Not a ton of flavor. However, I was able to save it by sprinkling the fish with lemon pepper, when I added the salt and pepper. It needed about double the amount of olive oil to crisp up and about half the flour got wasted. I also improved it by removing the fish after the butter was half way melted and then pouring in about 3 oz of broth mixed with about 2 Tblsp of lemon juice per another recipe. I heated it briefly and then poured it over the plated fish.

Quick, easy, and delicious! Only change: I used whole wheat flour.  Regardless of the flour, it was very very tasty and a nice change from my usual weekday lemon pepper tilapia.

The recipe rocked! The only addition I did was use onion powder, garlic & herb seasoning, and ground paprika with the addition of salt and paper to season it up. 

And the trick with the oil that Susan recommended (from the most helpful critical review) was very helpful too! (If you sprinkle flour in the oil and it bubbles, its ready to cook!)

I have made this a few times. Being a college Guy I don't have much time/money, and my cooking skills aren't the best either. I made this and only made one change to the recipe.  I add Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning (original) to the flour before I put the fish in it (enough to cover the top of the flour in a cereal bowl?) I also sprinkle a Tad on the fish itself. This gives it a nice kick. Overall a nice inexpensive dish that even I can make!

I was looking for an easy tilapia recipe that I could make for one person at any meal. I added paprika to the flour and it made this fish delicious! Be sure not to overcook though! I found the fish didn't need quite as much time as the recipe called for.

My husband loved this dish, he actually asked me to make it again soon. The only changes I made was not to brush the fish with butter at the end and I also added some other spices before the flour to make sure the fish had great flavor with out needed fat. It had a wonderful light and delicious flavor!

This recipe was delicious.  I have been getting pan seared fish at a local restaurant and when we sat down to dinner tonight with the pan seared tilapia, it tasted just like what we had eaten at the restaurant.  I am not crazy about fried food, but this was great and not greasy!  We had broccoli and couscous along with it.

This easy pan fry recipe works very well with tilapia.  The tilapia will remain moist while being crispy on the outside if so desired.  Don't be afraid to experiment with sauces  I usually combine mayo, apricot preserves, lemon and soy sauce to create a creamy sauce that goes well with any white fish.   Serve with homemade french fries or steamed rice.   Yummy!

So easy and tasty.  I am gluten free so I just made it with my gluten free all purpose flour (Bob's Red Mill) and it was fantastic.  I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  We will definitely be having this again!

I love this fish. This is a better method to grilling fish besides the normal way of grilling and I did not have to deep fry tilapia. This is a method between regular grilling and frying, and it came out great!! Thanks alot!!!

This was a great base recipe for pan-searing tilapia.  I added some cayenne and paprika to give the fish just a little kick of heat.  Fast and tasty.  I forgot to brush with the butter, but it still turned out great!

Great recipe. I did make a couple of changes because of wheat and dairy intolerances. Instead of flour, I crushed up rice Chex cereal and instead of cows milk butter I used vegan, soy free butter. The Chex gave the fish a great crunchy texture. I also sprinkled one side of the fish with paprika.

This was a fantastic recipe.  It was so simple and effective, made me feel like a chef!  It was awesome because I really wanted some fried fish, but my wife convinced me to look up some recipes and I was able to find this healthy alternative.  Highly recommended!

Great things are usually simple - so is this recipe. Try adding some crushed garlic and chopped parsley to melted butter. Absolutely delicious!!! I'll cook different kinds of fish this way.

I didn't add the extra butter because I wanted to keep this dish light. Overall great but could use some more seasoning mixed into the flour.

Love the simplicity of this recipe - made my own adjustments and the fish turns out AMAZING!

I spread the flour out on a plate and mix in spices (variations of garlic powder, onion powder, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, thyme, paprika, etc) before dipping the fish into it. 

I cook it until it starts to get crispy on the outside and it is just delicious!

This is a great and simple recipe! I'm not a fan of fish in general, but I made it for my husband. He loved it and keeps asking me to make it again! It is super easy to make and tastes delicious [according to my husband]. If you need something quick and simple, make this!

Made this for the kids for lunch. They liked it, but mine didn't get good color on it, it was a weird whitish color. I tried some of it, and it was very good, had a fried fish flavor without the fried.

Used 1/2 flour and 1/2 panko crumbs with a little cayenne and Old Bay seasoning, fried in olive oil.  Very good, used tartar sauce.

Great Recipe! I only gave it 4 stars because I made a few alterations. Instead of flour, I used cajun seafood breading mix.  I also seasoned the tilapia with seasons I like (garlic salt, lemon pepper, pepper).  Omitted the butter altogether! Awesome!

Very good, "crust" was a bit crispy and the fish was light and flaky.  Served it with a risotto.  Husband enjoyed it, complimented the meal several times.

This was such a simple and yummy way to do tilapia on a weeknight! I seasoned mine with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before dipping in flour.  I also added a little  butter to the oil before frying.  I skipped the melted butter step- seems unnecessary (although I'm sure it's great!).  Hubby liked it as well.  Served ours with roasted asparagus, baked potatoes, and yeast rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I am on a diet but really wanted some fried fish and this did the trick.  I used cooking spray instead of oil to cut down on the fat even more.  I think using the oil would have added to the crunchiness factor, but it was still really delicious!  Thank you for the recipe.  Oh, and used some old bay seasoning - flavor was just lovely!

Great reciepe. I've always had trouble cooking fish. It's  always to done or under cooked. This came out perfect and had very little greese. I seasoned with old bay and used Ky Kernel flour and served with some salsa instead of tarter sauce. really good and light meal. will make again soon.

Awesome recipe. Will be making this again and again. Love how quick it is to make.  Made it as written with one addition - Old Bay seasoning. My husband is from Maryland and it’s a staple at our house.  Thanks so much for sharing.

WE LOVED IT! I cheated tho. I used Old Bay Seasoning sifted in the flour and melted my butter in the oil. I did use more oil because I made 3 very large pieces. We enjoyed our fish with rice and peas. 

Peas...you can use canned or frozen. At least 14 oz, 1 T Unsalted Butter, and 2 T Bacon Grease. Put everything in the pot, cover, and cook on low while you prepare everything else. No need to add salt because that's already in your bacon grease. **If using canned make sure you drain the peas and rinse well to remove any added salt. If you feel a need to add any water while cooking, by all means, do. 

Rice...2 C White Minute Rice, 2 C Unsalted or Low Sodium Chicken Broth, 3 T Unsalted Butter, 3/4 T Garlic Powder, 3/4 T Onion Powder, 1 T Italain Seasoning, 2 Shakes of Salt and Pepper to taste. Prepare your minute rice according to package directions.

There you go. Our dinner was lovely, tasty, and very low on fat.

Wow! This was the first time I've ever cooked fish in a pan and it came out perfect. I've always baked it in the oven. I will be using this method from now on because the sear enhances the flavour so much. I added the butter right to the pan while cooking. I recommend serving it with the excellent dill sauce from the Hudson's Tilapia recipe on this site.

I used almond flour for a keto take on it.  I also made browned butter as a sauce because I was worried that the breading would fall off if there was too much moisture.

I made this simple recipe and my son and my boyfriend agreed it was super delicious! I have tried other more elaborated fish recipes even marinating included but this one was saved as my favorite. The only different thing I adde was garlic powder, the rest was salt and pepper. We like the fish a bit crispy so I flip the fish every 5 minutes until the golden color showed up and it was the best dinner ever !

I used Cajun seasoning (Tony’s) rather than just salt and pepper. Super easy, quick meal that was delicious! Paired with red beans and rice. Trying to add fish to my weekly meals and this was a great start!

I used magic dust seasoning in the flour instead of just salt and pepper.  I also melted the butter in the olive oil. Turned out so good. You can find the magic  dust seasoning recipe at www.thespruce.com/magic-dust-spice-rub-335886. I use it on everything.

This recipe helped to start.  But definitely needs more spices.  I add paprika, oregano,  chilli flakes, garlic and onion powder to the flower mixture.  Also add lemon juice with the butter while cooking.

This is a good basic recipe.  Tilapia is such a bland fish, it really needs more seasonings to make it tasty.  We have given up on Tilapia and gone back to Catfish, Ocean Perch or Basa.

I usually will just pan sear it without the flour, but the flour  made a huge difference! A perfect crispy layer! I went slightly lower on temp closer to medium and at four minutes it was already starting to burn so I would suggest flipping it closer to three minutes. I marinated the fish in teriyaki sauce for about 30 minutes then flavored the flour with garlic and a spicy seasoning I have. We both loved it! Will definitely be a new staple going forward!

This recipe is headed in the right direction, but it doesn't enhance the tilapia flavor enough. Experiment with it!

Awesome simple recipe first try made as stated, second round used Catfish and  mixed Aleppo Pepper into the flour for some added color and smoky flavor. On the fish in addition to salt, used lemon pepper and infused the butter with garlic powder a bit of olive oil and parsley. Cant wait to try on other fish!

I cooked this in a large electric skillet, and, because I didn't check the recipe again, I mixed the butter in with the olive oil to saute the fish. It still was easy, and came out very good. My only regret is that I didn't do a sauce with it. So, I recommend tarter sauce or even Chef John's tomato sauce on the side. Oh, and lemon.

Simple, savory and very healthy.  I substituted coconut flour to make it more Keto friendly and I thought the coconut flavor addition was very pleasant.  I think next time I will serve with a lemon wedge to bring a little zing to the party.

This was my first time making tilapia and it turned out delicious! My only deviation from the recipe is that I fried it in about 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and let it drain on paper towels before putting on the plate. I think I would use some garlic salt next time, and maybe some lemon. But this will be how I prepare tilapia from now on. So easy!

Delicious!  I used garlic salt, black pepper and a chipotle based smoky pepper blend.  The light flouring gave it a nice looking and tasty “crust”

I added Old Bay with the salt and pepper, and squeezed some lemon on it at the end instead of butter. It was so good, and my mom loved it too, she said it was restaurant quality!! I’ve never pan fried tilapia, only baked it, so I wasn’t sure how it would turn out. But it’s so good and  so easy and quick to make, would definitely make again and again. I wish I took a picture, they were so pretty, but they were long gone before I thought about it (:

I didn't have unsalted butter so used salted butter and no salt for pre-seasoning, as I do need to watch my salt intake.  Definitely bland for my family's taste, would be willing to try again but with stronger seasoning.

I added a bit of lemon pepper to it to give it bit of a tang or  kick to it, which I like in most of my dishes. Take it easy on the lemon pepper; it can give quite the kick if you put too much on.

Very good! Would be a delicious way to prepare fish for fish tacos.  Thanks for the recipe. Will make again. Update: added a little paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the flour. Butter is not necessary.

My husband made this for us tonight.  Usually he just grills tilapia on the stove, but it falls apart and doesn't have much flavor.  When he made this tonight, I fell in love with tilapia.  It had excellent flavor and it didn't fall apart.  Next time, I'll make it for HIM!  This was a delight to eat and we'll definitely be making this regularly.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My family LOVED IT!!! It was my first time making this and I wanted to do something different. I did add the old bay and also some onion powder and garlic salt. It was delicious. I made it with baked sweet potato and broccoli. Will definitely make this again. Awesome recipe!!!

I've recently started only eating seafood, so I'm constantly looking for new recipes. I made this for my family and it was delicious. The seasoning was on point and it was nice and flaky. It looked just like the photo. I'll definitely make this again

i used montreal chicken seasoning, instead of salt and pepper.  also buttered the filets before turning.  they got browner and crispier.  needs a lemon wedge, but otherwise delicious

One of the best tilapia recipes I ever made. Since I have a gluten intolerant child, I used gluten free flour. I cooked yellow rice on the side. It was delicious!!

This fish tasted great.  I did use Old Bay's seasoning mixed with the flour rather than just some salt and pepper.  When I removed the fish from the skillet I spread a small amount of butter over it rather than melting the butter and brushing it on.  It melted since the fish was hot.  We will definitely have this again.

Great recipe. I found it to be flavorful enough with just salt and pepper. I did have to add olive oil after I flipped them, and I did not top with butter to save on calories. This was very easy and delicious. I will make it again!

My MIL already had tilapia defrosting for dinner & wasn't feeling well. So, I needed something fast with the ingredients on hand. Like the suggested,  I did add extra seasoning as well (we had adobo), I did 2-3 mins per side & made rice. YUMMY!

Very easy and very tasty. I added Old Bay Seasoning to the flour coating and it was perfect. Anyone from the Mid-Atlantic is aware of Old Bay and what it can do for seafood and just about everything else. I will make it again.

Super simple and easy to make, i seasoned with salt, black pepper and lemon pepper. I skipped the last step with the butter but even without it I still got a nice light crisp. Make sure the fire is medium high or you won't get that crisp.

This is a good recipe. I found it lacked in seasoning for our taste tho. I added a salt doll combo and onion powder as well as pepper to the flour. I also added the butter to the skillet instead of after it was cooked. I still had to add salt and more seasoning half way thru the batch. It was cooked perfect. I def will keep this in my favorites and make again. I loved it.

Fantastic and so simple!  I did throw some garlic salt, paprika, and pepper into the flour mix.  But it cooked up perfectly. Drizzling with butter just before serving was the finishing touch.

I am by no means a good cook so I love how simple this was! I did substitute the salt & pepper for Sea Salt Seasoning & Lemon Pepper Flakes. Cooking it on med-high is the only thing I would change. If I cooked it closer to medium I think it would have turned out a little better.  All in all I would definitely recommend.

I didn't use the butter (not needed) and added Old Bay seasoning and it was amazing.  Squeezed some lemon on it after it was seared and it was perfect.

I would definitely make it again. Some don't like the butter so I might make some with the butter brushed on and some without.

Solid simple recipe. I'd recommend an equally solid and simple sauce or glaze to go with it though.

I'm giving this 5 stars so I remember how much we all loved it!  I used swai filets.   Based upon other reviews, I added some Old Bay and some Mrs. Dash for extra flavor.  It really was very delicious and pretty on the plate.  I would serve this to company with some fresh parsley and lemon for garnish!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so quick and easy! Instead of sprinkling with salt and pepper,  I added Tony Chachere's  Creole Seasoning to the flour--a half tablespoon at most. I will definitely make this again.

My new favourite quick dinner.......I just change up the seasonings to what I feel like that evening.  More often than not, I use cajun seasoning.  I also add lemon juice after I turn the fith.  I like the flavor and it adds a light cripness to the outside

I used Corn Meal instead of All Purpose Flour. Added Garlic Powder and Paprika. Also squeezed a lemon over the Talapia just before basting with butter. Over all, pure deliciousness!

Everyone in my family loved the Tilapia!  However, it definitely needs more seasoning than salt and pepper.  I used garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and seasoning salt, although some sort of lemon pepper or lemon zest seasoning would be good, also.  Being a novice at cooking fish, I did not think to cover the fish while it was being pan seared, and our entire house was filled with a smokey haze!   Next time I will definitely cover it.

This was very good and went just as the recipe was written.
I did add a Cajan Seasoning along with the S&P.
Served with Toasted almond and Balsamic green beans and Quinoa.

This is a great recipe.  Like many other reviewers, I usually bake my tilapia as I try to avoid fried foods.  But this was too good not to be my new favorite way of preparing this lovely, mild fish.  Also like many others, I just added some Old Bay seasoning and omitted the butter for a healthier version.   Thanks for the original recipe and the wonderful ideas from other viewers.

I make this all the time.  I like to add a taste of garlic and basil, not too much bc the fish is mild.  With quality olive oil, and the seasonings I don't even need the butter.  It lowers the cholesterol and calories.  It's just wonderful with a fresh green salad and quinoa (better than rice but be sure to rinse it before cooking.)

I put in garlic powder, red pepper, onion salt, Old Bay Seasoning,
I took a plastic container of Carl Budding Lunchmeat and used that to put my flour in. WORKED SLICK!!  Exactly the right size. And only have to have only a tablespoon or 2 of flour in it. (well, maybe more) I didn't use butter sauce on all fillets after cooking. That would ruin the crisp crunch I like, but I tried it on some and it was OK. I cooked for longer than 4 minutes on lower heat because I like crisp crunch on outside.
          I had left over chicken too and floured that up and actually the chicken tasted waaay better with that recipe. Just 4 slices off of a drumstick.  I used olive oil along with Snow Capped Lard in my Black Iron Cast Iron Pan. (Love that pan!!).   REALLY does a nice job but not great for dieters. Wonderful in Sea Best Butterfly Shrimp!!  Restaurant quality.
           I have Tilapia for breakfast 3 or 4 times a week. On a Low Carb diet.r 20 minutes on a low heat then that gives time for my Westpac Asparagus Stir Fry Veggies to cook in som

Excellent idea.  I put salt and pepper in the flour, not on the fish itself.  I sprinkled the fish with TONY'S seasoning (spicy flavor).  I love the thin very crispy coating.  This recipe would work well with any thin fish fillets.  The finished product actually does look like the picture.

Just me and wife and this is always great.  I mix Tony's Cajun seasoning in the flour. Gives it a little spicy flavor. It's so quick and simple. I pair it with roasted vegetables coated in a little olive oil and parmasian cheese. Happy wife !

Maybe I just don't like tilapia. It tastes a lot like catfish to me. How can I mellow the taste?

This was my first time cooking tilapia, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was as easy as could be, but needed a little more seasoning for my tastes.  The beauty of a recipe like this is the ease of adjusting the recipe to suit you.  I'll definitely be making it again!

I added some lemon pepper seasoning to the flour and just added less salt to the fish itself. It came out great!! Used extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) , which didn't burn (yayy)!! Will definitely make this again. Super Easy!!!

Wow, this was delicious!  I added garlic and crushed red pepper because I love the flavor.  I did 2 1/2 minutes per side and paired it with an arugula, avocado and scallion salad with Litehouse, Thai Peanut salad dressing. Just divine. I see myself eating this once a week. Thank you for sharing!

The Tilapia turned out perfectly. Needed a basic recipe for lunch and this recipe was not at all hard. I normally bake fish, however have not had it with batter before. Will definitely consider making this again in the future instead of baking. I think it turned out far better this way.

Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was my first time cooking Talapia and it came out amazing! I seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon pepper, before coating in flour and searing in olive oil and fresh garlic. I also used salted butter, since I didn't have unsalted. It came out great! My husband can't wait until I make it again!

Loved this recipe!! The tilapia turned out great. The only adjustment that I did was add a little bit of lemon pepper to the fish while it was cooking.

Great recipe. I followed a few others' suggestions such as add garlic salt, red pepper, paprika. Came out PERFECT. I'm a big fan of trying new recipes and making them mine..but this was amazing and looked like it came from a restaurant.  I added sauteed kale with grilled onion and a dash of garlic powder and ginger poder, oven baked rice and garlic bread.

Great directions for pan frying tilapia! I added about 2 tsp fish seasoning packet to mine (dill/lemongrass) that I had on hand and pan fried in 4 tbsp butter instead of oil. It turned out incredibly flavorful and rich with an excellent crust and the light seasoning added a little zest. It came together so quick with streamed veggies, side salads w/ raspberry vinaigrette and biscuits. 20 minutes with prep and cook!

Yeah, this recipe is awesome!! Such a short cook time, and the fish turns out perfectly white and flaky. I will be using canola oil next time, though-whenever I use olive oil on a higher heat, I end up smoking up the kitchen! The fish does have a little bit of a plain taste, though, so I think I'll try mixing in some Cajun seasoning with the flour. Dipping the fish in ketchup is good, too. :) This will be my go-to recipe for tilapia.

The tilapia cooked very easily and this was ready in minutes. I put far too much pepper on but my parents said it was great. I'll most likely do it again to see if I can perfect the cooking time etc.

I've made this a few times. I followed another reviewer's suggestions and added seasoning to the flour. I used Chef Paul's Redfish magic since that was the only fish seasoning I had. That was the only part of the recipe I changed. He loves this recipe and it is so simple to make!

This was delicious!  I did add Penzey's Northwoods Seasoning to my flour for extra flavor.  I also used lemon pepper instead of regular pepper.  At the end, I brushed butter on one side, then flipped it in the pan and brushed the other side before removing.  Yummy!

I love Tilapia, it is the only fish I eat so I am so glad to get another recipe to add to my recipe book. 
My fish was tasty and crispy(which I loved).
I only added garlic powder and a couple of my favorite fish spices in the flour mixture to coat my fish. 
I am going to make this again!

I have made it several times. Both the kids and adults love this recipe. I added Old Bay Seasoning as suggested in the reviews. I think it really brought out the taste. Kept the butter since my son needs the extra calories anyway, and required by his dietician. It really is a fast weekday meal.

It definitely needs something to make it more flavorful. It's a pretty plain recipe. I've had much better simple home-cooked tilapia.

I used lemon pepper instead of salt & pepper.  I also squeezed lemon juice on the fillets after I flipped them.  The whole family loved it and keeps asking for more.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I did not change but added spices like parsley, minced dried onio, garlic powder, and lime juice to the fish. I let it marinate for about an hour and then followed the recipe to the T. Delicious!!! Thank you for sharing !

This is such an easy recipe! I added some garlic powder and citrus-herb seasoning to the flour, and it was delicious. The little bit of flour makes the perfect carmelized crust.

Best tilapia recipe I've tried so far, and that says a lot because I'm not a huge fan of fish. I used lemon pepper seasoning instead of plain pepper to give it  little extra flavor. Turned out moist and the batter was very good. Quick and easy to throw together. Also easy clean up. I think next time I'll get creative and add in some other seasonings. I don't cook fish much but when I do, I don't think I'll be cooking up tilapia in any other way except this. Thanks for sharing.

Very good when I added more seasoning.  I personally need a bit more than just salt and pepper when it comes to fish.  I either use dry Ranch dressing powder, old bay seasoning, dried or fresh dill, lemon pepper, etc. sprinkled on before the flour.  I also add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. salt to the flour.  I avoid the animal fat of butter by just using canola or grapeseed oil.

Literally one of the BEST tilapia recipes ever. And I can NOT believe how easy it was. I had dinner cooked in 10 minutes. This is the first review I've ever written after trying probably 100 recipes on this site. But this was amazingly good and simple. The crunch was perfect and my husband is a huge fan as well. My new go-to tilapia recipe.

I made this tonight. only change I made was to use blackening seasoning and a little bit of cumin instead of salt and pepper. It was delicious. It was quick and a nice change from my normal lemon/garlic tilapia recipe.

I've made this twice now and we love it! It is so simple and delicious, I'm still a novice at cooking so if I can do it anyone can. I did use more oil than the recipe said due to making 4 pieces total but other than that kept it the same. As someone mentioned before the way to tell when it's ready to be put in the oil is by throwing some flour into the oil and if it sizzles it's ready.

Excellent! So easy to make and delicious. This was my first time preparing talapia.  My husband wasn't sure that he wanted to try it but ended up eating two helpings. I prepared it exactly according to directions without any changes. Will definitely be fixing this again!

Delicious!  I added some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika along with a tiny bit of salt and lots of black pepper!  I also added the same ingredients to the flour.  Seared in pan with olive oil for 3 1/2 minutes per side.  I didn't use any butter.  This was so YUMMY!

I added a little more spice than just salt and pepper. I also used a little paprika in the flour. You can definitely make this your own. I will make this again for sure. My kids liked it and they're very picky eaters.

Great recipe. I followed suggestions and sprinkled lemon pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and crushed bay leaves on each piece. Then dipped in flour and pan seared.  Easy and a winner! Will be making this again.

Loved it!  I'm from New Orleans so I thawed my fish in a "pink" Tabasco bath to take away that fishy taste. Also, I added Tony's to the flour and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Delish! Even my dog was drooling.

I have been cooking tilapia all wrong.  This is the basic and perfect method.  The fish was cooked correctly, flaky and the light crust was delicious.  Thank you, Applechef.

I am not a big fan of fish.  I am REALLY not a fan of white fish but this recipe was wonderful!!!  I used Orange Roughy bc my grocery did not have tilapia, I used Avocado oil in place of olive oil and had to cook the fish twice as long bc my fillets were twice as big but otherwise I followed the recipe to the T and it was delicious!!!

Amazing.
Not to many steps not messy and cooks fast.  Looked like the picture.  Tasted great I like the substitution of regular oil with olive oil.  Made it for my girlfriend and family they loved it.  I also added some nature's seasonings . I don't think you could go wrong with this dish . I will say make sure you don't over Cook the fish.. but this was delicious and very moist not dried out full of flavor and I can't wait to make it again!

Quick, easy and delicious. Based on some previous reviews, I added some blackened old bay in addition to the salt and pepper. Looking forward to making this again.

My end result didn't look nice and golden like the picture. It seems that 4 minutes was too long in my cast iron skillet on medium high heat (fish burned). Taste-wise, I found it just ok even adding a few of the recommended seasonings from other reviews. I do think that the fish would've been bland had I only used salt and pepper according to review.

I loved this recipe. It was divine.  I think it was good just like it was.   Mine didn't come out as blackened as the picture but it was just enough crisp and I used salted margarine instead of unsalted butter.  I just didn't salt the fish when I put the pepper on.   It still was good. I am happy how it came out and I am mot even the cooking type.

Absolutely wonderful.  Instead of just using melted butter and brushing over, I used browned butter, kicks it up a notch.  There is nothing like browned butter on fish!

Excellent dish!  Pan frying in butter is a must.  Our variation is a little different.  Wash, gently press both sides with Club House, La Grille "Spicy Pepper Medley". We do not coat with flour... but.. simply pan fry on medium high for about 4-5 minutes each side (do not over cook.. think of shrimp cooking time) and server hot on a bed of rice.   OH ! La la... enjoy. GPG  PS: if you want to coat think of a bread crumb or cracker mixture.  You will need to increase the heat and cooking time to compensate for the coating.

This was pretty good.  Very easy to make.  I used lemon-pepper seasoning instead of the salt and pepper and it was delicious.

Tilapia is too strong for me so I used pollack instead. I also used a homemade creole seasoning in place of plain salt & pepper. I did follow the directions/technique & my fish came out perfect! Absolutely loved it!

I seasoned with salt, pepper, celery salt, and onion powder and let the tilapia cook in the butter for a minute at the end. Yum!

Thanks, AppleChef, for posting this method. I used it on Swai fillets. I used the "Blackened Seasoning" from this site to season them before flouring. They needed 5 minutes on each side (I was using timer on my iPhone), but I had my electric "burner" just at the first mark past Medium, so not quite at the "Medium-High" setting. Anyways, the Swai turned out great. Try it.

My family loved this recipe. I tweaked it a little. One batch I used lemon pepper and the other cayenne pepper. Both were very good. This is truly one of my new favorites.

Delicious! Now a Family Favorite! We have made this several times. My 12-year old has made it the last 2 times. We add fresh lemon juice and garlic to our recipe. I like to serve it with a creamy, homemade garlic pasta and buttery, garlic bread.

Fantastic!  I did not use extra spices, but I was generous with sea salt and pepper before lightly flouring the fish.  Followed exactly to recipe and it was a gorgeous presentation and tasted amazing.

I love tilapia, but do not cook fish hardly ever! If you haven't tried "Slap Ya Mamma" seasoning....you really should! It gives the tilapia a great flavor! The key to any recipe is trial and error, make it your own and never add too much salt to anything! Cheers!! :)

Very good recipe. I added Emeril's Essence as the spice all over the fish before dusting it with the flour. I used it sparingly, but next time will be a bit more aggressive with the spices to give it a tad more flavor. This recipe is going into the 'cook often' section of my recipes.

Excellent way to prepare a mild fish. I used grouper and it was wonderful. Next time, I will probably omit the brush of butter as I felt like that was just more than it needed.

Fast, easy, and tasty way to prepare fish. I'll use this method again. Of course you can season it however you want. I used a season salt and black pepper on the fish. Instead of melting the butter and brushing on, I just put it in the pan toward the end of the cooking time and let the butter get on both sides. My son didn't like the crunchy edges, but that was my favorite part.

I used citrus pepper seasoning for a little added 'something' instead of just pepper and salt. Turned out great with just the right amount of crispness! Thank you!

This dish cooked perfectly, and I'm a very novice chef. Instead of plain old salt and pepper, pick a few favorite spices and go to town! The fish turned out perfectly, and looked amazing!

This is so delicious for such a simple recipe! I made this when I didn't feel like spending a lot of time in the kitchen.  Served with some couscous and steamed broccoli and it turned out like I'd slaved for a long time!  Even got rave reviews from my husband - who generally likes things heavily spiced. This recipe was perfect with just the basics!

I have never enjoyed tilapia until I tried this recipe. Very tasty! It had a simple but yummy crust that made it seem like I actually knew how to cook fish :-) .

I was looking for a way to prepare fish where I will eat it.  I'm not much of a seafood lover.  This recipe is awesome!  Definately a keeper!

Oh my!  This was super quick, and tasted fantastic.  My husband raved, and it only took 5 minutes.  I like to use Bragg's seasoning mix, which I added to the coating.  A keeper, and easy way to add more fish to our diet without having to use the bbq.

This recipe is great for a simple and fast way to make tilapia on the stove.  I followed the directions exactly and it all turned out great. I've also used this recipe when making Swai fish and it works just as well.

Recipe was quick and simple, but needed a bit more flavor.  Will probably try it again, but adding some additional spices to the seasoning (either on the fish directly or else in the flour).  I'm thinking along the lines of garlic powder, onion powder, maybe just a little red pepper....

This was a great recipe to use as a base on how to pan sear the fish. It did lack taste or something to give it a kick. I poured some lemon juice and paprika on the Tilapia and it really made a difference!!
Delishhhhh!!

This was extremely easy and amazingly delicious. The fillets were light and satisfying on the stomach and the flavour was delicately balanced. I substituted rice flour for the all-purpose flour, lemon juice instead of butter, and added just a touch of paprika, garlic powder, and thyme to the flour mixture.

This was very good!  I was looking for a different way to cook the fish, Pan-Searing was different.  The flavor is very good, I need to find out how to make it where it does not fall apart, my only issue.  I will definitely make this again to perfect that part!

This reminded me of how my Nana made perch from, the Poconos, when I visited. I did however use cayenne to season the tilapia as well as salt, pepper and garlic powder. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! I added a zesty lemon seasoning, Old Bay, and some garlic pepper to the flour. I fried it in a cast iron skillet in a mixture of 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Keeper!

Super easy! We've used this recipe with several types of white fish and it's always good.  Like alot of the other people I added some extra spices (garlic salt, papricka, etc.....I change it up each time I make it.) Also like others I have found the butter totally unneeded.

Quick and easy.  So good.  I added a little fish and seafood seasoning too.  Yum!
