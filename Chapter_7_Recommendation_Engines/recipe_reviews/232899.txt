Comes out perfect every time but I found that if you use a pan that can allow you to fill it with water just below the top of your cups the surface will come out better and very smooth but it does seem to cripple the cook time. :-)

Came out very well despite my tweaks.  I only had 3 eggs so cut back the condensed milk and water. Also didn't have custard cups to,used oven safe cereal bowls.  I ended cooking the flans for about 60 min. because of their size and topped with a sugar coated sliced whole strawberry. Beautiful. Was so proud to show them off and try I forgot to take photo before they were eaten.
