This is a very good recipe.  I did make some changes to suit my family's tastes.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it would probably be too salty for us, so I replaced garlic salt with garlic powder, and replaced season salt with Mrs.Dash Table blend.  If one is worried about the oil, I'm sure it would turn out perfectly with Enova oil also.  I replaced the pretzel nuggets with goldfish, and kept the slim pretzels called for in the recipe, then omitted the pound of mixed nuts and just stuck with peanuts.  I put the dry stuff in a clean paper bag, closed the top, and shook it to mix them up before putting it in the cooking dishes.  Then, when it was done cooking, I returned it to the bag and shook it again, to even out the flavors of the two pans.

I must have gotten sidetracked somewhere.  I was looking for healthy kids snacks.  2 cups of veg oil..over 50 g of fat..over 1600 mg of sodium..you must be kidding.

I CAN NOT BELIEVE MY EYES!  THIS IS A SLIGHT TAKE OFF OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S FAMOUS (IN TOLEDO, OHIO) RECIPE. I'VE YET TO HAVE HEARD THIS REFERRED TO AS NUTS AND BOLTS EXCEPT IN OUR FAMILY! FABULOUS TASTING, BUT IN THE 50s BUTTER WAS USED INSTEAD OF VEG OIL.  THE INGREDIENTS INCLUDED SPANISH PEANUTS (A MUST) CHEERIOS, AND ONION SALT INSTEAD OF SEASONING SALT.  THE ENTIRE BATCH WAS BAKED IN A HUGE ROASTER COVERED FOR AN HOUR (STIR EVERY HALF) AND UNCOVERED FOR AN HOUR (STIR EVERY HALF).  YUM!!!

I was so excited to find this recipe.  My husband has always raved about his grandma's Nuts and Bolts and no on e had the recipe.  She was from Northern Wisconsin - it must be a midwestern thing!  I skimped a little on the season salt because I was afraid of it being too salty, but he said it was 99% her recipe just needed more salt.  I also subbed 1 stick fo melted butter for the oil.  Thanks for posting!

this is an OK recipe the one thing to keep in mind is that most schools ar enow "nut free" and this one is not so good for that purpose.

This recipe was too salty for me! 
It could be nice with a few changes, but it gave me a few ideas, so i think it deserves about 3 stars.

My Mama made this many years ago (in the 50's & 60's) as a treat, usually at christmas time.  No pretzel bits at the time but all the rest seems to be how I remember it, thanks for renewing a memory, & also for a very nice recipe....yummmmy

This was swimming in oil!  I had to drain it in a strainer and line the bowl with paper towels to soak up the oil.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and it was still too salty.  Maybe 1/2 the oil and salt would work better and be a lot healthier.

Good starter recipe, I made my own adjustments to make it lower in salt and a little healthier.

This was an excellent starter recipe for me, however, I did tweak it to suit my taste. I used unsalted butter instead of oil, and only used half the recommended amount. I didn't have seasoning salt, so I just used garlic powder, onion powder, celery seed, and some added salt. I also only used pretzel sticks and Shreddies since those are my favourites and I always pick them out first. I will be using my tweaked recipe again!

Great recipie! The seasoning is great - suits our families tastes.  I did use a little less oil then called for... and think that using butter (as a previous reviewer mentioned) might be something to try!

Only thing I omitted was the nuts, as I didn't want any visitors to have to worry about allergies.

I use butter instead of the oil. DELICIOUS. A Christmas favorite for my children and grandchildren. I’m thrilled to see it called Nuts and Bolts as we do. I’ve been making this since 1975, long before it was marketed in bags. There’s no comparison to this original.
