We love this!! After making many times, I have a few adjustments-- we add more beans (usually some kidney), use only 1 1/2 jalapenos, and use 1/2 the olive oil.  Paired with some low-fat tortilla chips, this salad is always a hit.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party to serve as one of the salads, and haven't stopped making it since.
I had a neighbor invite us to a last minute pool party and asked if I could bring a munchie. With a half a bowl of leftover Mexican Salad and some tortilla chips this was a huge hit at the party!!
I cannot strongly urge enough however to make this ahead of time, as the longer it sits the better it tastes.
I also have been making this with the new Enova Oil and Agave Nector ( for diabetics), I have used canned corn instead and it is still an awesome flavored side dish or dip.  You can't mess this recipe up, just alter it to your tastes.
This is now a summertime staple at our home!(nah- probably all year round)
Keep up the great recipes Pam!

This is a nice variation on salsa and chips.  Mix it vigorously to slightly mash the beans and make the dip stick together better.  I'm looking forward to serving this during the summer.

This was very good. I went lighter on the onion--I used half a shallot and one green onion. Plus, I used fresh, raw corn and about 1/4 cup cilantro. This had a nice, mellow flavor, and I didn't find it too spicy at all. Next time, I'll add garlic and maybe a bit of cumin.

I omitted the peppers for the kids. It was healthy and tasted OK, but didn't knock my socks off.

The recipe as is, I rated 3 stars as I found the honey made it too sweet and I was looking for more of an herb and kick flavour.

To change it up this is what I do. In small saucepan combine one cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 2-3 dashes each of garlic or table salt, and pepper.  Gently boil for 5 minutes, remove from heat and set aside to cool.

Drain and rinse one can each of black beans, chick peas and niblet corn and add to a very large mixing bowl. Finely dice one cup each of celery, red pepper, green pepper, sweet onion and cauliflower (yes cauliflower).  Add to bowl.

Pour the cooled brine all over your canned and diced veggies and mix thoroughly.  Add 2-3 dashes garlic powder and dried basil (or Italian seasoning), and  mix again.  Refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight for best results.

Serve as a salad, or as an appetizer together with Tostito multi-grain scoops.  It makes a lot but keeps for up to a week in the refrigerator.  A real crowd pleaser any time of the year!

Tip:  I have experimented with different vinegars such as cider, red wine and balsamic, but the 'apple cider' wins hands down.  The cauliflower may not appeal to some but if finely diced, you don't even know it's there and gives it a nice crunch.

This was good, rated a 4 rather than a 5 because it's the first corn salad I've made and want to try other recipes out there.  Not as good as some I've had at restruants, but that's to be expected.

Very easy and healthy.  It's one of those last minute tasty meals that your family will love. I even added some cheese and salsa for an additional kick.

Made this many times and after following recipe this is what I do. You can use black beans or kidney beans. I use can corn. I put all 3 cans in the fridge the night before so they are cold. I use whatever pepper I have on hand whether it’s green or red. One jalapeño for I don’t love the spice. Minimal oil is needed. 4 Tablespoonfuls of lime juice. Same amount of onion is fine. And salt and pepper to taste. Same amount of honey is fine too. Cilantro add more if you like it. Keep in fridge for a few hours to meld flavors together. Stir maybe once an hour. Eat with tortilla chips. I love it. Make it every few months. It’s easy, delicious, and you don’t have to feel guilty for eating a lot.

I forgot the honey and it was very good.  I might try it again with mango.
I've had it with some freshly grated parmesan cheese on it and it was really good but then again I love anything with cheese on it.

I made it having the jalapeños as a side.  Big hit with my family!  Great flavor!  Made it the day before so the flavors could marry.  We will certainly enjoy again!

A little on the bland side. Followed the instructions and salad was bland. I will make this again, however, I will look at spicing it up as it is lacking something. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times for a group when we have tacos.  It's easy to a make and if there are leftovers, I like to add them to a tossed salad.

I am very impressed at the ease of this recipe. I also added red and orange small sweet bell peppers, and a tad of pure orange juice, it added a nice tang. I also added lime zest and it took it over the top which is a good thing. Nice for a warm summer day.

Took this to a football playoff watching party.  Host served turkey chili.  We ended up mixing this salad in our bowls with the chili....awesome!  By request I will be bringing again for super bowl Sunday.  Go Broncos!
