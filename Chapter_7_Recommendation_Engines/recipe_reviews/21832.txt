This recipe was just what I was looking for. I had to change a few things due to lack of some ingredients. Here is what I did: instead of cream of celery soup, I used cream of mushroom and added diced celery. I used 1/2 a can of peas, minced onion. Also, after I drained the tuna, I sprinkled onion powder and black pepper on it to let some flavor soak in before I used it. When I added all of the ingriendents to the pot, I sprinkled more onion powder and black pepper to the mix and used about a 1/4 cup of milk. The flavor was wonderful!!!!

I used half cream of celery and half cream of mushroom, because I couldn't decide which to use.  I didn't use the red pepper at all, and added some garlic powder to it.  I felt like there could have been more tuna, next time will use 1 1/2 or 2 cans.  I also sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese and crushed Ritz crackers on top and baked for a while...will definitely try again!

This was a good recipe.  However, mine did not have a lot of liquid - so I added 1 cup of milk.  It was still not "stew" consistency - so I spread half in a baking dish, sprinkled one cup shredded cheese(I used mozzarella), covered with the other half, then sprinkled with one sleeve of crushed cracked-pepper flavored Ritz crackers.  I then drizzeled with 1/4 c. butter and baked for 20 minutes.  If you want to follow the original recipe and do not like crunchy veggies - I would recommend lightly sauteing the onion and pepper first.

This recipe was so tasty,quick and easy to make  that my children are asking for more before they're done! I made the peas a side dish and added four sliced carrots to the stew. This dish is great for when you are in a hurry and have six or more hungry mouths to feed!

For as simple as it is, this recipe is quite tasty.  I did saute the onion and bell pepper in about a tablespoon of butter, then added the tuna and soup.  Since I was using frozen peas, I added those to the boiling water for the noodles to cook.  Was a good, filling meal.

I doubled the amount of noodles for a more pasta-like dish instead of stew and this turned out good, onion definitely helped balance out very celery flavored dish. I also added a dash of garlic powder and oregano with a few drops of mustard.

Yummy and easy.  I especially enjoyed the crunchiness of the bell peppers - they added a nice dimension to this easy recipe.

Good, but ordinary and not that interesting to look at or taste...but I overcooked the noodles too and that didn't help.  It just didn't have much punch to it...

I forgot to put the peas in this.  It was not outstanding, but it was easy to make and tasted okay enough to eat.  It needed a lot of salt and pepper to give it flavor.

This is exactly like I thought it would be! It's tasty and a way to dress up tuna, but I had to make some substitutions and work with what I had on hand.

I used cream of chicken soup and added some celery seed, and I used chopped baby carrots instead of peas- aside from that I followed the recipe. I'll make this again but I won't add the whole can of soup; maybe 3/4 , and I added a bit of milk at the end. It did seem like it needed more tuna... and I also cooked the onions/pepper/carrots in the pot for about 10 minutes to soften them a bit. It was a very good lunch on a wintery Sunday afternoon! Thanks!
