Coffee lovers loved it - Chocolate lovers preferred more chocolate.  If you want more chocolate, try substituting chocolate milk mix or syrup - something designed to dissolve in cold liquids.  We did 4 shakes & 2 people (1 man & 1 woman) could not finish.  Easy, prepared with items already in cupboard, and makes enough to be dessert.  Biggest complaint - TOO THIN.  Add less milk & you'll be fine.

I was making lunch and came to Allrecipes because I had a craving for a milkshake. I came across this one, and added a variation to it. I ommitted the coffee and used chocolate chunk ice cream instead of vanilla. It was thick, rich and flavorful! Thanks Pinky!

MMMMMMMM!!!!!!! I love this!!! I tweaked it a little to suit my low-fat likings. I made this recipe with 1 cup frozen lowfat yogurt and 1/2 cup of lowfat milk, plus the vanilla, coffee, and cocoa. IT was amazing!!! THANKS A MILLION PINKY!

Very good!  I dissolved the coffee in the milk before adding it to the ice cream and had no problem with it being powdery.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I'm always craving frappacinos at the local coffee shops. This was very easy and satisfying. And it saved me about 7 dollars because it's expsensive to buy. It made 2 tall glasses! The only thing I did different from the recipe was used french vanilla instant coffee and white chocolate cocoa mix. I also added 1 cup of ice. Perfect! Will defnitely make again!

Yum!  A lot like a Frappucino or something like that.  I invented something similar before I ever saw this recipe, without the hot cocoa and with less ice cream.  My suggestion might be to use a bit less ice cream and more milk, partly for health reasons.  A keeper!

Really good!  The coffee flavor was a bit overpowering so I added more hot cocoa mix than the recipe called for.  Excellent flavors.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Sooo so strong...sooo so foul. I, the girl who can stomach nearly anything and everything, could not force myself to finish this. There was far too much coffee in this.

It's good.  The initial taste is very "powdery", but it tastes better the more you drink.  But my husband and I like it a lot.

The perfect iced mocha if you ask me. Try using 1 cup whipped cream to substitute the ice cream and pour over shaved ice. It also makes a very yummy treat!

I am 24yr veteran chef and would like to have the originating chef revise the ingredients to read 1 tablespoon instant powder coffee not granules. The grains will not blend well in different types of blenders whereas the instant powder has already been blended -in a sense -so thats where the grains come to be a "chunky" or "over-bearing" flavor. The recipe is very tasty and deserves a second chance with the nay-sayers.

This was awesome!  I used Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate mix, and the new Starbucks instant coffee.  I didn't measure exact amounts, but I think I used closer to 1/2 TBSP of the instant coffee.  I also added in some chocolate syrup.  Will make again for sure.

This is a coffee lovers dream! LOVE IT! After reading other reviews I decided to warm a little of the milk and dissolve the coffee granules. Cooled the milk then followed directions as written. I used skim milk,low fat ice cream and french vanilla flavor cocoa mix and it was delish. Oh, and i added a squirt of nestle chocolate syrup just for fun. This will be a regular weekend treat in my house.

I used coffee ice cream and skipped the hot chocolate. Very strong flavor. Needs something to make it thicker though. Maybe whipped cream or something.

Good, but not great. Would be better made with chocolate syrup and if I had cut the milk back a 1/4 c. or so. Nice pick-me up in the middle of the day. I'll try this with chocolate ice cream next time.

I loved the entire taste it gives you. Since it's summer, cold is fine. A hot cup of coffee isn't the same anymore. So I went and looked up a milkshake recipe and found my fix for coffee and the heat. Very good recipe. ;D

This was sooo good - creamy and delicious. I did dissolve the coffee granules in a bit of hot water and I was glad I did so.

This is very good and refreshing.  Being diabetic I changed this a little, by subing sugar free icecream, sugar free hot coco mix, lowfat milk. But it turned out great! Very good thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good - very refreshing! I would recommend dissolving the chocolate mix and the instant coffee before you blend. If you're looking for something extra special, it tastes great if you add a splash (or to preference) of flavored coffee creamer!
