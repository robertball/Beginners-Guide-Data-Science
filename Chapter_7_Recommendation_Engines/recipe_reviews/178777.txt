So simple and so GOOD. We all liked these. I rolled them up jelly roll style and sliced in half. Make sure you seal all the seams or your cheese will melt out. Served with mustard ontop. YUMMY. I made two tubes of crescent rolls. Will make these often!!!!

My hubby really liked this.  I would have liked it better if the crust had stayed more crispy.  It tended to be soggy after only a few minutes out of the oven.  It was however, quick and easy to make

I rolled it and used provolone cheese (personal preference). Itâ€™s a very easy way to make a simple ham and cheese look classy.
