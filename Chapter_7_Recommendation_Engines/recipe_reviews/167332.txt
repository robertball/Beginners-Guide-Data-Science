I like Amaretto sours so I decided to give this a try, and I was not disappointed.  This may just be my new favorite drink.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! It's difficult to find sour mix where I live, so I used lemon lime soda instead and it was great.

So refreshing!  I used to make Amaretto Sours from a recipe out of a bartenders guide that didn't include the O.J. but this version is much better and I'll be using it from now on.  Thanks!

My favorite drink; I just use make everything measure up to 2 ounces each, and add marachino cherries to the bottom of the glass; which soak up the flavors :o)

Super Awesome!! I LOVE amaretto sours, and now I love this one too (they're just a tiny bit different). I just did equal parts amaretto, sour mix and oj. Easy to remember and easy goin' down!

Yum - this is my favorite drink and it was very smooth going down.  I like that it is mild on the amaretto, but strong enough to still taste it.  Thanks CookinBug for sharing your recipe.  Lucky for me, I still have all three ingredients left!

This is delicious, but where I come from, this is called an amaretto stone sour. An amaretto sour has no oj. Both ways are yummy!
