This was a good pizza and I love thick dough, but there is one very important ingredient missing in the dough, which I discovered only after cooking it. The salt! The dough tasted very flat without it, as does any bread without a pinch of salt. Other than that, what's not to love about deep dish pizza?

This was one of the best pizza crusts I've ever made, probably because of all the oil, but it was so thick just like I like it.  Baking time was only about 15 or 20 minutes max for me, and it was done.  Yummy recipe, and I'll make it again for sure.

Great, thick crust. I added spices to taste. I used my bread machine to mix and knead.  When ready for baking, I prebaked at 450 for 10 minutes with nothing on it. Then added the sauce and toppings and baked until golden, which in my oven was about 20-25 minues. Our local pizza is as thin as paper and this thick crust is a welcome change from that. Thanks Julianna19.

I am very excited about this recipe.  This tastes very similar to the Chicago deep dish pizza I fell in love with in Chicago.  I don't have a standing mixer and mixed it all with a wooden spoon and then kneading, later and it turned out fine.  I just mixed it with a wooden spoon until it looked very throughly mixed (10 minutes would have required more muscles than I have--I mixed it significantly less) and then kneaded it for about 5 minutes.  I added the tablespoon of salt, as recommended by others and am SO glad I did--it doesn't taste salty at all--just normal.  Also, I HEAVILY greased my casserole dish with margerine--I think that gives the crust the buttery taste I grew to love from Giordanos and Pizzeria Uno.  The crust is really really thick--I think I will try spreading it into larger pans next time, or dividing the dough into 3, instead of into 2 pizza crusts.  Also, something I may try is using melted butter or margarine in place of the oil.  I remember the crusts from my favorite restaurants having a more buttery taste.  But this recipe, with the added 1T salt, does turn out a yummy crust.  I also squashed a bunch of whole tomatoes by hand--make sure you drain them really well, otherwise it will be soupy.  Great recipe!  Thanks for satisfying a pregnant woman's cravings!

I added salt to the pizza dough while I was mixing it to give more flavor. The crust rose too much while baking. I might try it again with either a bigger pan or less dough.

This was a really great crust. I did have to add more flour during the last mixing cycle. I just added a tablespoon at a time until it reached a more cohesive unit. I would also recommend adding at least a tablespoon of salt. If that sounds like a lot remember this makes two crusts. 
Also, the next time I make this crust I am going to add basil and oregano to
the dough while it is mixing. 

Very good dough.

We found the crust very very wet so had to add a bunch more flour. It was very difficult to handle. Finally got that in and changed the inside completely to pizza sauce, feta, mozzerella, mushrooms,pineapple and pepperoni topped with parmesian cheese and it was awesome. So I guess I am just rating the crust here...and I would rate it a three only cause it did taste nice with the addition of salt but way fussy.

Dough is much too sticky to work with and the cooking time is way off. I will have to do a lot of adjusting to this recipe next time I try it.

Very good, but the dough rose a LOT.  It turned out extremely thick.

The recipe was easy to follow but the crust was very thick and with not much flavor (my hubbie exclaimed when he saw it "its pizza with a loaf of bread attached to it". That about sums it up.

This was relly good! I used Diced tomatos with Basil Garlic and Oregano instead of Plum tomatos.  I also added sausage!  Loved every bite!

I made the crust only.  As others have said a little sauce is needed.  I didn't have the 9" round Pans so I improvised.  Make sure that you spread the crust out as it can get very deep!
