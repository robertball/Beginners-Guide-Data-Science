Without a grill, I wrapped the beets in foil, and baked in a 350 oven for about 45 minutes.  Wonderful!

I wanted to use both the beets and the greens so I changed it up a bit. I took the raw unpeeled beets and boiled them for a few minutes until tender crisp stage. Let them cool, then peeled and sliced them. Added them to the marinade and omitted the garlic ( I felt like they would overpower the earthy sweet flavor). Grilled them directly on grill for a few minutes on each side.For the greens,  I carmelized some red onion and thick cut bacon in a little olive oil with a bit of turbinado sugar and splash of balsamic, then sauteed the greens for just a few minutes until tender and bright green. Served the grilled beets on top of the greens. The flavors were bright and simple!

The beets were OK, but a little dry.  Also, I questioned putting the marinade and the beets in aluminum foil.  I've always heard that vinegar and aluminum interact negatively.  I also questioned whether the beets should have been marinated AFTER the grilling.  The raw beets were hard to handle, and I wonder if the flavor wouldn't have been more intense with marinating after the cooking.

This was a really wonderful dish, and a welcome addition to any bbq dinner. I bought some golden beets (deep yellow flesh) at a local farmers' market, and was looking for a way to prepare them on the grill. I peeled the beets, which the recipe doesn't specify, and I used thyme, marjoram & savory in place of herbes de provence, and added salt and pepper. The balsamic vinegar complements the beets very well. I will definitely make this again--thanks!

This is a great recipe!  The only change I made was to boil the beets in a big pot of water first until tender (I then skinned and sliced them).  I had about 5 beets I was working with and didn't want to be relying solely on the grill to get all the slices cooked through.  However, the taste is wonderful, even though I only had fresh rosemary and had to use dried herbs for the rest.  I cut the leftover slices into chunks today and threw them in the pasta/veggie salad I already had and they added a wonderful flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Yum, these were a great new way to make beets! Next time I'd grill them a little longer though, since mine were still a little firm. Also, the recipe doesn't specify to peel the beets, but I did it anyway because I can never seem to get them clean enough by scrubbing. Oh, and don't use a wood cutting board or it will end up pink!

I made this for the first time, and my husband and I both enjoyed it quite a bit.  I prepared the recipe as it was given, except for two little changes.  Instead of place the beets directly on the grill, (ours were smallish and we were afraid they'd fall through the grate) we put them in our grill wok.  That worked great.  I also marinated longer than called for, but I wouldn't do that again.  Usually I prefer more flavor but the herbs and vinegar overpowered the beet flavor.  I suppose that could be good if someone didn't care for the taste of beets!  I like them however.  We thought this was a yummy recipe and I'll make it again!

It was good, but prefer other recipes.  It was not as flavorful as I expected.  I think it's a good recipe to get a basic idea of what to do w/ beets.

Wonderful recipe, thank you! I love beets and try and grill everything I can. The herb mixture was an unexpected yet perfect flavor accompaniment to the earthiness of the beets. I did add more garlic, we love it. Also, I added a bit of olive oil to aid the grilling process.

I made this as an accompiniement for another recipe and they came out pretty good although a little dry because I didn't slice the beets thin enough and I think I should have marinated them overnight, but otherwise it's a great simple recipe and a new way to cook beets for me.

This is a wonderful dish for a barbecue or with a fancy dinner - you can serve it with just about anything but breakfast.

We don't eat fresh beets all that often but about once a month I'll fix this dish and my husband loves it.  I don't mess with the original recipe, just make it up as it's written.  It tastes just as good (or even better) the next day if you have any leftovers at all!

Wonderful easy recipe with great flavor. I sealed the foil pcak adn baked on low on the grill for about 45 minute. Not dry at all, began to get some carmelization that the finally direct grillin perfected.  Guests LOVED this!

The recipe said to grill the beets on high.  I found this was too hot as my beets burned in the foil regardless of turning them.  I will try again at a lower temp for longer or in the oven as some have suggested.

Came out great!  I ended up baking in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes and used dried thyme and fresh rosemary.  The tartness of the balsamic vineger was balanced by the sweet beets

Not really what I expected - like pickled beets which are usually served cold. I wouldn't make it again, but if you like pickled beets they were OK. The herbs added flavor and the beets were sweet.

I guess I was expecting something more exciting- flavor was like any beet recipe.  I didn't grill but cooked in the oven - which may be the big difference - will try again grilled.  Then I will revisit the review.

Tried this recipe this evening on the grill an really liked it.  I trimmed the ends of the beets and boiled them in water for a couple of minutes.  When cool, I sliced them and put them on the aluminum foil, along with the marinade, that I had made a couple of hours earlier.  Following 20 minutes on the grill, we laid them directly on the grill for another 5 minutes.  The flavor was very good:  glad to have a new beet recipe!

Like other reviewers I pre-cooked the beets via 10 minutes with water in the microwave. Turned out amazing and I really don't like beets as I think they generally taste like dirt! Will make again

These were very easy and tasty. Very little cleanup involved when cooking on the grill so that's a plus for me. The balsamic vinegar in these reminded me of pickles beets which I love.

I'm giving this five stars because I loved the marinade and the beets were really good once grilled.  The only mistake we made was to grill them a bit too long and they became "chewy".  Perhaps next time I will do as others have done and boil a bit and grill a little.
