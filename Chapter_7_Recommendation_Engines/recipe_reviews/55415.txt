I love this recipe. My only changes were to dip the artichoke in the egg mixture, then flour, egg mixture and bread crumbs, and I seasoned them with granulated garlic and cayenne. I also served them with lemon wedges. Great recipe but not even close to 24 servings. I only wish I'd read the review that recommended serving them with garlic butter. Next time for sure!

I've made these three times now and love them!  They are great served with garlic butter like my favorite restaurant. I've also found if you double dip them you get a thicker coating.  Grating some fresh paresan on right after they come out of the deep fryer is a must.  Thanks for the post WolfChik!

These were very tasty - I added romano cheese into the breadcrumbs. The number of servings was incorrect though. There are only 6-8 hearts in each can of artichokes. Perhaps it should be 2-4 servings instead of 24. I will definitely make these again.

These were very good. I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand so I used some Panko crumbs. I think that the Panko added a little extra crunch that everyone enjoyed. I ended up making this two nights in a row because they went over so well. I agree with the other reviewers, you only need 1 egg and 1/4 cup of milk, and halve the crumbs also. We will be having this again.

These were really yummy.  I followed another review and served it with garlic butter, excellent addition.  I also think a squirt of lemon juice would be tasty.  I ended up with way more egg/bread crumbs than needed so will decrease these by 1/2 next time.

Excellent!  This is a favorite in my family when we go to Deanie's in New Orleans, so it was great to find this recipe just like theirs.  Thanks for submitting this great recipe!

These are DEEEELICIOUS! I did 1/2 the egg/milk mixture, and seasoned that with garlic powder and seasoned salt before dipping the artichokes in. Also I didn't measure the breadcrumbs, but I know I didn't use 1-1/2 cups. I plan on serving them with a horseradish sauce, but that's only if they make it that far, lol. I seriously cannot stop 'taste-testing' these...they are soooooo good, and will be made often in my house! Thanks for sahring. :)

I made a double batch of these last night at some friends' house. (I only doubled the artichoke hearts - there was plenty of breadcrumbs & egg wash.)  YUM!  Everyone loved them, and we've agreed that we definitely have to make them again!

hmmm....not sure what I might have done wrong?  I coated these twice (milk then crumbs, then milk and crumbs again)...breading was still very thin.  The artichokes were bland....should have added some salt.  Just wasn't my favorite, but I needed something to do with my cans of artichokes, so thanks for the recipe.

I was a bit skeptical at first, but this recipe really turned out well.  I did add about a tablespoon of garlic powder and 1/2 a tablespoon of seasoned salt to the bread crumbs.  I also made a dip using ranch dressing with some chopped cilantro.  I mixed the parmesean cheese in the dip instead of sprinkling it on top.  Very yummy!  :)

The milk and the eggs can be scaled back some, I had a lot of it leftover. But the artichokes were fabulous.

These were sooo good. I added more spices due to my family's taste (I always do) and double dipped in egg mixture and flour/panko combo (didn't have enough flour.)  I served marinara sauce on the side. My family loved it.

Nice....my only change would be to find Artichoke bottoms....or just the hearts.....I used whole canned artichokes which includes some leaves....which usually are not an issue....but I found some of the leaves on the chokes to be very tough and almost wood-y.....will look for just the soft hearts next time....otherwise...these are very tasty and served w/ marinara sauce....also used whole wheat seasoned crumbs.

Very good! I used a jar of fire roasted artichokes marinated in garlic and olive oil so it had some great flavors before I even started.

I used the medium hearts and next time will use the small hearts. I dipped in the egg mixture, then seasoned flour, then the egg mixture, and then the bread crumbs. I added parm cheese to the bread crumbs. Very easy to make and very tasty. I cannot wait to make again. Thanks!

My husband and I had tried fried artichoke hearts on vacation in Monterey, CA where they are considered a Monterey specialty...they were great and I was hoping to recreate the delicacy...unfortunately, these didn't quite cut it.  Maybe I just didn't fry them long enough, but my husband (who eats everything) only ate one to appease me.

I used artichoke bottoms and they worked and tasted great. I finished this dish with freshly grated parmesan cheese and a squeez of fresh lemon juice. I will make these again!

Instead of deep frying, I flashed friend them in some olive oil then transferred them to a cookie sheet then broiled in the oven. Also served with ranch for dipping!

These were awesome. I agree, put parmesan in with the bread crumbs. Delish!

I don't keep milk on hand, so I subbed Greek yogurt with the water that comes to its top. Yum! As good as (or better than) any restaurant recipe I've had!

I love these.  I use panko crumbs and they are nice and crispy.  I like to dip them in a lemony hollandaise sauce or a spicy siraccha (sp?) mayo.  They are also good on their own with no need for any sauce.  I could eat them like popcorn...seriously.
