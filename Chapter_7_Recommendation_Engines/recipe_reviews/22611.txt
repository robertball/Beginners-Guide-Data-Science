Great, simple and easy.  I make this in a crockpot and use 3 finely grated carrots instead of the sugar.  Turns out great and freezes great.

Yes I just would like to you should definitely use almost a tsp. of sugar to help w/ the acidity of the tomatoes, and to make sure if you are using meatballs and spareribs to cook them for the full three hours in the sauce!!! Enjoy!

Great!  Easy and just like my nana's.  I froze the rest and later used it in cacciatore with peppers and onions and chili so far.

Instead of garlic I use onions. I think the garlic contrbutes to the bitterness which is why sugar is needed. I have never had to use sugar. Make sure you stir the paste constantly so it cooks. I also add I can of water which also cut down on the acidity but still keeps the sauce thick. This is my Italy born mother's recipe.

The recipe reminds me of my italian friends regular sauce.  I added a little of oregano, because the sauce was a little sweet.  I also added some italian link sausages. YUMMY!!!!!

Pretty good basic tomato sauce. I didn't have tomato puree, so I omitted it. I also omitted the salt. As for the minced garlic, pepper, dried basil, and sugar, I eyeballed it. I also added 1/2 sauteed chopped onion and a good amount of dried spices from my Italian jar. Oh, and I cooked it nowhere near 3 hours; more like 20-30 minutes until I got impatient.

It is a pretty good recipe.not needed and take it out.  So is it "7 ingredient" or "9 ingredient" tomato sauce?

Super easy and tasty recipe! It makes a great base sauce that you can alter by adding meat, veggies, cheese, spices or spice! Freezes great!

In reference to WildBill's comment "...a pretty good recipe, though in the title it says "7" ingredient tomato sauce, but for some reason I count 9 ingredients. They need to rename the recipe or find out which 2 ingredients are not needed and take it out. So is it "7 ingredient" or "9 ingredient" tomato sauce?"
Technically this is a 7 ingredient sauce. The  second ingredient, tomato, happens to be in three different forms (paste, puree, and crushed). So the title is technically accurate.

Very good basic recipe. I SKIP the sugar and add grated carrots in its place.  Very, very good.  Adds the sweetness without adding white sugar.  I saut√© the carrots with garlic and onion.

For those who don't like the acidity in tomatoes, an old Italian trick is a pinch of baking soda in the sauce. I love this recipe!

This is the same my families, except my mom would use oregano. Also by caramelizing the tomato paste, I rarely need sugar.

Three hours is unnecessarily long for a simple sauce like this.  It will be fine in 30-45 minutes.  If you cook meat in the sauce, a longer time is justified.

Excellent! I sauteed 1/2 of a diced onion with the garlic for personal preference. Also increased the sugar to 2Tbsp. Tastes just like my Italian Grandma's "Sunday Gravy"!!

Wow, some of the negative reviews for this are so nasty.  Gross?  This is how red sauce is made.  You may not like this recipes, but what's gross about it? 

I make this same sauce, using different amounts depending on how much I want to make.  I always make a big batch and freeze in ball jars, so I never buy store bought sauce. Also, I find that a really good sweet onion diced and cooked really slowly with the garlic will eliminate a need for the sugar. Just make sure you do not burn them.  Then add the tomatoe products. I usually simmer my sauce for that long to thicken it.  A nice slow process which is why I make a big batch and freeze it.

This is almost exactly my family recipe for red sauce. A few changes; we add 1 chopped onion, sauteed with garlic. No sugar, we use a carrot; peeled and cut into big pieces that can be removed later to sweeten sauce. Also, 1/2 peeled potatoe (to be removed later) to cut down on acid & salt.

I have a very similiar recipe, try browning some diced pancetta in the olive oil first, remove and brown your garlic and/or onions in the fat.  Add the pancetta back to finished sauce.  Delicious!!!

Great basic tomato sauce recipe. Change the 2tsps basil to 2 TBs basil and you'll have no need for sugar & it is much healthier...I'd also add 1 TB oregano.

a little trick to lessen the bitterness I learned from watching Giada is to add about a tablespoon of real butter just before serving...still use the sugar too. It does help.

Made this recipe today. Way too acidic. Added baking soda, wine and water. Still don't like it. Maybe one less can of puree substituted for diced tomatoes would have been better. Going to continue playing with it until its to my liking.

It is what it says it is!!!! Yummy!!!!!! Quick, easy, tasty! Perfect when your in a hurry and want full flavor!! I use home canned tomatoes so I would recommend a good brand of tomatoes....makes all the difference! Also I omit the sugar as home canned don't seem to need it, but I love love love this simple recipe! Ty

I make a sauce that is a carbon copy of this, and a couple years ago started adding a pureed roasted red pepper (roasted in olive oil, 425 degrees). It made what was a good, basic sauce, a whole other beast. Robust and flavorful,really upped the sauces game, lol.

For the reviewer who believes the garlic contributes to bitterness, please use only fresh garlic which is very sweet...the older it gets the more bitter it becomes.  I always use garlic and onions, plus oregano.

I've been making this style sauce for ages. For variations I may add a bit of crushed red pepper and/or some red wine.  Also I some times add mild or hot italian sausage, cut into pieces. I just add the uncooked sausage to the sauce and cook as directed for about 3 hours. The sausage comes out really moist and tender.

I couldn't help but add some extra spice to this.  1 tsp dried oregano and 1 tsp dried thyme.  I could not find tomato puree so I used tomato sauce and the tomato paste I had was one with garlic in it.  I thought it turned out really well but maybe the puree would have added something.

This is a great, basic tomato sauce recipe.  Following the suggestions of others, I added some oregano, thyme and a small bay leaf, as well as 1/2 cup of red wine.  As the sauce was cooking, I also added a teaspoon of baking soda.  It is a little bland by itself over pasta, but would go great with sausage or meatballs.  Definitely will keep this as a staple.

I had to skip the tomato puree because I didn't have any on hand. I added a tiny pinch of crushed red pepper. It was delicious! I've been looking for a simple but flavorful spaghetti sauce and this was it! Thank you for sharing!!

I used a crockpot, and followed some advice in the comments to use onion (I used about a half of a small one) instead of sugar, and it turned out fantastic.

Really liked....made homemade meatballs and after browning, let them cook in the sauce for several hours
Will make again.
