I tried the 1st batch as directed-and I ended up with cookies that had spread over the whole pan. The 2nd batch, I omitted the cornstarch, replaced 1/4 c of sugar with icing sugar (confectioners) and added 2tbsp of flour. Beautiful!

I made a double batch of these. I did drizzle them with chocolate. It adds a really snazzy touch to them. My first batch I followed the directions. I found that greasing and starching the cookie sheet DID NOT work. They were difficult to remove and frustrating. The second batch I used parchment paper which worked wonderfully. Whoever invented parchment paper deserves a scratch and sniff sticker!

I found these sweets quick and easy to make. They would add an old fashioned touch of elegance to any tray of goodies. 
I used parchment to line my cookie sheet, and had no trouble with sticking, but I slightly under-baked the first sheet and they ended up too soft. Just make sure the edges are golden and they should be fine.  Also, they spread our alot! I thought I was making pretty small drops, until they came out! They were about four times larger in diameter! All in all, very, very good!

Like most others, I got coconut patties. Not sure where I went wrong, I followed the recipe.. I beat the bejesus out of the egg whites, and as soon as I added sugar (even the first spoonful) it went flat. Anyone who claims they didn't get a unicookie is simply lying. I whipped the eggs until they peaked like Mt. Everest, and then the sugar flattened them out like Kansas. This recipe is a good way to lower your self esteem.

Excellent!  I flollowed the advice of others and replaced the cornstarch with 1/4 cup flour.  They were cripsy on the outside and soft in the center.  I would recomend doubling the batch because one is not nearly enough:)  I made half of them with chocolate chips and coco.  Mmmmm chocolate:)

We loved these cookies! 'Perfection'.
I didn't have any trouble at all getting them off the cookie sheet like others have reported, I used just baking spray.  I mixed in 1/4 C. flour instead of the small amount of cornstarch. I also did not use any chocolate, but they were great anyway!

I think there's something wrong with this recipe... mine turned out runny, flat, and really weird.  I added a photo of how they turned out.

I thought these were super easy to make and tasted great. They are very sweet, but that is how i like cookies. I made a double recipe using half splenda and half sugar. My cookies did not stick to the pans, i guess that has happened to other reviewers. I did grease the pans and coat with cornstarch and they came right off with a spatula.

I rated a little low on the kid friendliness just because I'm not sure many kids like coconut.  These are wonderful tasting and very easy.  I omit the chocolate and add a little almond extract for variety.  I have also made these with Splenda and can't tell the difference from regular sugar.  You don't have to know how to cook to make these great cookies.

With just a few adjustments, these came out really good! I added 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I added a little water (maybe 2 tablespoons) to make them gooey enough to stick together. I sprayed my cookie sheets and they didn't stick (or spread.) I didn't do the chocolate.  Very easy and very yummy.

Beautiful and tasty cookies, these macs are very easy to make. Made them for a 50's costume party, and were a huge hit to go along with the old-fashioned theme. I left out the chocolate- didn't seem necessary.

I felt compelled to write a review of these easy and fast cookies. I read the negative reviews before I made these cookies and I was concerned they might not turn out ok. But I wanted to try it because I'm avoiding flour and milk for a few weeks. I followed the recipe almost exactly only making a small change using less sugar (1/3c) and they turned out perfectly. They had a great texture and kept their shape. In trying to figure out why so many people had trouble during the baking process I wondered if people might be using sweetened coconut flakes which might throw off the texture. I used unsweetened from the health food store and they are very dry. Just a thought. Using the parchment paper also makes fast cleanup.

This was a good recipe with a few twists.  Doubled recipe, added 1/2 c. flour, 3 eggs, 1 t. vanilla and almond extract.  Very good.  I noticed if you take macaroons out of pan as soon as you take out of oven makes for easier removal.

These were perfect. I doubled the recipe. Used 1/2 c. flour (for a double recipe) and just half the corn starch. I beat the 2 whole eggs til frothy before folding them in. did not spread one bit. and look and taste perfect! This is a keeper!

These macaroons started out good, but when I put them on the pan the liquid parts spread across the whole pan.  It ended up with very flat coconut disks with a crunchy film all over.

Extremely easy and tasty way to use up that bag of flaked coconut that's been sitting in the fridge forever.
Next batch I may skip the chocolate...they're great without it.

I did the flower instead of cornstarch, plus a 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Turned out pretty good, nice snack to have around.

Yummmmmmmmy! I read the reviews and almost didn't make these because of them. I'm glad  I decided to try them anyway. I, too, used  flour instead of  cornstarch, and I made sure I greased and floured the cookie sheet. I also added a touch of almond flavoring. I don't see any reason why these wouldn't come out perfectly. The only thing I can think of is that  they are not following the rest of the  recipe exactly as stated.

As per the other reviews, my macaroons also flattened out and I couldn't get them off my cookie sheet in one piece.  AND, even worse, my husband wouldn't even eat them, and he's not one to pass by anything sweet, even if it is in pieces.  Will never make this recipe again.

2 stars only for the good taste, the look is pretty emberessing. Good thing it didnt waste much ingrediets. Well I changed the recipe as others suggested, used powdered sugar as it already has starch. Istead of starch I used 2 tbsp of flour.

I love this recipe.  It's fast and easy which I love! Instead of the cornstarch, I used flour. I doubled the amount of flour and instead of chocolate, added about two teaspoons of lemon juice and they turned out great.  I also didn't have any issues with the cookies sticking to the cookie sheet, I just used cooking spray.  The only down side is I didn't double the recipe, which I definitely will be doing next time.

Recipe works fine if you use a finer shred coconut.  That's the only thing I can think of as to why others couldn't get the recipe to work. These came out great for me, and I hardly ever bake.

I made a few changes and these turned out fantastic! Changes: replaced 1/4 c. white sugar with confectioner's sugar, omitted cornstarch, added 4 tbls flour, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 6 tbls ground almonds. I loosened the cookies with a spatula as soon as I took them out of the oven.

Simple and delicious!  I have made this recipe a dozen times. I followed the suggestion of reviewers and replaced cornstarch with 1/4 cup of flour.

Very easy to make. I substituted the flour for the cornstarch as recommended. I also used Splenda sugar blend instead of sugar.

Very easy, and pretty tasty. Like others, I substituted the cornstarch for a half cup flour. They turned out pretty well - I've added pictures to prove it to the reviewer calling us liars (the pics on a cooling rack). Have no idea why others had problems. I used finely shredded coconut. The egg should just provide enough moisture to pull the dough together; not so liquid that they run all over the cookie sheet. Upon cooking they spread a bit, just like any cookie. I used parchment paper the first time i made them but didnt have any the second time - you definitely need it. If you are beating your egg whites you're doing it wrong - read the directions. i think the smaller the cookie, the better they tend to hold their shape, so if you're having problems try making them smaller.

Mine did flatten out and were tricky to get off the pan, but they tasted so good that I didn't care! Loved this recipe.

These were certainly sweet and chewy, but wouldn't call them "easy".  Agreed with the others, they flattened out during baking and were difficult to get off the floured sheet.  Ended up reforming the cookies, putting the chocolate on and then put them in the fridge.

Really easy, good consistency although HARD to get off the pan. Try sticking it in the freezer to have the macaroons pop off.  Not a super coconutty flavor but not bad either.  Tasty all in all.

These cookies tasted very good but my cookies flattened out and the edges got very crispy.  I will definitely try these again and hopefully get it right.

This recipe was super easy to make and turned out great.  I didn't use the chocolate, but they still turned out great.
