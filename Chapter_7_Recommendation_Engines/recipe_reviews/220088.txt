Great recipe.  I left out the cottage cheese and doubled the ricotta.  I just don't feel cottage cheese belongs in lasagna.  If my Sicilian grandmother were still here she would have fainted from shock if I put cottage cheese in my lasagna!

So yummy! I added mushrooms, squash, rosemary, and used about 1.5x the sauce recommended. I highly recommend this! Next time I make it, I'm going to add shredded chicken.

Delicious. My kids tore it up. I used a bit more sauce than the recipe called for, if you don't like your lasagna dry, i would. 
Highly recommend.

This was delicious!  I had a 16 oz container of full fat cottage cheese so I just used that instead of ricotta.  I also sauteed an onion before adding the garlic and eggplant, because that makes everything better.  I then added italian seasonings to that mixture before adding the tomato sauce because I only had the plain sauce without herbs.  I also added lots of chopped basil to the spinach mixture for additional flavor.  Oh and I didn't cook the noodles- I never do.  They cook when you bake it.  Really really yummy!

Came out very good. As per other reviews doubled the ricotta cheese, avoided the cottage cheese. Increased the tomato sauce.

Good but totally changed the process.  I did not pre cook anything and also I did not use whole wheat noodles, ricotta or cottage cheese, as they are very expensive and hard to find in Turkey.  Instead I used regular lasagna noodles, kasar (cheese similar to provolone) and  suzme peynir ( similar to a creamy feta).  Then I just made the layers as called for and addled about 1/4 cup of water over the top and covered it and let it cook.  Turned out perfect!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! It is easy to put together and faster than a meat lasagna. Made the recipe just as called.

This was easy to prepare the meal for my family who all love vegetables.  Maybe the next time, I'll add in a few more spices and vegetables like mushrooms and peppers to make it more flavourful.  

Overall - this was one of the best meals I've had.

I followed the recipe and had to add more than mayo sauc e.
I don't think recipe gave the correct amount of tomato sauce
needed and that is why I am only given it 4 stars.  Otherwise
Lasagna was very good!  Will make again but make sure I 
double the amt of tomato sauce.

I made this as close to the directions as possible (my gorcery store didn't have the right noodles or tomato sauce). I absolutely LOVED this! I reheated it the second night and could taste the eggplant more (which I loved). I will definitely be making this again (and again, and again....)

Turned out really good.  I added mushrooms, forgot the ricotta and just added extra mozzarella and cottage cheese and ended up with a few less layers than I was supposed to (I'm a lasagne novice) but even so, my boyfriend and I really liked it, thanks for the recipe!

Excellent dish.  I usually don't like the vinegar flavor of Italian food,  so I usually spice it up a bit with dried chili seeds and horseradish mustard.  I also add a little extra garlic and green onions.  But the other ingredients for this dish were excellent.
