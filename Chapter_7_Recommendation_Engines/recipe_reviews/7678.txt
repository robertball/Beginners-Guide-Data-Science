Going over the ingredients, I decided to double-check the accuracy of the verses listed alongside them and only found three actual correct verses listed in this recipe

This was a fun recipe for our Bible study group.  I sent a verse or 2 to each member and they brought the item.  We prepared the cake together rereading the verses.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I gave it a 3 star for kids because I'm not sure that kids would enjoy the raisins, figs and such and we didn't share it with kids. I gave the Easiness a 4 star because some of the ingredients were hard to pull out or figure out from the passages, but the spices aren't really mentioned by name in the verses.  Overall it's fun!

I found a receipe for "Scripture Cake" in a book, "The Rosewood Casket", by Sharyn McCrumb. I think it was an Oprah pick. There was not enough detail in the book, so I searched the web and found this recipe. I thought it would be fun to serve the cake at a women's retreat sponsored by my community church. Hope it's good!

The recipe I have is considerably different--yet similar.  The Scripture verses that mine shows are:  I Samuel 30:12 raisins; Nahum 3:12 figs; Judges 4:19 milk, rather than water ; Numbers 17:8 almonds; I Samuel 14:25 honey; Amos 4:5 baking powder; II Chronicles 9:9 spices to taste; Jeremiah 17:11 eggs.  Also, from the recipe I have, the cake is to be baked in a well-greased tube pan at 300 degrees for 2 hours.  I have not actually made the cake.  The cake sounds delicious!

1 hour is WAY too long to bake this cake.  Mine was burning after about 30 minutes at 375*.  Giving it a 1 rating right now because mine is burnt....but it smells(ed) very good.  After I have a chance to get the ingredients to make it again I will probably change my rating.

I loved how the cake kept its shape in the bundt pan...cooked nicely with recommended times. It was a decent cake, but the little kids I made it for are too used to much sweeter cakes lol. Fun recipe, had all the kids looking up the ingredients as a scripture chase.

I suspect I may have undercooked it a little, I couldn't tell if it tasted dry or rubbery. Alternatively, I could have added a little too much flour to the mix. Either way, I didn't like the way it tasted. Maybe I'm just unaccustomed to fresh fig flavor. Or possibly the figs went sour. I don't know how to tell that either. Probably a more experienced chef than I could tweak this to his/her liking.
