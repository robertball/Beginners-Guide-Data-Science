We loved this recipe - made it for a BBQ and it went over great!  The only thing I did differently was that I pureed 1/2 of the strawberries and then added them.  Will make this again!

I made this once, and now people keep asking me to make it.  I prefer stronger, more tart lemonade with a touch of vodka.  So now I use 2 frozen lemonade cans, 6 cups water, 1.5 cups vodka, and one 16oz frozen "strawberries in sugar" container (which i strain before adding to the lemonade).  It is incredible.

Last evening we went to an expensive restaruant and had strawberry lemonaid and it tasted wonderful.  Today I looked for a strwberry lemonade and found this recipe.  It tasted exactly the same and for a fraction of the price. This became my favorite drink on a hot Summer day! Highly recomended!

Made these last August when it was so blasted hot outside!  I like to take Mason jars & put them in the freezer to frost up.  When ready to serve, take jars out of freezer & wet the rim with water; shake off excess.  Then dip the rim into some white granulated sugar.  Enjoy!

Should I have pureed the fruit prior to adding it? I used raspberries instead. The idea was o.k., but the texture was not drinkable. I'll try again with pureed fruit.

What a great recipe.  I made enough for everyone but me, so unfortunately I didn't get to try it.  But everyone thought it was a great drink.  Instead of using frozen strawberries, I added fresh ones.

Here's a case where it's SO difficult to rate a recipe because of mitigating factors - personal preference, as always, being one of them. The other is confusion about ingredients, in this case, the strawberries.  The recipe is vague - sliced strawberries, halved, whole?  Sweetened?  Unsweetened? I was so confused by all the choices in the grocery store I just finally grabbed halved strawberries in syrup. I found it made for nice chunks of strawberries that floated prettily to the top (kind of like the Italian wild strawberry liqueur, Fragoli).  I did find it a little sweet, but after it diluted a little from the ice cubes in my glass, it was much better.  But others may not find it too sweet at all!  In hindsight, given that it was a little too sweet for me, and given that I already had strawberries in my freezer I had bagged and frozen myself, I think I would have steered away from the frozen sweetened strawberries and just used what I had.  Even so, it was still deliciously different and very attractive.

I first pureed almost all of the strawberries with the lemonade concentrate and one can water.  Then I added this mix to another 3 1/2 cans (not cups) water.  It was delicious, and really brought out both the lemonade and strawberry flavors.  I did float a few frozen strawberries in each glass when serving.

This is AWESOME! My kids LOVED it! However, for adult entertaining, add some Absolut Citron, or similar, and it's a wonderful and refreshing cocktail. I did put the strawberries into a food processor as suggested, which is a good tip. As an added garnish, try freezing additional lemonade with sliced, fresh strawberries in ice trays. When frozen, pop them in your glass for added flavor that will not water down your drink!

I used a homemade lemonade recipe that I could make using Truvia sweetener. I did puree the strawberries before stirring them into the lemonade. We all liked this. This would be a great base for an adult cocktail, adding a finger or two of liquor--which I will try next time I make this.

I couldn't find a 10 ounce package of frozen strawberries, but no worries...I got a 24 ounce container of sliced, sweetened strawberries & pureed them in the blender once they were slightly thawed.   I split the puree between 2 batches of lemonade, and it got rave reviews at our house!  We actually used the pink lemonade concentrate...tasted amazing!

This was quick and tasty. I pureed 3/4 of a package of strawberries and froze them ahead of time in an ice cube tray. When serving I added the rest of the whole frozen strawberries and the ice cubes, after about 10 min. a quick stir and they were mixed in. This also made refills really easy. Reminds me of the strawberry lemonade at our favorite steak house.

This was a very fast and easy way to make strawberry lemonade...we did however have to add sugar to the mixture though.

Sooo delicious! I tripled the recipe for a small party and everyone loved it. I did chop the strawberried up a bit before I added them to the lemonade. The kids and adults all thought it was very good. I would prepare this drink the morning of the day you want to serve it, it gives the strawberry flavor more time to mix with the lemonade. It doesn't really keep well for the next day unless you remove the strawberries before putting the drink in the fridge, the strawberries make it way too rich if you leave them in the pitcher overnight. I wouldn't suggest adding whole raspberries, they don't really have the right texture to blend in with the lemonade just by stirring like strawberries have. If you want to try them, although I never tried it, you may want to puree a few and add that to the lemonade and add more to taste. The recipe called for strawberries - to rate the recipe using entirely different ingredients is unfair.

Easy n simple! Throw in some ice and add sparkling water to give it a tart fizzy flavor! I chopped up the strawberrys in tiny bits for decoration n sliced up strawberrys n put a few at the bottom of everybodys glasses. I decorated the rim of the cups with a full strawberry on top n cut the rest of the strawberrys in halves n threw them in the pitcher for decoration! So cute!

Went over great!  2nd time I mashed the strawberries before adding. Everytime after that we pureed the strawberries and added Fruit Fresh to them the day before.  The day of, the strawberry puree was in a bottle for everyone to add to their own like (If you pre-ad it seperates).  We have also tried this with raspberries and both are equally great.  Use the frozen berries as garnish if you want, but the lemonade won't last long enough for them to thaw. :)

yum, the one thing I did was puree 1/2 the strawberries (as suggested), and switched the water to fizzy soda to make it into strawberry lemonade soda.

I make lemonade from scratch...not the concentrate because it has TOO much sugar. I only like mine with a hint of sweetness. I added the strawberries and they were great. I got to thinking "what if I pureed some strawberries". So that I did. I put about 6 large strawberries in my mini food prep and pureed them and added 2 tbsp sugar to them and poured in the lemonade. It was so refreshing! I still put the frozen ones in too.

Perfect.
I made this for a 12 yrs old spa b-day party, ran lemon around the rim of the glasses then dipped them in powder sugar and regular sugar. Added stir sticks with strawberries and lemon wedges like a kabob. 
they were beautiful and yummy.
Have also made as a punch for a bridal shower, dipped the glasses again, 100% perfect and EASY!!

This was great.  I put the concentrate and most of the strawberries in the blender like a previous reviewer suggested.  Wonderful, Thanks!  Update:  I tried these as written and as I thought, they just tasted like lemonade with pretty red ice cubes.  They look neat though.  So Easy, thanks!

I make this all the time, and it always gets rave reviews.  I always buy enough to make the pitcher 3 or 4 times over because once its gone people will be begging for more.  I use about a cup of sliced frozen strawberries, mix the lemonade together with the strawberries, and let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours, usually more like 6.  Then the strawberry really has time to mix with the lemonade, it turns this amazing pink color, and it tastes just like something you could get at a restaurant.

Delicious and so easy. I would say to crush half of the strawberries and leave half of them whole.

This is really delicious! I pureed the strawberries in the blender first. Made a double batch and  served it last night to a group of teenagers at a pool party and it was the first thing they finished before any of the cokes or sweet tea ... many told me it was great.

A little strong but got tons of compliments on it.  Easy to make. Made smoothies by adding ice and pineapple to the left over strawberries.  Will definitely do again.

I did puree the stawberries as others suggested. I made a double batch last night to set and let the flavors involve. Needless to say one pitcher is almost empty. I will make another one today to serve at my family get together today. So easy and SO delicious!!!!

This is so simple it's ridiculous!  I love strawberry lemonade, or Freckled Lemonade as some places call it.  I used Kool-aid Pink Lemonade (1 packet) and only added 3/4 of sugar.  I used frozen strawberries in sugar and threw them in the blender and added it to my lemonade and then added water to make a total of 2 quarts.  I will double the recipe from here on out because my kids and myself sucked it down.  The frozen glasses with the sugar on the rim is an awesome addition and the kids love it.  A fresh strawberry garnish looks great on the side too!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this as a punch for a tea party I had at my house for college girls.  It went over so well!  I only had half a glass left, and that even walked out the door in a to-go cup!  This was great as-is.  The strawberries definitely do not have to be pureed to give the lemonade flavor.  Just let them soak in it for 20 minutes, and the drink is strawberry rich.  I also used the strawberries as 'ice cubes'.  I made this a half hour early and went ahead and put the frozen strawberries in.  By the time it was time to drink it, the berries were thawed!  Now all the girls are asking for the recipe!  Thanks!

some changes to make this recipe a 5 star: use pink lemonade, sweetened diced strawberries, and use 7-up/Sprite instead of water.  Puree half of the strawberries and leave the rest in the bowl.  Squeeze in one fresh lemon.  Add lots of ice.  Add water as needed if it is too sweet.  I made this for both families on Thanksgiving and it was a great hit.  There was nothing left!!!

This was so good and so easy to make. It was a hit with a 50th surprise birthday party we attended. It went over so well with the adults and children, I had to leave the party to go back to the store to get more ingredients so I could make a second batch!!! Thanks!

I put everything in the blender plus 2 Tbsp sugar - we like it that way best. It's always gone in a flash, so keep your blender out. yummy

great start. you can adjust the amount of lemonade to strawberry to your taste. i also used a fine strainer to remove small bits of strawberry, to get only a smooth lemonade. It worked great. I also served this in a punch bowl with thin slices of fresh strawberries floating on top. It looked beautiful! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made with pink lemonade. Wonderful summer drink, so refreshing. Might want to "mush" your strawberries a bit as you add them, as this will extract more flavor. VERY easy to make!

Good lemonade with a twist of strawberry taste. We love this, but when we make it we make some adjustments - I make the lemonade from fresh lemons (using the Old Fashion Lemonade recipe on this site).  I then add strawberry syrup (found in the baking, breakfast or ice cream aisle in the grocery store - ice cream syrup, hershey's syrup, or strawberry pancake syrup will even do the trick) and then I add sliced fresh strawberries.  This is a winner and everyone will love this on a hot summer day. YUMMY!!

Easy and refreshing. Can be made with strawberries or raspberries-frozen or fresh, or combo of both. For a 21 and over crowd, this is good mixed with a little sweet tea vodka! ;)

While this was *awesome*, I had to change it a bit to get there.  I used strawberries in sugar and pureed them to get the flavor to incorporate over night better.  Also, when mixing all the ingredients together, I used 6cups of water instead of the 4 and 1/2.  Even when pouring glasses of it tho, I used liberal ice and sometimes added more water because it seemed very thick (almost syrupy).  So I'm not sure how much extra water I really added but the fact that I added any says a lot since I'm one of those people who likes super sweet, super concentrated stuff!

Good recipe, but better if you blend some of the strawberries in the blender and add a bit of sugar to them if you buy the unsweetened frozen strawberries. Then pour the blended strawberries into the prepared lemonade, and it comes out a really pretty color. Then add some of the whole frozen strawberries to it. Everyone loved it at the BBQ that I made it for.

Very good! Used a bag of unsweetened whole strawberries and scoop of sugar in the blender then added with 2 cans of frozen lemonade and about 6 cups of water. Will add vodka per glass with lots of ice.

This drink is the best!!  I first served it at a dinner that i had for my aunt and my gramma, then i served it at my mom's birthday and everyone loved it!! Both times! Instead of making lemonade from the can i just made homeade lemonade and then put frozen strawberries in it for ice cubes!! It worked out great. Thanks Sony!!

Tanaquil, thanks for posting a review; this turned us on to this recipe. We keep frozen strawberries here for smoothies and we keep frozen lemonade concentrate so this was a breeze to throw together. My kids loved this and I thank you for something fun for us to make together! Very tasty and refreshing!

Quick and easy.  This was a hit with my two young girls.  I bought whole frozen strawberries at the store, then thought that the recipe probably intended for frozen sliced (I sliced them after they partially thawed).

Very good and soooo pretty. It is definitely tart with ony 4 1/2 cups of water so I added about 3 more cups of water. I also sweeteened the strawberries as they were defrosting and poured the strawberries and sugary syrup that remained into the juice. It was still tart but it was VERY good.

This is a really easy and delicious recipe.  I think it tasted better after it sat for about thirty minutes when I made it the second time.

I pureed the fruit, and don't think I would have been able to taste the strawberry flavor otherwise. But it was great, even better than what you get in restaurants, not to mention much cheaper.

This is good.  It actually got better the longer the strawberries sat.  It's easy and presents nicely.  I would make it for picnics or parties, but it wasn't an everyday in the fridge kind of lemonade.

This was pretty good.  As a few other reviewers did I also blended a few strawberries and added them to the lemonade, in addition to the whole strawberries added at the end.  I did have to blend it a few more times to get to be more of a liquidy texture than a smoothy-type texture.

This is very good.  My only concern is the amount of sugar...I'd like to find more tasty drinks and food in general that don't have so much sugar or high fructose corn syrup.

Great recipe but I messed with it some-I put the strawberries thru the food processer & added bacardi limon. Served it at a party & people loved it. Also froze some & it was a good alcoholic slush as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Kids seemed to like it.  I thought it wasn't very strawberry flavored - the lemonade was too tart.  But a good summer drink!

This was super easy and yummy! We had this as our "punch" at a bridal shower. The only thing I would change would be to use sliced fresh strawberries - even partially thawed frozen strawberries (as indicated in recipe) are kind of mushy.

This was so easy and very very good!!  I am a diabetic so I don't want all of the sugar.  My family drinks Crystal Light lemonade.  So I made that the usual way and then added slightly crushed fresh strawberries.  I let it sit in the refrigerator for approximately an hour to let the strawberry juices get into the lemonade and then served.  It was amazing without too many carbs/sugar.  My family loved it and I have made it several times now.

I made this after buying two huge cups of fruity lemonade at an outdoor concert where the temperature went past 100.

Anyway...I'm lazy so I just bought the lemonade.  The first time I added grapes in with the strawberries and put a little sierra mist in there as well, but after that I just left out the grapes because I felt it didn't really make a difference.

Perfect - so easy, so yummy.  I'm tainted though - will never order it at a restaurant again knowing how easy it can be.  I used fresh strawberries that I had frozen and broken into chunks.

Easy but tastes and looks like it took a long time. I also added lemon slices and a little less water. Yum!

It was super yummy, but I don't like soggy strawberries so I actually blended them up. But the pitchers I made were all gone before the end of the day so it's a keeper for sure!

This was so delicious.  I no longer have to pay 3 dollars plus for Wendy's strawberry Lemonade.  This is a keeper at my house.
