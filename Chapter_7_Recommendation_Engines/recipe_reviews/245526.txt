Very easy to make! The dough was sticky so I chilled it for several hours before rolling out and cutting the cookies.  I liked the subtle flavors, but I like my gingerbread spicier so I think I will stick to recipes with molasses and ginger, or make this again with molasses instead of the honey, and add ginger.
