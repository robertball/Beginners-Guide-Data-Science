This was very very yummy.  There was plenty of sauce though, so next time I think I'll cook the whole 16oz of pasta and leave the rest of the ingredients unchanges.  Oh, and rather than coarsely chop the shrimp I bought smaller (cheaper) shrimp--the ones that are 71 to 90 count a pound.

This was very rich but in a guilt-free fashion.  My family really liked it.

Awesome, but the pesto had a bit too much butter.

My family, including hard to please teenager, really enjoyed this, so I will make it again. It was very easy. Personally, I felt it lacked a little something- maybe add some olives?
