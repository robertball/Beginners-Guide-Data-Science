I debated between a 3 and a 4. I think this recipe has a lot of potential. Cooking with the dressing was interesting (although you can't really taste the dressing), as was the "quick roasting," which is essentially what happened in the skillet while it simmered. And, while my husband and I liked the creaminess of the sauce, we both agreed that it needed a lot more flavor. If I make this again, I'll probably leave out the veggies (and serve a fresh salad on the side), and either simmer down the cooking liquid to use as a sauce (in the hopes of keeping the tang of the dressing) or, if I do add the cream cheese at the end, also add some dijon mustard or something else to give it some flavor.

I made this last night and my family LOVED it. Instead of using a skillet I made it in the clowcooker. It was awsome.

I love this dish, but the flavor of the cream cheese can be strong.  I use a lot of salt and pepper to help.

This is totally bland in a "hospital food" kind of way. If you are somebody who's watching their sodium and used to blandness, this will be right up your alley.

The name isn’t very appealing but the ingredients are simple enough. Of course I added a twist. I slow cooked the chicken thighs and added a mixture of seasonings to the flour bowl. I also added bell peppers and onion to the skillet. The chicken thighs has more flavor than breasts. This meal earned me a high five. Impressive.

I precooked the carrots as suggested and added seasoned salt to the cheese sauce.  I thought the dinner was delicious.

Made this last night and my family LOVED it, and my family is very picky. I did make a few adjustments. Added salt to the flour mix, used boneless chicken breast, doubled the Italian dressing, and I didn't add the chicken broth in the sauce (because I doubled the Italian dressing). Only complaint was the carrots didn't cook enough so I will cook them before adding or just leave them out next time.

Meh. This wasn't my favorite. Might be for someone else though. I did 1/2 cup less broth and chicken breast without the bone.
