8-21-2017  ~Five bananas is a lot for one banana bread, so I thought I'd be just fine with the four I had on hand.  Turns out the four were more than plenty.  I did have  a couple of issues with this recipe.  This is called “Boozy Banana Bread,” yet I had no doubt that a skimpy three drops of Amaretto called for would have absolutely no boozy flavor impact.  Even the one tablespoon of rum I used (I had no Amaretto on hand at our place here in Naples) could not be detected at all.  I believe that nothing less than a quarter cup would. Similarly, I questioned the value of three drops of almond extract, which I eliminated, adding a tsp. of vanilla instead.   Of more concern to me was the one teaspoon of salt called for, a good 1/2 tsp. more than necessary.  I  cut that back to 1/2 tsp. which worked out just fine, as I knew it would.  In this instance, muffins were a better choice for me so I baked these at 350 degrees, for about 24 minutes.  I filled the 12 muffin cups nearly to the brim and they turned out beautiful and plump.  While these ended up being just delicious in every way, I still must dock this recipe a star for not living up to its name and for the excess amount of salt.

3.13.17  I looked at this recipe and thought 3 drops each of Amaretto and almond extract aren’t going to add much flavor to this, not to mention making it “boozy.”  Added 1/4 tsp almond extract and 1/2 Tbsp Amaretto, tasted the batter, still no flavor, so did the same thing again.  What I ended up with was an absolutely delicious loaf of banana bread but.....not even a hint of almond or Amaretto.  And you know what?  That’s OK because with all of those ripe, sweet bananas, and the addition of some chopped walnuts (gotta have nuts in banana bread), this is an outstanding recipe.  So that being said, I’m giving it 5 stars!

I only had four large ripe bananas which worked well. I added more almond extract and a glug of amaretto. I think a few more would do better as I could not detect either. I added half a bag of Guittard semi sweet chocolate chips because... chocolate. Got raves from all tasters. Definite do over with some minor tweaks.
