Absolutely beautiful pudding. The cinnamon and nutmeg really gave it a kick. I served it with vanilla icecream, and when I make it again, and I surely will, I won't be changing a thing.

I followed the directions as written for this recipe (for the most part) and it turned out great!! Used skim milk, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and nutmeg to just under 1/2 tsp. (BTW don't increase the nutmeg unless you really like nutmeg) and that's all the changes I made. Very easy and fast to make. Probably be making again.

Quite good, nice change.  Didn't give us our customary sugar coma, which for me was awesome..However, Mine didn't come out looking as lovely as the picture, which was a disappointment (Certainly didn't detract from the taste!).  Added LOTS more cinnamon & nutmeg.  Used an extra piece of cinnamon bread.    **One more thing: Didn't have any caramel sauce, so I made one off this site..**

I give this recipe 5 stars because it was super easy and delicious.  I used sugar free syrup, but added 2 T. of butter and about 2 T of brown sugar and only used 1/4 c of syrup.  Still yummy!  Next time, I think I"ll add some kind of crunchy topping.

Made with a package of leftover hotdog buns the morning after a party, and it came out amazing!!  Leftover whipcream from the mixed drinks went good on top too!!  Note, i thought this would be a square pan, but needed a 9x 13-and don't forget to spray the bottom first (sorry hubby)

Awesome bread pudding! I added chopped pecans because I had them on hand. Great for fall or anytime. Would make a good dish to take for a dessert or breakfast casserole.

Oh man this is SO good! I cut the sugar so that I could serve this for breakfast, and I used a homemade butterscotch sauce instead of caramel, just enough to make a nice presentation. Very indulgent breakfast, probably a perfect dessert. We loved it and the best part was that the prep took me maybe 4 or 5 minutes. I actually had to keep waiting for the oven to preheat after I was done getting this ready. Quick prep, so easy and tasty. Note: I also used sugar-free syrup and it tasted and cooked wonderfully. Thank you!

I decided to take this as my contribution for my adult Sunday School Class, so I doubled the recipe, added 1 1/4 cup dried cranberries & baked it for 55 minutes instead of 40. Wow! They loved it & wanted the recipe.  Several took 2nds, and one took 3rds!  Referred them to this web site, of course. It's utterly addictive, to say the least.

I've made this twice & it is easy & delicious!  The best part is that my hubby would never eat bread pudding, but this recipe has made him love it!  I mix the bread cubes into the egg mix after it is put together, & pour it all in the pan. I use days old cinnamon bread from a local bakery. I cooked an apple in some butter till soft,added some syrup (both maple & caramel), & poured it over the top after I took the pudding out

So glad for this recipe as I was trying to do something with my unsuccessful attempt at another posted recipe for "potato crescent rolls". Used torn up pieces of rolls for bread and sprinkled some dried coconut & cranberries on top. Also subbed no sugar syrup (as someone suggested) as that is what I had on hand. Turned out great - yummy with some vanilla yogurt on the side!

This is okay, considering all of the lower fat ingredients.  It's not the best bread pudding, but I still liked it.  I had to make it with cinnamon raisin bread because I could not find any plain, but that's okay because I love raisins.  Had for dessert after dinner and will have again with brunch tomorrow.

this turned out GREAT!! we made it with gluten free using gluten free bread!  My dad (gluten allergic) had a fit!  He informed me he was taking the left overs home -- not that there was much to take ;)

Great recipe but think it needs raisins, apples, etc.
Will definitely make it again!
And as another reader suggested, it is excellent with ice cream!!!

Delicious! I followed all directions except for one thing.  I soaked pieces of cut up croissants in amaretto rather than using cinnamon bread. So tasty!

Terrific bread pudding! I have received many recipes from this site that are good but this is my first review. I cannot say enough about how wonderful this bread pudding is. I live in Las Vegas and have had many different bread puddings at varies buffet; but this beat them all! The only alterations I made were to add more cinnamon, used cinnamon strudel bread add crushed pecan to it about 10 minutes before it finished baking(great addition), then I topped the whole thing with caramel while hot to let it seep in, as I was serving it the next day. I would suggest doubling it because it will go fast.

Save the day.  I overbaked some cinnamon buns and was looking for a way to save them. Your recipe came to the rescue. Because the buns were dry, I did add another cup of almond milk and an extra egg. I omitted the cinnamon, tons in the cinnamon buns and no caramel topping,. (I was tempted but there was plenty of sugar in the buns.) The maple sugar and nutmeg were a great added bonus.  I'm always looking for a good, easy recipe for bread pudding and I definitely will use this next time with regular bread.

Excellent! I let my cubed bread dry out overnight (not on purpose, I just realized I didn't have any eggs when I started making it... haha) and used 3 whole eggs rather than bother separating the whites from the last one. This all fit in a square 8x8 pan for me, not sure if my bread slices were small or if that's the size you're supposed to do or what, but it was the perfect size.

The flavour was good but the texture was stodgy.  I used cinnamon raisin bread because that's what I had.  It was a waste - ordinary bread would have had the same result considering that extra cinnamon was added anyway.  No-one wanted seconds. I'd better stick with bread & butter pudding in future.
