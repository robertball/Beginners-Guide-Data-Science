We were disappointed in these but with alterations these could be good. As written the potato pancakes were bland and are in definite need of flavor. I would add onion and garlic. They were crispy on the outside and doughy in the middle. An egg may help or reducing the amount of flour.

These are non-kosher latkes not boxty.  My  grandmother from Belfast, Ireland's recipe is made with leftover mashed potatoes.

It was a change from the usual. I spiced mine up with a little hot pepper, onions and garlic powder.

I added Parmesan cheese into the mixture-it was delicious!
