We really liked this dish!  I only felt that the 8 oz of pasta was a little too much; I think next time I will use close to 6 oz to maximize the creaminess.  Also, for people who may have felt it didn't have enough flavor, try using a little extra ginger, a little cayenne pepper, some cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.  Adds a little more Thai / Latin American influence.  Hearty and reheats really well; we'll be making this again.

Very good blend of flavors.  My mango was not still a bit raw, so I would expect it to taste even better with a proper ripe one.  I used skim milk to cut down on fat and thickend the sauce with cornstarch.

The end result of this recipe was delicious. I had some preparation problems with not having a pot large enough to hold all of the ingredients together for the tossing, so I ended up dividing it in half, and tossing it in the pan I cooked the chicken in and the other half in the pot I cooked the noodles in. I might use penne pasta next time, though I liked the change in using rotini. Instead of heavy cream, I used 3/4 cup of lactaid skim milk and 1/4 cup margarine. The sauce isn't as thick that way, but it cuts down on the fat and is lactose-free :)

Well, this is one of those odd recipes where I actually couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. It was easy and fun to put together, and looked pretty when done, but I wasn't sure about the flavor and I'd be reluctant to serve it to guests because I'm not sure they'd like it. HOWEVER, my husband really liked it a lot, so I'll be making it again for him.

I love mango so that was my favorite part of this recipe. It was really delicious fresh, although just very slightly bland.  The flavor didn't keep well for leftovers.  Next time I would cut the onions differently as the ring shapes were a bit awkward both for cooking and eating.  I suggest adding a little more pepper, maybe an additional yellow bell pepper.  But overall it was not bad.  I would make it again with a few small adjustments.

Awesome! Made this for Mother's Day dinner w/my parents and in-laws. My husband and I and all of the parents loved it. I doubled the recipe, used a yellow and a red bell pepper, less onion, less garlic, and a tiny bit less cream. Added the juice of about a third of a lime. My husband is already asking for me to make it again sometime.

A good experiment Shaggy!  I made this for dinner tonight and it was mmmmmm...good!  I will only make a couple of changes next time...instead of rigatoni, I will use linguini or fettuccini, and not mix it all together, but serve the sauce on top of the pasta.  The chicken is only okay for me, but Im not a big meat eater and I think this would be just as good without it.  I guess I will be doing some experimenting of my own!  Lovely dish!

This recipe had an odd mixture of ingredients but worked out really well.  I especially enjoyed the mango it it.  The only change I made was to use half and half instead of heavy cream to make it a little healthier.  I will definitely make this again.

Interesting idea and a great result - nice and light - I added some milk and herbs too to save on the cream.  Surprisingly tasty!  Definately to be made again!

It was a good dish but not great.  I didn't think the mango flavor came out very well once cooked in with all the other stuff.  I would have wanted that to be stronger - that's why I gave it a 3.

Loved! Didn't use the ginger because we didnt have any. Didn't use the same pasta type. Had a guest over, both my husband and guest loved it, saying it was delicious. Best recipe on here! I've made it twice now, I personally like my mango overripe and squished in this dinner, my husband likes his mango ripe and cubed. I suggest trying it both ways because the mango really changes it! My guest begs me to make this dinner when he comes over!

This was soooo so good! I love it and will make it again. I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing except for adding more chicken and pasta. The sauce still coated everything perfectly instead of having a sauce drizzling over the food. I love it and have sent the recipe to EVERYONE I know :) Thank you for posting this delicious creation!!

My husband and I thought this was great. Being gluten intolerable, I left out the pasta and just ate the chicken in the mango sauce. I found the dish to have just the right measure of sweetness and hearty enough to eat without the pasta. This is also a great way to make the dish if you are trying to cut back on carbs.

You know... I'm generally not all that hard to please, but I'm with Ewa on this one. I was really excited to make it because I love all of the flavors that go into it, but was less than satisfied with it when I was done. First, the portions were huge - I scaled it to two servings and made it for myself, intending to have half tonight and half tomorrow, and I could never finish all that by myself in two meals even if I loved it. Second, I don't know what the photographer did differently to create what is depicted in the photo - I followed the recipe to a T - but mine didn't look anything like that. It looked mushy and had an almost uniform icky color throughout. Thirdly (and most importantly), I didn't like it! It wasn't so bad that I couldn't eat it - given that I was hungry and didn't have time to make a new dinner, I didn't have much choice - but I didn't enjoy it at all and am considering throwing out tomorrow's portion. I hate to waste the money, but I have no desire to go near that dish again!

I would have given this a 5 if it were not for the photo. fake photos with me lose 1 star. Since this meal was an experiment I did the same. Not going to list what I did more than I used the ingredients as stated more or less. I feel this dish is best appreciate by using the theory and experimenting. You can not fail with this mixture of flavors. Two thumbs up to the creator and you have given me so many new ideas.

I really enjoyed making this dish as well as eating it. I have worked until 8pm for 5 years, my hours have just changed so I get off at 4pm. I have time to cook. I never cooked before my husband always did. So to me this was a challenge and I loved it. I thought the flavors were good. I will use a different pasta next time. Possibly exclude the pasta and put the rest in tortillas...it tastes like a dish I get at this Mexican Restaraunt that they serve with tortillas. Thank you for the recipe!

This was incredible.  The only changes I made were to use 1/4t ground ginger instead of fresh, a couple shakes of poultry seasoning, a dash of seasoned salt and cayenne powder, dusted the chicken with flour, small sea shell pasta, and used a 12oz can of evap milk instead of cream.  I also cooked the vegetables with the chicken to save time.  Wow.  What a great meal.

Excellent!  A perfect blend of light and tasty.  My family loves this.  I did add a red pepper and doubled the fresh ginger.  I cut the onion and peppers into chunks to make it easier to eat.  This is a treat.  Easy to make and delicious to eat.  Thanks for the good recipe.

This recipe caught my eye some time ago when I was looking for something "exotic" to cook for my parents and fiance. It was a huge hit! The next time I made it, I chopped the peppers and onions up much smaller and cooked the ginger and garlic with the mango and cream, while cooking the peppers and onions with the chicken. It tasted the same, but was a little easier to eat. This is an instant family favorite--try it!
Thank you so much for this recipe!

ok, but seemed to be missing something... We added extra cream and cheese and lots of salt and pepper.  I think I would like it better with red bell pepper.  Maybe I'll make it again, I'm still undecied.

maybe our mangos weren't sweet enough, it seemed like the ginger over powered.  next time we'll try to make sure there's more sweetness and we think it'll be great!

This was excellent! The only things I did differently were add the crushed red pepper like many others did and I can tell it really helped. I also did not have green pepper in the house and am not a fan of it cooked, so I used frozen peas and added them with the chicken at the end. I used half and half and a little butter, and I also floured the chicken cubes before cooking, helps brown them up.  AWESOME! My hubby had seconds. Great recipe, will make it again for sure when I have a mango lying around.

I was looking for something a bit "crazy" tonight.. something my husband and I would never think of, and we came across this. These flavors work amazingly together. The only reason I didnt give it a full 5 stars ( Im going with a 4.5 ) is due to the fact that I made a couple minor adjustments. I grilled my chicken, and I added crushed red pepper, and a couple dashes of paprika to give it some heat which worked out perfect. I also used a generous amount of fresh grated pecorino romano, insted of parmesan. Great culinary mind,Shaggy.. keep experimenting and keep sharing!!

I didn't have any ginger - so no ginger was used - I used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 heavy cream.  I added more salt and pepper and some paprika - but otherwise - very yum!

So yummy! Added cayenne pepper as suggested by a number of viewers and I think that's what made it so yummy- a little sweet from the mango and a little spicy from the cayenne. Can't wait to make it again!

The ingredients sound a bit strange together but what a dish! Really great! For those of  you who can't get fresh mangos year round, I used teh refrigerated canned mango you find in the produce section (I think it is Del Monte)and just washed off the light syrup and it was good to go!

If I could give this pasta recipe 6 stars I would.  Absolutely one of the best new recipes I've tried in ages.  What a fun dish and so delicious.  I added just a touch of red pepper flakes to give it a little zip.  Can't wait to make this for company.

Very nice dish. It came out a little on the dry side so I added a little extra heavy cream. Good combination of flavors.

Only one out of five liked this recipe.  It did not look appetizing and had was bland.  I had to add cayenne pepper to it to liven it up a bit.

I made this dish for myself, but my picky boyfriend had some leftovers and we both loved it!  
My alterations:  I began by rubbing my chicken with Cajun seasoning before grilling.  I diced my onions and used red pepper instead of green, and powdered ginger to taste instead of fresh.  I pureed part of the mango and added it in with the cream (I used half-and-half) and some extra parmesan.  Added some cayenne pepper for spice.  I also used linguine for my pasta.  
Light flavors but filling and delicious!

I ended up really LOVING this recipe, my boyfriend too :), but made quite a few alterations! I had eaten a similar dish at a tasty Italian place in Omaha, called Vivace's, and decided to try something similar at home.

I used a yellow bell pepper, simply because I don't like green ones, and I used extra garlic salt, pepper and regular salt to pump up the flavor a little. Also, I baked my chicken at 350 degrees for around 30 minutes, then let it broil a little longer with a ton of jerk seasoning on it, while preparing the sauce, and then sliced it thinly and put it on top of the pasta after the grated parmesan. It was delicious! 

The kick of the jerk seasoning balanced the sweet and rich sauce SO well I thought. I also pureed half of the mango to put in with the cream, and diced the other half, which seemed to help integrate the flavor of the mango a little :)

I will definitely make this again as it was a big hit with my boyfriend who loves tropical-inspired food. Thank you!

This was delicious. I've been trying to experiment more and not just cook the same foods all the time. All I had on had was a jar of mango and milk, no cream. So for the sauce I used 1/2 cup mango juice, 1/2 cup 2% milk and 2 tbsp cornstarch to thicken. I also added some sweet peppers for added color, 5 instead of 3 garlic cloves and 3 tspn ginger instead of the 1. It was very delicious! Oh and last note, I used angel hair pasta.

My husband and I thought this was very good. Although the ingredient combination is a little unusual, it still tastes very well. The only reason it didn't get a five star is that it just needed a little more taste. I'm thinking maybe just a little spice next time.

Incredibly rich and creamy.  Great blend of flavors.  Even better the next day as the flavors had a chance to blend. As suggested I added cayenne pepper for extra kick and some red bell peppers. I also added a splash of lime juice but I think it would have been better without it.  If you're curious about trying something new give this a shot.

Yummy! I cooked this for a couple of friends last week and we all loved this recipe. I added my own flair by using sweet yellow peppers, 2 mangoes,whole wheat corkscrew pasta and threw in a few capers as a salty pop! Great Springtime dish!

Served this with "Tropical Salad with Pineapple Vinaigrette" (also from this site) to have a Caribbean themed dinner.  This was delightfully different and tasty!  Having read the other reviews I used skim milk, a tablespoon of flour, and extra cheese instead of cream.  I also added more ginger, lime juice from about half a lime, cayenne pepper, and fresh chopped cilantro at the end.  Although all the additions helped add depth to the flavor of this sauce, I think the cayenne was the most necessary.  It gave it a background of heat that complimented the ginger taste really well and worked with the sweet mango.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch later!

when i first tasted as is I thought it was very bland.  I added quite a bit of red pepper for a kick and more parmesan and THEN it tasted great!  I would recommend even using 2 mango's if your really wanting the sweetness to come out more...b/c I hardly got it.

Sorry but I thought this was fairly bland, even after I spiced it up with cardamom and jalepeno and used coconut milk instead of cream. Maybe I've destroyed my taste buds with too many spicy curries lately! Thanks for the recipe though...

This was very good. I had never used mango before in a recipe, so cutting it was a little disconcerting. Definitely Google "how to cut a mango" if you haven't done it before. But the result was delicious! It had a very nice fruity pop with the creamy base. I will make this again and again!

This was absolutely astounding!  The few things I did different were chopped the onions, peppers and mango all the same size.  I'm not sure the reason the recipe calls for rings but it was more convenient to chop them.  I used Perdue oven roasted chicken strips, added some red peppers more so for color rather than flavor and I topped the finished dish with fresh chopped basil.  My dad said this was the best pasta dish he ever had.

WOW, I thought I would really like this recipe, I love mangos, i love cream sauces... I HATED this recipe!! The mango was so sweet, and I just dont think it goes with pasta and chicken! The chicken was very boring as the recipe called for no seasoning.  I would use this recipes again, minus the mango and maybe add some crushed red pepper and sliced mushrooms , and doctor the chicken up while raw with some salt, pepper, and cajun spices.... i think the concept was there, but the mango was far too sweet to be mixed with peppers, cream and onions...

This was a very interesting dish. We tried this the other night and found it to be light and satisfying. I used half and half in place of heavy cream, and didnt need to use a thickener, added fresh basil, and rather than cooking everything together I tossed the pasta and sauce together in a large bowl, rather than adding pasta to the sauce in the skillet. To keep the mango from getting too mushy, I added it and reduced the cooking time suggested.The results were very similar to what the photo shows in appearance, topped with fresh basil...very good; but alot of tweaking to taste.

I added red bellpepper and fresh mushrooms to the sauce and used 2 Mangos instead of 1 (Delish) Also, I think penne or bowtie would soak up the sauce better.  Be sure to season your chicken real good before cooking.  I never thought mangos would taste so good in pasta WOW!

This is now in my family's "top ten" of pasta dishes.  Changes made:  I included an equal amount of red pepper and added them last as I prefer the taste of green peppers uncooked.  A little more parmesan than the recipe called for made this a perfect ten.

OMG.....This was so AWESOME!!  Took the advice of another review and added some cayenne pepper, cilantro, extra ginger, did 1/2 green and 1/2 red pepper, and a little lime juice.  TO DIE FOR!! What a wonderful taste sensation.  Thank you!!  I love new and different tastes!  This was definitely it!! Sparky K.

We marinated the chicken for an hour in 1 tsp of adobo paste and Newmans balsamic vinagrette dressing. Next we grilled it for 5 or 6 minutes. Once cooked we diced the chicken and added it to the onion, pepper(red) & mango mixture already cooking in the skillet. Finally we left out the cream, added a bit more olive oil and some fresh ground pepper. Topped with the parmesan - it was fantastic! Also we substituted whole wheat whole grain penne for the pasta to complete our attempts at a healthy low calorie meal! Thanks for the inspiration!

Very good flavors, a little bland  next time I will add about 1/2-1 tsp of salt to the chicken as it is cooking.
My daughter thought it would taste really good with grilled chicken and portabella mushrooms instead of the mango for a different taste. We will definately make this again. 
Thanks

I wish I’d thought to photograph it, lol.   It was absolutely fabulous.  So tasty.   I,d never made rigatoni pasta before but we loved it.  And as advertised it was super easy.  Loved it and will for sure be making it again,

This is very good, but I like to add more mango to get more of that delicious sweetness in the sauce.  I also use fat-free half-and-half with a bit of cornstarch in place of the heavy cream and increase the parmesan a bit.

Very good dinner that the kids and the grandparents liked. For a novice there were too many chances to mess it up. Both the chicken and pasta ended up a tad overdone and the sauce didn't thicken enough. The onion didn't add enough to the flavor. I will make it again, baking the chicken and undercooking the pasta a little bit more. I will chop the onion rather then rings. I will add some spices to the sauce also.
Older kid says, "Yummy!"

I am gluten and dairy free.(unfortunately)  I used brown rice pasta in a shape of a larger, but thinner macaronni.  I seasoned my chicken with S&P first. I used a yellow pepper, diced smaller, and onion that I sliced thin, but then cut the rings into 1/8ths instead of leaving large rings.  (depends on your personal preference.) I cooked them pretty well too. Used a little more garlic and ginger in the sauce since some said was bland.  I did have to sub whole coconut milk for the cream because of neccessarity, but we loved it.  I didn't have any, but next time some finely chopped Thai basil would be great on top of this.  My family looked at me like I was crazy, but my youngest son and I loved this, my husband really liked it and gave it 4, but my older son thought it was ok, and gave it 3, but did have seconds. I do hate when people completely change a recipe and rate it.  I don't think I really did that, just made it gluten and dairy free. They did top theirs with Parmesean cheese. I could tell the original would still be delicious.  Leftovers heated fine too.

I've never cooked with Mango before & I found this recipe thought I'd give it a try.  The whole family loved it.  I was surprised how everything just blended perfectly to make it taste so good.  I had left overs so I took them to work and everyone went on and on how good it was.

I love the recipie. There was something missing however... so I added a couple shakes of hot sauce, and a dash of red crushed pepper. Also added a little garlic salt. It was a hit at a dinner I attended. Love the mango!

This was good.  Not excellent.  3-1/2 stars.  I would make it again with the following changes. . . more spice, I added some red pepper flakes, but I would do more.  I would also try and use real heavy cream.  I used the cream substitute of 3/4C milk, 1/3C butter, & 1T flour to make the cream.  I had higher expectations for this recipe.

Great recipe, 4.5 stars!  My girlfriend and I both enjoyed this dish and will definitely make it again.  To make it healthier we substituted low-fat half and half for the heavy cream, used whole wheat rotini noodles, and added cayanne pepper for flavor as suggested by others. We also added broccoli since we don't like onions.  Fresh ingredients is what makes this dish work, I wouldn't suggest canned garlic, ginger, or mangos, fresh is so much better!

I made this because I love pasta and mango so I thought hey maybe I would like this.  I don't mean to sound mean or anything but this was pretty gross.  My husband thought it was "ok."  I'm always up for trying new recipes, even out of the ordinary ones but this blend of ingredients didn't taste good to me. I'm really sorry but I won't be making this again.  I'll stick to mango for desserts from now on.

Very Strange combination but it works surprisingly well. I used 2 mango's and added cayenne pepper to the chicken and also added 2T of spicy sauce. ( we like Spicy!) I also sub 3/4c milk 1/4c melted butter for the Heavy cream. (googled cream sub and that is what I found)

This was pretty darn good! I am currently obsessed with mangoes so I was excited to find a recipe that combined fresh produce with my boyfriend's love for chicken and pasta. I used fat free half and half with cornstarch in place of the cream, whole wheat macaroni and added some chopped jalepeno for heat. A tasty springtime meal!

This was a fun recipe to try.  I liked it.  But my children said that it was just alright and that they didn't really like the sweet taste of mango in the cream sauce.  I guess that once their taste buds mature I will try it again. Only a 5 more years!!!

Excellent dish. More of a 4 1/2 stars. I did add and extra chicken breast and some extra mango. I bought a fresh mango and jarred and used both. My fresh wasn't as ripe as i would have liked it to be and the jarred was a little mushy. I guess the key is buy fresh and simply wait it out until it ripens. I did need to triple the parmesan cheese and add a little more salt after tasting. I also added so cilantro (just a pinch) as well as paprika to the cooking chicken. Its safe to say this will be added to dishes we really like and will make again at some point in the future. I served with a nice spinach salad and garlic bread from this site.

I tried this and it turned out really well.  I'm thinking of playing around with it, trying some coconut milk or something just to mix it up.  Instead of heavy cream I used some 5% cream and some condensed milk (whatever I had on hand) and it turned out just as well.  Has anyone ever tried this with that frozen, already-chopped up mango you can buy at the store?

For me, the key to this recipe is making it a day ahead.  A recipe has to be really good for me to consider it a keeper, considering how many great recipes there are.  On day one I wasn't so sure, even though my husband liked it.  After eating left-overs on day two I decided it is a keeper.  All the flavors seemed to blend together so much better.  The onion was really sweet and the sauce really creamy and yummy.  Very nice!!!

The cream sauce is fabulous!!  Rather than chicken, I sauteed shrimp with white wine, garlic and fresh lemon juice.  Then add cooked shrimp to sauce.

I have only started really "cooking" but this was easy, tasted great, and looked beautiful. I did add red bell peppers and used purple onions w/ penne pasta. I also added some chyenne pepper. I didn't have any ginger but this was fantastic. My husbands says I could serve this to company any time or him alone anytime!!

Needs a little more mango, chicken and ginger than is called for in the recipe.

My husband and I liked it enough, but my kids, surprisingly, turned up their noses at it. Granted, the older one doesn't like peppers (I'd used red for added sweetness and because I have trouble digesting the green ones) or onions (which I had to omit anyways due to having forgotten about them when I went for groceries). I used some of the green onions and chives growing in my garden.

My husband commented on how it needed some salty to counterbalance the sweet, and he added garlic salt to his dish. My older son added more parmesan. He ate everything except for the peppers and mangoes. My younger son sort of nibbled on the meat and pasta but spit out everything else. 

I will make this again, but only for grownups.

This was delicious! The flavor was subtle and amazing, and a combination of all of my favorite things...mangoes, cheese, and pasta, and they worked really well together. I'll be making this one again for sure! Thanks!
