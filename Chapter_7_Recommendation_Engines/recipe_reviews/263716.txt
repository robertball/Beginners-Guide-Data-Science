I added potatoes, a tomato and made sure I did  brown the beef very well for a rich beefy flavor,   I used beef broth instead of chick.  
I will make this again.

Very good.  Added a cubed potato and used beef instead of chicken broth.  The slurry is an excellent add as the final ends up more like stew and less like soup.  I am one of those doesn't care for reviews where changes are made.  So forgive my indulgence.  I will keep this recipe in the rotation.

I added potatoes and used beef broth instead of chicken broth.
Second time I made it I also added sliced Baby Bella Mushrooms. Delicious!
