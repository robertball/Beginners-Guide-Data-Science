Five stars for concept, but sadly only two stars for ingredients.  If made as written the crust would be flat, tasteless - just flour and butter?  I added 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar and that was all it needed.  Instant lemon pudding would not taste like lemon to me, it would taste artificial, because it is. So I skipped that and used a fresh, homemade lemon curd instead, "Microwave Lemon Curd," also from this site.  Finally, I used real whipped cream rather than the Cool Whip.  My tastebuds were in heaven - this was goooood.  Creamy, lemony, buttery good. Even Hubs loved it - and the only thing he likes lemon with is fish!

OK-This recipe has such potential to be better than a five-with slight modifications.  I must agree with the rest - the lemon pudding itself was fake tasting and I too had to add lemon juice and lemon rind to kick it up to a nice lemon taste.  Now in doing that my lemon pudding got a little too runny and didn't set up as nice.  Next time I will add a little less liquid(in the milk/heavy cream) to compensate for the lemon juice.  To make the pudding mix layer itself I did use half heavy cream and half milk-because it makes the pudding soo much more rich and tasty.  I also used  fresh whipped cream (2cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip in chilled bowl with chilled wisk or paddles) instead of cool whip and it was awesome.  This really is such a great little recipe that is soo easy to make with such a nice combination of flavors-cream cheese,lemon and fresh whipped cream.  YUMMY!!  Don't pass it up-just make sure to add either the lemon juice or lemon extract if you have it.

I subbed in 2-15oz cans of lemon pie filling for the lemon pudding and this was awesome.  My Easter guests loved it-it's cool and refreshing.

This recipe isn't something I would have prepared for myself, because I don't like lemon pudding mix or Cool Whip, but I made it for my great-uncle who loves both. It was a huge hit with him. I'm not sure why people bother to make recipes full of ingredients they don't like, then write negative reviews. Create your own versions using ingredients you like, and then submit them for publication. This recipe is simple, inexpensive, and works great for people who enjoy the ingredients.

I have this same recipe and the lemon cheese cake is a definite show stopper. Except one thing, for the bottom crust I use 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts and 1 cup flour and 1 stick of butter. The rest is all the same and it is fantastic. I call a recipe like this, an Impressor. Guaranteed to impress.

This is a definite family request at our holiday get togethers and all our summer picnics!  It tastes just like a cool & creamy version of lemon meringue pie, but better  :)
I add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the cream cheese part and I also use confectioner's sugar instead of granulated.  Every once in a while I add a half of an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip to my cream cheese layer and cut back on my sugar. I also make sure to buy a couple of extra boxes of Lemon Pastry Creams from the Girl Scouts, because I crumple a few up to sprinkle over the top of the Cool Whip~yummy!

I prefer a graham cracker crust to lighten up this dessert. I also added 1/8 cup lemon juice to the lemon filling. My family enjoys tart desserts.
This is great, thanks for sharing Mrs. Kelly Z!

Oh baby! This was amazing! I used a Keebler Shortbread crust because I really didn't want to have the oven on when it's so hot, and this dessert was fabulous. I'm sure I'll experiment with different puddings, like other reviewers, but it will be hard to improve on the original. A definite keeper recipe!

Perfect for a summer day!!
I also made it with banana pudding and put sliced bananas on the crust before adding the pudding.
Also I cut all the ingredients in half and pout it into a 7x11 pan - it was perfect!!

This is excellent!  I used lite Cool Whip, low-fat cream cheese, & skim milk, and I also used 1 cup of ground walnuts in the crust.  Delicious!!

In favor of a crust that is not so plain, and more like a soft shortbread cookie, I had to make some adjustments. Cream together 1 Cup of butter, 1 egg, and 3/4 Cups sugar.  Then add your flour with 1/2 tsp baking powder.  The key is not to over bake it.  15 minutes @ 350 degrees tops.  Don't wait for it to get golden. You'll end up with a hard crust (unless that's your preference). I agreed with other reviewers that the pudding alone would not be enough to bring out the lemon taste.  I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice which gave it a subtle pucker to the palate.  My rating is based on the recipe as written. With these adjustments, it is a delicious five star dessert.

Wonderful!!!  I am still getting asked for the recipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner as an alternative for people who don't care for pies.  Everyone chose this over pies!  I made it with neufchatel cheese instead of full fat cream cheese, sugar free/fat free pudding with 1% milk and lite whipped topping.  It tasted so smooth and rich.  I would reccommend this for any occasion as well as any potluck since it will travel well too!

This was so delicious! I decided to make a graham cracker crust instead of a flour/butter crust and I also used a canned lemon pie filling instead of a pudding mix. Then I made some fresh whipped cream for the top, and wow. It was killer! It had that tartness I was looking for but the whipped cream and the cream cheese really cut the pie filling nicely. I ended up making several muffin-sized pies instead of one large pie because I thought it would be nice to have single portioned sizes for whenever. The rest of them we just kept in the freezer. This is a really yummy recipe! I will definitely be making it again soon!

I have made this for two different occasions and it is a huge hit!  Plus it is very simple to make.  (Although I make a simple graham-cracker crust instead of the crust on this recipe.)  Thanks!

What a light and impressive finish! And I love that it is made ahead of time and chilled - minimum fuss. I did have to add quite a bit of milk to the cream cheese mixture to make it spreadable - probably because I didn't allow time for the cream cheese to soften first. Also, although the crust was good, next time I might try buying a roll of sugar cookie dough and using that as my crust. I'm definitely adding this one to my recipe box!

I make a similar crust for a blueberry cheesecake, but use 1 !/2 cup flour, 1 cup coarsely ground pecans and 1/2 cup sugar, and pour in 1 stick melted butter, mix and bake about 20 min, or until golden.  The crust tastes wonderful and is like a cookie!!

The taste was excellent but it NEVER set up!  I cut back on the milk to add juice of 2 lemons, which it needs BADLY as the Jello lemon pudding just doesn't cut it!  But I think the citrus in the lemon juice breaks down the pudding.  Next time I'm going to put the lemon juice in the cream cheese mix or use lemon extract.  By the way why are all the pictures showing such a YELLOW filling for the pudding.  Jello Lemon Instant Pudding is definitely not that color!

Nice light tasting dessert. I would recommend cutting down on the milk as I found it set up better.  I also had trouble getting the cream cheese to spread.  It kept taking the crust layer with it.  I would use a different crust next time.

This was just an okay dessert to me, I expected so much more because a restaurant in my hometown has a lemon lush that is delicious and addictive! This tasted mostly artificial even after adding lemon extract to the pudding and some sugar for the crust. I probably will not try this again.

Great starter recipe.  Made it with the following changes:  1.  Used crust containing oatmeal from Lemon Cheesecake Squares (this site) for added crunch/fiber.  2.  Based on other reviews, I used cooked lemon pudding (replacing some of the water with the juice of 1/2 lemon and adding the grated peel from the whole lemon).  I wanted something light that actually tasted like lemons.  It was a HUGE hit!

My mother has been making this recipe since I was a little girl..it is delisious! Very light and yummy! The only modification I would suggest (that my mother does) is add some crushed walnuts to the crust batter...

TIP: MAKE THE CRUST.. as it is the best part of the recipe!

My neice and I made this recipe over the weekend, according to the recipe exactly. It was good! But, used a glass pan and the crust was so hard to get out of the pan when we served it. Should the pan have been greased? Any suggestion for next time? Thanks

Made mostly as called for and it was "de-lush." (I did add a handful of crushed pecans to the crust). Refreshing and dreamy!

I used the My-T-Fine lemon pie mix instead of the pudding it has alot more flavor than the regular pudding.  I also added 1/2 cup X-sugar and 1/2 cup chopped walnut to the crust and it was excellent.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We've made Chocolate Lush in my family, the chocolate version of this, for many years and it's always a hit.  (another one given to me by Mom)  There are a few slight differences, but not by much.  I never have any leftovers when bringing this dessert to a party!

Been making this for years. I use 1 1/2 cups of ground walnuts and 1/2 cup flour, instead of all flour and mix with my hand mixer or Kitchen Aid.  I use powder sugar instead of granulated. I top with chopped walnuts. This is always a HUGE hit wherever I take it and asked for at family functions. I know that this differs from the original recipe, which is great, but this is just another option.

A good summer dessert. I make this with lemon curd instead of instant pudding.

I've had this recipe for years and it has always been a hit, never any left in the pan.  It can be made, of course, with any flavor pudding.  I just made it for Easter with pistachio pudding (also good for St. Patrick's Day celebrations), and I have also used chocolate and butterscotch.  Never thought of banana, but it sounds yummy.  A few changes: My recipe calls for 3/4 cup of nuts in the crust which is an important part of the taste.  It also calls for confectioner's sugar instead of white sugar and 8 oz. of Cool Whip blended into the filling, as someone suggested.  The amount of milk for the pudding is listed as 3 cups, which keeps the pudding at a good consistency.  This is definitely worth trying!

Great dessert! I used lemon pie filling and added chopped walnuts to the crust, along with sprinkled over the top, like others suggested. Very light and refreshing! I'm looking forward to taking it to summer potlucks and BBQs.

I make this same recipe.  I use Chocolate , butterscotch & Pistachio puddings.  All are excellent.  Try different nuts with the crust to you liking.  MMMM a show stopper.

Being diabetic I changed the recipe. I used light butter, fat-free sugar free pudding, splenda, fat free cream cheese, 1% milk and fat free cool whip. I made one with lemon and one with chocolate. No one knew how low in calories it was plus I didnt have any to take home with me.

I've had this before under many different names.
And they have all been tasty; including this one.
I made a few tweaks to the recipe but none too complicated.

I added about a half-cup of powdered sugar to the crust; just to give it a little sweetness.

And I switched out the lemon pudding for butterscotch. I think any pudding will do. I've wager a can of fruit pie fulling would work too.

If I had thought ahead, I would have added walnuts to the crust and maybe a chopped handful on top.

I LOVE this recipe!  It's so easy and delicious, and it easily serves 12.  As other reviewers suggested I did add 1/4 c. sugar to the crust, and about 1 T. lemon juice and a little lemon zest to each of the cream cheese and the pudding layers, but it would probably be just as good without any extras. Thank you Mrs. Kellyz for this awesome recipe.

I made the recipe as written. I gave it 2 stars because it was eaten however not enjoyed. If the recipe were to be re-written with all the changes people have made then it could very well be worthy of a better review...just my 2 cents. I actually was kinda embarrassed to take it to the cook-out....sorry

I remember my grandmother making this when I was a child.  It was a favorite among everyone in the family and all of the church suppers she took it to.  The ingredients are just slightly different (powdered sugar in place of white sugar, sprinkle with chopped pecans), but the taste is the same.  You can also make this using chocolate pudding - sprinkle with chocolate chips or chocolate shavings to finish.   Thanks for bringing back some wonderful childhood memories!

Wow, for simplicity and ease of preparation I give it 5 stars!  For taste, I give it 5 stars!  Made this for my in-laws and they were fighting over the last bite.  Made per recipe, without adding additional lemon because they didn't have it at their house, but I could taste the lemon from the pudding.  It was SO good!

I was looking through my reviews today, and realized that I totally forgot to review this one. I made this for my 30th birthday party because I opted for a bunch of desserts instead of a cake. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except for following the advice of cyndi gephart (Thanks, Girl!), and adding some fresh lemon juice and fresh lemon zest for a more "authentic" lemon flavor. I think next time, I will try the lemon pie filling just to see if it tastes as good.  Everyone loved it and thought it was creamy goodness. I know it will become a new staple to our dessert table. Thanks for posting. :)

Made to specifications and it was a huge hit! Not having worked with pudding and jello mixes before, I was unaware that this would take Several hours to set.  It was suggested by my mother-in-law that when she adds fruit or anything else to jello and pudding mixes, it takes much longer. The recipe was incredibly rich and delicious. Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful recipe!  I substituted 2 ready-made graham cracker crusts for the flour crust - it doesn't get easier than that!  (t's also easy to cut in half this way). I've also tried it using chocolate pudding instead of the lemon and put shaved chocolate on top of the whipped topping.  Excellent!

This is a very rich and sweet dessert.  I loved the buttery crust with the creamy filling and topping.  Very child friendly.  I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 11 x 7 inch pan, and it worked great.  It was nice to not make a huge dessert when I was just making it for my family.  Reminded me of an Easter dessert.

My husband loves this. It's a nice, light tasting dessert. The lemon flavor is mellow, not sharply tart. A good potluck dish since it makes so much though it can easily be halved and made in a smaller pan.

Yum!!!  I made this for a family dinner one night, specifically for my lemon fanatic brother.  I used the graham cracker pie crust shortcut, hoping it would be as good as the reviews claimed...  everybody LOVED it and thought it came from a restaurant or bakery.  Later that night I caught my brother in the kitchen, hiding like a 10 year old (he's 25), finishing the pie off!

I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!! I used butterscotch pudding instead of lemon pudding. It was delicious. I think a graham craker crust would be just as good. Very easy to make. Great for a beginner like myself. I will definitely make this dessert again. Everyone loved it.

I wish I could give this dessert six stars. My husband and I love it. I'll be fixing this quite often. Like one viewer said, "It's better than lemon meringue pie". I followed the recipe exactly, except I let the crust get a dark golden brown, which took about 50 min. to bake in the heavy insulated pan I was using. Thank you so much for the recipe Mrs. Z.

This recipe has been one of our family favorites for years, though we sprinkle chopped walnuts on top and sometimes press some into the crust before baking. Try this recipe with other flavors of pudding as well. Pistachio makes a nice dish for Christmas, especially with a little red and green colored sugar sprinkled on top. Enjoy!

I cheated by using a ready made crust (Keebler's Oreo Cookie Crust) and received kudos for this dessert.  Extremely easy and very tasty, my guests asked to take some home!  This left my husband and I with one piece left to fight over! :)  Excellent pie to have on a summer's night!

've made this a million times, with different flavor fillings. the person who introduced me to this used cherry pie filling. it was delicious! My husband doesn't like cherries, so I never get that anymore. My favorite is lemon, which I now buy in the cans in the pie filling section. Tastes wonderful and texture is nice and thick.  

I've always folded in cool whip to the cream cheese / sugar mixture, then added the flavored topping and then added another layer of cool whip.

Flour and butter is the crust, and it's flat.Like a pie.  Not sure why some people complain about that. This isn't a cake.  I know people that add ground up pecans or sugar to the crust, but I don't. 

This is one of our all time favorite desserts. I've always called it and heard it called, sex in a pan. I know one person who calls it Possum Pie.  Regardless of what you call it, this is excellent any time of the year, and quick to make.

Recipe is good as is.  I've made one just like this for years with chocolate pudding and the crust always had pecans in it. So I purposely tweaked this recipe for a reason to my preference. In the crust I added 1 cup of chopped pecans. Left the cream cheese later as is. To the lemon layer, I only used 2 cups milk with the 2 boxes of pudding mix because I like to cut firm pieces when serving it up. Nothing takes away from the wonderful lemon flavor at all. And I make my whip topping from heavy whipping cream. Then topped with strawberries that needed to be used. Recipe as is, is still really good. I'm just very picky getting this dessert from baking dish to plate with out it looking like glop. Will make again

I have also made this and added chopped pecans to bottom crust which enhanced the crust flavor. Don't use Instant Pudding, USE Pudding you have to cook on the stove it makes all the difference.
I'm thinking of making this on a white cake, when out of the oven you cover with a t-towel and pat down to get out air which makes make it more dense then cool in refrigerator for at least 20 mins.then top with cream cheese, lemon and whipped cream.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my whole family really liked it. I did change the crust to a vanilla waffer crust. I used a little more than 1/2 a box vanilla waffers crushed, 1/2-3/4 stick butter melted, & 1/3 cup sugar. Mix together and press in bottom of dish then followed the recipes for the cream cheese, lemon pudding & cool whip topping. It was VERY GOOD! Will make again for sure. Would be good with banana, coconut, or vanilla puddings as well.

I've made this a bunch and everyone loves it! The crust is good but I am considering a graham cracker crust or a nilla crust for next time to spice it up a bit! It's a great refreshing summer dessert! YUM!

This was wonderful however I would suggest replacing some of the flour with confectioners sugar for the crust, as it's pretty much tasteless, the rest of it is awesome, yum.  I will be making this again and taking it to gatherings.  Great recipe.

Very good.  I also made one using choclate pudding instead of lemon pudding.  The crust can get hard if overcooked, and mine never seemed to get a nice shade of golden.

My men liked this so much here that they both had to get a second serving. This made 12 good sized portions. My husband liked this as much as pie, which it sort of is, just with a shortbread crust. Really good and super simple, just have to allow a little time between steps. I could see altering this with any flavor pudding and it would still be fantastic!

When I mentioned to my family that I made a lemony dessert no one seemed too excited-until they took their first bite!  We loved it!  The only change I made was adding about a 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract to the pudding. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.  This would be especially refreshing on a hot summer day.  I will make this again for sure!

This is the most delicious dessert. The blend of cream cheese and lemon is amazingly refreshing. Throw in the nutty crust and you have a winner.

I get many compliments when I make this simple dessert.  I like to make mine with a graham cracker crust.  The last time I made it I used Famous Amos Lemon Cookies for the crust then sprinkled the crumbs on top too.  It was delicious!

Just made this last night and everyone at work loved it.  I followed some suggestions of other reviewers and I used a graham cracker pie crust (the recipe was enough to fill 2 crusts).  In addition I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the cream cheese layer and one to the pudding layer, altho next time I may add 2-3 tablespoons as I prefer a more tart flavor.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

While I haven't made this particular recipe, I love my mother's recipe which is almost identical except that the crust is made with butter, flour and ground nuts.  Many of the reviewers here  have complained about the crust being tasteless.  Adding the nuts gives the crust a nice flavor.

I did not like the crust recipe given nor do I like fake lemon pudding. So I made a vanilla wafer crust (I used approximately 70 cookies, 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/3 cup sugar), I made my own lemon curd using the Microwave Lemon Curd recipe given on this site (super easy and absolutely scrumptious!), and I made real whipped cream using 2 cups heavy cream , 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Chill your bowls and beaters then beat ingredients until you have whipped cream. If you made this recipe as written, I think you would be happy if you like the taste of cool whip and boxed lemon pudding. But if you want to ratchet this recipe up several notches, try my modifications and see what you think. :)

My mom has been making this since I was little, but with a shortbread crust, butter flour, powdered sugar.  So, that is how I made mine. I also use powered sugar in my cream cheese,1/2 cup and you can vary all types of fillings. This time I used pistachio pudding, my husband's favorite.  Its a 5 star recipe if made like this!

I found this and since I love lemon pies I wanted to try it. I never did make it with the pudding, however. I made it using a simple lemon curd. I took it to my family reunion and brought back a licked clean dish! Will make again!

I added half a cup of white sugar to the dough which made a huge improvement. I would also say that the crust could stand to be about half as thick.

This was a huge hit! I did make a few changes, based on the other reviews I read. And I think they made it turn out perfect! I will definitely be making this again! 
I added a 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar to the flour and butter for the crust. And then I put a 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the pudding, and cut the milk down to 2 3/4 cup. Other reviewers mentioned the lemon pudding having a 'fake' taste, but with the lemon juice added in, I thought it was perfect and did not taste fake at all!

I took 1/4 cup of the sugar and added it to crust, and I added a squirt of Meyer lemon juice to both the cream cheese and the pudding, because, well, more lemon is always better! I am making this again tonight for a luncheon at work tomorrow, because I can't wait to share this! The added lemon juice kicks the flavor up, but some of the changes made by some of the reviewers on here qualify their concoction as an entirely new recipe!

Awesome desert!! I have made it for at least 20 years. A couple of things I do differently is add 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts to the crust. Also, I use powdered sugar with the cream cheese layer, makes it much smoother! I also make it with chocolate pudding or banana pudding with sliced bananas on top of the pudding layer. And with 7 children and 10 grandchildren...I double the recipe!!

I loved this, as did my guests. I took the suggestion on the crust and added some finely chopped toasted pecans.  I made a mistake while preparing it and only added 1 1/2 cups of milk to the pudding. After I realized this I need another layer so I purchased a can of Lemon pie filling and spread it over the lemon pudding layer. Topped it with fresh whipped cream and we ate every bit!!!

I made this for Memorial Day, and it was definitely a hit. I try to stay true to the original recipes, but with so many reviewers suggesting that the lemon flavor needed pumped up, I added a little lemon juice to the cream cheese layer, and also subbed some of the liquid in the pudding for the juice of one lemon. I only had cook and serve Jello pudding on hand, which calls for water instead of milk. I had no issues with it setting up, even though I added fresh lemon juice. Others said their Jello pudding was not as yellow as the photo, but cook and serve was that yellow. I can't speak for instant.

The one downfall of this recipe - the crust. Many asked what was in the crust, but I think they asked just because it was so bland. I assumed that the dessert itself would be sweet enough to balance out the lack of sugar, but without sugar the crust kind drew attention to itself. Next time I'll added a 1/2 cup of sugar to make more of a shortbread.

I thought it was great, especially on a hot day. The only changes I made, per other suggestions, was to add 1/2 chopped walnuts to the crust, 2 T. fresh squeezed lemon juice to the cream cheese layer, and substituted about 1/4 cup of the milk with 1/4 cup fresh squeeze lemon juice. I think the tartness made the day feel a bit cooler.Oh, I also used whole milk rather than the low fat milk that I normally use. I thought this would make it richer. Guests loved the final result.

This is so light and luscious. I added 1 T. sugar to the crust since I like slightly sweet crusts. It was baked in just 15 minutes. Following reviewers, I used confectioner's sugar in the cheese layer, which made for a very smooth taste, and added 1 T. lemon juice. I couldn't get lemon pudding, so I used vanilla, and subbed 2 T. of the milk for lemon juice (next time I'd use more), and 1 T. lemon rind. I skipped the whip - it was good already, it felt like gilding the lily.

Loved it,  I'm not a baker, so I just made it exactly how it was written, except to leave the crust in the oven a little longer than specified, just until light brown - makes it crunchy.    Recommend as a yummy, light-tasting desert in the summer time.

I made this today for my mother in laws birthday and it was a big hit! It's easy to make and not too sweet! I wanted to specifically address the crust, yes it is just flour and butter, I followed the recipe exactly and found the light crust to be really nice, like a regular flaky pie crust. It doesn't need extra sugar.

Since I have issues which make it difficult for me to stand in the kitchen cooking for any length of time, I look for recipes that I can make in "stages." This recipe fit nicely into that category and tasted yummy! 

I, too, made the crust with pecans, flour and butter and added lemon juice and zest to the cream cheese mixture. Definitely a winner!!

I have been making this dessert for years, and it always goes over very well.  I also make it and use chocolate puddding instead.  The only thing about using chocolate pudding is that you can't let it sit too long because the chocolate bleeds into the whipping cream, which isn't so bad really. Also after mixing the sugar and cream cheese, I fold in some cool whip and use the rest on the top and top with nuts.

It's a very sweet lemon recipe as opposed to a tart one. It's got a great texture, though, very creamy and good for summer.

I also used Pie Crust V instead of the one listed.

Very tasty summer dessert. Not sure why my crust didn't turn out very good. I cooked it for 25 minutes and let it cool and it was still really loose, almost like it wasn't cooked enough..... I added lemon juice to the lemon pudding to jazz it up a little bit. I would try using a sugar cookie type crust next time.

I have not made this exact recipe before, but it appears to be a variant of a dessert called Striped Delight (which is also found on allrecipes.com) that my family has made for years.  The concept is the same except you use chocolate pudding instead of lemon and can make the crust out of oreo crumbs.  This recipe is so versatile, you can use a number of different things for the crust, such as oreos, graham cracker crumbs, crushed gingersnaps, crushed nilla wafers...and different flavors of pudding.  I do definitely recommend using real whipping cream instead of cool-whip, and usually when I make it I add some of the whipped cream to the cream cheese layer to make it more spreadable.

This is a very good recipe, everyone seemed to really enjoy it, but I have to agree with others that the lemon pudding is too "fake" tasting and doesn't do this recipe justice.  The pudding wasn't lemon-y enough, but to fix that I added some lemon zest on top and that helped a lot.  What would bring this recipe to a fantastic, beyond five star recipe is to simply nix the pudding and instead do lemon pie filling.  I'm going to make my own next time and I think this will be an incredible recipe.

This recipe has a lot of possibilities...  I didn't really like the lemon puding, but you can use lemon pie filling and it is much better.  Also, you can use any different kind of pie filling for a change.  I add a little almond extract to the cream cheese mixture and use cherry pie filling, then sprinkle sliced almonds on top of the cool whip.  I have also used peach pie filling.  Very good, just use your imagination.

This is a great, refreshing dessert! I followed the recipe exact, and wish I had followed other reviewers and added some lemon extract or lemon juice to the pudding mixture. I will definitely do this the next time, because I would like it to be more tart, a stronger lemon flavor. Don't get me wrong, this is delicious as is, but it's very mild as lemon flavor goes. This has a lot potential, the pudding flavors could be changed, but keep the recipe the same. The crust in this is excellent, would work with chocolate pudding too. I would like to try lemon pie filling with this instead of pudding also. This recipe is a keeper, wonderful for the summer months..thank you! (:

This is a great and very versatile recipe.  I like to add some chopped almonds to the crust- gives it a slightly nutty flavor.

During the summertime I like to use banana pudding and the strawberry Kool-whip instead of lemon and vanilla.  You can play around with different flavors- and even different flavors of cream cheese as well.

Nice dessert. Will be served for summer picnics for sure. I did do as others stated and added lemon juice. I added about 1 1/2 TBSP. to the pudding mixture. And I'm glad I did.

I have made a version of this a couple of times-got it from recipezaar.com.  I used cook and serve pudding both times and it turned out great!  This is a highly addictive recipe!

I make this sometimes with vanilla and chocolate pudding.  Layering each in place of the lemon.  Very creamy and good.

I agree with ironcity amy, the lemon pudding tastes very fake.  The idea is good, but while this version is easy, I would rather put in more effort for a tastier result.  Thanks anyway.

This was wonderful! My bf loves lemon desserts and he said this was the best one he had ever had. I did cheat and use the graham cracker crust that others suggessted and added 2T lemon juice to the pudding layer. Delicious! Thanks!

An EXCELLENT summer dessert dish. Might also be good with banana flavors. I will be trying the suggestions of whole wheat flour and crushed pecans in the crust next time. With chocolate pudding it would what I know as "Robert Redford".

Yum!! 

I used ready-made graham crackers bases as I was short on time; reduced the quantity of all the remaining ingredients to 1/4 (and it came out perfectly); added fresh lemon juice and rind to the lemon filling; used fresh cream (whipped up) and garnished with sliced strawberries.

A delightfully cool dessert for the summer!

This was SO easy to fix and a huge hit at our office "fish fry".  I used whole wheat flour which actually added a nutty taste, along with fiber. I also used low fat cream cheese, fat free whipped topping and sugarless pudding.

I made a couple of changes based on the advice of other reviewers and this came out fabulous!  It was very delicious. To the crust I added 1/2 C of ground pecans and 1/2 C of light brown sugar. I also added 1 T of lemon juice to both the cream cheese layer and the pudding layer.  I will definately make this again.

The recipe was very good, but I expected it to be much more tangy.  Next time I will add lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture and lemon rind to the pudding.  I used a pre-made pie crust and it only took me about 5 minutes to make the whole thing!  (Half a recipe fit perfectly).

The best! I added 1/2 c chopped walnuts to the crust and 1 Tbs fresh lemon juice to the pudding, as suggested in other reviews.  I made it for a cookout and all of the men asked for seconds.  Lots of requests for the recipe. It is easy to make and delicious.  It's a winner.

Sounded good, but too bland. I had even added zest from lemon to the cream cheese layer. Think 1/2 cup brown sugar and chopped pecans would liven up the crust. Maybe some lemon juice in the cream cheese also. Lemon desserts need to be somewhat tart, and this is not

I made this for my Mom, who LOVES lemon desserts. She thought it was good, but had some nice suggestions which I'll try next time I make this: Add a little sugar to the crust, along with some lemon zest, and also a few teaspoons of fresh lemon juice to the pudding to give it a more tangy flavor. They sould like good ideas! It was a good dessert.  I scaled the recipe to 6 servings and made in a 7X11 dish. I did substitute heavy cream for the milk portion to give the pudding a richer taste and it was GOOD! Everyone thought it was a nice, light, fresh dessert!

We made this using homemade lemon filling in place of the lemon pudding and it was sooo good. The only other thing is the crust, its perfect but a little too much.  I think next time I will halve the crust. A great formula for so many different ideas (ie a chocolate filling in place of the lemon or some other kind of fruit thing..., etc)

EXCELLENT! I had to make a few adjustments though. I was out of flour but I did have a single graham cracker crust in the pantry. I half all the ingredients and followed the rest of the directions for layering. It came out fabulous and was much more size proportionate for my family. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very cool, creamy and refreshing.  Next time, I think I would add some fresh lemon juice in the pudding to give it a little more tartness, and use less Cool Whip.  But, to each their own taste. Thanks for sharing, Ms. Kelly Z!

This is my favorite go to summer dessert.  I make with a few modifications.  I add a cup of finely chopped nuts to the flour mixture (walnuts, pecans or almonds) whichever I have available.  I also substitute powder sugar  for the white sugar with the cream cheese and 1/2 a container of cool whip.  Everything else I follow as instructed.  Love this easy light layered dessert.

My mom made something like this every summer.
She added walnuts to the base, and also made two batches, using vanilla and chocolate pudding for each...yum!
We also put leftovers in the freezer, and would eat it while still "frosty".
Thanks for bringing back wonderful memories!

I made this for our neighborhood Christmas Party.  I did modify it a bit.  I used Jell-O Cook & Serve Lemon Pudding & Pie Filling instead of the Pudding in the recipe.  I also used real whipped cream to which I only added a pit of confectioners sugar.
It was the hit of the party even though the recipe suggests it's good for a summer picnic, it was wonderfully refreshing at the Christmas Party

This is the best recipe ever AND I've tried different versions.  I made the lemon one first (everybody loved it).  Then I used canned cherry pie filling instead of the lemon pudding (everyone loved it).  This week, I'm going to use chocolate pudding instead of the lemon pudding.  Next, as someone suggested, I'm going to try the bananas and banana pudding.  I do admit, though, that I used real whipped cream on top instead of the Cool Whip - not that I'm adversed to Cool Whip, but I had real whip cream on hand.  Also, for the fun of it, I tried using half almond flour and half regular flour - it was good but the cream cheese was really hard to spread because crust kept crumbling so it may not have been a good idea :)

Such a simple recipe and absolutely delicious! Made one for work and it was completely gone by the end of the day. It's not overly sweet and has a very light taste to it. I threw some strawberries on the top just to add something extra. Planning to make it for the 4th and put blueberries and strawberries on top!

My Grandmother used to make this except she would use one box of chocolate pudding and one box of vanilla pudding then spread them half and half in the pan... She would also use chopped walnuts in the crust. Best dessert ever. && I suggest using the chocolate & vanilla pudding and not the lemon.

This should be made in a 10x14, it tastes so much better that way.  The crust is too thick in a 9x13 and you barely have room for the whipped topping.  Also, softening the butter makes a mess!  It doesn't go into the pan easily, and sticks to the sides.  Instead, use cold hard butter with a pastry cutter.

Great hit on Easter Sunday, the only thing that I did different, was I did not cover the top with cool whip until serving I also offered whipped cream instead. I stays fresher longer without the cool whip or whipped creme.

I used chocolate pudding and real whip cream. It was very good. I am thinking of trying it with 1 3/4 cup of confectionery sugar instead of the granulated sugar. The only problem with this recipe is it's hard to stop eating it.

I followed the recipe almost but did substitute a homemade graham cracker crust and added lemon zest to both the cream cheese & pudding layers.  I found that it was still not tart enough for me and had a "boxed" taste.  I may have had my hopes set too high for this but it failed to deliver.  If you like the taste of boxed lemon pudding and are not looking for something tart then you may like this recipe.  I, like another reviewer, give them 5 stars for the idea but the delivery failed miserably.  I am glad I only made 1/2 the recipe so not as much to toss.  I doubt the shortbread crust would have made any difference or that the addition of lemon zest "ruined" the recipe.

this is a favorite of mine.  But I did change the recipe to my taste. I use cook and serve pudding mix. Follow the directions for pie and then let it cool.  the cream cheese I use powdered sugar, 1/8 cup of lemon juice , and the cool whip.  For the crust I used chopped walnuts added to my flour and butter.  this really makes a person think they are having lemon pie :)

agreed with most others - great potential.  Add lemon juice and zest to pudding mix (decrease milk slightly).  I froze the recipe for several hours before addin g real whipped cream.  Was a big hit!

It was great with homemade lemon pie filling.  I made half the recipe in an 8 X 8 pan.  I'm a fan of made from scratch, so I used a recipe for lemon pie filling (for one pie) and lemons right off our tree.  It made too much lemon layer and drowned the cream cheese flavor.  Next time I'll make half the lemon filling for a better balance.  It was delicious anyway!!!  I also worked with cold, cubed butter and put it and the flour in a food processor, pulsing until it was like small peas.

Tasteless crust, boxed pudding mix even brand name, lacked true lemon flavor. This recipe is a flop, the picture is lovely though.

This recipe has been in our family since I was a teen, and now my kids LOVE it! Really, no changes needed. The buttery crust keeps it from being TOO sweet. In the summer, this is a MUST for BBQs and gatherings...and we'll even cheat and have leftovers for breakfast!

I really liked this. It reminded me of a lemon cream pie. I halved the ingredients and put it in a square glass dish instead of a rectangular dish. I think it could also be made in a round pie pan and cut into wedges and served that way, too. I made it as is and loved the taste, but I can see how it could be made better with a few changes. I would keep the crust the same (it was buttery and crunchy and I loved it) but add some lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture, some lemon juice to the pudding layer and top with real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip.

I made this for "Easter Eve" dinner - oh so good and oh so rich!! This was a recipe for 12 that I cut in half and made in an 8 x 8 baking dish. I cut it into 9 pieces and they were plenty big because of the richness. I used light cream cheese and whipped topping as well as skim milk to lighten it up. Next time I would use less sugar.

I have made this several times using a graham cracker crust as some other reviewers suggested.  Halved the recipe yesterday to make as a Thanksgiving treat for an elderly neighbor.  She said it was the best lemon "pie" she had ever tasted.  Thanks for sharing, MRS.KELLYZ.

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I did follow the recipe exactly although I did scale it down to half a recipe because it was just the two of us eating it.  I will definitely make this again and I think I will follow other's suggestions of adding a little chopped nuts to the crust and adding a little extra lemon juice to the pudding because I love lemon!

Sorry guys I was disappointed.  I was looking so forward to trying it but it was just ok.  I followed other suggestions to add fresh lemon in with the pudding and cream cheese, I'm sure it made a difference but it was not a hit in my household.

This was a little rich for me. I did not care very much for the crust, but it was overall pretty good. I might try it again with banana pudding and sliced bananas instead of lemon pudding.

This is my favorite dessert, the one my grandma used to always make for me. What she would do is add chopped nuts in the crust and also chopped nuts in the topping.  It's really good with nuts.

Delicious! I didn't have lemon pudding but did have vanilla so reduced the milk and added some lemon juice, tasted extremely lemony so probably used too much. What I like about it is that you can probably use any flavor pudding you like and have a different dessert. I also made my own whip cream for the top.

Ahh, what memories this recipe brings me.  I have made a version of this.  I use chopped walnuts in the crust.  For the cream chesse mix, I add in Cool Whip and powdered sugar.  Talk about hurting yourself!

Based on the other reviews, I used homemade lemon and a graham cracker pie crust, and it was fantastic (and homemade lemon pudding is surprisingly fast and easy to make). My coworkers and I had this eaten in less than 30 minutes!

This was a huge hit with my two grandkids.  They helped make it and really think it tastes good too.  I took bragabit's suggestion and made it with vanilla and chocolate layered instant pudding.  I also topped the whipped topping with toasted cocount and pecans.  Very-very good.  I look forward trying the lemon pudding mix.  Thanks

I had never had lemon pudding before.  It was very fake tasting- I guess because it is artificial lemon flavoring.  This ruined the dessert for me.  Good idea though- maybe I'll find a more natural lemon filling for next time.

I had Lemon Lush at a southern Tea Room and fell in love.  To make things easier I split the recipe in half and use a premade graham crust or make two.  I've also tried this with chocolate/coconut puddings.  Delicious.

Definitely needs more flavor and a better crust.  Although it was simple I would not make again.  My husband thought it was OK.

I made this for Easter and it was a big hit.  Next time I will make real whipped cream instead of using whipped topping.

This is the best dessert recipe I have ever made!  I made it for Easter dinner and everyone raved.  People were asking for leftovers two days later (but it was long gone)!  It was so easy and the payoff is huge.  This will be a holiday staple in my house from now on.

Pretty good, made this for Easter, used fat free whipped topping, cream cheese and skim milk. I halved the recipe (still used whole container of cool whip though) and baked the crust in a 10" tart pan.

I used graham cracker crust instead of flour one. VERY much like lemon cheesecake...only square. Family LOVED it!

I've always loved lemon desserts and this one comes through with flying colors.  My neighbor always eats my desserts and said this has been his favorite one yet.  After 3 years and countless desserts that is really saying something.  Thank you for the recipe.

I modified this recipe by adding pecans to the base.  It was delicious.  A friend's sister makes this with almonds and chocolate pudding and it is equally good.  I also prefer cooked pudding over instant, it seems like the flavor is better.
