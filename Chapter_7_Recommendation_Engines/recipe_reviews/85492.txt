the taste of this is awesome!  I don't trust myself with a broiler, so I sauteed the porkchops in the butter and onions until cooked through, and then baked them in the oven with the topping added on 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  I also added twice the sourkraut and sour cream.  Will definately make this again.

Your recipe is on the mark - this one I didn't change a thing - other than cutting it in half since I was only cooking two chops.  It can be made in no time - while the chops are broiling you can easily put together the topping. I used a good quality sauerkraut which I believe gave it an extra kick. I would serve this to company - it has an elegant look.  Appelsauce on the side and the potato and vegetable of your choice!   Thanks submitter!

Absolutely delicious.  Don't change anything - you might even want to double the sauce!  We both LOVED this recipe!  Oh! Almost forgot DO pound thicker chops down or buy thin ones as our super thick Costco chops had to go back into the oven.

DELICIOUS recipe!!! I did make some changes, I brushed a bit of mustard on each chop before baking and when I sauteed the onions I added 1/2 tsp of sugar to caramelize the onions. It turned out great!, we loved it, thanks!

I grilled my chops and then put on the mixture and broiled them for a few minutes. I also added a little parmesan cheese to the mixture. Excellant definitely a keeper.

This is an outstanding recipe, so simply but so delicious.  I made it a Christmas time for company and they all loved it, I've not made it since although I will again this holiday.  I'm craving it.  Be sure to use boneless chops though.

This was a delectable dish. We followed the recipe without changes. The Sauerkraut used was a European type, a bit milder than most. We purchase it from an international market. Brand Name "SMAK" imported from Poland. The various ingridients blended beautifully. This dish definitely will become one of our favorites. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great pork chop recipe.I wasn't sure about the combo of flavors, but it was very good. My young kids wanted saurkraut and onions  taken off, but my husband and I loved it. I browned the chops in the pan after carmelizing the onions instead of broiling. Will make again.

I made one serving of this with a 1/2 pound bone-in pork chop (5/8 inch thick) from which I had the butcher trim off most of the fat. I seasoned the pork chop on both sides with black pepper, garlic, salt and smoked paprika.  Then I broiled for 8 minutes, flipped, then broiled for 7 additional minutes.  Then I added the wonderful sauce and broiled for 3 minutes longer.  I made the sauce by cooking the onions in butter and a little sugar until lightly caramelized, then adding this to a bowl with 2 tablespoons sauerkraut, 2 tablespoons sour cream and about 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika.  The sauce was about one inch thick covering the entire pork chop.  Oh my, was this ever tasty.  This is easy, quick and has a wonderful flavor.  I do recommend using smoked paprika.  Thank you DRLMCOBB for a very nice recipe.

I usually hesitate to broil pork chops as they come out as dry as hockey pucks.  This was wonderful!  They were done perfectly and I followed the recipe to the letter.  (OK so I used a bit more sour cream and sourkraut, but that gave me "extra" for the plates.) Super Wonder Husband loved this dish!

The recipe was ok.  I followed it exactly, except I doubled the sauce.  The kids wouldn't touch it, my husband said it was "unique" and I was simply not overly impressed.  Broiling the chops made them too tough as well. This seem like it would almost be better if the chops were browned and then finished off in a casserole or a crock pot.

I was skeptical when I read this recipe.  In the end it was very tasty.  I eyed the spices for the pork chop (I might have used a little more salt) then followed the rest of the recipe.  Even my 4 and 6 year olds ate it.

This was a nice change from the standard pork chop.  It's a great starter recipe for those that aren't real sure about sauerkraut.  The sour cream, onions, and paprika do a nice job of reducing the tartness in the sauerkraut, making it barely noticeable.

This was pretty good.  The chops had a distinctly German flavor to them, if ignoring the paprika.  The paprika did not overpower the other flavors, as might have been expected.  I'm not a great cook, so I like to find recipes that are not incredibly complex and don't require going to the store for.  This was nice because I already had all the items handy, it was quick and easy, and even a klutz like myself was able to make it when my fiancee was too tired for cooking.

This recipe didn't sound overwhelming, but the reviews convinced me to try it and IT WAS DELICIOUS. The only thing I tweaked was the garlic salt. I loathe the strong salt flavor of garlic salt, so I used garlic powder instead. I'm already pondering what other foods I could put the sour cream mixture on...

This was so easy and very good!   I had to make a few changes.  I did 1 tsp. butter and 1 tsp. olive oil.   Instead of seasoning the pork chops as indicated, I used Paul Prudhomme Pork and Veal Magic and kosher salt.  Since I discovered I was out of sour cream, I used fat free Greek yogurt instead, which worked just fine.  Finally, after topping the chops with the kraut, I srinkled them with 1/2 tsp. caraway seeds each before broiling.  It was absolutely wonderful.

This was so easy and so tasty! My husband I though the topping tasted like sour cream and onion potato chips, which is a good think. I thought they were even better the next day.  This may seem silly to say, but I would definitely recommend using boneless porkchops. I used bone-in chops, and it was hard to figure out where to cut them with the topping covering them up!

I have to say the recipe by itself gets a four, but the way i cooked it gets  a three!  :)  I'm not too good at broiling, so mine were overdone.  Also, the topping has a decidedly orange color, which made my husband hope for a spicy dish.  This had a good flavor, but be careful and do not use chops that are too thick or too thin (like I did).  Also, I used the sauerkraut that has caraway seeds in it, nice touch.

I followed this recipe as is, but was using only 2 pork chops, so wasn't worried about needing extra sauce.  My husband really liked it.  I thought it was ok, but nothing special. I could taste the onion a decent amount; the sauerkraut just seemed to add texture. Do be careful broiling so you don't dry out the chops.  I probably won't make it again since my hubby isn't a big pork fan anyway, and if I am going to get stuck with leftovers, I would rather it be something like honey dijon basted pork chops.

Very good. An easy way to dress up pork chops with flavors that compliment and don't override the flavor of the meat. Something just a little different than the run-of-the-mill pork chop recipes out there.

This was a delicious way to prepare pork chops.  Basic ingredients and quick prep time make this recipe one to keep.  My husband and I will definitely make it again.

Excellent flavor.  I thought they were a little salty so I might cut back on the garlic salt, but otherwise an excellent recipe.

Unusual combination of ingredients, that actual come together nicely.  Worked well with pork loin chops. Make extra kraut mixture for topping.

Oh...My...Goodness.  I REALLY liked this recipe. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt...I don't use much salt.  And I only had 3 pork chops...I think if I had more I might double the sauce b/c it is so good. I also used bone-in pork chops b/c that is what I had. I am going to write this in my recipe book as soon as I finish this review. Finally a pork chop recipe that tastes unique!

Perfect!  The sauerkraut mixture sounded strange but I made it exactly as written and it was awesome! I could probably pass this off as something else and fool my non-kraut eating kids & grandkids.  Very good recipe...will certainly make again and double the kraut mixture!

My wife, who is not a big sauerkraut fan, loved this.  I also thought that it was very good and difference than the same old, same old.  

I added extra sauerkraut, garlic, and sage.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe relatively closely.

These were good. I also spread the chops with mustard when rubbing with paprika. The sauce was good but much thicker than I thought. I had expected it to form a gravy to serve over mashed potatoes. Still very good though. I also served a pea and green bean salad for a light side.

I ORIGINALLY SAW THIS RECIPE IN MY LOW CARB COMFORT COOKBOOK AND WANTED TO MAKE IT AND FORGOT ABOUT IT UNTIL SOMEONE POSTED IT HERE AND REMINDED ME- BUT... I WOULDN'T MAKE IT AGAIN- MY SON SCRAPED OFF THE TOP AND MY HUSBAND WHO LOVES SAUERKRAUT SAID NOT TO MAKE IT AGAIN- WAY TOO MUCH "TWANG"- THE PORK CHOP WAS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT BECAUSE THE TOP WAS OVERPOWERING- YOU COULD NOT TASTE IT- THIS IS PERSONAL TASTE AND OPINION- IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU BUT I WOULD TRY IT BEFORE I FED IT TO COMPANY- THANKS

This turned out great! I was hesitant about broiling the chops because I thought they would overcook and be dry, but they weren't. The pork chops themselves were quite moist and tender, and the topping was excellent. It had a nice German flair to it with the sauerkraut. A great new dish!

Very good! Pork Chops and Saurekraut go very well together. For this recipe, I made a small adjustment to the method of cooking. I cooked the saurekraut with some of it's juice untill a golden colour with the onions and then added some paprika. (I allowed it to cool a little before adding the sour cream). This is so good.

Very easy to make a quite tasty. The onion and sauerkraut mixture can also be used with many other meats. I added more paprika in the mixture instead of on the chops.

I saw this recipe and wanted to do it but didn't have pork chops on hand so I used it for chicken breasts!  I pan fried the chicken with the seasonings then broiled them 3 minutes with the onion and sauerkraut topping.  Really good!

I loved this.  It is now my favorite way to cook pork chops.  The texture was great and the flavors went really well with the pork.  We baked instead of broiled and it was still quick and easy.

I used about 1/2 of an onion and 3 pork chops, otherwise followed directions exactly.  This was delicious!! I am usually not a huge fan of pork, but this was perfectly cooked with an excellent flavor.  I think it would still  be good if you didn't have sauerkraut in you pantry.

This was an excellent recipe, both in terms of quick preparation and taste. The ingredients are all the things we love, and the finished meal was a delicious blend of them. Done in 15 minutes too!

This combo sounded really strange but decided to try it anyway.  Tasted really good but might add a little more sour cream since the topping was just a little dry.  Don't skimp on the paprika.

These were DELICIOUS!  I made them almost exactly as written.  I didn't measure the spices that I sprinkled on the pork chops, but I tried to eyeball them.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  We will definitely be making these again and again!

Tried these last night and they were excellent!  I really liked how the boneless pork chops stayed juicy.  Ingredients are strange (as noted in another review) but oh so tasty when combined in this recipe!  Try it!  You'll like it!

This was wonderful.  A suggestion for those who use ordinary canned sauerkraut like me - you need to rinse the sauerkraut two or three times and let it drain.  You can taste it right out of the can and then rinse it until you feel it's not too salty and sour.  If you do this your recipe will turn out great just as mine did.  Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding!  Reminds me of some of the wonderful dishes I had in Hungary.  European sauerkraut is different - milder, less pickled - so next time I'll try to find some as one reviewer suggested.  That'll give it an even more authentic taste.

Nice change for the other white meat. I used Penzeys brand "half sharp" paprika. The BF loved it and even ate the leftovers the next day. I will make this again and plan to make the seasoning for the chops into a dry rub and let them sit for a few hours. This recipe is a good way to use up sauerkraut left over from Rueben sandwiches.

Delicious, but only as leftovers when the flavors have had a chance to mingle and the sour cream flavor gets mellower.  I didn't like it at first.  I looked the chops entirely on the stove, adding the sauce after the first side was done.

This was amazing!  I love how fast the chops cooked under the broiler, I don't think I'll do it any other way from now on - they were perfect!  My only recommendation would be to sautee the onions for about 5 minutes until they start to get soft and then add the sauerkraut and cook that for about 15 minutes on medium heat, adding a little more butter until it's a light golden brown color.  To me using sauerkraut right out of the jar is like eating it raw.  Cooking it softens it and gives it a great flavour.

I was so surprised at how much I liked this recipe! I'm not a huge sauerkraut person, but my fiance is and we both really enjoyed it. We don't like onions, so I skipped that, just added a pinch of onion powder instead. I also added a healthy shake of parmesan cheese to the mixture as well. Chops were flavorful and juicy and the topping was perfect. Very good, I'll be making this again. Thank you!

We cooked these chops on the grill and added the sauerkraut/sour cream mixture to the chops right on the grill.  Also, we left the bone in the chops, which made us have to scrape off the cream mixture to cut around the bone to eat.  So, do as the recipe says and use boneless chops.  Also, I recommend using full-fat sour cream, bc I used light and it was slightly bitter.  
Yummy recipe!

I was looking to do something new for some pork chops and found this recipe. I happened to have some really good, natural sauerkraut (without vinegar), creme fraiche (instead of sour cream), and an onion. I did have to broil my chops a little longer as they were thicker. But everything tasted wonderful together. I served it along with some heirloom tomato slices sprinkled with lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. Even my husband who doesn't like sauerkraut loved it! This is definitely a keeper, and I'll be making it again soon. Thanks again for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed these tender and tasty pork chops.  As for the rest of my family......NOT!  Too bad I'm the only one who enjoys saurkraut.  It was easy enough to make that I could probably just make one for me and serve the chops a different way for the rest of them.

We think this recipe is VERY good! I did use thin sliced pork, though, and cooked it stovetop in a frying pan. Then I mixed all of the paprika, garlic salt, and black pepper together and seasoned the pork with some of it. I put the rest of the spice mixture into the sauerkraut mixture. I spread the pork with the sauerkraut topping and let it simmer in the pan.

With my vegetarian husband away for the evening, I decided to make myself this recipe. WOW! I loved this. I made sure to double the sauce and use it on egg noodles! YUM, Thanks for the great recipe.  And to give more credit, my veggie husband came home and said the house smelled good!!

I gave these pork chops a try last night for dinner. With the other great reviews on here I was extremely optimistic.
I pretty much followed this recipe word for word. The only thing I did different was I rubbed the chops with mustard and browned the onions beforehand like another user suggested. I also did not use the broiler as I don't like doing meat that way. I quickly browned the chops in a frying pan and then placed it in the oven for 10 minutes with the sour cream/sauerkraut topping.
I served it with potatoes and bacon and garlic green beans.
Well, the whole family was disappointed with the results. My husband and I found it way too bland. The kids wouldn't touch it until I scraped everything off and they just had a plain chop.
Since we are an Austrian family we thought we would enjoy this recipe since it had sour cream and sauerkraut (two things we, including the kids, eat often). But, it was just not flavorful enough.
My husband and I both agreed that it should get an average rating hence the three. It was not down right awful and we both could eat it if we had to. But, definitely not something that will be going in our recipe box to use again unfortunately.

Made this for New Years Day.Very good!!
As suggested by others,I made extra sauce
and added parmesan cheese.
In the future,I will broil the sauce topped chops longer than 2 or 3 minutes.
A keeper.

This was good. Will make it aging. I gilled the chops and it worked fine. Cheese might be good on this may try using it some time.

This was HORRIBLE to me! My 9 year old niece loved it, however. I guess it is a matter of taste. I will pass this recipe on to her mom if requested because I certainly won't be trying it again!

The combination of sour cream & sauerkraut was a little strange for me.  I love both individually, but was not impressed by the combination.  My boyfriend loved it, though.  I seem to find that the guys love saucier dishes....so I think that this is definitely a pleaser with males.....Just a thought... :-)

This is so good.  And the sauerkraut wasn't overwhelming, it just added a lot of flavor.  Very good.  Juicy pork chops.

Being a big sauerkraut fan, I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  It didn't disappoint me.  I loved the combination of flavors and it was so easy to make.  As one reviewer suggested, I did carmelize the onions before adding to the sauce (so yummy!).  What a great way to cook pork chops...thanks!

This works if your broiling,frying,grilling or baking the chops. What makes this wonderful is the sauerkraut spread.

This was awesome! So easy and quick to make. pork chops were tender and moist. I doubled the amount of sauerkraut, sour cream and paprika since I figured it would be like a side veggie. And I used smoked Paprika which increased it's deliciousness. I will definitely be making this again as well as sharing it with friends. Thank you DRLMCOBB

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover sauerkraut and came across this recipe.  I made it exactly as written, except I used smoked paprika because that is all I had on hand.  We really liked it.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the flavors are fairly mild and I think broiling the chop dried it out a little more than I would like.  Next time I'll just bake it to lock in some of the juices and only broil after adding the topping.

Excellent and so easy.  The sauerkraut and sour cream sauce is the perfect blend of flavors and created nice moisture for the pork.  The only change I made was to use smoked paprika.  Will definitely make again.

I made this and loved it!  Pretty much stuck to the recipe but added about a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to the topping at the suggestion of another reviewer. This added a slight bite that it needed because I used Bavarian style sauerkraut (it's what I had) so it cut the sweetness down a bit. Husband liked it and said don't change a thing. I only had very thin sliced pork chops also.  Next time I'll use thicker ones because the sauce was arguably a little overpowering with such thin chops. But the sauce was so yummy that I really didn't mind. In fact I ate more than my share straight out of the bowl while preparing it. Wondering what else I can put this delicious concoction on top of?!?  This is an unexpected winner!!

Made it exactly as written. Very mild tasting, even with smoked paprika.  I was expecting something a little more tangy, with the sauerkraut. My husband gave this a 7 out of 10, I gave it a 5.  Good, but nothing special. Be careful with the broiling directions - the times given must be for very thick chops. Our chops ended up dry and a little overcooked, even with relatively thick butterflied pork chops.

Excellent recipe. Quick, easy & elegant. The ingredients are usually always there in my kitchen.  I followed the recipe to the tee & we loved it! Will definitely make it again. Next time i might add a dash of cayenne pepper, though, because we like a little heat. Thank you for sharing it!

I pretty much followed this recipe to the letter, but the spread over the pork chops had a weird texture and was just a bit too tangy for our family's taste.

I didn't broil it, I just baked it at 450 and swapped out the sour cream for plain yogurt. This will be one of the dishes I continue to make in the future. It's simple, easy and flavorful. Loved it.

this was so quick and easy... and YUMMY!  for some reason i thought it called for whole can of sauerkraut (I used bavarian)...so i drained and mixed a whole can but used all other ingredients as called for --it was great...piled high on the pork chops.

We all loved it!  Even the picky 6 yr old and 3 yr old.  I will say I scraped off the topping before cutting it up for them... But they cleaned their plates.  The hubbie and I really enjoyed it.... And I'm hiding the left overs for me!   I did slightly cut back on the garlic salt and added a bit of garlic powder to reduce sodium....  Slightly.  Followed the rest to a T!  Yumm.  YUMM!!!

This was perfect.  I followed directions as printed.  The only ingredient I had to buy was a can of sauerkraut.  I served with rice and asparagus.  Very easy and my husband and I loved it!

Made by the recipe, except that I didn't measure the seasonings I shook onto the chops (I think I was close though).  The best pork chops I have made so far!  The flavors came together wonderfully, it was reminiscent of a good German dinner.  This one will be a new "usual!"

Not as good as it sounded. I thought it would be very flavorful and was disappointed. Just extra calories. Husband actually scraped it off! (He'll eat kraut straight from the can so this says a lot)

Wow - what a fantastic surprise this recipe was!  I was skeptical at first, as I'm not a big sauerkraut fan.  HOWEVER.. these chops were awesome!  I should have listened to other reviewers who said they would make more topping... wish I had!  The only thing I did different is that I brined the chops first, then grilled them instead of broiling.  Cooked until almost done, then finished under the broiler.  Rave reviews from all who enjoyed with me.  Will make again and again!

Made this for the first time last night and was a little leery because I only had a can of cheap sauerkraut, but it turned out wonderfully.  My chops were really thick so I did cook them at little in the skillet before putting them on the broiler.  They came out of the oven with a beautiful appearance and great flavor!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

it took much longer to cook than what it says on the recipe but i think that's because my chops were still slightly frozen when i put em in. The topping didn't have a powerful flavor but i kind of liked it that way because you could still taste the pork, all in all a delicious recipe to use if i had leftover sauerkraut, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it again, got rave reviews from the family though!

These are pretty good...aside from the broiler setting my fire alarm off!  The sauerkraut mixture is delicious and a nice change from regular pork chops and sauerkraut.

SO EASY!  I followed the recipe almost exactly... i prefer more saurkraut, so I added about a 1/6 cup more.  I also made only 2 servings, and it still turned out great.  Loved it!

This is really quite good!  I only make two chops, but use the full recipe for the topping.  I started using garlic powder instead of garlic salt since the sauerkraut is already pretty salty.  I usually use bone-in chops since they're less easy for me to overcook.

Ok - I was a little dissapointed with this recipe.  I just wasn't crazy about the saurkraut, sour cream and onion combo.  I really liked the onions plain!  And the Pork chops would have been good with just the garlic salt, paprika and pepper on them.  This recipe just didn't do it for me - the flavors just didn't "mingle" - and I will not be making this again. I gave it 2 stars because the pork chops would have been great with just the spices and not the mixture......... Sorry!

Wow!  This is the first time I've broiled pork chops - and they turned out fantastic.  Only change was to double the sour cream and sauerkraut as per another reviewer's suggestion.  Even the picky 2 year old gobbled it up!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  He likes sauerkraut a lot so Following other thought this would be a nice change of pace from my usual pork chop recipes.  Following the other reviews, I made a bit extra sauce which we were happy to have.  I never cook with full fat anything, so I used fat free sour cream and it still came out delicious.  The next time we have homemade pierogies we will have these porkchops rather than the kielbasa we usually have.  Thanks for the great different recipe!

I thought it was ok, the pork needed the sourkraut with it because the pork by itself was really bland.  My husband didn't care for it because he doesn't like the strong sourkraut flavor.

Did not like this at all, BUT I had to leave out the onions because my husband is sensitive to them, so that may be part of the reason it wasn't very good.  I'm a sour cream fan, but it just didn't taste good to me.

My husband loved these pork chops.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 1 boneless and 1 bone-in.  Both were moist and juicy.  I broiled the bone-in chop for 8 minutes each side, because it was thicker.  I definitely will make this again and again. Anyone who thinks they don't like sauerkraut should give these chops a chance.

For a different kick on this, or if you don't like saurkraut, try using mushrooms!  I just made this tonight and threw some fresh sliced mushrooms in to sautee with the onions and cut back on the sourcream & added half a can of cream of mushroom.  Less kick then the original but very smooth, creamy, & tasty!!
