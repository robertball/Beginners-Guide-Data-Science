I thought this was awful. It took awhile to cook and was so bland. My husband wouldn't even eat it!! That says it all right there. To salvage it, I added parm. cheese, tomato sauce and a lot of Italian seasonings.

I thought this was excellent.  Made a few minor changes, mostly to use what I had in the house.  I substituted wide egg noodles for the macaroni.  Didn't have Verdelho, so I used an open bottle of cab that I had.  Substituted fresh spinach (6 oz) for canned because I like the taste better, added a second can of tuna and used cream in place of milk because I wanted to use it up and thought it would be good.  I also had french fried onions that I used in place of bread crumbs.  Despite the substitutions (which I don't think changed the flavor all that much), I think this is a great basic recipe that adds more flavor and veggies to a traditional tuna noodle casserole.  You can really add any veggies you want to this- I think it would be good with onions, corn, peas, etc.

This was okay. I used rotini pasta instead of elbow macaroni and regular bread crumbs instead of toasted bread. I added more ricotta to make it a bit creamier. I might make this again, but I probably would not add the spinach. It doesn't really need it.

I've never been a tuna cassarole fan, but this was pretty tasty.  I didn't have, and therefore didn't use, any wine, and this recipe still turned out.

at first my friend was nice and said it was good= then told me later it was not as great when she was trying to digest it... It smelled so bad I didnt want to eat it.... the mushrooms and spinach really dont do much for it.
