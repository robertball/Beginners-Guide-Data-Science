I have been using this recipe for cakes for many years, I got the recipe from my grandmother. It is a very tasty icing, simple to make, and holds well...as long as the humidity isn't high.  It should never be stored in the fridge, either.  This icing will turn grainy (sugary) in either extreme.

This is way too sweet to use as a frosting for just an everyday cake.  I will find my grandmother's marshmallow frosting recipe to post here.  It isn't as sweet.

Tastes sooo good! My only worry was that it wasn't a great filler between layers of cake - the top tended to slide off the bottom layer.

I gave this a 4 because I made a couple of changes. Tip1: Seeing as there are some users who found this recipe too sweet, make sure you taste your marshmallows before you use them so you can adjust the sweetness of your icing. In my case, I used really sweet ones so i lessened the sugar to 2/3 cup and omitted the corn syrup. Tip2: follow the procedure as written and make sure you cook the egg whites, sugar and water over the double boiler till it peaks. Beat it continuously as instructed. If you add in the marshmallows too soon, it'll be as flat as hot marshmallow fluff from a jar...  Tip3:you can add another cup of marshmallows if you wish... I used 30pcs of the big ones. I know it doesn't measure the same but i'm pretty sure it's more than a cup. In my experience, more marshmallows = better viscosity especially if you want to pipe it on.   So overall, this recipe was exactly what i was looking for but the sugar level needed a little adjusting to my taste... mmm fluffy marshmallow goodness... cheers!

I've never made anything like this before, cooking eggs like that totally intimidates me. But it came out fabulous, even though I totally messed it up! I halved the recipe but then I got confused and used 2 egg whites anyway. I also didn't have any marshmallows so I used Fluff instead (I compensated by using a bit less sugar because the fluff is sweet). Then I misread about cooking and whipping it over rapidly boiling water, I just had it over simmering water. But even so, it came out very nice and fluffy, I was so surprised! And it wasn't too sweet, either. I absolutely loved it and it is  perfect as a low-fat filling for a low-fat whoopie pie recipe that I've been working on. Thank you!

This icing is great!  It is easy to work with, tastes wonderful, and looks fantastic!  It doesn't take much time to "set", so you have to act fast when adding sprinkles that you need to stick.

Fantastic! definitely not too sweet (as one reviewer complained). Butter cream icing is far sweeter. This is just gooier and fluffier - I loved it! It can be flavoured too - eg., I used 1tsp of orange liquor (instead of vanilla) and also added about 1 Tbs of orange zest while it was boiling, and used it to ice a round, double layer 9" chocolate cake - Yum!  Next time I will make ~ 1.5x the recipe though, as it would have been nice to have a thicker  layer of icing.   One tip: if you are icing a double layer cake, allow the middle icing layer to set for 5-10 minutes in the fridge before putting on the top layer. Put a lid on the icing in the pot and leave it over the hot water (without the heat on) so it doesn't set while you're waiting.

Excellent!!!  Takes time to cook but  YUM! afterwards!  Tastes excellent with pepermint flavoring and ice chocolate cake!  Looks beautiful with a touch of food coloring.  Add after the marshmallows have melted.

Yummy!  This tastes delicious.  It did take longer than the recipes says, about 10 minutes to form peaks.  I chopped my large marshmallows up as another reviewer recommended and they melted quickly.  For a 9x13 cake you could half this recipe.

I made this icing for a single layer chocolate cake and was pleased with the result. I chose this particular recipe because I happened to have all of  these ingredients in the house. Following the tips of a couple of the reviewers, I reduced the sugar to one cup (and my husband felt that I could have reduced it even more). I did add the corn syrup  because I wasn't sure if it was needed for the consistency and texture of the icing. As another reviewer said, I also had to beat it for over ten minutes, and it took awhile for the marshmallows to melt, but I kept at it and the final result was beautiful - very glossy - easy to work with (it stiffens as it cools) and good-tasting. Still good looking and good tasting two days later.

This icing was awesome!  I made it for my son's 12th BDay.  I made the rainbow cake and covered it with this icing.  It was a hit with everyone.   The boys ate the whole cake!  I cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups with no ill affects.  I didn't find it too sweet at all.  It was easy to make and covered the cake wonderfully!  I will def make this again!

My boyfriend had requested marshmallow for his birthday cake, and when he tasted this, he said, "vanilla".  If you're looking for marshmallow frosting, just leave out or cut back the vanilla and it should be perfect.  Other than that, this is a really great recipe, and I thought it was fun to make.  You could definitely experiment with the flavoring, too.

After reading the reviews, I think I expected to love this more but I thought it was just "pretty good".  I made my son's first birthday cake and decided to use this frosting.  I thought it held up well because I kept the cakes in the fridge due to the screaming hot weather but thought it had a grainy taste to it....maybe from the marshmallows?  I didn't think that would happen since you have to cook the sugar so I'm assuming it's from later adding the marshmallows.  I think next time, I'd try another recipe.

I have never made a cake that looked so pretty.  Based on the other reviews I cut the sugar to 1 c and beat it for 10 mins.  Amazing.  Glossy and held its shape beautifully.  Tastes like the inside of a great meringue.

Delicious and just a little different! The first step took about 12 minutes for me, but after that everything clicked along and turned out perfectly.  Combined with the Egg-Free, Dairy-Free, Nut-Free Cake recipe from this site (my chocolate cake standby because it's so moist and easy), I made "S'mores on a Cloud" cupcakes by topping the marshmallow icing with crushed graham crackers and chocolate shavings.

Well, the taste wa a-ok, but the consistancy was like melted marshmellow.  I couldn't do a thing with it other than drizzle this more like a glaze.  I wanted to decorate with it - so I needed something stiffer.  My leftovers I put in the fridge and it has separate - the corn syrup sank to the bottom.  I would love to hear from someone who made this succesfully - or did everyone get a glaze?

Oh wow! This is awesome! I love this recipe because the icing stays put on the cake, yet is still gooey marshmallow. I made it for my husband who loves snowballs. I made a chocolate layer cake with whipped cream in the center. After applying the icing, I sprinkled on flaked coconut and it was to die for. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

My hubby and kids really liked this one...it was a little sweet for me.  It was so similar to a 7 minute frosting (which is one of my favorites) that I thought I would give it a try.  While the taste was similar, it was sweeter than a traditional 7 minute frosting.  I had no problems with the prep or consistency of this icing.  Thanks for posting!!!

I wish it was possible to give half stars because I would have given 4 and a half. It's very good and it's a nice alternative to just regular icing. Very gooey. Just a warning though, it's extremely sweet. It is a little time consuming to prepare and messy.

This was light and yummy. I made it for an angel food cake and it worked well because it didn't overwhelm the flavor. You can use regular size marshmallows, but it might be a good idea to cut them up, I had to stir a little longer. It seemed to take a little longer than it said, but it was worth it. Yum.

I just tried to make this and followed all the directions but mine came out very grainy..not sure what happened. I cooked it for about 8 minutes, took it off the heat and then added the marshmallows. It's very sweet...If I try again I will definitely cut the sugar by half.

I was looking for a frosting recipe where I could use my leftover mini marshallows.  This recipe was great! I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I might even cut back another 1/2 cup, only using 1/2 cup total. The frosting was very tasty and perfect change from the standard butter cream.

Turned out EXTREMELY sweet and it didn't quite reach the right consistancy. If there is any way to make it less sweet, I think it would be great!

This was very delicious. I had trouble with the electric mixer over heating.  I wonder if it would work if you cooked the syrup without egg white first and then added to the egg white and beated, such as when making divinity.

This was my first time to use the double broiler method. It was a success. I did read the reviews and cut back on the sugar and only used 1 cup and 1/2 tsp of corn syrup. But everything else I kept the same. It was plenty for 24 cupcakes. I actually had to get rid of some of it. they are glossy and so pretty.

While it is good, it is essentially marshmallow creme. I found it far to sweet to frost an entire cake.

This is a nice fluffy unobtrusive icing.   I stopped beating when there were still some visible marshmallows, for texture, and added nuts to the top.  When placed over the top of fudge brownies, it has a rocky road effect.  Yummo!

Delicious, but I am an experienced baker and I had a really hard time working with this icing.  It kept sliding down the sides of the cake and pooling at the bottom.

Would love to have more instructions as to the best conditions after cooking to avoid this.

As others stated, it took me longer than 7min to get stiff peaks but the extra time is worth it.  I used only 1 cup sugar but added  an extra handful of mini marshmallows.  The icing looks glossy, holds well, and tastes great!

I wanted to make a s'mores cake, so I paired this marshmallow icing with a dark chocolate cake because marshmallows are so sweet.  After icing the cake, i put it under the broiler to toast and then topped with dark chocolate shavings and graham cracker crumbs. The recipe is very easy, it took closer to 12 minutes to get stiff peaks to form, but well worth it. The icing was beautiful and glossy.  This one is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is delicious! Extremely sweet. I accidentally added in the vanilla before cooking the icing. Still turned out fine. I worried it wouldn't stand as it wasn't really making peaks so I added a little meringue powder just in case. I will definitely make it again. The right way next time ??

This is a good recipe, however its overly sweetened . So instead of using the 1 and a half cup of sugar I used the half cup of sugar along with the half teaspoon of the light corn syrup and a half cup of the marshmallows it came out great. :)

It had a great flavor but a horrible texture, I might use it as a filling one day but never again as a frosting.  It does not even begin to hold its shape, min mellows did not want to melt easily either.

I've tried many recipes for this type of frosting and this is the absolute best in terms of taste, consistency, and stability.  I believe the marshmallows are the secret ingredient.  I'll always use this recipe from now on.  It worked out perfect!

I'm glad that I had read reviews and knew what to expect.  Definately sweet! and I'm a sugar lover.  Trying not to end up with a sticky mess, I probably overcooked it at 12 minutes...10 minutes would have been sufficient, but 7 definately didn't have stiff peaks.  I lost a lot of the icing on the sides of the bowl, so I would probably make a double batch for my next two layer 9" cake and add some scraping. Overall, very tasty on top of my chocolate espresso cake.

I made this for a strawberry cake I made- i didn't put in any vanilla extract and no marshmallows either but it was still REALLY good! It was a little runny, so I just globbed some over the little cakes I made and it looked great!

I would use this again, but mine was not making stiff peaks after 7 minutes, but maybe I had too much water in the bottom of my double boiler? Not sure, but this was still nice and soft on day 2 unlike some other 7 minute frostings.
