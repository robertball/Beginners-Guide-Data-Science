I don't want to be rude, but if this recipe turns out as anything other than a perfect basic chocolate pudding, it is entirely your fault. If you have egg bits: you put the egg in too much at a time and the temperature difference between the eggs and mixture was too high. Temper the eggs first or they will cook instantly when you put them in. Corn starch bits: you added the corn starch too late and the mixture was too hot. Mix the corn starch in thoroughly with the first cup of milk until it's dissolved. Liquid consistency after chilling: you didn't stir it enough while it was cooking. Stir it more until it becomes thick in the pan. Chocolate didn't melt: you cooked it too hot and the chocolate was too thick. Break it into smaller pieces, shave it, or cook the pudding on a lower heat for a longer period of time. Gritty or otherwise imperfect texture: you didn't use a whisk. Use a whisk. Remember that the pudding is only as good as the ingredients you put in it, so if you want it to turn out awesomely, splurge a bit and get some GOOD chocolate. Furthermore, it's a recipe that will take some tweaking before you get it exactly to your tastes. Don't make it once, trash it, and blame it on the recipe; make it twice, three, four times and change it each time until you get it. This is a pudding worth mastering.

Great stuff.  I served this cold at a dinner for 20 and got loads of compliments.  Adding 15% more chocolate made the flavor intense.  I would add a few steps to the instructions.  1)Destroy every lump in the powder mix or risk lumpy pudding. 2)Grate the chocolate.  It melted at the same moment the mixture boiled. 3) Stir a few spoonfuls of heated cream/chocolate mixture into the egg yolks to warm them up BEFORE putting the egg yolks into the pot.

Very creamy and tasty. Unsweetened cocoa powder (with a little vegetable oil) can be substituted for the unsweetened chocolate with good results. As an aside, for those having trouble adding in the egg: beat the yolks in a bowl and add a tiny bit of the hot pudding in, mix it up and add a little more. Then you can add the yolks into the pudding and they won't 'scramble'. Seperate the yolks carefully as well or you'll get bits of cooked egg white in your pudding. Overall a good, old-fashioned pudding recipe with wonderful texture and flavour.

Basically this is a wonderful, old-fashioned pudding recipe that's been around for decades.  In this recipe an extra teaspoon of vanilla is used. However, the cooking method here is asking for trouble - like cooked bits of eggs to be specific!  (If that happens you might still be able to salvage it by sieving it) Do NOT stir the egg yolks into the hot mixture!   Rather,  stir about a half cup of the hot mixture into the yolks to temper them, then return the egg mixture to the saucepan to finish cooking.  Finally, whether you leave this in one serving bowl or pour into individual serving dishes, cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Note: For a vanilla variation eliminate the chocolate and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.

This pudding is delicious!  My kids and I had this as a snack with some vanilla wafers and loved it! I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe though- I cut the vanilla extract down to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract as well.  I also omitted the butter at the end (simply because I got busy with my kids and forgot until it was already in the fridge) and even without it this was the richest, creamiest pudding I've ever made, and I saved on some calories and fat! I will definitely make this again!

I thought this recipe was great simply because it is so easy to make! I will use it again with a couple of slight variations. 

I thought it was a bit too sweet and the sweetness overpowered the more complex, deep chocolate flavor that I was really hoping for. Next time I will use 3/4 cup sugar.

Also, I used Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and I found that I was left with little dark flecks of chocolate throughout the pudding that hadn't melted completely despite the fact that I cooked at a lower heat for a longer period of time to try to avoid this. I don't think this had any impact on the flavor, because the pieces were so tiny, but next time I will melt the chocolate before adding it in. The little chocolatey spots definitely show that the pudding is homemade though, so if they don't bother you, just follow the recipe as is and go for it! 

Although the recipe doesn't mention it, make sure you temper your egg yolks before adding them in. (Add a little of the chocolate mixture to the yolks first and whisk to bring up the temperature, then pour in to the main mixture and whisk.) Failing to do this will leave you with little chocolatey scrambled eggs!

Also, I would suggest using a whisk for the entire cooking process to ensure a lump-free pudding. 

All in all, very tasty!

I upped the chocolate to 2.5 ounces and told my dad that it was really rich..."Well who doesn't want rich pudding?" This was really good, though. Very creamy, rich and chocolately. I only used maybe a teaspoon of butter and it still had great flavor. The best chocolate pudding recipe so far.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I did grate the chocolate which worked out very well. Definitely temper the egg yolks by stirring some hot mixture into them then adding them to the pan. If you skip this step you'll wind up with little chunks of scrambled egg yolk in your pudding.

Very good! You can't really get to fancy w/ chocolate pudding  so this is a basic recipe. Very chocolately. Just remember to prevent clumping add a little water or milk to the cornstartch before hand.

There's a trick to get all of the chocolate to melt.  Use a whisk!!  This recipe turns out great!  My kids just loved it.  Also, add the egg yolks in a little at a time, not all at once.  This will definitely go into my family's "favorites"!

This would be 5 stars but the directions need to be more thorough for novice cooks.  1. It is easiest to dissolve the cornstarch in the cold milk before adding it to the pan, and then you get no lumps.   2. Don't just dump the yolks into the hot pan. Take 1-2 tablespoons of the hot liquid and add it to the yolks, whisking vigorously. Then add that mixture back to the pan and proceed. That is tempering. 3. If you want a super smooth pudding and ensure no bits of cooked egg at all, just sieve it before chilling it.  4. Place cling wrap right onto the surface of the pudding while chilling or you will get a skin.  Follow these steps and you will get an amazing, smooth, yummy pudding.

Great recipe with a BIG change to the instructions which will save you a heap of trouble:  Heat milk and sugar and salt ONLY in a saucepan.  In a small measuring cup, whisk egg yolks, an extra 1/4C milk and cornstarch until smooth.  When milk mixture comes to a boil, THEN remove it from the heat and slowly pour cornstarch/egg mixture in while whisking well.  Return to heat stirring constantly for only one minute.  Prepare chocolate prior to that by microwaving in separate bowl and stirring before you whisk it into your pudding.  End by stirring in vanilla and butter.  We serve it warm at our house.  YUMMMMM!!!

Threw out my old chocolate pudding recipe.  This is our favorite now!  Very intense chocolate flavor and extremely creamy and smooth.  My husband said it tasted like a dark choc brownie.  I used cocoa powder instead of the unsweetened choc:  3 T of cocoa powder + 1 T. of oil = 1 oz. unsweetened choc.  I mounded the tablespoons of cocoa powder for a more intense, almost semisweet chocolate.  Couldn't have been easier.  Temper the egg yolks by adding a little bit of hot pudding to them before stirring them into the pot.

The chopped chocolate cannot completely melt before the ingredients are far too hot. The starch's effectiveness is ruined. Adding the egg, even after removing it from the heat, makes it literally scramble. A flop. I think MELTING the chocolate first would solve it. Won't try this one again.

Try wisking all the dry ingredients together then wisk the milk and egg together(I use cocoa instead of choc. squares), pour milk and egg mixture into dry mixture and wisk, then cook on stove or microwave. (no cooked egg this way)   I use the microwave to cook mine about a min. at a time and wisk between each minute.    Add the butter and vanilla at the very end when the pudding is done.

I rarely give a recipe 5 stars. This recipe is just about as awesome as cornstarch pudding can get! It was smooth and creamy, had an intense chocolate flavor and soul satisfying richness. I did make some alterations, but it was nothing that would detract from or significantly add to how great this recipe is. I added about 2 Tbs. of Hershey Dark Cocoa, a pinch of cayenne and used three egg yolks, because that's what I had left over from making something else! I am surprised at how easy it was to mix in the egg yolks. I had never done that before, but had seen the tempering process several times on television. It works!!!! I will be making this pudding again, and again.

So good! I followed the ingredients part to a T, but used a slightly different process - mix sugar, cornstarch and salt together, add milk and beaten egg yolk, place on heat and as mixture starts to heat up, add choclate.  I whisk the whole time (well, pretty much, anyway), bring to a boil over medium heat (takes a few minutes) and boil and stir for one minute.  Then remove from heat and add the butter, vanilla, pour immediately into serving dishes as it will set up quickly.   This recipe is very similar - other than quantities of cornstarch, milk and egg yolks - to the old Hershey's recipe from the 1920's, and I've never had an issue with the eggs scrambling, texture problems, etc.  You could also temper them as others mentioned, but I think this process is easier :)  I'd definitely make this one again, Mimi!  I'd just use the process I'm more comfortable with!

Amazing!!! I love dark chocolate and this was right up my ally. I did add more chocolate to this (can never have too much). It is a cross between hot chocolate and brownie batter. will keep making this instead of the box stuff.

Sooo entirely satisfying and indulgent.  I made this into parfaits with home made whipped cream.  It was just the right celebration treat for my girls winning 2nd place in a cheerleading competition.  Would have been equally good for a pity party if we had needed it!  Will make again for sure and has already been requested for the next competition.  I feel a new tradition coming on!  :)  One tip: whisk small amounts of the hot milk mixture into the yolks prior to adding them to the saucepan.  This will prevent the eggs from scrambling when added.

I made this today with my nine yr old daughter. I followed the recommendations on other reviews: 1)mixing cornstarch with a bit of the milk before adding it to the pot. 2) shaving the chocolate 3) Adding a bit of the mixture to the egg yolk before putting the yolk into the pot 3) stirring it constantly with a whisk 4) covering the surface of the pudding with plastic wrap before chilling it. The pudding came out great. The only thing I would do different is to add less sugar. It was too sweet for my taste. My daughter really enjoyed making it!

Melt the chocolate in the milk over low heat; while this is happening mix the dry ingredients together, get rid of all lumps. Add to the milk and choc and whisk; A LOT. Turn up heat to med high.  Temper the egg yolks and gradually add to hot milk mixture...keep whisking till mixture boils and thickens. Remoe from heat and add vanilla.  I used whole milk so didn't feel butter was necessary.  Creamy and delicious!  Too sweet for our tastes so only used about 2/3 cup sugar.

Rich, creamy, delicious. I used 6 Tbsp. of cocoa and 2 Tbsp. canola oil in places of the squares, I didn't have unsweetened on hand. I also only had about a tbsp. of butter available.

I am not into sweets too much but i figured i would give it a try.

For me it was too much sugar, next time I try it I think I am going to cut the sugar A bit.

This is AMAZINGGGGGG.  I cut the sugar down to 2/3 c and added an extra ounce of chocolate, and it turned out to be a bittersweet masterpiece!  I had enough to make one chocolate pudding pie and fill two pudding cups.  I had never made homemade pudding before, but now I realize there's no other way to do it!  I can't believe I MADE this!  It's SO GOOD!

chocolate squares can't exist in my house for more than 24hr so I used 6tbl cocoa pwd and 2tbl butter to substitute. This seemed to work fine.  It would help if the recipe said "stir until it forms a pudding consistency." I don't have much experience with pudding or corn starch so the first time I made this I stirred for two min and put in the fridge, thinking it'd congeal as it chilled. it does not! You need to stir until it is the consistency you want.  Delicious and so fast! loved it.

This was the MOST DELICIOUS pudding recipe EVER!  I sent him the recipe a few days ago & told him we should try it w/ a few modifications like other recco'ed.  My husband had it chilled & waiting for me today after I got home from work.  Here are the changes, per some of the other reviews I saw.  He cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup.  He also used 2.5 (1 oz) squares of the unsweetened chocolate (instead of just 2 oz).  It is not too sweet & it is not too bitter - it is perfect.  Also, he was sure to grate the chocolate using a microplane, instead of chopping, for easier melting.  And finally, the butter at the end is not necessary at all.  Also, use a whisk throughout the entire process.  And whipped cream is not necessary.  It is so rich & chocolately that you can't even taste the whipped cream!  PERFECT!  Will make over & over!

awesome, simple recipe with a great taste!  I used it to make a simple brownie trifle layering the pudding with brownies and cherry pie filling and adding a dollop of whipped cream.  Yummers!  It is also yummy to eat while still warm!

This could totally be cook error, but it turned out very lumpy.  I followed the directions to the "T".  It had a good flavor, but the lumps just turned us all off!

ok…I listened to those who said use a whisk, which I would use anyway. I grated the chocolate. I tempered the eggs and I dissolved the cornstarch in the milk prior to adding to the sugar.  I cooked the pudding appropriately according to recipe and I thickened as stated but this still was gritty. Cant explain why. I would have to give this 3 stars for good flavor but overall consistency ruined it for me

I followed the recipe as posted here.  I started with a rubber spatula to stir with so I could scrape off the sides then moved to a whisk and once I switched over it thickened up really fast.  I think it was a bit too thick but I'll figure that out later.  It's the first tim I ever  made a pudding from scratch.  I used artificial sugar as my family is mostly diabetic and it might have changed the finished product.  I hated to waste the egg white so I made Pepper Meringues by KATHY (on this site) with the whites as topping. Without the pepperment.  It turned out fantastic!!  Thanks to all the tips in the comments. And the pudding doesn't stick to the celophane wrap at all.  I was a bit worried about scraping pudding from the plastic wrap. lol  I will have to cut back on the sugar as it was a bit too sweet but I find artifical sugar to be sweeter than regular so next time I know.

easy to make, great texture and delicious. The reason why i gave it just 4 stars: little bit to sweet and the vanilla penetrates the chocolate. So, cut down the vanilla (1 Tsp is enough) and sugar (1 2/3 cups is still plenty)and its perfect!

I'm in love with this pudding, and I'm not a pudding person - I abhore the commercial 'instant' puddings. Like other reviews, I add a bit more chocolate than called for, for the chocolate to stay the dominant flavor.

I just made a double batch, and I used half milk and half of half-n-half. I am a chocolate snob, and always use the best chocolate. I recommend using Guittard chocolate, in my opinion it's better than Ghirardelli, unless a local store carries the high-end single origin bean chocolate. For Utahns, you can't get better than Amano Chocolates, an Orem-based company.

When it comes time to tempering the eggs, I learned to have another person pour a thin stream while I whisk madly. Slowly add more until you have about a cup of mixture in the bowl, and then whisk constantly again when adding the tempered eggs back into the pan.

Mimi, you have my everlasting love for introducing me to the delights of homemade pudding.

This recipe is delicious.  I used 2 squares of 60% cacao Ghirardelli chocolate. It tasted more like milk chocolate vs. dark chocolate pudding. I followed the others' advice to temper the egg yolks, and it worked perfectly.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup which was perfect.  I think this recipe is 4 servings instead of 6, so I had to make two recipes.  Overall - Yum!  I served it to my book club with strawberries and whipped cream, and it was a hit.

I made it with coconut milk since we don't do dairy here. Soooo delicious. Depending on how much chocolate I want sometimes I halve the amount of chocolate I put in it because it is very rich. This a wonderful and very easy recipe!

Of the three Chocolate pudding recipes I've tried on this site, this is by far the very best. It combines the wonderful richness of a cream custard with the decadence of chocolate. It's rich, thick, and delicious. I do agree with other reviewers that this may be a little too sweet as is, but that could be easily remedied by cutting the sugar.

While the recipe calls for cooling down, I like my chocolate pudding warm. Either way you like it, this is delicious!

Great pudding recipe!  I used three ounces of chocolate instead of two because I wanted a more intense chocolate flavor and I also didn't want this to be too sweet.  The level of sweetness was perfect with three ounces of chocolate.  I tempered the eggs first (by adding spoonfuls of the hot mixture and stirring) and then added them into the hot mixture.  It took mine a while longer to thicken and for the chocolate to melt.  In the end, a great home made pudding recipe.

I know this is a beginners mistake as I haven't made too many puddings from scratch, but the recipe should read to temper the eggs before adding to the pot or add one at a time or both.  In my opinion this wasted the whole recipe to have egg bits, which I doubled.

This is wonderful! I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and I knew to whisk some of the pudding mixture into the egg yolks.  ***You get the best results when you allow the yolks to get to room temperature*** Have fun cooking!

Quick and simple recipe, yet excellent, rich flavor and velvety texture.  No problem with tempering the egg yolks, simply whisked them into the milk before adding it to cornstarch and sugar, whisked constantly until it thickened and bubbled for 1 minute, removed from heat, whisked in chocolate, vanilla and butter and it came out perfect.  Anyone who has trouble executing this recipe needs to re-evaluate their skill set or technique.

The amount of sugar is arguably to taste, and you can't know until you try it whether your tastes are for sweeter or no. I made this today for my husband, and it's fantastic. If you're unfamiliar with how to make these kinds of custards, then you are naturally going to have some egg bits. It's ok -- strain the mixture at the end, and then chill it. If you allow your mixture to boil BEFORE you add the eggs, then stir it off the heat until it ceases to boil, or you will scramble your eggs every time. I did double or triple the chocolate in this recipe -- had to use a mixture of 1 baker's square and the rest chips, so I guesstimated. Thanks for the recipe!

This was sooooo good! I had 2 yolk to use cause I hate to waste food and stumbled on this recipe. I did mix the cornstarch in the milk first and did temper the eggs instead of adding them straight in. I also had cocoa powder 3 tablespoons with 1 tablespoon veg. oil. So I did waver from the original a bit but it was oh sooo good and smooth and creamy!

This pudding tastes great! And it's easy to make! I agree with reviewer Kat that it's too bad some other reviewers tanked this recipe because of their technique. If you don't know how to add egg yolks to hot liquids then look this up in your basic cookbook before trying this recipe. Don't worry that it won't thicken - how could something with 2 tablespoons of corn starch in it not thicken?? And the chocolate will melt. You will end up with a pudding that has a great consistency and a very sweet, chocolate taste. Thanks for the recipe - five stars all the way.

I fudged the ingredients a little bit, using 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white (being out of sugar wasnt gonna stop me from making pudding!), and I free-handed the milk chocolate peices, and 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 tbsp Ovaltine. Delicious! Will make again, as i made it.

I just made this last night and it did turn out perfect but it was too sweet for my liking. I'd suggest lowering the amount of sugar put in if you don't want it too sweet.

Fantastic, basic chocolate pudding. Very smooth and creamy. It was a little sweet for my liking, so next time I'll reduce the sugar quantity. My arm was a little sore from all the constant whisking but it was definitely worth the effort. No lumps, no burning, perfect texture.

The best pudding I've ever tasted!  You do need to be careful in adding the egg yolks, which the recipe does not tell you, by adding a little bit of the hot pudding at a time (stirring vigorously) to the egg  yolks until the eggs yolk/pudding mixture is warm, then adding it all to the hot pudding.  I used two parts half and half and one part skim  milk for milk it called for.  Also, I added high quality vanilla from the Dominican Republic, which gave it a slight coconutty flavor.  It was unbelievably good.

This is a yummy pudding ! I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the unsweetened chocolate, and added a handful of caramel chips..I adjusted the recipe for 3 instead of 6..so easy and it turned out perfect, do it slow and it is a breeze..I will make this over and over 5 star..

This is chilling in the fridge right now. I didn't have enough chocolate squares so I used regular cocoa powder with some oil (3tbsp per 1 tbsp of oil)I doubled this so that I had the same amount called for in the recipe. It turned out amazing. Tastes like chocolate brownie pudding. Very very chocolaty. I think the cocoa powder may have made it stronger. I think you could do this with any chocolate chip flavor too, just cut down on the sugar or cut it out. Definitely a keeper for us.

This was my first try at homemade stove top pudding...
The taste satisfied my chocolate craving, but I didnt mix the pudding enough, so it6 wasnt smooth.  But that was my fault not the recipes.

Perfect pudding!! I had a lot of luck by grading the chocolate and letting it melt on a lowish heat before turning it up to let it thicken. I also let the eggs come to room temperature and beat the yolks a bit before mixing them in. And of course, I whisked the heck out of it the whole time. The result was just fantastic!

This pudding was lovely and rich. I confess we altered it slightly to suit our families tastes. I used the traditional technique of melting the chocolate in the butter before adding it to the pudding and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. It didn't make anything near six servings, but I will happily double the recipe and make it again.

Nice smooth and chocolatey taste. Will make again. I did liquify the cornstarch and tempered the egg yolks before adding to the rest of the mixture and it turned out great. I didn't want to risk adding the yolks at once and messing the recipe. Overall, I recommend this recipe for all sweet tooth's out there.

Very good and chocolatey!  Actually tasted very much like my homemade fudge-brownie batter... I wanted to make a quick chocolate treat for this afternoon, but *refuse* to bake in this heat!  This was a very fast and simple alternative.  Right off the stove the taste was great, and thick consistency.  I'm sure it will only improve as it chills!  My house smells deliciously chocolately - you can't get that from an instant box.  I used coca powder and oil, as I never have unsweetened chocolate on hand.  Definitely use a whisk throughout the whole process and temper your eggs!  A very solid, and tasty, 4 stars.

This was my first try making pudding.  Read a few hints from reviewers that helped me out quite a bit.  For my tastes too sweet, but I can fix that next time.  Hubby and kids will probably love as is.

Fabulous recipe! When I make homemade pudding and custards, I add the milk and chocolate to the saucepan first, set my electric range temp to level 3 and stir until the chocolate chunks begin to melt. Then I add the sugar, cornstarch, salt and continue to stir until the the chocolate chunks are completely dissolved. Because the temperature of the mixture is still relatively low, I whip the egg yolks (which have been sitting out on my counter the whole time and should be close to room temperature); and add them directly to the saucepan. Then I begin to stir for about 5 minutes on level 3 heat to ensure the egg yolks are mixed in and no clumping forms. After that, I turn the heat up to level 5 and stir until the mixture thickens to my desired thickness. Remove from heat, add the butter and vanilla and continue to whisk. I should have added that I make pudding using a whisk because it ensures zero clumping.  It takes a bit longer to make pudding/custard this way but I've never had it clump. Once I pour the pudding into the container(s), I allow it to cool on my counter for about 1 hour and then refrigerate it. You'll still get a pudding skin, but it's very minimal. GREAT recipe! Thank you!

I've made this pudding twice now, and it has a permanent place in my recipe box!  It's simple to make and tastes great.  I took other reviewer's advice and tempered the eggs, which gives it a smoother texture.  This pudding is delicious either chilled or warmed.

Fabulous.  I used high quality unsweetened cocoa powder (about 1/2 cup) and 2 T veg oil instead of the chocolate.  It's really dark and I can't wait to serve it tonight!

This pudding is awesome and so easy to make!!! I've made this several times, my kids and their friends always ask for it!!! I have read all the reviews and to the people that called it flop... you did not do it right. The eggs MUST be tempered. The recipe should have said it, but anyone who cooks should know that. It's common sense that if you put eggs into anything hot, they will scramble. Thanks for this one, it's great!!

I will never by the boxed kind again. This was amazing- just the right fix for someone who wants a yummy chocolate dessert when a cookie will not stop the chocolate craving. Tastes like the batter for a fudge cake-  I read the reviews and used the ingredients exactly However I did them in a different order- I melted the chocolate with the butter in a sauce pan and then slowly alternated and added the sugar mixture and  1 1/2 cups of milk. I had reserved 1/2 milk and had mixed that with the eggs yolks and then I slowly added that in while whisking. It thicken up and came out creamy with not lumps or gritty texture.

very easy to make and VERY tasty! I made this on a night that I had planned to make a more complicated dessert but I ran out of time and made this instead.  What a happy coinsidence - it was a hit!  Like a past reviewer I made this with 6tbsp fry's cocoa and 2 additional tbsp of butter. mmmm would be fabulous with pound cake.

This was a great homemade chocolate pudding. Make sure you temper the eggs and melt your chocolate. I did use a semi-sweet chocolate. I think it would have not been sweet enough for me if I didn't do that.

This pudding is very rich and creamy. Unlike other reviews, I didn't find it too sweet or not sweet enough. It was just right.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

I just made this and it is wonderful!!  It thickened up perfectly and has a beautiful dark, rich color and flavor.  I increased the chocolate by 1/2 since I am a chocolate fiend, but everything else is exactly as written.  One note for those who are having trouble with the eggs:  you can just whisk them in with everything else at the beginning, and you should have absolutely no lumps at all.  I always do it this way since it saves time and gets me to my pudding faster!  Whisking will also keep away those icky corn starch lumps and help your chocolate melt evenly without burning.  I'mm sorry to hear this wonderful recipe get bad marks just because people don't know how to make pudding.

I loved this recipe, although I had to wait until it started to bubble up for the chocolate to melt, which created a thick layer that appeared whenever I let it sit. I found it better and more laid back to use less/more of everything. I wouldn't even it all out :) I also recommend to allow siblings to stir! This is great in a parfait with ice cream and cream on top, but do not freeze the parfait, just eat it right on the spot, because it's impossible to pry loose the pudding otherwise. I love this recipe!

Mimi, this is an excellant recipe.  My family and I love it!  I lowered the heat a little, to a med-low setting and I used egg yolks at room temp.  I shaved the chocolate very fine.  It came out very smooth and rich. Thanks!

It's a nice basic recipe and easy to make. I think adding more chocolate or using a higher cocoa content chocolate is definitely necessary. I only had a 34% cocoa milk chocolate on hand, albeit a high quality one, so I used 1.5 times as much as the recipe stated and halved the sugar due to me using milk chocolate anyway. It was still a bit mild on the chocolate flavor. Also I cooked this by tempering the eggs with a bit of the milk mixture, before returning the whole mixture to the pan and stirring for a couple more minutes. Not sure how you can buy a square of unsweetened chocolate- either it's semisweet or bittersweet, but unless it's cocoa powder, all chocolate has sugar added to it!

Its simply amazing and so easy to make! All I did was reduce the sugar a little to get a little more chocolaty flavor. It needs  whole lot of whisking to get it right. The first time I tried it the sugar burned and the cornstarch didn't mix quite well with the milk.

I used baking cocoa and oil to substitute for the unsweetened chocolate since I didn't have any. This was the most awesome homemade chocolate pudding I have ever had! Soooo smooth and creamy and good both hot and cold! I used whole milk with just a touch of cream for the milk. Also since I subbed in cocoa powder I mixed it together like this: mix sugar, cornstarch, salt and cocoa powder until combined. Add egg yolks and stir until mixed well. Add milk and oil and stir well. Heat on low, stirring constantly and bring to a boil. Boil two minutes, stirring constantly. Then added the butter and vanilla. Done! Yum! Yum!

Omg this was delicious. My daughter said it tasted like liquid gold. I only had one ounce of bakers choc. So I substituted cocoa powder for the other ounce ( 3 tsp cocoa powder plus 1 tsp oil). I also added an additional ounce of cocoa powder cause who doesn't want more chocolate!? No more box pudding for us. Topped this off with some semi frozen whipped topping and the rest is history. My only regret was not doubling this recipe. For a family of four this doesn't go very far.

First, this is a GREAT recipe.  However, I did make a couple tweaks running into some challenges.  The recipe should include whisking (not stirring) from the first step all the way through.  Second, the chocolate should be broken down to small pieces for better melting.  Third, make sure to temper the yolks a bit so the egg doesn't scramble.  Use a GOOD chocolate!  For my diet, I made this carbohydrate free and diabetic friendly by using Sweet Perfection sugar (made from chicory) and unsweetened Ghiradelli chocolate.  I also increased the chocolate to 2 ounces which made a more decadent, rich chocolate pudding.  Lastly, I made it with heavy cream to make it almost entirely carb-free.  OMG this was delicious diet friendly or not!!  No reason why you can't use something like Splenda as the sugar or some alternative.

I have made this basic recipe with the substitution of cocoa powder for the baking chocolate and no egg yolks.  In fact, I usually make it with instant dry milk powder.  It was a recipe that was developed by people who had no milk and eggs at the time.  And it turns out wonderfully.  Just put all the dry ingredients into a saucepan, and whisk them till combined and then put in the water to reconstitute the dry milk powder.  Stir while it is heating and thickening, take off the heat, add in the vanilla and butter.   Easy peasy.

I used bakers chocolate brand. Followed recipe exactly. Not overly sweet, had a rich deep chocolate taste. It would be good in a chocolate pie w/ whipped cream. I think jello cook and serve is better though. But this has less chemicals than jello.

Excellent recipe.  I always temper eggs for custard recipes.  I also used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup (my personal preference is less sweet).  I didn't have any cornstarch so I used 4 tablespoons of tapioca flour instead.  This is a hit.  A few fresh raspberries and some whipped cream on top and this was great.  This is so much better than the box stuff, and it only took a few extra minutes to make.

Great proportions.  I have made as is, and substituting with coconut milk and tapioca flour for a dairy and grain free treat.  As others have stated be sure to temper the egg yolks.  1 yolk = 1 tablespoon.  if you whisk the starch with the sugar before cooking there will be no clumps.

Excellent for pie filling. Sweetness is perfect if making for kids. If making for adults, I would reduce sugar. Used the suggestions about adding cornstarch to milk. I already knew not to just add the yolks to the pot. I will use this recipe when I need to make a chocolate pie. I topped mine with sweetened whipping cream. Excellent.

I added a half oz of dark chocolate to use it up. Added a tube of instant coffee. Used half cup white and heaping 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and still a little sweet for me. DD said it rocked so it's a keeper.

I'll give it 2 starts for taste and no stars for final product.  Not enough instruction info with this recipe after two failed attempts to know what went wrong and caused my "soupy" end result.  Don't know if I cooked it long enough, I definitely let it cool before refrigeration.  Very frustrating..I will not attempt this one again.

I've made this pudding a few times now.  I hardly ever have unsweetened chocolate on hand, so I substitute 6 Tbs of cocoa + 2 Tbs canola oil.  I also use two whole eggs, and have substituted tapioca starch for the cornstarch.  It's turned out great each time with only slight flavor variations depending on the brand/type of cocoa.  I also find it simpler to combine all the ingredients except the vanilla and butter (beating eggs first) in a large microwave safe bowl, and cooking on high for 1 - 2 minute intervals, stirring in between, until the pudding thickens up well.  I then add the butter and vanilla and pour into serving dishes.  Delicious!

Ok, I'm in Missouri and I'm pretty sure anything this good isn't legal in my state. So good! All homemade puddings are great, but the extra richness from egg yolks and butter send this over the top.

Wow! Loved this! I didn't have the squares of chocolate so I added 6 tablespoons of cocoa powder and it turned out wonderful! Keep stirring (key) until you can really see it's thickening. Also, temper the yolks by adding a few tablespoons of the hot mixture to the eggs and stir quickly. Then, add that to the pan. Delicious!

I loved this pudding!!!  However, my husband thought it was too sweet, so for those of you who can't handle things that are extremely rich, you may want to reduce the sugar to 3/4 c. I think that would still be delicious.  I will definitely keep this for my go to recipe for pudding.  **You should definitely temper the eggs before incorporating them.

Fantastic recipe.  So simple yet so delicious.  Made it exactly as instructed and it turned out great!  It almost tasted like a very soft fudge.  This is a keeper for sure.  I will be making this for Christmas dinner.

Fantastic!  Tastes like a brownie.....definitely make sure you temper the egg.  (Easy!) and chop up the chocolate a little before heating.  Great with whipped cream and topped with M&M's.  Yum!

Delicious! I will never buy instant pudding again. Easy, creamy and foolproof! Do be sure to temper the eggs though. I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips and cut down on the sugar. Hubby is going to be so happy when he gets home!

Really really liked this!!! I did use 4tbls of flour in place of the cornstarch and 4 tablespoons unsweetened coco powder and 2.5tbls veg oil in place of the chocolate bar. Turned out fantastic! :D

I'm sure if the instructions were more detailed this would have been fabulous! I didn't know that the yolks would cook into little bits if you didn't add them correctly and that you need to use a wisk to get the chocolate to dissolve completely and at the correct temperature. I will surely give it another try. This was a GREAT lesson in cooking for me!

This is delicious! Although it was a little runny I think it tastes much, much better than the boxed kind. Instead of 2 oz. of chocolate I put in 5 oz. of semisweet chocolate chips and I think it could use even more chocolate! You definatly need to strain the mixture before chilling, because I found some tiny pieces of cooked egg which is disgusting. Otherwise, completly delicious!

This is about the 10th recipe I have tried and it is by far the best.  The only thing i would suggest (as others did) is to temper the egg yolks a little befor mixing them in.  Thanks fo a great one!

Absolutely lovely, rich, thick and creamy pudding. I used flour as a substitute for cornstarch (2F:1C), 1/3 more unsweetened chocolate and 1/3 less sugar and it came out wonderful. Definitely keep whisking and scrape with a rubber spatula throughout. I took the advice of tempering the yolks by adding a bit of the warm chocolate mixture and whisking before adding it back to the pot. Perfectly smooth. I'm surprised more people don't make pudding from scratch. It's so simple and the result far exceeds the amount of work put in.    X Melissa

TOO SWEET!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just too sweet for my taste.  And I love things sweet.  I had guests who all agreed.  The kids ate it really slowly which was another clue that it was too sweet.  So, I'll keep looking for the right proportions in other recipes.

The flavor was good.  I didn't care for the texture very much.  Not as smooth and creamy as I like.  If I make it again, I will try a different kind of chocolate.  I used Scharffen-Berger (unsweetened) and I think that might have been the problem.

Mmmmm!  I made this for my hubby and son, and they really loved it. My husband couldn't believe that I made it from scratch,(silly man!). It was real creamy and not lumpy, will make again, but I will try adding more chocolate.  This is a great comfort food!

Wow! I was looking for milk chocolate pudding and this is it.  I did add 1 tsp brown sugar with the butter and vanilla in the end.  This adds flavor if you want to chill the mix.  Keep in mind High Altitude requires a change in any liquid that needs cooking.  Above 3000 feet add 2 min.  Above 5000 feet add 4 min,  Above 7000 feet add 6 min.  The higher you go the longer it will take.

The flavor of the pudding, when hot, is rich and delicious, but once cold, I don't think it tastes as good. Plus, it didn't thicken up properly when I made it, and was more like thick hot cocoa than pudding. In the future I will probably use the same recipe to make a chocolate sauce or something else that could be enjoyed hot.

I didn’t have unsweetened chocolate, so I used 2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips and used 3/4 cup sugar. It is still a touch too sweet for my taste so if I make it again using chocolate chips, I will probably cut back the sugar to 2/3 cup. It was still delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Very good recipe, but a little too sweet for our taste (I would reduce to 3/4 cup or 1/2 cup sugar next time, but that's solely our sweet tooth preference). Couple of key points lacking in this recipe as written: (1) TEMPER YOUR EGGS, and (2) USE WHOLE or 2% MILK. About point #2 for type of Milk, I accidentally picked up nonfat milk, but tried the recipe anyway. The pudding took longer to settle or firm up in the fridge, and was a tad too thin--still very good though.

I'd been craving homemade chocolate pudding for weeks, and I finally made this. While hot, it was very good, but once it cooled, it was grainy and a bit bland. I'll keep looking for the perfect pudding fix. 
I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup -  make sure to temper the eggs - cover with plastic wrap directly on top so it doesn't form a skin.

I made this as directed but added 1 Tb. cocoa in with the milk and chocolate...........mmmmm.....so good! I also tempered the egg yolks by adding in a cup or so of chocolate sauce and stirring before adding the yolk mixture to the pudding...........

Wonderful pudding!  I adjusted the servings to use up the 3 yolks I had.  In that amount, I decreased the sugar by 1/2 C to just 1 C--still too sweet for me.  But, all in all, it cooked up nice and thick after a bit more stirring.  Looking forward to serving it to guests tomorrow after lunch!

Made this again and decreased the sugar to 1/4 C. for the same amount as above--just right for me.  Disclaimer:  I prefer less sugar to my desserts and my choc. did have some sugar as well that I figured in to the sum of it.  =)

I used 2% milk and was very good. Cooking the mix with the chocolate in so early was different but it came together when it started to boil.

It doesn't say what type of chocolate to use, I used 1/2 baking and 1/2 bittersweet and it was delicious but a little sweet, so if using other than baking chocolate cut down the sugar.
I used a whole egg in place of 2 yolks as to not have whites leftover, works the same. Temper the eggs.

I made this and followed the suggestions of others by mixing the corn starch with cold milk, and tempering the eggs. The pudding turned out a little too thick for my taste, so next time I'll use a little less corn starch.

It's so helps to read the reviews before you make something for the first time. And having done that this putting turned out to be perfect. Thank you previous reviewer's. It is really good so gently and very very nice I love it thanks

This was definitely the best chocolate pudding I've ever had! I didn't bother with the egg yolks or butter, and it was still smooth and shiny. I decided to try an experiment with it, and I froze it in Pop-sickle molds. As I suspected, it turned into fudge-sickles! yay!

It seamed to easy, but was sooo good! Decreased the sugar by 1/2 though since 1:3 seemed way to sweet. Very rich and creamy pudding, as easy as store bought chemical pudding. 
Only criticism would be that I wish the skin was thicker, always been the best part of pudding.
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Way too much sugar. That's saying a lot coming from me, as I have a serious sweet tooth. Next time, I think I'll half the sugar and hope that it turns out better. The texture is great.

It was runny and probably because when I put the eggs in, all these lumps began to form, and I strained it.  Looked like a mass of egg, probably all the egg I had put in!  Seems to me you need to give a little clearer instruction on adding egg.  I believe my mixture was too hot, and perhaps I should've whisked the egg,

Wonderful, absolutely delicious. Perfect flavor, not too sweet and not too bitter. I did have trouble getting it to thicken enough, so I will add a bit more of that next time.

this was delicious and perfect for the chocolate lover... read the reviews about the egg first, everything is very true!  Make sure to continue stirring your pudding.  Cools quickly and no need to wait hours to eat.  I used cocoa powder instead and it was great! thanks for the recipe

We loved it, delicious. For dahlia15: you probably didn't put it on hot enough for cornstarch to work. This is why it wasn't thick. It happens to me too, so I put it on a higher warmth, and it started to thicken more.

I am giving this 4 stars because while this is a yummy recipe, I think it  needs a few changes. I am going to try what the other reviewer said about tempering the pudding and all that. I also used less sugar. Good basic recipe.

Nice and creamy pudding.  I think I'll cut the sugar back by half a cup next time and add an extra chocolate square.  It was just a bit too sweet and not quite chocolaty enough.

Exquisite! Added 1 1/2 tsp almond extract, and substituted some half & half for part of the milk, though I'm sure it would have been delightful even without.  Amazing!

This chocolate pudding is incredible!  I'd never made pudding from scratch, and couldn't be happier with the results.  Like others suggested, I tempered the eggs with some of the hot milk mixture--no lumps at all.  The pudding was so rich and creamy, with an amazing flavor.  My daughter said it was like eating a melted brownie.  Be sure to use a whisk when stirring, and cook long enough for the mixture to thicken before you add the egg yolks.  Also, I only had semi-sweet chocolate, so I reduced the sugar a bit.  My kids are already asking when we can make it again!

We all loved this.  I served it with cinnamon whipped cream.  So yummy and easy.  We cooled it completely before we put it into the fridge.  I ate one serving room temp and one cold...it doesn't matter which way you eat it, it is just plain yummy!

Delicious, creamy, rich chocolate flavor. I would make again. I don't like things to sweet so next time I will try 3/4 cup of sugar. Excellent recipe Mimi!!

oh my god these are so good, so easy and so delicious. I halved the mixture because I didn't need as much and doubled the chocolate because I like mine extra chocolatey. SO GOOD.

tastes great..but i think i did something terribly wrong. however i can't figure out what i did. i couldn't get the chocolate to melt for a long time..and so when i was done with everything, i put it to chill..but 40 minutes later, and its liquidy still..i could drink it. im not sure what i did wrong. i would probably try this again. also found a piece of egg yolk in the "chocolate soup". this is probably something i did wrong though so no offense meant to you mimi.

My husband cannot have artificial sugars, so boxed pudding no longer works for us.  This is a great pudding recipe that is fast and the ingredients are easy to find in my pantry.  I used semi-sweet chocolate because it was what I had.  Still came out great, just a little too sweet.  Served it warm with pound cake.

Wow this is a wonderful and easy pudding.  I only changed the recipe by using 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk, only because I had cream that needed to be used up.  I used a whisk and had no problem with my chocolate melting in nicely.  I think it tasted good even before adding the egg yolks and the butter but it makes it really rich and creamy so it is worth the added calories and fat.  We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.  Thanks for this yummy recipe!

This pudding came out perfectly!  I did not have any problems with melting or clumping.  We will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe I had to make some small changes just because of what I had on hand. I used 3 Tablespoons of cocoa powder with one Tablespoon of Vegetable oil in place of the 1 ounce of unsweeted chocolate and I added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips (just to get rid of the chips) all I had was one teaspoon of French Vanilla extract and I only used 1 tablespoon of butter. Everyone in my house agreeded that this was the best chocolate pudding ever!! Thanks for the recipe:)

This is a good chocolate pudding recipe, but I would cut back on the sugar a bit to 3/4 cup.  I didn't have the semi-sweet chocolate squares so I added 4 tablespoons of cocoa instead.  Will definitely make again.

This turned out pretty good. It was a little too sweet so next time I will cut back on the sugar a bit, but other thatn being too sweet the flavor was great and the consistency was just perfect. Creamy and smooth. I made dirt cups with this for my boys (with the oreo crumbs and gummy worms) and they were great! Will definitely make this again, just with less sugar.

The only change I made was to use 3/4 C sugar.  This was the 3rd pudding recipe I made this week and for some reason (I'm thinking the chocolate) it turned gritty when it got cold.  The first batch of pudding I used cocoa powder and no egg yolk and the other was vanilla with egg yolk and they were both creamy.  My husband likes it warm and when I heated it up the grittyness went away. If I were to make this again I'd use cocoa powder or melt the chocolate separately. I tempered my eggs, you can not put eggs into a boiling mixture and expect it not to scramble.

Oh my goodness!  This is such a delicious pudding.  Thank you to the reviewer who told us how to add the eggs!  (Just a recap: add a little of the hot chocolate-y mix to the eggs first, mix those together, and then return the egg-chocolate mixture to the rest of the pot - that way the eggs don't scramble as you just add them to the hot chocolate-y mix.)  It's a little rich, but it's delicious!  Not too sweet, not too chocolatey :)

Where do I start on this recipe?Well to begin with it took an hour before the pudding even started to get remotely thickened.Then after cooling off and trying it,it was way too sweet for me.I'll keep on looking for another recipe,this one needs way too much tweaking to make it worth the time spent on waiting for it to thicken.Better yet I'll stick to the store bought pudding mix,it tastes much more like a chocolate pudding should.

This pudding was Y-U-M-M-Y!!  I did not think that the chocolate would be enough chocolate flavor, so I also added 1/2c. semi-sweet Ghiradelli chocolate chips when I melted the other chocolate.  This pudding is very creamy, and very easy to make, it cooked up very quickly.   I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone!

This was very good, but I thought it was both a tad too sweet and a tad too chocolatey.  It would be good with whipped cream or heavy cream to cut the sweetness a bit.
