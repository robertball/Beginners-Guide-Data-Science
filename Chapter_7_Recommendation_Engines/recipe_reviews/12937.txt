This soup was great!  My whole family loved it!  I like how this recipe didn't have all the oil and margarine that other recipes do.  I added fat free mozarella on top of the soup, then put the bread on, added a little more mozarella, sprinkled some Parmesian cheese and put the bowls in the oven to broil until the cheese melted and slightly browned.  Delicious!!

As with the previous reviewer, i used vegetarian "beef" broth instead of veggie broth and only 2 large onions. I didn't have sherry so used a good red wine instead. Threw the bread on with some vegan mozzarella and broiled it for a few minutes. Everyone loved, especially me! Thanks

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I did happen to make some modifications.  I added more broth and added vegetarian worchestire sauce.  This adds wonderful depth and flavor.  YUM!!! This is a total do again.

I needed a soup to bring to our church with no meat or meat stock.  I was delighted to find this recipe.  It was delicious!!  I had to triple the recipe and the soup was gone in a half an hour!I added shallots and chives for a variety of onions.  Plus I served the soup with homemade croutons and grated jarlsburg cheese.  Make it!!!  You'll love it!!

Really good onion soup! LOVED THE GARLIC!!!
My house smelled like onion & garlic for days (not necessarily a bad thing!)...
I took the other reviewers' suggestions and only used 2 large onions - and that was plenty.  I also used vegetarian "beef" broth (purchased at a health food store) instead of vegetable broth.  I found another recipe that used fresh thyme in the onion soup recipe - maybe I'll try that next time.  I will definitely make this recipe (with a few modifications) again.

This soup was extremely "onion-y". If I make it again, I would cut down on the onions and increase the broth.

Tasty, but ditto on too many onions, not enough broth.  While making it I didn't think this was going to be the case, but found others reviewers were right!  I'd still make it again, only adjust the quantities.

This recipe is great! I would give it 5 stars, but it took almost an hour to make. I didn't have any sherry, so I used a leftover bottle of red wine, which worked well. I first browned the onions and garlic in a little bit of olive oil, and I stirred the wine into the mixture. I also chopped up some fresh mushrooms and threw them into the wine/veggie mix. I think the mushrooms helped to add more of a "beefy" flavor. Will make again!

This soup is in dire need of its missing ingredient: butter. Brown off the onions in about 1/4 cup real butter. Use a variety of onion: Red, white, yellow, and shallot. The slightly burned butter taste combined with the onions makes this dish very special. Cut a day-old glutenous crusty bread on top and cover with greuyer or emmentaler. The sherry is a great addition. My grandmother added sherry to many of her dishes.

This came out pretty delicious! I like how light and yet still french onion-y this soup is! I followed the previous reviewers suggestions and added 8 cups of veggie broth instead of four and that seemed to have achieved a good balance between broth and onions. I also didn't have any sherry, so I substituted about 1 cup of apple cider + 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar for it (and it came out delicious!). I also grated parmesan, cheddar and a little havarti (w/dill) cheese  over the soup while it was simmering. I added about a tsp each of rosemary and thyme as well. Definitely going to make this soup again!

I made this the other night. I changed the recipe for two people on the website. Half way through making it I discovered that the amount of soup would barely fill one sm-medium size soup bowl. I had to end up adding tons more vegetable broth. I love onions but it was onion overload. I do highly recommend what MK618 suggested about adding mozzarella and parm cheese! That was the only thing that made it possible for me to eat. If I were to make this recipe again I would strain the majority of the onions out before putting into soup bowls. I think I would really enjoy it then!

The sherry made this way too sweet and I didn't even use a whole cup.  It might be better with a good red wine instead but I doubt I will make it again.

I do not like French Onion soup, but my spouse does. So I decided to make this for him beacuse it looked easy. My results were fantastic! He was very pleased.  I made some modifcations based on others' suggestions. I used two onions and added worchestershire sauce, sea salt and thyme. I could not find any sherry, so I used burgundy. I also used 2 c vegetable stock and 2 c mushroom broth to give it that beefy taste.

A very tasty soup! I haven't had proper onion soup since becoming a vegetarian years ago and this one is just like I had remembered french onion soup to be. I broiled the soup in oven safe crocks with some mozzarella cheese on top of the french bread before serving. Yum!

This soup had promise, but there were FAR too many onions, and I love onions.  Next time i'll use 2 1/2 onions instead of 4, and more broth to avoid this problem. Otherwise very good

This was just ok.  Way too many onions, too much garlic, had to thin it out with quite a lot of water.  It was too sweet, missing a "beefy" boullion base I think.

I'm still looking for a GOOD vegan onion soup.  This was not it.  As others said, WAY too many onions, and I love onions.  I couldn't get the garlic to brown, despite cooking twice as long as required.  I might cook the garlic separately if I made it again, but I didn't think the taste was good enough to bother, sorry.

I thought this soup was very "oniony".  I cut the number of onions down to 3 and added more broth and it was still to onion-heavy.  If you are partial to a more "brothy" french onion soup, try another recipe.

This was really good. I used cooking sherry but the onions didn't really turn into a paste. I had to keep adding sherry so that garlic, onions & flour didn't stick. I might try adding a little olive oil next time around! I topped it w/ the toasted french bread & a slice of provolone, broiled to melt cheese. Very filling and delicious!

Since a traditional French onion soup is low fat if you leave off the cheese topping, the point of a 'low fat' version escapes me. However I gave this a try. It wasn't terrible but was rather bland.

I made quite a few changes when trying this recipe. I used 3 1/2 onions (that is what I had). I ended up adding an extra cup of water to thin out a bit. Based on other recommendations, I used soy sauce, thyme and Worcestershire sauce. It seemed too sweet so I added roasted garlic seasoning, garlic salt and Parmesan cheese. Before arriving, I broiled the bowl of soup with a soft Wisconsin cheese on the top and served with toasted crusty French bread brushed with garlic olive oil. This was okay but not as good as others I have tasted. My family all had seconds.

Easy, quick and enjoyed by all. Did not add the sherry and used low sodium beef broth.   Made it the day before so flavors could meld.

This is a very good recipe for a very delicious onion soup, and not difficult to make.

This was the best I\onion sop I have ever made. I am alone so I cut it down to one onion but probably used more garlic than it would have been . I did find that in order to get the onion and garlic browned it took  a little longer and I don't use wine in my home so I used cider vinegar and water (one to one) and of course less broth. Will make this again many times.

This soup is excellent - I made it with homemade broth heavy on the leeks. Added a few shots of Maggie. I also followed some else's advice and added some Worcester sauce. Easy quick and oh so good
