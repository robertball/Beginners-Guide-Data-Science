EASY and DELICIOUS.  What a great combination.  A lady came into the beauty shop around Thanksgiving with these. She gave me the recipe, and I looked it up to make sure I wasn't missing any key ingredients -- if you know what I mean!  She had given me one key suggestion that might be helpful:  line the pan with parchment paper and it will come out of the pan easily.  You might have more luck cutting them if you do it before they have completely cooled.

This recipe was easy to make...my six-year-old daughter helped. The taste was good but the texture was inconsistent. They didn't cut well either.

The flavor of these bars are to die for!  I will say that the texture/consistency is a little off, though.  I tried in the 9x11 pan, as well as the 8x8, and the 9x11 worked better.  These didn't really hold together until they were put in the refrigerator overnight.  They are incredibly delicious, but weren't too much to look at since they were so gooey.  I'm still going to make them again.

I included these in my Christmas goodies that I make every year and give out as gifts.  They were a hit, plus I ate quite a few while I made them.  When you're making 5 or 6 different things, you need yummy but easy recipes and this on is.  Many people have asked me for the recipe.

I made a double recipe of these and they were gone almost before they cooled.  My family loved them!  My adult children came home, tasted these, and demanded copies of the recipe.  This is a must-try recipe.  Easy, fast, and deliciious!

This recipe was easy and good.  It's just like a Noel cookie my mom used to make when I was a kid.  She cut them into longer bars and then used green icing to write "noel" on each cookie.  Brought back memories making these.

I thought they tasted pretty good.  The top of the Noels crumbled when I tried to cut them in to squares.  While they tasted good I also want something that stays together for a cookie exchange at work.  I'll have to find another receipe to take.  These did smell wonderful in the oven - so that's a plus.

These were so delicious!! I did cook them a little longer then the recipe stated, probably about 30 mins altogether. The middle is a tad bit softer but it's so good!! The bottom almost caramelized the sugar (I used coconut sugar instead of brown), and pecans instead of walnuts. I also added another 1/2 TBSPN of flour. 
Baked in an 8×8 pan and omgosh these were the best holiday treat I've EVER tasted!! 
It's almost gone already!

Make this, you will not regret it!!!

*Edit to add a few things. 
I have made this 3 times since my last review and each time they get better. I've been doubling the recipe and using a large pan (9×13)

I've noticed that when I raise the temp to 375 and bake for 30 mins, I get a nice even and consistent texture throughout the entire dish. 

I also used 5tbspns of butter instead of 4, which gave it a beautifully slightly caramelized bottom and a delicious chewy crust around the edges (similar to brownies,- the edges are always my FAVORITE part)
I added a whole TBSPN of vanilla, which was delicious and didn't add any extra flour this time.

If your nuts are not chopped finely enough it really overpowers the cake /cookie (whichever you'd like to call it! ;)) 
My second batch had medium size peices of nuts and it was just too much, so this time I actually ground the nuts and left some smallish peices for texture and it came out fabulous!

These were very easy and yummy! They are sweet and nutty, a perfect compliment to vanilla or peppermint ice cream. I might have overbaked them a few minutes because they were a little too crisp.. so watch them closely. All in all, a great holiday dessert!

I made these today. So yummy, but mine ended up soft and chewy in the middle of the pan, but hard and crisp around the edges. I'll cut down baking time next time I make them and there will be a next time!

These were awesome. The outer layer of the  noels were a little to buttery tasteing but was great.  I think you have to eat these the same day you make because they tend to get harder the longer they sit.

I love these, and have made them for over 40 years, long before allrecipes.com existed.  In my recipe, however, you turn them out, upside down, onto parchment, then sprinkle them with the powdered sugar.  Also, since I don't care much for walnuts, and my mother couldn't chew walnuts, I always use pecans.  They're easy, quick and delicious, and every time I take them to an event, they disappear in a flash.

Maybe this could be good with a lot of work, but it's definitely not worth wasting the ingredients as is. I'm not a big fan of nuts in desserts, so I used chocolate chips in place of the walnuts, BUT the only thing that would really affect is the consistency (which people already said was off), I figured it would at least taste good. But seriously, I wish I hadn't wasted the chocolate chips. It tastes bland and sugary in a way that not even the nuts could fix. If you're going to make them, do yourself a favor and at least add some salt like all normal cookies have.

Yum! I didn't know what to expect from these because they're so simple, but delicious! I used a 9-inch square baking pan because I didn't have a 7x11. Came out just fine in the 20 minutes. Will definitely be making these again!!

If you don't have a 7"x11" pan, don't sweat. I just made these using an 8"x8" glass brownie dish and they turned out great. I used Country Crock Light instead of butter and you'd never know a substitution was made. This is a great recipe.

When I was mixing the ingredients, and noticed it's pretty much all brown sugar, I was really worried these would be sickeningly sweet. They aren't at all! They're very light, with a tasty nutty, buttery flavor. 

I did use a 9 x 11 instead, because I was afraid of them being too gooey in the middle, and it worked great- they're slightly thinner, but still light and fluffy (not cookie like). I used pecans, and I think they taste great...I made them this morning, and they are already gone! My hubby and kids are pretty picky- and they ALL said these were great!

These turned out very very sweet and gooey with hard edges. Perhaps if I make these again I will use more flour with a lower temperature and longer cooking time.

Quick, simple and very yummy. Made no changes and it is truly a hassle free treat that tastes great. Not to sweet but not bland either. Made one batch and then made another to put into the Christmas baking boxes.

Great taste, but a little flat (altitude?) LOVED the chewiness, and not too sweet!

As other reviewers have mentioned, this recipe isn't quite right. My family has been making it for decades and it's always been popular. Don't bother measuring tablespoons of flour - add 1/3 a cup, folks. And add 1/8 tsp of salt. And use whatever kind of nuts you like (we mostly use pecans and the bars have a very pecan-pie-like texture). Bake 20-25 minutes. 

But the most important thing is after you remove the pan from the oven, sift powdered sugar all over the top. Place wax paper under a wire rack and immediately invert the pan onto the rack. Let the bars cool. Then dust the bottom (now the top) with powdered sugar. And then cut into bars.

My Mom always made this with nuts and without.  She used 8" round cake pans.  We then turned them out onto a plate and dusted the the powdered sugar!

I thought I would try something new, but this was not for me!! The middle looked cooked while the edges looked spongy. I am not familiar with noel cookies/bars so I cooked them for a couple more minutes and the bottom burned. Also, I tried the top that wasn't burned and the consistency was just awkward. I think I will stick with the cookie recipes I am familiar with from now on!

This is a nice easy bar to make.  I can see why it would be a popular one with most peeople.  Rich, rich, rich!I am thinking about drizzeling  a bit of soft  carmel and chocolate over the bar  before  the sugar.  I made these to add to a couple christmas thankyous and I know they will be liked.  Thannk you, easy and tasty!
