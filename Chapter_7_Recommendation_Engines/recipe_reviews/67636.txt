They deleted important information from my recipe after I submitted it! For taffy success it is important to know that the taffy is ready when it reaches 275F AND turns a brownish color. If your taffy comes out too soft then you didn't heat it enough. Also, the taffy is ready to pull when you try to pull it away from the side of the pan and it takes on a "gelatin" consistency: solid, but elastic. Make sure you DO NOT butter your hands with this taffy - if you do it will fall apart!

Taffy is a soft ball candy and therefore the temperature should be 234F and not 275F! 275F is almost hard crack which is candy cane consistancy!

It was my first try with any kind of candy recipe and it worked! however, it tastes like butterscoth (which i also like) and is a lot harder than taffy (but not as hard as butterscotch???) Ultimately tasty and a good first try for candy.  (i did grease the pan with butter and it worked fine).  I used strawberry extract and it doesn't really taste like strawberry much.

Taffy's consistency was too "chewy." It was so chewy in fact that we couldn't chew it because it was either stuck to our teeth or the roof of our mouths.  Not to mention that the flavor was lacking also. I tasted more butter, vanilla and salt than I could the actual flavoring of the batch.  FYI-pouring it into a greased baking dish is a BIG mistake and makes for an extremely tough time trying to peel it out.  I suggest lining the baking dish with thick wax paper before pouring the mixture into it.  Overall, I won't be making this again.

I followed the recipe, but the taffy was quite a bit harder than I wanted it to be.

I did drop a small amount of the mixture at soft ball (235F - 133 C), hard ball (260F - 127C) and soft crack (275F - 135C).  The soft ball sample was very soft and sticky.  The hard ball was just about what I would like to see.  If I do this one again, I would stop near the hard ball temp.

Taste is good, but only 3stars for recipe, as it its.

I tried making this several times and I couldn't get it to ever get to that soft texture. It was always very hard, but still yummy.

The temperature is correct; you should stop at soft crack, not hard crack and as you reach that temperature you should take the pan off the heat immediately. Soft ball stage will give you very sticky soft sweets.

Taffy is definitely cooked to soft crack.

My 3-year-old daughter has been very into helping me in the kitchen lately, so I made this with her today and it turned out delicious!  We cooked it to 260 degrees (hard ball stage) and it was the absolute perfect consistency...chewy and firm, but not enough to pull out your fillings or hurt your jaw.  What a fun activity to do with kids, or without.  We happened to have raspberry flavoring and colored it pink.  We will definitely be making this again in more flavors!

Had to do this recipe twice because I didn't quite understand what "soft crack" looked like in cold water. The first turned out gooey and messy, but was a lot like airheads candy... if it were a frozen treat as that was the only way to keep it solid.

My next attempt turned out perfect, I either pulled it too long or let it cook too long because it got a litttle harder than I would have liked it (a lot like now and later candy), but it turned out great otherwise.
I made half the yield because I knew that I couldn't pull all of that taffy, as it was I pulled so long and it got so hard that I almost gave myself a blister. 
I also used a packet of kool-aid instead of the extract and food coloring. I tried the suggestion to use wax paper, which I won't do again, I just lost a bunch of taffy on the paper. I buttered my hands since I didn't butter the pan, and it didn't fall apart, but I didn't butter the pan, so that would explain that.
great recipe and I will be making lots and lots of taffy for gifts this christmas!

Though it takes more time than it says I still love this recipe. You need to be careful though because if you boil it too long it get really hard. The first time I tried I actually broke my scissors! It is fun to make and taster even better!

It was good, but it never actually formed into taffy.  We ended up loosing more than half of it on our hands, and gave up after attempting to pull it for a very long time.

This recipe is lacking three very important things. Number one, glycerin. Adding one to two teaspoons of pure 100% vegetable glycerin keeps it from being too sticky. Number two, this recipe should not be heated to 275. It should be heated to 260 F if you want a taffy consistency. Last but not least, proper cooling. The taffy needs to cool evenly for the best results so put some ice cubes in between a towel and set the cookie sheet on it. That will make the middle cool as fast as the edges. After almost a full year trying to perfect taffy making, I can say that it is possible. Don't give up if its not how you like it! Just keep trying and changing things, you'll get it.

This recipe works best if you only cook it to the firm ball stage (245 F/118 C).  Also, make sure that you heat up the candy slowly, or else it will burn.   I made that mistake the first time I tried this recipe (cooking it to the temperature the recipe said, heating it quickly), and I was sorry.   The second time I tried it, I followed my cook's intuition and took it off the heat at the firm ball stage.  It worked out wonderfully the second time, and I had to hide it from the kids so it would last more than one day.

A good place start for beginners, but after some research I feel shoot for between 260°f and 270°f would be better. Will do more research and testing.

The first time I tried this I burnt it badly :( So I tried it again. This time it came out just right in texture. After I let it cool a tad I started pulling it and noticed that the more I pulled the harder it got. Something isn't right :( The taffey tasted like a stick of sugar and I had to suck on it just to get it chewable....I'd suggest not puting so little flavor in and not cooking it so long. I had to cook it for half an hour before it was even close to the right consistency. Taffy should be easy to pull and roll, not feel like you're doing a work out at the gym! Grandma's Taffy recipe needs to be edited by it's owner.
