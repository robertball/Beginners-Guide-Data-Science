Wow! This is really good! The bottom comes out gooey and carmely. Then, there's a layer of moist cake with sweet,tender, rhubarb on top. I use Allrecipes because of the reviews and surprised myself by trying a recipe that hadn't yet been reviewed. The name is what dared me to try it, and am I ever glad I did. This is a great, easy recipe to try if you want a little change from the usual cobblers and crisps.

Awesome! I made one small change to the recipe.  I substituted some of the sugar coating for the rhubarb with a box of strawberry jello.  I think it helped to thicken the liquid and added a pretty red color and nice strawberry flavor to boot!

I used a 9 x 13 pan and it was ready in about 35 min. so keep an eye on it. (the batter and fruit was more spread out in that type of pan so it cooked faster- I think.) I used a mix of rhubarb & sliced strawberries. I don't think it is too sweet, in fact I added powdered sugar to the top after it was done in hopes that it would taste sweeter. also serving with ice cream sounds good and might balance out the tartness of the rhubarb! Thanks for the recipe, it was fun to try it out.

Mine did not come out all gooey and carmely on the bottom.  It was hard and crunchy on the bottom b/c I had to cook it longer so the cake was done. Not impressed, will not try it again.

I'll make this recipe again, but with some modifications.   First, it's too sweet! I know a previous review said this, but because that person used some sweeter fruits, I decided to try the recipe as written. Next time I'll try cutting the sugar in half. Hopefully that won't change the caramelized effect too much - I might cut closer to 2/3 cups of the sugar that gets mixed with the fruit and only cut 1/3 cup of the sugar that goes in the batter.   Second: I foolishly put this in the fridge in the original dish, and now all of the delicious caramelized crust is stuck solidly to the sides. Next time I'll transfer it to something else first!

I did just a few alterations to lighten this up.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar in the fruit. For my fruit I used rhubarb, plumbs, blueberries, blackberries.  I only did 1/4 cup butter.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar in the batter.  I added 1/2 cup applesauce along with the milk.  Turned out beautiful and super quick and easy to mix up.  Even with the sugar reductions I think it was a bit sweet for me.  This did get kid approval!  They especially liked the bready batter.

This is great.  When first prepared, I was a little concerned with the amount of butter vs batter but it is to die for. When complete, it is all nice and gooey on the bottom with a nice brown top. However, due to the amount of sugar the sides were really caramlized and hard, but still quite good.  A dollop of whiped cream on top or a scoop of vanilla ice cream really completes the dish!

I like this as a tasty and easy way to prepare rhubarb. I've made it 3 or 4 times now and I don't know how you're supposed to keep the butter on the bottom when you pour the batter on top of it ... that just won't happen. Not that it matters. It still turns out very good. I bake it for 55 min. per the recipe, but don't get the carmelization on the bottom that others have written about. I have started adding a smidge of cinnamon, and I reduce the amount of sugar to about 75% of the recipe. Will continue to make it.

AMAZING INCREDIBLE it was easy to make and so very tasty. I ended up cooking it a little longer but I use a small convection oven but it still cooked evenly and rose and browned nicely but I loved how it tasted. Will keep and use more.

I would not make this again - a very disappointing waste of my fresh rhubarb. The amount of butter is entirely too much for the amount of batter. I had to daub up about 1/2 of it with paper towels as it as cooking and this needed to bake the desert for an extra 20 minutes which made it hard on the outside and soggy near the center.

Made this and it was wonderful. I wanted a reduced sugar version so I added a few fresh strawberries cut in quarters, used a small packet of sugar free raspberry jello and exchanged half the sugar in both the fruit and batter with baking Truivia. It worked great.

Made the recipe exactly as stated. I also wondered how I would get the butter to stay on the bottom, but it really doesn't matter. Just spoon the batter on and it will take care of it's self. Will make this again, the family loved it!

Wow this turned out great! Here are the changes I made:
1) Added about 1/2 ground pecans to the melted butter, as well as some cinnamon.
2) Substituted buttermilk for the milk. This left the batter too dry, so I also added about 1/4 c. whole milk. Halved the sugar.
3) Dropped batter onto the butter base without trying to spread it evenly.
4) Added 1/2 c. - 2/4 c. fresh blueberries to the rhubarb mixture. Reduced sugar about half. Added some cinnamon.

Baked until the fruit was bubbly and the cake was done all the way through. The butter, nutty base was wonderful, and looked like the base of a pecan cinnamon roll. Just right after about an hour of cooking.

Served warm it's fantastic, but not beautiful. If this was for guests, I would add whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

We LOVED this! It took about 10 minutes longer to bake than the suggested time, but was well worth the wait. I used a two quart casserole for baking and served it with home made whipped cream. We will be having this again soon.

I was out of all-purpose flour, so I used the stone ground white wheat flour that I had on hand, added a bit more baking powder and milk, and instead of 4c of rhubarb, I did 2c frozen sour cherries and 2c rhubarb.  Then, like others recommended, I put it all in the 9x13 baking dish.  It took the 50 minutes, but probably because of the water in the frozen cherries.  I am very much making this again!  I can't wait to try it with Shiro plums!

The first time I made this, I made it to the letter. It is very sweet, but my husband liked it, so I did not reduce the sugar. The batter isn't batter in my opinion, it is very thick, more like pizza dough, and it didn't bake up through the fruit, so it was hard to tell when it was done, so I cooked it for 70 minutes like some reviewers have, and it took that

I had to cook the dessert longer, but the bottom did come out with a carmelized bottom.  Absolutely delicious!Will definitely make this one again.
