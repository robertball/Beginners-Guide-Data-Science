Very good! Instead of making as directed, I cut small squares from the crescent dough and made cups in a small muffin tin.  I then put filling in and baked them.  Nice individual appetizers and my boys loved them!

I enjoyed this recipe. Brought it to work this morning for a treat and they loved it. I prefer more seasoning, so I added crushed red pepper and black pepper, also a little onion powder. I will experiment more in the future with additional cheeses. This is a keeper!

Update 10/08: I have made this recipe countless times since my first review, the folks at work absolutely loved it everytime. It didn't last 10 minutes once I hit the door. I use Hot sausage and add a bit of red pepper flakes, I've even done a version with cheese. Always tastes great. So many options you can do.
Great recipe!!

I make these as "Sausage Puffs" in mini-muffin cups with chunks of the crescent rolls (reduced fat) on the bottom as others suggested, and they are wonderful for appetizers!  They would be specially for a brunch or super bowl-type event.  

Now I make these with 2 tblsp onion and 1 tblsp garlic added while cooking the sausage (you could add other veggies like diced green pepper, mushrooms...), then mix with 1 pkg lite cream cheese, 1 beaten egg and 1/2 cup stove top mix (I like the Savory Herbs variety).  After covering the bottom of the cups with red. fat crescent rolls, spoon a 1-2 inch scoop of sausage/cheese mixture on top, then bake 12 minutes (don't forget the cooking spray!).  You can try different kinds of sausage or flavored cream cheese for different spins as well.  I usually use the reduced fat sausage as well, and I'm sure it would work with ground turkey sausage.  I love these so will try the actual rolls as the recipe describes soon - I know the taste is great but will be curious to try it in a different format!

Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these for Christmas brunch, and my uncle (who is a chef) said they were the best thing on the buffet.  They taste really yummy with Jimmy Dean's Hot Sausage... just make sure you pinch the cresent together at the pre cut seams so they don't tear apart.

My family has made a different version of this for years and still loves it adults and kids and coworkers and friends. Take 1 lb sausage, cook (I micro for 5 min, drain) add 1 block cream cheese (micro for 1 min to soften). Stir together. Put 1 whole can cresent rolls in bottom of greased 13x9 pan, pinch seams. Put all mix on top. Add second can of cresent rolls pinch seams and sides. Bake for time on roll can. May need extra 3-4 min. Much faster and easier than individual triangles.

I make a similar recipe just prepared a little differently.  I roll the Crescent dough flat making sure the seams are well pressed together. Spread 4 oz of softened cream cheese over the dough.  Then spread the cooked sausage over the cream cheese and roll it up like a cinnamon roll.  Then slice the roll with a bread (serrated) knife. I can usually get about 12-13 slices out of the roll.  Lay them flat on a grease cookie sheet and cook at 350 for about 15-18 minutes.  They come out as perfect sausage rolls.  Mmmmm!

Great recipe! They're perfect for a quick appetizer or snack. They even make for a nice side dish for eggs at breakfast which is why I made them. I swear you could put just about anything in a Pillsbury Crescent Roll and it'll turn out great.  I cut the recipe in half and used breakfast sausage adding in a little finely chopped onion. I opted out of the the poppy seeds since I was serving this with scrambled eggs and a side of OJ! Very simple and really tasty!

Loved it.  I used 2 hot sausages and 1 mild, so it was about 3/4 of a lb.  I sauteed one small onion, threw the sausage in, seasoned with some basil, oregano, cayenne,  and garlic powder.  I ended up using 3/4 of the container of cream cheese.  I didn't bother to brush the egg white on the crescent dough.  This recipe was super easy & super good.  I would make this anytime for an easy breakfast and it goes really well with scrambled eggs and toast.

Took this to a poker party and it was gobbled up FAST!  I used turkey sausage and reduced-fat cream cheese to lower the fat content and taste was NOT compromised! YUM!

I was skeptical because I normally hate crescent rolls, but this has changed my mind.  I used Andy's suggestions and added the pepperoni and the cheddar.  I made 4 small buns from 1 package of crescent rolls.  I microwaved the pepperoni (spread out on a plate) in 20 second intervals then patted the grease off it, otherwise it would soak into the crescent rolls.  These were really good!  Watch out for salty sausages, mine were super salty even though I got sweet sausage!  Mmmmmmmm.........

I liked this a lot!  I used turkey sausage and added some torn up pieces of ham, onion, black pepper, and cream cheese.  I also added 6 (almost cooked) scrambled eggs and used garlic flavored crescent rolls.  I meant to add some shredded cheddar inside the "calzone" but forgot it and it was still very good.

This recipe was very good!  The cream cheese toned down the spiceness of the hot sausage.

I used the lower fat crescent rolls, and this didn't alter the taste at all.

I thought this was really good.  I can see a number of variations on this, but it is easy and excellent--a good complement to eggs or just all by itself along with fruit for breakfast.  Bf ate almost 3/4 of one of the rolls himself.  I didn't buy crescent rolls, but used homemade crescent roll dough.  I use the recipe from here--Golden Crescent Rolls--whenever I need crescent roll dough and it works perfectly.  Plus, I don't have to worry about the pesky lines.  ;o)  This is incredibly easy and can be done in steps if you are running out of time (eg:  sausage mixture one step, rolling out dough and putting filling in another step, baking it as the last step).  I baked this ahead of time and reheated in the microwave and it was still lovely.  thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!  Individual rolls are perfect.  Another variation is to double all the ingredients omitting the poppy seeds and egg wash - cook 2lbs of bulk sausage, drain the add 2 packages of cream cheese until combined.  In a greased 9x13 baking dish lay out one package of crescent rolls w/seams pressed together (or use 1 sheet of the crescent baking sheet) top with sausage/cream cheese mixture and top with 2nd package of crescent rolls.  Sometimes we only use 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese as it does get a little sweet.  This is a favorite in our Sunday School Class!  Simple and good!

I just finished making these for a memorial service tomorrow...I did tweet with the recipe...i added one envelope of Ranch dressing mix to two pounds of sausage and added onion powder and garlic powder...I made a 4 lb sausage batch...my little logs must have been bigger than others as I only used 7 cans of crescent rolls..I let them cool off in refrigerator to cool before slicing...when I sliced them I just cut each one in 1/4ths which is a little bigger than 1 1/2 inches...the recipe calls for ungreased cookie sheet but found they turned out better with a little non-stick spray on bottom of cookie sheet worked better...and would make up six at a time to place on cookie sheet...with so many made I place tooth picks in after I sliced them...everybody loves them...I served them cold..

I think this is one recipe I have used the most from All Recipes. My old boss used to make it at our company breakfasts, so I stole the recipe and have been using it during the holidays, at tailgates, when company comes to town and everyone says the same thing: WHAT is in this and OMG that is so delicious. With only three main ingredients, it is definitely one easy and SCRUMPTIOUS treat. I think it's best with spicy sausage although I have used plain sausage too. I have had it with other breakfast ingredients inside such as eggs and peppers.

My mom made these quite frequently when I was growing up.  Always a hit and very easy to make.  I use original pork sausage (sage flavor) and add salt and pepper to taste.  I omit the egg and poppy seeds, but that's just my preference.

We quite enjoyed this. How much easier does it get? I used store bought pizza dough and along with the sausage/cream cheese I sauteed mushrooms, onions and added some roast beef and pepper jack that was in the crisper. Cooked at 425 for about 13 minutes and it was done. The only thing I might change was it says to cool the sausage/cream cheese mixture entirely. That's goofy to me. Next time I'll just add it to the dough immediately and then bake and serve. I see no reason to let it cool. Thanks.

This recipe is very good.But just a little to much cream cheese for me.Will def make again.There are so many different things you can do with this.I think next time I will add green onion,less cr cheese,and maybe some cheddar cheese.Or even try using a flavored cream cheese.just half the amount though.

Wow!! This recipe is awesome. I subbed Gimme Lean vegan sausage and vegan cream cheese. I had a fair amount of sausage mixture left over so I made some vegan white gravy with the remaining mix. So delicious and my brunch guests LOVED it!

These were very tasty, and so easy! I will definitely make them again. They were eaten as fast as I was slicing them. Next time I will double the recipe. Made per recipe, but excluded the poppy seeds (didn't have any)   I knew I would like these becuase the filling is what I always use to stuff mushrooms, which is another crowd pleaser!

This was really good and super easy to make. I only used one can of crescent rolls and stuffed it as full as I could and just had a little meat leftover.

This was pretty good and very easy. I think I should have added a little more spice, but it really depends on the sausage you use.

I absolutely love this recipe! I add chopped green onions and I don't use the egg wash or poppy seeds.  My whole family loves this recipe and I am frequently getting requests for it.  This has become our Sunday morning tradition, as it is so easy and plenty for everyone. The creamy mildness of the cream cheese is a perfect match for the spicy sausage and makes for a great comfort food!

Made by the recipe.  Crowd pleaser from my young kids to the adults at church.  Great for sharing, it's so simple and impresses all (for presentation the egg white/poppy seeds are a must).  To keep dough from getting gooey while forming the roll, leave in the fridge until the last minute.  I love this website! Predictable results and time-tested tips.

I made this recipe exactly as called for, just assembled it a bit differently.  I spread the first roll of dough onto a cookie sheet, spread the sausage mixture evenly over it, leaving a tad bit of room on the edges.  Then spread the second roll of dough over the top, crimping the two rolls together.  I thought it was wonderful.  However, the next time I make it, I may just use regular sausage instead of the spicy.  The spicy was a bit too much for the kids and some older folks.  Make sure you drain the sausage good or it will be a bit soggy.

i added chopped garlic and fresh rosemary from the garden. This is a quick and easy recipe that is very good. Try changing the type of cheese and spice how you like it.

These were very good!  I made them for breakfast, so I also scrambled some eggs with basil and put them into the rolls.  Along with the cream cheese, I addes some mozzarella and cheddar, too.  It was a perfect breakfast!

I used medium instead of spicy sausage and I didn't use egg white or poppy seeds. This is delicious. If you have leftover cooked ground sausage in your fridge, you can still make this by just reheating it gently in the skillet and then following the recipe. This is usually how I do mine. This is good at breakfast or anytime. Make these in little one-roll portions for hors d'oeuvres at parties and they always go fast. In the fall, I serve this with a nice big salad for an easy dinner. Oh, and if you want a flavor boost, try adding freshly chopped sage to the mixture- awesome.

My husbands favorite thing ever. I have made it weekly only because I refuse to make it more often for fear he will tire of something so easy to make.

Pillsbury now makes a seamless crescent roll, so no more lines to pinch.  I buy reg sausage which ever brands on sale, Owens or deans, less fat, anyway I add red pepper and onion, wallah spicier without being to spicy.

Don't omit the egg wash, it makes the breading flakier, but I find the poppy seeds annoying and don't add anything at all.

My hubby who is picky, says the inside tastes like yummy sausage gravy.  It does, it's wierd.

I think I'll try this with other things inside, it's opened up a world lol

Yum, yum, yum! Before I made this, I roasted six seeded jalapeños and laid them out on one package of the crescent rolls before I spread them with the sausage and cream cheese. I only made 1/2 a recipe, but I'll be making this again and again. I'm going to reheat some each morning for my breakfast. Reminds me of my favorite stuffed jalapeño recipe. Great idea!

I am generally not much of a fan of crescent rolls but these were really good. I used bulk mild Italian sausage, 1/4 cup diced onions plus all of the other ingredients. It made 8 sausage crescent rolls. when I used a pair of triangle of dough for each  roll. I sauteed the onion along with the sausage. I made individual sausage crescent rolls and I did use the egg white but not the poppy seeds. I ate one one of the rolls while it was hot and fresh with some fluffy scrambled eggs and froze the rest of the sausage crescent rolls for a quick to reheat breakfast during the week. Andy, thanks for this quick to make and tasty recipe!

Was really good, but I think there was too much cream cheese, a little too sweet and rich for dinner. I am looking forward to making these again with eggs and bacon for breakfast, and different toppings with marinara for other flavored dinners! Thanks!

I made these for dinner with some roasted red potatoes.  I used grands buttermilk biscuits instead of crescent rolls.   I rolled out the dough and put a large spoon full of the sausage/cream cheese mix, a large spoon full of scrambled eggs, and some shredded cheddar.  They came out like a breakfast biscuit hot pocket.  So yummy!

I have made this 4 times.  Huge hit!  I don't like the poppyseed, so I don't use it.  Unstead, I add a little chopped green onion and some pepperoni slices to kick it up a notch.

I made some changes to this since all I had was sweet italian sausage & FF cream cheese and I thought it might be a tad bland as written.  I added dried diced onion, pizza seasoning and sun-dried tomatoes to the sausage and cream cheese mixture. I divided each roll of biscuits into 4 rectangles which made me 8 rolls/puffs. I lined each one with a few slices of turkey pepperoni underneath the filling.  Before placing them in the oven, I topped them with some shredded cheese. The dough directions called for 375 degrees, so thats what I baked them at, for 15 minutes.  These turned out pretty spicy from the pepperoni, which my bf LOVED, thus the 4 stars.  I tried one and honestly wasn't too impressed- I would give 2 or 3 stars.  Might make these again for the bf...

YUMMY! This is soooo good! My slight alterations? I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescents. Also I used half spicy and half regular sausage (husband is not a huge fan of spicy) And they were sooooooo good. I am going to make another batch and see how well they hold up to a freezer for a quick fix meal!

I made this recipe into appetizers and they were a big hit I added a cup of shredded pepper jack cheese after sausage has time to cool so it does not melt. Seperate crescent rolls into rectangles and press seams together. Cut each into fours. Put a spoonful of the mixture on each and surround meat mixture totally with dough and make sure seams are sealed. Kind of roll into balls. Makes 30 great sausage appetizer. Omitted egg white and poppyseed, just brush tops with butter

Soooooo delicious! I used Jimmy Dean sage flavored sausage and added a few shakes of my pizza seasonings into it (which is basically garlic, dried onion, italian herbs and crushed red pepper - all good sausage flavorings) since I'd read someone else's review saying that the cream cheese helps cut any spiciness of the sausage, and they were right. Don't be afraid to have very flavorful sausage since the cheese tones it down somewhat (no where near bland, just down a tad). Also I found that you can buy a tube of crescent dough without the crescents cut out. They sell the exact same thing just as one big rectangle, so no more pinching the seams together for purposes like this. The tube packaging even markets it for appetizers and such like this. This is a wonderful flavor and a new favorite in my house!

we have made these for years.
One great thing to do is to use the chive & onion cream cheese, or sub diced ham for the sausage.

These were okay... my nine year old loved them, (of course, i didn't tell him it was cream cheese in the middle)  I might make again and add a little something more to the mixture for more flavor.  I made individual rolls, will try the log next time.  Very basic, so much more could be done with these I think.  But still a good recipe, thanks!

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could. I made only minor changes in that I used loose sweet Italian sausage and sprinkled on a little shredded mozzarella. They were easy to prepare and tasted wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

I have been preparing this for years, but as written it is quite bland. Here are my modifications: brown the sausage with half a diced onion and garlic. Add a dash of cayenne pepper. Substitute Velveeta for the cream cheese...cube up a two inch chunk and mix in while sausage is still hot. I have also tried some shredded carrot and bell pepper. Makes a very pretty presentation. I don't bother with the poppy seed or egg wash. This is always a favorite appetizer.

I used Italian pork sausage instead of spicy. To make it a more well rounded lunch I added sauteed chard to the cream cheese/sausage mix. If you don't have chard, spinach would be a good substitute. I formed the crescent rolls into medium sized pockets instead of big logs that needed slicing because I served them as lunch and not as an appetizer.

These are simply awesome!!! I would recommend not skimping when filling them, as you end up with ends with just the crescent rolls, but overall awesome!!!

these were pretty good when first made but even better the next day, cold!  I cut the cresent roll dough into squares and put in the mini muffiin tin and cooked them that way with some added italian seasoning and even a little bit of taco cheese mixed in.  I actually liked them better the next day and did not reheat them.  I will make again.

Made these for a superbowl party and they were a HUGE hit.  I did add some Italian seasoning to the mixture because it tasted a little bland to me.  Also, instead of poppyseeds, I used dried rosemary.  They were outstanding!

My family fell in love with "sausage rolls" over our time living in Scotland.  We miss them so much, but these certainly brought us back...  These are not quite as flaky as the ones we had before and they also include cheese (which the original ones didn't) but we definitely embraced the changes!  These were quick and easy to make!  I was sure the dough would pop open and the cheese and sausage would come oozing out, but it didn't!  You just need to make sure to pinch all the holes and lines (where the crescents were meant to be cut) are sealed tightly.  I accidently picked up a box of "neufchatel cheese" instead of regular cream cheese which made it a bit tougher to get the creamy consistency it called for.  But, once it was all wrapped up in the crescent rolls, it was all so yummy!  I also used sweet italian sausage instead of spicy pork sausage (b/c that's what I had on hand) and added red pepper flakes to one of the logs for my husband and I.  This is definitely something I'll make again and will have fun trying different cheeses and meats and (as others suggested) some other sizes and shapes (i.e. bite size squares, triangles, mini muffin cups).  This is a good one... thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent recipe for game day appetizers. I used Italian sausage, but next time, I think I will try it with Chorizo sausage, and a little finely chopped green pepper. Wash it down with an icy cold Leinie's Creamy Dark.

My brother and my boyfriend really love this meal! I like to add a layer of pepperoni underneath the sausage mixture, and I also leave out the poppy seeds if I don't have any on hand -- it doesn't seem to bother any of us taste-wise. We love this recipe!

Made these for a client and everyone loved them!  Only modification made was to add a little bit of brown sugar when cooking the meat as we purchased the hot sausage.  Thanks for the recipe will definately be using this again.

Just tasty!  So many variations you could use.  Because the mixture still seemed a little stiff while heating it, I added just a couple of tablespoons of white nacho cheese to give the mixture a creamy fluidity.  Next time I will vary the ingredients using onions, green/red peppers for taste, texture and color.  Enjoy!

These were actually excellent!  I had some filling left over so just rolled some up in a regular croissant, I think I will do them this way from now on.  I also added carmelized onion, which I think enhanced the flavor.

This has become my husbands favorite.  The first time I made it, he asked me if I got it from Schwans.  I have made a few additions - I add broccoli or cauliflower, onions, mushrooms and other little leftover items taking up space in the refrigerator (potatoes and even some spanish rice).

These are really good!  I skipped brushing them with the egg white.  I also used the sheets of crescent rolls instead of separate rolls.  Worked so well and was really easy.  Would work great to make up a batch to have for breakfast during the week.

Not bad.  Skipped the egg white and seeds, added pepperoni.  Next time may add some pizza sauce, either poured over the top with some mozzarella as a main dish, or to dip with appetizers

I love these, the hot sausage makes all the difference. I really like the idea of pepperoni and cheese, but it's just too heavy for my diet. I add a dash of black Mr. Pepper and garlic powder. Will make these again and again.

This was really tasty!  I reduced the recipe by half and it was plenty for the 2 of us.  I used hot breakfast sausage and added a little onion salt, black pepper and mixed in a handful of cheddar cheese with the cream cheese. Didn't bother with the egg wash since the cresent rolls always brown up nicely by themselves. Definitely keeping this recipe around.  Thanks!

easy, easy easy! Rarely does a recipe get this easy with such delicous results.  I've used this as an appetizer, breakfast sandwhich, and find that people gobble them up as quick as they hit a serving tray.

I made these in a muffin pan (each had a triangle of crescent roll and a spoonful of sausage mixture). They were a hit. Next time I will put them in a muffin baking cup so I will not have a pan to clean!

Unbelievable. This is my favorite thing to make for breakfast. I do reduce the cream cheese a bit because it is a tiny bit too much but really, this is the most incredible thing I have made in a long time. I use Jimmy Dean "Seriously Bold" Sage Sausage because the bold, spicy taste works really well with the sweet creaminess of the cream cheese.

These were fantastic!  I was looking for something different to feed my "crew" (husband and 4 kids all ages) for breakfast and happened to have everything I needed for this recipe in the fridge.  The kids LOVED the sausage rolls...my husband isn't a big sausage eater, so I made some with ham instead of sausage, which were just as good.  I also added shredded cheese to both.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing...

These were ok.  They were very rich (I used just over half the 8oz tub of chive & onion cream cheese).  I also used regular sweet sausage because I was intimidated by the hot sausage!!  But next time I will try the hot and hope for better results!!  My husband and I had this for dinner, served with scrambled eggs.

These are great.  I had them at a wedding reception once and asked the caterer how to make them.  She just told me they were simiple and only had sausage and cream cheese in them.  i couldn't believe something so good had so few ingredients.  Can't wait to have them again...

Even though while cooking these the fumes alone made my arteries harden, they are awesome! I made one "log" with sausage and cream cheese in the middle. I used one package of crescent rolls rolled out with my rolling pin to make sure all the triangles were sealed, then put it seam side down and put shredded cheddar on top. I baked at 350º for 15 minutes then turned it up to 400º for 5 minutes. PERFECT. Served with scrambled eggs and applesauce.

Quite surprised at the high remarks everyone gave this.  I love cream cheese, but this was way to much, even for my FI who eats anything.  We discussed while eating it and here is what I will try next time: 1/2 pkg cream cheese ( maybe jalapeno flavored or sun dried tomato) pepperoni and mozzarella and shredded cheese.  I know this is quite different, but it really needs it.

I fixed this recipe yesterday and it was a HIT! I chopped up the pepperoni and added to the sausage mix.  The aroma was so great, it was hard for the folks to allow the rolls to cool. Quick, easy and tasty!  Try it.  Marty

I used turkey breakfast sausage and lower-fat cream cheese.  The flavors work well but I think you have to know what you're getting.  It's VERY rich and heavy.  I think if you're serving it as part of a buffet breakfast or brunch or potluck where a number of people may only take a tiny bit, it's great.  If it's the only dish for a breakfast, it's too heavy.  I think a 1 1/2 inch slice is a lot.

After reading the reviews, I used the muffin tin idea. I used one chub turkey sausage and one chub of vegetarain sausage-cooked in separate pans.  So, one package of cresent rolls for each kind of meat. Two trays of tins to keep them seperate. Lastly, I reduced the cream cheese by half and used garlic & herb. Served the sausage puffs with a green salad & butternut squash soup...delicious!

Great for appetizers... Also super good made with Bridge Port unbaked bread loafs.  Just roll out, fill, roll up and bake.  Slice as you would for sliced bread.  Just noticed how long ago other comments were made.  No current ones?

This was great! Gave 4 stars only because we changed the recipes a little to suit our tastes. We used ground turkey and added an onion, pepper, and a couple spices (curry powder and garlic).

Amazing! I didn't have poppy seeds, but didn't feel like I was missing anything. We also just made individuals (wrapped up each of the little triangles of dough) instead of a log, which was great! I used Jimmy Dean Fully Cooked Hearty Sausage Crumbles, and it was perfect. So delicious and simple... thank you!!

I made a mistake and bought plain ground turkey instead of turkey sausage, so I added some garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and sage when browning the turkey. I also finely diced one medium onion and sauteed it along with the turkey. After adding the onion (which was an excellent addition) and the cream cheese, I found that the mixture was a bit too thick so I just poured in about 1/8 or 1/4 cup milk which made it perfect. It was easier for me to lay out half the crescent dough onto the cookie sheet, put the meat mixture in the middle of it in the shape of a log, and then place the other unrolled half of the dough on top of it and close all the seams. I didn't have poppy seeds but these turned out golden and delicious! My husband liked them too. Even though they were great with plain ground turkey, next time I will definitely try turkey sausage. I think it will be even better.

Very tasty!! Everyone ate (even my 3 toddlers). I halved the recipe, added 1/4 small onion, a small clove of garlic,used only about 2 -3 oz. of reduced fat cream cheese and omitted the poppy seeds(didn't have any). I did use mont. jack cheese on top the  sausage mixture . I served it with home fries and scrambled eggs.

This was an average recipe for us.  My husband said it was "okay," but my daughter didn't want to finish hers.  I thought it was good for a change of pace, but not spectacular.  Not sure I'll be making this again as written.    I think it's a great idea, so I might play with it and try different combinations of fillings.

This was absolutely delicious! I used Jimmy Dean sausage, light cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls. Didn't use the poppy seeds. We had this as a breakfast-for-dinner meal, and I served it with some hash browns and eggs. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe, but I added some Franks Hot Sauce to give it that punch of flavor. I added some shredded old cheese on top of the crescent rolls, makes a great looking touch...

This was so good. I can see having this for a brunch. A dressed up version of biscuits and gravy. I made a milk gravy to go with it from the sausage grease. YUM!

Extremely tasty!  I used country style sausage but added some red pepper flakes to and it was plenty spicy for me and my family.  I also added onion while cooking the sausage and it tasted great!  On rolled out the crescent rolls and placed pepperoni and shredded cheese in the center before I added the sausage/cheese mix and they were awesome!  I served it with eggs, bacon, and biscuits for a nice "Breakfast" dinner.

I sauteed my sausage with garlic and chopped fresh spinach.  I would have preferred a mild shredded cheese rather than the cream cheese.  I only used half the recommended amount and it was WAY too much and didnt care for the filling too much....I will adjust this next time, the concept is a good one and easy to keep the ingredients on hand for a fast dinner.

Excellent, I used a crescent roll dough recips from this site. Wher I blended 1/2 whole wheat flour into the recipe. They were so good. A great Hot Pocket Idea. There is no limit to what you can fill them with. Thank you so much for this recipe.

We make this a lot.  The basic recipe gets 5 starts, but don't stop there, add your own flavors and spices.  I brush over an egg then some ground red pepper instead of poppy seeds.  We've made this spicy and mild, added green pepper, if I have it.  Used green onion and sometimes a bit of celery.  I've also put in pepperoni.  Anyway, it's one of those clean out the fridge kind of rolls.  Great versatile recipe.

This is amazing.  I had never even heard of it before and my mother in law made it last night for us to snack on.  Instead of using regular cream cheese she used Philadelphia Light with garlic and herbs, then she added some Italian seasoning on top after applying the egg white.  It was so good!!  My husband even liked it--and he doesn't like cream cheese!  This is a five star rating for sure!

My husband just about did flips for these. I used mini muffin pans like others did. I just used 1lb sausage w/my seasonings, 1 block cream cheese, and one tube of cresent rolls. Made 24. Will probably do again. Were good in a pinch.

I make something very similiar to this. I add an onion to the sausage mixture while it is browning and don't bother with the egg mixture and poppy seeds on the top. I absolutely love this and have actually been craving it for a couple of days now!

Made this recipe two times now.  Both turned out great and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and the second time I made it with chicken apple sausage from the local butcher and omitted the seeds because I had none.  Both were great each with it's own taste!!

Very good and very easy.  I don't like to brush the top with egg whites and poppy seeds, though.  I think it's just fine minus those two ingredients.

This was really, really good. I first had this when a vendor/visitor brought this in for breakfast. I searched for this recipe and this is pretty darn close to what he brought in from a nice restaurant. I added some ground black pepper. I never would have thought to have this for breakfast. Thanks for the post.

I also made these with sausage, pepperoni and cheese, although I think the possibilities are endless (next time I would omit the sausage, and add onion and tomato to the pepperoni.) They were very good! Thanks, Andy!

Absolutely Wonderful!  We LOVED it!  I will use this recipe a lot.  Made this Christmas morning!  Thinking of using it for a baby shower I am giving in January.  I had no problems at all with dough or leaking or anything!  I didn't even find the richness a problem. I used sausage with maple.  My daughter said it tasted like a "McGriddle" (which she loves).  Using different flavored sausages can make this very versatile (sage, etc.)  Thanks for a super-easy, yet wonderful recipe!

I DID serve these to guest and I should have made more. I made "mini" rolls by cutting each triangle of dough in a diagonal. I only used pork (flavored with salt and pepper) and cream cheese. Then baked! Voila... instant carb heaven!! Thank you for the recipe it was a huge success.

I think these are pretty good and my kids gobbled them up but they aren't anything super special.  They were very easy to make and I like that they can be served a room temperature.  I would make these as an occasional snack for the kids but I don't think I would go so far as to serve them to guests.  We made one roll with just the sausage mixture and one which included the pepperoni. I didn't think the pepperoni added so much that I would bother with that again.  Also, I had no problem with the filling leaking out as other reviewers have mentioned.  I prepared the crescent rolls on parchment paper and pressed the seams well.  When it was time to turn them over I just pulled up on the parchment to flip them and then peeled the paper back again.

This was really easy and my husband and kids just gobbled it up!  We ate 3/4 of it at dinner.  I only used 6 ounces of Neufchatel (light cream cheese), and didn't let the sausage mixture cool.  I laid out the crescent roll dough on the baking sheet, placed the sausage mixture in the middle, then brought the sides up and overlapped the top.  It cooked beautifully this way.  I also omitted the egg (we have an allergy) and poppy seeds.  I ended up cooking it at 375 for about 15 minutes.  It would probably be really good with spinach in the sausage mixture!

I made this for a picnic.  I added slices of pepperoni on the bottom of the sausage mixture.  It was a big hit!  It was quick and easy to make. Great recipe when you have to take along something and do not have to heat up.

This was a hit for my cousin at Thanksgiving.  I recently tried this recipe and it was pretty simple to make until I got to the rolling part of the crescents it sure turned out ugly the first time I made it but now I am doing a lot better at it.  By the way this was great tasting anyways and Jimmie Dean Hot Sausage works the best.

This was easy and delicious! I halved this recipe and it still made a lot! I used a half lb. of Jimmy Dean plain ground sausage and added 1/4 tsp. each of crushed red pepper, black pepper and onion powder while cooking the sausage, before stirring in the half pkg. of cream cheese. Toughest part of this recipe was flipping the roll over to seam side down. Hubby loved it with his eggs for Sunday breakfast!

Awesome sausage roll with a couple of additions. I laid down a row of Hormel sliced pepperoni two 'chips' wide. Then a layer of sausage/cream cheese, followed by grated cheddar cheese on top. BTW, this is absolutely scrumptious if you use Jimmy Dean sausage.

I haven't made these yet, but they sound really good. I have one question; can I freeze these. I'd like to make them for my husband and I, but I would have to freeze them as we can't eat all 20 of them to quickly. Lol. I would sure like some input on this please.

I followed familyofcampers suggestions. I used 2 pounds of pork sausage an two packages of crescent rolls with 2 packages of cream cheese. I greased a 9x13 baking dish and laid one package of rolls on the bottom, then spooned the pork mixture in and covered with a second package of crescent rolls. Baked for about 20 minutes. Was very good and very quick and easy. Will definitely make again.

Good.  Took others advise and tried with sharp cheddar and substituted some of sausage with chorizo.  Also fried some red peppers with sausage.  These additions made this appetizer better.  Also good warm.

This was really good!  I ended up following the recipe exactly, except I made an egg-shaped wreath with the crescent rolls by overlapping the dough into an egg shape, adding stuffing to the base, and folding the dough back to the middle.  It was beautiful and my guests oo'd and aw'd.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it tasted really processed to me.  Obviously it's made with processed/ convenient foods, but i think next time I'll try and play around a bit and maybe use half cheddar/ half cream cheese, or all cheddar.  I'm also going to do less sausage with the addition of scrambled eggs.

This was a huge hit at our NYE party! I used a flavored cream cheese and didn't bake it as one big log. I cut the dough into 2 inch squares and baked smaller individual versions. So delicious and so easy...this is definitely a new go-to party recipe for me.

Very good. Very tasty. Quick and easy. The only thing I changed with the recipe was I put grated cheese on top instead of the poppy seeds. Whats great about this recipe is you can really play with it, really have fun with the stuffing.

My girlfriend makes this for me all the time. She calls it "Breakfast In A Banket". If you wanna spice it up a little, she sometimes adds a can of drained and rinsed Rotel. Very Tasty!

I thought these were really good, not spectacular.  However, they were super easy and my kids, ages 12 and 14 loved them, so I'll definitely make them again!

These are so good!  I used turkey sausage and also added some scrambled eggs, cheese (colby and american) and ham pieces as someone suggested.  They are so rich and filling.  I made half the recipe and split one of the rolls w/ my husband and we were full. I think I will try making them with only 2 triangles each and refridgerate them so they're ready for later in the week and in individual portions.  I will definitely make these again, and also use it as a base for more recipes.  thanks!

What a great, simple recipe!  Took other rater's suggestion for the muffin pan and they came out perfectly.  The possibilities of variations are many, and makes for a good way to clean out the fridge/pantry.  Son gave this a nod for a 'do again' in the future.  Thanks!

Served on Christmas morning, everyone loved them. The only thing is, when they say spicy sausage, they mean it. I used regular and it was a little dulls-ville.

This was so easy to make. I took it to a breakfast pitch-in...everyone wanted the recipe. It is very yummy. I used turkey sausage and low fat crescent rolls, but it turned out great.

Made this on Christmas morning - used the large crescent rolls, low fat cream cheese, and a mild country sausage from our local grocer.  I added some sage and white pepper, and rolled it into the logs.  My kids loved it and renamed it biscuits and gravy "to go."  We ate it warm right from the oven and it was really good.  Just don't tell the kids it has cream cheese in it!

Really tasty, but hard to put/keep the crescent roll together.  I even rolled it out to keep the seams together and it was still "leaking"  filling was very good, I mixed mine 1/2 cream cheese, 1/2 cheese whiz and added jalapeno peppers.  Really good, but messy
