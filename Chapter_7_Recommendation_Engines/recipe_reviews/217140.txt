I made this for Easter Sunday Brunch and it was delicious!  I added more eggs with some milk also, as it didn't seem like enough liquid for the amount of potato/bacon/onion mixture I had made.  Served with a nice fruit salad, it was delightful.

Good recipe! My husband loves breakfast casseroles. I made some modifications. First I used turkey sausage (trying not to give hubs a heart attack) :) I didn't drain the bacon grease but did drain after I cooked up the onion mix. I used 12 eggs and added milk, added 1 16oz bag of shredded hash browns to the eggs after I beat them. After meat and veggies were cool and drained I put that in the bottom of my dish and poured the egg/potato mixture over that and stirred together. I don't have time in the morning to bake this so I am letting it sit for a few hours, bake tonight and serve re heated tomorrow. My husband will re heat and eat it all week for breakfast. Me on the other hand is not a fan of reheating eggs. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe went together easily the night before. I loved the texture of the finished product - many egg based breakfast casserole recipes lack firmness and body. This one was great!

Since I did not make this as an Easter dish, I stirred half the shredded cheese into the egg/potato mixture and sprinkled half on top. I diced the black olives and also stirred them into the mixture. 

This recipe would also be great with just one of the meats - I may try sausage only next time. And the amount of meat in the recipe as published is generous. The finished product would still be great with one pound of either bacon or sausage.

21 guests gave it a rave! Well, there was one piece left over...sadly the smoke and hot sauces were not added and I used a package of potatoes that was not 3 pounds! My concern, too, is how HARD it was to spread the cheese on a very hot casserole (but worth it). Thank you for sharing this Easter-specific winning recipe!

I'm always on the lookout for new makeaheadable breakfast foods for when we have overnight guests.  I was intrigued by the ingredient list, and the fact this recipe was "faceless", and decided to give this a whirl.  I had some mild sausage I needed to use, so I decased it and used it in lieu of the bulk pork and I subbed ham for bacon.  I knew I wasn't going the cross route, so I mixed 1/2 the cheese in w/the casserole and topped it w/the other 1/2 per directions.  This was tasty, but none of us tasted the chiles or the liquid smoke or red pepper sauce.  While we enjoyed it, it won't replace "Amish Breakfast Casserole" as my go to.  THANKS for the recipe, LisaD!

It's good, needs some tweaking, not enough egg and flavor isn't strong, but I have another casserole which I like more so I'm gonna stick with it

My family enjoyed it but I think I will try using toast instead of hash browns next time.  Or maybe a different brand of hash browns.  The consistency of my first attempt was not what I expected.

Everyone loved it! This will become my go to breakfast casserole. I added an extra egg and 1/4 c milk and it was perfect. I use Knors hollandase sauce to drizzle over it.

I also wish I had read the reviews prior to making it. It was way too dry. I would have mixed cheese into the  and put more on top. Also way too much potato. Might have been better to put the hash browns on the bottom as a kind of crust than too have it mixed throughout. Overall taste was good, but I think it'd be way better with a few tweaks.

I should have read the reviews before I made it because would have done things differently. Way, way too dry. Needed milk or sour cream. And def mix in the cheese with the mixture. And then put extra cheese on top. But by then I can just make my tried & true hash brown casserole & just add bacon from this recipe. Also, I would even out the ratio between  hash browns & meat. Quite disappointing.

I liked this recipe a lot and got rave reviews. The reason I gave it four stars however is because I would have added maybe 3/4 the amount of meat, and more egg. Although I love potato, I felt it soaked up all the egg and I could barely taste there was actually egg in it. Other than that, flavor was great. I will definitely make again with these changes.
