This cake was amazingly moist for one with no eggs or dairy.  It also works well as a vanilla cake...just omit the cocoa powder.

This cake was delicious!  It was very moist and easy to make.  I lost my old recipe and was happy to find this one.  I only made a few changes:  I used 1 cup of water and 1 tsp of vanilla.  For “frosting” my mother always cut a piece of cake and then put a dollop of cool whip with some sliced bananas on top (didn’t do it on the whole cake so it didn’t get soggy) and it tasted fantastic!

This was my first ever attempt at a scratch cake, without a box. I had promised my son cupcakes, only to find that I had no box, no eggs and no money. This is THE BEST cake I've ever eaten. EVER. Duncan Hines is FIRED.

This is truly the best cholocate cake I have ever eaten. My mother gave me this recipe years ago.  I lost the recipe and was very happy to see it here.  My 12 year old daughter loves to make it.  We cook it in a bunt pan. It is very moist and easy to make.  You can add nuts, choc. chips or anything else you might like to add to it.  It is wonderful with frosting but we eat it without and love it!

This is one of my most requested cakes! I just love it!I have variations of it. However, I usually make it with Duncans Hines Dark Chocolate Cake Mix without making this cake from scratch!

This was a decent cake. I had to improvise a little bit because I didn't have enough mayonnaise. I therefore added an egg to the batter resulting in a fairly satisfying result. I just wish I could find a recipe that is as light and fluffy as the Betty Crocker cake mixes.

This isn't a 5 star cake in my book, but I really like it.  Hadn't eaten or made a mayo cake in years. I used it as a chocolate strawberry shortcake with whipped cream on top. Next time, I'll add another Tablespoon of cocoa to the batter.   There will be a next time because this cake is so easy.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9" round.   I think this would be good with caramel or peanut butter frosting.

I've just made these and they came out great. I made half the recipe and used 3 T. cocoa instead of 4. It was a little salty because of the mayonnaise so next time I'm going to use 1/8 t. salt instead of 1/4 t.   I made cupcakes and used cupcake liners. It will make 10 cupcakes, not 12. I baked mine for 15 minutes and they were perfect.

This was exactly what I was looking for when a sudden craving for chocolate cake hit me last night. It had simple ingredients which I had on hand and it was super easy to make. I halved the recipe and made half a dozen cupcakes that turned out super moist and delicious.

When the kids saw my putting mayonnaise in the bowl they all though I was crazy and refused to try it but I convinced them to give it a chance, and they loved them, especially with Wedding Cake Frosting From this site. There are very few left as I made 2 dozen cupcakes and they barely got one done before they wanted another one, this is similar to the recipe my mom used when I was a kid the only difference I think is growing up all we had in the house was Miracle Whip and even though I still use Miracle Whip my husband likes Hellmans, so I used that. My daughter likes alot of chocolate so she said that the recipe could have used more Cocoa but my husband is not a huge fan of Chocolate and said they were perfect, choclatey but not to choclatey and overly sweet like the store bought cake mixes. I will definately use this one again it is a big hit at my house. Thank you for the wonderful Recipe.

This cake was very good.  I was a little hesitant at first because of the name, but it turned out to be one of the easiest and tastiest cakes I've made from scratch!!  I made it in a bundt cake mold, so it did take longer than the suggested time, about 15 minutes longer, but worth it!

I followed this recipe exactly.  I usually don't have any problems with baking, but this turned out heavy and left a greasy aftertaste.  I just dusted it with powdered sugar like I usually do with chocolate cake when I am in a hurry and the kids want some, but I really don't think any kind of frosting would have saved the taste.  It did however, turn out moist.  I won't be making this again.

This is pretty much identical to the mayo cake recipe I lost. It is THE best chocolate cake, in my opinion. Don't fool yourselves into saying it "uses mayo instead of eggs and oil". Mayo IS eggs and oil.

I guess mayonnaise sucks up the chocolate and sugar in this concoction, because I could taste neither. It did have a nice dark moist appearance, though.

It has a nice texture, but the taste doesn't taste like regular chocolate cake.  There is something peculiar about the taste of this cake....  Still ok, though.  The person I gave it to really liked it.

This didn't have much of a chocolatey taste, and it turned out very doughy, almost gummy.  Maybe it will taste better tomorrow.

Just ok.  Not what I wanted.  Not enough chocolate flavor - even though I added extra cocoa powder.  It was very moist - just not very sweet or chocolatey.

My mom always made this cake and it was alway our favorite chocolate cake.  Stays moist a lot longer than most other cakes.

I have made this cake for years. It is the most moist chocolate cake I have ever made from scratch. I usually use a 11x7 brownie pan and it fits just fine. Bake for about 35 min. I always put cream cheese frosting on it (a friend's mother always did this) either homemade or out of a store bought tub. Delicious!

Yes, I tried this recipe and I thought it was excellent! Served with cocoa powder drizzle and ice cream-YUMMY! I didn't alter the recipe as I always make a new recipe as listed to see if I want to alter it and this one stays as is!

Flavor good, but definitely dry.  May have to add some more mayo next time.  I cooked it in a bundt pan for 35 minutes (skewer still wet at 25 minutes, but maybe I should have pulled it out then).

After reading the reviews, I decided to play it safe and doubled the chocolate. I also had to double the water because the batter was way too thick. Then once it was done I was disappointed with a very plain and very dry. Nothing spectacular or impressive, nothing like the mayonnaise cake that I had at a bridal shower for a friend (the influence for my trying to find a good recipe).

I make this all the time with my 3 year old!  It is so easy and so good.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I don't even mind him eating the batter because there's no eggs!

This was ok. It tasted like boxed cake mix, which I don't care for. I could've just bought cake mix and saved some time.

This is a good basic recipe, but I made some of the changes recommended by other reviewers and it turned out great.

I added a total of 8 tablespoons of cocoa and an additional 1/4 cup of sugar. This made the cake great- not too much or too little.

I also reduced the mayo by 1/4 cup as recommended, but I have a feeling this is why the cake turned out a little crumbly. 

Finally, I baked it in a train shaped cake that probably equaled an 9x13 sheet, and it was a little thinner than I planned but still good. It would be better in a bunt or loaf pan.

This is an awesome recipe.  I was looking for one because I remember my mom making a mayo cake when I was a little girl.  My husband said it was excellent.  He hates mayonnaise so it made for a good joke too!  Thanks!

I keep looking for a really chocolatey cake with the right texture.  This was great!  Moist and dense but still crumbly--not spongy.  I added 1-2 tablespoons extra cocoa.  Baked in a bundt pan and it took a bit longer and sank a bit, but it was still delicious!!  With chocolate frosting drizzled over the top it was a chocoholic's dream.  I'll definittely make this again.
