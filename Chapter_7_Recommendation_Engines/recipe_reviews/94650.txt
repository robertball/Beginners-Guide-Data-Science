Really cute idea! I made these for a snack and while a bit messy it's definitely worth a try. Don't overstuff the tortillas a thin layer will do - nice and sweet!

This recipe is very simple and not at all messy like previous reviewers suggested... if you do it right. DO NOT spread to the corners of the tortilla. Only spread the jam/cream cheese to about a full inch before the edges. I cook mine in my quesadilla maker, and as long as I do this and only cook them for 5 minutes, I never have a mess. A great snack. Doesnt really need the extra sugar, IMO, better without. :) Probably best to let cool a minute or two before cutting up/eating, too. Hot jam will burn your tounge!

Sweeten the cream cheese with a little sprinkle of sugar and a few drops of vanilla extract or lemon juice and instead of putting the jam in the quesadilla, heat it up and serve it on the side. Now THAT is tasty!! (And no mess) :)

I served this with a great recipe for taco soup. It was a nice dessert but very hard to make. The jam liquifies and becomes very messy. Then, clean up is horrible because everything is gooooee. I'd never make this again, a few people said they liked it, but it wasn't worth the mess. Sorry!

I tried this recipe because those were the only ingredients I had in my kitchen. I wasn't feeling the creamy fruity thing. I left out the fruity and made kind of a grill cheese sandwich. Except the cheese was cream cheese and the bread was a tortilla. I buttered up a pan and just browned the folded cream cheese filled tortilla. Now thats a great snack. MMMM.....

I tried these again with a little less cream cheese and grilled with a little butter instead of cooking spray and they were much better.

I didn't do them quesadilla style. I did a burrito/soft taco style. Just spread cream cheese on a single tortilla, spread strawberry jam on top of that. Rolled and heated it in a frying pan with a little bit of butter. Turned nice and brown.. Yummers

My daughter and her friends LOVED this snack.  Good idea is let them cool just a bit(not so they are cold though)  lying flat before you serve. They don't ooze as much, and don't spread the mix too close to the edge of the tortilla, in case they do ooze.  Less mess if you don't.  Of course, food that oozes, is always the tastiest!!!  Grape jelly w/cream cheese was the most popular.

This is pretty good, but I certainly didn't use all ingredients as measured.  Just seems like a lot of cream cheese and jam, plus a lot of powdered sugar.  I didn't measure, but I just spread a thin layer of the cream cheese and the jam on the tortilla, keeping about 1 inch empty around the ends.  They are a bit gooey, but not bad if you are careful to make sure that u only use a little bit.  A little goes a long way in this recipe!  Then I cut and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  A nice little snack.  Thanks.

Overall, this is a simple and yummy snack. It is a little bit messy while eating, but that has nothing to do with the taste.

These are Delicious! I'm not sure why everyone is saying these are messy---they aren't. The Cream Cheese and jam should be a little closer to the center, as it will spread out. The heat should be perfectly medium, because higher heat will cause the jam  to become runny. As written it's really delicious. I literally just finished eating mine. I used low sugar jam (that's all I had) and it turned out okay. The Powdered sugar really makes it pop! I'm definitely going to make this again.

I admit I completely changed this recipe  but I'm giving it a 5 because it was a great imitation of a similar  crepe recipe I have and now I can cut out making the crepes! Instead of putting the jam and cheese in the quesadilla, I took  the cream cheese (softened) and added some sugar and vanilla. I mixed it all up. Then  I smeared some of the mixture on one half of the tortilla to about 1/4 or 1/2 an inch from the edge. Then I sealed the edges. Warmed the  tortilla on both sides in a hot skillet. I removed the tortilla and then spooned strawberry preserves on top. Eat it with a spoon or fork. It was delicious!

I tried this, and it was messy and my kids dripped jelly all over. BUT then I tried it like a burrito with the cream cheese and jelly, then I grilled it in my George Foreman Grill and all the jelly stayed in and it was a really fun and MESS FREE dessert! We will make these all the time now!

I really wanted to love this, but I just didn't.  My family mentioned that the taste reminded them of a toaster pastry, and when I ate mine, that really is what it made me think of.  Not bad, but I doubt that I'll make them again.

Followed the suggestion of not spreading to the edge and it worked perfectly. I used left over cranberry relish from Thanksgiving (cranberries, oranges, apples)and it was delicious. Not at all messy during cooking, but when it came time to eat, it made a bit of a mess. Totally worth it though!

I thought this was really good.  I was looking for something sweet to make with things I had in the house.  I did add a little brown sugar to the cream cheese and didn't dust with powdered sugar.  A yummy bed time snack.  Thanks Jenni I am sure we will have these again!

Made this with strawberry cream cheese.  Make sure you leave space on the edge of the tortilla so that it doesn't ooze off.  Makes a GREAT snack and not too sweet since I didn't use jam!

I loved the premise of this at first (a fruity skillet treat!), but it simply doesn't work. Floury tortillas just don't taste good with cream cheese, and the strawberry jelly doesn't "stick" like cheese wuold when you make a regular quesadilla. Instead, it just oozes out, burns in the skillet, smells up the kitchen, and leaves you with a sticky mess.

When I first stumbled upon this recipe I thought it looked rather odd. Luckily I had all these ingredients so I thought I'd give it a try. I do recommend to carefully pull it out of the pan. When I did, the jelly had melted and poured everywhere.

My kids thought this was brilliant. I used low carb tortillas, FF cream cheese and homemade jam. Nice for an occasional treat.

It isn't fancy but it's fast and hits the spot so it deserves 5 stars.  I used butter on the pan, rather than cooking spray and went easy on the cream cheese and jam so it didn't make much of a mess.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point. These are great.  I used Knudsen's cheesecake flavored cream cheese, omitted the jam, browned them in a little butter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the finished quesadillas. I didn't find them messy at all. I let them cool a but before I cut them with a pizza cutter.

I liked the idea of this recipe but the jam liquifies and oozes out.  It might work with pie filling rather than jam.

This was very easy and very good, I actually made them for breakfast this morning....I know some people have complained about the mess of the jam liquifying I did not have a problem, but I expected that so I kept the jam more in the center 1 inch away from edges and it did come right to the edge at the end of cooking but did not spill out.  This made a great and easy breakfast for the kids.

Interesting, that is for sure. I thought it was gross and messy. My sister and her friend loved it though.

These were delicious.  My family loved them for dessert.  They couldn't believe that this combination would be sooo good and were pleasantly suprised.

Pretty good. Needs work and adjustment, but I liked the taste.

I looked at this recipe as a guide line of sorts. I didn't like the idea of just using strawberry jelly so I got frozen a bag of frozen raspberries and mixed berries and just whipped in a tsp of sugar with them. I did originally have problems with the filling oozing everywhere until I just mixed the fruit mixture with the cream cheese with seemed to stay inside the tortilla a little better. Nice light snack and very easy to make =)

This is a very good after school snack.  I warmed my quesadillas in a quesadilla maker, so each one only took a minute and there was very little mess.  I served them with fresh strawberries.  Thanks!

The jelly did get really runny, so it was hard to get the jelly to stay in each bite I took, but it was still delicious :D

Very messy, but so good. I didn't have strawberry jam, so I used a thin layer of blackberry jam and a sliced strawberry. I will make this again and just use sliced strawberries sprinkled with a  little sweetner. It's the jam that melted so much and was so messy.  It was yummy for breakfast though!
