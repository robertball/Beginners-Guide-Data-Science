I know this recipe was submitted by Egg Farmers of Ontario but unfortunately I have to say that while I did enjoy this salad and will happily make it again, it is much better without the eggs for a number of reasons.  First, there is no way to avoid the little egg yolk "crumbs" that cling unattractively to the potatoes and beans.  Leaving out the eggs would give this a much cleaner, brighter look. Second, I believe this salad is best served at room temperature and I'd feel more comfortable doing that without the eggs.  Third, while this may just be a personal thing, the texture of the eggs against the potatoes and  green beans was off putting for me.  Finally, it needed something "fresh" and green I think, which would not only look pretty but would give it a burst of fresh flavor it really does need - I used chopped green onion, but any fresh herb would do - tarragon and dill come to mind, or even parsley.  Still, as this recipe's first reviewer, I happily report this is quite a lovely salad with a nicely seasoned, well-balanced vinaigrette.

I agree about not adding the eggs to the salad but I did surround the salad with quartered boiled eggs and it looked lovely, and it is best at room temp so the surrounding eggs can be addd before serving.  I also do think it needed some oniony flavor so added spring green onions and that really made the dish pop.  Such a pleasant fresh taste of spring in this one, it's definitely a keeper.

This was a really nice salad.  I followed the suggestion of not mixing eggs throughout, but I dressed the salad first, then topped with salted egg quarters.  I liked the egg a lot with it, and potato/green bean salads have been a staple of mine forever.  Added green onions which I think are a necessity.  Nice vinaigrette also.  Next time I'd like to serve on a bed of spinach, think that will work well and look nice.  Took this on a picnic and worked well for that.

Made it twice now. Easy, quick, and the kids loved it (13 years old) and they are getting picky. Good warm or cold. Next time I will try with frozen beans to see if I like it as much.
