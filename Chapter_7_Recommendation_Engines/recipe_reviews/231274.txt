This was really good!  

I did not have time to soak the millet and it still worked out just fine (the texture had a little bit more of a bite, but that didn't bother us at all).

I added the curry powder, cumin and millet to the onions and garlic and cooked for a minute or so before adding the water.

Next time I will use ghee instead of olive oil and add a little cayenne.

Thanks for a delicious recipe!!


Instead of adding 1 tsp. of salt, I just added it to taste.

Great, simple recipe. I used only 2 cups of water and that was enough (maybe too much water) to cook the millet through. No soaking necessary. Toasted the millet with the onion. Super easy side dish!

This was a very good and interesting recipe for millet. I didn`t soak the millet, maybe this step depends on millet, but mine didn`t need it. Tasty, this recipe makes a great breakfast.

This was pretty good I think I would have added a little more curry however it was still good. I did add tomato, I did add culantro and peas, I did add a scotch bonnet pepper to the pot just to give it some heat I used grapeseed oil. I sauteed the garlic and onions with the curry and the tomatoes before adding the Millet and the peas. I didn't soak the millet I just rinsed it off prior. After the two and a half cups of water I just added the cumin and some salt and pepper.  I've been meaning to try millet, this is my first time ever making it so i'm happy it was simpler than I thought, and I think the next time I make this I will add some golden ray butter and maybe some carrot.

I may have over-soaked the millet, but I added the required water and covered for 20 minutes and it was a millet soup. The water didn't seem to be absorbing. Added an extra 30 minutes cook time with the lid off.

My husband doesn't like curry but it is even good without curry.
