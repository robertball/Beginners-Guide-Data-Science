This recipe is outstanding! My wife & kids loved these cookies, and I'll make this one again soon. I thought the lime might be overpowering, but it was good.

I love these cookies!  Not quite the same consistency as the normal cookie, but still I am happy with it.  I doubled the rum (hehe) , and it gives it a little bite of a corn bread texture. I made it for our Mother's Day brunch & everyone loved them.

These cookies were not a favorite, but I'm sure they just meet a required taste. Thanks anyways!

I didn't have the super fine cornmeal, so I used the Albers that I had on hand. Still delish, still light and wholesome, but admittedly a bit gritty at the end...we were ok with that and ate 'em happily. The butter content is what makes these amazing. I used unsweetened coconut, shredded real small, I think chunkier would have been more interesting and it could have stood the mini amount of sugar that comes with sweetened coconut. I will make these again, they are unique and satisfying.
