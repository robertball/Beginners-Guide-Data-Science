Very good. It reminded me of the filling for German Chocolate Cake. I used it over waffles. The only thing I had a bit of difficulty with is that it wanted to get too thick (Maybe it is supposed to be that way though) so I kept trying to thin it out with water. Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good on waffles.  I think it would be good over ice-cream, too.

OMG SO GOOD. i only used one egg since some of the other reviews indicated it was too thick- it worked beautifully. it kept fine for a week, just reheated it to serve for leftovers. a delicious way to dress up waffles or pancakes.

I have made this twice, very good flavor but I couldn't get it to thicken either time.
