My family really liked this and I thought it was ok...sausage really added flavor.  The thing for me, is I make these pasta bakes often and I didn't think the Starter really added anything...same amount of time, number of dishes used and slightly more expensive using the Recipe Starter then if I made my own.

My husband really liked this and he doesn't usually like pasta dishes...He loved the taste of the fresh basil....He did say it could use more sauce though, I agree.
I added a can of tomato sauce and used ground beef instead of sausage(I don't like sausage).I also cooked the onion with the beef and garlic instead of adding it with the sauce...

My husband looooves this and he is a very picky eater.  The thing about this recipe is I just use whatever I have on hand.  If I have an egg, great, if not, oh well.  I use whatever cheese I happen to have and it's different every time.  I use cream cheese instead of ricotta because my husband hates ricotta.  I have made this probably 10+ times and it's different every time and always tastes amazing!

I made so many changes to this recipe that it's hard to rate it. However, what I did to it made it really good. I used penne (instead of ziti), ground beef (instead of sausage), 1 T. dried basil (instead of fresh), cottage cheese (instead of ricotta), and I added Italian seasoning plus 1/2 a jar of Herdez Guajillo Cooking Sauce. I also added salt. This turned out delicious.
