12.4.15  I liked the taste of these bars, but they are crumbly and falling apart.  I read the Cook's Notes, but I don't think you can tell what the consistency is going to be until you bake them.  I packed them firmly into the dish and actually baked them an additional 5 minutes.  Followed the recipe except for using white chocolate chips (what I had on hand) and roughly chopping the pecans.  Good, but the fact that I can't just pick one up and eat without crumbs all over the place is a disappointment.

Very tasty!  After reading previous comments on consistency, I added 1/4c more honey.  I also made it without chocolate chips.

I like the simplicity of this recipe. I added a lot more honey then the recipe calls for, but overall it's fantastic!
