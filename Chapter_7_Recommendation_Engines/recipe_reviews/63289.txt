This recipe was fine, but that's it.  Not very flavorful and while it was pretty simple to make, I don't think I will be repeating it.

This was really good.  Very simple recipe that you can throw together at the end of a hard day in about 20 minutes.  Served with boiled red potatoes and Cajun Buttered Corn from this site.  Thanks for posting

Thank you. I made this dish with this hot blonde director I'm dating for lunch. So its also a good recipe for food therapy. Completely misread the recipe and combined all ingredients with the melted butter, made on the gas grill outside and even with this mistake it was crazy tasty , looked fabby and impressed me & my date quite a bit. We r discussing what she's making for our next date ! Thanks

Good basic recipe, needed a little more seasoning . I added paprika, scallions bc I didn't have chives. Sauteed some mushrooms and spooned the sauce over it and was very tasty! Will make again
