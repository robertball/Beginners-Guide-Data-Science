I'm not too familiar with making scones, so my review may not be educated. The dough seemed very wet, therefore when I dropped on parchment paper with a cookie scoop, they spread and baked rather flat. Maybe I used too much liquid? The dough needs a pinch of salt.  The scones were very tender and light. Not heavy and dense. The flavors were spot on, however, I'm not sure the pears add any flavor. Next time I will chop them fairly small so as to not have chunks of clear pear falling out of the scone. I will definitely make them again doing the following... 1. Less liquid  2. Add salt to the dough. 3. Chop the pears small. Baking temp and time was right on. Adding a little butter to the warm scones help compensate for the lack of salt in the dough.

These came out of the oven gorgeous, with that subtle sweetness typical of scones. My husband called them “impressive” but I was not as impressed. I baked them until golden brown, but even after thoroughly cooling, they were very soft, almost a too-moist cake texture rather than the harder scone texture I was hoping for. I subbed melted coconut oil for the canola, and maybe that was the issue? But since I am not a fan of canola oil, I don’t keep it on hand. I didn’t care for the glaze taste, and I think some almond or vanilla flavor in both the scone and the glaze could improve it. Appearance: 5 stars. Texture: 2 stars Taste: 3 stars

I’m not a baker by any stretch of the imagination, but I love scones.  We had a lot of leftover pears after a sale at our local market, and my wife wanted to use them.  So, we gave it a try...easy, quick, and pretty foolproof, even with my lack of skills.  The orange glaze really takes it over the top.  I made nine larger scones rather than the dozen the recipe prescribed.  I guess it’s an American thing.  I’ll definitely be adding this to Sunday morning family breakfast often.

Use buttermilk instead of the silk and the scones will rise beautifully and taste much better too!

I followed the recipe and my first batch turned out like flat round pancakes, slightly raised.
