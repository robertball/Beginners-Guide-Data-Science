Ok - I changed the recipe quite a bit, and I know a lot of people hate that, but personally, I always appreciate it when people add onto recipes -- reading people's changes has REALLY strenghtened my own cooking skills.  So that said, I'm going to give my changes here!  I used the full 8 oz of cream cheese and 1 can of flaked crab meat (drained).  I was out of garlic salt so used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt instead (2 tsp seemed like an awful lot!).  I also stirred in two chopped green onions.  I used the suggestion of another reviewer and rather than frying filled won ton wrappers, I spooned 1 T of refrigerated croissant dough into mini-muffin cups, filled each cup with the mixture, and baked for about 15 minutes.  Too much crab for a Chinese crab puff, in my opinion (I've always had them with mostly cream cheese), but ignoring the original intent of the recipe, I REALLY like the idea of having "portable" crab dip appetizers!  I will make them this way again for parties!

I thought these needed some other seasonings, so I cut the garlic salt by half and added some Cavender's Greek Seasoning, parmesan cheese, and some green onion.  For those that don't eat fried foods I put puff pastry into mini muffin cups then put about a teaspoon of the crab mixture in it and baked it for about 15 minutes at 375F.

Would have given it 5 stars, but it needed fresh crushed garlic and chopped green onion. Make sure you serve these immediately after frying. They need to be hot and crisp. Thanks.

I just tried this recipe, and I must say that it is a great starter recipe. I did read reviews and mad some changes from them. I used 1 package of immatation crab meat, 2 packages of cream cheese, green onions, garlic salt, pepper. I made a couple tasted and then added 1 tsp sugar. And the end result was GREAT! Just like the resturants. Just cant fold as pretty..lol I used Melissas Won Ton Wraps, and folded like a square, and no problems with them opening at all. This is overall a very good base recipe. Kudos to you!

These are great and very easy.  However, next time I will put more cream cheese or less crab to make it creamier. I will also add some minced green onions for flavor. But as it stands, this recipe is very, very good!

I have made this recipe several times.  I tried making them ahead for my Christmas appetizer menu.  I wouldn't suggest making the formed puffs more than 24 hours ahead.  It happened that I prepped more than I needed and cooked what remained on the second day.  The won ton skins were a bit soggy and when cooked, were a bit chewy.  They were still devoured.

I absolutely love these. I did do the garlic powder/seasoning salt change because I don't have garlic salt. After I formed all the puffs I had 36 of them, way too many for 1 person. I placed what I wouldn't eat on a cookie sheet and froze till firm then placed them in a Ziploc bag then back into the freezer. I cooked the rest several weeks later and they taste like I just made them five minutes ago.

With the addition of minced green onions, garlic powder and a bit of creamy horseradish, these were excellent. Thanks for sharing.

These are insanely yummy and addictive...my husband doesn't care for cream cheese and my daughter has denounced all seafood, so my 4-year old son and I ate a ton of these while watching a video together.  Will definitely make again!!!

Very easy and delicious :) Our Daughter is turning 16 and she wants an "Asian Themed" Party this will most def be on the menu next weekend when she turns 16! It makes quite a few puffs so not so hard on the budget! I recommend dipping in sweet and sour.

Ok so this was a good starting point.  I had my pregnant sister over who was craving crab puffs but didnt want the crab. I made as is and used shrimp bullion and sauteed minced green and white onion and also a little garlic for hers.  I made mine the regular way with canned crab and I kinda liked the ones I made for her better.

I (along with my family) thought these were too salty and had too much crabmeat. Next time I make them I will use 6oz of crabmeat and use garlic powder leaving the rest of the ingrediants the same!

Excellent.  Did not put crab in because i am pregnant and can not have shell fish.  Tasted like crab puffs from Panda Express.  Husband and 1 year old son devoured them.  also made a sweet and sour sauce off wonton package for dipping.  will definitely make again and add crab next time.

I didn't like these at all.  The filling was bland and quite obviously just a mixture of crab meat and cream cheese...even after adding diced onion and fresh garlic.  I had made these for a holiday party, but didn't feel comfortable serving them.  What a waste.

Added some green onions and a splash of soy sauce.  Turned out well....was missing the water chestnuts to give it some crunch, but still very good.  Served it with a honey sesame sauce.  Thanks for the post.

Instead of deep fat frying, I sprayed a cupcake pan with oil and baked it at 375 degrees. I  spread out a  won ton wrapper to fit the cup and filled the wrapper half way with the crab mixture. I baked them until they were crispy on the bottom. I also added chopped green onions to the mixture. These were a great appetizer that I will be making every year when we have an abundance of crab from our beach vacation. Loved these baked & so much easier than frying them. Next time I will decrease the amount of garlic salt too.
