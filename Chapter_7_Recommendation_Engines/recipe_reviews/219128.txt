I loved this! Hubby did too though he would have preferred it without the green peppers (my fault - thought he liked them!) I tweaked it a bit - used mozzarella cheese and crushed red pepper instead of mont jack (what I had onhand) and I added cottage cheese for some protein. Combined all the filling ingredients (in my case - cott cheese mushrooms scallions pepperoni green pepper real bacon black olives cheddar and mozz cheese along with Italian seasoning) with part marinara/part pizza sauce (again - using up ingred I had onhand) - stuffed shells topped w/more sauce cheese and sprinkled w/parm cheese. So yummy and it made tons (plus was able to assemble it early in the day bake later serving alongside texas toast salad and steamed asparagus - great meal!)

Delicious take on pizza and stuffed shells! I only used one can of tomatoes thinking it would have been too much but next time I will use both. I did had some crushed red pepper and garlic powder to the sauce just as a personal preference. I used mozzarella only because I forgot the Monterey jack but I think a mixture would be even better. My little guy went crazy for them. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

YUM! I added in some ricotta that needed to be used and some cooked crumbled hot sausage that I had in the freezer. I just mixed it all together (including the pepperoni) and filled the shells. I put them into the baking dish and topped them w/ the sauce cheese and some extra mini pepperoni. I baked them about 30 mins. covered w/ foil then removed the foil and baked about 10 mins. longer. These had great flavor! I loved the concept of these and love the fact that you can pretty much use any of your favorite pizza toppings (I'm planning to add some sliced black olives next time as well). Family really enjoyed these and I will be making them again! Thanks for sharing.:)

Super good! Takes a little time for prep but well worth it. I left the veggies out and replaced it with hamburger meat to suit the kiddos and added half the pepperoni to the meat mix with a good handful of parm. I sprinkled the rest of the pepperoni on the top along with the cheese and some parsley. I LOVE how you can add anything or take out anything to suit your personal taste. Hit with the husband kids alike;)
