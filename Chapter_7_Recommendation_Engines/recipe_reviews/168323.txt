I loved this! It's wonderful with crackers and goat or havarti cheese, as well as over pork. I have worked in catering and at fancy events we would prepare a cheese tray with many different cheeses and ramekins of honey (sprinkled with a few white sesame seeds) and chutney along with nice crackers. We provided little demitasse spoons and cheese knives so everyone could pick their favorite cracker and cheese and then drizzle some honey and chutney on top. The sweet/savory flavor is so sophisticated! This combination was always available at the most elegant events. Just be sure to not cook too long or you will end up with cherry jam!

This is a great idea.  Execution could be better. The recipe above is heavy on the vinegar and sugar and the cherry flavor takes a back seat. Tried it again with only 3 Tbsp cider vinegar, a lot less sugar, and used Garam Masala paste instead of Chinese five spice, and it was spot on.  Thanks for the idea though!

This recipe had tons of great flavor from the fruit and the spices, but we felt it was a bit heavy on the vinegar. When we make it again, we will add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more brown sugar. We also added about an 1/8 teaspoon cardamom. Yum!

I made this exactly per recipe. It made three 8 oz. jars with a little bit left over. It is great mixed with plain yogurt. Will try it on oatmeal too.

This is one of the best chutneys I have ever tasted!  I would not change a thing.  The 5 spice seasoning and cider vinegar are key, so don't skimp there.

I made it with Bing cherries and substituted the Chinese Five Spice for Curry powder. Came out a beautiful golden color. It was kinda soupy though so I added some cornstarch to thicken it a little...I guess I could have added a touch of pectin but I wasn't looking for a jam like consistency. Tasted yummy

Vinegar, vinegar, vinegar!  I reduced the vinegar before I made it because it seemed like a suspiciously high amount, and it was still pretty much inedible.  I cooked it for 3 hours hoping to cook some of the vinegar off.  Nope.  It was pickled cherries.  I did think the Chinese Five Spice was a good shortcut seasoning, but Garam Masala would be much more authentic.

Too bitter for our tastes--there was no cherry taste but only onion, made bitter by too much Chinese Five Spice. I'll try another recipe in future.

I made it today and it was WAY too vinegary!  I'm going to try again but with only a tad of vinegar.
