This was easy and delicious. I took the advice of some other reviewers regarding the mint filler, and used about 2 tablespoons of milk, a teaspoon of peppermint extract, about 2 tablespoons of additional powdered sugar and some green food coloring instead of the creme de menthe. Turned out super. Also, for the other folks who are in a hurry like I was, my cake wasn't entirely cooled, I only chilled the mint layer for about 15 minutes before adding the chocolate and chilling for only about another 1 1/2 hours. Turned out fabulous. Thank you!

I was given this almost exact recipe from my sister-in-law several years ago.  About the only difference is I use a few drops of peppermint extract in place of the creme d√© menthe.  I also add a couple drops of either green or red food coloring.  I don't let mine chill more than about 45 mins. or the top tends to crack easily when you are trying to cut it.  Also, I divide the pan into about 4 sections, saving one to eat immediately, and the other 3 are cut up and put on paper plates then in plastic freezer bags.  They freeze nicely and thaw quickly when you are looking for a quick dessert or have someone drop in unexpectedly.  I try to keep a couple plates in the freezer at all times.

This is a fail proof recipe. I made so many mistakes( over beating the butter till it seperated for both batter and icing) and I was amazed that the cake still turned out yummy! I used one teaspoon of mint extract and that worked great. TO salvage my cake, I placed it in the freezer and it still tasted fudgey and moist! granted the cake layer isn't the most chocolatey, the whole combination worked really well. It was like eating Andes Mint or After Eight mint cakes! A real keeper!

This is a terrific dessert! The cake part is soooo moist and chocolatey, while the mint layer is very subtle, not too overpowering. The only thing I did differently is to drizzle the chocolate glaze very heavily over the top of the mint layer, as opposed to spreading it. For my ladies luncheon, I wanted more of the green to show because I thought it made a beautiful presentation. Spreading the glaze would have give it a chocolate cake look. BTW the chocolate glaze is more of a frosting that sets up hard and has a tendency to crack. For this reason, too, I think a heavy drizzle pattern would be better than spreading. Thanks Sally!

I made these last night.  Very simple.  Very good.  I wanted to follow the recipe very badly...unfortunately I "sampled" the Creme de menthe.  It was just strong enough that when I "sampled" the Mint layer I couldn't taste enough mint...so I added more.  Tasting the completed effort today without any prior sampling  was a surprise of the extra minty flavor.  A little too much, but entirely my fault!!  Next time I'll try not to cook like Julia Childs.

I didn't have any creme de menthe so I used 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract, a little paste green food coloring, and about a tablespoon of milk in the icing.  It tasted great.  I put the iced cake in the refrigerator to chill, then added the chocolate glaze.  After about 15 minutes it was set enough to cut easily without cracking (as some other reviewers had mentioned).  It cut cleanly and neatly.  Although this was very good (actually, I had a hard time stopping eating it), I only gave it 4 stars because in the past I've made a similar recipe with a brownie base and I prefer that since it's more chocolatey than this cake.

Exceptional cake!  The actual cake is more like a brownie and is very moist and flavourful.  I didn't have any creme de menthe so I went with 2 tbls of milk and 1/2 tsp of mint extract.  Also, I only chilled the final product for about an hour before cutting them to avoid the chocolate glaze cracking.  It cut clean and made a beautiful presentation.  Everyone LOVED these and wanted me to make them again!  Thanks!

This dessert tastes really good like a giant Jr. Mint and the consistency is like brownie/fudge.  I made it for a party and everyone agreed it was VERY rich. My recommendation would be to cut it into bite sized pieces and serve like fudge.

Absolutely divine!  I had a craving for a chocolate mint brownie dessert, and this recipe was JUST what I imagined.  My family loved this and I will be making it again for sure!  Thank you so much!

These are great! I think that they were even better once they were really chilled. More like a brownie than a cake. I added cream chesse to the frosting. yum, yum!

I really did like this but you need to grease and flour the pan.  It's very difficult to get out otherwise.  It does need to be refrigerated or it tastes weird, but my problem is that the cake is too hard and dry right out of the fridge.  It's soft and moist if you don't refrigerate it, but then the rest of it tastes gross.  Probably not something I'd try again.

This was excellent. The cake was more brownie like but better.  The only thing I thought (and I love chocolate) was there was to mucc. Next time I won't pour as much on.

I am giving this 3 stars because it was alot of work for an "okay" turn out.  The favor was great but the candy hardened so much that the cake couldn't shine through.  I don't know that I would define these as "rich" maybe more towards heavy.  Thanks for the recipe submitter, and I will keep looking.

This turned out wonderfully!  I took Necia's recommendations about the mint layer and added about four drops of green food coloring.  I received lots of compliments about the dessert.  It definitely has a nice (though not overwhelming) mint flavor.

Very yummy and a very pretty dessert to take to a luncheon.  I was afraid that I wasn't going to have time to get it done though since you have to let the cake cool completely before you put the mint and chocolate layers on it but I stuck it in the freezer for about 30-45 minutes and it worked perfectly.  This almost resembles some sort of fudge.  MAN IT WAS GOOOOOODDDDD!!!

Very good! Has a brownie like consistency. However needed at least 3 drops of food colouring to get the  mint layer green enough.

This was a good one!  I made this for St Patty's Day and it was a big hit.  I too used peppermint extract and green food coloring.  I also added a little extra powdered sugar and milk to the green layer for better coverage over the cake.  Instead of regular chocolate chips, I used the mint chocolate chips for the topping.  Yummo!!

YUMMY!  I didn't have chocolate chips, so we just had the cake (more like the brownie) with the icing.  It was very good.

This is excellent. Althought, I did not know where to get the menthe liqueur so, I just got Peppermint flavoring and it worked just as well. Also, note that the cake needs to be in the refridgerator for at least 3 hours, so "ready in" time should be more like 4 1/2 hours.

I only have a 9 3/4" round baking pan, so I scaled the recipe by 1 1/2 times to bake it as 2 layers. Being the amateur I am, I can't really tell if the cake's actually done or if it's just moist, so I let them sit for an extra 5 to 8 mins. Still, they kept getting stuck on the pan and onto my serving tin even though everything was greased. Maybe I'll use waxed paper with it next time. I also didn't have creme de menthe, so I just bought mint chocolates and melted them for a filling. I also added honey and vanilla to the glaze and it came out fine too. Overall, the cake tasted great and a friend commented that it had the dense texture of a cheesecake, and I had people scraping off of the tray where the cake got stuck. Will definitely try it again in future!
