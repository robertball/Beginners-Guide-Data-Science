i used my chicken broth to boil my rice and also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushrooms. plus i also didnt have any mixed vegetables on hand so used broccoli and corn. the biscuits gave the meal a homey taste. VERY GOOD! will make again!

The onion was overpowering for this recipe.  Just Ok.  Not Great.

It didnt really have much flavor, and the rice was a little over powering. But i absolutely loved the biscuits. Next time i might try using canned veggies instead of frozen and maybe use a half or a another whole can of cream of chicken to make it a more soupy dish. I might also line the bottom with biscuits too.
