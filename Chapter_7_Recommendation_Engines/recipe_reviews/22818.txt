This was good ! I used a one pan method... I cubed skinless chicken breasts and sauteed it in large oven safe saute pan, took them out when almost cooked through. In the same pan I sauteed cubed potatoes, carrots, celery, onions, and 2 minced cloves of garlic, when vegetables are almost tender I added in 1 can butter beans and the 2 cans of soups plus 2 cups of water or you can use low sodium chicken broth. Simmered it all together until everything is tender, and topped with refrigerated biscuits and simmered for another 7-8 minutes. I put the whole thing in the oven to broil until gloden brown and a little crispy on top of the biscuits. It was sensational !

This was pretty good, a bit bland, but I did have to add a lot of liquid so that might have something to do with it. My toddler ate enthusiactically so I can't complain, but I think I will try a different recipe next time I'm in the mood for dumplings. I am keeping this one on file, though; with a little personalization it could be great.

I think this is a great base recipe. It was a bit bland. We added salt and pepper and it helped but was still missing something. I'm going to try boiling the chicken with chicken broth next time and see if it gives it the flavor I'm looking for.

Very tasty, I omitted the noodles and made fresh biscut dough instead. The cream of chicken soup was a very easy option, and tasted great! My husband loved it, and I'm sure I will make it again. Thanks for an easy and tastey recipe!

This was excellent, but it's not chicken and dumplings.  It's chicken and biscuits.

This was very bland and we did not like the addition of pasta, will stick with my recipe that takes me all day long to cook.  I just thought I would try this for a week day dinner.

My husband made this the first time and we absolutely love it.  We use thighs instead of breasts. We think it gives it more flavor. We made this while camping with family and now whole family wants the recipe.

This was tasty, but I did add quite a bit of spice.  A good base recipe, but it does need a few added veggies and spices.

We enjoyed this recipe. I did not add the pasta and let it cook down. To save it for leftovers I only added half the dumplings (biscuits). When we warmed it up a few days later I added the other half.

I have to admit that I only used this as a guideline, I left out the potatoes and the pasta, but the cream soups added a wonderful flavor, and made this super easy.  Highly recommend this recipe.
