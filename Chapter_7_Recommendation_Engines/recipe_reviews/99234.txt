Good recipe but if you are cooking Pacific lobster, as opposed to Maine lobster, shorten the cooking time to 10 minutes or the lobster will be a little tough.

This was great! The lobsters came out really good. The only thing I messed up was that I started up the water kind of late during dinner. Well, that amount of water takes quite a bit of time to start boiling! That's my bad - the recipe relly is perfect.

Interesting additions... Do all those ingredients really change the flavor of one of the best tasting foods in the world? We'll try it...  Cooking lobster tonight.   FYI, boiling small,  Maine lobsters ("chickens") takes way less time.  Put'm in boilin' water --- bring pot back to full boil for 5 minutes.  Then kill the burner but keep the chickens in the water for another 5 -- sweet and juicy.

It tasted like regular lobster.  It seemed like a waste of all the other ingredients.

Really tasteful and very flavorful.  My girlfriend loved it.  We served it with Carolina's Mashed Potatoes and drawn, sweet cream butter.

Skipped the jalapenos, not my favorite fruit!  Otherwise, it came out excellent, particularly for my first "live" lobster boil!

The onions, garlic, lemons, oranges, and celery, did not add to the flavor of the lobster. I did not add jalapeno peppers. The black pepper taste was overwhelming and did not seem an appropriate flavor for the delicate lobster. Not sure if the salt was appropriate either because lobster always tastes salty from the ocean water. To get all the above ingredients into the water took way too long. The lobster was ready in about 8 minutes (til it turns red). The lobster meat would have turned very tough if it had cooked any longer than that (judging from past experience). Would not recommend.

My mother-in-law won some lobsters last year, after many attempts she was able to get them shipped to us as they don't eat lobster.  I opened the box excited to find our 4 lobster TAILS for us to grill that night, only to find four LIVE lobsters, which I have never ever cooked.  This recipe saved dinner!  While I can't comment on how lobsters boiled in plain water would compare, ours were delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly (fused 3 jalepeno's) and followed one reviewers cooking times for small Maine lobsters or "chickens" as they are apparently called.  Lobsters had a great flavor without hiding the lobster taste, my husband and I loved them and so did our 3 and 6 year olds (yes, we should have sent them to bed and eaten all 4 ourselves, but they thought it was great fun).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm sure flavor was imparted into the Lobster with all the ingredients in the boil, but I really didn't notice anything special. I made a lemon butter sauce too for dipping which made a difference more than anything. Cook-time is according to the size of your lobsters as the recipe states.

Turned out to be a wonderful recipe. I halfed the recipe because I was cooking only one lobster. This was my first time preparing this type of dish. I must ad,it, this recipe turned out to be perfect. Also, I added a teaspoon of thyme find two bay leaves for additional flavor. Delicious!!!!!

Note: Before you cook your lobster make sure you have the appropriate cooking time for the weight of your lobster. Cook times vary.

I do not eat lobster but my husband loves them.  I have been cooking lobster from him and his buddy for over 3 years now and i only use this recipe except i leave out jalapeno pepper because i never seem to have them at my house. I get thumbs up every single time.  FIY my husband is a very picky eater. I have water boiling right now as I'm waiting for him to came back with lobsters.

Love this recipe. The lobsters turned out so full of flavor and was very tender. I excluded the salt and pepper and replaced it with Old Bay Seasoning instead. That added a perfect amount of spice to the citrus flavor.
