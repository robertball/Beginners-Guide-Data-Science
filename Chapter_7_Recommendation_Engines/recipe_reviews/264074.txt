Absolutely delicious! . If  you love mushrooms this is a great side or main dish.  I used shredded co-jack as that was what I had available. I think Swiss cheese would work well with this too. Thanks

This is such a delicious and oh so easy side dish.  I love mushrooms and this filled the bill for me. Only thing I did differently was to saute mushrooms and onions together.
Thank you nt_bella for sharing this!

I made this for a dinner party this evening.  Everyone loved it.  It was served as a side for 8 people, instead of the four the recipe states. I measured it,  7 cups of mushrooms is 1 pound package of sliced mushrooms.  As another review stated, I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in the same pan, to save a pan.
