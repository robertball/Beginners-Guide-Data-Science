I made them into freezer pops!  My grandkids love avocados and Iâ€™m hoping they will love these.  Very easy to make.

Really good. Agree with other reviewers that the mint is what makes it. Only issue was sticking in the popsicle mold, but I have no idea if that reflects on the recipe or my molds. Very, very good!

These are really, really good. It's the mint that takes them over the top. I will be making these all summer long.
