Very good!  Very simple!  I'll be keeping this one!  Here are my revisions, taken, in part, from other reviewers observations.  Start with a VERY light sprinkle of garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Evenly spread fresh basil, coarsely chopped.  I grated fresh Parmesan directly onto the salmon and then again on top of Roma tomato slices.  Another light sprinkle of salt and any leftover basil before a drizzle of olive oil.  I let the salmon sit for about 30 to 45 minutes to allow it to soak up the flavors before baking it for 15 mins., followed by about 2 to 4 mins. under the broiler.  I also think it should be served with a lemon wedge, it seemed to need a bit more citrus than what the tomatoes alone provide.  Served with couscous and a salad of mixed greens.

I used fresh basil leaves and layered them under the tomato slices. It made a pretty presentation and the family enjoyed it.

Very yummy and quick prep. I covered the entire salmon with sliced tomatoes but i found my favorite bites were the ones with the parmasean crusted directly on the fish - will do more of that next time.

Amazing Salmon! We tried using a broiling pan though, and cooked it at 375 as suggested for 10 minutes and then turned the broil element on high for another 5-10.  That gave us a crisp top and deliciously juicy salmon that literally melted in your mouth.

This was great. I was looking for an alternative to the usual soy-sauce-based marinades I use for salmon, and this was perfect. The tomato flavor really goes nicely through the fish. A deceptively simple recipe that turns out awesome.

Excellent! I followed the ingredients and directions as written. I used roma tomatoes, sweet basil and freshly grated parmesan reggiano cheese. The baking time is spot on! The layer of ingredients made for a very pretty dish. I am pleasantly surprised at how delicious this turned out. The salmon is so tender, moist and juicy! I love parmesan cheese and it melted nicely on top of the salmon. A nice combination of fresh flavors! Everything just melted in my mouth and I was in heaven! This is perfect for a late summer dinner - especially here in Hawaii! I served this dish with, "Fast and Easy Spinach with Shallots," "Herbed Rice Pilaf," and "Lemon Ginger Shrimp," all from this website and very tasty!

This was delicious! Perfect for a quick meal. I ended up using canned tomato rather than fresh, since it was what I had on hand, and the juices kept the salmon very moist. Great, quick recipe.

Perfect! So simple, so delicious. I used fresh basil, a shredded blend of Italian cheeses, and added a little fresh cracked black pepper and just a sprinkle of sea salt. So good; will make again and again. Thanks :)

Made with dried basil and with fresh basil.  Big difference with the fresh basil - much better.  Will make this a lot -- buy only with the fresh basil

I put sliced tomatoes both underneath and on top of the salmon fillets. I thought this dish was just okay -- a bit bland for me. My husband loved it, though. Granted, he loves salmon. Me, not so much. I baked 4 fillets, he ate 3, I ate 1, and he practically licked the baking pan clean.

YUM. Such a great salmon recipe. Definitely will be making this again. I followed other reviewers advice and did a layer of parmesan directly on the fish as well as on top of the tomatoes. Great flavor combinations!

I found the cook time on this to be much too long, but then again, it could just be my oven. The salmon came out a bit overcooked after just 13 minutes. I did bake it for 10 minutes and then turn the broiler on as recommended by other reviews, so I probably won't do that again. Other than that, the flavor was really fresh and light and a nice change from my go to glazed salmon!

Very Good! Made this for V-day & we loved it. I normally do not like Salmon, but this was very good. I made exact to directions & was surprised that the dried basil was tasty. The next time I will try with fresh basil!

My husband LOVED this salmon!  Took RandyRandy's suggestions. Baked for 15 minutes and then turned on the broiler.  Just before broiling for the last 4-5 minutes, my husband suggested that we top each fillet with a few slices of mozzarella.  Delicious!  And BEAUTIFUL presentation. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty.  I'll definitely be making this again, however, I'll add more seasonings to the actual fish fillets.  ("Marinating" the fish with the seasonings would help too, I ran out of time.)  I used the minced fresh garlic as suggested by others - really good.  Thanks for sharing - it's really good!

I wish I took a picture of it. I used a very large piece of Salmon for my husband and I and it came out of the oven looking SO pretty. WE both really loved it. The thin tomatoes made for very juicy salmon and the flavors all meshed together perfectly!

This was really delicious.  I did slightly change the recipe by taking olive oil & garlic and rubbing it into the salmon before seasoning with salt, pepper & basil.  Then topped them with the tomato and parmesan cheese, sprinkling a little more pepper, basil and olive oil on top before baking.

We loved it. The only thing that could be better was marinating the salmon before cooking it to give it more flavor. But the combination of basil and parmesan and tomato is awesome!

Loved this!  I ended up broiling the salmon and the cheese ended up being crusted on the tomato and fish.  Yummy.  This one is a keeper.

I absolutely adore this recipe!  So simple and so delicious.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and ad a layer of parmesan to help the tomato "stick" to the salmon.  I have also used canned petite diced tomatoes with garlic and spices in a pinch and it was just as good.

Delicious! Succulent, juicy, full of flavor! The crispy baked cheese on top definitely added just the right texture! (I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomato slices.)

Mmmm! My boyfriend doesn't even like tomatoes and he loved this. I left it out as RandyRandy suggested prior to baking and then broiling, and it was so juicy!

Simple and delicious...can't get any better than that! I chopped up some fresh basil from the garden for it. Served with a salad, this salmon made a light refreshing meal.

I also used fresh basil. It was a very pretty presentation but I didn't care much for the cooked tomato/salmon combo. Personal preference though.

This had good flavor and was SO quick and easy. Bonus points for quick clean up too. I think next time I'll use fresh basil and add some garlic salt to perk it up a little.

Very fresh and light. I did make some changes before making this recipe based on other reviews. I used fresh basil instead of dried basil, kosher salt and pepper, and I used a combination of parmesan cheese and mozzarella. I also baked it at 400 degrees for 18 minutes instead of 375 for 20. I served this with a Mediterranean salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, finely minced garlic, thinly sliced red onion and a dressing of hazelnut oil, 2 lemons, apple cider vinegar and salt and pepper. Diabetic friendly dish!

Flavorful and juicy! This was a great recipe that incorporated our planted basil. I didn't have any Parmesan on hand so I used a shredded Mexican cheese blend that still did the trick. I added some garlic and sprinkled salt and pepper on to the salmon before adding the other toppings. Paired with some asparagus, it was a wonderful weeknight dinner!

Simple.  Fast.  Tasty.  As I was shaking out the basil atop the fish, I said to myself, "Oh whee, Italian fish...". First bite: fabulous.  Simple, subtle flavors that really work with the salmon.

This is a very easy salmon recipe to make and definitely tastes good. I only wish the tomato tasted a little stronger, but maybe that was because of the quality of the tomatoes I used rather than the recipe?

So easy and fast, but pretty and tasty enough for a company meal.  I took the suggestion of another reader and drizzled EVOO, seasoning (basil, salt and a little dill) and cheese on both the fish then also on the tomatoes. The EVOO I used on the fish was basil infused, but I drizzled dill infused EVOO on the tomatoes.  I let these sit in the frig for about 30 minutes for the flavors to meld.  I also love my convection oven and the filets baked in 8 minutes at 400.  I was concerned that the tomato slices would leave the middle uncooked, but I needn't have worried.  These were so moist and flaky!  My husband loved these and said it would be a great way to prepare other fish, too.

So great and easy. Looks amazing as well. We encrusted the entire salmon with the parmesan before placing the tomatoes to give it a nice crust. 13/10 will cook again.

This was very tasty tonight and flavorful for something so simple. Unlike most reviewers, I grilled the salmon.  I only used about 1.5 teaspoons of EVOO and a pastry brush to lightly apply a thin coating of EVOO and basil to each side of the salmon.  After flipping on the grill, topped with thinly sliced brown tomatoes and the parm cheese.  Served with garlic mashed cauliflower (low carb, low fat) and green beans for a very light, refreshing meal.  We will definitely have again.

I really, really enjoyed this, it was quick and easy to make, and Tomato Basil is one of my favorite summer flavors.  I felt like there could have been more of a tomato flavor to it, more with each bite, but I haven't come up with the best way to get there.  Maybe dicing the tomato?

My salmon turned out super moist and good. I like that there are only 5 ingredients and it still tastes AMAZING. I love salmon.  :)

*Simple. *Excellent. Used fresh basil and skipped the olive oil. With just five ingredients, it's important to use the freshest, best quality ingredients... Superb. Served with a garden fresh salad and warm, freshly-baked biscuits, this salmon recipe turned a regular Monday night dinner into something special!

This recipe was so easy and the dish was awesome!  I followed the directions with one addition...after 20 minutes of cooking, I turned the broiler on for 2 minutes.  This recipe is one of my favorites.

Pretty tasty!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I had cherry tomatoes that i sliced thinly and layered on the top.  I did what a few others did and put in @ 375 for 10 ish minutes, then let it broil for the rest. I like the little crisp it gives the outside of the salmon. The inside was very moist and delicious.  I'd definitelymake again - easy and tasty.

very good!  We eat a lot of salmon at our house, and this was delicious.  I didn't have any basil, so I used a commercially prepared "citrus basil" seasoning.  I also forgot the olive oil, but didn't seem to miss it.  I will definitely make this one again!

Very delicious. I used very light Basel and added a little garlic & herb seasoning. I also slice the tomato up to make sure I have a piece with every bite :) !! I have made this multiple times now, husband loves it too! Super easy and quick.

The only change i made was to pan sear the salmon skin side down to crisp the skin, prepared as your recipe says and finished in the oven.  Very nice.

This was delicious and cooked perfectly as the recipe directed. The only thing I did differently is sprinkle a little sea salt on the salmon before I sprinkled with basil.

I love the combo of topping ingredients in general, but they didn’t taste as good with the salmon flavor. Cooking time is off, I was even working with smaller pieces (4 oz) and 20 min. was not enough, still very squishy. Ended up having to nuke in the microwave to finish cooking all the way through - the rest of the meal was ready and I didn’t have time to put it back in the oven.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I followed some of the suggestions but added a bit.  Sprinkled with salt and pepper then put a mix of fresh basil, fresh Italian parsley and garlic over the fish.  Then a light layer of parmesan cheese and thinly sliced roma tomatoes with a bit more cheese on top.  I also baked and then broiled at the end.  Fish was moist (even though I forgot to drizzle with olive oil) and so yummy.  Everyone loved it even the kids.

Love the flavor of the basil baked right on the salmon! Served with quinoa and sauteed spinach.

I was going to make cedar plank salmon but forgot the plank ... doh!  Had to come up with something to do in the oven quickly.  Although this recipe is fast and simple, it took me by surprise... it was delicious!!  Will definitely make it again.

Made it as written this time, with no alterations. You can’t really go wrong with something like this one. Simple, quick, delicious and good for ya too.  Might add a dash of salt and pepper next time, just to fortify the flavors a little.

Served it with this fettuccine as a side. The spicy elements in the fettuccine were a good counterpoint to the sweet basil and tomato.

I followed the advise of others and used fresh basil. Grated Parmesan and olive oil drizzle with salt and pepper. It was moist and delicious. I think that the fresh basil from my garden overpowered the taste of this dish. Next time I will use dried basil, other than that it was superb. The broil at the last minute did not crisp it up but finished the tomato Parmesan topping quite nicely.

This is such a perfectly delicious and simple salmon recipe. I have made it several times since finding this recipe. I use heirloom tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes because they're sweeter and tastier in my opinion. Yummy! For even more delicious flavor, add some fresh squeezed lemon juice on top before serving. I think it makes it perfect!

This recipe was a nice change for preparing salmon.  It is also convenient to make when tomatoes are in season and plentiful.  Some fresh basil is a nice addition, but the recipe is definitely worth making even if you have no fresh basil.  I also like the recipe because I usually have the ingredients on hand.

I like the mere fact that what I cooked looked exactly like the picture shown. This was a very tasty dish, quick and easy to put together with simple ingredients. I did add a few drops of lemon juice for added flavor.  
I must also add that I am not a fan of fish, but I liked this and would make again.

Prepared it exactly as written except for using fresh basil mixed with a bit of olive oil and it was delicious!  The basil and tomato added a touch of sweetness that was a great balance to the salmon.  So easy and so elegant.

I didn't make any changes because I like to try a recipe as written when I make it the first time. I loved it. The tomato kept the salmon moist and the parmy  added great flavor along with the basil. This summer I'll use basil from my garden. Hubby liked it too. Definitely will make this again.

I seasoned with lemon pepper and garlic powder first before topping with other ingredients and then put salt and pepper over all.  Kept in the refrigerator awhile before baking to season.  I couldn't get enough of the tomatoes/cheese so next time I may try with drained seasoned petite cut canned tomatoes and more cheese or parmesan /mozzarella mixed.  Baked for 15 minutes followed by 3 in the broiler.  Moist and delicious.

This was an excellent simple main dish. Following other reviewers' comments I made a few changes:  light salt and fresh ground black pepper on the salmon, next a sprinkling of shredded Parmesan & fresh basil, then the tomato slices topped with more basil and Parmesan & finally a light drizzle with olive oil. I also added more sliced tomatoes to the pan topping them with basil & cheese too. Finally, I baked the salmon for 13 mins. at 375 degrees, then another 4-5 mins. at a low broil. I served our salmon with saffron rice and fresh green beans. Both my husband and I cleaned our plates!

My husband and I love this recipe.   I have made it many times and it looks so elegant  on the plate.   This would be perfect for company. The first time I made this I used the dried basil, second time I made it  I used fresh  basil and now I only use fresh basil.    It also makes the dish pop,   I cut the basil in big pieces.   .    I wanted to try fresh basil because I had a lot of it.  Either way this is a fantastic recipe.    My husband grilled the salmon.   Used two sheets of foil  just enough to make a tray.   Spray with Pam.   Then put the foil  with salmon  on a cookie sheet or a tray to take it out to the grill and slide the foil off onto the grill.    Then followed the recipe.   Lid covered.

Quick and easy to make. Taste is good as well, but different. The parmesan cheese threw me off, but not in a bad way. It was good, but different from what we're used to, which is why we wanted to try it.  Served along with fresh broccoli (steamed) and some spaghetti squash (butter sage also from this site). By the way, I did really enjoy eating the salmon with the squash!

It was pretty good. I didn't use any salt or pepper on the salmon, so it was kind of bland.  I added after it was cooked. I also used one large piece of salmon, in stead of 2 smaller pieces. I think I also used too much dried basil, which overpowered the flavor. I might try to remake it, but with the proper proportions and ingredients.

Very tasty, and quick prep. I sautéed whole green beans with garlic and lemon to go with it.

Delicious! I made this with Steelhead Trout (my husband accidentally bought instead of salmon) and it was great. I didn't change anything except forgot to add the basil on top of the fish and instead added on top of the tomatoes. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

4 thumbs up (mine and my husband's)!  My husband asked if we should make a picture because the salmon looked so delicious and elegant.  The prep was so easy and the result was so good!

I only did a few things different. I rubbed 2 coves of crushed garlic,  fresh basil and squeezed fresh lemon juice over the fish before baking.  I was apprehensive on trying the receipe because I usually do a soy based receipe.  My granddaughter urged me to try it and I am so glad I decided to.  I loved it!  My husband loves the way I usually prepare salmon and he did really enjoy it too.

Thank you Clifford Randall Lyde for your suggestions.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoy dinner tonight.   I used fresh basil and Lawry's Garlic Salt instead of garlic and salt.  I roasted small Yukon Gold potatoes cut in half and seasoned with the same seasoning used on the salmon but started cooking them 30mins before putting the fish in the oven.  No question about it;  this one is a keeper.    Thank you Mr Lyde.

Yes it is very good, the changes I made were - with the sliced tomatoes I added fresh basil leaves, and instead of Parmesan cheese, I chopped up a strong cheddar into very small cubed and added to the tomatoes.  A bit of lemon juice and bit of sliced yellow onion on top of it as well.

Made the recipe to the letter of the recipe Monday night.  It is the perfect weeknight dinner.  The tomato really brought the flavor of the other ingredients out.  Will put this one on the "make again" list.

This was delicious!!  Very easy to make.  Only thing I did different was use fresh basil since I still have some in my garden.  Little S&P on salmon before putting on the basil..  I will make this again and again!!

It was perfection! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added bacon, olives, pepperoni... just kidding!??  
It bothers me when a recipe is rated but everything is changed on it! My son loved it  I sever it with home made rosemary and garlic pasta and artisan rolls.

This was really good! Couldn't find fresh basil at the grocery store, so I used basil paste (it tastes so good!), but that is the only change I made. I did slice my tomatoes a little thinner than I should have this time, but I will correct that next time. I will be making this again! I served this over rice with green beans. It was a hit and even though I just made this last night, I'm putting it on next week's menu as well! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

It was excellent but I tweaked the recipe a bit.   Instead of baking, I sauteed the salmon in a pan with a little of white wine on the stove top.   Once the salmon was done, I  topped it with some homegrown diced tomatoes, sauteed   fresh baby portobello mushrooms and onions and garlic, grated some fresh basil over all of it, grated some pepper and then sprinkled some fresh grated Parmesan cheese on it.   Then I covered the pan with a lid until the cheese melted.  All of the flavors blended together perfectly !  It is now a favorite of ours  and it is low in calories , sugars and carbs!

I would marinate it, for a bit next time. It would have been even better if the flavor went all the way through. I took olive oil, pesto basil mix, garlic press mix, parmigiano cheese mixed it all together pasted it on top, sprinkled mozzarella  cheese and sliced Roma tomatoes(all I had) on top and threw it in the oven. I had to cook mine for 30 minutes. It was amazing!

This is my new go to recipe for salmon. Easy and ingredients you have on hand. I used fresh basil and tomato from my garden. No marinades.  Delicious and healthy. Served it with a Greek salad. Perfect hot day dinner.

I've made this once before.  It was excellent!  We always grill our salmon.  I am making again it tonight....I know it will be great!  I sprinkled the salmon with lemon pepper after basting with olive oil first.  What can I say, I recommend giving it a try.

This salmon is not only super easy, but delicious also! The olive oil on top really made it all come together! You really don't need measurements on this one, most people who know their way around the kitchen could probably estimate.  I got a larger salmon filet so I need more tomato, cheese and basil.

this was okay. My husband and son liked it. My daughter and myself thought it was okay, I guess I just prefer the lemon flavor when it comes to my salmon.

I can not believe how easy this was to make. After reading some reviews I did use the Fresh Basil and 375 for 10-12 min then the Broiler for a few minutes. I cant wait to make this again!

Outstanding easy and delicious entree. Used fresh basil. Seasoned salmon with minced garlic, salt and pepper.  Put parmesean on top of salmon first and added more on top of tomatoes . Last 5 minutes I used the broiler and the drizzled olive oil keeps it very moist. This could be served at the finest restaurants. Definitely company worthy, but so easy for a family meal. Looks like you went to alot  of trouble . We know the truth!

This was great!  I doubled the recipe and used 3 cloves of garlic, minced, and 1/4 cup of fresh chopped basil (so much better than the dried).  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Because my husband is not a tomato fan, I sprinkled Parmesan on the salmon before and after adding the tomato.  20 minutes was a little long for the salmon.  17 minutes in the oven and then broiling the top for a minute would be perfect next time.  Make sure to sprinkle a little salt and pepper on the salmon beforehand.  The garlic adds a nice touch to this dish and I would highly recommend it!

Great recipe!!

What a tasty dinner! I changed a few things. This is what I did: On fish-Olive Oil; sprinkled dry dill, salt, pepper; fresh basil leaves; tomato slices(salted tops);fresh grated parmesan. Around fish-sliced red onion; chopped fresh garlic;olive oil. Baked 13 min. broiled 3 min til top was brown and red onions were almost black/crunchy. Served with orzo/spinch mixture. Lemon squeezed all over plate. HOLY COW! SO DELISH!
