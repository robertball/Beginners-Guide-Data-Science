This turned out to be the best beef stew ever, but I gave it only 4 stars because of the alterations I had to use. I feel that some of the steps listed are unnecessary and take extra time (like boiling the water with the soup mix). I followed the instructions with the following changes: I added 2 C. beef broth (in place of water) and only 1 packet of the onion soup mix straight to the crock pot. I also cut the onion into very small pieces and only added about 1 1/2 med. sized onions. I also added 3 tbs. fresh chopped parsley instead of dried, and 1 tbs. of celery flakes. I think that fresh celery would go well also. I did not use mushrooms, and added the wine straight to the crock pot. Also added just a pinch of allspice (I always use it in beef dishes and it's GREAT!) and 1 bay leaf that I removed when it was done cooking. This is hearty and amazing! Next time I'll try red potatoes. I made an extra batch, put in frozen tupperware, and gave as homemade frozen meals for Christmas!

I am the one that is known for making reservations, not dinner itself. A friend turned me onto this site and I look for the 5 star ratings to try something out. When I made this, my husband remarked "What did you do to this?" I didn't know how to respond so I just said nervously asked "Why?" He asked me what I laced it with because he had never tasted Stew so good in his life. He had 5 helpings that night, and took it to work every day that week. He never eats left overs EVER, so the fact he did the entire week was astounding. My husband is a very picky eater, and is afforded the luxury of eating in the finest eateries around town for lunch several times a week so it is HIGHEST praise coming from him.  I went back to find the recipe again (stupidly did not save it to my box and erroneously made another recipe. Even tho it was rated 5 stars as well, it was not even close in flavor to this one. Miraculously, I printed out this recipe and just found it again. Whew!! Off to make it again tonight. When browning the beef, don't use a NON stick pan. The crusty stuff on the bottom is SO good and adds a great flavor to the end product.

Whew!  This was a lot of work for a crockpot meal.  I followed recipe to a "T" although I used more flour to dredge and didn't need the cornstarch at the end as there was plenty of gravy.  After 1 hour on high and 6 hours on slow meat was still tough so it needs 8 hours.  Was good but needed more flavor so had to add spices at the end.

My girlfriend is one of the choosiest eaters in terms of quality of ingredients, taste, and health benefits.  I made this recipe and she says it's the best beef stew she's had in her life.  I'm inclined to agree it was incredible.  I followed the 1/2 size recipe fairly closely.  Just added some extra garlic salt after a couple hours in the slow cooker.

Absolutely delicious! I can see why this is "Kyle's Favorite" as this has definitely become a favorite in our house! I did however modify it a little to cut down on the number of steps. I added a little of garlic and onion powders along to the flour mixture and added the Worcestershire right to the crock pot. I also used whole baby carrots and whole baby red potatoes. I didn't bother with the boiling water, but rather added the onion soup mix right to the crock pot with beef broth.  I also quartered a large vidalia onion, used portabella mushrooms, and added all that with the garlic and burgundy wine right to the crock pot along with a couple of bay leaves and let go for 8 hours on low.  It smelled wonderful and thickened up nicely with the cornstarch mixture. It was wonderful with a side of french bread and a nice glass of wine!

I made a few alterations as we have a small family and I didn't need too much...I halved the recipe.  We didn't have mushrooms, so I used Cream of Mushroom soup and used Onion and Mushroom dry soup mix instead of recommended.  My kids loved it as did myself and my husband!  I will make this again for sure!

I really liked the stew. Very hearty! 
Two points to note:
1. I'd like to try it with more vegetables, like peas, for instance
2. Be sure to take out the onions when you are done cooking, I tried eating them and they didn't taste very good in large chunks like that

This was the most tastiest, thickest beef stew ever!!  Used a nice robust red wine. Cooked at 250 all day, the smell was divine... no leftovers.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I added the wine to the skillet to pick up drippings then added to the slow cooker.  I think I may add more garlic next time; I felt it was missing a little something.

Excellent beef stew! I wanted a simple recipe to throw in the slow cooker while I was at work, and come home to a delicious home-cooked, hearty meal, and this certainly fits the bill.  The night before I browned the stew meat & onions, and cut the veggies up, and made the onion soup mix, and then put them in the fridge all together. The next morning, before work, I just tossed it in the crock pot with a couple ounces of red wine, turned it on low and then went to work.  I cooked it on low for 9 hours instead of an hour on high first, only because I knew I wouldn't make it home an hour later to turn the heat down.  The results were amazing- the meat stayed in cubed form-rather than falling apart (I prefer it to stay cubed,) but was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and fork shreddable. The starch from the potatoes and the gelatin from slow cooking the meat caused the stew to be thick, and rich, without having to add any cornstarch.  Since I was leaving town the following evening, I brought the leftovers to work so they wouldn't spoil in the fridge, and my co-workers all raved about how good this stew was.  The only things I added were 2 bay leaves and about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. The rest I followed.  This recipe is certainly a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is a keeper. My boyfriend and I loved all the onions because we are onion freaks, and I did the recipe just as written except of course had to add additional seasoning, but that's what cooking is about. Everyone's taste is different. So I ended up adding a little bit more salt, and a little bit more garlic salt. You taste and add and wait awhile and do it again.  You would have thought my boyfriend died and went to heaven the way he went on. I of course, reduced the amount to 6, and we have lots of leftovers. When I told him I would need to give some away, he said NO WAY....just freeze it. Loved his reaction. It's always nice to be appreciated for making a good meal...so if you want to impress someone with a good stew, try this one.

The house smelled HEAVENLY while this was cooking. I did things a little differently -- one of my older friends (I'm in college) suggested I marinade the cubed beef stew meat before hand, so I mixed some of the wine with some onion soup mix and then put the meat in it to marinade over night. I also just made this with 2 pounds of meat because I didn't have a 5qt crockpot so I figured reducing to 7 servings would be good. Also, I couldn't find any of the appropriate wine, and my friend suggested caubernet sauvignon so I used some of that! I also added celery.  Upon eating it, I discovered that the recipe was a little bit too sweet for me, which might have been the caubernet -- I'm not certain -- but other than that this was delicious. Next time I'll try it with the real wine and try to figure out how to not make it so sweet!

i halved the recipe and it made plenty! (the full recipe would be a tight squeeze in my crockpot.) i did do 2 c of beef broth (instead of water) and 1 packet of onion soup mix. and still did 1/2 c of wine. delicious! i cooked it high heat for 2 hours and low heat for 6 hours. everything was soft and well cooked. i made the potato chunks slightly bigger than i chunk for mashed potatoes... so maybe 1.5" cubed.

Absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe, didn't have wine opened so I just used beef broth, otherwise follwed recipe exactly.  About an hour later I decided to open a bottle of red and poured a couple of splotches in there.  Hubby and I just loved it.  Thank you!

OMG!  I've had some stews in my time and they've been so-so.  This one is oh my gosh good!!  I made one change because I didn't have fresh mushrooms. I added a packet of mushroom gravy with hot water. It was so awesome. I used a round steak cut up and it made a full-size crackpot full. So don't double unless you have a big group!!  Thanks for sharing this!  It's a keeper!!

I made this two weeks ago and it is awesome! If you would rather not use the burgundy wine, I looked up substitutions and you can use red wine vinegar instead, which is what I did. Also, it does indeed make a lot, so you want to make sure your crock pot can hold every bit of 5 quarts. Mine is a 5.5 quart which allowed me plenty of room. I followed the recipe as is, except I used 2 onions instead of three, and I used sliced fresh mushrooms instead of the button ones. Gooood Stuff!!!

While this recipe required what seemed to be quite a few steps for making a stew, they were well worth it!!  The only thing I did differently was to omit the onion soup mix.  I did this because I find that those packets tend to be very salty.  I followed all the directions to a "T" except that one and simply substituted it with half beef stock and half beef boullion/broth.  I also added about 1/4 cup of Cabernet Sauvignon to the slow cooker after the 1 hour on high as I love the extra flavor that the wine imparts on this dish.  Thank you for sharing this recipe as it was simply devine!  Highest praises coming from a self-proclaimed "food-snob".  I will make this over and over again!!

I can't believe I'm just now rating this recipe.  I've been making this for over a year now and it's my go-to recipe for beef stew.  Only change I make is add about 1/2 cup red wine as it's cooking.  AMAZING!  I would rate this 10 stars if I could.

We found that the recipe didnot have enough liquid. We added around 3 cups of Beef Broth. We also scaled down the recipe from 10 servings to 7 to account for the amount of meat we purchased. We also added celery and fresh green beans. This was a great base recipe that with a little tweaking will become a keeper!!!! Thanks Kyle

I've made this recipe twice; first as a trial to get familiar with it and then for a dinner party of 18 people where I wanted to enjoy our guests and not be a slave to the kitchen - both times came out great.  The second time I added a cup or so of frozen peas before serving because I liked the color in the stew.  This is one of those recipes that's not too fancy but just tastes great - a keeper for your recipe box.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly (bad at following directions!), used more or less of some ingredients and added celery, but it turned out delicious! Favorite stew so far :)

Best beef stew ever!!! I hardly ever finish my dinner (especially dinner I have prepared) and I devoured this! I was skeptical about the mushrooms but they really were fabulous. I didn't have button mushrooms but the slices ones and they were just fine. Thanks for the recipe! (Couple little changes I just added a little seasoning salt because we like more salt in our family). Thanks again!

I thought this was pretty good.  Would have been better if I had had enough meat. I only had 1/2 of what it called for.  Also, substituted herb & garlic soup mix for the onion.  Would have been better if I had stuck to the recipe.  On a good note, the leftovers were TASTY!  Better a day or two later! :)

wow-this was far too much work for beef stew! and yes i have been cooking from scratch for years. i am going to dig and find my beef stew "guide" and put it on here. this one is going to have to come out tasting just extraordinary, for me to ever do this again. way too much work for a simple dish.

This recipe started as a disaster, but turned out fantastic! My fault, i made the rookie mistake of not reading the recipe before diving in. I did not realize all the steps involved so did not prep everything beforehand like i should have. I also left the strap that prevents the top from rattling under the pot itself, where it melted and filled the house with the aroma of melted plastic. Then after browning the meat there was a solid layer of beef/flour tastiness that i was pretty sure would never come off the bottom of my fav stainless steel pan. However once i deglazed the pan with wine for the mushrooms it was presto! clean. Once i got everything in the crockpot my stress level decreased and soon the house smelled great, like beef not plastic. The only changes i made was to add 2 large unseeded jalapenos, diced, to the onions and garlic, and beef broth instead of water with the soup mix, although i did boil it over so it was not quite 2 cups. Also used baby portabella. Cooked for hr on high then 6 on low, put it in the fridge overnight since it finished at about 9:30 at night. So yummy the next day for lunch! Not my most stellar day in the kitchen, but it all turned out great and is some of the best beef stew i've ever had! Definitely a keeper, and next time i won't be such a mess!

I have been looking for a stew recipe that my family will love for a couple of years now.  This one comes the closest to it!  My 14 year old son doesn't particularly care for stew but he said this one was pretty good.  Thanks for sharing!

The taste was really great. My 4 yr old and her 2 yr old friend gobbled it up. I gave it four stars because my meat became so tender that it fell apart and there  weren't many chunks left, but rather shredded beef throughout. It looked like mush. Maybe this was my fault and I cooked it too long. I followed the instructions, though. If anyone has suggestions, though, I would love to make it again.

Very good slow cooker recipe!  Next time, tho, I will omit the salt as mine was a tad too salty.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change anything.

I don't often review things, but this was soooo good I couldn't resist.  It was a bit more involved than I would normally expect of a slow cooker recipe but DEFINITELY worth it.  A few things I did differently out of necessity:  I didn't have red wine so I used that amount of water with a heavy splash of red wine vinegar; I used a bit less meat because that's all I had; I added a can of peas, at the end because, well, I like peas in my stew.  Soooo good!  I was worried that there wasn't going to be enough liquid, but by the end of the cooking time there definitely was, though this is a very hearty stew.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

Great Recipe! I've been making and perfecting this for two years now. Everyone loves it! The extra work is worth it! The button mushrooms sauteed in red wine give this hearty stew an amazing flavor. Make certain you have a large crock pot.   

I followed the advice of a few other cooks and made the following "changes." 
1. I use beef broth instead of water. I dedicate two cups of the broth for the onion soup mix, and then simply pour another cup into the stew in order to make more soup
2. I added two stalks of celery, finely chopped, for more flavor
3. I added one bay leaf for more flavor (removed after cooking.)
4. I added a can of peas for more flavor and texture
5. I added a pinch of allspice for more flavor

Enjoy! If you follow the reciipe as is, the stew is a tad bland. Make the above additions (especially the beef broth to replace the water!) and you will NOT be disappointed!  I've made this recipe a dozen times or so.

The thickness of this stew is great.  However, as written, the recipe is very bland.  There is also a lack of vegetables but they can easily be added if that is your taste.  I'm glad that I had beef stew mix on hand and a great deal of seasonings :/.  This recipe is just ok.

This was a wonderful strew.  My husband loved it and that is saying alot... he's very picky.  The only thing I will change next time is to chop up the onions a bit finer and to add less pepper.  It was quite peppery.

This stew was hearty, but bland. I had to add a lot of salt to each helping. Nice consistency but needed to be tweaked with more herbs and spices.

This should be called "CARROT Stew with beef."  I am disappointed!  I will try this again, but I will NOT put ANY carrots in at the beginning. I will just add a bag of mixed vegies an hour before it's done.  That way it's BEEF STEW with some vegies in it.  The potatoes & onions seem fine.  Just the carrots came out really  overpowering. Maybe it's because I cut it into little pieces?  I don't know, but it doesn't taste anything like BEEF stew, just carrot stew.

I apologize as I didn't make the recipe exactly since I made this spur of the moment.  I made with all the ingredients except wine and mushrooms, which I think would make this even better.  Also, I didn't have time for crock pot cooking so I just made it on the stove.  I did brown the meat as stated and removed from pot and then sauteed the onions and garlic in butter.  Then I added the browned meat and the rest of the ingredients back into the pot to cook for about 4 hours.  I have to say this was truly delicious. Everyone at my house (1 hubby, 2 sons, 1 friend) loved it.  I can't wait to try with the wine and mushrooms.

This recipe was good, but will probably not make it again.  I could really taste the wine in this dish and my kids didn't like it.  I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms which I didn't have and my family doesn't like anyway.

I absolutely love this recipe! I used a dutch oven instead of a skillet and I added a bit more wine to deglaze the pan.  I also use radishes instead of mushrooms which soak up the wine just as well. Yum!

A lot of work for a slow cooker recipe, but I'm sure that's what makes it so delicious!  You need a really large slow cooker, FYI. I think mine is average size but I couldn't fit all the onions or any mushrooms!

Good but a bit too salty for our taste.  I will eliminate the last step to thicken next time.  It made it a bit too thick and didn't look very appetizing

The whole gang loved it!  I was afraid it might be too much garlic, but it wasn't.  AND if forgot to cut the crockpot down after the first hour, so 6 hours later, I had to add beef broth to soup it up some more.  Worked like a charm..  All my kids and hubby said "it's a keeper recipe".  (that's the question I always ask when I am trying new recipes)

Excellent stew! I added powdered gravy mix to about a cup of the juices, which made the broth thicker and added a little more beef flavour. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is now my favorite beef stew as well!  Well worth the extra effort!  I left out the potatoes and didn't bother thickening it up at the end because I added dumplings during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Kept all the other steps and ingredients the same. Everyone raved about this stew!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this as written except used Lipton Beef and Onion soup instead of just onion.  Thickened up perfect and I thought the meat to veggie ratio was perfect.  My hubby doesn't care for stew much but will eat anything with lots of meat in it.  Ha!  Next time I make this I will probably add some thyme & basi just to give it a little more flavor.

This is absolutely delicious!   I left out the onions and mushrooms, due to my family's taste.  They all loved this and the entire crock was gone when dinner was over!

I just made this Thursday. Didn’t have mushrooms, so skipped adding those. We love potatoes so I added extra. Also used beef broth and the wine, it was incredible. Will definitely make again with some bread bowls for a hearty winters night meal.

This is the best beef stew ever!  I followed the modifications from another review and it turned out even better!  I gave it a four because I don't waste time with the meat in the skillet.  I just throw all the ingredients into the crockpot, substitute vegetable stock for the water and add more veggies.  It turns out great!

Love Love Love this recipe!!!!!!!! Awesome and the whole family loves it! I simplify it a little! I am an organic cook so I use all organic products. I just brown the meat with a little olive oil and flour with the Worcestershire, salt, pepper, onion and garlic. I put this in the Crock Pot. I use Simply Organic french onion dip mix instead of onion soup mix (closest thing I can find!) and mix it with warm water and stir it in the skillet to get all the drippings mixed in. The 3rd step is not needed and the butter just adds unneeded calories!  I put all the other ingredients in the crock pot and cook on High for an hour and low for 6 hours. I have not used mushrooms yet but I'm sure they would be good. We like sweet potatoes too so I use one sweet potatoe and red potatoes! You can use the cornstarch at the end, but it is not necessary!  Best stew ever!

This is a very good beef stew recipe,  just short of great.  I used one onion instead of three, only one package of onion soup mix, beef broth instead of water, and didn't simmer the mushroons in the wine (just poured the wine in on top of everything).  Makes a lot, and ages well.  Also, since I was on the way out the door to work, I didn't put the temp. on high for an hour and then lower it, just let it cook on low all day.

Great recipe! Made twice and both successful. Added beef broth to onion mixture as suggested. Cut the amount of beef in half and doubled the amount of carrots/potatoes and added celery and peas. This is a favorite and family loves it.

I haven't made beef stew before, but I can't imagine why I'd use any other recipe - this was absolutely delicious.  I did the prep the night before I cooked it: I browned the beef and put it in a separate container, then cooked the onions & garlic in the butter and added the wine to that (I didn't use mushrooms), and added the mixture to the beef container.  I made the onion soup mixture and placed it in a separate container, and I put the potatoes and carrots in the crockpot - I put all of this in the fridge overnight.  I cooked it all on low for about 8 hours.

I make a lot stew over the course of fall and winter. This was the BEST stew I've made or ever tasted! Very thick and flavorful. This was a lot more work than most crock pot meals but well worth the extra time (about an hour if you follow all the steps.) My youngest hates onions so I omitted the fresh onion and the cornstarch-it was plenty thick without.

This was so very good.  Even my husband loved it. I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I didn't have red wine so I substituted 1 can Budweiser with Clamato juice.  The heartiness and flavor of this stew was worth the exta work. thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

I do not make a good beef stew.  Attempted this recipe because it is simple.  Voila...success!  What I did differently; put onion, garlic and parsley in food processor and minced before sauteing and adding to crock pot.  Also used beef broth instead of water.  Cooked on high for one hour, then low for five hours.  Refrigerated overnight, took out (no fat to remove!) and continued to cook an additional four hours on low. Added cornstarch/water and cooked and addtional half hour uncovered.  Really good!

This was really good! I made it exactly as described, but added a bit of sage and a generous amount of pepper. I also added flour at the end rather than cornstarch. I cooked it on high for 1 hour, then 3 hours on medium and it was more than cooked.   The flavor is really fabulous. I normally 'throw everything' in the slow cooker, but this has changed my mind about searing the meat beforehand. This made a big difference. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

My family LOVED this stew and I've already shared it with a friend! I wanted it to be really "saucy" so my modifications: doubled the amount of wine and added 2 cups of beef broth; only added one onion. I didn't need to add the additional flour/water in the end. Even with the extra liquid the stew was nice and thick. DELICIOUS!

I made this the other day in the crock pot.  Hands down the best beef stew I have ever made.  My husband asked me if I really made it or bought it!!  I did it exactly the way it is written. I will make this again and again.  Perfect for those cold winter nights....

My family REALLY liked this recipe.  I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have any and I didn't thicken at the end, looked good the way it was.  I don't have a slow cooker so used dutch oven and put at 350 for first hour and 255 for 6 hours.  Meat came out nice and tender. Excellent!

This is absolutely the best beef stew I have ever had!  I only made one alteration, I used a rosemary blend in place of the parsley!  I also made it the day before and then reheated.  This was a big hit with all my guests.  I will definately make this again and again!

Delicious! 
Only made enough for (supposedly) 4 people, but it ended up being enough for 3. I did add a little more mushrooms and carrots and added selery. Also chopped up the onion into smaller pieces. Turned out very well, very good with some french bread.

I made a few changes - but probably would have given 5 stars even if I hadn't!! I used Beef Broth - pinch of Allspice - 1 Bay Leaf and instead of wine I use a good Red Wine Vinegar. I made double the recipe using two crock pots and gave it to my neighbor and daughter and kept some for me and my hubby. Everyone Loved it!!!

I left the mushrooms out and doubled the amount of wine.  :). Hubby loved it.

Next time I'd only use one package of onion soup mix.

I usually try to make a recipe exactly as stated, then with my own tweaks before making a review, but for this recipe it wasn't the case. I had all the ingredients on hand except for the wine and mushrooms (with the addition of celery that needed to be used), so I thought this was the base recipe for me. It turned out very bland. I ended up going to the store for the McCormick beef stew spice blend, while also adding some tomato paste, soy sauce and seasoning salt towards the end. I give this two stars for the cooking method, but the flavoring wasn't right for us personally.

Neither my hubs or I cared for this at all (sorry!). Admittedly, I was quite surprised that this tasted NOTHING like IAMROSIE's slow cooker beef stew (which I LOVE!!!). Other than the addition of W sauce, garlic and mushrooms, a few subtle measurement differences and a slightly varied cook time, the two recipes are pretty much identical. IAMROSIE's stew is anything BUT bland, but this one left much to be desired. Another issue I couldn't get past was a textural one. Cooking on high the first hour and then on low for another 8 hours practically nuked my stew. :( My meat literally shredded (I prefer chunks of meat in my stew) and my veggies were REALLY soft. I think an hour on high and 6 hours on low would have been MORE than sufficient - and I'm regretting that I didn't error on the shorter end of the suggested cooking timeframe. NOTE #1: Unless you like LARGE chunks of onion in your stew, roughly chop them. Keep in mind that you'll likely want to cut back by HALF if you do so (unless you want to taste onion in EVERY bite!). One final observation.... I halved this recipe and nearly filled my 5 qt. slow cooker (ikes!). Unless you have a crowd to feed, a SUPER large slow cooker or want days worth of leftovers, a half batch is PLENTY sufficient! Serving our stew in Panera sourdough bread bowls was the highlight of our meal. This may be a winner for your family, but it wasn't for ours. Thanks anyways, Heather. :-)

I used a mixture of veneson and beef stew meat.  I also added fresh thyme, rosemary, and sage.  I used about 1/2 bottle of red wine.  Instead of quarted onions, I used pearl onions instead.  Also per other reviews that I read, I did not add the cornstarch at the end.  Everything else I kept the same.  All of my family really enjoyed this dinner except my five year old, but he doesn't like much.  I am now using the left over meat and broth to boil eggnoodles.  I tossed the left over potatoes and onions in fresh basil and dill with olive oil, parmesan cheese and sea salt...then into a hot oven and the carrots are cooked in a brown sugar/honey/butter reduction.  Two great meals!!!

Great recipe! I made a few changes because I didn't have the ingredients. I used beef broth to replace the wine, and I didn't bother boiling the water as some other reviewers mentioned suggested. I chopped one onions instead of quartering threes because I like my onions. I used soy sauce in place of Worchestire sauce since I didn't have any one hand. The stew turned out flavorful and rich; mushrooms are a wonderful addition. The fiance loved it. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent! I have never made beef stew before and it turned out so good. My daughter said "amazing"!! I added celery and two cans of beef broth, used only one pack of Lipton and no mushrooms. It really was great! I used burgundy 'cooking' wine.

This is some really good beef stew!!  I like how everything is sauteed a little before being put in the slow cooker.  It really brings the flavor out.  My whole family ate this all up with no complaints!!

Awesome recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  I've made this several times and it never fails to taste wonderful and meat always comes out so tender, it melts in your mouth.  I followed other reviewers and cut the meat down to 2lbs meat, 1 pk onion soup mix.  marinated the meat in beef broth and onion soup mix overnight THEN put meat in flour mix (flour, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, pepper and salt).  and browned on all sides.  The meat always comes out very tender.  I like to freeze leftovers in smaller portions for impromptu meals!??

I use beef broth instead of onion soup mix and it is scrumptious! I prefer shiitake mushrooms though as I like their more earthy taste.

I don't always follow a recipe word for word but I did this one and it was very bland and not great by any stretch.  The meat was very tender and that is sometimes "tough" to do with stew meat but otherwise it wasn't a meal I could be proud of. Just okay.

Best stew I ever had! In my boyfriend's words: "You can serve this to people". He even had seconds and does not really like stew. I did add a large can of diced tomatoes and subbed yams and celery for the potatoes and the mushrooms (personal preference).

Followed recipe exact but did not add mushrooms.The stew was good before adding the water/corn starch in the end. Made it WAY to thick, my husband and son wouldnt even eat it. I added more water and that helped but i dont think we will be making this again.

I'm only giving it 4* because I did alter it a bit, so I didn't want to deceive other cooks.  That's why I love this site so much - it gives me a running start on a recipe and then I can make it my "own" !
We all have different tastes and ways of cooking so these recipes can help inspire us and come up with a dish that is pleasing.  
I added a bit of celery  browned after the beef and eliminated the potatoes because I made mashed to serve the stew over.  I didn't seem to have to thicken the stew so didn't use the cornstarch either.
The results (for us) - a DEEELICIOUS meal.  I had a person visiting who doesn't like tomatoes so I looked for a recipe that didn't have tomatoes included. 
I LOVE THIS SITE - thanks for so many inspiring recipes !

This recipe was nice and easy and tasted delicious. I made the recipe exactly as instructed with one small change: instead of water I mixed beef broth with the onion soup packets. My family enjoyed it too. I would definitely make it again.

Okay, this isn't even out of the oven yet but I have tasted it and it is divine! Having never made beef stew I was not anticipating great sucess the first time around but this recipe is the bomb!  I followed it exactly except that the store was out of onion soup mix (?) so I substituted a packet of  McCormick Beef Stew seasoning. Everything else I followed. I could not get this all into the crock pot so I had to transfer to my roasting pan and I cooked it all day at 230 degrees. Let me tell you , the house smells sooo good! I personally liked the flavor better before adding the wine, but it still is very, very good. I also find it to be a bit peppery but again, that's just personal taste and it does not detract overall from the stew's flavor. I think I am going to add some peas as well. I can tell already that I will make this time and again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful 'comfort' food recipe. Now, time to pop the french bread into the oven.....

I'm not sure why some people thought this was bland.  Everyone in my family, which includes 6 kids, loved it.  I made very few changes to the recipe.  Maybe more quality ingredients or type of onion, soup mix, wocestershire sauce, etc makes a difference?  Only thing I would change next time is more carrots.  The changes I made this time were slight and just a personal preference.  I added a bay leaf in with boiling water and soup mix and then left it in the crock pot while it cooked.  I used mini bella mushrooms because my store didn't have button mushrooms.  Lastly, I used a sweet, soft red wine because that's what I keep on hand to drink.  Delicious and will make again for sure!  Would be great over mashed potatoes as well.

Excellent dish!!!  The smells in my kitchen right now are amazing.  I didn't have any wine at home (and didn't want to run to the store), so I used beef broth instead...it is very good, but I can't wait until next time to try with the wine.

I agree with the others that this required a lot of prep.  But it was REALLY good!   I think next time I will try it with only one Onion Soup "Envelope"  which by the way is made by Lipton....I had trouble finding it in the grocery store until I came home and googled it.

I hate reviewing recipes I have altered, but I must say we enjoyed this one.  I made the stew on the stove without potatoes, simmered for about an hour.           I then made mashed potatoes and covered the stew in a pie dish and made a version of shepherds pie. Baked at 400 for 25 min to get a nice crust, very good.

Very good.  Followed recipe exactly except I halved it, omitted the mushrooms and added squash.

My family loved this stew! I used another reviewer's suggestion to save time. I combined beef bullion and one packet onion soup mix with two cups water and added that to the crock pot. Then I added a bit of steak seasoning to the flour to season the beef. Very yummy! Thanks for the recipe!!

A great stew recipe.  Both my husband and I loved this!  The only modifications I made was I didn't add the mushrooms (we don't care for them) and substitued celery instead.  We will definitely be adding this to our rotation during the winter months!

Delicious and intense flavors.  I ended up needing another 1-1/2 cups of water.

I wanted to try a beef stew that was a little more kicked up than my mom's recipe which I've always made. This definitely fit the bill. It smelled amazing while cooking and didn't disappoint. Although I was only cooking for two I made the full portion and I'm glad I did, my boyfriend ate 3 bowls and happily took the leftovers home. Only changes I made, as suggested by another reviewer was using beef broth instead of water with the soup mix, and I didn't boil the soup just put it right in the slow cooker. Also only used 1 onion rather than 3, I thought the soup mix would provide plenty of onion flavor. I didn't have burgundy wine so I used some pinot noir that was open. I suggest letting it cool a bit before eating, the flavors really came together once it wasn't piping hot anymore. I cooked on high for one hour as suggested, then put it on the 6 hr setting and let it finish. If I make again when I'm not going to be home to adjust the settings I think cooking straight through on the 8 hr setting would work just as well. I also used frozen peas instead of mushrooms, just added them during the last hour of cooking.

I love the seasoning in this recipe- I used the olive oil, garlic, wostershire sauce, but I didn't add the parsley, onion soup mix, butter or burgundy wine- as I was trying to make it a little less fancy for the kids... think maybe I'll try all the seasonings next time...

This beef stew rivals Mom's.  I could never recreate hers; I have found my beef stew recipe.
My husband and I don't like mushrooms, so I left them out, but did add the wine to the pan to get up the onion drippings and heat it up just a little before adding it to the crockpot.  (I just used the red wine I had on hand and it gave it a great flavor!)  Next time I might add some peppers or green beans since hubby likes them, but this recipes is great as is.
Thanks so much for posting!  This one's going into the real recipe box!

A lot of work for a crock pot recipe, but it's worth it!  I don't add the mushrooms, so I just pour the wine right into the pot for step 4 and it still tastes great.

Excellent stew!  Hubs raved about the flavor!  I didn't have any red wine on hand, but used red wine vinegar instead, gave it a tangier flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this recipe. Did not have all the ingredients but still turned out great. Made a much smaller batch. Did not have wine or mushrooms but used the Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion & Mushroom mix instead with vegetable broth instead of water. I cut my potatoes really large so they did not fall apart when the stew was ready. I think this is a good guide line for a yummy stew, have fun with it!

I have tried various beef stew recipes for years and never found one that was very good.  My husband and boys gobble this up!  It takes a while to prep, but it is worth it.  Be sure to use a large crock-pot, as it makes quite a bit!

This is the best beef stew I have ever eaten, let alone made. I am by no means an experienced cook, but I followed this recipe almost exactly and it turned out amazing. The modifications that I made based on other comments were to use beef broth instead of water, added celery, and added onion soup directly to the slow cooker. Unless you hate mushrooms, I would highly recommend not leaving them out because they really add to the awesomeness of this dish.

Wow! This is ridiculously good! I only had 2.5 lbs beef, but I thought it was plenty. I roughly chopped the onions instead of quartering them and added a couple of bay leaves to the crockpot. Seems like a lot of work, but it is definately worth it. This is such a comforting meal and full of flavor. If you don't like a lot of spice, you may want to cut down on the pepper just a bit.

You know, I'm not sure who this Kyle person is.....BUT HIS BEEF STEW ROCKS!    I decided I would give this a shot in my Cast Iron Dutch oven to be baked low and slow.  The meat was tender, it had so much flavor and I didnt even have any wine on hand, so i utilized Beef stock to replace it.  That was the only thing I did differently and it was soooo good.  My husband even said it was the best one I have ever made.  Thanks Kyle!

With my alterations, it would make a 5/5 stars.  I used 4 MEDIUM potatoes, 3 large carrots, did NOT cook the onion soup mix in water, added Spice All, 14oz can of beef broth, a bay leaf and 2 sticks of celery.  It was the best we've (my family and I) ever had.

Phenomenal! I halved the recipe since it was just for me and my husband and added a cup of thawed peas after it was all cooked. I was a little generous with the garlic and wine, and used a 14.5oz can of beef broth in place of the water called for (didn't boil it). The flour in the beginning thickened things up enough that I did not need to add cornstarch. Also, I chopped the onion finely as I wanted it to blend into the stew. I was a little skeptical about leaving the meat on the bottom and not stirring it before turning on the crockpot, but by following the recipe, it came out completely tender. This was great and I will absolutely be making this stew again.

I thought this was excellent, particularly considering I generally am not at all into beef stew!  Very different than the usual.  I cut it in half as it would never have fit in my slow cooker.  Thanks for sharing!

Altho I don't eat beef, I always do taste and I must say I totally agree with all of the rave reviews. This was by far the best beef stew recipe I've ever used. The only addition I made was to use a can of tomato paste which eliminated the need to thicken with the cornstarch. Hearty, comforting and so delicious. Thank you Heather!!

Great recipe--got rave reviews from the family (even the kids ate it). Made a few noteworthy changes. First, we are vegetarians, so (gasp!) I subbed meatless beef strips for the real stuff, which worked surprisingly well. I used veggie broth instead of water. I didn't have time to cook in the slow cooker, so used the stove top. Stew was perfectly thick without adding additional water + cornstarch at the end. Totally delish and the house smelled amazing!

Stop the press!!!!!!!  I agonized over which beef stew recipe to choose because I can't stand nasty beef stew.  If you are looking for a great recipe than this is for you.  This was a wonderful stew and I'm sure you will be pleased-don't hesitate to make this!  I did some additions/deletions based on others feedback but basically followed the recipe.

On taste I give this 5 stars. On prep I give 4 stars. A lot of chopping and prep work, but the end taste was well worth it. I don't think this was lacking in flavor at all. I only used 1 pkg of onion soup mix and added 2 cubes of beef bouillon. I also didn't have any wine, so I left it out altogether and added the mushrooms in with the onions (chopped smaller than recommended) to saute a little (scraping up all the pieces on the bottom of the pan as one person recommended). The beef just fell apart it was so tender. It was the best beef stew I've made or tasted.

Wonderful beef stew! I gave it 5 stars, but I added some Yucatan Sunshine hot sauce for a bit of extra spice.  We had guest for dinner, and everyone loved it.  This has become my new favorite beef stew recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I have never written a review before, but I was compelled to write this one. I did not use the wine (used Better Than Bouillon beef broth instead) and left the mushrooms out. The only thing I will change next time is to add a little less pepper, it was a bit spicy for me. 

Also, I had to add a little more water to bring the liquid volume up to a stew quality.  

We will definitely be eating this again!!

You will need a HUGE crockpot for this recipe.  I had to change to my dutch oven on the stove to finish.  I also used broth instead of onion soup mix (no msg for us).  Other than the comments above this recipe is a five star!!!

Great recipe.  Modifications: used only 1 onion, added celery for more vegetables.  Substituted beef stock for water to add more flavour.  Also used more flour to achieve the thicker consistency.  Added extra beef stock for more liquid in the stew.

Best tasting stew I've ever made. My daughter - who can't stand beef stew. Thought it was great. I did not use wine, but beef broth instead and added 2 more tablespoons of Worcester sauce than suggested. Highly suggest!

Very good.  This stew has a lot of flavor and stew meat was so tender.  I substituted the water with beef broth.  I try not to add water to my recipes.  Will be making this one again.

Awesome recipe! Substituted a few things: used 1 onion soup mix & 1 vegetable soup mix, baby potatoes and added fresh green peppers.  I love mushrooms but I didn't have any on hand.  
Recipe was D-LISH!
Great Sunday dinner went well with a side of Basmati rice, even the picky kids had a 2nd serving.

I made this recipe the other day and it is really good.  I didn't have any mushrooms or wine but it still came out great without them.  It would probably have been even better if I had used at least the wine.  Next time I make this, I will make it with the mushrooms and wine...and I will make it again.  My husband loved it too.

Missed a few steps as I don't believe they are necessary with a slow cooker. Browned meat well in the skillet with oil for additional flavor and added worcestershire sauce to directly to crockpot, also though I cooked the onion with garlic in the skillet, I added the mushrooms and wine directly to slow cooker. I also added a diced turnip to the mix just because I like them in stews. I used only 1 package of soup mix with a cup of water and 1 can of beef broth to constitute the liquid. Turned out excellent.

5 stars for deliciousness, this is one of the best beef stews I have ever made. Minus 1 invisible star because this recipe does not take 30 minutes. If you notice, most of the ingredients listed are already pre-prepped. 

To actually make this recipe (including all the chopping and cooking), it takes me about 2 hours. No joke. Worth it, but be ready to set aside a fair amount of time for all this.

This was quite good.  For my small family, I made 1/2 of the recipe and served it over rice, which fed us generously with leftovers. I didn't have the right kind of wine, so I deglazed the pan I browned the beef in with dry sherry and added that to the crock pot, and used beef broth in place of some of the water.  Next time, I'll add frozen peas at the end of the cooking time to add a little green.

3 stars as this was good, but not great.  I followed the prep directions pretty closely except I used the beef-onion flavor dry soup mix instead of the regular dry onion soup mix. I also added 1/3 cup tomato paste at the end as it was and a bit 'stodgy' and needed some acid to balance and brighten the flavors. I stirred in some frozen peas at the end for color.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that there are some unnecessary steps you can eliminate, such as adding the soup mix to boiling water first. I might even skip sauteing the onions and mushrooms and just put them straight into the pot.

Note: this took only 4 hours to fully cook after setting the crock pot to low. Once finished there was a lot of liquid. I would add less water next time and only add more as needed. I would also stir in some fresh parsley at the end of cooking to freshen up the flavor.

I will cut back by 1/2 of the onion soup mix. Omit the mushrooms & wine, replace wine with beef broth. Add celery & use whole baby potatoes & whole baby carrots, only use 1/2 c onion chopped in cm pieces. I will make this again, with my changes & might try with non alcoholic wine sometime but not mushrooms, Ive never had stew with mushrooms & dont plan to start. I just changed this up a bit to what my vision of the perfect beef stew is. soo good.

Overall as is this is a great recipe.  I like that I'm able to change things up a bit with this recipe as the base and it comes out fantastic!  Its also a recipe that you can do in the crock pot or if you are making this last minute it also does well on the stove top.

I skipped dredging meat in flour, I skipped butter while cooking the onions/garlic (I just put them back in the pan the meat was in, no need for butter) and I skipped the corn starch.  It will definitely be seen in our house again.  THanks

This stew was phenomenal!  I've tried a few stew recipes in the past and they all seemed to come up short in the flavor department except for this one.  I made it tonight for my family and they loved it!  I didn't make any changes to this recipe only one addition.........1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, that's it! And the only reason why I added the extra salt was to flavor the potatoes.  In my opinion, potatoes need salt.  Great recipe just as it is (with the addition of salt).  This has become our go to stew recipe.

This is a great recipe written as is, however I would recommend dicing the onion instead of quartering. I've tried with a few altercations such using chicken breast cut into cubes & adding parsnips and peas.  It makes a WONDERFUL chicken stew.  For chicken I use a chardonnay and for beef a pinot noir.

I made this with only about 2lbs of beef and one onion soup packet which was too strong. Next time I'll probably use 3lbs of beef with one soup packet. I also used two bags of frozen stew veggies and omitted the mushrooms. Cooked on high for 4 hours, then low for 1 hour (was short on time) and it came out thick and tender. Leftovers were delicious after I added some extra water. Even my picky one year old ate it. Will definitely make again.

The best stew I ever made..McCormick Beef stew seasoning mix packet in place of one of the onion soup packets and cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 2 1/2 hours due to time constraints and it was fork tender, delicious.

I have this recipe in my crockpot at the minute and it smells AMAZING!  All I have left to do is thicken it up.  I made this slightly differently by combining a few steps to make things a tad easier.  I tossed the onion in with the potatoes and carrots.  I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes and added a pinch of nutmeg.  I added basic seasonings to the flour mixture I shook the meat in, i.e: garlic, black pepper, etc.  I did not have fresh muchrooms, so I used a can of drained mushrooms and sauteed them with the minced garlic and the wine.  Near the end of cooking I added about 1 to 2 cups of frozen peas.  I am going to serve this with homemade rosemary bread on the side.  A perfect fall dinner!

This was the best beef stew recipe I've used! It was definitely thick and hearty enough for my hubby, and the kids loved it, too. The only things I did differently were slice the onions into wide slices instead of quarters, and left out the mushrooms because we don't like them. I poured the wine directly into the crock pot. This was fantastic, and we will be having it often!

I've tried many different styles of "Beef Stew" but this one by far has turned out to be one of my favorites...EVERYONE loved this and the flavor was wonderful.  Not to mention the SMELL while it was cooking on a CHILLY Sunday.  The hubby couldn't get enough of the stew! Thanks!

I made this yesterday afternoon and it tasted good when I stuck my spoon it.  Today when I heated it back up to serve it, I added an extra splash of wine.  It tasted even better today. I made half of the recipe for three of us.  We had an unexpected guest and it is gone! We ate every drop of it.  YUMMY!

I have made this twice now and enjoyed the flavor both times.  The first time I just threw everything into the crock pot.  I added a little more burgundy wine because I like the flavor.  I thought it turned out fine without the pre-bagging in flour etc.  Plus, I never had to add the cornstarch because I didn't add the 2 cups of boiling water, plus my meat was still partially frozen and I figured the moisture from there would make up for the lack of adding water.  I love mushrooms and onions so the amount for me was great.  You just add to your preference, it wont change the flavor of the meat.  I also added a few bay leaves like other viewers had suggested.  Give it try, make it your own, but the stew is great!

This was absolutely delicious!!!  The only difference is that I added more liquid because I like for there to be plenty of broth.  Also, I skipped the cornstarch step.  It wasn't thick on its own - but it was a consistency that I like for beef stew.  My husband and I couldn't get enough of it!

Yes, it's good - but that much better than any other beef stew?  Not sure about that.  I still think it could use a bit more seasoning.  I took tips from some of the other reviewers and skipped a few of the 'extra' steps like boiling the water, and I omitted the mushrooms because they're an instant turn-off for my kids (threw in celery instead).  Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely - and it definitely does take longer to get into the the crockpot than similar recipes.  All that being said, I'll still give it 4 stars!

Delicious! Cut out some steps to make it less time consuming, just threw two packets of the soup mix in the pot dry and added a carton of beef broth.  Also sautéed onion, mushrooms and garlic together and then used red wine to deglaze.  Otherwise followed exactly.  Get some good crusty bread to mop up every drop!

This stew was easy and very tasty.  My family doesn't generally care for stew but really enjoyed this one.  The only thing I did different was instead of cooking with the burgundy wine I used beef oxo.  Also did use mushrooms.   Worth trying for sure!

I made this last night and actually followed the recipe. My husband, who is British, usually doesn't really like the American beef stews and prefers the potatoless UK ones.  He all but licked his plate with this one. One thing I did, though, was what with living in the UK, I can get suet dumpling mix..so I did and they really fitted well with the stew. I'd think regular dumplings would be just as good. This recipe is a real keeper!

I have been looking for a good beef stew recipe because I'm not good with traditional dishes. I'm much better with Indian/Thai and other ethnic dishes. My husband eats just about anything and I could tell instantly that he didn't like it. At first I liked it but the more I ate the more I felt like I was eating onions. I only used 2 small onions too. I think I would omit the onions since it has onion soup in it, however, I probably won't make this again. Everything did cook nicely though, nothing was too mushy or crisp.

Off the charts. Best stew I've ever made. The only change I made was adding only 1 onion soup packet (b/c I only had one)  and it was still amazing, and probably less salty. Will make again.

Made this recipe today.  My family LOVED it. I am personally not a meat eater, so I didn't even try it, but my family said it was FABULOUS.  I did end up cooking the stew on the crock pot high setting for more hrs. than the low setting to ensure that everything was done within a 6 hr time frame.  The only thing I added to this recipe was Bisquick dumplings b/c my family loves them.  I will definitely make this one again.  Thank you!!!! 5 stars!

I made this over the weekend and it was absolutely delicious!!! I didn't have any red wine so I used some grape juice mixed with red wine vinegar and it still turned out great. This one is a keeper!!!!!

This recipe is excellent.   I added celery and left out the mushrooms.   Aside from that I made the recipe as written.  It's awesome, thanks!!

This is the best beef stew I have ever had. The only substitute I made was I used venison rather than beef...It was awesome!

SO GOOD! Whole family loved it! Will definitely make again, but next time with fewer potatoes and the addition of peas. The beef was so tender and flavorful!

OH MY!!! I did change this a bit, but what a great recipe. I used fresh parsley from my herb garden. and I only had 1 pkg. of dried onion soup mix, so I added 1 pack of Knorr vegetable package. I used about 6 cloves of garlic. But this was so wonderful. I made this before like is and canned about 6 quarts. But this way I cooked it was so much better. I think fresh herbs is the way to go. Thanks for posting.

I don't know what went wrong, but I made this and after an hour of prep (which is insane for a crockpot meal), this didn't taste right :(  I must have messed somethign up but I'm afraid to try it again - it was an expensive recipe!

I'm eating the leftovers right now infact! It was really really good.  I used a low sodium beef broth instead of water per other reviews and I did not use the mushrooms. You'd still want to add the wine to your pan to deglaze it of all the tastiness that's left over from browing the meat. Don't use a nonstick pan, otherwise you'll miss out on all the good stuff that sticks. I had mine in the crockpot for about 7 hours and the meat and veggies were perfect texture. The stew had a bit of a peppery taste and the wine really shined in this. It is my new stew recipe that I will be reusing for next time. Also there seems to be a lot of steps but I was able get everything together in about 30 minutes.

This was a great stew. The only thing that I changed was to use portabella mushrooms instead of button. That is just a personal preference of mine.

I think this is fairly good. I calculated it down for 4 people which substantially shifted some ingredients I wanted in so here is what I added: shallots, 2 tsp sweet paprika, 1.5 cups of red wine, 1cup of beef broth and 2 tsps of cumin. These gave it more flavor. One more thing, next time I'd brown the meat with something more than salt. the meat lacked flavor for me

I made this in a dutch oven, and was able to make this in an hour and a half on the stove top.  Went over very, very well with guests and I will definitely make this again.  I used a Cabernet for the wine.

This was absolutely AMAZING!!!  I cut the recipe in half and omitted the mushrooms as I can't stand them.  Also I was short on time so put it on High for 4 hours then Low for 1 hour. The only way I can explain how fabulous this was is by giving it 5 stars! As for making changes and short cuts like some reviewers did, WHY??  That's what makes this recipe so special and good!

Very good stew. I followed the directions to a T, except I used a little less onion and chopped it in smaller pieces. I also threw in a little chopped celery just so I could use it up.  I didn't have any red wine so I used cooking sherry. The preliminary work (i.e. you don't just toss everything in the crockpot) is worth it.  This stew has more flavor than my usual recipe, but I think it could use a little more, not sure what though. My husband LOVED it, said it was the best meal he's had all year.  I found myself very thirsty afterwards, perhaps from all the onion soup mix?

Followed this recipe almost exactly and it was perfect. Doubled the garlic and left out the mushrooms. Tasted like something my Mom would make. Hearty and full flavored. I need to find a way to not use Lipton soup mixes because they have MSG.

I made a few changes...I used beef 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 chicken. I only used1/2 of a bag of onion soup mix because we don't love the flavor of it. This turned out to be a great stew that suited our taste buds.

Big hit & very tasty!  I needed to add about 1/2c more liquid about hour 5 - maybe my cooker has a higher temp for low.

This was a really great recipe. Browning the beef in worcetshire sauce was a great additive--we could actually taste it after hours of slow cooking. I didn't cook the stew the entire 8 hours. I cooked it on high for 1.5 hours and then about 6 on low.  I also didn't sautee the garlic or onions, instead I added it straight to the stew. I also added garlic powder and onion salt and instead of using water I used beef broth for added richness and a dry packed of lipton mix. It was wonderful the way I made it and I will make it again. Oh, I also added lima beans, corn and fresh green beans.

This recipe was a hit!  The only changes I made were not adding mushrooms(the kids hate them) and putting the red wine on with the onions and garlic to help them soften.  I also didn't have 8 hours to cook this so I cooked it for 4 hours on high and 1 hour on low.  So good!  It's a perfect size for us.  We are a family of 8 and had food to spare.

Delicious.  I took some of the suggestions, based on what i had.  I didnt have any red wine but i used a little beef broth in the pan.  DELICIOUS.  I dont make it too much because its not exactly "healthy" but if i want comfort food, this is it.  I also added a lot more potatoes, im irish.

Simply the most wonderful stew ever. I have made this in the slow cooker and pressure cooker. The only change I make is more wine :) and two cubes of beef bullion and some seasoning salt instead of the onion soup mix. It is a lot of steps but worth every one and there are only two pots used so clean-up is not all that bad. I use fingerling potatoes and mini carrots and sliced mushrooms so there is little cutting of veggies.

This was the best meal I've made in years! Thanks for the great recipe. I agreed with Heidi's review and followed her minor changes. I used Spiced Wassail from Boordy Vinyards - this sweet/spicy red wine is great when heated and compliments the pinch of allspice added to the beef. I highly recommend Spiced Wassail for this recipe as well as the allspice. Thanks for the great recipe Heather.... it blows the other beef stew recipes out of the water. Also, thanks for the tweaks, Heidi!

I did this exactly as written, and it was truly the best stew we've ever eaten. Worth the extra steps for sure!

We made this and loved it. Used venison, sweet potatoes and beer instead of beef, white and wine because that's what was on hand. Will definitely make it again.

The results were definitely delicious, but there were a few steps I would have done differently. I think the combination of onion soup mix AND three large quartered onions made the overall stew a bit sweeter than I would like. Next time, I would use only 2 onions and chop them into smaller pieces. Also, the garlic and onion cook in the butter at different speeds, and it might have been better to saute them separately because the garlic started to burn before the onions were all that soft. I also only used one packet of onion soup mix with two cups of beef broth as someone else suggested. Overall, still a very delicious crock pot recipe.

This recipe had amazing flavors.  I did substitute one of the potatoes with parsnips and added two stalks of fresh celery as well as frozen peas at the end, just to get more veggies in there.  I also followed another reviewers advice and used beef broth instead of water.  I was short on time so cranked the slow cooker to high for 4 hours and then low for 2 hours and it came out perfectly!

Excellent stew but I did make some modifications.  I omitted the wine and mushrooms and added corn, celery, and green beans.  I also added a little more water.  Next time I'll have to make a double recipe since a single recipe is not enough for my family of 5.

I had never made beef stew before...only open Dinty Moore! I tried this minus the mushrooms and wine. I felt it had waaaayyy too much pepper. I only put in 1 tsp. Next time I will only put in 1/4 tsp and not the 1 1/2 tsp.  The flavor was terrific but too spicey from the pepper.

Yum!  DH loved this, so did DD12.  I cooked this on the stove instead of a crockpot.  I substituted venison for the beef stew meat.  I used a little more flour, added another cup of liquid and a beef bouillon cube and a little more wine . . .  Let it simmer for two hours.  Didn't need the cornstarch at the end--it was plenty thick enough.

I made this at work for one of our Saturay dinners and it was amazing!! Except for the hour and half we didn't realize the crock-pot wasn't on - it was great.  I added a little more cornstarch - I like it thick - and 1 less onion, but it was great and I was excited as a new cook!

I had never made homemade beef stew before and I was wanting to try it out before the upcoming cold months. I didn't follow this recipe to the letter, but it was very much my base. I didn't use wine or mushrooms and I halved the recipe. It was very delicious. I'll never buy a can of beef stew again. This was too easy and too delicious! I'll be making it again for Thaksgiving weekend when we've had all that we can stand of turkey!

I have been making beef stew for years and my family has always loved it.  Howevever, when I came across this recipe I thought it looked like a kicked-up version of my own and I gave it a try.  It was GREAT! I LOVE the addition of the wine (I used Port) and the prep work really makes a difference on the taste of the final product.  This is a fabulous recipe!

This stew was so good that my husband has had nothing but for the last four nights! I didn't make it in the crockpot because I had time to let it simmer and sometimes the crockpot makes things taste bland to me.  I used a more tender cut of meat (beef sirloin tips) and just let it simmer until the vegetables were done. I didn't use the wine, but used two cans of beef broth. It took less than an hour and a half to make.

My boyfriend (whose name is Kyle incidentally) doesn't like mushrooms so I didn't include those. I only seared the meat in the pan and dumped everything else straight into the crockpot and left it on low overnight. Turned out great!

Best beef stew ever! Didn’t add mushrooms and no need for the cornstarch at the end. I used beef broth instead of water. Deglazed the pan with the broth, water, soup mix and garlic to simplify the steps. Did not sauté the onions...just threw them in the crockpot.

I made this recipe exactly as listed except I added an extra carrot. This was by far the best beef stew I have ever had. I’m 54 years old and have had beef stew all of my life. I will never use another stew recipe.

This was fantastic!  Kyle (my husband) loved it!  I followed a previous reviewers advice and added the bay leaf and allspice. I omitted boiling the water and onion soup and just dumped them in along with the wine and mushrooms. In fact, I just dumped everything in after cooking the meat. I also substituted beef broth for the water, and half the Worcestershire sauce for coconut aminos, purely because I ran out of Worcestershire sauce.

Amazing stew. The recipe as is makes a HUGE amount, so we only put half in the crockpot once prepared and froze the rest. We also added whole peeled tomatoes (drained) and peas at the end. Fantastic recipe either way! Will definitely make again.

Good flavor. Made as written except can't use onion soup packets due to my husbands celiac issues (it contains gluten). I used beef broth instead. Will make again.

This is a great base!   I used brandy...boiled it down to deglaze pan with the veggies.  I have used the recipe twice adding what I have at home.   I always add carrots and potatoes to the slow cooker when there is only 2 hours left to cook. I used canned tomato crushed with basil, beef stock, table spoon of tomato paste, teaspoon adobo sauce, dash of chocolate.   But I think it is an easy recipe that can work into your schedule.  Never any leftovers, never any complaints, and we have  teenagers.

Half the amount of beef, all the veg (if not more). It was a big hit, with requests to make it routinely!

This was the best beef stew I ever made. Well actually it was the first time I ever made beef stew. I've never cared for beef stew or similar roasts but this was very flavorful. It wasn't real sweet and had plenty of liquid. I did make a few changes only because I didn't have some things on hand. I added 2 bay leaves based on other reviews, I used apple cider vinegar instead of wine, only used 2 onions cut in 8 pieces each, and instead of 2 packages of onion soup mix, used 3-4 beef bullion cubes and 1 PKG of onion soup mix and used flour to thicken instead of corn starch. It was great!

I made this as written.  It was a lot of prep work for a simple stew in a slow cooker and I didn't think it was worth all the time I put in.  It was ok but I've made other stew recipes that I like more so I won't be making this one again.

I thought it was delicious.  I did sauté the carrots and potatoes (Yukon gold)  as I have read that it adds extra flavor.  I used beef broth instead of water, added garlic powder and a cup of peas.  Great!

The taste is good but not the best I've had, there are too many steps that requires too much time - 3 stove top sautés before going to crock pot and another mixing mushrooms on stove before crock pot , taking 3 times longer than 30 min. for preparation. Adding cornstarch mix at the end for thickening did not mix well with the flour on the beef and potatoes & carrots, this made the stew lumpy, I was very disappointed with this result. Crock pot cooking should not require all that sautéing, it defeats the purpose of using the crock pot.

This is my go to stew recipe now.  I've made it several times as is.  I've also substituted elk or venison when I've had that.  It's great for using lesser cuts of meat.

The Best Ever!!! Thanks for sharing - it will now be a regular in my household. Although, this recipe does not need the cornstarch added at the end unless you like a very hearty and thick stew. I will not add cornstarch next time.

Make this a  couple of times during these "freezin' seasons"... Follow to a "T" except I add sliced celery (a stalk or two) to the onion/garlic step and another stalk or two straight to the crock pot . Also add just a little extra Worcestershire just because I like the flavor it gives. Tomorrow will be this season's first batch...can't wait !

This stew was amazing! My entire family couldn't get enough. The only change I made was using bear meat instead of beef. BONUS - my house smelled so wonderful all day!! Great recipe.

This one is a keeper, for sure. I omitted the onion soup mix (we don't do packaged foods), and I didn't have any mushrooms on hand. Otherwise, I followed the directions, and it was great. The beef was really tender. I halved the recipe except for the wine, which I kept at a half cup. Next time I will plan ahead and get some mushrooms. The only change I would make is to slice the onions and only add the garlic for the last 30 seconds that the onions cook. The quartered onions are unwieldy, and the garlic burns when added with the onions.

This recipe is great! I browned the beef with the Worsteshire. I added I bit more. I did not pre cook the veggies. I just cut them up and tossed in the crockpot.  Used beef broth and no onion soup mix. I also used fresh Italian parsley. I lastly added the red wine. I used 1 cup. 1 tablespoon of dried thyme was also added. It smelled so good while cooking! Very tasty

This was tasty, but BEWARE, the quantity was too large for my 5 qt cooker!  I had to leave the mushrooms completely out, because the pot was full already.  I did brown the meat, and I could only put in one onion, due to the quantity of food.  Scale down, if you have a 4 qt cooker!

So delicious!! I skipped the mushrooms because I really don't like them, and used eye of round steak, cut into cubes, instead of stew meat, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I brought leftovers for lunch for two of my co-workers and they said it was the best beef stew they had ever had.  I agree!  Served with thick slices of buttered crusty bread.  Absolutely scrumptious.  Made the house smell tantalizingly delicious all day too!!

This turned out great. Giving it four stars for the unnecessary steps. I can think of no reason to do steps 1-4. The whole point of a slowcooker is to let it do the cooking for you. I dumped everything into the cooker, omitted the oil and extra 1/4 cup pf water, added three tomatoes, and used mushroom onion soup mix. I added a can of green beans and a can of peas at the end. I didn't have cornstarch and used an extra 1/4 cup flour to thicken the juices. My husband loved it.

I have a lot of beef stew recipes but this is the best one I've ever tried.  I had to adjust the ingredients because I live alone but I want to freeze some of the stew in vacuum seal bags to take in my RV.  It was just delicious.

This is a winner!  Except for there not being any bacon or salt-pork, it would be called 'boeuf burguigon' (Julia Child would approve)!  What I did differently is:  no Crockpot in my kitchen large enough for this recipe!  I went on-line and found the temps for a Crockpot on high and low and translated it so I could use my oven and a large enameled casserole pot with cover.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of catsup but otherwise the ingredients were the same.  My oven on 300 degrees took 2.75 hours to cook fork tender.  I would adjust down to 275 degrees for a longer cooking.

Followed the recipe exactly and the stew was absolutely delicious. Meat was very tender and it was perfectly seasoned. Recipe will be added to our rotation.  Thank you for the recipe.  No more beef stew mixes for this family.

This was delicious. I added more wine than called for - used some to deglaze the pan after searing the beef, before cooking the onions. I added two bay leaves and also added a can of beef broth in the first hour because it didn't seem like there was enough liquid. It needed some salt at the end before serving, but it was delicious and perfect for a rainy Saturday in autumn.

Great recipe - hearty flavor!  I used a mushroom/onion soup mix in place of the onion mix, added a tablespoon of steak sauce, and a teaspoon of fennel seeds.

Great stew recipe. I've made it around 5 times pretty much just as written and it is perfect. We purchase a quarter of a cow every spring and by time of year I'm left with a bunch of random roasts. I cut them into stew meat and make this great stew.

My family loves this recipe. My Granddaughter can't get enough.  It is by far the best beef stew recipes I have ever tried.  The only change I make is I use pearl onions instead of large onions.  I also make buttermilk biscuits to serve with it.  Delicious Meal.  Such a wonderful hearty meal to come home to on a cold winters night.

I have made this twice.  The first time my only modification was to use reduced sodium beef broth and use only 1 packet of onion soup mix to further reduce the amount of salt.  The end result was still too salty for my husband & I, and was also thicker than we prefer.  But the taste was great!  For the second preparation, I used broth without salt, 1 packet soup mix, and kept the salt for the meat as directed.  Salt may be added as desired prior to thickening.  I increased the broth by about half the original amount and removed the crockpot lid for the last 30 minutes rather than thickening.  This left a nice gravy on the meat and vegetables.  I also added about 2 tsp paprika to the flour mixture.  The end result...a delicious stew that will be my only recipe from now on.

Made this today and cooked it all day on High in the Crock Pot. Meat came out "spoon tender!" I actually used a Sam's Club huge thing of stew meat (4+ lbs.)and made two Crock Pots worth "sort of" doubling the recipe. Gave the 2nd Crock Pot to a friend to take home to feed her family! Very Good Stew. Used some open Merlot for the wine in the mushrooms - worked great! Very versatile recipe and I am adding it to my Recipe Box! I didn't do the cornstarch step at the end. The potatoes had thickened it enough that I didn't feel like it was needed! Thanks for this!

I've made this recipe a few times by method of dump everything into the crockpot, usually forget the wine and mushrooms and end up with something edible.  I also tend to do only 4 hrs and thought I over cooked the meat when it was tough.  My sister raved about this recipe to me so this morning I followed the recipe exactly with some small shortcuts (jarred minced garlic and sliced mushrooms) and let it cook 6 hrs.  It's a little bit of work but didn't take long and it's so worth it!  The flavor was so good my husband didn't have to add salt like usual!  I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms but they add such a great flavor!  The meat fell apart!  It's a great crockpot meal for the weekend when you want leftovers for the week!

I've made this recipe twice as written and both times it turned out great. The first time I made it was for a baby shower and all the ladies who tried it loved it. The second time was yesterday for my husband and myself, and he said "A thousand times yes. Don't change anything next time you make it." We're foodies who enjoy a wide range of foods, but also appreciate simple comfort food. This has great depth of flavor without alienating those who prefer simpler foods. I may secretly cut down on the number of onions next time just because there were so many floating around the stew.

The recipe has quite a few steps, but if you're going to cut corners, definitely do not eliminate deglazing the skillet with the wine and mushrooms. That's where the great flavor comes from.

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have red wine so I left that out and instead of two packages of onion soup mix, I added one mix onion and 1 package of ranch dressing mix.  YUMMY!

My new favorite stew recipe.  Worth the extra effort when you figure once it's in the pot you don't have to do anything until it's time to dish it up.:)  Made Best Bread Maching Bread from this site to go with it. Delish!

This was a terrific "fancy" stew recipe. Much more complex in labor and flavors than run of the mill standard beef stews.  I do agree with another reviewer who said some of the steps aren't really necessary, so do what works best for you. I don't buy onion soup mix as a rule, so I just made my own seasoned dried onion mixture using dried minced onion, celery seed, chives, parsley, beef bouillon granules, onion powder and garlic powder. I did go a little heavy on the pepper so it was a bit spicy for my family but that was this cook's error.  Overall the recipe was incredible and I will definitely make it again. Kyle has great taste and has a great mom!

I followed the recipe except I didn't have red wine in the house (I know shocking...) so I used 1/8th cup of balsamic vinegar (with truffle oil), canned mushrooms (no fresh on hand), one pack of onion soup mix (all I had) and added some beef bouillon.  Also I didn't need to thicken it at the end. 

Rather than use a slow-cooker, since I started about 12:30 p.m., I used my pressure cooker. We were eating by 2:00 p.m. I pressure cooked it 45 minutes - 30 min would have been enough.  

I think the ingredients are great, but I think the technique can be simplified. Save some time, just brown your beef (important step), sauté your garlic, onions (if you want, or throw in pot) and fresh mushrooms in the same pan right afterwards (skip the added butter, use the wine here if you want or just put it in the pot), and then mix everything in your slow cooker or pressure cooker, depending on your time constraints. Pressure cooking makes this a week-night meal. Very tasty stew.

This is a great beef stew. After about 5 hours in the crock pot (you need a really nice sized crock pot because it makes alot) I tasted it for flavoring...decided it needed a little something added.  So, I added a can of Rotel tomatoes, can of beef consomme', a nice dash of garlic salt, about 1/4 cup of ketchup and THEN it all came together.
Served it to company and they all loved it on a nice chilly night.

I thought this was amazing. I did make a few changes, but they are minor and are as follows: I only used 1.5 pounds of beef stew meat and made up for that by using one extra potato and a pound of frozen peas. I used medium white mushrooms quartered instead of the button mushrooms. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. I think that it was a little labor intensive where it probably doesn't need to be...I will probably be lazy next time I make it. All in all this is a very tasty dish and reheats well. For dinner last night I had two bowls of it followed by another bowl reheated right before bed. Today for lunch at work, i had a small bowl of it with some ciabatta bread for dipping. Very tasty...and I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious.  I personally like more vegetables and less salty soups, so next time, I will just add one packet of french onion soup mix and add additional herbs (not including salt).  I'll also add morevegetables-probably carrots, corn and peas.

Whoa, baby, this is the one!  While my family loves any sort of beef stew, I'm not usually a fan ... except for "Kyle"s Favorite."  Delicious, exquisite, I can eat this for breakfast.  I halved the recipe, used fresh parsley and per another reviewer's idea, used canned beef broth instead of water, a pinch of allspice and some bay leaves.  This is simply heaven in a crockpot.  Thank you very much for sharing.

This is the best beef stew I have ever made, and possibly the best stew I have ever tasted.  

However, this is not a recipe where you throw everything into the crock pot and go to work.  There's no way this needs only 30 minutes preparation time.  I'll admit I'm a klutz in the kitchen, but it took me 1 1/2 hours.  The veggies need to be cut up. Brown the beef, "soften" the onions and garlic, cook the mushrooms "until they absorb the wine". How long is that? It didn't look any different after 10 minutes. 

I realize we shouldn’t rate these recipes when we have “tweaked” them, but I tweaked, and here's how.  

First of all I omitted the onion soup because I am allergic to MSG, and EVERY dry mix on the market, as well as EVERY canned soup and broth, contain MSG, even those that say, “No MSG.”  Those of us who are allergic to MSG know that “yeast extract,” and “autolyzed” or “hydrolyzed” anything are MSG with a different name.  

I had a cup of home-made beef broth in the freezer and I used that plus an additional cup of water.  

Is Worcestershire sauce a magic ingredient?  

I added 1 cup celery, used 16 oz. mushrooms, and used cooking wine instead of the “good stuff.”  I’d like to use the good stuff, but I don’t drink wine, so how do you keep corked wine after it’s opened?

It wasn’t real juicy, so I didn’t bother to thicken the gravy.  I’m thrilled with this recipe and thank you, Heather, for posting it.

I found this recipe because my husband does not like tomato based stews.  This was a great recipe and the family loved it.  I agree with other reviewers that it is a little labor intensive for your typical crockpot meal.  However, I do believe some of the steps, such as the sautéed the onion and garlic in butter gives it an added depth of flavor.  As with all recipes you adjust them to your personal style and likes.  I would agree adding beef broth is a great change.  The Worcestershire, wine, soup mix, should not be left out, this is what makes it different from the vast majority of stew recipes.

My favorite beef stew recipe. I didn't include the mushrooms because we don't like them but it was still very good! I have made this numerous times. My grocery store didn't have burgandy wine once so I used Merlot cooking wine. It was good but the burgandy is the best.

Delish!  I added a 15 oz can of beef broth and used onion mushroom and beefy onion mixes instead of plain onion, just becuase I keep those onhand in my pantry.  I also several celery stalks because they needed to be used up.  Cooking time was perfect, 1 hour on high then 8 hours on low for tender meat and it thickens up nicely with the cornstarch slurry.  Though I think if you were leaving for work you could skip the 1 hr on high step and stick it on low.  My honey loved that mushrooms were included in this stew.  I also added some dried thyme to the mix because I think it goes well with the red wine and I just like the spice in Winter meals.   I think the addition of a bay leaf or two would provide nice flavor as well, I'll try that next time.  Thanks for a great, hearty and satifying crockpot-friendly recipe!!

I usually half the recipe, but made the full recipe tonight and it was too big to properly cook in for my 6 qt slow cooker.  I needed to brown the beef in two batches.  Used 1 large onion and 6 small-medium potatoes, anymore would have been too much.  I really don't think you need to boil the water to add the onion (I use beefy onion) soup mix.  You can also probably  skip sauteing the onion and garlic and  go straight to deglazing the pan with the butter and wine.  For more flavor, do not use a non-stick pan.  I found I didn't have cornstarch, so I mashed 1tbs flour and 1 tbs butter with a fork and wisked in with gravy and it was wonderful. Absolutely delicious recipe!

I was craving a good beef stew and I'm not a great cook.  Worth the steps--both my picky kids who hate anything that combines meat and veggies in one dish loved it.  Also, instead of beef I used a couple of venison steaks my husband had been bugging me to cook (noone in family is a fan but him).  Tasted, smelled and looked great!

This was really great!  I don't seem to be able to cook something without altering a little.  So I used whole wheat flour and added thyme.  Also added celery and some garlic with the onion.   I used beef broth instead of water as others have mentioned. My teenage boys all loved it and went back for seconds!

Update: I just made this recipe for the 2nd time...and I still think the flavor is spectacular. The one change I will make for next time, I will par-boil the potatoes. I have found that even cooking them on low for 10hrs in the slow cooker, they are still a little hard. I prefer them to be a bit softer. Other than that, this recipe is a definite keeper!

Delicious!!! My first time making beef stew, and this will be the only recipe I will use in the future. The flavor is amazing. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I left out the mushroooms, and didn't add the water/cornstarch at the end (i liked the consistency as it was).

Best stew I've ever had!  Hubby loved it too, he kept saying, "this is really good".  It was hearty and full of flavor.  The only thing I changed was that I cut the onions up smaller.  Can't wait for the leftovers!

My boyfriend said this was the best beef stew he ever had, and I have made many.  I added some peas, celery.  I didn't have burgundy wine but I had cabernet which worked fine.  Will def add this to my recipe box!

Love this recipie and so does my family. I always double it and share small portions with elderly who always appreciate an easy, robust meal. I didn't add the cornstarch as the flour thickens it enough. Also, I cooked the beef for a couple of hours before adding the vegetables to ensure extra tender meat.

I can see why your son would call this world famous! My son loved it too! We ate it two nights in a row with homemade biscuits. I added celery and peas and left out the mushrooms, but otherwise follwed the recipe. My husband is usually the cook in the house, but I was able to get this recipe together (with a newborn in the house!) and it turned out great!

Stick to your ribs kinda meal!  I used leftover red wine I had in my refrigerator.  Next time I probably will use some beef stock in place of some of the water.  The recipie wasn't quite salty enough for me.  Other than that, it was a huge hit with my husband and me!

Very good!  I only browned the stew meat and put the veggies in raw (without sauteing).  I also didn't use mushrooms.  Otherwise, followed the directions.  I had to add about 2 more cups of homemade beef broth to bring it to the consistancy we like.  I used a Shiraz for the wine, we like that flavor and it was perfect.  I have tons of leftovers so I added a can of tomatoes, can of corn and a can of peas to the crockpot and will cook for a couple more hours.  That's the way my hubby prefers.

Good recipe! The tips with the flour and corn starch definitely helped make it thick and substantial. I used homemade beef stock that I had frozen instead of the water and onion soup mix. I chopped my onions and mushrooms into smaller pieces and added more wine than was called for. I added some greens that I had on hand, as well as a bay leaf. All in all it was hearty, healthy, tasty meal!

Probably the best tasting beef stew I have ever had.Kind of a pain to make, but well worth it. Would make again. Alot of prep work. I used presliced mushrooms instead of whole.

Since my son's name is also Kyle I of course had to try this.  WARNING.  This states 5 quart recipe. I have very large crockpot but needed my crockpot and another 1/4 crockpot.  You could throw everything in a crockpot and cook and it would be good.  Take the time for all the steps and it is wonderful!!!  If you are looking for a quick fast throw in and go recipe, this is not it.  The smells that continue all day from the sautee of the garlic/onion, the Worchester browned into the beef and the wine sauted into the mushrooms is unbelieveable.  I just wish I thought of boiling my 2 cups of water in the pan after all the other steps before putting it into crockpot. The drippings would have been wonderful. I was worried about all the onion and only had 2.  Since they were quartered and not chopped I figure it is ok.  I also only had the lipton dry beefy onion soup mix on hand.  This actual was a bit better because I didn't feel the need to add beef broth.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  Next time I will figure out how to cut it down and make it fit.

This is the best tasting crock pot stew that I have ever had,although it does require a fair amount of prep time.  I used a 1.5 lb. bag of small white potatoes that I cut in half, 1.5 lb of carrots cut up, 1 lb. of button mushrooms cut in half, my favorite red wine for cooking and added about 1/2 lb. of frozen peas at the end.  I did not need to add any cornstarch at the end.

LOVED this recipe!!!  I used only 1 packet of onion soup mix, used beef broth instead of water, and added 1 can of Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup (instead of button mushrooms)---this made the sauce thicker and creamier!!!

Que bueno! This was WONDERFUL. It is a little effort if you prepare according to instructions, but I actually enjoyed the process. My first time making beef stew, and I wouldn't do it any other way. Maybe just add a little more wine... :) Will make again!

This stew came out delicious, but I did have to make some modifications.  I didn't have any onion soup mix so I substituted beef boullion and onion powder and added a little more salt.  I also substituted two cans of sliced mushrooms for fresh.  It looked like it was missing green veggies so I threw in some frozen peas and green beans on the top layer.  I also added a couple bay leaves as suggested by another reviewer.  When it was done, it seemed to be missing something so I threw in a pinch of thyme, margoram and oregano and that seemed to do the trick.  This was the perfect comfort food for a bitter cold day.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the best stew I've ever had.  Takes some time to prepare the meat and cut all of the vegetables, but it is definitely worth it.  Me and my husband were able to eat this every day for a week!

This recipe is pretty good, it was my first time making beef stew.  I modified the recipe slightly based on some other reviews.  I did not dissolve the onion soup mix in boiling water, just threw it all in the crockpot and I left out the mushrooms.  It turned out a little sweeter than I like, next time I will probably use beef soup base instead of the onion soup mix to keep it less sweet tasting.

My husband said this was the best stew I've ever made, by far! (Though it did fill my crock pot pretty much to the brim and made me nervous, it turned out GREAT!)
