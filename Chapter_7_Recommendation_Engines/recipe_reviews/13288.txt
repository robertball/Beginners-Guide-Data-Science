There's a lot you can do with this recipe, beginning with buying the ham bone at any Honey Baked Ham Store--a coupla bucks and they usually leave about a pound of ham on 'em.

I don't brown anything first--just toss in as much diced onion, carrot, celery, and potato as you like. A little garlic adds an interesting dimension. I use a whole bag of dried split peas (not pre-soaked), and after they are cooked and beginning to fall apart, I add another half bag. By the end of the slow cooking time (at least 2 hours; longer is better), the first batch of peas has disintegrated, and the second is soft, cooked, but retains their shape.

Take it easy with the salt because the ham is usually very salty. UPDATE 2/6/20: HBH has discovered that there's quite a market for their hambones. So, they're now $10-15--about the price of a butt or shank ham in the grocery store. Oh well.

i always soak my peas overnight,,2 reasons , they cook faster and the more you soak and keep changing the water the less gas you will have from the peas!   great recipe!

Absolutely FANTASTIC.  I used the Easter ham bone, chopped up a little extra ham, threw it in the slow cooker with half a chopped onion, a pound of dried split peas, a quart of chicken broth and a little s&p and ground mustard and walked away.  6 hours later it was the most incredibly rich and flavorful pea soup I've ever tasted.  Didn't even soak the peas.  Will definitely make again.

I added two ribs of celery and one large carrot sliced thin, a bay leaf, a dash of hot pepper sauce,and a pinch of fines herbes.Good idea to wait on adding any salt until you taste at the end because some ham imparts enough salt. Good soup! We like it with cornbread or any crusty bread.

I did the Slow Cooker version, as suggested in other reviews. I used 1 small onion chopped and 2 Bay Leaves. Also used a smoked ham hock because I didn't have leftover ham w/bone. Put it all in the crock pot/slow cooker (except the oil, didn't need it) and cooked it on low all day (about 8-9 hrs). Then removed the bone and any fat from the ham hock, added another 15 oz. can of chicken broth because it was too thick and some more pepper (didn't use any salt because the ham or ham hock has enough) and served with hot rolls! IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!!! My husband said he thought it was the best split pea soup he has ever had! Thanks for an EASY AND YUMMY SOUP!

Split pea soup is a staple in our home (at least once in any 2 week cycle, especially during the winter) and this is a good "core" recipe for it. I generally use dried beans (usually 1 lb.), chicken bullion cubes (6-8) and just about any kind of pork, bacon, sausage or frankfurter (which I sautee in butter and with onions first) I have on hand. I usually cook the soup in my crock pot -- to which I add either (fresh or dried) parsley, oregano, basil, coriander; you know, whatever I like/whatever I feel like -- on "low", so that it REALLY slow cooks, adding carrots during the last hour (when I raise the temperature to "high"). I rarely include potatoes, but if/when I do, they are "pre-cooked" and added along with the carrots. Prior to serving, I emulsify at least PART of my "batch" (perhaps 1/3rd) in my blender and return it to "the pot". I serve it with a "side salad and either a loaf of "really heavy" and "crusted" bread (an Italian loaf or a French "bagette" is good, but my family favors either Sour Dough or Pumpernickel) on the side, or refrigerated biscuits or homemade dumplings "on top". Cheese helps as a "garnish" here. While my personal preference is Parmesan, some of my family members prefer American while others prefer Swiss. I also put out a container of Sour Cream for anyone (such as myself) who wants to "dollop" it. A meal onto itself! And HEALTHY! 

NOTE to "newbies" (or to others who have never experienced the WONDER of Split Pea Soup): it is THICK. Especially "t

Best pea soup I've eaten. Great base recipe and a few little additions makes it the best. When sauteing the onions add two diced ribs o' celery and four slice cloves o' garlic. I simmered the peas and veggies with four smoked pork shanks which yielded plenty of meat in the end. Added three diced carrots after 1 1/2 hours of cooking and that's it. Delectable with minimal effort :-)

Very good soup!  In place of 2/3 of the water, I used chicken broth.  I also added diced carrots, a little crushed garlic and diced smoke-flavored SPAM.  I didn't need to add any salt.  The taste is wonderful.  I do recommend stirring occasionally, especially towards the end, to avoid allowing the peas to form a thick paste at the bottom of the pan.  I also didn't find I needed to simmer for 2 hours.  After only about an hour, the peas were all cooked down, and it was ready to eat.

By far the best pea soup recipe I've ever tried. The addition of carrot, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme improved an already wonderful soup. I also used half chicken broth and half water. And it doesn't stink up the house! Thank you Sue!

I live in a neighborhood of elderly and struggling families, so I tried this in a super big pot.  Doubled the recipe, added a vidalia onion, garlic, carrots, and course ground pepper.  Let it sit on low for about 3.5 hours.  Ladled into containers and sent throughout the neighborhood on a dreary day, with a nice chunk of garlic bread.  Wonderful, easy, and so filling.  Comfort food and good for all.  Today this recipe actually fed about 14 people for less than four bucks.  Cannot beat that!

This is the way split pea soup is supposed to be...minus the oil because it doesn't need it. My husband and I absolutely love this recipe. It is the same recipe that has been handed down generation after generation in our famliy. We presoak our peas because I think it helps eliminate gas from the peas and it helps them disintegrate faster. This is such a great recipe on its own that it leaves me wondering why people add so much to it. If you add all those other vegetables then wouldn't it just be a creamy version of vegetable soup? And chicken broth to a ham soup? That just causes the true ham flavor to become muddled thus causing people to think it needs something more. Remember more is not always better, sometimes it is just more. This recipe is perfect as is!

Fabulous!  I love split pea and ham soup and this proved to be so easy yet so delicious I'll be making it more often than I thought! I soaked my peas overnight and opted for the crock pot method so there was no need for oil.  I just put everything into the crock pot using a chopped ham steak vs. a ham bone along with a couple of dashes of liquid smoke and couple of pinches of celery salt vs. salt. I also used 32 oz. of chicken broth vs. water for a richer flavor.  I set the crock pot to high for 2 hours and low for another 4-5 hours.  I didn't think it was going to thicken up, but the last hour it came together.  Next time I might add some carrots.  Great served with warm bread and perfect for cold fall nights!

When I was a kid, my parents were going out for the evening. My Mom told the babysitter not to let us go out and play if we didn't finish our dinner. As it turns out, our dinner was split pea soup. It was green and I was six. Not a good combination. As an adult, I absolutely love split pea soup and I really miss my Mother. Funny what you remember...

very minimal recipe-its hard to rate the recipe itself when it requires adding so much extra. I always add carrots and celery (not potatoes). I also just pre-soak the peas and rinse them several times. I also use diced up ham chunks in the pre-packages and use a little chicken base to flavor just a little more... After I soak the peas I just throw them in the pot with all the ingredients and cool until it thickens.

Oh man, this was delicious! I highly recommend it for first-time split pea soup makers (like me). I used a ham bone with a little extra ham on it, 2 (1#) bags of split peas (cooked with first bag for 2 hrs, then added the 2nd bag per a few other's suggestions & cooked for another hour or so), used a combination of water, chicken stock & even a can of beef stock, threw in a few random spices, some carrot slices (which next time I'll add more of those), & let it simmer. Removed the ham from the ham bone after it was done - Totally yummy & absolutely easy. IT MAKES A TON OF SOUP - but since it was so good, I froze enough for at least 2 more dinners (for 2 people). Served with some garlic french toast - DELICIOUS. I didn't add any salt to the main pot, but did add salt to my bowl - hubbs didn't need any extra salt. Tasted great for lunch the next day too! Thanks for such a great starter recipe!!

I actually made this about a week ago for my mother and grandmother. I personally can't stand peas, but my husband picked up a couple bags of split peas cheap and my mom loves split pea with ham soup and had not had it homemade recently. I purchased a ham bone from Honey Baked, however it was frozen, so I just dumped it in a large pot, covered it with water, and let it boil for about 20 minutes. It thawed nicely. I removed the bone and saved it for beans, but used most of the ham in the soup. I added about 1 1/4 bags (both were 16 oz bags) of split peas, let it cook for about 1 1/2 hours, then added the remaining 3/4 bag and let it cook for another 1 1/2 hours. My mother and grandmother raved about it. Made me feel prettuy good fixing them something they enjoyed so much.

While unfair to rate something while significantly altering, my husband raved over this soup after some modifications.  Yet that shows the greatness of this recipe: it's a fabulous basic recipe!  My additions were as suggested by the "Split pea soup" article here on Allrecipes: 
 - added more ham, a bay leaf, & ~1/2 tsp nutmeg to the pot initially with extra water too (covering about 1 1/2 inches above the ingredients in my pot).  I omitted salt due to the ham
 - Only added 2/3 lb initially and saved 1/3 lb of split peas until 30 minutes until the end.  I also cooked the soup a total of 1.25 hours, which left a smooth base with some texture
- I added 2 Tbsp lemon juice and 1/3 c whole milk at the end for extra flavor and creaminess (no the milk didn't curdle :) )

All I can say is YUM!  With the nutmeg and lemon, it has a great taste that is different than a lot of other "ham & bean" type soups that we tend to make a lot in our house.

great ham/pea soup, and very easy. I added carrots, potatoes and frozen peas/corn (at the end). I did not have any problems with it getting too thick, maybe it was even too thin. But half of the cooking time I kept the pot covered.

EDIT: I just made the recipe again. This time with the slow cooker over 6hours and half split peas/half lentils. It was great. 6 out of 5.

This was really yummy & simple!  I added 3/4 cups diced carrot (2 small carrots), 2 stalks celery, and used 4 cups chicken broth & 2 cups water.  It turned out great!  I put in lots of pepper because I love it.  I had ham steak on hand so I used that instead of the ham bone.  I love how this is a simple recipe that you can give or take depending on what you have available.

Great recipe.  I made this a couple of times soaking and not soaking the peas.  I will always soak the beans overnight from now on.  The soup tasted so much better.

Great recipe! Just like any soup recipe, you can add what you like. I used my slow cooker, threw in potatoes, carrots, and celery and it was fabulous! No need for us to add salt as there was plenty. Also because of the the slow-cooker I didn't cook the onions first. It's a great low-fat alternative to a cream soup that still gives that satisfying creamy texture. Yum!

I thought this recipe was a great base for split pea soup.  I added carrots and celery and sauteed those with the onions. I also used chicken stock instead of water, and didn't need to salt. I didn't have a ham bone, so I  used chopped pieces of ham instead. It turned out great and took no time at all to prepare.  I will definitely make this again.  Great flavor!

This was wonderful!!  I used 1/2 Tbl. butter instead of oil, 1 1/2 cups chopped (chunky) ham instead of a ham bone, and chicken broth instead of water.  I cooked it in a slow cooker on low for 4.5 hours, then added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  I was surprised that after cooling and refrigerating that it turned completely solid, but adding chicken broth (or water) while warming did the trick!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very thick, rich and delicious!  My wife who doesn't like split pea soup, loved this.   It is a regular now during the cold winter months.  For those who like it not so thick, just add a little water or fat free milk!

This was delicious - we're split pea soup fans.  I used leek as well as onion, added fresh parsley, and substituted bacon for the ham bone.  I cooked the bacon first, and then sauteed the vegetables in 2 TBPs leftover bacon fat.  I added the bacon when I added the liquid.  Great basic recipe!

Simple, but excellent.  I used the leftover ham bone from our christmas dinner.  Make sure you cook the soup over low heat and keep an eye on it, stirring occasionally.  It can stick to the bottom and burn.

I turned this into a split pea and bacon soup, since I had no ham bone, and my husband couldn't stop eating it. Very easy and delicious. Thanks!

Such an easy recipe to follow.  My hubby and I love split pea and ham soup and this recipe doesn't require a lot of time or ingredients.  I agree with Gramma about the salt.  Wait till the end of cooking time and do a taste test.  Don't forget the freshly ground black pepper.  Thanks Sue.

Great way to use the bone from a holiday ham. I have tried several split pea soup recipes...this was a 5*****. It has all the qualities for taste and easy cooking.
My family loves veggies, so I did add some celery, carrot, and of course a
a clove of garlic sauteed with the onions.

Super Good, Super Healthy, Super Cheap! What more could you ask? My secret ingredient? I add one to two tablespoons of brown sugar OR maple syrup to the pot. Everyone raves and can't figure out what's different! lol, just don't add too much, leave it as a background flavor.

I've been making this for years, and it is a very good soup. I don't saute the onions first, though. I just rinse and sort the split peas and put them in a crock pot covering with water, then add the ham bone, any meat I'm able to peel off of it, chopped onions, and some salt and pepper and simmer all day. Very tasty!

I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, completely omitted the salt and pepper, and used chicken stock instead of "water."  I found the a can of smoked Spam diced works just as well if you're on a budget.  Easy to make, and it's usually gone that night!

Great recipe and easy!!  I did not use the ham bone, but 1 lb of leftover honey-baked ham i had in the freezer.  Soup was very tasty!!  I did add chopped carrots and celery - this made for a better consistency.

I made this with the Thanksgiving ham bone and it turned out great.  I added celery with the onions and next time I'll add carrots too.  I found it didn't take as long to cook as the recipe said.  I will be making this again!

You don't just cut up ham and put IN it. For REAL ham flavor, use what is left of your ham(bones, gizzle, etc) and cook it down with water to make your own ham stock!! Then you use THAT instead of water and the ham flavor is amazing, right along with the split pea.I've been making it this way for YEARS, after every Easter ham.

I absolutely love split pea soup.  Growing up, my mom made this all the time.  It's so easy to make.  Like other reviewers I started using chicken broth.  I think this recipe is even better than my mom's recipe.  Thank you.  Already made it three times.  And it freezes well!

I followed some suggestions from others and added a bit to the soup.  I added diced carrot and celery and 4 chicken bullion cubes.  And it is delicious!  I soaked the peas for 3 hours, changing the water several times.  And the peas were completely ready after cooking in the soup for about 1 hour.  I used ham shanks, because they were on sale and the ham turned out really yummy.  This is a super affordable and easy soup to make!

This is fantastic!  I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover Christmas ham bone.  I also made mine in the slow cooker and used chicken broth.  I added minced shallots and diced carrots, dijon mustard and a bit of extra chopped ham.  I had some problems cooking it in the slow cooker, it always seemed to need more liquid, I think it would be easier to cook it on a stove top where you can stir more frequently.  However I don't think you can really get this wrong, it's idiot proof!  After it was done cooking I seasoned with Worchestershire, lemon juice, pepper and a little liquid smoke.  It doesn't need salt!  I used mostly low sodium chicken broth and it was still plenty salty for me.  My bag of split peas came with a packet of "ham flavoring," but I didn't need it! :)  Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent! As per other reviewers suggestions I added one bay leaf some thyme and a couple tsp. of chicken boullion a lot more water than the recipe suggests ( I like my soups watery not thick like a puree) the first time I made this soup I followed the recipe exactly and we liked it but the second time with this changes we loved it! I also made Favorite Corn Bread also from this site and we had a yummy satisfying dinner in a cold fall night, oh and I forgot to mention I made it in my slow cooker in low for 7 hr. Thanks Teetoe.

I was a little skeptical because of how simple this recipe is and yet it turned out wonderfully.  I usually follow things to a tee but for this I did take the advice of previous reviewers and made a few tiny alterations:  - I used about 3/4 pound of peas and added the last 1/4 pound at the end so there would be some non-disintegrated peas in the soup.  - I added carrots and celery to the onions to add some additional veggie goodness.  - I threw in a chicken bouillon cube or two with the water, as well as some herbs I had on hand.  (Literally, I just grabbed things out the cabinet and used them :-)  This may well have been the best pea soup I have ever had.  The consistency is soupy, not thick or goopy, which I'd feared.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Awesome for a base recipe. I simmered 2lbs of dry peas for about 30 minutes, then added some chicken bouillon to the water I used for the peas.  I sauteed a whole yellow onion with 2 cloves crushed garlic; once the onions were cooked clear I added a ham bone that I had frozen.  I added the bone to the "water" about a lb of the peas, onions and an herb satchel(rosemary, thyme, garlic and bayleaves) and cooked on the stove until the peas lost their shape.  Then I added about 2 cups each of celery, carrots and potatoes along with the rest of the peas to continue cooking.  I cooked the soup for about 4 hours altogether. I served it with crispy, cheesy (Parmesan and pizza cheese blend) croûtons made from a fresh baguette. Definitely delicious.  I went easy on the salt, adding it as it cooked because the ham bone was pretty salty.

I made this twice, once with a ham bone and again with ham and both times it turned out great.  Simple and delicious.  I'm another who doesn't feel the need to add anything else, it's perfect as is.  Thanks for sharing!!!

What a perfect winter soup.  I have been making this for years with my personal touch.  I first chop carrots, potatoes, onions and celery and give them a quick sautee in the bottom of a stockpot, just a few minutes, then add a couple cans of chicken broth, the peas and a ham bone.  Add enough water to cover the bone and toss in a couple bay leaves.  They really add something special to this soup.   After it has cooked a few hours I take the bone out, use my stick blender to smooth things out, remove meat from the bone and put the meat back into the soup and, voila, dinner.  We like to keep this dinner simple with triscuits and really sharp cheese.

I had already made a stock with leftover hambone and was looking for a recipe to use it in. This was perfect. I sauted the onions in olive oil and a little butter, then added the ham stock and split peas. It takes several hours to get a non-lumpy, creamy consistency, but the flavour is completely worth the extra time. Start making it around mid-day for evening supper. Simple and delicious!

I did a little changin' after I tried it the way it was listed. I soaked the peas overnight and then put everythang in a slow cooker/crockpot while I went to work for 5 hours. I used "No Salt" because I am on a sodium free diet and it tasted great anyway. I cubed some ham and didn't use the ham bone. It was great with my Limburger Cheese & Onion sammich too! :o)NO, I ain't a Redneck either by the way I spelt thangs.. hahaha

Great recipe with lots of flavor.  I used 2 cans of vegetable broth and water to completely cover the peas.  I added honey baked ham cut into cubes and they were delicious.  I cooked it in the crockpot with the temp set on HIGH and it took about 4 hours for the peas to fully disentegrate.  I did need to keep adding water as the liquid cooked down.  My husband added tabasco and loved the taste and went back for more.  Thanks Sue for sharing!!

This was delicious. I dont really like peas but this soup was yummy! I did it in the crock pot for 6-7 hrs on high. Did not soak the peas. I used a spiral ham hock! leftover, and it did an amazing job flavoring the soup. I also sauted some garlic with the onion. I also used chicken broth instead of water and cubes. It was really good. Thanks for all the suggestions.

It does need some carrots, garlic, celery and broth. I had some ham broth I'd frozen and I picked up a Honey Baked Ham bone.  Threw in a bay leaf, and two slices of chopped bacon, and this made a really fantastic soup! I don't believe it would have had the really rich flavor without the things that I added.

Delicious! This was my first time making split pea soup and it turned out great. The ham bone and leftover ham made the soup plenty salty, so be sure to let it cook thoroughly before adding extra seasoning.

EASY & Delicious!! I added 2 carrots (diced) and they melted right into the soup along with the split peas. I also added a dash of garlic and celery salt. I did use the left-over Easter ham bone (let simmer for 4 hours on the stove) and the meat was so tender and just fell right into the soup. : )

I don't know why most split pea recipes don't tell you that you have to soak your dried peas for a few hours or overnight. Also sometimes they don't soften up at all! I have hit this roadblock a few times and have resorted to using Campbell's Green Pea soup - boil your veggies in chicken stock until soft, then add the canned soup and some frozen peas for another 10-15 minutes.  This is a great recipe but if you don't want to mess with dried peas, go for the quick fix.

I added two stalks of celery and one large carrot, a bay leaf, some thyme, and a T. of whole grain mustard and a T. of chicken base.  Also added about 1.5 lbs of yellow and green peas. It turned out awesome - very quick and easy with a frozen left-over ham bone from Christmas!

Turned out really great! Super easy. I did add some diced carrots and celery and fresh thyme. I also substituted homemade chicken broth for water. And diced ham for the ham bone. Will definitely make again!

I liked the recipe. I used it as a base but made a few tweaks to it. I cooked the peas using two cans of low sodium chicken broth and three cups of water. I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic when I sauteed the onions in olive oil rather than the vegetable oil. I also used a boneless ham steak instead of a ham bone. I served it with a side of cheese toast and it complimented the soup nicely!!! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent simple recipe, although I did make a few changes.  I chopped and sauteed  an onion, 2 celery ribs, and a carrot.  Threw everything in the slow cooker with peas and a smoked ham shank (couldn't find a ham bone), added a bit of ground pepper, covered with water and left for 8 hours.  Then I just pulled the ham of the bone, with a spoon, and threw it back into the soup.  The end result was outstanding, even though my peas disintegrated.  I think 6 hours would have been plenty.

my first time making ham and split pea soup and what an AMAZING recipe!! I was nervous that mine wouldn't taste as good as my boyfriend's mother's and he says this soup is THE BEST he's ever had (yes - better than his mom's!)  I followed the directions using chopped ham, added some potato cubes, bay leaves, and pepper to taste. about an hour into cooking I also added a can of summer sweet peas for looks, texture and color. I substituted most of the water for low sodium chicken broth and didn't have any troubles with saltiness (also a great option for people with blood pressure concerns). I didn't soak the peas and my soup cooked to a perfect consistency in just about 90 minutes on the stove-top at medium-low heat. stirring often helps keep a good consistency throughout cooking and prevents big clumps or sticking. Couldn't ask for a more simple and DELICIOUS recipe! also re-heats nicely on the stove or in the microwave for a quick and delicious meal. I added more veggies while re-heating to freshen things up. Also served with some garlic toast instead of adding garlic to the soup. Yummy and a definite staple recipe in my kitchen!

I've never made split pea soup before - my husband always makes that nasty stuff from the can - ughh.  This recipe was simple so it was a great place to start.  I added garlic (I can't cook with out it).  The soup was good, but nothing to write home to mom about.  Now that I've made it once, I'll probably experiment with other recipes and flavor additions.
All in all, it was a simple, tasty soup without a bunch of bells and whistles.

We loved this recipe.  I've always been a split pea and ham soup fan.  My husband was a bit skeptical but one taste took away any doubts.  This recipe couldn't have been any easier.  I did brown the onions first and added garlic too (which I do to most things).  I used pork hocks on the suggestion of my butcher...I'm not sure I'd do that again.  I think it produced good flavor but there was virtually no meat on the hocks to shred off (I'd never used hocks before).  I'll search around for a better ham bone solution next time.  This is a keeper for our family...my 4 year old son had 2 bowls too.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I used one ham bone, 2, 1# bags of peas and 8 cups of water.  Use low-sodium chicken broth in place of some of the water.  ...maybe instead of half of the water.

I'm not a big split pea fan but really liked this recipe. My soup was a little runny but I had to use a large stock pot to accomodate the ham bone and therefore probably used more water. Maybe there would be less trouble with consistency if the amount of water to add was more specific.

This is a good recipe, but I had trouble getting the peas to fully disintegrate.  I let the soup cook all afternoon and it never became 100% liquid; There was still small little chunks of split peas even after all that cooking.  Too, step 2 doesn't provide information on cooking temperature.  That may be why the peas didn't completely "melt" for me.  I assumed that it should be cooked on "Low" or "Low-Medium," but good recipes shouldn't allow the cook to assume too much.  These things might be intuitive for experienced cooks, but I've only been cooking for a few years, so I still have a lot to learn.  I need specifics!  Still, the taste was good.  I used chicken broth in place of water and also used some milk to thin it out after awhile.

My first try at this soup.  We had a ham bone from Christmas and I didn't want it to go to waste.  I found this recipe and it was so easy and just delicious!  I doubled it because the ham bone I had was huge and added sliced carrots but that is the only variance I made.  It's my husband's new favorite soup!

I started with this recipe and then dumped out the water and trying again with another allrecipes recipe.  It says to cover the ingredients with water.  So if you include the ham bone, that is pretty high.  I dumped in the split peas and thought, no way is this going to work. I like recipes that specifically state the amount of ingredients.  Another recipe states 2 qts of water for a bag of peas - that makes more sense.

Delicious!  Very easy and affordable, too.  I did not soak the peas at all; just used the slow cooker and it turned out amazing.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Perfect!  Added a couple spices recommended in other reviews (bay leaf, parsley, chicken broth, oregano, diced garlic to cook in the last minute when sauteeing onions, and coriander) and also put 1/2 the split peas in 3 hrs after the start when I slow cooked it in the crock for a better texture. Yum!

So easy and Super GOOD.  I skipped the sautee in oil step and just threw onions, peas and ham bone and some of the ham cut off the bone into the slow cooker.  As one reviewer suggests, I put in another full bag of peas about 2 hrs from serving so there were some pureed and some whole but soft peas.  I couldn't believe all the kids ate it despite the color.

The most basic split pea recipe I have eve seen... If you are lookig for a recipe that calls for very limited ingredients then you have found it. this one was very blah to us.  I was kinda hoping the simplicity of this recipe was going to be like what my grandmother used to make.  It was lacking taste.  However I give it more stars for the simplicity...

We throw in some peppercorns, bay leaves from our tree and a potato to thicken it up.  Nice simple recipe that we can vary with what is available whether carrots added or no meat available.  Great on a tight budget, thanks for a great recipe.

I use trotters instead of ham.  They provide low calorie protien (gelatin) and decreases the salt, which I feel overpowers the subtle array of flavors.

I also add 1 T of dry sherry to each large bowl - it adds a slight nutty taste to the soup.

I've yet to try the original recipe, but I didn't make that many adjustments when I made it.  I added two diced carrots, next time, I'll add three.  I used four small cubes chicken boullion when I added the water (a cube per cup).  I also added a couple of dashes of celery salt.  I'll definitely make it again though.  It was great with some buttered french bread.

Really good for my first try! I didn’t have an onion on hand so I substituted with 1 tbsp of onion powder. I filled up my pot until everything was covered but that ended up being too much water. But that was easy to fix since most of the water floated to the top and the split peas stayed at the bottom so I just scooped out what I needed. I think next time I’ll just use 2 quarts or less of water regardless of whether it covers all the bones or not. I ended up adding 3 cups of chicken broth just to add more flavor and went heavy on the salt and pepper because it tasted too bland without it. Will definitely try this again with chopped onions and carrots next time.

This was my first ever attempt at making pea soup & it came out great.  I read a lot of the other reviews & added things like carrots, celery, garlic & some homemade chicken stock which I substituted for some of the water.  I already had a ham bone but I also added cubed ham in the last half hour of cook time.  My husband and a friend, who happened to be over, loved it & we have PLENTY of left overs!!!  The one thing I would caution anyone about is how much water to add - you can always thin it out with more liquid, just be sure to check the instructions on the split pea bag so you don't make it too runny.  I had a large ham bone & the recipe said to cover all ingredients.  I realized after I added the liquid that I probably had too much & thankfully scooped some out before it started to cook.

WOW!!
Like others mentioned, I added 3 cloves crushed garlic and 1 1/2 carrots, finely chopped, and I replaced most of the water for chicken broth.  Also, I used the bone and remaining ham from a spiral sliced honey ham we'd had for dinner a few nights before.Be careful with the salt, not too necessary when you make it this way.
Very economical if you get the ham on sale.

Excellent soup!  I made this in the crockpot on low.  After about 2.5 hours I added some chopped carrot and cooked for another 1-1.5 hours.  This soup was even better the next day.  Will definitely make again.

I was excited for WEEKS about making this soup, and finally got around to doing it. I am singlr so didn't make a huge pot, but I sauteed half of a medium onion, added 2 cups of rinsed split peas, a box of chicken broth, chopped carrots, 1 diced red potato, about a cup's worth of cubed ham, pepper, a dash of salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. I have let this simmer for about 3 hours now, and just tasted it. YUM. It is already amazing and will just get better with time! Thank you for the awesome-ness!

I'm new to this community so first I thought it was weird to read all the ratings when no one seemed to actually be following this recipe!  But I also made it with some variations and thought it was great - and will continue to make with different variations as well.  I used about 1 1/2 c chopped onion, 1 1/2 c chopped carrot and chopped 6 slices of canadian bacon for a lower fat version than original recipe.  I browned all of this with olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I used 6 cups water and 4 tsp chicken bouillon paste.  I cooked in pot for 1 1/2 hours.  Everything came out great and the soup still had some nice texture, which I love.  I also used a lot of fresh ground pepper -- but I'm a pepper lover.  Easy!

Holy Cow!  This recipe was easy.  I threw the onion, split peas, a smoked ham hock, and a large container of chicken broth into my crock pot and seven hours later I had an ugly mush... BUT I removed the hock, and put the rest of the mess in the blender and OMG.  Seriously good.  If it's not hammy enough for you throw a lean ham steak into the mess.  Slice it up and put it in the blender as well with a bit of soup.  Thickens it all up and the whole family LOVED it.  I told my boss it's "fiberrific" and "hamtacular".

This was pretty good. I added 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard for extra flavor. You know how you can add baking soda to beans while their cooking to cut down the gassiness? Yeah, DON'T DO THAT WITH THIS RECIPE. It didn't really change the flavor, it just made a huge mess on my stove because it caused it to keep boiling over. Other than the mess, it was good. It would make a good winter soup.

This recipe is great!  I add diced carrots and save 1/2 cup of the peas to put in about 20 minutes before cooling to add texture.  This is a great fall/winter meal served with corn bread and wine!  :)

I don't like split pea soup, but I loved this (getting older does make your tastes change).  Once I added dumplings to this per hubby's request, he said it tasted just like his moms.  Thanks for an easy pleasing recipe.

Good soup. I didn't use a ham bone but rather I used a freezer bag full of chopped ham from some long-past dinner. Very hearty. My husband doesn't eat the stuff so I have frozen some for future meals (mmmm lunch!) and given some to my best friend whose toddler thinks its awesome!

This is a great basic split pea soup that leaves much room for additions.  I added some veggies and country ham and it was delicious!

Delicious! Just finished a bowl. I used my crock pot. Slow cooked all day with ham bone. Threw in extra ham when almost done so it wouldn't fall apart and lose flavor, also some carrots. I also used chicken broth.  Very very yummy!

Wonderful base recipe.  I used (2) cans low sodium chicken broth & two c. water in crock pot & added to sorted, rinsed  split peas.  In pan, diced 1 med. onion 3 celery stalks & tossed with little olive oil/and butter.  Added to pea mixture along with a little fresh gr. pepper, oregano, basil, thyme & added a ham steak diced (w/bone for flavor).  Cooked 5 hrs then diced carrots & 3 potatoes for another 1.5 hrs.  Wonderful.  The family loved it.

Great recipe!  I doubled it, as had alot of people here for the holidays, and they all raved about it.  Very easy and a great way to use up the Christmas ham.  I also added a couple of cups of ham that was left over after being cut off the bone.  My husband HATES English peas but he thought this was great!  Would definitely make again.

I made this today...I used 1 small onion, 1 lb bag of green split peas,chopped up leftover Christmas Eve ham, chicken broth and salt and pepper. I dumped all ingredients in slow cooker, and cooked on high for about 3 1/2 hours. The peas never fully disintegrated, so I put it in a blender, and pureed. Then it was too thick, so I thinned it out with more chicken broth. It was then the right consistency for me, and there wasn't any more chunky peas or ham chunks. I liked it.

Followed suggestions: Cooked in crock pot for 8 hours on low. Used 3 cans of chicken broth instead of water, used honey baked ham. Soup was too thin, next time I will use less chicken broth and add more if needed. Everyone liked this soup and there were no leftovers.

So easy and absolutely delicious. I made the recipe as is, except I did add a bay leaf and 1/2 tsp. thyme. I used 7 cups of water, since I wasn't sure whether to cover the peas or the bone too, and it was perfect. I'll be making this hearty chill-chaser again!

This was extremely easy to make.  I didn't even measure the ingredients.  I just "winged it", threw it all together.  Mine was ready in less than the two hours stated in the recipe.  My husband and I both loved this soup.  He actually told me that if we weren't married, and he had just met me and I made this soup for him, he would propose to me!  That's some powerful soup!

Love it. Always make as written first and it was a perfect, simple base. The beauty of I didn't saute my onions. I finely chopped a ham steak and an onion, tossed them in a Ziploc, added liquid smoke and let that marinate overnight. I like a smooth, less thick soup so I added more water throughout cooking. I also added chicken base to the water for more flavor. My seasonings were Beau Monde, garlic hot sauce and smoked black pepper. I cooked the peas down for two hours before I added the ham and onion mixture then cooked another hour or so until I had a pureed soup without having to use a blender or mixer. To serve, I ladle it into bowls, give it a fresh sprinkle of smoked pepper and pat of butter. Tonight it was oyster crackers and garlic toast on the side. SO WONDERFUL! It makes you forget it's 28 degrees outside.

Yum, my first time making split pea soup.  Used the bone from the Easter ham, added diced carrots and garlic to the recipe and used yellow peas since that's what I had.  Very tasty soup!

I was not a fan of Split Pea soup growing up. I thought I would try my own twist on it and it worked out. I added carrots, celery, and used half veggie broth half water as suggested by others. It all became a super smooth soup. No worries about it not tasting like pea soup with the other stuff..  It was done sooner than expected so next time I will take off the heat sooner and let it thicken. I made this for my husband who had been looking forward to this after thanksgiving recipe. I will try again and not cook as long.

You can do a lot with this recipe. I add carrots and celery with the onion, then add the peas, ham hocks, chicken broth and water. I also like to add a bay leaf or two and my Dad's seceret weapon was always marjoram. Oh and since I use ham hocks, I chop up 2 ham steaks near the end......very good!

A pretty good soup but cannot hold a match to more heartier versions that contain carrots and other vegetables. Still, it has a pretty good flavour, considering its simplicity.

Great Soup!, I cooked it in the crock pot with a left over ham bone, threw in some garlic powder, a bay leaf and some chopped up carrots, after it was done I thickened it a little with instant potatoes. Will definitely be making again

great base recipe - I added 2 bay leaves, 2 chopped carrotts, one rib celery and 2 ckn bouillon cubes.  Perfect!  Made in crockpot - no oil, 10 hours on low.

Pretty good. I cooked a ham bone all night in crockpot with onion and celery. Cooled and threw out veggies. Put water in pot with new onion and celery, bay leaf, pepper, dry mustard, pepper...little salt, 1 lb bag of green split peas. Add some cut up carrots and toward the end leftover cut up ham.  really good flavor... cheap and easy soup to make. homemade bread to top it off! Great warm supper! thanks!

I usually use ham hocks, but I didn't have any, so I used about 3/4 lb. of bacon.  Saute bacon till brown, drain grease, add 1 chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic, 3 carrots, 3 ribs of celery (which I chopped in the food processor), 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom, 1/8 tsp. of cloves, 1/8 tsp. of allspice, 1 bayleaf, 2 tsp. chili garlic sauce & 1 tsp. salt.  Saute the veges for a few minutes, than add 3 cups of yellow split peas.  Fill the pan with water, and add more water as needed.  Cook a couple of hours till everything is soft.  The spices really perk up this recipe.  Delicious!

The basic flavour was good.  I added pieces of ham, 1/2 tsp of ground cumin, and garlic.  I also added some carrot to give it more colour.

I personally don't like Split Pea and Ham Soup, it is vile!!!  But my boyfriend asked me to make it for him after our Easter Ham dinner.  I used this recipe and he thought it was the best soup he had ever eaten!!!  I will definitely make this again if there are ham leftovers!!!

I got rave reviews from this recipe and have made 2 double batches for all of my family to take home and freeze. I used the chicken broth as reccommended by others, and cut up a ham steak instead of messing with the ham bone. I also added some shredded carrots and diced celery. It is so simple and you won't be disappointed. My double batch cost about $6 to make and I have enough for 4 meals, and the kids loved it too!

This recipe is awesome. Some changes I made: used olive oil to saute carrots, onions and garlic added a bit of chili flakes for some oomph This is a perfect soup for Canadian winter evenings. Thanks for sharing.

This was a bit rich for us. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making this. If I make this again, I will water it down quite a bit towards the end of cooking.

I can't believe how cheap this recipe is to make and how few ingredients there are in this recipe and how good it ends up coming out!  It's cheap to make and delicious.  I'm going to try the 2 cans of chicken broth next time, to make it richer.  I added 2-3 cloves of garlic which I think are key (although my split-pea-soup-expert-boyfriend thinks that the garlic taste was weird, so I may go without next time).  I also got a Honey Baked Ham bone and shaved off some of the ham for later breakfasts, and wish I had left more on to chunk into the soup, it tastes so so good.  As others have said, eased up on the salt as the Honey Baked Ham was salty to begin with.

This was awesome..I cooked it in a slow cooker on high for 4 hrs. As others suggested I added a bay leaf, 1 carrot,chicken broth and no salt. I put everything in at once. I added to much water, so before I used my immersion hand blender I removed some liquid and then added it back as needed. Everyone loved it.

This was a great soup!  I made a couple of changes.  First, I tossed the oil and put all of the ingredients in a crock pot overnight.  Second, I used country ham pieces rather than a ham bone.  It was out of this world and I am making it again tonight!!

Great simple directions to make a wonderful old fashionedsoup. Even the "pea haters", myself included, really enjoyed this. I used ham hocks which gave nice flavour. Next time I will try yellow split peas and a smoked picnic ham with the bone in.

This was very very good!  I didn't have a ham bone, so I added about 1 pound of ham cubes to the mix.  I also added 1 potato (cubed), 2 stalks of celery (chopped), and 1 carrot (chopped).  I also used reduced sodium chicken stock to the soup instead of water (two 14.5 oz. cans).  I added the salt and pepper towards the end.  This only needed about an hour to cook.  I let this sit overnight and it thickened quite a bit so I added more water when I reheated it.  Next time I would probably add atleast three cans of chicken stock.  Very good recipe and highly recommend!

I love this soup!  6 ingredients, you can't get much more basic than that, and you can add absolutely anything to it to make it stretch.  I like to add lots of veggies; diced carrot, celery, and potato, or anything else that I need to use up in the refrigerator.  Thyme and bayleaf are also great additions, and add a homey flavor.  Add some amusement park cornbread from this site, and you have a perfect meal for practically nothing!

I have been making peasoup similar to this one for many years. I sometimes do not have a ham bone, then I get a large ham steak which I cube and saute it together with the onions, I also always add a few carrots and potatoes cut in small cubes. Toasted bread cubes dropped in the soup just before eating, really yummy!!!

A great basic recipe for getting rid of the hambone.  Added 1c diced carrot half way through cooking for variety.  As always, this is more delicious the next day after an overnight in the fridge; ready for after sking enjoyment.

This recipe could not be easier or more delicious! I had some leftover ham and decided I really wanted to learn how to make split pea soup from scratch. This recipe helped a lot. It could not be simpler, you just put the dried split peas in a pot, chop up some ham (salty ham is better I think) cover with water or chicken broth (I used water with 4 bullion cubes). I forgot to add the onion but it turned out wonderful even without the onion. If you don't soak the peas (I didn't) it does take almost two hours of simmering, like the recipe says, but that all depends on how thick or dissolved you want your soup. If you're okay with it having a lot of peas still undissolved, you don't have to simmer it more than 40 minutes. Just keep an eye on it and let it simmer until it's the consistency you want it. The salt from the ham made it so I did not have to season it at all!! So Yummy and I will definitely be making this soup all winter.

As someone in another review mentioned, the recipe is minimalist and not much to say about it.  I cook the ham and onions, carrots and celery with the ham for at least an hour before adding split peas.  I always use Yellow Split peas because it makes a more appetizing appearance when served. ( I think this may be a French Canadian version of the recipe)

I like to make recipes as written at leasy the 1st times so Ican rate the actural recipe.  This was VERY good. I "get" all the changes folks made such as garlic, a bay leaf, carrots, potatoes, chicken broth, etc but the recipe is quite good, as is.  When I make it again, I'll add garlic and a bay leaf because I like the flavor both would add.

I picked this recipe because it was the closest to what my father use to make when I was young.   It was right on perfect!  Great taste, I did add a little chicken bouillon unlike my father does but the taste was great.  Just wished my father lived closer he would loved this

So easy to prepare and very delicious! I used the leftover ham bone from Easter.  I followed the recipe as it and it was perfect!  After it cooled down the fat rose to the top and I just scooped it out. Will definitely make again if I have another ham bone on hand!

Excellent recipe, simple and delicious. Thanks for posting.
My grandmother was well-known for her homemade split pea soup with ham. When she served it for lunch on Thursdays at my grandparent's bar and grill in New York City, the line would be out the door. She's been gone awhile now, and I'm 55 years-old, divorced and have learned to do my own cooking. I still remember my grandma's pea soup and was looking to put the leftover ham bone and scraps from Easter Sunday to good use. I asked my mother for the recipe but she said "Grandma didn't have a recipe, the recipe was in her head. But it was simple." After searching online I decided that this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. The smell of it cooking brought back fond memories, and it tastes delicious! Just like the famous, delicious homemade split pea soup made by my beloved grandmother, Leonia Gogo Jans (1906-1983).

Very yummy!  My ham bone was larger then what was stated on the recipe so it needed more water to cover it.  Because of the extra water, a little salt was needed but added towards the end.  Also, some onion powder pepper, and a little adobo.  Additional bag of peas would have been nice and I will do next time.  I also added some potato's to thicken it up because my husband likes a thicker soup.  It was a nice touch but will try it without next time.  I will also not add the carrots as early as I did the next time.  They became too mushy.  All in all, a very yummy soup and I will highly recommend.

I've been making this over a year now.  It's fantastic.  And, talk about healthy!!

Three things I would add to this recipe:  
(1) Add diced carrots 
(2) Add more water than to 'just cover'.  The peas really soak it up.  (3) Simmer it for 3 hours checking on it occasionally.  It seems the longer I cook it the better it is.  You just have to make sure there is enough water to totally cover the ingredients.  

I use a hand blender.  I happen to have a cuisinart one.  It works like a charm to blend it well and there's no mess.  Easy Peasy.

This turned out so good! I especially loved how easy this recipe is. You just combine everything and leave it and it tastes awesome. I doubled the recipe and added a carton of chicken stock. This will be my pea soup go to recipe.

Very good recipe. I added half cup of chopped carrots and celery, thyme, and used 2 cups of chicken stock. It needed about 6 cups of liquid to 1 lb of dried peas. If it gets too thick, you can always add more water. Make a large batch and freeze it.

This turned out really well!  I changed it up a bit based on other reviews: half water and half chicken broth, added ground mustard & garlic powder, added sliced carrots, added cubed ham, and served with french bread.  I did the stove top version.  I would recommend that if you use this method to cook on medium-low heat.  I had ours on low and it took much longer than two hours for the peas to break down.

Classic, easy, fool-proof, AND DELICIOUS! it is a great recipe as written, but also very easy to add carrots and potatoes etc. (I substituted 1 pound of ham bone for 4 packets of Goya "Jamon" ham flavor concentrate ($1.79 for a box of 8 packets in the food store))

Great soup.  I use a whole peeled onions, which I remove later, and 12 cups of water.  If you have no bone, use 4 cups of chicken broth and 8 cups of water.  Cook for the 2 hours, comes out nice and thick.

I was almost affraid to try this because I didn't figure my family would like it. I on the other hand am always up to trying new things. It was very easy to make and we all liked it. I was VERY shocked when my husband went back for seconds. Next time I am going to try adding some carrots and potatoes.

Pretty good. Thickens up pretty fast though. Had to keep adding water to thin it out to be more like soup, and with all the added water ended up being more like 6-8 servings instead of 4.

This was great.  I used a Honey Baked Ham bone,cooked in a slow cooker for two hrs. on high and five hrs. on low.  I also sauted the onions first.  My wife was very pleased.

This was tasty. I didn't have a ham bone, but I did have the ham, so I added some to the mix.  YUM! I don't like split pea soup, but this is perfect for that cold day. I served it with wheat rolls, and it was a hit for everyone who doesn't care what color their food is. :D

I love this recipe! This is my second time doing it. I always add two garlic cloves. I add half of a cup of split peas to it. Trust me  
it really makes a difference.

What a great winter meal! It was so easy to make. I added a few chopped carrots but other than that I stuck to the recipe. My toddlers and husband loved it.

So good and so simple, I followed it exactly and it was perfect.  I made it in my dutch oven and it was done in an hour in 15 min on medium heat.  I might try carrots and celery next time just to see the difference in taste, but it's a keeper, great recipe!

I guess this is pretty basic, it was eatable but very bland, it needed something. On the plus side it was very easy.

fabulous, my husband and I really loved this recipe.  Of course it matters the flavors you use when making your ham... all the flavors of our Orange-bourban ham came out in the soup... yummy!

i suppose i should take the blame for this, but my only substitution was beef stock in place of water. Too icky for even my huband to eat. it put him off pea soup so badly, he doesn't even want me to try again! ps does cook down faster than 2 hours.

I sauteed onion and celery first, used two ham steaks w/ bone, plus one knorr chicken bullion.  Simmered for about and hour, added diced carrot and a very small amount of potato (1/2 cup).  I did have to add about three cups additional water, which cut the salt flavor and made it perfect. Thick, delicious fall/winter comfort meal!  I served more than four with this.

I've always made this soup and add many vegi's: carrots, potatos, celery and onion (the more I can sneak in for my kids the better). When I don't have a ham bone I buy a ham hock then I sometimes add cut up hot dogs (for the kids) or kilbasi.  Yummy!!

Absolutely delicious. I followed everyone else's tips and didn't cook the peas as long. The soup needed a little extra salt and pepper. Yummy!

I love this recipe because it is simple, cheap to make, is filling and very delicious!  I used about a half pound of deli ham cut into pieces instead of a ham bone and it turned out great.  I also added chopped carrots.  After it had cooked for the 2 hours, I blended it with an immersion (stick) blender.  My family LOVED this recipe.  I will definitely be making this throughout the winter!

mmmh, so ugly but so good!!  I used sliced ham instead of the bone (ewww!) maybe it was because of this I found it a bit bland so I added some beef boullion and a bit of worcerstershire sauce. I also added some potatoes and carrots, in the end it was very hearty and filling. I added water a few times and it took about an 1 1/2hrs I served it with a dollup of sour cream on top, to make it creamy.  Very good for a chilly evening, and great heated up for lunch the next day!

Excellent!  This is a super easy and very tasty recipe.  However I didnt use a ham bone..I just chopped up ham and put right in with the sauteed onion and peas and coverd with canned chicken broth and water.  You have to keep and eye on it because the peas really soak up the liquid.  I made it in the morning and by dinner time all the flavors combined together making it just delicious!  Thanks Sue!

Great Soup!!! I used this recipe as a base and added 1 carrot (chopped finely), 1 potato (cubed). Instead of using a ham bone I bought a precooked ham in the store and cubed about 1/2lb of the meat. I also used chicken broth instead of water (only using water when the chicken broth cooked down and more liquid was needed). Wow, I love split pea soup, but this is some of the best I ever had.

We made a lot of changes but it was a good start. I don't even like SP soup and this came out great. Someone said to get the meat out before all the flavor was gone - GREAT TIP. Really made a difference. Used Chicken broth instead of water as someone else suggested and soaked the peas all day before cooking (another tip). I also added a bunch of carrots and celery and onion that I sauteed in butter until brown and soft. YUM. My son hated it but he's 12, the rest of the family loved it. Got a request to make it again the next week but now the Easter ham was all gone.

Soak peas overnight changing water. Boil ham bone, place broth in fridge overnight to
skim off fat in morning. Add chunks of ham , shredded carrots , bay leaf, celery,to soup.

Good basic recipe but I think I will have to make some adjustments next time to be really good. I used a smoked ham hock and added 1 tsp. bouillon but I would add more and perhaps some garlic and carrots. I would also increase the water/broth as it was too thick, and I like thick soups! But a good starting point and not bad for my first attempt at split pea soup.
UPDATED: Tried sautéing carrots and celery with the onion, increased the water (about 6 cups) and used 4 tsp. bouillon and it was way more flavorful, with better consistency. Using a 1/2 lb. smoked ham hock and shredding the meat right before serving really helps too. So yummy, thank you!!

I used two ham hocks instead of a ham bone because that's all I could find. I let it simmer for 3 hours... I also added some garlic, carrots, celery and chicken broth like other posters mentioned! It was very delicious and perfect for this cold and rainy day!

been making this soup for many a yr, love to put in slow cooker, ham bone, or 2 small ham hocks, (ham hocks take a while to cool and rid of fat and put the smoky meat back in, but I do it when I have no ham bone, liquid smoke is a cop out, but with added garlic bay leaf carrots onion's, and celery, and low sodium chicken stock, it is a 5 star, thank you all for your reviews (oh a few dashes of hot sauce doesn't hurt either, I leave it out if children are eating it (adults can add as much heat as they want)thank-you for sharing.

I like my pea soup to be savory, not bland, with more flavor, so I always follow my Grandma's recipe: Add a hefty portion of chopped bacon that has been cooked with a chopped onion (and then fat-drained), a bay leaf, carrots, and celery. Sometimes, I'll also some ham bits to the above. Let it all simmer (stirring occasionally). When it's all done, take about half the soup and blend it for a few seconds (with a regular blender or a stick blender) to get a silky texture and prevent "wateriness," then combine that back into the main part of the soup. Be careful not to burn the soup as it's cooking--been there and done that!! It smells like burning leaves and really can't be "rescued"! All the above steps add only a few minutes to the basic recipe. Serve sprinkled with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Out of this world!

Hearty, delicious soup! My husband and I both loved this. I soaked the split peas overnight, and I did add a couple bay leaves and garlic, and added some leftover ham from Thanksgiving along with the ham-bone--but otherwise followed directions. Best pea soup I've had in years!

I'm not a ham fan but my bf begged me to make this.  I opted for smoked ham hocks instead of turkey ham to surprise him.....totally worth it!  I took a reviewers advice and put in my crockpot with a little dry mustard and chicken broth for 6 hours.  Next time would rinse the peas beforehand and soak as helps avoid upset stomachs from the beans/peas.  Might experiment with the spices next time and add a pinch of cayenne.  YUM!

This is so easy and so good!  I often just use a ham hock for flavoring and use veggie broth instead of water. It's definitely a keeper.

I just made split pea soup for the first time as I had a spiral ham bone from dinner. It was delicious! I added carots and celery and added chicken broth with the water and lots of fresh pepper. So easy and yummy! I will definatly make it again.

Love this!  I used the ham bone left from our Honey Baked Easter ham.  I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic with diced red onion.  I put the ham bone, peas, some extra finely chopped ham, about 1 Tbs. ground mustard and 1/2 tsp. of ground pepper in with equal parts water and chicken broth just to cover.  I let simmer on medium heat while covered for just 1.5 hours. I then used an immersion blender to make it silky smooth.  I serve mine with a dollop of sour cream!  Phenomenal!..and I don't even like peas :)

I love split pea soup!  I used the ham bone I'd saved from our Christmas ham and I also added 2 carrots and 1 small diced potato.  It was so delicious, since my husband doesn't like it I had it all to myself and lived on it for days!

I rate this 5 stars using many of the recommendations made in the comments.  I added celery, onion, carrots, garlic and just a bit of potato. I used chicken broth instead of water.  I had a 10oz ham hock on hand and it provided plenty of flavor. I cooked this slower and longer, cooking med-low (3 out of a 10 dial) for 3 hours.  It was a fantastic soup.  I added the potato thinking the soup was a bit thin, but as the soup continued to cook, it was unnecessary and will not need to add in the future. I added parsley and a bit of cream just before serving.  It was exactly what I was looking for on a cool day.

My first time making split pea soup and had to guess at some of the instructions ie how high to cook on and having never used a ham hock didn't realize it was all fat. Had hardly any meat in the soup. Nonetheless, I figured out the heat, a little higher than low heat and next time will buy a chunk of deli ham to cut into pieces and add. Not sure still if the ham  hock is needed for flavoring so not sure if I need to add that too?  Added the carrots, garlic and onion and the flavor was very yummy! Filling , economical soup. Will keep experimenting.

mmmm Yum! It turned out great! I used a big leftover ham bone and boiled it first to get the meat off and used that juice for the soup. No need for salt with my ham. Served with fresh bread, this is such a healthy and low cost meal.

Yummy Yum Yum..I even got my 'we don't like pea soup' family to eat this and they loved it.  I must say due to time constraints I used canned peas and put them in a food processor (2 cans) w/ 1/2 cup of half and half.  I fried some bacon and sauted some veggies (shredded carrots, celery, minced garlic, marjoram, and onions) and chopped ham in the bacon grease. Instead of water I added 1.5 cups of  chicken broth and mixed all the ingredients together and let it simmer on low for about 30 minutes. I also added diced smoked sausage.  I served with  shredded mozarrella on top and crumbled bacon. We loved this.

Simply the best!  I always take the ham bone from Christmas dinner and use it to fix this the week after the holiday.  I double, and sometimes triple it, depending on the size of the ham bone.

I doubled the recipe and prayed it turned out:)  I followed another reviewer and "crock potted" it.  It took a lot longer then expected, 6 hrs on low then close to 2 hrs on high, but, it turned out perfect.  I used olive oil, red onions and added 3 tsp of garlic and 3 tsp of chicken boullion and a bay leaf.  I ended up adding water once during the cooking process and it still turned out really thick, probably could have added even more.  Repeat recipe

The taste was fabulous! But a word of warning- this really does take forever to cook! I was too hungry to wait, and I ate a bowl, but the peas were still a little hard after 2 hours. Patience is key, but it is still a great recipe and very tasty. It freezes well too.

Used Boca burger instead of ham which I cooked and added separately.Also I always add garlic with any beans or peas.  I also needed some hot sauce. Loved the simple recipe. 15 mins in a pressure cooker.

Pretty good soup though I'll probably try a different recipe the next time I want split pea soup.  I cooked my soup in the slow cooker and served it with corn bread.

Very good and very easy.  Only added some chopped carrots for extra veggie intake.  Made a bigger batch than I expected, but now have some in the freezer!  Hubby is a fan of pea soup and loved it!  My 1 year old loved it too!

Great recipe! I can't believe it took me this long to try making Split Pea soup. It is so easy! I didn't add a ham bone but did chop up sliced ham left over from Easter. Didn't make another other adjustments. SO good! My husband LOVES it!

Loved this soup!  So easy to whip up in no time and perfect consistancy, not too thick or thin!  I did add half water and half low sodium chick broth and it was perfect. Did not add extra salt, you get plenty from the ham.  May try it with all water to see how that is next time.  Cooked on med low.  Anything cooking higher than low temp make sure to stir often so it doesn't burn.  Thanks for submitting!  I will be making this often.

I, too, used the crock pot/slow cooker method and replaced the ham hock with six large mesquite smoked chicken drumsticks leftover from a bbq (my husband does not eat pork and I don't keep ham hocks on hand).  Also added about 1 tbsp chopped garlic and about 1 cup of chicken stock (homemade) to the water.  Cooked all on low for about 4-5 hours give or take, stirring once every hour or so to combine and prevent sticking at the bottom of crock.  I then removed the chicken (falling apart!), shredded into a container and poured the pea mixture into another to cool overnight in fridge.  The next day, blended in two batches until mostly smooth.  When reheating, mixed in a couple tablespoons of cream of mushroom soup for extra richness and a smooth, velvety finish.  A true set-and-forget, low maintenance soup that can make even a novice chef (like me) look like a pro!

The BEST recipe for split pea soup and so easy to make! I usually add 1-2 chopped carrots in with the rest for some added color/flavor. This is my go-to SPS recipe and usually cook it 3-4 times a year. DELICIOUS!

This was delicious! I used left over ham rather than the ham bone and over all I used about 7-8 cups of water. My husband loved it! The recipe calls for 4 servings, I say theres about 6. We have enouhgh left overs for the next three days! Thank you!

Very good recipe. My whole family enjoyed it including my 3 yr old. I used half chicken broth and half water. I also soaked the peas overnite. They seemed to disintegrate alot quicker. I used cubed ham on top of whatever I could shave off of the ham bone. I wouldnt recommend using the cubed ham. Seemed spongy to us.

I found this recipe to be very simple and very delicious.  Instead of a ham bone, I used a can of chopped formed ham that came in a gift of Hickory Farms goods that I knew I would not enjoy otherwise and it was perfect for the soup!  I did add a little celery and carrot because I had them on hand, and I used yellow split peas.  My soup turned out excellent- very thick and filling.

Awesome soup. My 9-year old son (who doesn't like anything I cook) LOVED this soup.  We had plenty of letfovers & my son requested the soup almost everyday.  Us adults loved it too.
I added carrots, celery & ham (diced small).  I also added a little more spice to it than what was in the original recipe.  A "stick-to-your-ribs" excellent soup.  Oh yeah...the consistency was also perfect (slightly thicker than most soups) for me.
Highly rated...definitely a keeper.  Thanks!!!

Made this with the hambone left over from easter dinner.  Excellent.  Easy to make.  Inexpensive ingredients.  Hubby ate it for dinner and enough for two lunches.  Will make again.

This was so good! Make sure to check it often, I needed to add more liquid less than an hour into cooking. The soup was also done in less than 2 hours. It was delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  Husband and I ate this wonderful thick, hearty soup like you wouldn't believe.  I was really impressed with the flavor.  Serve it up with warm, crusty sourdough and you have a meal!

Great flavor and easy to make. I added 1/2 tsp minced garlic, a packet of chicken broth seasoning and thyme to taste. It turned out wonderful and I'll be making this one again!

I added carrots and a couple bay leaves. I also used vegetable stock for part of the water. Yum! I did not add salt because the ham was plenty salty for the flavor.

The best plinth pea soup I ever made in my 55 years of marriage. I used a crockpot and filled it with chicken broth, onion, carrots and a big ham bone and s raps of ham. It was done in 5 hours. It was so delicious. Angie

The only change I made was to use my own home made chicken soup.  The finished product was fabulous.  I froze a few servings and defrosted some as needed.  It was even better.  I remember this soup from when I was a child and I think it's even better than I remember.

This was really good!  Both my husband and I loved it.  I made it in an Instant Pot instead.  I pushed the "saute" button and then sauteed the onion in oil.  I added 2 cloves minced garlic and sauteed until fragrant (only about a minute) and then added all the rest of the ingredients (chicken broth instead of water and 2 bay leaves) and cooked it on the bean/chili setting for 20 min.  It was really really good!

I it was easy, a little bland and I like it a little thicker so I threw in a little of the soup and about 1/2 cup of some leftover scalloped potatoes in a blender to purée it then I added it back to the soup.  Still needed to season a little more but overall, I liked it and will make it again.

Will definitely keep making this. Needs adjusting thruout, I found ham concentrate to add great flavor especially while adding water to get the right consistency.

I'm all for simple.I also have a suspicion that 'TEETOE' is from the South and grew up or had parents that did or came from the Depression era where you made wonderful meals from what you had on hand.My elders did and I prepare and cook accordingly.I can make 8 meals out of a ham.Always leave meat on the bone.My Mom taught me like her Mom did and I'm almost 58.This recipe is one we've used and I agree with some of the comments.It is basic and wholesome.It's Pea soup.It's supposed to taste that way.Not carrots or potatoes or whatever.Don't be critical.Submit your own version if you don't like hers.

First time ever making Pea Soup.  The ham bone I had still had a lot of meat on it so I doubled the recipe.  It was delicious.   Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

Well, i did not boil like the recipe suggested. I used a slow cooker and replace the ham with turkey bacon ????. It came out perfect! I also didn't add the onions (i forgot). Love this soup. Definitely making it again.

This is delicious!  I didn't have a ham bone so I used chicken stock and chopped up leftover ham. This is so yummy!

A great easy recipe. I served the soup with hot sauce on the side to give some zip to an otherwise 2 dimensional dish.

Soak beans in water overnight, for best results.
When soup "foams up", drain & rinse well in  colander.  You will have to do this a couple of times.  My Grandmother said this was the GAS in the beans.  
When soup boils with a little or no foam, simmer.
After soup simmers 1 1/2 hrs. :   Added   Salt & pepper to taste then add 1 cup cubed ham,  2 cloves minced fresh garlic, 1 cup diced carrots ,  1  cup onion and 1 cup celery.  Cook about 1 more hr. Or until desired texture.  
  Orig. recipe is a good base but you need to add more "flavor"
Thank you for this basic recipe.
     (By the way, if you have Hard Water, soak & cook beans in Purchased Water  (or Bottled Water).  You can add 1/8  teaspoon of Baking Soda to Hard Waters, but I usually just buy  water, works every time.  Do not use hard water on any dried Beans.)

Didn't sauté anything. Threw it all together in a Dutch oven, added a bay leaf, herbs, dry mustard and garlic. Used chicken broth in place of water, simmered for two hours, perfect. A very versatile recipe.

VERY GOOD.
Do not need to add salt and pepper.  
If using the biggest pot, could use 2 pounds of split peas 
and 2 ham bone.

A few years ago my husband suggested I make soup using a leftover hambone, I had no clue how so looked online and found this recipe, I'm SO glad I did! I followed the recipe to a T, didn't add anything different, didn't change a single thing and it was PERFECT! We all thoroughly enjoyed this soup (even my finicky mother-in-law had to admit it was delicious!) I've since made it quite a few times and always with great results, the only time my husband complained was when I thought to add carrots, his response was "it's pea soup not vegetable soup!" So if you're looking for a tasty way to use a leftover hambone this is the recipe for you

Extremely simple and everyone loved it. No soaking of peas at all...just cooked up the onion with some garlic, added the Easter ham  bone with some extra ham, used beef broth and water to cover the boneThen added carrots and celery. No salt either. Cooked on low and occasionally stirred for about 2 hours. We all agreed it was the best soup. Would even rock without the added veggies.

I been making pea soup for years for everyone to enjoy    Personally I don't eat  the soup. 
I think this time ( as I was told ) was the best I have ever made. As in all my recipes I do as I wish I used bacon fat sautéed up onions and carrots left on side to add later to soup . I cooked down the dry peas added ham chunks with ham bone and more bacon fat  till peas are cooked down then puréed the peas after removing the ham made a little rue to thick it up  then added the onions and carrots
 my husband enjoyed it very much

I didn't soak the peas, I put them straight into a crock pot along with a Honey Baked Ham Bone, reduced sodium chicken stock, onion, celery, carrots, a bit of garlic and pepper.  I didn't add salt since most said the ham bone took care of that and they were right.  I also added a bay leaf.  Not great changes, but it added to the flavor and if I don't have to soak or sauté then it makes it that much easier.

Did jazz it up a little by adding 2 cloves of garlic to the onion and making stock from the ham bone to use instead of water.  Also added a little less than a pound of chopped ham, 1/2t pepper, 1/4t each of marojam and thyme, and a bay leaf.  Took less than 2 hours for the peas to cook down.  Really good and filling.

Good start.  I brown a couple slices of chopped up bacon, then cook onion, a couple cloves of minced garlic and a chopped carrot in the bacon grease.  I put this in the crock pot with the smallest shank-end ham I can find (but I love the idea of using a honey-baked ham bone.. I'll definitely try that) along with 2 outer leaves of a head of romaine lettuce, and about a teaspoon of ground black pepper.  I let it cook in the crock pot on high for about 4-6 hrs, remove the ham and use my stick blender to smooth it all out.  I cut up any ham left on the bone and put it back in the soup after blending, taste for salt and pepper and it's ready to eat with some crusty sour dough bread!

I love how rustic this was. Full of flavor! Added some cooked ham after the soup was finished simmering. Would not change a thing otherwise. There is something to be said for simplicity.

This was a good starter recipe. I did add carrots and celery. Hubby loved him.
Since I am a vegan for myself I didn't add oil.I just cook split peas, carrots, celery, onions added quinoa and black beans leftovers. It also tasted good. Will make more.

Good, but it took a lot longer than 2 hours for me to get it down to a green liquid.  I did soak the beans overnight since there doesn't seem to be a consensus on that.  I cooked it for about 4 hours, and some of the peas were soft but were still identifiable as peas.  Everything else was exactly as the recipe states.

Good-to-great recipe. As with nearly all my soups and chowders, I use the pot in pot method with a pressure cooker to reduce cooking time to 20 minutes under pressure with no need to soak split peas. Using a pressure cooker, this soup can be fully prepared and ready to eat in under an hour and have that "next day" flavor.

Substitute chicken broth for water for a flavor enhancement. Depending on the size of your pressure cooker, you may need to add liquid after cooking to achieve desired consistency as just covering the ingredients with whatever liquid you use (per the recipe) will leave the soup VERY thick and pasty. Honey baked ham is by far the best ham to use in this recipe.

I've made this soup from my french Canadian Grandmother's recipe for 40 years delicious and so easy. With the ham bone and onions I also add garlic and chopped celery, when the peas are  almost done I add whole carrots then break them up with a fork when tender, besides adding colour and flavour it adds nutrition. Just as good with either yellow or green peas.

I made very minor changes to the recipe... I reduced the amount of onion (not a big fan of 'em), made a mirepoix which I sauteed with butter in my crock pot over the stove.  I threw in leftover chunked ham (didn't save the bone), and quickly browned with the mirepoix before taking off the stove and adding the peas.  I used 2 cans reduced sodium/fat chicken broth, and the rest water.  The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 4 is because the recipe is a bit bland even though I added minor flavor enhancing tricks. I ended up adding a bit of marjoram and hot sauce toward the end for more flavor.

I forgot to throw the onions in (duh) but this still turned out very nice. I didn't need to add salt, only pepper once it was in my bowl. Thank you for this wonderful, simple recipe!

My Husband and I loved this recipe, the kids didn't care for it though.  I did add carrots, some garlic, and a bit of worcestershire and it was very good.  I'd hold off on the salt next time.

This was certainly easy to make and it filled me up but it wasn't extraordinary as some reviewers claim.  Maybe if I had jazzed it up with garlic, chix broth, etc., like some suggested I might have had more of a "wow" experience.

A VERY simple and yummy pea soup.  It took about 2 hours for me, but I should have left a little more liquid in the pot, this soup is THICK!
I did add 1 carrot and 1 rib of celery.  A dash of salt and about 1 tsp of pepper.  I also threw in a tsp of hot pepper sauce, I can always add more later.  Then I used the hand mixer ( after taking out all the chunks of ham and bone.) Then threw back in some chunks of the ham.  VERY delish!
Thanks!
