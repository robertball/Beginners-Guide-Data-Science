This recipe turned out delicious! I am not one for thick belgian waffles, and these thinner Scandinavian waffles are a better, healthier alternative. I did not have any vanilla sugar, so I simply substituted vanilla extract. Definitely keeping this one in mind for future breakfasts!

Worked excellent on our George Foreman grille (with waffle attachments). I used the vanilla extract as I had no vanilla sugar. Also added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to 2% milk to make buttermilk. If I can pull this off anybody can, I am the furthest thing from a master in the kitchen.

So glad I tried this recipe. I had a good waffle recipe and thought, "A waffle is just a waffle." Boy, was I wrong! I will forever put cardamom in my waffle batter. Thanks, ScandoGirl!

This is a great recipe. The added steps of beating the yolks and whites separately results in supremely fluffy waffles. Totally worth the effort!

I doubled the recipe in hopes of some left-overs; however, there were none!  Even my health conscious husband couldn't resist coming back for seconds and commented on how 'really good' they were.  They exceeded our expectations.  I would make them again, but add a little more cardamom.

These waffles were incredible! Easily the best homemade waffles I have ever had. They're very light and fluffy and the little bit of spice makes them heavenly and unique. The only thing I changed was using vanilla extract instead of vanilla sugar because it was all I had and it seemed to work perfectly.

Slightly sweet and perfect for no syrup mornings! I left out the cardamom since I was making them for my toddler.

Tasted like a waffle cone and didn't have that slight salty baking soda sour kind of taste that perfectly pairs opposite sweet syrup so no, did not like it. Followed the recipe exactly.

Good!  Only made three waffles though, so unless there only three of you...  Also could try doubling the recipe.

Not sure where I went wrong but it seemed like there was too much flour which made the waffle a bit drier and almost gritty. Will try this recipe again with small tweaks

These are delicious! My only change was to use gluten free flour, I had the vanilla sugar and even a heart shaped waffle iron. I will be making these again.

Amazing flavor, you don’t won’t want to ruin the flavor with syrup. Takes much long to cook than normal waffles, but they come out super moist like a decadent cake inside.

I'm rating this 5 stars, even though I didn't make it as written, because I followed the recipe exactly, merely swapping some ingredients in order to make the recipe fit our dietary needs. I used a GF blend of flour instead of all-purpose, soured coconut milk instead of buttermilk, and coconut sugar instead of white sugar. Fantastic waffles! Worth the time and effort.

Made exactly according to recipe and offered our guests the traditional maple syrup, whipped cream (here in Finland it is traditional, go figure), or Citrus Wild Blueberry Sauce from this site as toppings.  This was our brunch last Sunday and we gobbled these babies up.  Wonderful.  Fluffy while thin, the cardamom becomes a slight hint of flavor after a few bites (with that I mean that it is not overwhelming as it can get in some Northern desserts like bullar) and just great.  I would only like to mention that I had to double this recipe to feed four people.  one child had two of these, and the  three adults had three whole waffles each -that is 12 hearts per person,the whole thing as it comes off the iron- because well, yes, they are as thin as thick pancakes.  For those wondering how to measure 1/3 cup into your iron: a regular soup ladle full is just about the right size :)  Thank you for the recipe, we all loved it.

These waffles tasted delicious! I followed recipe exactly, except vanilla extract instead of vanilla sugar, and used an All-Clad brand waffle maker on setting 3. They were perfect!

Super delicious and yummy!!!!!!! Been looking for a waffle recipe for a while now. It is now my go to waffle recipe. Instead of buttermilk I used 2% milk, and also used vanilla extract in place of vanilla sugar; because I didn't have either of these in my kitchen. It still turned out very nice! Thank you ScandoGirl!

I love this recipe! I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted plain lowfat yogurt and a little milk, and it seemed to have worked great! Next time I'll try it with less sugar...
