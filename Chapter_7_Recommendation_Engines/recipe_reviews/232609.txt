This cheesecake does not have the density or texture of a traditional cheesecake, but, it does have a nice combination of flavors. It was a nice finish to our families holiday BBQ.
I would suggest doubling the crumb crust ingredients if you want the crust to cover the sides of the cake. I used an 8-1/2" spring form pan, and the crust mixture covered only the bottom and a 1/4" up the sides. Personally, I found this to be just the right amount of crust. I will make this desert again.

Not a real cheesecake in the true sense of the word but a delicious dessert non the less. I reduced the sugar in the cheese mix because we are trying to reduce and it was sweet enough.

Wonderful.  I made extra crust to sprinkle over the top.  It was actually great even without pineapple topping.  Next time I will slice bananas before serving

This recipe is so good!! The only thing I changed (and that is only because i like a generous crust) was double the ingrEdients of the crust and added a few specs of yellow food color to teh pineapple mixture to look more golden as the canned pineapple I was working with was a bit white. It came out awesome for my "Girls Night" and was gone very very quickly...

I'm generally skeptical of no-bake cheesecakes, but this one was really good. I did use whipped cream instead of the whipped topping (whipped topping is an abomination!) and the texture was perfect. I think next time I will add some rum to the pineapple topping.

Delicious! It has a very light texture and really tastes like a pina colada. The crust is the best part. Be sure to toast the coconut (I toasted mine in a frying pan on the stove over low heat). My family loved this cheesecake. I'll be making it again for sure!

This was one of the best no-bake cheesecake I have ever tried.  The flavors go so great together.  I made it exactly as written, and it was perfect.  Great recipe!  I will definitely make again!

Next time, I would leave out the whipped dairy topping or at least cut it in half.  I agree that the crust needs doubled to have enough.

this cheesecake was so easy to make and a huge hit at my co-workers luau themed retirement party!! The only part I personally wasn't crazy about was the pineapple topping but that's just personal preference. I would definitely make this again
