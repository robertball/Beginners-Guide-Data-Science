Very easy to make, super tasty, super cute! Fun project for the holidays with the kids! Any kind of stick will work... popsicle, lollypop, or just a wooden skewer. (Remove tips for children) 
Save your kids Halloween candy for lots of options on how to decorate the little guys! I made no changes! Great recipe and idea! Thank you!
