Because I'm watching my calorie intake, I used fat free evaporated milk (for the same creamy texture but with half the fat) and Truvia sweetener. This was pretty good. NOTE: I have a Keurig machine. What I did was pour the evaporated milk, Truvia and pumpkin pie spice into the bottom of the coffee cup, then just brewed the coffee over the ingredients in the cup. No need to microwave.

I thought this tasted okay. I followed the recipe exactly too, using full fat half and half and regular sugar. The end result, was it was just kind of watered down tasting. I think pumpkin latte made with espresso and steamed milk and then topped with whipped cream is just so much better. Also, unless your microwave is super powerful or you use blazing hot coffee, there is no way this will be a hot cup of coffee in 15 seconds. It should take closer to a minute, with my microwave anyhow.

Picked up a Fancy-Shmancy Pumpkin Latte last week at a Coffee Shop.  I had a craving the following morning and happened upon this recipe. Very comparable and so good!  I have tried this recipe with the flavored creamers, such as Sugar-free Hazelnut, Sugar-free Vanilla, thus eliminating the need for the sugar in this superb latte. Also, the flavored creamers give it an extra touch of richness.

I found this recipe and instantly thought how perfect it would be to make for my fiancée. He is a coffee addict. I also thought that I might like to try it too. I love anything pumpkin and am always looking for the next pumpkin recipe. However, I am do not like coffee so this recipe for me was kind of a disappointment. I followed the measurements that were listed for the half and half, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice; however, it was hard to taste anything over the strong coffee taste. I would suggest doubling the measurements just to have it taste more like pumpkin and to be sweeter. I used my keurig coffee brewer for this recipe. I believe that it was way easier. I just mixed the ingredients in one cup and then brewed the coffee right into that cup. Also, I used regular whipped cream in a tub than in a can. I have always that whipped cream from a can tastes funny. To me, the best part was to add a huge heaping spoon full of whipped cream to my latte. My fiancée gave his approval for this recipe and thought that it was absolutely delicious. I guess it just depends on how much you like coffee.

I made my own pumpkin spice & used 1 tsp. I added it in with the coffee and used a french press ( I do 5 minutes, steep it longer for stronger coffee).  I shake my organic whole milk in the carton (really really shake it) and it pours super thick and foamy. I'm going to make myself a second cup right now. Thanks for saving me tons of money!! Almost spent $7 while I was out earlier.

This recipe will satisfy a craving for a pumpkin spice latte but it definitely isn't as good as an actual one. I would double the pumpkin spice because the coffee overpowers it. Definitely a good recipe for a Keurig coffee maker.

Just okay. Not even close to a coffee shop pumpkin latte.

this tasted decent



Substitute 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg for the pumpkin pie spice

This was okay. I might try it again if I don't have any flavored creamer. I think it might be better to put the pumpkin pie spice in with the grounds and then brew the coffee. I tried another recipe that way, and I really liked it.

This is exactly how I fix my morning coffee (minus the pumpkin pie spice) using stevia to equal the sugar amount, so I knew I would like the basic recipe. The pumpkin pie spice does give this coffee a little flavor, but the downside is that the spices all collect in the bottom of the cup, making it impossible to drink down to the last drop. It is easy though, as the title of the recipe suggests.

This was a really quick and easy drink to make! It tasted relatively okay, but my only issue was that it tasted a little watery. So to fix that, I added just a little hazelnut coffee creamer and that helped improve the flavor a lot!

I used Monk Fruit sweetener to make it sugar free, and added a splash of vanilla.  The only negative was that the spices do not dissolve and my last few sips were gritty.  Other than that, it was a nice treat!
