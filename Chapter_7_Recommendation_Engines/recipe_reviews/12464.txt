I've been making pie crusts for many years now and this is the best ever.  It was tender and flaky as a pie crust should be, without being completely tasteless like other recipes I've tried.  I needed to use quite a bit more water than was called for, though, and I increased the amount of butter instead of using shortening.  I'm deleting all my other pie crust recipes today.

I made some modifications to the recipe as I doubled it.  Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar.  I used margarine and eliminated the need to add salt.  Everyone indicated that there was too much liquid.  I used 5 tablespoons of water to 2 beaten eggs.  My crust was delicious, flaky and now is going to be the one I use for my pies and tarts from now on.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a really good pastry recipe, quick easy and tastes great, not too dry!  A great use for it is with Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie (also on the site).

Great Buttery Crust! I used this for a pie.  It takes pretty long to cook the bottom part of the crust & also - you HAVE to blind bake this or it will shrivel up like crazy.....learned that the hard way haha.  No need for baking spray on your pan, there is tons of butter in here that will stop this crust from sticking.

I really like this pastry pie crust. You need to put what temp. to bake the pastry pie crust. `425 at 15min. Most bakers are beginners and this is not fair to them. Just saying. Do not forget to chill. I put this in my freezer for spur of the moment ideals. Personal Chef Tena

It was easy to make, and easy to roll out; it didn't crack at all! It was just perfect! Very unique crust.

Yummy!!! I used this recipe to make chocolate turnovers and the slightly sweet flavor was the perfect compliment to the chocolate.  They were a huge hit.

I made this recipe with a lemon meringue pie and the result was quite nice.  The flavour was great, however I found it was a little too hard.  I noticed a few guests had problems cutting into it with their spoons.  Maybe next time I wouldn't refrigerate it for so long.  Even so, this was a great recipe.

A good recipe.  Could cut the salt a bit.  Didn't come out as flaky with margarine.  More 'pastry'ish than 'cookie'ish

This is an excellent simple sweet pastry.  I use it for lots of berry pies, but it's divine for AR's Strawberry Pie.

Great recipe. Wasn't sure about the vanilla, had never heard of it in pie crust before, but it was fine. This rolled out nicely between wax paper.  I made it into 4 large cherry-filled turnovers, baked at 425 for 35 min. Golden, beautiful, sweet enough, flaky! Went well with the cherry.  Thanks!

absolutly scrummy , light flakey and salt was perfect for the overly sweet filling , but you could cut it a bit for a less sweet filling ( banoffee pie was what i made  ) have also used it for pecan and maple pie and key lime perfect every time

I used this recipe for mince pies, and everyone loved it.  The pies didn't fall apart, nor have soggy bottoms!  I'll definitely try it out on a full-sized pie with confidence.

Simple recipe and worked perfectly. A good amount for the tin size. My tip is to roll it out on cling film. Sweet crust can be quite delicate so this helps to pick it up and lay it in the tin and then gently peel off. I'm just about to make this again for a pumpkin pie (Libby's) but would be great for any type of pudding pie.
Also, leave the edges having over the tin. I trim them once it's cooked. There's no shrinkage then and you end up with a really neat edge.

Great crust.  Used powdered sugar in place of granulated, a little less than the teaspoon of salt, and 3/4 cups unsalted butter in place of the 1/2 cup butter-1/4 shortening.  My strawberry pie needed a precooked crust so baked, as indicated by Chef Tena, at 425 for almost 15 minutes before cooling and adding the filling.  Wonderful flavor.  Had a pretty tough time rolling out and almost gave in to the  desire to simply press it into the pie pan.  Persevered, however, and in the end got it almost in one piece into the pan.  Flaky with just the right amount of sweetness.  With practice, feel sure this will become our favorite sweet pie crust.

This was perfect for a (very tart) lemon curd tart, it added a little extra sweetness. I made it without alteration, it was cooked all the way through, and I’ll absolutely use the recipe again. Thank you!

I love this crust. I use it for pumpkin pie crust now, which makes for a really good and unexpected combination. I actually don't even roll the dough out, but just press it into my cast iron pan.
