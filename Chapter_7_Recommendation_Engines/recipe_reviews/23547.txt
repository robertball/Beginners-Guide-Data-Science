All I could really taste in this dish was the cheese.  I will not make again, it was heavy and rather unimpressive.  The dish did poof up nicely while cooking and looked impressive, but other than that, I didn't find much to recommend it.

Yum; loved this Raquel! Based on what I had in the house, I had to make a couple of changes. I made mock sour cream by running fat free cottage cheese and lemon juice thru the food processor and because I'm not a huge processed cheese fan, I decided on parm instead. Also added some seasonings, sprinkled more cheese on top along with a bit of paprika for color. Thanks so much!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I made for Christmas dinner and everyone liked it.  It was fairly quick and easy and actually I made it ahead and put in fridge, then baked right before dinner.  I used Velveeta cheese and put a little grated Cheddar on top.  I omitted the green onion and used a little onion powder because my family don't all like green onions.  Excellent recipe!

Potatoes Romanoff have been a family staple at holiday meals for years. The potatoes need to be boiled then cooled then grated - skin on (so use left over boiled potatoes or boil the day before). Grating instead of mashing gives it a fluffier texture and makes it less dense.   Also, switch it up by adding grated aged cheddar or Gruyere. However, cubing processed cheese does this tasty dish a huge disservice because the cheese won't evenly melt throughout the dish.  Finally, I'm making it tomorrow for Cdn Thanksgiving. I'm going to add some crumbled blue cheese in with the sour cream to give the dish some extra zing!

This is not traditional Potatoes Romanoff and please skip the "imatation cheese" (aka Velveeta) for some high quality cheddar and leave the potatoes a bit lumpy.  It won't poof as much, but will add texture.

This was an after thought for a dinner party we had, now it's all anyone wants us to make!!!  I added Garlic salt, and we left the skins in.  I also melted the cheese in the Microwave first.

Wow! Wow! Wow! These are good potatoes! Too good. I ate way too much of it. I scaled the recipe for 6 servings and it was a good sized dish still. I thought I had Velveeta in the fridge, but had only a little bit of it, so I used mostly grated cheddar. I think it would have been too gooey with all Velveeta. I also didn't have any green onions, so I just sprinkled a bit of garlic powder into the mixture. Soooo good!

Great recipe.  Made it with light sour cream and light velveeta instead of regular.  Took the left overs and made a great potato soup the next night by mashing up the potatoes a little bit and adding a little chicken broth and some skim milk. May 14 update: In my orginal review I left out that I cubed the potatoes instead of mashing them.  When I made the soup that is when mashed them slightly.

Awesome!  If you are a fan of potatoes and cheese, this is your recipe.  I was impressed because the sour cream with the cheddar cheese(once baked) is a great consistency--it makes the recipe.  This time I used Kraft cheddar cheese, which was excellent, but next time I will try experimenting with other cheeses.

I made this recipe for the first time last night. (Feb14/08) I scaled the recipe in half as to not waste a lot if my family did not like.  Boy, was I wrong.  They ate it up and asked for more.  I will be making it as a side tonight as well!
The only things I did different were to use cooking onions as I ran out of green onions and added garlic.(as I do most recipes!) I scaled down the cheese just a bit but could of used more as recipe calls for.  It was delicious!!
A keeper for sure in this corner!

These were pretty good.  I added some onion and garlic powder for some flavor, also added some colby jack cheese in and on top the last 15 minutes.  Will make again.  Thanks

The first time I made this it was good but felt it needed to be spiced up a bit for our taste.  I used this recipe as a base and added some potato toppers and a little garlic powder, this gave it the added flavor we were looking for.

DH and I loved this and I will definitely make it again.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and now we have some yummy leftovers!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any trouble with the little cubes of Velveeta melting, however, I did mix it into the hot potatoes and mashed the cheese along with the potatoes - just excellent!

I made these with real cheddar cheese and added a little salt to compensate since processed cheese is saltier.  I also added some bacon bits.  Will make again!

This was a good recipe.  I halved it because we didn't need as much.  Next time I would use shredded cheese instead, otherwise the cheese doesn't melt all the way.

Very good, although I would make a few changes.  I would use 2/3 of a pound of cheese instead of a pound and I would grate the cheese.

I made this as an experiment.  My wife needs to provide a side dish in a few days and this was an attempt at something new.

Positives: 

Very easy to make.  Period.  My wife felt it was entirely adequate.  It would work wonderfully "as is."

Biggest positive is that it is endlessly modifiable.  One can add garlic, or ginger or use "real" sharp cheese.  You can go Indian by adding curry powder.  You can add ham or bacon bits!  There is o end to the possibilities here.

Negatives:

Mine was bland, even though I added salt and pepper.  We felt it needed some "snap."  Next time I make it, and make it I will, I'll add some white vinegar to the the sour cream mixture, more pepper and use extra sharp cheddar cheese.  The time after that . . . who knows what I'll add?  

I love this recipe precisely because it can be modified in endless ways!

Have made this many many times.  Always goes over well.  I usually use an 8 ounce block of extra sharp cheddar cheese, which I grate fresh.  Use most of it while smashing the potatoes, add the reserved amount on top prior to baking.   I probably also only use about 3/4 pint of sour cream.  I'll use fine diced onion or shallot if I don't have green onions.  Top with some paprika and/or parsley for color.   It's potatoes, onions and cheese... with some butter and sour cream... even I can't mess that up!   Good recipe, thanks for posting it.

I tried this recipe specifically to use up processed cheese, which I'm not fond of. I made it exactly to recipe except that I scaled it to 4 servings. My husband loved this! Mine did puff up and had fluffy, creamy texture with a thin browned skin on top. I will definitely make this again, but I hope it works equally well with real cheese.

This is a good and easy recipe. I had to give it 4 stars though, because I thought there was little taste despite the onions and cheese, needs a little salt/pepper or any spice you would prefer and it is all good. I did not use processed cheese however and cubed up some Colby and Jack instead. I also thought it tasted better when eating leftovers a couple days later. Next time, I think I will throw some peppers in it as well.

Absolutely delicious! It's twice-baked potatoes without the hassle of the peels! This was an easy potato side dish I'm sure to make again and again.
