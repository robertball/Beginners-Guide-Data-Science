I tried this last night with leftover turkey. For the vegetables I cooked some fresh carrots & opened a can of greenbeans. I followed the recipe exactly and my family liked it a lot. The only thing I would do differently next time it to make more stuffing for the top. The topping was pretty skimpy and next time I will double the amount. I think it would also be good with the addition of a little tarragon. It was quick and easy and a comforting meal for a cool evening.

This recipe is PERFECT for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. My family doesn't eat the dark meat so I put it in this casserole and it was gone in one sitting! I will def make it again, and again, and again!

Yummy! I used cream of chicken and cream of potato and skipped the cream of celery. For veggies I used corn, peas and cut green beans. We liked it very much!

I tried this last night and it was huge hit.  Only thing different than listed about was I used leftover stuffing, doubled the pepper and added about 2 teaspoons of garlic salt. Had enough for a couple of dinners.  For Veggies I used zucchini (sliced) , mushrooms, 1/4 onion, left over green beans and carrots (sliced).

Yummy and versatile. I used cans of mixed veggies and whatever creamed soup I had on hand. I didn't have much turkey so I added a can of chicken breast. Superb, the whole family gobbled it down!

This is a great quick and easy meal to make.  I liked it but I found it to be a bit on the bland side.  just season to your own taste and this is a quick fix hit

This was pretty good,but I have a small family so there was about half leftover. In a few days I removed  most of the stuffing from the top and put the soup and veggie mix in a soup pot, added about 3 cups of chicken stock, brought to a soft boil then added back some of the stuffing for thickener and had a wonderful soup. This was a bigger hit than the original dish.

I don't know what happened. I made it exactly as written but it ended up so runny it was like soup with crunchy topping. I salvaged supper by making some egg noodles to serve it over. I gave 3 stars because even tho it was soupy it still had a nice flavor to it.
