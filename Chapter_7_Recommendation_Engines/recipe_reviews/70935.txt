4/29/07-I made this again last night & made some alterations to the recipe...and it was FABULOUS!  It is now a 5 star recipe for us.  With the changes I made it now tastes like authentic carne asada.  My husband & our friend were raving about it.  I decreased the amount of soy sauce to 1/3 cup & used half reg/half low sodium.  I decreased the vinegar to 1/4 cup.  I omitted the lime juice & instead used 1/3 cup low acid orange juice & the juice from half a lg lemon.  I decreased the oil to  1/3 cup (half olive, half vegetable).  I used flap meat.  

Original review from 3/07:  This is a great marinade.  The reason I only gave it four stars is because this did not taste like "authentic" carne asada.  We live in San Diego Co, 10 mi. north of the Tijuana border & regularly travel deep into Baja.  We've also lived in AZ just a few mi. from the MX border.  We've never had carne asada that tasted like this.  We'll keep looking for that perfect carne asada recipe.  I used half low sodium soy sauce, and half regular soy sauce, and I decreased the salt just a bit.  The level of saltiness came out just right.  I also increased the recipe to serve 24 people (plus added an additional pound of meat to that) for a party of 15 adults (13 were Marines)& there were no leftovers.  I used flap steak (from Costco)...very tender, & although it was really marbled, there were no chunks of fat in it.

This recipe is very very good. I have a couple tips though. First, follow the recipe EXACT. Don't substitute; it won't turn out the same. Next, put the marinade in the blender & blend for a couple of minutes, believe it or not, this makes a difference. Finally, if you can, marinate overnight. Along with the blending, this gives the ingredients time to sit & really get into the meat. I've made this lots & lots of times & there are never left overs.

Growing up in a Latino family I had always been very particular with which authentic recipes I wanted to keep.  However I could never get over my love for the restaurant style taste of Carne Asada.  I searched high and low and finally I fell upon this recipe.  I LOVE THIS MARINADE!!!  The meat tastes so delicious.  If you're looking to imitate the zingy tasting Mexican Restaurant Style Carne Asada,...this is the recipe!

This is a recipe that I tried about 9 months ago and have been making it once per week ever since.  Everyone who tries this LOVES it!  However, I have tweaked it a little to suit our tastes.  I follow the directions exactly on the marinade---it is fantastic---but I do not use flank steak.  I buy what is called "flap meat" here at my local Costco (Southern CA) which is basically a tri tip roast sliced lengthwise about 1/2 inch thick.  It is thinner and more tender than flank steak and seems to "absorb" more of the flavor of the marinade.  Then we grill the meat for about 5 minutes per side (instead of pan frying)and chop it up after it is cooked.  My only other changes are that I serve these on warm FLOUR tortillas, and we always include fresh guacamole---this may not be "authentic", but this is how my family likes them.  These are just the BEST tacos ever!

11/07/06:  UPDATE: THESE ARE WONDERFUL MADE IN THE CROCKPOT!!!!  

 Update:  Have made this recipe at least four times since I have first posted.  The onion relish is superb! ** I wish more stars were visible!!!  THIS IS DELICIOUS!!!!!  and I'm only talking about the marinade!  Next time I will make everything for the true taste experience, but when my kids are sneaking into the kitchen to steal slices of the meat before dinner, I know I have a winner!  I used flat cut brisket because it was on sale, but next time I'll use flank steak as directed or flap meat or carne asada meat as others have suggested because it was pretty chewy.  But no matter, because it was just heavenly! Next time I will also slice the meat into thinner slices because I had to re-cut every slice after it was cooked.  I also boiled the remaining marinade in the grill pan I used and poured it over the meat in a bowl before I placed the meat on the tortillas. I served it with homemade refried beans, and this is a new family favorite.  Thank you, thank you for such a delish recipe!
4/6/06: Had to add---make this on a night that you plan to clean your stovetop because it splatters!

This had good flavor, but wasn't at all authentic, in my opinion.  In Houston, the Mexican population is vast (TONS of Mexican restaurants), but I have never tasted meat like this (I think it had to do with having soy sauce as the base for the marinade).  The meat was a bit chewy as well (I used flank steak, and marinated it overnight).  I would suggest leaving the meat whole while cooking, lowering the heat some, then slicing it afterward.  The "relish" really needed a chopped tomato (which it then becomes "pico de gallo," a 'must' with these types of tacos).  The pureed salsa was great, however!  As a side note, cotija cheese is often labeled as "Queso Fresco" in the stores.  Thanks for the recipe - I'm going to keep looking though.

Classic, true tacos.  This may look like alot but actually it's really easy to prepare.  The one thing I do to make things easier is freeze the beef for 30 minutes, slice thin, then marinate.  By doing this you only need to marinate for 30-60 minutes and every last morsel of meat gets flavor.

This is all about the marinade!  It is wonderful.  Be sure to bring your meat and marinade to room temperature before cooking.  Makes a delicious difference!

While tasty, the meat did not taste anything like authentic taqueria meat.  I used flap meat as others suggested, and I was pleased with the results. The onion relish everyone is raving about was just onions and cilantro with a squirt of lime juice.  Certainly nothing spectacular.  I made the salsa as directed, except I threw in a couple of big tomatillas.  They were on sale for 67 cents a pound.  The salsa was good, but it tasted a lot like commercial bottled salsa. All in all, this was way too much work for such mediocre results.  I won't make it again.  Anyone who lives in the southwest and has access to the real thing will not be impressed.

Muy Bueno! These were absolutely delicious. I used reviewer Kris L.'s suggestions and substituted the flank steak with Flap meat from Costco. I am glad that I did because it was so much more tender than flank steak. I grilled the meat to medium rare and sliced it super thin against the grain. Thank you, Kris L. for the suggestion! I loved the sauce-it tasted so good on the meat and was a nice change from the usual salsa. I also added guacamole-can't have carne asada without guacamole :)! I can't wait to make this again. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I liked this recipe. I marinated the meat for 1HR. When I make the onion relish, I place the chopped onion in a small bowl and squeeze 1 lemon, letting the onion "absorb" the lemon; stir, then add cilantro. After the meat is cooked, I use a strainer to get rid of any leftover marinated mixture or else it'll make the tortillas soggy and no one wants a soggy taco. I've also used this recipe to marinate chicken. It was good. 

As for the salsa, it was OK. Not my favorite. I prefer my salsa to be very spicy. I'm Mexican. I've been eating salsa since I was a child, so maybe only very spicy salsa does it for me now. Lol

Let me start by saying that my husband's family is 100% Mexican.  They bbq carne asada on a regular basis.  My hubby and I decided to throw our first carne asada bbq at our home.  I was afraid of how they would rate my cooking but I took a chance with this recipe anyways.  I have to be honest and say that I did not measure the ingredients exactly I just sort of eyebald it.  I marinated the meat in a big plastic punch bowl overnight (I had 12lbs of meat). My hubby grilled the meat outdoors on our bbq grill and warmed the tortillas over the open flame as well.  We grilled green chiles, green onions, nopales (cactus) and made Mexican rice, frijoles de la hoya and three different types of salsas (not the one on the recipe).  I did make the onion relish though I did not follow the recipe exactly since its relatively simple to make.  I also made guacamole to serve with the carne asada.  Everyone was fascinated by the flavor and asked for the recipe.  My mother in law said I should marinate the meat for all thier bbq's from now on.

I did a lot of research, and no matter how good your marinade is, you have to know how to cook the meat properly to get a good carne asada taste. That being said, the marinade of this recipe is good, the necessities being tomato, lime, cilantro, jalepiño, salt and pepper. You don't really need the other stuff.
HERE IS HOW TO COOK CARNE ASADA:
1. Make sure the steak is really thin before you cook it (My grocery store puts a "Carne Asada" sticker on their skirt steak which is helpful).
2. OMIT THE SALTS FROM THE MARINADE.After it is done marinating, right before you grill it, pat it dry (so it will get darkened faster on the grill).
3. Place steak on VERY HOT grill and liberally pour salt (kosher is best) over each piece. It only takes a few minutes to cook. You will know it is done when the salt has melted.
4. Flip the steak, pour salt on the other side. Again, the salt will be melted when it is all cooked.
5. Keep in a nice dutch oven or heavy pot until ready to serve.
Hope this helps someone! It really made a difference in my carne asada.

You know what? This is an awesome marinade!  I follow this recipe exactly except I've been adding an additional tsp. of a carne seasoning from the local Vallarta store.  Also, please marinate your RANCHERA DE RES (thin flank/flap meat) for at least 20 hours.  Buy freshly made tortillas from the store, don't buy the packaged and shipped type like Mission tortillas.  Throw your tortillas on the grill for a few seconds on each side too!  I'm not sure about the sauce because I make my own pico de gallo ( 4 roma tomato, 3/4 yellow onion, 1 bunch cilantro, bout 4 juiced limes, saltn pepper).  Trust me! Everyone that you make this for will think you are some type of grilling God of Asada after tasting this! I have ate a lot of tacos and meat from many places and what you make here will blow most places away!

I use this marinade (after I did a little tweaking)and it's a hit! My BBQ will never be the same.
First I took out the soy sauce( real Mexico did not have this to use, and it allowed me to control the salt level).
Next, reduce the Vinegar to 1/4c and add, 1/4c Lemon juice, 1/4c Orange juice, Chopped Green Onions and Chopped Cilantro.
This will bring a true mexican taste.
I use this marinade for all my 'To be grilled' meats.
Beef Ribs, Spare Ribs, Pork Shoulder Steak, All beef steaks, Chicken, etc.
I always make enough to set some aside so I can baste will they grill or warm the reserve in a sauce pan and add as the finishing touch, just before serving.
If your try this at your next BBQ, everyone will be asking for the recipe!

Okay, for all of you that don't want to use soy sauce because it is not the "real deal", use one beef bullion cube with 1/2 cup water in it's place.  There. It's the salt factor.
WONDERFUL RECIPE by the way! This is a keeper!

Wow...that's all there is to say about this one.  Cooked it for Father's Day and it was absolutely fantastic.  I added sliced bell peppers to the salsa, and tomato & jalapenos to the relish as another user suggested.  I wasn't too sure how it would work out but the flavours merge into something really special.  Make sure to cook the meat until *all* the liquid is gone!  Two thumbs way up.

HUBBY LOVED THEM!!! Very easy!!!  Mostly preping and eating.  Some believe some people thought it was a difficult dish because it is a long recipe.  But it's really only four steps 

1. marinade 
2. relish 
3. salsa 
4. cook!  

We did 2 things a little different. I used pork loin (it was cheaper than flank at the time, flank can be tough, and reviewers said these are usually pork and we love pork), and we cooked the entire recipe on the grill!  WOW! WHAT A FABULOUS GRILLING RECIPE!  The pork was tender, marinade was AWESOME.  My hubby said he could eat this once a week!  We just loved it.  Leftovers were great the next day too!  Thanks for a new KEEPER recipe!

First off- the golden star of the night- the salsa was superb. I had guests over and they were hovering around the salsa, leaving for a few seconds, and coming back again. I roasted sweet Vidalias as the white onions, vine tomatoes (not plum)- left seeds in- didn't make a difference and I hate seeds- just for specifics.
The carne asada mix seemed really good, but it was not as powerful as I wanted it to be- not garlicky enough? The meat was marinated for over 8 hours, but it just didn't develop the type of aggressive, meaty flavor I expected, especially from using the soy sauce.

Don't know if it is authentic or not, but it sure is good.  Again, to all those that "add this", "reduce that", "omit that", you are not rating the recipe, but rather your own.

In any case, this recipe is great as is.  You can just as easily sub other meats if you don't care for flank steak.  Grilled over mesquite is awesome.

The only change I made to the recipe was omitting the white pepper - I didn't have any.  I grilled these on a bbq and they were excellent! The only thing is, like has been said already, these are nowhere close to the carne asada tacos in a taqueria.  If that flavor is what you're craving, move on! If you're just wanting some yummy meat, on the other hand, this recipe is a winner!

These tacos are so good!  Better than a taqueria, way better!  I did make some changes, here's what I suggest:  Cut the meat up first before you marinade it, it's a lot cleaner that way and the fabulous flavor gets on every piece.  Also the salsa isn't necessary but the onion relish is, it's really great.  I've made this twice, once using the skirt steak (the best) and the other time using a cheap london broil, cut up into tiny little pieces.  The cheap cut took about 45 minutes to cook all the juices down but it was still really good.  This is a keeper! :-)

This was a delicious meal.  I made it last night and my family loved it.  Especially my husband.  The roasted veggie puree was delicious and so easy to make.  I wanted to use the puree like a salsa and dip chips into it but I didn't have any.  Next time.  This may be my new salsa recipe as well as taco sauce.

Delicious! We moved away from Southern California last year and we miss carne asada! I have tried several recipes, and this is the clear winner. It tastes like home. Yay!

I took this along on a camping trip over the weekend; I was really excited about grilling it up for everyone.  We had a good laugh about the fact that I brought "garlic asada" along.  For the record, I left out the garlic powder (by the time I added all the minced garlic, I thought I'd better), and it was still just too much.  It didn't taste like carne asada *at all*, and we've had plenty of authentic mexican food.  Thanks, anyway.

This marinade is out of this world!  I let the steaks marinate overnight.  Then instead of tacos I used it to make an Asada Jardin.  This is a carne asada steak topped with sauteed onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and halved cherry tomatoes, then smothered in monterey jack cheese.  It makes a beautiful presentation and my guests raved about the flavor of the steak.  I will use this recipe for the marinade every time!

We love fajitas and my hubby said he would be fine never having another fajita again just as long as I make this meat.  I precut my petite sirloin in chunks and marinated the meat all day.  AMAZING!  I did follow the review of another saying to blend the marinade together.  I think that was brilliant!  I personally thought the "salsa" and the onion/cilantro/lime relish was good but not great.  I will skip those the next time and keep the carne asada meat recipe locked in a safe.  lol

Didnt really like the marinade for a mexican style dish. It seemed more of an asian marinade. However the relish was really good and the methods were good. Just need a different marinade.

The absolute bomb.  When you're craving taco truck carne asade (which to me translates to more authentic), this is THE go-to recipe. I buy carne asada steaks, make up a batch of the marinade and then Seal-A-Meal several packages of a few servings each so it makes a quick and easy dinner once thawed.

We ate these last night for dinner until we had to roll ourselves away from the table! Delicious & just like the $1 tacos we get every Saturday from the Hispanic family at the Farmer's Market--but don't tell her! Mine were marinated overnight & I'll definitely do that every time. My only tiny complaint was that my meat was chewy (but that's not the recipe's fault). Maybe next Saturday I'll ask her how she gets hers so tender; then we'll have the perfect tacos! I didn't want to individually fry each corn tortilla & I didn't want to microwave like one reviewer had suggested, so I just wrapped them in tin foil & let them hang out in the warmed oven until dinner--definitely my "go-to" way from now on. Try these, you will LOVE them!

I've never had the real thing, but these tasted good.  It wasn't excellent, just good.  The sauce had a little bit of heat, but not much flavor.  If you make this, make sure to use the softest meat you can find, otherwise it'll be too chewy.  I did add some chopped tomatoes to the onion-cilantro-lime topping, and I did add some sour cream to my tacos.. They tasted better this way, but I will keep looking for a better recipe.. Also, I removed the top of the chili and de-seaded it after toasting it, and before putting it in the blender, however the recipe does not mention if that is what you are supposed to do.

Sorry, I just don't get it. Have made it per the recipe twice now (we had head colds first time so wanted to be fair) & it's a fine meat marinade but I think the soy sauce makes for an odd carne adada & definitely doesn't taste like any taqueria or even Baja street taco we've ever had. I might give it one last shot & omit the soy sauce, I'll let you know!

This review is based on the marinade because I didn't make the salsa or relish--yet (I do have all the ingredients).  What an excellent flavor this meat has!  I froze a little more than half of the meat (flap steak from Costco) so that I can grill it for the rest of my family later this next week.  I may go short on the soy sauce next time, but that is just a personal preference!  I didn't add the salt, but it could use a little.  I think salt from soy sauce and sea salt are different.  The saltiness is evened out anyway when other ingredients are added to the tacos.  Thanks for this recipe!

I live in southern California and know what carne asada is supposed to be alike and this is not it.  Sorry to say, but it wasn't authentic at all.  The soy was way out of place in this recipe.  Sorry, but I just can't give it a good review.

This is not authentic...soy sauce in tacos? No way!! I grew up in East LA and I've never had soy sauce in my tacos...sorry.  This is a very good marinade, but it is NOT taqueria style.

We followed every bit of the recipe, apart from the cotija cheese. It is not available in Greece, so we substituted it for romano. It was amazing! The marinade was the best of all, but the salsa was great too. This recipe is indeed a bit time consuming, but it gives you something to rave about! I will use the marinade with other types  of meat too.

Oct. 2007: We've made this a few times now and it's a favorite.  I cut the soy sauce to 1/3 c., as it was too strong.  We tried both flank and skirt steak, and flank steak was much better.  Definitely not perfectly authentic, but since moving from So. CA , it's good enough.  Where is the good Mexican food in CO??  We barbecued it almost weekly during summer. **6/13/09: Tried this marinade on boneless skinless chicken breasts, then grilled them on the bbq and it was fabulous!

Decent flavor.  They may look similar to authentic taqueria tacos, but the flavor is far off.  Try some real ones in San Diego or Tijuana at Tacos El Gordo or in Chandler, AZ at Mi Casita (I think is the name)  I will not be making this recipe again, but it's a good starting point.

Excellent Excellent Excellent!!!  We prepared these as written except we omitted the sauce portion of the recipe and just used fresh salsa from the veggie section of our market. They were VERY GOOD!  If you love traditional mexican as much as we do, then I highly recommend you try these.  The sauce just seemed to be too time consuming to do, but might try it when we have some extra time on a weekend.

oh my how tasty!  I was looking for a good carne asada for the grill so I made this one suit my needs.  I did everything as instructed except I grilled my flank steak.  I also boiled and recuced the marinade and after slicing my medium rare steak on a bias and against the grain I tossed in the sauce.  Sooooo yummy.   After reading reviews I almost didnt make the roasted veggie salsa but I am so glad I did. The only thing different I did to prepare it was drizzle with evoo and season with s/p before roasting.  I really think this could be a great basting for grilled shrimp or chicken. It was great . Thanks!

Was pretty good, though I didn't make the salsa.  Can't help but be a little disappointed with the marinade.  After reading the other reviews, I was expecting something that would send me into fits of feeding glee, but sadly it didn't.  Not a bad sauce.  A bit salty if anything, but something I would try again with a couple of alterations.

I gave this four stars instead of five because the pureed salsa was not to our liking.  It wasn't as fresh tasting as some of the quality store bought salsa's.

The first time I made this recipe my family felt it was too salty. I omitted the salt in the marinade the next time around and it was much better.

I used flour tortillas and served it with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheddar cheese, olives and the onion relish.  The onion relish was great!

Just a hint...add some marinade to the pan while cooking the meat but cook it on high heat for at least one minute to avoid bacterial contamination.

I go to Mexico every year to visit my dad's family.  I love to eat food from the taquerias, and have longed for a great recipe that will even come close to the amazing meats they serve.  This is the one!!  I have never tasted anything so close to the real thing.  If you want to try real Mexican food, your quest has ended.

One of the best recipes around.  The marinade alone deserves five stars, I use it on everything, it is exceptional on shrimp and chicken.  This is a keeper!

I have made this over and over and over again. Always exactly by the recipe... I have never been disappointed! Even my Hispanic friend that cooks most of her dishes very authentically said these are some of the best carne asada tacos ever!  Can't go wrong with this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it!

I made this for the first time tonight trying to replicate a taco stand here in town that the kids love.   It was almost an exact match.  I didn't have white vinegar, rather apple cider vinegar and it may have even been better.    The only other changes I made were to halve the oil and used low sodium soy sauce.   

The relish is absolutely amazing and I will double it next time.   Also, I didn't make the salsa.  Just seemed like too much work for an every day meal but perhaps if I make this for company I will make that effort. 

Overall amazing.  Do not let the list of ingredients deter you.  I had everything in my pantry and it was literally a minute or two to grab them all out and dump them in a plastic bag for the marinade.    The kids ate every bit of it and it was a nice change from the tacos I usually make.

I used a pork butt roast instead of flank or skirt steak.  I doubled the amount of marinade for my 3.5 lb roast, but only used single amount of olive oil.  Marinated 2-3 hours in a ziplock bag, turning every 30+ minutes.  I then placed the roast pieces in a dutch oven.  Using a can of beef broth & half the left over marinade, I poured this over the roast in the dutch oven.  After 4 hours in a 285 degree oven, the roast shredded to perfection and was muy delicioso in our tacos!  Will make burritos tonight with the left overs or BBQ beef.

This is fantastic!  We make this all the time!  Very flavorful and gets rave comments from guests as well.  We slice up the flank steak into 1" strips before we marinade it.  The accompanying tomato/onion relish is very tasty, too.  A time-saving tip is to make a larger amount of the dry ingredients and save it.  We also slice a LARGE amount of flank steak at once, place into Ziploc bags a freeze.  The meat marinades as it freezes and as it thaws.  Great to have at the ready since this is so popular at our house.  Making it for Cinco de Mayo as always!

I've been looking for a good carne asada recipe for years, this is THE BEST!  I was worried for a little while while it was cooking, but just let the liquid cook down and you get this great thickened sauce that coats it and just shredds in your mouth, thanks!

Very good as is, but I added some additional cumin, garlic salt, pepper, and a tablespoon of pureed chipotle peppers and really took it to where I wanted it to be. I marinated the flank steak for 3 days and threw it in the crockpot on low for 7 hours. I wish I could've made the onion relish, but we sufficed with some storebought pico de gallo.

Outstanding! We are self-proclaimed foodies in this house, and we didn't notice the soy-sauce. I didn't measure the soy sauce either, I doubt I put in what the recipe calls for, but I did measure right below the recommended amount of vinegar (we didn't want it to over power) and everything else measured out the same, just 1/2 the amount of chili powder. 
I used carne picada extra thin from the grocery store and THEN searched recipes, this one looked good and I am so glad I went with it! The family RAVED about it and we are going to make this part of our menu!
I did NOT make the salsa, because I have my own recipe, but I did make the "relish" but didn't measure... I adjusted the amounts to our liking. I also didn't use cheese. Everywhere I have had "authentic" Mexican taquitos, IN MEXICO, have NO cheese.... I just went with onions, cilantro and lime.... so wonderful! You MUST try it!

This is absolutely a 5 star recipe. I followed directions as someone suggested to blend marinated ingredients in the blender and then marinated overnight. Made this twice now for my family and friends. Everyone LOVES it. I will only make this recipe for carne asada from now on. Thank you for this delicious recipe!!

Try using the marinade to season your ground beef for tacos: I made half the marinade recipe and added that to 1 pound ground beef.  I added maybe a half a teaspoon of cornstract to help thicken the sace as it simmered.  They were the best tacos we've ever had!

SO delicious. I had some leftover grilled sirloin steaks to use up, so I sliced them thin and threw them in the crockpot with this sauce recipe. I left it on low for about 7 hrs. and the results were the BEST taco filling we have had! All 3 of my boys said "Best tacos ever!" Thanks for a great recipe!

This is based soley on the steak marinade. We followed it exactly and just didn't like it. It wasn't bad, but it really lost the flavor of the meat in the marinade. I think we're back to salt pepper and oil.

The marinade is amazing.  Truly, truly delicious.  I didn't actually make the tacos like they did because I was just taking the meat to a taco bar with some friends, but everyone loved it.  Oh, I also only had petite sirloin, but oh my!  It was tender & delicious.  Thanks!

OK, this in now one of my family's favorite meals!  We are all very fond of the Carne Asada meat recipe!  I have made the recipe numerous times using my dutch oven and baking it instead of cooking on the stove top.  I use 2 flank steaks and double the recipe for the sauce, then bake for about 1.5 hours.  It's super yummy.  I have made the roasted vegetable sauce only once and didn't like it as well as others I have made, but the meat is TRULY fantastic!

I thought the salsa was very bland. It had a kick but it just wasn't good. Definately wouldn't add the cotija cheese, it made it way too salty. Overall I wouldn't make this again.

I had been looking for a Taqueria style taco recipe for quite some time when I stumbled across this one.  It is AWESOME!  Search no more - make exactly as stated and you won't be disappointed.   Oh - one suggestion: drink a Carona while making.  :)

This recipe was really not to my liking. It's a lot of work and it ended up tasting like some sort of weird mex-asian meat because of the soy sauce.

I substituted the soy sauce for dark Mexican beer Negra Modelo.  With this substitution, these tacos tasted exactly like the best street taco I've ever had from a vendor in Cuernavaca, Mexico.  They were amazing.

I had some too thin N.Y. strip steaks so I used that. I made some pico de gallo from another recipe on here so I only made the steak part.  I marinated for 2 hours, but 1 hour probably would have been plenty as the marinade is kind of salty. I may try a low sodium soy sauce next time. I served the steak on warmed up corn tortillas with the pico de gallo on top.  Enjoyed thanks!

Loved this recipe. I would give it more stars if I could. My daughter who doesn't like steak or tacos in general loved these. She made a plate for her father and told me that she was taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I did alter the salsa only because I couldn't find the chili pods. I used one tablespoon New Mexico chili powder, one tablespoon sugar, one 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes with chili's and a little water. Thank you for the recipe my family loved it.

This is HANDS DOWN the best steak I had ever made at home.  I make it just as written, except for that I double the lime juice.  Make this adjustment, and it comes out perfect every single time.  I've tried several different kinds of steaks, and actually like leaner cuts better than flank.  The trick is to make sure it is VERY thinly sliced, just barely thicker than you'd find deli roast beef.  You will not be sorry with these two recommendations.  Marinate for at least 4 hours.  1 hour is not enough.  Cook on a grill if possible - I've used both indoor and outdoor, and both were good.  The relish is tasty too, but I use half of an onion instead, throw in two jalapenos, the cilantro and lime juice, and put it through a food processor 'til desired texture is reached.  The salsa is good, just not my style..  Comes out smoky (think Chipotle) and sweet.  I've used all kinds of tomatoes, but so far, four Romas have worked best.  Still not great though.  Need to experiment more with this one.  In the meanwhile, even a good hot sauce or pico de gallo works here.  Toast your corn tortillas before serving.   Cojita is nice addition, but certainly not necessary.  If you use enough lime, the meat will have so much flavor, you won't want to cover it up.  Ole!

I will make again with the following changes:  I will decrease the amount of vinegar to 1/4 (or maybe even 1/8) of a cup.  The vinegar overpowered the taste of the seasonings.  I will also increase the amount of cumin and chili powder from 1 tsp to 1 tbl spn for each.  The recipe was pretty good, I used chihuahua cheese instead of queso fresco.  Thanks for the submission, it's a great start toward authentic tasting taqueria tacos.

I only used the marinade part of this recipe so that's why I'm only rating it 4 stars. I used flap meat and let is marinade for 2 hours. We then cooked the meat in the broiler. Turned out really good. Next time I'm going to marinade it over night.

Marinade for the meat is sublime. The sauce is too hot, so made it a second time without the jalapeno peppers. This is a recipe I'll make for the rest of my life!

I did not like the relish, but the carne asada itself was AWESOME! So I told people not to try it. LOL

Changes:

1/4 cup White Vinegar
Used 3.5lbs of Beef Tenderloin (about 10 thin slices)
1/2 low sodium soy sauce
No chili powder (forgot - will try next time)
No ground white pepper (I just don't like this spice scent and didn't bother buying it at the store because I don't need it in my pantry)
Use 1/4 tsp of fresh ground cumin
Everything else the same

Marinated for 12 hours.  Grilled this on our iron skillet with butter.  Fabulous!  Made it for a party of 12.  Of course this amount of meat is not enough for 12, but I had other food like green chile burritos, salmon, etc.

Biggest Compliment from a couple of Carne Asada fans...this was the best carne asada they've ever had. My husband received emails from his guy friends about how great it was!  I'll definitely make again!

Amazing recipe, too spicy for the kids, but they're kinda wimpy in that respect :) I follow the recipe exactly up to the salsa, I just use our preferred jarred to save a little time. The marinade makes AWESOME chicken too!

This recipe never fails me.  My friends and family are afraid to invite me over when they cook. Throw in some refried beans, guacamole, some good rice, and you have a belly busting feast.

This tastes just like the taco stands we go to down the street where no one speaks English. I didn't make the sauce, just marinated the meat put the relish on and squeezed fresh lime on when we ate them. They were PERFECT!

My husband is from Southern California and this was the way to his heart. He misses the good carne asada - and he said this definitely tasted authentic. The first time, I made the salsa as instructed and although I liked it, it wasn't worth all the work. I also used the marinade on chicken and let it sit overnight and surprisingly...it was DELICIOUS!! I now cook both chicken and steak everytime I make this. Thanks for such a great recipe!!

Just like the taco trucks/wagons! So easy too. Don't let the long ingredient list turn you off. I didn't make the salsa this time, but will probably next time. We serve with lime wedges. Mmmmmm. Thanks for sharing!

I only made the meat marinade for this recipe, but it was wow-ie delicious.  We marinated the meat (top sirlion) for about 2 1/2 hours (we had already cut it up).  We scaled it down to six servings for my husband and I, made some rice, warmed some black beans, and had some great burritos.  We opened a can of green enchilada sauce, used cheddar and Pepper jack cheese, sour cream, and topped with fresh cilantro for some extra yummy goodness.  This is a keeper! Great marinade! Thanks!

SO GOOD!! Even though I used a different cut of meat and didn't have cumin, or New Mexican chile pods for the puree, this recipe turned out great. My mother who is very picky about foods actually said she liked it (with a smirk on her face). I thought it was fabulous and plan to use it many more times.

I am only rating the marinade, but it was absolutely delicious.  I cut some steak into strips and marinaded them for a few hours before frying them and serving them in tortillas with cheese, sour cream and salsa.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is the best carne asada!  Don't neglect to cook the meat until the liquid has evaporated.  This is what makes the meat so flavorful.

I didn't follow this exactly, but I did do a number of things from this recipe.  Here's what I did:  I used a thinly sliced meat that you find in the market instead of the flank steak.  I also then didn't use any of the wet ingredients, except using the lime juice at some point during the cooking, and just used the dry ones as a rub on it (basically, the ingredients from salt down to paprika in the first set).  I cooked it in a pan on the stove, sliced it small, and put it in corn tortillas and topped it off with white onion, cilantro, and a little hot sauce.  It was spectacular.  I didn't follow it exactly, but I got something wonderful out of it.  Would highly recommend it.

We're thinking about opening a taco stand with this recipe....ha ha!  Seriously, this recipe was the best!  We used our own salsa though - and grilled the steak on the BBQ, finished it off in a pan.

I have made this quite a few times.  I make it exactly as written, but sometimes my grocery store doesn't carry the flank steak, so I found that flat iron steak is a good substitution for this scenario.  Regardless of meat choice, this recipe is so delicious.  The flavor of the steak is incredible. The "salsa" is deep red and so delicious with the steak, and the onion/cilantro/lime topping with shredded cotija cheese is the perfect accompaniment.  I saved this recipe and will probably make it from time to time for the rest of my life. The cook who wrote this recipe is a genius in my book.  Thanks chef!

This is a fabulous recipe. I doubled everything because I was feeding a crowd. People loved it and there was nothing left at the end of the night. Don't worry about the soy-sauce--it actually adds a bit of rich tangyness to the flavour of the meat. In fact, I didn't have enough soy-sauce, so I added a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and it gave it the meat even more depth. I let the meat marinate in the fridge for 8 hours, drained the marinade and boiled it down a bit. After that, I put the meat and the reduced marinade into a slow cooker for another 8 hours. At the end of the 8 hours I took everything out, drained the meat from the liquid (there's a lot!) and then shredded the beef. It was tender and extremely flavourful. The way I did it was time-consuming but not difficult. I didn't make the salsa featured in this receipe--just made a simple pico de gallo salsa instead. I'm definitely going to be making this recipe again and will give the salsa a shot next time as well.

AMAZING!  Have made many times. Always a hit. Marinate overnight. Definitely make the lime, onion, cilantro relish. Serve with good quality pico de gallo, sliced avocados, the lime onion relish, and a chipotle sour cream sauce. Yum!

OMG this is delicious!!! I followed exactly except marinaded for 24 hrs overnight. Used 3.5 lbs of meat and it made 10 large fajitas (2 per person) Served with green peppers and onions sautéed with cumin, garlic powder and chili powder. and then fresh chopped onions and cilantro, etc. Grilled for about 12-14 min on low (after wiping down meat with paper towel before putting on grill to reduce flare ups). Amazing - would be great serving with some homemade chimmichuri sauce!

Outstanding tacos! I've been living and working in an area where I am privileged enough to be able to go to the local taqueria for lunch or dinner whenever I want. Prior to this, I had only been exposed to the typical "American" tacos, and when I had my first taqueria taco it was like my mind exploded. I recently went home, and cooked this for my family. It was amazing to see their faces and them realize that THIS is how tacos should taste.

I make this meal in the crockpot. I omit the oil and tripple the marinade recipe, and use a beef roast (any cut is perfectly fine). I let it cook on low until it is tender enough to shred (flipping every few hours if the roast isn't covered), and then I put the meat back in with the juices for another hour or 2. This is WONDERFUL!!! it tastes just like the Carne Asada you would get at an authentic taco stand! We make it all the time! The first time I made it we were stationed in Germany, and the store didnt have any of the chili's or the right kind of cheese, so instead I just make a simple onion and tomato salsa, and we use regular shredded cheese. Now that we are back in the states, I am hoping to try the other parts to this recipe as well, but I am still having a hard time finding the other ingredients (we're in a small town, but until then, my family is more than happy having it the way we usually do. If your in doubt, I urge you to try this recipe! I promise it won't be the last time!

Awesome tacos. Sneaking bits from the pot I thouht this was a good but not great recipe, but in a corn tortilla with all the trimmings these are just like what I get from my favorite restaurant. I followed the meat to the letter, but did not make the salsa or onion topping. I will undoubtedly make again, thanks so much for sharing!

I followed the recipe as closely as I could.  I had tenderloin tips available for the  meat so I used it.  Before cooking, I pounded the meat down to 1/4" then cooked it to medium on a hot, oiled, griddle.  After the pieces were cooked I sliced them into bite size slices.  Next time I make these, and it will be soon, I plan on splitting the relish and adding diced tomato to half of it.  The roasted vegetable sauce was awesome.

I fought every bone in my body to do this just as posted but I broke down and bought good sirloin and seared it then slow grilled it.. Really quite fantastic!.. 

I did an 8 hour marinade on about 3/4" thick sirloin. My grill has a searing plate (about 60 seconds per side) then slow cooked them 25 minutes or so on low heat.

Outstanding recipe!!! I even will do a quick marinade on leftover steak. Now when tell my husband we are having steak for dinner he is always making sure I cook extra for carne asada. We use fresh salsa from the store but everything else just as stated. Do make sure to pat dry the meat so it can sear then add some marinade towards the end.

Made these tonight and we LOVED them! We sliced the meat before marinating to get full flavor. Loved the combination of the mild red salsa and the tangy onion relish. We pan-fried our corn tortillas in a dab of oil to make them crispy. This also keeps them from getting soggy with meat juices. We didn't cook off all the liquid because we like a juicy taco filling. A real winner. Would give it ten stars if I could. Doesn't need all the standard American taco accouterments - lettuce, tomato, sour cream, etc. Were wonderful and more authentic all on their own.

A little time consuming, but worth it.  I really enjoyed these and the rest of my family liked them, as well.  The cotija cheese definitely makes a difference.

(3.5 STARS) I made this last night for my wife and two of our closest friends.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I put the sliced flank steak into my crock pot on HIGH for 5 hours... came out tender as can be and it melted in your mouth.  None of us cared for the puree (odd flavor) but the onion relish was fantastic!  Without the puree this recipe is a keeper.  Served with extra cilantro, chopped lettuce, salsa, guacamole, Mexican style shredded cheese (could not find Cotija or Queso Fresco at my local supermarket), hot sauce, and sour cream.

The meat marinade is amazing as is. I didn't change a thing. The salsa and the relish were a little bitter. I will definitely be using the marinade again..although instead of 6 hours in the fridge I'll let it sit overnight.

I really wanted to like this one! BUT It wasn't quite what i was expecting. It was TOO salty and tasted more like Chinese than Mexican. This one's NOT a keeper.

An easier way and closer to authentic is just adding 3 Tbsp chili powder,1or 2 tsp of montreal steak seasoning, 3 garlic cloves finely chopped to about two or three fresh squeezed lime juice let it sit for a while as you let the meat brown (flank or whatever you use...i DO NOT recommend ground beef). then add it your skillet and let it simmer until the juices are soaked up or meat is fully cooked.

Loved this recipe, I did make some changes. I had about 5-6 pounds of meat.  I added yellow pickled peppers and used the vinegar from the peppers. I also sliced onions, added cilantro, and used the juice of an orange. I left the orange, lemon, and lime rinds in the meat and froze it.

This is the closest thing I have tasted to the taco stands in Mexico.  I think the difference is that there, they use fatty meats fried at high temps (which is yummier, but not good for you...).

There are really no words to describe how amazing this meat is.  I wouldn't even bother with the salsa.  I use pico de gallo and my husband and I can't stop raving about it!  Definately the best marinade I have ever tried.  I am going to start prepping and freezing the marinated meat.  This is a MUST TRY!!!  You will not be disapointed.

WOW!  These are AWESOME!  I had a party and made these to fancy up the traditional taco night, and they were a huge hit!  One change I made:  I wanted to make my own tortillas, but didn't think I'd have time to do it all.  I decided to save time by not making the tomato based salsa.  I instead bought a really good pre-made jarred salsa for that portion of the recipe.  I did, however, still make the onion/lime juice/cillantro salsa, and trust me, you don't want to skip that!  They were absolutely delicious even with store bought red salsa, and I feel it was worth it to be able to have homemade tortillas.  Next time, I'll try to budget time to do it all!  Trust me, there will be a next time!

I do not understand the great reviews.  This  tastes nothing like the carne asada I had in any mexican restaurant.  I used less than half of the suggested vinegar and it was still too tangy.  I don't usually taste any vinegar in carne asada.  Unfortunately I wasted good NY steak on this recipe and will not be making it again.

The marinade is soo scrumptious!  You will definitely want it to sit in the marinade as long as time will allow.  I recommend grilling/frying the steak before cutting it, and don't over cook the meat.  Cheese is unnecessary.  Lime is essential.  Quickest way to toast the tortillas is by putting them directly on the burner, but you have to keep a very close eye on them and only let it sit for a few seconds.

Love this recipe and so does everyone I have made it for.  I've made it at least 4 times in the last 2 months.  The only thing I did was adding the roasted veggies after they were blended to the steak and let it simmer down for about 15 or 20 minutes.  So much flavor.

My only complaint is the time I spent in the kitchen just to make a taco.  When making this recipe I did not realize the amount of prep work that was required.  Next time around I will make all the sauces and marinate the flank steak the night before cooking this meal.  However, I must say it was unlike any taco I have had before.  The meat is so delicious and tasty!!!!  Definitely a recipe you want to keep for Mexican night.  The combination of all the spices make for quite a flavorful meat.

WOW after making about 10 times these are by far my favorite tacos. They are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. Pair it with some hot sauce The salsa is good but not necessary as it takes up time, but you can make it the day before.  Great recipe!! My boyfriend said he would want these every day if possible haha.

EXCELLENT carne asada!!! We usually drive a ways to our favorite Mexican market to buy their carne asada called "marinaded flap meat". I decided to see if I can make it myself so we can have it more often and not have to drive so far. I found this recipe and it is even BETTER than the Mex market's. I just used the marinade and did not make the salsa because the meat has enough flavor. The only difference is that I used flap meat and added the chopped cilantro to the marinade since that is what the Mex Market does. We make it into burritos by cooking sliced onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes in olive oil, then adding it to the meat. Oh, I forgot to say that the meat MUST be barbecued to get the full flavor. Then slice before adding to the burritos.

This is average at best. I live in los angeles, and here you have taqueria style tacos scattared all over the city.  This does not compare to any of them.  One tip though is to use mexican oregano, or fresh oregano if you have it on hand.  I even did the ultimate test, feed my mexican husband and his brothers this steak and all of them said the same thing. I really really wanted to love this because I love carne asada so much, but it fell flat. Maybe to those who have never really tasted good carne asada this will be 5 stars but to those who have tasted the real thing, it does not compare. I think it has a lot to do with the soy sauce.  Soy sauce is an Asian seasoning.  It is never found in authentic mexican cooking.

I can't say anything about the garnish or salsa, but the meat... Whoa- LOVED IT! I've eaten carne asada down in San Diego, too, and I completely disagree with the reviewers that say it isn't authentic. This was simply delicious, and cooked up on a hot grill in all of five minutes. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but instead of garlic powder and salt separately, used garlic salt, and used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any white. I also used taco seasoning in place of all of the components of taco seasoning separately (cumin, paprika, etc.). Garnished with cilantro, fresh tomato, and green onion. Great! I'll be making this a lot around here...

This is by far my favorite recipe for carne asada.  Following the recipe yields a lot of carne asada, which goes pretty far as tacos.  I think the salsa is some of the the best I have tried.  The roasted red chile gives it a nice smokey flavor.  I live in New Mexico so I always have red chile on hand. It's well worth the extra effort.

This was good, but it could have been improved with less soy sauce and perhaps a bit more lime. The soy sauce completely overpowered the other flavors.

Oh.  My.  Word.  These are SO good!!!!!!  I made these with thin sirloin tip steaks and grilled them; the flavor went all the way through the meat.  I used this for fajitas, so I didn't use the rest of the ingredients. The only change I made was to decrease the chili powder to 1/4 tsp (simply because I don't care for it).  The marinade was perfect.

I've enjoyed many dishes featuring steak at various Mexican restaurants, but in the future I will be extremely disappointed because nothing compares to this!

The marinade was awesome, however...I used a crappy cut of meat so it was VERY dry and tough. I should have used flap meat which just melts in your  mouth. I really enjoyed the flavor and will use again with better meat.

this recipe is a family favorite. my sis-in-law uses this recipe since she moved to a part of the country where getting authentic mexican food is virtually unheard of. it's especially good if you have the time to marinate overnight.

I made this dish for a camping trip - prepared most of it beforehand, then cooked over a fire - and it was quite good. I got mixed reviews on the salsa. I loved it as did my brother-in-law, but my sister thought it was too sweet. If I make it again I will pound the meat before marinating, though, as it was too thick for me.

Okay, I'm sure that everyone who reads this and sees the soy sauce knows that these are not authentic.  However, that doesn't mean that they are not good.  The marinade for the meat, anyway.  That's all I used.  DH is Mexican/American and I try, on occasion, to make something psuedo-mexican that he will enjoy.  Due to health reasons, I can't eat spicy food, so I have to stay away from those things, but decided to make burritos for his birthday.  His grown son was here, so he handled the "salsa," and I have no idea how he makes it, so I can't share it.  However, I made the beans and used this marinade for the meat.  My husband was in heaven.  Yes, it's not authentic, but it is good and if MY picky hubby (who swears his Abuela was a food master) liked it, something must be right!

What a marinade!  As many reviewers before, I only used this recipe for the marinade.  I used my own guacamole recipe and homemade flour tortilla recipe [absolutely no corn masa available in London!], and they were unbelievable!  Next time I will at least double the recipe, because we just couldn't get enough.  Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

I made this recipe last night and it was great! I followed the recipe exactly, next time I will use less olive oil in the marinade because I thought it was too much once I cooked the meat. I was surprised by how much I liked the relish because I’m not a big fan of onions, the salsa was good but a bit bland. My husband loved these tacos and I will definitely make them again!!

I only made the meat, and while it was very tasty, it's definitely NOT what I think of as 'carne asada'. I also think it would be better grilled.

I made this for my parents the week after my (now) fiance and I moved in together. I changed a few hings due to availability - I used chicken, cut into long strips, and also apple cider vinegar for the health benefits. Absolutely FANTASTIC. This is our go to recipe for  impressing company and friend. Have yet to try the relish though (df is a bit picky).

Very tasty, I was surprised that it didn't taste like usual Carne Asadas. Almost had a mediterranean (sp?) taste. The Cumin was very strong in the dish, but everyone loved it.

Wonderful!!! My husband can't get enough and takes bites to his friends. It is on the salty side and I'll try the low sodium soy sauce and less salt next time. BTW this is great with a roast in the crock-pot. Shred and enjoy with the relish and the roasted pepper salsa. Heaven!

MMMMM...Delicious!!! I marinated the meat over night and after smelling the aroma of the meat the following day...I knew this was gonna be a hit.  After the meat was cooked, I chopped it up taqueria style and added the onion/lime relish which tasted soooo GOOD!  My husband loved it too.  I didn't care too much for the red salsa though.  It was kind of bland but overall okay.  I will definitely make this again!  Next time I'll BBQ the meat.  Thumbs up!

I only used the marinade and then grilled the steak and it turned out great!!  My husband raved about it.  The only thing I will change next time is I will reduce the amount of soy sauce by about half.  The soy taste was overpowering and masked the other seasoning.  This will definitely be used over and over again in our house.

My family and I love this recipe.  I've made it several times pretty close to the stated instructions.  Many thanks to the original submitter.

Could the person who used slow cooker state his/her technique?  A slow cooker version would make this a weekday dish and fit into my busy schedule.

This is soooooooooo delicious.  We've made this twice so far.  The first time we followed the recipe exactly, but the second time we saved time by using store-bought salsa and pre-shredded mexican cheese.  turned out fantastic both times.  :)

This recipe is a 4.5 and well worth making.  Following the entire recipe for meat and marinade, onion - cilantro - lime relish, roasted vegetable salsa, cotilja cheese, and lime wedges takes a LOT of time.  WAY MORE than stated, but the end result is well worth the effort.  This is a Saturday afternoon project.  

Curiously, where the meat marinade imparts the "caliente" in this dish, the onion - cilantro - lime relish, the cotija cheese, the salsa, and a squirt of lime actually softens the overall flavor, imparting a sweetness that is a big part of what makes the recipe so good.  

As other writers have said, use low-salt soy sauce, go sparingly with the use of salt through the entire recipe, use thin skirt steak, trim all fat, and cut meat into small sized bites before marinating.  The longer you can marinate the steak, the better.

My wife, who would complain if the meal were too spicy, had seconds and believes this recipe is delicious enough for the menus of our more expensive local Mexican food restaurants in Southern California.

I just tried this recipe a couple months ago, and am making it again tonight. I only made the marinade, but cut the meat into strips first, and used top sirloin steak, discarded all fat, and let marinade for a couple hours, will longer this time, but was great, and this time am trying with a cast iron skillet on the grill to get a smoky flavor. Also used the leftover marinade for chicken the next night that we grilled and everyone loved that too. As far as it being 16 servings, not at my house! I had 2 big men and me, and sent our guest home with two good sized ones, and the rest was GONE! I used heated flour tortillas with grated sharp cheddar cheese, and chopped avacado and tomatoes. also salsa or picante sauce, and black olives if desired. Was delicious and I am picky. My husband and guest raved about it also.

I only gave it 3 stars because to me the meat didn't really have much flavor. I marinated it for 12 hours so it was very tender, I made the sauce which was very good. I also chopped up an avocado, tomato, onion and cilatro and put that on top of the meat and sauce. I prefer the fajita marinade by Tyler Florence on the Food Network website. Thanks for the recipe though, it's always fun to experiment.

yum. yum. yum.  My family loves this recipe.  I use the meat as is in the recipe but we serve it with a little pico de gallo, green taco sauce and cilantro on a softened corn tortilla.  YUM!  My spanish husband loves them.  Tastes just like the taco stands.  A+++

I live in a city where there are taquerias left and right. I am not kidding when I tell you that these are a million times better than any taqueria around here. My boyfriend said he'd pay for marinade like this.  I only wish I had made double the batch.  There were no leftovers!

Soy sauce??  I was very hesitant when I saw soy sauce in a marinade for a mexican dish - but so glad I gave it a try!!  The only change I made was to add a heaping teaspoon of adobo seasoning and some fresh chopped cilantro. My whole family loved this recipe and, believe me, that's saying a lot.  Since my kids prefer to keep things simple we I skipped the relish and salsa puree.  I cut the meat into tiny bite size pieces (like our favorite local mexican restaurant does) and then marinated in the fridge - stirring every so often - for about an hour and a half.  I then drained off most of the marinade and cooked the meat in a non-stick skillet over high heat a third at a time.  Definitely a keeper!

This is my absolute favorite recipe on allrecipes. My husband is from Southern California and it's hard to find good carne asada on the east coast. He LOVES this dish. I tried the sauce the first time I made it and although it was terrific, it was simply too much time to make so I now purchase the fresh salsa from the vegetable section. I use this marinade on chicken and it turns out SOOOO good!!! When I make these tacos, I now do half flank steak and half chicken. It's really great and I thank the contributor!

We live in So. California, with a huge mexican influence, and love this recipe!  I've marinaded it many times for camping.  I'll be making it for our traditional mexican feast this New Years Eve!  This recipe is as good as, if not better than, any carne asada you can get at mexican grocery stores!!  I always use flap meat from Costco and follow the directions exactly.

Perfect. I added habanero hot sauce to the marinade because it wasn't hot enough. I also skipped making the chili pod salsa and instead used a specialty hot salsa that worked well. This dish was so flavorful. Yum.

I moved to Michigan from Los Angeles and have learned to make the foods I miss from home.  I have tried many recipes and this carne asada has very authentic flavor.  We grill a couple of flank steaks at least once a month and there are never any leftovers.  I marinate for at least 24 hours and grill on high heat to sear in the flavors.  An extra clove or two of garlic is a must, as is the onion/cilantro relish.

This was great.  The marinade is the best part.  Will use for many other recipes.  We did not care for the salsa from chili pods, no flavor.  The onion cilantro lime salsa was great.  My butcher had no flank steak so I opted for london broil.  Next time I will use a serloin.  The recipe says to cook down till liquid is almost absorbed.  I cooked the meat in a wok for about 7 minutes with a lot of liquid left and it was a little overcooked, just pay attention to it.  We could not find cotija cheese so I used montery jack.  Will make again.

OMGosh!!!  This is wonderful!  If you are looking for authentic tasting carne asada tacos, look no further!  Followed recipe to the "T" and came out wonderful.  Can't wait to make again.  I might try Beef Round because flank is not cheap, and it tasted so good, we wanted more meat.  Thank you for a terrific recipe!

I just made the marinade for the beef because I was pushed for time and wowser!!!!  This was sooooo good.  I served on soft shell tortillas with colby jack cheese and pico de gallo and these were amazing!  I will try and make them as written as soon as I get a chance to.

5+!!! I dont even know how to describe how absolutely wonderful these tacos are. My favorite food definitley has to be Mexican food. I have been searching SO long to find a good recipe that was like the "Taqueria Style" tacos. This is it. I will never make my tacos another way again! I have used both beef and pork. Both are great! Thank you for this recipe it will be in my recipe box forever!

DELICIOUS! I only used this recipe for the marinade, and it was very good.  I wouldn't change anything to the marinade. I added chopped green onions to the marinade and used Flap Meat instead of Flank Meat. I only marinated it for about an hour.  The onion, cilantro, and lime relish was excellent.  I made my own roasted pepper salsa.  I will definitely make this marinade again.  Everybody LOVED IT!

This is a great recipe! I have been at many taquerias and the tacos don't even come close to this recipe! I have made the marinade as suggested in the recipe, but once I forgot to marinate the meat. I decided to brown the meat on the stove on low in the marinade. It come out great! I actually liked the meat better that way, rather than marinating it! Great tacos! Thank you!

This recipe was wonderful.  I was a little worried about it, seeing as to I have a husband, and 2 kids that are really picky and don't care for spicy food.  But, they LOVED it, and asked when I was going to make it again.  It came out tender and the flavor was superb.  All the spices blended together beautifully and the ultimate result was an authentic tasting taqueria taco!

muey bueno!! This is a terrific recipe. Since I discovered it, I have made it repeatedly & given out the recipe right & left. Marinate as long as possible & do grill the meat. The roasted salsa is marvelous. The contrast of flavors & textures-cool/crisp & roasted & spicy smooth is fantastic!!

Wonderful!  This was challenging for my just-starting-out chef skills but worth the effort.  I used dried Ancho chili peppers instead of the "New Mexico Chili Pods" for the roasted veggie salsa, which produced a rich, complex tasting salsa.  I also served this with fresh guacamole made with the same salsa.  I recommend marinating for the full eight hours and try to get bakery fresh corn tortillas - available at local Mexican bakeries.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFULL!!  I live in San Diego and often go to Mexico to eat street tacos-and these are them.  Take you time to make the roasted pepper salsa, because regular salsa on this taco is an abomination  :)  The onion relish plus the roasted pepper salsa compliment this dish, and make it authentic!

Great!  I have to agree with the other reviewers.  If you want to save time, use store bought salsa.  Use skirt steak (tenderized) instead of flank.  Grilling it is the only way to go -(I finished it off on a skillet though).  Meat has to be marinated for a while - 1 hour is too short.  I recommend at least 8 hours.   Cilantro, onion, the corn tortillas, and the cajeta cheese is a perfect combination with this!  Muy bueno!

Mmm, mmm good.  For as much work as this recipe calls for it's simple and fast.  The flank steak was delicious.  The onion/cilantro relish was good.  But no one cared much for the roasted veggie salsa.  I think that it was too spicy for some and too toasted/roasted for others.  I would make this again but just the steak (and probably use a cheaper piece of meat too) and intead of the relish and roasted salsa I think just a regular fresh salsa would be perfect!

Really loved this carne asada recipe and have used it faithfully whenever time allowed.  However, in a pinch, one can make an excellent carne asada recipe in less than 20 minutes by simply grilling your steak (skirt steak is the best) with lots of soy sauce and olive oil along with generous splashes of lime juice and adobo and onion powder.  I did not believe it would be as good as this but had steak in the fridge needing to be used and it was almost 100 degrees where we live in Oregon this past week (who wants to grill in 100 degree weather after a 10-hour day at the office?!).  My shortcut was just as good, perhaps even better, and took me far less time.  So, while this recipe is great, don't knock your shortcut methods as well!

Excellent flavor! I mixed everything together, used an immersion blender, then put all of the blenderized marinade with the meat in a slow cooker. Let sit overnight in fridge to marinate, and then cooked the next day on slow for about 6 or 7 hours. Delish! Thanks for the recipe!

Great marinade! I changed it up by taking one lime out and adding orange juice, and threw some cilantro into the marinade then blended. Let it set for about six hours on six small top sirloin steaks and the flavor was awesome. I have used a similar marinade which incorporates chipotle for fajitas. Will definitely do again.

Only change I made was to use a little less soy sauce and vinegar...marinated for 4 hours and it turned out fantastic!  Next time I will grill as whole steak and cut after cooking...

I served this at a Cinco de Mayo party, used the marinade for about eight hours, and my husband said it was restaurant-quality!  Got raves by everyone and this recipe got passed on - thanks!

I was so excited for this but in the end my meat just tasted like soy sauce... Followed the marinade recipe exactly and it was just too much soy sauce. I didn't taste anything else. Wasn't very carne asada tasting... I get carne asada tacos from the trucks near me all the time and this wasn't close. Sorry :(

Love these tacos! The chile pepper sauce made too much for our family, so we froze it and used it the next time I made this dish again.

I made this exactly as stated. I found the lime flavor very overpowering. Maybe I marinated it too long (overnight). Or maybe the limes I used were too big? It tasted okay, very citrusy and tangy, but tasted nothing at all like street tacos in my opinion. I probably wouldn't make this again.

This is my family's favorite meal! In their eyes there is no better taco and I have a 7 and 4 year olds. Over the many times I have made this sometimes  I cut out a lot of the extras and just use the meat marinade. The meat is perfect and really tastes best using flank steak. Thanks so much for this recipe!

These are the only tacos for my family. The cilantro relish I add a dash of salt to taste. I use it also for tilapia, they're the only fish tacos my wife will eat now!

This marinade is amazing! To keep it simple I didn't actually follow the rest of the instructions, so my rating isn't entirely fair. But I figured there might be other folks who just want to keep it simple sometimes. I marinaded for 8 hours or so and then grilled the meat and cut into chunks for tacos. So yummy! I also halved the marinade since I only had about 1 1/2 lbs of meat.

I only made the marinade in this recipe. The carne asada came out very tasty! My family really liked this. It's kind of a lot of ingredients and a little time consuming putting it all together but, it was well worth it. The flavor was great. Thank you! :)

O.m.g. these are too die for and they are totally worth the work. I do alter the numbers of pepper pods and jalapeños because my kids (2 and 8) don't like it to spicy. These are superb!

Not bad! I've had my eye on this recipe for a while, but the seemingly lengthy prep involved kept me at bay. To my pleasant surprise, I discovered that this comes together rather quickly if you make this in steps (so don't let the marinating, toasting, blending and chopping scare you away!). Although tasty, I really do wish I would have used flap or skirt steak tho.... I was hoping for a taco similar to my local taqueria's beef tacos, but this was only slightly like theirs. HOWEVER, leftover meat was the BEST part of this recipe (and was the makings of SUPER yummy empanadas)!!! While I'm not sure I'd make these tacos again, the meat / marinade is a winner in my book. Thanks for sharing, STANICKS. :-)

I really like this recipe!! I am a Los Angeles native, and have moved to Pennsylvania in recent years. I live in a small town where a good Mexican restaurant is referred to as Taco Bell. (I couldn't believe that's the only thing they have here!!) Not one, single Mexican restaurant. When I first made this, I fell on love. Whenever I make it my friends seem to show up hungry. Never fails. We all love it!

Love the marinade! I added the flank steak to the marinade before work and grilled it when I got home.  It had great flavor! I used another salsa to cut down on time, but next time I will definitely try that too.

Made a few small changes and this was ABSOLUTELY phenomenal!!!  Replaced ONLY ONE of the limes for the marinade with one orange - so instead of two limes, one each lime and orange.  Let it marinate for about 4 hours and cooked on high to mid-rare, strained the meat from the pan and let it rest on a cutting board.

Also roasted the tomatoes etc for about 35 minutes rather than 20 as they didn't seem ready.

Lastly - and this one is an ABSOLUTE MUST, especially as a healthy alternative to the carbs that come with flour - nstead of soft shell tortillas,  I used fresh Romaine lettuce spears as a shell.

It gets a little messy so grab a few napkins and just get after it!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Tons of flavor, even if you don't marinate the meat for a long time. I added more garlic (since I grow my own) and less soy sauce (too salty). No white pepper, just coarse grind black pepper. With fresh guacamole and tomatoes from the garden, it's taco heaven! Even my guy (who is not a big fan of Mexican food) thought this was awesome!

This recipe is GREAT. I didn't change ingredients at all. I mixed the dry spices together and used them like a rub. Let the meat sit overnight and then added the liquids like a marinade early in the morning. Grill outside to sear and then wrap in foil and bake low(250) for 3 hrs. The meat is so tender this way. Love it! Thanks for a great recipe

It's very nice to see Mexico's tacos are starting to get close to authentic recipes shared on the internet. Almost a decade ago after my first trip to Mexico City in 04, I came home thinking about nothing but the tacos.... Everything else was easy enough, onions check, cilantro check, corn tortillas check, fresh made salsa verde check (or the hot red salsa if you prefer) limes check, salt check, glass bottle coca cola check, but could't find a marinade recipe to save my life at the time. Even trying to google queries translated to spanish gave me nothing to work with. I was living in a heavily hispanic populated area of my city, the "Mexican-American" people that I talked to either had no clue how to marinate and season pork or beef to get an authentic Mexican taco meat, or just didn't want to let the desperate pale German in on their culture's secret recipes!

Now there is a lot more on the internet written on how to season & marinate, thank god.  

A good taco recipe? yes.

This was a very good recipe.  I reduced the vinegar to about 1/4 cup and grilled the steak instead of frying it.  Also, I used my own salsa and guacamole.  Next time I will let the steak marinate overnight.

First of all I don't understand why it matters if you are Mexican or not when you try this recipe? Do you think all white people can make a good hamburder or fried chicken? Second, you must know Mexican food is different is Ca. Az. Nm. and Tx. So I don't care about your location, because I grew up in Ca. and now live in Az. And I prefer Ca. Mexican food much more. As for the recipe, I think it is great the way it is, it is a matter of opinion and taste.

Second time was the charm.  I had some white pepper this time and we keep the reduced sodium soy sauce around.  I ran the marinade through the Vita Mix before added the doubled recipe to six pounds of flap meat. It soaked for around five hours, last hour or more out of the fridge.  Cut the salt if you use regular soy sauce.  I will probably cut out half of the salt next time.  It was right at the edge, anymore salt would have been too much.  Be prepared for smoke off the grill with the oil on the meat.  We have made the skirt steak/ flap meat tacos many times but this batch was the tenderest and least dry batch ever.  I used more Jalapenos in the sauce but gutted them to reduce heat.  More flavor less heat.  We made additional salsa which was the final touch to finish them off.  Puya chilies prepared the same way the New Mexico Chilies are prepared, then added to cooked Tomatillos and roasted garlic or raw your choice.  The Vita mix grinds it up nicely, and cilantro is a nice choice, but you already have cilantro, onion, and lime mix.  Chili Arbol if you want a little heat.  This sauce really made the flavor great.  The sauce will be dark red to orange if you have used enough chilies.  Be sure to thoroughly cook Tomatillos before grinding the sauce.  You may prefer the Puya Tomatillos sauce.  My neighbor from Mexico introduced me to this sauce.  They would use the stone bowl and pestel to grind the chilies.  Vita Mix is easier but it makes the sauce less chunky.

Best tacos ever!  Forgot the jalapeno and couldn't find the dried New Mexico chile pods, but it was still awesome.  Flank steak is still on sale, so we're going to buy more and make this again with the jalepeno.  Love this recipe!

I think this is an excellant marinade for beef. The only thing i did different was made the spices ti 1 1/2 times the amount and added the zest of one line. I marinated some top sirloin staeks i needed to cook for 2 days and grilled it to medium and sliced it in thin slices and ate it on flour tortillas. This tome i am going to marinate a tri tip roast for three days and roast it and slice thin. I love this marinade and will be using it quite often

I marinaded our steak for 8 hours and grilled the meat. We all agreed it was flavorful. I didn't have enough time to make the relish, but used fresh salsa from the store. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  The marinade is great as-is, sometimes I do add some orange juice too.  I use skirt steak (it's generally cheaper at my store) and it turns out awesome.  One thing that I do, is cook the meat in SEVERAL small batches.  It gives each piece a nice char.  Great recipe!!!!!!

I used the first two recipes (Carne and relish), and my husband and I couldn't get enough!!  I had some venison in my freezer so I used that rather than flank steak, and we had flour tortillas but those were the only deviations.  The flavor is perfect and can be made spicier if preferred which is great because my husband likes things spicier than I do.  I'm making it again tomorrow with flank steak and corn tortillas.  Be sure to get lots of limes because that (in my opinion) is what ties it all together.  I used my Braun hand mixer which made the combining of ingredients a lot faster than the whisk.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Don't tweak the marinade.  This is ridiculously good.  Everyone always has an adjustment or their own spin on recipes.  This is tried and true.  I've probably made this a dozen times in the last year without straying from this mix.  People rave about it.  Probably the best marinade for this cut of meat that I've ever tried.  Get it going at least 4-6 hours in advance for max effect.

I came across this recipe for Carne Asada for our Cinco de Mayo Party.  On a whim, I followed the adjustments that Cook4mycrew suggested (using the skirt steak/"flap steak" from Costco.)  We let it marinate overnight and threw it on the grill as guests started to arrive.  This was easily as good as the best Carne Asada I have had in restaurants, or that friends have picked up pre-marinated from the Mexican markets.  Since we had fewer guests than we anticipated, we didn't cook all of it.  We briefly thought about freezing it and bringing it to a potluck next weekend, but then we decided it was so good we wanted to keep the rest to ourselves!

Followed the marinade as written and it was EXACTLY what I wanted to eat!  Cooked the meat on the BBQ grill and served with fresh guacamole, fresh pico and a lime cilantro rice.  Loved these so much, can't wait to make them again.

Quite bland and not worth the time and effort to put into it. I tried a different recipe that was less time consuming and a lot more tasty. I thought with the extra ingredients that this recipe would be even better but instead it was a disappointment.

Great blend of dry spices in this recipe. I use them to flavor just about any meat when I want a Mexican flavor, e.g. ground beef, pork, chicken, etc.

I love this recipe. I once had the cantina taco at Taco Bell when they were serving it and of course was not very impressed, but felt it COULD be a great recipe if done correctly. This recipe is almost perfect in my opinion. I did do a few here and theres and it turned out great. 

Like a lot of users I substituted the flank steak for a higher grade meat and opted to use a sirloin. Marinated  the steak for a couple of hours in the sauce, but added some fresh oregano, parsley, ginger, and Worcestershire sauce. After the marinade was done I cooked it correctly on the grill (room temp, seared, flip once, let stand 10 mins before cutting) instead of in a pan. 

I felt the whole meal was great, but lacked a little crunch. It was mostly soft mush, tiny crunch from the onion, and a firm bite from the steak. To fix this I thought for a while and decided to try a vinegar based slaw to give it that bite. It worked wonderfully as the vinegar worked well with the marinade and gave it a little more substance. 

Seriously after I did this I was shocked how well it tasted. Don't forget the limes on the side to drizzle each bite.

I am purely rating this based on only the meat marinade. I used a different salsa recipe. I put the flank steak in the crock pot, along with all the spices (doubled the fresh garlic) and about 1/4 cup of water. Set it on low for around 6-7 hours and it was DELICIOUS!! It was so tender, flavorful, and moist! It was a big hit with my family.

The flank steak is amazing grilled after the marinade.  So simple and nothing makes me hungrier than the smell of roasting tomatoes and peppers coming from the kitchen.  I really enjoyed the vegetable toppings and the cheese is a great compliment, not the point of the dish.  My husband says he will request this one.

Loved loved loved this receipe. My husband couldn't stop complimenting me about them..made me feel good, like a gourmet chef or something. I added shredded cabbage, radish, grilled onions and a mayo-chipotle sauce, like the local taco stand did when I lived in CA.  Now in ND, have to make this stuff myself

We made the recipe without any tweaks. I would recommend sautéed onions. It would've completed the meal. It needs a few tweaks in my opinion, but was very good as it is.

One change... I used good quality (Central Market) flour tortillas instead of corn, as I don't like corn tortillas. I crave these constantly now!

We (my husband, my mother and myself) LOVED this recipe! It was so flavorful with just the right amount of heat. Although it does seem like a lot of ingredients and that it would take a lot of time to prepare, it really comes together quite easily and besides for the marinating, pretty fast. I added an avocado and it was divine. I will be making this again.

These tacos turned out awesome. I ended up purchasing NY strip and Flank cuts of beef to compare (price was roughly same), and I thought the flank was a little tough even after marinating ~ 7 hours, and cutting thin strips against the grain. The NY strip, on the other hand, was extremely tender, so this is what I plan to use in the future.

Wow..... that is what I can say about this recipe! My husband and I have been looking for a carne asada recipe for years. We normally try a recipe and then change it to fit our taste, but we will not be changing anything about this one! We have made it three times now, letting it sit for 6 hours each time and have loved it every time! This will be a weekend special at our house for a long time!

My husband lived in Mexico for 2 years and is a big fan of "authentic" Mexican food. He said that these were definitely up there. We BBQed the steak and then chapped it up into small pieces and then fried it quickly in a very hot pan so it had a smokey BBQ flavor and the little crispy bits that he loves in tacos and that you would get at a taco stand in Mexico. We will definitely be making these again.

These tacos were absolutely delicious!  I used skirt steak instead of flank, and only marinated the steak for about 3 hours.  The flavor was awesome.

The meat marinade and the onion relish were fabulous.  The chili sauce wasn't my favorite, but everyone else raved about the entire meal. We've decided to have it for others when entertaining going forward. Yum-Yum!

Fabulous!  I just used the marinate from this recipe.  Served it on flour tortillas with my homemade gaucamole and grilled onions and red peppers.  The meat was so flavorful.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I have been searching for a good  carne asada recipe and thanks to this website I found it.  I had tried a food network cooks recipe that had called for orange juice and lime juice but it just tasted to sweet.  This memorial weekend I made it and it was a hit with my pico de gallo.  Who would think vinegar and soy sauce would make it taste so original like mexican resturant quality.

These tacos were outstanding!  My husband requested that I add this recipe to our dinner rotation.  The marinade would be great for any grilled steak, not just in tacos.  I loved the onion relish too. Wouldn't change a thing, except maybe to add jalapeno to the onion relish.

I'd been craving the flavor of "fajita steak" that is served at several Mexican restaurants in the area, but I didn't want to pay what they charge, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  OH. MY. GOODNESS.  This is sensational!  I marinated it about five hours and cooked the steaks over low heat on the grill and served it with a garden salad and corn on the cob.  YUM!  I can't wait to serve this to my grown kids and their families.  I'm sure I'll eventually get around to making the entire dish with the tortillas and everything, but the steak by itself was incredible!  Thanks for sharing!

I made it for some friends this weekend and they thought it was awesome.  Says it serves 16 but 10 people cleaned it out!  It was that good.  And it was easy to make (bonus).  

I followed Pinky's advice and used the blender to make the marinade and to marniade overnight.  Thiadvice is definetly worth following.

Team this recipe up with fresh made Pico de Gallo and Bob Cody's Guacamole (both from AllRecipes.com) and you will ahve a HUGE hit on your hands.

The carne asada was pretty good.  The onion/cilantro/lime relish was fab.  I'd rather make my own salsa with canned tomatoes than the roasted salsa...it was only okay.  The carne asada wasn't exactly what I was looking for - Will tweak it next time, but overall very good recipes.

We loved this!  The marinade was perfect - much better than the pre-marinated stuff you get at the grocery store.  With warm corn tortillas and all the fixens' - really hit the spot.  I made it exactly as written, but added a little sliced avocado to top each taco off. YUM!

I would give the carne asada itself 5 stars, but the salsa only 1 star. It was much too thick and just didn't taste very good. Next time I make these, I'll stick with the meat and the relish but skip the salsa. These would be wonderful with strips of sauteed onions and some guacamole on the side instead.

The carne asada was juicy and tender. I liked the salsa (?) but I was the only one. I will make this often butI will buy twice as much carne asada!

This was a wonderful taco recipe.  I made the recipe as stated and didn't change anything.  I was a little skeptical about the salsa, but the combination of the salsa, onion relish and marinated meat was really very good!  My family loved it and we will definitely be making this again.

This is AWESOME in a crock pot!!!! I made it the first time as the recipe reads and it was good not great. I read a reviewer that mentioned the crock pot and I have to repeat it is AWESOME! I tried it with chicken this time, cooked it on high for 3 hours. I can see this with any type of meat, was tender and flavorful would highly recommend!

I've made this twice now. Once for my birthday, which went over massively well, and today because it was sooo good then! this time I used a roast, marinated it in the pot and slowcooked it for 8 hours. Soooo tender I could shred it with a fork.  Thank you so much! Will use this from now on!

I don't care if it's an authentic recipe or not, it's FABULOUS.  Great flavorings and other than the spiciness of the salsa, I have no complaints.  If you aren't one for spicy, cut the jalapenos down some and WEAR gloves while working with them.

Super delish! I marinated chicken breast, shrimp and skirt steak with this marinade.  All of them turned out perfect.  CHANGES: I decreased soy sauce to 1/4C.   added 1/4C. orange juice. omitted the white pepper and used canola oil and used skirt steak (more fat)

I LOVE this marinade! The meat is so tasty and I will never make american style tacos again after making the recipe. I only make the steak with the marinade and the onion mix. I use bottled hot sauce, guacamole, and some fresh lime juice and that's all.

I used only the marinade part of the recipe. It knocked my socks off. I found one but I'm still looking for the other... It may have joined its brethren departed from the clothes dryer. My wife liked it too, as did our unborn child. Thanks to the recipe author for a wonderful evening.

We adore the onion relish and will add it to every Mexican meal we make, but everything else was nothing special and not really worth the long list of ingredients.

Delicious! Followed suggestions from Cook4mycrew on March 11, 2007 (sort reviews by "most helpful"). Only used marinade ortion of recipe and used thin-sliced chicken breast. We grilled them instead of using a skillet. By far my favorite chicken marinade for tacos or burritos! Your search for an asada marinade will end here!

I thought the carne asada part of these tacos was absolutely delicious. I wasn't such a fan of the two salsas also included in this recipe. If I did it over again I would probably just make the meat and buy salsa from the store. But, it was still worth it.

This is a great recipe. We really enjoyed it. I modified it though. To make the flank steak more tender, I roasted in it the oven @ 300 for 2 hours. I then chopped it up and flash fried it w/the marinade I had drained off before roasting. In addition, I modified the salsa. I used a single chipotle chile instead. I love the smoky flavor from this chile pepper. The salsa has a quick bite at the beginning, then it is all flavor afterwards. The onion relish/salsa adds an additional element. A final note, I like cotija cheese, but if you don't like the smell/flavor of it (it is strong and pungent) then use montey jack or a sharp white cheddar instead.

I thought this was pretty good.  I dont think the meat tasted authentic but it had good flavor.  I think it was the soy sauce that made it taste different.

One of my favorite recipes on this site!  I buy "carne asada" meat at a local store, marinade for 24 hrs, and grill the thin slices quickly on a hot grill.  I cut them up with kitchen shears and serve on tortillas with all the fixins.  Delicious!

I only used the marinade from this recipe and the meat turned out great.  I cut back a little on the soy sauce and marinated the steaks for about 3 hours.  My husband choped it up into little pieces like a real taqueria.  We top our tacos with minced onion, cilantro and my favorite homemade salsa.

Delicious. I only made the meat and did the regular American taco night with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, salsa and sour cream. I also used the Costco flap meat as people have suggested. Tender, juicy. I grilled the meat instead and sliced it after it had been cooked. This was a big hit. 5 pounds served about 13 people. They just ate it up.

This recipe is fabulous.  We have made as written several times and it is a favorite!    The last time, I tried to be adventurous.  I used half the marinade on the steak and refrigerated the other half.  I seared the steak on my griddle until medium, then let it rest.    I fried about 6 strips of chopped bacon (separately).  I then sauteed the cooked bacon, chopped onions and peppers and with about half of the reserved marinade.  We sliced the steak and created our tacos, adding avocado and cheese.  My husband drizzled the left over marinade on his tacos.  If you take anything else from the recipe, the marinade is worth 5 stars alone.

The marinade was absolutely perfect. The flavors were on spot. I actually cut the steak pieces into strips before marinading just to make it a little hassle free the next day. I marinaded the meat over night and it turned out very flavorful. I actually used this for fajitas and not tacos, which turned out wonderfully. I also made the salsa/sauce to go along with it. I toasted and dipped four new mexico chile pods in water but ended up using only 2 since the jalapenos had enough heat. Even with only 2 chile pods in the salsa, it turned out pretty spicy, but excellent flavors due to the roasting of the vegetable.

My family loves Mexican food and this recipe was top notch and very easy to do.  I cooked the meat on the grill outside instead of what the recipe called for.  There were no left overshere!

This recipe was awesome!  So easy to make.  I subsituted chipotle peppers for the dried peppers and it gave it a smokey taste.  Yum!

Bueno!  I made this for my very finicky fiancee and he loved it; said it was the best thing I've ever made.  I made the recipe for 8 servings and followed the measurements exactly combining all of the marinade ingredients in the blender; added a bit of cilantro since I had it on hand for the other salsa.  The cilantro gives it a wonderful taste and it was a way to make my fiancee eat something green!  Put it in the crockpot for about 5 hours and then grilled the meat before slicing and putting it back in the crockpot with sauce to become insanely tender meat for tacos and burritos.  Made the cilantro/onion salsa and the roasted tomato salsa, both were phenomenal!  I can't wait to have a taco party for my family.

My family just loved this recipe.Was told that it's the perfect blend of spices even by my finicky daughter. I would like to add though that most of it can be prepped the night before saving a whole lot of time. I will be keeping this recipe as a staple for our family.

"Asado" means grilled (or roasted) wo I went ahead and grilled the meat instead of frying in on the stove.  Excellent!  Tastes similar to the taqueria tacos I used to eat all the time in AZ.  Also good in a carne asada burrito:  just add meat, pico de gallo, cheese and guacamole.

I knew the soy sauce was an odd ingredient for a mexican dish, but gave it a try anyway.  Did not turn out well at all - too salty and too much lime.  Nothing like the real carne asada I get when I'm back in my home town of San Diego.

If carne asada is served in paradise, this might be the recipe that's used. I think the best results for this marinade come with a thin sliced flank steak but it is a winner no matter what you do.

This is a very good recipe.  Like other reviews, I thought it was salty.  And by the way, they do use soy sauce in Mexico.  However, I think next time I will try a little more vinegar (or water) and a little less soy.  I added about 3 times as much seasoning as was called for.  I used at least 12 garlic cloves.  The roasted salsa was very easy to make and worth the effort.  This is a definite make again.

I'm giving this 5 stars only after following the advice of other reviewers, but it IS a very good basic recipe.  I cut the soy sauce, subbed half a lemon for the lime and added orange juice for the marinade, didn't make the salsa (we didn't eat it with any so why bother!), and the best part: I used 2 jars of canned beef cubes (home canned) in place of the flap or flank steak.  That cut down on needing to marinade, I just added the marinade into the pot along with the beef, liquid and all, from the mason jars.  I simmered this on the stove for ~30 min while I made Mexican rice and viola', dinner was ready!  By simmering, the extra liquid evaporated and what was left was concentrated flavor... sooo yummy!!    Half of our kids are half-Hispanic and this is a very authentic recipe that our 7 year old remembers eating from when he was much younger.  Almost exactly like an authentic Mexican restaurant nearby.    I can't wait for leftovers!

I have been making this recipe for years and I am just now commenting. It is my favorite, I substitute 1 lime for an orange to add a little sweetness. I also use this with chicken.  Just a great recipe!

Excellent!!!!  My family loves it.  Its fast and easy to make any time.  I've marinaded it for as little as 20 minutes to several hours and it tasted wonderful.  I wouldn't change anything with the recipe.  The meat comes out super tender.  I have my own recipe for pico so I've never made the one in the recipe.  I've sauted onions and added this with meal and made fajitas.  Yummy, thanks for the great recipe.

I just used the recipe for the marinade as well to make typical mexican restaurant carne asada.  I used a thin cut carne asada beef.  I found that for this cut of meat the marinade is a bit too salty and lacked a mexican spicey flavor.  I only marinaded the meat for about 30-45 minutes.  However, it still tasted GREAT.  We served it with store bought salsa, guacomole, sour cream, black beans & rice (by Robyn Webb on this site), refried beans, and sauteed onions and bell peppers all wrapped in tortillas.  It was a very tasty meal nonetheless.  I will try this one again with the reccommended beef cut as well as following the recipe to a T. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, we enjoyed it.

I have made theses taco’s many times and will continue to make them. I lived in the San Diego area for five years. These taco’s remind me of  the taco’s I use to get at little mom and pop restaurant in Imperial Beach. My wife loves the New Mexico chili pepper sauce. After the taco’s are all gone she will eat the sauce with chips. I always cook my steak over a good hot charcoal fire.

I only made the meat and not the relish.  The meat recipe was excellent and I will use it over and over again.  I don't know if it was "authentic" or not, but it didn't matter...it was GREAT!I had never used flap meat before and it was fantastic. The only slight modifications that I made were that I used white balsamic vinegar, reduced sodium soy sauce and I grilled the meat whole (just a few minutes on each side) and then I sliced it.  Everyone loved it.  The taste was incredible!  I would recommend NOT substituting the corn toritallas for flour.  Even my family, who have only ever had flour tortillas, loved the corn tortillas for this recipe.

These were great and not difficult to make. I would eliminate the salt though because the soy sauce already takes care of that. I added just a little bit of taquila in the mix too. Great tacos! Cheap too for a big party!

This the recipe I've been looking for.  My hubby has been going to Mexico on mission trips the last few years and comes back each time talking about the Carne Asada.  I've tried several recipes and he LOVES this and says it is so close to what's he had in Mexico.  I've not made the salsa yet, but want to try it.

My husband and I have been using this recipe for the last couple of years and it is soooooo good! There is an amazingly good "taco truck" where we live and their food is so good and authentic, however, I like these carne asada tacos even better than theirs! Everyone we've made these for is always impressed. We even use this as a fajita marinade and it works great for that. Thanks for the awesome authentic tasting recipe!

Fabulous!!!!  I did make one major change, used pork instead.  We had a pack of pork steaks and thought to give them a whirl.  Was a bit nervous, but trimmed the fat, took out the bones and all was good.  Marinated them for about an hour then covered them (with the marinated) with foil and baked them at 300 for about 4 hours.  They just fell apart.  The sauce and relish were both great too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Are you serious???? The marinade for this recipe is out of this world!!!! It didn't smell that good to me at first, but after we cooked it and I tasted the meat, I almost died of bliss! I made some homemade salsa/pico de gallo to put on top. FABULOUS!

This recipe was outstanding.  Even my most picky eaters loved it.

To save time, I prepared the salsa and relish while the meat was marinating.  Then once the meat was cooked everything was ready to go.

I only followed the recipe for the marinade and it was INCREDIBLE! I used skirt steak and chicken and marinated them both overnight. Both were just as taasty and a huge hit! Oh, we also grilled them rather than cooking them on the stove - delicious.

Exceptional.  Definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe except I reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 and the oil to 1/4.  The other thing I would do differently next time is probably to reduce the New Mexico chili to 3 pods because 4 pods had too strong of a flavor.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

This marinade is awesome. Perfect flavor. Followed to a T. I even tried it on some chicken breast, and left them in it for 3 days (not intentionally) -- they were amazing too. I also made the salsa (half the chili amount), and used the cheese suggested...we love flour tortillas, so we warmed them up and added a slice of avocado inside (which gives a good creamy texture). Also the next night I stirred the leftover salsa into a dish with white rice, red beans, and sliced beef sausage ( also delish). 

Got to do it!!!

This is definitely the best taco recipe we've tried in a long time.  I did not prepare the red sauce, but did make the onion garnish and use the marinade without making any changes.  It's not quite the same flavor as the Taquerias in our area, but it is different in a good way.  I found it pretty easy to prepare, and am anxious to try it in a crock pot as others have suggested. We'll be making it again, that's for sure.

The meat marinade smelled wonderful and my husband said the flavor was good.  I didn't care so much the skirt steak, next time I'll try a different cut.  It seemed to be more like a fajita though.  I think maybe next time I'll use the marinade and put the meat in the slow cooker then shred it instead of slice.  I did not have time for the other sauces in the recipe, I was really only interested in the marinade.  Overall, a good start

I have made this many times ....it gets better every time.  The last time I made it I sliced up the meat and let it "soak"
for an hour or so then I put everthing in the crockpot.  beyond tender!

I'm from San Diego here in the Southern most of California along the Mexico Border. There are hundreds of Taqueria's here in the county. I had made this recipe to try something new and it tastes nothing like Southern Cal Taqueria style Carne Asada. I see no relation at all. The soy ingredient leaves too much of a salty after taste. It tastes like the flavorless/bland Mexican carne that you would find in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and other Western states. So Cal has a distinctive taste and style that no other place cooks like when it comes to Carne and Mexicano food in general. I give you kudos though for posting this recipe.

For my husbands 30th birtday he requested some good steak tacos like the ones he used to eat every week when we lived in south Florida. I knew I didn't stand a chance, but decided to at least try this recipe. I basically only used the marinade portion of the recipe.  I was only able to let the steak soak for an hour then we cut it and cooked it on the stove over medium heat. I served them in the really small sized flour tortillas (like the restaurant in S. Fla)with lettuce, tomato, shredded cheese and sour cream.  I found that it really didn't need any other flavoring (I'm usually a taco sauce junkie) and the flavor it had on it's own was AMAZING.  I served it with yellow rice and the refried beans without the refry from the site topped with shredded cheddar (like the restaurant)  My husband was FLOORED and so I was (never having enjoyed the restaurant version myself anyway!)

Thank you for the trip down memory lane.  This will now be a staple in our montly meal rotation.

this was good. the only thing i changed was a 1/4 cup of soy sauce to erase the saltiness read from other reviews. i used this as a fajita marinade instead of tacos, with red/green peppers and an onion and it turned out surprisingly tasty. i marinated for 2 1/2 hours and it turned out fine. i also boiled the meat for 3 minutes in the oven, tastes so much better than pan frying and more health concious as well. we didnt use the salsa or onion relish, just homade guacamole! would give it five stars, but with other things inside the tortilla, be it fajita style or not, its hard to pick out the flavor of the meat, so it just tastes like alot of veggies with slightly seasoned meat. will keep as a reference recipe though.

I can only award this recipe 3 stars, and here is why:

I followed the recipe exactly, which is usually not my nature at all but considering the rave reviews, I went with it.  The meat smelled delicious the entire time it was steeping.  I made the salsa ahead of time with all of the ingredients, roasted to perfection, and pureed as instructed.  I made the relish ahead of time as well to give the lime juice time to get inside of the onion.  Everything smelled and looked great: fresh, colorful, incredibly appetizing.

I put the meat on to cook--still smelling wonderful.  I plated everything expecting one of the best Mexican meals I've ever made.  Final result?  Eeh.  It was ok.  I can see how some people might be crazy for it, and I might've been also if the salt was reduced (I did use reduced sodium soy) and the salsa was made spicer.  I wasn't bowled over, however, by the flavor and was disappointed.  I had very high hopes as I was prepping the salsa because it really smelled outrageously good.  Ultimately, though, the texture, the flavor, and the meat was not impressive.  

I'll file this one under "won't make again, but worth a shot."

I have one word to say about this recipe....WOWWEEEEEE!!!!!  I didn't think that four people could almost 3.5 pounds of meat (esp since I had to use rump roast and not what was asked for).  My husband and our friend kept going back for more and I just had a little bit left by the time they were finished.  Our stores do not carry any of the suggested meat, so the butcher told me that I could use rump roast.  By itself, the meat wasn't all that great....but you put it in the tortilla with all the fixins and WOW!  The only thing I didn't use was the pods because we don't carry those here.  It was an amazing meal!  GREAT recipe!  My hubby is already asking that I make it again and we just had it last night!  All the prep time is worth it!

I've made these twice now and i have to say the second time is what made me write this! The marinade is very flavorful and made the meat so tennder. I'm not crazy about the salsa, maybe because of the New Mexico Chili peppers. Excellent recipe overall and will definitely be making these again. My picky kids even liked them!

Loved it! I substituted the white pepper for a tsp. of Lime Pepper. I added dried cilantro and onion salt to the marinade instead of making the relish, but I'm going to make it next time! This was a hit!!

We made tacos with the meat on the grill and it was good, but not authentic (from SF, so picky with our Mexican).  I would cut the vinegar next time and use only the lime juice.  Made our own salsa from black beans & corn from the farmer's market + rice & queso fresco.  Not bad for a weeknite!

Awesome, these are truly the best.  I added a litttle dark beer to the marinade for extra flavor.  We also combined the extra meat and onion mixture that was left over added cheese and made steak quesadillas that were awesome too!  Will definitely be using this recipe again.  We didn't make the salsa.

This was only okay. I wish I marinated the meat longer than an hour to get more flavor. My guests did not care for the salsa puree. It was not chunky enough and very spicy. I recommend only using 1 jalapeno. I will try this recipe again just marinating the meat longer and maybe omiting the salso puree.

Delicious!  I broiled the marinated steak five minutes each side, cut into thin strips and served on top of a spinach and romaine salad.

Excellent recipe.  My husband and I loved it and ate every bite.  Flank steak is best for this recipe since it comes out very tender.  I also didn't have dried chili pods, so I used chili powder instead, which came out just fine.  I will make this again and again!

I haven't tried the "relish" part yet but I have used the marinade several times and it is WONDERFUL!  I doubt I will ever use another recipe for carne asada tacos!

I just used the marinade and thought it was outstanding.  I made tacos for company and many asked for the recipe.  We grilled the meat.

These are excellent; filled with flavor. You could use just about any cut of beef for this recipe as long as it is cut to size. They are wonderful. My husband is from Mexico and he was very impressed!

The only thing we use in this recipe is the marinade.  We even fry up some onions and peppers and make fajitas.  It is the most amazing thing.  Everyone has to atleast try the marinade, we used it on london broil.  We love the meat warm and cold.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as it said and my boyfriend didn't necessarily hate it, but he said it was entirely too salty.  I omitted the salt too because I figured that much soy sauce would have plenty.

Delicious. This is the closest I have found to the incredible taco shack around the corner from my house. It is to die for. I served it with the Quinoa with Black Beans recipe from this site. What a killer combo. You must try it! Mmmm.

Can't find anything wrong with this one. Very authentic, especially with the onion relish and the pureed roasted chile sauce. I grilled the flank steak however (love the smokiness from the grill/less kitchen mess) and sliced it thin. I guess you could boil down the marinade as others did (kill that bacteria!) and pour it over the sliced steak, keeping it warm in a crockpot or warming dish, but with an overnight marinade and quick grilling, the meat was tender and delish, even cooled. Muy excellente!

Excellent! I made these exactly by the recipe and everything was delicious -- the marinated meat, the salsa of roasted vegetables, and the relish, topped with the cotija cheese. I will definitely make these again.

This review is for the marinade part only:  VERY VERY GOOD!  I skipped the white pepper b/c I didn't have any, and I marinated the meat in the fridge for about 5 hours.  I only had beef chuck which I cut into little cubes after it was marinated; it was still tender and juicy!  It was pretty easy to make too! 

I make my own salsa similar to what the recipe called for, so I cannot comment on the salsa; although it sounded great.

This is the best carneasada recipe I have ever tasted. It was big hit at our house.  Lots of compliments from friends who grew up eating the real thing.  I rated this recipe a 4 because I think that the cumin flavor was to strong and I will use half a teaspoon next time.  It's a keeper. I can't wait to try it on chicken

This is a great recipe!  I loved the marinated beef and the onion relish and would not change a thing with either.  The sause with the roasted veggies was a little bland.  I think some addtional spices and maybe some sugar might help to give this sause a little more zest.  Overall, these tacos rock! the beef is so tender, let the meet marinate for as long as possible (overnight).
Thanks for sharing

Oh my these  were sooooooooo good! The marinade was one the the best I have ever tasted. The meat was so moist and yummy! The salsa was also excellent but the relish had waaaay too much onion. Next time I would uses two large tomatoes and maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 of an onion.

Awesome! Better than restaurants!  Used pre-sliced 'stir-fry' steak, marinated 8 hrs, grilled both meat and flour tortillas, served with cilantro, red onion slices, sour cream, avocado, rice and black beans, delicious, thanks for a terrific recipe!

12/06 edit:  I've used this many times since I found it.  We LOVE it!!!  I have cut the soy sauce back to 1/3 cup and the sea salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I've used many different cut of beef and it always is great.  (I've even added the marinade sauce to groud beef for tacos - just let it simmer as the meat browns.  Wonderful too!)  After it's been marinading overnight I throw the meat and marinade in a pan and cook until the liquid is absorbed.  We now use the relish everytime we have other mexican dishes.  I want to try it in the crockpot next.  

Original review: These are the best carne asada I've ever had!  Loved the recipe.  I actually used tri-tip steak since I had it on hand and marinated it overnight.  The relish was good and sauce was fantastic!  It takes some time to do it all, but it was so worth it.  We will use this recipe once a month or so!

Just served this to friends, one of whom said he "doesn't like" Mexican food. However, after dinner he said he would eat in my Mexican restaurant anytime. Followed directions exactly, only let the meat marinate 2 days because dinner was delayed. It was still terrific. Everyone raved and we will definitely be doing this again regularly.

WOW!! Five stars are not enough.  I don't think I will make tacos with ground beef again! The marinade was wonderful.  I used flank steak and let it marinate overnight and I cooked it on the grill.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  I did not make the roasted salsa because I could not find any NM peppers.  I made some homemade pico de gallo and these tacos were gone in minutes!

Wow!  My husband usually doesn't get too excited about many of the recipes, but the first words out of his mouth was... "fantastic marinade".  It was great. My kids loved it also.  The only thing I would change is the cut of meat.  I might try sirloin or something else.  Flank is not my favorite.  As other reviewers stated they didn't like the "salsa", I didn't bother making it.  I made my own.  Yum!

This is the best marinade for steak tacos that I've ever tasted!  People are constantly asking me for the recipe after tasting my carne asada.  Often I substitute the flank steak with carne asada steak from the market as it is much cheaper.  I also use this marinade on regular steaks (omitting the cumin) and they are also delicious.  This is definetly five stars!

I love this recipe!  I've fixed it twice in the past week, and it just keeps getting better.  The only change I found that I needed to make was the salt.

I don't know if I did something wrong the first time, but the second time around, I didn't add any salt at all.  The soy sauce (Kikoman) made it salty enough.

Grilling does make a huge difference too.

These tacos are AWESOME! My 10 year old asks for them almost daily. I made the salsa the first time and thought it was OK, but everytime I've made them since I've skipped the salsa. I love the taco with the onion cilantro relish and some extra lime. Muy Bueno!!!

Muy sabroso!  Living in LA there is a lot of good authentic Mexican food, but this is one of the BEST homemade taco recipes I've tried.  I made them last night for my boyfriend, and we both loved them.  Followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing.

I followed the marinate recipe but used Top Loin steaks and also used on Chicken breasts then grilled.  FANTASTIC!  I also made the onion/cilantro/lime juice recipe and I've used it on other things not just from that night!  I made this for company and everyone loved it!  I'll def use this marinate again!  THANKS!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  My husband is a huge fan of carne asada tacos & I finally found THE recipe.  I used flank steak & marinate for at least 24 hours if I can.  The onion relish is amazing, especially with a little extra lime juice.  However, the roasted salsa makes the taco!  I don't use the chili (because my two year old eats with us) & I add cilantro to the other veggies before roasting.  These are the best tacos & the only way I make them now.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I love this website.

Very good recipe!  We grilled the flank steak first then diced it and pan fried it, spritzing with a little extra lime jiuce and some garlic salt at the end.  It was delicious!

This was my first time trying an authentic mexican meal.  We had a host of friends over and everyone thought the recipie was fantastic.  I did the marinade around 9:00 am and did not cook till about 7:00pm so the meat was wonderfully flavored.  I used sirloin steaks instead of flank because of the price.  I also cut the steaks into strips before putting them in the marinade.  We barbequed the meat also.  If you are a lover of cilatro the relish could use more.  The salsa is not that hot so don't waste the seeds from the chili pods.  Great recipie will use again.

WOW! That was my hubby's reply. Mmmmm was my 9 yr old son's. My 3 yr old son didn't like the meat, but he will learn to love it cause this was a huge hit! It was very delicious and full of flavor. I made everything as written except I used top sirloin instead of flank steak, as it was way too expensive.  I sliced the meat first then marinated for 5 hours. Oh so tender!  Next time I will try marinating the full slab then grilling the meat before slicing, as I believe that will further enhance the flavor. The roasted pureed salsa was also delicious.  It had a smokey, roasted, spicy flavor w/o being too hot (I did remove the NM chili seeds before pureeing but may keep them in next time). A little goes a long way. This is going to be a staple in our household for sure!!!

I made this for a last minute get together.  Everyone loved it. Take the time to make the roasted pepper sauce and onion salsa. Its worth it. I didn't use the NM chili pods because I couldn't find them but used habenero and jalapeno instead. Excellent!

My wife loved this recipe...worth the work and time.  For a hotter salsa, I used 5 dry chile de arbol (found in your mexican aisle) instead of the NM chile pods. Used guacamole and black beans to accent the tacos.

Fantastic! I did a few things differently, to suit our tastes: left out the onion relish; used chipotle peppers in adobe sauce in place of the chile pods; used a can of pre-diced hot jalapenos; added about 4 large cloves of garlic to the roasted vegetables. We also used flour tortillas instead of corn. Also, I used my food sealer to seal the meat and marinade in a jar, and marinated it for about 4 hours. The best part (other than the super-hot sauce, thanks to my jalapeno choice) was the cotija cheese - what a delicious surprise!

This recipe looked so complicated I held off making it for awhile, but was actually not that time consuming, especially since half the work is done a few hours before. I rate this a five star because of the marinade, it is WONDERFUL!  I will use this again and again.  The cilantro onion relish added a nice touch and mellowed out the too-spicy-for-me salsa.  I will use less new mexico chile pods next time, that ended up being too strong in the salsa.  All in all it was excellent, but will change up salsa next time.

This recipe is fantastic!  Authentic and deliceous!  Everybody loves it - young and old.  Lots of work, but worth every minute.  I did replace the roasted veggie puree with salsa on a camping trip and it was quite enjoyable, but for the "real deal" take the time and do it right.  And don't be afraid to marinade overnight!  Thank you Stanicks!

Turned out well, but took too long to make. Start to finish, it was about 2.5 hours. Plenty of leftovers which will keep 'till it's gone. This is a good one for bachelors who like to cook. Not so good if you don't want to spend much time in the kitchen.

This is a great recipe, I add lime zest to the marinade, adds another dimension of lime. I recommend grilling these over charcoal, letting it rest, cutting it then sauté on griddle to crisp it up.

I recently prepared 25 pounds of beef skirt steak for a party using this recipe and it was the hit of the party. I only made the marinade (step 1) and then grilled over mesquite lump charcoal which gave it oh so much more flavor. There is a local Taqueria chain here in AZ that is known for amazing mesquite grilled foods and I'm proud to say that my carne asada blows theirs out of the water. I've never had so many compliments of how awesome the smoky mesquite flavor brings to the meat. Perfect recipe!

Fantastic!  I made a half recipe, and I was concerned about a soy saucy flavor,so I reduced it slightly.  Turned out great!

 Note:  3 or 4 habaneros also thrown in for the salsa kicks up the heat nicely.

I used the marinade for steak burrito's. The meat had amazing flavor. . No changes were made to the original recipe except for cutting the recipe in half for 1 lb. of meat. I marinaded the meat for 6 hours and cooked on a hot grill.   Layered sliced meat, Mexican rice, corn salsa, cheese, black beans and sour cream for delicious Chipotle style burrito.

Amazing!!! This is a delicious dish. Only thing I changed was more salt to the salsa and cilantro.  The meat was delicious!  I also used quest Fresca for the cheese because you can’t go wrong.

Made this for a party of 38 and it was a hit. Per others recommendations I used flap meat. I have never made this before so I can’t compare this to another recipe or flap meat to flank steak, but based on the results I probably never will try anything different. I cooked these up on a flat top griddle on high and then sliced thin across the grain. Incredibly tender and flavorful. Just one word of warning, recipe shows this making 16 servings (or 3 oz per serving) so I tripled the recipe. We had no leftovers so I would recommend estimating this serving 12 (or 4 oz per serving).

This just didn't turn out well.  The steak looked really good when cooked and got a beautiful sear but when we ate it there was a strange film from the marinade on it.  The chili flavor was a bit overpowering in my opinion.  Disappointed.

This marinade was wonderful. Made it with no changes. Even my two picky eaters loved the steak. I cooked my steak in a hot cast iron skillet and then let it rest before slicing. So tender and great flavor. We will certainly be making this again.

Excellent flavor. I used lean, thinly slice chuck roast.  I will reduce the amount of salt next time.

I was torn on how to rate this. The meat was absolutely phenomenal. The only changes were that we soaked it in Coke prior to the marinade and grilled it. The salsa on the other hand was absolutely inedible - which is saying something in my family. I’ve decided it was the chili pods which ruined it, the flavor was abysmal.

This is my go-to recipe for carne asada, and everyone in my household loves it, especially the homemade salsa.  I originally got this recipe from Genius Kitchen and was happy to see someone posted it on Allrecipes.  I omit the cotija cheese and I can't stand raw onions, so I also skip making the onion relish.  For more tender meat, top sirloin is also good.  Using flank steak is good if you want to have leftovers for later in the week.

I didn't have time to marinate any steak so I just added the vinegar, soy sauce, minced garlic and seasonings to a skillet with leftover sirloin that I had cut up real small and let it cook down until the liquid was gone. Ohhh Myyyy!!! These were the best tacos I have had in a long while and the best ever homemade! This recipe is definitely a keeper. (Now I'm trying it to flavor some chicken for my Arroz con pollo).

I just made the marinade/meat in this recipe.  It was really good! The only thing I did differently was use chipotle chili powder instead of regular.  I think next time (and there will be a next time) I'll either use low sodium soy sauce or regular soy sauce and omit the salt. It was just a little too salty,  but didn't stop anyone from devouring it! Thanks for the recipe!

These were unbelievably salty.  It is 3 stars, because I may have screwed something up.  I’m going to try with a different cut of meat that isn’t pre sliced and see if that makes a difference.  Unfortunately I am nervous about going it, because we had to pretty much completely throw this meal away and eat a frozen pizza.

I love this recipe and have used it for years.  I just got a new Grill so here we go again.  I add a couple of tweeks but I basically follow the recipe.  For the two limes juiced, I use one lime and one lemon both juiced and zested-add zest to marinade.  I also add the juice of one orange (or a 1/4 juice).  For the chili powder, I use Chipotle (Or Ancho for a milder heat, more smoky flavor) and I add 1 t. of granulated toasted onion powder (Penzey's).  I also only use Flap Meat.  I feel this is is a tad more rounded in flavor with the extra citrus notes.  I only sometimes make the new mexico chili sauce but quite often I just use something store bought.

It wasn't bad. Instead of spooning the "salsa" over the meat I  simmered the meat in it, then served with a slotted spoon.

I used this marinade on some shaved beef I picked up at Trader Joe's, and it was a hit. I reduced the recipe amounts because I had less meat than called for. Just used the proportions as a rough guide  - used a little less vinegar to suit our tastes.

We use this marinade at least twice a month for flank steak, chicken breasts, or chicken thighs and it always comes out so good and flavorful.  We usually start the marinade first thing in the morning and get the meat on the grill for dinner.   It's absolutely delicious.

This is actually a really good marinate and how it is done in Mexico.  By using all dry ingredients to marinate for two hours, cooking it outdoors over  hickory not mesquite, then dicing the meat into small eatable pieces, you will have authentic Carne Asasda tacos less the work that this video made it to be - Cheers!

The marinade was amazing! Has anyone tries to use the marinade with chicken? If so, how did it turn out?

My husband and I have been looking for a Great carne asada recipe and we’ve finally found it! He made it for dinner tonight, followed the recipe, no substitutions. He did forget to put the white vinegar in. We grilled the meat on our Traegar grill. FANTASTIC!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was pretty good. I will make again, but add a few adjustments to tweak to my family's tastes. Also, I paired the taco with a jicama slaw (recipe on this website) and the combination was really good, especially with a slice of avocado.

Had friends over last night and made these tacos. Everyone absolutely loved them. Used rump steak, as didn't have any flank/ skirt in UK supermarket. Cut into small cubes & marinated overnight...tender & delicious! Added in a bit of guac too. Nicest tacos I've had since last went to LA.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It was a cross between Mexican street tacos and Asian tacos, more on the Asian side.

I slice the meat before putting in marinade, and let it sit about an hour.  Gives more flavor.  Other than that, this recipe is spot on.  I absolutely love it, and everyone I've invited over thinks so too!

This is my go-to marinade for steak. We love it so much that we call it “the clutch marinade.” The only thing I do differently is include the cilantro in the marinade and blend it before pouring over the meat, like another reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe and tip-we love it!

I made this recipe with skirt steak instead of flank steak only because Albertsons was out of flank. Overall it turned out really really good. The marinate was amazing and added a lot of flavor to the meat. Super good recipe and super easy to make. Will add this to our weekly meal plan for sure

I wish I would've paid more attention to the reviews and cut back on the soy sauce. I feel like this should be served with stir fry vegetables. I also was at a loss for fresh tomatoes / jalapenos...so I put a can of tomatoes/fire roasted chilies / jalapenos and one fresh onion with a pinch of sugar. I must say, this worked well however, the soy sauce was major prevalent in the flavor of the meat. Oh yeah, I also grilled the meat. Cheers!

The meat was excellent, rave reviews from everyone.  Marinated for 7 or so hours, we grilled ours with charcoal then cut it into pieces.  I didn't love the salsa, it was just ok but may have done something wrong?  (it's also not vegetable season) The relish was a hit with all, even the kids.  Will make again.

The marinade is spot on and the salsa on top made with two chipotle peppers in adobo sauce deseeded instead of the jalapeños and dried peppers made it perfect. A little guac on top evened out the spice. This was SO good!!!!

I loved this recipe! The only thing I would change is I wished I had trimmed the flank steak before seasoning it because the meat was somewhat tough where there was still fat. I also would love to try it again but in a slow cooker so the meat would  be more tender. Other than that, flavor was good and the toppings were great!

This recipe, the marinade especially, is an excellent recipe! The beef is so tender & flavorful, you won't want to have steak tacos any other way! The first time i made the tacos & the salsa was for a get together at my home with several members of my husband's family. I didn't want to go the easy route & just order pizza, so i decided on a taco bar with steak & chicken tacos. This recipe was a hit with everyone, and my mother-in-law raved about the smokey chipotle salsa! To this day each time i make tacos my husband always asks if i'm making the "awesome steak tacos." I have the steak marinating in the fridge as i type this for tomorrow night's dinner, can't wait!

I made this for my husband, who is half Mexican, and he absolutely loved it! Of course he said "it didn't taste exactly how they did when I was growing up, but pretty close!" I will definitely be making these again. Only bad part is soooooo many ingredients. Excellent taste!!

I only made the meat portion, but it was awesome!!!  I made the marinade per the recipe.  Only change I made was to grill it on the BBQ.  Came out great.  I cut it all into little squares or rectangles and froze in baggies per how many tacos on mini corn tortillas we would eat for one meal.  Then I heated those small portions as needed.  We also garnished them very simply -- like they do at our favorite Mexican restaurant - with just chopped onion, salsa verde and cilantro.  YUM!!!

I just made this with seitan instead of meat. Skipped the cheese, totally vegan. I only soaked the seitan for about 15-20 minutes because it is all I had time for. Used storebought salsa and guac as toppings. Really quick and delicious. Will make again and again.

I thought this was very good but I did make some alterations. First, I wanted it shredded and I cooked it in my crock pot. I only used 1 lime and 1 clove of garlic for the marinade. I sliced the flank steak into 1 inch strips against the grain. I places the sliced steak into a zip lock baggie and poured in the marinade. I let it marinade for a day overnight for about 12 hours. I then roasted the onion, tomato, jalapeno peppers, and 1 garlic clove as instructed. I used Guajillo dried peppers soaked. In the morning I placed the marinated meat in the crock pot and poured the puree of vegetable and peppers over the meat and let it cook on low for 8 hours. Before serving, I smashed the meat and it shredded with ease. I love it this way on rice, tostadas and tacos.

A coment about Kraney's review. I would like to add a more objective point of view on her comments. I was born a raised in Los Angeles and lived in San Diego for many years. Now living in Houston. "Authentic" ethnic food is different in different parts of each country. Just like BBQ is different between, Texas, California and Minnestoa. 

Texans' love their Tex Mex, but I prefer the Baja and western Mexican style better - which this recipe is more inline with. Kraney's opinion, very much valid, but lacks perspective beyond what one would experience in Houston.

I made this for the first time tonight and the whole house LOVED IT!!! The marinade is the bees knees.  The one thing I did differently is I grilled the meat with chipotle peppers. This is now on our list of favorites.

Born and raised in Mexico and even though this is lot closer to taqueria style, this is not authentic and the flavors are way off. Now I am not saying it is not good. it tastes fine but do not think for a single moment that you are eating street food in Mexico when making this.

I thought this recipe was easy to put together.  I almost did not make the salsa, but glad I did.  You can make this recipe ahead of time (i.e. I did in the morning ) and when  dinner-time came  it cooked quickly.  I will definitely make this again.

I seriously could drink this marinade, it is that good!!!  I did not make the salsa part because I did not have all of the ingredients.

A great recipe with excellent results. My wife said it was the most enjoyable tortilla based Mexican food she's ever had.  The salsa and the relish were a big hit and kept the dish tangy and fresh in taste.

Changes:

I used home-add guacamole instead of the cheese and that tasted great, so perhaps that's an option for others.  I also added half a red pepper (not chile!) to the roasted veg .  Finally, I reduced  all the hot spices by half, since we prefer a slightly milder dish.

When I do it again, I'm going to try only frying the steak to a medium-done as opposed to well done.  To get the flavour concentration, I would separately reduce the excess marinade to a syrup like consistency and fry the steak in that.  I'll let you know how that works!

I am either the world's greatest cook or this is the best recipe ever! I have made it a couple of times now and hands-down it is the recipe I have been searching for.  Without a doubt this is my go to recipe. The flavor and taste are so authentic. Yes, there are a lot of steps and everyone of them are worth it!  What do I take a picture of? My onion relish, roasted vegetable sauce, Carne Asada meat on tortillas?   Whatever you do try this recipe and enjoy!

This is a great recipe! I made a few minor adjustments of my own and I let it marinate for 24 hours. ?? I also put it on the grill like we do back home in San Diego. We're having it again tomorrow because my mom is in town from SD. The meat is also good over fries or tortilla chips.

Holy Tacos, Batman!!!!  This is now my favorite of all the recipes I have tried on allrecipies.com!  I did make one change however.  With the acids of the white vinegar and lime juice, and the salt of the soy sauce, there is no need of the additional tps of salt.  I left that out of the marinade.

Just made this tonight as part of cinco de mayo dinner. Was only able to marinade it for 4 hours and was not able to find flank steak at my store (used skirt), but the flavor on the meat was amazing, and the combination with the toppings (which had just the right amount of spice to it) made it even better. The meat did come out a bit chewy, but I am blaming it on not being able to marinade it for a whole 8 hours. Only cooked half since I saw that it was way too much meat, but have the other half still marinating, will see how it comes out after a long marinade. Adding this recipe to my repertoire of recipes when we are feeling for some good Mexican.

This review is for just the marinade. I have made this marinade for carne asada a dozen times. I follow it exactly as written and it is wonderful. It's easy to throw together and I always have the ingredients available. Thanks!

My family did not care for these. The marinade tastes just like soy sauce and I even decreased the amount in the recipe. I will not make this again.

So very good!!!  My husband is Mexican and he is quite picky about his Mexican food and he loved this. I added a splash of orange juice to the marinade, used almost 3lbs of flap meat and marinated in fridge for about 10 hours. I made the salsa but I didn't like it much and we stuck to our "yellow sauce in a can" (Mexican tomato sauce, ducks on the can). I made guacamole and served with cabbage, tomato, cheese, Mexican rice and refried beans. Also, used white corn tortillas, fried in oil in shape of a taco shell but kept soft and flexible. It was soooo good. Next time will double or triple for our 3 teenage sons and 2 daughters.

So great!  I use it on chicken and Pork too!  Shrimp tacos would probably be great too!  I didn't have fresh limes on hand, so I used lime juice from the fridge.

I don't care if this "authentic" or not, it's the best  taco recipe on this site!  My partner prefers these to the ones at our local mexican restaurant.  The marinade imparts a wonderful tang to the meat and the onion relish and sauce give these many depths of flavor.  I usually double the recipe, put it in the crock pot after marinating overnight and freeze the leftovers.  We're having some of these from the freezer tonight.

I have to make the recipe and then divide it all in half so I can make a few adjustments in "heat" for my wimpy family members and add heat and a few tweaks in spices for my own tastes. I also find it much easier to cut the meat while cold before marinating. Saves time and mess. 
The first time was good the second time was GREAT!

Definitely will make again, very delicious. Made for a great Taco Tuesday. I enjoyed the salsa, could've been spicier (added 2 jalapeños instead of 1) but my roommates loved the roasted taste. I would recommend adjusting the roasting time for the vegetables based on personal preference (I went the full 20min but wish). Looking forward to trying the marinade with different types of meat. Thank you for the recipe!

This was AMAZING! My fiancé invited two of his buddies over for dinner and the carne asada tacos we made using this recipe were a huge hit! Everyone went back for more, and even asked to take some of the leftovers home. I followed the recipe exactly, and the only the only change I made was allowing the meat to marinate for 24 hours instead of the 1-8hr timeframe. I would highly suggest marinating it longer because the meat really soaked up the flavor. I will definitely be making this dish again!

I did use a yellow onion, and I used a 28oz can of whole tomatoes, drained and roasted with the rest of the veggies. The meat was phenomenal, topped with queso fresco. The salsa was mediocre; I would use less tomato next time. I will be making this again though!

Great taco recipe! It was quite the hit! I did find the meat tasted a little too much like soy sauce so I might reduce it next time and/or just marinade it less (I tried marinading it 24 hours).

I love making these tacos, and my whole family loves them as well. They are relatively easy to make, but make sure to allot yourself enough time to make the extra bits (salsa, relish) I also love to make some homemade guacamole to go along with it.

Followed the recipe exactly minus cilantro. Wish I had more of the salsa, it was GOOD. Marinade was yummy, might try adding some coffee or cocoa next time.

Love it, meat tastes just like the ones you get at a real deal taco house.  I haven't tried the sauces but I intend to soon. My one suggestion is to watch the salt content, I add the soy sauce and then add a pinch of salt. Other that that these are a home run! Thank you!

Carne Asada itself was good, but the relish and the salsa sucked. would definitely omit both of those steps next time.

We loved this. I marinated the steak for about 5 hours and it was so tender and flavorful. The only change I made was to substitute red and green cabbage for the raw onion in the garnish, because I don't like raw onion. Next time, I may slice the onions and cook them with the meat. Despite the long list of ingredients, this was very easy to make.

This marinade is incredible! This is my go-to for big BBQ parties! Instead of the salsa they suggest making, I serve these tacos with BOYS1 's Green Salsa.

Made it last night and it was exactly what we were looking for! Tastes like Northern California restaurant tacos :) I definitely recommend keeping a bit of the marinade and bringing it to a boil and serve as an extra sauce. Lastly, heating up the tortillas right after the meat in the same skillet gives them such a wonderful flavor, kinda like off the same grill. Thanks for the recipe!

way too salty.  Also it took a long time for liquid to cook off the meat so i would pull the meat pout the sauce and fry that with only as much sauce as you want.  It makes way too much salsa,so maybe half that.  I also wished the salsa had a fresher consistency 0 so wouldn't use that piece again.

Great carne!  Love the lime taste and everything else about it.  I have made it several times and have noticed a few things.  
1. meat needs to be thin.  I can't stress this enough.  Ive done it with Tri-tip, flank, skirt, and New Yorks, the cut needs to be thin!! I usually cook whole and don't cut into pieces until done.
2. The longer you marinade, the better it will be. DUH!!
I have served it to many, many family and friends, a couple of whom are professional chefs and one is a published cook book author.  ALL of them LOVED it!

Made these for my family and they could not stop eating them! Made as written with one exception, I cut up the meat prior to marination under the thinking the more surface area the more marinate the meat picks up. I will definitely make these again!

This was awesome! The only changes I made was, I used skirt steak because that's what was at the store and it was so tender. Also I used lemon juice and a splash of oj in the marinade.

Great dinner meal and made leftovers for the week. The marinade was perfectly seasoned. I did not like the onion relish and will probably forgo that the next time I make it. I served it with rice and seasoned black beans.

I  almost followed the whole recipe to the T.   Didn't have jalepano peppers so I added on top of the roasted veggies red pepper flakes. I had blended the marinade in a food processor like someone suggested. Marinated it for about 6 hours and used round thin cut steak. It turned out delicious.  Will definitely make again.

I wasn't able to marinade longer than 3 hours and that could be partly why I am not at 5 stars, but I do see a review for a crockpot and I feel like that would be genius for this recipe. With so much in the marinade, it definitely would be so good to have the flavors slow roasted in. The steak in the pan with high heat cooks away so much flavor potential. Good, though. I'd make again.

We have made this recipe so many times, I can't even count anymore! This is AWESOME! I do the marinade and give instructions to everyone to "poke the meat" with a fork and turn it over every time you pass it until grilling time. Then its my son's job to be the grill master. One important thing to remember about flank steak is to not over-grill it. a little rare-ish is better. Then chop it in small cubes for the tacos. My husband loves the fact that he can kick back with a cerveza and watch the magic happen.

Everything about the actual marinade and meat was delicious. Except the corn tortillas. Awful mistake. Should have stuck with flour ones. They were so dry that we ended up just piling the meat and other items on a plate and eating it plain.

This was ruined by the soy sauce.  Apparently it's way too much and overpowered everything, giving the meat a slightly sweet taste. The salsa was ok, although a little too spicy for my taste. That could have something to do with the size of the peppers.  And it needs more than a "pinch" of salt.  I put in about a teaspoon and it was edible.  

I wouldn't make this again.  Next time I'll make it with salt, pepper, and garlic on the meat, served with pico de gallo.

This was the best marinade and easy preparation, too! Every bit of it got devoured by my guests. My only variation was that the dried chili pods were unavailable in my area for the roasted vegetable salsa so I used chopped, fresh Anaheim chilies instead. Still came out wonderful. Can't wait to try it again when I can get the dried chili pods.
Thanks!

Good recipe, wouldn't say its authentic taqueria style though. My family still really enjoys it. I'm more of a plain jane no spice type of eater and it's got a little bit of a kick for me but still tasty. Definitely worth making!

I really liked this marinade but it was screaming to be revised in order to deliver authentic Mexican flavor!   

So, here's what I did.  I added a few tablespoons of tequila and doubled the lime (4 limes instead of two).  I also used a mild/medium Mexican chili spice blend instead of regular chili and this seemed to make a big difference.  Extra dried oregano as well.  And a few dashes of liquid smoke (optional).  

Post-alternations, it worked really well and the beef that we marinated this in was tender and had a wonderful flavor with a hint of tequila.  Because it was not too spicy, our three year old enjoyed it as well but if you like heat, add more chili.  Chipotle would give it a nice smoky flavor but it is a very very hot chili so be take it easy.  

Next time, I will cut the soy sauce in half and see how it goes.

If I could give this recipe 20 STARS... I would!! 
My favorite tacos de asada are from Tijuana. These are my #2....  They were on the salty side. I will be making them this weekend... This will be my third time making them. I an going to try the sodium free sit sauce as suggested by previous comments. I'll be using half reg./half sodium free. I have only made them on the grill outside. I wouldn't dare to make them on the stove too. Eww

Left in one piece and broiled it since I didn't want to get the grill out in all the snow. Fabulous! Can't wait to make it again over some coals.

We have made it many times now with multiple cuts of beef. I usually have tri tip on hand which is more tender than flank steak so I don't marinate as long. One of our favorite recipes!

Wreaks of vinegar (even though it's just a 1/3 C, it over powers all other ingredients).  I followed it step by step.  Didn't even like the salsa.  I doctored that up though with some cilantro, green onion, more diced tomato and some cayenne pepper.

This is my go-to steak taco recipe.  We use round steak and it doesn't matter if the steak marinates for an hour or overnight--the flavor is great every time!  This is the one meal where I can be sure there won't be any leftovers.  Love the flavor!

This recipe is delicious! Followed the marinade as written (minus the white pepper since we didn't not have this) and it was a hit! Next time I might cook the meat whole before cutting, but my family lived it!

I only had time to make the meat and it was to DIE FOR! Didn't have limes so I added a couple turns of lemon pepper. Marinated it for about 2 hours. Can't wait to make it with the other stuff! YUM!

It's not bad, I guess.  I thought it was a lot of effort, the cheese was overpowering, and the sauce was not very distinctive.  I'll stick to my local taco truck.

This is pretty good!  I definitely overcooked the beef, though that is my fault in taking the idea of waiting until "most of the liquid has evaporated" too literally.  Everything tasted dark--a little pico de gallo brightened it up.  Would happily make again, but won't be dying to do so.

This is hands down the best carne asada ever!  Our friends rave about it.  I live in a small town with no less than 15 authentic Mexican food restaruants... they need this recipe because none of them make anything close to this good!!!  We are staying home for dinner!

Hands down delicious! This is one dish that is "comfort food" for me, and my husbands loves it. Win-Win.  I marinate the veal skirt steak (very thin) for 2 days in the spice rub. BBQ it until it really done. Yummmmy

Fantastic!  I made this for supper club and am not even there yet...i hope this meat makes it over there without me eating it all.  I did the suggested edits of decreasing the vinegar and doing the half/half soy sauce.  I accidentally added the juice of two limes when I was following the edit of using orange and lemon juice.  But, it has a really great flavor, a little strong on the citrus side (my fault).  I do think this tastes like some of the tacos I've had from the taco truck.  I also made the onion/cilantro/lime side which I have not tried as I cannot eat raw onion, and I made the roasted veg salsa. My edit: I BBQ'd the veggies. I chopped the tomato, left the garlic whole, quartered onion as directed, but sliced the jalapenos down the middle and only deseeded one of them.  I left some of the seeds in the New Mexico chilis and my first taste of this is HOT! I love it!  I will no longer be buying the salsa taquera from Herdez...it is that good. (Ok, I'm lying, I love the salsa taquera)  Great recipe!

I have made the meat several times for work potlucks. To make it easy, I just take Spanish or Mexican rice to eat it with instead of all the taco fixings. Everyone has always loved it and asked for the recipe.

These were GREAT made with carne asada!!  they have a wonderful flavor and the “relish" is really, really good.  The paste... not so much; it lacked good flavor and gave the tacos a mushy "feel."  Luckily it was an add-on that could be left off.  I will definitely fix these again and would recommend them.

This was absolutely excellent. I used the marinade and the roasted veg salsa. I had to spice up the salsa as I found it pretty bland. Added some chili powder and cumin along with salt and pepper. 

The only change I made to the marinade was no salt...there is plenty in the soy to go around. The meat was awesome...served with the roasted veg salsa, guacmole, little sour cream and valentino hot sauce....perfect!

Don't let the reviewers scare you! This is really good. Of course I am from Indiana so I can't speak for authentic Mexican recipes, but if you are looking for a good flank steak recipe or steak taco recipe this is really good! Most reviews I read couldn't believe there was soy sauce in this but I made it as is and it tastes great! We made the relish but used regular salsa and shredded cheddar jack, sour cream and jalapeno peppers, and flour tortillas. Mexican rice and re-fried beans on the side-yum:)

Being Mexican and Puerto Rican, I was looking for a familiar and traditional flavor.  The meat tasted better than good but it wasn't what I was expecting taqueria tacos to taste like.  My boyfriend devoured it but when I told him that I was expecting it to taste like the "taco truck" he said, "Oh?!  Yeah, not like the taco truck but it was still good!"

A very good recipe.  Those that keep cutting back on the salt and lime, that is a big mistake.  The recipe as is, is very good.  I recommend cooking this over a charcoal grill, don't worry about draining off all of the marinade, the char appearance is great, and tastes great.

This was one of my first attempts at tacos. I loved the roasted tomato, onion, garlic and jalepeno sauce! The marinade in this recipe made the meat very flavorful, however I am trying to nail the taste of real, authentic Tijuana-style tacos. Every recipe I've tried so far overdoes the marinade. The marinade should give the meat a little bit of zing, IMO, but if you overdo it you will overpower the charbroiled beef flavor. Let the condiments give the tacos their tangy zip. If anyone has a recipe that more closely resembles the authentic Tijuana style I'd love to try it. Thanks!

I have made this dish several times now and everyone always likes it!! I double the liquids and add the seasonings to a plastic bag with the meat to marinate overnight. Then I add the marinated meat with the marinade to the crock pot and let it simmer on low for 4 hours or so, then remove from the crock pot, shred the meat, and then return it to the crock pot for another hour or so. I add fresh garlic as well!! The meat soaks up the marinade! Guaranteed not to be dry!! These aren't authentic carne asada tacos--carna asada is grilled, but they are still delicious!! 2 thumbs up!!

I have made this several times in the slow cooker, and it is always a hit!  The slow cooker shreds the beef for you and the flavor really sets in.  Delicious!

Time consuming but WORTH IT!! Yum! We made the sauce and kids preferred it that way rather than plain which was amazing because of the spice factor. Taste like like the taco truck and that's a compliment :) Thanks for sharing.

These were the best tacos I have ever tasted!  They were a little more time consuming than we cared for, but once we tasted them it made it all worth it!  There are tons of authentic Mexican restaurants around here, and I have always loved their tacos and died to know how to make them.  So when I stumbled across this recipe I thought they would probably be good but not near as good and these were worlds better and tasted very authentic!  These even beat all of the yummy tacos I ate in San Diego!  This is an awesome recipe!  Only thing I did different was I made my own home made tortillas which is really easy and I'm not even a Mexican ha ha!

Wow!!! Very authentic Mexican taste. Made this carne asada last night for dinner. Along with an array of relishes on the sides since he likes to mix his own. Mexican hubby loved it & was suprised that I could cook Mexican (well, I being Asian) He couldn't stop talking about it & was still talking about before I left for work this morning. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was AMAZING. I did chicken instead of the steak, and it was still fantastic. This is a family favorite. I dislike tacos greatly, but decided to try this for my husbands sake. And I could eat this once a week easily.

Really authentic.  Great with a little homemade guacamole.  I added cayenne to the salsa because we like it spicy.

Everything about these tacos are fabulous! Hands down the best tacos I've made/tried anywhere! The homemade salsa recipe is so good & leftovers can be used with so many other good mexican foods (ie chips & salsa, quesadillas, etc). Crumble extra cojita cheese & cut up extra lime wedges for a side with grilled corn - homemade pinto beans & you have the makings for a perfect fiesta!

This is the best carne asada marinade!  Served it several times at different parties and the carne asada is always the first to go and everyone raves about how awesome it is!

Wow this marinade for the steak is spot on! I turned out delicious. For ours we used black beans, guacamole, cojita cheese, sour cream and carmelized onions. YUM!

This recipe ROCKS!!   The onion relish and the roasted tomato and chipotle salsa are the perfect accompaniments for this wonderful, flavorful carne asada. We make this at least once a month.

The marinade is amazing! I used 1 tspn of red pepper flakes in place of the white pepper flakes and I used Beef Tenderloin Flap Steak in place of Flank Steak and it was perfectl. The Flank Steak was too thick when I tried it the first time. Love the marinade though!

First time I have reviewed something on here - so here goes!  The marinade for the flank steak was awesome - total keeper!  I used a 1.5 pound flank steak.  Just awesome!  I felt the sauce was so so, I have never had an authentic taco with a sauce like that on it - but I'm from Wisconsin, so what do I know....   My wife will eat anything and she didn't care for it much either.  I will skip that next time. I cooked half the steak in vegetable oil and half in olive oil - the olive oil cooked pieces tasted better.  We also added chopped tomatos, which gave it a nice touch.  The chopped onions and cilantro were awesome and a must on this dish.  The taco on a whole was on the dry side - so I need to find that last wetness ingredient to perfect it.  Any ideas for that - please let me know.  Otherwise, very much worth trying this recipe.  Thanks!

I love, love LOVE this recipe! I started out following the recipe as written but have since adjusted to our tastes. (My husband doesn't care for that much white vinegar, even though I loved it.) Really, that only involved reducing the amount of white vinegar and adding OJ as per another reviewer's suggestion. Very authentic and is my staple carne asada recipe.

Very tasty steak!  I only made the marinade, and left out the white pepper, because I had none. I also used smoked paprika for a bit of "smokyness" in place of paprika. I will definitely make this again, but will probably omit the salt. Having used Kikkoman's all purpose soy sauce, I think is enough. I also sliced the steak across the grain before marinating for just 1 hour.

Amazing! I made these for a baby shower, and everyone said they were BETTER than this Mexican lady who makes authentic carne asada tacos for a church fundraiser!   Made a second time for a get together at my house and they were devoured in no time! I can't count how many people have asked for this recipe.

Very good!  Amazing, in fact!  No need to change anything about this recipe.  My family loves it just the way it is!  I suppose you can deviate from it a bit, but there is really no need.  I have had Carne Asada tacos in Cabo, purchased from street vendors and this recipe would give them a run for their money for sure!  Definitely use limes, not lemons, as limes are more authentic to Mexican fare than lemons are.  The cojita cheese is  also a must.

Excellent! I'm a California girl who moved to Canada, and with the lack of good Mexican food up north I gave this recipe a try. It was incredible! The steak truned out great...we BBQ-ed it to medium and then diced it. Like a lot of other reviews, we had no leftovers!

this has good flavor, but I used the tips from other reviews. I used orange juice instead of lime, more vinegar and less soy sauce.

(Sings with Joy) Ye gods this was outstanding.  Can I say it again?  Ye gods, this was outstanding.  Marinated for 4 hours and I wish I had left in longer (I was cautious as I wasn't sure how spicy marinade would be and Man of the House has been suffering from my spicy cooking).  Only change was using my own Pico de Gallo sauce instead of the onion mix in recipe.  Thank you so much for recipe.

I've tried making Carne Asada from several places, but this recipes gives the juiciest most flavorful that I've tried.  I just use the marinade recipes from here with thinly sliced beef from a Mexican grocery store.  This is MUCH better than buying the pre-seasoned carne asada from my local grocery. Thanks!

This was great!  Loved every bite.  Will be making again.  I actually let this marinade 24 hours (I was only going to do a few hours but I ended up not cooking it that night so I cooked it the next).

Chicken!! I used this recipe for chicken and it's great! I substituted chicken breast for beef, patted down the chicken with the "rub", then cut the chicken into 1/2" cubes and added it to the marinade. I cooked the chicken in the marinade, then used a slotted spoon to serve. Leaving any cooked leftover chicken in the maridade overnight really enhances the flavor! I love the onion and cilantro topping. I did not try the sauce or cheese. I used lemons instead of limes as that's all I had. I would guess limes are even better, especially with the cilantro/onion mix. I used smoked paprika, which I often use instead of regular paprika. Twenty seconds in the microwave works perfectly for the corn tortillas. I added some corn for additional sweetness. Enjoy!

The salsa and onion relish were great. Very easy to make.  The meat was a little too vinegary for my taste. All and all it was a great meal. Easy to make.

We didn't make the entire recipe just used the meat portion.  Needless to say the meat was fantastic!  Will definately use for our fajitas!  OH, we used a new york strip so our meat was super tender.

this was easy to make, and a crowd pleaser.  i felt like the meat was a little chewy, but that could have been my preparation, which was big slices and pan-fried in a skillet.

Definitely a a 5 star dish! I marinated the meat only for an hour but still came out delicious. Make sure to get the right meat though because I used sirloin steak and it was a litttle chewy.

I love this recipe. The only change I made was to use ground chipotle chile because that is what I had. Next time I would leave out the salt as it was a bit too salty for me.

My husband found this recipe and it seemed like a lot of work.  Until we tasted it! Definately worth all the work andn dirty dishes.  The onion salsa is out of this world and everything is even better the next day.  Thanks for another great recipe on this site!

This is one of my most-made main dish recipes from this site, I love it! The marinade smells so good that my husband, bless his brave soul, decided to taste it despite the raw flank steak that was sitting in it at the time - he loved it even then, by the way.

I used just the marinade from this recipe.  Was going to make the topping with the cilantro and onion, but realized I was out of cilantro.  We marinated the steak for about 8 or so hours and it was a nice flavor.  all in all a very tastey recipe.

The carne asada marinade is  AWESOME! I added cilantro. Everybody ranted and raved how much they loved them. My husband is from Mexico and his mother cooks awesome mexican food. So when he said they were better than his mother's that was a Shocker!

Excellent marinade.  I used apple cider vinegar because I don't like the chemical taste of distilled vinegar, and I used all black pepper instead of 1/2 white pepper.   I really doubt that will make a difference in a marinade.  "Authentic" carne asada is cooked before being chopped up with a big cleaver.  If you are gong to chop it up before cooking, chop it before marinating.  Less messy than trying to chop it after and the marinade will get into the meat better.      Serve with radishes alongside, cut into halves or quarters.   Typically these are served with two corn tortillas per taco, like in the photo, but using just one tortilla cuts the carbs in half and doesn't seem to diminish the result.

Delicious meat marinade. I wasn't a fan of the salsa, but my brother loved it, so it's probably just a matter of individual preference.

For real Taqueria style tacos you really should use a fatty inexpensive (yet flavorful) cut of meat like thinly sliced chuck (or Diesmillo in Spanish).  I'm sure this is a tasty dish but I really doubt it could pass off as Taqueria tacos.  I'll be making this recipe soon :)

I will be making this for the second time tomorrow for our company potluck.  Really enjoyed the marinade, made it a lot more simple by just combining the tomatoes, lime, onions and cilantro to toss on top.  I did add avacados to a couple as well - liked them both ways.  Very fresh and delicious.

Good tacos.  My family liked it and my non mexican friends thought it was really good.  The fixings made the taco experience on this one.  I personally have had the taqueria stand carne asada tacos in my many trips to MX and this are good but not the same.  All that said it is a keeper as most people loved it.

I made this in the crock pot and the meat came out super tender! The taste was very good and we really enoyed the tacos, but I have to agree with other reviewers that it doesn't taste like authentic carne asada.  I am still giving the recipe 5 stars because it was so good.

Great!  I put everything in the crock pot- marinade and all and let it go on high for about three hours.  It was awesome and super tender. For the sauce, I made it as written subbing 2 tbs chili powder (bad bad, I know, but it was all I had!) and while the flavor was good, it was burn your tongue off spicy.  I like things that way but I was not so sure my dinner guests would, so I toned it down by adding a can of fire roasted tomatoes to the mix and a half bunch of cilantro.  It came out great!  The only other change I made was adding a diced avocado to the relish.  Served this all with refried beans and mexican rice from this site, and of cold mexican beer.  Awesome meal, thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe's marinade and onion relish and combined with the Oaxacan tacos from this website and they were delicious.  For the marinade, we reduced vinegar to 1/4 cup, soy sauce to 1/3 cup, and olive oil to 1/3 cup.  We omitted the salsa in this recipe and used grated queso fresco.  We added about 1 chopped jalapeno to the onion relish.  Bought a 1.33 lb. flank steak and cooked about 3m/side on the grill and it was perfect and served 4 people easily with leftovers.

Made this over the weekend for a party of 30+ people, and it was a hit!  If you are using pre-diced carne from the Mexican market, be sure to reduce both the soy sauce & salt by half to prevent over-marination, and only marinade for 30 minutes to an hour.  Thanks for the recipe!

The marinade was delish!  Didn't change a thing and it was perfect.  For the salsa I had to add lime juice, salt, and cilantro then we liked it.  Next time I don't think I will bother with the topping we thought the meat was so well seasoned it didn't need anything else.

I used tritip like a few people suggested instead of the flank steak ... the tritip was the best part of the tacos, it had lots of flavor. I'll make tritip like that again, but I don't think I'll make these tacos again. I don't know, it seemed like there was something missing to them. Maybe some lettuce or guacamole and or sour cream. People will say adding sour cream isn't all that authentic, but I didn't think these were very authentic to begin with. And yes, the "relish" does need a chopped tomato, and not so much cilantro, it's too overwhelming.

I made these Tacos for a Sunday Dinner and they were fantastic! I love the marinade, and will use it again. I subbed the Flank steak for a London Broil because it was on sale, I cut it horizontal before I marinated it in a zip-lock overnight. I also started the salsa with Rotel tomatoes and chili’s, then added the onion and Cilantro.  Will make it for guests!

This has good flavor, but definitely not an exact replica of the street tacos you get in Mexico- trust me, I am from San Diego! The salsa was super mild and I would recommend some major heat addition to kick it up.  The meat was tasty but not like the charbroiled kind off the street (you need a grill to get the taste...period!). The relish was yummy and for additional tang add some lime zest.  All in all a good recipe but there are better ones out there...try your own version!

Amazing flavor.  There are a ton of spices but well worth it.  I cut into bite size pieces after it marinate and then cook in a cast iron skillet.  This does add an extra step though.  Once the meat starts to cook a lot of the juice and marinade is in the pan.  I use a gravy spoon to spoon it out as I cook so that I can get a cook texture to the meat.  As long as you do this it tastes just like it was cooked on the grill.

This recipe is one of the best tasting carne asada's i've had. It also works very well with chicken. The longer you marinate the better, but even 2 hours works good.

Very good recipe. We used deer steaks instead of flank steak. Marinated them for about 6 hours and grilled them until medium. I cut them thinly and served them up. Flavors complimented the deer well. Onion and cilantro mix was good also, although rest of family didn't try. Cilantro is controversial in our family. Reason I gave it a 4 was the sauce. Not our family's cup of tea, I never even served it. Tasted like raw chili powder. Its a keeper for the rest of recipe though.

These were really tasty, tender, and juicy.  I used thin cut NY strip steak b/c it was on sale and flank steak is kinda pricey.  The butcher said it could substitute fine.  I recommend taking some antacid before you eat it though because DH and I both had some mean heartburn afterward ;)  Have already bought some more meat to make again!  Yum!

Can I give this one 10 stars?  This was freaking amazing.  I followed the directions exactly and it was amazing.  Good weekend recipe as it takes a lot of work and a lot of time. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

I used flap meat as well as it is the most tender meat I can find to use with this.

I altered this recipe alot because of lack of ingredients. I used only lime, onions, cilantro, and sour cream as toppings. Also, I despise corn tortillas so I used regular tortillas.  Next time I'll have to marinate for more than 1 hour (this was a spontaneous lunch craving).

I've used this marinade MANY times and it always produces a wonderful carne asada. It's very forgiving if you're missing an ingredient or 2- I've subbed OJ for lime, parsley for oregano and I always use about 1/2 amt of olive oil. The longer you let it marinate, the more tender the meat is since the vinegar tenderizes the meat. I ususally do the full amount of marinade with 1.5# flank steak, and double it if using a larger cut of meat. Made for 4th of July last year (soaked overnight) and it was a HUGE hit. I always grill it and usually just serve it the way our local Mexican joint does with sauteed onions and peppers, flour tortillas and do rice and beans on the side if we're really hungry. I've never made the relish or salsa before, but will definately try it sometime soon. I bet it would be even better that way, but the simplicity of just the marinade alone results in an easy, yummy, authentic mexican meal.  PS makes AWESOME quesadillas with the leftovers the next night!

This recipe is fabulous! I used the "flap" meat (I found at Costco) as someone suggested and followed the marinade recipe exactly, except for the garlic powder, since I didn't have any on hand. We loved it! My husband said "This is a keeper!" I agree. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Next time I'll try the salsa recipe to go along with it.

This recipe is amazing.   We usually go to a local Mexican restaurant to eat the carne asada.  Now, we don’t have to!  We buy a skirt steak and cut the pieces very thin.   We then allow the steak to marinade for an hour or so.   It really doesn’t matter how long you marinade the steak for, 30 minutes or 24 hours doesn’t make a difference.   This recipe is that good!   We grill the steak for a few minutes and have the perfect meal!   We’ve made for countless friends that agree!   This is better than any restaurant!  Ole’

This is a great recipe! I use half the soy sauce and cut the meat up into smaller pieces, marinate for 4-8 hours and cook it on the grill

We absolutely love this recipe, I printed it back when the recipe was for 3 pounds of meat which I prefer because if I did a pound at a time, it might not even last us all the way through dinner! I don't use flank steak, I usually buy a cheaper roast, slice in 1 1/2 inch slices and use a Jaccard meat tenderizer prior to marinating.  I remove meat as we cook it, slicing very thinly and quickly sauteeing until it's done.  The meat also freezes very nicely after marinated...my family loves this!!  Thanks so much for sharing.  PS...other than the type of meat I use, I don't make any other changes to this recipe, it's a keeper just as it is!!!

Oh my word!  This marinade is so delicious!  I didn't have any tortillas, so I just cooked up the meat as directed and served it with Spanish rice and refried beans.  DH couldn't get enough.  I didn't make the salsa, as I already had some of my own homemade salsa, but the meat was flavorful enough and we didn't even add any.  The cilantro and onion garnish was simple but wonderful.  Thanks for a new family favorite!

Very tasty, my family enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly - next time I'll try marinading overnight to see if more flavor will permeate the meat.  I did slice the meat before putting it in the marinade to cut down on the mess of cutting it after marinading.

This was very good...Although I dont think it tasted much different than regular carne asada...it was alot of work for what it was....delicious non the less. I used top sirloin steaks (cut into bit sized pieces so every peice soaked up the marinade). I also threw it on the grill instead of pan frying..i love that chard bbq taste and the meat came out VERY tender...melte in your mouth! The salsa is definatly a keeper...it was very hot and spicy...just the way we like it...it came out perfect. If you like spending time in the kitchen and want to go all out...i reccomend this recipe. You wont be dissapointed. :)

This is the best marinade I've ever tasted.  Everything about this recipe was to die for.  I would recommend frying your corn tortillas just slightly on both sides so they don't fall apart.

We are definitely making this again, it's going into regular rotation!

While I have never made the  whole recipe, I have used this marinade for beef, chicken and pork.  It is the BEST Mexican/Southwestern marinade I have been ever found. I have made a few alterations, nothing major.  I use fresh oregano and I add the chopped onion,fresh cilantro and 1 fresh chopped jalapeno to the marinade. Excellent!

Great flavor!  We live in California so you can find a Taqueria pretty much on every corner.  This rivals anything we can get at a restaurant.  When I make this I like to use a screaming hot iron pan (I even put the pan on my grill outside so my stove doesn't get messed up) and cook the meat in small batches.  The meat will have a crustier outside.  When you cook it all at once it sort of steams it and the outside of the meat is softer.  Either way, the flavor is terrific.

This is a great recipe. I grew up in Southern California with great Carne Asada but I know live in Ohio and miss great Mexican food. This recipe tastes as close to that Carne asada as you can get without flying west.

This was great! I did follow the advice of one of the reviewers and left out the soy sauce and added orange juice, cilantro and chopped onion. I only did the meat part of this recipe, marinated it overnight, and grilled it on high heat. Oh yeah, I didn't have paprika so I put in 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. It still was edible for my 6 and 3 yr old to eat. This tasted exactly like the carne asada we had in Mexico. Great job! Thanks for the reviews!

Taste is wonderful. I left out the onions because I dont like them. I added a 1 pasilla and 2 ancho chiles to the roasted blended salsa. Really wonderful, added some spice and smokiness. Made a simple tomato, garlic and lime seasoning and threw it all together. Really just great. I found one batch feeds a lot. I saved half and am using it tomorrow. The carne asada seasoning is so good, I think I will make a big batch of the seasoning blend so I can throw this all together quickly later. Yum.

The absolute best recipe for Carne Asada!
Make sure your coals are fiery hot and make sure you pat the meat to remove excess liquid.
Wow...seriously better than a restaurant!!

The meat marinade flavor is excellent. I was told to use skirt steak by our store butcher, which was excellent, but went in search of flap meat at Costco (per other reviews due to cost of skirt steak). I live in Arizona and Costco told me not all stores have flap meat, so what's the deal - since Mexican is big here! Anyway, bought tri trip steak (Costco) sliced thin and worked great. 
I find marinating at least 8 hours is best.

Absolutely fabulous!  I couldn't find the exact cut of meat, so I bought a similar cut.  We doubled the recipe and had plenty for lunch throughout the week.  And they are even better the next day warmed up in the microwave!  Thank you for this great recipe!

I served these at a July 4th beach party. There was a church group of 20-somethings there with us. At first they were shy to eat, as we did not know each other personally. But after the first taco went out, they returned in multiples! We even caught the attention of our neighbors next to us on the beach and fed them too! You can cook the meat ahead and just warm it up...it only gets better flavor. They were also requested for our vacation meal where each family contributes a meal. I love a receipe that everyone enjoys, and this is one of those.

Absolutely delicious.  I might reduce the salt a bit next time, though - I used light soy sauce & the meat still tasted a tad salty, but in the tacos it was great.

Wow, that was amazing!  I have been looking for something authentic (yet edible by my small children) and I think I hit the jackpot!  This was amazing!  I couldn't find a few ingredients so I used a few substitutes, but it still turned out perfect!  I used carne asada meat and I will stick with that for sure - it was PERFECT!  Delicious!  I am going to tell everyone I know about this recipe and will make it a regular on our meal schedule!  Thank you!!!!!

The meat was fabulous... great marinade! 

I didn't like the salsa, though, and ended up using a nice storebought one, instead. That was disappointing (and I had followed the recipe to a "tee").

Overall, though the rest of it was great, and I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

Wow, so many great reviews, but I had to add my own.  I made these last night, they were incredible.  I couldn't find flank steak, so I used sirloin, and grilled it.  Served with fresh, homemade salsa and grilled guacamole (my own recipe).  I am hooked, thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband for his birthday Friday. I was raised in S. CA so I grew up on good mexican food. We now live in MI and good authentic mexican food can be hard to find although it is getting better. ANYWAY! This was awesome! I made the meat using skirt steak because that was what I had and I also made the relish and hot sauce. It was all so yummy! The red sauce wasn't as hot as we would have liked but I am sure that was just because my peppers must not have been hot. I made enough for us to have left overs and we ate it for dinner Sat night too. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe I will definitly be making it again. I also mae mexican rice III from this website to go with it, another one of our favs.

I followed the recipe exactly and made all the sides.  It was great!  I will definitely be making this again.  A couple of things I will change:  I will marinate it longer - I only marinated for it about 4 hours.   And I will possibly shred the meat - I think it would be better that way.  I think maybe making this in the Crock Pot would be yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was excellent!  I used thin cut sirloin steak because I couldn't find flank, and made my own salsa.  The marinade for the meat was great.  Thanks so much!  Update - I made this for the third time, and finally found the cojita cheese at Wal-Mart.  It takes these tacos to a whole different level!  Take the time to find this stuff!

Five stars for the marinade - we didn't use the relish or salsa recipes.  My husband really enjoyed this, and we're looking forward to trying it again and again and varying different ingredients to best suite our tastes.  Really great as is, though! Oh - my husband grilled our flank steak, and it was perfect...I think that we'll stick with grilling it.

Great flavor! The longer you marinade, the better. I used flap meat and grilled it on the BBQ and it was excellent. Made the relish, salsa and an avocado sauce and served with corn tortillas and mexican style cojita cheese. Also grilled some mexican style corn-on-the cob from a recipe on this site. YUM!

This recipe is awesome!!  I found it on the website last year & make it often, my husband loves it!  He is from southern CA and loves authentic Mex food.  My only recommendation is to use skirt steak, not flank, much more flavorful & tender.  Cook whole after marinating & then slice.. mmmm.   I also love the cilantro relish but don't always take the time to make the salsa.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh my!  These are fantastic.  I went to a mexican market and asked the butcher for his reccomendation on which cut of meat was best for Carne Asada.  I don't speak spanish so I can't exactly tell you what I ended up with, but it was fantastic.  If you have a market like this by you, it is totally worth the effort.  I decreased the salt a bit after reading the reviews.  I grilled these up and then sliced them to serve.  Amazing!  The relish is wonderful. The salsa is totally worth the effort.  I only added one of the jalepenos to keep the heat down.  Still a bit too hot for the kids though. The salsa makes a ton. (about a pint)  I am going to store it so that I won't have to make it again next time.  And I plan on making these again and again.  My husband is already planning barbecues with friends, just as an excuse to have these again. I served it with the Mexican Corn on the Cob from this site.  They compliment each other perfectly!

I have been using this recipe for a couple years...when ever I make it people RAVE!!  I live in Arizona so everyone is into this kind of cooking.  I usually make 6-7   3# batches, seal a meal and freeze.  Works awesome for a last minute meal!!  I also buy whatever meat is on sale and have the butcher slice it for Carne Asada.  Grill a few minutes on each side and tahdah!!  SOOO Good - If there was a 10 star This is one recipe I would give it!!

Maybe it was the fact that I didn't have any white vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar.  That was the only substitution I made in the entire recipe, which was WAY too much work anyway.  However, this meat dish was inedible to me and my husband. I take responsibility for the substitution of the vinegar, but I wouldn't have expected it to ruin the whole dish.  Maybe it did.  I'm not willing to try it again.

Used 1 TBSP lime juice.  Let marinade for 8 hours.  Meat needs to be pounded out before grilling, then pan fry in Canola for a few minutes with hot sauce.

Yummy!  Made the marinade for my meat and let that sit all day then instead of frying quickly in a pan, i put it in the oven covered for a few hours to get it very tender and flavorful which it was.  The rest of the condiments I didn't make as I just put the meat into tortillas with our sharp cheddar and sour cream.  I did squirt on some fresh lime juice and used a bit of chipoltles in adobo sauce for my husbands tacos.  Very good, will make this again, will be great in the summer on the grill i bet.

impressed this texas family.  i'll confess, it's been awhile since i've made mexican food that didn't involve velveeta or ground beef!  this is my new taco recipe.  love, love, love the marinade.  i made it just as written, maybe a bit less salt, and it was great.  the salsa was good, but i'm not sure it's worth the trouble; not much better than jarred roasted red pepper salsa (a good brand, anyway).  but not hard to make at all.  i used pico de gallo from the grocery deli instead of the onion garnish.  sliced avocado was welcome.  will definitely make again.

I only used the marinade for this recipe...I marinated a round steak, since that's what I had, for about 7-8 hours. I LOVED this marinade, and will definitely use it again. It adds a lot of flavor without a lot of heat, which is just what I like. I could see using this marinade on just about any kind of meat, it was that good. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so tastey! I know of several restaurants that used soy sauce in their meat marinade.  They also used it for fajitas. Either opinion, it was really GOOD!

I love these taco's, my mouth is watering just thinking of them! I found tenderized skirt steak so that is what I used. I only made the steak portion but I can't wait to do it all together when I have more time!

Really wonderful. Delicious marinade. I skipped the cheese because the flank steak was so expensive I didn't want to spend another $6 on cheese I've never tried before. The onions, cilantro and lime juice was a really nice addition, I didn't have the dried peppers and felt the salsa was missing something so maybe it was really needed. I will definitely make this again and keep a look out for flank steak on sale.

This recipe is fantastic.  I choopped the meat before marinading.  Yum.  Also I seared it in a cast iron skillet, then kept it cooking until the meat was nice and dark and carmelized.  I served it in white corn tortillas with pico de gallo, guacamole and cojita cheese.  Wow.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is great.  Loved the salsa and plan on making it again in the future just to dip chips in.  I added a tomatillo and an extra jalapeno, quartered all of it, drizzled with olive oil and roasted exactly to directions.  Added fresh cilantro too before pureeing.  A tip on the meat that I found worked wonderfully: Cut AGAINST the grain on an angle very thin then chop again, cook only a few minutes then remove, if there is any tiny bit of pink left, A)that's not a bad thing, but mostly B) it will continue to cook on the plate.  You do not want to over cook flank in any way!!  Loved, loved this.  Making authentic mexican I have learned really just comes down to fresh ingredients and method of preparation.  Thanks for a keeper!!

I only use this marinade now when making carne asada.  I LOVE this recipe and have never changed a thing to it. I also only grill this meat, never fry.  I cook this meal with G-ma's rice and best black beans, also from this site. My family of eight always finish their plates and come back for more.

This is a great recipe.  Just watch the salt.  You probably would want cut the salt by at least half.  Other than that you can make it then see what you would like to alter the next time.  I have made it several times now and everyone loves it.

So yummy!  I have made these several times.  Our favorite way is to leave the roasted vegetables whole rather than pureeing them.  I also generally leave out the toasted dried New Mexico chile pods (don't keep them on hand).

We all loved this recipe at my house.  It was a little salty to me so I think I will not add the salt next time.  The onion/lime juice mixture was fabulous and the juiced veggies made a great sauce.  I will make this many times over.

Its so good! followed the directions to the "t" but instead of frying the meat i just put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes they were perfection!! I didnt make the relish, instead served it with  Avocado, Tomato and Mango Salsa from this site and also warm corn tortillas. My bf cant stop eating!! Will definitely make this again and again..thank you!!

This was a hit with my family - didn't have alot of time to marinate so only marinated for about an hour but still tasted great - my husband told me to make sure i don't lose this recipe. 4 stars only because i just used the meat part of the recipe - didnt have time to do the vegitable roasting - next time will make sure i have more time

WOW! Is all I can say! Ok, I can say more. These were delicious tacos. I was in the mood to cook something new today and thought I'd give this recipe a try. I bought flap meat from the market because they didn't have flank steak but it was perfect. I marinated my steak for 2 hours and it came out so wonderfully flavored. I had dinner all ready when hubby walked in the door. Tacos, spanish rice and beans, he was in heaven! Thanks for the great recipe. By the way I didn't make the salsa, only the onion and cilantro relish. Yummy!!

These are amazing... reminded me of my trip to Mexico.  They took a lot of prep and steps but were sooooo worth the effort.  I followed the recipe exactly other than substituting several tablespoons of frozen roasted (hot) green chile for the dried chile in the salsa.
DELICIOUS- the whole thing.  My husband and I gobbled it up.

This does NOT taste like carne asada.  It's ok, but def not authentic tasting.  Something about the soy/lime combination in the marinade just doesn't work for us.  I used the lite soy sauce; didn't add any other salt, and the sodium content still seemed high -- and we typically like salt.  The onion/cilantro relish as GREAT; added a pinch of salt and coarsely ground pepper - very fresh and festive. Ran out of time to make the salsa, so we used some pico de gallo we had on hand.  Overall not bad, but if we try it again, we'll substitute something for the soy - or at least PART of it.

This was great and my husband loved it! 
The onion relish and the sauce really make this meal.  I also served it with some quacamole.
I purchased two 1.5 lb. flank steaks.  We grilled one last night for dinner and will have the other one tonight. Sort of a Cinco de mayo weekend with margaritas and Carne Asada.

This was a really good marinade.  I've already passed it on to a couple of family members.  We had a huge party, made 30lbs of taco meat and I used this marinade.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This was a good recipe.  My husband & I liked these, though they did not taste like our local taqueria's.  I'll probably make again & just play around with the marinade a bit more.....
Thanks!

Oh my gosh!!! This was phenomenal - just like a $15 a plate restaurant meal!  Even my picky 8 year old daughter loved it!  Followed the recipe for the marinade with no changes, and grilled on my indoor grill for about 5 minutes per side for a medium rare flank steak. The relish seemed a bit strong for me, so I added chopped avocado and tomatoes, a dash of salt and pepper, and offered diced jalepeno on the side. Yummy!  Did not make the salsa.

These were so yummy, although I did not make the chili sauce that goes with this. It seemed like a lot of work, so I just used green chili sauce from the store and they were a HIT and still very AUTHENTIC. Next time I am going to make the relish a day before so that it will marinate all the flavors together.

Delicious marinade.  I haven't tried the whole recipe but plan to.  The first time I made the marinade exactly as written.  The second time I substituted cilantro for the oregano.  Both delicious.  I look forward to try with other cuts of meat and in the crock pot.

I only made the marinade-but wow.  The best carne asada I have ever had. Just the right balance of spice.  Softens the meat up very well the longer it is marinated.

This recipe was excellent.  I followed it exactly and it turned out just as good as the local Mexican restaruant.  The only down side is that I used a 2 lb. flank steak instead of a 4 lb. so there weren't many leftovers!  My husband is a steak lover and usually prefers his method of grilling steak, but he said these were absolutely delicious.  Thanks!

Yes its good, but still 'gringo'. Heating tortillas in a zip lock bag in the microwave will make them closer to what you enjoy from the stands in Mexico, as will grilling some jalapenos and green onions to serve on the side.  OK, I spend three months a year in Mexico, so I would rather spend time on making a variety of fresh salsas to serve with the tacos, and less on the marinade, a quick dry rub will do.

These were delicious.  I loved the roasted vegetables.  I think they added a lot to the tacos.  The meat was delicious, but not too tender.  I think I might cook it longer or marinate it longer next time to get it a little more tender.  It might have been the way I sliced it too.  Either way, it's definitely worth making again and again.  I didn't try the peppers in the salsa, but I might the next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  It was delicious!!!

3/19/2011 I made this again.....exactly as written... no need to change a thing. After the meat cooked, I did pour all of the leftover marinade in the pan & cooked it for maybe 5 minutes. I will pour it over the leftover meat to keep it moist until I reheat it. It's important to slice the flank steak ACROSS the grain and as thin as you possibly can. ENJOY!
Wow.... I'll never order this in a restaurant again... in fact, I might open my own taco cart with this recipe! Thanks!

It was good, my boyfriend always orders this when we eat out so I thought he would love it. I think I might of marinated it for to long and it had a very strong vinegar taste which over powered the cilantro. But that was probably the cook and not the recipe ;)It smelled soooo good when it was cooking and the kids and I loved it. This is an awesome marinade I will be making this again.

This is really good.  My husband is all about authentic mexican food.  He was impressed.  It did take me a little longer than I expected.  I think it will go faster the next time I make it.  This is not "tex-mex" though--no Taco Bell here if you know what I mean so not everyone will be crazy about it.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! I grew up in the southwest and now live in the northeast...needless to say I was craving some "comfort" food from home, when I came upon this recipe. I made everything according to the recipe, except I added some of the onion relish to the roasted veggies before blending. The lime juice made the texture a bit less chunky. I also grilled the flank which really enhanced the flavor. Served with sour cream on corn tortillas with rice and refried beans as a side. I will add this to my permanent recipe collection. Thanks!!!

This marinade is good, but next time I'll cut back on the Soy sauce. I froze it and will be adding some brown sugar when I use it as a marinade for venison jerky. YUM!

The carne asada was way to salt for our taste. However the salsa and onion with  cilantro was great. Will make again but will not add as much soy sauce and seasoning to the carne asada marinade.

This recipe was wonderful.  I did not make the roasted salsa (because of lack of ingredients) how ever the relish was awesome and the meat was very delicious. I will definitely be making this regularly.

This was really great!
only thing I did different was in the onion cilantro relish I added sliced sweet baby bell peppers for color and flavor. 
The tacos were very yummy... we will make this again for sure!

This was so delicious and so simple (just a little time consuming) to make. We really liked the onion garnish and will be using that for some other similar Mexican recipes. Thanks!

This is the best marinade my husband and I have ever tasted!  The only part of this recipe that was not to our liking was the salsa.  Overall, though, delicious!

These are great.  The only thing I was not impressed with was the salsa.  I use my own and I love it.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!!

I made this dish for my dad and his family for his birthday.  They all loved it!  I made the salsa the night before, and marinated and cubed the meat the night before.  This made cooking quick and easy the following day. We all LOVED the salsa!

I have to say this was a fabulous recipe. Full od flavour. My husband and I absolutely loved it.  He's requested I make it on a weekly basis.  I used chicken instead of beef but will try beef this week.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was good.  I wish the flavor was a little stronger though on the meat, even after marinating for 24 hours the seasoning seemed mild.  I didn't make the salsa (already had some), instead of white onions I used red and didn't use cheese - but added some guacamole.  Will probably make again.

Fantastic recipe.  I substitued the meat because the flank steak was $10/lb.  It still turned out fantastic for my Mexican Fiesta.

I didn't have time to make the tacos but the steak had a great flavor.  I'll try to make the whole recipe in the future but since I love tacos I don't see the 5 stars changing.

EXCELLENT- WE GRILLED THE MARINATED FLANK STEAK-  WATCH THE PEPPER PODS-THE SALSA GETS VERY HOT WITH FULL DOSAGE.  WE USED THE YUMMY CILANTRO/ONION/LIME MIXTURE ON GRILLED GROUPER THE NEXT DAY- PERFECT!

Delicious!  Packed with flavors, every one of them great.  I rarely stick to a recipe - most need tweaking as the dish develops - but this was a slam dunk all the way through. Impressive!

Yum! Made this for a weeknight dinner so used store bought fresh salsa, Casa Sanchez, and Mexican cheese mix.  My family has requested for me to make these at least twice a month.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!  Never having Burrito Factory soft tacos again!

These were really good but the flavor seemed to be just a little too strong, I think next time I will use a little less vinegar. I did make the salsa and thought it was ok but I will probably stick with mine. But all in all I will definetely make again just tweek it to our taste a little more. It really does look harder than it is though and will definetely impress guest. Thanks!

Came back from mexico and wanted to find something similar to the Arrachera beef we were eating.  This was great, and we continued to eat it even after stuffing ourselves.  We have used it with fajitas and tonight i am going to marinade a tritip roast in it.  Yum Yum

As stated earlier, this takes a bit of time. I didn't care for them in the corn tortillas, but loved it in the flour tortilla. The onion cilantro was good, but the taste was in my mouth the next day and I didn't care for the vegee puree.  I think I will try this with beans and tomatillo sauce next time.

Thanks for this excellent recipe.  It certainly is a lot of work, but the flavour is worth it.  You really can't eat these fast enough - straight off the grill is best.  If you wish to save time, use bottled taqueria sauce or taco sauce and skip steps 3 and 4.  It's also a good way to serve up a roast that's not as tender as you would like.
