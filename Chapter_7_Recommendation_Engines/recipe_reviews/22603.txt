This recipe makes a nice, visually appealing cheesecake.  The recipe calls for too little cream cheese.  I doubled everything and it turned out better.  Otherwise it was too flat and tiny.

this would have been a good recipe if it was written write , it calls for 12 ounces of cream cheese when it should be more like 20 ounces , my cheesecake looks nice but is only about an inch thick

This was excellent! It took some time to prepare, however well worth it.  The whole family enjoyed it.  They actually thought I bought it from The Cheesecake Factory!

I headed the advice of some of the other reviews and increase the amount of filling, and I had more than enough.  I'm not sure what crust the others used, but I used a premade 9" graham cracker cust as the recipe calls for, and I'm sure the amount of filling based on the recipe would have been fine.

great cheesecake!! I followed the recipe to a T and had enough filling for the crust. It tasted good too. The only problem that I had is that my cheesecake didn't look half as good as the picture. :)
