I used a lowfat mayonnaise in this recipe and I did add a little more than asked for in the recipe only because I think my turkey was a little drier than it should have been. I made no other changes. The filling in this wrap is simple but delicious. Very good.

These were really good. I only added a sprinkle of salt and it didn't need any at all. The spinach leaves were good but any lettuce would work and I would prefer shredded iceberg the next time I make this. I used cajun style turkey and this turned out great.

Several years ago I traveled to an island in Maine. A friend on the island made lunch that were these spectacular wraps. For years I've tried to duplicate it and this recipe has been the closest I can find. Instead of Turkey I used chicken and made a chicken salad. I added chopped red bell pepper. Good with or without the parmesan cheese.

Delicious.  I added some chopped apples for sweetness and texture.

Fantastic! Will definitely make this again. Perfect in a wrap, no extra seasoning needed.
