HELPFUL TIPS AFTER MAKING IT SEVERAL TIMES: I only tried this because I had all the ingredients and wanted something different.  Well, I've now made it 20+ times, and it's always what people rave about at parties.  It's amazing how good this tastes.  Most adults I know DO NOT like these dunked/topped with chocolate.  They taste good and have a classy look just as is.  Baking for 11-13 minutes seems to work better and don't get scared off by how dry the mix appears when you add the flour.  Will mix just fine... consistency of any cookie dough (butterscotch color & moist).  If your dough comes out flat, your baking soda has expired or you need to put dough in fridge for an hour.  As long as my butter isn't almost mushy from being room temp, I never have to put it in the fridge!  Two thumbs up and toddler approved!

OH MY GOSH, a local restaurant serves delicious coconut cookies that taste like these! I have been looking for the recipe. Baking is like a hobby for me, so after a little tweaking, I think I have created the PERFECT COOKIE for my family!  The changes I made were:
Increase the vanilla to 1 tsp.
Add 2 cups crushed corn flake cereal
Add 1/2 cup of toasted & cooled coconut.
Then I made a separate batch and added white chocolate chips and OH BABY, they were to die for!  
*NOTE* For those of you who said your cookies came out flat, I have a couple suggestions for you.
First, check the date on your baking soda.  Also make sure it is kept stored in a cool pantry, cannot even be slightly warm.  Over time, heat breaks down the product long before the expiration date.
Second, cool your cookie dough in the fridge for 10-20 mins before baking.
Then when you take it out of the fridge, roll dough into balls, then bake. These cookies should not come out flat at all. Happy Baking!!!

I thought this recipe was good. After reading the reviews for this recipe, I was scared they'd turn out flat. The recipe says to drop by teaspoonfuls, I used approx. a 2 Tbsp scooper (the med. scoop from Pampered Chef), added a bit more vanilla, sugar, and coconut to the second batch. Turned out perfect. Nice and fluffy, crispy and chewy. I also baked them for 16 minutes since I used a bigger scoop.

This recipe was simple, quick, and the cookies are delicious.  Next time, I think I will add some chopped macadamia nuts and maybe drizzle a little chocolate over the top.  (I used a cookie scoop and only got 23 cookies out of the recipe.If you use a scoop, bake for 13 min.)

I think on this one it's either you love 'em or you don't.  In other words, I don't necessarily think this recipe is flawed in any way, it's just a matter of personal preference whether or not you like a thin, chewy, really buttery (bordering greasy) cookie.  I don't. (Especially the bordering greasy part)  Hubs, for example, I know will like these a whole lot better than I do.  The flavor's there but given the factors I've just mentioned along with the fact that they're not the prettiest cookie I've ever made either, I can only rate these average at best.

I just wanted to comment about the flatness of this cookie.  When you use butter and soda your cookies will flatten out.  It is cooking science.  These cookies are chewy and coconutty and really good the way the recipe is.  If you want your cookies to not flatten you have a couple of options: use margarine or shortening in place of butter; use baking powder instead of soda.  There is a great primer on cookie baking on this site that discusses fats and leaveners and their effects on cookies.  The cookies in the picture for this recipe that are in the container are representative of what the cookies should look like if you follow the recipe.  The ones that are stacked look different to me like perhaps margarine was used.  I doubled the recipe because it calls for teaspoon full and I use a tablespoon cookie scoop. That made 58 cookies of the batch and I baked them for 12 minutes.  The only ingredient adjustment I made was to double the vanilla to 1 tsp per recipe.  Yum yum.  Yes I will make them again.

If I could give this cookie a 10 I would! These are the most yummy cookies ever! I have never written a review for anything, because of the bother of registering and all, but these were well worth it.
I used oil instead of butter... only  1/3 of a cup of oil. And I added about 1/2 + cup of Toffee chips. WOW YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These were very good and the extra 1/4 cup flour is the trick! It could use some extra flavor though. Maybe replacing the vanilla with coconut extract. Mine also didn't come out perfectly round like the picture. Oh well, they still taste good. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside

Very nice non-chocolate addition to my Christmas cookie platters!  I used a good quality vanilla and baked for the full 10 minutes til they were golden - had a nice toasted coconut flavor and perfect chewy/crispy texture.  Will make these again and again - might try some rum or rum flavoring to give them a pina colada twist, but this recipe is delicious as is!

In order to make these cookies just right, you MUST use 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour...the extra 1/4 cup does the trick. Also, I think next time I will use 1 1/2 cups of shredded coconut...I just felt like it needed a bit more coconut to keep it from tasting like a simple sugar cookie with some coconut thrown in. I also used 1/4 tsp. coconut extract + 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract. 11 mins was ideal for my 350 degree oven. Mmm, perfect with tea...delicious!

Made these this morning for a teacher's book sale preview. After reading the other reviews, I decided to add some extra flour, so (I doubled the recipe) I used 3 cups instead of 2.5. I also used half coconut oil and half butter, and added 1 tsp pure coconut extract. As you can imagine, they tasted very strongly of coconut, which was my intention. I found that the dough was a little heavy and oilier than usual, so I chilled it thoroughly first and used a small cookie scooper to dish it onto my parchment-lined sheets. They came out great, with a texture similar to chewy chocolate chip cookies.  I did not try adding chocolate chips or dipping into chocolate, but I imagine either would work with these! Baked at 330 degrees in convection oven for about 10 minutes. Take them out then they are light golden brown all over, not just the edges, or they might be raw in the middle. A light sprinkle of unsweetened coconut on top makes them look elegant and browns just enough. I am happy to add this to my repertoire of go-to cookie recipes.

Awesome!! Delicious, easy prep, easy clean-up, easy to tweak.  I always read reviews (recipes & movies) as I like to benefit from others' mistakes or ideas.  Made small cookies, do not overbake, just till bottom is barely tan colored to maintain chewiness. Per review advice, added a bit more coconut, some coconut extract and a touch of almond extract w/ the vanilla.  Toffee bits and chocolate chips are great additions as well.  I WILL be making this recipe again---maybe tomorrow!!

My cookies came out completely flattened but they still tasted delicious.  Next time I will try chilling the dough first.

TRUST ME: double the coconut.  You don't make coconut cookies unless you love coconut.  I made the recipe as directed and didn't like the way they were coming out-flat & not very coconutty.  So I dumped a good bit more coconut in the last third of the batter and they not only came out less flat but looking more like macaroons with the little bits of coconut sticking out getting nice and toasted.  Much prettier, better tasting and still chewy.

These are awesome!!  I just made them and my family's scarfed down half of them already.  I was low on a lot of typical cookie ingredients and was looking for something simple, and these turned out gorgeous (not flat at all, and SO tasty).  

Alterations to the original recipe:  1/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 packed dark brown sugar instead of 1/2 and 1/2; 1 full tsp. vanilla extract; 1/2 tsp coconut extract; and when adding the flaked coconut, I also added an extra 1/3 of toasted and cooled flaked coconut as well as 1 cup crushed Special K (sounds bizarre, but adds a great little crunch).  For me, each batch also needed more like 12-13 minutes for the right softness.  Perfection!

Moist, chewy, and delicious!  I made one modification on purpose and a couple by accident.  First, I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 c. like previous reviewers suggested since I was using sweetened coconut.  I also added 1/2 t orange extract by accident, and went ahead and added the 1/2 t of vanilla extract as well.  The orange tastes great in the cookie.  Also, I couldn't find my 1/4 c measuring cup, so when measuring the flour, it was probably closer to 1 1/3 c rather than the 1 1/4 c called for.  I didn't soften the butter, because the recipe didn't say to, and I'm too impatient for that.  I rolled them into 1" balls and didn't flatten them at all.  They turned out thick half-domes, not flat AT ALL.  I did refrigerate the dough while the oven what preheating, and between batches.  10 min baking time was prefect.  Will make many many more times!  Thanks!

I had been craving coconut for a while now since it's now warm outside, and decided to look up a great recipe for a coconut dessert - when I stumbled across these cookies, I knew they were it! I decided to change a few things up and do my own thing. I added some chopped up macadamia nuts into the batter with the coconut, then baked them as specified in the recipe. After the cookies came out of the oven, while they were cooling, I melted down some white chocolate chips with a bit of heavy cream and drizzled it over the tops of them after they were cool - delicious!!! Next time, I won't make any modifications and just bake them as specified because I know they will be so yummy! This is my go-to coconut cookie recipe!

Great Recipe! The first batch i made came out really flat. They were still crispy and chewy, but just too flat for my taste and didnt look as nice. Second batch, I added a 1/4 more of flour and put the batter in the fridge for 15 min. They came out AWESOME! Perfect texture, Crispy, chewy, and a bit more fluffy. Overall, A Fantastic recipe!

Very yummy! I left out the white sugar, since I used sweetened coconut (couldn't find unsweetened). I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla. Came out nice and chewy with a great coconut flavor.

Delicious is all I can say about these cookies!  Perfect amount too; a lot of cookie recipes are for 5 to 6 dozen and that's too much for my husband and myself.  I also followed the recipe as given and it was easy and delicious!!

If you're a coconut fan, add another 1/4 cup to this recipe. I also up the vanilla to 1 tsp. Also for an Almond Joy experience, press a whole almond in the top of the cookie prior to baking. After cooling, dip the bottom 1/2 of each cookie with melted chocolate chips, leveling off the bottom w/a knife, then place on wax paper to set. I like to melt 1/2 milk choc and 1/2 dark choc. I also double the recipe.

Excellent! I made them into German Chocolate Cookies by adding 1 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of pecans. Yum! Definitely on my Christmas Cookie List this year!

These are awesome! Their texture is perfect! I didn't have brown sugar so I subbed with plain sugar and 1-2 Tbsp. honey...so good! I always use "honey sugar" for brown sugar when I run out. These would also be really good with a dash of cinnamon and/or some chopped almonds or walnuts. A definite keeper!

Great recipe.  I did make a few changes though.  Increased the coconut flakes to 2 cups, increased the vanilla extract to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp of almond extract, add 1 cup mini chocolate chips.  My batch made me 3 dozen cookies about 2" big.  12 mins bake time made the PERFECT cookie!

These didn't last very long in my home.  They were very chewy and a nice change from the usual holiday cookies.  I baked my cookies on a 9x13 pyrex dish at 375C for 10 minutes.  The pyrex dish is great for baking cookies; they come out perfect and they are never burned at the bottom.  I've used many different types of cookies sheets, baking stones, etc. and the pyrex dish is the best.  The only drawback - you can only make a 1/2 dozen cookies at a time.  However, the results are worth it!

It is a bit too sweet for me, next time I will reduce the sugar. I made 1/2 chewy cookies and 1/2 crispy cookies, both turn out nicely. I shape the dough into small balls and use a fork to flatten it, looks nicer with some stripes on top. ;) Thanks for recipe.

I love love love these cookies!! I'm not much of a baker; I usually just do it in my spare time when I'm in the mood for some cookies (I only eat home-made cookies). But this recipe is so easy and the cookies are fantastic! I'm a huge coconut fan so I up them to almost 2 cups and I always throw in some white chocolate chips (around 1/2 cup) as that is another big time favorite of mine. Up the vanilla extract to 1 tsp and they turn out perfect. I make these all the time and they have always been a huge hit at work, even with the people that don't like coconut, because they are just too yummy to pass up!

I made these cookies today and I thought they were very very good. My boyfriend loves coconut and he thought they were good as well. They were nice and soft and chewy.Yum! Next time i might add something else into them like chocolate chips.

Never again!  These came out like melted cheese! I generally stick to recipes with high ratings, and I've rarely had issues with them - especially if I read and follow the tips in the reviews.  Not in this case!  Some reviewers said that baking soda must be fresh (it was NEW), and butter must be chilled.  Came out FLAT!  I then refrigerated the batter for an hour - FLAT again! The third (and last) time, I rolled the chilled batter into balls and then froze them.  Baked 8 minutes - still FLAT!  Good luck to any of you who attempt this.  I never will again.

These cookies are AMAZING! My family and I cannot get enough (I buy bulk coconut when we go shopping now just for this recipe). I have to stress, however, to not OVER soften your butter. You want it soft, but not too soft (like after sitting at room temp for an entire day). Also, take them out *just* before they are completely done cookies. These make a delicious, chewy (crunchy around the outside) cookie. We add chocolate chips from time to time as well.

I made these cookies for my husband, he loved them , I  added ¼ cup of flour as some of you mentioned , but it was a mistake, it made the cookies hold their shapes as balls , not flat, so once I got them out of the oven while still soft I gently pressed   each one with a spatula to  flatten them. So they looked good, but next time I won’t add the extra four maybe only one tablespoon.

All Eaten!  These were awesome! I incorporated some suggestions, using 1/4 c more flour, and adding some coconut flavor and almond extract. I was apprehensive about using sweetened coconut flakes, wondering whether I should reduced sugar. But no need to. I used sweetened coconut flakes, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/4 c. white sugar and the cookies were just the way I like them: not-too-sweet.  Used fresh baking soda and chilled the dough before using a small ice cream scoop to lay them out. Added some semi-sweet chips to the last 10 and those were gobbled up before all the others.

I'd call these Chewy Cookies since the coconut served more as a texture rather than flavor. The cookies' sweetness empowered most other flavors (vanilla & coconut), so next time I'll be cutting back on the amount of sugar. Overall a simple, tasty cookie!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing but I did have to cook mine longer (about 15 minutes total). I made them larger and ended up with about 28 cookies.

I made these cookies twice.  First time they came out very greasy, very flat, but flavorful.  So I rushed to the store and bought a fresh Baking Soda (made sure the exp.date was a few years away) and made the cookies again carefully measuring the ingredients (even double checking with the metric system using my scale – which is the only way to get the dry ingredients in the correct amount).  
Unfortunately the result was the same.  These are very flavorful cookies, but flat and oh so greasy.
I personally do not like greasy cookies.   
I’ll give them one more try, this time tweaking the recipe, for sure reducing the butter amount and will see.  But as is, this recipe is a no keep for me and I can only rate it average at best.

Loved these.  Great coconut flavor and nice texture. I halved the recipe and increased the amount of coconut.  I didn't have any issues with the dough or spreading.  They were done (starting to burn) at 7 minutes.

This is everyone's favorite cookie that I make!  These are the changes that I have developed and they turn out perfect every time (have made over 30 times).  Double the recipe and add 1 t. coconut extract, 2/3 bag of white chocolate chips and 1 c. of macadamia nuts.  I bake for 12 minutes. Not necessary to chill the dough.  Incredible!

If more stars were possible, I'd give them!  I used the suggestions of many and substituted the coconut extract for the vanilla, added 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped macadamian nuts.  The taste is out of this world!  I can't say enough.

Good cookie but definitley lacks presentation. I made this cookie because it seemed fairly simple and sounded SO good and GOOD it is. However with the ingredients combined exactly as called for ...I have no idea how you net 3dozen cookies out of this. They are very high maintenance (meaning you cant walk away to far or the will over cook.) Wish the presentation would have been better they were SO flat. But they sure are tasty! Dipped in chocolate and add some almonds you would have an Almond Joy! =)

I guess these weren't what I was expecting. A little greasy - and way too sweet. Used sweetened coconut, probably shouldn't have. Recipe isn't specific. Might try it again with modifications. The kids love them.

There is either something wrong with this recipe, my oven or both.  I made these once and they were super flat and soggy.  they tasted good though so I read the reviews and saw that old baking soda could be the cause.  I went out and bought fresh baking soda only to have the same result :(.  These cookies TASTE great but I only bake to share and these cookies are NOT presentable..

OMG! SOOOOO GOOD. Only thing I changed was I used a stick of " I can't believe it's not butter " ( I know some people think margarine is "scary" but I'm a post-op bariatric  patient and butter is disgustingly fattening so I have no choice) and I used Splenda instead of white sugar and Splenda Brown Sugar instead of regular brown sugar. SO good. I also put mine in the fridge for a few minutes and rolled into balls. They made cute little round, fluffy, buttery, coconut cookies!

I am not a great baker, but theses cookies were fabulous. I chilled the dough about 30 minutes before baking, and they were awesome. Even my picky 10 year old loves them. Try white chocolate chunks mixed in the dough. It is a gooey mess to eat, but oh so wonderful!

Oh My GOD!! These are fantastic! I am a total coconut fanatic and I just can't stop eating these. THANK YOU so much for this recipe. I just sent a batch of them to my son for his birthday. I wrapped them in plastic and placed a slice of bread in the box on top of them. This makes cookies arrive as fresh as the day they were baked!

Most popular cookie I have ever made.   They are very addicting.  Two people in my family even hate coconut and loved these.  There is actually very little coconut flavor in them.

This is an excellent chewy cookie.  I rolled them into small balls before baking and they all were uniformly shaped...very nice.  The kids loved them, too.

Easy with awesome results. I did not even spend that much time getting it creamy. Adding cornflakes gives it a nice crunch! Used 1 tsp vanilla. Placed dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. Otherwise stuck to recipe.
This is a keeper! Plus the kids rate it a 10 out of 10!

Amazeballs! I made golf ball-sized balls and they didn't flatten all that much. Crunchy outside and chewy inside. These will be a favourite!

This recipe is for those who like a soft and chewy cookie. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as stated.
I agree that it makes just the right amount of cookies.  Pecans would be a nice addition as well.

These cookies are so delicious!  I did double the vanilla after tasting the dough and they turned out perfect.  I might try adding some macadamia nuts or pecans next time to shake it up!  Still, these hold their own all by their buttery little selves.

Really Yummy and soft cookies! If your cookies fall flat, next time put the batter in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes then scoop and bake.

This is "my" basic cookie dough(which I doubled so keep that in mind w given amounts)except that I use 1t salt,less sugar(3/4c ea),5oz flaked unswt coconut&the "famous" more flour(3c for dbl);oh,too,bake@375.Made2bases like that,but1 w 1/2t coconut extract&3/4c each sugar.Just okay,nothing special& plainlooking.To the other,added 1/2t almond extract&1c each of the sugars,as listed here.Major announcement:Although I refrigerated both&played around w 350 &375temps,the more sugar ones spread. That's big news in my book.'Didn't expect that!As for flavor,better;but I'll try 1/4t more next time&maybe less vanilla & maybe1/4-1/2t coconut ext.So many options!:)Still plainlooking.Gonna drizzle w chocolate glaze&finely chopped almonds.Hey,may add the almond ext to the glaze!I am outta control!:O :D 'Makin' for MomHeather's bday 2012...'Keep eating these so I have more to say ;D Dough next time:1/2t coconut,1t almond&1/2t or no vanilla.W butter,may just leave the vanilla out & it won't lessen the other flavors if it isn't there now,will it?!? :) Btw,half t coconut ext is enough whether you play w almond ext or not...Later same day:3/4c choc chips,1T butter,3T corn syrup,1/4t almond extract.'Not great.'Couldn't taste the almond&was afraid to add more.Too thick,too,so made "streamers" or confetti on 'em.Maybe the semisweet was just to strong flavored for the ext.Soooo, summing it up:Jus'okay,but fills the coconut cookie request.Maybe I'm more of a macaroon(less flour)type person.

After reading as many reviews as possible, I did increase the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  Instead of butter, I did use butter flavored shortening.  I do not care for a "greasy" cookie, so this is why I opted for the shortening.  I also used 1/4 tsp each of coconut, vanilla and almond extract.  My cookies baked up great!  I promised myself a coconut cake for my birthday, and not wanting to wait until April I am  hoping they will hold my craving until then.  With the minor changes made, these are great cookies!

Mine didn't flatten at all, they were very crumbly though. I agree with other reviewers, the butter is overwhelming. Won't make these again.

These cookies were nice and chewy.  However, I only give this recipe four stars because I felt that the coconut flavor could have been more pronounced.  It tasted like a sugar cookie with coconut.  And, although I really did like how the cookies turned out, I was disappointed by the lack of coconut flavor.  (I added an extra 1/3 cup of coconut to this recipe as well!)  Still, a nice cookie with a great, chewy texture.  

Also, if you 'drop dough by teaspoonfuls' then you do not end up with a nice, round cookie like the picture suggests.

It was a cookie baking day today and I had some coconut to use up. Found this recipe and decided to try it. Only change I made was I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and just 1/4 of white sugar. The only "bad" thing I can say is that the recipe as written makes a really small batch. When I make cookies, I like to make enough to freeze and have for a couple of weeks.  My husband found these after school today, and the container is already looking pretty sad! I will make these again, but will double the recipe and might add some choc chips to some of them. Really good and the title is correct,,,,, they are quite chewy! Yum!!

This recipe could have had a better outcome if I had greased the cookie sheet.  A lot of the cookies were ruined because they fell apart when I was trying to get them off the sheet on account that the sheet was ungreased.  If I make this recipe again, I will be definitely use oil on the sheets.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I love coconut and really liked how simple this was.  After dropping to to the pan, I used a fork and smashed the cookie down.  The second time I made these I dipped them halfway in dark chocolate, yummy!

Great recipe.  I substituted coconut oil for half of the butter and used dessicated coconut instead of flaked.  I also made them into small balls and then flattened them between palms instead of simply dropping them.

very nice cookie ,I made a double batch and found that the dough was very sticky .even after an hour in the frig.I had to add a cup more flour and the dough was still sticky and a bit hard to spoon .Im not sure if the sticky dough was because I double recipe or not.I like the chewiness of this cookie and will make again but next time will add chocolate chip and cut back on sugar

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. The only thing I prefer to use is canola oil instead of butter. This will make the cookies oilier and heavier, but I think butter makes the cookies a little too light and dry. Still tastes deelish with butter though! Fabulous recipe. Five stars all the way.

These were really really good. and really really easy which is always a nice thing. WAY TOO LITTLE VANILLA!!! if your over zealous with the vanilla extract like I am I increased this to 1 1/2 teaspoons!!. They also took 12 minutes to bake for me. The batter to these when its done mixing looks like you could get ten cookies out of it but to my surprise it went a long way.

Awesome. I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead of 1/2, and also used FRESH grated coconut. Turned out really great, and tasted even better the second day. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Made these as written. They were gone within a few hours. The whole family just loved them. I used fresh coconut (the joy of living in Florida!). These were really good and definitely chewy.

These were sooooo good! I made half the dough the regular way, and added chocolate chips to the other half. These taste like sugar cookies with coconut added--delicious!

Oh, yay! Thanks, Cheesecakemama, for testing these for me. I've been having trouble with my cookies not spreading enough, so I added slightly less flour to this recipe. My result was very thin, crispy, super-chewy cookies - exactly what I wanted! I also added 1/2 teaspoon coconut flavoring. Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again. Maybe tomorrow. ;)

Ten stars from a true coconut lover....these cookies are really delicious..the only thing that I did different was to add 1 tsp. of coconut extract instead of the vanilla. I wanted more coconut flavor....and this was it. Excellent recipe! Thanks!

These are one of the best cookies I've ever made.  I added 1/2 chopped pecans and increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon as others suggested.  They were done in 10 mins. and are moist and chewy.

OMG, these cookies are awesome! Very tasty and chewy indeed. I took some suggestions from other comments and added a cup of chocolate chips and upped the vanilla extract to a full teaspoon. Next time i think i'd add coconut extract and a bit more coconut. Fantastic, the only problem is that this recipe makes a small batch, so next time, definitely making double. Thanks for this great recipe!

My cookies turned out crispy, but still delicious! I used an organic unsweetened dried coconut which is probably what contributed to the dryness.  Next time I'll add some sweetened condensed milk to make them a little more moist.

Wuld not change a letter in this recipe.  The cookies came out round, chewy and wonderful.  This will be my new holiday cookie.

My only advice would be to double the batch.  I ate a ton of the yummy dough!

my son has celiac disease so I modified this to be gluten-free.  Wow these are fantastic!  The only changes I made was to substitute 1 1/2 cups all purpose baking mix from Kinnikinnik for flour and I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  It is hard to find recipes that work with gluten-free flours.  Thanks - I will use this one often!

I made these after trying coconut cookies at Cookie Island (in NYC) and they were just as good, if not better! Try adding chocolate chips or nuts for a kick.

Oh.... my.... God!! These were the best cookies I think I've ever eaten! My husband agrees. I had to change the recipe a bit because my son and I have celiac disease, which means we follow a gluten-free diet (i.e. we can't use regular wheat flour). My son is also dairy-free. Also, I needed a cookie for the gluten/dairy free cookie swap our local group is having, and was really panicked about it because gluten-free cookies often taste like cardboard! Even with my substitutions, these were incredible cookies! Here's what I changed: I used "Bob's Red Mill GF Flour Mix" in place of regular four, Earth Balance Buttery Sticks as a dairy-free alternative to butter, and gluten-free vanilla which I doubled to one teaspoon. I dropped onto the cookie sheet in tiny 1/2 tsp. balls because 1 tsp. was too big. It could be the substitutions causing that. I just know that this cookie will win raves at our swap. Thanks for sharing!!!

These are really good. Maybe too much salt for me, I usually don't put salt in my cookies, but I did this time, and it stands out a little. I rolled these into balls before baking them and they turned out perfect.  These were easy and I love the cocnut flavor. YUM!!!

Buttery, chewy, and delicious! I use AirBake insulated pans and found I had to increase the bake time 2-3 min. to get them lightly toasted, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I made the recipe almost as written. I added 1 tsp of my homemade vanilla, and a dash of coconut extract. I loved the texture of the cookie--nice and chewy--and like that the cookie was flat and not a mound. I will make these again, and they will be a nice addition to my holiday cookie tray.

My cookies came out flat but I loved them this way. They are what the title says, chewy coconut cookies. I got 32 cookies and was skimpy on my teaspoon. I could only cook mine 8 minutes and they were done. Although they were a litle bland, I'll bake again and try some almond extract or maybe some chopped nuts. Very simple and delicious.

These are delicious! If you want lots of compliments, give people these cookies, everyone LOVED them!  Yum yum. I followed the recipe to the letter except I baked mine for 12 to 14 minutes.

These cookies were good. I had a pack of coconuts that needed to be used and decided to try this midnight of my birthday to celebrate. The cookies were very good. The next time I bake these I am going to flatten the cookies dough a bit more in that I like my cookies thin.

What an awesome change of pace from the traditional cookie! These came out flat and I absolutely LOVED the appearance. Can't wait to make again...and again. So easy. I didn't change a thing!

2016
These are STILL one of my most prized cookies. Even people who claim they hate coconut love this cookies. Simply amazing

I have made these a bunch of times, the reviewers are correct- just chill them a bit if you want them to be more of a mound versus a spreading cookie or add a touch more flour.  
For the holidays I add in a cup of dried cranberries and the crowd goes wild!

These are pretty darn amazing. They were gone in one day! However, I'm a giant coconut fan, so I think next time I make them, I will add 2 cups of cooconut flakes instead.

The cookies turned out wonderfully. I did make a few changes, put 1/4 cup more golden brown sugar, and 1/4 cup more coconut. I also put the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes before I baked them. They were light and fluffy and didn't spread. Thanks again, I will definetly remake.

I've returned to this recipe frequently over the past few months and it has never failed! I can make these cookies in about 20 minutes flat, I have made them so many times!  When I bring them to parties or church potlucks, they are gone within a few minutes.  Even my friends who do not like coconut love these cookies!  They are moist, chewy and have lovely flavors!  As a coconut fan, but picky cookie eater, these are my all-time favorite cookies. Thank you to whomever invented them!

This was a great recipe - I'm a baker in an assisted living home and wanted something different. I made a couple of small changes - replaced the vanilla with pure almond extract, and added 1 cup toasted, finely chopped almonds.  Delicious!

Nice change of pace.  I, too, had fairly flat cookies (and my bs was fine and dough chilled), but they remained crunchy on the outside and deliciously chewy on the inside.  They are a tad bit on the greasy side, but quite honestly, I've had worse.  Husband loved.  Just tried throwing a handful of dried cherries in for the heck of it - will update.  UPDATE:  We both prefer cookies with the addition of the dried cherries.  They added a level of tartness to counter the sweetness of the base cookie.  Will make again :)  Thanks!

These cookies are quite good. I am a coconut lover and a rebel. I always later the recipe to my liking and i don't like sweet cookies. So here a a few simple changes I made.
I add a few drops of coconut extract in addition to Valina extract when i mix the dough. Use half of white sugar but packed more brown sugar. I like coconut taste but hate chewing the flakes. In my opinion, those flakes have no coconut flavor. So, i chop the flakes in the food possessor until they are small, but not powder. Mine came out fine and definitely not too sweet. This recipe will be kept in my personal file for sure. :)

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were a huge hit. They are the perfect balance of buttery and chewy with just the right amount of coconut. LOVE them as they are with no tweaks to the recipe!

Fantastic moist cookie!  For those whose cookies are going flat, I accidentally discovered that this happens when the butter-to-flour ratio is off.  In other words, add a little more flour to the recipe and the problem should be fixed.

LOVED these cookies! They don't have tons of flavor, but that is almost the perfect dessert, light and mild flavored. Made these for my fiance and roommate and they both raved about them! The only thing I did was add an extra teaspoon of vanilla and an extra half cup of flour. They really are a great cookie and is a recipe I will be keeping and making for a while!

These are GREAT.  I did read some reviews and made simple changes.  I used 1 1/2 cup flour and added some coconut extract.  I added walnuts and white chocolate chips.  In my oven I baked at 350 degrees for 11 minutes and turned tray then baked for 2 minutes more.  Perfect soft inside and crispy outside.  While on tray I melted dark chocolate and drizzled over them.  Pretty and great tasting.  Will post a picture of them above.

Excellent cookie! Chewy center, crunchy on the outside, perfect! I think I will try to give it more of a coconutty flavor next time around by using coconut extract or oil. Would definitely make again.

So good!!  I added about 1/4 tsp of coconut extract and they tasted so coconutty and yummy.  Soft and chewy (exept for the batch I overcooked) but mine were thin  even though the marjarine I used was fridge cold and I whipped the butter/sugar until fluffy... maybe longer in the fridge next time?  My husband was happy though as he likes thin cookies.  Will make again and again!  Nice change from chocolate chip  or oatmeal cookies.

My husband declared it the "best cookie ever" and I've already had 3 myself. I only made a couple of changes to the recipe:
- Double the amount of coconut and toast it. Just make sure it cools completely before you add it to the dough.
- I only had sweetened coconut so I decreased the white sugar to 1/4 cup and kept the amount of brown sugar the same. It doesn't come out too sweet at all.
- Add 1/4 cup of flour. Trust me.
- (optional) Add a 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips.

Great little bites of coconut goodness. The coconut lovers will go gaga, others will still like them. I lightly toasted the coconut to bring out the flavor, increased flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased vanilla to 1 teaspoon. Excellent!

I stumbled across this recipe looking around for a quick sweet items that could satify my late night craving fix and use up random items in my panty and I must say OMJEEEEEZZZZYY this recipe ROCKS!!! I am not a good baker. in fact my last attempt at baking resulted in new legs for my large sofa and these cookies still came out great despite all my baking shortcomings! I followed the tips from Chef Joys review and it helped so much(THANKS). I did have a few unexpected mix ups. Being that it was a panty raid I only had 1/2 cup of all purpose flour so i used self rising flour for the remaining. I had idea if I should still use the baking soda and salt so I (dont laugh) closed my eyes, said a quick prayer to the baking Gods and sprinkled some of both in. They did come out a little flat BUT I like my cookies that way. They were soft, moist, chewy and AMAZING!! The next morning I woke up and made 2 for breakfast and am considering making more right now as I type up this review!! THANK N. Hoff

These cookies are absolutely amazing!!!! I was randomly searching to find a recipe for a bag of coconut I had in my cupboard and was happy to find a non-macaroon cookie recipe. We tried it and now the recipe is in our collection. Thank you for these wonderful cookies!!!

These were really good, but way too sugary for me.  I would recommend cutting the white sugar at least in half.  I also added white chocolate shavings to a few of them which was a nice touch.

Addictive! I toasted and cooled the coconut first for extra flavor and added Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate chips to the second batch at my husband's request.

i really liked this recipe. I didn't follow making teaspoonfuls of the dough though. I did big balls then flattened them out so I cooked them for 25 minutes. I really liked these. I didn't even have baking soda and i left that out and they aren't flat.

I make coconut milk from scratch at home all the time and wanted to do something with the nicely shredded coconut pulp. So I decided to try this recipe and it was great! 
The only thing I changed was, I reduced the amount of sugar by about half and added a little more coconut flakes. It was still very chewy and plenty sweet enough, for me at least:)
Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Thank you for this recipe.  It's become an instant favorite.  I've gotten numerous compliments on them.  I would imagine you would need to like coconut to like this recipe, but if you do - you must make them!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and had no problem with the cookies turning out too flat.

these were ok. It seemed they had too much grease in them and tasted a little off in that matter. Next time I will cut down on that.

I bake every Thursday night with my daughter and these cookies were a HUGE hit the next day at work. I always double recipies because my baking doesn't last untill lunch, this one should have been tripled! Wonderfully chewy when baked for only 6 minutes... I have an older oven so I set the timer for 3 and move the baking sheet a little for even cooking. I also added the zest and juice of half a lemon... Great combo with the coconut. My friend from Jamacia said they tasted just like "coconut drops" he used to get back home.

These turned out a bit flatter than I would have liked but still taste wonderful. I think next time I will add more coconut even though I measured fairly generously this time. I'd just like a bit more coconut texture in them next time.

These are insanely good. Somewhere between a cookie and a macaroon. I used coconut extract in place of the vanilla, because I had some on hand. The rest stayed the same. Next time I'm doubling the recipe for sure.

I only made these because I had all of the ingredients and it seemed like a quick snack.  I used 1/4 cup of melted butter with a little oil instead of 1/2 cup butter, I increased the vanilla and used unsweetened macaroon coconut (they're just smaller flakes).

The cookies baked for 10 minutes and were nicely brown on the bottom.  Cookies were soft and chewy on the inside and slightly crisp around the edges.  I would probably bake them for a couple minutes longer next time to get more crisp.  The flavour was just okay for me - mild and not particularly sweet.  My fiance enjoyed them much more than I did; he said that they reminded him of the perfect Asian cookie.

I made these exactly per the directions and they turned out great.  Nice and chewy with great coconut flavor.  I used a cookie scoop filled level full and just turned them out onto a cookie sheet - baked for 12 minutes.  I got 38 cookies.  Yum!

My husband REALLY liked these.  The butter was a bit warm, so the cookies spread out to a thin cookie.  Didn't matter one bit.  They were DELISH.  I did double the coconut.  Maybe that messed it up?  Would definitely make these again.

I'm a big cookie fan and I love coconut. I was so excited to try this recipe. However, I think it could be more coconut used (it had very small taste of coconut, almost none). Also they did not become flat, stayed pretty round, I had to squeeze them to look like cookies. Mine were not ready in the middle so had to bake more until they bacame too hard. The 2nd time I made them smaller - they were chewy. Will definately make it again, will add some coconut or lemon extract instead of vanila.

This cookie was very sweet, moist and chewy. However, it was way too sweet and not enough coconut taste. It really tasted just like a sugar cookie. I was disappointed. And will not be saving this recipe.

This recipe is not to my liking.  Follow this and you'll get nothing more than overly sweet sugar cookies with coconut in them.  The cookies had very little "lift", most having a pocket of air in them but no real substance, let alone chewiness.  The amount of sugar also makes the cookies profoundly sweet and grainy.  Wouldn't recommend this recipe at all and don't understand the rave reviews one bit.

These are so good and so easy. Made them just as written and they were all I had hoped they would be. Crispy outside, chewy inside. I cooked mine on parchment and they took 12 minutes. Yum.

Fabulous and super easy. Made in no time and had all ingredients on hand. I did use crisco brand butter flavor shortening instead of plain butter. I think it makes it a little better and I do this for all cookie recipes.  My 6 year old hates coconut so I was surprised when she wanted to lick the spoon. One taste and she proclaimed, "Not bad....got any more?" Everyone loves them and these have definately made my holiday baking list. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Every time I have made these cookies my family and friends say they are the best they have had.  I add a teaspoon of vanilla, half teaspoon of coconut flavoring and a cup (or more) of white chocolate chips.  Sometimes I add a tablespoon or so extra flour to ensure that they do not flatten.  I agree with other reviewers that using good baking soda and chilling the dough is the key.  I mound mine in balls (golfball size) on the tray and cook for 13 minutes and they never come out flat or greasy.  Divine!

I added Rice Krispies to the batter and they were good!!  Tasted like a Ranger cookie only the recipes I've had for Ranger cookies have been horrible.  I've since made this cookie (w the added Rice Krispies) again.  It's a family favorite now.

These are fantastic as is! Crispy, buttery outside and a chewy coconut middle. Don't add a thing to these! No chips or toasting of coconut needed. I tried white chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, chocolate drizzle, etc. and plain was the best. My only addition was a 1/2 tsp of coconut extract and that made these slightly sweeter with a more pronounced coconut flavor. Keep recipe as is or add a touch of coconut extract. Delicious Cookie!

I followed the directions and they came out perfect!  I would bake for 10 minutes and I rolled mine into 3/4 " balls.  Next time i'm going to add white chocolate chips.  A definite winner cookie/.

Why are these cookies so good?  There are so few ingedients in them!  When I first cooked them, I thought they weren't cooking enough because they weren't browning but then I burned the bottom.  Please note, do not do what I did, they don't brown:)  Cook for the time listed and then pull them out and let them col for about 15 minutes so they harden enough to pull off the cookie sheet.

I tried to make it non-dairy but subbing applesauce for butter.  It works for most cookies but not these.  Baked for 35 minutes in a 8x8 pan it made a nice, moist cake.

Wonderful, very chewy.  I doubled the vanilla and added about 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  I plan to make this again except I'm going to add chocolate chips and dye them pastel blue and try to pass them off as easter cookies.

These were good, but definitely not enough coconut flavor for me. I even added extra coconut. I took others advice and added a little extra flour, which was a good idea otherwise they spread too much and were too thin. Next time I will use coconut extract in place of vanilla.

Simply divine!  I added 1 cup chocolate chips because I just can't resist that coconut-chocolate combination.  I also added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract in addition to the vanilla.  I chilled the dough and rolled into balls.  They came out the perfect thickness.  Great flavor and texture!

I just made these cookies today and they came out great! I dipped half of the cookie in chocolate (2/3 cup chocolate chips & 3 tblsp butter melted) after they cooled. I've already eaten 4...had to pack away the rest before I ate more...can't wait to bring these to work!

Fabulous cookie. Did have to bake them a bit longer approx. 12 minutes.  I added some leftover butterscotch chips I had and it improved an already delicious cookie.  Will be keeping this one.

A-MAY-ZING!!! These were so great that only about half of them made it out the door to the potluck I made them for. Good thing I made some other items or I would have had to stop by a store and pick up a dessert. Baker Beware!!

these are chewy, crispy and  simply said ---they are delicous cookies!! I will make again, as I really love coconut cookies and these fit the ticket! I chilled the dough for about 20 min. and I baked them for  11 min and left on the pan 2 min to cool and then removed to a wire rack to cool. I dipped half of cookie in dark choc - yummy!  I  only got 33 cookies from this recipe.

I LOVED this recipe!  It's tastes a lot like a chocolate chip cookie (and I think for the most part that's what the recipe is based on) with coconut.  My boys and nephews loved these and my 7 year old who hates coconut, loves these!  Next time I will dip them in milk chocolate as another person suggested.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

YUM-O....I thought these would be really plain...which was so wrong - they were just sweet enough & just enough coconut flavor...Also, when I first saw the mixed batter, I thought that we would be making only a few cookies....or just a bunch of small ones....One tsp or so really spreads out...making a cookie that is about 2 inches wide...My chocolate chip cooking loving husband really really loved these, too....Thank you & will make again   Very simple.

I made these and added the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting (found on this site) and then some sliced sugared strawberries. My sister said it was the best cookie she ever ate! Im going to try a drizzle of some semo-sweet chocolate over them next time. That cocnut really gives texture to the cookie.

I made these after finally caving into a long festering urge to bake cookies...lol:) Well, I followed the recipe exactly as is except for the vanilla and I thought about giving these a 4, but these are more a 3... they were too crispy, didn't rise enough, too sweet, and too buttery all at once. I still liked them a lot because I love coconut, but it wasn't quite this perfect coconut cookie that I was trying to recreate. Next time, I would add another 1/4th a cup of flour, make sure to roll them in balls and put in fridge for a while before baking, reduce butter by a couple of TB, reduce sugar to 3/4th a cup, and add some semisweet chocolate chips. That would be great:)

Wow.. wow.. wow.. These are soo good.. I am almost speachless!  I am not even a big fan of coconut.  And wow.. great. I read that someone else toasted their coconut, so I did the same, and I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract, and  a splash extra of vanilla.  They are soooo good!  Next time I make them I will use less sugar.  They are super sweet.  Also, I never am able to toast coconut or anything else for that matter in the oven, I always burn stuff.  So I toast my stuff on the stove top in a pan.  Takes a few minutes of stiring then done!  Hope that helps someone else!
UPDATE I know its only been a few minutes since I posted, but I decided to make another batch and I added toasted crushed almonds, and 1cup of chocolate chips.  If you like Almond Joy Candy Bars, then you would LOOOOVVVVEEE this cookie~!  Yummy

Just finished making these and they came out great!  My 3 kids loved them and they don't like coconut.  I only had sweetened coconut flakes and they still came out good.  I followed the recipe exactly but added a few chocolate chips to some of the batter.  I will definitely make again.  The only complaint is that it didn't make enough ;-)

Everyone in family loved this cookies! I loved how they were a little crunchy but chewy on the inside. Have made them twice already and will keep making them.

We really liked these. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, however they needed to bake for about 12-13 minutes in our oven.

These are so delicious!  I used coconut extract in place of the vanilla and added just under a cup each of macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips!  This made 36 nice "thick" cookies!  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

These are really good.  I did not alter at all, but I don't like teaspon cookies.  I used my scoop, and I got 20 cookies.  I also used my hands to mix the coconut into the dough.  I like the 11 1/2 to 12 mark.  I also smushed down my rounded tops some.  Thanks!

Hands down the best cookie recipe that I've seen.  I've used this recipe and added a few ingredients every time.  It doesn't just have to be coconut, but you can add macadamia nuts, chocolate morsels, even bananas.  The recipe is all around perfect.

I have a couple of friends who are vegan, so I decided to give this recipe a try with vegan substitutions and was delighted by the results.  

I replaced the butter with an organic (non-hydrogenated) vegetable shorting, and instead of the egg used 1/4 vanilla soy yogurt and 2.5 tbs ground flax seed whisked with 3 tbs water.  There were surprisingly moist, yet still chewy and delicious!  I made the recipe again the next day as noted and couldn't tell a difference in taste.  Toasting 1 cup of the coconut does add a nice dimension to the flavor too!

I added white chocolate chips and chopped macadamias, and they were wonderful! I couldn't stop eating them (though normally I'm pretty good at resisting), and everyone who tried them when I brought some home for Christmas raved about them.

Wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they were great.  I love chewy cookies.  My husband didn't like them much but he likes crispy cookies.  If you like coconut and you like chewy cookies, then these will be great for you.

If it was possible I would give this cookie 20 stars.  While I was making them, my friend came over and swore they were the best cookies she has ever had - I agree with her.  Thanks for such a simple, wonderful recipe.

The flavor of these cookies is good, and I love the crisp edge and chewy middle. But they're greasy. As I cooked each succeeding tray of cookies I tried things to help the greasiness. Chilled the dough... no difference. Raised temperature to 375...some improvement. Cooked on convection setting... not much difference. You definitely should not underbake these cookies, it makes the greasiness much more evident. Cook till well browned, they'll still be chewy in the middle. *Later that day*... OK, I admit, these cookies are MUCH better after they've cooled completely. The greasiness goes away. They're still flat, but my cookiemonster, who spit one out right after they were baked said "these are good now".

This had good flavor but we all thought there was too much butter in the cookies. I will try again using 6 T butter to see if they will be less greasy.

These cookies are simply heavenly, and very easy to make. The dough is quite stiff, and it took a bit of strength to fully incorporate the coconut into the dough, but any elbow grease was well worth it. Because the dough was very stiff, I rolled them into walnut sized balls and just flattened them with my hands because I was unsure that the would flatten out - they did and probably would have on their own! I put only nine cookies on a standard air-bake cookie sheet because these cookies do spread out a bit when they are baking. I also used parchment paper just to make the baking process faster and easier. My husband just about swooned when he tasted them. Because he likes a crisp cookie, I baked these about 12-14 minutes, until the edges were browning. They have a nice crunch to them, but they also retained that lovely chewiness. I also added about one cup of chopped walnuts to the doubled recipe - next time I will add even more nuts. I yielded about 45 2 to 2 1/2 cookies from the doubled recipe. This one is definitely a keeper. Even my picky mother, who fancies herself the best baker in the world, really liked these cookies. Thanks for sharing!

Normally I hate coconut and would never try any type of food with coconut in it. But, my family likes it and I thought I should make it seeing as all the reviews were saying how good it was. I followed the recipe exactly and added a 1/2 cup of toffee chips. baked them teaspoonfuls for exactly 8mins, top rack. They came out perfect. At first they will be really soft but if you let it cool, they harden a little. 
I just have to say that after you try this super duper amazingly delicious mouth watering drooling all over your face crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside coconut toffee cookies you'll never want to eat any other cookie again!!!

Excellent Cookies! I used a whole tsp of vanilla extract instead of just half tsp and the cookies came out perfect at 9 minutes for my oven. Chewy and crisp with a nice touch of coconut. Reminds me slightly of snickerdoodles as well.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but these just spread and looked very unappetizing (but did taste great).  I won't be trying this recipe again, but used it to make my own recipe for cookies in the mini muffin pan that come out like almond joy bars.

I upped the ante of coconut to 2 cups because I'm such a coconut freak and they came out fantastic. I also needed to cook them longer because of this but they are so well worth it. Still nice and chewy from the cookie tin (6 days later!)

SOOOOO GOOD!!!  Made these for Christmas goodies for the neighbors and got rave reviews! Since I could only find sweetened coconut, I cut down on the white sugar a little bit. I also used 1/2 coconut extract and 1/2 vanilla extract for flavoring.  These were so moist and delicious! One word of warning, make sure they cool completely before you package them up...I ended up with a clump of cookies on the bottom of my container because they stuck together....they still got eaten though!

I'm the one in my family that makes all the good cookies every Christmas - these are new to us but going into heavy rotation!  I had to buy extra stuff since the first batch got eaten right away, and I needed some to give out in baskets.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

These have no real issues - basically chocolate chip cookies with coconut instead.  But I think I was hoping they'd be more macaroon-y.  They're a little on the boring side, but still good.  I added chocolate chips near the end, after baking half the batch.  yummier.

I was quite disappointed in these. I made a huge batch of them, but found they just tasted "eggy" and bland, despite all of the coconut! My 5-yr-old son refused to eat more than half of one, and I have to say I forced myself to eat more - just so they weren't wasted! They also weren't chewy at all, but stiff like a regular biscuit. I followed the recipe and took note of peoples reviews, but I won't be making these again. They just weren't what I was expecting.

These are my absolute favorite cookies!! Doubling the batch is a must-doesnt make a whole lot. It is th eperfect recipe so dont change a thing! Original review(1/2/06): These cookies were sOoOOo GooOoOod!! They were so good that i immediately made a second batch. I didnt tweek the recipe at all. I think its right on. I was only able to make about 28 average sized cookies with one batch. I think this might make a good chocolate chip cookie dough, just but using the chips instead of the coconut flakes.Its just a thought, i havent tried that yet but i think i will.. or even doing both.. MMMm thats sounds good :)I think next time i will use, white chocolate chips with the flakes.Anyway.... 5 STAR recipe for sure!!!

I made these cookies today.  If you are like myself and tend to make large cookies (since a cookie can never be too big,) dont do it with these.  The cookies taste good but the flavor soon becomes overpowering therefore I strongly recommend preparing average sized cookies.  A minimun of 20 cookies out of the dough would probably be fine.     Happy baking!

I just made these for the first time, and though there were pretty good, it didnt deserve 5 stars.  For some reason, it tasted just a little salty to me (I use unsalted butter) but it may be just because I really dont use much morton salt (only a pinch here and there in baking since grey salt doesnt really stand up to baking and wont "disolve" into batters)  It may also be that I really dont like baking soda.  It had too much butter and even though the recipe doesnt say to roll the mounds into balls I did and I'm glad I did too (they would have flattened way too much and dried out otherwise)  Maybe the recipe calls for so much baking soday because there is so much butter that wont allow it to rise.  Next time I will use less of both and see how it goes.

Fantastic Recipe. Very Easy. I used 2 cups of sweetened coconut and eliminated the white sugar. I used 1 teaspoon of dough per cookie and got 50 cookies! Per others suggestions, I used 6 tbs of butter (this made the cookies puffy and light instead of flat). I tasted the batter before baking and it seemed bland. I divided the dough into sections to experiment w/ flavors (I added cocoa to one, dried orange peel to another, mix of chocolate and orange and made 1 plain). To my surprise, the plain one tasted best after cooking. The other flavors overwhelmed the coconut. Bake for 15 minutes for crispy cookies.

I was actually looking for a chewy coconut, white chocolate, cranberry cookie recipe that would compare to a cookie I bought at a specialty bakery out of state.  My suggestion is to roll the dough in balls so that the cookie doesn't spread out as much and add dried cranberries and white chocolate  for a unique taste.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that this just tastes like a chocolate chip cookie recipe without the chocolate chips. Nothing special

absolutely sinful!!! They were so easy to make and turned out fantastic. I did change the recipe a bit though. I changed the coconut to 1 1/2 heaping cups and added in some white chocolate chips. It was perfect!

Yum!  My boys gobbled these up!  To ensure the cookies were chewy (like we love), I rolled the droppings into small balls before placing them onto cookie sheets. This helped them not to spread much, and made them thicker (and chewier) in the middle.

These are awesome.  I love the chewiness and flavor.  Great Easter cookie!  I lined my cookie sheets with parchment because every coconut cookie I have ever made sticks.  These did stick a little but no breakage.  I don't know if the same would be true if using an ungreased pan.  Overall excellent cookie!!

I have made these several times and they are a BIG hit! I always double the batch and add chocolate chips to half the batch to those who like a little extra sweetness! The only thing I do different is I add 1/2 cup more coconut for a more coconut flavor. These are divine!

These are not a pretty cookie . . . they are flat, kind of greasy, and oh so good! They are chewy in the middle and slightly crisp around the edges. I wish they were a little less greasy, but I couldn't help myself from eating 4 of them as soon as they had cooled and firmed up enough to handle.

New favorite cookie. The are both chewy and crispy. I played with the recipe  just a bit. I used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, as well as adding  1/4 malted milk powder. Everything else remained pretty much the same. I used a mix of unsweetened and sweetened shredded coconut. These are so good I have already eaten three and they just came out of the oven.

These coconut cookies are perfect just as they are.   I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious.  The neighbors loved them! The next day I made them again but doubled the vanilla and used baking powder instead of baking soda. They were just as good as yesterday's cookies and the neighbors want more.  They get my highest recommendation.

These cookies are excellent! They came out just the way I like them--crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. For the second batch, I used rum extract in place of half the vanilla, and it made a terrific, buttery flavor.  This recipe will be one of my go-to's for entertaining.

This was really delicious! The local market was out of Swiss chard so I used spinach instead. Other than that I followed this recipe to the T!  We loved it and it was a lot of fun to cook. I totally recommend this!

Very nice taste, but a bit too greasy.  Also, like everyone said, the cookies came out flat.  I used brand new baking soda, and also my butter was at room temperature.  Still very good.

EDIT:
I tried these again, but regrigerated after one hour, and they came out much fluffier.  I recommend making big ones (53 g).  This way, you have a nice crispy outer edge, with a softer, chewy inside.  Delicious!!

Easy and delicious -- bumped up the vanilla to 1 tsp and added 1 1/2 cups of coconut.  Baked first batch at 10 minutes and they were soft so let cool on the pan before moving to wire rack. Second batch was in the oven for 12 minutes and were crispier.  Yummy!

I had some coconut that I needed to use up, so I tried these cookies. I added a smidge more vanilla and a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon! They are AMAZING! I'm getting ready to make another batch! :-)

I just finished baking a batch of these cookies and I loved them.  They were quick and easy to make too.  On my husband's request, I added 1 cup chopped pecans which turned out to be a perfect call.  I will definitely be making these cookies again.

These cookies are literally the best ever! I found this recipe sometime in May/ beginning of June and have made them a countless amount of times ever since (it's now the end of July). I normally would just make chocolate chip cookies and everyone thought they were great but after making these coconut cookies everybody wants coconut cookies and not chocolate chip! I bake mine for 10-12 minutes depending on how soft or crispy I want them to be and they always turn out perfectly! This is one recipe I can say never fails me!

I love this recipe! It was so simple and quick to make, I literally did everything in 15 minutes flat. The cookies turned out super chewy and very moist. Take them out when they are just lightly toasted, I made the mistake of letting them stay in the oven for too long and they got a bit brown. Will definitely give this a shot with macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips, like some users suggested!

I used butter flavoured Crisco and they still turned out great :) Not flat though, more of a fluffy, chewy type of cookie. Will make these again. Thank you!

Quick and easy recipe.  I substitute butter for coconut oil, added dash of cinnamon to the dry mix, and white chocolate.  My BF which hates healthy versions loves this cookie! very soft and moist.  I agree the mix seemed a bit wet so I added oats the first time and an extra 1/4 cup flour another.  Very Tasty!!

These were definetly great cookies! I did find them a little lacking in flavor and coconuty texture so next time, I'll be adding 1/4-1/3 cup more coconut. I also found them to be a little small so I would use about 2 teaspoons to get a decent size. I also got the best result when I baked them for 12 minutes.

Loved it! Made my version with whole grain flower and extra coconut. Next time will lower sugar to 1 cup brown and 1 cup white and limit baking to 8 min to make them more chewy and less sweet. Thanks for sharing!

I made 9 dozen of these cookies for a school bake sale.  I found that following the original recipe produced a flatter, slightly too sweet & oily cookie. With the next batch I added 1/4 c. flour and omitted the white sugar entirely, as I was using sweetened coconut flakes.  I also increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  This produced a more dome-shaped cookie, and the flavor was just right for me. To get 3 dozen from each batch I refrigerated the dough for an hour, then rolled it into 1 to 1 1/4 inch balls and baked at 350 degrees for 11 minutes.  With the original recipe this produced flatter 2 1/4 inch cookies; with the revised recipe the same sized dough balls produced 1 3/4 inch mounded cookies. (If I succeeded in uploading a comparison photo you'll see the original cookie on left and the revised recipe on right.)

This is a keeper.  I substituted applesauce for 1/4 of the butter and they turned out perfect and a lowfat version, I may add!
I also through some rice krispies in the mix going off another reviewers remarks.  I loved the added crunch!

I added one egg and enough flour to make the dough of rolling consistency. I rolled out the dough and cut out round shapes and placed on parchment lined cookie sheets. I sprinkled with sugar and baked about 8 minutes. This resulted in a wonderful cookie which was crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Saved the recipe to my favourites!

Made the cookies as per recipe, the only thing I was missing was the vanilla. Don't know, however, if adding the vanilla would take these cookies from a 3 star to a 5 star recipe. They looked appetizing and raised as they were supposed to, but found them too sugary and really lacking the "something special".

OMG these are wonderful. Do take others advice and increase flour from 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup to keep them from coming out greasy. For a more coconut taste use 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of coconut extract and add 1/4 more cup of coconut. My cookies came out nice and soft and just like the picture. If your cookies come out flat it could be out dated baking soda of the fact that you did not sift your flour. Fresh sifted flour will make them rise much more.  After the first pan I added 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. They came out tasting like a mounds bar. I will be baking them much more I'm sure. (*@*)

Followed the advice of others who've tried this before so used the 1 1/2 c flour and 1 1/2 c coconut---seems great; I didn't have coconut extract so added a few drops of almond extract and chopped up some chocolate chips in the chopper and added them to the mix; baked 9 minutes in my 350 oven--cooled outside where the temp is 30 F degrees; my daughter said it was her favorite cookie out of the 6 other varieties we've made this week!  Will make these again!!

These cookies are excellent and extremely easy to make. Mine came out not only very nice looking but also delicious! I read some reviewers' recommendations and tweaked the recipe a bit: I used canola oil (1/2 cup) instead of butter and baking powder instead of baking soda. I added another 1/2 tsp of vanilla and an extra 1/4 cup of flour. Perfection, let me tell you. I got 14 cookies in total but it's because I made them a bit larger (used my hands instead of a scoop). Baked them for exactly 13 minutes. I'll definitely make these again.

These are my "go to" cookies for whenever I need something to make. They are always a hit and have never let me down. Every time I make them I get complimented.

These are fantastic! I baked them a bit longer because they seemed too soft, but I use stoneware which often takes longer. I might half dip in some chocolate just to look prettier, but they are pretty great as is. We were thinking a single macadamia nut pressed in the middle might be nice too next time, or possibly a lime glaze. These are definitely making it into my regular rotation. Love them. I would like to tinker with the sugar content though, it's pretty high for my preferences.

My second year making these! They are so good. I make the recipe exactly as stated. I do double it because they are so good. Every time I take these to a get together they are gone. 

I did put some colored sugar on them while the dough was on the cookie sheet and they turned out really festive. The colored sugar spread out with the dough as it baked and is actually stuck in the dough, it is not loose and messy. They are festive!

Everyone loves this cookie but I did make a few changes. Definitely add about 1/4 more flour.  They'll have a much better consistency and height.  I also added mini-chocolate chips, 1/4 teaspoon of coconut extract, 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract and placed a whole untoasted almond on the top before baking.  Fabulous!  Kind of like an Almond Joy in cookie form.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to make cookies but didn't want to go to the market and I happened to already have all the ingredients. They turned out really well. I will say though, that the flavor changes as the cookies cool, which is actually kind of interesting. When they first come out of the oven and they're very hot they pretty much melt in your mouth which is awesome, later on though they do become somewhat chewy. But all in all, a really good cookie.

True to the name, they were very chewy! Very light and subtle taste, which can be good for those who want something to snack on but don't like the sweetness.

This is a great cookie. Moist and flavorful. I added more coconut, close to 3 cups , and a quarter teaspoon coconut extract.  Used a extra large egg, and dropped dough by heaping teaspoon. Baked for 11 minutes.

I just took these out of the oven and they are absolutely delish! I used a little less than 1/2 cup of melted coconut oil(just melt in microwave). I also use a melon ballet scoop for these and worked great.

Yummy & perfect coconut cookies. My choosy husband asked me to bake him something different for him. I followed the recipe exactly but i didn't spoon teaspoons full of mix onto the baking tray as i couldn't imagine what the shape would be like so i just scooped teaspoon fulls in my hands, made balls and pressed them down into small discs. Came out perfect in exact 10 mins at 170C in a fan forced oven. Looked good and tasted divine. These get crunchier out of oven as they cool down. My hubby and i thank you :)

Loved these tasty little treats. Very simple to make with the kids during the holidays. I too, toasted the coconut, and drizzled chocolate over the top just lightly something the kid loved doing. Thank you for the memories we will be doing these again.

I don't like coconut at all, but I made these cookies for my grandfather for the holidays. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I added about a half a cup extra coconut. Boyfriend was the taste tester and he loved them and said they had a wonderful texture.

I am  not a coconut fan, I wanted something different to send overseas to my husband.  Of couse I had to do a taste test to make sure they were at least edible (I am not a great cookie maker) and even I ate about 3 of these!  They were amazing!  I know those coconut fans will eat them right up!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Yum! These were great and so easy to make. I also threw in a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips since I'm a huge chocolate fan. I baked them for about 12 minutes, but found them to be a bit too underdone, so I stuck them in for 1 more and it was just the perfect amount of time.

Very good.  I love coconut and these are wonderful.  I made them for a meeting and they went over well.  Next time I am going to dip them in chocolate.  I LOVE mounds and almond joys.  This recipe will be used again and again!!!

I needed an easy treat for a baking swap. I started looking for recipes with ingrediants I had on hand. I went with coconut. I had to substitute oil for the butter and icing sugar for the white sugar. I tried 3 variations for this cookie, one was choco chip, the other white choco and the last the original. The original and choco chip was by far the best. My kids enjoyed them as did I. I am definitely going to try this recipe for my bake swap.  Thanks again!

I added mini chocolate chips to give it a bit of a different taste -  This is a wonderful, light coconut cookie.

These cookies were amazing! I followed the recipe exact, except I had no vanilla, so I added a bit of powdered vanilla pudding mix...also, I split the batch up three ways, 1st I did just plain coconut, second I added raisins, and the other ones I added chocolate chips. Just too see and change it up. All were great :)

These are awesome.  I substituted 1/4 cup of the butter w/applesauce, added 2 cups toasted  coconut, 1/2tsp coconut extract, 1/4 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp vanilla.  I used sweetened coconut so I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also used 1 cup of white/wheat flour w/1/2 cup all purpose flour.  They are chewy on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside. The best coconut cookies I've ever made!

Really good cookies.  Coconut is my flavor of choice recently and these were a great solution to that craving!  Very satisfying.  I really did only have to have just one.  I thew some milk chocolate chunks in the second batch, but the basic recipe is spot on.  Thanks for sharing!

My  6 y.o. wanted to make cookies. We looked @ our ingredients, found coconut and did a search for coconut cookies. We picked these. We are all so happy, these cookies are delicious! They have quickly become a FAV! Will make again, and again!

Found this recipe when I was looking for something different to bring to a refreshments table, for after a spring concert. I dipped some in chocolate and left some plain. Luckily I had made 3 times what I had been asked to make, because they FLEW off the table! People kept coming back for more! Awesome recipe. The only change I made was that I used a butter-flavored shortening instead of butter. They came out PERFECTLY! This is definitely on my "all-time favorites" list!

Mine turned out perfectly!  The only changes made were to add about 1/4 cup of flour, use a full teaspoon of vanilla and 2 cups of loosely packed sweetened coconut.  Very, very good cookies.

These are good and VERY easy. I gave four stars because there is nothing particularly special about them, but they are a nice change of pace and very easy to make. I will make these again, but I think I will add more coconut and perhaps a dash of lemon juice to give them a little more flavor.

I had some leftover coconut flakes and decided to make these since I had all the other ingredients on hand, and these are PERFECT! They have crispy edges and a soft, chewy center, and a good amount of coconut flavor. I used slightly more flour than called for in the recipe since I was worried that they might come out flat based on other reviews, and they came out fine. I will definitely be making these again.

pretty awesome cookies. I shredded my own coconut, therefore unsweetened coconut was used, and these cookies were plenty sweet, cut back on the sugar a bit.  and might improve with some macadamian nuts tossed in it.

I had a bag of sweetend coconut(7oz) that I needed to use up and I'm sooo glad I came across this recipe. I made the recipe as is but added 1/2 t baking powder b/c I like thicker cookies. I also added chopped cranraisins to half the cookies and drizzled them with chocolate. really good chewy cookies!

I had some mini chocolate chips and chopped almonds leftover from another recipe so I added about 1/2 c of each and they were wonderful.  My boyfriend even liked them and he does not like coconut.

This recipe is perfect as it is! I followed the recipe as it's written and they were perfectly thin (as they should be), crispy on the edges and chewy in the center. The flavor is delicate so if you're looking for a robust coconut cookie this isn't it. Next time I might try adding a touch of almond extract to make them a little richer...but maybe not. Thanks for this!

These tasted so good.  My daughter says they are 9.5 out of 10, 10 being the best cookie ever.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing:  I accidentally added 1/2 tsp baking powder.  After I did that, I just said, "Oh well" and added 1/2 tsp baking soda too.  They did not turn out flat at all.  I did not refrigerated the dough first.  I have another recipe for a different cookie that has both baking powder and baking soda, so I guess its okay to use both in one recipe.  I will add both again next time I make these. I had to cook them for exactly 13 minutes to get them perfect.

best cookies i've ever made or eaten!  and they went together so easy--just mix and spoon.  I dipped mine in raw sugar before baking and it added a delightful sugary crust.  they're light and not overly sweet, and have a lovely coconut flavor.  i used coconut powder in mine, so the texture was light and soft.    wonderful cookies!  i will be using this as my go-to cookie recipe!

No need to refrigerate before baking & no need to toast coconut.  Excellant cookies!  I used almond extract with tiny bit of vanilla extract & added 1/4 cup more coconut.

These were good. We tried them with gumdrops in it and it was terrible and it turns out my kids don't like coconut. However, all the adults that ate it said the cookie itself was pretty tasty!

Love love love these cookies.  So yummy.... wondering if you could add oatmeal to them?  My 3 year old loves them too.  Quick easy, little mess...  however we only got about 22 cookies out of the batch... rolled into balls.

I am SO glad I decided to make this cookie!  I was hesitant because of some of the reviews.  I followed the recipe - my only change was to add an additional 1/8tsp coconut extract along with 1 tsp vanilla extract.  These cookies are crisp around the edges, chewy in the middle, coconutty and absolutely delicious.  I will definately be making them again!!!

Great flavor but I did have to bake about 3 extra minutes.  Very thin cookie, and they don't look anything like the picture but the taste was great!  Sweet and coconutty!

These are some of the best cookies I've ever made! I made 8x the recipe to serve them at my brother-in-law's wedding reception and they were a huge hit. I also love them with added nuts. So far, I've tried them once with almonds and once with pecans. Yummy!

These are delicious, I made the dough, shaped into balls, placed on my baking sheet, and allowed them to chill in the fridge for a few hours before baking them. My husband and kids loved them, thanks for a great recipe!

These were a hit. Very simple to make but I opted for a larger size cookie instead of the recommended "teaspoon", I made a 1" sized ball. I am going to try the coconut flavoring in place of the vanilla next time although they were great this way.

Wow. These taste amazing, they call for lots of coconut and that is what makes these delicious. I had very flat cookies and am almost positive my baking soda is expired (after reading the helpful reviews, thanks guys!) as I rarely use it. But actually, I was prepared to give these five stars regardless. The butter:flour ratio is a little higher than a lot of recipes I've made, and with all the coconut that translates to a rich, satisfying cookie perfect for coffee/tea/entertaining. I agree these cookies should stand by themselves, I was all set to add a chocolate glaze and toasted almonds on top but they really don't need it. Getting back to the flat thing, that was one of the aspects I liked about them: I will try with fresh baking soda but as I love chewy cookies as opposed to cakelike I might cut down/eliminate it all together. I am no expert baker though, so I'd recommend trying the recipe exactly as written before even thinking about listening to me: it is superb. Thanks so much for sharing with us!

YyYYYYYyyum!!!  Perfectly chewy and delicately coconutty cookie! I love this recipe! Recipe says teaspoon-size, I used my large scoop for these and made sure to mound them up nicely. I'm not sure such a small cookie would turn out as chewy and amazing as a larger cookie. Who knows. But I found them to be incredible! And adding chocolate chips to some of them...out of this world. =) A little on the buttery/greasy side, especially right out of the oven. But the next day they seem better - if they last that long =)

really tasty!  be careful not to overbake otherwise they lose their chewiness -- take them off the baking tray while they're still a little gooey in the middle.  i think these cookies would be even more excellent with some white chocolate chips.

This is a great recipe. I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I also added 2 tsps of vanilla extract instead of 1/2 a tsp and also a 1/2 tsp of almond extract to keep the dough moist.

Delicious!  I made very few changes from the recipe.  I doubled the vanilla, cooled the dough for 30 minutes in the fridge and rolled into golf ball size.  I let them bake for about 13-15 minutes tille t hey were a light caramel color. and cooledo n a rack.   Perfect cookies! crunchy outside and soft inside, yummy!

very nice. the taste is subtle, texture is nice crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I replaced the egg for a little less than 1/2 cup of applesauce. I used a pinch of salt. I am thinking that next I might add some lemon zest/juice. I had to cook them for 18 min.

FIVE STARS ++++!!!  I added one package of Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chips, and used a full 12-ounce bag of coconut.  The first batch or so flattened out a bit, but once I rolled the dough, I ended up with puffy, chewy cookies.  Love this recipe!

Hey everyone, I made these and they are a keeper.  I made them even better by rolling the dough balls in more coconut before baking.  you kinda have to roll each ball around in the coconut and pick them up and lightly press and roll in your hand to make the coconut stick.  bake , cool, then drizzle the tops with melted chocolate[semi sweet].  I like to drizzle in cris cross stripes.

Very good cookie! It needs to be baked a little longer, 11-13 minutes. I will use less sugar next time, just a preference.

I've made a couple batches of these recently for Chrismas cookies..I absolutely loved the taste of these & they don't last very long in my house! I would receommend definetly 'doubling' the recipe as the normal recipe won't make much. I followed the original recipe to the tee both times (the only thing I didn't like was the fact that the cookies are rather flat) Next time I will follow the other reviewer's advice & add an extra 1/4 C. flour to the mixture & maybe a little more coconut? Here's a tip I used to get them to have a nice round shape after baking. i still do the 'teaspoonful' for the cookie, but roll them into balls, then flatten them just a tad before putting them in the oven. They have a much better appearance this way. Good cookie w/a buttery flavor & not overowering w/the coconut..very chewy & good! Love these..

These are the best coconut cookies I ever made.  They're almost like a macaroon.  The puff up big in the oven but collapse when taken out, they're crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. They were wonderful made just like the recipe, but I could see them with the addition of macadamia nuts for a really decadent goodie.  They also are super easy to make. The recipe made 24 cookies using a rounded teaspoon.

These are incredible, I absolutely enjoyed them..the only change I made was 1tsp. vanilla extract, 2c of coconut and bake for 13mins. Some I dipped in semi sweet chocolate and some with chopped walnuts. They were good with out chocolate and walnuts added.. Guess what......I WILL BE MAKING THEM AGAIN SOON.

I make these constantly now!! I always add 1 cup chocolate chips or butterscotch chips and they disappear so fast in my house. Love this recipe!! Mine are done in exactly 9 minutes. They dont look like they'd be ready when I take them out, but any longer and they wont stay soft and chewy. They are perfect!! Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!

AMAZING!!! even though i was sufficiently warned i still thought these would be dry... and they were so not dry! i added another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, but that's just because my sister and i are vanilla fanatics... awesome crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside, just the way i like it!!!

Love these cookies, great tasting and last for days if you can hide them from family and friends! I took other reviewers suggestions and toasted the coconut as well as add 1 full tsp of vanilla. After making several batches I puchased coconut extract and add 1/4 tsp....what a huge difference in the taste. For the top of the cookies I either sprinkle sanding sugar before baking or drizzle with melted chocolate when cookies are cool. ( taste like a Mounds bar ) Also made a batch with walnuts, raisins and chocolate chips which were very good. These cookies will be in my Christmas baskets for sure.

The reviews made me give this a try. They were super easy to make. I used unsweetened coconut since it didn't specify. Hubby liked them. I thought they were just OK, but I'm not a coconut person.

These are the new favorite cookies at our house.  I used 2 cups of coconut and replaced the vanilla with coconut extract.  The only problem is that the recipe doesn't make enough cookies!  Next time I'll double it.

I made this recipe exactly as it said, but doubled it and almost doubled the vanilla (I love a little extra vanilla in just about everything).  The dough looked a little too runny, but it turned out great.  Flatten a little, when you put the dough on the sheet and they won't be puffy.  I think this is one of the best cookies I've ever tasted.  If you don't like coconut, you will still love these, mine barely tasted like coconut, but had a wonderful texture and the smell was brilliant.

Delicious!  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I added 3/4 cup each chopped walnuts and chocolate chips, plus 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract.  Did not chill the dough.  Used a small cookie scoop and flattened them just a tad on the cookie sheet; as the first batch I made were a little too thick.  Got approximately 2 dozen cookies.  Baked for 15 minutes.

Fantastic!! My wife has been on a no-dairy diet since the arrival of our newest little bundle of joy and I've been HURTING to find recipes that use no milk products and still taste like something you actually want to eat! With the simple modification of using vegan margarine in place of the butter we've found one of our newest favorites! Thanks so much for a super recipe to help cure our sweet-tooth!

These are ok, but I had to add a teaspoon of coconut extract to give the cookies enough coconut flavor. I chilled the dough overnight, but they still spread, and the recipe makes nowhere near 36 cookies. They definitely are chewy, but I don't think I'd make them again.

My mom and I made these as part of our Saturday baking ritual.  Ours don't look quite like the recipe photo but it will make for a nice baked gift for someone. The baking time will depend on the size of your 'drop' or spoon size used.  To be safe watch after 8 min and every 1-2 minutes if your oven tends to be hotter than average. It definitely is chewy in the middle and crisp on the edges.

These were good cookies, but just not 5 star cookies.  I think next time I might try dipping them in chocolate, that might make it a 5 star cookie.

WOW! These are the best darn cookies I have ever had! They are chewy, coconut-y, and GREAT! I made the recipe just as directed, except without vanilla because I was out. If you like coconut and chewy cookies, you will love these! Mine took about 13-15 minutes and made 23 cookies. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Delicious, chewy cookie. I used a large scoop, so one batch made only 13 large cookies, and baked for 15 minutes. Followed recipe exactly otherwise.

These were hit and miss.  They didn't disappear as quickly as other types of cookies, but they had a nice consistency and a mild taste.  Probably wouldn't make them again unless I had coconut on hand.

Excellent recipe. The recipe didn't say whether to use soften butter or not. I used softened butter and they came out perfect. I also took the advice of others:I did some with chocolate chips, some with macadamian nuts, and some plain. My family LOVED THEM!!!

I made these today following the recipe exactly as written except I took the advice of others and added chocolate chips.  The cookies were chewy, but not anything out of the ordinary, in my opinion.  I probably will not make them again.

Perfect Yummy Cookie. Next time I would use only 1/8 tsp of salt.

Just finished making these.  I did a double batch since the reviews were so good. Only change I made was add Special Dark Hershey choco chips and an extra half teaspoon of vanilla.  These cookies were chewy and had good look/texture, just a little bland.  i'm not a very good cook, but maybe needs a spice or more coconut flavoring?

I just got done baking these. The whole family couldn't keep their hands off them. Absolutely perfect the way they are. I may try to add almond extract instead of vanilla to see if it gives it that chineses cookie taste. Also a great basic cookie dough recipe to make a multitude of varieties. Thanks so much for posting

I was not expecting to like these cookies.  I actually made them only because I had all the ingredients on hand.  However, they are excellent cookies!!  A definite keeper!

One of the best cookies I have ever baked. My family loves them! I have had to stop making them, because we eat all of them in one day.I added chocolate chips to them. Thanks for the recipe, these are the BEST!

Okay, I guess I'm contradicting the reviewer right before me, but I really think you have to like coconut to like these cookies.  Coconut is the only flavor to be had!  They are very good though--I like coconut!  They came out flat for me, but I actually perfer that bc then I can stack them.  I left the dough in the fridge overnight and am finishing up baking them now.  I put them in the oven for 12 min each and let them cool slightly on the cookie sheet before putting them on the cooling rack.  They are wonderfully chewy and coconuty.  thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe and used shredded coconut instead of flaked because it was all I had.  My family loved them.  A double batch almost disappeared in an evening.  They're very soft and chewy and great for dunking in milk.

These were fine - not the best cookies I've ever had...I did add white chocolate chips to the batter.  I think next time I would add semi-sweet chocolate chips instead for a little more flavor.  My cookies came out quite thin - I read from another review that this might be caused by older baking soda - it might be time for me to get a new box!  Also, I would recommend greasing your cookie sheet even though the recipe says "ungreased."

Great recipe! The dough was quite crumbly but they turned out great I just pinched them together. I wasn't sure if they were done at 8 minutes but I found even though they were very soft still in the middle they stiffened up and were very chewy. They only need to be lightly browned. If you like coconut you will like these cookies!!!

These are wonderful cookies...sort of a cross between a chewy macaroon and a regular cookie. I must admit that I put the recipe together first thing in the morning when I was half asleep and later I realized, that even though I had doubled the recipe, had only put in 1 cube of butter (1/2 cup) instead of one full cup. Well..serendipity.. they were great! Before baking I rolled them in walnut size balls then dipped the top of the ball in a little shredded coconut..which slightly toasted while baking, looked nice and people at church knew what they were getting inside.

I've made these twice; the first time exactly as stated in the recipe.  The second time, I used coconut extract and more coconut flakes.  EXCELLENT for those of us who require more pop in the chops.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

the cookies were OK following the recipe exactly. they're a little plain. however i did a side batch with extra sugar and chocolate chips and those were awesome!   also the serving size is way off. my recipe yielded about half the amount, i like regular size cookies. if i did teeny-tiny ones, maybe i would have had 36 as says.   easy & good recipe nonetheless. lots of room for experimentation!

with a few adjustments..these cookies were perfect!! i added a whole teaspoon of baking soda, because i wanted them to rise a little more. also, i added only about 2 tablespoons of white sugar, because i was going to use sweetened coconut. then i drizzled with some chocolate...perfect!! they were gone in less than an hour!!

My husband & I both loved these! I have to admit to changing it up just a bit. I decreased the white sugar by 1/4 cup, upped the vanilla to 1 tsp and, used 1 cup unbleached wheat flour & 1 3/4 cup white flour, and 1/3 cup finely chopped pecans.

I was so glad to find a recipe that could use up some leftover coconut I had in my cupboard, and was even happier that it was a GOOD recipe!  I took other reviewer's advice and used 1 teaspoon vanilla instead of a 1/2, and although the cookies are sweet, we loved them.  Thank you for this recipe!

These are really good! I added 1/4 cup chocolate chips as well. I like that they're crunchy on the outside but chewy on the inside. I think they turned out a little greasy, don't know if they're supposed to be like that but they're still great.

These cookies were really flavourful and 'coconutty.' I put the batter in the fridge for an hour or two and then rolled them out into balls. However, I was a bit to cautious and didn't push them down as thin as I would like - I found the cookies hardly spread out at all. Next time I will either decrease the amount of refrigeration time or take the liberty of pressing them down a little harder. I also didn't find the cookies browned as nicely in the oven whereas the bottoms were already quite brown, but I believe this again had to do with the thicker, denser cookies. I will definitely make this again with above alterations, as my family really enjoyed them.

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe states the first time and they were very good but I made a second batch and increased the vanilla to 1tsp. and coconut to 2 cups - perfect! Everyone loves them.

I just made the cookies and all I can say is OMG !!! They are so good, I used sweetened coconut and 1 less tablespoon sugar.  I got 36 cookies, and the last dozen I added 1/4 cup cranraisins, 1/4 tsp. orange zest and 1/4 tsp. orange extract.  I now HAVE to make another batch all with cranraisins (cranberries) and the extract and zest, these may be the best tasting cookies I have ever made.

Great cookies.  Recipe didn't specify what kind of flaked coconut, and sweetened is what I had on hand so that's what I used.  I may try a little less sugar next time.  I did add extra vanilla as well.  My cookies are a always a little larger than they're supposed to be but I still got 21 out of the recipe though they definitely needed an extra 3 or so minutes in the oven.  I also mixed all ingredients in one bowl after creaming the wet ingredients to save on dishes :)  No issues with rising.  Still great texture and moistness and I used low fat Becel instead of butter.

I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies are amazing!  I was getting frustrated mixing the ingredients because it was so stiff, but I was able to actually use my hands to roll them into balls... and they are so good.  The texture is crunchy, yet the cookies are surprisingly chewy.  They are just sweet enough without being too sweet.  I will keep this recipe to make again and again!!

These were great.  I added 3/4 of white chocolate chips as well.  I think the sweetness of the cocnut and chips brought out the buttery flavor of the cookies.  They needed 12 minutes.  Will definitely make them again.  Might try adding some coconut extract sometime as I thought the coconut flavor could have been a bit more pronounced.

Wow!  These cookies are insanely good! Super chewy and great flavor.  These may become my new favorite cookie!  My baking time was about 12 minutes per sheet though stuff usually always takes longer in my oven.

These cookies were absolutely perfect following the recipe as is.  They are great freezer cookies, since they stay chewy even when they're cold.  I think they may have even topped my favorites list as far as cookies go.  :)

These cookies were excellant, after making them 3 times I finally figured out that I shouldn't be microwaving the butter to soften it prior to making these because they turn out flat, but nevertheless they were still delicious.

All I have to say is that these cookies are AWESOME!!!  I added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans.  And I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and only 1/4 of white sugar.  I used sweetned flaked coconut because that was all I had and did not find that the cookies were too sweet.  My cookies stayed in the oven for about 15 minutes.  The first batch I only left in for 13 minutes and found them to still be a bit too soft.  Next time I make them I'm going to add butterscotch chips!  YUMM!!!!

There aren't enough stars for these cookies! I did alter the recipe a bit - I used half butter/half butter-flavored Crisco; added the suggested white chocolate chips and finely chopped macadamia nuts (because I had them both on hand). These cookies are on our "top list" and I can't imagine that my alterations made any difference ... YUMMY!

I'm pretty sure I ate all but maybe a dozen cookies, had to share.  Since I was a pig with these cookies I won't be making very soon, but I guarantee when I need a coconut fix, I'll be making these again.  I followed the recipe exactly and maybe next time I'll try it with coconut extract like some others have done.  Thanks for a great and yummy recipe.

I LOVED THESE COOKIES.  They taste great without any alterations but I've read so many reviews about altering them with white chocolate and stuff, I can't wait to play with this recipe.  I handed one to my husband after they cooled off a bit, and Mr. Picky loved them too.  Thanks so much!  Will save this recipe for sure!

Add another fan to the list.  I decrease the white sugar to half the listed amount, and use half a real vanilla bean per batch.  There's no comparison the extract.  Works great as a vegan sweet too with egg replacement and Earth Balance margarine.

These are fantastic!  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and the rest, light brown sugar.  They were wonderful.  I added chopped pecans to some, and the others, I dipped in melted chocolate and then sprinkled on the coconut (see picture).
Thanks for the recipe!

My husband calls these the "DANGEROUS" cookies... because as long as they are present in the house he can't leave them alone!!  These are hands down the most unique and yummy cookie I've made. I tried the frosted flakes another reviewer said she added and W-O-W.  The frosted flakes are definitely a must... and don't overbake! They need to be slightly underbaked to keep their chewy consistency.  Enjoy!!

These cookies are delish!!! I made them for the first time yesterday, for Christmas, but I don't think they will make it that long. I did increase the vanilla amount ot 1 tsp, and added white chocolate chips, It is very good! I highly recommmend these!

One reviewer suggested that these cookies were too plain; however, I think that is part of what makes them so great.  They are customizable to one's tastes. I drizzled them with milk chocolate, which not only made them lovely enough for my cookie tray, but added to the flavor.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon, and added an additional 1/4 c of coconut.  The coconut flavor was a bit mild for my liking, so coconut extract would be a nice addition.  They do turn out very thin, but chilling the dough for 1 hour helped considerably.  I ended up with 45 medium-sized cookies.

Love, love, love these cookies!  They are perfect as is, but I'm looking forward to using it as a base recipe with other ingredients - nuts, chocolate chips, toffee bits, etc.  I like a soft chewy cookie, but I find many soft cookies are soft only because they are underbaked.  These were thoroughly baked and still remained soft.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Good cookie. I followed the recipe and got 3 dozen cookies using tsp to drop cookie dough. Baked mine for 11 minutes. The first ones were real flat so I put dough in fridge and that helps a little but very little. Its still a flat cookie! Next time I would add more vanilla or try it with coconut flavoring. Also think it would be better  chocolate dipped or drizzle on top. They taste best after they have cooled off.

These are really good.  It's a very simple cookie...almost like a sugar cookie with coconut.  The consistency is perfect--crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.

I've made these cookies for years, and figured it's high time I'd say something about them. They're really moist and chewy, which is how I love cookies, and my husband, who doesn't really like sweets, can't resist them either. We always end up eating them as soon as they cool enough to be handled.

This recipe is great! It has a whole lot of potential. I love the chewy inside and crisp outside. After my first batch I felt they could be improved so made these adjustments. 1. Upped vanilla to 1tsp. 2. Added 1/2 tsp coconut essence. 3. Divided batter in two then added white choc chips to one half and dark choc chips and chopped up glazed red cherries to the other half. They were fantastic!  Especially the "cherry ripe" ones. Thanks for this yummy chewy recipe!

not bad. definately add almond extract to enhance coconut flavor. I rolled them into balls a little smaller than walnuts. Also the first batch I baked for 8 min and they were a little too done so I only baked the rest 7 minutes and they turned out perfect.

These cookies were incredibly easy to make, which should have clued me in to the fact that they would not have extraordinary flavor.  I found them to be extremely bland.  Also, I made a double batch and only yielded about 40 cookies altogether, which makes me wonder how the original recipe could possibly have yielded 36 cookies.  In the second half of the batter, I added a cup of chocolate chips.  This GREATLY improved the flavor and quality of the cookies.  They were chewey and gooey, the perfect combination!  I recommend that if you plan to use this recipe, you alter it, as I did, by adding chocolate chips (or as another poster did, toffee chips) or your favorite candy.  If you do that, you should be okay.  The recipe on its own is nothing to write home about.

This recipe is super easy and really refreshing.  I think maybe the only thing that would top it off would be to add toffee bits.  Although, if I did that I might degrease the sugar a bit.  Yummy cookie!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some shredded coconut I bought for another recipe.  I found exactly what I was looking for.  I'm not a big fan of coconut but these were fantastic.  Although they did come out a bit flat, the taste made up for what they lacked in presentation.  Next I will try adding a bit more flour and put in the fridge before baking as suggested by others.

These turned out just like the picture!  I was a bit skeptical when I saw the consistency of the dough, but this recipe works great just as written.  I served them with vanilla icecream for dessert, and gave the rest away as gifts.  Yummy!

Everybody loved these cookies - even my kids who hate coconut.  I took the advice of one of the other raters and added coconut flavoring and a little extra flour and they made 3 dozen medium sized cookies.  I added white chocolate and macadamia nuts the second time...SO yummy!

Coconut lover's have found the cookie!!
On to making another batch today to cure the craving for more. Chewy & crunchy but not too sweet- but sweet enough to enjoy the taste of coconut.

Loved them!  I used 1 cup flaked coconut and 1/3 cup dessicated so I could have the flavor without it being too sweet.  Perfect.

I've made several coconut cookie recipes in the past. This was the best! Will definitely be making again. Note: a week after making these cookies my 19 yr old son asked me if I would make another batch. He said they were the best cookies he'd ever had!  Just made these for the 100th time and decided to add Heath Bar chips for the heck of it. I added about 75% of the bag (I ate the other 25% LOL). I had a friend over and he could not stop eating them.  He commented several times this week about the cookies and asked me to please make them again.

These cookies are great! I have made them twice now since finding the recipe last week. I made the second batch with whole wheat flour instead of the white and I also added in about a tsp of coconut extract along with the vanilla and a generous squirt of lime juice. 

If you do use the whole wheat I would suggest that you press the cookies with a floured hand before baking to flatten a bit. I also rolled some of the balls in sugar before pressing down.

Absolutely fabulous!! These cookies were very easy to make, and very quick as well. I took one of the reviewer’s advice and rolled them into balls and pressed down with a fork. Turned out amazingly good and looked pretty as well. I did up the vanilla to 1 teaspoon.

I just made these last night.  I followed the recipe exactly (did not adjust the flour) and added some chopped pecans.  They are wonderful!  Not flat, perfectly chewy.  I couldn't really taste the coconut at first, but had a couple this morning with my coffee and the flavor seemed to have developed overnight!  I will most definately make these again.  I'm thinking some pineapple would make them very tropical for the summer months!  Thank you!

I thought these cookies were OK .. so then with the second batch i jazzed them up and i  rolled them into balls and then rolled them into a LITTLE bit of coconut with cinimon, and pressed down on them in the middle and refridgerated for a while so when i baked them they maintained their shape :) - they were AWESOME then :)

These were pretty good.  Make sure not to overbake these.  They should be soft in the middle when cooled.  These would be really good with some mini chocolate chips mixed in.

These were a very chewy, moist, tasty cookie.  I added 1/4 cup additional flour as suggested and they turned out fine.  Crisp on the bottom and chewy in the center.  They were a little flat, but, that didn't stop my children from devouring them.  I added a 1/2 tsp. more vanilla.  I baked them on a silpat and they were perfect.

These cookies were delightful! Sweet, chewy, delicious. :) Like another reviewer I solved the "flat cookie" problem by adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour. I also agree with another reviewer that there is no way you can get 36 cookies out of this. I got 14 using just over a teaspoon of batter for each cookie.

These are some GREAT cookies! After reading the reviews, I added an extra 1/4 Cup of flour to avoid the thin flat shape. I also added walnuts, but will try macadamia nuts next time.

FAST - EASY AND OOOOOOOHHH SO GOOD!  Ditto to every FIVE STAR REVIEW! I added a little extra coconut (probably closer to 1 2/3 cu), and used my most FAV secret ingred **MEXICAN VANILLA** in place of the reg vanilla. OFF THE CHART for good flavor. They've served these gems in our cafeteria and we've been trying to peg the recipe...and THIS IS IT! Next time I'll put in some chopped Macadamia nuts, and possibly some white chocolate chips but this recipe stands well JUST AS IT IS.  Oh...they did take a bit longer to bake. It was more like 13-15 min with my oven.

Fabulously simple recipe that my husband is absolutely crazy about (thank goodness, because I was getting tired of baking peanut butter cookies all the time)!  He's not the only one-I think they are most definitely one of the best cookies I've ever had.  A couple of baking tips--I prefer baking my cookies on a baking stone.  These cookies do not bake well on these stones, and even on cookie sheets, some ovens may need fifteen minutes to bake to perfection.  Wonderful, wonderful cookies!  Thank you!

I read couple of reviews that thought it needed less butter and was nothing special, BUT OUR FAMILY LOVED THEM!  I didn't change a thing in this recipe, but I did melt some semi sweet chips (1/2 C) and drizzled lines of chocolate across them once they had cooled, they looked and tasted like they came from a bakery!

Great Recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added milk chocolate chips and it came out great! For me bake time was like 11-12 minutes. People who ate them said they would pay money for them- so you know they had to be good.
An update to above I added chopped macadamia nuts with the milk chocolate chips- they were out of this world.  I could eat the whole batch with a glass of milk!

These cookies turned out fantastic!  I added about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips, and they were delicious.  I did follow the suggestions of others:  I watched the cooking time, and I shaped them into balls before baking.  They were perfectly chewy.  Thanks for the great recipe, N. Hoff!

These are very good.  Very buttery.  I used fresh coconut that I grated.  (Unfortunately, my son doesn't like them, so I'll have to give most of them away so I won't eat them all!)  The batch made about 30 cookies.

These were great!  I used one cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat.  I added about 1/2 cup toasted chopped walnuts.  The flavor of the nuts really complements the coconut.  These were sooo good.  I used my cookie scoop and only got about two dozen, if that.

Excellent cookie!  I, of course, couldn't leave well enough alone, so I dipped one end in bittersweet chocolate.  Mini chocolate chips in the batter would have been good, as well.

I made these last night for a church picnic. They were a big hit.  Some even said they were the best cookies they had ever tasted.  Next time I may add a bit more flour.  I also found refrigerating them made them not spread quite so much and baking them on parchment paper helped too! Yummy!!

These were pretty good. I melted some chocolate chips and drizzled them over the top. Not bad!

YUM YUM YUM!!!!  I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, toasted coconut, and added brownie chips (like chocolate chips but a little different) to half the cookie dough.  Everyone preferred the plain coconut cookies, though!!  I will definitely make these again!!!

These cookies were easy and tasty.  I had only put them in the oven for 6min and 30s though because when I had them in for 8min they burnt.  It may just be my old oven, but if you make this, be sure to keep an eye on them after 6 min or so to see what will work out best.  Also, be sure to cool them on the rack.  They are so soft that if you take them off after about 10 min, the middle is still warm and the cookie will scrunch up.  My dad gobbled these down!

Very good cookie! Half of the batch, I added a half cup chocochips and I liked those better than the plain ones! I would suggest adding the chocolate chips.

Good - but not fabulous - nice and chewy - they flatten out quite a bit so you really do only need a teaspoonful for each cookie - my batch made 45 cookies. Quick and easy!

These were the first coconut cookies that I've made becuase my family members aren't to big of coconut fans.  But I love coconut and these were very good!  They were so soft and tasty!  Next time I'm going to add white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.  I'm definitely going to be making these again!

Yum! :) I never quite manage to make nice drop cookies, since they always end
up all flat and in irregular shapes - but these are an exception! The dough's
texture is so perfect, that the cookies stay nicely shaped. They're also extremely
easy to make and truly delicious!

I just made this for the first time and it's amazing! I made it with gluten free flour, and substituted 2 TBSP maple syrup for the brown sugar and 2 TBSP honey for the white sugar. Definitely my new go-to cookie!

I toasted some coconut and chilled for an hour before baking. Also added soda and BP to try for puffing up. Did not work. Next time I will go to the oatmeal and 2 eggs recipe that I have seen and more of the BP and soda and coconut. Also will up oven temp to 375.

easy to make, they are chewy but they are very greasy. It's either too much butter or not enough flour and coconut. When eating them, your finger get greasy. Would not make it again.

These turned out really good. The only two changes I made was to split the extract into 1/2 vanilla and the other 1/2 coconut as well as adding an extract 1/2 tbsp of flour (per another cook's suggestion). Here are the changes I would reccomend: divide the extract or use all coconut and add a little more shredded coconut. The cookies took 9 minutes to bake. They will not look completely done but pull them out anyways, they will set. I made drop cookies roughly 1-1.5 tsp in size so I ended up with 23 vs. 36 cookies.

I would make it again, but the cookies needed to bake for a longer time then it said in the directions. Therefore these cookies were very good but the time to bake them need to be longer.

I felt like this recipe needs about 1/2 the sugar esp when using sweetened coconut flakes, and a little more salt for balance!

These were hugely popular in my home.  I am embarrassed to say but we ate three dozen (I doubled the batch) in 24 hours!  I used slightly less sugar and made half the dough with chocolate chips.  The chocky option was delicious but drowned out the coconut flavor unfortunately.

White chocolate chips are a good addition as well.

Delicious cookies with a great flavor. Made them for work and got several requests to make more. 

I tend to add about 1.75x to double to amount of coconut in the cookies. It makes them a lot more chewy.

These are so good. I just took the first batch out of the oven.

The only change I made was to add lemon zest...because I love the flavor.

Very soft..a little crispy on edges...just how I love them.  Great coconut flavor. I would for sure make these again...

Great recipe!!   Just for fun I made a couple of changes.  I reduced the coconut to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of canned pineapple chunks.   They turned out nice a soft on the inside and the butter gave a nice crunch to the bottom of the cookie.  The flavor was melt in your mouth fantastic!

I've been making these for years and it's my family's favorite cookie. I do double the vanilla just because I do that in all the cookies I bake. I just finished a batch for my grandson not more than 15 minutes ago.

These were okay.  They had a nice texture, they were soft inside and crispy on the outside.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and they had a nice thickness (they didn't flatten out as others mentioned).  However, similar to others' comments, they were not very coconutty.  The flavor was a little bland and boring.

Yummy cookies!  Made slight adjustment on the sugar as we don't eat as much sugar.  Cut down the sugar to 1/4C brown and 1/4C white instead of 1/2 C of each.  Came out very delicious.  Topped with a small tsp of saskatoon berry jam.  Delicious!

Cookies are tasty. They look beautiful in the oven,  but after I pull them out they go flat. When I bake them in NYC they look awesome. I’m not sure if it’s the climate or what?
I double the recipe but still only get 3 dozen cookies ??

I only made one change, which was to increase the cooking time to 11-13 minutes as per another review. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and these are some of the best cookies I've ever made. I've made them a handful of times now for different holidays, events, or just cause we want some cookies, and they turn out delicious every time. Even people who are skeptical of a coconut cookie find they enjoy these! They are soft and chewy, and they store well inside of a plastic container or ziploc. When they are done baking, I personally let them sit on the sheet for 1-2 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack. They do look puffed up when first coming out of the oven - the middle will settle down so it looks like a store bought cookie. And the dough does seem dry when you add the flour/coconut, but it turns out totally fine regardless. If you want crispy cookies instead of chewy, you can bake these for another 2-3 minutes until they look golden brown. I did this on accident and found some people preferred it! EDIT TO ADD: In regards to the butter, I do let it get to room temperature first. Never melt it in the microwave. I've never had an issue with these cookies coming out flat.

These were great. Only change I made was to use baking powder, rather baking soda. I also chilled the dough for a couple of hours - til I had time to bake them. Not sure if one of those things, or the combination of the 2, took care of the spreading problem. I also toasted & cooled the coconut, before adding it to the dough, and added half vanilla & half coconut extract instead of just vanilla. VERY good!

These cookies are awesome! Every time I make these, people compliment them! Can be made vegetarian by adding a little oil and omitting the egg- the texture of the cookie remains the same. I also roll the cookie dough in plastic wrap to form a tight tube, which makes them easy to cut in to rounds. They can be put in the fridge/freezer to make later which is always a plus!

Loved it just the way it was written! I did refrigerate the dough for about 10 min, and they were not flat or greasy as some reviewers noted. I toasted my coconut flakes and cooled them before adding in the dough. Simple and flavorful!

I’m at 3600 feet. Perhaps that’s why they didn’t spread.  I added another 1/4 cup butter, and pressed them before baking, and they came out better than the first sheet which tasted okay but looked puffy and not what I expected.  I a, going to look for other recipes and see what changes have been made.

These cookies are amazing. crisp edges, fluffy chewy centers. Everone loves them. I've made them several times now. Oven temp is important, if it gets to hot they turn out flat and crispy. 12 mins in the oven at 350 was perfect.

I really good, moist cookie. The favor is excellent, not too sweet. The coconut gives it  nice chew. My oven is accurate. I did have to add about two minutes to the time to get a darker cookie.  I made these twice adding butterscotch chips the second time. It was a good combination. I would think that chocolate chips would work just as well since this recipe is fairly close to the chocolate chip recipe I use.

Mine turn out round like balls but I’d prefer them flat. I use oil instead of butter because butter is too expensive where I live. Could this be the reason why?

These cookies came out amazing. I added 1/8 cup more granulated sugar, used mixed Grenadian essence instead of vanilla and baked for 15 minutes instead of 8-10 minutes for a crispier cookie and YUUUUM. My husband has had 4 so far. Great recipe.

This is nearly foolproof.  I was so tired with my baking that in making the last batch I was just dumping all the ingredients in, irregardless of order and mixing it up. The last batch was just as good as the first one that was made much more carefully. A definite keeper and a new family favorite.

Followed the changes others made. Doubled the vanilla and/or added 1/2 tsp almond extract. Added white chocolate and chopped pecans as well.

Tried variant adding 1/2 cup extra flour and 1/3 cup shortening, white chocolate chips, ad pistachios. Turned out really well, a little too oily so would decrease the butter if you're adding shortening. But the shortening made the cookies slightly less spready (in a good way). Still crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  Can sub with other nuts based on preference.

I made this because I had some extra coconut on a whim. It has been made multiple times since. I  do a lot of baking and this recipe has climbed the charts to be a favorite of many friends. It has now become a regular for Christmas also. It tastes like really good cookie dough when done...to me anyway, enjoy!

Turn out amazing and my husband couldn't stop eating it! I made some modification to the recipe to make it low carb (to suit our diet) basically replace all the sugar with stevia (0 calorie sweetener), replace flour with almond flour, replace baking soda with baking powder, and add in 1 tsp of xanthan gum. I replaces 15gram of butter with 26gram of trimmed coconut cream to get rid of the leftover cream I have in the fridge (lol) and thought it should go along with the coconut theme of these cookies anyway. I separated the egg white and yolk and I whipped the egg white to soft peak before I fold it in the batter. I also used desiccated coconut instead of flaked coconut since I have just bought a big bag of that. The cookies turned out chewy and nice and sweet with a good coconut-y texture and flavor. Yum! Now my husband told me to bake it again for our guests in the next party. Thanks a lot for the recipe!

I have made this recipe several times.  Everyone loves these cookies!  I have used both sweetened and unsweetened coconut.  It didn't make much of a difference to the flavor.  The only thing I do differently is to add a generous cup of white chips.  They really add something great!

I made these.  Followed the recipe, but I must have done something wrong.  They came out flat, uncooked, gooey (not in a good way).  I baked for 15 minutes, still not done.  Any ideas where I went wrong?  I only made one batch.  With help I might be able to save the rest of the dough.

These were really good. I used vanilla bean paste, butter-flavored shortening instead of butter, and coconut butter instead of shredded. They weren't flat or greasy, as so many others complained.

Could use a little more flavor but overall pretty good. I used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon and they baked up perfectly in 12 minutes.

This is a very easy recipe to make, and honestly you could put anything in the cookie dough to make it taste good. I made these very late at night and kept the dough in the fridge (not sure if that really did anything) and in the morning baked it. They are one of my favorite cookies to make now because they are so simple and tasty.

We enjoyed this cookie!  Most coconut cookies tend to be macaroon-type.  This turns out a nice brown sugary, coconutty, chewy cookie.  I made the recipe as stated, but did use part unsweetened, fine shredded coconut, and part sweetened, flaked coconut.  Thank you N. Hoff for a great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I added more flour to the recipe. It resulted in a crunchy not chewy cookie, which made it just okay in my opinion. I added sliced raw almonds to the 2nd batch of cookies to take away some of the sweetness, came out pretty darn good.

BIt greasy, and not a whole lot of coconut flavor.  Not a bad cookie, just wouldn’t have been able to pinpoint that it was coconut if I hadn’t baked them myself.  Left a coating of greasiness on our fingers that we had to wipe off after eating.  Not sure I’d make again as written.

Very good cookies! I read the reviews and made a few adjustments. I used the extra 1\4 cup flour, toasted the coconut, and added an extra 1\4 teaspoon coconut extract. They came out perfect! Crisp and chewy both with amazing coconut flavor. These cookies are perfect for cookie exchanges. I'm making a third batch now. These are not fussy and so easy. I would also put the dough in the fridge for an hour so there is no chance of flat cookies.

Just in the mood for coconut cookies and happened to have all of these ingredients in the kitchen so I gave it a try. Perfect cure to the carving!!! When the second batch came out of the oven I added a few mini m&m’s to a few of them for my teen, she approves too!

These are the absolute best cookies.  Easy to make, crisp on outside, chewy goodness inside.   Overall a great recipe.
  
I did take notice of previous re views and decreased the sugars, increased the vanilla and added chocolate chips.  The cookies were like a almond joy according to my friends.  I think I will add a small amount of almond extract the next time.

These had a very good taste and were nice and chewy. Unfortunately they dried up quickly even stored in an air tight container.

I've made these twice. This review is for the second time I made them because I stuck to the recipe completely (first time I made them with the recommended recipe changes)... 10 stars. No need to change anything. Buttery, coconutty perfection! My family doesn't care for coconut but tore these up lol

I've made these cookies twice. The first time I added the extra floor as per the reviews and I used stevia instead of white sugar bc that's what I had on hand. They turned out very good, very buttery. The second time I made them, I stuck to the recipe as written. The 5 star review is for the recipe as written. If it's not broken... Although, the people eating the cookies didn't notice a difference in taste (cookies with more flour were more rounded as opposed to flat- we preferred the flat), sticking with what's written is simpler, looks better... Why stray?

These are incredible!  I doubled the recipe as I could tell it wouldn't make very much.  I used unsweetened flaked coconut which I toasted in the oven for a few minutes before adding it to the dough.  I also learned from another recipe on this site that if you dissolve the baking soda in 1 or 2 tsp of hot water before adding it (and the water) to the dough, the cookies come out chewy and perfectly done.  I also use parchment paper to make cookies as it seems to make them cook more evenly and makes for easier clean-up.  This is a new favorite recipe that I will be adding to my cookie rotation!

Pretty good.  I made a few changes when I did it though. To get more coconut flavor, I used coconut oil (room temp) instead of butter. I also was out of white sugar, so I just replaced it with brown.  I also accidentally added a bit more vanilla extract. All in all, it turned out well considering the changes. Would definitely make again.

These cookies are very buttery and very good!  My husband is not a coconut fan and he still liked them. I would recommend doubling the recipe. And I think adding chocolate chips would be great too!

I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar,  and 1/2 butter, 1/2 coconut oil instead of all butter.  Then I added some Trader Joe's Coconut granola for added texture and crunch. So delicious!

These came out with amazing texture and good flavor. I made  just a few minor changes. I did 1/4 cup butter, and 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of just butter. I also doubled on vanilla extract and used 1 tsp. Instead. I also added about 3/4 cup standard sized chocolate chips. These were really good and the coconut flavor was definitely there! They were soft, chewy, the ultimate cookie consistency. I also had to bake them for about 20 min. Alot longer than the original recipe. I was worried they might be too sweet, and they definitely are sweet but in my opinion it wasn't too much to use sweetened coconut flakes. Also they came out perfectly thick and a nice shape, not flat at all!! I didn't use a scoop,  I just balld the dough up with my hands and didnt refridgerate at all. For me the extra flour and coconut were not necessary and I'm a huge coconut fan! I am definitely keeping this recipe and will make it again before too long.

At my age (76) I don't really enjoy cooking very much any longer, but I love coconut, and when I saw this recipe I just had to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  Absolutely delicious, and so quick and easy to make.  Next time I'll make a double batch so they last twice as long!

I've made this twice now and I've been asked to make it again soon.  I used a whole coconut from the store. Used the vice on my workbench to crack it open and hand shredded it.  The cookies stayed chewy even a few days later and I'm convinced the fresh coconut made the difference.

Super delicious cookies. If you dip and shake your 1 tsp measuring spoon before every molding, it gets so much faster to achieve the cute button like shapes. No need to put them 3" apart either; 1 inch was more than enough.

It would have been 5 stars but  dropping them by teaspoons instead of tablespoons is a mistake. Definitely tablespoons and 10-12 minutes.

This is my new favorite cookie. I ate 8 of them in a sitting because I couldn't stop. Very dangerous for dieters. Addicting! Closest flavor to Stella's gourmet cookie dough that I have found. awesome and easy to make. Buttery and chewy and yum yum yummy.

I did what lots of people recommended doing: I increased the flour by 1/4 c, used 1 tsp vanilla and added 1/2 c white chocolate chips. Next time, I might throw in 1/2 or 1/4 c macadamia nuts, too. These were really good and they didn't get hard after a couple of days. They stayed soft and chewy. I also made them a little bit bigger than the recipe suggested--maybe using 2 T batter per cookie. I baked them for 11 mins. Really good. I'd make them again!

Great cookies! Took 12 minutes in my oven.  Gave 4 stars based on the way recipe was written. It does not say whether to use unsalted or salted butter or that you need to have it at room temperature. I used room temperature unsalted butter. Next time I will put parchment paper on cookie sheets for easier cleanup.

I tried this recipe because I was craving cookies and I had coconut that I needed to use.  By far the best cookie recipe I have ever found.  Even better than *** House  chocolate chip cookies.   I've made them 40+ times.  About once a month I make  6 or 7 dozen for my husbands office and they are always gone in a couple of hours.   Even my friends who don't care for coconut like them!

These are my favorite cookies. I love more of a  coconut flavor so I add......1 tbs. Coconut extract  as well as the vanilla it calls for. They come out irresistible!  My whole batch disappeared in ten minutes.

Best coconut cookies! Takes no time to make, simple ingredients. I've made about 25 batches over the last year. My favourite way of doing them is putting a single piece of Lindt's salted dark chocolate strategically placed inside each cookies center. It adds a nice salty twist and makes for a perfect snack for skiing or lunch or whatever!!!

Easy and delicious. I'm a teacher and I made these for parents on teacher-parent interview day. The next day I had several kids asking me for the recipe for their parents.

These cookies where great! I was craving a Mounds candy  bar when I was baking them so I added 1/3 cup cocoa to the dry ingredients. I also rolled my cookie dough balls in extra coconut flakes before I baked them. They made a yummy chocolaty coconut treat:)!!

These are so delicious and rich and substantial. Very popular at the party I brought them to. If you like a crispier cookie, carefully add extra cooking time. I added 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract and 1/4 teaspoon almond  extract, because that's just how I roll.

After a couple of changes I really like these. Instead of butter I used 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening and a 1/4 cup coconut oil. I also increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon.

I made these cookies for the first time. I made them with gluten free flour and added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, I also used coconut extract instead. I got 3 dozens with this recipe and cooked on 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes. I love these cookies.

These are so good! I didn't have high expectations for these because I'm not really crazy about coconut, but even I could not resist these sweet gems. They are indeed chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I doubled the recipe because I tend to make larger cookies. When I doubled it, I added a little extra vanilla and coconut, then rolled the cookies into walnut-sized balls before baking them for 13 minutes. Be careful when initially removing these cookies from the pan because they are fragile before they cool. So good and worth the effort though. These are going into my regular recipe rotation!

I followed the recipe exactly. I doubled it because I love coconut and I wanted to share with my coworkers. The cookies were chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I make cookies all the time. This is by far my  favorite now!

My coworkers loved them too. The recipe has been passed around.

I thought the dough seemed too dry when I was mixing but followed the recipe anyways, (I only used brown sugar-no white, but same sugar amount) added chocolate chips and I have to say...they are AMAZING! One bite and I'm sold! Definitely going in our favorite cookie category

Made them once  (delicious)  The second time I goofed and added 2 cups of coconut instead of 1 1/3..  I had an can of 7UP in the fridge so used a bit to moisten my mix.  I'm fond of almond flavor so added a tsp. of extract.  Now they're perfect.  Almost like a Macaroon

They are chewy, but not extremely flavorful.  After baking 1/2 of the batch and having my husband taste a cookie, we decided that they need some chocolate chips to give them more flavor.  That helped ALOT!

These were delicious! If you are considering making these, I would replace the flour with 1/2 coconut flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour for a delicious creamy taste!

I was looking for a cookie different from my normal cookies, one that had coconut in it.   I found this recipe and liked the amount of good reviews.  Excellent light and coconutty cookie.   Made per recipe without changes.  Will definitely add to my cookie rotation.

Wanted to use up some of my unsweetened coconut and so looked for recipes and found these cookies. Made these as the recipe indicated, but added an extra tablespoon flour.  I baked half of them longer ( about 10-11 minutes but watched them) to make them harder and crunchier, which we sometimes prefer. To mix it up, I tried drizzling melted chocolate chips on some, dipped a few in chocolate and added finely chopped pecans. Know that this recipe will be one that I can use as a "go-to" and can vary ingredients as desired.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe for the first time & everyone went crazy over them! I added some dried cherries & a little dried orange zest. I mixed the coconut, cherries, & orange zest in with the flour & dry ingredients before adding them. (My Mom taught me to always do this so that your cherries, chips, or whatever you're adding don't sink to the bottom of the cookie).  I'm actually making another batch right now so that we'll have them for Christmas. Terrific recipe & trust me on the orange zest, it brightens up the whole cookie & is really amazing with the coconut!!

Followed recipe exactly as written. Used Bob's Red Mill Unsweetened Shredded Coconut. Results were fantastic. I sifted some powdered sugar and garnished with a bit more shredded coconut.

The cookies were ultra-soft right out of the oven, so make sure you let them cool fully before touching them, else they will fall apart.

Also, I baked all the cookies in one batch using two baking sheets, one was a KitchenAid and the other was a Wilton. The KitchenAid cookies came out with a perfectly golden brown bottom, whereas the Wilton ones were very dark, almost burnt. Depending on your baking sheet you may need to adjust time.

Definitely will make again and again.   I used all white sugar instead of any brown sugar and added nutmeg and walnuts.  Rolled into balls instead of dropping by spoonfuls.   Nice and chewy just the way I like them!  Thank you for posting!

The cookies were almost perfect - and I say almost, as they turned out just a bit too buttery for my taste.

I've added 100g of dark chocolate chips to the dough and it really lifted those cookies up, as I love the coconut-chocolate combo. I made the cookies into teaspoon sized rolled balls and just dropped them on the cookie pan and baked them for 8 minutes.

Overall a great recipe, I'll see to reduce the butter amount next time or use margarine instead. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING!!!!!! It was absolutely delicious !!!
I couldn't stop eating them !

They were so good... I will definitely make them again.
Actually, I'm making them again tonight! For my family !!!

For everybody who makes these, don't doubt this recipe. They will just melt in your mouth !!!

Once you make them, enjoy them plain, or with a very cold glass of milk.

Delicious cookies. I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and chilled the dough before baking. They did not flatten out too thin. I added some extra coconut and a tsp of coconut flavoring. I highly recommend this recipe. I'm sure the taste would be wonderful just as the recipe is written.

Fantastic. I use a GE electric stove/oven in the PNW and use a little bit bigger of a scoop than a teaspoon and bake for 11 minutes and they're great. I also use 2 3/4C (or a whole bag of shredded coconut) because I'm lazy and I love coconut. This is my go to! Thanks!

I doubled this recipe and used 1 cup of oil instead of butter. The cookies were...DELICIOUS. There are none left. My husband and friends devoured them. And I made them less than 6 hours ago. Don't know if this is relevant but I put them on the baking sheet as round balls rather than flattening them before baking. 10/10 - YUMMY

Really tasty. The dough is a bit dry, so I picked up a spoonful, but shaped it more into a ball with my fingers. Don't overcook. When golden brown but still soft, take out if you want a softer cookie. Yummy.

These cookies are  perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside! They are perfect the way they are or you can add items to change things up.  Really though this is the perfect cookie!

This recipe was pretty good in my opinon. It did not come greasy like some other reviewers had said, however I slightly modified my recipe so I had 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 tablespoon molasses to make up for not having brown sugar. The texture was perfect , the crunchiness was perfect, the only thing not impressive was the flavor. It tastes like a sugar cookie with a couple flakes of coconut, which for some might not be bad but I like more flavor in my cookies. I recommend adding more vanilla extract or coconut extract in the recipe.

These are delicious! Perfect texture and delicious flavor. I substituted 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of butter, added 1/8 teaspoon of coconut flavoring, and drizzled them with semi-sweet chocolate and they came out beautifully- like samoa girl scout cookies only more decadent

Great recipe and easy to make!  I found that I baked it closer to 13 minutes for me in my oven. I also doubled the vanilla to 1tsp as I love the taste of it. Even without the extras it is a great recipe!

These cookies are fabulous!  I added some white chocolate chips to the recipe.  It didn't change the taste much, just gave it a little pizzazz.  I used a tablespoon to drop the cookies onto air bake cookie sheets and it took about 15 minutes for the cookies to bake.  Love this recipe so  much I'm making it again today!

Based on other reviews, I increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups, increased the coconut to 1 1/2 cups, and increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  They weren't greasy, but they were a little bland.  They tasted like a textured sugar cookie.  The coconut flavor doesn't really come through.  I think you would need to add some coconut extract if you wanted a coconut tasting  cookie.   The texture is nice and soft/chewy though which I love.

I made this cookie twice.  It just wasn't as good as I'd imagined it to be.  I followed the recipe exactly when I first made it.  I have to admit that my less than exuberant review could have been affected by the fact that it was after midnight and I was exhausted when I finished baking them.  I, again, followed the recipe exactly when I made another batch this morning....except that I added chocolate chips.  Both my husband, and agree that they were better without the chocolate.  I intend to bake them again, without the chocolate chips, only because the first batch was All Gone when I awakened this morning....So there must have been something better about them than I recall.  When I do, I will post a new review.  AND if I bake at midnight, I'll hide a few to test the next morning.

So Good.  I did a little hack substituting white sugar for coconut sugar and 1cup of white flower with 1/2 a cup of coconut flour. 
I also used 1stick organic butter  and 1/4 cup of oil as the batter seemed dry (because of my hack)  I also took everyones advice and used 1tsp of vanilla extract .
 I noticed that the cookies cooked quicker -So watch the edges to make sure they don't burn- were soooooo yummy!  I make about 20 cookies and put the rest of the batter in the freezer for later!

These were delicious and I made everything to a T with the exception of subbing wheat flour for white flour.  The only difference for me going forward would be to also add more coconut otherwise these are great .

Chewy coconut in a fluffy golden cookie! Low in calories too! I replaced the butter with 1/2 an apple blended, used 1/4C more flour,  substituted the white sugar w/ honey, and toasted the coconut in a pan first. Use plenty vanilla or whatever flavor you choose, I added key lime zest... I used heaping teaspoons and got 15 big fluffy cookies, baked for 15 minutes! My husband who doesn't like sweets/ baked goods couldn't stop eating them! Thank you for this easy grandma quality recipe!

This was really delicious! My cookies didn't turn out as chewy as I expected, however, they did turn out as cookies lol. I was really surprised to see them come out as well as they did considering that this was my first shot at making any form of cookie.  Love this site and I'm going to try more recipes now that I'm a stay at home mom.

To make them crispy, I did this: the 1/2 cup sugar was split between 1/4 cup 10x & 1/4 cup granulated; the 1/2 tsp baking soda was split between 1/4 tsp cream of tartar & 1/4 baking soda; 1/2 tsp of vanilla was added to the egg and beaten; only about 3/4 cup of unsweetened coconut was added; the mix was chilled for 1/2 hr; the 1" balls were flattened a bit using a thumb or fingers and some granulated sugar was sprinkled on top; finally the baking took about 12+ minutes at 350 deg until golden brown around the edges.

These cookies are fantastic!   I read one review that said these were greasy.  I don't know how that could be.  Mine were absolutely perfect.  I did take the advice of chilling the dough before baking and cooking for 11 minutes.  If you like coconut, these cookie are great.

Very easy to make and so good to eat! I think I'll substitute Almond Extract for the Vanilla next time and maybe even add a Maraschino cherry on top for color.

Super tasty cookies! The only thing I added was a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. (Still used the vanilla as well) I make bigger cookies so I only got 20 cookies out of the batch. I did as other reviewers suggested and put my dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes because I'm sure my baking soda was a lil expired. My cookies were still a bit flat, but the flavor is great. I highly recommend the almond extract addition. Will make a double batch next time.

These cookies are perfect! Slight crunch on the outside and soft/chewy everywhere else.  Made it exactly as recipe stated and if you like coconut, these are so delicious.

Exactly what I was hoping for! Crispy on the outside chewy on the inside. I added 1/4 tsp coconut extract to make sure I could taste coconut. So happy I did and next time I will add a dash more salt because I'm crazy like that and I needed that kick. I will definitely be making these again my family love them! We are big fans so I'm so happy to find this recipe

Good quick cookie.  I followed the recipe.  To avoid the flat cookie I used cold butter and fresh baking soda.  I will make these again.

After reading the top most helpful reviews I made a couple of minor changes. I used unsweetened coconut, and toasted it in a 325 oven for about 5 minutes. This really brings out the coconut flavour. Used baking powder instead of baking soda and 1 tsp of vanilla. Cooled the dough for half an hour before rolling. Cookies are delicious and not flat at all! Will definitely make again.

Just pulled the last pan from the oven. They are delish! Crunchy on the edges but chewy in the center. I did change a few things as some suggested and also added some coconut extract. I think they're great as is but may add some chocolate drizzle next time just to try it. I made them about one inch rounded balls which made a little less than original recipe but that's fine since I'm the only true coconut lover in the house but that works out cuz Lord knows I don't need to eat them all. I will definitely make them again though.

These were amazing. (didn't want to share!) Not to over powering with the coconut but just enough.  I did add chips and roasted almond pieces to half the batch which turned out amazing as well.  I am thinking the next time I will do half with white chocolate!

A fantastic coconut cookie.   As with all my cookies, I use Butter Flavor Crisco in place of any butter or margarine. The finished product is always prettier, taller, and has a great flavor.  It's my secret ingredient.  :-)

Love this recipe , very light . Unfortunately I didnt realize that my flaked coconut had dried out so I had to hydrate it. I did so by adding just a tiny bit of water and letting it soak a few minutes. This process thinned out my batter , however, I ended up with coconut cookie wafers ! my family loved them! they are great with tea , coffee or as a garnish on ice cream...

Perfect! I refrigerated the dough 30 min, and baked around 10 minutes. I also accidentally added 1tsp vanilla. 

The thing I love most is that these cookies are the perfect texture both out of the oven and a couple days later, which doesn't happen often with cookies. Chewy, buttery, and delicious.

Reading that these tended to flatten, I used butter flavored shortening instead and added another 1/4 c of flour.  Baking them for 10 min (melon scooper sized mounds) was too little.  Another 5 min and they were more crumbly.  I did the second batch under, and it turned out chewier...basically, it's common sense:  you need to watch these.  Tasted great.  Will make again.  I like other's suggestion of adding choco or toffee chips.

I made two batches of these, the first batch I put in the freezer for 5 or so minutes as I have made biscuits before which have over spread, & my kitchen was too warm. But soon realised that they were not going to spread much at all, and turned out more like little golden rugby balls. My second batch I didn't put in fridge or freezer,  and patted them slightly around the edges to try and maintain a circular formation which seemed to do the trick as they spread nicely and kept circular.  I didn't time them exactly so not sure whether they were in for stated time exactly, I just kept an eye on them until they were golden.  Both batches tasted the same and were coconutty delish, not as chewy as I'd hoped, but my partner prefers them more crunchy anyway. Easy to make, I had some chocolate in the fridge, so drizzled a little on.

I love these! I followed the recipe but added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and up the coconut to around 1 2/3 (I just eye balled it) based on the other reviews. I had NO issue with these flattening out. The came out fat, moist and chewy. My mother's first thoughts were they tasted like a macaroon. I highly recommend this recipe and it will be one to go in the recipe book for future use. Thanks so much for sharing it!

Or till be little toasted?  Cause i waited them to get toasted and i guess i over cooked the cookies. .. they came out super dry and hard...

I do like crispy crunchy cookies so I made the following adjustments after trying the original recipe once:
I used raw oats to substitute for the coconut, increased the flour by half cup , I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder and about 1/2 tsp mixed spice (liquid) and about 1/8 tsp almond extract and added 1 pk  coconut milk powder  (50g). 
I was then able to form 1 1/2 tbs balls with dough, which I flattened on cookie sheets lined with greased paper then baked the cookies in batches for 15 - 20 minutes. My entire family raved about the taste and texture.

Made these per the recipe (which is so easy) and not disappointed!  These are moist and sooo yummy.  When husband came home from work, he gobbled them down. My only regret is not doubling the recipe!

Made it as written. They came out fabulous! Crispy on the edges, nice and chewy elsewhere. I will definitely make these again.

last time i made this i added a few table spoons of coconut milk and it was fantastic!  I love this recipe, all my friends and kids love it too.  I also used unsweetened coconut and that worked well and i guess ir was a little healthier too.

Taste great and super easy to make, I might be using a big spoon but you really do need 3 inch between if not a bit more!

I made these exactly as the recipe said & they were terrific!  It was a smaller batch - about 30 cookies.  The only way you can miss with these cookies is if you make them for someone who doesn't like coconut!

The dough came out very moist and I was worried about the cookies getting flat so I rolled them into balls and pressed down slightly to keep as much volume as I could. They turned out a bit on the flatter side, but not appetizingly so. They are definitely chewy and buttery.  Despite the fact that I made them a little bigger than suggested, I still ended up with about 2 and 1/2 dozen cookies. Next time I might add some dark chocolate chips, but these are really tasty as is!

Every time I make these cookies they disappear!  I love Almond Joy candy bars and decided to make these cookies into a mock Almond Joy in cookie form.  Pretty smart, huh?  I added chocolate chips to recipe and put 2 whole almonds on top of the cookies.  Turned out great.  One guy at my work said they tasted so creamy.  My husband doesn't even like coconut, but he likes these cookies.....This is a really good recipe.  You should give them a try.

Love this recipe! I use coconut extract instead of vanilla (we LOVE coconut in my house) and melt chocolate chips to "frost" them after they've cooled.

Delicious. Followed recipe exactly, except after it was all mixed up I put the dough in the refrigerator for about an hour, then rolled into balls before baking.

I changed the coconut to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 small bag of mini chocolate chips. Tastes a LOT like Samoas if you're a Girl Scout Cookie fan.

First cookie I've made. Came out great. Followed the directions exactly and they came out soft and chewey. Not too sweet or plain. 

I'm not a baker either so I would say great intro recipe to follow for new bakers.

They were great. I followed the recipe exactly. I may have possibly added extra coconut. I kind of just dumped the stuff in until I was satisfied. Oh, and I cooked each batch for 12 minutes. They came out lightly toasted, with just the right amount of lift, crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. Everything one could want in a coconut cookie.

read all the reviews and made the following adjustments: 1 1/5 cup flour, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 2 cups coconut & substituted baking powder for soda. 1 cup brown sugar instead of white. Added dried cranberries & pinch of cinnamon. Cookies were great. Not greasy or flat! increased cooking time- about 13-14 min..

Per other reviewers I used 1 tsp of vanilla and added a little extra flour ( 1 1/3 C). After baking for 12 min, The texture of the cookies is perfect but the coconut didn't come through as much as I had hoped. I will use coconut extract in place of the vanilla next time.

love it! We used unsweetened coconut and banana extract; kinda ran out of vanilla. But it still came out great and just the right amount of sweet. :)

Loved this! Made it for my family, who aren't big on coconuts, I on the other hand love them... But they loved them! I added a few chocolate chips into them. Definitely a easy crowd pleaser

My cookies came out way to flat and a bit raw in the center. I added about 1/2 cup of extra flour. I could really taste the baking soda. It wrecked the flavor of the whole cookie. And they really didn't have that coconut flavor. A positive note though, it is a chewy cookie. 

3 changes: 
1. Add an extra 1/2 cup of flour. 
2. No baking soda. I would use baking powder.
3. I would add a little coconut flavoring.

I made this exactly as directed and loved it! Perfect. I did beat the butter and sugar for 3 min or so, and then added egg and beat for another 2 or so. I beat the wet ingredients really good, before adding the dry. I had to cook a little more than 12 minutes. Delish. I didn't make any changes to reciepe and love them just the way they are.  I made my cookies ice cream scoop size and got 21, which is not enough for this house, so i will be doubling up next time! I might get creative and throw some chocolate chips in the microwave to lightly drizzle ontop, but they are fantastic as are. Mmmmmm. Toddler and hubby approved!

These are delicious and simple to make! I added a couple tablespoons of peanut butter and almond butter to my second batch, and that was great as well. On my third batch, I substituted wheat flour for all-purpose flour. I also decreased the total amount of flour and added some oatmeal, wheat germ, and flax seed to make the cookies healthier. Turned out well!

Just made these delicious little cookies & they turned out perfectly. I followed another suggestion and used 1/3 cup of coconut oil and used cane sugar instead of white sugar. They are perfect for me because I am obsessed with coconut.

My husband LOVES these! Recipe is perfect just as is.  They also freeze well - I make a triple batch & freeze the majority.  Next time, I will try to make these Almond joy-ish by inserting a Hershey's hugged almond just after pulling a sheet out of the oven.

I made these tonight but changed it up a bit and added the zest of a lemon and a drop of raspberry flavouring and they were So good and not too over powering just enough so you can still taste the coconut! Great for summer Lemon raspberry coconut cookies!!!!!

Definitely double the recipe. I substituted almond extract for the vanilla (and used double the amount), and added some mini chocolate chips. The double batch didn't last the weekend...awesome :)

I've made this recipe several times now and absolutely love it. The recipe doesn't clarify, however, whether the coconut should be the sweetened variety or natural. I've tried it both ways, and the natural has a stronger coconut flavor, but the sweetened has a slightly nicer texture. I recommend the natural way, but it's hard to lose with this recipe!

These are super! The only thing I really did different was I put in more flour per other reviews, and I had a heavy hand with the vanilla and coconut. My family loved them, even my picky 4 year old who usually won't even eat cookies!

My daughter and I just made these and they are ridiculously good. I added an extra tablespoon of melted butter after all ingredients were mixed and a dash more vanilla than the recipe called for. Cooked each batch for ten minutes and they were crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle!! Did each cookie about 1 teaspoon size. Sooooo good.

I loved it!  The name gives it away as a chewy cookie.  With only one egg, only butter no shortening, and splitting the sugar between brown and white, it will always result in a thinner, chewy, yet crispy cookie.  I used a cookie scoop so I had to bake mine a bit longer (about 12-13 min) but other than that this recipe is great as is.  Next time I might try adding nuts or chocolate chips for variety, but that's about it.

I've make these twice...first time they turned out very flat...my fault, I needed new baking soda.  Second time I made them, they were a little bit better but still on the flat side.  Next time I will put a bit of coconut extract in just to have more coconut flavor. I also drizzled semi-sweet chocolate over them.  All in all, this cookie is great!

This cookie recipe was amazing, I went with half butter and half coconut oil, the result was a crisp slightly chewy cookie, also added  a little more flour maybe 1/4 cup. This one is a keeper!!

I made these vegan and I doubled the recipe. I substituted half the margarine with coconut oil and I used egg replacer.  I usually don't bake so they were nice and easy for me. They turned out great and my fam was happy. I only baked them for 9min. The dough was not a "drop on the cookie sheet" consistency so I pressed them on a spoon then placed them on the cookie sheet and pressed them down a bit into a nice round.

My cookies did not turn out flat,or greasey,they were really good,even the raw dough was delicious!
I would however increase the amount of coconut.

So wonderful!  They don't have an overpowering coconut flavor, in fact, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't know they were coconut without being told.  But, they are so good!  The flatten right out when cooking, and the outsides are crispy and the middles are soft and chewy. Yummy!

Used self-rising because I had recently bought 2 bags by mistake.  They flattened out but are still OH-SO YUMMY! Had some mini-chocolate chips that I threw in the batch as well. Will be making again.  And again.  And again!!!

This is a great recipe! I had a bag of coconut flakes and was looking for a recipe to use it up and found this! These cookies are so good, everyone loved them! I agree with the other posters who said baking time is actually about 11 minutes as opposed to 8 minutes. Chewy and delicious!!

I like how easy this recipe is but I did find it lacking in coconut flavor. I do think swapping coconut extract for the vanilla would help and toasting the coconut would help as well. I will make them again and see how they taste with those changes. I did find that putting the dough in the fridge helped prevent flatness and spreading. Overall a very good recipe that my coconut loving mother enjoyed, but it does need a little 'oomph' to take it to five stars. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it as directed with one change.  I wanted to make the dough go farther so I added a cup of cereal with the coconut.  I had Tropical Blend Honey Bunches of Oats on hand so that's what I used.  The mango flavor of the cereal went great with the coconut.  Can't wait to make these again!

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it a total of 6 times for.family and friends and have not ever had a complaint. Everyone who likes coconut should try. This is even a lighter taste than most coconut cookies.

Delicious but not as coconutty as I'd like even though I increased the coconut to 1 1/2 cups. Next time I might add coconut extract. Since I used sweetened coconut I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 c and I'm glad I did--the cookies are not too sweet. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, increased the vanilla to 1 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp almond extract. The dough looked so much like chocolate chip dough that I added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips at the last minute. I don't think I needed them, though.

These cookies have good flavor, but they went totally flat, and they are too buttery.  My fingers were all greasy after picking up one cookie.  I think I might tweak the recipe a little next time.

Followed it and they turned out well. Kids really love them. I think I'll use coconut oil instead of butter next time for more coconutty flavour.

I made this recipe the other day and they turned out pretty well! The recipe is really simple and a really good way to get your coconut fix. The recipe makes a lot more than one person can eat, so I brought a large container of them to work and to some family members and they were gone within the day!

Great cookie! Loved them. Will make again. Exactly what I was looking for today. Def for the coconut lover. Moist inside crisp outside. Had no problem with recipe. I did add 1 cup toasted coconut to the 1 1/3 cup already added. This Added a little crunch and more texture. Also doubled the Vanilla.

These cookies were very good.  These cookies were very moist.  I did not have an issue with cookies being flat, however, I used a cookie scoop.  This recipe definitely a keeper.

This is my first review and I have been using this site for at least a year now.  What a wonderful cookie.  My husband who HATES coconut loved this cookie.  My son has decided this is his new favorite cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly and I had no problems.  The only thing I did differently was bake the cookie a bit longer, but that is due to my oven and cooking stone.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I used Earth Balance vegan butter and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of egg (I'm vegan). It was good, but I didn't think there was enough coconut. It tasted like sugar cookies with a bit of coconut taste. I would add more coconut next time. I would try adding another 1/2 cup of coconut and a bit less sugar next time.

Love this recipe.  Mixed double the recipe, but made a small change.  Instead of doubling the Vanilla, I did half vanilla and half brandy flavoring.  They turned out AMAZING.  Even my mother-in-law who really doesn't like sweets LOVED these cookies.  I will definitely be making them again.

This recipe is an all-star. I made it with whole wheat white flour and coconut oil instead of the butter. SO GOOD! Perfect balance of chewy and crispy.

These cookies are soooo delicious, soft and chewy!  I changed a couple things only... 1 tsp. of vanilla vs. 1/2 tsp. and 1 Cup coconut vs. 1 1/3 Cup.  Love this cookie!

Awesome :-) Needed about 12 minutes to cook though-- I took them out after 10 minutes and they were still gushy in the middle ! Otherwise, awesome recipe. Thankyou for posting it!

This was so simple and so good!  I added chocolate chips because I had them.  I can see how this would be good with some kind of nuts also.  Right amount of chewiness  This will be in my rotation for sure!

Made exactly as written or at least I think I did… I used sweetened Flaked Coconut?  I did have to bake a couple mins longer probably because I made mine to large.  But it was an excellent cookie and looked great too! In the future I will try adding coconut extract/oil and/or white choc chips.

These cookies are so yummy! After reading some of the other recommendations for more flour and flavor, I tried the following variation: Add 1/4 - 1/3 cup of hazelnut meal and coconut extract instead of vanilla. I used sweet butter and all white sugar (was out of brown) and it worked just fine. I did refrigerate dough for about an hour before baking on parchment paper for 12.5 minutes (I used cookie scooper for sizing). Be sure to spread dough out a bit as cookies do spread.

The results are amazing!

I've made these cookies a couple of times, now, and everyone has loved them.  I do add the extra quarter cup of flour, as suggested by another commenter, as well as a teaspoon or so of coconut rum.  I've also added almonds and white chocolate chips to them on separate occasions.  
My boyfriend isn't normally huge on sweets, but he has no problem eating 2 or 3 of these.

Loved this recipe, could be our new favorite.  Made it exactly as written and they came out delicious, chewy and very "coconutty".  We tried adding some walnuts and chocolate chips to the very last batch into the oven and didn't like them as well, the chocolate chips made the cookies too sweet.  I may try substituting some coconut oil for the butter in the next batch we make which will be soon!

Amazing! Made these for a little something different to add to my holiday cookie tray, and I am so glad I did. These were an absolute hit! Of everything I made (7 types of cookies) these were the first to go at 2 separate events!

Yes I tried this and added 6 oz. chocolate chips and upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. They baked 11 minutes in my oven but then I have several issues with my oven. They are really good.

I wanted to make these on the lighter side, so I cut the sugars to 1/3 a piece.  I also replaced 1/2 of the butter with unsweetened apple sauce.  Usually you cannot take the apple sauce, but you could in this cookie.  However, it tasted like a coconut/apple cookie and it was good.  Mine turned out like domes with a more dense texture.  they don't look pretty, but they taste really good.  Oh, I also added Flax seed for some fiber!

i found that if you add 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil, it adds more flavor to the delicious cookie.

Yum! I made it a wee bit healthier by using coconut oil instead of butter and unsweetened coconut. Also, half the sugars....so yummy!

My first batch did come out a little too flat (but crispy and chewy.. not sure it was a bad thing).  I added more flour (bout 1/3 cup) and the rest came out poofier. They are more cake-y now tho.. so not sure which way I like the best!  Next time, I will add extra flour more coconut and I may try real butter for more of a buttery taste.  I'm a coconut fan so I really enjoyed these! Oh, and I used a regular cookie scoop and cooked them for 13 min's.

I used 1/4 C of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead.  I also added 1 C of raisins, 1 C of cornflakes, and 1/4 C of white choc chips.  The cookies came out perfect --- not too sweet and really chewy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious...one of the two top cookies I ever made.  I added 1 tsp of coconut extract but otherwise followed the recioe exactly.  The background flavor  is reminiscent of the mall macadamia cookies. Mmmmm!

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!  Easy & so delicious!  I did let the dough "rest" about 10 minutes before rolling into 1" balls & placing on the cookie sheet. Baked for 10 mins -- they turned out awesome!  --- UPDATE --- SUPER with 1/4 tsp Almond Extract & 1/4 tsp Coconut extract rather than using the Vanilla and mini chocolate chips added in! GREAT "Almond Joy" taste!!!

I made these for a college study group and everyone loved them, even those who said they weren't normally fans of coconut. Some people even requested the recipe.  
I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I was out of all-purpose flour so I used bread flour.  It was just fine.

Cookies tasted really good, but did turn out a little flat.  I ended up choosing to refrigerate the dough and form it into small balls to bake, as I was making these for holiday treat trays and wanted them looking really nice.  I froze them and hope they won't become inedible due to their time in the freezer!  I am concerned because they are a little on the crunchy side, so I don't know if they will become even more crunchy after being stored in the freezer

I did not care for these, too much butter made it too greasy, butter flavor over powered the coconut flavor also, I will not make these again.  My daughter liked them so that is why I rated it a 2 star

GREAT COOKIES.  I made these for a friend in Fl (I live in Vt).  They arrived in great condition, little breakage.  They were gone (she and her husband) that day.
Now, Im going to make a double batch and ship them down to her. 
Last time I added coconut extract to bring the taste out more.  A little almond extract too to bring a more 'adult' taste to them.

These were so good! I've made awesome stuff from this site before but never have i given a review--these cookies were so good I had to. I added 1 1/2 of flour instead of 1 1/4 and cut the white sugar to 1/4. They turned out perfect. Not flat at all but soft and chewy  and slightly golden around the edges. I also added a small piece of white chocolate to the top and it brought them over the edge. And so easy--going in my christmas cookies this year for sure!

These cookies are great. I added extra coconut and vanilla to mine. They taste slightly salty to me, next time I'll omit the salt. Also toasting half of the coconut is a good idea. It'll increase the coconut flavor and add a little crunch. I didn't do that this time, but I plan on doing it with my next batch.

I am like another of the reviewers for this recipe in that I finally registered on All Recipes to say my piece about this cookie. Here it is... amazing, heavenly, truly blissful coconut cookie!!! I made only two modifications for my own taste: vanilla increased to 1 tsp. and toasted coconut. Wow! Thanks!

Wonderful cookie recipe.  It reminded me of the coconut cookies my grandmother used to make.  This past summer when we went home for a visit I took some to her and she said that they were just like hers except they were missing the allspice!  She asked me how many cookies the recipe made and I told her about 3 dozen and she said to add 1/4 teaspoon of allspice next time so I did.  They are perfectly like hers now.  You can't exactly taste the spice but they make you go, hmmm, what is that flavor when you eat them.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

WOW!  Delicious, perfect cookie!  Super yum!  It has a wonderful homemade flavor and they are incredibly easy and quick to whip up a batch.  I altered one part but only because I try to do this with all my baked goods, not to be creative or anything.  I substituted a quarter cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  Your children wont notice :)

LOVE these cookies!  This is always my go-to recipe when I have leftover coconut to use up.  I like to add 1/2 t. of coconut extract if I have it, but it is still very yummy without.  Plan to add some macadamia nuts the next time around!

This recipe is great!  I've made it several times and it has always been a big success.  I have two recommendations: 1) Add more coconut (at least 1/2 cup more) 2) Put chocolate pieces (white, milk and/or dark) and/or cashews on top (press into the cookies right when you take them out of the oven).  This suggestions will make these cookies even yummier!

Buttery, sugary, and just the right amount of coconut...pretty much perfection! Simple to make and basic ingredients make this a great go to cookie. I would definitely stick to the higher cooking time, I needed to bake for 11 or 12 minutes using teaspoon sized dough balls.

I made all 3 dozen.  I used a dark cookie sheet, then changed to a light cookie sheet.  I find them very greasy, coconut taste is very much in the background, they are also very flat.  When they were baking they look so good but as soon as they came out of the oven they just gave out.  I have a true convection oven and it didn't help.  Sorry I don't mean to be critical to anyone, I guess they are not for me.

Sometimes with cookies, I can fall into a serious rut (chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter, repeat!) and these were just the change that I needed to kick me out of my current one. I made the recipe as written and do agree that more coconut is needed and I might even add some coconut extract next time also. Additionally, I will try toasting my coconut as well because the only thing better than coconut is toasted coconut! Oh my, I can’t wait till the next time I make these. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really good! I'm not a big fan of coconut & thought this could be a disaster, however I made them to go along with a Hawaiian dinner I made & thought this would go good! It deff was a hit! The only problem I had was that I needed to cook them for 12 minutes rather than the 8-10 because they were far from done. But thats not a big deal at all! They were delish!!!

I tried these cookies at my friend's house and loved them.  Decided to make a batch myself using splenda instead of the white sugar.  They definitely didn't taste as good (not bad but not as good as my friend's cookies).  Will use regular old sugar from now on.  My husband also liked them even though he is not a big fan of coconut!  Finally, my cookies did not come out flat at all.  they generally kept their shape during baking.

This is a great, basic and easy recipe -- I made it slightly more healthy by using 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I also used coconut oil instead of butter and sucanant instead of white sugar.  They turned out fantastic!

Loved these cookies, 10 minutes and a couple on the pan was the time I needed to make yummy chewy cookies.  My man loves em, and I think I ate about six just as the next batch was coming out of the oven.  A keeper for sure!

FIVE STARS!!!    I've found my favorite cookie recipe - - just what I was looking for!  I happened to have coconut flavoring so I used it instead of the vanilla.  I will definately make these often and I will add other goodies to the recipe (nuts, etc.) but they are DELICIOUS just as they are - I cooked them for 12 minutes - perfect!

Chewy, coconutty deliciousness! Using the small Pampered Chef scoop, I was able to get 35 cookies from 1 batch. I did as another suggested and use 1 tsp of vanilla. The cookies spread quite a bit, so make sure to keep dough 3 inches apart. We will definitely make this again!

Very good! I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the few changes I made: I used 1 full cup of brown sugar (no white), 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of coconut extract, I increased coconut to 2 cups - I toasted 1/2 of that in the oven before adding it in. I added half a bag of white chocolate chips for added yumminess and texture. I baked on parchment paper for 8 minutes and they came out just wonderful.  I'm excited to try them today as their flavor is probably even better!

delicious!  chewy, sweet and perfect.  I used almond extract, instead of vanilla because I couldn't find it and they are very, very good, though next time I'll use vanilla- for comparison's sake.  definitely for coconut lovers.  thanks for sharing!

absolutely amazing cookies!! i like a super soft cookie so i changed the recipe a bit: use less white sugar and more brown sugar and melt the butter a bit before mixing.   do it-just bake these. they will be wonderful.

I have made these so many times (I have a batch in the oven right now, I can't believe that I haven't reveiwed them.  These always turn out great.  They definitely are chewy.  My husband and kids both claim that they don't like coconut, but love these cookies.  They are also very quick to put together - I usually only have a bowl, 1 measuring cup and a cookie sheet to wash. Sometimes I add white chocolate chips, which makes them even yummier!

Now my boyfriend's favorite cookie. I've made these 3-4 times in the past couple weeks. Only changes: 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/4 c ground flax seed, 1/2 c chopped walnuts, and I used splenda sugar blends in place of both sugars. Healthy and crazy tasty

These cookies are great. They have a buttery taste with a chewy texture that is to die for. They were a hit at my school. People that didn't even like coconut liked these cookies. I suggest leaving the recipe as is. Adding a chocolate glaze wouldn't taste right.

I made these cookies exactly as written, and after putting 12 on the baking sheet decided to add some chopped pecans. After putting 12 of those on the sheet, I decided to throw in some sesame seeds to make the last 12. They were all delicious, but I think the original recipe ones were the best! I shared half of them with a friend or I would have eaten them all! This is a great recipe. Crunchy outside, chewy inside, great flavor.

these are amazing!!  even my boyfriend, who isn't a big fan of coconut in general, thinks that these are delicious.  they are simple, quick and beautiful little gems.  i was a bit low on coconut - i only had 1 cup - so i was a bit worried that they wouldn't have a strong enough coconut flavour for my taste. i did, however, have coconut oil, so i substituted half of the butter with that.  i think it added some more coconut flavour, and the change didn't seem to negatively affect the texture.   i would recommend this substitution to anyone who wants to use a bit of healthier fat, or to amp up the coconut flavour here.  i dropped them by the teaspoon, and cooked them 9-10 minutes, as per the recipe - and  i actually got 36 cookies out of this recipe!  they turned out chewy and moist on the inside, and slightly crisp on the outside - perfect!  they rose nicely, making plump little morsels, creamy coloured with toasted edges, and lots of coconut flavour as well!  thank you so much for this recipe - i will make these many times, i am sure!

Delicious! my sister insisted she hated coconut, but not after trying these delicious cookies,  she had about three! my only suggestions are you don't have to space them out that far because they don't get that much bigger they just get thick and chewy! Also the 8-10 minutes is not enough you should cook them for at least 12 minutes. Every one will love them!

This recipe is outstanding just as is.  The cookies are nice and flat, store easily for transport to school or church as they are chewy and flexible.  I have in the past added a bit more vanilla, and tried the chocolate stripe on top.  But nothing beats just the plain cookie as the recipe calls. YUM

YUMMY!!!  I made these on a whim and I am sooooo glad I did!  Only difference, 1 2/2c flour and 1tsp of vanilla.  Other than that, followed recipe to a "t".  I'm sure that I'll find other goodies to add in and play around w/ them in the future as I know this has made it into my cookie rotation!!

I love this recipe! My boyfriend wanted to buy a coconut so we did and last night it was fun to watch him open it. Well I didn't know what to do with all of it, since I doubt he'd eat it. So I made these...  Well, Note to self: get coconut Flakes instead of an actually coconut.. I grated the cracked coconut for a half an hour and then I had my boyfriend help me and his friend also help me.. End result, not really enough coconut.. but none the less it's still really good.  I think I'll take the base recipe and maybe put chocolate chips or something else instead of coconut. =)    Thank you so much for this one!!

I LOVED these cookies! The only substitution I made was to use margarine because I didn't have enough butter on hand. They were definitely chewy (which is my favourite cookie texture). Thank you for a simple, tasty recipe!

These turned out wonderful!  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and upped the vanilla to 1 tsp.  They turned out perfect!  Some people complained about them being flat, but mine flatted some after being removed from the oven, but not enough that i would consider them "flat".  I used a cookie scoop to portion them out on the pan and this recipe made 23 cookies in that size.  The coconut flavor showed up better today (1 day after making them).  I am already looking forward to making these again... so much for any weight loss goals... I have already eaten half the batch!  :)

OMG these cookies are fabulous!  I'm not a huge sweet eater, but these were addictive.  I think they might have even been BETTER the next day, which never happens with cookies!  I followed the recipe as stated except that I used someone else's suggestion to add white chocolate chips.  I think those made the recipe.  Awesome recipe, I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

I thought these cookies were ok.  They need more of a coconut flavor.  I added a full teaspoon of vanilla, other than that I followed the recipe.  They don't taste like coconut.  They taste almost like a sugar cookie.  They don't tast bad, it's just I love the taste of coconut and these don't have a coconut flavor.  Maybe I will add some coconut extract as others suggested.

Add chocolate chips... you won't regret it!  I added large milk chocolate chips.  Yum! One reviewer said you didn't need to put the dough in the fridge, but I did it both ways and the cooler dough made much prettier cookies that weren't as flat.  I also made them bigger so I ended up with less cookies than 36.  They are AMAZING!!  Great alternative on chocolate chip cookies!

Make sure the butter is completely softened before starting...I had a few chunks that led to a few disaster cookies.  Otherwise very chewy and yummy!

Awesome.  I added the cup of chocolate chips which was perfect.  I used a cookie scoop, which I believe is one tablespoon instead of one teaspoon so it took 12 minutes for cook time.  But will definitely make these again.  So yummy and chewy.

PERFECT!!! I also added 1/4 cup more flour and I added some chocolate chunks to mine and they turned out wonderfully! The perfect cookie - not too flat or too puffed up. They looked just like the Toll House cookie picture!

I don't get all the good reviews here.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I added 1/2 tsp coconut extract.  These are not bad, but they are not worth 5 stars.  They are just okay.  They tasted a little on the salty side to me too.   Anyway, I doubt that I will make them again.

I think this is one delicious cookie! I didnt' get all fancy with changing things. The only thing I had to do was add a bit more flour b/c my first batch was a little flat! Loved these and simple to make. It's nice b/c usually the only cookie I ever made w/ coconut was a macaroon and I liked this one even more!

These were great fresh out of the oven, but with about 3 dozen cookies, you can't eat them all right away.  By the next day, they had hardened to little rocks: impossible to bite into.  After they cooled there also seemed to be something "off" about the flavor, but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.

Great cookie - simple & foolproof.  I added ~ 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips and it added a nice touch of chocolate without overpowering the coconut.  Next time I will try something with a salty touch for a sweet/salty cookie.

My family LOVED them. They are Reallly good. The only thing I had a problem with was the butter. Make sure the butter is at room temperature, it makes it easier to mix. Mine was cold and I had a hard time making it smooth.

It's your standard cookie dough recipe with coconut added, but they are wonderful!  Especially hot out of the oven.  I made the following changes:  extra 1/4 cup flour, extra 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Also, just before baking, I pressed some coconut flakes onto the top of the cookies for decoration.  It makes it more obvious that they are coconut cookies.

Was out of brown sugar so I substituted the 1/2 C brown sugar with 1/2 cup white sugar + 2 Tablespoons molasses. (Still added the 1/2 C white sugar as called for in recipe.) To use up my coconut, I ended up putting about 1 1/2 C in. Also used 1 full tsp vanilla extract. Used melon baller to make small cookies, chilled for 10 minutes, then Baked 11 min, left on sheet 2 minutes. Quick, easy, and delicious!! =)

They truly stay chewy, and my family enjoys them.  Nice alternative to sugar cookies, esp if you have leftover coconut from another recipe.

Very good!  So tasty and easy to make, although I had to leave mine in the oven a couple of minutes longer.

We really enjoyed these, they are very quick and easy to make. I made half the batch regular and the other half with dark chocolate chips. The chocolate compliments the cookies wonderfully.  We would like to have more coconut in ours so I recommend using a  larger amount.

These are super easy and delicious.  The coconut flavor is there but more subtle than you may think with the amount it calls for.  I think the main job of the coconut is to add that wonderful, chewy texture.  One batch for me made about 50 cookies, but I made them small.  I rolled them in teaspoon size balls and didn't flatten them as they flatten while cooking.   When they were cooled I dipped half of the cookie in melted white chocolate, Yumm!  I think it might also be good dipped in dark melted chocolate.

This is a great recipe. I had this make in China, Chinese people doesn't really like to eat a lot of sweet food even that my mum ate 3 in a roll. That's pretty surprised. I used half cane sugar and half brown sugar for it, it turned out the sweetness is just right. Thank you!

Yum! I got 36 cute little chewy cookies and followed the recipe closely (except for adding a cup of butterscotch chips). My boyfriend isn't a big coconut fan, but he definitely put lots of these little guys away. Very good cookie.

My husband and I enjoyed these cookies very much.  He isn't a fan of macaroons but he loved these!  I agree with a fellow reviewer that an 11-13 minute baking time is best.

These are very tasty cookies and have a nice light flavor and texture that is nice. I added just a touch more coconut about 1/4 cup..just a personal preference. They are moist and delicious!

These cookies were absolutely delicious.   My Family really liked them.The only    changes I made was to add about 2   1/2 Tbsp of Coconut Coffee Creamer.  The Coconut Creamer really added a  good flavor to the cookies.I will  surely be making these cookies again  very soon.

This recipe is yummy! I didn't have any brown sugar so I used regular sugar and added molasses to it. I also added pecans. Don't be surprised if you have to cook a little longer than the recipe suggests. Truly tastes like it came from a bakery! My husband has almost eaten half of them and I doubled the recipe!!

Seriously, these are some of the best cookies I have ever had - the perfect balance between sweetness and buttery flavor, crispy edges and chewy centers. They are also ridiculously easy to make.  They look beautiful and are perfectly round with minimal effort.  I brought them to a party and they were a huge hit.  Will make these again and again!

I love the combination of chocolate and coconut...but these don't need the chocolate at all! Make these as is and you won't be disappointed. The longer you cook them the crispier they are. As soon as they start to lose their "wet" look, I pull them out and they are great!

This cookie is good. It has a wonderful texture and crumb after baking 11 minutes and cooling completely. It's just the right crunchy/chewy mix. The flavor is somewhat bland for our tastes however. I'm wondering if some spices/cinnamon would do the trick? Maybe even a tad more salt? The reviewer who suggested coconut flavoring may have a good idea also. Overall, a good cookie =)

I added a cup of chopped nuts but otherwise followed the recipe. It took about 15 minutes in my oven.  Good Cookies. Will try without the nuts next time.

made it as is without any changes and it was really great. Chewy and crisp after about 11 minutes in my oven. I doubled the batch and added white choc chips to half but both w/ and w/o are moist and just plain good.

This is a good recipe.  It wasn't overly coconutty which meant my husband liked them too.  I think the cookies tasted better after a day or two.  We froze half the batch but ended up taking them out and eating them within a week...

Maybe I was too swayed by all the ecstatic reviews. My batch was a bit on the flat side, too (cold butter and new baking soda).  They were good but not the greatest cookie I've ever had.  More of a buttery flavor.  Did seem to enjoy them more as the days passed--either they grew on me or improve with age, not sure which.  Will try again but go with coconut extract.

Delicious, chewy, buttery cookies.  Definitely decadent, as I can tell by the greasiness on my fingers after eating one. Not too difficult to make.  I was able to get 27 small cookies - you'd have to make mini ones to get 36 like the recipe says.

I had a coconut candle burning and it made me hungry for something coconut- had all the ingredients so I tried this and they are wonderful! While they are thin, I did not find them exceptionally so- and even several days later they were still soft and chewy! Left them in about 12 minutes- at 11 min they were still hard to take off the pan, the extra min or so really helped. Love this recipe- very easy.

Very good cookies! I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and they turned out great. If you use sweetened coconut flakes use less sugar.

Very good cookies! Chewy and not to sweet like i thought they'd come out. Didn't have brown sugar so i substituted by mixing 1/2 cup of white sugar with 1 tablespoon of dark brown corn syrup. They turned out great!

I don't normally like thin cookies, but the flavor of these is delicious, and I really enjoyed them. They came out a bit crispy on the edges and chewy in the centers. They were a nice change from the "puffier" cookies I normally make.

Oh man these are good!    I only had sweetened coconut on hand, so I cut down on the sugars by half cup and that worked out well.  I also used half butter/half shortening and doubled the vanilla.  Everyone loved these- they are my new favorite cookie.  Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe!

This is a coconut masterpiece! This cookie is so chewy and moist, the flavor is very sophisticated. I followed the directions exactly except I doubled the vanilla extract. 10 mins wasn't enough as the bottoms were still too moist, so I put it in for another 2 mins - the end result was crispy edges and a chewy center. I didn't have a cookie scoop so I just made tablespoon sized balls which I slightly flattened on the cookie sheet. The cookies did spread out to nice rounds when baked.

This cookie is so well received by everyone that loves coconut. I bake these about once a month for our church and there is always an empty platter to take home. I tried adding extra flour and didn't care for them as well. If I have dried pineapple available I chop up and add about 1/2 cup (YUMMY). Thank you for the great and easy recipe.

OMG!They were super chewy and yummy!They are like coconut snickerdoodles.  I added 1/2tsp rum extract, 1/2cup dried pineapple, 1/4cup butterscotch chips and 1/4 white chocolatechips. Pina Colada cookies. And I ate with coconut cream pie ice cream on them. Heavenly delicious!   My husband and I were never a big fan of coconut texture, but once he took a bite he said "OMG!AMAZING! You should keep this in our home recipe book!" And my toddler liked them too.  I think I'll try this again with a little bit of lemon zest.

Very good and chewy just like it says. The written recipe doesn't make very many cookies, so I've since doubled the recipe, but when doubling, make sure not to double the amount of sugar - it was way too sweet. I used 1 cup brown, 3/4 cup white and it was perfect, especially since the coconut adds a lot of sweetness.  These also freeze wonderfully and stays chewy after being frozen.  Doubling makes around 45 cookies.

I've made these several times and everyone loves them. They're like a sugar cookie with a little more going on ;) The coconut doesn't bring out too much flavor, so I suppose coconut extract would help although I'm fine without it.

These cookies are so good! They almost taste like oatmeal for some reason. They're really chewy and coconutty, and you can't eat just one. I sent some in to work with my husband, and his coworkers devoured them. I'll definitely be making these again!

Awesome cookies! (if you love coconut)  The only thing I changed was adding a little bit more vanilla extract, and adding a splash of coconut extract.  These were yummy cookies, I will definately make them again!  Thanks for the great recipe.  :D *****Update:  made these today; pressed my thumb in the middle of them and put raspberry jam in it before baking!  Kind of gooey on the bottom of the cookies, but sooooooooooo good!!  Try it, just don't put too much jam or it doesn't bake that well.*****

Great Recipe!  Easy to make and was/is a hit at work.  I added a little more coconut and vanilla extract than the recipe called for, but that is just my preference.

These rock!!! I am usually a chocolate person, but I can't get enough of these. The last time that I made them, I turned them into ice-cream sandwiches to take to a potluck at work. Vanilla ice cream in the middle, and I rolled the edges in toasted coconut. They were easy to make and tasted fantastic. I love this recipe.

Excellent chewy cookie!  I doubled the recipe as it only makes a dozen as is.  Doubling the recipe gave me 27 medium-sized cookies and I also added one cup of chopped pecans.  Highly recommend this one!

These cookies are awesome, they are rich, buttery and sweet yet not too sweet, i made them exactly as written and they turned out perfectly, the dough was not crumbly at all but nice and moist, i will totally make these a staple cookie to make all the time, cant wait to eat another one.

These are dangerously good.  I tried another reviewer's suggestion to add white chips and that was good too, but I think I liked them better without.

This cookie was so easy to make...The only change I made was increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  I like my cookies chewy so i only baked for 10 minutes, right until they start to brown.  I recommend making a double batch, this only made 30 cookies for me.  Also if you shape in a ball they will come out round

What a fantastic recipe, just the right balance of chewy and crisp. I drizzled some of the cookies with milk chocolate and they were delightful. Next time I might try adding some chopped macadamia nuts and perhaps white chocolate. Even with just the plain coconut cookies they are to die for.

Had to bake 2 batches of these this past Christmas.  I'm not a big coconut fan and I found these to be scrumptious.  Everyone loved them.  I expected them to flatten out, but they stayed pretty plump in shape, probably because I chilled the batter a bit before dropping onto cookie sheet.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly & they were wonderful!!!  Light & crispy on the outside & chewy on the inside.  I added some milk chocolate chips to the last batch & those are just as good!!  I will definitely make these again & again!

Nice chewy little treat but needed just a bit more coconut flavour.    Next time I would add 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of coconut extract and maybe drizzle in milk chocolate.

I didn't bake them-I ate them!  These cookies are the number 2 cookies my wife has ever made-second only to her chocolate chip cookies.  If you want a cookie that your family will devour within a day-try these!!  We had them with white chips and some with regular chips-both delicious in their own way.  The Mrs. wants to add coconut extract for more coconut flavor.  These are not for a family that is interested in staying slim.

These cookies are soooo yummy!  I just baked a batch & tested one out of the oven & it melts in your mouth!  I made a couple of simple changes based on other reviews.  I used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp., & I baked them for 11 minutes.  My butter also ended up almost completely melted (I microwaved it for a minute cuz it was frozen), but it turned out fine.  I thought that the small amount of dough used (I eyeballed it to something like 1 & 1/2 tsp) would turn out really small cookies, but they turned out just the perfect size, not too big nor too small.  Will definitely add these to my cookie recipes! :)

Yummy chewy cookies, but a little too swewet for my taste. I would probably omit the white sugar next time.  Also,the cookies spread out pretty big- will use about 1/2 tsp drops next time for smaller cookies.

Unbelievably good!  I roll the dough into  1" balls and they come out perfect at 8 minutes.  They look underdone, but let them sit on the pan for a few minutes before removing them to racks.  Chewy and fabulous!

An AWESOME chewy coconut cookie! I pulse my coconut in the food processor for a few seconds first. I doubled the vanilla to 1 tsp, and sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the cookie before baking. My big cookie scoop only gave me 20 cookies. Baked at 13 min. total. PERFECT! also *Self rising flour works great/ omit the salt & baking soda*

We had a whole fresh coconut to use so we grated it up and made these cookies.  Wow, what a great recipe!  The cookies were chewy, sweet and perfect with a glass of milk.  Next time I think I will try them with some orange zest or chocolate chips added!

These are good.  I'm more of a chocolate person but my husband really likes them.  I think that adding chocolate chips would make this cookie perfect!  I'll try that next time.

these cookies turned out great! this is definately a no brainer recipe with perfect results everytime..i had to triple the recipe and nothing went wrong! the truley are a grreat chewy cookie. My onnly suggestion would be to make sure you use really good quality coconut flakes. as organic as possible. I unfortunately did not and they tasted a little more "processed' than i would prefer but nonetheless still delicious :)

I don't like coconut, but these are really delicious. I did make the change of using 1 tsp of vanilla as recommended in reviews. Next time I might add some white chocolate chips and some slivered almonds... yum!

I cannot believe how quickly these cookies disappear! The flavor is so dainty and fresh - they are wonderful! After making them a few times I agree with previous reviews that an extra 1/4 cup of flour makes them nice and round. I haven't had any need to refrigerate them. These are wonderful, quick, easy and they smell as wonderful as they taste!

AMAZING! When I made these cookies everyone raved, I ate so many of them (probably shouldn't have) and they were just plain good. I did however make a few changes. I used 1 1/4 cup of coconut instead of 1 1/3cup. Also, I used 2/3cup of white chocolate chips and it came out so delicious. thanx for posting!

Loved these cookies, although I used 1tsp of vanilla and 1tsp coconut extract along with 1/2c chopped white chocolate. I also toasted the coconut flakes in a preheated oven for about 15 minutes. :) Very good

I really love these... I use unsweetened coconut and found it to still be plenty sweet and delicious. I tried large flake coconut once but much prefer the macaroon style, small flaked coconut. This has been a tried and true for me for sometime, always turns out great.

I made these for my family, and they were gone in a day. I used sweetened coconut. I used approximately 1 less tablespoon of sugar than the recipe called for because some of the reviews were saying it was too sweet. It was perfect. I scooped them with a cookie scoop about the size of a tablespoon and baked for 13-15 min.

These cookies are so AMAZING. Everyone I know loves them! I always add a lot of coconut and chocolate or white chocolate chips to the dough. These are easy to make and are always a perfect gift around the holidays, or just because.

Delicious cookies that got great reviews when fresh out of the oven. However, I suggest storing them in an airtight container as soon as they have cooled. I left them out overnight and the next morning they were equally delicious Crunchy Coconut Cookies.

I do not know if I will ever make them again, I had alot of extra coconut left over and needed a recipe with ingrediants I had at home. My two year old son helped me make them. They are very flat, but also very moist. I used 1 tsp vanilla extract. My son loved them very much.

i really liked this cookie, my husband said its his new favorite!  i followed the recipe exactly and i like the taste although i think i will play around with the cooking time a little bit. at 10 minutes they seemed a little too cakey.  this cookie will definitely go into heavy rotation!

Cookies are good! Very simple to make! I would leave them in a little longer than 10 minutes. If you use a teaspoon to measure like I did, you should get 3 dozen small cookies. This one is a keeper!

Chewy, tasty cookies -- all I changed was toasting most of the coconut and drizzling melted dark chocolate on top of the cookeis after they cooled.  Recommended!

Great recipe! Used just 1/4 c white sugar to reduce the sweetness for my taste. Without the coconut, this makes a great base recipe for chocolate chip cookies, etc!

These were great after making the vanilla 1 tsp. My family loved the tenderness. They do firm while cooling so once I realized that it helped. Enjoy!!

I'd say these are a 4 star cookie, but my boyfriend ate 2 in a row... which is really saying something since he's not a big sweets person. So 5 stars it is. My only complaint is that mine came out so flat. I tried chilling the dough and that didn't help. So I'm left with some very tasty, very flat cookies. :)

was really excited to make these because i love coconut cookies, but was disappointed with the end product. maybe it was because i used sweetened coconut flakes (that's all the store had) instead of unsweetened?

they were a bit too sweet yet bland. i tried adding chocolate chips to half the batch, which helped, but still not great.

overall not great and my boyfriend (who also loves coconut) was also underwhelmed.

Good taste, followed the recipe directly but ended up with coconut pancakes.  Will try again but readers BE SURE to chill first, perhaps I beat it too long?  Was it too moist in the house?  Who knows but I will certainly try chilling for longer and will review again - shame because they taste GOOD!

OMG. I love this recipe!!! I think the next time I may add some nuts or white chocolate chips just to change it up but they came ot great. I used dark brown sugar instead of the light brown sugar... that gave them a slightly different taste. I'm def gonna add this to my list of cookies I will make every year around xmas time.

This has become my 'go-to' cookie recipe - quick, easy and delicious.  I've been making them for a couple of years now and usually add chopped white chocolate and toasted almonds.  I tried drizzling melted chocolate over the cookies after baking but they didn't need it.  In fact, the recipe exactly as written is amazing.

THESE ARE GREAT COOKIES!  THEY ARE EASY TO MAKE AND TURN OUT AWESOME!  I DID ADD 1/2 C OF CHOPPED PECANS AND TOOK THE ADVICE OF OTHERS AND CHILLED THE DOUGH FOR 1 HR PRIOR TO ROLLING IN SMALL BALLS AND BAKING.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE COOKIES IF YOU LIKE COCONUT!

I used a Tablespoon measure to drop the cookies and only got 2 dozen.  I had to bake mine the full 10 minutes, maybe even slightly longer.  I added chocolate chips to the second dozen and it was great!  I think next time I will add some coconut extract as other reviewers have mentioned to really bring out the flavor.  Will be making these again!

if you are giving this recipe bad reviews then you must share your good recipes! these cookies were really good! crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. however, my advice is to definitely chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking. i'm going to make them again next week and add walnuts and golden raisins. it gets 5 stars because it proves that a good cookie can be simple and easy!

Very good-the only thing I would recommend is to double the recipe-I used a cookie scoop and only got about 24 big cookies out of it..which would be fine just for me :)

They turned out great!  I divided the batch up and added chocolate chips to one half.  I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top of the cookies.  YUMMY!  And super easy to make.

Fantastic! I even burned the "toasted" coconut (dried) and it was still delish. I did make some changes though: ghee for butter b/c I had none on hand and 1 tsp. coconut extract and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. I also refrigerated for 15 minutes. The only problem is I didn't make enough. Great suggestions guys!! :D

This recipe was ok.  I love coconut but these cookies were very sweet.  The base ingredients in this cookie are similar to a chewy chocolate chip cookie on this site and it is outstanding.  I will not make these cookies again.

The batch comes out just like the name! I kept some plain, added chopped almonds to a few and dipped some in milk chocolate and others in white chocolate as other reviewers did. Those were the ones that went the quickest. The batch did come out flat, but I'll try refrigerating the dough, per a reviewer's suggestion, next time.

I give the taste 5 stars, these taste amazing.  I was so worried they wouldn't turned out,  they don't look anything like the picture thats for sure.  When I started slowly adding the flour to the mixture after just about half it got really dry and I  had to try and work the rest in w/ a spoon instead of the mixer.  I added more butter but that didn't work either.  I wished I could've dropped them on to the cookie dish like the recipe says but I had to use my hands and shape them and FORCE them to stay together it was really crumbly.  But even after all that they still turned out wonderful.  :-)  It was a lot of trouble so I don't think i'll make again.

I doubled the batch, toasted the coconut and added white chocolate chips.
I'm now working on my second batch in a week.

These were fine but were definitely lacking something.  Next time I'd try adding coconut extract and/or white chocolate chips.

Sooo good, these came out perfect, crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I also dipped in melted semi-sweet chocolate as another reviewer did and they were amazing. Next time I think I will drizzle the chocolate on top to make them look pretty.  A great cookie to make when want to make something besides just chocolate chip :)

I used 1/3 cup of canola oil in place of butter like another review suggested.  Then, I added two cut-up twix bars (hand mixed) into the dough before baking.  Delicious!  My family loved the combination of the carmel, chocolate and coconut.  Be careful not to cook these cookies too long or they harden up, though.  For my oven 10 minutes was perfect.  I will Definitely make these again.  Maybe next time I'll try white chocolate.  YUM!!

I didn't have any goodies in the pantry for dessert. Nor was I in the mood to spend hours baking. But luckily I found this recipe. The cookies turned out AMAZING... I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of Almond extract and the only nuts I had were pecans. But I threw those in as well. It worked out perfectly and you saved my dinner party... so thanks a ton!

Awesome. Definitely as described. I made half the recipe. I added 1/4 teaspoon alomond extract to enhance that fragrant coconut flavour, as well as 1/3 cup of chopped macadamias. Plus I used 1T milk just b/c the dough was getting too hard to work with. Smelled nice, tasted nice, with light flavour. Dad's words 'I guess I won't have to buy coconut macaroons anymore' after trying one.

These are the BEST.  They are chewy, buttery, and crunchy. Everything you could want in a cookie.  My husband doesn't even like coconut and he really liked these.

Sorry repeated my last review but I just made these again today and added in some chocolate Heath chips this time to recipe. Yum Yum!  Made just as is or with some additions this recipe is fabulous!  Also I did double the recipe this time and worked out great!

Extremely yummy, but kind of flat.  If I can get them to hold up while baking a bit better, they'll be perfect!

perfect!  I think if you omit the coconut and add white chocolate chips and macadamia nut cookies, this dough would taste just like Subway's white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.

These little cookies are just fantastic!! Chewy with a little crunch around the edge. I make them for a cookie exchange and I always have to make 3X as many of these little goodies.

After reading all the great reviews, I had to try this. They are awesome! I cooked one batch as directed -- fabulous. I cooked another and added walnuts, golden raisins, extra coconut, and Malibu rum. Increased cook time to 12 minutes. Amazing! It's a keeper!!

I was going to make these for a Christmas party, but after reading some of the reviews I was a little scared they wouldn't turn out that great. I definitely should have made them. I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies came out perfectly. Some reviews said that the recipe doesn't make 3 dozen, but I was able to make 3 dozen. These cookies are awesome. I took them to a friends for dinner and they were gone in seconds!

These cookies are very chewy and have a nice flavor.  But they aren't anything spectacular.  I would make them again, just not for a holiday cookie or special occasion.

These cookies are awesome. I added an extra tablespoon or two of flour to the recipe and the cookies came out perfect. White chocolate chips and chopped macadamia nuts would be a great addition!

Followed the recipe for the most part; added the suggested 1 Tbsp. extra flour (due to flat cookies) but instead mine came out of the oven just like I put them in -- little half-spheres.  Oh, well.  I dyed them pink for an all-girl dinner party and called them Sno-Ball cookies (like those snack cakes).  Pretty good overall... recipe needs a little tweaking somewhere though...

They're very yummy, but they flatened out once they were cooled.  I even chilled them for a long time first, just like I do with regular drop cookies.  Maybe I did it wrong?  I also added choco-chips to make them even better!

I enjoyed making these cookies.  I was surprised that it didn't make a whole lot.  I will make these cookies again, but they weren't "over the top" but comforting. Thanks for the recipe.

Scrumptious...its like a cross between a macaroon and a snickerdoodle. I agree with another reviewer in that the cookie's base is fantastic. It could lend easily to experimentation such as snickerdoodle or chocolate chip. For this recipe itself, I would not change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.

EXCELLENT!  I added a cup of pecan pieces for some extra flavor, but I love the coconut chewiness of these cookies.  A keeper, for sure.

These are VERY good! (I also added chocolate chips) Definitly double the recipe b/c they will go fast. I only got about 2 dozen out of one batch. And will need a little longer han 10 min to cook, as other reviewers said.

I only had shredded coconut- but it worked well and gave it that yummy coconuty texture. Half the batch I dipped in melted chocolate and they were fabulous too. Next time I will try adding cocoa to the mix and see how that turns out- these are great cookies and really lend themselves well to experimenting.

This is a fabulous recipe; I'm pasting it into my cookbook to save.  :)  I suggest greasing the cookie sheets, 15 minutes baking time worked best for me, and 1/3 cup baking cocoa and/or some chocolate chips make these even better.  :)

MY husband loved these cookies.  I added a 1/2tsp of coconut extract because I really like to enhance the flavor.  This cookie would also be good with crushed macadaians and white choco chips.  Easy and most of the ingredients are always on hand.

this is terrific! strong coconut flavour.. i made a little variation though. i used 2/3 of the total sugar required. perfect sweetness. might wanna cut down on the amt of butter. it's a teeny bit too buttery for a coconut cookie.

OH WOW. where do I start. These look like goumet cookies right out of the oven. They have the height of cookies made with crisco instead of butter. I added 1 full cup of semi sweet chocolate pieces. I will definately make these cookies again! WOW.

This recipe is soooo good!  Especially with some chocolate chips (1/2 cup).  But I'd say it deserves more chocolate chips.  I'm going to make this again!  Love 'em and can't stop eating 'em!

Smells nice, tastes even better! =) Used one cup of white sugar since I don't have any brown sugar. Think because of this, the taste wasn't as strong as it should be. =) Yields around 45 medium sized cookies for me. Great for leisure baking.

12/23/04-these were fine.  Nothing amazing for a coconut lover, but tasty enough for a non-coconut lover!  Turned out more crispy and thin than chewy in my opinion.

These cookies were good, flavor wise, but just not great enough to recieve a 4 or 5 star review. I have no clue why there is all that hype! Also, they flattened out too much! I may use them as a base recipe again, but NEVER as just a plain recipe. Thanks anyways!

These cookies are absolutely FABULOUS!!!! I loved these. They are extremely easy to make, believe me, I'm a beginner cook.  You just can't go wrong with these.  I had to bake mine about 12 minutes but that could just be due to variations in ovens. The only change I might make is to reduce the sugar just a tiny bit, they were a little sweet. I can't wait to make these again (and to maybe add some white chocolate chips) YUMMY!!!!!

Delicious, really easy and scrumptious cookies. I use unsalted butter when making cookies, maybe that is why people complain about the saltiness, maybe they use regular butter or even worse, margarine!!! A real treat for my hubby and I :)

Excellent!! These are excellent cookies, chewy and delicious. The only thing I added (as per another review) was 1/2 cup of toffee chips. Will be making thes many more times!! Thanks for this delicious recipe!!

I was hoping these were more along the lines of macaroons, but I guess I should have gone for a different recipe.  These were good, though! A simple, chewey cookie with lots of coconut flavor.

These are wonderful!  I brought about four dozen to a meeting, and they were gone before I knew it (pretty good, considering there were only about 12 people at the meeting!)  I love chewy cookies, and I love coconut.  What could be better?

Made these for Easter....very good!  Soft and chewy.  I added chocolate chips to half the batter.  Mine actually needed to bake about 12min.

wonderful recipe! I wouldn't change a thing.  They turned out chewy, yet slightly crisp.  What a wonderful texture.

Thees cookies are delicious ... and are made even better by either sticking a few chocolate chips on before baking or drizzling melted chocolate on afterwards. They never last long in our house!

My sweet 80-year old aunt wanted a coconut cookie recipe for one of her ailing friends.  I pulled up a bunch here.  By far, this is the easiest and tastiest!  We both found a new coconut cookie standard.  Neither of us would change a thing in the recipe; it's perfect as is!

Delicious cookies.  I added 1 cup of a combination of mini chocolate morsels and mini M&M's.  They were a great addition and they gave the cookies a festive touch.  Easy recipe. If you like coconut, You have to try these

Easy and very yummy. Once you try these out, you'll always keep coconut on hand! I didn't have any brown sugar, so I just used white, and they turned out fine. They flatten fairly thin once cooled and are nice and chewy.

These are wonderful!  My fiance loved them and said, "Boy these cookies are chewy!"  My 5 year old who doesn't really care for coconut told me I'd better make these again!  I made the first dozen as written, but had a craving for chocolate so threw in about 1 cup of milk chocolate chips with the rest of the cookie dough.  Pure heaven.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I added vanilla chips and chopped walnuts to the recipe (just had some that needed to be used up) and the cookies turned out wonderful!  My picky little eaters even liked them!

These tasted like basic cookie batter (think choc chip before adding the chips) with coconut stirred into the batter.  For a true coconut taste I would reccomend coconut macaroons.  I made these to take to a meeting and most people enjoyed them.  I probably will not make them again.
