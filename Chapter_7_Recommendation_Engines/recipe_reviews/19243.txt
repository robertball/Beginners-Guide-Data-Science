These were awesome!  A little bit of everything in them and they taste great.  I didn't have cream, but just used a bit more milk, and I think they're just fine like this.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I just used more milk instead of cream. My family LOVES them. These cookies are marvelous!

These are absolutely  delicious!  I made them for my husband to take to work today and all his coworkers loved them!  Since we're both lactose intolerant, I substituted Crisco for butter, soymilk for the milk and cream, and used non-dairy chocolate chips.

I made these for my freshman Geography class on 9/23/09 they went over well, so it's a decent recipe. It's easy, quick and tasty.  (I just used more milk instead of cream)

The flavor was good but they turned out flat.  I'm at sea level so altitude isn't the issue.  
I enjoy the combination of flavors so I'll try this again.
