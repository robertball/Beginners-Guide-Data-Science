These tasted GREAT and everyone loved them!  The only thing i have to say - BE CAREFUL!  The oil overflowed into the oven, so we pulled them out a few min early, which was fine for the yorkies, but the next time i turned on the oven, the entire inside went up in flames....  So I definitely would like to recommend this recipe, just maybe use a little less oil....

This was a great recipe! I followed the other reviews and only used 1/2tbsp of oil in each cup. The oil didn't overflow this way. It was very yummy!

This was great! I used leftover pot roast and it worked wonderfully. It did take significantly longer than 12 minutes to brown, though, and I agree with the other reviewer about using a little less oil. Aside from that, four thumbs up -- my husband and I both enjoyed our meal.

I made this with about 2 cups of thinly sliced left over roast beef. I added about 4 teaspoons of horseradish to the beef and tossed it all together to lightly coat the roast beef. I also had some left over onion gravy from Sunday dinner that I used on top of the cooked Yorkies. I used my own Yorkshire pudding recipe (1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup flour, pinch of salt and 2 large eggs), which fills exactly one 12-hole muffin tin to my desired amount. I put the batter in the fridge for about 20 mins. I did not use oil - instead I lightly greased the whole tin with lard (using wax paper). I preheated the oven to 450 F and stuck the muffin tin in there for about 10 minutes. Right out of the oven, I evenly distrubted all of my batter in the 12 holes of the tin, then evenly distributed all of the beef/horseradish mixture in the 12 holes. I baked it for about 15 minutes (until about 2" higher than the top of the tin and the tips were heavily browned). Then topped the Yorkshire puddings with my leftover onion gravy. A hit! Thanks for a great idea / base recipe!

pretty decent recipe, I used the 1/2 tbsp as well and got 3 rounds with out adding any more oil. I didn't have any roast beef so I just baked a steak in some spices and red wine and then cut it into small pieces and added a bit of horse radish cream and others I added some grainy mustard. Both were delious.

I was looking for a way to eat up some of our leftover Christmas prime rib and this recipe was PERFECT!!! I made 6 since I wasn't sure my little ones would like them but they did too! My only pointer would be to put the muffin tin on top of a jellyroll pan because some of the oil spilled over. Thank you for sharing this recipe! Will make again and again!

I strongly recommend finding a yorkshire pud recipe that uses less eggs, and lets the batter rest long enough for the flour to blend better with the liquids.  Way too eggy

These are well worth the time with a prime rib roast.  Makes an awsome presentation and an excellent Christmas dinner.

When I first took these out of the oven they smelled kind of eggy and I wasn't too sure about the texture but.........Wow!! I have never had Yorkshire pudding before so I can't compare but they are so good! They almost end up like a dumpling, it was amazing that something so good could come from so few ingredients!!

My husband and I love this dish.  Thanks to the suggestions of the other reviews, I used half the amount of oil.  So far, I've used leftover beef roast and pork roast as filler -- it's worth the smoky oven for the results.

I wanted to use leftover, extremely rare primerib in this recipe so I diced the meat first and browned it quickly in a small amount of oil. I cut the recipe in half, using 2 whole eggs and 1 egg white in flour mixture and also didn't feel it was necessary to use an entire tblsp of oil in the muffin cups. Instead of a 12 muffin pan, I used a 6 muffin pan for bigger yorkies. These were baked for about 15 to 20 mins and turned out perfectly delish!

I'm not sure which rock I have been under, but I have never had Yorkshire pudding until now. This was super easy to make and I enjoyed watching them bake and grow. I took the advise of gizzysmom and looked up other recipes for Yorkshire pudding. I found one that only called for 3 eggs, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of salt. I left the eggs and milk come to room temperature too. (someone advised that was important for them to raise the best)I used a half teaspoon each of oil and butter in the muffin tin and added roast beef and horseradish. They were good my husband even liked them. This did make twice as many as we could eat. I am hoping they will be just as good warmed up tomorrow. -nutcrackernut

These sounded like a great idea but were a huge disappointment.  The Yorkshire pudding portion of this recipe was the main problem.  My usual recipe calls for 2 eggs to 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of milk.  These didn't rise well and were more like eggy muffins gone wrong.  I made them in order to take a picture but alas they were too ugly to photograph.  They didn't rise well and they weren't crispy.  Like others have said, it is essential to reduce the amount of oil called for or you risk a fire hazard.  At the same time you have to make sure the sides of the cups are greased or they stick.  It is a great idea but just didn't work for us.

Yorkshire pudding should have a rich beef taste, these were terribly bland, it was way too heavy, use 2-3 eggs, not 5.  greasy, way too much oil. grease the muffing cups with Crisco or a little butter. I love Yorkshire pudding, but these were pretty bad.  Will not make again.

Fabulous as written. I did not have any au jus, so I just skipped it and they were fine. The only thing that I wish the author included was how many muffin cups to fill with oil. I filled 15 and got 14 baby Yorkies. Brought this to our friends' Easter dinner and it was a hit!

The only change I made was that I did not add much horseradish.  Maybe a tbl for the entire batch.  I should have added a little more, but not sure I could handle the tsp for each 'cup'.  
I also made my own au jus from the left over broth I cooked the roast beef in.   Only because I had it and did not have a can of au jus already :)  
Definitely will make this again!

Turned out really well. I used cornstarch instead of flour at 1/2 the amount and they were beautiful. I could had added more beef but other than that they tasted very good.

These were great! I used leftover shredded roast from a beef dip and the Yorkshire rose up great around the beef. I made 6 large ones as this was our main course and it took about 25 min at 400. Definitely make this again!

This is a great idea. I made them with my leftover prime rib. Delicious. I have a couple of suggestions; first let the batter rest, use 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of oil, bake until golden brown, maybe 30 minutes.

Yorkshire pudding should be light and fluffy. My English grandmother used 3 eggs 1 cup flour 1 cup milk and 1/4 t salt. then everything else is pretty much the same. Hot oil pour in batter, 400 degree oven bake 30 mins. they should rise up like popovers which is basically what they are.
