Definitely tasty and the perfect comfort food! I did, however, added chicken broth to make it a bit more liquified otherwise it was too thick. Other than that it was delicious!

Pretty good.  I was using a bulk chorizo, so I don't think it turned out like it could have, but it was okay.  I may or may not try again.

Really flavorful and good! I used smoked paprika instead of regular an dit complemented the chorizo perfectly and added an extra depth of flavor.

Really, really good -- a hit with kids and adults alike. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out delicious. Honestly much better than I expected with cream of chicken soup as an ingredient. This one's going in my recipe box for sure!

I liked it, was good for a quick meal.  Used white grape juice instead of wine and had it with a side of veges and a toasted dinner roll instead of rice.  Quick and easy, I think this would be a meal that would go down well with families who have a fussy eater.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  These are the changes we made because of what we had on hand.  Soy chorizo, crumbled instead of sliced,  homemade cream of chicken soup (not a fan of the canned chemicals), chicken broth instead of wine b/c we were out, added sauteed mushrooms with step 3, added more broth (about 3/4 cup) to desired consistency.  Served over brown rice with tortillas on the side.  Will make it again for sure.

This was quite good, my family enjoyed it.  I didn't have fresh garlic so I sprinkled the chicken pieces with Goya Adobo.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.  I couldn't find any chorizo so I used hot Italian sausage links (we like spicy at my house).  I cooked the sausage and when that was done, I cooked the chicken in the same pan.  Very good!  We ate it over brown rice that I mixed some chopped scallions into.  Not only was it good, but it was SUPER easy, too!

Lovely dish, I served with rice and potato wedges (I'm Irish). I also used smoked paprika.

Brought this for a potluck dinner and it was a hit.  Very easy to make and was loved by everyone (even people who don't like Chorizo)

It is edible, but I wouldn't make it again. I don't understand how the sauce is so light colored in the picture when there are 2 tablespoons of paprika in the dish.

Tried this the first time and loved it. Tried it again, and this time added to the recipe, some chopped onions, a fresh seeded pablano pepper - it was absolutly amazing!  One tip though - drain most of the fat after frying the meats so the sauce doesn't break after cooking.

Here is the deal, I changed ingredients, due to what I had in my house. which I think is what we all do.. I used Mexican rolled pork chorizo, and sweet smoked paprika and an Ozark Mt.sweet white wine.. and we are in love with this recipe.. loved it over rice/green peas... I love playing with recipes.. and making them our own. Thanks.. the Wallace house loves this.

This was good, but mostly it was easy to prepare with few ingredients.  Very rich tasting, you can't eat too much of it.  I would suggest putting some green onions or tomato/rotel cilantro?  Just my opinion.

I thought this was a fabulous dish and easy! and my family loved it too! I used boneless chicken breast cut in small pieces, used SOY chorizo, and added 4 breakfast links all smashed up. I loved the creamy sauce that it makes as it simmers down and served over rice, it IS a comfort style dish. It's very flavorful and not too spicy. I will definitely make again on a cool evening - yummy!
