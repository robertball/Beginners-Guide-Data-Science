I’ve already posted a review of these... love them! Based on someone else’s review I skipped the wrapping and chilling and put them directly into a muffin tin. This gave me 12 vs 8 at 132 calories and about 1 gram carb each. The only thing I’ll do differently next time is grease the muffin tin with more butter to make them easier to get out.

Have made this 3 times now and absolutely love it! I have not needed to make any substitions. I usually double the batch and freeze some so I can take them out as needed. Definitely recommend!

I have made these a few times and they are amazing. Instead of the last step of placing them between sheets of wax paper or other, I just put the mix straight in to muffin tins. They come out perfect! I added a bit of dried herbs for color and I used just a teeny pinch of garlic powder instead of half teaspoon as I do not like them too garlicky. Just my own opinion. I may add onion powder next time instead. Or both! Luv these. I also added a tablespoon of parm. Thanks for sharing
