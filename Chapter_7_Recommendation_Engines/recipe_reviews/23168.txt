I hated this recipe.  It sounds easy and good but when I tried the recipe this evening, it was a major disaster!!  They were more like broccoli blobs.

This recipe must be missing a step or ingredient or several.  It was the biggest mess.  I wish that I would have read the review before wasting my money and time.

Good recipe but missing a step or 2. You guys need to make sure you freeze the bites for at least an hour before deep frying or else they will melt, I also eggwashed/breadcrumbed them after freezing since they didnt seem coated well enough. otherwise was fantastic with bacon bits added!

I hate to say it, but this recipe was awful.  

Once I put these in the hot oil, they fell apart.  The bread crumbs became separated from the broccoli balls, and turned into clumps of fried crumbs.  Everything else just turned into an oily mass of cheese.  There is nothing holding these things together.  Don't waste your time.

I would like to customize this recipe but am unable to because I'm not a member. I thought I'd add some suggestions as it seems some tips/alterations would make this recipe a success. If keeping the ingredients the same it is very important you let the broccoli/cheese mixture 'set' for atleast 15 minutes. I do not however suggest using breadcrumbs as I think a wet batter or wonton wrapper would work MUCH better. You will find it will no longer fall apart when frying them. I hope everyone reads this review before attempting it as is and being very disappointed!

I have no idea why I didn't read the reviews before trying this. They made a mess, and no one wanted to ever eat broccoli again at my house. Maybe this recipe was missing a step or needed different ingredients because it had so many things wrong with it, I'm not sure where to start!

Despite all of the bad reviews about this recipe, I tried it anyways.  

I used Velveta cheese with bacon bits mixed in instead of plain cheddar thinking that would melt and form better.  I dipped the floret's in the cheese one-by-one, and put them on waxed paper to cool a bit and congeal before rolling them in the bread crumbs.  

They looked great before they went into the oil.  They eneded up being a disaster!  The cheese all but burned, they all ended up clumped together, even though I only had them in the fryer a mere 3 minutes, the bread crumb/cheese mixture ended up being the color of oreos.  Huge waste of time and money, next time I'll just buy the convenient pre-made ones in the freezer.

This recipe wasn't awful but it wasn't great.  I made it twice, once following the recipe exactly and the second time I substituted fresh broccoli in place of the frozen broccoli.  The second time around it was crispy and tasty.  The frozen broccoli lacks flavor and leaves you with soft blobs of battered broccoli.  The fresh broccoli works much much better.

Just batter the broccoli, deep-fry, then dip in a cheese fondue.

I typically make the recipe as written but after reading all of the reviews I knew changes needed made. It's hard to give this a fair rating however I challenged myself to stick to the recipe as close as I could yet make changes that would be beneficial to the next person that comes along and makes this. So, here is what I did and they turned out great. For starters I used fresh broccoli chopped up that I steamed in the microwave for a few minutes. Frozen may work just fine but it holds extra moisture and tends to get soggy so I didn't even want to take that risk. Because this was an experiment and had potential to flop, I did not go out and buy more cheese but used what I had on hand. I had 2 cups of sharp cheddar and 2 cups of white American cheese. Any cheese of your choice will work in this as long as it is a melting cheese. Okay so on to the changes in the method. After the cheese was melted and the broccoli was mixed in, I added a cup of bread crumbs and gave it a good stir. Instead of letting it cool on the stove for 15 minutes, I stuck the mixture in a bowl and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes. I then formed the mixture into balls (the mixture is very tacky at this point) and then coated the balls with the remaining bread crumb. The easiest way to do this with minimal mess is to pour your breadcrumbs into a gallon size ziplock bag and drop the balls in one at a time and give the bag a good shake. After the balls were coated I stuck them on a paper plate and in the
