Super fantastic. One of those meals you simply cannot stop eating. Add a couple lines of BBQ sauce for a smoky flavor boost. BBQ sauce is a great pairing with the red onion and cream cheese.

Made this two days in a row on the weekend; it was such a
big hit at two different b-b-q's.   Followed the recipe to a "T"
but just added some extra chopped jalapeno's for extra spice as hubby likes it hot.  Easy to prepare and tastes awesome!  I have a feeling this will be requested a lot!

Super good! My husband is not a fan of spicy food and he liked this, said its a keeper! I will be making this again. It'd be great to bring ad a dish to pass.
