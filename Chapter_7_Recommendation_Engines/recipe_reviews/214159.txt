I submitted this recipe. Just a note: the way this was edited is not quite right. In step 2, I do not moisten any edges before I start rolling the string cheese up. Where is says to roll to the end and press to seal, I take a fork dipped in water and dab the inside of the open corner with it, then finishg rolling and press to seal. Also, in step 4, I repeat dipping the mozzarella sticks into the egg wash and into the bread crumbs. And of course, serve with marinara sauce ;). Enjoy!

These were very good, but I think they should be fried at a lower temp, maybe 325 or 350 because they browned up really fast, but the egg roll wrapper still seemed a little raw. I took the submitter's advice and double breaded them and that created an awesome crispy coating, which I loved! Also, I didn't measure the milk, but I know that I did not use the full 2 cups, maybe only 1/2-3/4 cup and I still had some leftover after double dipping the sticks. These may seem a little time consuming, but they are absolutely not. All in all this was a great concept and they are good! I will definately be making these again with a few minor adjustments! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are great Mozz sticks, my Hubby liked them and that deserves a 20 in my book.. I put the left over ones in the freezer.  The one thing I am going to do is also put some, parm cheese in the Italian mix.

So easy and delicious!  1 egg + 1/2 c milk.  Double dip bread crumbs.  Heat oil to 325/350 (medium).

Not good. I tried these because I've had mozzarella sticks explode in the fryer, but this recipe is just bad. The breaded egg roll wrapper is far too thick and the texture is unappetizing. Try another recipe.

Very good..i added some Montreal steak rub to the breading and Franks hot sauce to the egg wash to add some kick to the flavor. Double breaded them and fried at about 345*F. Turned out deliciously amazing =)

I wasn't sure how there would turn out. The egg roll wrappers on cheese sticks sounded strange, but they were REALLY good! Will definately make these again.

These were awesome! I made my own wrappers, but stuck with the same idea of wrapping and double-battering. they came out very crispy and delicious and worked as a wonderful little project for my nephew and I while babysitting.

Better than any restaurant.  I made them the first time as written.  The second time I added Parmesan cheese and loved the results.  Cooking in lower temperature of 325 was best.  I used real mozzarella cheese and cut sticks large, as big as possible, yet they still could fit in the egg roll wrapper.  I also trimmed off any extra egg roll wrapper as I rolled them.  Less wrapper is best.  I double dipped them, as recommended.  Only used 1/2 cup milk.  Thanks!

First time working with wonton wrappers but these came out great! Used a brick of mozzarella cut into the right size and panko instead of breadcrumbs.

Really good recipe and super easy to make. The only thing I did differently was to eggwash and then breadcrumb it twice as the first attempt didn't coat them very well. This is one of my new favourites.

I just made them. Actually I'm eating one as I type. I laid out everything I needed and got the deep fryer up to temp. I did a couple things different. I added pepperoni to half of them. They tasted great, a little greasy but we loved them. Also when I started to fry them I forgot to do the egg wash and bread crumbs. I did about 4 like that then the rest I did the way the recipe called for. We liked them both ways. The one trouble I had with the bread crumbs was I couldn't tell for sure when they were done. Over all we loved them and I will be making them again.

Great idea with the egg rolls! Never would have come up with that. However I prefer spring rolls for less chewy and more crispy edges with cheese strings cut in half. One egg/one cup milk was more than enough for me to do 32 full sized mozza sticks cut into 64 half sticks. Dipping breaded sticks into egg/breadcrumbs a second time is a must! Freeze these for an easy snack.
