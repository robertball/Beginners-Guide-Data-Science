This is very good and I would make it again.  The reference to "Mason Jar Peach Cobbler" is to the Mason jar in which the peaches were canned.  It is written right at the bottom of the page if you read the whole thing.  Good luck and try it!

I had canned some peaches a year ago and wanted to use them up.  This was a perfect recipe for them.  I combined all the dry ingredients, melted the butter and added it to 1/2 the milk, then added the juice from the peaches to the batter until I could just about pour it into the dish. I topped the batter with the peaches and baked it about 45 mins.  It came out very good and I got raves around the table.  I will make this recipe again.

It was not sweet at all.   Needs at LEAST twice the sugar, if not more.   The recipe says peaches and "juice' so that's what I bought.... I think maybe it was supposed to be with the syrup instead?   This was bitter and plain.   Tasted like boiled peaches and bread.   However, it came out of the oven beautiful, I'll give it that....

I made half the recipe so I used one quart of home canned peaches. I also used a gluten free cup for cup flour. Otherwise I followed the directions until the end where I misread the last part and mixed the peaches into the batter. It was good but I think wouldâ€™ve been better as written with the batter in first and topped with the peaches.
