I made this recipe for my husband tonight, and we both loved it. I used Kathy K's idea and used the olive oil from the sun-dried tomatoes, and Zuzana's idea to add a little corn starch at the end to thicken it. This recipe is a definitely a keeper!

I have been making my own version of this meal for years.  The biggest difference is that I use two cans of chicken broth, then cook the pasta with the rest of the ingredients.  It is a one-pan meal with little clean-up, you do not need a starchy thickener AND the pasta tastes great.  Everyone in my family loves this meal!

Delicious! Used black olives, chicken breast tenders, 3 cloves of garlic, Juliane cut sun-dried tomatoes with herbs,  and served over spinach fettichini sprinkled with feta. So flavorful, will definitely make this for company.

Absolutely fantastic. Did not change the recipe at all except for thickening the sauce at the end with cornstarch. Great with rice or pasta .

I made this tonight, as written, except used the oil from the jar of sun dried tomato (rather than olive oil) and used a little less feta cheese (personal taste).  Also I cooked it with the lid off to reduce the liquid a bit. Used black olives. It is full of flavor and delicious!

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  My only change was sun-dried tomatoes (dry) and then re-hydrated in the chicken broth (which I used less of) and to thicken a little, I added about 1/2 C. of light sour cream.  Yummy

Hubby said A++ - I would say a solid A . . . Simple(short ingredient list), quick(prep and cleanup), easy, tasty and nutritious. Looking for ways to used my sun dried tomatoes from summer- this is a unique and pleasant flavor. I used black olives and chicken thighs as that it what I had. I would like to see a calorie count on this one. Thanks for posting

Love this recipe! So full of flavor and pretty simple to throw together! I used Bonnie J's suggestion and  increased the chicken broth and cooked the pasta right in with the other ingredients. Soooo yummy! I threw in black olives and an extra clove of garlic, which was just personal preference. A real keeper!

Excellent and easy.  What more can you ask?
Only change to the process was using my mini-prep food processor to mince the garlic, kalamata olive, and sundried tomatoes.  Sautéed onion and one chicken breast cut small in a bit of olive oil, then added the mixture.  Let it sauté a bit, then added herbs, artichokes with juice, and broth.  No thickener needed, as other reviews suggested!  I added crushed red pepper, omitted salt, and might add spinach next time.  There will definitely be a next time!  PS- only 2 ounces of feta and 2 ounces of real Parmesan, plus some crusty bread to sop up those juices (the real reason not to use a thickener!)

We eat a lot of pasta and this was a nice change from using plain marinara or cream sauce, although the ingredients can be a little pricey. I've made it twice and the second time I used a lot more chicken broth than it called for and some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Then I tossed the pasta in the sauce so it was all coated.  It was much more flavorful this way.

I substituted 1/2 cup white wine for the chicken broth and left out the olives. I also squeezed a litte lemon into the broth while simmering.  Didn't have any feta so sprinkled with Parmesan. Tasted great!  Will make this again soon.

I make something like this often.  I use red, green and yellow peppers  to.  I made this as written and loved it to.  Rather than using a thickener, try a little of the pasta water.  It marries the sauce to the pasta.  I might add some crisp bacon to it like I do in my recipe.

It's a winner! Added the oil from tomatoes. Thicken with an extra half cup chicken broth and two tablespoons corn starch at the end. Had fresh fettuccine. Perfect! Going to make for company next. Also used the feta with tomato and basil. Enjoy

I really love the taste of this recipes; olives, artichokes & sundried tomatoes go *so* well together. Unfortunately, my husband and son did not care for this so I have to give it a 4 stars instead of 5 stars. If you like the Mediterranean flavors, you'll love this recipe.

I was looking for a recipe to use Spinach & Feta Chicken sausage but wasn't finding anything so I decided to use this recipe substituting the chicken sausage for the chicken breast. It turned out amazing.  I did make a few other changes based on what I was trying to accomplish. I added about a 1/4 c.  white wine and thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch. I also added a little bit of the feta and then stirred my pasta into the sauce to let it soak up some of the flavor.

I tried to make this as simple as possible. I couldn’t find sun dried tomatoes, so I had to use sun dried tomato bruschetta. I used the oil from that to start cooking the chicken. After about 5 minutes, I added the other ingredients, including 2.25 cups of chicken broth and the uncooked pasta. It was a tasty one-pan meal.

This is a very tasty recipe. Next time I will use a little corn starch so it is creamier.

Loved this recipe.  It was easy to make, and the mix of all the ingredients made this dish an immediate favorite in my house.  Although I didn't have Feta cheese in the house I substituted with fresh parmesan.  I know though if I had the I would be off the walls in  love with this dish.

I really wanted to like this, as I love all the ingredients it called for and actually had all the ingredients on hand.  I made recipe as written and will not make again (as written). It wasn't worth all the effort for the "meh" taste and cost.

Easy, delicious meal that uses simple pantry staples with fresh chicken.  Simple enough for a weeknight meal.  3 out of  4 of my  kids loved it.  My husband is not an artichoke fan, but he said the recipe was ok and he'd eat it again.  My son doesn't like black olives, but he said he couldn't even taste them in the yummy sauce.  I loved it - especially because all the ingredients were unprocessed (okay, several are stored in jars in the pantry, but none of them have crazy sounding ingredients I can't pronounce, such as what we find in cream of whatever soups).   Thanks for a good one!

I couldn't get sun-dried tomatoes at my grocery store and didn't want to run to the Italian store so I used a jar of Brushetta which is a paste of sun-dried tomatoes, spices, and olive oil. I just had to check the label and adjust the recipe. It made a really nice red sauce.

This  recipe will be a staple in our kitchen.  It was so easy and tasty.  I used a whole package of chicken (1.7 lbs) so I used a whole onion and added more spices.  I think I could have added more chicken broth because it cooked down a lot.  I also had added some corn starch per other recommendations.  I also didn't have sundried tomatoes in oil, so I added one package of dry from Trader Joe's.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I doubled the recipe and made it pretty much as written. I did use fresh herbs and triple the chicken broth so we could have more sauce. The biggest alteration I made was I did not precook the chicken. Based on the cubed chicken size as written in the recipe I figured the final 10 minutes of cooking was sufficient to cook the chicken. The chicken came out perfect. The only changes I'll make next time is add more sun dried tomatoes and increase the fresh herbs. Very tasty. I served it with a fresh Mediterranean salad and hot rosemary bread. I made it for a dinner party of all adult men, except for me. Husband, sons, and friends. They ate every bite and some had seconds.

This was a great recipe! It was very light and would also taste wonderful with a little citrus drizzled on top. I also substituted sauted mushrooms for the olives and all of the flavors still meshed well together.  This is a great summer dish!

We totally enjoyed this dish! 
The things I did differently were to toss the feta in towards the end to let it melt through, and then tossed it with a different pasta to catch the sauce.
Melting the feta eliminated the need to add any thickener as others had stated. I also added a bit of torn fresh spinach, and substituted the dry basil for the basil paste. 
Served it up in a pasta bowl, and we devoured it! :)
Think it would be delish with shrimp.......

This is so flippin good! Super easy and very tasty and versatile. I made it one night without the artichoke hearts and subbed large green olives, thinly sliced (I didn't have all the ingredients).  Delicious. I made this again last week with all the ingredients and it was even better. I also had a jar of garlic-stuffed olives I wanted to use, so I pulled the garlic cloves out, sauteed those, and then added the sliced green olives in with the recipe. Easy, fast, tasty -- keeping this one.

This recipe was pretty good! Although you definitely have to like artichokes and olives to enjoy this dish, which thankfully, most of my family does. This was quite easy to make so it would be good for a weeknight dinner, or as something simple for the weekend. Thank you for the recipe!

This was excellent!  I used the sun dried tomatoes and marinated artichokes but used the oil and liquid from them in lieu of olive oil to sauté the vegetables and chicken.  I also added about 3/4ths of a bag of fresh spinach.  I will definitely make this again and maybe try with pork as well.

I've made this several times - the first time exactly as written, and it went over well, but it needed tweaking because my kids decided the olives were overwhelming the flavor of the dish and they would prefer a sauce that would "stick better" to the pasta.  (I thought it was 5 star as written, by the way).  So, the next time I made it, I left out the olives, tossed the pasta in a sauce made from one tub of crème fraiche and 2 jars of sundried tomato pesto, and spooned the chicken mixture onto the top of the pasta, leaving the cooking liquid behind.  It was now 5 star for them (and a lot more fattening!)

My husband loved it. I  however couldn't get past all the dried oregano and dried basil.  Other than that I thought it was very tasty. Next time I will use fresh basil  and dried oregano.

This was delicious. Even though I forgot the feta cheese at the end! I made this for two people, which ended up being probably between 3 and 4 servings. I'd didn't use oregano as I didn't have any and I increased the amount of chicken broth as per suggestions in other reviews. I thought about thickening the sauce, but decided against it and I liked it as it was (it is a very thin sauce, so depends on what you're looking for). This is a delicious meal, don't think any changes are necessary. Although I suppose I should try it with the feta cheese before making that statement...

I made almost as is, but used white wine to scrape up chicken bits before adding everything else,  used more chicken broth, used regular tomatoes instead of sundried, and (accidentally) used olives with jalepeños. I was worried it'd make it taste strange but it actually made it so good. Also at the end I used corn starch to thicken the sauce. This is the second time I made it. First time I made it exactly as is. This gave it a bit extra flavor.

I made it, but modified slightly...  I sauteed mushrooms with mine, also added some balsamic vinegar, cooked my chicken with celery salt, and served with wild rice instead of pasta.  I didn't have sundried tomatoes, nor feta cheese.  It darkened up a lot and didn't look nearly as pretty as the picture on AllRecipes, but it tasted SOOOOO good!!!  :-)  I will definitely be making it again.

Based on other reviews, I used herbed sun dried tomatoes and wine instead of the chicken broth. I used kalamata olives. I ground chicken or tofu would also work well.

I had plenty left over and used the extra to make home made pizza. I think it was even better that way!

We loved this recipe, such a good combination of flavors.  I had to use an italian cheese mixture since I didn't have feta.  Can't wait to try it again with feta.

We loved it.  Only changes were boneless skinless chicken thighs and sundried tomatoes re-constituted in water.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti.  This recipe is a keeper.

Really great recipe.  Don't over cook the chicken.  Cook just until the chicken looses it's pink on the outside.  The chicken cooks enough during the simmering stage.  I added baby spinach the last 5 minutes.  Delish!

I made this with spaghetti instead because I had plenty of it and it turned out amazing. I made the entire 8 servings for just myself with plans to freeze 6 portions for the future. I made the mistake of mixing all the noodles and topping in a giant pot. Made it very difficult to portion out equal amounts of non-noodle ingredients. Will make again and keep them separate for freezing!

This was really good. I splashed in a little bit of dry red wine and used thin chicken cutlets instead of cutting up the breasts into pieces.

This was delicious and our whole family enjoyed it.  I think using the virgin olive oil from the sun dried tomatoes is good advice.  I think some fresh lemon juice and spinach would be a great modification.  I will fix this again!

This also works as a stuffing for chicken breast or simply as a topping on chicken. Just put everything except the chicken and pasta in a food processor, including the feta, (or chop it all yourself) and spoon it inside or on chicken.  I did this once and it was great. May try to add a little spinach to the mix another time.

I have a question to ask everyone.  I prepared the recipe as it stated.  Prepared it early, placed it in the fridge.  When it was time to eat dinner, hubby warmed it up in the microwave (we were pressed for time).  Here's the question-  did anyone experience the chicken turning a grayish color?  Hubby swears it was because of the black olives.  I prepared the dish once before with out the olives and my husband swears that was the difference.  Chicken did not turn that color. I think it must have been a combination of reheating it in the microwave and maybe the olives.  The turning of color did not affect the taste at all, the dish was delicious!

I love all of these ingredients. Maybe it was just me, but unfortunately I bought artichokes in brine, didn't strain like the recipe said, and made it so bitter. I was very sad. Also thought using the oil from the sundried tomatoes made the flavor too strong. I'm going to "adjust" it next time. More broth, zero oil from tomatoes and certainly wash the canned artichokes. Everything else was wonderful!!!  The feta is strong too although I added to taste so it wasn't overwhelming (and we are big feta fans).  A few minor adjustments will make it a much healthier dish. I did serve with spinach and tomato pasta.  I think just the brine being washed off (if anyone else makes my mistake) it would be better.

Made this recipe tonight.  Was very tasteful and easy. I always think pasta recipes seem like it should only take like 20 minutes to put together from beginning to end. From taking ingredients out of frig till eating was about 1 hour. Not too bad but weeknight might seem a lot. Followed exactly and it came out good with leftovers for tomorrow.

DELICIOUS! I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. I was worried he wouldn't care for it because when I asked if he liked artichokes he said they were, "okay". He ate two big plates, he also bragged to everyone about it. I will make it again. The only thing negative about this recipe is that it is costly to make. I made it with fresh sautéed spinach and mushrooms and asparagus. I didn't have any of the ingredients to cook with and I spent $50.13. It was well worth it.

This recipe is soooo... delicious! We have definitely added it to our normal dinner rotation. It is super easy to make, anyone who can read instructions can do it. It makes A LOT of food, I had to transfer from my biggest pan to a big pot! I recommend putting a little butter on the angel hair pasta and make sure you put some of the broth on the noodles too! Also I used a tomato basil feta and it was so yummy!!! Happy cooking! Serve with Pino Grigio.

Simple, light, and amazing.  A lot of recipes like this get too oily so I like that this recipe uses chicken broth.  Not an olive fan so just skipped that part.  I recommend the jarred sundried tomatoes (not the bagged).

, but without the chicken broth. I made Alfredo sauce, and cookwd fettuccini, we ate it over the fettuccini. Absolutely delicious!  Cook the chicken first, then saute  the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes in some olive oil, add some mushrooms, chopped spinach, and black olives, toss all with the chicken, and put on the alfredo covered fettuccini!your taste buds will thank you!

Delicious recipe!  Great combination of favors.  My husband loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly.   Good enough for a company meal.  I may substitute capers for the olives next time.  Thanks for a winner, Benibree!

Very enjoyable!  My husband 's  first comment was "I Love It!".  This is coming from a man who does not care for artichokes.  I too loved it as I had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  I followed the suggestion to use the oil from the sundried tomatoes and used thin spagetti instead of angel hair because that is what I had open.  I added the cooked pasta to the skillet when the chicken mixture was cooked.  Will make this again because most times I have everything and it was delicious.

too many bold flavors for a hot pasta dish. The recipe might do better with a different/smaller type pasta and served as a cold pasta salad. It greatly resembles recipes for a Greek pasta salad, or even a tortellini salad. - Ellie

This was absolutely delicious.  I tossed in some portabella mushrooms and used kalamata olives.  I had it over a baked potato.  I can't wait to make it for company.  Thank you!

It weekend this recipe a little by baking chicken quarters seasoned with lemon pepper. I also substituted whole grain pasta and cooked the artichokes in chicken stock. I then added the cooked pasta to the artichokes and chicken stock and added the sundries tomatoes with a little of olive oil. This makes the recipe a little healthier and calls for less sodium.

Given the reviews and that I like the ingredients, I was very disappointed with the result. While the recipe was easy to make, and the chicken was tender, the dish lacked flavor and the flavor of the ingredients did not "come together." I will definitely not be making this recipe again.

I made this pasta tonight for my family and everyone loved it.  I subbed fresh herbs for the dried, thickened the sauce, and subbed spaghetti for angel hair pasta.  I think a squeeze of lemon might have been nice. It was deeeeelish!

The recipe doesn't say what kind of olives to use, so I used black olives.  Loaded with flavor and extremely easy to make. Brenibree, thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe.
