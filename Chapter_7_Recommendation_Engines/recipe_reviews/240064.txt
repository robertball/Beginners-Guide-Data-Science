Just a quick comment.  I made meringue bones one year. If they break in half, as meringue can do, they don't look like bones anymore... they look like the private parts of a man.  It was quite embarrassing as I took them to a school sponsored event for my son's elementary school.  Stick with the ghosts!

I have made these meringue ghosts two years in a row, and they always come out perfect! This has become my go-to meringue recipe. I might suggest adding a few drops of vanilla extract for flavor, but that's optional.

I made it before Halloween to test it and held perfectly. It tasted sweet, but not over-powering. I will be proud to serve these at my Halloween party later in the month! I hope other people try this and get the success I got. This was such a great idea, I bet I couldn't think of that. I also tried the witches fingers and that was also very creative.

Very easy to make with electric mixer. It wasn't October, so we added some brown gel coloring and made poop emoji cookies.

Such an easy recipe! Watching the video was helpful, and using an electric mixer made it even easier.

They were AMAZING!!! I definitely recommend this! I added food coloring to half of the uncooked meringue, and made them into flowers.

Maybe I have weak arms, but this was impossible for me to whisk by hand. I only have a hand-held mixer so I had to use that for a good 15 minutes to get the mixture nice and fluffy. My sore arms were worth it though; these are soo yummy!

I have always wanted to try merengues and this recipe was just right!  Beating the eggs by hand proved to be too much for  me.  I had to enlist my husbands help and I ended up getting out the electric beater.  Wonderful Halloween treat.

It was hard to get the bones to not break apart. Make them thicker than you think. The ghosts were hard to make too but tasted great!

I've made meringue cookies a lot.  I use different extracts and colors. I've never used the lemon juice I've always used the Cr√®me of tartar.  I want to try this one with black and make black cats, maybe with Anise extract.   Has anybody tried this.  If it turns out for me, I'll try and post a picture.

This turned out super cute! For my oven I found 225 to be on the hot side, a 2nd batch turned out better closer to 200. I also struggled with using a toothpick to apply the decoration (user error I'm sure) and ended up making ganache that I put in a plastic squeeze dispenser to add the eyes and mouths.

I had my oven on the lowest temperature but they turned a tiny bit brown. Next time I preheat my oven really good and turn it off after 30 minutes. I added a teaspoon vanilla flavour.
