A great way to use up an open bottle of red wine! Be sure to use a fresh, quality ginger ale for that needed zing.  I floated grape “eyeballs” in ours for a Halloween theme.

I am the recipe creator. As one reviewer suggested, regular gingerale (not diet) contributes the best soda taste for this drink. I use and suggest a high quality gingerale such as Vernons. Enjoy!

This is so dependent on the wine you use.  I know nothing about wine, so I followed the suggestion in the recipe description and it made it a touch dry for my crowd.  Knowing your drinkers and your wine can make this a nice sangria-esque drink in a pinch.  THANKS, for the recipe!

Watch out for both the ginger ale and the wine.  If you use a super sweet wine then your drink will be super sweet.  I used diet ginger ale, which is what I had on hand.  Next time I would use a drier red and non diet.  I still prefer classic sangria, but this is good in a pinch.
