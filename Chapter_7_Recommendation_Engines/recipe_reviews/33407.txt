After following this recipe to a T I enjoyed a succulent hearty meal followed by a not so savory trip to the toilet. The diarrhea was horrific. I swear I could smell the curry as it exploded out of my rectum making a magnificent splash along with an agonizing burning pain. If you suffer from any sort of stomach problems and want to save your carpet DO NOT consume this meal.

We love this recipe at our house!  I've found that if I mix the ground spices together over the weekend or sometime when I'm waiting for something to finish in the kitchen and seal them in a zipper bag, this becomes less intimidating for week nights, since all I have to do is dump the mixture in at the right time.  Makes life even easier.

Very good - not quite like Indian curry from the restaurant but very good! And I love Quorn!

This is a fantastic recipe. I used half the Quorn and a 15oz can of chickpeas (we like more beans). I also use canned tomatoes with green chiles in it to give it an extra kick. My life partner and I just love this. This is one of my new favourites.

my husband and i both like this a lot - we will make it again - it was a deep red color and was great over rice - i'm sure you could even add other vegetables if you wish - i think i may add broccoli or cauliflower next time - delicious!

This recipe is very easy and tasty! We loved it with MorningStar Chik'n Strips (instead of Quorn) and white rice.

This turned out wonderfully.  I've always loved the texture of Quorn.  I left out the cumin seed because I couldn't find it.  Not sure how much difference it would have made, though.

Quorn is a great product, and this is a great recipe. I added a little sugar (tsp) like I do to most everything I cook. Yummy !!

I made this recipe as written, and it was phenomenal!! I’ve never used Quorn before and this is a great way to try it. I usually stay away from chickpeas because I usually only like them in hummus, but this recipe has changed that. My kids loved this, my Hubby loved this and I loved it! Such an easy and taste meal! Unfortunately, I forgot to make the saffron jasmine rice to go with it, but there’s always next time.

Followed the recipe although did not include Garam masala at the end, instead added broccoli.  Really, really good.  Will defo make this again, and portion it out and freeze it.  Lovely.

this was very yummy. I could have done with a little more heat, but my housemate described it as 'delicious and perfect', so I can't have done too badly. I added some green peppers for colour.
