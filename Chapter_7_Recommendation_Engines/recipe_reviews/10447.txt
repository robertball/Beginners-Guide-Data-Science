These cookies were amazing.  I made a few changes based on some other reviews... increased cinnamin to 2 tsp and increased the molasses to 1/2 c.  Also used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. br sugar.  The resulting cookie was soft, had excellent flavor and tasted great iced with caramel frosting.

Great Recipe, I agree with changing the 1 tsp of Cinnamon to 2 tsp, much more flavor and I used just under 1/2 cup of molasses. Becel Margarine rather than butter.  Very soft, chewy and delicious cookies

I used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white, but I think I should have added more brown, because they aren't too sweet.  I also added more spice then in the recipe.  After you roll them in ball if you smash them down an top them with powdered sugar they turn out much better.

Came out great!  I increased the amount of spices a bit (another 1/2 tsp. or so), and also added some ground nutmeg and ground cloves.  Next time I'll try splitting the sugars with white and brown like some others suggested.   Brought a batch to work and everyone loved them!

iam from the countryside in egypt and i go mad each time i read a recipe saying cookie dough or cookie mix or whatnot i thought this recipe would be easy enough to make and it was..its extremely delicious too ..the cookies were so light and soft..seemed bit too sweet to eat alone though..by the way ..u can substitute baking powder with baking soda its the same..i greased the sheets so cookies lost a bit of its shape but remained sweet though..am definitely goona make alot of soft cookies from now on

I do like these cookies very much, but I gave the recipe only three stars because they aren't chewy and they don't taste of molasses.  They are more like snickerdoodles (I sprinkled granulated sugar on top of the cookies before and after baking and that improved them).  The texture is very light and soft, which I do like, but it's not the molasses cookie heaviness I'm used to.

This had good flavor-texture soft and cake-like. I added chopped pecans to the second batch-better taste.

This recipe was disappointing.  The final result was a salty, cakey cookie, with none of the right flavors (or much flavor at all, for that matter).  I am, as I type this, trying to figure out what to put in the remaining batter to make it taste better.  I won't make this again.

These were really good.  Some modifications...I reduced the molasses to 1/2 cup (it was all I had), and added 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also used brown sugar, instead of white...to make a softer cookie.  My kids are loving them as I type!  I will make them again!

Good recipe, very light, soft and cake-like. Would have liked more molasses flavor. Maybe a stronger molassed next time.

I added 1/2 cup of additional molasses and a 1/2 cup of additional flour. The cookies turned out moist and soft and so delicious. Love this recipe and will be using it often.

Excellent and easy!  I changed the flour to 2 3/4 cups and changed the molasses to 1/2 cup.  I sprinkled sugar on them before baking and didn't glaze them.

Not really pleased with these. Does not represent the deep, rich flavor of molasses at all. Very mild flavor with a fluffy texture? Cooked to a pretty color and delicate aroma.

These are tasty but they are not rich in molasses flavor. They do not taste like the traditional kind. The texture is cake like for me.

I liked these, but they were more like mini-cakes than cookies.  I rated them only 3 stars because I like to eat cookie dough, and I didn't like the dough, but the cookies were actually good.  I wish they were more chewy than cakey.  Not a bad recipe, just not what I was looking for.

Good cookie, different from what your used to in the store.  Much more of a mild flavor.  
I found the secret to overcoming the cake-like texture.....Take cookies out of the oven just a minute or two early, lightly tap the cookie flat again (I just used a spatula).  Finish baking cookies.  I also baked them at 350 instead of 375, and took out just BEFORE they were thoroughly baked.  I baked them on a baking stone and left them on the stone until cooled.  Since the stone retains heat, they slowly finished baking on the stone.  Great texture.....  This technique seemed to make them a little more chewey.  Hope that helps!

I didn't have any sour cream so I used the evaporated milk and vinegar substitution mentioned.  I was a bit worried about the texture of the mix as I spooned it onto the baking sheet.  Very smooth and kinda runny.  I didn't have high hopes for how they'd turn out - but they cooked up just fine.  Not quite the texture/consistency I was looking for though once baked.  The kids didn't seem to mind however, so i'll probably make them agian for them -since they are so simple.

My husband loved these cookies. He said they were the best he ever had. They turned out very soft and are not flat like traditional molasses cookies. Using dark molasses is best.

These were so soft and tasty! I doubled the cinnamon and ginger because I like a heavier spice flavour in my cookies, and I added some nutmeg as well. They came out perfectly in 11 minutes.  Yesterday I made another batch, but with honey instead of molasses and just the recommended amount of spice. Those were really good too. I'm definitely keeping this recipe.

It didn't have enough molasses flavor, and was not sweet enough. I added 1/3 cup sugar to the final batter and made thinner cookies to make it taste better.

These cookies were delicious!  But I have gluten and casein intolerance, so I used buckwheat in place of wheat, olive oil in place of butter, and yogurt in place of sour cream (for some people like me yogurt is easier to digest than sour cream).
These cookies were easy and AWSOME!

I baked these for a cookie swap at work.  Since I don't bake very often and am not known for my culinary skills, people were surprised at just how good they were.  I found this recipe easy to follow and quick....a gem in the hectic holiday season.  Thank you!!

Fantastic cookie as I prefer soft cookies and I loved them. I would have made more of them and will the next time I make them. The first batch lasted two days as I enjoy coffee with my cookies and I don’t like to share. Very good cookies. ??

Ok, I made theses cookies and followed the suggested changes noted below, increase molasses to 1/2 cup, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugars and increS d cinnamon to 2 tsp..  I sprinkled mine with granulated sugar when finished baking.  I will definitely make these again.  Soft and a nice flavour.

I like thse very much.  I prefer the lighter molasses flavor.  Easy to mix up quickly and drop onto cookie sheets.  They are plain-looking, but very tasty!  Thank you.

These turned out delicious! I made them with full flavor molasses. Used 1/2 cup instead of the 1/3 cup. I used 2 tsp cinnamon and I didn't have sour cream so I used what I had, 3/4 cup skim milk and 1 tbsp vinegar, let it sit while i mixed the rest of the ingredients. turned out fine! I iced them with some confectioner's sugar and milk! Will definatly make again!

These are fantastic!! I also took suggestions from others....3 1/4cup flour...2/3+ cup molasses....1tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder....a bit more ginger and cinnamon...just about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and allspice....I used 1 cup of dark brown sugar...no white....and used 1/2cup shortening and 1/2cup butter....rolled them in white sugar before placing them on a baking stone...baked at 350 for about 10 minutes...then took the suggestion to gently flatten them at this point...bake for an additional 3-5 min....I also chilled the dough in the freezer...much easier to mold...turned out beautifully....and taste amazing!!!
