wow. we've made this as ordered, but we also used the buttermilk marinade for chicken wings and are REALLY pleased with the results. We haven't been back to that... place since we started making this recipe. If you do it right, it comes out great.

Made this the way Chef suggested (mostly), and split the recipe two ways to make a mild version for me, and a spicy version for my husband. The breading was great, but I think next time I will use slightly less cornstarch, because I think that might be why the breading comes off the chicken when you bite into it. I didn't really care though, the overall seasoning is awesome.

I'll admit that I did make a couple changes:

I used pickle juice instead of buttermilk (didn't have it) to marinate the chicken, I didn't add any hot sauce, and I forgot to add the ranch mix to the marinade so I split it between the wet and dry coating.

I was most impressed by the crunchiness of the batter! I have a go-to Chic-Fil-A copycat recipe that possibly has a slightly better flavor, due to the addition of a TB of powdered sugar in the dry batter, but it does not achieve the crust that you'll get with this recipe. 

I really liked the flavor! I definitely recommend marinating your chicken overnight or as long as you can before cooking.

This had a breading that was similar to a cross between a Mc chicken sandwich and a Chick-fil-A sandwich. I highly recommend you only use one chicken breast to make two sandwiches. If you prefer the bun a Chick-fil-A sandwich comes on, you really need to use brioche buns and be sure to toast it before assembling your sandwich. Do not be afraid to add the cayenne pepper to your breading. it doesn’t really add any heat, just flavor. I also added hot sauce to mayo. At 40 years old, this is the first fried chicken I have ever successfully made. It is super easy if you follow the recipe. Good luck and Enjoy!!

So first off I used a breast that was WAY to thick which made for some very raw chicken in the center, this meant I had to throw it into the oil for a second round. Beyond my own personal failings I actually found the breading itself to be rather basic, not terrible, not great. I generally don’t enjoy frying things since hot oil scares me so needless to say, given all that this won’t be one of the Chef’s recipes I go back to. (Luckily there are plenty of others I love to cook over and over!)
