This is a very tasty way to cook pork chops!  The potatoes add a nice touch.  Quite spicy.

We found this recipe had way too much seasoning.  The flavors over-powered the potaotes and pork.  Would use half the taco flavoring mix and half the salsa.

The cook time needs to be longer for the potatoes.
