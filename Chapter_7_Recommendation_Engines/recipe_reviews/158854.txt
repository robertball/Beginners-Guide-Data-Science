**IMPORTANT NOTE** Thanks to everyone who has tried this recipe!  After reading all of the comments I think it is important to note that there can be a BIG difference between the "asian" store and "american" store version of your ingredients.   I know that most american versions of soy sauce have a lot more salt, so I am assuming the american version of oyster sauce is also a bit different.  We only use the asian store version for all of our ingredients, which is pretty close, if not sometimes the same brand, that they use in the restaurants.  So if it didn't turn out for you the first time, try making a stop into your local asian grocer and try again :)  ** And for some reason allrecipes changed my cooking instructions, but you do want to turn down down the heat a little once you add in the sauces to prevent burning and my beans actually take closer to 10 mins to cook to my desired tenderness. **

oh these were so delicious!  the only problem i had was that my oyster sauce was cold from having already been opened and stored in the fridge, and when it hit the wok it sort of congealed into some lumps instead of mixing well and creating a sauce, but that was my fault not the recipe's.  also, i used regular vegetable oil because that was all i had and i didn't notice any missing flavor not having peanut oil.  these tasted just like chinese buffet green beans!  yum!

Thank you Roweena!!!!   Loved this recipe!   For years, my family also made a Bee-line for the green beans at the Chinese Buffet - we could have made a meal on the beans alone.    Now, I can make them simply and easily right at home any time I want.   I used haricot vert green beans found at Sam's, and I did blanch them in boiling water for 3 minutes before sauting them.    I was also unsure of the oyster sauce, so I cut back a bit on that, but next time, I'll use the full amount the recipe calls for...  so good, so good!

yummy with a few tweaks (i'm used to certain green beans from yang chow in LA, CA).  fresh green beans - steamed them till tender first and set aside (since cooking them with the garlic tends to make the garlic burn by the time the beans are good).  then sauteed minced garlic and ~1.5 teaspoons of fresh grated ginger. instead used 2 tb of soy and 1-2 tsp of oyster sauce.

While these weren't the prettiest green beans I've ever made, they sure were one of the tastiest!  Such great flavor! I didn't add the sugar and don't regret it.  I added fresh minced garlic and am glad I did.  The oyster and soy sauces give these a dark brown coating which doesn't make them the most attractive (plus I overcooked mine) but I'll call these green beans one good "ugly duckling!"

These were okay but the flavors didn't stand out. We also thought that they were way too sweet. I may try again and leave the sugar out.

I have made similar green bean recipes before using only soy sauce but they never seemed just "right."  The oyster sauce is the real key!  This is an excellent side dish.

Great flavor - I followed the recipe exactly except to mix some sesame oil in with the peanut oil.  The sauce is so tasty and you could add more veggies of your liking.  A versatile recipe for sure.

I love this recipe, fast and really tasty. I made some alterations: used 4 gloves of garlic, 1 teasp of sugar, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. First I steamed the fresh beans for 7 minutes and then used only half the sesame oil to saute the garlic. Added the beans, let them cook for 5 minutes then added the sauce and it was done in another 5 minutes. Also having the sauce mixed up and sitting is a good way to prevent ingredients from burning or clumping.

Usually the beans on the buffet are my favorite- these are not as good as the Chinese Buffet. Sugar was easy to burn. Next time will try steaming beans a little before adding sauce.

Tried this recipe tonight and loved it. The changes I will make next time are cooking the beans (covered) on low for 10-15 minutes (maybe even longer, as I like them fairly limp) and adding the oyster/soy sauce at the end of the cooking process, as the sauce ending up overcooking and most of it was left on the sides of the pan. The sauce needs to be added last and beans stirred and cooked to saturate then removed and ready to serve. I also will eliminate the sugar, as really not needed. I give it a 5 stars, as it was very good even with the initial problems with the sauce. I know to make the change next time! Thanks for this recipe!

I chose to use sesame oil and I used low sodium soy sauce. I tossed in 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper and two tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds before serving. Huge hit--we loved it! NO leftovers.

We enjoyed this.  I left out the sugar. Oyster sauce has sugar in it, anyhow.  I added Japanese eggplant, sliced into rounds, then halved.  They soaked up the sauce and were quite flavorful.

Yum!  I used a bag of frozen steamable green beans (not in season) and microwaved them for only half the time as recommended on the package, then finished them on the stove with the sauce.  Delicious!

I will use a little less sugar next time, but this is a great start for me to adapt it to fit my own tastes. I'm sure every buffet makes them slightly differently! Info for vegetarians/vegans or those allergic to shellfish: there is a vegetarian oyster sauce that contains no oysters, I find it at my local Asian market,

I made these for my husband and they tasted just like the green beans at the Chinese buffet. I am now going to make them for Thanksgiving. No more green bean casserole for me!!

I think the beans need to be blanched for a few minutes to get the proper doneness without burning the garlic. I also doubled the garlic and added a little chili paste to the sauce. You should mix the sugar, oyster sauce and soy sauce before adding or the sugar could burn.

Per hubby: "These are the best green beans I've ever had."  And he is not one for dramatic reviews.  The first time I made these, I followed the directions exactly.  I found that even on low heat the garlic slices burned before I was done cooking the beans.  The second time I made it, I didn't pre-cook the garlic at all, just threw the beans and garlic in together and it turned out great.

As written pretty good but I added a couple of things to make them more like the green beans at the local buffet.  Definitely use the sugar, it cuts the saltiness.  I also added a couple splashes of white wine and balsamic vinegar.  It makes them delish!!

Made these by pretty much following the recipe.  I used half peanut and half sesame oil, and only cooked the garlic until it became fragrant, then added the beans.  I didn't want the garlic to scorch.  I used "lite" soy sauce, and made no other changes to the ingredients.  I kept stirring until the sauce reduced and became a glaze.  We liked these, and I will add sesame seeds next time.

I am in love with the Buffet type green beans and have tried on my own to duplicate them with no luck - until now - with this recipe!  The family loved this one and it'll be a keeper in my household!

I was so excited to find this recipe, since it is one of my favorites on the buffet as well!  I made this recipe with fresh haricot vert (french green beans) and half the sugar and it was devine!!!  Thank you for bringing this wonderful, low calorie comfort food to my kitchen!

My 3 year old twins hate veggies, but, they loved this! I blanched the green beans for about 4 minutes first. I added 2 cloves sliced garlic,  added 1.5 teaspoons of minced ginger, used 2 Tbs soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of the oyster sauce. I left out the sugar, it really didn't need it. Yumm!

This is my husband's favorite veggie...he requests them often. Last night I made 1/2 a pound of beans (kept the rest of the recipe as is) and added some sliced up left over chicken. It was delish!!!

I had to cut back on the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil for the called-for 1 lb. fresh green beans.  I gently suggest using the ingredients listed for 2 to 2 1/2 lbs. fresh green beans.  One tablespoon of sesame oil was WAY too much for my one lb. of beans. Also, was very salty with both the soy and oyster sauces in amts. listed.  I tried the recipe again with 1/2 tsp. Splenda for baking, 1 Tbl.spoon oyster sauce, 1/4 tsp. sesame oil and no soy sauce for 1 lb. green beans; left the garlic as listed in recipe, and this turned out really well.  My husband says to use 2 lbs. beans and leave the recipe as is, except maybe decrease the sesame oil, which is really strong. Will keep using this recipe, Thanks, Roweena.

I love this dish but took the liberty of adding chicken to it so I can eat it as a complete meal.  Simple to make and definitely a winner in my book.

Really Easy. Family really liked.  Did have to be really careful with the garlic so that it didn't burn -- I added about 2 tablespoons water to the beans after about 2 minutes of stirfrying to speed up cooking without burning the garlic

Love it! Doubled everything except the green beans & added a pkg. of cubed tofu. It's a one pan, low carb, high protein dinner! Can't beat that. Might go heavier on the garlic next time.

Wonderful ecipe, although I am doing what normally irks me and am rating it based on a few modifications I made. I cooked the beans in the microwave until just crisp and then stir fried them until some of them were browned. I also added a lot of siricha!

These were very good as written but if you add 1TBS of sesame oil and sesame seed at the last minute of cooking, it makes the world of difference.

These were good, although I am still searching for a recipe that tastes like Chinese Buffet green beans. These don't but they were tasty. I added black pepper and sesame seeds. I think next time I'll add in some green onion too.

We eat a lot of green beans, so I'm always looking for new ways to serve them.  I've made this recipe a number of times, as written and with some tweaks.  It is delicious as written, but I find the oyster sauce a little too strong (you get a bit of a "fishy" aftertaste).  I prefer to swap the amounts of soy sauce and oyster sauce, but that's just my personal preference.  Either way, these are delicious green beans!

I loved this recipe however, I tweaked it a bit to meet my family's needs.  I did not use the oyster sauce and I did not add the garlic until the green beans were fried and tender.  Adding the garlic too early, causes it to burn.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I liked these quite well. Just as it reads they were 'Chinese Buffet'. I only used 2 teaspoons of sugar, that was plenty. I like mine on the soft side so I turned down the heat after getting them browned, covered them and let them steam for about 10 min.

I made these for company and felt that there was a bit too much soy/sauce.  It seemed to overpower the green beans.  However, my company complimented them and had second helpings.

These are perfect!   I had to give up Chinese take out since I had a terrible headache last time and suspect msg/high salt content.  These are perfect and I used canola oil instead of peanut and I blanched the beans before as another reviewer recommended.  Thanks for sharing.

I have been trying to figure out how to duplicate the beans on our local Chinese buffets and this is it!  I used hericot vert from Costco, which I blanched for a few minutes before starting this recipe.  I didn't measure anything as I was just making enough for myself.  I added some red pepper flakes and used sesame oil for the saute.  Excellent!  Thanks!

This made a lovely side dish at Thanksgiving.  I also added some slivered blanched almonds - because I had them on hand, and it seemed like a good idea.  What I really like is that I was able to cook them up and keep them warm while we served the salad course, and they did not go limp or soggy.

This one is the real deal, folks!  The only things I did differently is used chopped garlic rather than slices.  I added the chopped garlic midway into the cooking time so it wouldn't brown too much.  Because I didn't have oyster sauce, I used fish sauce and it works just as well.  This is wonderful and I fully intend to continue making these beans.  Thanks for sharing!

I left off the sugar, used Asian ingredients as the poster mentioned. I also stir-fried some slivered almonds in the peanut oil first, and added several drops of sesame oil. Next time I might fine-dice some onion as well. Thanks so much, this was just perfect with my honey-garlic wings.

Very good!  I sauteed the beans (with added julienned carrots and peppers) first and then added the garlic (and some fresh ginger) 1/2 way through so it wouldn't burn - it turned out great.  Be careful not to overcook the beans, cook until almost done but still firm and then add the sauce, they will soften even more in the sauce.  I will use less sauce next time, but that's just a personal preference.

I gave 2 stars only because this was KIND OF close to buffet beans.......The flavor just wasn't there.  Our local buffet actually flash FRIES the beans first...then "dresses" them with a sauce......

My husband and I were not huge fans. Just a note of caution, oyster sauce is a very distinct flavor. I think that is why we really did not like it much. To us, you could really taste it in this dishTo us, it was like the chinese green beans we have had in restaurants.

I recommend picking up "Black" soy sauce, if you're headed to a the Asian market. It's more flavor less salt.
Oyster sauce, black soy and sugar also will work great on big flat rice noodles if you like "Thai Drunken Noodles"

This dish is so easy to make, it isn't necessary to go out. Stay home and enjoy. It's the first dish I go to when at an Asian Buffet (which isn't very often). Tastes just as good with cut green beans.

This was really tasty! I used low sodium soy sauce.  I gave it 4 stars because I think the cooking method didn't do the beans any favors. It made the beans dark, and they were just a little too crunchy. I think next time I'll mostly cook the beans first, sauté the the garlic, then add the cooked beans and the sauce to the pan just before I take it out if the pan.

These green beans taste almost exactly like the Chinese buffet, only a little sweeter. I think 1 tablespoon is a bit much for the sugar. Next time, I will try a teaspoon instead. I also used the low-sodium soy sauce, and cooked the green beans first, putting in the garlic later.

These are the ultimate green beans. An exact replica of the ones from the Chinese buffet I go to. I think the sauce could even be used for other things. I lve them. Thank u for sharing.

very easy to make, truly tasted like buffet ones.  I used chopped garlic and it worked nice.  Also I used peanut oil because that is what I had on hand.  The kids were thrilled for green beans.

Nice green beans.  I put in huge slices of garlic and added more, which made me happy since I like garlic.  I thought the sauce was a bit too much; lightly coated would have been a bit better, but I did find it good.  I thought I had oyster sauce but when I went to put it in I couldn't find it so I used half fish sauce and half teriyaki instead.  Not sure if it's the same, but I enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! I only got a few thought cuz my husband ate the whole pan! I minced the garlic instead of slicing, otherwise used all ingredients and measurements the same. Next time I will try it with low sodium soy just because it was a tiny bit salty.

These things are addictive.  I think the salty sweetness of the oyster sauce is what does it for me.  I may try subbing the oyster for hoisin just to see how that pans out, but seriously - this recipe is just perfect.. a great way to give a kick to boring beans.

I didn't care a lot for the strong flavor of the oyster sauce, so next time I would either omit it entirely or halve it.  Although it did smack of Chinese buffet green beans, there was way too much sauce and way too much sugar.  With tweaks I think this could be pretty darn close.   My biggest disappointment was trying to use "fresh" green beans (which are not in season right now).  The beans themselves were inedible, so this rating is based solely on the flavor of the sauce.

My husband and I really enjoyed these. I took the advice of another reviewer and blanched the veggies first (I used some sliced green pepper in addition to some green beans since I did not have that many green beans.). I also left out the oyster sauce (don't like). Thanks for a yummy side dish! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I used CANNED because thats what I had.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh.  Reduced the sauces to one TBSP each and omitted the oil (strain the liquid from the beans before cooking) I pan fried to heat thoroughly and diminish some of the liquid.  It was very good, and i can't wait to try with fresh beans!

Added about 6 sliced garlic cloves to canola oil with a splash of seasame oil.  Added the green beans.  They were done after about 2 minutes.  Then added the sauces, for another 2 minutes.  The garlic cloves got burnt but everyone loved them.

I loved this...very tasty sauce.  I used 1/2 tsp Splenda instead of sugar.  I used frozen green beans and they were great, but fresh would, of course, be best.  I used low sodium soy sauce and they didn't seem too salty to me.  We loved them and I'll definitely make them again.

This is good - I left out the sugar and I did not miss it.  If I decide to add sugar the next time I make this, it definately will not be the amount called for in the recipes - this would make my vegetables too sweet for me.  I added onions and mushrooms to the green beans as well.  I did not have peasnut or sesame oil, so I sauteed using Pam Olive Oil spray and it worked just fine.

Turned out great--my relatives love this! If you're going to use a sugar substitute (I was cooking for diabetics), remember to decrease the amount of Splenda/Equal to avoid the funny aftertaste.

Made this for the first time, and made changes per other reviewers and reduced the sugar, traded the amount of soy sauce with the amount of oyster sauce, doubled the amount of pepper flakes because it didn't taste spicy enough for me. Then even added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper because it was still not spicy enough. Also, because I did not have fresh green beans and decided to make this at the last minute, I used canned beans. This just did not work for me. Not sure that I feel like it would taste any better with ingredients as listed. So bummed because the buffet green beans are my favorite!

Very good!  I cooked my beans in boiling water for about 4 minutes prior to adding to skillet, just because I like a tender bean. I am not one for measuring so I just sprinkled the sugar and eyeballed the rest. I had to use fish sauce in place of oyster sauce. Wasn't sure how it would work out, but it did. Thanks for the recipe

We made this to accompany miso-glazed salmon for Christmas dinner.  We made no changes, and everybody raved!

Easy and tasty recipe. My daughter loves it and calls it delish green beans and could eat them as the main dish.

Sweet was the first impression. That tablespoon sugar probably isn't needed to be sweet enough.  Maybe without it, the green beans would have an asian flavor.

These were good but not great. We had a competition between these and another fried green beans I make. (to decide which to serve at a dinner) These lost.

Very tasty, I would just flash steam the green beans before sauteing them as they were too raw/crunchy for my taste. It wouldn't hurt to double the sauce either because it was that delicious!

These green beans are so tasty! I had to tweak the directions though. I don't believe in burning garlic so I put that in last. First, I throw in the green beans and cover the pan with a lid (foil works too). Then after several minutes and a couple times stirring within those minutes, I throw in the sauce.

this came out awesome!  bf made it.. and in his own words.. this was so simple that he couldn't even mess it up.. he used half water and half soy sauce b/c we didn't have light soy.. we were out of fresh garlic so he had to use the jarred stuff and it still tasted amazing.. ty so much for the recipe!

I didn't have peanut oil, so I used olive oil. 
Tasted just as good as the buffets green beans.

Easy and delicious. I made it ahead of time to reheat for dinner so I only cooked the beans for an extra 4 minutes after adding the sauce ingredients. It reheated perfectly!

This is very much like the Chinese restaurant. A bit salty so either we will use more beans or less oyster sauce next time.

Not exactly like the Chinese Buffet's but I think it could be with some tweaking.  I've made these once & agree with other reviewers in saying that 2 tbsp's of Oyster sauce is too much.  I would recommend using half of what it calls for, adding more garlic & less sugar.  Could barely taste the garlic with just 2 cloves.  I also, as other reviewers have, to add garlic after green beans have cooked a little as the garlic will scorch if you put it in the pan first.

These were okay. I was a little hesitant about making the green beans and flavoring them with 2 Tblsp of oyster sauce. It is very strong and I thought it was the dominant flavor in these. The cook time was accurate except it didn't say how long to cook after adding the flavorings. I had to add about 10 minutes. Even if one likes the flavor of oyster sauce, it does create a dark glaze on them. So, don't expect perfect looking beans. They are slightly familiar to Asian buffet green beans, but something seems to be missing. Despite, not being exactly what I wanted, I was greatful for the low calorie count.

YUM! I made it just as written and it was so good - except for the fact that it was quite salty. Next time I'll cut the soy and oyster sauces in half.. or maybe even dilute the sauce in some water.

These are SOOO good!  Just like the ones I get at my favorite restaurant here in town.  I did use frozen beans and they turned out great!

Great taste but they took much longer to cook to my desired preference and the sauce then got kind of gooey. I kept having to add more water. In the end it was worth all the work, but I'll need to find a better method to making them.

These were really good. I have made them 2x now, and the second time I added a bunch of sliced, fresh mushrooms. Delicious!

These were pretty good! My mom commented that they were a little too salty, so next time I might cut back on the oyster sauce. I might add more garlic next time as well.Very well received overall!

Excellent recipe!  It is now one of our very favorite vegetable recipes!  I left out the white sugar, and I used garlic powder (was out of fresh garlic).  I was so anxious to try this recipe, and the first time all I had was frozen green beans, and it was still excellent.  After that, I have used fresh, but I think it was just as good with the frozen.  Thanks so much for this very tasty recipe!

My daughter who is 2 only eats these at Chinese Restaurants, so I was excited to find this recipe.  I did not have Oyster sauce, so I used a lil Hoisin and Fish.  They taste great!!!  I am tasting the garlic alot now.  I grated mine on a micro planer, I should have just sliced like called for!!  But yea VERY YUMMY!  Very kind to share this recipe, now instead of canning all our green beans next summer I will freeze some for this dish!

I thought this recipe was wonderful. My husband is asian and he enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly using evaporated cane juice instead of regular table sugar (almost the same thing). I cook for a group home and they were pleased. An easy and tasty side dish.

I made the recipe as described.  Way too salty and I'm the type of guy that is always reaching for the salt shaker.  My wife and I found ourselves avoiding the sauce.  Next time I will try the oyster sauce on it's own and maybe even add a bit of water to thin it out.  Soy sauce is simply not needed as the oyster sauce already has enough salt.

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. The beans were not flavorful at all. I had to add a lot of extra salt and oyster sauce to get any flavor at all. Not recommended.

Awesome!  I used Chinese long beans that you normally see at Chinese restaurants instead of regular green beans.  This would recipe would also be good for sauteed mushrooms.

I made this but accidentally grabbed the hoisin sauce and added some of that before realizing my mistake. I added the oyster sauce & reduced sodium soy, but omitted the sugar. It was delicious and didn't have any extra to take for lunch the next day.

This is THEE BEST green bean buffet style recipe I've EVER had. I didn't change a thing except made a double batch. Because they are just that good!!!  Everyone loves them. A single batch isn't enough for the people lol. I like these better than the actual ones at my local restaurant. It seems they used to make them this way but the flavor just isn't there anymore. Don't know what they cut out but that's OK cuz now I can make them anytime.

I started making this version of green beans about 2 years ago. Since then, it always asked for when I have the kids over for dinner.  They eat it cold as well. They say it's as addictive as french fries.  Family favourite.

I used a ginger soy sauce.

I would mince the garlic versus slicing it thin because  it can stick to wok or skillet.

I would suggest to NOT use sesame oil. Sesame has a high burn rate and should be used as a flavouring at the end like a drizzle. Use Peanut or Vegetable oil (for nut allergies).

I love the taste of oyster sauce with the ginger soy and I think I may use it as a  glaze  for chicken breast or wings.

I would also add sliced almonds for a garnish.

I would like to try a "salt n pepper " or a more garlicky taste.

I doubled the sauce to ensure I had enough and I wouldn't change a thing (except making sure we have whole beans instead of French style). We will be having them again and I may experiment with broccoli and other veggies. Thank you!

I actually made this with frozen green beans due to time.  I sauteed them in a very hot skillet.  It took a bit longer since they were frozen, and of course they weren't crunchy.  But the flavor was spot on from my favorite Chinese restaurant.

I liked it enough to try it again. But it definitely wasn’t the Chinese buffet taste that I was hoping for. Also, I would try adding the garlic a few minutes after I add the beans. By the time the beans were done my garlic was basically burnt to a crisp.

I have made these several times and they are the closest in taste to the Chinese buffet recipe hands down! Thanks for sharing, I had hunted a long time before finding your recipe! Now I'm on the hunt for the creamy seafood dish(imitation crab)on the buffet. lol

#1 100% Garlic WILL burn and become bitter.
#2 Blanch the beans first or they will take 15 minutes to soften.
#3 Oyster sauce WILL burn with the added sugar.

Most 4+ star reviews talk about all the things they had to change in order for the recipe to actually work. If it doesnt work as written, don't give it 4+ stars.

A hit!  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions;  I used avocado oil and added cashews.  No leftovers at our house!

love this type of green beans always had them when i went out to eat. Now I make them at home all the time and they go faster than I can put it out on the table I tweaked it a little bit here and a little bit there to my tastes with the ingredients.  it’s perfect.

Used minced garlic. No oyster sauce. Used olive oil and stir-fry oil. A bit of soy sauce and some teriyaki.

I made this recipe 3 times as written and it just does not work.  I found it impossible to cook the beans to tenderness in a skillet. Instead on the 4th attempt I blanched 1 2/3 # in the microwave with a bit of water in a covered casserole,  for 12 minutes. I then followed the directions only omitting the sugar.  This time they were excellent!

Delicious and fast recipe. The only thing I did differently was I added the lid of the walk at the end to let the steam soften the green beans a bit more.  The family loved it!

Used only 1 t. sugar, but after steaming the beans for 5 minutes in the microwave, it still took a LOT longer than 10 minutes to get passed the raw, green taste.  May use more sauce next time.

Yum! I can’t say that I’ve ever had Chinese buffet green beans before, but will certainly try them if I ever go to one. I was just looking for a new way to make green beans and these were a huge hit. I used minced garlic since that is what I had on-hand but since I will make again, I’ll try sliced garlic next time as that is what was recommended. I’m glad one reviewer called out the issue with cold oyster sauce, so I know to warm it up before adding to the pan. UPDATE:  The next time I made these, I boiled the green beans for 5 min first then fried them for 5 min as instructed and they were more to our familiy’s liking. Also, since the oyster sauce was cold, I measured out 2 tbls and mixed in 1 tbls of soy sauce and let come to room temperature so it would not congeal when it hit the hot pan. Sliced up 4 garlic cloves which I added during the last 30 seconds so it wouldn’t burn and It was perfection. This will now be in the regular rotation for dinner.

Tasted very good, except most of my garlic slices were burnt by the time the green beans were tender. The next time I make this,  I will remove the garlic before adding the beans and add them back in with the sauce mixture,

I parboiled my green beans first to speed the cooking process later, but wish I hadn't as they were watery in the center when you bit into them. The flavor on this was so good that my husband, who never eats the stir fry green beans, said how good they were and went back for seconds. I cooked this with vegetable oil but added a splash of sesame oil and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds at the end. I used chopped garlic from the jar and Kimlan Sang Chau light soy sauce. I even happened to have the oyster sauce on hand and hesitated as the thought didn't sound appealing to me as a non seafood eater, but I am glad I added it anyway as this turned out so well. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This came no where close to being the green beans on our 3 local Chinese buffet places. BUT!! That turned out to be a good thing. Hubby and two of our 3 kids do not like the buffet green beans and yet they all 3 made not one, not two but 3 trips to the kitchen for LARGE amounts of this recipe of green beans. Hubby even took the print out of the recipe and put it on the side of the frig. for me to make again and again. The soy sauce and oyster sauce made a nice combination flavor.

I had some of these at Agogo and is my new fav. I used can green beans as I did not have fresh. The sauce was the saving grace for these sinner canned beans. I ate the whole can and repented later. I would still use agan. Toasted sesame seeds on top was very good.

I made this per recipe and they were very good. If you find they are sweeter than you like just leave out the sugar. Second time I made these I used sweet soy sauce and "toasted" sesame  (or use Tamari) (and no sugar) a little pepper and a little green onion .. fantastic. I now also put together the sauce ingredients and simmer a bit and pour this over other veggies LOVE it! Thank You for this recipe!

This recipe was delicious and was just what I was looking for. I included them in our Christmas dinner and everyone loved them.  I did add an extra 1 - 2 cloves of garlic.  Also, I blanched the beans by boiling them for about 3 minutes, shocked them in cold water/ice bath, then let them thoroughly drain.  (They probably could have used another 2 minutes in the boiling water.)  When I added the beans to the sauce mix in the wok, they only needed to be heated.  Still, it took a while to get them hot.   Next time, I might pop the beans in the microwave for a minute to get them hot and then add them to the sauce.  Will make again!

First time using a wok and an inexperienced cook but they came out great.  After 10 minutes the beans were still crunchier than I like (maybe didn't have wok hot enough) so I put them in the microwave for 6 minutes on high and they were perfect.  Used a bit more soy than called for, and a bit less sugar.  Thinking of trying again using same sauce but with broccoli instead of green beans.  Also will try with canned beans as a time saver.  Thanks for posting, Roweena.

My family and I really liked these beans. I  used the sesame oil instead of the peanut oil, mixed minced garlic with the sauces, used dark brown sugar instead of white and cut the amount of sugar in half.  Delicious! I'll definitely be making these again.

Very good and an excuse to use my electric wok that I've had sitting on a shelf for more than a few years.  The beans didn't exactly taste like the ones in my favorite Chinese restaurant but they were still great.  Next

I omit the sugar. Place the green beans on a non-stick baking sheet. I mix the oil, sauces, and garlic together, then drizzle them over the green beans. Bake at 350 degrees until they reach the desired degree of doneness. My family loves them!

I know I have been looking for a recipe like this for a while now. Oh my god they were so good. I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I did differently was to add sliced almonds just before I send them for an extra little crunch. My family loved them. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe

Did not add all the sugar called for....maybe 2 tsp. due to trying to watch sugar intake.  Got busy and didn't taste until it was on our plates.  WAY to salty.  Totally my fault....but be aware.  :)

The beans just wouldn't soften.  I tried adding a tablespoon of water a few times but wound up throwing out a half pound of beans.  I have tried making Chinese style green beans before & also had no luck.  I will cook the rest of beans my usual way.  Perhaps the beans are the problem.

I made this dish for my family to with pork chops.  We loved it and the only change I made was to steam the green beans a bit before adding them to the pan.

I have been making stir fry beens for some time.  Very similar to these. Instead of sugar I use sweet chilly sauce which just loves oyster sauce. And if you have a decent Asian store buy some snake beans, they are just fabulous. And if you still want a bit more zang , try  a dash oh fish sauce and/or some freshly ground pepper. This recipe will work on most greens. And honestly the prep really only takes 5 mins. Truly.

These were fantastic.  Green beans are out of season so I used the frozen stream in the bag ones.  Heated them according to directions and threw them in a pan with the sauce for about ten minutes.

Boil the green beans (I did 2lbs) for 3 minutes and drain. Add a little oil to your pan and a few spoons of butter , saute the garlic (I did 6 cloves,  minced) in butter for 20 seconds.  Add the green beans and when you're ready,  add your premixed sauce.  One tablespoon of sugar was enough for my 2lbs of beans.  It tastes great!

My son said these are the best green beans I've ever made! I'm not sure I agree, but they are definitely delicious. I didn't have oyster sauce so I used more soy sauce. I also cut the sugar in half - no more is needed. We'll be making these again.

I noticed that adding the garlic after the green beans have been cooking for a few minutes kept the garlic from burning which  improved the taste and I also tried using teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce and oyster sauce for a different flavor. Either way the recipe was delicious! Thank you.

I followed the recipe as written.  Best green beans I have ever had. Cook to your firmness as recipe states. I cook ~5 min. longer, cover, & remove from heat. Better, than any I have gotten at any Asian restaurant . I started cooking them every week.  Also snack on them at night.

We love green beans made this way, I used sesame oil which I feel is the best as it is so fragrant. I omitted the sugar and used ketjap manis for the oyster sauce because of allergies.

Rave reviews.  Even my non-veggie eater loved them.  Used frozen beans and added a little ginger.  Cooked with onion and it turned out great.  Update:  Made exactly by recipe and still liked by everyone.  I see people talking about chili flakes.  Where did that come from?  I didn't see it in the recipe, and personally I am tired of everyone wanting to put heat into everything, especially comfort food.  If you want everything hot, do it for yourself, but do not rate a recipe on it"s absence

Needed longer in the sauce to infuse the flavour.  Love the taste though.   To make it kid friendly I left out the chili flakes.

Very good flavor, but you have to stir constantly so it doesn't burn. Great side dish if you can spend the time tending to it.

This recipe is awesome! Even my toddlers love it! In order to cook green beens faster, I cook them in a microwave for several minutes first, then cook them according to the recipe.

mmmmm- these were really good! I used honey instead of sugar, along with the oyster and soy sauce.....it took longer to stir fry the fresh green beans than I thought it would- so I added a Tb. of water to the pan w/ beans and (olive) oil...cooked about 8 minutes, then added the sauce for about 3 minutes.....I also added diced cooked pork tenderloin and then served over a mix of brown and wild rice....very good! I will make these again!

Recipe was very easy to follow and doesn't take long to prepare...It just wasn't as tasty...

My husband is an avid bean eater and he did eat them and they did had a good taste...

I used the sesame oil as I couldn't find the peanut oil...Not sure if that made a difference or not..

I made these green beans last night.  I thought they were awesome.  I think I would use a little less sugar, but I would make them every day.  I did toast some peanuts and add them and that was fantastic. We threw it over brown rice.  It's a winner!!

I agree with the other reviewers - the garlic will burn if you put it in before the green beans without steaming them. The flavors are excellent though.

These were very good as printed.  The next time I made them, I sprinkled some sesame seeds on the top and that made them even better. I've used the sauce with already cooked beans too, with a slightly different cooking method -- I browned the garlic as suggested, poured in the sauce, stirring constantly, brought it to a boil, then turned in the well-drained cooked beans, stirring constantly until they were coated and hot.  The sauce makes a nice glaze.  I am tempted to try it on broccoli florets, with water chestnuts, and maybe on carrots

I love how simple this recipe is, it's great.

While cooking many people get mixed up with the idea that tasty cooking needs to be complex. That's definitely not true, and this recipe is a good example of that.

My three year old scarfs up these green beans and finishes off whatever's left in the serving bowl.  We don't get oyster sauce here, so I substitute a "mushroom soy sauce" instead.  I'm assuming that oyster sauce is made from oyster mushrooms... We keep minced garlic in oil in the fridge ready to go, so we never use the thin slices as called for, it's still delicious.

Both DH and I could not get enough of this and ended up eating it way before the rest of the dinner was ready! Thank you so much! I'm a huge fan of green beans when we go out to get some Chinese, and I always wondered how hard they are to make! Love it, love it, and love it some more!

Wonderful recipe! I used Splenda instead of regular sugar and next time I'll cut back a little on it since sugar replacements seem to be a bit sweeter, but that was definitely my fault. We'll have this again soon - thanks for the recipe!

Wow - I love any recipe that makes my entire family happy, and this one fit the bill!  We tend to like our green beans a little softer than the ones you get in Chinese restaurants, so I boiled them for a bit before sautéing them.  I also omitted the soy sauce since some reviewers complained about the saltiness.  They beans turned out perfectly for us!

This is an excellent recipe. A very different flavor with the oyster sauce, but delicious. I also toss honey roasted peanuts on top of this which sweetens it up. My fiance adores these beans. He says they're like candy.

This is the way I have been cooking green beans in this style for a long time. The only thing different is that I put a little leftover small diced pork, I've sauteed till brown, with the sauce. YUM! Thank you!

I liked it, it took a little while to get them to soften up but they were very tasty.
