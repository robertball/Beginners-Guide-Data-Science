Used less wht flour added brown rice flour and more oatmeal. I also used a full banana instead. Little extra milk needed not much.used a little less brown sugar too.

Toddlers I have LOVE it and asked for it again

We used 2% for milk and works.

Second round we add a few chocolate chips and it was like cookies

texture -- horrible (doughy - no matter how long you cook it for),  taste - ok
