An old familiar favorite. I leave out the celery and add a few teaspoons of sugar to the dressing. Sweet but good and a nice way to get some more veggies in the diet.

I think this recipe is better with Miracle Whip than mayonaise.

I took everyone's suggestion and added a small amount of crushed pineapple.  I also added a little salt and pepper and some cajon spices for a little kick.

Purchased a bag of shredded carrots.  Diced the celery in my mini processor.  Combined the 1/3 c light mayo, vinegar and 1/3 c Splenda.  Mixed all ingredients together.  Without the Splenda, it wasn't sweet enough for me.  With modifications, I will make again.  Thanks.

Made this for Christmas Day - used food processor to shred the carrots, put it all together and per my boyfriend, tasted just like his mom used to make which is a great compliment because she was a great cook! Lasts well in refrigerator. If you like carrots & raisins, try this - you'll be glad you did.

My mother used to make this salad, and I had kind of forgotten about making it for myself until I saw it here.  Not a big fan of celery, so used a chopped Braeburn apple instead.  I tossed the carrots and apple with lemon juice to keep the color bright before adding the dressing that I thinned with a little milk.  A colorful, healthy, and tasty salad that's easy to put together...

I thought this was a nice light salad. I loved the raisins in it. My kids didn't like it at all. It was too sweet for them. I would make again, but for the grown ups.

This was a really great side salad, just like I remember my mother making it. I did add a teaspoon of white sugar to make it a bit sweeter as when I tasted it the first time it was a bit bitter. However, the recipe was enjoyed by everyone and I will be making it again.

Great salad!  I made a few changes.  I followed others recommendations and put in a can of crushed pineapple and then I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped pistachios for some extra crunch.  It will be on my Thanksgiving table this evening.

I added about two teaspoons splenda, a little fresh cilantro and some pepitas, which gave the salad a great texture!! I used seasoned vinegar rather than plain, and left out celery...tasted great!

This salad was a nice change. I substituted crushed pineapple for the celery (didn't have any) and used low fat miracle whip. Nice basic recipe that's easy to prepare.

Yum - this takes me back to my childhood. This was how my mom made it - although I'm not sure about the vinegar. I knew my kids would stick up their noses if they caught any whiff of vinegar so I substituted a teaspoon or so of lemon juice. I also added a bit of milk to thin the mayo - although I like mayo I don't like it to be the overriding flavor or texture. I also added a teaspoon or so of sugar. Then I got adventurous and sprinkled some sunflower seeds over it. Loved it - thanks for the memories!

This was off the chain. Of course I had to modify as usual but it still came out good. I'm on Weight Watchers so I needed a recipie without all the fat of the mayo.
I used 7 carrots, 3 apples, 2 cups raisins, 3 tablespoons Miracle Whip Lite, 1 cup non fat plain yogurt, a dash of pineapple juice and Splenda to taste. It was wet without being overly juicy and good and crunchy. Just like my Mama's!

I think it's great to see a recipe not pumped up with extra sugar due to dietary needs.  I like it with cran raisins chopped fine and a little spice along with the salt and pepper.  Another alternative is a little apple sauce instead of sugar, that also makes a smoother salad for someone with chewing difficulties or just a boost in taste.  When adding pepper, a little nutmeg might add zing....

but over all, this is a pretty good recipe, just didnt put in rasins cause i forgot to get them at the store :-D

Nice flavour, my kids really liked it. Next time I would let it sit for a few hours to let the flavours mingle a bit.

I thought this was missing something.  There did not seem to be enough sauce for the amount of carrots, and the flavor just didn't do it for me.

Added walnuts, and pineapple. Apples would work too. No celery for me though.

Very good salad, refreshing and super easy! Added a diced apple for extra sweetness! But really good without it, as well! I''m just a sweet tooth.

This was a great recipe! My husband doesn't like celery so I left it out. I also added pineapple chunks, shredded apples and a little bit of sugar. I had to make this salad 2 days in a row...it was that good and so easy to make.

I love this recipe but no vinegar and add just a hint of red onion with the celery. Yum!
