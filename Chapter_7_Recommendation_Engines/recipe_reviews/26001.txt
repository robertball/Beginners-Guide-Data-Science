This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever made. I used milk because I didn't have any buttermilk and put the glaze on top as suggested. It's so moist and amazing. I will make this recipe often. ;)

We used to call this Dean's Sheet Cake. Lost the recipe when we remodeled our kitchen!  I always add a "glaze" of 1/2 cup butter, 6 Tbs of milk and 4-6 Tbs of cocoa.  Melt in pan on stove or microwave.  Add 3 cups powdered sugar.  Mix well by hand.  As soon as cake is out of oven, poke it all over with a toothpick.  Pour the glaze over and it will melt on the cake and dribble down those holes.  The top will shine.  Cool and cut into bars.  This seem to keep forever (if it lasts) when refrigerated. Now my new kitchen is complete.  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the recipe and baked longer in an 11x15 sheet cake pan. It came out very well - very moist and a good texture. I was skeptical because the batter is very liquidy, but there were no problems. Also added a bit of chocolate extract to the liquid ingredients for more chocolate flavor.

This was really delicious...but it turned out to be rather flat (and I can't imagine how you could feed 24 people with it). I used a 10X15 pan and it was still not very big. I must have done something incorrectly...but it was so simple and easy I can't imagine what I could have done wrong. 

Has anyone else had this issue?

Very good basic chocolate cake.  I made the recipe as is and made 2 9" round pans.  They came out the perfect size for a layer cake.

This cake tastes great, and isn't hard to make. I added chocolate chips, just because I'm a chocoholic! BUT- if you are making this cake in a jelly roll pan, do not, I repeat, DO NOT double the recipe like some of the reviewers did. (unless you want 2 cakes!)Apparently they have a deeper pan. I doubled the recipe and it filled my jelly roll pan to the brim! So then I had to pour 1/2 the batter into another pan. Good thing I had another pan!

This cake turned out great.  I doubled the recipe and used an 11 x 15" sheet cake pan.  The pan required 11 cups and this was exactly right.  It was very dense, more like a brownie.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes today and after a chocolate cupcake baking debacle yesterday, this recipe was a satisfying reminder that turning out a good cupcake is very easy so long as you begin with a good recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt but other than that I stuck to the recipe. These are moist, medium chocolate and delicious.  Period.

I made this cake in a 9x13 inch pan and it turned out very well, even though I had to bake it for almost 40 minutes. I liked the flavor but the texture was a little less moist than I would have preferred. This may of course be because I did not use the correct pan size. I will try it again with the correct pan in the future. It was a breeze to make for a "made from scratch" recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I love this easy cake..and will substitute sour milk (milk with lemon juice in it) for buttermilk and use milk instead of water and it still comes out fantastic.

Needs salt I think. The butter/oil combo is a good idea though - don't be tempted to substitute as both give different textures/flavor. As for flavor I think this could use a dash of instant coffee or sub the water for coffee to enhance the flavor otherwise it isn't that chocolately.

Made this cake yesterday and it was extremely moist and delicious.  I had to use "special dark cocoa" but it was a huge success at my boyfriend's office.  Everyone wants the recipe!!  Fantastic recipe, Beth.

This is a great recipe.  I loved that the ingredients were all things that I had on hand already.  Also the fact that it bakes in 15 minutes is amazing.  It's big enough to feed a large crowd and cools off quickly for frosting.  I made frosting following a recipe my mom had.  Here it is:

Put 10 oz. milk chocolate in food processor.  Heat 1/2 cup of whipping cream, a pinch of salt and 1 Tablespoon of corn syrup to a simmer.  Pour over chocolate and process.  Add in 1/2 cup powdered sugar and process. Slowly add in 8 tablespoons of cold butter.  Process until smooth.  

We didn't have milk chocolate so we used regular chocolate chips and it turned out great.

This cake was wonderful with that frosting.  I made it for my niece's 11 birthday party and adults and kids all loved it.

The only flavor of cake I ever make is chocolate so I have a lot of experience with various chocolate cakes.  This one is by far the WORST chocolate cake I have ever made.   I found this recipe in hopes to use it for a sheet cake for my son's first birthday.  I decided to make a smaller version before the party to test it - Thank god I did!  It has a very floury taste with a very light and non distinctive chocolate flavor.  Even with chocolate icing it didn't taste very chocolaty. It is moist which is about all it has going for it since the flavor is worse than a boxed cake.  If you love chocolate as I do.... don't make this cake!  If I could give it any less than 1 star I would.

Great, except like Jessie posted- not much batter for such a large pan unless making petite fours or a jelly roll style cake I guess.  I had to make a cake to feed 50+ for church, so I tripled this recipe and it filled the large pan (forget the size, but it is the one in the recipe) and a 9x13 pan.  I stacked the 9x13 on top of the larger and frosted with fluffy white icing.  Cake is very moist and tastes great.

My family loves this cake, it is their favorite. I've had this recipe for years but the one I have you add 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon to the cake batter and frosting. Gives it a great flavor. I also frost or glaze the cake when just removed from the oven, it makes it heavy and moist. Same recipe for the frosting as mentioned before. 1 box Powered sugar, 1 stick of margarine,6 Tablespoon milk, 4 Tablespoon Cocoa, 1 tsp.cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla  Melt and mix well margarine,coco,milk and cinnamon in sauce pan, remove from heat once margarine is melted and add vanilla and powered sugar spread on cake while hot. One cup of chopped nuts may be added to frosting if desired.

This recipe is awesome! I have made it countless times over the last year (in cake form and cupcake form), and it comes out consistently great every time! My husband and kids  absolutely LOVE it, and other people ALWAYS have positive feedback about how moist the cake is. Thank you for sharing this outstanding recipe!!!

This recipe made a moist, delicious cake. I used 1 cup of milk and 1 and 3/4 tablespoon of cream of tartar in place of the buttermilk because I didn't have any and it still turned out fantastic!

This was okay, not the best though. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, I put sweetened condensed milk in place of it. This was a very moist cake and everyone that tried it loved it and are still talking about it! Next time I will try it with the buttermilk and see how it is!

I made this with skim milk instead of buttermilk (because that was all I had) & substituted apple sauce for the oil and it turned out GREAT. Very quick and easy AND yummy.

Well,I was looking for a fast chocolate sheet cake recipe at the moment.I came upon this one and decided to try it.Our family is always trying to use sugar substitutes in our recipes.Big Mistake with this one!The cake bakes quite well and comes out very moist,I think the only mistake I made was adding the Splenda sugar substitute.Please use regular sugar.The cake came out very tasteless.but other than that it baked well and stayed moist.

Very moist and spongey - and not too sweet, even though there's 2 cups of sugar in it! I used regular milk, canola oil, and regular cocoa powder bc that's what I had in my cupboard and it was still good. It took 35 min. to bake though. I set the timer for 20 min, then checked it every 5 min until the toothpick came out clean.

This a very simple, yet good cake. I made this for my son's birthday this year, and everyone thought it was a store bought cake. And although I'm good at baking many things, birthday cakes are not my forte. This one helped me prove myself wrong :)

I made this as a birthday cake for my girlfriend. Turned out brilliant first time and made me 

popular. It's very rich and moist.

I used a small deep round tin, and baked for around an hour an a half. Finished it off with melted 

chocolate and white Malteasers. Cooked it on the Sunday, still fresh through Thursday. I cannot say 

the same for the bought cake she also had.

Very impressed with this recipe.

EXCELLENT! Yummy, moist chocolate cake! I highly suggest using FRICIA's glaze topping in reviews.  I halfed the recipe and used a 9" square dish, also didn't have buttermilk on hand, but milk seemed to work just fine. The family loved it, I will be making this again!

this cake was great.  I wanted to up the chocolate so I melted semi sweet chips with the cocoa mixture. I also added more flour as I was using this cake for a tier and need it to be more dense. It worked out wonderful.

It did flatten a little bit after taking it coming out of the oven. Tastes great, but probably won't make it again.

As a FIRST time baker (not a lover of the kitchen) this receipe was simple to follow, the baking time however, took a bit longer (by 10 mins), will have to let y'all know how it tasted! It's cooling now, I baked it for my Son's 17th b'day :) Thanks so much!

I make choco, cake cakes all the time, they all come out great.  This cake wal dry and chalky.  I'm sure some find it fine.  Perhaps If Had glaxed it and used toothpicks as suggested, it would have fine. I'm very sorry for such a sad review.  It did have a wonerful flavor.

I love this recipe!!! I did change it a little, adding some choc chips to the cocoa mixture as another reviewer suggested. I also replaced 1 quarter of a cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. It was delicious! I used buttercream frosting. I also love how big this cake is without having to use too many eggs or other, expensive ingredients. It was easy and cheap to double this recipe and make a HUGE cake for my daughters birthday party. I highly recommend it!

I made this yesterday for my family and everyone loved it.  I had to cook it for 35 min. though(that might have to do with my oven).  Instead of the white sugar I used brown sugar.  It was moist and tasty... I will for sure be making this again.

This is really a great recipe.  My 10 and 8 year old sons who love to cook make this with ease.  It really is almost like a brownie so it doesn't matter if you frost it or not.  We added a bag of mini chips to the batter at the last second last time we made it and it turned out great!

I had a chocolate craving and this cake did the trick!!! It was so easy too.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% milk and it still came out wonderfully.  I cut the recipe in half and used a 8 1/2 in. square pan.  I borrowed the idea to poke holes and pour glaze on top right out of the oven and it turned out beautifully!  We also topped each serving with some cool whip.  The family loved it - so moist and chocolately!  Will make again for sure!

This cake was very moist, and had a great texture. Only, my mind was somewhere else while I was putting it together so I accidentally grabbed the dark cocoa powder instead of the regular. As a result, it came out much darker and not as sweet, but still had a good fudgy flavor. Someone asked me if it was supposed to be  a brownie cake, and I was like, "sure, that's what it is." I frosted it with chocolate buttercream, and I used a 13x9 pan, and it was just enough, it was a success. It probably tastes better with regular cocoa, but that was my mistake. Overall very good!

This cake is AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did layers instead of a sheet cake and did have to extend the cooking time slightly, but it turned out AMAZING.  So moist and just the right amount of chocolate.

This was pretty good. A little too sweet for us though. If I made it again and I probably will- I'd decrease the sugar a bit.
