Taste is wonderful! The only reason that I gave this recipe a four star instead of five is the amount of sweet potatoes can vary. I would prefer a cup amount of sweet potato ie: 2 cups.

Okay so this is my first sweet potato pie. I decided to use one reviewer’s suggestion to use canned sweet potatoes and made two pies using a 2lb can, which I could have divided to make a single pie. However, because the canned potatoes were not hot or even warm - the ingredients didn’t combine as I had thought. So before I added the eggs - I popped the whole thing in the microwave to incorporate the milk, potatoes and spices then added the eggs and beat with my electric mixer – this made the consistency alittle smoother. Tip : I used “Apple Pie” spice – which is actually cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice combined. Also I did not have the grated orange peel so I used orange juice instead. It came wonderful and my husband loved it. Next time even if I do use canned - I will heat the potatoes up first.

This definitely is a five star recipe. We absolutely love this pie. No changes are necessary--it's perfect as is. With that said, I usually make my own pie crust for this recipe. The Butter Flaky pie crust is my go-to recipe for this pie, which is also on this site.

I made 3 pies for Thanksgiving Dinner and there were not even crumbs left!   This was my 1st time cooking a Holiday dinner for my (and my husband's) very large Louisiana family, where everyone is a great cook and a critic.  The pies were a hit and there's a request for me to make them again at Christmas.  I did alter the recipe a bit by adding ground cloves and allspice.

As is, this recipe is BLAND and not sweet at all. I'm in the South, so I would of been laughed at for serving this. So glad I tested the baked product before proceeding to the 3 pies I needed to make! I made the following adjustements: doubled the vanilla and spices and added  2 teaspoons of powdered ginger and 5 tablespoons of brown sugar-this also gave it a richer color in the end. Not a sliver was left!

I made this pie this evening and it was delicious. I have never made it before and it was very simple. However, the recipe is supposed to make 1 pie, I had enough filling for 2 pies. Luckily I had another crust on hand. I was told by others who have made this pie before to use yams instead instead of sweet potatoes. I will try that next time.

This is a wonderful pie.  We used home grown sweet potatoes and topped the pie with 1 pint sour cream plus 4 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.

Delicious! As a novice baker, I am impressed with how well my pie came out. I can't stop eating it! This is, easily, the best sweet potato pie I've ever had in my life. My edits includes: a touch more nutmeg both for the mise en place, but also to season the water for cooking potatoes (with a pinch of salt); 1/2 t. of allspice; 1/4 t. of cloves; tangerine rind instead of orange; a touch of brown sugar; and an extra splash of vanilla.

I served this pie to a group of seniors that I cook for every week at church.  They loved this pie.  It was quick and simple to make and keeps well in the frige.  I plan on making it again for another group next week.

This is a very good pie.I baked my sweet potatoes and started my baking temp at 425 degrees F for 1st 15 minutes and reduce to 350 degrees F for 35 - 40 minutes.Since making this pie several times I now use the pumpkin pie 15 oz. can as a measure or as the pumpkin pie recipe states about 2 cups. Don't leave out the orange.

A 40 oz can of "Bruce's Sweet Potatoes" netted me only 24 oz of potato by weight, the rest was water. Since I DOUBLED the recipe I needed a small can also. Btw if you cook much a small digital scale isn't very costly. I use mine often. I warmed potatoes, (minus the water of course from the can) for about 90 seconds in the microwave & mixed room temp butter with mixer until smooth. Then mixed the other ingredients. I made the filing just before bed, refrigerated in covered mixing bowl & baked it in pie shells the next morning. For those asking measurement for pound of potato I would guess its about 2 1/4 cup per pound. Using the can potato makes this a really simple pie anyone can make. Never substitute can milk for condensed milk cuz you will surely miss the sugar. I added 1/4 tea of cream of tarter cuz I just can't leave well enough alone.

This pie has been THE standard sweet potato pie in my family since the mid 80's. It has a nice smooth texture and flavor. I have substituted ginger for the nutmeg and I also use a bit of allspice for variation.

This recipe is the best! I used to make sweet potato pies with my mom when I was younger and there was always alot of guessing how it would turn out. This recipe was so easy to work with and the result was absolute perfection. My husband and I killed it quickly.

I had never made a sweet potato pie with sweetened condensed milk or orange zest, but I tried this out for Thanksgiving and we really enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe and had enough pie filling for two deep dish pie shells. I'll make it this way from now on!

This is always a hit at our house during the winter holidays. Instead of using orange juice however I add a dash of orange extract. Makes a great deep dish pie.

I have been making sweet potato pie for many years, but I was never satisfied with the result.  Sweet potato is the favorite pie of my husband and daughter-in-law.  This recipe is the best I have ever used and I made it exactly as stated.  It is not too sweet and the spices are great.  My husband said it was the best I ever made. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  The orange peel in it was perfect.  Don't leave it out.

This recipe is my all-time favorite for sweet potato pie. Of course I have a major sweet tooth so I always modify my recipes, and this was no exception. I used one large yam and one large sweet potato for the filling, and added some cinnamon, allspice, a teeny bit more orange rind, and about a tablespoon of brown sugar. I then topped it with a layer of sugar-coated pecans and a layer of mini marshmallows in the last fifteen minutes of baking. The pecans melted a bit to make a wonderful caramelized glaze while the marshmallows browned lightly and looked beautiful. It was a sensation! People still bring it up to this day, and I've been asked to make it every Thanksgiving from now on.

Ok, this is the best.  I just finished making this and am in the process of eating it now.  We are a large family and making pies is just not worth the effort seeing as how I would need to make at least 3 just for dessert so, I made it into a custard and doubled the recipe with +1/2 cup brown sugar.  Cooked at 350 in a water bath for 40-45 mins in a buttered 3qt baking dish.  The family loves it.

Very easy recipe that I am using again for the second time. The first time I did add some cloves and allspice and only used one large sweet potato. I also fixed the filling and then put it in a ziploc bag and froze it. On Thanksgiving day I thawed which didn't take long since I put it in a gallon bag and smashed thin..then I just cut off a corner of the bag and scooted it all in the pie shell...simple simple simple.

Unbelievably wonderful. The only thing I changed was adding 1 tsp. of orange extract as I didn't have any oranges in the house. My husband loved this and so did I. Rich and delicious!

Great recipe.  I took the advice of one reviewer and used a big can of the canned sweet potatoes. ( I needed a short cut due to the loads of Christmas cooking we were doing).  I also added in a bit of  brown sugar and a touch of lemon extract.  They came out great.  My family loved them, and I have now been dubbed the sweet potato pie maker for family functions.

First time making sweet potato pie and it's one for the record books. I used all ingredients as listed but I didnt have the orange flavor , which my family didnt miss. I added a teaspoon of all spice  and 5 tablespoon of brown sugar it was necessary.  I'm from the south and we like sweet sweet potato pies. Made on Saturday one pcs left on Sunday , my husband loved it! Great easy recipe!

I love this recipe. I make it every year. I use 1 pound of fresh sweet potatoes. It makes the perfect amount to fill a deep dish pie crust. I make the pie filling in a food processor to get a really smooth consistency. It's the best!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I decided to bake a sweet potato pie from scratch this thanksgiving as the commercial pies were hard to come by and I'm glad I found this recipe. However, I did make a few adjustments. First, I used a 24oz can of Bruce's canned yams. I used a food processor to get them into a smooth consistency then measured out 2 cups, which is about 1lb of whole sweet potatoes. I then heated the potatoes for about 2 minutes in the microwave. Secondly, I did not have orange rind, so I used about 1/4 tsp of orange juice. I also added about 2-3 tbsp of brown sugar. The batter seemed watery at first but once it was baked, the pie was perfect. It has a smooth, velvety texture and it is not too sweet (even with the brown sugar). Also I had to bake the pie an extra 10-15 minutes. After 40 minutes, the center was not ready, so I left it longer to bake and brown a little more. Overall, I will definitely be making this year-after-year. It was delicious!

This recipe makes beautiful pies.  For the first pass, I tend to follow the recipes as written.  For the next baking, I will double the cinnamon and nut measurements.  I don't have a scale that I use for cooking but 1 lb. of potatoes in my world equals 2 cups of cooked, mashed sweet potatoes.  Definitely use a deep dish pie crust.  I made this recipe using "mini" pie crusts.  This tends to be a lot more fun in my house and for some reason we tend to eat all of the mini pies.  The cooking time of this recipe is understated at this temperature.  I baked for almost an hour but I bake a lot and can most times gauge "doneness" by sight and touch.  Will definitely make again.  Love the idea of Eagle Brand, it makes such a silky, smooth texture.

This recipe is just they way I like it! Not too sweet, fluffy and creamy. It was a hit with my family. Only thing I did different was use orange flavor instead of orange zest. Next time I will only use one egg as I could smell the egg in it with two. Will be using this one from now on.

This is a nice starting base for someone like myself who's always tweeking recipes to my preferences. I've never made sweet potato pie using sweetened condensed milk so I thought I'd give it a try, adding and changing little things to my liking. With that being said, I'm happy with the end results of 2 deep dish pies. I used 3-15oz cans of sweet taters drained and mashed well, 1  condensed milk only, added an extra egg for 3, 2 Tbs cornstarch, and used the measurements for all the spices from Libbys old original pumpkin pie recipe except adding an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. As other reviews stated, you have to heat your potatoes with the butter and I even added the condensed milk in mine to incorporate it well. Baked both pies 15 min at 425 then 20 min at 350 as my oven runs hotter for 2 pies in prepared frozen shells. They turned out exceptionally well and even had the exact color and texture as pumpkin. I recommend anyone to try it out and make it your own or keep it as listed. They are delicious, although my oldest son prefers pumpkin all the time, he actually changed his mind on these and that's a bonus for me!

This filling is very yummy. I only added ~1 tablespoon of molasses to deepen the flavor and a few shakes more of seasoning. Ps if you use a real pie dish not premade crust, this will fill that & not even to the rim. I used a glass pie dish and it filled 3/4 of the way. Thankfully is puffs up a bit after cooking and then put your whipped topping on and it'll fill perfectly.

I made this version on an old favorite because I found myself with only Two cans of Condensed Milk this morning.  It was sweetened perfectly for a single pie and half the mess because I didn’t have to measure the sugar.   Loved the light and fluffy texture which elevated the dessert.  Nice Sunday dinner treat which reminds me of the beautiful pies my grandmother made.

It came out pretty but too much nutmeg. The pie tasted like soap because of it. I will try again with much less nutmeg

I am not really a sweet potato pie  person.Every one I have ever had has been made with canned sweet potatoes, which to me does not have a real flavor. I made this pie with a pound of fresh sweet potatoes peeled and boiled. Then followed the recipe as it stated. And this pie was delicious !!!!

Nice recipe!  I  can NEVER follow a recipe verbatim,  so of  course I had to alter it.  I added pumpkin spice and fresh nutmeg instead of cinnamon. Turned out great!!

I  made this using my  food processor. The  pie looked great,but it wasn't  sweet. I think the next time I make this  I am going to ditch the food processor  and add a small amount of sugar.

Excellent ..I used canned sweet potatoes and used lemon extract instead 1/2 tsp(no orange).  Was very creamy and not too sweet.  Definitely will make again!!

This was very good and my husband could not stop eating. The orange zest was right on and the aroma made the house smell very festive. This recipe is not just for the holidays.

I gave this recipe only 2 stars for how its written, because there is way too much nutmeg for my taste.  However I will make it again, just using less nutmeg and maybe a little ginger and allspice.  I think this one change would turn it into a 4 or 5 star rating.
