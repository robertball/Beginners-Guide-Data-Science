Wow! I'm glad I've tried several sangria recipes so I can give a comparative review. I love this stuff! I've made heavy, boozy delicious sangrias appropriate for summertime weekend PAR-TAYS!!!! and I've made light, boozy delicious peachy sangrias appropriate for a girls night in of party-planning and now I have this 3rd option in my back pocket ;) This stuff is perfect for a lunch date with the girls when you still have to be able to drive home and get dinner on the table for your crew. It's light, refreshing and won't get anyone smashed! Exactly like what you get from the restaurant chains on their 2-fer-1s! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! (UPDATE: I asked a friend to bring the OJ and she brought blueberry juice instead-guess what! still delish, different but sooooo good and SO SO SO PRETTY!!! just can't go wrong)

I don't usually review recipes I've altered, but this one gives "lemon lime seltzer" as a suggested modification, so I figure I'm safe. It was delicious, light, and non-sedating. With lemon-lime soda, it probably would have been too sweet, but with the seltzer, it suited my tastes perfectly. If you're a fan of the traditional thick, heavy, boozy sangria, you may not like it.
