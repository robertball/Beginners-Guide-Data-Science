The general consensus from reading others reviews on this recipe was that it was kind of dry.  I added extra olive oil and doubled the amount of garlic.  My family loved it.

We soooo enjoyed this dish.  I added alot of garlic as well as lots of pepper and fresh oregano.  I added a little touch more olive oil just to make sure it wasnt to dry. I also sauted vidalia onion with the bacon which added so much flavour.  I served it with brocolli and cheese sauce and salad. Talk about fattening, but worth ever bit.

This was very easy. I was disappointed and would not make it again. It was very dry.

This was easy and good!  My daughter, the bacon fan, loved this but without any
garlic in her serving (she's 7 so thinks garlic is "too spicy").  The time to cook the
bacon made this "less quick" but it was definitely worth the time... and a tip to 
cut down on cooking time & mess:  dice the bacon BEFORE cooking it!  Cooks 
much quicker and no need to crumble.  I'll be making this again and again!

This is easy, and much like the recipe I grew up making for my family. For the reviewers who said it was too dry and does not hold together, try this tip. Add one beaten egg to the pasta right after draining and quickly mix it in. The heat of the pasta will cook the egg, so you won't be eating raw. The egg also helps hold it all together and gives it a slightly creamy-ish texture. Hope this helps!

Thanks for sharing your recipe!  We were short on time and ingredients tonight.  This was perfect for our dinner.  We loved the taste--simple and not heavy like so many pasta recipes.  Some modifications:  a little more olive oil, whole wheat angel hair pasta (which tasted like regular pasta), and turkey bacon--Served w/ salad of mixed greens, spinach and carrots and with cheesy bread...mmmm!  One of those meals that leaves you feeling you didn't overeat.

I did not like the raw garlic. Next time I will add it to the bacon just before it finishes cooking. One pound of bacon was too much, and without a sauce it all just slid to the bottom of the bowl.

A cross between paste e olio and pasta carbanara this was good.  I made a half recipe but kept the same amount of oil and spices, this seemed to combat the dry problem other reviewers complained of.  It was fast, simple and easy.  I will keep it in mind for those nights I am short of time.

My kids didn't like this dish but my husband and I loved it.  Since a lot of the other reviewers said it was dry, I added about 3 or 4 tablespoons of melted butter and reduced the noodles by about a fourth.  It still made a lot and it tasted great!

Bacon Spaghetti.  Not a very catchy name.  Not a very snazzy dish either.  Humble.  Simple, but certainly not plain. Just a few ingredients.  And just plain good.  I used all ingredients to taste. (Donâ€™t forget to sprinkle with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano )

I gave this recipe 4 strs but modified it and my family loved it. I fried the bacon and left a few tablespoons of bacon drippings in skillet. I then added the Olive Oil and sauteed the garlic. Afterwards I added fresh baby spinach and parsley  to the same skillet until it wilted and stirred the bacon pieces back in. Cooked spaghetti was then tossed with the ingredients in the skillet and transferred to a large serving dish once completely coated and mixed. Once placed in large serving bowl I then mixed in about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it and wished I had made more.

This was very good.  Going by what a few other reviewers said about it being dry, I halved the amount of pasta.  I didn't have any spaghetti so I used corkscrews, which hold more of the olive oil and bacon pieces each bite.  I also chopped the bacon before pan frying.  Kept about a tablespoon of bacon drippings with the bacon when I incorporated the pasta.

All in all - it was very good and I would definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

to make this better you for sure have to add some extra garlic, olive oil, basil and salt especially is the key!!!  I used whole wheat pasta and turkey bacon which I added minced onion too.  Oh my goodness, it was super yummy! oh, if it is too dry, add more oil

My family has made this for years. Beloved "Nana Noodles" as we called them and still do. The reason some people are finding it dry is: DO NOT DRAIN BACON OIL, ADD IT TO PASTA. Maybe not all the oil, but I personally add most of the bacon grease. It will be great day of serving. A little dry maybe the day after. That's when you add a little olive oil. This recipe isn't for anybody counting calories. Have no shame in sprinked parmigian cheese on this.

This was okay, but needed  more salt and more parmesan cheese. Otherwise it was just too bland. I was looking for a pasta recipe that didn't include tomatoes or tomato sauce - so this did meet my criteria!

Easy, Fast and very good!  I use turkey meatballs in place of the bacon.  I also add some frozen veggies: corn, peas, string beans.

I am giving this a three, but some of the men in by family might have given it a four.  I followed some of the other reviews and added a little extra olive oil to the recipe. I didn't have any issues with this meal being too dry.  Though, this did remind me more of a pasta salad than a main dish.  I made an alfredo sauce with cut up tomatoes on the side just in case it was too dry, I really didn't need that much alfredo, but the bacon gave it a nice touch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you, Dali!  This was wonderful -- A refreshing change.  Didn't have garlic, so used about 1 tablespoon of Mrs. Dash.  I only made 1/2 a pound of spaghetti (forgot I was halving the recipe and kept the other ingredients the same except I added 4 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon bacon grease.  The calories probably more than doubled, but it was sooooooo good.

Some people don't like the raw garlic in this recipe.  I have always sauteed it in the bacon grease after the bacon was done.  I also like to chop a tomato very finely and throw it in there.  To help with it being too dry, I put about 2 tbsp margarine in the noodles while they're still hot.

I loved this recipe. I had bought a big 'ol package of pre-cooked bacon at Sam's Club and was looking for a non-breakfast recipe to use it. This is it! I can't wait to make it again because I will saute the garlic in the olive oil before tossing it with the bacon and spaghetti. This was so quick and easy to make!

I prepared the recipe as written but found it was a little dry, and so, I added just 2 Tbs melted butter, which was just enough to make it very nice.

Excellent!  I made it using half the spaghetti, but kept the same amounts of the other ingredients.  I also added about half a cup of shredded mozzerella. I will definitely keep making this dish.  It was even better the next day.  YUM!

This was just O.K. as far as I am concerned and my daughter was just so/so as well.  It lacked something, it accidentally mixed with my zesty italian salad dressing and that actually tasted pretty good!  Maybe I'll omit some oil next time and add a tablespoon or two of that!

My kids didn't really like this at all.  Too dry, not much flavor.  I added some spaghetti sauce and pesto and then my husband and I enjoyed it.

Crumble the bacon more next time, and try with real spaghetti noodles instead of the rotini.

Wow!  I really loved this!!  Super tasty!!  Too much garlic for my husband, though.  He wasn't a fan of this dish, and - as he put it - it was "a waste of bacon."  :-)

We love it, my son actually picked this out for his night to cook, he's 12 -- we made it together, w/ the exceptions we used a cup of organic basil sauce and we used morning star bacon, to make it completely vegetarian (hint on morning star bacon, broil it under the broiler for 8 minutes, or until crispy makes a world of difference)

Very nice. Added 6 tbs of olive oil, and instead of fresh garlic, I used a jar of minced garlic. 1/2 tsp is 1 clove, and I added 1 tbs + 2 tsp. I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil and it turned out really nice. Definitely making this again.

This recipe was ok but I did change a few things because I was out of items. I kept the bacon drippings and used that instead of the olive oil. I added the garlic and pepper to the bacon while it was frying to give the grease more flavor. I also added some dried basil. I am thinking about adding some mushrooms and onion next time. All in all this is a good basic recipe. My Fiance loved it.

I had the ingredients and read the reviews/comments and decided to escalate before even beginning. That dry and somewhat bland consensus bugged me, so I did the guy thing--hot stuff. I added a monster helping tablespoon of horseradish to the tossing ingredients along with a 6 oz. can of tomato paste and substituted sage for the oregano suggested by another reviewer (only because oregano gives me the urpie-urps).
How can you get crumbly bacon when it's cooking with a chopped up vidalia onion (another basic recipe digression!)? --You can't. So I fried the skillet down to where the onion had disappeared and then riced the bacon with a sharp knife while it was still frying. Yeah, and 6 cloves of garlic, not 3 and about 10 spoons of virgin olive oil--lots of black pepper, too. Not bland or dry recipe, now, you betcha!!

I am just learning to cook, and this recipe is perfect for me. I still need to get a garlic press, so the garlic was a little strong, but I'm sure that's easily remedied with the right equipment! My husband loves any time I can make a home cooked meal, and this one is definately going on the list.

LOVED it :) If you love pasta in general, this recipe is terrific. The bacon and garlic made it taste wonderful. My friend's dad didn't like it because it didnt have tomato sauce, but the rest of us absolutely loved it. Definitely worth a try.

This is a great recipe! I scaled the proportions back a bit since I was only cooking for 2, and my picky-eater husband just loved it.  Who would have thought to mix bacon and spaghetti?  A great idea and a delicious dinner.

I sauteed diced onions in a little bacon grease and olive oil, then added minced garlic. The sauce turned out a bit oily for my tastes, so I added a pat of butter, extra parmesan and some half n half to the mixture. It still fell short of the creamier texture I was looking for.  Next time I may try adding a beaten egg to the pasta make it more creamy like a carbonara sauce.

this is good but its basically spaghetti carbonara without the eggs. I also recommend doubling olive oil and garlic and using pecorino Romano cheese instead of parmesan.

This wasn't dry for me. Like what the other reviews suggested, I've added two tablespoons of olive oil to minced garlic. And I love to try dicing it the next time around. I would pair it with salad and/or garlic bread in the near future. An easy dish too.  I've modified it with turkey bacon and white fiber spaghetti.

Great meal!  Loved it!  SautÃ©d an onion with the bacon (which I chopped before I cooked it), threw in some oregano, and used 7 tbsp of Olive Oil instead of 6, which solved the dryness problem.  Really delicious!

It's a decent base recipe but by itself it is, in fact, very dry. The olive oil soaks in quickly.  I ended up making a sauce with some butter, a little whole milk, and added about 1/2 cup shredded, sauted raddichio, and 1/2 cup thawed frozen peas.  The bacon definately needs to be the last thing you add in, if you want it crunchy.

It was a little boring. I to found it to be dry. I also think it needs some fresh herbs and scallion or red onion.

This was a simple recipe that my family loved. And I loved I didn't have to spend all night cooking it! I tried it with turkey bacon, but that made it too bland. I'm going to try it with regular bacon next time. And if you find it's too 'dry' just add more olive oil. Simple as that!

It was actually really good with whole grain pasta. I used only Â½ a pound of bacon cause that's what was left in the fridge but all in all, I was really surprised with the result. And my family asked for more...

I loved this recipe. I like garlic and so does my family, so this was perfect for me to make. I am a beginner, so I try to look for things that are easy. My husband loved it. I read different reviews before trying the recipe. I did add extra oil and I added the garlic to the bacon at the very last minute. It was wonderful and easy.

Oh my gosh, where do I start! This was by far delicious the day I cooked it but it was bursting with flavor when we re-heated the leftovers the next day.  This dish is exceptionally tastier the day after. Definately a new favorite in my home!

Worked for me. It was fast and easy and didn't involve cream which usually accompanies a carboanara sauce. Kids liked it too.

pretty good, i didin't think i would like it without any sauce, so i made a basic white sauce and put the garlic flavor in that. i might have liked it better with out the sauce.

This was very simple to make and tasted very good. My 4 kids loved it. I will be making this again, next time I will probably add so veggies. I used this as a side dish, I wouldn't make this as a main course but it was great with the Garlic chicken recipe also from this site. Thanks Dali!!

This was a little bland for me even after I added some cheese. It's not a bad recipe however, it just doesn't have a lot of flavor. I even tried adding some of the grease the bacon was cooked in. Very fattening, but didn't really add to the flavor.

This recipe was good directly after cooking, but as with most pasta dishes, once put in the refrigerator, and re-served, just didn't taste the same
