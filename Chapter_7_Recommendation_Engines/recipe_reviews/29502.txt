I LOVE every single ingredient of this recipe, but I still think that it needed some help as it was very "plain" (but then again I enjoy plain steamed veges).  I am fortunate to have a Pop that goes salmon fishing for me (well he likes to fish, and sorta likes salmon & I'm not the best candidate for fishing and love salmon), so needless to say, I always have some.  Well I think that the baking dish could be exempted (the foil is just the same), as it took longer to bake, and well I think it  would be better on the grill & with some spicing up.  I flaked the fish & mixed it with the veges for a nice pre-Superbowl lunch tomorrow.  Thanks Eric!

I made this for my husband last week and he absolutely loved it!! I added extra hot sauce, a little olive oil and som "Spike" vegetable seasoning. This will definitely go in the rotation and I may try it with a different kind of fish.

I made lots of changes to this recipe and I turned out great!  I am adding it to my rotation!  I didn't use the tomatoes, carrots, hot pepper or lemon slices.  And I forgot the mushroom.  but I added lots of green bell pepper and onion.  I also created a completely different marinade: soy sauce, brown sugar, water, olive oil.  Mix till sugar is disolved then pour into foil packets.  Delish!!!

I put this in a glass pan instead of wrapping it in foil because I was afraid the tomatoes and the marinade would not react well with foil.  I was glad I did.  There was a lot of juice in the pan.  It would have been a MESS in a foil packet.  
I used a Cajun marinade recipe from tabasco.com and followed the instructions as given.  It turned out DELICIOUS!  It did take almost an hour to cook and needed some salt.  Based on those things and the imagined horror of cooking in a foil packet, I am only going with 4 stars.  I do highly recommend this recipe though.
*I plan to follow another reviewer's suggestion of using Spike seasoning instead of salt next time I make this!  What a great idea!
I made this again and used eggplant instead of squash because that's what I had on hand.  It was still delicious.

Very delicious, healthy and easy.  I did add some fresh basil, and sprinkled olive oil on layers.

While I really like hot, spicy foods, I didn't want to spoil the flavour of the salmon, so I substituted the hot sauce with a seafood seasoning rub. 
I loved the recipe and will definitely make it again.
