5+++++ I love this recipe. I made some healthy substitutions and it turned out yummy for me. I used whole wheat flour, splenda, and apple sauce in lieu of the oil. I also added about 1 tsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as others have recommended. I followed another users recommendation to seperate the whites from the eggs (beated until fluffy) and folded them into the batter as the final step--turned out nice and fluffy. I served these plain with the cinnamon butter recipe. Also, you can freeze left-overs (if any) in plastic baggies to be taken out at a later time to be quickly reheated in the toaster. 5-star plus--thanks for the wonderful recipe!

A well above par recipie, crispy and light. If you have a spare minute beat the egg whites separate, then fold them in at the last, not vital but you will not regret it.

I also doubled the vanilla and sugar, but the waffles seemed a bit bland still, relying on butter/syrup to bring most of the flavor. A good active-yeast recipe will taste better, but are generally more dense.

Also be sure to USE BAKING POWDER, NOT SODA, then the 4 teaspoons called for is perfect, if you put in 4 tsp of soda you'll never have heartburn again...

Bottom line, these waffles are well worth making. Simple, light and almost 5 star good.

This is a great, basic, easy waffle.  My waffle iron sat unused for--literally--10 years.  Wanted to try something new this morning with basic ingredients that I knew I had in the kitchen.  

The first waffle didn't turn out because I didn't use enough batter--my waffle iron needed about 2/3 cup each--but after that they were perfect.

For those new to waffle-making, here is a good tip I have used to know when they are done without having to open the iron constantly to look (which can ruin the waffle if it is still soft)...  It's done when the waffle quits ejecting plumes of steam around the edges of the iron.  (It's also usually done when it quits sticking to the iron.)

Will definitely make these again -- probably tomorrow!

HALF THE CALORIES, NO BRAINER!!  These waffles are good BUT...I made easy changes to make HUGE improvements to the nutritional value.  Instead of 2 eggs I used 3 egg whites and I used skim milk made into buttermilk instead of 2% milk (just add 1-1/2T lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes). In place of ½ cup of oil I used fat-free vanilla yogurt.  I agree with other reviews that the recipe as written is a little bland so instead of 1 tbsp white sugar I used ¼ cup Splenda.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and about a heaping tsp cinnamon.  I can feel GOOD about serving a 195 calorie waffle as opposed to a 400 calorie waffle - especially when my picky husband can't tell the difference!

As is, this is a really good spot on recipe.  Easy to make and enjoyable to eat.  However, with a few modifications it melts in your mouth!  
Here are the modifications that I made and yes, this will be redundant because so many other reviewers have done the same thing, AND with good reason!  Yum Yum!
Sugar changed 2 tablespoon brown sugar AND 2 tablespoon white sugar
vanilla extract changed 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon did not want to overpower the flavor of the waffles themselves.  
The other changes I did were on the building...
The eggs and how they are incorporated.. and yes, again this is redundant because sooo many others have said the same thing and it works to make them light and delicious!
seperate the eggs... put the whites in the blender and whip them till they start forming the fluffy whites... then add the yolks on low... then i added the milk, then the vegetable oil allowing to mix before adding the vanilla and all the dry goods (mix them before hand in another bowl).  
This helped produce a light waffle that really melted in my mouth YUM!  I will post a pict later of how they turned out.

I will never use another waffle recipe again!  I put all the ingredients into a blender to mix and baked beautiful, light and crisp waffles.  I even used all whole wheat flour, and they were still light and wonderful.

Good recipe, especially because I could make it the night before.  I changed it slightly, separating the eggs and whipping the whites until they were light and fluffy before I mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  I also doubled the sugar and vanilla, as was suggested, and added a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Delicious!

These are GREAT waffles.  My kids and husband loved them.  They are nice and light and taste good.  EASY to make.  

About the review that said they have to much baking soda--oops.  The recipe calls for baking POWDER and if you use Rumford brand there is no bad flavor at all (it's healthier too).  Just a heads up for those who might not try the recipe based on that review.  

This is my new waffle recipe.

Fantastic!!! Hard to find such a fluffy light recipe using whole wheat flour but this is it! I cut oil in half to 1/4 cup, used whole wheat flour instead of white, doubled vanilla, added a sprinkle of cinnamon.
I have started to use melted butter for the oil, very good, everyone says they are the best waffles ever.

I made this recipe in my blender.  It was so good.  I sprayed my waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and had no problem popping the waffles off.  What we didn't eat, I wrapped in waxed paper and stored in  a freezer bag for toasting during the week.

OMG!!  You do NOT need any oil at all.  Want to know how I know?  I'm a ditz with 5 young children and they are all out of school today chanting "Waffles!  Waffles!" so I am fixing waffles and I accidentally omitted the oil.  I didn't realize it until I wondered why my oil was out on the counter an hour later.  They turned out wonderful!  Omit the oil, save the calories, and save your money.  Have you priced oil lately?!

Yummy!  Great waffles!  Followed the recipe exactly, but added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Topped mine with butter, fresh blueberries and raspberries, and some warm maple syrup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have a Belgian waffle maker and always used boxed Aunt Jemima mix as the waffle batter.  Today, I became adventurous by replacing the Aunt Jemima mix with this recipe.  I was careful use baking powder, not soda to the mix.  This was a success!  Good bye Aunt Jemima.  Depending on your sweet tooth, you may want to add another tablespoon of sugar to the mix.  I am never satisfied with just plain waffles.  I like to make either apple cinnamon or banana walnut waffles.  For apple cinnamon waffles, add one cup of apple sauce and 1 table spoon of cinnamon to the mix.  You may want to also add another one or two table spoons of flour to the batter because apple sauce tends to make things runny.  For the banana walnut waffles, place 8 oz of walnuts and two ripe bananas to a food processor and mix until the bananas become a paste.  Add the banana walnut mix to the waffle batter.  Both the apple cinnamon or banana walnut waffles will be tasty and you will amaze your family and neighbors by the wonderful smells from your kitchen.

reminds me of egos, only better and fluffier.  I added twice the amount of sugar and vanilla.  Plus i added cinnamon.  Very good, reheat in the toaster after freezing.  and i dunno what one of the ppl that rated this recipe did but it didnt taste like baking soda to me, i left the mix in the fridge overnight and whisked before putting in the iron.

I didn't want to use a whole half cup of vegetable oil in this recipe, I cut it in half and substituted a quarter cup of my homemade apple butter. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. When the batter was mixed, it was quite thin. I did need to add an additional half cup of flour, then it was perfect. The waffles puffed up beautifully and were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, even with the additional mixing needed to add more flour. GREAT basic waffle recipe. Four and a half stars for me because of the additional needed flour.

WOW!!! This waffle recipe was great. Like others, I doubled the sugar and vanilla extract. I also used butter instead of oil since that was all I had on hand. The first time, I made the recipe without the cinnamon. The second time I made it WITH the cinnamon (like others have suggested) and it just gave it so much more character, if you will. The cinnamon REALLY gave the waffle something special. I used 1t of cinnamon and will always make it with the cinnamon from now on. These waffles are crisp on the outside and thick and soft on the inside. I used a Waring Pro Belgian Waffle Maker (set to 4) for these waffles. This recipe carries itself as is, but it would also serve as a great "base" if you wanted to add blueberries or bananas or something else to the mixture. A+! Thanks for sharing this one!

I've made this twice so far. Once with beaten egg whites (I thought I might as well beat them while waiting for the waffle iron to heat up) and once with the egg beaten normally.  Both were really delicious and crispy.  Beating the whites gave it a very airy crispness, but the recipe really didn't need it.  Following the recipe exactly gave a crispy outside/more tender inside texture that I really loved.  Wonderful recipe!

Very good and easy. I find beating the eggs until fluffy being the trick to making these waffles nice and crispy.Less hassle than beating the egg whites separately and these waffles came out just the way I wanted them.Will use this recipe from now on. Thanks! :)

I just got a "new" round waffle baker at the thrift store so decided to make this recipe.  I used whole wheat flour, applesauce for most of the oil and doubled the vanilla and sugar.  I thought they came out great!!  Threw the rest in the freezer for quick toaster-oven waffles.

Excellent recipe that yields a fluffy and delicious waffle.  Like others, I made a few modifications.  First, I doubled the sugar and vanilla and added cinnamon.  Second, I used buttermilk instead of milk (same measurement).  Finally, after beating the eggs until fluffy, I mixed all the wet ingredients together in one bowl and all the dry ingredients together in another, larger bowl.  I then folded the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients in thirds and then let the batter rest for about 20 mins before using.  This recipe yielded 8 Belgian Waffles.  Everyone cleaned their plates and wanted seconds (that almost never happens with my kids).  This one is a keeper.  Thanks!

I've made these several times and have learned that the more I beat the eggs, the lighter and fluffier they are (even up to 5 minutes until they are very stiff, then fold them in). I use olive oil, and have added 2-3 tablespoons of milled flax seed which you can't taste. They are still a little bland, so I'll be trying new things as I go. I think next time I'll substitute half the white flower with whole wheat flour and see how that goes. Very easy recipe, one that I will continue using and improvising with as I go.

I made this recipe this morning and it turned out great.  I altered it slightly by doing 1/2 wheat flour and adding only 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.  I threw in some fresh blueberries and my husband and I loved it.  My batter turned out a little thick, but I'm sure its because I didn't add all the oil.  I tried one batch without blueberries it was good, but not great tasting.  I think this will be my blueberry waffle recipe.  I will be making this again.  Very easy.

I hate to go against the grain here, but these waffles were awful.  We followed the recipe exactly and they turned out heavy and soggy. We cooked them as much as we could, anymore and the outside would have been burnt. My kids even spit them out.

Made the recipe exactly like it states. The batter tasted fine, but when it was cooked the flavor of baking powder was inedible. Also, it browned, but didn't crisp up, maybe too much oil?  Won't try this again.

These were pretty good texture wise. I disagree with those that say to double the vanilla...made our waffles taste funny. Much better with the 1/2 tsp. :)

Honestly, this was the most disgusting waffle recipe I've ever tried... they were dry & had a very sickening taste even with butter & syrup. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody else.

These are great waffles!  Crispy on the outside and tender inside.  Even better than the recipe I usually use, which is also very good!  I used half whole wheat flour and skim milk.  Made the batter the night before, put it in the fridge, and in the morning, all I had to do was heat up my waffle iron.  So easy!

Perfect perfect perfect! Really great! I loved these - didn't have vanilla (how does that even happen??) so I added a tsp of cinnamon to the batter, REALLY great. I did add 1/4 cup sugar instead of the 1 tbsp, because my kids eat them w/o syrup (too messy) but the texture was PERFECT.

I went exactly by the recipe, it was not to my liking. Bland, no flavor almost rubbery. I didn't over cook or under cook them, it was just not to my liking. Never again.

Easy to follow, good recipe. A little bland even with extra vanilla, but the butter and syrup solve that!

I followed instructions exactly.  They looked beautiful coming out of the iron but I had one unhappy family once we sat down to eat.  All we could taste was the baking powder.
This is the first bad review I have ever given, but I was really let down by this one...

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  What is accomplished by making changes to a recipe and then rating it according to the end result with the changes?  Maybe there's a way to filter out the reviews based on whether they are for the original recipe.  In any case, made per the original recipe, the waffles were perfect.  Light, airy, a little crisp around the edges,  delicious!

This makes a good quick waffle if you double the salt, vanilla, and sugar.  However, it does not beat my yeast waffle recipe that came with my waffle maker.  It's soooo much better. Add 1/3 cup sugar and it taste like a dough nut.  Check it out: http://www.food.com/recipe/good-night-waffles-202843

4 tsps of baking powder is WAY too much.  Those reviewers who say they tasted bitter are tasting the baking powder. Otherwise this would be a good recipe.

I rated this a 5 but I used this as a base recipe and changed it quite a bit to make it more flavorful as suggested. I added 1 tbls white vinegar to the milk and let sit for 5 minutes to "sour"the milk (buttermilkish). I used 1 1/2 cups WW flour, 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup blue cornmeal. Then added 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil, 2 packages of splenda, 1 tablespoon brown sugar and lemon zest. I used the other suggestions and separated the eggwhites and folded them in last. I chose to add fresh strawberries I had. Was healthy and so good. My kids loved them.

This recipe is perfect!  Waffles come out fluffy inside, crispy outside, and completely delicious.  This waffle has fewer calories than some other recipes, which is why I tried it, and I'm pleased that it has all the flavor of classic waffles.  It's definitely not diet food, but it's about 200 calories less than other recipes I've tried, and is within the calorie range that won't throw my diet completely off if I cut back with other meals throughout the day.

I did "healthy it up" a bit by using applesauce instead of oil, and it worked well, although waffles weren't as crispy.  

Thanks for posting this recipe!  My family begs me to make these waffles every day!

Soooo good! These are wonderful-crispy outside and light and soft inside. I used melted butter instead of oil, 1/2 wheat flour, double sugar and vanilla, and separately whipped egg whites folded in right before cooking. My son was amazed by the "fluffiness!" The flavor was wonderful-and all 4 kids and husband agreed. I also added chopped walnuts to my batter (after I made the kids) and with sliced bananas and maple syrup on top I'm in heaven! I doubled the recipe and will freeze the rest for schoolday breakfasts.

A good, basic waffle recipe.  I used 2/3 whole wheat flour and will probably do it again.  I also beat the egg whites separately, but didn't notice the waffles to be overly fluffy.  Just a good recipe.  Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as it says except i took one users advice and did the egg whites seperate and then folded them in. I was almost certain that it would make them light and cispy but instead almost the moment they came off the waffle iron they become soggy. I even added cinnamon and extra sugar to prevent them from being blan but it didnt help. These waffles were not only soggy but very blan.

Like others, found this easy to prepare. Did add cinnamon, ginger & nutmeg as we like lots of spices here, so they are always on hand. Also doubled the sugar & vanilla & did add the salt, which I don't in a lot of recipes, but any dough product probably needs it. The texture was perfect-crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  Thanks for sharing OneShy!

We really enjoyed these waffles. However, they were a little bit dense...I was hoping for something a little fluffier. Still delicious, though. I made extra and will freeze them for quick breakfasts!

Very good starter recipe. Whisking eggs til frothy definitely lightens up the waffles. I used soy milk and added a scoop of Jay Robb's Vanilla Whey powder to try to add some more protein (and some vanilla flavoring). It didn't add a ton of vanilla flavor but I did get my protein from it. Definitely will keep this recipe. It's easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand!

These are GREAT...I have made them several times using the egg white beating method until today when I simply mixed everything together in a blender... I have to say that both times they turned out crisp and light...and almost identical. I won't waste time beating the egg whites again! ;)

Wonderful recipe!  I have to admit I was too lazy to get the hand beater out to beat the eggs (I just whisked them up with a fork really well), but man these waffles were awesome.  They really tasted great and everyone in my household loved them.  What I love is that they don't have a lot of sugar and so they didn't taste terribly sweet like some waffles do. I made a full batch and saved the leftover cooked waffles in the fridge, then popped them in the toaster the next day for breakfast and I believe they were even better crisped up in the toaster the next day! Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Very good!  I did add extra sugar (quite a bit, maybe 4 T in all) because I'm not a syrup fan.  Probably shouldn't because my kids love syrup and put maple syrup on them!  I've tried MANY recipes, this is a keeper for sure.  I've never thought beating the egg whites separately until fluffy made much of a difference, even though I almost always use a recipe that calls for that.  I like recipes that are slightly sweet and not "eggy" tasting.  This one fits the bill.  The secret if you don't like "soggy" (I don't care either way) is to watch your waffle maker and get to know it.  Don't rely on the light to go off or on.  If you like yours more crispy, and it's still steaming quite a bit, don't open it yet.  You won't want to wait until the steam stops completely, most likely, but lessens.  I'm not sure if the irons are on timers or sensors but just watch for steam amount.  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe.

Our Family loved these waffles.  I use all fresh ground whole wheat flour.  I added 1/4 tsp of dry active yeast and they were really good, it just gives them a little bit of a "malted" flavor.***UPDATE*** Added 3/4 cup pumpkin puree, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 add'l T Sugar.  PUMPKIN WAFFLES were to die for!

great recipe but if you have the time, separate your eggs, mix the yolks in as instructed and beat with the rest of the ingredients. whip the whites in a seperate bowl to a soft peak.  Fold gently into the mixture at the very end.  They will be a lot fluffier.

I made this several times and everyone loved them, but today I decided to add a grated apple, cinnamon and raisins as well as 1/4 cup raw bran.  The kids only noticed the apples and raisins.  

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I tweaked this just a bit. I’m not terribly fond of using vegetable oil in recipes. I cut out half the vegetable oil, replaced it with melted butter, combined the two and then slowly whisked the fats into the batter to be evenly distributed. The waffles had a nice buttery flavor to them by doing that. I’ve found these freeze well, a godsend for anyone with a busy lifestyle and can be reheated in a toaster like any store bought waffle out there.  These also work well for Belgian Waffle irons too. A great all around waffle recipe.

I think these waffles suffer without yeast.  They tasted stale straight off the waffle iron.  They had an unpleasant crumbly texture.  My kids, husband, and I were all very disappointed in these waffles.

The recipe was easy and used ingredients I had on hand. My husband liked the waffles a lot (I didn't have any, I just made them). The only thing I didn't like compared to my own recipe was that they were a bit thin.

These are sooo good!  I made exactly as written.  The batter seems to be thinner than the boxed batter, so it cooks faster.  I turned the setting down on my waffle iron on the second batch as the first batch was a little too brown.  This made 2 batches for me.  So, 8 individual waffles for my waffle iron.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's much better than the boxed stuff (and my son agrees).

Followed recipe exactly , except used only 1/4 cup oil- instead of 1/2 cup.  I was able to make 10 waffles from my waffle maker! They came out light and fluffy! For an extra crisp exterior, just toss in toaster on light or lowest setting.  Easy to mix together and cook.  UPDATE: I made with half AP flour and white wheat flour, they were still good. Oh, and only used 1/4 cup oil.

Bland, completely unremarkable. Read most of the 5-star reviews and you'll see the posters have made pretty significant tweaks to the recipe before reviewing it (so why give it 5 stars?!)

I won't be making this one again.

As written, it's your basic waffle recipe.  It's quite good on it's own.  It's possible to make them awesome with just a few changes.  One, separate the eggs for sure, beating the whites separately and folding them in last.  I also add one additional Tbs. white sugar, 1 tsp. maple sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla sugar.  Yeah, we like our waffles sweet enough that you can eat them without syrup and we don't even like to pretend waffles are health food!  I get ten waffles in my Calphalon No-Peek iron from one recipe, but I always double it and freeze the extras for toasting.  They're so delicious the kids eat them like toast on the way to school with no butter or syrup necessary.

Perfect waffles. I also separated the egg yolks from the whites as others mentioned, and folded the beaten egg whites into the batter at the end.

These were ok, I give them 3 stars just for the crispyness and texture but they really lacked on flavor, I even tripled the sugar and vanilla.  Still looking for a good waffle recipe.

Pretty good.  Very fluffy and crunchy outside.  I tried whipping egg white version, and it was slightly fluffier and tender, yet recipe as is was also good enough.  You can make batter ahead (It keeps well in fridge), that is plus, too.

After years of my poor waffle iron sitting on the shelf, I decided to put it to use & make waffles for my kids. They were incredible! Ever since, the waffle iron sits on the counter right next to the coffee pot & is used daily! I've made large batches & just keep in a pitcher in the fridge. It makes for a quick, easy tasty breakfast and sometimes dinner. I don't even want to try another recipe because this one is PERFECT! Never again will I buy the frozen !

Very light and fluffy- yet crispy on the outside.  I took the advice of another review and whipped the egg whites.  I added roasted pecans because that's the way I roll.  Delicious.

Good and very easy, just not the best waffle I've ever eaten.  I prefer buttermilk waffles, but since I don't usually keep buttermilk on hand, this recipe comes in handy for when I'm craving waffles.

These were fantastic!! Light and fluffy. Had just a couple for leftovers and they didn't last longer than the next meal. The only thing I did differently was per some of the reviews I added some cinnamon to the batter. Next time I will double the recipe because there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe & simple to put together. I beat the whole eggs till light, apprx 3mins. I also used 1C whole wheat, 1C all purpose. My extremely picky child gobbled up an entire waffle & for my husband & I, I added 2 slices of crumbled bacon to the batter. PERFECT!

Since I was out of butter, I used the ingredient search using oil instead and these came up. I also used my blender like another reviewer to hurry things along and thought these came out pretty good. I used 1/4 Cup scoops for each waffle section of my iron and with this recipe I was able to make 14 waffles.

I made this recipe almost exactly. I added thawed strawberries , 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. I blended wet ingredients in a blender on the highest setting.  Then, I whisked the dry ingredients in by hand including whole wheat flour.  We were trying to find a great way to make healthy peanut butter sandwiches for the kids lunches. We are trying to stay away from the corn syrup in jelly. The waffles were slightly sweet and made great lunchbox additions.  They were so good that my picky DH ate them. Definitely a recipe worth repeating.

Fluffy, not too oily, and crisp on the outside.  Helpful hint:  when adding more sugar than the recipe calls for (we like ours sweet), whisk eggs, whisk again with sugar until sugar is dissolved, then add remaining ingredients.  It allows for the sugar to be incorporated so it doesn't cause the batter to stick to the waffle iron. Add a dash of cinnamon and cardamom. My kids don't even know what the flavor is. I have also used 1/2 cup stone-ground whole wheat flour plus 1/4 c. milk. Mmmm...

Good basic waffle recipe.  Nothing really wowing, but a great recipe for when you do not have mix on hand.  They are easy to make and I typically stock all the ingredients.  

The waffles came out fluffy and moist.

This was heavenly!  Hands down, the best waffles I have ever had.  My family loved this recipe-my husband and sons asked me to stop trying other waffle recipes and just make this one from now on.  As suggested by others, I did sub buttermilk for the milk, and added extra sugar (I used 1 T.white and 1 T. brown) and doubled the vanilla. Just as other reviewers said, they were crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. Thanks for this excellent recipe!!!Would have given it 10 stars if that were an option.

Wonderful crisp waffles!  We had really like Mom's best waffles also on this site, but I think these are better.  The only thing I did differently is that I didn't add the full 1/2 cup of oil.  Next time, I'll substitute butter for the oil.

Ok so after making them the way the recipe was written and then after being disappointed and then reading a lot of reviews I changed a few things and these came out perfect! I used 1/2 cup butter instead of vegetable oil, I think this made them less soggy and more crunchy! I doubled the sugar and the vanilla. I lowered the baking powder down to 2 1/2 teaspoons and a sprinkle of nutmeg and 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon, you could add less cinnamon, but my kids loooved the cinnamon flavor!

*** I was at my brother's house and he's vegan so he was out of milk. I used almond milk instead of regular milk and wow, they turned out fantastic.. I think I will use almond milk from now on, they seemed to turn out more crunchy, I also added a half teaspoon of baking power up to 3 teaspoons.

Tried this recipe because of the reviews and it was great! The only substitutions I used were whole wheat pastry flour, doubled the vanilla and sugar (also subbed for brown sugar) per suggestions and added in a pinch of cinnamon and cardamom.  The perfect amount of sweetness for eating a waffle by itself. The only tiny issue I have, it's mainly a personal preference, was that the waffles were a tad greasy with the amount of oil, so next time I will try it with a healthier alternative besides just oil (applesauce or yogurt). I didn't have enough time to beat the eggs until fluffy like the recipe states since my beaters were dirty but hand whisking it slightly was all I was able to do. The waffle is fluffy, light and crisps up nicely. Oh, I highly suggest you let these cool on a wire rack, otherwise, they will stay soggy. Letting them cool on the rack lets the outside crisp up nicely. This made 9 waffles for me, using 1/2c measurement and a regular circular waffle iron. The batter is thin when you make it but just pour the batter in a circular motion and you'll have an even batter waffle! Great recipe, thanks!

Good recipe The dog cleared the counter of a double recipe.I did manage to get one though before The Great Dane counter surfed while I stepped out of the room. Personally a bit more vanilla and maybe a bit of acid like lemon juice to add to the milk or buttermilk? Wish I had read some of the hints prior and left the dog on the porch! LOL

Great recipe.  Like others, I separated the eggs and folded the whites into the batter.  That is the key to very fluffy and light waffles.  I am making a double-batch right now to freeze so we can eat them on the go during the week.  To freeze: cool waffles completely on a wire rack, then layer on a cookie sheet and freeze a few hours until solid before wrapping in a freezer bag.

Easy, reliable recipe. In lieu of the oil, I use either applesauce or a combination of applesauce and coconut oil. I also add 1 tsp vanilla as well as a couple drops of almond extract and a few shakes of cinnamon. I yield about 6 waffles from this recipe, which is just right for our family. Whatever toppings you choose, this waffle makes a perfect foundation.

I went against my better instincts and followed this recipe as written.  It got such high praise.  But this tasted too strongly of baking powder..  Halve the Baking powder and add a tablespoon of lemon juice.  The acid in the juice will react with the powder and creates the same effect.

This is one of my easy go to waffle recipes. I beat the eggs till fluffy in one bowl and mix the other ingredients in another bowl, then add the eggs to the batter. I also leave them in the waffle iron till they get brown and crisp... they will still be soft and delicious inside.

Really good. I would like to add more vanilla next time to add some more flavor. Would be a really base for other flavors and adding thing like chocolate chips and coconut.

Great and very easy recipe! I topped off the waffles with coconut syrup, fresh pineapple, bananas, and toasted macadamia nuts. It tasted just like the waffle me and my husband enjoyed on our honeymoon in Hawaii.

This is a good recipe, but a little on the unhealthy side. To kick up the fiber, I split the flour for 1 cup white/1 cup whole wheat and added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. Becuase the flavor of the waffles is so bland, I increased the flavor by using 4 tablespoons of Splenda to sweeten and 1 tsp vanilla. Even using ht basic recipe, the batter is a bit thick and leands to a dense waffle, so to lighten the batter, I added an additional 1/2 cup milk.  NOt only did the husband gobble up his waffle, but the kids enjoyed them as well.  Additionally, it is better to mix all the dry ingredients first so that you have a consistent batter and then after mixing in your wet ingredients, let your batter rest to let it fully rise.

Delicious - cooked flat like pancakes (no waffle iron - used a sandwich press instead.)  Tasted good because took others advice to separate yolks from whites & fold whites in at the end.  Lovely light texture & great taste!

I followed the advice of one review.  I separated the egg whites, beat then folded them in as the last mixing step.  I also doubled the sugar and vanilla.  Was perfect with blueberries and whipped cream.

These looked great, but the taste of the baking powder was overwhelming, even slathered with butter and syrup. Will try again using about 1 teaspoon, and see what happens. We could not even finish these.

I make this recipe almost every weekend. I prep about a dozen waffles and put them in the fridge. Then I grab 2-3 on the way out the door and heat them up for 45-60 seconds in the microwave for a fast and delicious breakfast. I love this recipe because it's so versatile. I regularly add fruit and mini chocolate chips. Favorite additions include 2 mashed bananas + mini semisweet chocolate chips OR half a can of pumpkin puree and a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar. So easy!!

These turned out so yummy!  I doubled the sugar and vanilla as many suggested and they were really good!  I love this recipe because it doesn't use buttermilk which I never have on hand, and when I buy it specifically for waffles I can only find it in the 1L containers and end up wasting most of the container because I do not use buttermilk for anything else.  Now I will probably make waffles more often since I always have all of these ingredients in the house.  I topped half of my waffle with real maple syrup and the other half with real whipped cream and some fresh strawberries, yum!  I reheated one in the toaster at work the next day and it squished a little but turned out crispy and yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Best waffle recipe I've tried yet!  I did separate the eggs as recommended in a few other reviews.  I used 1tbsp white sugar and 1tbsp brown sugar (and they still weren't that sweet).  I also added a pinch of nutmeg and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  These were delicious!  Light and airy, most of recipes I've tried have been dense and heavy.  This one's a keeper!

Loved these waffles.  I also loved that they were easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I did add a full teaspoon of vanilla and a little extra sugar.  Topped them with blueberries and cream delicious!

Just ok. I ended up throwing some chocolate chips in after the first few threw the waffle maker jst because we found them fairly bland. Maybe more vanilla and sugar be better.

Made several times.  Used buttermilk instead of milk.   After they have been cooked I freeze the ones we didn't eat for later.

The best homemade waffles I have ever had, they were super fluffy, very easy to make, and the whole family + friends loved them. I, as I've always done, put in chocolate chips in one batch, and blueberries in another, right into the batter before I cooked them. I recommend this recipe 150%.

Yum! My first attempt at waffles. Made slight modifications: 1/4 cup of veg oil instead of 1/2, agave instead of white sugar, almond milk instead of milk, 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 1/2. I also added in sliced strawberries.

My family didn't like this at all.  I made the batter exactly as written and it was extremely runny.  I added more flour and the waffles were crisp but tasted a bit like pretzels.  I added more sugar and vanilla but they still didn't taste like waffles should.  I will not be making this recipe again.

These turned out pretty good for me last night. I did switch buttermilk for regular milk, but the measurements were spot on for 6 good size waffles. I threw the leftovers in the freezer for another day. I did take a picture of these, but my camera settings are not compatible with AllRecipes, so, unfortunately, I can't post it. But all-in-all this is a really good recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I did as other reviewers said and beat the egg whites separately.  I added 1/4 cup sugar and some cinnamon.  Also, used 1 1/4 cup ap flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/4 cup oat bran. Delicious!

Fantastic waffle recipe.  They turned out perfectly and I got 6 and a half waffles using my belgian waffle maker.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems.  I didn't even need nonstick spray to keep them from sticking to the waffle maker.  Definitely a keeper for me.

Almost as easy as opening up a box of waffle mix, and much better tasting!  I didn't bother to separate the eggs, and still found these to be very light.  I used half whole wheat flour and doubled the vanilla and sugar...the kids and I really enjoyed these.

My family was giving me a lot of grief about always being forced to eat healthy waffles so I decided to make these for them as a treat.  These waffles were very dense and bland and not even the toddlers liked them.  I added pecans but kept everything else the same.  The whole house agreed that the whole grain waffles on this site were a hundred times better.

Great waffles, the family ate them all up and asked for more.  This recipes makes a lot of waffles!  The first time I made them, I had leftovers, so I cut in half the next time.  Added some sliced frozen strawberries (which I thawed of course) and 1 Tbsp. of strawberry preserves.  YUMMY!

Very good, basic waffle recipe! Came out golden brown and very fluffy. I will definitely make again but will add some cinnamon/nutmeg.

For the other reviewers who said that theirs turned out with an overwhelming baking soda taste.... There is NO baking SODA in this recipe. The recipe calls for baking POWDER. That could be half the problem you're having. LOL!

This recipe was a bust. The waffles got overly dark but were limp and had a strong taste of baking soda. Not what I prefer in a waffle at all. The only upside is that they held their shape well.....

I definitely reccommend having your waffle iron on one of the higher settings... As a twist, I sliced a banana in half the long way, then in half again and fried it both sides in a bit of butter before chopping it and putting it between two layers of waffles and topping with maple syrup.  DELISH!

Wonderful fluffy waffles that come out crisp.  I recommend beating the egg whites separately and fold them in after all ingredients are combined.

Great flavor and texture. I had never cooked waffles before, this was a great recipe to get me started.  I used milk as I did not have buttermilk.

Dense and rubbery.  First time using my waffle maker, so I have nothing to compare it to, but these are nothing like restaurant waffles, or even frozen waffles.  I cooked them for at least 10 minutes, and they never crisped up.  Next time I'll try Bisquick.

Not sure what went wrong here, but these were absolutely the worst waffles I've ever made.  They were soggy, leaden, and had a terrible aftertaste (even with the cinnamon added).  I didn't use 90% of the batter because they simply wouldn't cook properly.  Only modification I made was to substitute 1/4 cup of white flour with whole wheat flour--the recipe even states whole wheat will work in it, so I can't imagine that that's what made it bomb.

Yum! I followed the directions except using about 1/4 cup mashed banana and 1/4 cup oil instead of the full 1/2 cup.  It was healthier, delicious, still crispy, and had just a hint of banana flavor.

Excellent!  I make them every weekend and everyone loves them, family and guests alike.  I use half whole wheat flour, half oil/half apple sauce and 1.5 tsp vanilla.  Once the batter is done and the iron is heating, I cut up apples into very small pieces and add them in.  Add pecans on top of each waffle in the iron and you have delicious apple/pecan waffles!

My first time making waffles and a definite success.  I made I few changes: doubled the sugar and vanilla.  I also used 1 cup of eggnog (wanted to use it up) and 3/4 cup of skim milk.  This will be my go to recipe for waffles, no need to look further.  Great recipe.

My first waffles from scratch and my picky husband thought these were amazing!  Light and fluffy with a great flavor.  I also made the homemade vanilla maple syrup and i will keep this one to make again and again.

This would get 5 stars but it did need just a little tweaking IMHO...I added 1 tsp cinnamon, I beat egg whites separately and folded in last, doubled sugar to 2 Tb (could use 3 next time), used a little less oil (will try melted butter next time for flavor), and had to add a little milk to make it flow over the waffle iron. I decided to try half whole wheat flour and was pleased with the result. These waffles cooked MUCh faster than most other recipes I have used: they were done in 3 minutes max even on a medium setting. Very light and crisp on the outside, they were not at all chewy or dense. In fact, they were probably the lightest in texture I have ever made. We enjoyed them with butter and real maple syrup this morning. Yum!

I have made these waffles several times now. They are amazing! My kids love them. I will never use a package mix again. I have made strawberry syrup and peach syrup to go with them, but the best is the homemade syrup I found on this site. Together they are like heaven.

I read a lot of the reviews saying how bland the waffles were but overall good.  Here is what I did differently:  1) Seperated the eggs and beat the whites until they formed soft peaks.  2) Replaced regular milk with buttermilk, and infused the milk with a split vanilla bean for 10 minutes... Strained vanilla bean and seeds   3) Replaced the vanilla extract with 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (hard to find, but some specialty food stores carry it)  4) Add a tablespoon of Best Foods mayo for extra fluffiness!  (I know it sounds weird but it's an old trick!)  5) Fold in egg whites last! With the egg whites, fold in a GOOD drizzle of pure maple syrup.  I topped the waffles with fried chicken, warm maple syrup and powdered sugar!  (My husband wanted to try wings and waffles after seeing it on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives!) Next time I will make them for breakfast and add some blueberries and slivered almonds!     *** For the holidays, you can make these with pumpkin puree and cut down on the milk and add sweetened condensed milk (infused with a cinnamon stick and vanilla bean), nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice***

A great basic waffle recipe. You can't go wrong. A nice recipe to have on hand when you want the "original" instead of something over the top. Just make sure you don't overbeat, or you will likely end up with flat, dense waffles.

I just bought a mini waffle maker and have been eager to try out a few waffle recipes. Within a span of 3 days I have tried two waffle recipes on this site. This one, and the Classic Waffles Recipe. Both my husband and I agreed that we much prefer the Classic Waffles Recipe. They came out perfect, crispy on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside. On the other hand, this recipe, Waffles I, came out slightly soggy. I think it might have to do with the dry to wet ingredients ratio. The Classic Waffles Recipe calls for slightly less milk and oil/butter. They just worked out so much better for us. And,it might really just have to do with what brand waffle maker you have. I would try out both and see which one works out best for you!

I have no idea why this recipe has so many good reviews.  I followed recipe exactly and it was super liquidy. So I added more flour so I could actually cook it (almost a whole extra cup), and they had an awful bland taste.

Worst waffle recipe of all time. I followed the recipe exactly! I even checked it and rechecked it a dozen times to see where I messed up but couldnt find anything. I used a measuring cup too. The batter was far too liquidyt and runny. The waffles came out shrunken and rubbery. I was so mad. Im never trying this recipe again.

waffles were fairly easy to make and looked great when they were done. i thought it lacked something though. maybe i'll increase the sugar and vanilla like some others suggested and add half a cup of butter next time. thanks!

These are very good tasting waffles, nice not to crunchy exterior with a fluffy middle.I would add just a little more sugar, maybe another tablespoon. But great recipe! Best waffle ive had.

YUMM!!  These waffles are great. Fluffy on the inside - crispy on the outside.  I did make some changes as others suggested: Doubled the sugar, I also seperated the eggs, wisked till fluffy and folded them in when the batter was done.  I also used butter instead of oil.

THIS WAS AWESOME!!! I did modify the recipe by using applesauce for half of the oil. Additionally, I added extra vanilla and a hefty sprinkle of cinnamon! After many waffle recipes, this one has made it to my recipe box! Thank you so much!!!

These waffles came out very light and fluffy. A 1/4 cup of batter did it for my waffle maker. However, I did make a few changes, I added 2 tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I was surprised that this batter gave me so much waffles (14),so I frooze them. Thanks for sharing Ultra B.

I used this recipe to christen my new waffle baker.  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the sugar and vanilla.  If I try this recipe again, I won't increase the vanilla because I think it adversely affected the flavor and texture (probably because I only had the cheap stuff).  Also, I would let the batter rest for a while to help in rising -- if not, I would at least beat the egg whites and fold them in last.

Husband and kids (ages 6 and 3) LOVED this recipe... I used the whole wheat flour, added a tablespoon of wheat germ, doubled the vanilla, and added a dash of cinnamon. They really are very filling and the only thing I will do differently next time is add a bit more sugar (probably the wheat germ that made it need just a little more sweetness). Overall a very tasty waffle.

A favorite in our home. I separated the eggs and beat the whites separately. These, I folded in to the mix at the very end. I also added chocolate chips to half, but only once they were in the waffle iron, for even distribution :) Everyone's happy!

Yummy, fluffy and tasty! What more could one want from a waffle? I kicked up the cinnamon and vanilla a bit for added flavor but love the recipe as is. Sifting the flour gives that little extra fluffy airiness.

My 10 year old son is ultra picky about what he likes and he absolutely loved these waffles.  I added vanilla sugar instead of plain sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  These were a big hit in my house with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Simple, repeatable recipe.
I found that doubling the vanilla yields a waffle that doesn't even need syrup, just a little powered sugar on top.

This is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again. I love how easy it is to put together, but I would increase the amount of vanilla and maybe add some cinnamon next time. I may try to cut back a bit on the oil to see how it turns out as well, just so it is a bit healthier. This is, however, a great waffle recipe just as written. Thanks for sharing!

We love these waffles. Fast and easy recipe. The waffles are light and delicious.  I whipped egg whites to add more fluffiness.  Refrigerated extra batter and made more the next day. Just as impressed with the leftover batter. I may never use a box waffle/pancake mix again. Even our little kids love them!

I've made these several times for my family.  They always get rave reviews. I follow the recipe very closely, with the exception that usually separate the egg whites and beat them separately, folding them in at the end.  Sometimes, if I have buttermilk on hand, I will use that instead of regular milk. Either way, they turn out fabulously every time.

I do not understand some of the poor ratings for this recipe. I have been using basically the same recipe for years and it makes the best waffles! The only thing different is the method and that is to whip up the whites separately and then fold them in. This does make them very fluffy. As far as being bland..I never noticed as I use syrup on them. Today I did try one of the suggestions and used plain yogurt for half of the oil and they turned out fine. So I may do that from now on to reduce the fat content.

Light, fluffy and tasty- absolutely delicious! I only made half the recipe and substituted unsweetened almond milk, mixing recipe up in my blender. I blended the egg and almond milk first, then added the rest of the ingredients. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I thought this was a great recipe! Batter comes together in 5 minutes. With really just a tiny bit more effort than a box mix, you get results that taste 10-fold better, without all the artificial, weird ingredients.

After reading many of the reviews on this recipe, we decided to give it a go using some of the alterations. We subbed out the oil for yogurt, doubled the sugar and vanilla, added cinnamon and nutmeg. We separated the egg whites and blended them, then added the yolks, milk, yogurt, vanilla and dry ingredients. The result was incredibly thin. It would not cook, but rather burned outside and remained gooey inside. We added another 1/8 cup flour hoping to solve that, and they cooked but tasted pretty not-good.

Just made these yesterday and I will never use a mix again! it was so good! I did change one thing as my oil wasn't good....I used applesauce (same measurement). I probably won't try with oil as it even held up well in the refrigerator overnight and tasted great the this morning no mixing necessary.

Love this recipe, really easy, tasty n Light.  My only changes is double the sugar double the vanilla & a little less oil but add a pat of melted butter to the mix. Great New Years breakfast or Brunch w/ ham n eggs or just fruit in Whip Cream or a German twist just use Sour Cream w/ Powdered sugar n fruit, you'll be hooked.

Very simple recipe that makes a delicious batter. For those of you that like your waffles to be sweeter, you might want to double the sugar amount. Otherwise, this recipe is excellent and worth using as a staple of your breakfast routine :)

I used this for the second time that I made waffles in my new waffle maker.  The first time, I used the recipe that came with the waffle maker.  UGH. I almost wanted to return it.  This recipe was much better.  I'll use this recipe in the future.  The only changes I made were to double the vanilla and sugar and instead of using all vegetable oil, I used half butter and half oil.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I thought these were great. I did separate my eggs and folded the egg whites in last. They were very fluffy. My wife thought they lacked a little taste so next time I'll add more vanilla and sugar I think. I'll definitely be making theses again.

This recipe is great! Easy, fast, and the waffles are just the perfect delicious texture. Thought, I warn you to follow the recipe exactly! I have made this recipe a few times, and it seemed strange to mix flour with eggs before adding milk and other wet ingredients so I decided to mix dried and wet ingredients separately and then mix them together. Well, it didn't work: the waffles came out very starchy and bready, nothing like the first few times when I followed the order of mixing the ingredients in the recipe. So I made it again, following the mixing order from the recipe and yes! the waffles are great and yummy again! Moral of the story: stick to the recipe!

I normally don't eat waffles without a lot of syrup, but these waffles were perfect without any additional condiments.  Loved the recipe, and so did everyone else in the house.

These were the best waffles, so much that I will not even buy a mix from now on.  You do have to beat the eggs for about 8-10 minutes so they are really light.  I did increase the sugar to 1/4 cup and added it to the eggs ads I was beating them.  You have to make sure your waffle iron is very hot, and they are so light and crisp, they are just amazing!!

Great start to the recipe. Taking ideas from others - Replaced oil with applesauce, substituted 1 cup wheat flour in place of 1 cup white flour and replaced white sugar with brown sugar. Separated whites from yolk     Toppings   
Easy to make homemade whipped cream  (from 121 whipped cream recipe) freeze metal bowl for 15 minutes. Take 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and whisk until fluffy. Add 2 tbsps of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Continue whisking until the right consistency--stiff with peaks.

Frozen Organic strawberries and Organic wild boreal blueberries  grown naturally with no pesticides (trader joes)
Empty fruit into sauce pan on medium flame continuously stirring, add 1 tsp of sugar and 1/4 tsp of  salt. Heat and stir until right saucy consistency with smaller than bite size fruit pieces.

Wonderful base recipe.  I modified it to reduce some of the processed ingredients and it was super.  I subbed 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 of the cups of flour.  Used fat free buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Subbed coconut oil for vegetable oil and used 1 tablespoon of honey instead of sugar.  Also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Served with berries, and pure maple syrup.  Out of this world!

Fabulous, easy recipe I will use every time. I only had 2% milk so I subbed in 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream to make the 1-3/4 cup called for. I also had to add an extra (approx) 1/3 cup 2% after mixing everything to thin it out. I used 1/4 veg oil and 1/4 cup melted butter. Used one whole tsp pure vanilla. I have a new, Foodnetwork non-stick, 4-slice waffle iron so I did not spray the iron. Set heat to crispy and they were still tender inside. Perfect. My batter made 10 fat waffles. A small dash of cinnamon or any other seasoning (or even chocolate chips or blueberries) would work great with this recipe. Versatile. Husband said they were the best waffles he's ever eaten and my 2 young kids inhaled them. Shared with several friends!

I've made this several times now.  It's quick and easy to make.  I've made it while the family is  showering and getting read so that they can have a good breakfast before they hit the door.  I've found that a healthy half cup of batter is the right amount for my 7" waffle iron.

Great recipe. I make it with 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour that i sift. I also add a scoop (about1/4 cup) of flax seed. And to up the flavor I double the vanilla. I'll make a double batch on Sunday and save the leftover batter for a quick, healthy, hot weekday breakfast. Thanks for making my weekday morning a bit less hectic!!!

Loved the simplicity of this recipe. I mixed a couple of batches for a friend's "brinner" party (breakfast for dinner) and it was a hit. We brought over our waffle iron and set up a waffle bar. The waffles were light and fluffy. We had some leftover batter, so I stuck it in the fridge for a couple days and made pancakes with the rest. Smiles all around!

These waffles were BANGING!! I made them for my daughters sleepover and the girls couldn't get enough. However I did double my sugar and vanilla to add more flavor and I also separated my eggs. Some I left plain and a few I added cinnamon and nutmeg, both were really tasty. With syrup was really good but the strawberries and whip cream... (oooohhh baby) really kept the plates coming back for more.

The recipe turned out well, I didn't add or change anything at first but tried the waffle and it had a great texture but no taste. After some more vanilla and some cinnamon and nutmeg, it really turned into a wonderful recipe. With a little tweaking, this recipe has the potential to give you restraint quality waffles.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was bitter. The waffle wasn't fluffy at all and difficult to eat. It had a burnt taste, even though the waffles were not burnt at all. Never making these again.

This is the one I go to all the time.  It is the make ahead breakfast that we all love.  I use my own vanilla sugar, sometimes put bacon bits on the waffle iron and cook away.  Fast and easy.  Love it.

There aren't enough stars, this recipe is awesome. I use half a p flour and half wheat flour. The ingredients go together effortlessly. .I whisk my eggs in a bowl and then add the rest of the ingredients. This is a keeper,with fall approaching I am going to try canned pumpkin. I'm sure they will be awesome. Thx OneShyOfABunch for a great recipe!!!!

Hubby and I really enjoyed these!  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and upped the vanilla extract to 1 Tbsp to increase the flavor.  Took less than 5 minutes to whip this batter together. Yum!!

Delicious waffles! Woke up on a good mood and decided to use my waffle maker for the first time. I had a blast making waffles, the recipe is accurate and easy to follow, I used almond milk and added milk chocolate chips the taste was amazing!

I ran out of pancake mix, which is what I usually use to make waffles, so I thought I'd try this recipe since it had such good reviews. The taste and texture were awful. Actually, the waffles didn't have much taste at all. The recipe should have called for butter instead of oil, because they had absolutely no flavor. The texture was chewy and didn't have the nice crispy crust like the waffles I make using pancake mix. I added melted butter to the syrup so the waffles would have some flavor so that my husband and son would eat them. Waste of time and ingredients!

Mediocre waffles.  Too much baking powder leaving a sort of metallic odor during cooking and flavor when eating. .  Also not nearly as ethereal as waffles made from beating egg whites separately from the yolks.  My favorite recipe uses the same flour, three eggs separated and beaten separately, half as much fat  twice the salt. They make waffles with a super light interior and nice crunch to the outside.  These had the crunch but the inside was heavy and tasted of baking powder.

These waffles were great, and no one could tell I used white whole wheat flour! Added more vanilla and used vanilla yogurt instead of the oil. Also works with frozen blueberries and cinnamon added.

Made these for the first time this morning....absolutely delicious!  Family said they were better than a restaurants...I did follow a couple of reviewers advice....added less oil, a bit more sugar, and read that the best way to have crispy waffles but fluffy inside was to not keep lifting the lid....when the steam starts to slow down, that's when they're done....so no need to peek!  Made homemade strawberry sauce from here too, as the perfect compliment...(with whipped cream of course!) Awesome recipe....

This was great! I doubled the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I separated the egg yolks and whites and beat the whites and folded them into the batter. Yes it was an extra step and another dirty bowl but my family loved them! So I would say it was worth the extra work. The waffles were super fluffy, slightly crunchy on the outside but soft inside.  This one is a keeper!!!

I never made homemade waffles so I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sugar and vanilla, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and added just a little under 1/2c of veg oil. I didn't do anything fancy with the eggs, just followed the recipe exactly. Thank you!

This really is a fantastic basic recipe that can be customized to your hearts content, but tastes fantastic on it it own! I've now gotten in the habit of make a huge batch on the weekends, dividing it in to small batches with different things in it and making a weeks worth to freeze. No one's tired of them yet! :)

Quick and easy recipe for your basic waffle. I had the ingredients whipped together in no time--just in time for my waffle iron to be preheated! A nicely crisp waffle - nothing extravagant, good base for any toppings. I halved the recipe (milk=7 oz)and it made 2 full size belgian waffles and another one that was about 3/4.

These were good but seemed to be missing something. I'm not sure what but they seemed a little bland. They did cook up very well and were nice and fluffy. I did beat the whites separately then folded them in. Would be a very good recipe for add-in's like berries or choc chips.

I'm sorry but these waffles were not very good.  I followed the recipe exactly which is unusual for me and no one liked them.  Hubby said the tasted like waffles from the toaster.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Excellent.  The only thing I did differently was to use coconut oil and I tripled the vanilla and sugar.  YUMMY.  I've been using a store bought mix for years, I had no idea waffles could be so good.  :) I will use this recipe forever!

Awesome recipe! After reading the reviews doubled the recipe increasing the sugar to 1.5 Tbsp. 2 Tsp. vanilla.  I used 1/2 the oil, 1.5 cups of flour and added 1/4 cup quick cooking oatmeal,(if you double the original recipe as I do 2/3 cup of quick cooking oatmeal)2/3 cup walnuts, pecans and almonds gound fine.  I added 1/3 cup of Trader Joes Powdered Hemp Protein.
Used Xtra Large eggs and also beat the whites separately.  I used 1/2 soy milk and 1/2 coconut milk.  I've also substituted water by 1/2 for lesser calories.  Just blew it right out of the park I tells Ya!!!  These tasted like authentic Belgium waffles! A real hit!!! I need to clarify, so sorry, the nut quantity is for the double recipe.  Please double all previous ingredients to that if you want to attempt my version...didn't mean to confuse people.

Was ok. My son is used to waffles made from buttermilk pancake mix, but I wanted improvement. I really don't feel these were an improvement. He obviously didn't either, since he didn't want to finish a single waffle. Usually he'll down 2-3. Bland flavor and wished they were crispier on the outside. I will keep looking.

This is absolutely the perfect waffle recipe to me.  I originally got it from my old Betty Crocker cookbook and am glad it's posted here so I can print it out instead of getting sticky fingerprints all over my cookbook!  The only change I make is to use melted butter instead of the oil, or use half oil, half butter.  I cook them until the waffle iron stops steaming so they are crisp on the outside and light and airy inside.  They hold up to any syrup without getting soggy or limp.  They are just perfect and my family begs me to make them on weekends.  We love them with syrup or fresh fruit or blueberry compote.

This recipe makes a crispy waffle, no doubt about it.  But there's no chew in the middle.  They would make a decent ice cream base, but I found the flavour lacking, even with a generous pour of vanilla.  I'd make them again in a pinch, but I'd play with the recipe a bit to find a balance between crisp and outright crunchy.

This was a great recipe!  The only change I made was using melted butter in place of the vegetable oil and cooking spray.  I only made the substitution because I was out of vegetable oil, but after tasting the results it's a keeper.  Other reviews suggested adding more sugar.  In my opinion the amount in the recipe is perfect.  After all you're going to douse the waffle in syrup!

These are good waffles, but a little bland. I doubled the recipe and added 1.5 cups pumpkin instead of doubling oil. I added more vanilla, cinnamon and a couple tsp. brown sugar.

Hands down the best waffle batter.  Ever.  'Nough said.

I trick it out for my family by doubling the recipe, using 3c white whole wheat flour and 1c all purpose flour, a generous dollop of vanilla, and 2 huge tablespoons of sugar. Yum.

Good basic recipe- I liked the crispness it had on the outside, but it tasted like something was missing flavorwise. Maybe using buttermilk instead of regular milk may help that. I did double the sugar and vanilla and I beat the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end like some other reviewers did. I did add chocolate chips to the last half of the batter- that made them very tasty!

Great! First batch I made as written and it was a 'bit' bland.  Second batch I made with cinnamon and blueberries.  Light, fluffy and delicious!

great basic and easy waffle recipe.  The sugar and vanilla add a nice touch of sweetness to the waffles.

These were pretty good as far as taste goes - I didn't seem to have the same problem as others had with the bitter baking powder taste.  I haven't quite found the perfect waffle recipe.  I added orange marmalade and some semisweet chocolate chips to half the batter, and those were pretty tasty, but as a whole, the waffles were dry.  :-\

This recipe is very easy and simple. the waffles turned out great and fluffy. i dont buy waffle mix anymore. I just measure the dry ingredients for a few batches in each ziplock. the day i make the waffles just take a ziplock of waffles mix and add the wet ingredients to it and it is easy peasy.
Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good!  Like others I adjusted the sugar and vanilla by doubling it.  I did not double the salt because I didnt know whether I was suppose to.  I also added1/4tsp of cinnamon.  Like other people said adding the cinnamon does make a real difference,you can really taste it throughout, however I will try it next time without the cinnamon because not everyone likes that flavor.  With the cinamon though I felt like I should have added apples, i think that would have tasted pretty good also.  All and all a great recipe.  Reminded me of an EGO also like others have said.  An all around great recipe!  Will make again.

These tasted like baking powder to me, the recipe calls for far too much to be palatable. The addition of Maple Syrup did not help. They are light and fluffy but they did not absorb the butter and syrup well. Will not make these again.

I'll blame my cheap $5 waffle iron for taking 30 minutes per waffle, but even so, the batter was pretty bland. Maybe a little more salt?

I just finished making these a few minutes ago because I just bought a new waffle maker and I had to rate them 5 stars because it was so easy and delicious! I do recommend adding 1 tsp of cinnamon, double the vanilla and the sugar. I used splenda and they were just great.Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is an excellent batter recipe! I cut the oil down to 1/4 c. and also added fresh blueberries. We ran our batter through the magic bullet (broke down lumps) right before pouring it onto the waffle iron. Everyone loved them!

I just made these with my girls and it was very easy to make. I had never tried making waffles before and I have to say I am very happy with this recipe. I do have to add though that once everything is mixed you should let it sit for about 10 min before baking it. I have an old waffle iron and it baked up in 5 minutes flat. I added mini chocolate chips to them and they are very delicious. My girls are asking me to make more already. I froze some of the leftovers and will pop them in the toaster for breakfast. Thanks for the great recipe!

The texture was good, but they were lacking in flavor. I found myself adding a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla to help.

5 stars for taste, simplicity and ease of use.  I prepared this batter the evening before and only needed to heat the waffle iron this morning.  I followed the recipe exactly and was quite pleased with the results.  Tasted great with fresh fruit and syrup!

These were delicious!  I added 1 tbs brown sugar and a little cinnamon as others recommended, and they came out perfect.  Light and fluffy.  Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 since I modified it.

Followed directions and made Belgium waffles. They turned out tender and fluffy. It wasn't as sweet, but I guess that's what syrup's for. Will make this again. Thanks!

This is wonderful!  We thought the taste was perfect.  We did throw in some chopped pecans for fun but they are not needed.  I also tossed in a bit of extra flour (maybe a tablespoon) as I thought it might be too thin.  I also didn't add the full amount of oil because of calorie concerns.

Fantastic and easy. I did seperate the eggs and then gently folded in the whipped whites. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is. They turned out fluffy on the inside and crispy brown on the outside.

Super yummy and super easy.  I just mixed all the ingredients in a blender for a few minutes and cooked in my waffle iron.  Slap some peanut butter and syrup on these babies and you're golden.  I love this recipe!

I followed the advice in the comments and whipped my egg whites separately and folded in and the texture was great. I also doubled the sugar and put in an entire pack of vanilla sugar (aprox 2 tsp) and I put in a whole teaspoon of salt.
Still not a yeast recipe but quite yummy!

I give it four stars because it was bland, but the clean up was very easy, great measurements! I did double some of the ingredients, however my husband it tasted like bread with no flavor, but I actually thought that it was good and lite on my stomach.

Very good flavor, they were a little heavy to me but the taste was wonderful, next time I will beat the eggs longer and sift the flour first.

delicious waffles.  the texture is perfect, slightly crispy on the outside, light and fluffy inside.  i usually make the whole batch, then refrigerate the leftovers (if there are any).  break them apart and they heat up beautifully in the toaster for a quick before work breakfast.  thanks for the great recipe!

I've been making these waffles for a year and a half, and somehow whenever I made them, my wife slept in that morning.  Tonight however, we did breakfast for dinner at our church, feeding 40 people, and only 2 left over waffles!!!  People came back for seconds and thirds!  The only modification we made was to use bread flour instead of all-purpose.  Many people requested the recipe, saying they're better than waffle house waffles.

Not bad at all!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon as others did, but next time I'll also take the suggestions and add a little more vanilla and sugar.  These freeze great and fit right in the toaster for an easy breakfast.  Love it!  No more store-bought frozen waffles!  Also, try substituting brown sugar for half of the white sugar... AMAZING!!  UPDATE (5/31/12):  I have made this recipe numerous times since my initial review and I can say I am done looking for a perfect waffle recipe, this is it!  I continue to add cinnamon to the batter, but I also double the salt, vanilla & sugar.  These cook up beautifully... I make a double or triple batch when I cook these and freeze a bunch of them.  They heat up perfect in the toaster for a fast morning breakfast.  A definite winner!!

I wanted these to be great, as many of you thought they were.  The consistency was good, they cooked great.  But only tasted good.  I expected them to taste better I guess.  And I did add more sugar and vanilla.

Delicious! I made this egg free and it was yummy!!!
I just put everything in the bowl and used the electric whisk. Really quick to make. 

I'll be making these again. I served ours with fresh strawberries, banana slices and vanilla ice cream. I put a little bandy butter on the waffles just because we still have some left over from Christmas ;)

First attempt at waffles from scratch and this recipe was very easy and tasted delicious.  I only got 4 waffles and not 6, not sure why.  This is a keeper for me and I will play around with it for sure!!

Made these exact per recipe. Doubled the amount and each morning I put a pre-cooked waffle back in the waffle iron for a couple minutes and it tastes like when I first made it.

Excellent base with great consistency.  Will probably add a bit more sugar and vanilla, perhaps some cinnamon and nutmeg in the winter.

These are great waffles. I made sure to beat the eggs on high with my hand mixer for at least three minutes to ensure the eggs were very fluffy before adding in the rest of the ingredients. I like my waffles sweet so I  added more sugar and put in cinnamon and almond extract. This recipe is a keeper.

I just got a waffle maker and decided to try making these. I doubled the vanilla according to others and used buttermilk instead of regular since I ran out of regular. They were great! Absolutely perfect! Will make again.

Followed recipe except added 1 tsp vanilla. Recipe was just okay-nothing too exciting. Definitely works for a recipe to come back to if I want something quick and easy, but I will continue the search for the perfect, most delicious waffle:)

These were allright. A little cakey, but good nonetheless. I was gifted with a Belgian waffle iron for Christmas. Looking for a basic waffle recipe to try out on my new gadget, I stumbled upon OneShy's posting on here. 




Although my hubby and I thought these were good, we both feel I should continue my search for a waffle recipe that better suits us. Thanks to top reviewer fxer, I doubled the sugar / vanilla. I'm glad I did 
because these were just sweet enough for us (without doubling these two ingredients, our waffles likely would have been too bland). I did not, however, beat my egg whites / yolks separately. One thing to note: The user's manual that came with my waffle iron includes a few waffle recipes, one of them a basic one. My hubby and I both noticed that the basic batter recipe does NOT call for eggs (nor do any of the other recipes - they all build off the basic recipe). I'm led to believe that the addition of eggs in OneShy's recipe gave our waffles the texture we didn't care for. My verdict? Overall, this is a nice, basic waffle recipe, but there are others out there I'd rather try. Thanks anyways OneShyOfABunch! :-)

I made the recipe exactly as stated, and it just wasn't very good.  The mixes I have taste better (and I'm not even a fan of mixes).  I think part of the problem is that waffles taste better when you use butter.  Vegetable oil just doesn't taste as good.

I followed this recipe exactly and it didn't come out well at all.  Absolutely no taste.  Maybe next time I will try what others suggested and add more sugar and some cinnamon and/or nutmeg; however I will probably just find a new recipe instead.  They looked pretty but I'd prefer waffles that I don't have to drown in maple syrup in order to eat them.

Very good and easy. My husband and I really enjoyed these. I did make them with whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. ADDED review April 2011: I still love this recipe. This time I used unsweetened almond milk and stayed with using WW Flour. Tasted great.

Simple and delicious. We have a waffle iron with four separate wells and we were able to use all the batter and make 8 waffles. The waffles are so light and filling. Thank you for sharing!

this recipe got a big thumbs down in our house. I think all the wet ingredients need to be added before the dry, so that was part of the problem, but there was also no flavor, even though I added more sugar and vanilla.

Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, slightly sweet.  Used a blender to mix ingredients.  Only downside --> could taste the baking powder in some bites.  Not sure why as everything was very well mixed.  May reduce the baking powder slightly next time.

The over all waffle was ok. The texture of these was pretty good. I cooked them in a Belgian waffle maker and they had a great color. I added double sugar and some cinnamon but still even when it was done they tasted to much like flour :-( I was kind of disappointing seeing as how it had such great reviews

This is the perfect recipe for waffles! It is definitely worth the time to separate the egg whites and beat them, then fold them in at the end. They come out fluffy, crispy, and amazing, even in my 7 dollar Target waffle maker! thanks for the recipe!

I was extremely disappointed, considering the high rating.  The first time I made this recipe, I followed it to a "T" and it was soooo bland.  There was literally no taste.  I always try to give recipes with great ratings another try, so on my second attempt I doubled the sugar and the vanilla and still didn't care for it.  My boyfriend liked them, but he doesn't know what good waffles taste like.  I had better tasting waffles using Bisquick!

The first time I made this, my husband thought the batter was too thin for waffles.  So, the next time, I made them as pancakes.  We add chocolate chips to it and it is a light and sweet pancake.

Very fab- very easy.  Tried to make mine in blender like others suggested -but their blenders must be bigger than mine!  I added 4 tbsp sugar, and shook in some cinnamon and nutmeg too.  They were awesome and easy!!

YUM!  Doubled the sugar and vanilla as recommeded and these turned out perfect!  Topped with fresh berries - didn't need much syrup since they had a nice flavor on their own.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow morning!

This is a great basic waffle recipe! Very light and fluffy. It also makes a perfect base recipe for customizing. I made it following the recipe the first time, and then played with it a second time. I used whole wheat flour, and substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup of the oil. I also doubled the vanilla, added another teaspoon of sugar, and added a tablespoon of cinnamon. To combat the heaviness of the whole wheat flour I beat the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end. The result was a hearty and delicious waffle that was still light and moist! I loved the added flavor and texture, so I made a triple batch today and froze them.

As it is written the recipe is good but it could be better.  The second time I made this I made it more healthy and in my opinion that makes it better.  I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 of applesauce.  I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 2 Tbs. of ground flax seed (this provides omega 3's).  Also, these taste better well cooked until crispy.

Easy and tasty.  I swapped one cup of all-purpose flour for a cup of whole wheat flour, and subbed applesauce for the oil, plus added some blueberries.  They come out great.  I make a big batch and freeze them for my kids to eat during the week.  They love them!

I hate to give such a highly rated recipe a bad rating, but these were terribly bland and required extensive doctoring to taste decent. A good waffle recipe should stand on its own and not have to have a ton of things added. I'm giving the recipe two stars for being fluffy.

These waffles are wonderful. My family can't get enough of these. They are a breakfast favorite. Thank you so much for the recipe. I also added 1 tsp. brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as suggested and it just added to the perfection of the recipe. Thanks again!

I have been looking for a recipe for waffles for a long time, without having to separate the eggs and whip the egg whites.  I just wanted something easy.  I did follow other reviewers hints and double the sugar and vanilla.  I don't think I will do that next time, a little on the sweet side for me.  I know that it will be perfect written as is the next time.  I served these this morning with Sauteed Apples from this site by 356, and I knew I was in food heaven.  I will freeze the extra waffles I made and toast for a quick breakfast.   Since I was on a roll this morning, I decided to mix up another batch, BUT, just mixed the dry and ingredients together.  I put these in a tightly sealed jar and everything will be ready the next time I make waffles so as to save some time.  These were so light and fluffy.  No more boxed mix for me, way too expensive now a days and it doesn't even compare to how delicious these are.  Thanks a bunch Oneshyofabunch!!!  Love the recipe!!

I made this for my mom and brother for dinner. It was really easy to make and was done within 30 minutes. Served with some grits and scrambled eggs, it was a delicious 30 minute dinner. I really loved that it didn't have the hassle of yeast. The waffles were fluffy and and cooked pretty quickly. I made them with a Waring Pro waffle maker and they were great! Thanks!

These were good. I added some chocolate chips to each waffle after I poured the batter on the waffle iron and served them with syrup and peanut butter for a fun breakfast for the kids. Would make these again.

Don't over-beat...they will turn out flat if you do.  When I made them a second time, I didn't over-beat and they were light and fluffy! They taste way better than the pancake mix in a box.

I refused to make homemade waffles until I used this recipe!  It is delicious and makes wonderful waffles.  I use only whole wheat flour when I make them and they turn out beautifully.

This must be rated good because it is a recipe that you can play with. But by it's self it is bland, bland, bland. Tastes like baking powder and flour.

A good basic recipe that was easy to prepare.  I did increase the amount of sugar as we like our waffles sweeter and doubled the vanilla.  Perhaps I cooked the waffles for too long but I found them quite tough and crunchy.  Next time I'll definitely cut down on the cooking time.

A great waffle recipe for us.  It was easy and tasty.  The kids liked it with a little syrup.  My husband and I enjoyed them straight up - no butter or anything.  We did, however, add some chocolate chips, so I'm sure that helped!  The changes I made were minor and as follows: 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour; 1 tsp vanilla; 2 tbsp cinnamon sugar.  Once the batter was in the belgian waffle maker, I sprinkled chocolate chips on top.  I left them in a little extra long to get them crispier since that's how I like them.

This was a decent recipe, but a little flavor-less.  I would at the very least use some more sugar if I made it again, or maybe add a banana.

Oh so excellent! Best recipe I've tried so far with whole wheat flour! nice, crispy, light. We like chocolate chips so I added 1 cup to my batter. Needed no non-stick spray on my non-stick waffle maker.

My husband and I loved these. I followed the first step, put all the dry ingredients in one bowl, put that into the eggs along with the milk and oil and that's all! creamy texture. It thought it may have been too thin, but it wasn't, it was perfect! Served with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, syrup and a little butter ball (melon scooper). Delicious!

Very good recipe. I separated the eggs as some users recommended. Cripy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. The flavor needed to be a little sweeter, I will double the sugar and vanilla next time.

Easy and delicious. At least once a week, my hubby asks for me to make a batch. He especially loves blueberry waffles. Blueberries that are frozen are very convenient. I suggest sprinkling the thawed/drained blueberries after pouring the batter in the waffle maker. That way the blueberries or any other topping will be distributed evenly in the waffle rather than in clumps.

Before I found this, I was using the recipe on the Bisquick box. Bleah.

I made some modifications to this recipe. I used whole-wheat graham flour, liquid egg whites, powdered nonfat milk, kosher salt, and Sugar in the Raw (cane sugar.) I used 2.5 tablespoons of cane sugar, since the graham flour is a little bitter and cane sugar isn't quite the same as white. The result is tasty, delicious, and uber-healthy. :D Top them with some (homemade) cinnamon applesauce and you'll be in breakfast heaven.

I didn't stick the leftover batter in the fridge. Instead, I used it all at once and put a batch of waffles in the freezer. During the week I can just pop a couple waffles in the toaster and go. Yay, freezerwaffles!

Very good! I had some buttermilk I wanted to use up, so I used that instead of regular, I also cut the baking powder in half and doubled the sugar and vanilla.  They were very good. Next time I may increase the sugar and vanilla even more, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of sugar.  I think that would make them just perfect! Oh, almost forgot. I made a batch with chocolate chips and they were incredible as well! 9/22, I made again only a lower cal version, applesause instead of oil, skim milk, egg beaters.  Blah!  No flavor at all what so ever.  So my kids would eat them I put a ton of butter, syrup, and powdered sugar on them to try and hide the flavorless mess I made.  I luv these waffles, and I'll make again, just not the low cal way.

Very good waffle recipe!  I used half whole wheat flour and half regular unbleached flour and as others recommended, increased the sugar to 2 Tablespoons and increased the Vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  I also used buttermilk in place of the regular milk.  Really yummy!

Best waffles I've ever had, especially given how easy they are!  I followed other's advice and doubled the vanilla and sugar, and added 1 tsp cinnamon, and I sifted all the dry ingredients together. Also I separated the egg whites, beat them, then folded them in the mixture last.  I  also used vanilla paste (Trader Joe's) instead of regular vanilla syrup.  Don't open the waffle maker until the steam stops!  Finished everything off with some fresh sliced strawberries and powdered sugar.

I thought the batter was a too thin per the instructed measurements, so I added about 1/4-1/2 c. more flour. Plus a little more sugar and some cinnamon. Tasted great though, and came out crisp on the out side, fluffy on the inside. All in all a staple recipe for the breakfast table.

Great recipe... the only one you'll ever need. Unless you love the taste of baking powder, you'll want to reduce the amount from 4 tsp to 2.5 tsp... they'll still come out perfect. A+ recipe otherwise; no need to adjust any other ingredient.

A great recipe! I made these today and they were delicious. Followed the exact recipe. They were crispy outside soft inside. I wanted a recipe that didn't involve beating the egg whites separately,and this did the trick. Thanks.

Great recipe! One of the best I've tried so far. I ended up doubling the sugar & vanilla extract and adding some cinnamon. Plus I used butter instead of vegetable oil. They turned out so yummy!

We found the recipe as is, a little bland.  Therefore, I made a few changes:
- double the sugar (2 Tablespoons)
- double the vanilla (2 teaspoons)
- added another egg white
- 1/8 cup of maple syrup     
- couple dashes of cinnamon

This is now a breakfast, and sometimes dinner, favorite.  We love to top it off with Strawberries & whipped cream!

I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose, doubled the sugar and vanilla, and used 1% buttermilk instead of regular milk. It was fast and easy and they turned out great, everyone in the family was happy!

This is the absolutely best waffle recipe!  Like some of the other reviewers, I doubled the amount of sugar & vanilla.  I didn't think these changes made the waffles too sweet.  My husband said these tasted like the ice cream waffle cones.  Use full amount of baking powder if you like nice fluffy waffles.  This will be the one waffle recipe in our household. :D

This recipe is excellent.  Although I did half the baking powder portion as other people recommended and double the vanilla and sugar just to satisfy my sweet tooth a bit more.  The batter was initially discouraging because it was so runny, but I was wrong.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These are the BEST waffles any of my crew has ever eaten, and we have tried a LOT of them.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and doubled the sugar and vanilla, used buttermilk, and beat the eggwhites separately.  These are amazingly delicious, and we just cannot get enough of them.  Delicious afterwards heated in the toaster.

Very good recipe. I added 1/2 t cinnamon to the mix and use 1/2 whole wheat pasty flour + 1/2 all purpose flour instead of just using white flour. My husband loved these waffles and said they smelled heavenly while they were cooking. Thank you! The recipe makes about 6 medium waffles.

This is an exceptional recipe.  I made a double batch of whole wheat waffles, and the kids will get waffles this weekend too.  They loved these waffles. Add a little pecans or chocolate chips for a variation.  We topped them with berries and whipped cream.  Yummy!

These waffles turned out great!  My waffle iron can only cook two waffles at a time, so I kept them warm in the oven until the whole batch was cooked.  They stayed nice and crisp, and were extremely light.  My whole family loved them.  I did use a wisk instead of a hand mixer, and I sifted the dry ingredients together before mixing them into the wet ingredients.

This has become the favorite waffle recipe at my house.  It is quick, easy, and they have always turned out perfectly for me.  I increase the sugar to 2 tablespoons and the vanilla to 1 tsp.  The batter does keep very well all week in the fridge so it is easy for my teenage boys to fix a waffle themselves.  Thanks for taking the time to share the recipe with us.

I was upset this moring...I woke up and wanted waffles and had no mix.  So, allrecipes came to the rescue.  These turned out well.  I did like these, but they were not my favorite.  It didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.  I do think I would use this recipe again in a pinch...but tinker to get more flavor.  Thank you for the post.

There are not enough stars for this one!!  If you are looking for a crispy waffle and looking for ingrediants basic to almost every kitchen, this one is for you!  I have tried almost every waffle recipe that I have in my cookbooks with very sorry results:(  This one came out fluffy and crisp, just the way my family likes them!  They would be great for those of you who have heard of the Pennsylvania Dutch Recipe Chicken and Waffles, leaving out the vanilla. (several recipes of this dish are on the net if you don't know what it is and are curious!)  This one is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Ultra B!

These were pretty good waffles.  My kids ate them right up, and my 3-year-old is really picky.  We added a little cinnamon for my kids, and they really loved them.  I am not a big breakfast person, and I still thought they were good.

I made the waffles with half whole wheat flour and half white flour, and substituted some water for the milk and some shortening for part of the butter. It was only because I ran out of milk and butter/margarine.  I loved them. My friend Sam Coleman said they were decent, but he's overly critical.

These waffles come out great. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. But they are VERY bland. No flavor whatsoever. They basically taste like flour.  Drowning them in syrup doesn't even really help.

This waffle recipe without any doubts is the best one I have ever used ever! Waffles came out light and literally melted in my mouth. Followed the recipe exactly. Like another waffle recipe on this site, I did warm up the milk. Even noticed the batter was lump free and poured evenly (batter was in a pitcher). Of course as a true Canadian I used real maple syrup to finish it off. Anybody using the "fake" non- syrup stuff should be locked up and keys thrown away. Shameful people I say!

Delicious! The real secret to a light, fluffy batter is to let it rest for at least ten minutes after you mix all the ingredients together.  I watch for small bubbles on top then I know it's ready.  I read the other reviews and doubled the vanilla, the sugar, and the baking powder. My husband and I loved them!

We loved these waffles!  The batter is so easy to make.  It came together in less than 10 minutes.  I combined all wet ingredients together with a hand mixer first, then whisked the flour (half all purpose and half whole wheat) and baking powder in.  The waffles were light and fluffy with a nice subtle vanilla flavor.  This recipe will become part of our weekend rotation.  Thank you for sharing!

Easy, cooked up perfectly.  This is an easy recipe to use as-is or to fancy up with your own twist  with a variety of add ins:  cinnamon, pumpkin spice, chopped apple w/cinnamon&sugar,, bannana, or try adding  cooked sausage or crumbled bacon w/some grated sharp cheddar.  This is my go to when waffles are requested.   I either make the basic or add in what I have on hand that would jazz it up a bit.

I substituted brown sugar for the white, applesauce for the oil and almond extract for the vanilla. The best waffles I have ever made!!! Crispy and light and chewy!! A double batch would be better for feeding our family of 6. Perfect, perfect waffles!!

Usually I use a box mix for waffles but didn't have any.  These are soooo good.  My child wanted apple cinnamon waffles,  so I substituted 3/4 cup of milk with unsweetened apple sauce and added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/4tsp of nutmeg. Delicious and easy to make.

I made this for the first time and added 1 tsp light brown sugar per previous reviews' recommendations as well as whipped the egg whites seperately andfolded them into the batter. The waffles were a HUGE hit! They came out perfect - slightly crisp on the outside and light fluffy texture inside. 

We had too many and froze the extra - I toasted a couple the next day and they were just as delicious!

Fantastic recipe !  Second time around I followed the advice here in the reviews and whipped the egg whites as well as adding more sugar, vanilla and a touch of cinnamon.  Both ways still produced a great waffle. Thanks for the recipe m!

This is a good basic recipe. I separated the egg whites and yolks and beat the whites separately as recommended, before adding. I used 3 tsp vanilla. added 1/2 tsp cinnamon but will likely add less next time. Used 2 T brown sugar and 2 T white sugar. We topped with whipped cream, blueberries, blueberry syrup. Had some blackberries too. May experiment next time with banana, applesauce,  butterscotch or toffee bits, etc..

I made these for the first time today and they were GREAT!!! I usually tweek recipes as I go along but I didn't do much to this one.  Instead of the teaspoon of vanilla, I added a big GLUG of vanilla.  LOL.  We love vanilla.  Oh, and more sugar.  I doubled the recipe so we'd have more than enough for everyone.  THIS IS A KEEPER.

I made these this morning. After reading a couple of reviews I decided to go ahead and separate the eggs and whip the whites first. Huge difference from other waffle recipes! Crispy outside, light and fluffy inside - just like at the restaurant - maybe even better! Kids topped with whipped cream - served with fruit and bacon. Will definitely be making this again!

I've made waffles dozens of times in the past year and love this recipe! These are my couple tips I've found. First, don't do only oil! Gives them absolutely NO taste. Seriously. Sub in a few tablespoons of melted butter instead and then add a capful of oil to still get them crispy! 

Second,  I like the waffle iron on a higher setting to get the waffles crispy. I would serve off the iron as they do go soft fairly fast.

I've been using this recipe for about a year now and it is always a hit. I have always followed it without any alterations and the waffles come out slightly lacking in flavor, but excellent when it comes to texture. I use real maple syrup and once it's on, the lack of flavor isn't an issue. I shoild also add that I sift all of the dry ingredients into a large bowl before adding the wet ingredients. 

I read the reviews and saw that people suggested adding cinnamon (1tsp.) and more vanilla (1 tsp.) to increase the taste. I tried it tonight and wow! They were delicious! My kids loved them too. I also added just a pinch of nutmeg as well and that flavor came through as well. With the alterations, I can use less syrup and still get an amazing taste.

I have been searching for a good waffle recipe for my new waffle iron, and this one is THE one! They cooked perfectly and my family loved them. I especially like that I can make a big batch and keep the extra batter in the refrigerator all week for an easy, make-your-own breakfast all week long. I made the batter in my blender and stored the extra  in the jar. Anyone who wants waffles just pulls it from the fridge, gives it a quick whirl and pours the batter into the hot griddle. Superb!

Wow oh wow! Talk about the best, most perfect waffle recipe! I added a Tbs of malt (malted milk) because that is the trick I learned years ago from Waffle House that makes them smell and sort of taste like cookies. But this was the perfect texture, which is extremely important to me, as well as the perfect blend of ingredients and their proportions. SOOO thrilled that I found this recipe. Thank you so much.

5+++++ I love this recipe. I made It exactly like it said and it turned out yummy for me. I used cheap  Aldi flour, store brand sugar (probably beets) , and decent fresh oil (seriously- stop using rancid oil).

I made it exactly as recipe stated. It is perfect! My husband likes them a little crispy outside and soft & fluffy inside such as these are. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe with ingredients around the house. I agree you should separate and and beat the egg whites then fold in at the end.  Fluffier batter.  Also substituted 1 tbsp butter with 1/4 cup yogurt for part of oil, and added more vanilla than recipe called for (or use vanilla yogurt). Came out great. We often freeze extras (layer with wax paper and place in ziplock bag) for easy toasted breakfast during the week.

I have four growing boys and they love these!  I double the serving size and then freeze them for those busy mornings.  As others have stated my waffle iron sat un-used for years until I found this recipe.

I love this recipe. 
Most recently I made fried chicken and waffles. I used this waffle recipe and added 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno and 1.5 tsp of scallions. It came out really good.

Best waffle recipe ever! I did however make two minor changes: 1 1/4 tsp Vanilla and I separated the egg whites and yolks then whipped the egg whites to soft peaks and folded them gently into the rest of the batter. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe. I have been looking a long time for the perfect waffle and here it is.

Delicious as is, but the second batch I doubled and tweeked. I replaced the oil with pureed peach cups (2) and 1.5 teaspoons vanilla. Best waffles ever!
*Update* Best waffles ever. Between batches, batter doubles. Added 2 T melted butter and pureed peaches to triple batch. Fabulous. *Update* Replace oil/butter with two ripe bananas thrown in while beating the eggs. Ultra creamy texture without banana flavor.

Made the recipe exactly as posted. The waffles were light and fluffy, however, something was missing. The flavor was flat. I'm not sure I'll make them again. I'll definitely look for a different recipe.

Don't overbeat the batter, doesn't matter if it looks lumpy and weird the waffles will turn out just fine.

I used butter instead of oil.

I made this recipe as written and the waffles were the best ever.  Even my son said they were better than normal. I used to use the ready made box stuff but not anymore. These were just as easy and so much better. Thank you for this keeper.

I thought I made a mistake somewhere because my batter was so runny... but the waffles cooked to perfection.  They looked beautiful- but they tasted very "eggy".  The kids ate them, but said they were gritty and asked if I put corn meal in them!  I guess I'll keep looking....

These were the worst waffles I have ever made. Very egg-y. I couldn't get my kids to eat even when i let them smother them in syrup  & whipped cream. I thought they were exaggerating so I tried.  They were bad.

This was easy and super good! I doubled the recipe to feed 5 of us, and I have a turnable waffle maker. I had very little left over. Lots of compliments from family. 
I also ran out of syrup and made that from scratch using AR. I can't believe I haven't been making my own syrup all along.

Used the dough blade on my Ninja instead of a hand mixer - that made them even easier to make. This was fantastic, especially topped by the Sauteed Apples  (recipe on this site).  The waffles were light and fluffy, and sweet without any topping. We didn't need to add butter or drown in syrup, and everyone wanted seconds that they were too full to finish!

My family loved these! I know that this recipe will get a lot of use in my home, it's definitely a keeper. We like that these waffles have some body to them so they hold up to the syrup without getting soggy as some other waffles do.  The flavor was great, too. Thanks for the recipe!

Great! I made a gluten free version of these by using 2.5 cups gf flour mix. I got a perfect waffle, crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy inside. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great simple waffle recipe that I enjoyed using. Several reviewers commented that they beat the egg whites separately, but I was specifically looking for a recipe that didn't require so many steps and the dirtying of extra bowls. Waffles came out fluffy just like my family likes them.

A good recipe, but not exceptional. The texture and weight works (though one can easily reduce the 4t baking powder to 3 at no loss). The flavor is rather plain. I might try more vanilla and perhaps brown sugar or a touch of molasses next time.

Made with 1:1 gluten-free flour mix, added extra milk to thin out. Also electric blender after all ingredients were added to eggs.  I had to use butter in grill due to no butter in recipe to avoid sticking to waffle grill.

After skimming a few reviews, I seperated my egg whites, whipped them, & folded in at the end; doubled the white sugar, and tripled the vanilla (because my family and I really LOVE vanilla).  These came out so delicious I won't try another recipe!  First time using the waffle iron too! Highly recommend.  No leftovers.  Definitely serve hot! I like melted butter, powdered sugar, and a little whipped cream.

I added cinnamon and a bit more vanilla extract. The batter is almost as good as the waffle itself.

1/2 cup multi grain flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1 cup all purpose, 2 cups skin milk. Whip eggs separately, mix other ingredients then add eggs to batter (keeps the batter fluffy). Don't forget the brown sugar and cinnamon!

I couldn't find my waffle recipe card that I've used for years so i searched online hoping to find a decent recipe.  I used 4 tbsp of sugar because of some reviews claiming it needed more.  I absolutely loved this recipe they turned out perfect.

I just finished making these waffles and I don't know how this recipe got so many good reviews because these waffles were not good.  They were very bland and flavorless - it was like eating cooked flour.  At best, I would use this as an experimental recipe to develop better waffles.  Sorry.  :(

This was just ok. It was pretty quick to prepare but it wasn't delicious. I followed the recipe except I doubled the sugar and vanilla and threw in a little bit of cinnamon and subbed whole wheat flour for AP flour. Despite the additional things I added/doubled, the taste was surprisingly bland. And I think subbing whole wheat flour was a bad idea. Next time, I'll try AP and see if it turns out more tender.

2.9.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22180/waffles-i/ ... 'Pretty much followed the recipe.  :o  :D  As suggested by a review, subbed with melted butter - well, half melted butter, half oil - & I decreased it to 1/4c - so 2T each.  Next time, I'll go for all melted butter.  'Didn't feel like opening a bag of flour so the last few Ts of flour were whole wheat.  I added 3/4t imitation vanilla to give a creamy flavor vs vanilla (which I am sincerely in love with both).  I was told by S that these were better than the previous recipe (Waffles II by RAZZ_BRRY_JAM), which was years ago.  Hmmmm.  E didn't say anything, but had three.  :)  These are crispy without being hard.  (It's happened.)  Tender inside.  Note:  They'll stick if not greased well (duh), but also if it's not preheated.  'Done when steaming nearly ceases.  This made 11 waffles on my two-waffles-per-batch maker.

We liked these. I substituted 1/2 of the oil for applesauce and used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I had to add an additional 1/3 c of flour, though, because the batter for me anyway, we a little too runny. turned out great! will make again!

This recipe was okay. The batter was thick and my waffles did not rise very much, but I attribute that to my making adjustments. I only added 2 tsp of baking powder in lieu of all the complaints that 4 was too much. I also upped the sugar to 2 1/2 TBSP of sugar, and added some cinnamon.

Good recipe with the following tweaks:

-  Added 1/2 TB sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon
-  Whisked egg whites until very fluffy then folded them into the mixed batter at the end

The result were waffles that were very crisp but light.  Certainly there are other recipes that add butter and loads of sugar, and therefore calories, but I wanted a more healthy option and this one was perfect.  It made about 12 3"x3" waffles, eight of which are now frozen to be reheated for my daughter.  

All around a very good recipe and one that isn't overly loaded with calorie bloat.  I will make them again.

Perfect waffles!  I have tried numerous recipes and this recipe is the perfect balance for crispy on outside and fluffy on inside.  I added an additional teaspoon of baking powder and used 1/4 cup of canola oil instead if the 1/2 cup vegetable oil.

My family loves ths recipe! We also use it for pancakes and they come out so nice and light! I also love that I can keep it in the fridge and use it during the week OR make them ahead of time and freeze them. Then in the morning, just pop them in the toaster oven.

I halved the recipe and used spelt flour and 1/2 smashed ripe banana instead of any sugar. I also used warm water and not milk--the result was a perfectly sweet cake-like waffle (the halved recipe made two waffles) . Yum!

BEST Recipe Ever with minor changes and that's more my personal taste....I doubled the sugar,and used coconut oil(melted in microwave). My husband likes to add chocolate chips and or blueberries.I also only used 3 tsp of baking powder(I really don't think you need 4)and a little less milk.You don't want your batter too runny.

Great recipe. I saw the review of FXER and applied what they did. 
Folding the egg whites made the batter and ultimately the waffle light and fluffy.
I also changed the sugar. I used 3 1/2 - 4 tablespoons of sugar. 
I also changed the vanilla extract.  I used 1 Teaspoon (I let it overflow just a drop or two ??)
I mixed the ingredients like I make chocolate chip cookies :
-  I mixed the egg yolks with the sugar. 
- Then, I added the milk, then the oil. Please note that I used Extra light virgin olive oil.
- I blended it just for a minute. 
- I had sifted the dry ingredients then Added the dry ingredients to the egg/sugar mixture.  
I mixed it just until it was smooth. It seemed a little thick,so I added maybe 2tspns of milk. You decide. 
Then I beat the egg whites and folded them in. 
Family said it was Great !

I don't have any idea how this recipe got so popular. This is the worst waffle recipe I've ever used. Very disappointed :(

An easy recipe that assembles in no time! A sleep-over favorite for kids :)
I followed recipe as written, but added an extra TB of sugar and increased vanilla to 1 tablespoon because these are my preferences.  Crispy outside, light, and fluffy inside!  A keeper and better than store bought any day!

Used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup buckwheat flour. Split the oils to 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup veg oil. The results were great.

It was really good! The waffle recipes I had used before took a really long time to make, this one took me 5 minutes at the most. Im using this recipe now! I added chocolate chips and blueberries for more flavor.

Excellent recipe. I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the sugar and vanilla, and added a sprinkling of cinnamon. I also separated the eggs and whipped the eggs whites into stiff peaks and folded them into the batter. This is an extra step but it only takes a few extra minutes which I find worth it. This was a hit with the family. this will be my go to recipe.

I felt like this recipe was pretty dense. Not a bad taste, just not a good texture. Both my husband and i thought it was a little too floury. Better than store bought mix? Yes, but there are a lot of homemade waffel recipes out there that are better

This is by far the best waffle recipe I've tried. Take the time to whisk the egg whites. You won't be sorry.  I added a bit more vanilla and sugar just for personal preference.  The consistency was OUTSTANDING.  I'll never use another recipe again.

This is a great recipe!! Quick and easy to make! I was a bit worried because it seemed runny to me but it was perfect! I changed it up a bit by adding about a tsp of cinnamon and I used whole wheat flour and coconut sugar! Yummy!! :)

Substituted sugar with Splenda, doubled that and the vanilla as another review suggested... and substituted the oil with coconut oil - OMG they are amazing! No butter or syrup required, especially when you throw in a few blueberries. :)

Not what I expected.  Even with the suggested adjustments.......pretty bland, a bit dense.  I did take the time to whip the egg whites separately....disappointing.

This is the first time I have made waffles and everybody loved them! I took a few tips from the reviews and added 1tblsp brown sugar, doubled the vanilla and used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil in place of the 1/2 cup of oil. I will be making these again. Thank you!

4 stars as is... 5 stars with these changes: separate eggs, whip the whites to stiff peaks and then fold into the batter at the end.Use buttermilk instead of regular. Added a tsp of cinnamon, extra 1/2 tsp sugar and double vanilla. Served it with warm cinnamon apple topping. Delicious!

I found this recipe after I couldn't find my wife's recipe. Was not impressed. A good waffle needs to stand on its own without butter and syrup. The waffle and the batter taste like vegetable oil. It's not very sweet at all. I had to add extra sugar so I couldn't only taste the oil. Butter would be a better substitute for the oil, or at least reducing the amount of oil dramatically and adding butter in its place.

Always use this recipe when making waffles!  My husband absolutely loves these..they come out so fluffy and delicious!  Great for when the cooler weather starts to set in.

This recipe is my kids' favorite.  I, too, removed on whole egg and added a few egg whites.  I make these on school days, so I want the kid to have a little more protein to help keep them full until lunchtime.  I add bittersweet chips for one kid and vanilla chips for another.  The waffles are light, fluffy, and crispy on the outside.  I don't make the mix ahead of time, but I do prepare all of the dry ingredients the night before.  I just add the wet ingredients in the morning, which makes things just a little faster and easier on hectic school mornings.

Great recipe. Beat the eggs until they have doubled in volume/extremely frothy. This will make for light and crisp but fluffy waffles.

This is my 'go to' quick and easy for Sunday mornings.  I add a touch of a few 'secret' ingredients (garam masala, all spice and cinnamon).  They fluff up best with a crispy outside when you use all white flour.  I've changed up to whole wheat - and though the health factor is there - this is a treat and the white flour recipe has the best result.

mine came out limp and soggy. I followed the recipe to a T, as I don't feel it's fair to person posting recipe to modify it and then rate the modification. Anyhow, brand new waffle iron, but non-edible waffles.

I love this recipe. Makes light and fluffy waffles. I substituded almond milk for cows milk due to my sons dairy allergy and added almond extract instead of vanilla.

I loved this crispy, light waffle!  Like others, I made substitutions. I used two ripe bananas and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup. For a crispy waffle,  the oil cannot be omitted. I increased vanilla to 2 teaspoon (to give it the carnival flavor) and I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. My husband said, "Nailed it!" It's far superior to a box mix, and every bit as easy.

Good base recipe, but you truly have to double the sugar and vanilla or it will have zero flavor. I put triple the vanilla and added cinnamon.  In an attempt to pump up the health factor I substituted 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour and I would not suggest a repeat of that adjustment. Just doctor it up a bit and you will like it.

These are so good!  I believe these will become a staple in our household.  They grab you with the wonderful aroma as they bake and capture you with the lightly sweetened taste.  A keeper!  I did take suggestions to cut oil by half.

My family gobbled these up! The two things I did different was 1) I made this in my blender and 2) I soured the milk with 2 TBSP of vinegar. In my blender, I beat the eggs until they were frothy, then added the rest of the wet ingredients, combined, and then added the dry. Used the blender spout to pour the batter into my waffle maker. Easy peasy and delicious!

Great recipe. I've made it as written and as a healthier variation(decreasing the white  flour and adding whole wheat flour and wheat germ to equal amount decreased). I've used eggs straight out of the fridge(usually use room temperature as they beat up fluffier), didn't seperate the eggs, ever, and have never had an issue. I've also used up milk and cream that were past date. I always double the vanilla.
This recipe has never failed.

I usually don't like waffles but this was fantastic!  I did use buttermilk and doubled vanilla.  I added fresh berries and a dab of whipped cream on top and I was in heaven.  This is a keeper.

Just great! First time ever making waffles. Could not believe how well they turned out. Especially the fluffiness. I did beat the egg-whites separately, and added them to the mixture (which contained the yellow).
Crisp on the outside, fluffy inside. 
Really great and simple

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I modified it just a tad. I used a bit more vanilla extract (and purchased the Mexican vanilla, which is richer in flavor), and added ground cinnamon. Not too much, just enough for that extra kick! Otherwise, this recipe was darn near PERFECT!

This recipe is awesome, but I tweak every recipe I find.  :)  I beat the eggs with an immersion blender for several minutes before folding into the batter (they became almost medium peak like egg whites) and the waffles were crispier than when I made a similar recipe that called for separating the egg whites.  I stirred a teaspoon of lemon juice into the milk for "buttermilk" waffles.  Also, I added double the vanilla and a heaping tablespoon of malted milk powder.  Easy and yummy!

Great recipe--had a little fun with it and portioned out the mix into 4 baggies and added food coloring.

This is a great recipe.  I did one tweak I separated the 2 eggs.  Used the yolk as per directions but then whipped the whites to a medium-stiff peak.  Folded the whites into the rest of the batter and noticed it got a lot lighter.  Will be making again.

This a great recipe! I substituted nonfat Greek yogurt for the oil, raw sugar for white sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. The waffles turned out perfect!

I don't make waffles often, and wanted an easy recipe that didn't involve the risk of not beating an egg right or adding things in the wrong order. This turned out great, and I'm a horrible cook. Thank you!

very tasty! but I also made some healthy changes: added 2 tbl. protein powder to the flour, used only 2 tbl. coconut oil (for the oil), and used almond milk for the milk, plus adding some final water to the batter for the right consistency (easy pouring) -- delicious!

This is the perfect basic waffle recipe. I used almon milk and whole wheat flour because thats what I had around; it turned out amazing. I think this would be a good base recipe to add blueberries, chocolate chips, bananas, other fun mix-ins. Highly recommend!

Theses are so good, made them for the first time for friends to celebrate Canada Men's Hockey team winning gold at the Olympics! Everyone loved them. I added 2 tbsp melted butter to the batter and piled on the fruit. Will be keeping this recipe for sure!

If you are looking for a waffle recipe that leads to a nicely crisped surface on the outside while having a soft fluffy interior, this is the one! Anxious to try out my brand new waffle-maker, I picked this recipe. These are the very first waffles I have ever made. The first one turned out nice but was too soft. Starting with the second one, I let the waffles cook to a dark-golden brown. That made the end result perfect - lovely crispness over a tender, fluffy softness! I used the recipe almost exactly the way it is, except for a little less oil, some cinnamon and folding in beaten egg-whites in the end, as suggested by another reviewer. Great results. Next I will try this with whole wheat flour.

I believe this recipe was too thick for my waffle maker. Waffles would not cook in the middle even though I was careful not to mix the batter too much. I think with a different waffle maker this recipe would be fine

The taste was ok, but the texture was horrible.  They were soggy and limp and just awful.  I want a fluffy, slightly crispy waffle and this was so not what I was looking for.

These were perfect waffles! Crispy outside, fluffy inside. Soooo good. We added chocolate chips to half the batter and they were spectacular! The search is over! This one's a keeper!

I made this twice and really like it. Very easy and more importantly, I usually have all the ingredients in my kitchen already. The second time I made this I used two bowls, one for dry ingredients and one for wet. I added the dry to the wet and the batter was much better than when I made it the first time. That's the only change I would make.

I made this recipe tonight for my family and it was a Huge Hit! Everyone loved these waffles! I modified the recipe to make ten servings. I made a few adjustments to this great recipe. I separated the egg whites from the yolks. I whipped the whites until stiff. I added all wet ingredients withe the dry and stirred until lump free then folded in the stiff egg whites. I baked according to directions and My Waffles came out Great! If you are looking for a Great waffle recipe this is the One! Hope you enjoy the recipe as much as our family did!

I hate rating on a recipe I made changes on, but here it is.  I followed other reviewers recommendations and whipped the egg whites and doubled the sugar, vanilla and cinnamon.  I also reduced the oil by half and added a pinch of cloves and a dash of pumpkin spice.  The waffles were light and crispy and had a hint of spice.  The family loved it, will make again.  Thank you for a good recipe.

Edit:  made it again, this time as is, with a little extra vanilla.  It was excellent, fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside and they freeze so well.  I gave it 5 stars, excellent basic waffle.

Second edit:  I now just put all the ingredients, liquids first, in my Vitamix and mix. Done! I make double batches and freeze. Kids the put in toaster when ready to eat it.

Hubby got a waffle maker for Christmas. Had to try it out. It was the perfect recipe! I'm going to make more and freeze them. Whenever the kids want waffles, we're going to try popping them in the toaster. Definitely will use this recipe again.

Overall a good recipe, but it needed just a touch more sugar for my taste. Also I whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in, which made for a good texture.

I've followed the recipe exactly and love that they are light and crisp! I've even made modifications such as subbing half white whole wheat flour and using energ-egg instead of real egg and still light and crispy. I've tried all whole wheat flour and it just does not work, they do not come out crispy and light and I eat mainly whole wheat. However, as is the recipe is excellent.

Best tasting waffles ever! We make a dozen or so at a time and keep the extras in the freezer. 1/4 waffle fits in the toaster just fine for a quick breakfast.

Way way way too much baking powder, it was bitter and dry. So many great reviews that I will try again, but reduce baking powder to 1tsp.

I've been using recipes off this site regularly for YEARS. I followed the directions to the T and yes I did use baking powder unlike some of the bad reviews on here. They were pretty fluffy ans browned nicely but they were so bland that even a ton of butter and syrup couldn't do the trick.

This recipe is great and all the ingredients are things that you will very likely have in your pantry/cupboard.  I am making this right now and my first batch came out wonderfully.  With some maple syrup, it melts in your mouth.  It is definitely a recipe that I will use again.

Good but better with changes: separate the eggs, beat the whites and fold them in at the end. Use a little less milk and add lemon juice or vinegar to make the 13/4 cups. I used 1/4 cup of sugar. Less is fine, bit 1 tbsp is not enough. I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour. And I think that's it. Good base recipe to play around with :)

These pancakes were so light and fluffy! Great basic recipe! 

We followed the recommendations in the reviews and separated the eggs and whipped the whites (and put the yolks in with the wet ingredients). We also added in a few spices (cinnamon & nutmeg) to add in some extra flavor. 

Will definitely make these again.

I don't know what went wrong, I followed the recipe EXACTLY!  It is awful!  Tastes just like baking powder. The batter was thin like water and tastes awful!  What a waste of my time and food.  Now my children are very hungry and I have nothing to give them...

The best waffle recipe I have found to date.  Have adapted to our own preferences and according to my kiddos "the best waffles ever".  If you want a crispy waffle, then try using virgin, unrefined coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also we prefer buttermilk waffles so I will add just a bit of regular milk so thin out the batter.  Once you have the basic mix together, you then add any fruits, nuts, berries, or chocolate chips.  Such a hit for breakfast!

Made this recipe for 4 hungry boys this morning and everyone loved it!! I used the exact recipe and it turned out wonderfully! The outsides of the waffle were crispy and golden and the insides were light and fluffy!! I will absolutely use this recipe from now on. No need to search for another waffle batter recipe!! This is all you need!!

Just made this waffles with apple sauce instead of butter.  Made meringue and added to the batter at the end also.  It was good and my husband and daughter also liked it.  But we personally prefer a little denser texture.  I'm assuming that sticking with the original method, rather than beating the egg whites would fit our liking better.  I'll try to make it the original way the next time.

Good recipe.  Easy to follow and do.  Turned out great!  Got more waffles out of it because my waffle maker is small, but good to freeze.  Did add a little cinnamon and more vanilla extract.  Topped it with bananas and maple syrup - yum!

I tried other recipes and this one came out rather moist compared to others. I did follow other reviews in whipping the egg white(s) until stiff peaks and folding in - great results making for a fluffier waffle. I chose to add cinnamon and played around with different extracts, finding that a nice orange extract splash was quite good.

This recipe is perfect. I've used it several times with no changes. Have used other waffle recipes that are a little more complicated w/ more ingredients and this recipe stands up to those. They come out with the perfect crispness on the outside and tasty fluffiness on the inside. The number one reason I like this recipe is b/c it's easy. It makes way more than enough for me and my husband.I only make one 4-square waffle b/c it's just us two. I pour the batter into a container and refrigerate it and it will last me for 3-4 days. I look forward to breakfast!

Good recipe. I didn't have vanilla; I subbed applesauce for oil and used half wheat flour. My 3 and 1 year old loved these!
Update: still a solid recipe. Held its shape well when I used oil. Wish it didn’t use oil and sugar so I won’t make very often, but good for a treat. 8 and 6 year old liked them.

This recipe was amazing!  I did make a few changes though.  I halved the recipe since I was the only one eating. From the halved ingredients I doubled the sugar and vanilla, and added a pinch more salt.  After I poured the batter but before I closed the lid, I sprinkled cinnamon, brown sugar , and pecans on top. The brown sugar turns crispy and is wonderful!  I melted a little butter on top. No syrup needed!

I love making homemade pancakes and buttermilk pancakes, so I thought I'd find a yummy waffle recipe for dinner one night!  I picked this one because it had A LOT of reviews and still had 4.5 stars.  Unfortunately, these waffles were awful!  They had no flavor, and I even added syrup and powdered sugar to try to fix the flavor, but it didn't work.  I will definitely look for another recipe next time.

Excellent and easy; as another reviewer said they baked up great in my antique waffle maker-to me the only kind to use to get the waffles just like Mom used to make. However, I came on mainly to point out to sdrob that he/she made a huge mistake - you could try again with baking POWDER as the recipe says! They really are good when you follow the directions! Just saying...

I halved the recipe since I was cooking for two, but the taste of baking soda was so overwhelming that the waffles were not edible (and yes I used the correct amount... in this case it was 2 tsp for a half recipe).  I think the baking soda should be 1.5-2.0 tsps for a full recipe and 3/4-1 tsp for a half recipe.  I now notice others had the same result as I did when I read other reviews.  Oh well.

The most important part of waffles is that they don't stick to the waffle iron. Flavor is second, these are good. Remember you flavor waffles with toppings. Everyone loved these, I loved to cook them, easy clean up. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I pretty much made it as is for the first time out. I am going to try some of the other "healthier" ideas next time. I did add a bit more vanilla than it called for only because I love vanilla. Will definitely be making this again!

I tried this recipe to use batter thru the week instead of cooking up all the batter & freezing the extra waffles. 
I disagree with whipping the white separately to create a lighter airier product. These waffles are exactly what I want; a little dense, creamy & soft in the middle, a little crisp on the exterior, lots of flavor & a little chew. If you want light waffles, then go ahead. But I want my waffle to stick to my ribs, not need a lot of sweet syrup, but satisfy my appetite (not tempt me to eat more.)
Modifications: I used half whole wheat white & half white flour & added about 1/2 tsp of yeast per another reviewer to give it that yeasty flavor. I also used melted butter rather than oil, & Splenda Brown instead of white sugar for more flavor. Plus I used the classic method of combining all the wet & dry ingredients first (except I crumbled and mixed the Splenda with the wet to dissolve it) then poured the wet in a well in the dry. I did not "beat" but gently incorporated the two with a rubber spatula & broke up big lumps with a whisk (not beating, just mashing out lumps.) Tiny lumps bake out.
Laid plastic on batter & used it 1, 3, & 6 days later. Did NOT stir the bubbles out; they made it better! Day 6 the top was grey like sourdough starter so I wondered if my yeast hurt it. But it tasted wonderful! (Also added chopped walnuts once b4 closing the waffle iron; yum!) 
Topped it with 1/2 tsp butter & 1 tsp homemade jam or fresh berries mixed with a little jam or karo. :)

Love this recipe!  Love that it's a one-bowl recipe, and that I don't have to separate the eggs.  I sub in whole wheat flour and leave out the sugar for healthy and LIGHT AS AIR waffles!

Used white whole wheat flour (King Arthur's brand), and melted coconut oil.  Also added frozen blueberries.  Did not need to spray the waffle iron because of the coconut oil.  Probably could leave out the sugar!  These were AWESOME!!!!!!

I made a healthier version of this recipe for a great birthday breakfast with some girlfriends. I beat everything except the eggs together in a bowl. I did substitute the vegetable oil for greek yogurt, added in 2 tbls of ground flax seed, a dash of cinnamon and a bit more milk so the batter wasn't too thick. I then beat 4 egg whites (instead of 2 whole eggs) until stiff peaks formed and folded them into the batter. I covered it and put in the fridge overnight and the batter was ready for the next morning. They were crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. Made me felt a little less guilty once I covered it with butter and syrup!

These were wonderful, in texture and flavor and workability while cooking. I used my Belgian flip iron, and they turned out perfectly: golden brown and crisp outside, soft and moist inside. The only problem I had -- and I'm not deducting stars, because more than likely it was totally my fault -- is that the batter, sitting in the fridge, just about doubled in size and did a nice, slow explosion that required more cleanup time than prep and cook time. It's a REALLY thick batter, and REALLY has a lot of baking powder, so it's volatile to begin with. My mistake, but I'd do it again in a larger bowl that can contain the beast, was using honey instead of sugar -- and honey is acid and a reactive with bicarb. A real crowd please.

Very good and fast basic waffle recipe. I did not separate the eggs and they came out delicious. Obviously, if you make the other kind of waffles with yeast and let it sit overnight it will taste more malty like a Belgian waffle, but when you're too lazy or hungry to do that much work, this is a perfect weekend morning stand-in. I'd say they were about 75% as good as the ones that require all the work, with very little work. So maybe I'll stick to this recipe for my go-to waffle recipe and leave the other one for special occasions only. :)

Can't get enough of these waffles. We only have a normal wafffle maker, not belgian. They have a nice crisp but are still soft inside.  We add a little extra vanilla.

I liked this recipe, but tweeked it a little. I did as suggested in other recipes and added 1 tbsp brown sugar, and cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also subsituted the white flour to 1 c. Whole wheat flour and 1 c. spelt flour, also I replaced the oil with applesauce.  And I put 1c. of milk and 3/4 c. plain yogurt.  They came out perfect.  I have a very good waffle make, so if your waffles stick you may want to add oil to your recipe.

These were a little bland. I've made tastier waffles before but they required more work, so these were good for being so easy to prepare. I did only use 1/4 cup oil, and added 2 tablespoons melted butter to the batter.

As it is written, this recipe is not great.  The batter was very bland.  It was better after adding cinnamon and additional vanilla and sugar.  I only gave it 2 stars because it's a good starting point for a waffle mix.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I doubled the amounts of both the sugar and the vanilla, and the result was a sweet, tasty waffle.  Be sure to mix the batter in a blender--you won't regret it. It's so light and fluffy that it's worth the hassle of washing the blender afterwards! This makes a ton. I doubled it, and had WAAAAY more than my family of 5 could eat!  Next time I'll be adding cinnamon and nutmeg and serving with apple cider syrup for a perfectly spicy autumn breakfast!

Good basic recipe - simple ingredients and allows for modifications to suite individual tastes. I used yogurt instead of oil, added 1 tsp of brown sugar, a total of 2 tsp sugar & 1 tsp cinnamon. Served with blueberries, bananas, walnuts and a little bit of syrup. Family loved them! I like my waffles a little sweet because I prefer them with a little bit of butter & no syrup - so next time I may add more sugar. Leftovers were placed in ziplock and in fridge to toast during the week! Keeper. Thanks.

My kids love this recipe- I make waffles nearly every week.

One tip: You can cut the baking powder in half, and it's just fine.

I've made this recipe both as is, and with some modifications. As is - I have to say, it's pretty bland. The texture is great but there's just no flavor. The 3 star rating is for the recipe as is. I replaced the vegetable oil with melted butter, added a pinch more salt, doubled the sugar & vanilla, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. I also whipped the egg whites separately and folded them into the batter at the end. With these changes, this could be a 5 star recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and these were amazing! I was worried because the batter came out quite thick but the waffles turned out light and fluffy. Definitely found my new waffle recipe.

This was delicious recipe. We really enjoyed them. I added cinnamon and more vanilla then the recipe called for. They were crunchy on the outside and light on the inside.

These are delicious!  I made 18 servings so I could freeze what we didn't eat.  I doubled the vanilla and sugar and it made a big difference.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  My husband, who claims to not like wheat bread, loved them!

Just as easy to make as Bisquick but cheaper.  I add extra sugar and vanilla.  This recipe makes really great waffles.

These turned out great.  I didn't have time to read any reviews before I tried it, so I made it exacly according to the recipe... sort of.  I didn't measure the vanilla - just put a splash in that looked like it'd be about right.  And I also used gluten free flour instead of all-purpose flour since I can't have wheat/gluten.  They turned out great, and were really tasty.  Especially since we put strawberries and whipped cream on top.  :)  My husband (who's not gluten free) said they tasted great plain, too.

Love it as is. Alterations are easy, but not at all necessary. I make the mix on Friday morning and save enough to make Saturday and Sunday mornings.  It saves well in the fridge.

First time making waffles! Yummy! It's crispy and fluffy inside.  Added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon; Beat the egg whites seperately to fold at the end. I would use more sugar and vanilla next time.

This was great the first time I made waffles that where not in a box.  I will never buy another box mix.  I did like some one else said added cinnamon and brown sugar and only used egg whites.  It was great!!!  I put whip cream on top them and it would be really good with baked apples on top! Next time

Very good recipe for quick waffles.  Not the tastiest recipe, but when balanced with the ease well worth it.  I did add 3 tbls of malt powder to give them a little more taste.

We love this recipe. I use 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup, no sugar, and white, whole wheat flour. I didn't know it existed, but they sell it at Trader Joes.  I add at least one diced apple or a diced banana, or both. I mostly make waffles for desert, so I constantly change the flavors. I add chocolate chips, cinamon, nutmeg - not everything all at once.

Delicious. I doubled the recipe and frozen them for homemade toaster waffles throughout the week. I substituted coconut oil for the veg oil and unbleached flour for the all-purpose. I also added 1/4 ground flax seeds and 2 teaspoons baobob powder. They were SO good. This is my go to waffle recipe now.

Good solid recipe. Gave this one a three because I had to add more sugar and vanilla to punch up the flavor factor. I will stick with this recipe though because its simpler than the others!

I used apple sauce instead of the eggs since I did not have any on hand. The waffles almost reminded me of churros... I will always use this recipe... Yum.

So much better than a boxed waffle mix!  I doubled the recipe and made them the night before and put them in the fridge overnight.  They were perfect the next morning and so fast for breakfast.  We didn't use all the batter the first day, so I used up the rest the next day and they were still great after the batter being in the fridge for 2 nights.  Excellent recipe!

An excellent, easy base for fabulous waffles.  I substituted apple sauce for half the vegetable oil and doubled the sugar and vanilla.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and orange extract while using half whole wheat flour and half white.  They turned out great and I served them with cinnamon/sugar butter, maple syrup, strawberries, bananas, and whipped topping as options.  Desert and dinner all in one!  The family loved it.

I thought this recipe was OK. I followed the recipe to a T and no doubly the waffles were light and looked beautiful. But I found the flavor to be bland. My kids enjoyed it but my husband and I did not.

Very good recipe. I followed the suggestion to whip the egg whites and fold them in. I liked the light texture. I will make them again.

Excellent! I've had my new waffle iron for ten days and I have used this recipe every day since. Like suggested, I make the batter the night before so all I have to do is heat the waffle iron. Delicious!

Great basic recipe but really lacks flavor. I took the other suggestions and doubled the sugar and vanilla, whipped the egg whites before mixing them in and it was still bland. Have to say however the texture was absolutely perfect. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Makes me want to play around with this one to see if I can make it better.

We love these waffles!  They are so simple my husband can even make them. We usually use half wheat flour. Much better than waffles from a box!

Even in my ancient waffle maker, these came out perfectly. Like someone else suggested, I separately beat the egg whites and folded them in at the end.

Modified to include 2TB of sugar, 1tsp of salt and 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla for flavor.  Otherwise, it was delicious and our go-to for waffles!

Perfect they come out nice and crunchy with good flavor and fluffy insides.  Beats any boxed pancake mix.  I like to add a little more vanilla and sugar.

These were SOOO delicious!!! I only changed a couple things. I mixed the dry ingredients first then added the wet. I separated the egg yolks and whites and beat the whites until fluffy and folded it in last. I also doubled the sugar and vanilla. SO YUMMY!! I won't have boxed waffles EVER AGAIN!! Great recipe!!!

Yum!!!  I've been looking for a yeast free recipe for quite some time.  Little did I know that just typing in "waffle" on allrecipes.com would find the perfect one.  I did double the vanilla and sugar, and beat the egg whites per the suggestions.  I am so glad I did!!!  I made these for a evening snack and served with powdered sugar, blackberry compote, and whipped cream.  I imagined I'd have batter for the morning, but I was wrong lol!!!!

It's a keeper!! I also beat the egg whites until super fluffy then added everything else, as other reviewers suggested. And sprinkled in some cinnamon blend from pampered chef. These were a huge hit with my family and I will be making them often!!

Added cinnamon and sub'd butter due to oil shortage. Turned out great, thanks! Tripled, even my husband complimented. :) Edited: Now I use oil if it's just for my family but butter tastes better. Doubling is just right for our family of 7 but with company tripling is better. Great recipe and I always use the blender!

Not at all what I expected. I am not quite a novice in the kitchen but these came out bland, soft, and dense. Perhaps its my waffle iron but I don't know. Was expecting much more. I will have to play around with this one.

The waffles are very light and fluffy and cooked up beautifully, but are extremely bland.  They need some real flavor.

Everyone in my family LOVED them.  I mixed every thing except the eggs from the night before and stored the batter in the refrig. The next day I added the ROOM Temp eggs (they get fluffier) to the batter.  Hubby asked to stick to this recipe and he's now convinced to not buy the box again.

love this recipe!! i made this the second time this morning except for some reason i left out the baking powder by accident because i had my 3 boys in the kitchen wanting to help me out.  and didn't realize it until we were already eating it. But guess what it turned out just the same as i did the first time. i also substituted Mango essence instead of vanilla and it was so delicious. the aroma of the mango was just great!! I also followed the prior reviews on beating the egg whites separate and folding it in towards the end. Overall, i LOVE this recipe! light and crispy!! thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!

This is a great waffle recipe.  I used to use a recipe that required you to separate the eggs and whip the whites.  This is much easier and was just as good. My husband loved these.

I wanted buttermilk waffles, so I soured the milk with 2 tablespoons of vinegar and 3 tablespoons of melted butter.  I increased the sugar to 4 tablespoons.  They were incredibly fantastic!!!

I got a new waffle maker for Christmas that I wanted to use but not use boxed mix, so I tried this recipe.  I did tweek it a litttle based on other reviews.  I substituted the oil with butter; doubled the sugar and doubed the vanilla.  I topped with confectioners sugar and my family LUVED them!! I will definitely make these again....but I will have double the entire recipe (with my changes) as it was not enough to go around.

I dont understand all the good reviews. These were ok, no flavor to speak of. And i followed recipe exactly. Very bland. I prefer a good pre-made mix to this. If you make these I recommend using extra sugar and vanilla. I sauteed chopped apples in butter cinnamon and sugar and used that as a topping, along with butter and a little maple syrup, THEN, they had flavor.

I was out of Bisquick one weekend and so I used this recipe. It was a hit. I will be using it from now on because it really isn't that much more time/work than Bisquick mix and the family seemed to enjoy it more.

This is the best recipe I've used. It was quite simple and the consistency was perfect.  I used almond extract because I was out of vanilla and it worked well.  My kids like their waffles plain so I doubled the sugar and added 1 tsp melted butter to the batter.

Very bland. I lost my usual recipe. So decided to try this one. But as a person who likes to eat my waffles with out syrup and etc... this has absolutely zero taste. Perfect if you like to add a bunch of syrup or jam or etc.... but if you like it by it self or with just a little butter skip.

I did not care for this recipe. i have a great waffle maker and tried this recipe this morning.  my waffles were gummy and gross even though they were cooked through they had a raw taste! i've made many batches of waffles using other recipes and this did not turn out well.

I knew these waffles were going to be excellent as soon as I smelled the batter...it smells like a cookie. I used whole wheat flour and added blueberries. Yum!

These turned out great! I added a little extra sugar and vanilla, and whipped the egg whites separately. I like my waffles a little crispier on the outside (but still light on the inside) so I left it in the pan a few seconds extra. DELICIOUS!

I replaced all purpose flour with whole wheat flour and the sugar with pure maple syrup and my kids devoured them. So much healthier for them.

I would give this all the stars in the universe if I could!  Perfect waffles!  Love that you can keep the batter in the fridge for a few day.

I made these this morning and made the suggestions that were recommended. Doubling the sugar and the vanilla and adding cinnamon. I also seperated the eggs. And folded in the egg whites at the end. I didn't feel that it was sweet enough and they didn't stay crispy.

This recipe made a great standard waffle.  The only complaint I had was it was a little on the bland side, so I may add a tad more vanilla the next time.  However they were not rubbery or cardboard-ish like some waffles.  We load toppings on our waffles so for us they worked out perfectly.

After searching for a waffle recipe to make for my daughter and her sleep over friends, I found this one. I'm a "Mister Mom" in the kitchen and made these with minimal effort. The only difference with following this recipe was, I have grown accustomed to following the rules of mixing dry and wet ingredients, so i mixed and sifted all the dry, mixed all the liquid and lightly beat them, then added the wet to the dry. They were a little bland so i added more vanilla, cinnamon and sugar, to taste. They were great w the addition of the blueberry sauce recipe(i found here also) and finished w whip cream. I won't eat them regularly, but they were a nice weekend treat.

I loved this recipe so quick and easy! The only thing I did different was add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 nutmeg, 2 Tbs of ground flax seed and added one container of 2x the protein blueberry yogurt! They were delicious I topped them with warm strawberries and whip cream. The family loved them this recipe is a keeper thanks for sharing it!

This is the best waffle recipe I've cooked yet. I add about a tsp more vanilla to the original recipe. I have also tried half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour and it was great. It will last a few days in the frig as well.

Yummy! I made it exactly as the recipe said, only I left out the vanilla because I couldn't find it!  They had the perfect touch of sweet, and I have a son that eats his waffles totally plain ... so the balance of sweet is not an afterthought for us and even he gave this a 2-thumbs up!

As other reviewers had suggested I added 2x as much sugar and vanilla extract. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I thought they were excellent and will be making these again.

If I could give this recipe more stars than just 5, I would.  PERFECT waffle recipe!  My husband and I both agree, these taste way better than any waffles we've had at restaurants or diners.  At one point I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and that added a wonderful flavor kick to it.

Not nearly sweet enough.  Not even with syrup on top.  Also, I like more of an "eggy" taste to my waffles.

Wouldn't make these again. Four teaspoons of baking powder? That's more than you would use in an entire cake, tried to halve it knowing that it was too much, still came out unappealing.

This recipe was the BOMB! Comparable to gourmet waffle mixes used in the past. I halved the recipe (using the same amount of sugar) added a sprinkle of cinnamon and VOILA! The perfect waffle...so light and fluffy, yet crispy and golden on the outside...Stayed crispy and withstood whipped cream and syrup...A MUST TRY

Pretty good, but not great.  The waffles weren't crispy - and it did not seem that any additional cooking would help.  I did beat the egg white separately then fold in at the end.  I'm not sure if this affected the crispness.  Additionally, as the batter sat while the first waffle cooked, it seemed to deflate and the second waffle was even soggier.  I did use about 1/3 whole wheat flour.  I'm not sure what exact effect that had, but next time I would use a couple teaspoons or so of orange juice substituted for some of the milk to cut the strong whole wheat flavor.

As others I also used whole wheat flour, applesauce in lieu of oil and splenda instead of the sugar.  I did beat the egg whites separately and folded in at the end. What a fantastic waffle!!  Made the batter the night before and they were just wonderful when I made them the next morning.  Left over waffles freeze very well and come out very nice after a few minutes in the toaster.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I really liked this recipe for homemade waffles! They turned out thick fluffy and delicious. I added 2 tbls of sugar instead of just one because we like them a ltitle sweeter!

Great Recipe - I have my favorite waffle recipe, but it is rather time consuming to make.  I opted to try this one and was pleasantly surprised!  My family loved them.  I did as other's suggested and doubled the sugar and salt.  I also used yogurt for 1/2 of the milk.  Wonderful!

Very delicious! When I say that I followed the ingredients exactly, I did...I was in a rush to make breakfast for the in-laws, and didn't even look for suggestions in the reviews (which I always do). I didn't even beat the eggs, just threw all ingredients into a big bowl, mixed by hand and put them on the waffle maker.  My only complaint is that the batter is thin and flows out of the maker each time you make a waffle.  A bit messy, but the result is fluffy, crispy, and chewy.  The taste is akin to a waffle cone.  Delicious with fruit, butter, and syrup!

The BEST! Also great if you make a double batch and freeze the leftovers to pop in the toaster for a quick, but good breakfast.

Excellent recipe.  I used half wheat flour, and the results were excellent.  They came out much better in my standard waffle iron than in the belgium waffle iron.  They freeze well and I can pop them in the toaster for a quick breadfast.

Unbelievable! I'll never make any others. I followed the advice of another review and put all the ingredients in the blender (dry first, wet second). I used 2 Tablespoons brown sugar as substitute for white, I used 2 teaspoons vanilla, and 3 large (not extra large) eggs.  I blended it on high for 4-5 minutes. My family and a visiter all proclaimed them on par with the ones from the fancy breakfast restaurants. I do have flipover waffle maker (not sure if that makes any difference) :)

PERFECT waffles!!  This is replacing the waffles I've been making for a couple of years now!  I have to say that Eggo waffles are good, but I like to give my kids something home made instead of frozen/processed (especially since they eat waffles every morning).  This recipe is sooo close to light and fluffy Eggo waffles - they smell so good too!  YUMMY!  Thank you!!

These waffles were perfect.  My waffle iron is over 17 years old so it doesn't brown perfectly, but the waffles tasted great.  They were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  The only change I made was I doubled the vanilla because I like a lot of vanilla flavor.  This will definitely be my waffle recipe from now on.

The first time, not so fluffy. The second time, I took a reviewer's advice and whipped the eggs separately. They were much better. They give you a regular, standard waffle; nothing more, nothing less. That's why I rated it a 4 rather than a 5. Good job overall.

Excellent!  Fluffy inside and crisp on the outside. Used half whole-wheat and all-purpose.  Added 1 TBSP ground flax seed, doubled the vanilla, and added a tsp of cinnamon.  Taste great the next day also. As suggested by others, I did fold in the 2 beaten egg whites into the batter at the end.   This is my new go to waffle recipe.

These are fantastic! I just finished eating them, and my husband and I were swooning. The are light as air, but crispy on the outside. Perfect. Exactly the texture I have been looking for in a waffle recipe, but could never find. I followed the recipe exactly except I added about 2 Tblsp. lemon juice into the measuring cup and added milk on top to equal 1&3/4 cups. I think everything tastes better with home made buttermilk! I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent waffles!  I make a double batch on Sunday and serve waffles to my kids for breakfast Monday through Thursday!  We change the toppings to add variety...Home made whipped cream with berries, peanut butter and bananas or even good ol' maple syrup! :)

I am always looking how to make a recipe more healthy so here are my revisions:
I used 1 cup of my own ground wheat berries and 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour.  I used 1 stick of real butter (melted), and I used coconut milk instead of milk.  I used 4 T honey to sweeten and the rest of the recipe I kept the same.  My family loved these waffles!

My family loved these!  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached white flour and they turned out great!

This is the best tasting waffle recipe. I substituted apple sauce for the oil and added a smidge more vanilla because i like the taste.

This recipe is great.  I've made it several times, always with whole wheat flour and lately with strawberries or blueberries added.  It's great!

We loved these! I was looking for a new waffle recipe to try because the recipe I've been using isn't that great. I chose this recipe because it sounded the easiest.  What a bonus that it also tastes great!  This is my new "go to" waffle recipe. Thank you!

Loved it. Better than the recipe I tried last week. This one was lighter and tastier. I will use this one from now on. Doubled sugar and vanilla as some suggested.

Pretty good! Crisp outside,  soft inside. Whipping the eggs is a must for me cause I made them before without doing it and there is a difference. Looks kinda watery but just cover all of the iron with batter.

I have tried many different boxed waffle recipes and for some reason never thought to make my own! I made the recipe as-is and it made PERFECT waffles. They were just the right amount of crispy etc... My husband and I agreed, however, that the next time we make them we'll add more vanilla extract and maybe more sugar as we like a sweeter waffle.

Wow, some of the best waffles I've tasted.  I'm glad I used this recipe instead of the pre-mixed box, that I used to always use.  I would recommended to all for simple delicious waffles.

These are delicious.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 out of 5 is because they are just typical waffles, nothing out of the ordinary or above and beyond.

Our family lovs this recipe.  I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and thrown in about 1 cup of uncooked oats for added nutrition.  I also beat the eggs on high for about 4 minutes so the waffles are extra fluffy.  Our family loves it when I use almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  It makes the flavor amazing!!  I love that the batter keeps for about a week so I can make a couple before shool in just a few minutes!  THANKS for th great recipe.

This is the second time we've made these waffles.  They are so simple and come out totally PERFECT!  (Even my husband managed to make them and cook them all by himself!!) I plan to try them with whole wheat flour next time and will post another review.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

These were fantastic.  I upped the sugar a bit, and the vanilla.  Subbed egg beaters and softened butter sub.

Great for delivery of maple syrup and butter. Did the beating the egg whites first, fold i last option and it's great. They crisp well and hold up well... but lack one important thing. Flavor. They are relatively tasteless on their own (as mentioned). When I don't have time for a proper yeast waffle, these are simple enough and worth making again.
I'd actually rate 3.5 stars.

These were so, so good!! Although I modified it just a little bit. These were the changes I made: Used applesauce instead of oil, and used kefer instead of milk.  My family LOVED them!! Definitely a keeper......=)

Definitely a keeper for us!! followed the recipe but added more sugar and vanilla. The flavor was ok, but still needs a little something. These were big and fluffy. I took the advice of others and beat the eggs with my had mixer for about 3.5 mins. I combined the milk and vanilla in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another and added the oil last. Will be making this again for sure!!! Thanks for a good one!!

Excellent, easy receipe.  I added a little brown sugar and full tsp of vanilla, and it was perfect.  I didn't beat the egg whites separately as others have suggested, but really gave the batter a fast whisking, which made it very fluffy.  Awesome!

Tastes good! Freezes good! Will keep this recipe and throw out the window all the others. No need to separate the egg whites, you won't tell the difference with these!

Exchanged apple sauce for the oil, egg substitute for eggs, organic raw sugar, and used the whole wheat flour.  Great basic recipe!  My children loved them!

I loved this recipe! It was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I did however change it a little. I used almond extract instead of vanilla & I added fresh squeezed orange juice. It gave them an extra flavor & sweetness. Definitely try this recipe.

Enjoyed these but they are a little bland. I doubled the recipe and used 3 cups white flour & 1 cup whole wheat. I used 1 tablespoon white sugar & 1.5 packets Truvia. Next time I will add cinnamon and double the vanilla. I used the George Foreman grill with waffle plate and the double recipe made 13 waffles. :)

I made these with Whole Wheat pastry flour and they turned out fantastic.  I topped them with frozen fruit that I heated in a pan and sweetened with one packet of Stevia.  The hubby loved them.  This was super easy to make... Placed everything in the blender and pulsed.

Really very good. A little bland and not quite as fluffy as I would have liked. But still very tasty.

I was really happy with how these turned out! We have to cook non-dairy/no sugar and I used water rather than milk and didn't add the sugar. Still turned out great. I ran out of vanilla extract and used maple flavoring instead also added frozen blueberries. Super! Thanks so much!

Great, fluffy waffles!  I usually add a bunch of crushed pecans to the recipe, too, which really makes a great waffle into a perfect waffle!

I beat the egg whites seperatly then added the yolks, then all the rest of the wet ingredients. Then I mixed up all the dry and added the wet to the dry gradually. Based on other reviews I increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and the sugar to 2 tablespoons. Could use even more vanilla. The batter is a thin, next time I would decrease the milk a little. Overall these waffles are light and very tender. Will make again

These were pretty good. Definitely light and fluffy but they could have used more flavor. I added a bit more vanilla and they were still pretty bland. I think these would be great with some blueberries added to the batter.

I'm diabetic and can *barely* tolerate carbs in the morning at all since I am pregnant. However, I've been having a waffle craving recently so I made these for lunch instead and they fit the bill perfectly. This is a great from-scratch recipe! It's hard to find a whole wheat recipe that turns out light and fluffy. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, buttermilk instead of milk, melted margarine instead of oil, increased the sugar to 1 1/2 T and doubled the vanilla; then threw everything into the blender. It's just my husband and I at home this weekend so this made WAY more than we could eat, so I froze the rest for my son to toast for breakfasts. He'll be happy. :)

These were wonderful!!!  I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  I used almost a 1/2 cup of applesauce and filled the rest of the 1/2 cup with vegetable oil, and 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla!  Oh, and I did beat the eggs until fluffy!  These were the best waffles yet!! Thanks!

Great tasting. Although I made these quickly this morning and would suggest that you not make them in ingredient order. I was sleepy and did and ended up with pockets of baking powder. I am a seasoned cook, but my sleepy eyes led me to think there was a reason for the ingredient order and didn't asses the situation.  All that to say mix dry ingredients apart for wet ingredients and then add to wet ingredients.  Otherwise delicious.

Doubled this, made about 18 waffles. Used 1/2 WW and 1/2 white flour, coconut oil and butter instead of canola, and whipped the white separately and added them last. Also, 2/3 c of sugar and about 2 t. of vanilla. Turned out good, will make again.

This recipe seemed REALLY wet. It took forever to make them, and after 10 minutes or so, I gave up and they ended up a little undercooked. If I make these again, I think I will leave out the oil. I also added cinnamon cuz I love it in everything, and doubled the vanilla. These were only okay. I think I'll look elsewhere for a better recipe

Delicious - nice and eggy.  I have only ever eaten frozen waffles, so I never knew waffles actually tasted this way!  I made this recipe as written, except that I used a bit less oil than the recipe calls for.

Super easy to make. I did add cinnamon to the batter. It made exactly 8 waffles in my iron, which was perfect. It always seems recipes make too much or too little and I have to make another batch. This will be my go-to waffle recipe.

Well, I was out of vegetable oil and vanilla which is weird for me so I substituted a 1/2 cup of melted butter flavor shortening and a 1/4 tsp of almond extract and a few dashes of cinnamon and these were fantastic! This will be the waffle recipe I use from now on. My husband bought me a regular waffle maker for Christmas last year when I wanted a belgium waffle maker but this recipe makes up for the difference! Big, fluffy, crispy waffles!

Everybody loved them.  I love the fact that I can make the batter the night before and it is ready to cook in the morning.  Couldn't be easier to make - I always have the ingredients on hand.  The turned out light, fluffy and were the perfect weekday breakfast!

These were okay. They were light and crispy, but just not a great taste. They were super easy to make, but I think I would rather take an extra 5-10 minutes on a more involved recipe and eat great waffles.

Followed the recipe exactly and LOVED the outcome. There was a perfect crisp on the outside! My husband and I especially loved the sweet smell while they cooked. This waffle recipe has replaced my old one.

I've been looking for a waffle recipe I liked for years. Finally, I've found one! My boyfriend agreed, these waffles put store-bought and mix waffles to shame!

This recipe was bland and needed additional: 1/2 t Salt 2 T Sugar 2 t Vanilla and 1/4 C Oil to tenderize And possibly a 1/2 t of lemon juice which I might add next time.  Otherwise great basic recipe!

Easily accessible ingredients, but batter had a slight flatness to the taste. Followed others' advice regarding additional sugar and vanilla, but boyfriend still thought it wasn't sweetened. I thought sweetness wasn't an issue as I add lots of toppings to serve.

Delicious! This recipe is sooo good. I doubled the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of sugar. We had plenty of batter left over, so as the recipe indicates, I left it covered in the fridge. They were twice as good the next morning!!!!! From now on, I'll always make the batter at least a day in advance.

i have been looking for a hamemade waffle recipe forever and this has been the best one ever! my other waffles would come out soft and floppy and all i ever wanted was crispy golden waffles. i got the crispiest waffles from this recipe and on the first try. i used 8 packets of splenda when i halved the recipe and i also added a little bit extra vanilla and they tasted great, especially since i topped it with ice cream and banana foster! the waffle itself was great! definitley a  keeper recipe!

These turned out perfect.  I added 1 Tbs. brown sugar and cinnamon.  Ended up making a double batch and freezing left over waffles.  They turn out great when you pop them in toaster.

I have made these waffles many times! I always use all whole wheat flour and add 1 TB brown sugar. My best tip is to make all the waffles and freeze some.  Then on those busy mornings, you can just pop them in the toaster and have hot, crispy waffles!

These are sincerely yummy. I'm comparing recipes and tried Waffles II last weekend. This one is definitely my favorite out of the 2. A keeper! I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, doubled the vanilla and the sugar.

Very good.  Just like the recipe in the Betty Crocker's Cookbook but vanilla has been added.  I like the vanilla addition.  Makes fluffy waffles.  Usually make the Betty Crocker's waffles, but will now do this version with the vanilla.  In our world, vanilla makes things better when it comes to waffles and pancakes. Thank you!!

I followed the recipe exactly at first, and the waffles came out very eggy, both in texture and taste.  The flavor was so off, I ended up adding another tbsp sugar, another tsp vanilla, and a tbsp orange zest before I ended up with something I liked.  While they were salvageable, I would suggest to skip this recipe and keep looking for another, it wouldn't take much to surpass this one both in flavor and texture.

First effort at making waffles. Really pleased with how these turned out. I will take some suggestions for making them a little more healthy next time and see. This time I followed the recipe to the letter and the taste was great.

My family gives these waffles rave reviews. I use the recipe, although I do add a tad more vanilla.   This recipe makes double the amount of waffles. I use a double rectangle waffle maker, and easily get a dozen out of a regular batch.  The batter keeps well, and a quick whisk turns out great waffles even four days later.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I followed what the others said and doubled up on the sugar and vanilla. Plus I added 1/2 ts of cinnamon. I also made some cinnamon apples to go with the waffles.    They were a total hit in my family.  thanks a bunch. :D

I made these for dinner last night and they were a hit!  I threw everything in a blender and had delicious waffles within 10 minutes. Perfect for a busy weeknight or weekend breakfast. Yum!

Great recipe, a lot lighter than the recipe I tried with butter. Upon the advice of a few reviews, I doubled the sugar. I also used Half whole wheat, half white flour, delicious. I didn't separate the egg whites, but I did whip the eggs in my kitchenaid with the whisk until  very foamy, very light waffles.

I love these. They are so easy that my 11 year old made them and served me breakfast in bed! After making them several times we always now add a little extra sugar, vanilla and a dash of cinnamon - but that's just us, they are great as is and very easy to modify flavors to your tastes.

These waffles were pretty good, but I think they could be a little sweeter.  I cut the recipe in half but accidentally forgot to half the sugar, and I still thought they coul use a little extra.  Anyway, overall I thought they turned out well.  I left out the eggs because I'm allergic, and it didn't affect the recipe much, so that was nice.

Delicious waffles!  I followed one suggestion and added a touch of cinnamon.  I also threw in a handful of fresh blueberries (first cooked to soften). This was a hit at our house.

I made these a couple of weeks ago, scaling the recipe to serve 12.  I used cake flour (4 1/2 c.), fat-free milk, melted margarine (not oil), doubled the sugar, salt (Kosher) & vanilla.  I used 3 T. baking powder.  I made the batter the night before which turned out terrific.  It made plenty of waffles (corn, blueberry, plain)--enough to freeze or for guests.

These waffles are great the only change I'm going to make next time is replace the AP flour with white whole wheat pastry flour. This is definitely the waffle recipe that I use from now on.

My mom gave me this same recipe years ago and it sure is one of the best. The only thing I change is the oil. I use olive oil in them because it is better for your health  and you can't tell the difference. I also use 1 teas. of cinnamon and use 1 cup of whole wheat and 1 cup white flour. Very good recipe.

Made this recipe last weekend and come Friday, the family is still raving about them!  I used self-rising flour instead of the flour-baking powder-salt combo, and probably could've added about 2 more teaspoons baking powder to make them rise a bit more. Loved the tip to store leftover baked waffles between paper towels to absorb the moisture & keep them from sticking together.   They re-heated beautifully in the toaster oven after letting them come to room temp (stored in a gallon-sized Zip-loc bag to keep them from drying out).  We will have these often!

Excellent. We used a vintage waffle iron we picked up in brand new condition at a yard sale. It's a large waffle iron that makes 4 waffles at a time. The waffles took about 8 mins to cook on this and were soooo good. Didn't change a thing.

I just got a waffle maker for Christmas.  I found this recipe and it was awesome!  I read some reviews and separated the egg whites and beat them separately until fluffy.  Then I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and doubled the vanilla to be 1 tsp.  So yummy!  Thanks for this great recipe!

There's nothing wrong with this recipe, but it wasn't anything fantastic either.  The waffles didn't have a lot of flavor and came out a bit soggy.  We'll eat them all eventually (I made extra to freeze), but I'm still looking for a better recipe.  Maybe using 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter instead of oil would add some more flavor...

You can make this recipe sinful by subbing a half stick of butter for that half cup of oil.  And double the amounts of sugar and salt.  And I only put 3 tsp of baking powder.  So I guess this recipe is a good starting point, but I would definitely shnaz it up if I were you!

Wonderful! I made them as directed the first time and found them to bee too oily, so I substituted apple sauce the next time. They came out a little too soft. So next time, I'll do 1/2 and 1/2.  Thanks, my kids love these!

I have never made my own waffle batter before & it was very good. These smell wonderful when you open the waffle iron. Doubled the sugar & vanilla as others suggested. Why waste money on mixes you have to add eggs, milk & oil to anyway. Might as well go all the way & make your own.

Per other reviews, I too separated my eggs; beat the egg white till soft peaks formed and folded them in last.  Result--nice crispy waffles on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I too found them a bit bland, may trying adding a bit more sugar, or more vanilla or even vanilla beans and pumpkin flavoring (another reviewers suggestion) next time.  I will make these yummy waffles again!  thank you!

This is a great classic waffle recipe.    I liked the suggestion of whipping the egg whites, which truly makes the waffles crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Three other changes that I made were:  1.  Add 1/4 c. sugar - the extra sugar made my girls want to eat the waffles without the syrup.  2.  Used whole wheat pastry flour - it's white and fine, yet has the extra fiber that our family needs.  3.  Reduced the flour to 1-3/4 C and added 1/4 c. Malted Barley Flour.  This is a key ingredient in waffles and made them taste just like the ones you make at the Marriott Residence Inn or Fairfield Inn - I think it's the Carbon brand of waffle mix.  Anyway, the recipe is great and I've even hand-written the recipe in my recipe book.  Thanks for sharing this!

This is the waffle recipe I was looking for, they are perfect!  These are the waffles I'll make 'til the end of my days :)  The only thing I changed was adding a splash more vanilla, but that's just because I like a bit more vanilla.  Fluffy inside, crispy outside, just delicious.  My son is a happy boy this morning!

Excellent recipe.  I was too tired to beat the egg whites separately (lazy cooks unite!) and was surprised at how very light and fluffy these waffles were, with a lovely crispy outside. Yum!

This recipe yielded a nice light fluffy waffle.  I whipped the egg whites separately and folded them into the batter as some other reviewers suggested.  I also added a handful of fresh blueberries to the batter.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Very good!  Have already made it twice today and plan on freezing extras.  For the first batch, I used 2 cups wheat flour instead of the all purpose flour and the waffles had a more grainy texture that I wasn't too fond of.  The second batch, I compromised and used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup wheat flour - perfect!  Of course, I incorporated the suggestions of other reviewers:  2 Tablespoons of white sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.

Great recipe!  Nice and fluffy!  I did health-it-up by using King Arthur whole wheat flour in place of the white, aluminum free baking powder, 2 tbsp real maple syrup for the sugar, olive oil for the veg oil and added a dash of cinnamon.

This was my first time making homemade waffles and this recipe is soooo incredibly easy and they turned out awesome.  I used whole wheat flour, doubled the vanilla and added a little cinnamon.  Half way through making them I saw 2 bananas that were going bad so I mashed them up and made banana waffles.  Turned out pretty good, they don't get as crispy on the outside and turn a little dark. They taste like banana bread though!  I make these ahead of time and freeze them for my 2 year old so she doesn't care what they look like, she just knows they taste good :) Edited: I sub applesauce for the oil, egg whites in place of the egg. Still tastes great and way less calories.

Very easy and quite good. Used one cup all purpose flour and one cup wheat flour (in an effort to use up some of the wheat flour I had on hand). Also served with fresh, homemade strawberry sauce, whipped cream and topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar.

If you've ruined breakfast by screwing up the waffles ( I sound like an opening for a promo  :), this is a fail safe recipe. I wasn't paying attention, (multi-tasking on everything but preparing breakfast), to the order nor the proper combination of ingredients and dumped them altogether into a bowl ...I looked into the mess I had made and pulled out my mini-hand mixer that I use to whip heavy cream into whip cream and blended it together for 2-3 min., until it was creamy. To add to this mess, I threw in an equal amt of almond extract matching the vanilla. These waffles turned out perfect, light and fluffy, melted in your mouth, can't wait to cook the rest of the batch; I froze half the batter. I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top and poured maple syrup on top for an added sugar high, love this recipe...a real winner!

The first time I tried it, it was so so, but easy to make because I used a blender. I also tried to make it healthier by grinding oatmeal in place of some of the flour.  The second time I made it, I separated the eggs and folded in the whites and it was AMAZING. The only complaint I have is the 1/2 cup of oil. The next time, I'll try substituting some applesauce to make it healthier.

These were great.  I tripled the recipe to make more later this week.  My 9-yr old daughter mixed these up and she said the batter was very easy to make.  They were nice and fluffy and browned beautifully.  I added fresh bluberries to two of them and they were delicious.

I tried this recipe twice. The first time was great!  I used  half whole wheat flour. The second time I didn't have enough baking powder so I tried half soda and it flopped big time!  Just a note for people--DON'T use baking soda!!

We do not use bottled vegetable oil for any baking/cooking, so I used melted butter, and these came out wonderfully.  The whole family gobbled up each and every one. Next time I may double so I can freeze some for a fast breakfast morning.  Thanks!

VERY good! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I made some changes that gave these a lot more flavor.  I did what others suggested and folded the eggs in at the end which gave these waffles a perfect texture (crispy, yet soft on the inside).  I also did 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1/2. I added 1 tsp brown sugar, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Instead of oil, I used 1/2 c. cinnamon applesauce.  These were delish, and I will make them again! Thanks!!!

Most waffle recipes are dense...this one turned out light and fluffy, perfect! The second time we made them we did brown sugar instead of white, and doubled the vanilla, and used raw milk. Even fluffier than before! Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

If you try whole wheat flour, I strongly do not recommend using all whole wheat flour. We did this, and they turned out very grainy and bland... We also thought the salt to baking powder was off, as we could taste some of a baking powder flavor in ours. Since it had other good reviews though, I might try again with just normal flour.

My old waffle recipe had me jumping through "special" steps in order to make the "perfect" waffle.  I got tired of it taking so long to put together and came on here to find a different recipe.  THIS ONE IS AWESOME!!!  Quick to put together, fluffy, and slightly crispy on the outside.  Plus I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups flour, 1 cup buckwheat, and 1 cup fine ground whole wheat.  I wasn't really expecting them to turn out so well because I was making the batter "heavier."  I'm keeping this one and throwing away my old recipe.

I always double this recipe and then freeze the waffles for toasting later.  After seeing a recipe for Gingerbread waffles on this site- I add some cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice which takes this recipe to a whole new level!

Super Delicious recipe! I used SELF rising flour and omitted the salt & baking powder, and it worked perfectly! I also beat my egg whites seperately and folded them in last. Based on other reviews I used 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 Tbls. sugar. I folded in 1 cup of frozen blueberries at the very end and cooked in my waffle maker for 5 minutes. AWESOME! My waffle maker made 8 waffles using this recipe. This one is a keeper and will be my regular waffle recipe. Super easy and superb! If you add in blueberries-leave them frozen. They make for a really great Blueberry waffle!

Delicious! Light, fluffy, tender and pretty easy to throw together. A keeper. Thanks for sharing! Note*... they did seem to brown a little better with oil than with the non stick spray, but delicious either way.

This is easy to whip up for breakfast as I always have all the ingredients readily available.  This is so much better than purchasing the ready-made mixes at the store.  They freeze well!  We reheat them in the toaster, spread Nutella on it, and have it with vanilla ice cream for a spectacular dessert.

I had high expectations based on the reviews, maybe it was just me but I didn't like them that much.

I made these waffles in my belgian Krups waffle maker and they were very good.  I used crisco oil and maybe next time will use butter(melted).  I might try them in a regular waffler maker instead of the belgian one...but I would highly recommend them.

These were OK.  I made exactly as recipe stated.  Kind of bland.  My wife really liked them, just not me so much.

Yummy. These waffles were delicious. My kids devoured these things. We put the extra waffles in the freezer and ate them later and they were just as good.

Per other reviewers' suggestions, I made these with whole-wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, and added 2 tsp. of brown sugar and some cinnamon - they were fantastic!! I made the Cinnamon Cream Syrup to go with them - a perfect compliment to an already great waffle.

This was decent. It was easy and quick to make and texture wise was perfect. It was crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The problem was that it was a bit bland - I didn't think even the butter or syrup enhanced it. I would not make this again, but I appreciate you posting the recipe. Thanks.

I used whole wheat flour and doubled the vanilla.  They were very light and fluffy although I did have a little trouble with them sticking and ended up using a lot of oil on the pan.  Depending on your waffel iron it may not be good for it to use a non-stick spray, mine says not too.  The propellant can damage the non stick coating so I use vegtable oil and a brush to apply it.

Made these two weekends ago...came out crispy, but that is all they had going for them. I ate them just so I didn't waste them.
I tried another recipe off of another website this last weekend and will be using it from now on - not this one.

Perfect waffles.  They are nice and crunchy on the outside but light inside.  This is so much better than using bisquick and just as fast.

I got a new waffle maker for Christmas and used this recipe when using it the first time.  My waffles were delicious and I whipped this recipe up in no time flat.  I did beat my egg whites as suggested by one reviewer and the end result was waffles that were fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  For us, this recipe made 5 waffles.

These are wonderful.  I will never use a boxed mix again when this recipe is easy and tasty.  I was able to save the batter we didn't eat in the refrigerator and use it the next morning.  So good :)

Very nice- waffles came out of my Belgian maker lightly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I usually use Aunt Jemima Original mix but this was so much better it's worth the small extra effort.

I thought we would try a new waffle recipe, and with the good reviews chose this one.  I felt these were light, but not too flavorful and a little on the dry side.  I have a wonderful buttermilk waffle recipe that was my Grandmothers who was an excellent baker and cook.  They are moist and have a great flavor, Grandma's are still the best!!!

These waffles were tasty and fragrant with a light texture.  I made them a few times, and they tasted better and were lighter when I whisked the egg whites separately.

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular all-purpose flour.  Followed another reviewers' advice and beat in the egg whites as last step.  Rest of recipe followed exactly.  This made up 5 yummy belgian waffles. Next time I will use all whole wheat flour.  The best waffle recipe we have tried from this site!

This recipe is excellent!  I have made these waffles three times and each time they have turned out great.  They are crispy on the outside and light and fluffy inside.  I did make some alterations to the recipe to make it healthier.  I used half whole wheat flour and olive oil instead.  I have also experimented with adding other items such as cinnamon or blueberries as other reviewers have suggested and they turned out great every time.  This will be the only recipe I use for waffles from now on.

I'm not sure it's fair to rate this as I changed/added(as usual).
Anyways I doubled it.
For 1/2 the white flour I used spelt flour 2 tbs. wheat germ and bran a pinch of cinnamon and olive oil instead of vegetable oil and instead of sugar used maple syrup. Soya instead of cow. Served with homemade peach sauce/chunks and blueberry syrup.
Delish..

This was an excellent recipe.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that the recipe said you could keep the batter in the fridge for up to a week.  I made the batter one day and got amazing waffles, the kids gobbled them up.  The next day I pulled the batter out of the fridge, whisked it up, and put it in the waffle iron.  It was so runny it ran out of the iron and onto the counter.  Not a good recipe to keep in the fridge!!!

Family loves these, very light. You can add any fruit to these or cinnamon.  I make an extra batch to freeze so the kids can take them out & pop them in the toaster, much better than Eggo Waffles :)

These waffles were delicious... I made only a few changes and they came out great. I added about 3 tablespoons of sour cream, 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and melted butter instead of the oil. Everyone loved them!

Excellent base waffle recipe. We always add some type of fruit to our waffles. Lately, I've been added about 1 cup of fresh blueberries. DELISH!

we've made these a few times already, the kids absolutely love them.  the only thing I'm not fond of is that after the sit it gets soggy, even if they're laid out on cooling racks in single layer, but it's still a good recipe

I made these this morning because I didn't have any mix left.  I will never use mix again!  These were great.  Simple to make, all normal ingredients that I already had on hand.  My family and I loved them.  We made a simple mixed berry syrup to top them and they were devine!  Thank you.

Great recipe! I subbed egg replacer for the eggs just 'cause, and they turned out amazing. Perfectly crispy on the outside, doughy and cakey on the inside. Best waffles I've ever made.

I usually make Aunt Jamima, but I ran out of mix.  This recipe is very bland.  I even added pecans to the mix and 1 tsp. more sugar and a little more vanilla. I would just stick to the boxed mix next time.  
Did crisp up nicely.  Didn't get very fluffy though.

What a nice waffle recipe!  I have used this one several times before, but today I truly remembered how good it was and I wanted to share.  I wanted to cheer up a sick friend, so I invited her over for waffles with cherries and whipped cream, we both loved it.  Take care to beat your eggs first though, that way you'll have a deliciously fluffy waffle.

These were pretty good.  I was out of Bisquick so I made these.  Bisquick is definitely easier but these were fine when I was in a pinch.  My husband did prefer the Bisquick ones though.

We were out of Bisquick, so I started searching this site and went with this recipe because of the huge number of positive reviews. We had them for dinner tonight and they were really good! (I always hated Bisquick ones - taste like biscuits with syrup...). I used 2 1/2 tbsp white sugar and 2 tsp vanilla. I didn't change anything else, ingredient-wise. I did beat the whites separately and folded them in at the end and we did sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese on half of them (after pouring batter into the waffle iron). My husband grew up with cheddar cheese waffles. We used a Mickey Mouse iron and I got about 15 waffles with this recipe. The whole family wolfed them down! I am going to continue to play around with it and try different flavors, but it is already saved in my box.  Thanks.

These were a breeze to make. They came out beautiful and yummy. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I added 2 tbsp more sugar and 2 tsp green tea powder (matcha) to make them into green tea waffles.

Great recipes!  Thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers, I:

1. Doubled the sugar and vanilla
2. Beat the egg whites and yolks separately.  I folded in the fluffy egg whites and the waffles came out nice and fluffy.
3. I used the measuring scoop that came with waffle maker (3/4 cup) and this was perfect.

I want to add cinnamon next time.

Great waffles!

This is a very good waffle recipe if you like classic light inside crip outside waffles!  We slightly prefer heartier waffles but these were delicious.  Also I used 1/3 King Arthur "White Whole Wheat" and they came out fine.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg.

It was my first time making waffles from scratch. The first few came out and tasted a little bland to me... better than Bisquick but nothing to fancy. I then doubled the sugar and vanilla, added some cinnamon and was much more pleased with the results. Not bad, but wasn't too impressed.

Great recipe, but after tasting a waffle with the recommended sugar and vanilla, I had to agree with other reviews, that the waffle tasted bland.  So i too added twice the sugar and vanilla extract, which really boosted the flavor without being too sweet!

These were excellent in texture, but lacked a little something in taste. I admit, even Eggos are bland without butter or syrup, but I believe a 5 star would be able to stand alone taste-wise. I had to double the batch the family liked these so much. Will make again, as my family likes waffles with peanut butter and syrup, and these are a great basic waffle.

Took other reviewers' advice and cut the baking soda down to 3 teaspoons.  I used a heaping T. of sugar and added about 3/4 t. of cinnamon.  Came out very tasty!

My husband is a pancake lover, but for some reason he asked for waffles this morning...it has been forever since i've made them...so i pulled this recipie up, it had a good rating...these turned out perfect...instead of adding the sugar, i added cinnamonsugar..lots'maybe twotablespoons...then once they were finished cooking i sprinkled them with the cinammonsugar as well...HE LOVED THEM!!! Thanks for a Great Recipie!!!

Very good, basic recipe. Moist, yet crispy, and perfect with complementing butter and syrup -- the way homemade waffles should be!

These were good, but a little dense.  I think next time I might try separating the eggs and whipping the whites, as some have suggested.

Much better than store bought pancake waffle mix.. I strongly advise you to spray the waffle maker like directions say. These are so light and fluffy they stick! Taste great though! Super easy and I love that you can leave the batter in the fridge! Great for nice hot easy breakfast for the kids!

These were great waffles if made as is.   I made these twice, the first time as the recipe was and they were perfect.  Second time changed oil to butter(as another reviewer had done)...not a great idea.  Came out mushy and soggy.  So stick to the recipe as is and they are fantastic plus really easy to make!

ROUND 2 tried them again, but this time used my stand mixer and realy whipped up the eggs. i also did about 50% organic oat flour. they were once again delish.. thanks for sharing

These waffles were fantastic, with a few minor adjustments.  I added an additional tablespoon of sugar and a whole teaspoon of Mexican vanilla.  I made this in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and used a Waring Pro waffle maker set to #4.  I had one a little after I made the batter yesterday and again just now for breakfast.  Absolutely wonderful with butter and syrup.  Very crisp and brown on the outside and very moist and tender on the inside.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make these again.

I doubled the recipe.  I must not have gotten the dry ingred. mixed good.  A couple times we got strong taste of baking powder.  I froze the rest for breakfast this week before school.  Good recipe - just make sure the baking powder gets mixed VERY WELL!

Excellent!  We served them with syrup, froze some and then popped them in the toaster (still frozen) the next day and had them with strawberries and cream (excellent again!).  This was the 1st waffle recipe we have tried and I think we hit the jackpot.  Thanks.

Great basic waffle recipe.  I did add a little extra sugar as suggested.  The outside was nice and crispy and the inside was moist and chewy - we loved 'em!

Great waffle recipe!  Quick and easy to make, delicious to eat.  I used brown sugar and added some ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to give the waffles a gingerbread flavor and served them with pumpkin butter.  My husband loved them.  Since this recipe basically calls for just mixing all of the ingredients together, i used my big 4 cup measuring cup to measure out all of the liquids and mix them up first, then I just measured the dry ingredients right into the measuring cup and beat them in with a whisk.  I have fewer dishes and I used the measuring cup to just pour the batter right onto the waffle iron!

Great simple recipe that you can build on.  Everything is in your pantry and just add ingrediants to suit your family.  For us we use a 1/4 cup sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, double vanilla, and stir in chocolate chips.  Our picky three year old will eat a whole square without complaining and requests them on his own.

I've been looking for a waffle recipe that I could make ahead of time and would keep for a few days to use when I go camping.  Also during the week I can use just enough batter to make 2-3 waffles (belgian type) and put the rest in the frig for the next day.  Tried several recipes, including several yeast recipes, but nothing was as light and crispy as this one.  (The waffles actually taste better if the batter sits for a day!) Doubled the sugar and the vanilla and used butter instead of oil.  **NOTE: During our last camping trip the power went out and we couldn't use the waffle maker so we thinned out the batter with a little water and made crepes -- came out really good!

I was very unimpressed with the flavor of these.  I tried what other reviewers had suggested, added extra sugar, some maple syrup, extra vanilla and some cinammon.  My 4 year old though these were great, so I will freeze the rest.

For having tried many of the numerous recipes on this site, these waffles were probably as close to what I've been looking for as possible.  They were a smidge less crispy than I was hoping but the inside was very nice, fairly light and a great consistancy for the iron.  I will make them again and you can thank this weeks 'featured cook - LatinaCook' for having it in her collection of recipe pictures! Thanks

Middle of the road on this one.  Reliable texture and browning, but something lacking in flavor.

A great basic waffle batter that yields tasty waffles even after a few days in the fridge.  Easy to customize and the waffles freeze well, too.  Thanks!

Have used this twice with great success - results as good or better than my more complicated recipes.  Used 1/2 whole wheat - and added 2 Tbs. brown sugar and about 1 tsp. to a double recipe - great!

This is the ultimate waffle recipe. It takes no time to make up the mix, you're only limited by your waffle maker. :) Whenever I make these, my two-year old gobbles up her entire waffle (and then begs Daddy for some of his!). I want to try these with some chopped up bananas or strawberries, or maybe some whole blueberries.. Oh, and these are great after being stuck in the freezer and then toasted. A little butter, maybe some peanut butter, and some syrup, you're good to go! Thanks, Ultra B, for a great recipe!

I've been looking for a waffle recipe that tastes good with whole wheat flour, and this is THE one! Delicious!!  My kids, 5 and 9, gobbled them up. The only change I made was replacing the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I might try less baking powder next time as they have a slight aftertaste.    Thanks so much for the recipe post!

Good waffles. Doubled the vanilla- thought about doubling the sugar but my hubby's sweet tooth is not as sweet as mine so for fear of them being too sweet, I went against my gut and didn't double the sugar.Next time, I will! Otherwise, very tasty :)

This is a great basic waffle recipe.  I did double the sugar and I thought it seemed like a lot of Baking powder so I cut it in half but the first two were a bit flat so I added the extra and the rest were fluffy and great.  I had way too much batter so I cooked the rest to the point that they were almost done and then cooled them and stored them in the freezer.  Just toast them up in a toaster and they are great.  Way better than EGGO:)  Thanks for the recipe!

very light and fluffy.  the amount of oil in the recipe seems a little much, but it doesn't work as well if you reduce it.

This was a great waffle recipe.  I made these for Mother's Day brunch and they were a hit.  I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg because my kids love cinnamon.  I doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers for the freezer!

This recipe was amazing after a little tweaking.  I used almond milk for the milk, added about a cup of chopped pecans, one cup of whole wheat flour, and about a tablespoon of vanilla.  I served them with butter and powdered sugar.  My family loved the crunchy texture and the wonderful taste.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This recipe was definately easy. I ran out of oil so I used 1/4c. oil 1/4c. melted butter. I also added the vanilla extract and cinnamon that was suggested by other reviewers.  Good for a fast put together breakfast!

These waffles were extremely good with a couple of modifications. I stirred a couple of handfuls of ground pecans into the batter. They are mainly for texture, so even if you're not a pecan fan you'll still want to use them. I also added some shaved bittersweet chocolate to last bit of the batter. It was delicious!

I varied the recipe a little to make it a tad healthier.  Instead of eggs I put in egg beaters.  I used a cup of Whole Wheat Flour and a cup of Soy Flour.  1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  It turned out wonderful and my kids loved it.  I will use this recipe over and over.

Add my two cents to this.  Used half whole wheat, half white flour once, and the other time all white.  Liked all white better, less chewy.  Simple to make and tasty.  No reason to use another basic waffle recipe (it is just basic, though).  This kept great in the fridge which sure made breakfast during the week more inspiring!

This is a great recipe.  My husband said they were the best waffles he ever tasted and asks for them all the time.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour and substituted half of the oil with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesause to give it a little less fat.  I also followed the suggestions of other people and doubled the sugar and vanilla. YUM!!!!

these are truly spectacular.  My husband and I never eat waffles at home, but since the day I tried these, they have become a regular week-end treat.  The vanilla is imperative to this recipe, and I might mention that I use Mexican Vanilla.

great base recipe, i made a few changes in ingredients, substituting with whole wheat flour, brown sugar, melted butter instead of oil, and yogurt instead of milk, i also used a teaspoon of baking soda instead of the baking powder because the yogurt is acidic.  i followed the directions except for folding in the flour gently after beating everything else together.  It turned out excellent.

Delicious!  I kept them warm in the oven and they were not soggy like most recipes.  Don't try to substitute healthier flours, because they do get soggy.

These were very good basic waffles. I used whole wheat flour. The kids really seemed to like them.

Used a belgian waffle maker and the waffles were light, crispy, and practically melted in our mouths!  Didn't make any adjustments this time, but will definitely try out the buttermilk/soymilk/extra sugar/etc variations in the future (just to jazz things up!)  YUMMY!

These are not the ultimate waffles ever, but, this is a nice base recipe. I decreased the baking powder to 1 tsp and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup. Will add some more baking powder back in next time. I may add a touch more sugar next time since I have a husband that doesn't like syrup on waffles. These were fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. This made a total of 12 waffles (3 sheets) on my waffle iron. I averaged them sitting in the iron about 4 minutes if that helps anyone. My first batch I kept opening and closing the lid which didn't help matters. The nice thing about this recipe is that I know exactly what I am feeding my children and it sure isn't store bought waffles filled with preservatives. Thank you for sharing Ultra B.

My children wanted waffles and I was out of waffle mix, so we tried this recipe.  The waffles came out nice and fluffy and perfect everytime, better then any waffle mix!!!  We will be using this everytime.  I also upped the sugar to 1/4 cup and the vanilla to 1 tbs.  Perfect.  Thank you for sharing.

I came to the site because I was craving waffles and had run out of waffle mix.  My husband and daughter said that the waffles were perfect!  My husband was wondering how I cooked them so well this time.

Very good recipe.  The only substitutions I made were to use Egg Beaters instead of eggs and fat free milk.  The waffles were light and fluffy even though the batter was a little thicker than my usual recipe.  I topped them with the Cinnabutter recipe (also on this site) and that made them even better.  Wll definitely make again.

These were a hit!  My young kids absolutely loved them.  I doubled the sugar, but it probably wasn't necessary--although I really liked the slightly sweeter waffle.  

Next time I'll make this recipe with whole wheat flour.

(We use Ener-G egg replacer due to an egg allergy.)

These waffles were very good following the recipe as written.  Were also good frozen then warmed up in the microwave with butter pats on top of them.  Good for a quick breakfast on a school morning.   I can only imagine that adding more sugar and vanilla and/or using buttermilk, evaporated milk or cream for all or part of the milk would make them even more delicious.  I may try modifications next time but we enjoyed them as is.

Great waffles, but made a few changes.  As suggested previously, doubled the sugar and used 1/2 cup butter instead of oil. Didn't have milk, substituted canned evaporated milk mixed with water. Beat egg whites until stiff and folded in last. Fit perfectly into my waffle maker x 3. Will definitely make again.

I made them into cinnamon waffles, by adding brown sugar and cinnamon to taste.  Everyone loves them.  (Even people who don't traditionally care for waffles or pancakes.)

good recipe, and smells SO good when it's cooking! I've done various substitutions - used whole wheat pastry flour, applesauce for the oil, stevia for the sugar, added cinnamon, added protien powder... all turn out just fine. Thanks!

These were great. I added a little more sugar and a little bit of brown sugar on the second batch. I also used apple sauce unstead of the oil.  Everyone ate them and loved it. I will be using this every time i make waffles now!

Excellent! I am so happy with this recipe. Taste just like the waffle cones on Boardwalks and fairs! I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the batter cause I like sweet waffles so I don't have to use much syrup. Strawberries tasted awesome w/ these! This is my new and permanant waffle recipe!

My kids loved these waffles better than any I had ever made in the past. I followed some suggestions from previous reviewers though and used buttermilk instead of white milk and added a sprinkle of cinnamon. I won't use any other recipe from now on. THANKS A TON!!!!!

These were easy to make, but not as good as either the yeast based recipies or the boxed mixes.  These tasted overly eggy and seemed a little soggy.

I used part wholewheat flour. I think I will try using just all-purpose flour next time coz it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The batter got stuck to my waffle maker machine too, so I used the rest of the batter to make pancakes... I'll try this again though with a new waffle maker next time.

These waffles were okay.  We ate them, but I just didn't think they had a lot of flavor.  I'll be going back to my trusty buttermilk waffle recipe after this.
But if you want something simple and easy to make, these aren't too bad.  They beat the box mix anyway!  :-)

I made my first batch of waffles with this recipe (did not double sugar or vanilla), topped them off with strawberry sauce and whipped cream, and they tasted excellent. The waffles were light and crisp, just as I like them. Can't wait to try them with ice cream...mmmm!

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Easy and delicious.  I do school-age daycare and the kids loved it!  I even used about 1/2 whole wheat flour - they never knew I was sneaking some nutrition in there!  Next time - a double batch!

I was looking for a lower-fat/less oil waffle recipe. Could not find one yet - so I tried this one. They were very good. Consistency was great. Had good flavor-the vanilla  and sugar amount was just right, for us. Made up fluffy and browned nicely at 3 minutes, on my pre-heated waffle maker. I have made waffles many different ways-from scratch and from prepared mixes. Two, eleven year olds, said "these are the best you ever made"!  And, I LOVED using only the one bowl method of this recipe. It was more convienient and less mess to clean up. Until I find a "healthier" version, I definitely will use this recipe's version. 
Thank you, Ultra B, for sharing.

OMG. Fabulously easy and yummy! I put all ingredients inside my ninja blender and mixed. No changes to the recipe, no need actually. So many reviews with changes made my head spin lol, at some point it’s not the same recipe.

Look good, do not taste good! Was so disappointed.. was almost like they were stale or something. Weird.
We threw out the rest of the batter.

I followed the instructions and it was not good.  \mix all liquid ingredients together before adding the dry or you will end up with a clumpy mess.

I did everything the same, they were very delicious. I most definitely will be making these again ,but maybe I will do brown sugar instead of white sugar next time.

I swapped the all purpose flour for sorghum, wheat and ragi flour instead (since they’re healthier being whole grain), the white sugar for brown and added cinnamon and nutmeg because I like the taste. They were really nice... crispy on the outside and moist and spongy on the inside. I ate them with homemade mango jam, bananas and maple syrup. Thank you. Will use the recipe again. :)

Used gluten free flour (Nasmaste flour blend).  The waffles were very good but I would decrease the baking powder by 20%.  These were a hit with the family.

First time using a waffle iron. I saw the “can use whole wheat flour” in the preface, so I used 1- 1/4 cup of flour, 2/3 cup ground quick oats (ground in my coffee bean grinder), and the rest ground flax to make up the full 2 cups. I realized I had no milk, so I used 1/2 cup half and half (don’t judge! Lol) some unsweetened almond milk and two big “globs” of homemade unsweetened plain Greek style yogurt, probably 3-4 Tbsps. The rest as is, except I put all the dry ingredients together and the wet in a 2cup measuring cup. I whipped the wet with a fork and then poured it into the dry. Took several batches to figure out  a little less than 1/3 cup fills the corners but does not overflow the sides. Hubby likes a little softer 2 1/2  to 3 minutes and I like them closer to 3 1/2 to 4 minutes cook time... but then again I like my toast dark .

We love these waffles.  We lightened them up a little by cutting the oil back to 2 Tbsp and the sugar back to 1 Tbsp.  As my boys exclaimed, "Mom, these are THE BEST waffles you've ever made!".  'Nuf said.

Used a bubble maker. They were soft and fluffly. Not as crispy as everyone said. Felt more like a pancake but really good. Will use this recipe again and try mix ins.

This recipe serves me perfectly! It's spot on. I make it with melted vegan butter and almond milk without any issues. I have fun adding in different mix-ins: chopped nuts, fresh fruits or chocolate chips.

These turned out ice. I made 2 adjustments.
 I only used 2tsp of baking powder instead of 4. Mine still came out very fluffy.
I also adjusted the sugar to 2 tbsp sugar. 
End result the sugar addition made no difference , I thought it was bland, but syrup and and confectioners sugar as a topping was delicious.
Will use this recipe again, I printed it out for future use.

I made this recipe, first time ever really making waffles from scratch as I never took the time. My wife is a waffle lover, she enjoys them more than I do myself. So she asked me to make her some, I found this recipe it quick and super super easy to do. I highly recommend it! Th waffles turned out amazing so fluffy and rich, my wife loved them so much that she asked for more.

these are very good, but mine turned out a batter very thin, and I added about another 1/4 cup of flour.  Only change I made was to cut back the oil and use orange oil instead of vanilla.  I made one with toasted pecans.  We have plenty of left-overs that we will enjoy in the future.

Turned out perfect

These waffles are amazing! Nice and fluffy and not too sweet so you can make them sweet or savoury. The only thing I changed was adding a bit extra vanilla. Can’t wait to make them again!

Tweaked this a little per another review. I did double the sugar and double the vanilla. I also added cinnamon (I love cinnamon). I did separate the yolk and white. Mixed the yolk with all the ingredients then whisked the egg white until soft peaks and folded into batter. Yes the extra step added that AMAZING touch. Thank you to that other review.

Made a half recipe. Added some chocolate chips for flavour.
A bit crunchy, a bit fluffy, and not dense in the slightest. Will make again.

Finally found a great recipe that makes my waffles come out crunchy but soft on the inside!  I added just a little bit more sugar and used a stick of butter instead of vegetable oil.

Half wheat, half white flour. Used buttermilk, tripled sugar, three eggs, separated and whipped whites to stiff peaks then folded in at end. Used butter instead of oil in same quantity. Doubled vanilla. Excellent.

Love this recipe. It made  light fluffy waffles. I whipped eggs then whipped in sugar. This was followed by whipping in oil. This made for a nice fluffy mixture. Next I added milk and vanilla thoroughly mixed it and finally rest of the dry ingredients which had a half cup whole wheat flour replacing same amount of white flour.

These are delicious and easy to make! My kids love them every time and even eat them plain. I didnt have eggs so used banana and flaxseed and they were still delicious. The bananas added sweetness so you didnt even need to use much syrup.

Usually I read reviews first but when I saw the numbers and the rating I just jumped right in as the waffle iron preheated! This was a great recipe and short of adding a little cinnamon for cinnamon lovers  out there. 15 minutes later we were eating our yummy crispy waffles; just the way we like them! Great recipe - thanks!

This is so simple and delicious.  I really like to beat it extra long with the eggs before adding flour, this helps make it extra fluffy. they make the best chicken and waffles. Excellent recipe!

Makes nothing less than the perfect waffle! I use all the batter and freeze the waffles in a freezer baggie. Reheat at 350° until warm. No more awful waffles (store-bought frozen waffles)!

These are also great if you replace vanilla extract with half the amount of almond extract. My wife loves it too!

I made the recipe as is besides adding 1 more tbsp sugar as suggested by other reviewers. 
The waffles were great! Super fluffy and very nice waffle flavours . Could do with some fruit sauce or powdered sugar but overall I really enjoyed them with the maple syrup (real!) And butter combo. Would make again .

I make this recipe all the time - it’s quick & easy and I like that you don’t have to beat egg whites or anything first. They’re not the fluffiest waffles, but we like the way they turn out. I’ve swapped out half the flour for whole wheat flour, and they still taste great.

Ok. I did not make this exactly as stated because I have a kid who’s allergic to dairy, didn’t have enough oil, and I wanted to add protein. But I’m giving 5 stars because it adapted beautifully, and everybody had multiple servings. My adjustments were as follows: subbed almond milk, replaced some of flour (less than half) with a mixture of whole wheat and almond flour, subbed half (or more) oil with applesauce. They were still light and fluffy and delicious.

They were tasty but not crispy as I would have hoped.  It could be the waffle iron however.  That's why it's getting 4 stars.

These waffles were delicious! These are the first waffles that I have made and tried and they were perfect. I eat these waffles with a hard fried egg and butter toast on the side. I don't particularly like eggs but they were alright. I also cut up strawberries and ate those on the waffles. I would definitely make these waffles again.

Nope nope nope. The taste of vegetable oil does nothing for these. Of course, set to 2 on the griddle, they may not have been as brown, but at 3 they were nice and crispy.

If vegetable oil is used as the recipe calls for, definitely cut it in half. I cut it in half and they were great. I could not imagine this recipe with the full half a cup. I doubled the vanilla, beat the egg whites separately and folded them in. Very good.

I love the taste and crispness BUT I don’t like mixing the flour into the fluffy eggs. Feels like a sin! Lol I would put the everything dry in the flour and the milk in the eggs then combine the two. Otherwise a great recipe!

Good recipe! Not a lot of flavor, but the waffles didn’t tear apart in the middle or stick to the iron, so that’s always a plus!  They also browned well without becoming crispy.

There is not enough sugar in the recipe. You need a fair amount of sugar to get golden crispy waffles and these turned out floppy even after exceeding the cook time on our waffle irons hotest setting.

I made this recipe to the t but forgot my favorite ingredient, the vanilla! DOH! It was still very good, I realized I had buttermilk after the fact, but it was crispy, fluffy and tasty. I added a handful of blueberries to my husbands and sons and I could still have plain ones. I would double so you can have frozen on the go breakfast later. Mmmmm these would be good with pecans too!

These waffles turned out fantastic! I halved the recipe at first just to try it out. I let my stand mixer whip up my egg until I had the other ingredients ready, add, mix & pour! Super simple & easy to adjust the liquid to your desired consistency. I like crispy waffles, my husband likes them a bit softer & this was easy to do both.  On my second round, I added blueberries on top of my batter in the waffle iron for perfect distribution & they were fantastic.  I even cut the leftover waffles in half & reheated in the toaster & everyone loved them.  Great recipe!

I can personally vouche for this one. I've been making it for 5 years and if I dont make this on the weekends the family riots lol. they think I've got the best waffles in the world. You can add cinnamon or Pumkin spices if that's what floats your boat. But bottom line make it just as is and you're gonna be number 1 on breakfast duty

Great recipe except a little confusing on the first step but my waffles came out great! I will use this recipe again. I used a square waffle maker so there were less waffles than I expected so I will double the recipe next time to make it 16 waffles not 8. Totally recommend this recipe.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. My entire family adores it! We substitute the eggs with bananas and top them with whipped cream, cinnamon, and maple syrup - they are heavenly to say the least.

This is not a recipe that I will try again.  The waffles were very dense and had no taste. Very disappointed.

Good waffles.  Very dense and fluffy. Almost sponge-like. Not my favorite waffle recipe. Won’t make this one again.

This recipe was wonderful, but I had to make some adjustments to the measurements. I added one more tablespoon of sugar and decreased the baking powder by one tsp to avoid overflow in the waffle maker.

Excellent waffles.
I made them with great success with and without changes. I substituted applesauce for the oil, soy milk for the milk, and Flax "egg" for the eggs and they came out fantastic. Oh, but I threw them in the toaster oven for a couple minutes because they weren't quite as crispy with the applesauce.

Great mix that goes together fast and tastes as almost as good as the expense mix we've been buying.  A little extra vanilla and some butter in place of oil should make it every bit as good for a fraction of the price. Batter is thick but the waffles are light. We made 2 full-iron waffles three days over the course of a week, and the ones the third time were as tasty as the ones the first.

Added a bit of water to help the batter spread out in the iron. Worked like a charm. Butter also works just as good as veggie oil. When using butter, use 1/4 cup.

Delicious waffles, light and airy, a delightful texture. Like other reviewer’s, I added cinnamon and since I didn’t have brown sugar I added organic raw cane sugar. A definite will-make-this-again recipe! Thank you!!

Tastes great! I made the batter exactly as the recipe instructed and my wife and kids loved it, as did I. I used a waffle iron that makes the waffle in the shape of Olaf from Frozen so leaving the batter cooking for three minutes or more nearly burned it because of the skinny twig arms. I had to go just under three minutes and they came out perfect. Made the left over batter about six days later and it definitely holds up for six days.

This recipe is really good, better than the other ones I've tried. The only change that I made was that I didn't add any oil to waffle iron and they turned out better than when you add the oil.

Crispy exterior and fluffy inside. I thought the batter was too runny, but left it alone, and I'm glad I did. This will be my go-to waffle recipe.

Made as directed. Will make again. Might increase sugar, but then again after adding strawberries and syrup made it sweeter.

This recipe only made seven waffles. Apparently one waffle is a serving size these days. Do not worry though, there were only three of us so we were able have two each. But I guess we will not be having leftovers. I recommend making two batches. I put it in my Dutch oven and it was so much better, highly recommend. Add cumin for a delightful surprise!- one cup should do!

I followed other's advice and whipped the egg whites separately then folded them into to the rest of the batter. They are delicious and light and crispy. I made them all on the same day then froze those that weren't consumed. They are also delicious reheated!

Definitely beat the egg whites separately, so worth it! I also used more sugar, more vanilla, and added a bit of cinnamon. Very yummy and the extra are easily placed in a ziplock bag for a quick breakfast later!

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly! I set the waffle maker to the max. Then I used a soup ladle to  spoon batter into large cups to customize toppings. My kids got to choose between blueberry, very vanilla, almond extract, walnut, chocolate chip. Favorites were the blueberry, chocolate chip, and extra vanilla extract. Thank you for sharing the recipe! I've made waffles many times before with the recipe in the book that came with the waffle maker, but this one was perfect!

This makes a great waffle. Light and soft on the inside yet nice and crispy on the outside!

I have a go-to overnight recipe that I hadn't planned for and found this one that was highly rated, so I made it in a pinch.  Honestly regret it.  No real redeaming factor, no flavor, thick and doughy. Probably would be a serviceable based if you planned lots of toppings.   Won't be making again.

As per other reviews I doubled the sugar and vanilla. I threw everything in my blender to mix. Super easy and everyone enjoyed them!  My 1 year old ate 3 waffles in one sitting, as many as his 9-year-old brother.

Waffles in Australia are a rare treat so we want them to be delicious.  I use 2 oz real butter instead of oil and use 1/3 cup of sugar otherwise you’re making pancakes. & you’ll need less syrup etc. 
I use this recipe as it’s quick,  except use self raising flour as why add baking powder to plain flour.

Made this recipe several times and has become my go-to! Definitely use an electric mixer, especially for beating the eggs so the waffles come out super fluffy. We double the amount of sugar and use vanilla almond milk as well. It's delicious! This recipe yields about 14 waffles. Enjoy!

This is our go to Waffle recipe! we substitute 2Tb brown sugar for the white sugar, and add 1Tb cinnamon. TO DIE FOR. We always make a double batch and freeze the leftovers to make easy breakfasts before school. Zap for 30 seconds in the microwave and finish in the toaster

I used 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup corn flour and made adjustments in milk for consistency. It was very good. It was great for waffles with typical fixings and was excellent as a platform for a great chilly!

These waffles are our family’s go to recipe! I’ve even converted our teenagers from Eggos to throwing the batter ingredients into the Vitamix, giving it a buzz, then waffle ironing fresh toasty waffles on the weekend! So fluffy & good with any topping (banana & caramel, chocolate syrup, maple syrup, PB & syrup, etc). Make these if you haven’t already!

This is a great recipe.  Made  nice thick and fluffy waffles.  I also made this gluten free and used warmed almond milk.  I doubled the recipe and with my waffle  maker it made  6 waffles.  This is now my go to recipe for waffles.

Perfect recipe.  Replace quarter of a cup of flour with corn starch.  This will make it crispier.

Made exactly as stated. I beat the eggs until very airy. Great waffle to make quickly.  Not as good as the yeast raised waffles, but a close second and you don’t have to wait for a couple hours to rise. I undercooked some, separated with parchment paper and stuck in the freezer for an even quicker breakfast another day.

Very tasty and light.  May modify to make the waffles a little bit sweeter next time.

Edit: These freeze very well and are easy to pop in the toaster in the mornings. Still delicious!

The kids really liked these waffles. I followed the recipe but I doubled it and we got 20 waffles. Next time I'll have to triple so I can try freezing some.

Made it with no changes. It’s good just the way it is if you’re putting all these toppings on it. If you like a plain waffle with just butter then I would add something sweeter to the recipe itself

made recipe several times as is and is delicious every time. light, fluffy, not too sweet. i always make the batter the night before and make in the morning. also made these but subbed out half of the flour for wheat plus 2 tbs ground flax seed. Also delicious and healthier than all white flour. sometimes if we aren't going to eat them with syrup, I add 2 tbs of sugar instead of one.

The texture is great. Just very bitter/bland. I should've read the comments first. I would've  doubled the sugar and vanilla and possible tried the cinnamon for more flavor. My son said they had no flavor. I'm giving 3 stars for the recipe as is but would be perfect with more flavor.

It was a great recipe made as is BUT next time I will definitely double the vanilla & sugar as well as beating the egg whites until stiff & then folding them in at the last minute.

These are fantastic and my go-to recipe for waffles! I make my own adjustments for my family's  tastes and needs, as everyone does, and they're perfect every time! Adjustments I made were to substitute Splenda for sugar and double it, use half whole wheat flour and half AP, use half butter and half coconut oil, and a splash of maple extract and a dash of cinnamon. I did end up increasing the milk, due to ww flour requires more, but I just added until I got the right consistency. The eggs I just whipped, not separated, in my mixer until they were fluffy, then dumped everything else in at once. It's not brain surgery, no extra bowls, just dump it in and mix it up, then taste and adjust if necessary. My daughter LOVES these and she's picky (17yo that doesn't like sweets usually). If they're sticking to your griddle, you're not greasing it enough. Either use a spray, like Pam, or wipe with paper towel dabbed in oil.

Added cinnamon and since I didn't have baking powder I used baking soda since it's more acidic I used 1/4 tsp for every tsp it called for.

It needs more sugar, the waffles came out so plain, but the recipe was good I just consider adding more than 1 tablespoon.

I added crushed pecans after I poured the batter on my iron. Love a good pecan waffle! I also considered adding cinnamon to the batter in addition to the pecans for next time. That would be awesome!

I've tried lots of different recipes for waffles in the past, and hate how rigid they can be sometimes as I like to experiment with flavor. This recipe is really easy to work with and substitute things out of as necessary, which allows for that flexibility and experimentation! Delicious, flaky, and all around family favorites.

This is an EASY, FAST, and DELICIOUS waffle recipe. I will definitely use it again and again. Our teenage boys can pull the batter out and make their own waffles any time (as in when they roll out of bed at 11 AM on Saturday).

I've made this recipe a couple of times now. I generally make them to be frozen for my child to toast in the morning before school. 
My work was having an annual holiday brunch. I wanted to so something that harkens back to when we were kids.. So I made these to toast at work. 
I did make some changes. I added:
 1 Tbs brown sugar.
 2 Tbs soften butter 
1 tsp vanilla (doubled from the original)

I also cooked them for 3 min. the night before so they'd be a light - med golden brown. That way they'd darken more in the toaster

Needed a quick waffle recipe, this is definitely not it. I substituted melted butter for the oil and reduce it by half, nobody needs 1/2 a cup of any oil in any waffle recipe this size. Flavor ok and waffles look perfect, but will not make again,  extremely dense and difficult to cut with a fork. Tried different cooking times in the waffle iron, no difference in the texture. Adding another 1/4 cup of butter or oil to match the original recipe would only have made them worse.  Especially if you have guests, skip over this recipe and find something lighter, fluffier and more classic.  If you like experiments that you can feed to the raccoons later, make this one.

Light and fluffy, I love this waffle recipe. I add in some brown sugar and cinnamon. Although the batter can be saved, i usually end up making the whole batch then throwing leftover waffles in the toaster/toaster-oven for a quick weekday breakfast treat!

Previously, I had made only premixed waffles. Usually, between 3 kids and being tired it was a simple solution. Well, today it's just me, my hubby, and our youngest. So I wanted to make something different. Found this recipe and absolutely loved it. The only changes I made was I used vanilla and almond extracts  and added a bit of cinnamon. Left everything else  is. This is now my go-to when craving waffles.

Delish! I couldn’t cook them quick enough!  Kids devoured them! I used plain gluten free flour and almond milk. I added 2 quarter teaspoons of xanthan gum and had to add extra almond milk to make the mixture runnier.  I used around a tablespoon of mixture for each individual waffle in our press.
I will definitely use this recipe again...maybe even for pancakes ??

Fluffy and delicious! Added chocolate chips (of course) and made in an electric waffle press. Easy! I stored leftover mix in a Mason jar in the fridge.

I used a half cup of coconut oil they were delicious. Also I did not  spray my waffle maker because of the non stick coating. 

I think next time I will warm the coconut oil to make the mixture easier to mix. The contents were rather thick and I had to add milk sparingly above and beyond the 1,3/4 cups

I loved this recipe!  So light and yummy!  I didn’t follow the mixing directions, I just put everything except the flour in the bowl, mixed thoroughly, then added the flour. I also halved the recipe-it was perfect for two Belgian waffles.

I didn't make any changes to the main recipe this time around but next time I am going to use whole wheat flower and applesauce instead of oil. I added about one cup of frozen blueberries to the recipe as well. It was very delicious! This made 6 waffles with the waffle maker I have.

First time making waffles, so I'm not sure about what people are saying about fluffy inside and crispy outside. They seemed to be like that, but I have no comparisons to make. They were delicious, served with maple syrup and a side of bacon. I actually added bacon pcs. to one batch. Made a lot and I froze the rest. Will definitely make again.

The first time I made it, all we could taste was baking powder.  We had to throw them all away.  The second time I made it, I cut the baking powder in half.  It was bland but tolerable.  I definitely won't be using this recipe again.  I'm also frustrated because this is the first time I've had a major fail from a recipe so highly rated.

Pretty decent recipe when unmodified, but sometimes a little bit bland and soft. I've taken to replacing the milk with buttermilk, and substituting half the oil with melted butter. For me, it makes them a bit more flavorful and helps them crisp up after leaving the iron.

They were edible, but not what everyone was ranting and raving about. Honestly, they tasted bland and as if they lacked a certain ingredient. I’ve found better recipes on here for this.

In order to add protein, I used 3/4 cup soy flour in place of same amount of flour and added a scoop of vanilla protein powder. I cut the oil down to  1/4 cup and used 1 T of honey instead of sugar. These were very fluffy and delicious.

One of the simplest and best tasting waffle recipes I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot of them! Perfect every time. Ingredients easy to keep on hand, versatile  enough to add little things like sweetened condensed milk diluted, cinnamon powder, vanilla powder and excellent with one tablespoon of maple sugar added for more crispness and Carmel flavor.

These are excellent! The batter was a little thick so I added some extra dairy.

These waffles smelled good but had no flavor. My kids wouldn't eat them and I smothered them in syrup.

These waffles really are the very best , even better than the ones that call for yeast ( that are also delicious ) . I put my waffle iron on the darkest setting to give them a bit of a crunch and the inside remains fluffy & perfect . I made them exactly as stated & today I added apples and walnuts - they are so good they do not need butter or syrup .  Oh FYI - I also did not use all the batter last week & stored it in fridge as advised , came out just as fresh as the first day !

Tastes unpleasant. I was so excited to taste my waffles and they cooked beautifully but my taste buds were disappointed as i took a bite of them. 2/10  would not bake again.

I made this recipe with no substitutions, no add ons, exactly as the recipe said and it worked out beautifully. After the first time I made it I found that you can add chocolate chips to it and it adds that chocolate lovers kick to it. It works every time I've made it and I've made it about 50 times now. Make it and you'll love it.

Since I only wanted them for myself, just halved all the ingredient amounts and they turned out great! Only I substituted the vanilla extract with a bit of cinnamon powder and nutmeg, since we didn't have any.

Best fluffy waffle recipe I've found! Perfect color and most delicious! I just needed enough mix to make food for myself, so I moved the servings down to one egg (3 servings - but made about 1.5 waffles in my waffle maker). I also used vanilla almond milk, a mix of vanilla and almond extract, orange peel seasoning and chocolate chips. I can't wait to make this again.

I've made this recipe according to the exact instructions several times and it came out great. It's easy to alter it too. This morning's variation included buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil, cinnamon, and about half a cup of grated apple. Apple waffles were a hit!
Thanks for a great recipe that is easy to change up too!

Good recipe. I used soy milk and used the flaxseed egg substitute on Allrecipes and doubled the batch. Still very good. The waffles freeze well also.

Great little recipe that was easy to make with everyday ingredients. I didn’t have oil on hand so I used melted butter. They still turned out great.  Just lacks some deep flavor very easy to adjust to your liking.

My favorite waffle recipe!! I continue to come back to the recipe every time I want to make waffles.  I do end up adding in an extra tablespoon of sugar.  These waffles freeze well and taste great with fresh fruit or maple syrup.  They are extremely easy to make and impress everyone I make them for.

Loved this recipe. They were delicious and a nice alternative to frozen waffles. They even tasted healthier.

Great base recipe, but I gave it my own little twist. I made homemade buttermilk with skim milk and lemon juice and used 3 egg whites, as recommended previously. I also used coconut oil and added in vanilla and chia seed. They were amazing!

Horrible,  the most dry bland tasting recipe I have ever made.  Oh and did I mention DRY! Unless you like waffles swimming in syrup just so you can eat it, then this recipe is for you. Too much baking powder also. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.  Yuck! I'm going to find my original waffle recipe and stick to it.

eating these as we speak! i have made this recipe tons of times.. i have read other reviews and made them how they suggested,what i do is just double the sugar and vanilla and i'm set :) these will last in the fridge nearly a week, i have done it! lol i usually dispose of any leftover batter when it gets to discolored  and mixing it doesn't clear it up.  i would make a batch of these on sunday and eat them all week before work.  very quick breakfast.

Very good recipe. Found out I was out vegetable oil so I substituted some banana and 1/8 cup olive oil. I served with assorted berries (in my case I used blue berries), unsalted butter, and maple syrup.

Foolproof and easy waffle recipe. Not too sweet so it's easy to sweeten it a bit or to leave it as is and make it a savory waffle with other toppings.

I have made these more than a few times for my family now. There is nothing I would change in this recipe, they come out perfect every time. I do think, however, that the next time I make these I will add some blueberries, think that may take them one step further. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I liked this recipe, it was easy and they came out soft. My 7yr old daughter said it tasted like dough and only ate a bite. I don’t know what I could do differently to improve on it. She’s used to a box product.

This is my favorite recipe. The changes I made were to add extra vanilla, 1/4 cup white sugar, separated the eggs yolk and beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and folded into the batter.

I pretty much stuck with the recipe, with the exception of adding more vanilla extract, and honestly, these were so bland and not very exciting.  I think I'll go with another way of making waffles from now on.

To make these Gluten Free, I used Pilsbury Gluten Free flour, avocado oil, wipped egg whites , sugar free almond milk and agave.  So many air pockets in the waffles.

Great! Very light because of the step to whip the eggs.
I did mix wet and dry ingredients separately to reduce amount of stirring when combining everything together. I also increased the sugar as suggested by others because I like sweeter waffles.  I had to use a combo of soy/almond milk since my husband can't have lactose. Turned out great!

Really good and easy recipe. The only thing that I did was add a little more vanilla. Came out crisp and tender on my old waffle iron. So good I ordered a new one right after breakfast.

They were pretty bland, but otherwise good.  We separated the eggs, which I think was the right choice, but nect time we will add more flavour.

They were good. Feels like a lot of oil for this recipe, might cut back next time, but overall kids ate them, everybody happy!

The best waffles I've ever made!!! I always substitute oil for 1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter.  For a family of 5 I usually double the recipe.  My mom likes them very very well done, so hers cook for 5 or so minutes, all the others less than 4 minutes. These are  delicious, and totally worth making!!

Good basic recipe. 
I added a half cup of peanut powder (and about 1/4 cup extra milk to compensate)
Served with sliced banana and a big dollop of farmer's market apple butter

Great recipe, easy to halve for 2 people. I increase the milk by 25%, double the salt and add cinnamon to taste. Also helps to warm the milk just a bit.

This is a great fall back recipe for pecan waffles and/or chocolate chip waffles! The only reason it didn’t get ?????????? is because of personal preference, as a plain waffle... but add in a little cinnamon and pecans and it is absolutely delicious! (I like waffles I can set in the fridge for the kids to just snack on for a day or two) thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe and it was the worst waffle recipe I have ever made. When I first read the recipe I thought that 4 teaspoons of baking powder were too much. I should have known better. Maybe the recipe will work with just a teaspoon of baking powder or if you like bitter tasting waffles this is the recipe.

Best waffle mix my husband said he had ever made. Better than any store bought brand. Super fluffy, perfect taste, & easiest to mix/make. We will be using this recipe time & again. We also gave it to my family to use instead of store bought mix!

Really good basic recipe. Followed the recipe exactly the first time. If you’re short on time and just want a good quick recipe, follow this and it will turn out fine. Second time, as per other reviewers, I upped the sugar (1/4 C) and vanilla (2 tsp.) and added 1tsp. cinnamon. For the oil, I used 1/4 C.  vegetable oil and 1/4 C. melted butter so overall amount was the same. I also beat the egg whites first and folded them in at the end. Waffles went from good to great.  Giving 5 stars because the proportions are spot on, the waffles are perfect and the recipe is very adjustable.

now i did not have vanilla extract to do the recipe to the tee BUT i do  suggest  either just completely replacing the oil with butter (wont be as crunchy) for the sake of  flavor. it was extremely bland but if you have butter flavored syrup then don't worry about it

Loved it once I made changes!  I went with 3/4 ratio unsweetened apple sauce to oil, makes it really moist and a lot healthier and less calories.  I added the 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp of brown sugar suggested in reviews, and I doubled the vanilla

Pretty easy to make. If you wanted to add something else like peanut butter or cinnamon, it'll give you a nice twist and protein boost. Doesn't fall apart and is really nice to eat on the weekends.

My go to waffle recipe every time. Sometimes I substitute some of the flour for Almond meal and replace the oil with applesauce.  If using apple sauce I leave out the sugar.

I think the basic recipie is good (4 stars). With modifications i will call it a 4.5. We're biased though: buttermilk waffles are the only ones that can score a 5. These are a great alternative when we run out.

Mods:
1 whole wheat flour to 3 a/p flour
1/2 Tbsp (=1.5 tsp) artificial vanilla extract
brown sugar instead of white sugar
decreased butter from 1c (for double batch) to 3/4 c
3/4 tsp salt (for double batch) from 1/2 tsp

These waffles were straight up LIT!! Tasted as wonderfully sweet as my mom. Made them in D&D and my group loved them while we fought trolls with a burning passion. Speaking of burning passion... my kitchen is on fire!! Help. Plz.

This has to be the best waffle base I have ever used.  I did add 2 TLB of brown sugar and upped the vanilla extract to 1 tsp.  Add your favorite toppings to this recipe and you will not be disappointed.

I used half whole wheat flour. 1/4cup oil. Seems bland and you can taste the baking powder.  Think I will try a little more sugar and little less baking powder.  
Very light and fluffy texture

Excellent with these changes: Preheat waffle iron. Beat eggs in large bowl with hand beater until fluffy. Mix eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 3/4 cups mock buttermilk (google recipe for "mock buttermilk") with 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup peanut oil. In separate bowl, mix flour,  2 Tbsp sugar,  baking powder, salt and 1/2  tsp cinnamon. Mix well. Mix wet ingredients with dry ingredients and whisk until just combined (a few small lumps of flour is fine). ENJOY!

These are delicious and SO easy to make. I only had powdered sugar and ran out of vanilla extract, but substituted maple syrup and they turned out wonderful. Much better than the box stuff. Will be making again soon.

This is my very first recipe I made from this website . I love the way the waffles came out very fluffy & amazing. The only bad thing I have to say is you should have put that you need to measure out 1/4 to make one. But other than that way to go.

Really good go to waffle recipe. Light, fluffy, and crispy. Like other reviews, you can separate the egg whites and peak them and add at the end, but they're still good if you don't. Also, I add some cocoa powder to mine when I feel like a hint of chocolate flavor, which is most of the time because everything is better with chocolate.

To be succinct: very easy to make, not very healthy, pretty bland/boring. If you want something super quick yes... if you want a thrilling waffle nope

I followed this recipe, but the waffles tasted almost bitter. I practically had to drown them in syrup to make them half edible. This recipe is not for me.

Waaaay too much baking soda!  Kids wouldn’t eat them because they were too “sour,” and I agree.  These are not kids who have ever turned down waffles before. Use 2 tsp, 3 max, not 4.

This is by far the best waffle recipie I've tried.   The waffles come out with a "restaurant taste" every time.  My husband, who is super picky, loves them.  Enough said :-)

Excellent the way it is.  I have tweeked it for myself now though and I separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites, used 2 T white sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  It took about 2/3 cup of batter for each waffle in my waffle maker.

I made these vegan by using Ener-G Egg Replacer and Plain Unsweetened Soy Milk . Solid basic recipe. I think I would up the sugar and vanilla a bit but otherwise they cooked up just nicely. Will definitely use again as a base recipe.

I tried a few waffle recipes that were lacking. I figured I’d try this one. It is so simple & easy and much better than the recipes with yeast! Recipe comes together quickly and is now my go-to waffle recipe! I’ve had great success using half almond meal half flour. Creates a lighter, crispier waffle. I also sub unsweetened almond milk for the milk and it’s been perfect!

I made this recipe as is. Perfect. I have made waffles many times but always had to tweak the original recipe. This one is bang on. 
Making it in Mumbai India is a challenge. Ingredients are different. Weather is so so humid now. But simply loved this recipe. It’s a keeper.

I use this recipe for pancakes for past few years. 
For pancakes, I just add little bit more flour to have thicker batter.
Other option is to make it with less flour and put it in a bottle and in fridge. Then you have it for the whole week, whenever pancakes are needed. Batter will be little darker after few days in the fridge, but it is not spoiled and it is safe to make pancakes or waffles.

It was my first time making waffles and this recipe was not only easy but I don’t think anyone can mess it up.  Since I feed it to my kids I used whole wheat flour instead.  I served it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and drizzle of pure maple syrup.They loved it and kept wanting more.

Wonderful recipe for waffles.  We got about 8 waffles out of this mixture.  We froze a couple and had them on a different morning.  Just popped them in the toaster to crisp/freshen up.  So easy.

These turned out fantastic! I subbed buttermilk for regular milk but they came our crispy and fluffy and were delicious.

I wasn't really a fan. I didn't really enjoy the flavor. I wouldn't call it disgusting or anything, as it can make for a decent starting place; however, I've tried other recipes in which the flavor of the pancake/waffle was great on its own. For this one, I needed butter and syrup to actually like it. I'd probably add more sugar if I were to use this again in future.

Tastes a little like pancakes, in a waffle form.   When you add  toppings  its pretty good.  Don't put to much batter in the maker unless you want it to overflow.  The recipe could have more details but in the end it was good.

Love this recipe, we use it all the time! The only thing I change is instead of a 1/2 cup of oil, we often use a 1/2 cup melted butter because it's waffles and we aren't trying to be healthy and it tastes sooooo good :P

I loved this recipe! The waffles turn out fluffy and great tasting, not like the store bought kind that is as hard as a brick wall! If you want your family to love breakfast and to serve up something other than the regular fare, cook this! Goes great with fresh squeezed orange juice too.

I used same ingredients but two tablespoons sugar instead of one and added chopped pecans- I beat the whites and folded them in as others have suggested.  If you like light crispy waffles these came out perfectly- so I gave them five stars.  We like ours more dense, however, so next time I won't beat the whites, and see if they feel more hearty.  If not, I'll try some other recipes- but if you're looking for light, crispy, these are for you!

Wonderful recipe. Also, as it goes, followed the recommendations from others. Did most of the recipe using a stick blender actually, starting with the egg whites, then mixing in the yolks on low, doubling the white sugar, and adding in brown sugar, and some cinnamon. I also substituted the vegetable oil (because ours has quite a distinct, and not very nice flavour) with olivio margerine. They turned out fantastic.

These classic waffles are super easy to make and have the perfect consistency!  Next time, I will likely add a couple tablespoons of melted Kerrygold butter to the recipe, only making them more delicious.  I tossed the eggs in my VitaMix to fluff them up and then piled the other ingredients in one-by-one.  They came out perfect and super fluffy!  #wafflesnob

Great simple recipe. I modified slightly to add 1 more tbsp of sugar (as with just one the dough seemed bland). Also, whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in at the the end like one other reviewer suggested. Turned out perfect! So soft and fluffy on the inside and not too sweet.

These are your average waffles. If you want to duplicate your standard grocery store's frozen boxed waffles, this is your recipe.

They were pretty dense, but on a bright note, they cooked perfectly.

If you like light, fluffy, airy waffles then look elsewhere.

Do NOT use four teaspoons of baking powder. Even mixed well, the waffles have a bad taste to them because of this. I used as little as one teaspoon and they turned out beautifully! A good recipe, that was the only issue I found.

Received a waffle iron for Christmas, so pick this recipe to give it a try.  I made two changes:  (1) used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (we don't use veggie oil), and (2) used 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of one (I'm a sugar junkie).  The waffles turned out *perfect*...  nice and crisp and full of flavor!  Next time I might try some blueberries or other fruit, or maybe some spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), but this was a great start.  Thanks for sharing!    UPDATE:  I added about 1/2 cup of blueberries this time and it was *really* yummy!

I liked this recipe because of the texture but I did find it pretty bland.  I made one as a tester and then added another 3 tblsp of sugar and another 1/2 tsp salt and that did the trick.  I’ll definitely be making these again, great for a nice quick waffle recipe.

I made this with homemade strawberry sauce. It turned out good, but was very crispy.

I too added more sugar but on the second batch. The first batch was really good. I followed the recipe to the T, other than not spraying my waffle maker before adding the batter and they were fine. I added milk chocolate chips to mine and we didn't add syrup. Delicious!!

The basic recipe is good with the exception of the oil. A half cup is way too much. Ours turned out light but you could squeeze the oil out of them. Reduce to a 1/4cup or even less.

Hubby just said this should be a regular!  I read other reviews and did whip the egg whites separately, then mixed my egg yolks and liquids together, then added dry ingredients and folded in the egg whites at the end.
Read somewhere to add 1 T cornstarch to have a crispy outside and tender fluffy inside. And someone mentioned they were a bit bland - so increased the sugar to 2 tablespoons! So added these to the dry ingredients!  Served with homemade berry sauce and whipped cream!

Fantastic recipe, with a few key changes.  I use whole wheat flour (so I can pretend my waffles are healthy!) about twice as much vanilla extract, and then I add a healthy bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.

I whipped the eggs first and then added all the liquids and whipped it some more. The flour mixture and whipped again. They were fluffy and slightly crunchy he edges! I made it with apple sauce instead of oil. Next time half will be whole wheat flour and I will try cutting sugar in half with brown sugar. This usually leads to all the flavor  and sweetness but without so many calories. Double the recipe if you want any batter left with two kids and a hungry husband....

I  like to make recipes exactly as written once, before I decide to modify. I thought the batter was very thick and made a very dense waffle which was a little heavy for my taste. We thinned it with some more milk and it was perfect. I did take the idea in the comments to blend the egg whites to soft peaks separately then fold it into the batter. The thinned out batter produced a light fluffy waffle with an "eggy" taste, which we loved.

Trick my daughter taught me, never stack your waffles as you make them.  To keep them crisp until you serve them, lay out on a cookie sheet and keep warm in the oven.

These were great!  Turned out crispy on outside, tender in the middle.  I used white flour, but next time will use half whole wheat pastry flour & white.  Using olive oil instead of butter, as I've done before, made them crispier I believe.  Made another batch with soy milk for family with milk allergy & they turned out great he said.

BIG hit with my 3 grandsons whose gold standard was previously "waffles in the yellow box."   Not highly adventurous, but they all declared Grammy's waffles the best they have ever had!   I made two batches.  The first was exactly according to the recipe.  The second I added 1/3 C chocolate chips.  Very easy and yummy.

Light and fluffy waffles -like angel's wings IF you follow these CHANGES: 
* use XL eggs
* use warm whole milk
*seperate the eggs, beat the egg whites until stiff, and set aside. 
* Sift the dry ingredients, combine with the sugar,  egg yolk, milk, & oil until just slightly lumpy 
(overstirring causes tough waffles) and then fold all into the beaten egg whites. 

Makes approx.  (7), 8" x 4.5" double square waffles,  3 1/8oz. each.

-To get the best crispy waffles, make sure your waffle iron comes up to proper temperature again after each batch before starting the next one. Enjoy.

These were the best Waffles I have ever made.  They were so soft and fluffy.  They were not that sweet but perfect when you added syrup and whip.  I am actually thinking of making strawberry shortcake with these waffles.

My granddaughter is on Thanksgiving break this week and as soon as Mama dropped her off, she asked Nana for waffles for breakfast. I lost my old recipe and have been looking for another one, and I think I may have found my new recipe! I made these with a few changes.  We like our waffles sweet, and I use Splenda instead of sugar, so I increased it to 1/3 cup and the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. I used melted butter instead of oil - makes all the difference in the world! I used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose, salt, and baking powder (4 teaspoons sounds like waaaaay too much to me!) I mixed these in my blender, starting with whipping up the eggs, then adding the other wet ingredients, then the dry. My granddaughter loved them - I heard a lot of MMMMmmmm's while she was enjoying her waffle!

I didn't have milk, so I used non-fat Chobani Greek yogurt that I thinned out with water in its place. As prepared, this recipe didn't have enough sweetness for my taste. After tasting the first batch I added a layer of turbinado sugar over the batter prior to closing the waffle iron. This addition made the waffles delicious!  They are light and airy, perfectly crispy, yet creamy on the inside. They also freeze well and toast up beautifully from their frozen state, perhaps even better than the day they were made (I think because it adds more caramelization to the  turbinado sugar). Make these waffles, you won't regret it!  Next time I'm going to try coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

Took overnite to rise; but when it did, rose to double. 

Did not make gd waffles, probably our waffle maker. But makes excellent pancakes. 

Definitely the new pancake mix for the family. Thanx for the recipe.

Sorry only a 3  for waffles but a 5* for pancakes!

I have been using this recipe for quite a while now and this is the 1st time I have reviewed it.  This is the beat recipe and the o lyrics one I use.  You can make it ahead of time and refrigerate for the next day (just give it a whip before using).  It's great with syrup, fruit coulis,  fresh fruit & whipped cream and even  chocolate dipped. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. This one is in my recipe book now ;)

very good recipe, makes light and fluffy waffles (wife does not like crunchy ones).  The only reason it did not get a higher rating is the moisture/dry ingredients is way off.  I had to add close to double the moisture to get it to the proper consistency.

This was my first time making waffles and it was not easy at all. I only sort of nailed the 3rd one. It doesn't say hoy much mix to put on the waffle maker and how much time it should be there. Plus the taste isn't the best.

Absolutely delicious.  We are a cinnamon loving family, so the only thing I did differently was to shake a bunch of cinnamon into the batter.  They cooked up perfectly and are fantastic!

These waffles were BAM! Crunchy on the outside, yet soft and steamy on the inside...and so easy to make! This is now my go-to recipe for waffles.

This recipe was fine on it's own and if you wish to follow as is, you'll yield good waffles.
My daughter makes a double recipe of waffles regularly for our family of six to enjoy throughout the week. We use his recipe as a jumping point and mostly double everything. But we use half whole wheat, just half a cup oil, four beaten egg whites (no yolks), two tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup white sugar.  It yields a hearty yet light waffle with less fat. We freeze and reheat in the toaster, often making cream cheese and jelly waffle sandwiches for school lunches during the week.
My review (stars) is for the original recipe because I dislike when people rate their own version. That's not a rating of the recipe at all. So, as is, 4 stars and a perfectly fine, though slightly bland waffle. I give it 5 stars with our alterations, keeping in mind we like whole wheat baked goods and crisp waffles.

10/10 for texture and fluffiness. Perfect!

7/10 for taste. They were a bit bland. I'm going to try making them again with buttermilk next time.  Or maybe some cinnamon.

It's okay. It's a decent waffle recipe, but don't expect anything spectacular out of it. It's not as terrible as the 1-star reviews, but it's also not as great as the 5-star reviews. I followed the recipe the first time, but didn't like the oily taste, and from then on substituted applesauce for the cooking oil. I don't think it makes much of a difference. The mix is also very liquidy, and that makes it difficult to judge how fast you're pouring it onto your waffle iron. It's a decent recipe if you're looking for a no-frills waffle recipe, but don't expect anything too great.

Made great waffle s. I added a little cinnamon to the mix because that sounded good to me, then I topped with cinnamon apples instead of syrup. Delicious and the leftovers also freeze well to make toaster waffles.

Love this. Super easy and had a lot of kefir/homemade yogurt to get rid of, so substituted that for the milk without a problem. 1:1 substitution. I did add a tsp baking soda as I've read the acidity of buttermilk or yogurt needs the baking soda for some reason or other. Also used half whole wheat flour to make me feel a tad healthier.  Turned out great and perfect to freeze for those busy mornings trying to get the kids off to school! Many thanks.

I don't know what the people on here are talking about. Maybe they knew how to "doctor up" this recipe, but bland isn't the word. Completely tasteless is more like it even after adding butter, extra sugar, and vanilla as other reviewers suggested. I was literally eating solid calories in waffle form. I'm sorry but NO.

Made this with a few changes- brown sugar for white, a heaping shake of cinnamon, and half while wheat. However, I halved it and forgot to halve the the oil.  It didn't make a huge difference I think, they were good.

Very good basic waffle recipe. Reviews state it is a little bland, that is because the salt needs to be doubled from what is called for in the recipe. Applesauce can be substituted for half the oil as well.

I made this recipe exactly as written and they were the best waffles I've ever made.  Light and fluffy!  I may cut down on the oil next time since my lips taste buttery.

*Revised, 1/24: I have made these several times since my first review and I've made the following revisions to make it dairy free and slightly healthier...they are waffles, so already a splurge. Substitutions:
scant 1/4 c sunflower oil instead of 1/2c oil
1 tsp vanilla instead of 1/2t 
1 tsp REAL maple syrup & omit cane sugar
Used the same amount of Almond Milk vs dairy milk

We could not taste the difference! Beating the eggs and the baking powder really make these v light and fluffy.  If I put them in a batter dispenser to use throughout the week, I have to add it gradually as the batter rises as it sits.  It also separates a lot during the week so we've found we prefer to make them all at once and reheat.

This is a great recipe and I will use it for my new waffle maker from now on. I don't like to add a lot of syrup to my waffles so I added an extra tablespoon of sugar to the batter to make it a little sweeter.

These were not good. I used whole wheat flour and adjusted the recipe according to other reviews (more sugar, more vanilla, less oil) and they were bland and soggy. I even toasted them in a toaster oven after cooking and they still did not get crispy. I was surprised considering how many five star reviews this recipe got.

Made these for guests and their comments were very positive. Said they were much better than purchased at the store. Easy to mix. I make these ahead and freeze them to pop in the toaster for breakfast.

uh all I can say is that the batter tasted like flower and eggs. It was very plain, I could barely finish eating one. Not even adding syrup or nutella helped with flavour.

Flavor was good, but I did do as other reviewers suggested and doubled the vanilla and added a bit more sugar (an extra teaspoon). Only complaint I have is the waffles came out soggy! Anyone else have this problem and, if so, what did others do to remedy it? I read somewhere that mixing cornstarch with flour prevents this. Anyone have proof of that as well? Thanks!

I followed the receipt but my waffles came out very tangy and bitter. I google and find out the it causes by using baking soda or baking powder. Does anyone know how to stop it?

I doubled the recipe but omitted a half cup of milk to keep the batter a good consistency.   Would probably taste better if I had used butter or coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  The kids liked them and we took them to the pool and they're still snacking on them.

These waffles turned our way too dense, like lead though maybe because I used 2 packed cups of flour there was too much flour. So after I was displeased with the first four waffles, I added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup more oil and another tablespoon of sugar  to the second batch which turned out  moister, lighter and fluffier. Recipe made 10 waffles with a four-waffle waffle iron.  Next time I will add 3/4 cup water and more oil to try and get crispier, less doughy waffles.  Or I will just buy Aunt Jemima Waffle Mix which is best one on the market--better than these waffles!

We enjoyed these.  I halved the recipe for 1 waffle each.   I used almond milk and olive oil because that's all I had and they were great.   Topped with strawberries, bananas, sprinkled icing sugar and whipped cream.

I ate them, but I wouldn't recommend making them. They don't get crispy and they have virtually no flavor, and that's after adding extra sugar, vanilla and some cinnamon. It's pretty disappointing. Seems like a lot of baking powder, too. Definitely would not try again. Might even throw away the remaining waffles...

Never have I encountered a horrific, unhonorable, and dissatisfying piece of false advertisement as this. I followed your recipe. I even watched your video. I gazed in amazement as those luxurious l, beautiful mouth watering golden brown waffles appeared out of your waffle maker. And yet, little to my knowledge you were being deceitful. You must've used another recipe. That is my only explanation for what happened next. I added my ingredients one by one, as your trusting and elegant voice had led me to believe was the correct way to do so. I poured the batter in "just enough to fill [the waffle maker] as you led me to believe. And once the green light went off, I gained a new sense of hope. See now for some time I have lost my hope, drowning in the work brought on by my studies. Yet you had inspired me. I stumbled upon your waffle recipe while looking up research for a critical essay, and it inspired me. But that inspiration and hope would soon die, as I lifted to waffle maker open only to gaze upon the most hideous sight I've ever seen. A burnt waffle on the outside, and yet somehow extremely raw on the inner side. My heart dropped. See I have never found love, but this was the closest I've ever come to it. And it was taken away from me in seconds. There wasn't even a sense of waffle in the taste. Just the sense of realization that there is nothing to look forward to in this life. What is there in life if you can't even make a waffle. What is there, I dare you answer that qu

Makes 10 large waffles. Use half cup to fill each waffle, but don''t fill to top.  Is awesome with blueberries and whipped cream!

I haven't actually made these yet, but the recipe looks great!  I am writing because when I sent it to print,  the quantities for  the ingredients came out in grams and milligrams and not the actual measuring amounts.  I thought someone should be aware of this and get it corrected.  I crossed out the printed amounts and wrote in the actual measurements.  Thanks!

Stars all over!! Very soft with light crunch! I did whip the egg whites separately and added it last into the batter. This will be my permanent waffle recipe??

The recipe itself is good. I recommend reducing the amount of baking soda. I think that 4 teaspoons is too much. To compare, in cakes there is about 1-2 teaspoons. All in all, it came out okay, but it had a terrible first and after taste... something I'm sure Nutella could fix!

Made the recipe 3 days in a row, when I ran out of my regular waffle mix! Followed the recipe to a T the first day, then added a little more vanilla the other times. Very good recipe!

This was a great recipe! I had buttermilk so I used it instead. Then the batter was too thick, so I added milk till it was the right consistency. Amazing!! Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic! Easy to make and came out perfectly golden brown in the waffle iron. I added chocolate chips and let them cook for about 30 extra seconds and they were delicious.

If you are expecting hearty, cakey waffles with substantial flavor, these are NOT for you. Light and bland. If you like that, it's fine. They are nicely crispy, though.

This recipe is fantastic. The only change I would recommend is mixing the dry ingredients separately and then lightly incorporating them into the wet ingredients. This will prevent overmixing and make your waffle fluffier.

These are delicious! I substitute melted butter for the oil. They always turn out perfect.  Add a little crumbled bacon when you put the batter in the waffle pan.

If you have any problems with this recipe like I did, let me assure you that it's your waffle maker. Mine were terrible, almost achewy texture.  The waffle maker was the problem. New maker, new crisp waffles. Thank you!

This is our favorite waffle recipe! Since trying it the first time we had to go wheat free and light dairy. So We've also made it with gluten free flour (pilsbury) and almond milk and they are still our favorite. We make these regularly now wheat free and substitute almond milk. We also add 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla per reader comments.

Made the recipe exactly as it says. These came out absolutely perfect! Just like the waffles my mom used to make when I was a kid! My 3 year old and I were gobbling them up! This will replace my old waffle recipe as the new staple in our house!

I'm sad to rate this recipe so low considering it's the top rated waffle recipe on Allrecipes. I've made this recipe twice with no changes and both times the batter came out very thick (I couldn't pour it, I had to scoop it from the bowl) and rather bland. I much prefer the Classic Waffles recipe which has a thinner, more pourable batter, and a slightly sweet flavor.

The waffles were nice and fluffy. However the flavors wasn't what I was expecting, there was too much baking powder in this recipe and made them taste rather bland.

Please adjust the instructions for making these. The instructions call to mix until smooth. I know better, but I followed the instructions. So I ended up with heavy flat dense over stirred pancakes.

Best waffle mix! I made some adjustments but it was really good. Definitely a great alternative to the box mix.

Super tasty! AMAZING with just some butter. Tastes so much better made from scratch as opposed to a box. Highly recommend.

Amazing recipe that can be easily altered to meet your likes. Added brown sugar instead of white, a little cinnamon and extra vanilla. Finally using my waffle iron.

I followed to a t and it was great, but a bit bland. Next time I will add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. DO NOT DOUBLE RECIPE unless you're feeding a family of 12 or want frozen waffles for a month lol. My kids are done and gone playing and I'm still cooking!

Very good and super fluffy..I did make some changes that others had suggested like separating the whites of the eggs and beating them in last. I also used 2tbsp of brown sugar and added in some cinnamon. I doubled the recipe and froze the leftovers for my son to heat and eat before school.

I used powdered buttermilk in the dry mix and just added the right amount of water into the wet. Light, crispy and delicious! And so easy too! no separating eggs and whipping egg whites. Just mix the eggs with a hand mixer and add the other ingredients.

Very easy and tasty! First time I did it with all purpose flour, second time did it with whole wheat flour. Every time is a success!! 
Today  I decided to do it again but I did not have any milk, so I substituted it with buttermilk, the batter turned out thicker so I added water and was afraid to use the waffle pan after all these modifications  so I just cooked them as pancakes. Again, delicious! 
So, this recipie is now our favorite family treat: as waffles or pancake!
Thank you!

My favorite two things about this recipe: first, it taste good. Second, you can keep the leftover batter in the fridge for up to a week. Very important in my quest to avoid wasting food.

I added a bit more milk because the batter was a bit thicker than we like once it sat awhile. Other than that, no changes were needed. Even my pickiest eater loved them!

This is the most delicious of the simple recipes I have used.  After trying SEVERAL waffle recipes, this one takes the least time and is pretty adaptable.  
I use 1/2 white flour, and 1/2 sprouted wheat flour, and I also sub Coconut oil and it adds nutrition without taking away from the fluffiness or flavor.

Great and easy waffle recipe! I used to make Belgian waffles all the time for my kids, but now they're all teenagers and with how quick they gobble everything down without even tasting it. I'll save the Belgian and Liege waffles for special occasions...The taste is great. The outside is crispy, and the inside is tender... I have tried other basic waffle recipes, but the best thing about this one is the consistency of the batter. It is a bit thinner, and makes pouring it onto the iron a breeze. Some of the other batters that are even just a bit thicker are a pain to spread out and sometimes require the use a rubber spatula to move it around a bit, and by that time the top of the iron has cooled off.  Sometimes it's those little things that count the most when making breakfast for 6.

I followed the recipe exactly. I followed my waffle iron instructions exactly. The result was eggy, heavy, flat-ish waffles. My new iron is ceramic. My old, tried and true recipe didn't work well with this new iron either.  I would love input.

Love this recipe! Have been making it for years but today I was short 1/4 cup of flour and it was an amazing mishap! It make the waffles really light but still crispy. Definitely going to do that in the future. A great option for those who don't like it too dense.

I have to admit, my family and I are Krusteaz fans. I promised my son and his friends waffles this morning (sleepover) and when I went to reach for the Krusteaz, it was gone. My husband made a batch the day before and there was only enough leftover batter to make two waffles. I quickly Googled a recipe and this one was the first to pop up. With such a high rating I figured it was a safe bet. 

The only alteration I made to the recipe was in using skim milk (it's all I have in the house); other than that, I followed it to the letter. I like a crispy waffle, inside and out, and the Krusteaz are always a little soft inside. These waffles, however, were perfectly crispy inside and out. On the flavor side, however, I found them to be pretty bland. I added extra vanilla and sugar, and also added cinnamon before making a second round of waffles and the taste was better, but I still didn't LOVE them. The predominant flavor was that of flour.

I used up the rest of the Krusteaz batter to do a taste test. My son, his friends and I were all in agreement, the Krusteaz was better due to flavor.  The boys also liked that the Krusteaz was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. And you know what? After comparing a waffle that is through and through crispy to one that is only crispy on the outside, I have changed my mind.  I preferred the crispness of the Krusteaz too. The boys did make one observation in favor of the homemade waffles. They all agreed that the homemade waffl

Our family loves this recipe.  We make it as written but we use melted butter instead of veg oil. ( I rarely have veg oil!)  Today I noticed the recipe turned out thick so I added more milk.   Makes delicious waffles and it's quick and easy.

I did add some chocolate chips one time and cinnamon another time, but you could make this anyway you want! I love this recipie and I will keep using it many more times. Also, I would recommend whisking it in a KitchenAid mixer and baking in a Belgian waffle maker. I use the Cuisinart Belgian waffle maker and KitchenAid mixer and these waffles turn out great every time!

I was little worried in the beginning because the batter was a little runny. But once i cooked them, they turned out AMAZING! I totally recommend this. If your using pure vanilla, only use half of what it said too, they turned out a little strong, but they were still amazing. TOTALLY making these again!

I made this recipe with a few alterations, and it was pretty good.  First of all, I halved most of the ingredients (except the sugar and vanilla) and then I used a gluten-free all purpose flour instead.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil, and though it was kind of doughy on the inside, the outside was pretty crisp.  Definitely toddler-approved.  I will make again!

Sundays are our  time for a nice scrumptious breakfast so I try out a lot of different pancake, waffle recipes.  On top of that, my two boys are very picky.    My eldest 17 year old, once finished his first waffle from this recipe exclaimed  " mom you have to go back and rate this recipe...this is the best ever!" So for me that says it all.  I don't normally rate or comment but this really is an easy straight forward recipe that tastes delicious. Light and fluffy and if you want it crispier just leave it in the iron longer.   Another nice change is adding in a bit of cinnamon if you have cinnamon lovers in the house.   Enjoy!  :)

These waffles taste like baking soda and oil. They bake up soft and not crispy. Had to drown them in butter and syrup to make them edible. I am never making this recipe again.

Nice, easy recipe. This was my first time doing this from scratch instead of out of a box, this will be my go-to from now on.  I subbed almond milk in place of dairy, and cinnamon-sugar in place of plain sugar for a nice subtle flavor.  Next time, though, I will may use 2 tablespoons of cinnamon-sugar for better flavor, since it wasn't very sweet with this blend at 1 tbsp.

I tried at least 10 homemade waffle recipes and some very complicated one (thinking ''it's complicated, it must be good!'') but this one is PERFECT and so EASY and FAST to do with the perfect taste and consistency. I have finally find THE recipe so no need to look for a better one anymore. Yeah!

Great recipe! 
I doubled the sugar this time and the waffles still could've used more. 
I might try cocoa powder next time for a depth of flavour.

Believe it or not, in all of my 40 years I have never made waffles. Probably because I never owned a waffle maker. I'm not sure why, just didn't LOL. So I got one as a gift and my kids were having a snow day, and I realized we were out of their favorite breakfast in the freezer, and going to the store was a no go. I googled how to make waffles and found this recipe. I love it because I always have all of the things in the ingredients list. Most recipes I came across call for buttermilk, which I never just keep on hand because I don't use it that much. This is a simple, and wonderful recipe. Very yummy waffles. They come out perfect and my kids just loved them.

These waffles are very good! I have made them multiple times and not once have I ever thought about using another recipe. It may not be the worlds healthiest waffles, but if I make waffles I'm not looking for healthy! Although it could easily be turned into a healthy recipe if you wish.. My family LOVES them.

This is one of the best waffle recipes I've made. I didn't make any changes except I skipped the salt.  I also use a old school cast iron stovetop waffle iron. It's a lot easier to clean and I don't have to worry about it going out.

This  been a favorite of my children for years. Even now when they visit as adults, they always ask for these for breakfast. I did change the amount of vanilla- I double it and they taste almost like cake.

I did it today as the recipe says except I omitted the sugar because I wanted to have a savoury meal. I also rested the dough for about 3 hours. It was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I would definitely use this recipe again. Thank you :)

This recipe is a keeper! Makes lots of good waffles. I don't have an expensive waffle maker, a little round Oster, but I'm getting great crispy outside, soft inside light waffles. Great with fried chicken or pecan syrup! Husband enjoys them and he is picky about waffles for sure! I did add a little more vanilla and sugar, but that's just my taste! Had some batter left over next morning and made a single waffle for a walk out the door breakfast!

I couldn't eat these waffles because the recipe called for 1/2 of a cup of vegetable oil, which I was stupid enough to follow. After making adjustments to the second batch and adding only about 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, the recipe was fine and I was finally able to feed the kids.

You can't beat two eggs and then add two cups of flour directly afterwards. You'll end up with a congealed mess that won't mix properly into batter. Do wet and dry separately, mix well in each, then combine.

Also, another reviewer was right, these are bland. What they need is more salt, not more sugar.

I took the advice of others and doubled the sugar and vanilla and beat the egg whites, folding them in at the end. I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. They were delicious and I put the rest in the freezer. This seems like a good recipe to flavor to your taste.

These were nice and light, but spongier than I like even when cooked on a high temp setting. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making these. I would have preferred more flavor so next time I will add another spoonful of sugar and vanilla

Been using this recipe for several years for our Christmas brunch.  It's a family favorite. I make it the nite before and put out next to waffle maker, and everyone makes their own.
Any leftovers I cook them up and freeze them, then heat or lightly toast in toaster oven, and almost like they just came out of waffle press!

I made this for my parents and siblings, and they said it was better than a pancake/waffle mix that you could buy from the store. This was a really amazing recipe, and I am amazed about how good they were.

15/10 

I'd make it again.

Just made this in my new waffle maker. It was my first time making waffles. So amazingly delicious!  I made a few plain,  a few with chopped pecans,  and a few with chocolate chips and about a tsp of cocoa powder. Everyone loved them. I also doubled the batter and used half melted butter and half oil instead of all oil, and tripled the vanilla.

I love this recipe! It's wonderful just as it is. It's a very simple recipe to whip up. The only thing I did different, is add some chocolate chips to them, because my son really wanted them in his waffles. He loved them! I gave them to my 2 year old without adding syrup to it & she loved them! No syrup is needed when you include chocolate chips. However, I do agree with what many others are saying about it in terms of flavor. It is quite bland if you are not planning on using syrup & if you haven't included chocolate chips to the recipe. I do find it needs that extra bit of sweetness, but I think most people like eating waffles with syrup anyhow. If you prefer to not use syrup, then you may want to take some of the suggestions other users have given. There are many different options to spice up the flavor.  I'm planning on adding a bit of cinnamon & nutmeg next time I make them. I will also increase the amount of sugar & vanilla I put in.  

Overall, this is a fantastic recipe worthy of a 5 start rating! Even with the small modifications that you make to it, I still give credit to the allrecipes member who submitted this recipe. I plan on using this recipe over & over again! 

Thank you for sharing this great recipe! ??

This is my go-to waffle recipe.  Never fails, very simple.  Sometimes I add a few chocolate chips to the mixture and serve with some  Bonne Maman raspberry jam on the side instead of syrup.  Delish!

Something amazing just happened!!! I was out of  milk so I threw in 2/3 can of full fat coconut milk and heaping tablespoon of ricotta cheese. Hands down the best waffle I've ever had. My roommate and I were moaning the whole time we were eating them. Bc of how moist they are you have to make sure they  are well done but omg please try it.

I am one that typically follows the directions to letter. However, after reading several reviews, I did double the salt and added some cinnamon (didn't measure).  I fed them to my two sons and my husband.  Mixed reviews. My husband did say it "tastes like a waffle".  That is probably as close to a compliment as I will get.  I thought it was a bit bland but I am not sure how to fix that.

The only change I made was to halve the recipe so I wouldn't make as many. They weren't fluffy like I expected, not at all sweet and they wouldn't get crispy. Don't like this recipe.

Delicious!  We added bubbly water in place of some of the milk which made them lighter.  Everyone ate them up on Thanksgiving morning!

3 stars for the taste ! these were so bland. I made them the 1st time following the  exact recipe and we had to smother the waffles with  all kind of sweet toppings to give them some taste.
The 2nd time, I tripled the salt and the sugar and doubled the vanilla. NOW, they deserve 5 stars !
When making waffles, I always turn the oven on, to 250 and put in a cookie sheet topped with a cooling rack. And as I am making the waffles, I put them on that cooling rack in the oven. That keeps all the waffles crispy and warm til serving time.

Very very good! I highly recommend separating the egg whites into a separate bowl and whipping until you have stiff peaks and then folding into the batter.  So decadent with strawberries and real whipped cream

This was a good basic recipe and like the others I doubled the sugar and vanilla. I did add about a teaspoon of cinnamon. The waffles are not sweet but with syrup they are perfect. Thanks for a great recipe !

This is a perfect waffle recipe, a little crunch on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The only thing I changed was, I used almondmilk instead of regular milk, I doubled the vanilla so I added a whole teaspoon instead of half and in addition to the sugar, I added a tablespoon of brown sugar also, so 1 tablespoon of white sugar and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Perfect!

I made a half recipe this morning. I used a little more than half sugar plus I added a half tablespoon of brown sugar and an eighth teaspoon of good Saigon cinnamon. I used Mexican vanilla and I was generous with it. These baked up beautifully in my antique electric waffle iron. If I made this again I would be even more generous with the cinnamon, vanilla and brown sugar: I couldn't tell that I added extra ingredients; but these tasted good and they were not tough. Enjoy!

I'm pretty happy with this waffle recipe. I'll definitely make them again since the ingredients are all things I keep around the house regularly. There's nothing involved that I'd have to go out of my way to get.

Best waffles ever! Thanks for sharing it!
I replaced the oil for coconut oil. Used whole wheat white flour.  2 Tbsp brown sugar, a pinch of nutmeg & Ginger. Beat the egg whites separately as other reviewers suggested. Folded wet ingredients into dry. Poured about 1/3 cup batter per waffle. Cooked each batch for 3 minutes. Delicious!!!!

I made it again on 2/11/18 with white flour, adding a cup of sour cream, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and orange liqueur instead of vanilla. My son said my best waffles ever!

The Best Waffles ever!!  So easy, look just as pictured! And delicious!  I double the sugar and vanilla and my granddaughters eat them right off the iron with nothing else on them.  It makes 4 waffles in my Flip side Presto waffle iron, which is the best too!!  Cook in 4 or 5 minutes on the iron which has a timer and they come out perfect without sticking.  We have been making these for a couple years now.  Thanks!

Instead of beating the eggs and all that I just put them in the batter as they were and it worked out fine!! I love these because the taste is fluffy and eggy (not in a bad way)! They taste the best with butter and maple syrup!!

Not a fan - seemed dry.  Made one substitution which was using almond milk.  Not sure if this was the problem but won't make it again.

pretty good recipe on it's own.  I've tweaked it since by adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of international delight creamer ( cinnabon or your favorite flavor)  as the batter was too thick and I couldnt find my vanilla. results?  DELICIOUS! my family refuses to have it without the creamer now.

I noticed that most of the people who didn't give it 5 stars changed something in the recipe. If you make it exactly as written, the waffles turn out perfectly. The secret I think is to beat all of the wet ingredients together well before adding the dry ingredients. Beat the dry ingredients only until blended. Don't over-beat. The only things I did different were that I used 1% milk and 3 small eggs since I didn't have large eggs. They don't need extra sugar or vanilla to taste as waffles are supposed to taste. It made 8 waffles at 273 calories each.

Made this one as written except for adding a little more vanilla, using 2 tbsp of sugar and adding 2 (loosely packed) tbsp of brown sugar.   
I beat the eggs, then wisked in all the liquid ingredients, then wisked in the dry ingredients one at a time.  Cooked up beautifully and tasted even better.  This one is a keeper and worth passing on to family & friends.

These are the best waffles ever and so easy to make.  I substituted coconut oil for the oil and almond milk for milk what a difference.  Light, crispy and oh so delicious.  Even my husband wants these again.

This is a great basic recipe to work off of. I prefer to use Brown sugar and coconut oil for a nice flavor. Sometimes I add a bit of cinnamon too! I have a suspicion that those who really hated the recipe did not make it right. Look carefully at teaspoon vs tablespoon for your baking power measurement. I also saw some people say all they could taste was baking SODA! Baking soda is not the same thing as baking powder and would taste God awful in this recipe, so just make sure you are using the correct amount of baking POWDER and these should come out just fine!

I have never made waffles before and I just purchased my 1st waffle iron yesterday.  I read the comments, I separated the eggs and mixed till fluffy but folded them in at the end.  I melted Becel margarine instead of butter and I sprinkled in a couple of dashes of cinnamon.  It was great and my family and I are very pleased.  Thanks to all who put their own version because it helped me a lot!  This was definitely 5 stars!

This recipe is a lifesaver! First of all it's hard to get my kids to eat anything for breakfast but they've been eating these every morning if I add chocolate chips or blueberries. Second I can make a double batch and keep the batter in the fridge all week, so they get to have fresh waffles every morning and it takes me less than 10 minutes to make. Plus they're delicious!!

Recipe by itself is a little bland. I whipped the egg whites separately and doubled the sugar (restaurants are usually a little sweeter and that's what I was going for). I also used half oil and half apple sauce.

I recently purchased  a waffle iron.  This is the first  time I have ever made waffles and this recipe turned out great.  I added fresh blueberries to the batter.  As with any recipe it is a base - get creative!!!. I'll keep this one handy.  My grandchildren will love it.

The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it didn't suggest how much batter to pour in to the waffle iron.  I overflowed  it and had a mess to clean.

These are great. I replaced the butter with an equal amount of (melted) coconut oil and I used the gluten free flour from Costco, and it came out awesome.

Such a great waffle recipe. I've made it the exact way it says, and then the second time I added blueberries. Both ways are so good.

I used 1% milk and substituted honey for the sugar, and the waffles turned out perfectly! Yummy!

I replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with cream, doubled the sugar, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Was amazing!!!
I also added the oil to the eggs directly since it mixes better that way, before adding the milk. 
Will be making again.

Excellent. A double batch made 8 waffles,  if you were wondering.   Def. The only waffle recipe I will ever need or want. 

Even with my additions: a drained can of corn and a half pound of diced ham.

Made it as is with the exception of substituting melted butter for oil. That's what was on hand. Wish I had made extra to freeze for breakfast before school. They were excellent.

I took one star off because I made some slight changes based on the other reviews - but they were awesome! My first try they were perfect - I added an extra tablespoon of sugar & doubled the vanilla - I also kept the egg whites aside & folded them in at the end - they were light & fluffy and my whole family loved them - I got 3 high fives.  also - after I wrote this review and I realized I left the oil out accidentally and they were still great!

I separated eggs and used in my nutri-bullet with homemade non-fat buttermilk and stevia.  They turned out so light and fluffy and were seriously the best waffles I've ever had! Will definitely be putting this recipe in the vault.  Thank you all recipes.

I use this recipe often. It's great and very simple. I add cinnamon to the mix only because I just love cinnamon. I make the batter and keep it in the fridge all week. Thanks!

I already have a great waffle recipe, but I found this when I needed an alternate where I could use lactose free milk, due to milk allergies by a couple of my family members.  Tastes great with what ever milk you use!   I also whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in after I made the batter.  That makes a nice fluffy batter.  I half the recipe when there are only two of us, which is a perfect amount.

This is a really good basic recipe for waffles.  I found we prefer the ones that use melted butter than oil but these are great for when the butter supply is running low.  They are light and airy in texture.

These are SO good and SO easy! My entire family loves them. We have been suing this recipe for about a year now. Never lets us down. We made them for some friends as well and this is also now the only recipe she uses. Can't beat it. I do add a bit of extra sugar and vanilla if I want it extra sweet.

As we all should the first time 'round, I made this recipe exactly as it's written.  Fabulous!  Perfect baking powder leavened waffles!  

People shouldn't whinge about the whole eggs, high fat, etc.  These are waffles.  Not a health food.  Just don't eat them all the time and enjoy them as they're meant to be.  Sorry, but egg whites and skim milk are not ingredients of real waffles.  :)  This recipe is awesome.

Great recipe. I modified by separating the yolks and whites. Whipped the whites to stiff peaks and carefully folded them into the batter just before pouring into the iron. Fluffy, light and crispy! Absolutely delicious.

Loved this recipe as a base,  substituted half and half for milk (it's what I had). Whipped eggs, added Half and half,  and whipped some more. Mixed dry ingredients. Doubled sugar and vanilla, as recommended by others. Added a dash of nutmeg and 2 dashes if cinnamon and 1/4tsp of almond extract to up the flavor. Beat it all together....magnifiquè!

This recipe is perfect! I've made it many times before and it is by far the best out of all the others I've tried. The only thing I recommend is after you are done mixing the ingredients check the consistency of the mixture to make sure it is not too thick or too thin and add more milk or flour if needed. I also love to add blueberries or chocolate chips or cinnamon to my waffles!

Great recipe. Experimenting with replacing some of the milk  with seltzer (1 cup milk 3/4 seltzer) and beating egg whites. Not sure yet if the effort is worth it.  The timing of adding the seltzer seems to be toward the end for the fluffiest end result.

We love this recipe!!! I always have a batch in the fridge ready to go. We are a GF family so we substitute the flour with Bobs Red Mill 1 to1 flour. You could never tell they are gluten free. We also substitute the sugar with 3TBS coconut sugar and the vegetable oil for coconut oil. My next experiment will be to replace the flour with a grain free version. We also use a restaurant style waffle maker. The kind you have to flip over and seen at most hotels. It makes the outside slightly crispy and the inside so soft and almost gooey ! Oh I love these waffles! I highly recommend this recipe it's Excellent.

Perfect waffles! I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup oil and they came out great.

Made exactly as recipe indicated and turned out perfect!  Light and fluffy and the flavor was delicious.  My 12 year old son is a waffle/pancake connoisseur and he loved these!  This will be our go-to recipe for waffles.

I stuck to the original recipe but the waffle maker had lost its non-stick (had been in the cupboard for about 20 years) so made pancakes instead - delicious.  Will use again.

Great Recipe! Easy, good flavor, ingredients are things most of us always have on hand. What's not to love? I followed this recipe, but did substitute 1 teas of white sugar for 1 teas of brown sugar.  I used a Breville Smart 4-slice waffle maker and there was enough batter to make 9 squares of classic waffles. I thought I could eat 2, but it was too much. We made the whole recipe and froze the leftovers. Thanks!

I tried this waffle recipe and the classic waffle recipe. Both are well reviewed by users. No modifications were made to either and I use a cheap waffle maker for both. Both were successful but the consistency of the batter is significantly different. This recipe uses more milk and oil (415 vs 355ml & 120 vs 75 g butter/veg oil) hence the batter is MUCH thinner.  This waffle basically sizzled in my maker producing more oil and steam before getting a crispy end product. It does have an airy texture to it but not what you expect from  restaurant waffles. That said, maybe its my not so professional waffle maker that is at fault. It was flat, crispy and a light slightly cake like texture although it was way too oily. I am not the health nut type and love my butter but will definitely reduce it to 70 gram for my next batch. I guess more people tried this recipe and that is why it has more ratings but most of the reviews involved modifications especially to the amounts of oil. I would do the same if you decide to try this recipe. A thinner batter is already hard to work with and cleaning up the oil around the maker is another chore. It is however a good recipe for a home taste waffle.

The other recipe produced a better waffle that resembles the type in a restaurant. It had enough height and crispiness, possibly because batter is also thicker and that allowed the iron on both sides to work its magic. It is also easier to manage.  

Thankfully both produced decent waffles but if I h

I love this recipe, I use it every time I make waffles! I add a pinch of salt and use vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract. I also sometimes slightly undercook them by about thirty seconds to a minute so that I can freeze them and heat them back up in the toaster and they won't come out too crunchy. They're perfect for when you're late for work and have no time to make anything else ^u^

I love this recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I used Fairlife low fat milk to up the protein and reduce the fat, coconut oil melted for the oil, Splenda instead of sugar, sugar free vanilla syrup, increased the vanilla extract and added vanilla protein powder to increase protein.  They where very filling and husband and grand-babies LOVED them!

These were...waffles. They came out a good fluffiness and texture, but just didn't have much taste. Not bad, just..not much. Before making again, I'll look through the reviewer comments and experiment with the various adjustments to the recipe.

Quick and easy recipe, but the waffles were really bland and flavorless. Fine if you just want a vessel for the toppings, but not great if you want to enjoy the waffle itself.

Love this recipe!  I was out of waffle mix & tried this on a whim.  The kids loved it and requested I make this instead of using the other mix from now on.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy and quick.  Waffles came out fluffy & yummy.  I had to turn the waffle iron up a notch to get the waffles a bit crispier but they are good soft or crispy - just a personal preference.   No more Eggos for us! Thanks for sharing!  :-)

I halved everything except the baking powder (cuz I forgot). I added a couple teaspoons to the batter and it still came out awesome. Crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Can't wait to make variations of these!

Good basic recipe, kinda bland. tried doubling vanilla and sugar as some suggested and recipie was better the 2nd time, but would try another next time to compare. Not bad, not super awesome, but good.

Halved the recipe - only cooking for 2 this morning - using brown sugar and the blender method.  WOW!  Definitely my new 'go to' waffle recipe.  Will try some of the adaptations suggested but with fresh fruit and real maple syrup on top perfect as is!

Good waffle recipe, just seemed to need more flavor. I think i will use butter instead of oil and double the vanilla the next time. Otherwise, it was good. I made Belgium waffles so this made about 5 waffles.

Awesome and easy!! I did add lemon extract instead of vanilla and a few blueberries to some. I also did what others have said and folded the egg whites in at the end . They were super moist and fluffy. Great tasting and easy to make easy recipe.

I just made this for my kids because we were out of the usual complete mix. Good stuff. I halfed the recipe and it made the perfect amount for use with our Mickey Mouse waffle maker. I would up the vanilla a little bit. Will definitely use this again.

Today I made waffles for the first time ever, and I used this awesome recipe!  I used half oil/half unsweetened applesauce, and half white/half whole wheat flour.  The waffles turned out perfectly!  I made plain waffles, blueberry waffles, and chocolate chip waffles, all with this same recipe. It is my go-to recipe for waffles now.

Crispy on outside  and very light.  Without the syrup, not much taste at all?  Perhaps if I added more vanilla or cinnamon..

I made this based on the great positive reviews.  I followed some of the suggestions, whipped the egg whites and folded them in, increased the sugar (used Splenda) to 4 T. , etc.  They did brown and crisp but they have absolutely no taste.  I'll look for something else as these are very ho-hum.

Awesome recipe!  Made it "as is", except I separated out the egg whites and yolks, whipped up the egg whites last and folded those into the batter.  Made for a light, fluffy waffle.  Will definitely make again and will probably try some of the variations listed by other users.

Easy!
The best part a out this recipe s the crunchiness on the outside and the melt-in-your-mouth softness on the inside.
Only change I made was, instead of one tbsp sugar, I added two.
Thank you much Allrecipes!

I like to make a recipe the way it states before making any changes so I can review it accordingly.  The only thing I changed was I blended all of the ingredients in the blender.  I put the eggs in first, blended,  then added the rest of the ingredients and they are indeed fluffy with a crispy outside.  The only thing they lack is taste.  They are so bland!  I am adding cinnamon to the rest of the batter and maybe even some ginger and nutmeg but yeah...add some flavor unless you like bland food ;)  But overall, great base recipe!

I just added nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger and it's slightly better.  I think maybe adding applesauce in lieu of some oil might give it some flavor and doubling the vanilla?  I'm sure some reviewers said the same thing, just don't want to read them all ;)

This is but one of many waffle recipes that we have tried, but the best one bar none! We use a flip style waffle iron, and they come out light and fluffy every time! We do follow the recipe and use canola oil. In many recipes you must split your eggs, another plus to this one. Enjoy!

My 8yo son and I made this recipe together.  It was easy and delicious! We even used chocolate milk instead because we ran out of regular milk and it turned out tasty.  Try it!

My son has milk and egg allergies so I  had to substitute the soymilk for the milk and powdered egg replacer for the egg.  Given that, my results might be different than the recipe as written.  With my substitutions these were okay but a bit bland.  I added dried cranberries to one and that was much better.  My son ate them with maple syrup but seemed to agree that without adding something sweet, they are too bland to really want to eat.

My husband and I enjoyed these. I did make half the recipe and I used unbleached flour (not wheat) and I added a bit of butter flavor and drop almond flavor as well as alcohol free organic vanilla flavoring and there is a huge difference in the non-alcohol flavoring much richer flavors.  They had a very clean taste. I will make them again.

This is a very yummy waffle recipe but, the ingredients need to be rewritten for it to not be so lumpy. Next time I will  put eggs in one bowl and beat them then in a separate bowl add all dry ingredients, add milk, oil and vanilla to beaten eggs, then slowly add dry ingredients in. I believe this will make a not so lumpy end product!

Took the healthier route as recommended by others with great results:
Vanilla Noosa Yogurt in place of oil.
Whole wheat flour (a bit more)
Skim milk (a bit less)
2 tsp fresh lemon juice.
2 tsp vanilla.
1/4 tsp cinnamon.
Whipped Egg whites separate folded in at the end.

Good basic recipe. It yielded 5 Belgian waffles from this batch. They turned out crispy, tender, and light. As the recipe author suggested, I used whole wheat pastry flour. Very good.

Delicious and easy!  I used non fat milk and doubled the recipe because I had a large group for breakfast.  They were perfect.  At first I thought they could have used a little more sugar, but then I realized I had maple syrup and boysenberry syrup, so they did not need any extra sugar in the batter.  My granddaughter said they were the best waffles she ever had. Everyone loved them, and they were gone in a flash.  Will use this recipe again for sure, and will try the plain yogurt in place of the oil as another reviewer mentioned.
Update...two weeks later I made them again...only used one quarter oil, which was sufficient.  Also, doubled the vanilla.  Added an extra half tsp of sugar.  In my estimation, the sugar is probably un necessary, because you can't taste it anyway, and if you are going to use syrup you wil have plenty of sweetness.  
The waffles were great, this is a good basic recipe..
Have also served these with sliced banana and whipped cream!  6/24/18 update: made these again, for company, substituted plain nonfat yoghurt for the oil, put in about 1 tsp of oil " just in case" it needs something to not stick.  They were so light, and so delicious.  Didn't get a chance to take a picture, they were gobbled up!  This is the ONLY waffle recipe I consistently use.

Love this recipe I made it so many times I decided to make it diet friendly.  I replaced the flour with ground oatmeal, replace milk with almond milk,replace veg. oil with coconut oil and the sugar with stevia. And absolutely delicious!!!!

This is a great base recipe! I definitely recommend reading reviews before making as there are some excellent recommendations for adjustments. I made these today and I increased the white sugar to 2 1/2 TBSP, added 1/2 TBSP of ground cinnamon to the flour mixture, and I put the flour, baking powder, and cinnamon into a sifter and then sifted into the wet portion of the mix. I also tossed in sliced almonds once I poured the batter onto the griddle for some extra healthfulness! Yum!

Easy and tasty. Many other recipes used more than one bowl, which was a turn off for me. Glad I picked this one!  Will be my go-to waffle recipe.

This is by far the best waffle recipe I've used. It's perfect the way it is. They came out crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My kids beg for these every Sunday! In fact I'm making them right now.  Thank you for the great recipe.

This is 7 star waffle !! I used to make ready mix waffles and i runed out of it and got this recipie . When it was done i was like hey ! How i spet my life eating ready mix this recipes is AMAZING goooood .. I made a little change , i added 6 Tbs of sugar instead of 2 so i don't need to add syrup later on , and 1 Tbs of vanilla instead of half Tbs . This twists make it easy to put it in sandwich bag and send it with your kid to daycare.

I made some substitutions on the flour I used gluten free, I used organic apple sauce instead of oil and I used a can of real coconut milk instead of buttermilk and raw cane sugar for white sugar. My family loved it. So fluffy!

Loved the recipe, the waffles were  tasty and light and not too sweet. Just right! One change I made the second time around was, I separated the egg white from the yolk and beat the whites until they were all foam, then I gently stirred them in at the very end. It made the waffles extra fluffy.

My mistake turned out to be a hit! Instead of using vegetable oil, I cut the amount of vegetable oil in half and used coconut oil for the other half. My mistake was adding the warm liquid coconut oil to the cold milk and let it sit while I used a hand mixer to whip the egg whites. The coconut oil solidified. 

Instead of pitching the milk, egg yokes, vegetable oil, coconut oil and vanilla, I broke up the solidified oil and proceeded to mix the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, then folded in the egg whites. 

It ended up fantastic! The solidified coconut oil acted like butter cut into pastry would. It turned the waffles crispy on the outside and soft and springy on the inside. Yummers.

I made this recipe for my kids and myself this morning as a sweet gesture before my 3 year old goes to preschool. They were by far the worst waffles any of us had ever tasted. The texture was horrible, very cardboard-esque and the flavor wasn't much better. I felt terrible that  I wasted time, energy and dishes on this . I had to make my kids another meal under a time crunch so that they wouldn't go hungry. Do yourselves a favor and find another recipe. I'm pretty sure any other recipe would be better!

Great basic waffle recipe! I wanted something quick and easy that did not require whipping egg whites - this recipe fits the bill. My waffle iron will finally get some regular use!

For extra fluffy, add a tsp or two of baking soda in addition to the baking powder!  It makes it almost magically fluffy!

Sprayed some oil just before the waffles were fully done, so they came out really crisp from the outside and soft inside. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for my kiddos (I do Atkins, so none for me!) and they loved it!  I make them, let them cool and then freeze them.  1 minute in the microwave (or toaster oven) and the kiddos get a homemade breakfast even on busy days.  Go for it!

Fluffy, tasty and crisp. This is by far the best waffle recipe out there. Perfect the way it is, I do however (if I have time) beat the eggs whites.

Ever since I found this recipe a few years ago I've never used another. No-fail, fabulous waffles every time! I omit the sugar because I drown them in maple syrup.

I love this recipe base! I ran out of white flour and decided to double the recipe. I then halved the recipe with wheat flour and white flour. I sifted all ingredients and doubled the sugar. I also added 1/4 flax meal and used olive oil instead of canola. Fluffy and yum!

I make this recipe on Sunday mornings and freeze leftovers to be reheated during the busy weekdays. I do make some healthy substitutions. I use Oat Flour (which is also gluten free) instead of white flour, coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil, 1 TSP raw honey instead of the sugar and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and I increase vanilla to 1 TSP.  The honey sweetens it very well and all my kids and husband gobble it up! I do also like to separate the egg whites (as was recommended by a previous poster), then use a hand mixer to beat egg whites until fluffy and fold in as the last step!

Make as directed.  It is awesome.  I beat the eggs well, then added one at time the other wet ingredients, mixing well after each.  Then add the dry ingredients all at once and mix just until well incorporated.  Perfect Waffles.

I added sugar, vanilla, used apple sauce instead of oil, sub some buttermilk...Very easy to prepare. I have prepared this recipe multiple times using 2 different irons - one George Foreman that simply closes down and Belgian style one that flips over. The batter bakes nicely in both however, I can't say that it has any kind of distinctive flavor or texture that makes me want to come back for more. It doesn't have that "oomph" I am looking for.

This has become our "go to" recipe for waffles. Easy and delicious. I add a 3/4 t.- 1 t. of vanilla just because we enjoy that flavor.  Perfect every time.

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT RECIPE! FAMILY FAVORITE! The only variation I make is to use 2 tablespoons of sugar (I like my waffles slightly crisper and sweeter).

Best part of making these waffles was watching my 7-year old take off his pajama top, so he can enjoy the yummy waffles without getting syrup on his top. In all seriousness, this is a great recipe.  modified it based on what I had (or did not have) in my pantry this morning. I was out of vanilla extract but had Starbucks vanilla syrup; I used 2 pumps to replace both the sugar and vanilla extract. I had a smidge more milk left so I ended up using 2 cups of it instead of 1 and 3/4. I added a handful of chopped walnuts I served them to my family for breakfast, topped with butter and maple syrup. They loved it! Thank you for sharing the recipe, photo, and video!

very easy to make with what a typical pantry holds. Everyone in my family loved it, even my hubby who is a waffle "snob". Saves great in the fridge too for quick morning breakfast for the kiddos.

These were so good and so adaptable! Half whole wheat flour, a little grated Apple, halved the oil,  a little extra vanilla, a bit of brown sugar. . . .For those of you adding cinnamon. . . .try adding 1/4-1/2 tsp of ground ginger as well! We also added in some bacon I had cooked, gently, and diced. The smell had everyone lined up, plates in hand!
My favorite recipes are the ones that let me play and make them my own! Thank you!

Double the sugar and vanilla, can add a little cinnamon. seperate the eggs, beat the whites until fluffy and fold them in last. Put on baking rack to cool so they don't get soggy.

Ran out of bisquick and this was a better substitute however I like it a little sweeter. Next time I'll probably do 2x as much sugar.

This recipe is amazing, I use it for both waffles and pancakes and it's perfect for both! The absolute best part is I found this recipe YEARS ago and it is so perfect that when I was diagnosed with celiac disease 2 years ago I tried it with a gluten free flour mixture and it STILL works perfectly. Even my husband and son who HATE my gluten free food still ask me to make pancakes regularly, they come out perfectly fluffy on the inside and with the best crisp on the outside every single time.

2 minutes in the waffle iron seems to cook them just right!  My kids now insist on this recipe whenever they have friends over.  I've added mashed bananas and/or chocolate chips as well.

Use this recipe all the time since we got a waffle maker for our wedding :) It's a great base recipe, but I've also made different variations by doctoring it up a bit. My favorite is adding a bit of chopped apple, nutmeg and cinnamon! Great recipe and easy to make!

I was feeding 8, so I doubled it. I separated the egg whites and beat them with 3/4 tsp cream of tartar and the sugar, 'til they were somewhere between soft and stiff peaked.  Folded it in to the rest of the mix 1/3 first, and then the rest,  and cooked the first waffle.  The texture was just right, but it had no taste,  I doubled the vanilla, added a bit (maybe 1/4 tsp)  of almond extract, a couple Tbsp. of brown sugar and crushed and added a handful of pecans.  Next waffle was perfect.  I forget the actual yield,  but we only had two left over with eight people at the table.

It was unnecessarily fatty and bland. 

Then I tried to improve based on a lot of other comments from other reviewers. I did 3 eggs instead of 2, doubled the sugar, 2 tbsp of oil instead of 1/2 cup, buttermilk instead of regular, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of vanilla. SO much better. 

I only got 5 waffles.

The only things I changed were using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used half whole wheat flour/half regular flour. I made none of the other modifications that commenters suggested, and these waffles were still delicious. The whole family loved them. I used a little less than 2/3 cup of mix for each waffle in my Belgian waffle maker. This will be my new go-to recipe.

Thanks for such a great recipe.   I have made a couple changes to fit my family.  We love vanilla so I add two tablespoons. Plus I separate the yolk and egg whites as other people have suggested.   Very yummy. We make them once or twice a week. Even when my son's friends come over, its what they request for breakfast.

We reheat them during the week in the toaster. The kids love them!
I have substituted coconut oil and olive oil for the veg oil.  They both turned out great.

I followed it exactly, but I found this recipe to lack flavor. Maybe adding more vanilla, using butter instead of oil, or a bit more sugar next time would help.

This is the second recipe I've tried and the last one I'll ever try!  I doubled the vanilla and sugar and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I'm new at waffle making so it took some trial and error. So this may help a few of you: I set my Oster 3883 to medium high (in the middle of the middle dot and first "max" dot) and I cooked them for 4 1/2- minutes. I noticed it took a lot of time for my very first waffle to crisp. Even though the "ready" light was on it still wasn't hot enough I'm assuming.  Anyway, I also do not have a mixer or whisk. I used a fork for mixing and it still turned out good. I'm sure using a hand mixer will make them even better! I added the beat egg yokes to the mixing bowl first. All the dry ingredients, then mixed (without touching the yokes at the bottom.) Then I mixed the liquid ingredients in a different bowl, added them to the mixing bowl and beat until all lumps were gone. I did my best at fluffing egg whites in a small, separate bowl then folded them in. I used a 2/3 measuring cup to pour my batter in. Butter flavored cooking spray. This recipe made 5 waffles. Hope this helps someone!

Okay, so I didn't have vegetable oil, but I had coconut oil and decided to add that instead. It was absolutely delicious! Be sure to mix in the coconut oil immediately after pouring or it will solidify and you'll have pieces of it in your batter.

Great, easy to make recipe. Fluffy, light and not too sweet. Perfect for adding your own toppings to compliment the excellent floor of the waffles alone.

Great, simple recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe and was very impressed. It was the first time I'd made waffles from scratch. We were out of bisquick, but had all the ingredients on hand, won't be buying bisquick anymore!

Made this with a few tweaks and it was wonderful. I heard all sorts of yummy noises being made at the table and the house smells wonderful!

Tweaks: Butter instead of oil. I almost always substitute
butter for oil in recipes that use flour.  I doubled the vanilla, used two tablespoons of brown sugar (no white). Brown sugar adds a caramel flavor that I love!  I put in a few healthy shakes of cinnamon and a few shakes of allspice. I separated the eggs and beat the whites, which I folded in at the end. 

They were fluffy, crisp, and had a really wonderful flavor. Served with organic maple syrup. I'm going to use the leftover batter to make waffle sundaes for dessert.

We love these waffles! I definitely recommend beating the egg whites to make them a bit more fluffy. My kids gobble these down! I will occasionally throw in some flax seed as well.

Delicious, but did change...all I had was cake flour & used melted butter instead of not-to-fresh oil.  I love waffles covered in berries & some powdered sugar.  These did not disappoint.

Just bought my first waffle maker.  Needed to find a simple recipe with ingredients I actually had in my house.

I followed the recipe step by step.  The only change I made in my recipe was to double the sugar and the vanilla.  

The waffles came out PERFECT and seriously the BEST waffles I ever ate.

Made it exactly by the recipe, and was blown away by the texture: light and dense at the same time. Flavor was delightful as well. Even with mediocre toppings, these waffles shine, and cook well light or dark.

These came out great with a few popular modifications that most seem to have used. I also separated the eggs and beat the whites separately and folded them in at the end. I put 2 TBSP of white and 2TBSP of brown sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla extract (and they still weren't very sweet at all), ½ tsp cinnamon and I used buttermilk instead of regular milk (milk with some white vinegar that sat for 5 mins) for better flavor. They came out great!

Only change I made was half and half in place of milk, only cause it was in the fridge with a very near expiration date. Added chocolate chips for the kids ones and pecans for hubby. I added fruit into mine. But this was for the individual waffles, not into the batter. Next time I'll separate the eggs per other reviewers comments and see if it makes any taste difference. Very quick and easy recipe and better than any store bought mix I've tried.

This is a great waffle recipe! The waffle gets crispy on the outside and light and airy on the inside! The trick to this recipe is to NOT over stir it. If it is too smooth your waffles will be rubbery and not have crispy airy texture C:

OMG...so perfect!  I studied all the reviews for a bunch of waffle recipes, and this seemed to be the best one.  I'm glad I found this recipe, it is the first and last one I will ever need.  I did add two extra tablespoons of sugar and a little bit more vanilla.   I followed the advice of another reviewer by using a blender to fluff the egg whites first.  Then I added the rest of the liquid ingredients to the blender.  Because my blender is too small, I had to put the flour in a big bowl and then I mixed the liquid into the bowl by hand until mixed well.  These came out so fluffy and delicious...make this recipe!!

Deliciously fluffy and kid approved.  A bit bland solo, but this allows high quality maple syrup flavors to shine!  We love trader joes organic grade a maple syrup.  The vanilla in this waffle recipe really brings out the chocolate notes in the syrup.

I used less vanilla to make it a basic waffle. Great with syrup  and butter. It was great with turkey and gravy. It would be perfect for sweet or savory meals. Only I make waffles and pancakes in bulk so I made 6 batches of batter and made 55 waffles. I then freeze them in freezer bags and heat them up in the toaster, microwave, or toaster oven when I need a meal in a hurry. Perfect. Thank you!

This is a classic, easy recipe. To healthy it up a bit we use half whole wheat and half regular all purpose flour and replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce, it was great!

These were perfect!!! Perfectly light and fluffy! I have a chef for a husband, and he's very picky with little things like pancakes and waffles. I've used other recipes that he wasn't thrilled with. I was told to keep THIS recipe!!! Thanks for sharing!!

I made two versions of these as my bf is alergic to gluten and both versions were disgusting.  Needless to say we had bacon for breakfast .  They didn't  crisp up and had to cook them long so they weren't  cake like.  Worst waffle recipe I ever tried.

Great recipe as written! Also takes substitution like a dream. Routinely use this as the base recipe for gluten and dairy free variants.

Waffles turned out perfectly and very tasty. I used applesauce instead of oil and separated the eggs, whipped the whites and added last.  Pretty easy and a great recipe.

My sister revealed to me that this is the recipe that she uses -it's great! She uses a blend of whole wheat & regular flour, and increases the amount of vanilla (1 tsp for a half-batch and 2 tsp for a whole batch).

LOVED IT. Made around 12 small (about 5 inches in diameter) waffles. I put another 1/2 of a teaspoon of vanilla extract in and everyone LOVED it!

I made these with the children in my class and they worked out great. I simply put all the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and whisked it briefly. Delicious and not too sweet.

The only thing that I changed about this recipe is that I used butter instead of vegetable oil. They are fantastic and taste great reheated or cold. :)

I just received a waffle iron from my daughter, and this is the third and best waffle recipe yet! I tweaked it by using melted coconut oil (because of all the health benefits), 1 tablespoon baking powder, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. The coconut oil makes them nice and crispy on the outside, so they don't go soggy after I add syrup.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic waffle recipe!!! UPDATE: I made this recipe today, leaving out the oil and not replacing it with anything. I used 1/3 cup whole wheat flour, the rest white.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for lift. The waffles were light and tasty, but they were difficult to lift out of the iron. Usually, I just use a fork with long tines, but with this batter I had to use a long pancake turner to support the waffle during lifting it out. Still, given the benefits of fat free with a bit of added fiber, the extra work was worth it. I will be making this recipe without the oil again.

I  was looking for a quick and easy waffle recipe and this was great!  The waffles came out nice and fluffy and very tasty. I also liked that I didn't have to separate the egg yolks from the whites.

Fluffy,flavorful, and delicious! I added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable. 
Added peanut butter, chocolate chips, and banana on top, finished it with a touch of syrup. YUM

Loved how these turned out. I'm trying to make more meals from scratch. These were extremely simple and tasted pretty good. Will be following some of the other adjustments people have made as well to see the difference. Thank you to all of you for sharing your recipes and to those that comment with their suggestions on changes.

I love these waffles!!!! Before trying these I was hooked on the Belgian waffle recipe but it just took too long! The changes I made was to add more vanilla ( but I always do that), chocolate chips for the kiddos, brown sugar, cinnamon, beat egg whites separately and change the oil to applesauce (based on other reviews).  Great change.  I didn't taste the difference at all.  Also, instead of spraying the waffle iron, I brush it with coconut oil ( I heard that it preserves the waffle iron longer).   The waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My whole family loved them!

These were great!  Nice basic waffle.  Crisp on the outside, soft and dense on the inside.  We added slightly more vanilla and sprinkles for the kids to the batter.

Followed recipe exactly as described and turned out great. 
To please latin-american taste buds, used to more spice and sweetness, I added 3 more spoons of sugar and half teaspoon of cinnamon. My family loves it. We are eating these right now.

I love this waffle recipe.  I have made it several dozen times.
The only modifications I do is sometimes add one extra egg and a HUGE yam or 2 large mashed / pureed yams.  You literally can never have too much yam in these.
I roast my yams (sometimes the night before) then use a teaspoon of butter or a tad of water and my electric beaters to puree them.  I make the recipe as usual and mix it then I add my puree'd yams and mix with electric beaters again till smooth.  My kids far prefer them made with yams as they are sweet and I prefer them as its just a little more nutrition for them.  I make these every weekend and freeze them in a single layer then store them in a ziplock and put them in my sons lunch a few days a week.  If using them at breakfast I thaw for 30 seconds in the microwave then lightly toast them.  Yummm.

Great recipe. Easy, easy, easy. Substituted 1/4 of the flour for wheat flour (same total amount), used only 1/3 cup of oil, added a little more white sugar and used lactose free milk. Very yummy recipe. So much better than using packaged mixes with only a few extra minutes of time.

As suggested by others, I separated the eggs and beat the whites till peaks formed, then I added the whites last. I also added cinnamon & brown sugar and substituted applesauce for the oil. I doubled the recipe: using 1 cup of Sarah's applesauce from all recipes, finely pureed: 2 t brown sugar and 1 t cinnamon. It was a hit.  I have a belgian waffle maker that makes 4 waffles at a time. Doubled, this recipe made 18. Perfect for my family of 6. Thanks! No more boxed waffle mixes for us!

I followed the recipe exactly and although the texture was great, the flavor was a little off. I felt like you could really taste the baking powder, and my husband commented that they were "okay but weird". They were just a little too bitter and chemical-tasting for us.

We ate them with syrup and they were fine, but next time I think I'll take out a tsp of baking powder and see how they do.

Followed the recipe using white/whole wheat flour and the waffles were amazing!  Added sliced strawberries to make the perfect Sunday morning breakfast.

Easy recipe - by far beats the box mix.  Next time I would boost the flavor just a bit with a touch more vanilla or vanilla bean paste.

Good recipe! I've made it before following the recipe, but today I ran out of milk, so I used canned evaporated milk, and it came out a lot better! Also, I made some chocolate chip waffles, and blueberry waffles using frozen blueberries. Both were great!

This has become my "go to" waffle recipe.  I love that I can reduce to 3 servings and the recipe comes out nice and even and I don't end up with leftovers because reheated waffles are never as good as ones fresh from the Waffle Iron!

Delicious and adjustable! As others said, you can easily omit the oil for apple sauce, but I find that even unsweetened apple sauce tends to make the waffle stick more. If you go the wheat flour route, expect it to be a thicker batch (the apple sauce helps cut thin it out though).  The best part of the recipe is you can easily add fruit or chocolate chips or both! My personal favourite is bananas and blueberries, and the apple sauce compliments both nicely. My only warning about this recipe is the amounts; at half the recipe my waffle iron can easily make 2 giant waffles. For those who are light eaters or have children, I strongly recommend cutting the recipe in half, if not you can easily have these again the day after!

We loved this recipe! They cooked perfect in the waffle maker and didn't stick! I doubled the recipe for 4 of us and only had a few leftover to freeze. Definitely a keeper!

The recipe was good.  After I read other reviews and adjusted, the recipe went from good to perfect. 
I used egg whites and beat them in a separate bowl. I used Greek plain no fat yogurt in place of the oil. Put in 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon - because we both love cinnamon. I beat all ingredients except the whites. Then I folded in the beaten whites. Talk about light and fluffy, it remained so to the last waffle baking. 
Thank you for posting this because I always wanted to make waffles from scratch but felt I was not knowledgeable enough to try making it on my own. With this recipe I felt I could take my first step and go for it.

Great, light, perfect waffles every time. Make them every weekend. You can freeze them and use a toaster to warm them up later and they come out perfect. Often make a big batch on the weekend and can use them all week.

These were fabulous - once you tweaked the recipe. When I first made it, it was far too liquidy; the batter kept spilling out onto my counter. Then I added more flour, and it was perfect. If — actually when — I make these again, I'll use just 1 1/4 cups milk. Other than that issue, these are superb.

This was very good!  I did swap out half the oil for Greek yogurt and I mixed it all in the Vitamix, adding in hand-whipped egg whites.  Delicious and great texture.

We made some healthier swaps for this recipe: sprouted whole wheat flour, coconut palm, (melted) coconut oil.  We also added cinnamon, dried cranberries, and dark chocolate chips.  We were able to eat the waffles without syrup.  They were crisp, fluffy, shiny, and not too heavy.

First making:  these were fine, but a little bland.  Still looking around for the best waffle!

I just made for a second time today.  I followed the instructions of another reviewer, and these turned out delicious!  Ingredient changes:  2T of white sugar, 2T of brown sugar, 1-1/2t vanilla.  Building changes:  Separate the eggs, and whip the egg whites until light and fluffy.  Add yolks, milk, oil, and vanilla, mixing in between addition of each.  Mix dry goods in a separate bowl, and then combine the dry mixture to the liquid mixture.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.   Really great base recipe, I'll definitely be making some batter to keep in the fridge to make things even faster!

The first time I made this my batter was way too thin! I added a half cup more flour. My kids said they were the best waffles ever.  The second time I made these, I did the meringue at the end and HOLY MOLY!!! Still amazing!!!

I tried this recipe when I lost my all time favorite recipe. I was a little disappointed in its flavor.  I put the batter together as I am used, beating the egg whites till stiff peaks fo, then adding the sugar. I cooked in my deep welled Belgian iron, and I was happy with how fluffy they were.

World out great. After reading other reviews, I added a bit more vanilla.  In addition, my experiment-master son suggested syrup between additions of batter. It was actually verythromycin good. However,  he will be the one to clean the iron...

I doubled the recipe as is.  I just wisked up the eggs, added the other liquid ingredients  and added to the dry ingredients. I have a  Belgium waffle maker and they cooked up very nicely. Son in law and hubby had 2, we gals had 1, and I sent home 3 for freezer and toaster later. After reading reviews I wish I had added cinnamon and little more sugar. Still,  they were light  but crispy. A keeper.

I have made this several times. Comes out perfect. My 11 yr old has also made this. A definite keeper. I substituted yogurt for the oil. I also saved the batter for a week. It wasn't as fluffy but still tasty

This is the only waffle recipe I ever use.  Love that it is not "cake" like, it is very light, almost like the texture of a cruller.  Have made it for friends and family  many times and they keep asking for more!!

Excellent! Of course after the first waffle. (First waffle is always too soft ;-) ) super easy and moist in the inside. Great flavor! Tastes like a scone from the fair when you top with raspberry jam. My boys like it with butter and powdered sugar,  my husband with pure maple syrup.

This is my go-to waffle recipe! The only change I ever make is to use a cinnamon-sugar blend (instead of plain sugar). No changes needed though!

No changes.  I've made this recipe for years and just recently took the time to seperate the egg whites, beat them seperately until fluffy and fold them in.  It is totally worth it.  Waffles are so light and crispy!

This is a great easy recipe that was delicious. I did change it a little. I added almond and vanilla instead of just vanilla and also added a little more sugar because we don't use syrup. I also did half whole wheat flour and added a little more milk because of it.

I add a 1/2 cup of sugar and a whole teaspoon of Salt. The extra sugar allows for not needing syrup ( less mess).

Very good. I did whip the egg whites and that helped them be a little fluffier. I also added half a teaspoon of cinnamon. I followed the advice of others and split the sugar with half white half brown sugar. Kids and husband loved them and they were easy to make.

My family usually skips breakfast because of extended "beauty sleep", but I decided to make some breakfast this morning. I made these waffles with whole wheat flour, half the oil the recipe called for, double the vanilla and sugar, folded in egg whites with stiff peaks, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk, but the waffles were bit of a disappointment. They sort of turned out to be grainy and sort of sandy, dry and flavorless (until I added some honey and butter).I wanted to take the healthier choice, so I chose to used whole wheat flour, but I think it might of tasted better with just all purpose white flour. I don't get the people who commented that the whole wheat alternative was better. I think I admit that this is a great recipe, but it did not work out for me. Even though they tasted funny, most of it was gone by the end of breakfast.

Pretty basic recipe.  I substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose and added half a cup of water (whole wheat absorbs more liquids). They didn't fall apart in the waffle iron and had crispy edges and soft centers. I'll use this recipe again, but add more vanilla and sugar.

I had some family visiting and they ended up staying the night. Had a house full to feed the next morning. So I broke out the waffle maker and found this recipe. I made a batch and then I remembered I had some blueberries in the fridge. Even better! The possibilities apple cinnamon, strawberries with strawberry syrup, cherries, chocolate chips, etc.

I've never made homemade waffles myself but I'd say this recipe is a good start. I used waffle plates on one of those kitchen grill things and I think that was what didn't allow it to get fluffy. But I give it a 5star on taste! By halving the recipe I got 4 large (but fairly flat--like freezer waffle flat) waffles.

I needed a base recipe to test substituting Silk Cashew milk,Almond Flour and Agave syrup. I was unable to make waffles as the consistency just did not work. BUT, I made pancakes and they were delicious.  They were thin and a little delicate, but they were delicious.

This recipe is so easy to make. What takes it to 5 stars, however, is buttermilk! I subbed 3/4 cup of lowfat buttermilk for some of the regular milk and they turned out super soft and moist.

I made the recipe with whole wheat flour.  I had to use two hands to get my waffle iron open.  The waffles didn't stick, though, so I don't know if oil was the problem, but I'd like to try the recipe with more oil next time.  I guess they were kind of bland, but I'm used to having maple syrup on my waffles, and I ate these ones plain.  The recipe was easy, though, and, aside from the grittiness and dark color from the whole wheat flour, they had the texture and fluffiness I expect from waffles.

These were really good and the kiddos gobbled them up. So glad I found a good go to recipe. I did add some maple flavoring that I had at home and that made them very yummy. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is great as is. But certainly can be adapted for different moods of waffles.

Not a fan of these.  From a taste perspective, it's hard to judge because mime came out so dense, but it seemed like they could use a bit more sugar.

Great! I whipped the whites separate and I used 50/50 white and whole wheet. I tripled the recipe as I was cooking for a crowd, and there were no problems. Love the vanilla flavor without heavy sweetness of a box mix.

Tripled the recipe (hello, easy breakfast in the freezer!) followed almost exactly. I didn't have enough oil, so I filled in with a little butter (but I still didn't have enough for the full amount.) So, you could probably get away with using half the oil called for. 
Also, they weren't as sweet as the my usual recipe. It's ok though, because now I feel a little less badly about the syrup the kids are going to douse them with.

I tried these exactly as written and didn't like them at all.  Bland with too much baking powder (yes I used powder).   All of these reviews significantly the original recipes and should be published alone for critique.

My husband calls these crispy cream waffles because the outside is crunchy and the inside is soft and yummy. The wipping egg is how the fluffiness comes out so don't skip that step. I've mixed in banana and blueberries apples and chocolate chips. It can hassle the filling and come out amazing. Over subbed out half the oil for applesauce as well, a bout dense but still wonderful and you don't need the syrup so the kids will grab one and run.

This was the recipe that moved me to sign up and leave my first review. Great base recipe, but like others I made some small modifications to add flavor, as well as some build changes in putting it together. When prepping the batter, I first mixed all dry ingredients in a separate bowl.Then I separated the egg whites and blended well about medium speed with a electric mixer - basically until really frothy - 2 min or so. I then added all wet ingredients in, to include the egg yolks, and mixed on low until combined. I then added in the dry ingredients. Once all was blended together, you could really tell how light the batter was. It was different than just a regular wet batter. For the flavoring change, I just doubled the vanilla extract and white sugar. I made a couple plain, and they turned out excellent. I had some mini chocolate chips, so I mixed some of those in on the next two and they were awesome. Waffle was crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside. In my waffling experiences, you either get soggy and wet, or crispy and dry. This recipe finds a perfect happy medium.

The only thing I changed was vanilla yogurt in place of the extract. While they did turn out nice and fluffy, they weren't that flavorful. I will probably add cinnamon or other flavorings if I make this one again.

It was fast and delicious! ALL of my kids loved this recipe (it's not often that I can find a recipe that ALL four of my kids like)  :)
I did double the amount of vanilla and added two shakes of cinnamon. YUMMY!!!

Sooo good!  I didn't have any vanilla so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Also thought the mix was a little thick so I added some unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  Used whole wheat flower and whole milk for the main recipe.  Best waffles ever - the box doesn't compare.

I'm not an experienced cook or baker. I'm pretty much adventurous, which is to say my wife and her cooking club pals have probably shared some hearty laughs. But I still try. I found this recipe last night and started it this morning as my 3 year old decided she wanted to help, didn't want to help, wanted to play, wanted to pretend to be a baby in Daddy's arms.....while on the phone with my Mom (every Sunday since I left home for college) listening to her tell me things about her week she just got finished telling me.....and somehow I managed not to $#%! it up! They were so good, even my wife had one, and she never eats breakfast. So if you post on here that this recipe is no good, you've managed to get something wrong....or you just have very different experiences in your culinary adventures. This recipe is a keeper. Now I gotta get my wife to tell me how to incorporate malt powder because I loves me some malt waffles.

got a waffle iron at a garage sale and came here for recipes - this one is a winner!  Thanks to all the folks who posted the helpful hints (separating eggs, doubling sugar and vanilla, and waiting until the steam stops coming out of the sides of the iron before opening.  Oh yeah, also used buttermilk for half of the milk like one reviewer suggested.  Simple, delicious, uses ingredients already in the pantry - can't ask for much more in a recipe :-)

I made this recipe and the only thing I change is that instead of vegetal oil I use coconut oil these waffle taste much better like that love them, and my kids love them to with some whipping cream and strawberries on the top!!!!!

Great recipe.  I even made gluten-free by substituting equal parts of rice and oat flour.  More fragile and had. To be tipped out.

also thought  they were bitter adn mu kids didn't like them. They also burn easily, they tended to brown quickly on the outside but was "almost" not cooked on the inside. I would have given it less stars, but I felt that since I usually don't make our waffles, I might have done something wrong. For example, I didn't notice it said "mix just until smooth." I had super mixed it.

I think this recipe stands on it's own.  The only change I made was adding 1/8th of a cup of confectionery sugar because I ran out of granulated sugar. I had used a prepared waffle mix from the grocery store and ran out. In comparison there was none. This recipe was light, fluffy and tasted more like a waffle.

I use this recipe at least 2 times a month! The waffles turn out great when frozen too. Just cook them till about 60% cooked and remove from waffle iron, freeze in a ziplock bag and toast in the toaster when you want a quick breakfast.

This is an amazing recipe.  We don't eat waffles very often but when we do this is the one I make.  No more Krusteze or Bisquick for this family.  I am making this one today replacing the oil with softened butter for cinnamon roll pancakes.

I've made these several times, and I've always liked them, but my husband says they're too egg-y. After telling me that I tried to use one egg instead of two and he said they're still too egg-y.

Also, for those who say it's too much oil, try substituting it with butter. When making waffles, I have always used butter instead of oil because I like the butter flavor but it's impossible to spread it on waffles. :)

Have used this recipe again and again; the waffles always turn out perfectly - crispy, light and airy. Plus it keeps well so you don't have to use it all at once. This is a keeper.

My family agrees this is the best tasting, lightest Belgian waffle recipe I've tried.  Minimal prep time & kitchen mess. Only substitution was butter for vegetable oil.

Very good recipe.  I used melted butter instead of oil, doubled the vanilla, and added 1/4-1/2 cup more milk.  Beat the eggs several minutes, till pale yellow.  Beat all other ingredients in another bowl and then add the eggs.

I have made this recipe many times and I love it. I have read the bad reviews and they said that the "soda" made it salty. they had to have read the recipe wrong because it calls for baking powder. Give it another try. I also separate the eggs and beat the whites for a fluffy ending to a perfect waffle.

I'm not usually a waffle fan but others in my family are so I decided, hey its Christmas might as well get into the spirit! Anyway this recipe is amazing! The waffles came out light and perfectly crispy :) I added a pinch of cinnamon to mine but will definitely NOT be buying pancake mix again :)

Great recipe that I modified slightly based on some of the comments.  I reduced the amount of milk to 1 1/2 cup to thicken the batter and used coconut oil instead of vegetable for both health and a taste of Hawaii.  Enjoy!

I thought the 4 tsp measure for baking powder was a typo, but these are the lightest waffles I've ever made. I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and the vanilla to 1 TBSP. PERFECT.

I used white whole wheat flour, and followed other reviewers suggestions to whip the egg whites first, add additional vanilla and some cinnamon to the batter.  I also used 1/2 melted coconut oil and 1/2 vegetable oil.  My batter was a bit thick so I also added about 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce to thin it out a bit.  The waffles cooked great and were very tasty!  I am going to try to freeze them now to see how that works as well.

I did seperate the eggs.
The recipe was bland so I'll do it again with extra flavor.

Just made these and they turned out perfect! My hubby (who is a picky eater and hates trying new things) looked bummed when I said we were out of mix and I couldn't find my recipie so I was trying a new one ... I used my grandmother's trick of beating the eggs and milk until frothy, then added everything else plus a Tbl of cinnamon. Needless to say, two waffles and two thumbs up later, my hubby rates this 5 stars lol. I put the other half into a ziploc bag and put in the freezer as another suggested so I can just move it to the fridge the night before I want to use it to thaw. I'll be making this recipe again for sure! Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. It was pretty fluffy. My waffle maker is new, so it took a little bit of playing around to make them perfect, but they were very tasty. Next time I'll try playing around with the batter more and add various ingredients to make them my own.

I doubled the vanilla because, well, why not?

These were perfect.

I also made a healthier version for my toddler using the same guide, but with substitutions.  

I ground up 1 cup of oats into an oat flour, and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  And subbed the oil with applesauce.  And doubled the vanilla, again.    

They were AMAZING!  Everyone enjoyed that version too!

Love this recipe. Separate the egg whites from egg yolks.  Whip egg whites until stiff and fold in at the end.  I up the vanilla extract to over a teaspoon. Make a bunch, freeze it in tinfoil  and bake it up at 425 for a few minutes for quick and easy breakfast for the babies.

This was great!  I followed as is and came out perfect.  I think if you are making a bunch of substitutions then you may as well just write a new recipe and not rate it if you didn't follow it.  Sorry that was an old review, but wasn't helpful at all unless you were looking for a low cal recipe- in which case don't knock the recipe after you made a ton of changes to it.

Perfectly good, quick waffle recipe. Nice with coconut oil. Add salt even with salted butter. Could be improved by a little extra sugar. Do dry/wet ingredients separately.

I did as others said... Whipped the whites before adding yolks and the remaining ingredients, and added extra vanilla and brown sugar. The waffles were excellent and fluffy.

These were the first waffles I have ever made from scratch and I was very pleased with how they came out. My husband was also! I followed some of the helpful reviews and doubled the sugar and vanilla extract. I also added cinnamon (1/4 tsp). I can't imagine what they would have been like without doing that because although they were very good, they weren't very sweet; they were ALMOST bland. I also beat the egg whites separately, as recommended by some. They were fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Yum! (Not sure if that was due to the perfect timing of my waffle maker, though.) I would make these again.

Awesome recipe for waffles. Waffles are probably one of my favourite thing to eat. I have experimented with different measurements, but for the most part I have changed that much. The only thing I am having a problem with is the waffle maker.The waffles are crispy and soft, light and creamy. Just something I can't get enough of ...

I was looking for a recipe from scratch and come across this one.  I followed the advice of other reviews and I reduced the amount of oil down to a 1/3 cup and I added 1 packed tbsp. of brown sugar.  They turned out delicious!  Will be using this again soon!

This maes a great light and fluffy waffle, just crispy enough on the outside! I follow recipe other than I separate the eggs and whip the whites till fluffy with a mixer, then add them to the mixed ingredients. I do it all with my kitchenaid, not hand mixer like mentioned. Come out wonderfully every time!

I made this recipe for my niece one morning for breakfast, and she loved it!  I didn't have any eggs, so I used flax seed egg replacer (1 T ground flax seed + 3 T water for each egg being replaced) and coconut milk instead of dairy.  I also added the 1/2 t cinnamon and 1 t brown sugar as suggested by others.  She's a teenager, and while she's not super picky, I was a little unsure if she'd like them or not.  She scarfed several waffles down, and I plan to make more next time she spends the night!

This is a good base recipe, lots of wiggle room for ingredient swaps. I used 1 tablespoon brown sugar and 1/4 cup cinnamon sugar, a whole teaspoon vanilla, butter in place of the oil and half ap/half whole wheat flour. They were delicious. We topped with homemade strawberry compote and banana slices.

Easy. Tastes great. Substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil. It made about 6 waffles.

These are not good.  The baking powder gives a strong aftertaste.  I followed the directions and then tried the batter.  I added way more sugar and doubled the vanilla.  I also added a little cinnamon per other reviews.  The only thing that saved these waffles was syrup and powdered sugar…I won't use this recipe again.

my rating is based on the recipe as written. They came out perfect for a first time waffle maker. Kids love them. I like them very much I would like them to be extra extra sweet so that's why I don't love them. I don't rate on preference I rate the recipe as written, we all change a recipe to our preference so not fair to rate based on that. Recipe did take longer than 20 mins start to finish though. Overall 5 stars for me.

Amazingly good.  Normally, I do not like to leave reviews if I have modified the recipe, but in this case, my modifications were minimal.  I didn't have any milk so I used a mixture of half and half and soy milk to reach the 1 3/4 cups requirement.  I also added some chopped walnuts, fresh blueberries, a dash of nutmeg and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  These were by far the BEST waffles I have EVER had.  I wonder how anyone could leave a bad review for this recipe.

Oh boy! I've been looking for the perfect waffle recipe for weeks and this is it! I'm so happy with how it turned out: crispy and fluffy, the best texture, just the way I like it. This golden beauty is the best! I used my KitchenAid mixer and it worked perfectly! Thank you!

I followed the written recipe and I thought they turned out good. Not any better than I've had anywhere else, but good. My husband and kids loved them, so when I feel like spending an hour cleaning a stupid waffle maker, I'll make this recipe again. :) Thank you!

Best waffle recipe ever! Great flavor, slightly crispy outside and light and fluffy inside. I  just put all ingredients in bowl at one time and used a whisk to combine. So simple.  Will  never buy box mix again!

I think made these wrong so they turned out just ok. I separated the eggs and whipped the whites and added that to the mixed batter as some suggested but other then that changed nothing. The waffle turned out tasting like pure baking soda. If anyone has any ideas why that happen please post!

I added cinnamon and a little brown sugar and I also had to add an extra cup of flour to make the desired thickness. These were about the best waffle I've ever made.

These waffled were delicious.  Nice and crispy on the out side and fluffy on the inside.  I topped these with Blueberry Sauce by Isybel.  Everything was perfect!

It's one of the best waffles recipes ! It's so easy to make and so delicious ! You can make the batter today and make the waffles the day after ( that's what i did ) and someone said it could stay a week in the fridge you just have to whisk it before pouring it , that's what i did and it was so delicious

I really enjoyed these waffles. I think those that had issues with the waffles being soggy didn't have their waffle iron on a hot enough setting. If your waffle iron is set on low, this recipe yields waffles that are soft like pancakes. Set the waffle iron a little hotter and you'll get that lovely crisp outside, soft inside that you're aiming for. 

I made the recipe as written originally. Had I not used vanilla almond milk and extra vanilla, I think they would have been a bit too bland. After the first batch, I mixed in extra sugar and some cinnamon and they were divine. 

I agree with those posters who say that 4 tbsp of baking powder is unnecessary. I really believe you could get by just fine with two. If you don't add extra sugar and seasoning, you can taste a hint of the baking powder--and you don't want that. I like this recipe and will be keeping it. This works great with almond milk!

These were really good, but I still feel like they were missing a little something. They were kind of bland and not very fluffy, but definitely moist and still got devoured in this house! Maybe I'll try some of the reviewers suggestions to amp this up a bit. It doesn't need much, still a good solid 4 star recipe.

GREATEST WAFFLES OF ALL TIME! So crunchy on the outside and perfect in the middle. I added a Tablespoon of flax seed for health and my picky kids devoured these. Thanks for the best waffles recipe ever!

I just used the dry portion and put it in my store bought brand name (mark it with a 'b') box and used their recipe.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Added about 1/2t of vanilla.  Perfect.  Good mix!

loved this recipe! It was very easy to put together, and the waffles were delicious. I added a little more milk ( I had adjusted the  original recipe down) but no other tweaks were needed.
 I Allso add either ground flaxseed or wheat germ  (whichever I have on hand) to add a little more fiber.

I LOVE waffles.  don't eat them alot, but when I do, I want a good one. I normally purchase the Krusteaz Box brand, they are good, but this morning got up, wanted a waffle, didn't have a mix anywhere. So I thought I would look on line to make them home made, knew ALLRECIPES would probably have a good one, & man was I right.  These are the BEST waffles i've ever had. I'll never use the box mix again, these were simple to make & probably more cost effective too.  Thanks for whoever added this recipe to the allrecipes site.  Great Job.....

Great recipe!I love the mix but if you don't have a waffle pan that can lead you to disaster.I tried 2 times but it always comes out crumbled. You MUST need a WAFFLE PAN!Or else a  recipie for disaster.

My kiddos loved this recipe.  I initially made the recipe exactly as written which earned it 4 stars.  I deducted a star because it needed a bit more depth of flavor.  Now, this has become my staple recipe for waffles with the addition of a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and by beating the egg whites separately.  Great treat for my family!

Made these last night for dinner and they were perfect. The only change that I did make was using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Other than that nothing else. They were so light and crispy. I got about 16 waffles out of original recipe(four at a time waffle maker. They tasted so much better than the ones made from bisquick mix. And so quick to whip up. Thanks.

Excellent! My search for a waffle recipe ends here. I used 1/2 all purpose flour & 1/2 white wheat to make them healthier but still appealing to my kids. I also added the 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp brown sugar that others suggested. Next time I might slip in some wheat bran or flax meal or even some ground walnuts for some extra nutrition.

Easy and Delicious!    Spread with maple butter, strawberries, and sprinkle with icing sugar.   A 5-star dessert!   Recipe can be easily halved if only needing a few waffles.

This is a good recipe, giving nice waffles with a good texture. They're not as flavorful as waffles made with buttermilk / sour milk. I've made it several times. The recipe as written is a bit over-complicated, with the beating of the eggs, etc.  As an experiment, I didn't beat the eggs using a mixer.  I broke up the eggs using a fork, then added the milk and oil, then combined the liquid mixture to the dry mixture with a wire wisk.  No difference in the texture that I could detect.

So easy and basic yet using butter instead of oil, double the vanilla, using cream and coconut milk,add apple and apricot sauce mixture and it was still light and fluffy. A real winner for my family.

tried this as is. I was looking for a waffle mix not a glorified pancake mix and this is it! I like mine a little sweeter so next time I will double the sugar and make the mix a little thinner. over all though you cant go wrong with this mix. thanks for sharing. as a side note this mix can double as a hot cake mix would be perfect!

This was my first time making waffles as we just purchased our first Belgian waffle maker.oh my goodness this recipe was so easy and so very very delicious! We paired it with fried chicken wings for our friends anniversary dinner. So so good. My little one is eating her second waffle for today. ????

I will never buy a mix again.  These waffles were crisp on the outside, light on the inside, and (most importantly) crazy easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly and got great results.  If you make a large batch, you can freeze the leftover waffles and toast them the next morning.

Unless you add lots of batter to the waffle maker, waffles do not turn out fluffy; they're flat simply because the recipe doesn't have a lot of baking powder (unlike similar recipes).  Once you get used to this recipe, it's okay, but there's still a slight problem with the waffles sticking to the waffle maker. Also, the problem of lumps forming in batter is probably caused by adding flour and baking powder after liquids. Taste of the thicker waffles was fine, so I'm glad I gave this recipe a second chance :-)

Great waffles.  Turned out golden brown & delicious.  We use Cup for Cup gluten free AP flour and with with the addition of 1/8 - 1/4 cup of milk it turned out just fine.  Tastes fantastic too (really, you can't tell the difference with this particular product.)
Enjoy!!!

I made this recipe last night and we loved it. I did separate the whites and yolk and beat the whites to stiff peaks and then folded in. I also added lots of extra vanilla. I made a blueberry lemon compote and buttery maple syrup to go with. Delicious!

Updated this review to 5 stars after trying another waffle recipe and remembering how good this one is.  Very good waffles.  They took a while to crisp up on our waffle iron but it is a solid recipe.  The waffles freeze very well and toast right back up in the toaster oven.

Separating the eggs is a must.  I also added cinnamon as suggested by others. Yummy.  I didn't have milk, but I had buttermilk. I prefer butter to veg oil so I substituted.  I had to cook them a bit longer as they were a little soggy.  Next time adding another egg will probably help as the batter was a bit thick, which is probably why it took longer to cook them to perfection.  But the flavour was well worth it.  I also add 4 tablespoons of sugar since my little one doesn't like maple syrup, but likes them sweet.  These are NOT diet friendly.  A once in a while treat for sure.  Wear your maternity pants because you will want to indulge.

Delicious! Lightly crisp on outside and airy on inside with delicate flavor. So easy to throw together with basic ingredients that are in everyone's pantry/fridge. We doubled the vanilla in the batter.  Served ours with softened salted butter that melted and pooled into the crevices, real maple syrup and whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon on top.

I received a waffle iron as a gift from my company.  My daughters were anxious to try it out.  We landed on this recipe and the whole experience was great.  The recipe was simple and easy.  I called out the instructions to my 10 year old and she made the batter.  The waffles came out light, fluffy, and delicious.  After reading the reviews and seeing how to make them healthy my mind is full of ideas for different flavors.

This is my new go to waffle recipe. Per some of the suggestions I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon brown sugar. I'm also going to try it with a dash of nutmeg and maybe throw in some malt powder.

Okay, so I already loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to add 1/4 cup of sugar because I like my waffles sweet.  Add however much or little as you want, your recipe.  HOWEVER, I have been experimenting with gluten free recipes using pamela's artisan all purpose flour and I have been seriously disappointed in my substitutions the few times I have tried.  That being said, I LOVED these waffles gluten free. I might even like them better gluten free then with all purpose flour.  Holy Cow they are good.  I don't know how to describe it but the texture is wicked delicious and the flavor was sure tasty.  For any of you gluten free-ers, give it ago.  I did a one for one substitution.  Most Excellent!

This recipe is awesome. Very light and fluffy. I will never use a boxed mix again! I have a non-stick waffle iron so I cut back on the oil. I used only 1/4 cup. They did not stick at all. They did however ooze out of the iron, I guess because of the liquid or the baking powder. I also made a batch with half of the salt and I will freeze them for my Mom who is on a sodium restricted diet. A quarter of a teaspoon of salt divided between 9 large waffles can't be too high in sodium. Everyone liked them even my fussy husband kept saying how much better these tasted. If he only knew how easy it was to make waffles from scratch he would want them all of the time.

I have tried this recipe multiple times and have found it to be a great recipe. I follow the recipe exactly with no alterations and its always fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Great for doubling the recipe and freezing the leftovers to toast on a busy morning. I freeze two dozen at a time for an easy breakfast for my toddler and me and I have never been disappointed, they keep very well. Also, to some of the reviews who complained of soggy waffles, it may just be the waffle iron itself, the oil in this recipe calls for a high cook temperature, maybe switch out the oil for butter or margarine instead? Just a suggestion. Definitely will recommend this recipe.

This is a good base recipe, but I needed to doctor it up a bit to suit our tastes.  While I may keep looking for a different recipe, if you aren't afraid to try adjusting the ingredients I think this could be a wonderful recipe.

We love these waffles! I did half white flour and half whote wheat flour. I doubled the sugar and vanilla as a couple commenters suggested. I also threw in a dash of cinnamon for a little extra flavor. These waffles are light and fluffy! They turned out even better the next day,  after the batter took a rest in the fridge for the night.

These were really good!  I used coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil because I'm trying to go "healthier", but other than that, no changes.  Will definitely be a regular in this house!  Thanks for sharing!

I've tried this recipe three times now, and it's great! 1st time, the only change was adding cinnamon & doubling the vanilla. The 2nd time, I substituted 1 cup wheat flour & 1 cup flax seed for the white flour (& still added cinnamon & vanilla) - awesome & healthier!! Today, I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar, just used white flour, added the cinnamon & vanilla, and HAD to use 1/2 Olive oil because I ran out of veg oil, and it was still awesome! Also, ran out of syrup, so had to use agave syrup, which was healthier anyway!  :)

Great recipe made some substitutions and they were absolutely Delish!  I used self rising all purpose flour so no need for baking powder and I used almond instead of vanilla and added cinnamon.  We reheated the leftover KFC had the best chicken and waffles ever! Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe several times.  It is a nice basic recipe.  I believe I change it all the time....I usually use 2 c worth of powdered milk, Brown sugar instead of white, applesauce with a touch of oil.  Then for the flour I use 1 c white whole wheat, 1/2 c old fashioned oats and 1/2 c of flax seed.  Yummy any way you make it.

I like this recipe. I have tried others, but this was easy and has nice flavors. I did make minor changes. I used half melted butter, half olive oil. I used one cup heavy cream and the rest milk. I boosted the vanilla, and added a handful of fine ground white corn meal. The flavors were wonderful, and the texture was very good. Had left over batter, so I made the rest and put them in the freezer. I will be using this recipe often.

Oh a whim(and because my wife had a sudden urge for waffles) I looked up waffle recipes online. This was the first one I came across. I mixed all the items together and made my waffles. They come out fluffy. I, myself, like the nice, fluffy waffles. My wife absolutely loved them. Great recipe!!

Great recipe!  I also made some healthy substitutions and used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I added some wheat germ also.  I was going to use applesauce instead of the oil, and I completely forgot.  So, it seemed fine even without the oil and applesauce.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and added about 1 tsp of cinnamon.  The kids loved them!

I usually order waffles only from a great restaurant. but bought a waffle maker and needed a great recipe. I found one in this. I made it exactly as stated which is not normal for me. It was much better than any restaurant I have ever eaten at. However, now that I know how good a waffle can taste, I will start adding ingredients I would like.

I think it is Delicious. If you try this recipe add more eggs if you like them fluffier. They're the Best.

This recipe left a lot to be desired as far as flavor. Texture was fine light and crispy but that's all it had going for it.

Love these! I make them multi-grain by using s mix of flours: 11/4 cups all-purpose, 1/2 cup while-wheat, and 1/4 cup spelt flour. I whip the eggs in the blender first, and then add everything else and blend some more. Mmm!

The consistency of the batter was fine - even a little thick - not runny and thin as other users have indicated - but there was absolutely zero flavor.  None.  Butter didn't help.

I use whole wheat flour for all of my baking and have gotten used to the density, but these were fluffy and amazing! I was out of vanilla extract, so I used orange extract. Really good also!

These turned out great.  I subbed white whole wheat flour and buttermilk in their respective places and separated the eggs in order to beat the whites.  Super great!

I upped my prior 4-star rating to 5-stars after adding 1/2 t cinnamon and 1 t brown sugar as another reviewer suggested!  I also beat the egg whites separately and folded them in last.  This will be my go-to waffle recipe from now on.

This was good but I felt like it needed more...so the 2nd time I made it I added 2 tbs of brown sugar and maybe a tsp of cinnamon then followed the instructions to seperate the yolk and beat the whites til fluffy then I folded them into the batter.  These ended up being fabulous and with all the extras I froze them which kept perfectly.  Just pop into the toaster...yummy!

Delicious, quick and easy.  I didn't have eggs so I used egg substitute.  I doubled the sugar after making the first round of waffles, but they were light and fluffy and a big hit with my husband and three toddlers!  Will make this my go-to waffle recipe!

I made this recipe as is and althought the texture was perfect, it lacked some flavor. Next time I will add more vanilla extract, sugar, and some cinnamon. A good "plain jane" recipe.

This recipe is excellent.  The ONLY changes I made were to add a bit more sugar and I used 2% milk.  I eyeballed the amount in regards to the sugar.  If I had to guess I'd say maybe a couple of tablespoons.  Perfect with or without syrup!  I am not buying frozen waffles or pancake mix ever again :)

After finding out we had no frozen waffles in the freezer or premixed packages in the pantry, I searched for an easy recipe to make them homemade. It was so easy and tasted better than frozen, or any of the premixed packages we've tried before.  I will definitely be making these again soon. Happy New Year 2014!

My go-to recipe for waffles.  The are very light and fluffy. I always add more vanilla,because they are a little bland for my taste.  I also add a touch of cinnamon or nut meg for Christmas...for egg nog waffles.  We had guest for New Years and this was the perfect thing.  It got rave reviews so I thought I'd officially  make a review of my own.

Went to make waffles one day and didn't have any boxed mix. Found this recipe and will be making it from now on instead of buying it. It just tastes so much better. My husband requested a little more vanilla, so now I make them with 3/4 tsp. of vanilla instead of the 1/2 tsp.

I was attracted to this waffle recipe because it didn't require separating eggs.  Unfortunately, they had no flavor.  I have to admit that I used part whole wheat flour.  I may try them again, using all white flour and more salt.

Love the recipe. I took other reviewers recommendation and folded in the fluffed egg whites at the end. Very tasty waffles. Better than a box recipe!

Waffles were crispy and light. Very easy to make! I'm never buying a box waffle mix again after trying this one.

1st time I made it withthe whole wheat flour, cooked up great, but I hate eating healthy 2nd time made it evil... Needs a little more sugar and salt (to bring out the sweetness) I am going to try cinniman and nutmeg next. Maybe blueberries. I a Dad, and I need wonderful recipes like this thanks.

We didn't like it at all. I followed the directions to a T and the waffles were super thick and dense, not fluffy and light at a all. They also really had no taste at all. Will not make again.

nom nom nom  can't talk mouth is full.....  

In other words I loved this recipe!  it was so easy to make, I had all the ingredients on hand and the recipe can be easily adapted - add pumpkin pie & spices + a bit more flour for pumpkin spice waffles

I have added this recipe to my do again pile

These also froze really well

GREAT Recipe! I tweaked it by substituting milk with buttermilk and adding 1 cup of water to thin it out a bit. I also added some milk chocolate chips for the chocolate lover in me! Good job on this! Thank you very much for posting!

This makes GREAT waffles! This was fast and super easy, I whipped them up as directed with one change used 1/2c butter instead of oil. It makes exactly 5 waffles, one for the hubby, one for each of the kiddos and one for the dogs :).

Very tasty once I got the recipe right.  You should look out for the least culinary experienced among us though.  You should list the ingredients in the order they are to be incorporated lest someone like --my friend (yeah, that's the ticket)-- makes the mistake of trying to mix 2 cups of flour into the beaten eggs with his Kitchen Aid.

I just purchased my first waffle maker and I was So Excited to try this recipe!I had really high hopes for these waffles with all the great reviews! but I certainly was not all that impressed!I thought they lacked in flavor Were Not as light and fluffy as I expected! I even beat my egg whites seperately I cant say they were horrible just not as good as I hoped! I think i will keep looking for a different recipe!!

I've made this recipe 3 times now and feel I didn't get it just right until the 3rd try. First time following Tevans211 suggestions to make it healthier (minus the splenda b/c didn't have) - and if you're not a cinnamon lover then I recommend omitting. Tevans211 suggestions for a healthier was exactly that...heathier and tasted as such; which is great just didn't do justice for me. I really wanted to fulfill my taste buds of eating waffles when I was a kid. Round 2 I tried to be healthy by using apple sauce but by round 3 I followed the recipe exactly (I did't follow any reviews alterations) and it was just what I was looking for. I put peanut butter and the syrup and it was perfect! Thanks Tevans211 for suggesting to put leftovers in the freezer - delicious!

Very good recipe but I did find it a little heavy. Instead, I separated the eggs and only added the egg yolks. I beat the egg whites until fluffy and folded them in at the end. I also added a 1/2 tsp Almond extract. ;) Very yummy with bananas, strawberries and whipped cream!

I doubled the recipe and the only alterations I used were subbed the oil for apple sauce..the batter was water but I did a test run and it was a sloppy mess to no prevail ended up adding two more cups of flour and a another teaspoon of powder and then it was waffle batter that cooked correctly.. I am so sorry but I have to give one star as the original recipe was not edible.. the only other thing I can think of that may have had an effect would be we use fresh milk (we live on a farm) and eggs..sooo our eggs are much larger.

Tasty!  Everybody loved this.  I made a few changes including using half whole wheat flour and half white, doubling the vanilla and sugar and substituting melted butter for the oil and a bit of cinnamon.  The full recipe made only 5 waffles and the batter didn't really pour...I had to spread it on the waffle iron with a spatula.  I think I would double the ingredients next time because I think these waffles would freeze and keep well.

Really good basic waffle recipe. I don't like really sweet things, especially for breakfast, so I only added a few drops of pure vanilla extract and I thought the 1T. of sugar was perfect. I have batter leftover, so tomorrow I'll try them with blueberries!

These were amazing. I did add maybe an extra tablespoon of sugar and a whole teaspoon of vanilla. These had to be the best waffles I ever made with those simple changes

Delicious waffle recipe!  Followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the vanilla and added cinnamon.  Light & fluffy and WAY better than box mix.

I love this waffle recipe! We make them almost every weekend. I also doubled the sugar and vanilla, but I add cinnamon to. All around my kids love them and eat them dry as a snack also. Thank you for the amazing recipe!

These waffles come out beautiful to look at, but are DRY and TASTELESS. They should give the Sahara Desert a lesson in dryness, like . Sure they were fluffy, but you couldn't swallow them because THEY WERE SO FREAKING DRY.

I've made these a few times now and they are so good that I'm letting go of all my other recipes - including my copy cat waffle house recipe!  These really are the best. Crunchy exterior and light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. SO good!

This was my first time making waffles and these were great. Mine only yielded 5 but that was enough. For those having a soggy effect, I read somewhere (probably here) after taking out of the waffle iron DON'T stack them but place on a paper towel then on a cookie sheet if keeping warm in the oven. We had ours with ice cream, oooohh what a treat.

Very easy, light flavor. My waffle iron is a hand-me down and I've never used it before today, so it'll take some experimenting to figure out how much batter to use, but this recipe is a great start. I like that the batter can store in the fridge: I'll probably make it ahead of time so I can have waffles in the mornings.

Great waffle recipe, but you need to eat them directly after the come out of the waffle iron, otherwise they don't stay crispy and get soft. 5 stars for fresh from the iron waffles, 3 stars for leftovers.

I make these waffles for my family, and my kids say I "make the best waffles in the world!". I also tweak the recipe just a little bit. I change the number of servings from 6 to 4, but still use 2 eggs. I stumbled upon this by accident when I followed the directions exactly, but used jumbo eggs instead of regular ones. The extra egg makes the waffles incredibly light and airy. The texture is less like a pancake and more like a cruller. You can't stop eating them.

Rating this 4 stars instead of 5 because I did follow other reviewers' advice to increase the sugar and vanilla, as well as add cinnamon.  With these additions, these waffles were fabulous!  The texture was perfect and the flavor was excellent.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested waiting until the steam stops trailing out of the sides of the waffle maker -- perfect waffles every time with this tip.

I made this recipe as written and I'm sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed.  I have been making my waffles using a hungry jack mix and I didn't think this recipe was any better.  If you are looking for a healthier and probably cheaper version of a box mix, this will work for you.  If you are looking for exceptional waffles, you will need to either tweak this recipe or look elsewhere.

I was soooo tired of my waffles being spongy, and this recipe was just what I was looking for. Easy, crispy, lots of flavor. I separated the egg whites and folded them into the batter before pouring them into my waffle iron--EXCELLENT.

This was a fantastic and quick, easy waffle recipe!   it made 4 full and 2 smaller Belgian waffles.  I followed the recipe pretty much except added 1 1/2 t Lemon juice to the milk.  Added only 1/4 cup oil.  Added 1/4 cup splenda instead of real sugar.  A good couple shakes of cinnamon. I also beat the eggs to give them some fluffiness. Poured short of 1 cup in the belgian waffle maker. kept warm in oven til ready!   So YUMMY!

These are the best homemade waffles. I didn't change anything. I love the fact that you can make ahead and store in the refrigerator. I always whip up a batch at home and then pack in the ice chest for camping. In the morning just have to plug in the waffle maker in the R.V. and my batter is already made. LOVE IT!

These waffles are truly delightful! They get nice and crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. They aren't particularly flavourful on their own but the recipe can easily be used with some small alterations to add a whole lot of flavour. I love them!

Best Waffles Ever! I've tried several from this site and this is the best, hands down. Crispy, great texture, and full of flavor. Made them in the blender, nothing could be easier. I cut back the oil a bit and added a little more sugar based on other reviews but that was it. My son ate 4 - FOUR - full sized waffles! I'll be making these again, no doubt!

I recently bought myself a waffle maker and was searching for an easy recipe.  I was very pleased with how the waffles turned out. They were light and crispy on the outside. They smell heavenly with the addition of the vanilla.  Next time I think I'll add a bit more sugar as I like the taste of a sweeter waffle since I don't use any syrup.  Served with strawberries and icing sugar, they are quite a show stopper on the breakfast table!

OMG I loved this recipe.  It smells amazing while it cooks and the batter is a thick gorgeous mixture.  I did use self rising flour and omitted salt and baking soda because I was using up ingredients in my pantry.  I have been searching for a delicious waffle recipe so that I can use my mother's now nearly 60 year old waffle iron (yep, it still works and looks like it did the day she bought it...she always took such great care of her stuff!).  This recipe ROCKS!

Great, basic, easy waffle recipe.  Will definitely make again.  I'm not a big waffle eater, but all 4 of my kids loved them.  I only had one egg, and I added a little apple sauce.  Turned out very good.  Needed to stay on the iron for about 3 1/2 minutes.

Made for family today and my boys and husband loved them. Crispy on the outside, soft and light in the middle.  Followed the recipe for the most part. Used brown sugar instead of white and also added a little cinnamon.  I doubled the recipe and have plenty left over to freeze and pop in the toaster.

Kids loved them! Said they were the best waffles ever! Note: batter is very thin and u need to use more than you think to get the waffle to fill the top of the waffle.

Best waffles I've ever made. I did as others recommended - doubling sugar and vanilla extract, and beating egg whites separately then folding in at end. These waffles were very light and delicious.

I doubled this recipe and added about an extra tsp. of baking powder, a couple tbl. brown sugar, and a little cloves and cinnamon. I made these for supper for the family with smoked sausage on the side. A couple of us like them a little crispier so we put in the toaster for just a little bit after taking them off the waffle iron. They puffed up nicely. Good recipe!

This is a good recipe, but after adding things I couldn't give it a 5 star. As suggested, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2-3 teaspoons of cinnamon. I used cup of buttermilk and 3/4 cup of regular milk. I made the buttermilk, I also separated the egg yolks from the white and with the egg white I mixed them with the blender until they formed peaks ( You can also add the sugar to the egg white instead of the batter in order to make them fluffier, I haven't tried the recipe that way yet)and I added the egg yolk to the liquid batter and folded in the egg whites with a spatula at the end. I didn't need to spray my waffle iron, when I spray the iron the they don't brown that well. They were crispier too. Next time, I will try a dash of nutmeg as suggested.  I also added a 2 tablespoons oil and and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to add to the crispy texture. Delicious!

Very easy and very tasty, will make these again for sure.  For my waffle iron it made 5 large waffles.  My 4 and 6 year old could only eat 1/2 a waffle.  Next time I will make some of the substitutions that others recommended to lighten the calorie content a bit.

I made this recipe exactly as it says and these were the most delicious waffles we've ever had in our home.  I have a mini-waffle maker (3 at a time) and they came out perfect!  Not too dense.  Delicious and very slightly crispy on the outside.

This is a great go to recipe for waffles.  I didn't have enough white flour so I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I also used 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of oil.  We have the Belgium waffle style Cuisine Art and they came out the best at it's highest setting, 6.

Like most other reviewers said a little bland, I added a half tsp of cinnamon and still it was just a basic waffle. That being said I used whole wheat and they still came out fine (probably thanx to the baking powder). A good recipe, but I'll still be looking for others. (but hee, that's just taste, isn't it?)

I love this recipe, as do my children. I swapped out the flour for GF flour, we also use soy milk instead of cow milk, and add chocolate chips. I had a friend say they were the best waffles she'd ever had! I make them once or twice a week and freeze leftovers, pop them in the toaster and my toddler has an easy breakfast all week.

These are THE BEST waffles I have ever had, period.  This is the perfect recipe for my Oster CKSTWFBF21 Belgian waffle maker.  Crisp on the outside, and light and fluffy in the center.

These were excellent waffles, we made them on a whim this evening for desseert. I did add a dash more sugar and an extra capful of vanilla as others suggested, and they came out amazing. Everyone loved them, I put the extra batter in the fridge for the morning and its a test of willpower to keep from going in to make more! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I've been looking for a waffle recipe that didn't involve yeast or folding egg whites.  I've made many with the egg whites and to me, they tasted like angel food cake.  These waffles were perfect for our tastes.  Easy to make, cooked perfectly in a Belgian waffle maker and super yummy.  This one's a keeper.

I would add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to the mix, and use whole grain to make them stand up more. The batter was a tad runny, which produced flimsy waffles. I also added an extra 2 tsp of baking powder to help them rise a bit more and they ended up perfect:)

This recipe has so much oil that for once my waffles didn't stick to the iron. I substituted vegetable oil for olive oil, regular flour for whole wheat, and skipped the sugar altogether to make them slightly healthier. It's a simple recipe that tastes great.

We love this recipe!! Waffles come out crisp and still soft on the inside, and not dried out like so many other waffles. I am by no means a great cook in the kitchen, and for some strange reason it seems to be my job to do breakfast. I love making waffles but before this recipe they always just came out so dry. This recipe changed that and my family asks for this constantly.

This recipe has a lot of oil compared to some of the other waffle recipes I have used. I could taste the oily after taste on them. Some of the recommendations in the comments below may be something to look into.

So glad I found this waffle recipe!!  Just because I needed to use it up, I added 1 cup buttermilk & just 1 cup regular milk instead of the 1 3/4 cup of milk the recipe calls for. Substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  Haven't tried adding more sugar or vanilla as other posts have suggested, maybe next time.   Otherwise, I didn't tweak the recipe & received NO complaints from 4 extremely picky boys :)
Best suggestions I have are to make sure your waffle iron is really hot (so they'll come out crispy) and make sure your waffle iron is greased well, even between batches (I used Bakers Joy brand spray).   I mixed my "wet" ingredients in my Kitchen Aid on stir speed while I prepared all the "dry" ingredients in a separate bowl & then added gradually to the wet mix & blended all for about 1 minute on speed 2. 
Great recipe - will use it every week!

Overall, a very good recipe that yields light and crispy waffles, but it needs some extra oomph. I make these waffles and freeze them for my husband who gets up for work at 430 every morning (they freeze beautifully, for the record). We don't use much syrup, so we prefer our waffles on the sweeter side. I doubled the sugar (but used xylitol instead) and added more vanilla. Even so, my husband still did not find them sweet enough. Easy enough to fix. I also used white whole wheat flour and found that I needed to add just a little smidgen of extra milk to get the batter to a good consistency.

I had never made waffles from scratch, but this was really easy and quick. It was fluffy and they came out looking beautiful. I made 1/2 the recipe (3 servings). The only thing it tasted a bit egg-y. Should I put less than 1 egg? Should I beat it less? Not sure how to adjust recipe correctly. Thank you for anyone's suggestions!

I used whole wheat, brown sugar instead of white and doubled the vanilla and these waffles were amazing! I even tried the feature of putting the leftover batter in the fridge and got the same perfect results the next day!

By far the best waffle recipe I've ever made!  Not too rich and the vanilla adds a really nice flavor.  I substituted the white flour for whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier and they still tasted amazing!  Totally recommend this recipe!

I don't usually like homemade batters for their promo ate "egg" taste and lack of fluffiness.  I found nothing like that with this recipe.  These were great!  Fluffed up nicely, we're crispy, and tasted great.  I made a double batch and used half melted butter and half vegetable oil.

These waffles were great!  I am sure they would have been even better had I remembered the tablespoon of sugar.  Even with that mistake the waffles were pretty tasty.

Fast...and very very good!  The only thing I changed was adding Mexican vanilla in place of the reg. vanilla.  YUM O!!  I do like the idea of swapping out the  oil for applesauce or yogurt.

These were ok. Made these as directed, thought they were a little dry and not much taste. My husband thought they were cake like. I decided to topped them with fresh mixed berries and pure maple syrup. The dish as a whole was yummy but I'll use a different waffle recipe next time.

Made it for New Year's breakfast - to break in my new waffle maker - and found the waffles didn't have a lot of flavor by themselves. I think next time, if I use this recipe, I'll tweak it a bit to see if I can add more flavor to it. Otherwise it worked well.

Modified the recipe according to reviewer suggestions, extra sugar, separating eggs, adding cinnamon.  These waffles were so light and fluffy!  The whole family enjoyed them.

A practical recipe that produces a good tasting waffle that can solve the problem of whats for breakfast-INSTANTLY!~! Whether you are a single person or a large family having this batter mixed and ready to use is great.
This recipe makes it easy to have a fresh hot waffle whenever you want. Good taste and texture.  I believe that the batter is actually better days after you mix it-just stir it up and pour!

I've made this recipe twice and it is the one for me! Made for family brunch and everyone loved them. Made it as written with the exception of adding more sugar and 2tbsp of cinnamon.  My son added chocolate chips to his while on waffle iron.  The waffle are crispy on the outside, but soft and light on the inside.  No more boxed mix for us!! Thanks for sharing...

Absolutely the best waffle recipe ever!  I froze the leftovers and they were just as good as the fresh ones. I popped the in the toaster on setting four.

These were really good. I used whole wheat pastry flour and I was out of vanilla but they still came out delicious. I also never use vegetable oil but used coconut oil instead and added some cinnamon. These made about 12 regular sized waffles in a two-sided waffle iron. I froze the remaining ones and they taste great after going in the toaster. I plan to make another batch this weekend!

Simple, yummy, kids and adults approved. Also easy to add little extras to, like, nuts, fruit, even chocolate chips.

Best waffles, ever! my kid constantly begs for these. One tip...separate eggs and beat whites until foamy for fluffier waffles! Also, I up the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and sub Splenda for sugar.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it!!! I ended up making about 10 waffles, we ate 3 of them for dessert (yes, dessert, not breakfast lol) and then froze the rest. He said he will never buy frozen waffles again. Next time, we'll try them with whole wheat flour. I also added about a tsp of vanilla, and a tsp of cinnamon, as we like it on the sweet sie. Thanks for sharing!

I rated this recipe a four because I did make some changes. I doubled the sugar and vanilla , I feel if I didn't do this they would have been bland. I also added a tsp of cinnamon. With the changes this recipe is. definitely five stars

Love this recipe! Made it a few days ago--followed reviewers suggestions --1/4 c. melted butter instead of oil, 2 T sugar. We didn't use all of the batter initially so I put it in the fridge and used the rest this morning. Just as good as when first made!! So easy. Will definitely make again.

I make these all of the time for my picky one year old. I use King Arthur unbleached cake flour and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also add chopped apples to the batter. My daughter LOVES them! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe.

The waffle was nice and fluffy, but so very bland. My kids enjoyed it, but if I made it again, I'd use melted better instead of oil or increase the salt or something.

So yummy!  I mixed all of the dry ingredients thoroughly in a bowl then put all the liquid ingredients in a blender for about 60 seconds.  I mixed wet and dry ingredients in the bowl just until blended together.  SUBSTITUTIONS: Used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, almond milk, and organic white whole wheat flour for extra nutrition.  Kept measurements the same.  Did not need non-stick cooking spray.  It did not stick at all, but then again that depends on your waffle iron.  Baked them all at once to freeze.

Awesome recipe! Easy and delicious every time. I've made one little tweak but only for personal preference and that was to substitute unsalted butter for oil.

These are the first waffles I have ever made and they were fantastic! Super easy, fluffy and delicious. I took note of some of the comments and also doubled the sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Got raves from hubby and teenage boys...thanks for a super recipe!

Used 1 C regular flour and 1 C whole wheat, replaced oil with apple sauce and added a little cinnamon.  HUGE hit with the family, and a really quick breakfast!  Excellent!

Made these for the second time.  Had some fresh raspberry preserves on hand, along with some chocolate chips, so added them to the basic recipe.  SOOOOO delicious!  Eat with some whipped cream!  YUMMY!

Love these- and we have tried lots of recipes.  Made the recipe as is...and we really enjoyed them in our belgium waffle iron- they got really soft after they sat for awhile...but stayed in the fridge a few days and then toasted really nicely.

okay, I just bought a waffle iron  at Walmart. 
My first time making waffles was with store bought waffle mix. Ugh.. terrible, very heavy, bread like. 
So.. i found this recipe, my son actually wanted waffles this morning - and suggested that i make them from scratch. I made this recipe following others instructions in regard to folding in egg whites last, also doubled up on sugar & vanilla. I also added cinnamon as some suggested. My son & I loved it, he ate almost 2, he was full. The waffle was light and fluffy with a light crispy outside, and lightly sweetened. Just wonderful. yeah!

Quick, easy and doesn't stick.  Fluffy enough.  Just need 1 ladle full for 1 belgian waffle.  It looks thin, but expands to fill the chamber.

Pretty yummy! We only have 2% milk in our house so to make it a little richer, I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 heaping tablespoon of sour cream & 1 tablespoon melted butter. Was a little worried I was going too far off the reservation with the sour cream but it was awesome! The finished product was a little moist inside and had a super RICH flavor.  I also followed some of the other posters and doubled the sugar and vanilla extract. Totally yummy and the only batter I'll use for waffles from now on!

First of all this was my first attempt at making waffles, and let's just say these were the easiest and simplest yet tastiest waffles ever. The waffles were cooked on a waffle iron using a pam spray. I made them exact up until using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also let my 9 year old son and nephew assist  in  adding and mixing the ingredients.  I just read the list and gave them the utensils to make it happen. Let's just say perfection! This was so easy and took all of 5-10 minutes to make because the boys were distracted between cheering on my oldest son while he was playing xbox yet still made golden brown waffles like pros. So simply put you, can't jack up this recipe!

This is really easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I actually prefer this to the one made with yeast.  The waffles turned out crispy on the outside and light on the inside. Definately a keeper!

Really great recipe. Everyone in the family loves them and we keep some made in the fridge for the kids. I did change a few things: I use real butter instead of the oil, half whole wheat flour, add a scoop of whey protein, and only 3 tsp of baking powder.

Best I have ever had and I have been eating and making waffles for years.  Just follow the directions and be sure you preheat till hot! Takes about 7 min. on my Krup waffle iron.  Patti

This was a good basic waffle recipe. I did add a touch more sugar and vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe. I doubled the recipe to give us some leftovers for tomorrow (for family of 5)! :) Also made again with 1/3 wheat flour and the rest white. Would do that again too.

Very fluffy waffles, easy to make.

I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Didn't help much. These are rather bland and tasted slightly of baking soda.

Next time I will add an extra teaspoon of sugar, maybe see what happens when I subtract some baking soda.

Overall these were very easy to make and with a few adjustments I think they will be perfect!

Perfect--Crispy/light/fluffy all in one! I added cinnamon and cardamom--two of my favorite spices I add to my pancakes.

This is our family's go-to waffle recipe. Beating the eggs is a important step I making a crisp exterior and a fluffy interior. I found that when doing 100% whole wheat flour the waffles were not as easy to release from the waffle maker. I found that 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 AP works extremely well though. We like to add bananas, pecans and cinnamon to our batter... Or fresh blueberries.

Excellent!!  I tripled the recipe for these waffles for brunch. I whipped the egg whites before folding them into the batter, then refrigerated the batter over night.  The waffles turned out fluffy and delish!!  My guests all went for 2nd (and 3rd) servings!!

Delicious waffles that my family really enjoyed.  I used half whole wheat white flour and followed another reviewer's advice to add the egg whites after all other ingredients were combined and they came out light and fluffy. The recipe was very easy to follow!

These are delicious... a favorite breakfast around here!  I make them with whole wheat and then as a final step dump a bunch of frozen blueberries into the batter... and ALWAYS make a double batch so we have plenty to freeze for quick breakfasts in the future! :)

I use milk and cream in place of the milk and oil. The waffles are much better, and even healthier.

    2 eggs
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1 cup milk
    1 cup heavy cream
    1 tablespoon white sugar
    4 teaspoons baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

I try a different recipe everytime I make waffles. Obviously I don't make them that often but everytime I plan on making them, I have to run to the market to get buttermilk, active yeast, and other ingredients that I don't have normally sitting at home. I'm never doing that again and I'm never finding a new recipe. Waffles turned up fluffy and light, unlike the other waffle recipes I've tried.
I accidentally dumped some all spice in the mix thinking it was cinnamon and it actually still turned out pretty good. I would recommend this to anyone. Simple and great recipe!

My kids are doing the "30 hour famine" tomorrow and need a BIG breakfast, before 6am!  Of course, they requested waffles, and I wasnt looking forward to getting up in the morning to make them.  It was the part in the description about leaving the batter in the fridge that convinced me to try it.  I have a great recipe that I usually make that requires beating whites separately and melting butter.  I didnt want the hastle, and I can say, if these are half as good in the morning as the sample that we tasted tonight, I will never bother with the other recipe again!!  Thanks!

i made the healthiest version that i could.  i used whole wheat flour, very little oil, almond milk, and brown sugar.  i added lemon zest and dark chocolate chip (mainly to satisfy the hubby) for some flavor.  it was so light and fluffy...you couldn't tell that they were healthy.  very delicious.  i highly recommend.

This was a very simple recipe.  The 1st time I made it I made it exactly as directed.  Turned out great.  The 2nd time I used 1 cup WW flour and 1 cup AP flour.  It still turned out great.  The 3rd time I made it I used 1 cup ww flour and 1 cup ap flour, doubled the vanilla, added a touch more sugar and added cinnamon. It was great.   This is a very good recipe no matter how you make it!!

I normally don't rate recipes but on this one, I had to create an account to say this recipe is awesome. I used to buy boxed waffle mix - Not anymore! This is easy and tastes great. Only  modification I made was used less oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

These were very good.  I did add the nutmeg as suggested by another user, and that would be a great Christmas addition.  For every day use I would make as is...better than Bisquick :)

This turned out great!!!  I used half olive oil and half sugar- free applesauce for the vegetable oil in the recipe.  The waffles were terrific and definitely the best I have made in a while.  I doubled the recipe and am going to freeze the rest for a quick breakfast or snack as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks for this recipe!  I will definitely be using this one over and over.  I may even add chocolate chips or fruit the next time.  These, however, are great just the way they are!

This goes against every instinct but trust the recipe. Treat your eggs like butter and cut them into your flour. Follow the instructions and you will have amazing waffles that even Eggo can't compete with. The only change I ever make is increasing the yield from 6 to 9. Have a great breakfast!

We haven't used our waffle maker in about a year and I finally decided to dust it off today and try this recipe.  They were delicious!  I did double the vanilla extract and I thought the batter had a nice, cake-like flavor.  I'm saving this and I think it's my new go-to waffle recipe.

Would be a GREAT recipe if the waffles did not leave you with the bitter aftertaste of baking soda. Even after doubling sugar and vanilla.

I made these with the following variations, in order to make sweet potato waffles: 
Reduce milk to 1 1/2 cups, add 3/4 cup Bruce's sweet potato pie filling, substitute dark brown sugar for the white sugar, and separate egg whites and whip them, then fold them in at the last minute.
They were yummy!

VERY pleased with this recipe!  Used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and like others suggested used a tad more white sugar, and whipped egg whites separately and folded in at the end.  Crispy outside, light fluffy and delicious inside. I was also impressed with how crispy they stayed even after being removed from the waffle.  These were made yesterday, and today we put the leftovers in the toaster and they were still surprising delicious and crisp.  Served with Blueberry Maple Butter (maple syrup + butter + fresh blueberries. )  KEEPER recipe...Thanks for submitting!

Great and simple recipe. As with the rest of the reviews, added 1 Tbsp brown sugar and a little more vanilla.

Just tried this one and I separated the eggs and whipped the whites with 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to stiff peak and folded that into the batter. It made them really fluffy. I used Splenda instead of sugar and that went well. Those are the only changes to the recipe and the flavor was very good. I will have this again next week.

This is a crisp and tender and SUPER EASY recipe! I gave it four stars because of one simple change- I whipped the egg whites until stiff, then folded them into the batter at the end. I also like undercooking and then freezing extra waffles for weekday toaster waffles!

This was not to my liking.The eggs were way too much (it tasted toooo eggy) and it may also do with separating the whites from the yolks first. I'm mkaing waffles, not a meringue! They do not turn out at all like the picture.

I don't separate the egg whites (because that would then be the extra step I was avoiding - hence trying this recipe!) but rather beat the eggs a long time - until they get all frothy. 

I also toss in chocolate chips and the result is a great dessert that my son asks for every day! Best waffle recipe I have found! (hint about choc chips: I put them in a food processor to make smaller bits so there is more chocolate spread throughout the waffle)

I literally just did everything in order, with every measurement, and in 3 stirs it turned into a sticky glob. Way too much flour in the recipe, or not enough milk. And once you make it, its too late.

Decent basic light/crispy waffle recipe.  I did double the sugar and vanilla, and added 1t cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.  Still, the waffles were fairly bland and derive most of their flavor from the butter/syrup/toppings--but a basic recipe is what I was looking for.   I used an Oster round waffle maker and just over 3/4c of batter was the perfect amount per waffle.  I cooked them for 4 mins on medium high heat after preheating the waffle iron for 5 mins or so.  Texture was great--very light.

Really good recipe. Of course I changed a few things, used 1/2 stick melted butter instead of oil, used raw sugar, and added cinnamon. The whole family including picky husband and son loved it!

Amazingly fluffy and tasty waffles; making great carriers for syrup, fruit etc.  I used ghee instead of oil (1/4 cup) with a bit of water, and an egg substitute due to allergies.  Just fabulous!  Thank you.

i can easily say this recipe has 100 percent convinced me to never buy premade waffle mix ever again! this was so incredibly easy, and so delicious and light and perfect. I made warm strawberry sauce as I made this, and it was the most amazing topper. I want to make this for all of my friends!

Thought the recipe was great. I think it could have just a little more sugar just in case you want to eat them plain. 
I tried the waffle mix off the back of my pancake box and added vanilla extract and sugar to the recipe. It was good, but very dry. There is no way I'd want to eat them plan because it was dry. I think I'll stick with this one.

Extremely light and fluffy.  I suppose 4 teaspoons of baling powder will do that though!  I did not like the oil flavour that permeated throughout so next time I will try with plain melted butter.

As I was reading the reviews someone sad beat the egg whites separatly and then fold them in. Awesome. These were light, fluffy and crispy on the outside. I even put half whole wheat flour and they were still wonderful. Definite keeper. Mixing the whites was key to a great waffle.

I love this recipe! I added pecans the 2nd time I made it and it was even better. It wasn't thick like others I have tried. My hubby doesn't care for waffles that much but he likes this one.

The flavor was good.  It seemed to be a basic waffle recipe.  I just felt that the waffle seemed to be overly dense instead of airy.  Regardless, it was fine and although I will try a different recipe next time, I would use this one again if I needed to.

Following the original recipe, I found these rather bland. However, with some small changes, it is an excellent base recipe. 

Substituting Bisquick for the flour made a world of difference. These are so much tastier to me when I use Bisquick. 

I also used almond extract instead of vanilla.

This recipe was really good! I only made half of it, put in a spoonful of sugar (I only used half the recipe), substituted the oil for applesauce, and I didn't have vanilla so I left that out. I was very pleased with the results. The pancakes had no sticking problems to the waffle iron (with a little non-stick spray) and could crisp up nicely if you liked them that way. For half the recipe I thought a spoonful (it was medium-large) was enough flavor and sweetness.. especially when you have syrup, fresh peaches, and whipped cream on top! I was very happy!

A fantastic waffle recipe. Light, crispy, flavorful, and easy to make. I got 9 waffles using 2/3 C batter. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, replaced half the flour with whole wheat, and used 2 tsp vanilla. Next time will use all whole wheat!

I didn't have a waffle iron (I know, lame) so I had to make these as pancakes. Although the waffle would have been so much better, the pancakes were still really good!! I don't think I'll be buying mixes ever again. This is really tasty and so simple to make!

I just got my new Cuisinart Professional Waffle Maker and was looking for a good waffle recipe that was easier than the ones that came in the instruction manual (they all had yeast!?!) So I tried this one after reading some of the reviews.  I beat the egg whites seperately and added more sugar and vanilla as per some reviews as these are mainly to please the kids.  Today I also added a bit of cinammon to the mix.  It makes a waffle with a really nice texture.  Crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  The kids are really impressed and suggested to me that we put portions in the fridge so they can cook their own on school mornings.

These have the perfect consistency and turn out really fluffy. It just needed more sugar. My sister accidentally put three times as much sugar in the second batch and it tasted much better. We have left it in the fridge for almost a week, and it turned out just as good! This will be the new waffle recipe for our house!

Like all the other reviews, this recipe turned out perfect waffles. The kids loved em' and the two extra went in the fridge but were gone by the end of the day. Will be making these easy waffles a lot more often. I too had my waffle iron put away for years, was planning in selling it at a yard sale, glad I didn't.

We couldn't find our waffle recipe that came with the waffle iron. My son and I found this recipe. It was so easy and fast and so did not stick to the iron at all. We LOVE it! Thank you so for sharing. "Ewan and DADDY really liked IT you are NUMBER#1"....That was my son:)

This has become an absolute favorite of my co-workers - I bring the waffle iron to work and we have waffles on our lunch break (it helps that my Kitchenaid waffle iron makes two waffles at a time).  I have been asked to give a recipe for these waffles to at least 20 people.  I add a little cinnamon, just about 1/4 tsp.  Bravo!

Very good waffles!  Agree with the comments to reduce to 1 t. baking powder, otherwise the aftertaste is very noticeable.

Great basic recipe. One tip: I was almost out of milk the other day but still wanted to make waffles. I substituted plain yogurt for half the milk. I loved the results! They had a slightly thicker consistency, but still soft. Since then, I've made waffles a couple more times and kept putting in yogurt even though I did have milk!

This is a very good and easy recipe. The texture was perfect; light with a nice crunch on the outside and tender on the inside. Because I don't use much syrup I like to add a lot of flavor to my waffles instead. I added a 1/4 tsp. of lemon oil along with 1 tsp. of vanilla.

This is how waffles should be! It's so light and fluffy, yet crispy on the outside. It's not super dense, so you can eat more than one and not feel sick. :p I'm never buying boxed waffle mix again!

LOVE LOVE LOVE these waffles!! I am in college and my family loves when I make these with my home made fruit sauce! They are even great to make in bulk, then freeze, pop in the toaster, and a to-go/quick breakfast! I added flaxseed seed and used unbleached flour to make it healthier and get those omega-3s in! :)

This recipe is amazing! It's a favorite with the whole family, and it's really easy to make. I did double the sugar, and added a bit more than double the vanilla, and that made it taste so much better. You should certainly try this recipe, it's awesome!

I was craving waffles but was kinda disappointed.  It's just a basic, almost flavorless waffle and I wasn't impressed.  Like other reviewers suggested, you will need to add more sugar, maybe some cinnamon and double the vanilla.  Perhaps that would add some flavor.

These waffles were terrific! 
I separated the eggs and added the whipped egg whites and the end. I also doubled the vanilla and substituted soy milk for milk, as there is a dairy allergy in my family.
They were flavourful and fluffy!

This is an easy, always-turns-out-perfect waffle recipe.  I make them gluten-free with Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten Free Flour and I add one teaspoon of xanthan gum.  I also substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for 1/4 cup of the oil and 1 cup of buttermilk for part of the milk just for fun.  I make these waffles almost weekly and I freeze leftovers to toast later.

I made these with 2/3 C almond flour and the rest all-purpose gluten free flour.  I also substituted almond milk for the dairy and honey for the sugar.  I didn't have vanilla extract.  The flavor of these waffles is pretty bland, but I think that's the way it's supposed to be!  But, oh man, the texture is just awesome.  So crispy and light, and I didn't bother beating the eggs separately.  I just mixed all of the liquids together at once.  I don't get much steam from my waffle iron, but I found that 9 minutes is about how long it took to bring these to a golden brown.  These waffles reheat extremely well in the toaster oven.

Absolutely delicious! To make it easier I measured milk in a large 2 cup measuring cup, added egg yolks, vanilla & oil. Whisked vigorously.  Put my sifter on top of my large 8 cup measuring bowl.  Sifted dry ingredients  then whisked in milk mixture till smooth.  Whipped egg whites till stiff then folded into batter.  I did double the sugar and vanilla like previous reviews. They were just perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

Nice and fluffy, golden brown.  I didn't especially care for the taste.  The taste of baking soda was kind of heavy, giving it a slightly bitter aftertaste.  I'd use less baking soda next time (hopefully it would still be enough to keep the fluffiness), and maybe add a little more sugar.

Great basic recipe...crisp on the outside and tender inside.  To suit our tastes I doubled sugar and added a dash of almond extract and cinnamon.  Will use again.

I did not care for this recipe! It was too thick to pour into the waffle iron and it was almost too thick to spread! I agree with another reviewer that it was a waste of money to make this recipe! (If zero stars were an option, this recipe would get that rating.)

We've made this recipe three times now. It's fantastic. Be sure to beat the eggs with a hand mixer. I beat them by hand the second time, and the waffles didn't seem as fluffy. Great recipe! Thanks!

Very good recipe.  I used applesauce instead of oil for a healthier waffle.  Highly recommend using the applesauce anyway for flavor.  Everyone liked this, including my very picky 7 year old!  Will make again :)

I ran out of Krusteaz so tried this.  not sure if I did something wrong here but they were spongey, not lite & fluffy.  I mixed dry ingred. 1st then added all in and mixed.  Maybe they were suppsed to go in seperately - it doesn't specify.  maybe I didn't cook long enuf.  I dunno but I've made alot of waffles and these were some of the worst.

This is certainly an improvement over the recipe that came with my waffle maker. I still found it to be a little bland. I used almost twice the vanilla, about ¼ c of sugar, and some almond extract for flavor. If I made this again I might try a little citrus zest to kick it up next time too. My husband and I used quite a bit of syrup and my son only ate about half of his.   Whipping up the egg whites and folding them into the batter does make a huge difference. The batter will be lighter and your waffle more fluffy.   An ok recipe as a base to play with, but fairly flavorless on its own.

This is hands down the BEST waffle recipe I have ever made! I was shocked at how fluffy and light they turned out to be and was even more amazed at the taste. I am pretty sure I've made this recipe 5 times in the last 2 weeks! This morning we realized we didn't have any vegetable oil so we substituted melted margarine. I was disappointed but my husband said "with a waffle recipe as delicious as this one it can afford to lose a little ingredient-wise and will still be great" and he was right! This is definitely a staple breakfast for us! To the people who made this and it didn't turn out...I honestly don't know what you did. Maybe you replaced the baking powder with baking soda or something? I am not sure how you could screw this up if you follow the directions!  Thanks, OneShyOfABunch!

This recipe made spectacular waffles. It reminded my husband of the best waffle he ever had in Sausalito, CA. I added bananas and peanut butter on top for twist.

I made this recipe as is and it was awesome! I used a whisk for everything because I don't have a beater and it turned out very well. I wasn't expecting them to be so fluffy and flavourful. I've been trying many waffle recipes lately and this is hands down, the best one on this website. Highly recommended!

EGGNOG WAFFLES!!!!! I followed the recipe with the exception of eggnog instead of milk, which also takes care of the flavor issue. 4/5 because they're still a bit dense for me.

These are great!  Simple enough for my grandkids to help make and delicious.  I will never use a mix again.
I did add 1/2 t baking soda, used 1 t vanilla and 2 T powdered sugar instead of white sugar.
If you have a stick beater they work great and no mess.

I also used whole wheat flour and used apple sauce instead of oil.  I did put in a little cinnamon and a hint of ginger for added flavor.  Plus a little extra vanilla.  Toddler and Husband loved them.  Will definitely make again.

These were very tasty, but I made a few changes. I doubled the sugar and vanilla. I used olive oil and I added a generous amount of nutmeg, with a few dashes of ground ginger. I topped it with a bit of butter, and strawberry jam.

I used wheat flour to try and be healthy, I bet if I had used white flour that would have been over the top even more yum! Great recipe.

OK when I went to make these my waffle iron broke, but I had several hungry mouths to feed!!!  So I quickly thinned the batter a tad with some milk and made pancakes instead!  They were light and fluffy and the flavor was fantastic!  lol!  I am assuming that if I had been able to make them as waffles the flavor would have been just as good! :)

Major Revision:  I separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites into firm peaks. In a separate bowl I blended all of the ingredients (yes, the egg yolks too).  I added a teaspoon more vanilla extract and 1/2 tablespoon of sugar to the recipe. Then I folded the whites into the batter at the very last minute.  I used a belgian waffle iron.  So my waffles were crisp on the outside, but fluffy and moist in the middle.

made these tonight and they were very good. I took the advise of others and doubled the amount of sugar and vanilla, whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in. i doubled the batch and made some with blueberries and some with chocolate chips. they were a hit with everyone. next time I wont double the batch, I have enough to feed an army lol

Great Recipe!  I substitute applesauce for the oil, double the vanilla and sugar, use just egg whites and my kids gobble them up.  I get 6 waffles per batch with a Waring Pro waffle iron.  The freeze great and then you have no processed healthy frozen waffles that you pop in the toaster for quick school morning breakfasts!  Love it!!

These were fantastic! I made the mistake of doubling this recipe, thinking it may not make enough, but WHOA...we're going to be eating these for the rest of the week. Anyway, aside from that -- these were great. Thank you!!

I highly recommend going and making these waffles for yourself and your loved ones like right now. They are all they claim to be and more. They were especially light and crispy compared to other waffle recipes. They make the waffle mix that comes in a big uncaring bag taste like concrete mix. But seriously if you add in some homemade syrup it really can pull your day together. I altered this recipe a little bit and added a half cup of sugar that made them very good!

Solid recipe! Great texture, great taste, easy to make. After a batch of these you'll wonder why you ever considered frozen waffles. I followed the recipe making NO changes or modifications; it's a keeper just as it is.

This makes a perfect waffle that we eat at least a couple times a week.  I usually double the recipe and store in the fridge to make fresh waffles for the next couple of days.  I also substitute some of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour to make it  little more healthy for the kiddos.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the recipe, and since I am at semi-high altitude (5500 ft), I used 7tsp of baking powder instead of the full 8.  Other than that I didn't change anything.  These waffles came out crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and delicious!

For a healthier batch of waffles I split the flour in half, 1 c. whole wheat and 1c. all-purpose flour.  Instead of the vegetable oil I use a 1/2 of unsweetened applesauce.

I thought the batter was a little thin i added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  I also added a little extra vanilla   I have also tried a healthy version that came out really well. 1/2 white flour 1/2 wheat, 1 TBS of milled flax seed with water to replace the egg and added a pint of blueberries.  Came out great.

super light and airy and fully says my hubby. This is the second time I've made a batch. This is what I did different though: 1) Blend eggs with milk with my Magic Bullet; 2) double the vanilla; 3) half the sugar and evoo (instead of veggie oil); and 4) added a touch of nutmeg.  I think using the Magic Bullet for the eggs and milk really made the difference. Last time, I followed someone else's recommendation to whip the egg whites separately from yolks and then folded it in. This time it was even fluffier than the last. :)

A very good basic recipe. I add a few sprinkles of cinnamon and nutmeg and use a Belgian waffle iron. They come out very light and fluffy and the family loves them. Excellent with blueberry maple syrup.

Fantastic! I took the advice of others and doubled the sugar and vanilla. I also separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites and folded them in. We had these for dinner and if I could just figure out how to make more than one waffle at a time it would be the perfect meal. Not looking any further for another waffle recipe.

Delicious, cheap, and easy.  Perfect for a weekend morning.  I have also made a few batches and thrown them in the freezer, my husband pulls them out for a quick weekday breakfast.

These were easy to make and good.  It makes a good amount so the next day I just put in the toaster to warm and they are as good as the day you made them.

Ran out of waffle mix, so decided to make these from scratch.  Reduced veggie oil to 1 tbs. and they tasted yummy, but a probably not as fluffy as the original recipe, which was fine with me.  Saved on fat and we enjoyed them.

We love these waffles in our house!  I do double the vanilla and sugar when making them, and also add a little cinnamon and nutmeg, just because we love cinnamon around here.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good!  I added a little bit more white sugar and a bit of brown sugar, as well as some cinnamon.  I like my waffles to be sweet enough that you don't need syrup.  Fantastic!  Cooked the whole batch so I can freeze some for later.  Works great when reheated in the toaster oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent, nice and fluffy.  If you like them crisp heat the oven slightly and put them in straight on the rack or on a cooling rack in the oven.  They keep their crispness that way so the whole family can eat together.

The waffles came out light, fluffy and delicious! This is the only waffle recipe I use now. It makes about 4 full size waffles for me (even though the original yield is 6). This waffle saves well too. I ate it for breakfast and refrigerated some for dinner and it was still delicious!

For a simple and classic waffle recipe, this was perfect. The flavor couldnt have been better. I have made many waffles with more extravagant and luxurious ingredients such as sour cream or buttermilk and real butter, but these were better and I liked the fact I didnt have to hunt for lots of ingredients.

I tried this recipe because it can keep in the refrigerator for a week- I didn't know what to expect quality-wise.  It's fantastic!  I prefer it to my old buttermilk waffle standby.  It gets nice and crisp on the outside, but still has a nice, tender crumb.  I do double up on the vanilla.  This is so nice for the summer, when my kids want something other than boxed cereal and I have the time to prepare something that doesn't take a ton of work.  Perfection!

Great recipe and soooo easy to make.  But i did add a spoon of brown sugar and I added more vanilla by accident.  I was afraid it would overwhelm the taste but luckily the waffles didn't taste like vanilla and they weren't sweet.  (husband doesn't like sweet waffles so he loved these).  This recipe is a keeper and will be using it again and again.

I cut the milk back to 1 1/2 cups because mind batter seemed to runny. I also upped the sugar to 3 tablespoons per other reviews. But other than that, I followed the recipe and these turned out light and fluffy and more than sweet enough. I had tons leftover so the batter is going in the fridge for the week. Thanks!

Excellent recipe which my family really enjoyed. I made the following changes: double sugar & vanilla, plus a dash of cinammon.  Also, I used buttermilk and added an extra 1/2 cup as otherwise the batter was too thick to stir.

My first foray into waffle making was a success!  Thank you for the recipe, my kids have decided they don't even want to go to IHOP anymore, ha! I added Watkins vanilla doubled and more sugar, but wow they were good.

This is a good base recipe but really needs sugar, vanilla and cinamon to make it great.  I added 2 T sugar, 1 t vanilla and a couple of pinches of cinamon.

Fantastic waffles, very crisp and tasty!  I used almond extract for a unique flavor.

VARIATION:  Add diced fully-cooked bacon to waffle batter before closing lid of waffle iron.

These waffles are quick and very easy to make.  However, they are quite bland and are not very good without toppings.  I would probably not make this recipe again.

Good waffle recipe, my teen says better than the mix.  I rarely use real eggs, so I used egg substitue as usual & beat them till fluffy.  Also, since I only have non-fat milk I mixed that about 1/2 with lowfat buttermilk to equal 1 & 3/4c.   The waffles needed a little longer than the autotimer on my waffle iron said in order to be crisp, but they were quite good.

After making the recipe for the 4th try, I finally managed to follow the recipe directly and the waffles turned out fluffier than the other 3 times I've attempted this recipe.  I would prefer flufflier.  Will need to keep searching for a waffle recipe

Great recipe.  I used Buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The batter seemed a little thick to me, so I added a bit of water after everything was mixed together.  My kids & I enjoyed this recipe.  I'd use it again, but I don't feel glued to the recipe either.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and I am sure that if you did you'd have terrific waffles. But I did 1 and 1/2 cups milk and 1 cup of orange craisins plumped for 5 minutes  in boiling orange juice. AMAZING!

I did make a few modifications, but this recipe is so quick and easy! I added some cinnamon and doubled the vanilla (vanilla brought home from Mexico is phenomenal) I doubled the sugar and used all brown sugar, I used applesauce rather than oil. I did however use the woman's idea to throw it all in a blender and mix it up, what a genius idea! It turned out perfectly and they are tasty and light :-)

These were great! I doubled the vanilla and sugar as some suggested, and added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I added mini chocolate chips to half the waffles, and blueberries to the other half. Will use again.

Absolutely the best waffle recipe I've ever used.  These waffles have become a every weekend treat. I would highly recommend either by following the recipe or doing the variations as suggested (personally I sub apple sauce for oil; half wheat/ half unbleached white flour; brown sugar for white; and I add the cinnamon just for that extra bite).

These were great!  We doubled the sugar and vanilla (would like to try doing that with half white and half brown sugar next time) and we added 1/2t. cinnamon.  We also beat the egg whites separately and added them at the end, which worked great.  They don't have a TON of flavor, but they are a great basic recipe and got nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which we love.  Made about 12 waffles for us.

This is excellent with a few tweaks.  Like others I doubled the vanilla and sugar and added 1/4tsp cinnamon.  Also, I listened to what others said, and separating the egg whites and making beating them fluffy, then adding them in the end is genius!  the first time I made these I didn't do that and they didn't rise enough to meet the other side of the waffle iron.  With the fluffy egg whites added they fluff right up!

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  I'm kinda picky about my waffles.  I really want them to be slightly crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  This recipe had all that.  The flavor was also great.  I used white whole wheat flour and they came out fantastic.  Even my non-waffle eating kids gobbled them up.  THANKS!

This recipe was delicious, light, and crisp. Although my sister found it a little bland so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and one apple pealed and cubed and she couldn't get enough of them. x)

Excellent waffle recipe. Recommend separating the eggs; whipping the egg whites until stiff peaks form; using a whisk to mix the egg yolks, milk, oil and vanilla; sifting together the dry ingredients and mixing them into the wet ingredients with the whisk; then folding the egg whites into the batter with a spatula, leaving a few fluffs of whites in tact. I used 1 1/8c. of batter for each waffle in my Presto Flip Side waffle maker, and the recipe yielded 4 1/2, 7-inch waffles.

I almost past this recipe up based on the picture.  Doesn't do it justice.  I subs 1/3 cup of the flour with Bob's Red Mill Whole grain pancake mix just to add a little texture.  Added 2 Tbs of my sourdough starter and 2 dashes of cinn.  Anyways, these were the BEST waffles I have ever made.  I couldn't believe that waffles like this was possible at home!   I know I doctored the recipe a bit, but I'm sure it would have been just the same as is.   I am not surprise this recipe has such HIGH ratings.  THANK YOU!!!  :)

I have a family of 7 (5 kids), I have a 1950 westinghouse waffle iron that has no nonstick coating and these waffles were the best we ever had. I adjusted the recipe to make 16 waffles since my iron can make 4 at a time and this recipe made 24 tender yet crispy waffles that we all just ooooh and ahhhh over. the recipes called for 5 and a quater egss but I just used 5, I aso added a bit more vanilla and a pinch more sugar. This is a definate keeper. I was able to have enough to store and freeze for later.

These waffles turned out great! Even though I messed up. I did not beat the eggs properly, and I forgot the vanilla. I did triple the sugar. Even with my mistakes they turned out very tasty. Cant wait to make these again!

Crispy on outside.  Soft inside but bland in taste.  Made second batch and added more sugar and salt.  That does the trick.

this is my new waffle recipe - nice and light.  doubled sugar and vanilla as recommended by others.  made a double batch and froze the leftovers.  Warmed the frozen ones in the oven and they were still nice and light, just like the fresh batch.  thanks for a great recipe!

Very light and yet somehow missing...something.  I'm a novice when it comes to cooking so I'm not really sure what I could add to liven it up.  I always follow the recipe exactly the first time so this weekend I'll try out some of the suggestions and see what I come up with.  I do love the consistency though.  Thanks for the share!

Great waffles. I also added a little more sugar and vanilla, and I also whipped the egg whites and folded them in. Very crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Easy and delightful.

Really delicious.  I'm not used to making homemade waffles and decided to give it a try for a special Valentine's Day brunch.  They were so good and super easy!!  Will keep this one on file for when I want to pull out the Belgian waffle maker!!

Delicious with the following changes: 2 tsp. Vanilla, 3 Tbs. sugar. Mix up the batch in the blender, then it's easy to get the eggs nice and fluffy.

The Waffles II recipe is much better.  It's not that different and it takes a little more time to separate the eggs and beat the whites, but it's worth the extra 5 min.  This was bland even with buttermilk, extra sugar and vanilla, and I'm a person who doesn't like things very sweet.  It just felt like it was missing something.  We'll definitely use Waffles II from now on.

At last! Perfect, light waffles...I've been looking for a long time. Doubled sugar and vanilla, per other instructions. Needed no special prep. Used the blender after putting all the ingredients in at once. A relief after the lead-in-the-stomach box mixes! You get a crown for this one!

VEGAN FRIENDLY! YEAH!  Not nearly a vegan, but I was craving waffles so bad and my new iron was hot, so I made and ate 4 waffles before adding egg and they were good. (It wasn't just the hunger.) For the vegan add about 2-3 more tablespoons of "milk" and a 1/4 tsp of baking soda should be added by everyone.  The sodium from the baking soda will permeate the batter more effectively than salt alone.  I added 3 more tbsps of sugar bringing the total to 1/4 c of sugar and a whole tsp of vanilla.  Overall, great texture and delicious prepared in advance and toasted the next morning. It lost a star b/c the flavor needed so much tweeking.  Everything else was great.

This is the best waffle recipe I have found, and I have tried several different waffle recipes. The main reason why I love this recipe so much is because it doesn't have a huge amount of butter in it. Every waffle recipe I have made asks for a tone of butter. The Joy of Cooking cook book asks for 16 tablespoons of butter in their recipe (yowza!), so I am very pleased to find a recipe that tastes great, is fluffy yet firm, and doesn't make me gain five pounds after eating my breakfast.

I made these this morning for "Waffle Wednesday." I've only made Bisquick's waffles, but since I'm getting away from using it, chose this recipe. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in this recipe. The one change I made was increasing the vanilla to 1tsp, but these were rather bland. The waffles also became soggy really fast. I was shocked at the amount of oil called for, as half a cup seems like a lot IMO. Will continue my search...

Since I made the waffles exactly as written, I am qualified to write this review.  These waffles turned out well.  They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I served them with butter and maple syrup, and everyone loved thwm.

Very easy and delicious!  Also, the batter didn't run out of my waffle iron like many of them do.  It seemed to stick in there a little better and raise up as opposed to running and squishing out the sides.

These were good, but not great.  Not sweet at all and would benefit from more sugar and/or vanilla extract.  I will make again but I think the flavor needs a bit of tweaking. Folded egg whites in separate which did make for a light and crispy waffle.

Very good recipe. Made the night before, and was a fantastic quick breakfast.  My hubby had no idea that I used half wheat and half white flour. Very fluffy! I enjoy topping with cool whip and fresh berries.

Some waffle recipes allow for a substitution of oil for applesauce. This isn't one of them. They were okay, but turned out a bit spongy. I'm sure they're a fine waffle if followed per the recipe, but they just didn't fit my preference.

Loved the sweet vanilla flavor.  I made a double batch, made them all up, froze them and have the family pulling them out and toasting them.  They are wonderful.  Next time, I will try to use less oil as I don't think this much is needed.
Update:  I used 1/2 the oil and it came out fine.  I used almond/coconut milk instead of cows milk and they were a little tougher than with cows milk.

I thought these were great!  However I could taste too much of the baking powder.  Will use again but maybe cut back on the b powder.

I just made these waffles for everyone in my office this morning.  It is a co-workers birthday and I thought it would be fun to have a waffle wednesday.  I followed the recipe to the letter and they were some of the best waffles I've ever had, if I do say so myself.  Twenty of my co-workers agree.  They cook up light and crispy on the outside and are beautiful and golden.  Just as easy as jiffy and one hundred times better.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

These are very good and easy to make.  I doubled the sugar, vanilla and salt like others suggested.  Thanks for sharing.  These also freeze well.  I pop them in the toaster oven and they are excellent.

Delicious! Very light and fluffy. I ended up substituting brown sugar for white since it was all I had on hand, but I doubt it changed the outcome of the recipe any.

I made these this morning for New Years Day.  Besides adding extra vanilla (based on many recommendations), I followed the recipe exactly, but found them to be dry and lacking flavor.  Will keep searching for the perfect waffle recipe.

Tried and True!  Love this recipe and have been following it for several years and is the popular vote in my house on "fun Fridays."  I like a much lighter waffle consistency so I use exactly 2 whole cups of milk and add about a 1/4 cup of water.  Perfection.

I have tried this recipe both as it is written and with others modifications. It's definitely better with the modifications. I did this as advised by other raters: doubled sugar and vanilla, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon (added flavor, not overpowering) and brown sugar, reduced oil to 1/4 cup and beat egg whites separate from the yolks. Difference with the mods: lighter, fluffier and more taste! Less dense and hard. YUMMY! Now is a keeper!

Thick batter, first time using my Cooks Flip Style Waffle Iron.  Overall a good waffle batter, would prefer a little more flavor so syrup wouldn't be necessary.

make these 2 times a month, a real staple in our house.  5 minutes on high on the George Foreman and it's done.  Really takes like 4 minutes to prep, so can't go wrong.

very tasty!  First time I ever made homemade waffles and I will use this recipe again.  I took the suggestions below and used buttermilk.  I was short on the flour so I supplemented with a little corn starch.

Delicious waffles!  I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious waffles! I changed the normal milk for buttermilk and they turned out fluffy and my kitchen smelled of a dutch bakery! Only complaint is the amount of oil, it seems a bit excessive! Overall very good and very fluffy

This is my favorite waffle recipe.  I know it by heart now and my family loves them.  I make the recipe exactly as stated with the addition of 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  My son prefers maple syrup but I usually make Blueberry Sauce from this site for myself. Once we added blueberries directly and they were magnificent.  This is one of those recipes that is so simple and so tasty you should stop scouring right now for the perfect waffle.  You have it.

Totally perfect as written.  No changes necessary.  Quick, easy, crispy on the outside and just sweet enough to be totally delicious!

Made these just a few moments ago because i was craving for waffles. I like my waffles a little overcooked (so its really brown all over), i topped it off with maple syrup and some chilled sliced bananas. Love it! Will be using the recipe again :) Btw, definitely DOUBLE the sugar and vanilla.

The first time I made this recipe I accidentally left out the baking powder and the waffles really didn't turn out very well. I tried it again and did the recipe exactly as stated and they turned out great. I may add cinnamon to them the next time.

Pretty good but I think there can be more flavor. I followed the recipe except that I doubled the vanilla as suggested by another reviewer. I also folded in the egg whites at the end for a fluffier waffle. I will try other recipes for a bit more flavor next time.

I made breakfast for dinner - which we love at our house, and this is the first time I have ever made waffles from scratch, I always use Bisquick.  Anyway, I followed the recipe to the letter, and we thought they were great!  I loved them.  I saw someone saying that their waffles were way too thin, my waffles were not thin at all.  They were light and fluffy.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  My teenage daughter was pretty impressed!

It was a good batter, but my waffles came out way too thin! I was a little disappointed (I was looking for something a bit fluffier) but my family really loved them. I too, doubled the amount of sugar.

Absolutely love these waffles.They were so crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I realize now that the other recipe I was using had no flavor. I buy bread flour so that was what I used instead of plain all purpose, other than that I didn't change the recipe in any way. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is an outstanding recipe. I suggest doubling the amount of sugar, however. I also recommend spraying your waffle iron with cooking spray before EACH waffle. Yummy!!

This was great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I did change it. I separated the egg whites and set them aside. Mixed the egg yokes with the wet ingredients. Then mixed the dry ingredents(I used white wheat flour) and added 1/2 teaspoon of pumkin spice.  Next I beat the egg whites to a peak and folded them into the batter.  This makes them come out crips. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes. Left overs we freeze and my kids love putting them into the toaster through out the week.  They also love it when I cook some rasins into them.  I at least make them once a week.

No sure why it is rated to high.  The waffles have a very bland flavor, pretty good texture, but flavor is lacking.  Might as well have a frozen eggo instead of go to this trouble.

LOVE IT! I don't have a waffle maker, so I used my cast iron grill pan (well buttered) instead just to give it some texture. It tasted very fluffy, my boyfriend loved it, and that speaks volume because he's usually very fussy. This recipe is going in my collection!

Perfect waffles!  I made these before I read the reviews.  Next time I will beat the egg whites then fold them in as the other reviewers suggested. Just like my Mon used to do.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  My kids (and I) can't get enough of waffles when I use this recipe!  I like to put in almond extract too, just because I like almond so much.  It makes it really yummy!  It's good with just vanilla too though :)  Our favorite way to eat them is with sliced bananas on the top, drizzled with homemade caramel sauce...  Almost makes it more like a dessert!

These had a really nice flavor and an eggy custard like smell.  They cooked perfectly, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. And so easy to make.

I made this just as-is, and it was amazing! My husband, who is strangely picky about his waffles, said he has never had homemade waffles that tasted like restaurant waffles. Success!! I'm making them again tonight, and I'm thinking about using it as the base for the French Toast waffles too!

I searched a while for a good waffle recipe when I first bought my waffler, and this is the winner! So glad to have found it. I added some blueberries into the batter last time and the waffles  were delicious!

Good recipe.  I did beat the egg whites first...I think that adds to the waffles being alittle more light & fluffy!  Crisp on the outside and light fluffy on the inside...just the way waffles should be. Add fresh berries & whip cream...yum!

They way I made these turned out great.  I made these into all healthy waffles.  I used King Arthur's Whole Wheat Flour,  Organic Vanilla Soy Milk ( can use the low fat kind, although it's already low in fat!), I used Splenda and doubled it as suggested by others. Instead of oil I used a 4 oz jar of baby food.  I didn't have applesauce like others suggested so I looked for a baby food applesauce and only found "Apples & Peaches" but it worked just the same!  Then to top the waffles I used Smart Balance Omega with Extra Virgin Olive Oil Butter Spread & Maple Grove Farms Sugar Free Syrup.  These tasted pretty much like a regular waffle only WAY healthy.  Plus with all the fiber you will feel full after one and stay full for a good part of the day!!

So good. Quick, easy, and really tasty.  Crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  I have tried TONS of waffle recipes that were complicated and time consumming (not to mention took ingrediants that I had to go out and buy just for that one recipe!) and they didn't come out nearly as good as this one.

Followed recipe to a "T" and they were the best waffles I have ever made! I used whole wheat flour which made them very filling.  I also added some cinnamon because I put it in everything.  I topped with some blueberries and maple syrup.  Thanks for the recipe! ** Updated: I beat eggs in blender to whip them, then added and blended all wet ingredients and finished by blending in the flour. I was able to pour directly from the blender! I do sub yogurt or applesauce for the oil.

A simple, yet good waffle recipe.  The only thing I change is to separate the egg whites, whip until stiff peaks form, then fold them in at the end.  It makes the waffles so much fluffier!  We also love to add chocolate chips.  Double the sugar and vanilla for a sweeter, richer waffle.  Yummy!!

Light and fluffy!  Just a not about the sugar: If you want to eat your waffles like a cookie then I would add sugar. If you add sweet stuff to them anyway, then I personally don't see the need for added sugar.

My turned out too crispy - never had that happen before, so much so, I couldn't get them out of the wafflemaker. After three failed tries I made pancakes with the rest of the batter - with modifications, it would be an excellent recipe for crepes.

This recipe was very good! I followed the suggestions of others by doubling the vanilla, doubling the sugar, adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and separating the eggs. I whisked the egg whites until light and fluffy and folded in last. I also used a hand mixer. The batter seemed thinner than a typical box mix, possibly b/c of the hand mixer. May work just as well using a whisk. The recipe will make at least 5 full size waffles and probably 6 if none of it ran over the sides (thin batter). The result was light and fluffy pancakes! They tasted very good and my friend said they were "the best waffles he ever had." I definitely think the cinnamon and vanilla are the key ingredients. I also noticed that the waffles are crispier if you don't spray the iron with cooking spray. If you like softer waffles, spray it every other waffle made. I also added chocolate chips to a few - Yum! Batter works great stored over night as well.

This was my first time making waffles from scratch so I wanted just an easy recipe to follow.  This was not only easy to follow, but my waffles turned out wonderfully (minus my first mistake of putting too much batter into my waffle iron!).  I have a thing for cinnamon and vanilla so I ended up putting in a whole lot more vanilla than called for.  I also didn't separate the eggs like what some people had suggested and my waffles still turned out amazing!  I will be making this again in the future as it makes 8 large waffles.

I substituted half the oil with applesauce, doubled the vanilla, and used brown sugar instead of white. As other reviewers have recommended, I beat the egg whites separately and folded them into the batter at the end. The waffles were excellent: light and fluffy on the inside and perfectly crisp on the outside. They tasted were delicious and so easy to make. Next time, I plan on using whole wheat flour and flax seed instead of white flour. I will never use waffle mix again!

Great basic recipe! I made it exactly as written and it made 14 beautiful waffles in my cuisin art waffle iron. There wasn't anything extra special about these waffles, but you could personalize them with a teaspoon of any extract, such as lemon or maple. Great basic recipe for waffles! Thanks!

Very good basic waffle recipe.  I would recommend more salt for my taste but other than that it was really good.  Next time I'll try beating the egg whites separate to fold in last as others suggest.  A good waffle iron makes a real difference.  Try this recipe as written, then play with it to make it your own.  You'll love it.

These turn out really good (better than any I have had at any waffle house).  They turn out best for me when I use about 1/4 cup per waffle and only grease the waffle maker at the beginning.

Wonderful!  We added 1 tsp of brown sugar and some ground flax seed.  I also used butter milk instead of regular milk.  Wonderful taste and light and airy!   We love these!

Love these waffles! I only make 1 change similar to others. I nearly double the sugar. But that's it! I serve warm with sweetened strawberries and freshly whipped cream! The batter does well in the fridge for at least two days covered. The waffles do great in the freezer too! Just microwave for around 20 seconds and then just barely crisp in the toaster. Perfect!

OMG!  These are "the best" and so easy!  I ran out of milk so I only used 1 cup of milk and had to use 3/4 cup of whipping cream for the rest.  I used 1 and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I through all the ingredients in the order listed into the KitchenAid and whipped for a few minutes.  These were crunchy, yummy, perfect waffles!!!

Very easy and GOOD!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you can kind of taste the baking powder.  Produces very nice crispy waffles.

I used this recipe with our new waffle iron and it was great!  It was a lot better than I expected, since it doesn't call for beating the egg whites separately, and because I used half whole-wheat flour and half all-purpose.  The waffles were toasty outside and cakey inside.  Perfect!

These were disappointing.  I made the recipe as written and they turned out pretty and golden.  However, the texture was dense (despite whipping my eggs) and thick and cakey.  I was hoping for something lighter I guess.  Perhaps whipping the egg whites seperately would help as some suggested, but that would be a different recipe.  Sorry to give a bad review, but these were nothing special.  Will not make again.

Good basic recipe for a nice texture, but these are very bland on their own.  I made half with cocoa powder added, and the rest with mini chocolate chips.  Had to add whip cream and chocolate syrup on top of both to enhance the flavor.  As is, these are not for someone with a sweet tooth.

I was using "Classic Waffles" as my go to recipe due to the butter. But, I was going to be making a ton of waffles off site so this recipe was a bit easier due to the oil. I was very happy that the oil instead of butter didn't seem to matter and if anything the waffles were crisper on the outside. Try adding chocolate chips on them right after you pour on the batter before closing the lid.

Fantastic. I had never made waffles before but got a waffle maker for my wedding last week and really wanted to try it out. These were great. I added just a little more vanilla (because I like things vanilla-y) and separated the egg whites, beat them and folded them into the batter at the end as another reviewer suggested and these were the best waffles I have ever had. Will definately use this recipe over and over again. I have some batter left over and will see tomorrow how it keeps in the fridge.

yup. it's a waffle. Not the "worlds greatest." But there's nothing at all bad about it either. I think the simplicity of the ingredients and the instruction make this an excellent recipe for first-timers or anyone in need of a no fuss basic waffle recipe. It took me literally 5 min. to get these onto the iron the morning after my daughters sleepover. served with bluberry topping and whipped cream-- instant rock star mom!

This recipe reminds me of the waffles that my grandmother made for me as a child.  The only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is that like other reviews, I doubled the amount of sugar and vanilla and I always seperate my eggs and beat my egg whites until stiff and fold them into the batter before pouring into waffle iron.  There is only my husband and I so I bake all of the waffles and freeze the remainder.  I toast them in toaster at medium dark.  They are as crispy on the outside and tender on the inside as the day I made them.  Great recipe

No fail, great tasting, easy to make waffles.  I make double batches for my littles and freeze them in large zipper storage bags- popping them in the toaster in the mornings.  Oh- and I also add the whole wheat flour and Chocolate Chips- YUMMY!

I ran out of Bisquick and the kids wanted waffles, so this one looked worth trying.  Made them just as recipe stated and we all loved them and we will be making these instead now.  It made 12 waffles - just the right amount for our family of 5.  Thanks!

Great simple recipe. Very light and fluffy. I added strawberries and blueberries that I had chopped in my cuisinart first. I also made extra waffles and froze them. They're great a few days later....just pop them in the toaster for 15-20 seconds!

This was an excellent recipe.  I changed a couple of things to fit our taste.  I seperated the eggs, cut the milk to 1 1/4 cup, doubled the vanilla, added the rest of the wet ingredients, and two mashed bananas.  I then added the dry ingredients and lastly the two egg whites (which I had beaten till stiff peaks were formed).  They were so good!!  Next time, I will try it with whole wheat flours, a little wheat germ, and some flax seed meal.  Thank you so much!

Very easy and simple. I thought they were a little bland but my 3yr old and 1yr old gobbled them up so they will be worth making again for an easy breakfast.

I first tried this recipe as written, but have tweaked it to be more to our liking.  Use double the salt and sugar, only 1 1/2 cups milk and bump up the flour to 2 1/4 cups so the batter is thicker.  My boyfriend prefers half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon in the batter.  I've been making these waffles every Sunday for a month now and we love them!

They were light and airy, which was a nice change from some of the other recipes I have used.  I froze the waffles I wasn't able to eat and they work well popping them in the toaster for a quick breakfast (not as good as right out of the waffle iron but still tasty).

The perfect waffle mix!  I beat the eggs together, but for a good 5 minutes with the Kitchen Aid on high before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Waffles are fluffy and very tasty!

These are great. I sometimes add one
extra egg for the grandkids who don't
eat much after breakfast. That seems to
make them crisper. 
Everyone asks for this recipe.

I doubled the sugar & vanilla, and only used 1/3 cup of oil. I also separated the eggs and whipped the whites till they were like meringue then folded the whites into the completed batter before spooning onto the waffle iron. These turned out almost like Eggos! Delicious with a dusting of powdered sugar and a little strawberry syrup!

Loved the basis of this recipe. Made a few changes. Double the amount of sugar and vanilla, and change from 1 3/4 c milk to => 3/4 c buttermilk, 1 c milk. Also, separate egg white and beat until peaks form.  Go ahead and add yolks to main mixture. Fold in egg whites. Wonderful! I make these especially for Christmas morning.

These are good, though I will use "fxer"s modifications next time b/c I agree that these can use a bit more flavor. Might try buttermilk too.

I tried the recipe as is and thought it was good, but not great.  I made this a second time using whole wheat flour.  I also decreased the oil to 1/4 cup and used applesauce for the rest.  I also added cinnamon, doubled the vanilla, salt and the sugar.  I really enjoyed this more with those changes.

These turned out beautifully!  They even had a nice buttery taste which is wierd considering there's no butter in them!  Not sweet so I added more vanilla and sugar but that's just a personal preference.  Will definately use this recipe again, thank you!

This makes a great waffle.  The texture is perfect - fluffy and slightly crispy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We ran out of our boxed waffle/pancake mix this morning, so I decided to try something different.  This mix was pretty good, but I wouldn't say it was awesome.  I added 2 tablespoons of extra flour (the batter was originally too thin IMO), and an extra tablespoon of sugar, as well as extra vanilla extract.  I like my waffles sweet, not savory, which is why the sugar and vanilla were doubled.  Crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside.  This mix made six perfect waffles, and I'm going to freeze half of them for later.  Yum!

These weren't too bad. I think if I needed a homemade recipe I'd use it, but I still like my bisquik waffles. I think I will keep looking. Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe! Delicious, very easy and I like the convenience of making the batter ahead. Like previous reviewers, I double the sugar and vanilla. Great for breakfast, but I also have added chocolate chips and topped with whipped cream to make dessert waffles for company.

Very good. I whipped my egg whites and folded them in at the end. I also took out about 1 cup of batter and added 1 tbsp. of cocoa powder for my son's favorite, chocolate waffles.

I like this recipe because you do not have to beat the egg whites separately.  Not as good as when you beat egg whites separately but much less time consuming.  I freeze them and pop them in the toaster oven before eating.  Comes out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I also doubled the vanilla and sugar since I like my waffles on the sweet side.

Eh~ They're edible.  Not the best I've tasted, not the worst.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My family and I found them tasteless.  Maybe the addition of a flavored extract, cinnamon or fruit in the batter would improve this recipe, but I don't find it anything to write home about.

Good base recipe. I found the waffles to be bland even after adding pure vanilla and cinnamon. Maybe almond extract would do the trick? Not sure. Other than that these were crispy on the outside and pillowy and moist in the middle.

These waffles had great texture--crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle. I doubled the sugar like others said and added a little more vanilla...but still found them to be very bland. We are not a big sugar eating family so I dont want to add any more sugar-so next time I may cut back on the baking powder. My husband ate his second one with peanut butter and that seemed to help.

Soo good! The waffles were crispy on the outside and light, fluffy and tender on the inside. With margarine and syrup they are absolutely delicious, but without, kind of flavorless... Next time, I will double the sugar and add a little more vanilla. Other than that, these were fantastic!

I'm pretty sure that I'm not making it to Heaven because these must be a sin; a sin that I plan to keep right on committing! I have made these twice now. The first time was for 10 people between the ages of 3 and 53 and EVERYONE loved them. I just made them again for my 3 year old and myself. She said, "Mommy, you make the best, best, best, best waffles EVERRRR! 
I replaced my old iron about a year ago and was just about to toss the new one in the garbage because no waffle seemed to cook right...until now! 
This is my new (and improved) recipe for waffles. 
Ultra B, thanks so much for sharing such an  awesome and simple recipe!

Very simple and good waffle recipe.  I used it one morning when I didn't have buttermilk for my normal recipe.  I doubled the sugar and vanilla since a previous reviewer said they were slightly bland.  Everyone thought they were delicious and my 3 year old was able to help.  The tough part was waiting for the light to go off on the waffle iron.  I'll be using this in the future.

I made another waffle recipe on this site and although they turned out light and crispy it was a "fussier" recipe.  These waffles are just as good but all-in-one-bowl EASY.  I might add a little more sugar next time which I know will be soon!  Thank you!

This is a great tasting and fluffy waffle recipe.  I did make a few revisions:  1/3 c oil, 1 c wheat flour, 1 c white flour, 3 teaspoons baking soda (to cut down on that baking soda-ish taste), and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Will use again!

This recipe for Waffles is exactly what was in my old Betty Crocker cookbook.  The page has been lost in the shuffle and I was glad to find this recipe to remind me of all the right ingredients and amounts.  I sometimes make these waffles with 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup rolled oats to make it a little healthier.  I also freeze these waffles for my kids to have for breakfast throughout the week.

These were good.  I made the following changes, based on other reviews: (1) whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end and (2) doubled both the sugar and the vanilla.  Also, to make them healthier, I used 1 c. all-purpose flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/4 c. vegetable oil and 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce.  I think it could still use a little more sugar.

These are BEST waffles that I have ever made.  My family loves them.  I double the batch and freeze what is left over in a gallon size bag.  Just pop into toaster and they are just as good left over. I did not change anything in this recipe.  Try these they are AWESOME!

Wonderful!  I did not have oil, so I melted salted butter, and the waffles still turned out great.  Crisp on the outside and soft inside.

SOOO good! I did as another user suggested and folded in the egg whites at the end. It made the waffles so fluffy and delicious. I topped them with syrup mixed with strawberry preserves (heated in the microwave) and they tasted like strawberry pancakes.

I made up a batch....and froze them like the kind you buy in the store.. but better on the pocket, compared to store bought or bisquick. It only made twelve waffles, I just like to make them and stick them in a gallon size ziploc in the freezer. I do let them cool on wracks before I store them. They are good with peanut butter and syrup also. I also like to use preserves of blueberry and strawberry.

Good recipe!  Extremely light and fluffy waffles thanks to the baking soda.  Also separated the egg whites, whipped them till fluffy and folded them in at the end.  I took other suggestions and doubled the amount of vanilla and sugar.  For my personal tastes this made the waffles a bit too sweet, that I'll leave to my syrup and other toppings.  Next time I will stick to the recipe as published and will probably enjoy them even more!!!  I did however used 1/4 veg. oil and 1/4 applesauce instead of the 1/2 C oil along with a healthy tot of cinnamon which was very tasty!

Because my pancake mix had expired, I seared for a recipe from scratch. The only thing I did differently was double the amount of sugar and vanilla extract. I don't know if it was needed because I always use syrup on my waffles. I tasted it by itself, and it tasted like an average waffle! I would make this again and save money by not buying the pancake mix!

I made these waffles this morning with a few changes, and they were wonderful. They turned out so light and airy! I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and then 1 and 1/2 cups of unbleached white flour. I separated the eggs. Then beat the whites until soft peaks formed. I then folded them in at the end. I also doubled the amount of vanilla to 1 teaspoon, and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I have 6 kiddos and these were a huge hit. I hope you try it with the adjustments!

Would be perfect if they had more flavor.  I'll double the sugar and vanilla next time.  I haven't made waffles in 4 or 5 years, but I think I'll make them often after today.  Especially since I can just keep the batter in the fridge and make a couple whenever we want them.

This is a wonderful and easy waffle recipe.  I always make extra so I can freeze and pop in the toaster anytime I have a craving for waffles (which will probably be quite often with these).  I only changed one thing and that was to double the amount of sugar. Which I highly recommend as they are a little bland without doing so.  A+++++++

I'll never need another waffle recipe.  It's light and delicious.  I used another review's advice and doubled the sugar and vanilla, which I'll continue to do.  Another great thing is that it doesn't take much batter to make a waffle.  I think it's because of the amount of baking powder.  It makes the batter expand a lot in the waffle iron.

Since finding this recipe I haven't even tried another one.  The waffles are just crisp enough on the outside, but still fluffy on the inside.  They've made many happy Saturday mornings even happier!  Next time I make these I'll use 1/2 all-purpose flour, and 1/2 whole wheat.

I have given this waffle recipe a 5 star rating based on, this is the very first waffle recipe that I have ever made in my waffle maker that has worked out. The only thing I would change as others have noted here are I would increase the sugar to 2 1/2 TBS and the vanilla 1 1/2 time. Make sure you beat the eggs until they are very fluffy. This makes the difference of perfect or not perfect waffles. Also on the advice of anothr waffle review, I waited until the steam stopped pluming on the sides to dictate when the waffles are done. PERFECTION. Thanks for a great recipe.

VERY good recipe if you add 2t vanilla. Other reviewer was correct that there isn't much flavor in original recipe. Takes a little more like a sponge then a waffle. With the extra vanilla they are perfect!

Basic waffles, as far as i'm concerned.  Not bad...you can do the same thing with bisquick.  The "Cinnamon Belgian Waffles" on this site are significantly better, IMO.

I was looking for a quick, simple recipe to use with our waffle maker and this was perfect! It was easy to make - my existing recipe involved separating egg yokes and whites, etc etc, and was just too much of a pain. I tried to put a little in a pan to make pancakes too (one daughter will only eat pancakes) but it was a little thick. If I had added a little milk it would have been fine!

Would be five stars with some tweaks:  I used 1 cup unbleached white flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, increased sugar to 2 Tb., and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  On a standard square waffle iron, I used 1 cup of batter per batch.  Flash freeze on a pan for toaster waffles later in the week!  :)

I thought for sure this would be an amazing recipe after reading all these reviews.  I was wrong! I used 1 1/2 TBSP of sugar and doubled the vanilla extract to make it more sweeter.  I did everything else perfect like the recipe said.  The waffles came out very bland, not sweet at all, and the overall taste was very eggy! I don't know why, they weren't spoiled and I used 2 eggs.  I will give this recipe one more shot and add lots more sugar and vanilla extract.

Excellent!!! I made this yesterday morning and it was quick and easy (I also added cinnamon and a TBS and 1/2 extra flour). I also just topped it with a banana and whip cream for my husband and he talked about how good it was and he wants it again. That coming from a person who doesn't like waffles! Thank you for the recipe!

Made these with my boyfriend, and we loved them. Making them was a little messy, but that was more the waffle iron than this recipe. We added a little more sugar and a dash of cinnamon, and thought it was wonderful. thanks, I'll be making these again.

I think this was the best Waffle recipe that I have ever used!!!!! I beat the eggs to almost a ribbon & I also added 3/4 cup of blueberries at the end. Will do again very soon. A must to any recipe box.

We followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and they came out very, very soggy.  Not sure if it was our ancient waffle iron or simply too much liquid in the recipe.  Will not be making these again.

This recipe is a keeper with some modifications.  I made the recipe exactly as stated this time, however I see what everyone was saying about the bland flavor.  I perfer a sweeter flavor, so I will at least double the sugar next time, I will also take the opinion of other reviewers and add cinnamon and nutmeg.  I sure that will enhance the basic flavor of this recipe.

I tried this recipie after loosing my Beligian Waffle Book that came with the Waffle Maker (2 days ago).  Anyway this was great.  I think I used too much (1 cup) per waffle so they were a little heavy nexy time I will try 3/4.  I agree that it needs some cinnamon or nutmeg to give it a little more taste but very simple to make.  Great Job.

I tried this recipe when I bought a professional Belgian Waffle maker, and boy was I pleased. My husbnad who is normally not a waffle eater had two big pieces! This is the best waffle recipe ever. What I love about it is that is asks for ingredients that you normally have on hand! This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and the waffles came out perfectly.  My kids and husband all liked them too.  We made a double batch and am freezing the leftovers - so much better than any store brand waffles.  Thanks for the recipe!

After making these numerous times, my boyfriend and began to get a little bored with them, so this morning I tried adding some mashed over ripe banana and they were amazing! I halfed the recipe since it was only 2 and then added 1 1/2 over ripe bananas after beating the eggs. They weren't as crisp as without, but still amazing. Served with cooked strawberries and whipped cream, a new favourite!

Got a Mickey Mouse waffle iron as a gift and have been using the recipe(s) that came with it for years.  The two recipes that we used were always very bitter from the baking powder.

This recipe is a MAJOR improvement.  It uses twice as much baking powder as the included Mickey recipes but its not bitter at all.  It is delicious and actually pours and cooks better.

Thanks!

We thought these were quite bland, even though we increased the sugar to 3 Tbsp and vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp, I added cinnamom to the last few and that helped.  Quick and easy but we have tried other waffle recipes from this site that we liked better.

First time for waffles from scratch...this recipe is fool-proof, I followed some of the other comments advice: sifted the flour, separate the egg whites and added them last and introduced a tablespoon of honey...very nice recipe with tasty waffles!

Very tasty!!  It has a fairly fluffy texture and taste much better than the mix out of the box and takes just as much time!  Instead of vanilla extract, i used almond extract.  Topped with warmed organic maple syrup and berry trinity (strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries) marinated in sugar and lemon.  DELISH!  My son LOVED it...  I also made it for dessert last night with vanilla extract.  Made a whipped cream and strawberry preserve waffle sandwich. yum. ...

Great recipe. Turned out nice and crisp. I folded in the egg whites as recommended. I also added more vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and fresh blueberries. I make a ton and freeze the waffles for toaster waffles later. It's our healthy breakfast on the go. I did not add extra sugar and I used a mixture of whole wheat/white and spelt flour.

This was my first attempt making waffles from scratch rather than using a commercial mix. Easy recipe to follow and assemble. I whisked wet ingredients and sifted in dry. I added approx. 1 TBSP more sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I used a 1/3 measure (plus a bit more) to fill my iron. I found them light and fluffy, but I missed the crispness of the commercial mix. Excellent flavor. The family loved them and asked for more.

I made almost the exact same recipe this morning, but I only used 3 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. vanilla. I just bought a Black & Decker Belgin waffle maker, nothing fancy and had the waffles this morning and warmed one up when I got home from work...yummy! They were very good.  They are best when cooked 4-5 minutes for me. The first two were in for 5-6 and were just a tad too crispy for me. This batch made 6 qty. 8" waffles using just a little more than 1/2 cup of batter.

I really enjoyed these.  I used a tiny bit less baking powder than called for (because I was just about out), but these things came out perfectly golden, perfect consistency and were delicous.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely make these again!

The first batch tasted too baking powder-ey, so I added another tablespoon of sugar and another half-teaspoon of vanilla and that fixed them up just fine. These still weren't what I was looking for. All told, though, it's a good 'straight-up' waffle recipe.

I've tried several waffle recipes and this is our family favorite.  Gets rave reviews when we serve to overnight guests.  Light and crispy on the outside and so easy to make!  My kids especially love them when I add semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter!  I prefer my plain, with or without syrup. I often use half wheat flour to add a little more fiber and the kids don't even notice.  A definite must for your recipe box.

This is a very good waffle recipe.  It makes a batch of waffles quick and easy.  The waffles come out light and crisp....just perfect.  I typically add a little more sugar than the recipe calls for because I prefer my waffles a little sweeter.

Ok.  We like a little bit denser and moister.  Good quick recipe though.

Simple yet light and delicious.  Accidentally added 1/2 tsp. of salt instead of 1/4 and it still turned out well.

This recipes is a keeper.  I used room temp buttermilk rather than regular milk.  They also freeze well.  No more store bought frozen waffles for me.

These were delicious. I did heed others' advice and added an extra tablespoon of sugar and about a teaspoon of cinnamon. But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and the waffles came out perfectly!

Finally, a good recipe that doesn't require whipping the egg whites.  Light and crisp.  I use hand mixer for the eggs and the batter.  Used vanilla sugar and 1 t vanilla.

These waffles are a staple at my house.  I use whole wheat flour, but add some semi-sweet chocolate chips for the kids, and with a light dab of powdered sugar, it doesn't need syrup.  For the adults, I add chopped pecans.  Delicious!!  The texture is wonderful, and with the bit of salty waffle taste, it goes great with some added sweetness.  If you're worried about it being bland, add extra vanilla extract, and have fun with the add-ins.

Yum!!  Pretty darn good - especially considering it was my first time making them from scratch.  I doubled the recipe (to have some left to freeze).  I ended up using about half milk and half buttermilk ('cause I had some on hand) - which made the batter really thick.  Probably would've been better as written.  :)  I also added a little vanilla bean - again I had it on hand.  They had a REALLY good flavor - yummy.

From all the great reviews I guess I was expecting more. As written the recipe is pretty bland. Quicker and tastier to just use a box mix.

MY KIDS LOVED THESE WAFFLES!!  They were easy to prepare and cook too!  I gave the recipe 4 stars only because I thought they were a bit bland and a little eggy tasting, but that was if they were eaten plain, which is not normally how I eat them, but I just took a taste while I made them for my kids.  But I know I'll be making these again very soon!

This recipe was good, but bland. We doubled the sugar and added cinnamon and cocolate chips, and still felt they were lacking in the flavor dept. The cure, melted butter mixed with brown sugar, it made a nice dipping sauce for these waffles.

Whoever suggested to mix this up in a blender is a genius! I was skeptical, but it worked great. Easy mixing, pouring & cleanup! I used 1/2 wheat flour and half regular ~ anything to make things a little healthier. Delicious!

These are the best waffles I've ever had in my life.  They were a huuuge hit.  So light and fluffy, yet with a yummy a tad crispy outside.  This recipe deserves 5 stars for sure!  I didn't have enough oil, so I used half oil and half apple sauce and it turned out great.  Yum yum.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I will use it again for sure!

These waffles are a big hit. I have made them at least a dozen times now.  Everyone loves them.  We top them with fresh strawberries, syrup and vanilla ice cream.....YUMMY! All I did was add a little more vanilla to the recipe because it just adds a little more flavour. For sure a keeper!

The base is great, but not flavorful enough for me (or sweet, but I'm such a sweet tooth, I won't score it down for that)... I ended up using a full tablespoon of vanilla extract and 4 tablespoons sugar and added a tablespoon of cinnamon for more flavor. 
Its entirely up to you what you add anyway- next time: BERRIES!

I never liked making waffles because of the cook time and mess but this recipe makes it well worth it.  Absolutely love the taste and the smell is so inviting.  I follow the recipe exactly with the addition of some cinnamon, nutmeg, and additional suger.  My husband looks forward to Sunday because it is now known as waffle day.  Thanks OP!

I have a waffle iron that must be 55+years old with iron waffle/sandwich changeable grids which all my family covets and I refuse to give up.  This recipe is a superior one but I made some changes.  I used part melted butter with the oil, used Splenda + 1 T for the sugar, 1 egg + 1 egg equivalent Egg Beaters for the 2 eggs, 1t. ground ginger.  The result was delicious and lower in calories than the original.  Highly recommend this to any waffle enthusiast!

I give this receipe a 5 star as the waffles turned out very good. I modified this slightly by increasing the sugar to 2bsp and the vanilla to 
1 1/2 tsp just to give it a little sweeter taste. I alos sometimes add Pecans. They were great! My family loves them.

My husband usually takes a few bites and then eats all the bacon and with this recipe he ate the whole plate!  We got one of those flip waffle irons and it was awesome!

used this batter 5 days after i made it and it was just as good as the first day - it's hard to find a recipe that keeps as well.  just follow these directions, exactly, and you'll have success.  if you don't want to add the sugar, don't!  just a really solid, basic, good recipe.  thanks!

These are the best waffles I have ever made.  Added some frozen blueberries to my husbands' portion and with or without they were a big hit with my whole family.

These tasted pretty good but were thick and dense.  I added cinnomon, cinnamon vanilla spice, nutmeg and more vanilla. I however did use apple sauce and considering the popularity of these waffles I think that was my mistake. They werent light and fluffy but even so tasted good so I suggest to use the oil or at least go half and half.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. I doubled the vanilla and added cinnamon but they were still bland. They didn't turn out if I sprayed the waffle iron first. They were much more fluffy and crispy without the spray.

I’ve made these twice and they were just okay. My son, who loves waffles, hasn't asked for them again. I cooked them extra long to get them to be a little more crunchy. It’s my first time making a homemade mix for waffles, so I think I’ll try other recipes to compare.

Consistency was there, fluffy and light. However, it was lacking flavor. I did add a little brown sugar and double the vanilla but it was still lacking some flavor. Otherwise, it was fabulous and I will stick with this recipe but will play with it every time I make it to find that little something it is missing.

These were very good-- my only advice is to be sure not to under-do them! My iron says the waffles are "done" before they actually are, so make sure yours does not do the same! (Underdone, they come out soggy).

I decreased the servings down to 2 since it is only my husband and myself.  I had run out of my usual waffle mix and tried this one.  I will be making this from now on.  I goofed and put two teaspoons vanilla in it istead 1/8 teaspoon.  I will continue to make it that way.  My husband even agreed they were better then the others I have made.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent. Made in a blender, doubled the vanilla. Used 1 T. brown and 1 T. white sugar. Next time I might try a little almond extract or banana flavoring to give it more flavor. Made exactly 6 belgian waffles. Will definitely make again, and stop looking for other waffle recipes.

These were really good I halfed the baking powder and doubled the sugar and vanilla.  I also substituted 1c of flour for whole wheat.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were really fantastic waffles. My husband (strangely) doesn't usually like homemade waffles, and prefers the mix, but these are great, and will be my new standby recipe! Thanks!

good... the key is to keep the batter thin when pouring onto the waffle maker, it puffs up very big. so spread a little batter around with a spoon....

This recipe is fantastic, it's a lifesaver in the morning, too! It's crisy on the outside and soft inside, I haven't tried using wholewheat yet, but will soon.

Great recipe for subbing some whole wheat flour. I did half wheat & half white. I added 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar and doubled the vanilla. I think I only used 3 tsp. of baking powder. Yummy!

Ugh - I'm SO stuffed!  Very good waffles - crispy and light, unless you eat 400 of them like I just did.  My waffle maker is a sad little thing, and they still turned out great, which makes me think I need to invest in a better machine and really blow my family away.

Just got through making this recipe for the first time.  I gave it five stars because it was very easy to make and the outcome was a good tasting, good looking waffle.  It tastes like what you'd expect from a traditional waffle.  I don't make waffles too often, but I would use this recipe again when the time comes.

I read reviews and noticed some saying they lacked flavor. Others saying they were a little too oily. So, I used fat free sour cream in place of the oil. This does change the texture some but it adds a good flavor. Try it!

Taste was okay, but had a bit of an oily texture (due to the 1/2 cup oil). The oil also messes with my wife's digestive system, so I can't make this recipe.

These waffles came out a beautiful golden brown and were crispy on the outside and cakey on the inside. They are a little bland, so I threw a few chocolate chips on to the batter after I poured it on the iron.

Sooooo good!!  I doubled this to keep in the fridge.  Super quick breakfast!  I used applesauce instead of the oil, and 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 all purpose flour.  I also doubled the vanilla.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I agree with most--a very good base recipe!  I reduced milk to 1 cup (skim) and added 3/4 cup sour cream, doubled the sugar and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Came out great in a belgian iron!  
Next will try a little kahlua in the milk and some nutmeg in the flour...

Not bad.  We substituted apple sauce for part of the oil.  We increased from 6 servings to 9; however, the batter came out too runny.  Will probably cut back milk from 3 C. to 2 or 2-1/4 C. (for 9 servings).

The taste was good, had nice even color and that's really about it.  Took  3 times as long to cook these as my usual waffles and even then they were still chewy.  My family prefers a crisper waffle then I was able to make with this recipe.

I left all the oil out of this recipe by mistake and guess what? Still very good. Perhaps next time I would add just a little oil. Great taste!

Nice and fluffy in the middle and best of all crispy on the outside!  My only suggestion would be to up the sugar to maybe 1 1/2 TB or even 2 TB...I doubled the recipe for the kids to eat during the week in the morning before school.  Toast some pecans and add bananas with maple syrup. (drool)

I was planning a brunch for my "twins" birthday.  This recipe is a keeper. The waffles were light and crispy.  Other recipes I have tried turn out soggy.  Since I doubled the recipe, I had leftovers.  I froze the leftovers.  Just pop them in the toaster and they make a great quick breakfast.

I can't tell you just how goooood this mix was, it was that gooood, lol. It's adaptable and I love the fact that you can have a batch kept ready in the fridge, though I could never do that as my children wanted a lot (3x) that my waffle iron busted, lol! I only use self rising with scant 3/4 tbls baking powder and also with buttermilk and half melted butter and 1/2 oil .. my family went gaga over these, easy, fluffy, moist, tasty and crispy yet soft. Excellent.

This recipe is great!  It always works for us!  It is great as is, and we have also used whole wheat flour... we have added extra sugar, extra vanilla, cinnamon, or fruit!  The kids want to try chocolate chips tonight!  :)  Thanks for this recipe!

I make this recipe often, and it always turns out very well. I make it vegan by substituting two tablespoons ground flax seed and six tablespoons water for the eggs and soymilk. (I usually up the soymilk to two cups.) Generally I substitute whole wheat flour for white flour. I also add double the sugar called for and a generous dash of cinnamon. A great way to start the morning!

I made this on the spur of the moment this morning before getting my son ready for daycare.  Absolutely simple to make and tasted great.  I substituted Egg Beaters and used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour.  This turned out as good if not better than the boxed waffle mixes I have used in the past.  Definitely will make this again.

Easy and yummy, I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour, delicious.  Also, I sprinkled some blueberries and pecans onto the batter before I closed the lid and it worked out perfectly, Thanks.

This is the first time I've had success with a waffle recipe. I made the healthy substitutions: some wheat flower for white flour, some applesauce for oil, etc. The only thing that I may not do again is substitute Egg Beaters for eggs - the waffles were a little denser than my family liked. But the flavor and ease were great. This recipe is a keeper.

I doubled the sugar and vanilla as other reviewers suggested, and this recipe came out great.  The first few I made turned out rather eggy, but then I used less batter and spread it with a ladle to completely cover the iron before I closed it.  They came out light and crispy; the best scratch recipe I've found so far.  They're great frozen and toasted as well.  Next time I think I'll try the cinnamon suggestion.  Thank you!

This was my first time making waffles from scratch and they were delicious.I added an xtra tbs sugar. My whole family loved them. I forgot about the last one on the waffle iron and it was even more delicious and crunchy. My son and I dipped it in syrup. Yummy. Like a cookie.

Pretty good.  The batter was a little bit too watery.  Needs a bit more sugar.  Needs to add cinnamon.

I think I finally found the perfect waffle recipe!!  I did add just a tad more sugar to mine, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Taste just like something you'd get out of a restaurant.  Will definately be making these again and again!

We loved these. Mu husband actually said I could stop looking for the "one" waffle recipe for us to use. I really liked not having to separate eggs. I replaced about 1/2 cup flour for whole wheat.

I had only used my waffle iron once before and that was with a boxed mix.  I thought this recipe was VERY easy and VERY good.  Actually, it was MUCH better than the boxed mix.  I would make this recipe again.

Absolutely wondeful.  This was my first attempt at waffles & they were great.  I made the minor adjustment of doubling the sugar & vanilla.  I seperated the eggs & folded the whites in at the end.

Great recipe. The waffles are fluffy and delicous.
I used equal parts evaporated milk and water instead of the milk, as I was out, and they turned out great.

Excellent basic waffle batter!  I followed the advise to double the sugar and vanilla, and I also used wheat fluor and added chopped walnuts to my husbands and he **loved** it!  Thanks for this recipe :-)

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great!!
I added a little extra sugar, about a teaspoon and it was just right. I will definately make this again.
