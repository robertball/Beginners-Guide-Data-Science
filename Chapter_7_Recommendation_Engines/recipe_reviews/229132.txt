This was my first sirloin tip roast that I bought on sale.  With the increased cost of food, we miss our rib eyes and filets.  Since there were no ratings, I was hesitant.  Glad I didn't pass this one by!  I used a rub from herb-rubbed sirloin tip roast from this site.  I let the rub marinate all day.  I used fresh mushrooms of 8 oz sliced button and 8 oz. sliced baby bellas.  It looked like way too much shrooms, but it wasn't!  I also threw in some sweet onion slices then covered with the dry soup and broth.  Roasted about the 90 min., and it was perfect medium rare.  The dry soup became a bit crunchy, which was great.  Served it with Hasselback potatoes also from this site, and steamed broccoli.  I give it 5 stars, and glad to be the first to rate it.  Give it a try

SIMPLE and both kids at the table were in the 'Clean Plate Club'.  Looking very forward to the leftovers recreated as an open faced sandwich on crunchy farm bread, thinking of adding a savory cheese.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars b/c I am sure its wonderful as is.  As a matter of fact, my mother made her roasts very similar and they were delicious.  However, I changed it rather drastically.  I used a montreal-type seasoning blend with extra thyme and garlic powder coated all over the roast, liberally.  Then browned hard and fast, normal pan, high heat.  Transferred roast to ceramic casserole.  blended pan juices with broth, red wine and just a touch of liquid smoke and worcestershire. added to roast, baked for 1 hour at 350 for rare-mid-rare center.  poured juices from pan back to skillet.  Added half a sliced onion, a cup of quartered fresh mushrooms, about a tablespoon of whole peppercorns, a few thin slices of beef leg bone with marrow, a bay leaf, garlic powder and fresh thyme.  reduced by almost half.  meanwhile, made a 'scratch roux', which is just some melted butter whisked constantly with regular flour over med heat until it turns from buttery yellow to deep gold (just long enuf to kill the raw flour taste and make sure its whisked super smooth).  Add to reduction, whisk again to blend gravy, slice your roast, serve mushroom/onion/peppercorn gravy over top.  DELICIOUSNESS.  Thank you for the inspiration Jim!

Ninety minutes? Mine was overcooked at thirty. I was aiming for medium rare, but within less than half an hour internal temp was around 150. I checked the temp thinking I'd get an idea on how long I had to wait before prepping the sides, not to find out it was done. Thankfully, the gravy saved it. It's a good idea, but maybe a lower oven temp would help.

Perfect. I used Shiitake mushrooms. As I only had a 1.5 lb top sirloin joint I halved the ingredients. Even though I over cooked the meat the meal was still scrumptious. I also cooked Hasselback potatoes, baked asparagus and broccoli drizzled in a butter/balsamic/soy sauce.  Five plus stars.

First time making a roast and first time using my new ceramic coated cast iron casserole was made easy with this recipe. I wasn't sure whether I should keep the lid on, but decided it would be best, and it worked out well. Searing took about 5 minutes per side before adding the other ingredients and putting in the oven. I used 3 cans of sliced mushrooms instead of 4 cans of pieces since my roast was a bit less than 3lbs.  I cooked mine a bit faster/more than planned (to 155 degrees). One mistake: make sure to mix the corn starch with cool broth - it will clump if you put straight into the hot liquid. As suggested by Gymrat, I served this with Hassleback potatoes. I don't usually eat beef OR mushrooms and I enjoyed this. My hubby said, and I quote, "Now THIS is a meal!" He even went for seconds!

This was bad.  The meat was tough and salty.  This could easily be remedied- turn this into a crock pot recipe, use 50/50 beef broth to water to cover meat.  Also needs pepper.  As is, my husband and daughter only ate enough not to be rude and afterwards let me know just how bad it had been.

This was DELICIOUS!  I've never used this cut of meat before and found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. I didn't have mushrooms so I threw some carrots in and made the rest as directed.  Absolutely fabulous!  Thank you for this recipe!

I made a few changes.  I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned ones,  1 Shallot finely sliced, 2 cups of water, 1/2 tsp Thyme crushed by rubbing freshly in my palm and 1 tsp of Herbs de Provence also crushed in the palm of my hand and rubbed over the meat.

I served this with sautéed asparagus with shallots and mushrooms done in 1 Tbsp of olive oil and fresh mashed potatoes with ranch dressing mixed into the potatoes (1/4 c ranch dressing replacing some of the milk while making the potatoes).

read reviews - baked 30 minutes in oven covered (350).  made mushroom sauce and poured over sliced roast, back in pan, back to oven, covered and baked  at 275 for 1 hour.   This was sooo good. Will make again.  Longer cooking at 275 tenderized roast.   Used button and portabella mushrooms.

Tried it first time and it's a winner!
I used fresh mushrooms (shitake & portobellos)with my own beef broth mixture made with Marsala wine.  Added some chopped carrots, celery and potatoes and 90 minutes later the internal temp. read 150F.  The meat was tasty, but chewy which I prefer over a mealy texture.
Next time I'll use a 3-4lb roast (mine was 2.3lbs) and add in more veggies like red & green peppers.   I may make this for Thanksgiving along with the Turkey.
Thanks for a simple and hearty repast that even brought a smile to my wife's critical palate.

Didn't change anything but I did add about a cup of burgundy wine and used fresh mushrooms.  Wonder flavor.  Will be making again.

I didn't have enough mushrooms but it turned out real tender. I baked it an additional 1/2 hour. Didn't want it to be quite so pink inside. When making the mushroom gravy, I needed to add more beef broth to make enough gravy for the whole roast. The longer time in the oven evaporated a lot of the juice.

I thought the soup mix gave this an artificial flavor' nothing like a homemade gravy. The addition of a liquid to the pan with this cut also changed the usual juicy steak texture to one that tasted stewed. I love tri tip, but won’t be repeating this.

Mushroom lovers dream meal. I followed the recipe as published except cut down on cooking time to 40 minutes. The meat was moist and the onion gravy with all the mushrooms was awesome.

I have made this for years! It is a basic tried and true recipe.  Raised my 3 boys and this was a favourite.  I have also made the same with moose meat (if you live where this is available usually from a hunter).  Try with any meat that needs to be slow cooked in moisture.  The addition of mushrooms is new for me but a great addition!

Absolutely delicious!!! Watch the time on your meat, we cooked a slightly more than 2 pound roast 40 minutes  The mushroom gravy was possibly the best gravy I have ever tasted!  Followed the recipe exactly, a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I didn't want to spend 90 minutes cooking on a weeknight, so I cooked for 30 minutes the night before and then 30 minutes the night that we ate it and it was rare to medium rare, which is how I like it.  The gravy turned out nice but there wasn't much of it and needed salt and pepper.

All the people on here that are trying to cook a good piece of sirloin tip like a pot roast, your ruining it. That's why its tough and chewy.  Either that or your using the wrong cut.

I wish I would have read the review by Chris W. before I made this. It seemed dry to me.  The gravy was delicious though.  I probably will go back to my old standby of choosing a chuck roast next time.

Family loved this recipe. Only thing I did different was used fresh mushrooms instead of can mushrooms.  Will be making this recipe again and making it a family regular meal.

90 Minutes was way to long to cook!  Also added red wine and worchestershire to gravy with lots of black pepper.

I too, had a medium well done roast after 60 minutes.  Could it be because I covered it?  The recipe never states covered or uncovered for 90 minutes.  Roast is tough but flavorful.

I made this for my husband's birthday dinner, and the only changes were to add a sliced onion, two cloves of minced garlic and fresh mushrooms instead of canned, sauteing them after browning the roast. My oven temp must be a little cooler than the author's, because the roast was perfectly medium-rare after 90 minutes. Reading other reviews was helpful, as it made me aware of vast fluctuations in doneness, so I simply checked the internal temp frequently after an hour. Everyone loved this recipe. The sauce was perfect. We're looking forward to the leftovers. Thanks, JimChicago!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I like mushrooms but didn't put in as many as called for. Still I will be making this recipe again.

Excellent. I didn't have the exact ingredients (garlic and herb dry salad dressing mix instead of onion soup mix) but the cooking method is right on! Super simple too.

My husband always told me he doesn't like roast beef, until I served this tonight. Excellent. The meat was very tender and the mushroom gravy was fantastic! I will definitely make this again.
