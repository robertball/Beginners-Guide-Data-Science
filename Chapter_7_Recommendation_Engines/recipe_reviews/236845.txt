This was my first time ever baking a ham, & it turned out to be a HIT!!! I modified the recipe a little. I had to cook my ham in a roaster, so to start off I dumped 2 16oz bottles of Verners ginger ale in the bottom of the roaster. I made up my mixture, placed the ham inside & then basted it with the mixture. I then tooth picked 1 can of pineapple rings to the ham & basted it more. I cooked this ham at 275 for 45, basted the ham with whatever mixture I had left. Then cooked it for 45 more min at 350.  Turned out Great!!! I can't wait to cook a whole bone in ham again!

This glaze was a hit with those that like glazed ham.  I heated the ham in a turkey sized cooking bag with a little ginger ale.   Once warm, I took some of the ham and glazed it and left the rest I plain.   This worked well for everyone.  Remember, ham is fully cooked to begin with, I recommend heating at a lower temperature to avoid it dry out.

The only thing I changed was to adjust the time for my oven, which runs a bit hot. We all loved it and my boys ate big portions each! Me too. :) I was really surprised so little soda wetted out the mixture but it worked perfectly.

I made a 9.5 spiral sliced ham. Everyone loved it. I will be doing it again next week for a different group.  I did bake it at 250 degrees, so it took longer but didn’t dry out.

This recipe is phenomenal!  The second time I made it, I didn’t have any ginger ale, unfortunately.  Instead, I packed all of the dry ingredients on the ham before baking.  I couldn’t believe how good it was!  It turned the brown sugar from a glaze into a crust.  I think it tasted as good as the one you can buy from the overpriced ham store.

This recipe was outstanding. It was so good I made 3 more dishes with the ham throughout the week. Split ham and pea soup, my husband ate this for dessert, truly. Scalloped ham and potatoes. And last but not least, homemade mac-n-cheese with chunks of ham. 10 out of 10. I will most certainly be preparing a ham this way again. Thanks All Recipes.

Exactly what I wanted - I did double the recipe except for the dry mustard, kept that at 2 tbsp.  Will definitely make again.

The dry mustard gave it the right flavor for us. We love the tanginess.

This was the first time I have ever made a ham. I was concerned about it being over cooked and dry. But it turned out AMAZING!!!! OMG it was so juicy and flavorful I could not believe it. My whole family enjoyed it and complemented me all night on how delicious it was. I don’t usually like to alter recipes on my first try but I did not have ginger ale so I used sprite but everything else was as the recipe called. This was great!!! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe with everyone!!!

Delicious!!  Only had regular yellow mustard on hand. Doubled glaze recipe for my 11pound ham and it was fantastic!  This will be my baked ham recipe from now on.

I used this recipe for the mustard ham glaze and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. I would however, recommend that  nutritional content should list serving size otherwise it is useless.
