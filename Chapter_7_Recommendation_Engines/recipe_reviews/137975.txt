EXCELLENT Recipe! I'm half Armenian and this is good stuff! The only thing to add is just a pinch of white vinegar, it helps to take away the strong taste of the lamb. Other than that, this recipe is perfect

This was ok, I was hoping for somthing great. My hubby is half armenian & I made this to surprise him. The lamb was pretty good, but we were both hoping for it to be a little more saucey. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Not sure if I will make it again, but if I do...I will definatley have to spice it up a bit. Too plain for our taste.

Great dish!!  Very easy to make and delicious!!  The meat comes out tasting wonderful and very tender - even after my husband cooked it just a tad too long! Will definitely make again!

As a fellow "Armo" it was wonderful to see this recipe here! :) I made a few adjustments, use red wine instead of white and lots of fresh parsley instead of the dried herbs and marinade this all with onions overnight! THE BEST!

I was using beef so we liked this recipe very much.  Normally when we cook lamb we use greek marinades which have a heavy flavor of lemon and seasonings.  This was lighter and did not overpower the beef.  I did not follow the instructions on how to cook the kabobs though - did it my usual way.  Thanks submitter.

This is really good! Made exactly as stated except used beef. It turned out totally tender! It was just a round steak chunk too. Thanks for sharing! Served with armenian pilaf and placed skewer on two warm tortilla shells to pull off of skewer and wrap.

I was raised on this stuff and if you dont burn the edges just a little its not as good, and yes my mom and grandma used a burgundy wine to marinade if you do this for at least 24 hrs 48 is better the flavor is out of this world now I need a film a recipe grape leaves are the key 
Ps grandfather came from Turkey when he was 12 so my mom was 1/2 
Thanks

My first attempt at Lamb Shish Kabobs....it was Awesome !  We raise lamb and sell meats, so I am trying different recipes to recommend to our customers.  This is wonderful and easy.  I omitted the wine since I didn't have any.  Cooked this up for a tasting gathering and all enjoyed.  Make sure you have good lamb, preferably from the farmer who raised it. Check out your local farm markets. Makes a difference. And we appreciate your support.

Made this recipe for company last night, everyone loved it including my husband who doesn"t like lamb. I did not use a leg of lamb, just got lamb cubes from Whole Foods butcher, just made it easier. Definetaly will make again!!
