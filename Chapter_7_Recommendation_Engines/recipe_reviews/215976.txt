My husband and I really enjoyed this soup and will make again. Since I made it on the fly, I did not use the sugar pumkins. As an after thought, was wondering if the sugar pumkins would add more flavor. The whole process was very easy. Thanks for posting this recipe Sandi!

Holy nutmeg batman!  I had really high hopes for this recipe based on the previous reviews, but it just didn't work for me.  It tasted more like carrot nutmeg soup and the squash didn't come through.  I was hesitant to put that much nutmeg in & I should have followed my instincts.  It took a lot of "fixing" to make it edible for us...more squash and the addition of brown sugar in an attempt to cut back on the spice.  It needed a lot more time to simmer before coming to the right consistency.  Sorry, but I won't be using this recipe again...

My family loved this.  Made it with pumpkin rather than butternut (used uncarved pumpkin off my front porch).  Also skipped serving it in a pumpkin.  Flavor was great - our new favorite.

Very good all round.  A little strong on the nutmeg, but my wife liked it that way, so cheers.  The sugar pumpkins were a little hard to find, but did find them at the local Co-Op, addressed as sugar pie pumpkins.

Used half canned pumpkin and half butternut squash. Overall delicious... but could use less nutmeg and more seasoning (I added garlic).

What a comforting and delicious  soup.  Just what you need for these cooler evenings.  As per other reviews, I cut down on the nutmeg considerably. ( a little less than a tsp)

I needed a pumpkin soup recipe, and thought I'd try this, substituting a roasted cheese pumpkin for squash.  Also, I accidentally grabbed dried thyme off of the shelf instead of nutmeg and sprinkled it in the soup before I realized that I grabbed the wrong thing.  Adding nutmeg at this point didn't sound like a good idea, so I added a dash of sage instead.  Very, very good!  I didn't bother with the sugar pumpkins to serve the soup.
