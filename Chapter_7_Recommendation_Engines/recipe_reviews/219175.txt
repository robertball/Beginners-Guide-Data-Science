This is a good recipe, but let's be honest; three ounces of bacon isn't enough to warrant the use of "bacon" in the name . You know where I'm going with this.

Do it. Go for the whole pound.

This is so yummy. I made two batches; the first one as stated and the second one with some tweeks of my own. The ingredints sounded quite good, but I'm not a fan of bacon bits. The second batch I added a few things and I thought it had gone from good to great. The second time I added crushed crisp bacon pieces and some sliced black olives. Both bowls of dip disappeared at about the same rate, so I think if you care for the flavor of bacon bits, it's a hit. I definitely will make the dip again. Cheese dip doesn't last long here and I'm always looking out for new ways to make it. I like to spread the warm cheese dip on hot rolls or a slice of hot crusty bread. Oh, yum!!

This is a really good dip!  I agree with the other reviewers- using more bacon bits makes this much tastier.  I also added an envelope of ranch dressing/dip mix.  We served this dip with waffle fries and it was delicious and everyone loved it.

It's not the most complex, beautiful, or unusual dip, to be sure.  But for ease of preparation and crowd appeal, it gets four stars.  I served it baked in a hollowed round bread loaf. If you buy the precut green onions in your produce section, you have a nice little dip with about one minute's prep.  Definitely use the REAL bacon bits (Hormel or Oscar Mayer both have good ones), not those pebble-like things.

I thought it was very good.  I followed the recipe. Instead of using bacon bits, I cooked a whole pound of bacon until crisp, then crumbled it.  Just out of curiosity, I weighed it and it came out to just under 4 oz. Wow!  I was surprised at that.  I think the next time I make it, I'll try adding a little horseradish to it.

Good bacon dip.  I used a pound of bacon and about 5 green onions.  Made it for Turkey Day, yesterday, and the bowl was cleaned! :)

Really good recipe.  I did use 16 oz of "real" bacon and also added Rotel tomatoes with green chilis as well as what someone else suggested, a packet of dry ranch dressing.

This dip was fabulous and a hit at our Christmas party.  I used 6 oz REAL bacon bits and added a bit of ranch powder.  Served with bagel chips.  My husband said the best part for him was the little bit of green onion in every bite to cut down on the richness - don't skimp on the onion and dice it small!!

I love love dips!!! This was a recipe I found on the back of a package bacon when I lived in Texas and it was very difficult to find the exact same recipe after moving to Georgia.  And guess what? I found it and still love it the same. The only difference is that I added up to 2pckage of bacon (not bacon bits) and put just a 1/4 cup of sharp cheese to spice up the taste just a little.  I love it so much!!! Oh if you do not like the green onions use green peppers still yummy!!!

Great party dip!! I did make a few  adjustments to the original recipe using a full pound of fresh bacon(baked in the oven for perfect crispness) and also added a pack of ranch mix to give it more flavor.  I also added a little cheddar cheese and additional green onions on top garnish before baking!

I made this twice and the original recipe is really good.  The second time I made it I added some finely chopped red bell pepper.  What an amazing flavour it brought to this dish!

I really liked this dip. I do agree with some of the other reviewers, more bacon would be nice, but because of the price of bacon right now, I didn't add a whole lot. I didn't have any onions, but it tasted great without it, though I did add salt. This is a wonderful recipe, and I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. I had it with regular potato chips and it was WONDERFUL!!

This is a really good dip, but I cooked a pound of bacon in the oven and chopped it in s food processor. So much better! I only gave it 4 stars if it's made with bacon bits.

I made this completely without the cheddar cheese and served it cool/room temp.  It needs some salt, but is an excellent consistency.

This is so addictive!  I made this for a party and everyone gobbled it up.   The flavors blend perfectly together.  I did use real bacon, not bacon bits.   Next time I will do as other reviewers suggested and add more bacon and/or sharp cheese.

Really good!  It is a tad bit on the rich side, but I think maybe cutting back on the cream cheese just a little but will help that.  I did not use bacon bits, I used fresh bacon.  Will make again.

It was the best dip ever and was a big hit. I recommend that you only use 1/2 a cup of the green onion and it won't taste so oniony

You had me at CREAMY BACON...Made this for a potluck and it went in no time flat!  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I did "go for it" and added a full pound of cooked bacon, it was worth it!  Used both potato chips and thinly sliced baguette for dipping.

My family loves it and is so simple to make. In reading the comments, I think there is some confusion on how much bacon to use.  If you are cooking and crumbling real bacon yourself, use the whole  1 lb package. If you are using the jar of bacon bits, use the 3 oz.

we all loved this recipe.  it was easy and delicious.  I use 2.8 oz jar of Real Bacon Bit found in the salad dressing aisle (believe me - it was enough bacon).   Saving this recipe in My Box to make again n again.

This was good, but did taste like it was missing something.  I added pepper, garlic and some saute onions. I did uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes so the cheese would brown and give some texture. Next time I'll use more bacon bits or fry some up and use that instead.  I'll also add some smoky paprika and gouda cheese.

My family Loved this! Served with small french baguette. I did double the bacon and put a few extra green onions in. Very yummy!
