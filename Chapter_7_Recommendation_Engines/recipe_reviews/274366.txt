This was incredibly tender and tasty.  So much better than ground beef.  Be sure to watch the video for some valuable tips.  Next time I will try using gorgonzola cheese for a different taste.  

I also made a second burger without blue cheese for my wife, but the burger fell apart while cooking.  I will try some cheddar the next time in hopes of keeping the burger together.  Does anyone have any ideas on this?

Best burger I have ever made!!  It will be hard to buy store bought ground beef ever again.
