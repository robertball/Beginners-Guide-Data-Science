Sorry, Jim, but these were awful.  With all the powdered milk, they didn't even smell good.  The batter was too thick.  I ended up adding about half a cup of sugar and a cup of water before my kids would eat them, then they joked about using them as hockey pucks because they were so tough.

Wonderful and special.  A little heavy so it doesn't take many to fill up on and so delicious!  If I wanted somebody to remember me for my waffles, this is the recipe to do it.  Sweet but not too much so....liked it better with with a drizzle of light corn syrup than the maple syrup (of course, butter).  Next time, I will separate the eggs and whip up the whites separately and fold them in at the end to see if they would be more airy and lighter.

Wish I would have gone by the three stars and skipped this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a plate size belgian waffle baker and it made six. They looked and smelled nice but the taste was lacking and the texture was way too chewy.  I can't imagine if I had made these on a traditional waffle iron, where they would have been thinner -- they would have tasted like rubber -- or a hockey puck as another reviewer mentioned.  They were way too heavy and had little flavor. If you've ever had a good waffle these are unacceptable. Sorry, Jim! If for some reason you still want to try this good luck, but be prepared to be dissapointed.

I used a little less powdered milk after being scared by the first guy, but other than that followed it and it came out nice and sweet with absolutely no complaints.  I think they were delicious, and plan to use this recipe a lot in the future.  It makes a nice variation in the breakfast routine.

You can always just plain use milk, and skip the powdered milk and water “problem.”  But I find the idea of using powdered milk to be a nice alternative...for those days when there is no milk in the house...you can still make a really nice breakfast!

The batter was EXTREMELY thick, so I did add more water to reach the right consistency, and I cut back the cinnamon because I think it would have overwhelmed the apples.  These waffles were tough and dry.

I have to agree that I did not like this recipe at all.  Admittedly, I made a few changes--I substituted apple pie filling for the apples and adjusted other ingredients accordingly--but I still was very disappointed with these waffles.  We ate 1 1/2 and threw the rest away.  Perhaps if I had followed the recipe exactly they would have been better.  Or perhaps these particular waffles don't suit my family's taste.

after reading the reviews I added 2 tsp baking powder,  omitted 1 Apple and added applesauce, vanilla and omitted dry milk and water and added whole milk instead. My family loved it!

These waffles were very good.  My family loved them. I will be making them again.
