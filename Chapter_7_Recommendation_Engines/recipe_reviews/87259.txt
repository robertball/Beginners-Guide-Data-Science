I did this as a side dish and pretty last minute for 14 people. (pressure) i left out all onions. It was just string beans and the Garlic Salt, Garlic Powder, and Pepper. It was amazing, had several people tell me it was the most suprising part of the dish. Plus, it was very easy to make! Totally recommend it.

I needed something different for fresh string beans and this seemed easy enough.  I liked sauteeing the beans and the garlic powder was good, although I think I will use fresh diced garlic next time.  My husband didn't like the flavor from the cocktail onions, I think since it's mostly vinegar!  I thought it added a little punch without being overly powerful, but next time I will try the onions themselves without the liquid. Overall, we enjoyed this for a simple, but different way to eat the same old (but yummy) side dish.

Wonderful dish.  We gobbled them up.  I omitted the onions and added lots of grated parmesan.  The parmesan was a delicious touch!

So easy to make yet absolutely delicious.  I replaced the cocktail onions, with a quarter cup of white onions.  Served over rice for a quick lunch.  Loved it!

I make these all the time.  I substitute red pepper strips for the marinated onions, though.  More color and flavor!

I will try this next time without the marinated cocktail onions.  It was a bit too much vinegar tasting for us.

the best part about this is the fresh beans. the cocktail onions are to much, they over power the rest of the flavors.

Great side dish I love the crunchy bite, I did not use the onions. If I don't have fresh green beans on hand I use the frozen very fine string beans or the already snapped beans in the grocery store near the bag salads. Same effect

These were really good! I have never made fresh string beans before, but I will be making them a lot more often now. The only change I made was omitting the onions because I didn't have any on hand. Other than that, they were awesome!

Yum!  Following the results of other reviewers, I skipped the cocktail onions, and used jarred, minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Delicious dish!

Surely a hit! Just did one thing different, while cooking them added few drops of Tabasco sauce ... Came out nice and delicious and had this wonderful aroma to it. I guess a few drops of soy sauce can also be added the next time.

I made this for a party and had planned on taking some back home for dinner the next day. The pot was empty before any other dish. Even the people who did not like string beans loved this recipe.

These were wonderful!  I too skipped the marinated onions but they still came out great!  I also didn't snap all the beans due to time constraint but I couldn't tell the difference.

Not great. However I didn’t use onions, so maybe that’s what it’s missing. Recommend jazzing it up somehow.

love pan seared string beans!  Used the instructions and modified the amounts to what I was using. Didn't have onion juice so I added olive juice just a dash. Delicious!

Honestly they must have been good. I made them for a get to get her and by the time I went to eat they were all gone. First I added bacon. Fried all the bacon up and cooked the beans in the bacon grease. I used fresh minced garlic, dried onions and add they bacon after I crunched it into bits. Didn't used that onion juice. Seasoned to taste with salt and pepper only and cooked longer than the suggested ten minutes.

When I came across this I decided I would try it with the cocktail onions and liquid. I wouldn't say it beats my way lol, but it's definitely a delicious way to saute string beans. A suggestion I have for everyone, always use fresh to get the most from your dishes. Awesome job! Thanks for sharing.

I don't like green beans, but my family does. I made this for them tonight, and they LOVED it. I didn't use any onions, just the oil, beans, garlic salt & powder. They told me to definitely make it again.

Can't find marinated cocktail onions anywhere.  Some suggestions would be appreciated.  However, made these string beans with non-marinated cocktail onions, but cut the amount in half so the onion juice would not be over-whelming.  Delicious.
