I really enjoyed the flavors in this recipe. The Bison sure did surprise me as I was nervous about how it would taste. This was very good all the way down to the couscous! Now I was not able to get fresh scallops and that was NOT a great idea to use frozen!! Most of the scallops almost seemed like they was going to fall apart. (yes a few did) They just did not have the texture that fresh has. I would go as far as saying when I make this again cause I will YUMM! I am going to try frozen shrimp if I can not get my hands on fresh next time. This is my third time trying out couscous and this recipe I am finding it so flavorful. Although I did leave out the Feta since I did forget that at the store. I say even if you are skeptical like I was do give this a try I don't think you will be disappointed!

My family really enjoyed these! (Even my 15 month old!) The bison was for sure the star of the show! Everything grilled up quite nicely with the exception of the scallops. I decided to save a couple dollars and go frozen. This was a mistake! The texture was not great! I'll be buying fresh from now on. 
Otherwise, even the veggies were great! 
Use small, whole mushrooms too. They survive the grilling a lot better than cuts quarters/halves of larger ones. 
The couscous salad had amazing flavor and was wonderful as a left over the next day as well. I'll be making both again!
Thank you!
