I travel a lot and sometimes some of the best recipes I've come across here on AR have been when I'm heading out again and I do a simple ingredient search for recipes that are quick, easy and  to use up things I have in the fridge.  This was a BLT sandwich LUXE!  Over the top good, and quite pretty too.  I used homemade Italian bread and, I confess, considerably more of ALL the ingredients than the submitter directed for each sandwich - like probably double. If you aren't as lucky as I was to happen to have leftover guacamole laying around I'm sure that avocado slices would be great too, although the guacamole provides incredible flavor.  The bacon is a "gimme" in my book as I think no matter what you use it for it makes it taste better! Combine that bacon with good bread, the creaminess of the cream cheese, more creaminess and flavor from the guacamole, the crunchiness of the lettuce and the juiciness of a red-ripe tomato and you've got yourself one outstanding sandwich. I could easily see this as a wrap too, either using tortillas or simply large lettuce leaves.  So glad for the leftovers and search that led me to this recipe!

I cut the servings back to make just one sandwich. Because I did not have any actual cream cheese at the moment, I used Laughing Cow cheese in it's place. Because i'm eating low carb, I used one side of a Bagel Thin (sandwich slices). The ingredients for one sandwich fit really nicely on one slice of bagel--I was quite surprized. This was quite good. I'll make this again. Very filling.

This is one "Super" BLT! And to say that is really saying something because I've had a lot of them in my lifetime! Combining bacon, lettuce and tomato is just as classic a combination as peanut butter and jelly in my book. But, this combination of flavors and textures takes this classic to a whole new level! It's creamy and crunchy! I used thick cut smoked bacon, crisp iceburg lettuce, tomatoes seasoned with cracked black pepper, Philly whipped cream cheese, and "Guacamole" by Bob Cody from this site. I put it all on thick slices of toast. If you try this one, prepare your tastebuds for a treat. What a sandwich!

This was soooooo good!  I wasn't sure if I should do the cream cheese too, but it really added to it- I'm glad I did.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good. I toast those sandwich thins instead of bread, cook bacon in the oven for ease, and sometimes mix in garden/veggie cream cheese for more flavor.  Yum.

You can't taste the cream cheese and the guacamole is too overpowering. 
STICK TO: MAYO BACON LETTUCE TOMATO
on second thought how would sliced banana be on that too....?

I have been making this sandwich for a while now. Love it on pumpernickle or any good bread. I had been making a mixture of mayo and mustard (love mustard) but will now use the cream cheese (or laughing cow lite). It is the guacamole or fresh avacado that makes it.

I was pleasantly surprised on how great this was!  Although the cream cheese was a nice touch, the guacamole is what really set this off.  My kids devoured this and neither of them eat guacmole.  My husband, who is extra picky even enjoyed!  We have made this several times since as a quick meal.  Really enjoyed.

These were delicious and filling. Made one with veggie bacon and the rest with regular bacon and we all liked ours. Servved with coleslaw and sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo. Thanks!

I loved it.  I never would have thought to add cream cheese and guacamole to a BLT!  By the way, I haven't even tried it "real" yet.  I used imitation "veggie" bacon.  I'm sure it's even better with the real thing!

FANTASTIC! There is not one thing about this not to like. I used Panera's tomato basil bread that was thick sliced...YUM, YUM, YUM! Dare I say that this was BLT perfection?! A new favorite for me! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used Brownberry Health Nut whole grain bread to toast...delicious and healthy.  The sandwich didn't taste a lot different to me than any other BLT since I couldn't really taste the guacamole and I often put cream cheese on a sandwich so that was no different.  Next time I'll try more guac and see if that brings out the flavor.  It was quite delicious as is any BLT.

Favorite summer sandwich in this house.  The guacamole and cream cheese is a nice twist on the standard version of bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise.  I surely will be fixing this one again.  Thanks Lisabeth for sharing.

Great!   Even better by adding a couple slices of deli or leftover
smoked turkey, and using slices of avocado instead of the guacamole.

Made the Recipe for a picnic style event. Got so many compliments. As I didn't have much time to make the sandwiches on the day of the event, I baked the bacon the day before. I also made homemade guacamole the day before - laying a piece of plastic wrap directly on guacamole itself (to keep it from browning) before storing in the fridge.  Assembly the next day took only minutes.  Sandwiches traveled well. Definitely worth making again.  If you have the time, I definitely reccomend using homemade gaucamole.

This sandwich is so good! I used a simple homemade guacamole, thick sliced bacon, and whipped cream cheese. I cooked the bacon in a covered microwave bacon cooker making that part really easy. This may sound totally odd, but I ate it using Chef Johns Pumpkin Bread from Allrecipes. It was awesome. I do plan to make it again.

This has got to be my new favorite blt recipie.  You never would guess how well these flavors go togeather.  I made this with a fresh guac recipie and I think that also helped add to the amazing flavor.  Also I cut down the amount of bread to four slices.

It was pretty good- a nice change of pace from the regular BLT.

I did enjoy this, but I feel like there is a little part of me that just missed the "usual" mayo for the BLT.  I did really like the guacamole addition though!

Something simple = comfort food. The cream cheese is a welcomed change to mayo.

Although I am typically a BLT "purist", I will have to admit that this is a very nice twist to my all time favorite sandwich!  Home grown tomatoes are a must for a five star sandwich, though!  Thanks for sharing this tasty treat, Lisabeth!

This is a really good BLT sandwich, I toast my bread, and usually put slices of avocado on, but had never used cream cheese. thought it really added a nice touch.  It was good.

This was amazing. I used this on a wholemeal bagel, and used avocado spread instead of guacamole. Turned out amazing!! If your bread is chewy/thick, make sure the bacon is extra crisp so that it breaks off easily and doesn't make the sandwich difficult to bite off! (: Thanks for the recipe.

Yummmy!! I've never made BLT's(yes I know what they are) but thought I'd give this a try. It was so good. I made my guacamole the way I always do, just avocados and minced garlic. My family loved them and I will for sure make again.

Don't be shy on the toppings! Add lots of everything to balance with the thickness of the bread or, like I found out the hard way, you will mostly taste the bread.

Great sandwich. I used a hot guacamole and I also buttered the top of the bread and toasted it in the oven prior to preparing the sandwiches. Turned out excellent.

Never liked BLT's until I had this recipe. As a matter of fact, after I had surgery last month. The first thing I wanted when I woke up was this BLT. I sent my husband on a scavenger hunt to find everything needed cause I had to have it.
