Another great variation is to add a couple wedges of laughing cow garlic herb cheese instead of butter . it adds very little fat and calories . If you are on weight watchers as am I am it adds 2 + points per wedge

This is a great side dish. I'm on a low carb diet and this is a great replacement for potatoes. It would be good for anyone though. I even have it cold and it's still great.

My husband raved about this dish!  I only used 1 bag of frozen cauliflower, 3 Laughing Cow light garlic and herb wedges (instead of the butter), 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper, and then 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Easy and delicious.  Will become part of our regular rotation!

I made this with a fresh head of cauliflower.  After the water came to a boil, I threw in a few peeled whole cloves of garlic.  I drained the cauliflower in a colander and removed the garlic cloves and smashed in the pot and then returned the cauliflower to the pot.  I only used about 2-3 tbsps of butter and sprinkled some garlic powder - tasted just like garlic mashed potatoes!

Yum!  (I cheated and added a little mozzarella, but it would have been perfect even without it.)  Even my boys loved it.

I liked this and even my husband said he thought it was ok.  I used fresh cauliflower.  I also set a little of this aside and followed the advice of another reviewer and put some laughing cow cheese wedges in it.  I thought that was an even tastier variation!

A wonderful use of cauliflower, not necessarily one of my favorite veggies;  I used 1/2 head of fresh cabbage cut in floweretts, decreased the butter to 2 TBS of margarine/Benechol, limited the salt to a dash of kosher salt and added a smidge of plain, low fat yogurt.  These substitutions reduced the fat calories and the sodium count.  Hubby and I loved it.  A new BFF for us.

Wonderful alternative to mashed potatoes.  I used a big head of fresh cauliflower as opposed to the frozen packages.  I just boiled for 9 minutes and drained.  I let mine drain in the colander for about 6-7 minutes and didn't have any problems with watery vegetables.  After adding the butter, salt and pepper and garlic right in the pan, I used the immersion blender to blend the cauliflower.  It went really well 'San Francisco Pork Chops' and 'Chik-Fil-AÂ® Slaw' both AR recipes.

I just made this for Dinner tonite! My Husband, 16 yr old son & 13 yr old daughter loved it! Was begging for 2nds!!! I cooked the cauliflower in Homemade Chicken Stock and just mashed it by hand. After reading some reviews, I did drain the cooked Cauliflower onto some paper towels and smashed out as much of the stock water as possible before mashing it. It gave it the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Served it with some mushroom brown gravy made from Almond & Coconut flour. The kids had no idea that it was not potatoes until I asked them how it tasted from a scale of 1 - 10; 10 being the best.  They rated it an 8 & a 7 before I told them it wasn't Mashed Potatoes, lol.....African-Americans raised on old fashioned Country Cookin' from Scratch!

This is a great way to make cauliflower- which i ordinarily do not like, yummy- and it's a great low carb dish for my boyfriend :-)  But I prefer steaming the cauliflower- boiling leaches out a lot of the vitamins- and steaming makes it less watery.

I made this for the first time tonight. I found that the potato masher did not do the trick for me. It was too lumpy. So I put everything in the blender and pureed it. Next time I will let the cauliflower drain longer and see if it changes the consistency. My boyfriend thought it was mashed potatoes and was surprised it was cauliflower. :)

We liked this. I thought the garlic added a necessary dimension that kept it from being bland. I also threw in some leftover bacon at the last minute. Will definitely make this again.

I boiled a fresh head of cauliflower in water and chicken bouillon, drained the water, and used an immersible blender to mash it. Added garlic powder, a little cheddar cheese, and Spreadable Balance margarine substitute. It was delish! Hubbs raved, one kid didn't like and one kid ate all the leftovers in the pot. It was a bit on the watery side, but full of flavor.

Enjoyed this very much. Added a splash of 2% milk to the mixture, which made it a little more creamy and more like mashed potatoes. Very good and healthy!

This was a great start..... I used a half head of fresh cauliflower (there is only 2 of us), steamed it until very soft, then I drained it and saved the steaming water for something else another day.  Next I returned it to the same pan and mashed it with a potato masher.  Then I added 4 ounces of cream cheese and mashed it all together, no salt and no butter.  They were positively delicious!!                            I made this to go along with some organic skinless chicken breasts, that I stuffed with fresh spinach, feta cheese, sour cream and fresh garlic.  I also made twice baked yams with chopped pecans and honey.  This was a wonderful meal for us!!!

I make this dish all the time but I do it differently.  I use a fresh head of cauliflower and steam it until tender.  Instead of butter, I add a 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt and a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese.  I like some peoples idea of adding laughing cow herb cheese as well.  I always omit salt unless it absolutely has to be added.  The garlic adds a nice touch too.  I think frozen cauliflower would lose a lot of the nutrients so I always use fresh ingredients.

So easy and quick to make.  Best part - I fed 16 people at Christmas and everyone loved this !  Such good flavor.  Even relatives who don't usually like cauliflower loved it!  This will become a staple in my cooking routine!

Very easy and quick to make and so, so yummy! I tried steaming the cauliflower instead of boiling for the second try and that was fantastic too.  I am adding this to my regular veggie routine.

I loved how easy this was to make. It was a bit bland. I should have added the garlic. I added some laughing cow cheese to add more flavor as suggested by others.

I absolutely loved this.  The flavor is so much better than mashed potatoes and you can doctor them up to your liking.

I did like this even though I'm not a huge cauliflower fan! I will make it again.  As others suggested I added two wedges of laughing cow because I had them on hand.

Whole family loved it! - I used an extra bag of cauliflower (since there are more of us) and some garlic salt instead of regular salt and it was awesome!...It was a little time consuming only for the fact that I put mine through a food processor and I only have a small one, but totally worth it!

I make this a couple of times a month, however, I do it differently.   I drain the cauliflower in a colander, then use a potato masher to get out more water, still in the colander, then transfer the dryer cauliflower to the food processor.   I then add salt, 4 oz cream cheese & a handful of mozzarella.   I blend until it's creamy & smooth like mashed potatoes.   Maybe not the same recipe, but it's a delicious side dish.
PS.   I start w/ frozen cauliflower & I use 4 lbs of it at a time, so the 4 oz cream cheese & mozzarella isn't as fattening as it sounds.   We eat on it for several days.

Made this last night, followed recipe just like it said, I really like cauliflower but this was very bland. If I decide to try again will have to jazz it up like some of the reviews said with cheese or something! Not to pleased with results.

I used fresh cauliflower, and replaced the butter with a spoonful of cream cheese. Maybe I did not let it steam long enough, but I could not get it to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Overall though, I thought the end result was quite tasty. This coming from someone who really otherwise does not care for cauliflower.

Great way to prepare cauliflower!  I did substitute garlic salt for fresh garlic in the interest of time, but it was a bit salty.  Next time I will either omit the regular salt or go for the fresh garlic.  A real crowd pleaser with my family!

Use this instead of rice if you are on the Atkins diet/low carb. Works great. Taste great. I only gave it 4 stars because you really need to use fresh cauliflower to get the mash and taste just right.

I had Ruby Tuesdays's Mashed Cauliflower and LOVED it.  This recipe is the closest I've found here. 

I'm thinking that, if it was pureed, and some heavy cream and cornstarch added to the mix, it would be closer to the consistency of what I had in the restaurant.

The flavor was great. The only thing I changed was substituting garlic powder instead of minced garlic. It definitely can't substitute for mashed potatoes...maybe rice lol.

A great alternative to mashed potatoes. I followed some suggestions and added a little parmesean cheese to help thicken it. Next time I think I will blot it dry with a cloth or papertowel to help in removing excess moisture after boiling so it wont be so watery.

The most amazing thing of this recipe is that I served it to my teenage son who always refuses to eat vegetables and he ate it without even noticing it was a vegetable. He must have thought it was rice, the texture is so good and the flavor was really good.

I made exactly to the recipe and tasted it but didn't it.  I added a 1/4 cup of sour cream and a spice blend from a local shop which made it much better.  I will try again but only make a half recipe and try the suggestion of using laughing cow wedges.

With my version, I used fresh steamed cauliflower. I added no salt butter, minced garlic, be careful, it can be overwhelming, sour cream and a little milk in my food processor.  Pulsed a few seconds, then added chives.  Yummy!

Great side dish.  Served it with a pork roast, gravy, asparagus.  Worked well.  My guest thought it wsa mashed potatoes and we had a great laugh after his first bite.  After the initial shock as he was expecting good ole' mashed potatoes -- he admitted he liked it a lot and wanted the recipe and instructions.

I do not eat cauliflower - this I will do again and again.  Fed it to my 85 year old mother and she could not tell the difference from mashed potatoes.  It was not as thick as I normally eat my mashed potatoes, used fresh cauliflower and just realized not enough.

This was soooo good! I used fresh cauliflower. Steamed the cauliflower and after draining I used my magic bullet to mash before adding it back to the pot with yogurt, minced garlic, chives and salt and pepper to reheat.

I have been making this side dish for a while with a variation: I cook the cauliflower with a boullion cube added, salt to taste and minced garlic. Gives it great flavor. When done, drain and mash. I add a little greek yogurt, a pat of butter and a little grated parm cheese. Delish!

It may be a rookie mistake but I used real cauliflower because the frozen one was much more expensive. We also opted for the minced garlic. The consistency was way off and the garlic overpowered the side. It may be user error but we were not fans of this dish.
