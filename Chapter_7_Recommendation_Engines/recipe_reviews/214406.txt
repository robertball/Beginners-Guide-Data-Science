This used to be my favorite drink!  Haven't heard anyone mention a Salty Dog in over twenty years.  For a great tasting change, use ruby red grapefruit juice, not quite as tart and really refreshing!

Classic! I love vodka and I love grapfruit juice, but never had it in a salt-rimmed glass - I reserved that just for my margaritas.  This was great!

This is my drink of choice.  I love these you can also use gin instead of vodka, but vodka is better.
