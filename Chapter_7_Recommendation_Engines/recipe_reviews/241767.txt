The dressing is absolutely delicious!  Very light and fresh.  Salad is still great the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a really great way to use some kale we had on hand. Substituted Barley for the quinoa and cut back on the olive oil by about a third. Served it cold and the flavors all mixed really well.
