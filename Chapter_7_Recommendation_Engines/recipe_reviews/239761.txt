Delicious!  I used all butter, as I was not sure why it needed margarine.

It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. The cookie itself was very bland. The only real taste was the cherry.

I made these cookies with homemade apple pie filling and drizzled caramel on top. I used shortening instead of margarine.  I had to increase the time to 22 minutes, not sure why.  I made 25 cookies and they taste delicious.  Thank you for the pie idea. It was just what I needed to use up some filling.

These are pretty simple to make and delicious. My whole family enjoys them. I make the recipe exactly the way the recipe reads. The only thing I do differently is I add peach pie filling. Cherry is delicious too but I like peach better. I suppose you could add any pie filling. Next time I'm trying mixed berries.

The cookie is extremely bland. The cherry pie filling helped with taste on top but honestly its pretty bad.
