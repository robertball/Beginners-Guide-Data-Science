***I just realized that my recipe was changed.  If you can, use fresh finely chopped onions, not dried, and fresh minced garlic instead of or in addition to the garlic powder.  I also throw in some finely chopped green bell pepper sometimes.  Fresh is just always better to me.  And they left out the thyme.  Or maybe I forgot it.  Who knows?  About 1/2 teaspoon in the sauce while its simmering.  Yum.  ****Just a note, for those of you using the ready-bake noodles, it is NOT necessary and I really don't recommend it.  My recipe does not call for it if you look closely.  I use REGULAR lasagna noodles and make sure they are fully covered by a watery sauce cuz they will soak it right up.  Much better flavor than pre-cooking noodles separate in just plain water!!  And use lots of sauce!!  ****To give this a health boost, I throw kale and mushrooms in the food processor for a super fine chop and mix it in with the cooking beef and sausage.  My kid has no idea he's eating greens and anti-oxidant loaded mushrooms.

haven't used this recipe but I have been using dry noodles in my lasagna for years now. You don't need to buy the "new no cook noodles" the old ones work just fine.

Easy recipe for lasagna. Not only does it eliminate the boiling of the noodles, but you don't have to add egg and parm to the ricotta like most recipes call for. The only problem that we had was that the lasagna should have more ricotta cheese in it than the recipe calls for. Use at least 16oz or 24 oz. Other than that, it's a keeper

I doubled the sauce, used 1 1/2 cartons of ricotta chees and made it in a deep lasagna pan.  My husband thinks it's better than my grandmother's from scratch recipe.

I've never cooked my lasagna noodles, but I'd have to say this is one of the best lasagnas I've ever tasted.  My family loved it and it makes a ton.  We barely made a dent in it the first night, so I froze half and put the rest in the fridge for leftovers that week.  Excellent!

Had to cook this without the olives due to some picky eaters in the bunch I was feeding.  I think it is probably a TON better with them.  Used regular old lasagna noodles (without cooking them) and added a little extra water to make sure they cooked.  This turned out lovely - I will definitely make it again.  Plus  it seems like a great recipe for playing with - add spinach to the marinara sauce, using different meats and cheeses, adding onions, etc.

This was my first attempt at lasagna and I definitely will make it again!  The Italian sausage really gives it zing.  Also, it makes it less intimidating cooking the noodles right in the pan.

This lasagna was the best!  Easy to make and even better to eat.  The time I make it though I think I will add more sauce, to me it seemed to be kinda dry but the flavor was great!  Everyone loved it and it was better the next day!

I was surprised by the flavor of this dish. Very unique and spicey...in a good way. Husband hates lasagna, but loves this. Everyone had 2nds, no leftovers. Family rated the dish an 8 or 9 from 1-10. Great dish!!

This was really, really flavorful!  I made it exactly as written, with only a few modifications:  I reduced the pepper to only 1 tsp. and I prepared it in the morning and it sat in the fridge until it was ready to bake.  
One thing I read in other reviews was the problem with the ricotta cheese spreading.  I found something that was really helpful.  Just spread the ricotta onto the dry noodles, before you layer them.  It makes it very easy.  I used three noodles for each layer and came out using about 8 oz. of ricotta cheese, as called for.  
Also, I was a tad leery of the olives, because I'm not a big fan.  But they really weren't overpowering in this recipe and I didn't even notice them as I ate.  
I covered it for the first 45 minutes of baking, then I put the rest of the mozzarella on top and baked it uncovered, for another 15 minutes.  The pasta was perfectly tender and it was an excellent recipe.  This lasagna may become my 'go to'!  So delicious!

Instead of cooking the noodles or leaving them dry, soak them for 20 minutes in the hottest tap water you can get.  It's a nice way to use traditional noodles if you are not a fan of the no-boil.

This lasagna went over BIG time in my house!  I followed the recipe, making the following changes:  added 1/2 cup chopped onions to the browned meat, used 2 24 oz. jars marinara sauce (I used Bertolli Olive oil & garlic), plus, i used 2 lbs. FRESHLY GRATED mozzerella!  I really could taste a HUGE difference in the cheese!  I bought a big, 2 lb. block of mozzerella, put it through my Cuisinart, and grated it up.  I'm telling you, I think this made the biggest difference of all!  Try it! :D  Excellent Lasagna!!  My daughter hated lasagna - now she LOVES it! :D

Of course I can never follow the recipe the way that it's written as they are more used for guidance and ideas. My tweeks... Just after the meat starts turning brown... Season IT! Brown beef is plain and boring and should be soaking up all those flavors while it cooks. I also used more meat,  adding an extra 1/2lb of each as my hubby is a meat eater. 2nd- I did drain a little of the grease but left some in the pan and omitted the water. I added the black olives and then almost immediately added the jars of sauce (went w/1 jar Italian Sausage and the other Garlic Veg  for a nice flavor combo). I believe for a nice flavorable sauce you need to allow these ingredients to blend together and simmer for at least 1/2 hour which allows the sauce to combine with the meat and tenderize it (a must). Plus the longer the sauce simmers, you will notice it creating it's own moisture for the water you omitted. 
This was the first I had used dry noodles and I can say I will never go back to boiling them! What a waste of time and noodle breakage. This way worked perfectly with regular lasagna noodles. I used a 24oz of Ricotta as I was making a large dish and also added a mix of Italian Blends of chz in the layering.

Turned out DELISH!! Best I've ever made. It was nice and thick- not runny or goopy...which I give thanks to the the dry noodles.

Also note: Many other vegs would be great inthe dish: peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, zuchinni, etc.

It's a keeper! ;)

3 Stars... but worth much more.  This is the best base recipe for Lasagna that I've run across... ever. There are a few tweaks that need to be made to make it truely special though, and they aren't very hard...  Sauce: Take (2) 28oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and Basil, and puree them with (1) diced white onion, (1) diced red pepper, and (1) diced green pepper. Once this has been added together and blended to almost smooth - set aside.  Take one pound of ground Pork and one pound of ground Beef and brown them in a skillet. Once the meat is browned, throw a few cloves of fresh Garlic, minced, and the sauce , and let simmer for about an hour.   Use this sauce for the recipe as described above.

Use finely chopped onions instead of dried,    1/2 tsp. thyme in sauce,    not necessary to pre-boil noodles if you make sure they are completely covered with the watery sauce.

Served this for dinner last night and everyone RAVED about it. I used less pepper and real onions. Other than that, everything else was the same. I assembled it one night and cooked the next night for dinner guests. A keeper!

to those who thought this was too dry...
do what good italian restaurants do:  prepare as is, heat extra sauce on the side, serve the individual servings in a "pool" of sauce.  leftovers can easily be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil, and frozen for a quick heat and eat meal later on.

I made this for my boyfriend, who LOVED it. He's a bit of a picky eater, but he devoured this. When I told him I could freeze the leftovers, he refused, and wanted to eat it breakfast lunch and dinner til it was gone! I omitted the olives though. I had to cook mine for longer than the recommended time, and it took me quite a bit longer than 20 min to prep. But it's definitely worth it!

This was a great lasagna. I actually used ground italian turkey instead of sausage, and it was delicious (and healthier!). The only issue is that you definitely, definitely need way more ricotta cheese than noted. I used triple the amount. Otherwise, a good, easy lasagna.

If you opt to make this with no cook noodles, just know they do not freeze well, rather, they just turn to mush.  So, you must eat it up within a few days.  I made that mistake once, and it's too costly, and too time consuming to use those noodles and freeze them, then not be able to eat it.

Now a days you can purchase "No cook Lasagna Noodles" called" Oven ready" Noodles, they are the quickest way to make lasagna. The recipe doesn't say if the noodles are that kind or not, I can't see just putting regular uncooked noodles in it.

Excellent recipe although it did not call for tightly covering the pan. I did with foil and helped to keep it moist.

Good recipe. However, the spices were a bit too much. I'm not sure which I'd ease up on but there's definitely too much going on. I'll have to play with it some to make it perfect.

This is a great, simple recipe for lasagna.  The flavors are delicious and very straightforward.  I would recommend the following modifications: (1) increasing the amount of ricotta cheese (I used a 16 oz container); (2) chop one small onion and mix when you add the other herbs and use it instead of onion flakes; (3) use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder; and (4) I also chopped up a green bell pepper and tossed it in there.  I was able to put this recipe together in no time flat and it made enough food to feed a small army.  I had to freeze about half of it because it does make about ten servings.  But thanks - this is a keeper.

This was a great recipe! I did however, make some minor changes and preparation did take an hour..I am not sure how you could do this in 20 minutes. I did as others said and decreased the pepper to 1 tsp, added 1/2 cup of water to the sauce. Added a can of spinach as I wanted to get rid of it, and some fresh sliced mushrooms. Also put a little sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding it to the meat sauce. As I read it the meat sauce was supposed to go in the bottom. This didn't make sense to me. Would add a bit of salt next time, and use fresh onion. This time was in a bit of a rush. Baked covered in foil, then broiled the cheese a bit once it was done. The end result was perfectly cooked, well-formed and delicious. With caesar salad and garlic bread, it looked like it came from a restaurant!

Years ago someone told me not to cook the lasagna noodles, it wasn't necessary (she was a school cook and a really good one), and she was right.  In fact I usually make two and put one in the freezer for another time.  Works out great, and sure saves time.  I never put the black olives in mine but I think I'm going to try that, sounds great.

I made this for my first homemade lasagna and I actually received applause from my husband and 2 daughters LOL It was delicious!! We did use sage sausage though because our commissary didn't have Italian so we left the sage spice out.

This was incredible. I've made alot of lasagna in my day and this one was so unbelievably good. I used all sausage as I didn't have any ground beef. I also cut it in half because there was only three of us. It was fantastic all week and warmed up GREAT for lunches. The spiciness to the sausage was a GREAT change. Thank you thank you!!!

This is the BEST lasagna ever! my family tore it up! Yum Yum Yum! I left out the olives because 2 of my kids won't eat them. I also used fresh onion as the post had corrected. (but used 1/2 C) I put in 1/2 C extra water and 2-23 oz. Prego Marinara Sauce - because another post thought it was dry. One more change - being a Wisconsin girl, I love my cheese so I used 2-15 oz.Frigo whole milk Ricotta cheese - PERFECT! The best lasagna Ever! I fed 5 hungry people and have enough for another meal. I made Garlic Knots (off this site) to accompany the dish. Can't get any better than this! Thank You 4 your recipe!

Good basic recipe to follow.  4 stars due to not enough sauce.  I added more, about double.  I used my own home made sauce.  Used 1/2 meat suggested -doubled the ricotta cheese. No sage no olives.

loved it, with a few adds: changed the water to wine,Burgandy, the basil to 1 tbls.,added 1 tsp, of thyme, used a whole fresh onion, chopped, added 2-4 1/2 oz. cans sliced mushrooms, 16 oz ricotta cheese mixed with 1 cup parmesan cheese, 5 cups mozzarella, a chopped green pepper, and as I use a deep dish lazagna pan, I added 1/2 lb. meat, and 1 more jar marinara sauce. also, I grow my own herbs year round, so I used fresh. you can get by using a little less that way, and the taste...mmmmmmm

Awesome recipe. Best lasagna I've ever made. I added pepperoni to it. I also use more sauce than it calls for. Really great Italian taste. I keep the recipe handy just for the seasonings measurements for any Italian dish. Thanks!

Would make again in a heartbeat. So easy to throw together and i love that you don't have to cook the noodles. I know it seems scary but they really do cook in the lasagna itself. Makes you realize you could probably do that with any lasagna. The heat and moisture from the layers of sauce and meat soften the noodles and the time spent in the oven takes it the rest of the way. I think next time i'll leave out the sausage and sub with more ground beef. I felt the sausage flavor took over the others too much.

I have been looking for a "traditional" lasagna recipe for a while.  Simple is better!  A woman at my work makes it with this recipe and it is great!  However, I prefer more ricotta, so I doubled the ricotta.  Also, I was unable to spread it well, so I'm not sure how one can spread it with what the recipe calls for - I would suggest making very thin layers.  Also - because my layers were thicker - I used half of the lasagna noodles.  The original is definitely a keeper, but if you like the flavor of ricotta, then I say double it.  I would not alter this recipe, as it is very simple and traditional, which is what I prefer.  Adding too much "extras" is just another meal.  And I was nervous about the spicy sausage making it taste different than the traditional flavor, but it was actually quite perfect!  I've deleted all other lasagna recipes, as this is exactly what I was looking for.

We have had this several times.  I'm glad winter is coming so I can fire up the oven and make this again.  I read all the reviews including Sophie's update before I began.  So: use two larger jars of sauce; use fresh onion and garlic; add the thyme; a 16 oz. container of ricotta is just enough.  Buttering the dry noodles with the ricotta: genius. Didn't use the black olives because I didn't have any.   One thing I did differently was to cover the lasagna with foil (I think someone else suggested that) for 50 minutes, then put the reserved cheese on it and finished it in the oven for 10-15 minutes more without the foil.  Let me just say THANK YOU, SOPHIE!  This is the best lasagna recipe.  My son has always said Pasta House (St. Louis restaurant) lasagna is the best.  When he and his fiancee began moaning as they ate, I knew I had a winner.  They ask when I am going to fix this again.

I made this for my wife and niece today.  They both agree, my first try at this recipe was scrumptious and eager to have more. College student (niece) took some home for later. I did use fresh onion and garlic instead of dried flakes. I also used a bit too much marinara sauce, about 42 oz or so, will cut back next time to 30-36 oz. I feel like an Italian chef - pretty good for a Pa Dutchman.

This is the way I like to make my Lasagna. However, if I have the time, I make the sauce from scratch. I use, pork chops, steaks, sausage (Beef or Turkey). I usually do the sauce the day before the cooking. I never used the "No-Cook" noodles until my girlfriend told me about it. The first time it was a little dry, I had sauce on the side. However, from then on I I always made sure I put extra sauce in the lasagna so the noodles had more then enough to absorb. One other thing I do is to try and make sure all spices are fresh. Especially the garlic and onions.

The recipe doesn't say if it is necessary to buy the special "no cook" lasagne noodles or if this recipe is adapted to the regular noodles.  I don't want to risk wasting all these ingredients until I know for sure.  But it looks delicious and worth a try once the question is answered.

My family asked that I throw out all of my other lasagna recipes and to keep only this recipe!  Followed the recipe and added crushed red pepper and chopped italian parsley.  Delicious!

Turned out great when I made it!! Perfect consistency, and perfect amount of meat sauce, cheese, etc. However, I changed a couple things...  - I put in mushrooms instead of olives - I used half a chopped onion (fresh)  I like the changes I made, but after eating it, I'd recommend a couple more: - Add salt (not a lot, though) - Use spicy Italian sausage - Might add some pepper flakes  This is a very mild recipe when used with mild Italian sausage, so spice it up a bit!  Delicious!

Just like my Italian Mama makes! Great recipe, very authentic, and the addition of black olives is a wonderful thing! My family ate it up like crazy and leftovers were even better. Served it with homemade garlic bread and a salad. A sure winner!

I followed this recipe. Even when I was skeptical about the 2 teaspoons of black pepper. I did do one thing different - I soaked the noodles in hot water for 5 minutes because I could tell there was just not enough moisture to soften the noodles. This is a meaty not cheesy dish. It is dryer than we like & spicy due to the pepper I suspect. For us this is not our type of lasagna. We choose this to make together for our Sunday night "event" meal. There are just the two of us and we had hoped to have tons of leftovers for the week which we do but the sad thing is neither of us really want to eat what is "left over". I can't say this is a bad lasagna but like I said we like dripping cheesy lasagna and this is a dry meaty dish. It is what it is but it isn't what we wanted it to be. For us this a 2 star dish but we will give it 3 due to the chance that we missed a step or didn't do something correctly. It did take a whole hour covered to soften the noodles so we could cut them. When we cut into the dish it was "picture perfect" and stood up like you see in the pictures but the flavors were meat and black pepper predominantly. Maybe our San Francisco Bay Area North Beach Italian taste buds got in the way. Maybe this is Italian from a different part of Italy and that's what made it so not our type of dish. If you like a dry non-cheesy dish this is it. Not bad like I said just not what we were looking for. We like more tomato and cheese and less meat and black pepper.

Awesome lasagna!  I made it today and shared with my neighbors.  Everyone LOVED it!  I omitted the olives, used fresh herbs from my garden and 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a small chopped onion which I added to the meat.  I used two 24 oz jars of sauce and rinsed the jars with about 1 cup of water.  I also used a 20 oz container of part skim ricotta and would probably use a bit more next time.  My pan was a bit larger that 9x13.  I used 3 noodles across, leaving a gap in between, then one across the bottom and had 3 layers of noodles.  I baked for about 1 hr 20 min, covered with foil.  We weren't ready to eat, so I turned off the oven and left it in for about another hour.  The lasagna was a perfect consistency and had great flavor.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was the best lasagna we have ever had.We add just a little change,we add a small diced onion,3 tablespoons of diced green pepper,no minced garlic just added 1 more teaspoon of it. We do not care for ricotta cheese so we used 12oz. of cottage cheese,used a 2.25oz. can of diced black olives.Also used a 45oz jar of sauce and it was soooooooooo good.PS you have to try the french bread recipe on here mmmmmmmm!!

Lasagne was awesome.  I added an extra 12-14 oz spaghetti sauce and about 1/4 c. water to make the sauce go farther. It would have been too dry w/o it.  I used the recipe amount for ricotta since there was so much mozz. cheese.  I wouldn't add more ricotta (as some reviews suggest)unless I was cutting down on the other cheese or it would've been too cheesy for my taste. Overall, I thought it was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

This was unbelievable! I had to make some adjustments to make due with ingredients on hand, so I used 1 lb of ground lamb instead of sausage (it gave it a wonderful savory flavor), and I also blended mild cheddar and fresh parmesean into the mozz to make it go farther. For the spices I just used a package of Italian dressing mix.  We put the noodles in dry, as instructed, and we topped it with some diced pepperoni(under the final cheese layer). Had to let it bake for an extra 15 minutes, and add some extra sauce on top, but it was soooo good. My husband declared it the best he's ever had!

Very Good!  I had to omit some items and substitute others that I did not have.  I used only a pound of ground beef, omitted the italian sausage and instead of ricotta cheese I used cottage cheese.  Instead of marinara I used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I also used an 8x8 baking dish since my recipe was scaled back.  This came out really good and my son, who is picky, liked this as well.  The only negative was that the noodles, which I did not cook before hand, were chewier than I would have liked.  Next time I may either boil them for half the time or just cook the lasagna longer than the suggested time.

Very good recipe.  As with all lasagna recipes that use the ready to bake noodles, I find it a little dry.  Adding additional sauce or even water would probably solve that easily.

Soooo good!  Read through all the comments and made the following changes: added a 3rd 14 oz bottle of spaghetti sauce (Paul Newman's Marinara), skipped the black olives, 1 tbsp basil, 1/4 fresh onion instead of flakes, & soaked noodles in hot water for 20 minutes before using them. My husband doesn't like ricotta so substituted Ree Drummond's recipe - beat 2 eggs, mix with 1 lb container of cottage cheese, 1/2 c Parmesan, and 2 tbsp of parsley flakes.  Oops, just saw there was supposed to be salt in there, too, but we didn't miss it.  Thanks, Kris!

Delicious. Just the right blend of spices. I used 2 jars traditional pasta sauce (I usually make my own but thought I'd try it this way) and mild Italian sausage. It came out amazingly. My family and I ate half for dinner last night and I stored the other half in the freezer to have for dinner another time to serve on a busy school night.

The sauce has a really good flavor, but I suggest cooking your lasagna noodles before you put it all together. I will do that next time. But all in all, it was very good. I also added chopped bell pepper.

This was easy to make and very, very good!  I  bought an expensive Marinara sauce but will try it with one of the standard ones next time.  I forgot all the warnings about too much pepper and it was way too spicy.  Next time I will make sure to remember to cut the pepper in half. Looks beautiful, cuts easily (and stays in shape), and tastes delicious.

Tried dry noodles for the first time.  The taste was good but overall the dish was too dry.  Also, 8 ounces of ricotta is not enough, I used 16 oz and probably could have used more.   Next time I'm adding a 1/2 cup of water to the sauce as well as adding another 14 oz of marinara.   Overall, a good result for my first "dry" lasagna.

My second attempt at lasanga...used the green peppers and onions...delicious.  First attempt from recipe I had to cook the noodles this is so much easier and comes out great.  For whatever reason I had to use double the ricotta cheese...hard for me to spread...just incase any other beginners are attmepting.  Aslo two and a half regular size jars but my skillet wasn't big enough so becarful if you are using 28 ounces...

This was okay, not great. It is the first time I have used dry noodles and they cooked right though.

Made this last night with Jimmbo's garlic knots, and it was such a great meal!  Loved the addition of the olives.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Sophie.

I have never said this about any dish and didn't think it was possible, but the spices in this dish are overpowering.  I don't mean spicy (we like spicy); I mean too many spices.  It tasted like we were eating an herb garden with a lot of black pepper.  And the noodles were a bit chewy, although my husband thought they were ok.  This just didn't work for us.

Before I made this recipe I have only had lasagna from Italian restaurants. I got to say this rivals the best ones I have tasted. Next time I make it I will try some of the suggestions on the reviews. My whole family loved it thanks.

Just made this today for dinner: simple and delicious. I browned the meat in 1cup of water to get some of the juices out for the lasagna, chopped ~2cups of onions and ~2cups of bell peppers and add it to the meat.

Extremely tasty but the pasta could have been softer so next time I will be doubling the sauce.  Can't fault the flavour though - and the olives were a nice touch!

This was so easy and yummy. I omitted the olives and used fresh onions and garlic and it turned out wonderful. Instead of jarred sauce I used 2 28oz cans of crushed tomatos with 2 cups of water and it turned out delicious. The uncooked noodles soaked up all the sauce and the lasagne turned out firm and cheesy. Delicious!

This is fool proof and totally rocks!  I agree with double or tripple the Ricotta. I deep dished it and the family went nuts! I used regular spag sauce and added a tablespon of brown suger to cut the black pepper.

Good recipe, but next time I plan on changing a few of the quantities. More ricotta next time, definitely. I bought a 15 oz container, and it still didn't cover it. I would also use more sauce... maybe another jar full, maybe two. The amount I had didn't quite cover the top layer. Taste was great though! Mmmm...

Following another review I used more ricotta and less meat, and it came out well. The flavor was good. My only problem was that I ran out of sauce...I must have used too much on the first layers. Instructions on how much to use for each layer would be helpful for us newbies.

I agree with doubling the sauce and adding more ricotta, as well as baking in a deep dish.  I did not, and ended up with crisp noodles on top because there was not enough sauce to cover.  I was too generous with the first layer of sauce (used only enough to cover the bottom) and not generous enough with the first layer of noodles (so I had lots of leftovers!).  This was my first time making lasagna, and now I know to use more than 3 noodles per layer!  This is definitely a meat-lover's meal so I won't be making it too often, but it is very tasty.

I suggest you give this a try! My daughter made this for our Christmas eve family dinner and it was a BIG hit, even with the pickiest eater! I can see where individual tastes might adjust the meat quantity or type of sausage but this appealed to everybody and now replaces the 4-hr prep lasagna of old, and the fact that you use regular lasagna noodles without precooking makes this a total winner of 5 stars with us. I also appreciated the review suggestion of using spinach in the marinara sauce.

Super easy recipe, and it came out great. I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, and used regular pasta sauce instead of marinara. I ended up needing extra sauce because I wanted to make sure the noodles were covered enough to cook through. I will definitely be making this again.

Would be a great Lasagna but mine came out way to salty. It was my first time to use the no cook noodles, could that have been the problem? I think I will try it with regular noodles next time.

I really liked this recipe.  It did get dark on top after the appropriate cooking time.  I might try a lower temperature to help prevent it getting too dark on top, and still get it baked all the way through.  The sauce was great in this recipe and the ricotta cheese is a requirement with me.  So yummy!

Been using this amazing recipe since 2010. Love it and came back in November 2016 to look at reviews for new ideas. Im surprised to find (relatively) few ratings for this terrific recipe. It's worth a try and I suspect if you do, it'll wow you. The combination of simplicity and flavor, without any major quality shortcuts, makes it my personal pick as 'AR's Greatest Lasagna' (winks, nods to this site's famous lasagna recipe, which is also amazing but much more ingredient and time intensive, without too much better results). The basic switch in this recipe is using prepared marinara sauce instead of a 'from scratch' sauce. I'm not big into substituting processed ingredients for scratch ingredients, but this one where I happily do so. First of all there are some pretty good jarred marinara sauces out there. And if you insist on scratch sauce, you could make your own favorite marina recipe and use 28 oz of it here, saving the rest for another use. I have no suggestions, other than reading Sophie's excellent follow-up post regarding details of her original recipe that were changed by the editors. I also look forward to trying her 'extra veggies' tip!!!

I only used 1 lb. gr. beef and did not use sausage.  i cooked ch. onion and some ch. garlic w/the gr. beef.   Used a 48 oz. bottle of spaghetti sauce and a 24 oz. ricotta cheese.  I left out olives.  Because of time constraints I cooked the lasagna one night and reheated it and served it the next night.  The 2nd night when I reheated it I topped it with an additional 16 oz. spaghetti sauce and the reserved 1 C. of mozzarella cheese.  The noddles were cooked just fine and it was nice and firm but not runny.  I added 1 egg and some grated parmesan cheese to ricotta.  I spread the ricotta mixture like frosting on each lasagna noodle before layering them in the pan.

This recipe was great!  I loved that it calls for Italian sausage.  My son says that's what puts it well above "regular" lasagne.  I did use a turkey Italian sausage to make it slightly healthier.  Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

I think I finally found a Lasagna recipe I can love! I made only minor changes to the recipe using  ground Oregano and ground Sage instead of the dried version as called for and reducing the amount to about half.  As I had some grated parmesan cheese on hand I sprinkled a bit of it along with the mozzarella on one of the layers as well as on the top.  Instead of 2-16 ounce jars of spaghetti sauce I used 2-23 ounce jars of spaghetti sauce as I like plenty of sauce.  I did not adjust the seasonings and it was still delicious. Will definitely make again!

This will now be my "go to" lasagna. I have never used dry noodles before and they came out perfectly. And I "buttered" the noodles with the ricotta as suggested. Also followed other suggestions of adding/using mushrooms, fresh chopped onion, two 24 oz Bertolli Olive and Garlic sauce, 16 oz ricotta, parmesan. Covered with foil for 50 min, added more cheese, cooked additional 10 min.

I had a recipe on the old site I loved.  This is very close .  I add more Ricotta about twice as much 8oz doesn't go very far if you are trying to spread I on.  And I add more sauce probably an additional 12 oz so it doesn't get dried out.  I don't cook my noodles first.   I put them in uncooked and it works great!

Good base recipe!    Save money and calories by omitting the sausage and using something like Prego Spicy Sausage or Italian Sausage & Garlic Sauce.   For best results, individually season the meat, the sauce and the cheese mixtures with fresh herbs or appropriate seasonings before combining the layers.  If you like it saucy, make extra sauce and serve on the side.  And it's true, it's even better the second day so this makes a great dinner party dish to make ahead and serve with any of these things:  caprese, caesar, Italian salad, pesto or bruschetta on small toast crackers, steamed broccoli, garlic or cheese bread, tiramisu, or a bottle of Rosa Regale and favorite chocolate dessert....

Me and all my friends loved it . i didn't put sage or basil in it. I used one jar of marinara and a jar of garlic basil spaghetti sauce also i added two cans of diced tomatoes, cottage cheese instead of ricotta and fresh mozzarella. I looked forever to find a recipe and this is the most helpful. Thanks

Per the author's added comments, I used fresh onion and garlic, and I added dried thyme. I omitted the olives because I don't like them in general. To make it healthier, I substituted ground turkey for the beef. Lastly, because my husband doesn't like ricotta cheese, I substituted it with drained cottage cheese. It was delicious, even the leftovers still tasted amazing!

No changes, maybe more mozz cheese, VERY GOOD. Oh wait, i added a small can of tomato sauce once i added the marinara sauce. Didn't change the flavor just added some "sauciness" to the marinara meat.

This was really good and as the name suggests- simple! I would make this again when I don't have as much time (or energy) but wanna make lasagna. Only thing I would change is the amount of sage- TOO much! I would use 1/3 of the suggested amount. (Unless you absolute love sage.) I made this with the garlic & herb pull apart bread from this site and it was a perfect match.

The flavor in this was delicious and my kids loved it.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I thought it needed more sauce.  I didn't have enough meat/sauce combo for 3 layers so the top layer of noodles didn't get fully covered.  I had to add water to keep them from being crunchy.  I would add another jar of marinara sauce the next time I make this.

Excellent basic recipe.  I made it according to the recipe the first time and THEN tweaked it.  The 5 stars are for the recipe "as written".  I agree that more ricotta is needed so that was what I added the second time I made this.  The third and fourth times I added a little more black olive; they come canned so remember that they'll add a bit more moisture to your lasagna - definitely don't need to pre-cook the lasagna noodles or use those awful no-boil things.  We prefer using mild sausage and my additional tweak is therefore using about 1-1/2 lbs. of mild Italian bulk sausage and about 1/2 pound 80/20 ground beef.  I've also added fennel seeds --  about 1/2 teaspoon -- to the cooking meat mixture which seems to help balance the acidity of the marinara sauce.  

Again, the 5 stars are for the reecipe as written.  The tweaking I did is to give people some other ideas of what to do.  Don't be afraid to experiment a little bit to make the recipe your own.  Fantastic recipe, Sophie!!  Thanks so much.

We replaced ground meat with ground turkey, left out the olives, and added a six Italian cheese blend to brown on top. It was quite good. I cooked my noodles until pliable, but not al dente. I just can't make myself put them in the dish completely uncooked. I also mix the ricotta with the meat mixture to take away one layering step.

This takes a while to cook but sooooooooooo worth it! Delicious!!!!!!!!! Everyone at my party loved it! I wouldn't change a thing. But one suggestion is to simmer the sauce for at least four hours just cuz it seemed to taste even better when I let all the good flavor simmer and blend together longer. Love this recipe!

The Lasagna was very good and easy to make.  But when I went shopping for the dinner I made a mistake of interrupting pasta sauce for tomato sauce.  To save your money on fixing the mistake. You want to buy Spaghetti Sauce.

I made this a long time ago and saved the recipe....going to do it again....maybe the reason everybody adds more sauce is because the recipe says two 14 ounce jars marinara---is that a typo?  Couldn't even find that size at store.......Most standard jars are 24 oz.

The recipe didn't say to cover the lasagne with foil, and my noodles were done in the center but hard around the edges. The sauce was pretty tasty, though.

Wonderful recipe!  I love the touch of black olives.
For noodles, I prefer fresh pasta...lasagna sheets (as opposed to noodles) are terrific and add a great texture to the dish.  I will even add a couple of extra sheets with just a dab of sauce to stick them together.

This was an amazing lasagne.  I didn't put in olives but did put in mushrooms.  Thanks!  My husband loved it and asked if I could make it every week!

I have been making my lasagna with dry noodles for years.  Just use extra sauce.  Not being Italian , it is nice to have a authentic list of ingredients.  I always use a home made sauce, not jared.   Now if I can get an authentic recipe forf the sauce....  I am the Polish cook, trying to cook italian

Very tasty recipe, but needs salt.  Also I didn't have enough meat sauce for a 9x13 pan.  Will double the amount recommended next time!  Overall great taste!

This is a fabulous, easy lasagna.  Tastes very traditional and comforting, not overly cheesy and fluffy.  MmmMMMm my favorite recipe I've found so far.   I used ground turkey usually.

Wonderful easy recipe, used real green onions, sauce made in my hometown, a little more of both cheeses. My husband loved the olives will add more next time. Made the night before, turned out great! Will definitely make again.

This was delicious and fast.  I made two and froze one for later.  I also used a spicy Portuguese sausage called chorizo as well as Italian sausage and it gave it all a great flavor.

Fabulous lasagna.  Took a little longer to prepare than my own recipe...but wow was it worth it. I doubled the recipe to make two separate casseroles...one with olives and one without. Big hit both ways.  Thanks Sophie

Very good! The only change I made was to use AR's Best Marinara Sauce Yet in place of the jarred sauce called for. I also added a little bit of shredded Italian cheese blend to the mozzarella layers. Thank you!

This was the absolute best lasagna that I have ever tried!  The recipe was easy to put together, espically since there is no need to boil the noodles.  My husband, children, and parents gobbled it up and cleaned the remaining sauce up with their garlice bread.  The leftovers are almost better than the first day.  Next time I think I will try to put this together the night before.  Awsome!

This was amazing! I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone really enjoyed it. I used sweet Italian sausage and the flavor was great. I make lasagna for Christmas dinner every year and this will be the recipe I use from now on! Great job kiddo.

I remember when my mother used to spend all day making homemade lasagne. Well, don't tell Mom, but this may be just as good in a fraction of the time. Lol. I omitted the olives and added sauteed onion and green pepper. I made this a day in advance as I think lasagne is way better rhe second day.

Full of flavor. Everyone loved it. I used 2 cans of marinara.
