This recipe rocks. Tips for those who're having a hard time finding green tea powder: you can find those teabag versions easily at your local market, cut and empty those into a blender, and voila you got yourself green tea powder.

I made this for a party for the first time yesterday and it was a hit. I didn't have green tea powder so I took the advice of another user and bought Stash Green Chai tea bags, opened each bag, poured the loose tea into a coffee grinder and ground to a fine powder.

The results were wonderful and everyone at the party commented on how great the taste was...green tea with a hint of spice and not too sweet. I had to double the frosting, however. I made these into cupcakes so I reduced the baking time to 15 minutes and they came out perfect. I will definitely make these again!

I used this as a cupcake recipe (due to the lack of cake pans) and it turned out very well. The cakes were moist and the icing complimented them nicely. 

Things to watch out for: It is recommended to use matcha/green tea powder and NOT the milk tea because the color and the flavour will not be as distinct.  Also be careful as to the amount of powder you add to the icing. I judged it by eye to keep it a light (minty) green colour because if you add to much it'll end up looking like a Ninja Turtle . . .

Oh, how I LOVE this cake!!!
It's taken me a few months to make this -- I FINALLY decided to splurge & buy the matcha (which, by the way, if you are not near a store that sells matcha, you can go to www.teavana.com). The green color looked great. The frosting is marvelous. I thought the amount of sweetness was just right. I added a little extra matcha & vanilla--very slight amount & the only other change I made was to use all regular flour (that's what I had on hand). The cake is moist & wonderful. I kept it refrigerated in a sealed container. I happen to love green tea...not everyone does. Next time I may increase the frosting ingredients by 1/4. Yummy!! Thanks Suki!

I just want to warn people not to do as I did, and for lack of green powder, use the tea from green tea bags.  It doesn't taste like anything.  I'm still giving it five stars because the cake's texture was delicious and makes a great plain cake even without the green tea.

This cake is SO GOOD!!!  It's moist and not overly sweet, and the frosting is delicious. I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for half of the oil, and added an extra tsp. of matcha (so 5 tsp. total). Also, I used 2 tsp. of vanilla and soy milk instead of regular. I didn't have matcha on hand, so I used exactly 10  teabags of green tea and grounded it in a blender. That was enough powder for the entire cake, including the frosting. I did have to double the amount of frosting to cover both layers, and I also reduced the powdered sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/4. Definitely add a few drops of green food coloring; it looks much more appetizing! Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!!! I love green tea anything so when I saw this I tried it the very next day; I didn't have any cake pans, so I made 2 batches of 12 cupcakes with the batter. The cake came out a beautiful green/brown color, it was wonderful itself. The frosting was also really great, but next time I'll probably increase it by 1/4 so I don't have to scrap the bowl for the last cupcake. The only other change that I made was to use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour. For the cupcakes I used the reccommended temperature and baked the cupcakes for 15 mins.

Very nice cake! I baked it in a Bundt pan and sprinkled in some sesame seeds before pouring in the batter; this made an attractive "crust" on the cake. Also, I skipped the frosting and just served it with a simple dollop of whipped cream. If you want your whole meal to have an Asian theme, this is a perfect, light finish to a dinner rich in flavors of soy, garlic and ginger.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes instead of one cake.

Next time I make it I will use a lot less oil and less sugar (I thought it was a little too sweet).
I doubled the maccha in the icing and cake, and will do that next time too.

I might try a different icing next time, this one was a little too runny and apparently I'm not a good fan of cream cheese frosting (this was first time I tried it).

Other than that I liked it, loved the green tea flavor!

Thank you!

This is a very tasty cake! The green color showed up beautifully. the green tea flavor is light, so maybe you can add more depending on taste. It is very spongy & moist. I would definitely make this again!

Delicious! I will definitely make this again. I used two cups of all-purpose flour as I didn't have any cake flour on hand. I made more frosting than was called for; I used about 8 oz cream cheese instead of 3 oz, and I used a bit more of the other ingredients to balance it. However, I did not put any butter in the frosting. It came out great without the butter. For the cake, I used about 1/3 cup olive oil and 2/3 cup apple sauce. I used pure matcha powder that I had ordered from MySpice Sage. If you like green tea desserts, it's worth buying some matcha powder. It will last a long time because a little goes a long way. Green tea from teabags does NOT taste the same. It came out nice and light and the frosting is delicious. Next time, I might add raisins or nuts.

I've made this twice now, once as a single layer cake (I only had 1 cake pan and limited time) and once as cupcakes. I actually think that I prefer this as a cupcakes (as someone else mentioned they only take about 15 minutes in the oven). The cupcakes bake up to be rather light and moist, but the cake turned out very tasty as well. I love the flavor of green tea and wanted it to be a bit stronger so I actually added about another teaspoon and a half of the green tea powder to both the cake and the frosting. If you are looking to really get the taste of the green tea, I would definitely recommend adding more than the recipe suggests.

This cake turned out very nicely. I used 2 cups of all-purpose flour because I didn't have any cake flour on hand, and I doubled the ingredients for the frosting. The cake came out incredibly moist, with a light flavor. I was happy that the green tea taste was subtle--almost like a zucchini bread taste. The frosting was good, too, though a bit more sugary then I prefer my cream cheese frosting. I made this cake for a co-worker who requested a "something with green tea," so I'm hoping it will live up to her expectations! Overall, though, this is a nice cake to serve to someone.

I actually just tried this recipe yesterday.  It is a great recipe and the cake is moist, sweet but not too sweet.  However, this cake tasted like a regular cake with minimal green tea flavor.  If you are a fan of green tea and looking for an authenic green tea cake like that found at a japanese bakery this is NOT the one.

This cake is tasty. The only thing is that it doesn't taste like green tea-- and I doubled the amount of matcha! Kind of disappointing.  I made the frosting too, and had the same problem. I found it helped to sift some raw matcha over the cupcakes to give them a green tea taste.

I've made this twice: once in a 9X13 pan and once in two 9 inch rounds. The first time I pretty much followed the original recipe and it came out light and moist, but  I felt the green tea flavor was a bit subdued. So, for my second time around, I upped the green tea powder in the batter to about 5.5 tsp. I also used blackberry yogurt in place of the plain yogurt to give the cake a light fruity taste. I added about 8 drops of green food coloring to the batter and the cake came out a really pretty light green color. For the frosting, I also upped the green tea powder to 4 tsp and used about 4 oz. of cream cheese. It was a little grainy, but the green tea taste was much stronger, which was what I was going for.  I bought the green tea powder at a Japanese grocery market for $5.99; it was not the Maccha brand as that was was almost $10! I personally think it tastes great despite using the cheaper brand and I doubt anyone will notice the difference. Great recipe, thanks!!

I halved the recipe because I don't have much use for a two-layer cake, so I baked one 8" round layer in my unreliable oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I didn't have matcha, so instead I ground up the contents of two teabags. Probably not the best method, and I imagine it would taste better with higher-quality, better-ground powder, but it does taste pretty good! Nice and subtle, and the texture of this cake is amazing, even with applesauce in place of half the oil. I used some leftover cream cheese icing out of my freezer rather than making green tea icing, and I have to say, I think the flavor would be too overpowering for me with tea-flavored icing too, so regular cream cheese icing (I like mine not very sweet) has a great contrast. I like the subtlety. Waiting to see what my green tea loving friends think of the cake, but thus far I think this cake easily deserves 4-5 stars if you like green tea flavored desserts!

I bought matcha when I was in Japan and decided to try out this recipe.  I ended up making 15 large cupcakes from this recipe.  I didn't have cake flour, so a known substitute for 1 c cake flour is 1 cup all-purpose flour minus 2 tablespoons, PLUS 2 tablespoons of corn starch.  I used 1/2 c applesauce and decreased the oil to 1/2 c.  I don't like things being too sweet so I decreased the sugar to 1 c.  If the cupcakes were eaten alone, they would have needed the full amount of sugar, but with the icing, it was just perfect.  I used 4 oz cream cheese in the icing and I had a lot of icing for the 15 cupcakes.  While this made a nice and moist cake overall, there still wasn't enough green tea taste and I would add more matcha in the future.

Very moist but too sweet and not enough green tea powder. I cut the sugar in 1/2 for the batter and used 8oz cream cheese to make the topping thicker. Also doubled the green tea powder for the frosting and came out wonderfully! Sprinkle some over the finished product, looks and tastes great!

I really like how this cake turned out!  Very tasty, not too sweet.  Easy to make, too.   I baked it for my birthday/christmas dinner.  I only used all-purpose flour, and regular sugar for the icing, but it didn't seem to have negative effects on the finished product.  Also, instead of pure matcha I got by accident a mixture of matcha and green tea leaves - not having a grinder or blender, I just put the leaves in as is.  It still tasted great, and the cake had sort of a speckled look - kind of like a green lemon poppyseed cake.  Pretty!

I'm only giving three stars b/c I have not tried this yet. By the looks of it, some people recommend grinding up the green tea leaves that come in a brewing sack. I recommend you don't. It is not the same thing as match a powder. Not at all. If you've never had matcha or match a flavored things, understandable why you'd think 'making your own' is sufficient. Go and buy the real thing! The Green tea leaves used in making matcha are harvested at a different stage of maturity, resulting in a distinctly different flavor. Real matcha will not only provide a more prominent flavor, but give your cake&frosting a more delightful colour.

Green Tea Layer Cake Haiku: "Made this as cupcakes. Light whisper of green tea taste. Had to change some things." I couldn't find green tea powder, so I followed some reviewers' suggestions of emptying tea bags in my coffee bean grinder, which I assume is why both my cupcakes and frosting came out a more murky shade than some of the more lovely submitted photos. (Btw, I think it ended up requiring 9 teabags.) I tinted my frosting w/ green food coloring to counter the not-so-attractive hue that using teabags over powder produced. I ended up with 15 cupcakes, all frosted fairly well, but I think one would need to double the frosting in order to cover a layer cake. The end result was a delicate flavor, not too pronounced, but dainty and light. What's not light; however, is the ample addition of veg. oil, so if I make this again, I will hunt down green tea powder, as well as decrease the oil and maybe sub some applesauce.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I thought the cake was very dry and the frosting tasted too much like cream cheese.  I don't have any suggestions as to how to fix it.  I don't think I would ever make it again.

Wow! I made this for my birthday party and I just love it! Not too sweet, I'm not much of a fan of traditional birthday cakes. The frosting was amazing, I'm glad I doubled the recipe because then I got to lick extra off the bowl. I did add a couple drops of green food coloring. I found that a bag of green tea is a teaspoon, I just put it in the food processor and whirled the heck out of it. Still left lil green chunks in my frosting but I love it :) Thanks for an interesting recipe.

i bake it in a 9x13inch pan and it takes 30mins. however the problem is the green tea is not in powder form. i follow the other viewers advices and blend it in a blender. but it didnt work at all. and when i mixed it with the batter, my family thought i was making poppy seed cake! anyway, the cake came out really nice and moist, the mistake didnt affect it too much except the cake didnt have any green tea flavor.

I just made this cake with a high hope...however, the cake didn't turn out that great. It's very moist but there is hardly any green tea taste to it. I in fact used 5 tspn but still can't taste any green tea. It could be that I used brown sugar which may have overpower the taste of green tea. Won't make this one again.

I made this for a girl scout event, the girls came back for seconds. Next time I will try and find powdered green tea and see if there is any difference. Over all a good cake that is not to sweet.

This cake was delicious. I highly recommend previous notes on buying Green Chai Tea in bags and powdering it yourself. the Chai adds spices that dance on your tongue! the cream cheese icing is very strong, i would want to try it with a lighter fluffier cream cheese icing next time. 

This is definitely a keeper.

This cake was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out moist and fluffy.  I did have to double the frosting though.  I had my friends and family try it and they loved it.  Everyone kept on coming over until the cake was gone. Thanks for the recipe!! Try to find the powder green tea though otherwise you won't get the same result.

Great recipe.  Thanks Suki!  I added a smidge of green food coloring to further the 'green' tea theme and it turned out beautifully.  The taste is subtle but refreshingly different.  My guests all loved it.  Thank you.

Delicious!  Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil plus 1 cup of sweetened applesauce.  Instead of 1 1/4 cups of white sugar, I used 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I agree that the frosting isn't enough to cover all the cake if you make cupcakes, but I didn't mind having some cupcakes left unfrosted (the cake tastes great by iteself).

This cake was pretty good, but it was pretty oily - I will probably make it again, but cut the oil down by at least 1/4 cup, or maybe use a lighter oil like grapeseed.

I like that this is so moist.  It's not spongy, but it is moist.  I filled this with plain cream since I didn't want anything to compete with the green tea.  The matcha flavor is not overly pronounced...it's presence is more like an essence.  There is an undertone of tea, but I also used double than what was called for in the recipe.  I think my friends will like this a lot especially since it's not too sweet.

I'm sorry but this did not taste much like green tea even though I added a bit more as suggested. It was moist but it did not have good flavor at all. I would not make this again.

This was good but I really didn't know what to expect. I wanted a recipe for a friend's birthday who loves green tea. She doesn't care for very sweet desserts and this wasn't overly sweet. Tasted more like a spice cake to me though.

This recipe really is so good.  The first time I tried it, I couldn't taste the green tea flavor distinctly, so I added 2 tbsp more.  To make the icing a nicer green color, I added green & yellow food coloring.  I baked this recipe using mini bundt pans and topped the icing with chopped pistachio nuts. . . great as a gift!

This recipe is everything it says it is.  Made it for my daughter's Baby Shower and everyone loved it.  I did double the icing, because I made 2 single layer cakes instead of stacking them.  Added at least a cup of extra powdered sugar to thicken the icing enough for frosting the cakes.  Used loose green tea, powdered in the coffee grinder.  (Be sure to grind extra long) Gave the icing a 'mint chocolate chip' look!  The taste was wonderful, overall a very good recipe, and a delightfully different taste.  Try it!

I thought the idea of the cake was really good and it was okay but for some reason it tasted kinda floury.... i did half the recipe because there are only two of us so maybe i didnt half it exactly right.... i will make it again and try to figure out why it tasted floury!

Very tasty, not too sweet cake. The green tea flavor was not very strong, but it's still a great cake. Like others, I used ground up tea bags (a combo of mostly green tea with a couple spicy chai.) Also like others mentioned, make more frosting; I did 1.5x the recipe.  I would make this one again.

Delicious!  This cake got gobbled up quick.  Like other people have said, the amount of icing this recipe produces is not enough for the cake.  Go ahead and multiply the icing ingrediants by one and a half, or two.  And I would not recommend making this using regular green tea.  Find the green tea powder/matcha/maccha at an Asian foods store.  It is so fine, it looks nothing like regular green tea.

The cake turned out well for me, but not as well as I had hoped. I heard many saying their cakes turned out very moist and fluffy, and although it was good, mine was not so. I could not find matcha, and did substitute with powdered green tea from tea bags as one reviewer suggested. This tasted great, but didn't give the same colour, and a slightly less smooth texture. The moisture problem with the cake may have been due to an error of mine- I was going to halve the recipe to make one layer, but when I went to pick up the yogurt I'd looked at the recipe for the full. So I picked up an 8 oz. cup of yogurt, and thought that was what I had to use. At the last minute I realized I was only supposed to use half (after putting all of it in) and had to double the rest of the ingredients. So the time of the addition of the ingredients was what maybe caused this problem.  The frosting for me was enough- I ended up baking the cake in a 9x13 pan. Overall it was very good, but like many others, the green tea flavor was very light. I did add a bit more of the powder to the frosting and the cake too. Nevertheless, it was  very good. Next time I'd make sure to pay more attention to the ingredients and maybe add a drop or two of food colouring. The frosting looked fine but the cake's colour was a little interesting. I also topped the cake with  chopped cashews to give it a bit of a crunch, and a caramel sauce to give a little more moisture back. Overall great recipe, definitely worth trying.

Great cake. However, green tea frosting was bit too sweet for me. Next time I'd substitute frosting with green tea whipcream.

LOVE IT! 
Tried it last night. I halved the recipe and I misread the instruction. I added the yoghurt together with the oil and sugar. It turned out fine. Next time, I've to add the green tea powder to 5-6gr instead of 4 because I can barely taste it. 
Yielded 9 cupcakes and I reduced the baking time to 15-20 minutes.

very good and original.  the green tea flavor really comes through.  I took the advice of others and used a coffee grinder to make powder out of tea bag contents. The only problem i had was i didn't have enough frosting for the sides so i'd suggest doubling or at least 1 1/2 the frosting recipe.  thank for such a unique treat

I gave this cake only four stars for one reason; It tastes like a plain white cake, a really moist delicious plain white cake. The only changes I made was halving the recipe, and using whole grain white flour instead of cake/all-purpose flour. I didn't try the icing (no cream cheese on hand). I used green tea powder but the green tea flavor was so slight that I don't think I would've known it was even in it! I think the vanilla may be overpowering the green tea. Next time I'll reduce the vanilla and up the green tea.

This cake is absolutely fantastic.  I made a few alterations to my tastes and to what I had on hand.  I used all all-purpose flour instead of half AP half cake flour, 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup light corn syrup, 3/4 cup vegetable oil, and 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk (I found out my yogurt had expired, so I improvised).  I also used loose tea leaves, as I didn't look closely enough when I went to buy the powdered green tea.  The texture was a little strange, but the taste was fine.  Next time I will buy the right thing, though.  The icing is divine and it was more than enough to ice the whole cake (with me swiping fingertip-fulls inbetween).  It adds a creaminess and extra sweetness without being overpowering.  I will definitely make this again, and this time I'll make sure to read the packaging more closely.

AWESOME recipe!   It comes out lovely and moist every time! I like to turn up the heat a little higher so that the outside of my cakes cook a little faster and have a bit of a crunchy crust to them, but that's just me.  Make sure you use fresh matcha powder though! If your powder doesn't look fresh and vibrant green, your cake will look just as brown and taste just as bland.

Delish!  Followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT added one more teaspoon of tea.  The flavor is still subtle, but my hubby guessed it right away.  I agree that it's really important to use actual matcha.  One more tip...if you're icing this as a layer cake, double or triple the icing recipe.  Otherwise you're going to end up with a very thin layer of icing over the layers.  Nomnom.

I tried this recipe out for the first time yesterday, overall it wasn't bad, but there are some slight improvements that can be made. The cake itself was delicious but the frosting wasn't up to par. It was way to runny and sweet for my tastes, it was a battle trying to keep the kitchen clean when the icing was falling off the cake. I took the tip of another reviewer and added in some food colouring, the frosting looked better that way. I could have used a liitle more matcha in the cake, I love green tea so it may just be in relation to my taste buds. The cake was great on its own though, while waiting i took bits and pieces of the part I cut off. I will definatly try this recipe again.

I added the red bean into the recipe. I would recommend adding 1.5 cups instead of the 1 cup. The red bean flavor doesn't come out as strong as the green tea.

I made cupcakes, and they were at hit at my asian themed party. I wasn't that impressed myself, I couldn't taste the green tea, even though I added extra. But my guests gobbled them up so I guess that's what really matters. They sure were pretty.

I loved this recipe. However, I won't double the frosting like others recommended next time I make it. I did cut down the sugar in the cake and frosting considerably and it turned out perfect for the cake, the frosting still needs less. And, I would add more cream cheese to the frosting, otherwise you can barely tell it's there. For the powdered green tea just buy instant iced green tea. I bought the Kroger brand which was just powdered green tea. No need to blend it like others did.

I really enjoyed this recipe.
I made it in a 9x13 pan and baked it for 30 minutes, which was almost perfect time.
I didn't change any of the ingredients.
People at work were a little offput by the colour... but all around pretty successful.

The cake was refreshing, like having a glass of sweet tea.  Green tea powder can be found very inexpensively at your local Asian supermarket, often in the Japanese section.  I used the cake flour like specified, and the cake was light similarly to a boxed cake.  The cake itself was not too sweet and was nicely complemented by the frosting.  I doubled the quantity for the frosting and that was the perfect amount.

Yummy! I didn't use the frosting but made my own from a box and added the green tea powder to it. The cake came out brown even after I added food coloring but was delicious.
Edit: I forgot to add that I only used 1/2 cup of oil and it turned out fine. Probably less fluffy and moist.

I thought this was great! I did the cake recipe exactly as follows and I made a sheet cake which I made into a jelly roll with lite cool whip. It was really great. The icing was a little for this cake and the cool whip was perfect. Don't over bake!

My family absolutely loves this cake. It's not overly sweet and has a wonderful green tea flavor and aroma. I didn't even put the frosting on the first time I made this cake and it was a hit. I do feel that it was important that I used all the proper ingredients called for in the recipe. I ordered powdered green tea direct from Japan, which I feel was an important factor in the success of this cake. My husband has requested this be the cake I make him for his birthday each year. Thanks for this wonderful recipe Suki!

I loved the cake, but the cake wasn't light and fluffy like some suggested.  I couldn't find cake flour at the local supermarket so I used a substitution I found online of a flour and cornstarch mixture.  I will definitely try it again with cake flour.  The frosting was out of this world, but I did increase the amount by 1.5.

I think this recipe is great just the way it is, i loved the frosting.  The only thing i changed was to put more green tea powder in both the cake batter and frosting.  It definitely tastes better after being in the fridge for a day, and served cold.

I've been making this cake constantly for the past few years, simply because everyone keeps requesting it. I do almost double the macha powder (I get mine from Coscto). I cannot speak to the icing, as I've always used my own recipe. I love how moist this cake is and how well it ages. If you can stand to wait, let the cake age overnight. I feel it brings out the green tea flavor and the texture is a little more relaxed.

The taste is good but the proportions need to be adjusted. I believe this would be better with 6" rounds or a bigger batter and frosting quantity. It's pretty thin with 8"s

This cake was fantastic! It's very moist and has a definite green tea flavor. The icing supports the flavors nicely. I love taking this one to dinner parties and potlucks because there is no fear that I might be bringing a duplicate of something!

Best recipe for green tea cake! 
Normally green tea food is special for people to like but this one is a hit among all! I think the cake flour and yogurt ingredients made this incredible.
I did cupcakes instead of cake and it was wonderful..

The cake itself would definately recieve a 5 star rating, however I feel like the cream cheese over powers the cakes delicate flavor. Perhaps matcha powder added to a vanilla frosting or buttercream would suit the cake better.  I will add this cake recipe to my favorites :)

It was delicious and easy. We made it for St. Patrick's Day and my 6 year-old daughter LOVED it! The only reason I deducted a star from my rating is because I made 1 and 1/3 times the icing recipe and it still was barely enough to cover the cake. Next time I'd just double it and probably have a little left over.
The only other changes I made were that I used mostly all-purpose flour and a little white whole wheat flour because that's all I had. I also held back slightly on the matcha powder in the icing because I wanted a lighter minty green color instead of a dark pea green. Highly recommend!

Fabulous and refreshing cake! I used a half cup applesauce and a half cup oil in place of the 1 cup oil and doubled the amount of green tea powder. The cream cheese icing is wonderful!

I tried making this cake and it turned out to be really good! It is light-tasting, not too sweet but has a distinct green tea flavor. The texture of the cake is just the right moistness.
However, I think the filling/frosting is too rich and sugary. I would suggest reducing the amount of sugar and adding heavy whipping cream to the frosting to create a dense but not too sweet frosting. Filling the layer cake with slices of kiwi fruit is also a great idea!

I thought this recipe was great! I didn't like how much oil and sugar it asked for so I ended up modifying it to make it more healthy. I used 3/4 Cup of sugar, 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce to substitute for the rest of the oil for moistness. I also did cupcakes instead of a cake, baked it in the oven for 350 for 19 minutes. The sides were a little more brown than I would've like it to be, so I would bake it couple minutes less next time. The cupcake came out nice and moist and fluffy, loved it! I'm going to try to putting red beans (azuki) or mini chocolate chips!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and it turned out really well! The green tea flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it might be but it was still there. Also, the cake turned a very dark green color when baked. It didn't taste any less delicious, just looks a little strange. ^_~  I made a plain cream cheese icing instead of adding the matcha and it complements the cake very well.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is to increase the amount of icing. I made the 9" round layer cake per the recipe and the icing seemed a little sparse. Other than that, great cake!

I just made this cake into cupcakes and it is SO yummy! I did put more green tea powder though, instead of the 4 tsp I put 6. The only thing that is maybe a bit much in this cake is the oil. (I let the cupcakes rest on a paper towel after cooling a bit to soak up some of it). But other than that it came out great and was really moist too!

Thank you very much for this recipe!  I wanted to use some green tea powder that was too bitter I used half amount of sugar but the cake still tasted nice! There's no magarine or butter involved in this recipe, so I could brag that it not only tasted great but was also good for health =) (I used extra virgin olive oil)

This is a good recipe. I think that you can make this any "tea" you want. I changed it and used a flavor of green tea--green tea with lemon grass. It was delicious!

I made this cake as my friend's birthday present. She and the other guests loved it! I bought the cheapest green tea powder available at the local Korean market, not matcha. I added more green powder and it was still not enough (in comparison to the green tea cakes sold at korean and japanese bakeries). None the less it was very good. I spread white chocolate curls on top of the cake. Oh and if you want the green color to be shown in the cake, you probably should add some food coloring!

This is a great recipe; somehow I end up making it for everyone's birthday (either by request or whim as cupcakes. The cake is light and moist; just don't leave it in too long, otherwise it'll look unattractive.

I've only had problems with the frosting recipe being too runny, but once I adjusted the amount of milk, it's been great. Apart from that, this recipe is a must-try.

This was, in the words of my family, not as bad as it could have been. I love green tea (with  green tea ice cream is my favorite flavor), so I had hopes. It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to my expectations.

This was really good the first time I made it, and the second time I substituted buttermilk for the yogurt and it was extra moist. It's a keeper for sure.

i use 1.5x more green tea powder and i love the strong taste. i use 3/4 cup of sugar to the cake, that was good. im not really into sweet cakes. the frosting was way too sweet for me.
i use whipping cream instead of cream cheese.
afterall, my friends love it, but for me its too sweet and too milky.  but i really love the vibrant color and the strong "bitterness" of the green tea.

btw, i have some problem as the cake didnt develop well, it is way too dense. 
and i wouldlike to subsitute the yogurt, if i could coz its too mily for me.

Very tasty, especially after it rests a day in the fridge.  The cake is really moist and has a great texture, though I found the frosting color a bit too green.

I was dissapointed to see that there was not a hint of green to this cake when I took it out of the oven. It looks more like a spice cake. It does have a nice mild green tea flavor. Not to overpowering. The frosting is good with a good green tea flavor but it needs to be doubled in order to cover the two layers. And I did not like the color of green that came out. Maybe a drop of food color would help?

I don't know if maybe I didn't make it correctly or what, but this cake was awful.  My husband tried to hide that fact but when I said "this cake is gross," he agreed.  I hope other people have better experiences with this cake, and no disrespect to the person who submitted the recipe. It could have just been me.

Overall a good recipe, the cake layers in particular taste great.  Like others, I increased the frosting recipe, since the amount provided will barely cover two layers.  I also didn't bother getting cake flour, and used two cups of all purpose, taking extra care not to over mix. The one thing I didn't anticipate to be an issue was that cooking and decorating with matcha can mean a high concentration of caffeine! In an attempt to amp up the matcha taste, because like other reviews mention the matcha taste in the cake layers is subtle, I dusted the top of the frosted cake liberally with matcha and cocoa power for color contrast. Went a little overboard, and there were a few bitter bites of frosting, and I'll probably have a hard time falling asleep later tonight. 

TLDR:  Cake texture great, double frosting recommended, cake flour optional, subtle matcha flavor can be increased but don't overdo it. Don't serve too soon before bedtime.

Love this cake! I didn't have cake flour, and just used 2 cups of AP flour and it turned out wonderfully!  The Frosting recipe is only enough for a very thin layer so don't glob it on thickly...and you do not need a large amount of Frosting anyway, it's a very flavorful Frosting and perfect in small quantities!

Followed the recipe to a T and this turned out PHENOMENALLY. It was delicious and very moist. Everyone immediately went for seconds! There wasn't a ton of icing so I loosened up a little bit of guava jelly to put in between the 2 layers of cake (plus a very thin layer of icing) and then had enough icing for a pretty thin layer on top and sides of the cake.

So four stars per my modification. I used organic coconut oil and added an extra teaspoon of matcha powder into the batter per the reviews. I also used greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt. My cake did not need to be in for 30 min. It actually was fully baked within 15 minutes. I burned the first layer and had to cut off the edges and bottom. As for the second layer, I kept an eye on the browning of the edges and tested with a toothpick. Perfection at 15 minutes. The coconut oil substitution may be to blame. If you're interested in the coconut oil substitution, I would like to note that I heated the coconut oil to liquefy it before adding it to the mix. Other than that, cake turned out very delicious and the frosting is divine. I wish I had strawberries on hand to decorate the cake with or add in between the layers. I used Rishi brand sweet matcha powder sold at World Market in my local area.

I thought it was ok, but the rest of the family loved it. The icing was excellent, but should be doubled. I think I'll try the icing on a chocolate cake next time.

I've made this recipe as the directions indicated and I've also made it with modifications. All are good. The 1st time I made it as directed. The second, I substituted homemade buttermilk for the yogurt and coconut oil for the vegetable oil (melted and all ingredients at room temp). The third time I used the buttermilk and instead of using all coconut oil, I used half a cup coconut oil & half a cup of applesauce. I liked the springiness of the third cake best. I don't like oily cake and the third modification helped with that.

Used brown sugar instead of white and cut to one cup and used greek plain yogurt. The taste is amazing! It's a bit crusty outside and moist and soft inside. Not sure if it's because I used brown sugar the color turns out brown instead of green! It looks more like banana bread :) will put more green tea powder next time too. Didn't make frosting as I'm not a big fan of but will try it next time!

it is a easy to make recipe and the cake is very light and refreshing; I only use one cup of sugar. It tastes good without frosting. I use mini loaf pans instead. This recipes yields 4 mini loaves. everybody loves it.

I made this recipe as written, except I made it into cupcakes rather than a layer cake.  It was outstanding.  They got rave reviews.  I recommend using the matcha powder.  It is a little expensive, but you only use a little, and it really imparts a delicious, fresh green tea flavor.  So so so good!

My modifications: 2 C all purpose flour, 4-6 tsp matcha (green tea) powder (depending on how subtle/strong you want the green tea taste to be), 3/4 - 1 C white sugar (depending on how much of a sweet tooth you have), and 3/4 C canola oil or 1 C butter (softened). If you use butter for the cake batter, make sure you beat it well with the sugar before adding the eggs. Beat eggs one at a time, and beat well before each addition. Also, instead of beating the flour mixture and yoghurt, fold flour and yoghurt alternately into the batter as quickly as possible. Bake in a single 8-9" round pan, and slice in half horizontally once cooled. For the icing, I used 4 tsp matcha, 4 tbsp butter (softened), icing sugar (to taste), 150g cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 1/2 tsp milk, and 1 C whipped cream. To make the icing, combine all ingredients EXCEPT the whipped cream and beat until smooth. Fold in whipped cream quickly and lightly. Refrigerate for at least half an hour before icing the cake.

This cake turned out nice and moist. Loved it! Definitely something I'll be making again. The icing was really good too. Oh, I forgot to add the vanilla extract for both the cake and icing part and they both seemed with enough flavor, maybe for the next time I'll try it.

not bad at all. i love green tea itself and so, i thought this would be a great treat for the whole family. i added more green tea powder than the recipe called for because i thought it needed a more "green tea" flavor to it. then, as i baked the second layer i noticed that the amount of green tea frosting wouldn't be nearly enough to frost the whole cake. i made more (not measuring anything admittedly) and was able to cover the whole cake from top to bottom. i will try this recipe on cupcakes next time and see how it turns out. meanwhile, i have yet to cut the cake! can't wait to taste the finished product. :)

Tasted so good.  Lots of people who tried it liked that it was not to sweet.  i really liked the frosting.  I didn't have the green tea powder so I just added the tea from green tea bags for the cake.  for the frosting i used our coffee grinder to grind the leafs up a little more. worked really good.

I had the wrong kind of green tea so I couldn't taste the tea in it at all (despite tripling the original requirement). In the end it tasted like a vanilla cake, but it was a delicious vanilla cake. My only complaint, and it's a rather important one, is that it called for way too much OIL. A whole cup? My cupcakes leave rings wherever you set them down, and that's through the paper. Next time I'll skip oil and use apple sauce instead, I think it'd play nicely off the tea flavour. Oh, and I'll use the right kind of tea. ;)

It was moist and not too sweet, just like the recipe description stated. I altered the icing so that I could have enough, and so I could adjust the sweetness. I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 2 1/4 c. powdered sugar.

This is the first cake ever that we were able to finish (and I guess that can be good and bad!)  It was wonderful!  I used instant green tea and it was perfect.  Not too sweet.  My husband loved it!

I made this cake yesterday for an Asian-themed dinner party, and had rave reviews.  The one thing that confused me was when I printed the recipe in the 4x6 print format, the milk quantity didn't print (strange).  Luckily, I winged it and added just enough to make the frosting. I used soy milk also, it worked great. 

Another thing I did was add coconut.  Maybe this turns this into a different type of cake, but a half cup (or however much you like) of toasted coconut (bake in 350 degrees until lightly browned) sprinkled on top and refrigerated was excellent.  I served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  

Also, I found machta green tea powder at Whole Foods (after a long search).  They came in a small box of individual packets that you are supposed to pour in a water bottle.  A little pricey (I used two boxes at $7.99/ea), but well worth it as far as I'm concerned for trying something new.
