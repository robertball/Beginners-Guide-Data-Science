The secret to making these set up is not to boil them too long.  The long 1 minute boil makes them gummy.  I mix over a slow heat untilthe sugar is dissolved then bring it to a boil then IMMEDIATELY remove it as soon as it starts boiling... from the heat and spoon out on wax paper.  We have been using this recipe for years and it is great. I also use 1 cup of pecan pieces too.

In order for these cookies to set up, do the following. Mix the oates and coconut in a bowl and set aside. Place sugar, cocoa powder,butter, peanut butter and milk(I like evap milk) into saucepan. Over medium heat cook and stir until smooth and liquid. Let it come to a boil, now here is the trick, let boil without stirring for 2 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat and add vanilla and oat mixture, then continue with recipe. Hope this helps those who have problems with this recipe setting up.

There is definately something wrong with this recipe. The proportions must not be right because it is far too runny to shape in to balls...

The taste was good. It would be nice if people on here remember that not every one who uses these recipes are proffesional bakers -(when they display the recipe). In this recipe when it says allow to cool that means put it in the fridge,it does not mean allow to sit out on the table and cool. --sorry to be a jerk.

Still waiting to see how these guys solidify when they cool. I like that the recipe is easy and wheat free!

I love these non-baked cookies. I used crunch peanut butter and I add 1/4 cup of peanuts chopped up after I measured them. Which my family liked better the second time I made them. My daughter was help make them the third time and she grabbed my German chocolate powder which got add before we notice what had happen and those turn out just as good.

Very nice. I cut the sugar by half and found these were just right for me. Also, didn't even bother with heating any of it - mixed all the ingrediants together saving the milk for last, and added just enough milk to bring the mixture together. Set just fine in the fridge and was delightful pre-fridge too!

This is the same basic recipe as "No Bake" cookies with the addition of coconut.  The flavor is good, but follwing these directions, you would never be able to roll them into a ball.  The "dough" is much too wet for that.  I think the sugar mixture should have cooked longer to stiffen these up a bit.  Next time, I will leave the peanut butter out of the coconut/oat mixture and add it along with the vanilla to the cooked sugar/cocoa mixture (after letting it boil for a few minutes), then add that mixture to the oats.  I think this will yield a firmer cookie that will set up better.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

I love this recipe, but I do not boil. I just stick everything in a bowl and stir. It is perfect moulding texture and tastes delicious. Only downside is the fact that you get the actual sugar granule texture. I make it all the time.

These are delicious. I used chunky peanut butter for added texture, and then made them vegan. I would recommend using less sugar, they are way too sweet. I boiled the mixture for more then a minute, and then put that in the fridge for about 10 to 15 minutes, making it easier to roll into balls, and to not risk burning my hands. I didn't flatten them either, and stuck half in the freezer for a later date.

Quick and gluten free (if you use gluten free oats)!  My family loved these. I followed the recipe to the T, although next time I think I'll cut the sugar in half and maybe increase the coconut by a half cup for a personal adjustment of flavor.  These looked way runny and I was concerned as others were, I doubt they would have made balls, but I used my dough scooper to put them onto a waxed sheet and didn't mash them down. Then I stuck half of them in the freezer because we wanted them sooner rather than later and half of them in the fridge. Both set very nicely...so even though they look runny, persevere...it's like buttercream frosting, you have to have a little faith. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe...it satisfied my coconut & chocolate craving and quickly!
