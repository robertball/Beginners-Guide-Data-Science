The thicker, richer, moister, denser and more jam packed a "nut cookie" is...the more we love it!  These hit our mark...and surpassed our expectations...thank you!!!

Honestly...we "kick it up a notch with dark chocolate chunks...and sometimes coconut...I also sprinkle with salt or sugar...depending my cravings.

So easy to make and super tasty! I substituted chopped walnuts for the almonds because that's all I had on hand. My husband requested a second batch and said he liked how soft and moist they were. Thanks for the recipe!!

These are simple to make and taste great.  I dipped mine in some almond milk.  They were a little crumbly but they were moist and tasty.  Way better than most flourless cookie options.

I'm not on a paleo diet but had some cashew butter to use. Subbed coconut for cranberries. My one year old twins loved them. Good healthy snack.

AMAZING! I did make some modifications: I left out cranberries and honey- sprinkled a few dark chocolate chips on top- and added a splash of vanilla and a shake of cinnamon- instead of 2Tblspoons of dates I did about a 1/4cup of dates. Made my own cashew butter - everything turned out fantastic!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!! Will share w my paleo friends :) in the future I will double the batch- this only made about 9cookies.

So tasty and filing! Easy to over bake them as the color does not change much so check the bottoms when you check the tops as they are baking. 
I also add chocolate chips and coconut flakes so I get a similar texture and taste to the "cowboy cookies" my mom use to make.

My review is not comparing these at all to other cookies, but comparing them to other Paleo type cookies or desserts. They very much taste like, what they are, baked cashew butter with some added ingredients for texture. It's like peanut butter but much more mild. I followed the recipe exactly, except I made my own cashew butter in my Vitamix machine. My cashews were salted, which I thought would work well. It appears every Paleo recipe I have tested doesn't seem to have salt. I think, they probably needed it even if it is not paleo friendly. I got 14 cookies using a standard cookie scoop. Edit note: Although, I thought they were allright, no one else would eat them. They thought they were too doughy and heavy. They are on board with the light texture of flour, that nuts made into butter apparentely are just missing.

Can't eat almonds so substituted walnuts. Also can't eat honey so substituted maple syrup. Pretty darn good and satisfies my craving for a treat!
