I like to make this with half ground beef/half italian sausage. I've even make this with ground chicken/turkey that I've spiced up with a seasoning mix that makes it taste like ground sausage. This can be made into a supreme pizza with chopped olives, peppers, onion, and mushrooms. This never fails to disappear off of my table and the leftovers rewarm well.

This was good...but I revised it. I decided to add my favorite pizza toppings, mushrooms, black olives, green pepper. I also used a different sauce, just my personal favorite brand. Added about a cup more sauce as well. Sauteed the onions, mushrooms and peppers in a little olive oil with minced garlic. Turned out pretty great, served with garlic bread and salad

This was to die for. The key is to personalize it though. I used a different brand sauce that I had in my cabinet and since the jar was 22 oz, I added an 8 oz can of Hunts tomato sauce. I also used turkey sausage instead of beef and used about 1 cup of mozzorella because that's all I had. I used an 8 oz bag of egg noodles that I had on hand as well. I added some italian seasoning to the sauce before I added the pasta and cooked it for 15 minutes because I had half the amount of cheese and didnt want the egg noodles to get mushy. It had SO much flavor. I will definately make again.

Great, easy recipe.  Nice change from regular spaghetti.  I used small round Hormel pepperoni...already sliced.

Great recipe! I omitted the ground beef and tripled the pepperoni amount instead. I also added extra mozarella cheese because... well who doesn't love cheese and extra sauce?

This was great! Simple to make and everyone liked it. I added the pepperoni in with the the venison burger I was using along with some garlic and onion powder and a bit of italian seasoning. I used a different brand of sauce because it was what I had.  Aslo, I mixed in some cheese before topping with more cheese. Thanks so much for sharing, deffinately a keeper!!!!

Would have been better with sausage instead of hamburger.

This was absolutely the best pasta casserole that I have ever eaten.  I needed something quick to fix a large group of people, increased the servings, and, viola!  Prep time was only slightly increased, due to extra portions.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for something a little different!

Baked Pepperoni Pasta Casserole Haiku: "Not mind-blowing food. Really needs some jazzing up. Still, quick comfort food." Followed the recipe exactly (halved it), even using the Classico basil sauce, which is one of my favorite jarred sauce. No insult to Classico, but this recipe is just kinda "meh", like a pizza-ey Hamburger Helper. Maybe w/ additional veggies, garlic, and seasoning, or adorning the entire casserole top w/ extra pizza toppings would push this to my "keeper-file."

This is perfect kid food, and one of my kids' favorite dinners.  It is so easy to prepare, and pleases the whole family! Goes great with a side salad and garlic bread.

My family of 5 loved this.  I used real pepperonis, like what you put on a pizza.  My kiddos said that made it really hip.  My husband was impressed and he's the chef in our house so I was quite pleased.

I actually rinsed and blotted the pepperoni to cut back on the grease.  I added stuff to the meat when I was frying it: chopped red bell pepper, minced garlic, onion powder, italian seasoning, and some spicy stuff I found in the seasoning rack.  I topped the dish with cheddar but went skimpy on it fearing the dish would be too oily.  

It wasn't greasy at all so next time I'll cut loose with the cheese - I discovered that you need an even coating anyways to keep the top noodles from drying out.  Also, I'm going to sprinkle black olives on top.

I used this recipe as somewhat of a base.  I opted for whole wheat rotini, ground turkey, red onion, 1 can diced petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, 1 can pizza sauce, omitted the pepperoni, added a can of spinach and a can of black beans and used 2 cups of reduced fat 4 cheese italian mix (mozzarella, provolone, asiago and romano).  Followed the directions and added the spinach and black beans (drained) when I added in the pasta.  My family very much dislikes spinach and they all loved this!

I switched this up a tad since we're not big on hamburger meat.  We used pizza sauce found in the grocery store.  Added olives and I would haved added mushroom if young kids weren't joining us. The pepperoni was flavor enough with out the hamburger. Of course this made it less 'hardy' with out the hamburger.

I think next time, I would cut the amount of pepperoni in half and add a can of mushrooms.  It received a "make again" from my boys.

I wasn't very impressed with this at the meal for which I made it (thus only 4 stars), but since I am single, there were planned left-overs (some went in the freezer).  OMG, the left-overs (even the frozen portions) were to die for.  I've always heard, dishes with Italian seasonings were better the second day, and this dish is proof.
