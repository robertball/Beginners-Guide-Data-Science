Great, tasty, unique appetizers. Omitted the salt/cinnamon topping because the filling was so flavorful. All were eaten at our family gathering.

I loved the idea of this but for me they were just way too cream cheesey. I think as a baked tartlet with eggs to bind it together, it might be a little better but raw cream cheese with raw pumpkin just didn't work for me.

Also, the salt and cinnamon combo makes about 10 times more than you need so feel free to make a LOT less.

These were delicious, and very easy to make!  The suggested filling amounts yielded enough for double the recipe. Highly recommend omitting the salt on the top. (1/4 cup is a ton of salt!). Even a small sprinkle made them way too salty to taste. There is enough sodium in the Worcestershire and cheese that no added salt is needed.  Will give them a 2nd try with just the cinnamon on top.  Otherwise, these were really good, and simple to make!

This was great... They where the hit of the party. The filling was very cream cheesy. I think it could have used more pumpkin or something. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5. I made them by the recipe, no substitutetions.

These were pretty yummy. Definitely a different use of pumpkin than I am used to. I did add extra cayenne pepper to the pumpkin cheese mixture. Certainly are a pretty little appetizer.

MAKE THESE CHANGES AND YOU'LL LOVE IT MORE:

Increase to 1 cup of pumpkin
Decrease to 4 oz (half a a block) of cream cheese
More garlic or other seasoning you like (we used a cajun blend)
We also added half a bag of imitation crab (~5oz), but this could be left out or subbed with chicken. 

Want it warm? Bake for 15-25 minutes at 350F.
