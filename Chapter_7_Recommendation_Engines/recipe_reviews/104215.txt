Wasn't quite sure how this sauce would taste, but I am sure glad that I tried it! It has just the right amount of spice to it for a little kick. Hubby and kids loved it too!

Excellent!  I didn't have the Morton Hot Salt so I just used a little sea salt and cayenne. My 7 year old asks for this often. I usually make a skewer or two of zucchini and mushrooms basted in the same sauce.  It's awesome!! Must try!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I can whip this up without even looking at this point.

This is great.  Quick and easy.  The sauce is excellent and goes surprisingly well with shrimp!
