This disappeared quickly at a family Easter dinner today. I thought this would be a dense cake, but it was actually light and moist (which I liked). I will bake it in a sheet pan next time & cut in small squares.  For the glaze, I used some juice from a jar of cherries rather than water.  The juice made it a pretty pink color. Since it was for Easter, I sprinkled the cake with coconut and decorated with some jellybeans.  Thanks for sharing your yummy & easy recipe, Randy!

This sold well at the bake sale this week.  I also used cheery juice to make the glaze and sprinkled sliced almonds on the top to make it pretty.

I needed a quick dessert today using a random box cherry chip cake mix I had in my pantry. I made my own cherry pie filling from two cans of dark cherries I had in my pantry (bought cheap last week for .99 a can at Grocery Outlet) with water, lemon juice, sugar, a bit of vanilla extract and cornstarch. When I made the glaze, I added a tablespoon of butter and a pinch of salt, just like Grandma taught me for a quick glaze. I was able to use a boxed cake mix I had for a while that I really wanted to jazz up and two cheap cans of cherries, which helps me in the long run when we move in a couple months. I appreciate you sharing your dessert, Randy. This was great with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Next time, I might take Lilcat's suggestion and use either grenadine or marachino cherry juice to make the glaze instead of almond extract. I think that's a fabulous idea.

I made this recipe as it is. My husband ate three pieces of this just as soon as it was cooled off. He LOVED it. I will definitely be making this again, also brought some into work and it was devoured that day!

Yummy! This was very simple to make and my family loved it! It was a lot lighter than I expected and it wasn't overly sweet either which was very nice. Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving this 5 stars because it was so, so easy. I didn't use the glaze because I didn't think it needed it. Next time I will try the strawberry cake mix and strawberry pie filling.

The is a wonderful recipe.  I used a french vanilla cake mix and use for the glaze used milk rather than water and it turned out wondferfully.  My family gobbles this up every time I make it.

This was just OK for me.  I personally think a boxed plain cherry chip cake is better than this!  sorry.

I made this cake and cooked it in a bundt pan.  It came out beautifully.  I pureed the cherry and cut down on the water.  Tasty!

Very difficult to find cherry cake mix.  Used strawberry cake mix instead.  Next I will try a white cake mix and see how it turns out.

This was very good.  I used a little green food coloring in the icing and added green coconut to look like a wreath for Christmas.  I took it to a church event, and several liked it.  Very easy, very good.  I'm curious to try putting some shaved almonds in the cake itself and maybe some on top too.  I think the crunch would be good.

This was a hit. I made it for Easter Brunch and I had only hour and half to have ready by. It was fast and tasty. I happened to have a cherry cake and a can of cherry's so it was perfect. I also used some of the cherry juice for the glaze turned out great. It was very moist and light at the same time. Thanks for the recipe.

This is easy and it is good.  It takes closer to 90 minutes to bake than the given time though.  I'm wondering how well it would work with other flavors of pie filling.  Lemon, perhaps.

This is the best cake I have ever done.  Took me a few stores to find the cake mix but well worth the time.  My husband was to have taken some to work today and he claims he "forgot" - he just didn't want to share.  Thanks Randy!

Good & easy recipe.  One of the few recipes I didn't change or alter.  With all the other Christmas cooking it was nice to have something this simple to prepare--and it looked very fancy.  I did finely chop a few marachino cherries and added to my glaze.  They added good color for Christmas--see the pictures.  I was wishing I had a few green marachino cherries as they would have made a very pretty garnish.

This was an easy and delicious Easter cake. The only change I made was that I used a reduced sugar cherry pie filling and I did not glaze with the powdered sugar glaze (though I think it would be wonderful-just trying to cut the sugar). It was a hit served with a lite whipped cream.  I found that it sliced really nice after being frozen and refrigerated to thaw. I am looking forward to trying this same recipe with blueberry pie filling and white cake. Yummy and simple!

Followed the directions exactly. Too sweet. The Cherry cake mix gave it an artificial flavor that was not tasty. Threw it away.

My neice brought this to a family potluck. Even though I had already declared that I was cutting back on sugar and wasn't having dessert, I had two pieces. It's moist, and full of cherry flavour. Yum!

Pretty good and easy cake. It had a very artificial taste, but that was to be expected. Maybe I will try just a vanilla cake mix next time. But everyone loved it so that's always a plus.
