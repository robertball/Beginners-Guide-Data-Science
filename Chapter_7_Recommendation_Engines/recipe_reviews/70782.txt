I wanted to make a decent dinner but I was low on ingredients. I took a quick look around the kitchen, came back and plugged in some ingredients, and up this popped. To be honest, I didn't have mushrooms and I didn't have white wine. I went ahead and just doubled the onions and used red wine instead(I know). When everything was mixed together before baking I was a little worried that my "batter" mixture was like dipping the chicken in oatmeal. However, I shrugged off the texture and gave it a go. I was actually pleasantly surprised. It bakes up like a casserole and is excellent over rice. The chicken came out moist and the sauce was more like a tangy stuffing with all the crushed cracker.

One addition made a big difference. Before I put the "casserole" in the oven I crushed half another packet of crackers over the top. At first I thought I made a mistake because these seemed to burn, but in the end it actually added a good crunch.

I made some changes. I can't have spices so I left off the cajun season and ground cayenne pepper. I didn't have any mushrooms so they were left off too.  But the chicken came out DELICIOUS.
I agree about cutting down on the butter and I would maybe add more cracker crumbs to make it a little crispier.  The sauce that it makes is wonderful.  My daughter who eats like a bird, had two helpings.  I served it with rice.

I fixed Eric's baked chicken last night and my family told me it was the "best" chicken dish they've ever had and that I could fix it again anytime! And to top it off, it was EASY!!

Tasty, but I would probably cut the butter next time.  Left out the mushrooms.  Used minced garlic instead of powder, cooking lightly with the onions first.  Easy enough and good flavor.

I agree with those who said that this is basically a crustless chicken quiche. The spice blend is delicious. Will make again, but in a crust and with the chicken chopped up.

I don't know who Eric is but Thanks this is a great recipe and will become one of our weekly meals. I replaced some of the butter with olive oil and one of those heart healthy spreads and fat free ranch dressing and it was super. I take this to pot lucks and ect. Thanks again

I guess I must have cooked this too long....it was like eating a piece of not very flavourful chicken surrounded by some quiche.  I had no sauce left, just crust.  I may try this again and reduce the eggs to one.

Aside from forgetting to halve the breasts, this turned out very well! My boyfriend and I cleared our plates, and didn't feel overly stuffed. I will say though, I was concerned about the actual amount of Ranch dressing I consumed, and next time will use a substitute (fat-free, homemade?).  Based on previous comments, I reduced to one egg which worked perfectly, and I did sprinkle some crumbs on top for that added crunch. 
NOTE: You do not need a side dish for this meal! We almost made rice, but were SO glad we didn't. Maybe a salad? But nothing that takes up space ;)

I dislike mushrooms so those bit the dust.  But I did do all the butter/egg gunk stuff as is and had no issues with it.  And I didn't think it tasted like quiche.  I used half saltines and half buttery crackers that I had left over.  It came out fine and was good, though nothing fabulous.  And was reasonably easy -- not like some of my fave super easy chicken stuff, but no big hassle either.  Not a fan of dipping stuff but this wasn't a big deal (I guess cause it was one quick dip, plop in the pan and done.)  Unfortunately I don't normally have ranch dressing around or I might make this more often, but as a matter of fact was trying to use up the rest of some packaged ranch I'd made.  So this'll be a good recipe next time I DO have ranch around.

This recipe was excellent. Everyone loved it. The ingredients sounded like a strange combination but they made for a very good chicken recipe!! I will make this again.

It was an odd combination, chicken breast surrounded by quiche. The chicken was moist but had very little flavor, and the "coating" was very spicy but good! It gave me an idea for a brunch recipe, minus the chucken breast.

Tasted pretty good, although it was a little bit spicy.  (You may want to cut the cayenne in half.)
The eggs and crackers seem to be an odd addition and formed a "crust" around the chicken. There was quite a bit of butter floating in the sauce so you might want to decrease the amount of butter.

I couldn't see the point in using the eggs or so much butter, so I eliminated the eggs and used less than half the butter.  The chicken was very moist, but just okay on flavor.  I've had better baked chicken with much less effort.

This was not very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I'm not sure why the eggs or crackers were needed.  The ranch/white wine combination just didn't work for me - tasted sour.  My husband liked it - but I won't make it again.

This was fine, the flavors were ok- personally I would back off of the ranch dressing and up the mushroom and onions as they got a little lost in the sauce.  I disagree with the "crustless quiche" comparison made by other reviewers as there was nothing remotely quiche-like about the way this baked up.  The chicken pieces were very much in a sauce- 24oz of ranch dressing is a LOT and even 3 eggs won't make this a quiche.  Nonetheless, the flavor was decent.  A decent meal, though not good enough to repeat.
