Followed recipe exactly (with the exception of the espresso powder-didn't have) and mine did NOT look like the picture! It wasn't fluffy. Looked more like pumpkin pie. But it was a nice dessert, not super sweet. I didn't think there was enough of the coffee flavor but it might be because I had to use instant coffee instead of espresso powder. I would make it again.

These were delicious, I will make them again. I started with the cream cheese at room temp and pulled the pan from the oven when the center was still not fully set.  The center set up in the pan as it cooled on the counter. I didnâ€™t have any issues with cracking.

This was the first time I made this and with a few changes, I will make again because the final product is quite good!  
SKIP WAX PAPER!  (butter your 8x8 pan instead) 
Crust:  Add 2 Tablespoons of granulated sugar to the graham crackers.  (I baked mine for 10 minutes at 350 and allowed to cool before adding 1st layer)
This is what I intend to try next time...  For the Latte layer, pour on top of cooled graham cracker crust, then chill until firm...  or put in the freezer to make this happen faster.  Once it's firmed up, pour in the pumpkin layer.  Otherwise, it seems unavoidable the flavors will mix.  *I* preheated the oven to 350, then turned it to 290 and baked for 60 minutes, turned the oven off and left the dessert in the oven to cool for a few hours... from past experience w/cheesecake, this avoids the fast cook/cool and sunken/cracked or discolored cheesecake.  After a few hours cooling in the oven... THEN I put in the fridge to chill.

Overall, a nice dessert for pumpkin and coffee lovers. Made as directed and will make again with tweaks. Will increase the sugar to 1/3 cup and  taste test from there, not quite sweet enough for my crew. I didn't have quite enough butter for the crust so it didn't hold together as it should have. My fault and an easy fix. This is definitely going in the family recipe file.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out just Ok.  The texture seems to be off, and the flavors don't really compliment each other.  I don't think I'll try again.

Made exactly as printed. The cheesecake flavor was pronounced and so was the pumpkin flavor, tasted like pumpkin cheesecake. But did NOT look like the photo; it was flat and only a little color variation between the 2 layers. Disappointing and won't be making again.
