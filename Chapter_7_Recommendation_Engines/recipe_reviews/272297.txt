It was great.  Quite frankly I didn't follow the recipe that closely due to ingredients on hand but what I did turned out great

Wow! This recipe is big on flavor!!! I haven’t made any Tai food and this recipe not only doesn’t disappoint, but it has awakened me to a new type of food to experiment with. This is a very simple recipe to make, but the flavors are very complex. For me, I would leave out the tomatoes because they don’t add anything essential to the recipe. In the recipe, the basil was only added at the end...so I added a bit towards the end of cooking and then used more as a garnish. I mean, 1/2 cup of basil and you can do a lot of things! Also, possibly make up extra sauce just in case  anyone wants a bit more because it is super good! Thank you for a great recipe!
