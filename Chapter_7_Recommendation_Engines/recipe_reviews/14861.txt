Oh my God! I have been making this salad for ever, not this one exacly but a version of it.  Since I'm from Guatemala, all the salsa-like dishes are very popular.  No only is this delicious but also healthy and hip-friendly.
What I do different is that instead of the dressing i use lemon, salt, pepper and just a little olive oil.  This helps to enhace the flavor of the other ingredients, not fight them.
I use about 1/4 cup of fresh, chopped cilantro (the flavor secret herb!), fresh chopped tomatoes (you are going to see the difference in flavor, consistency and low the sodium), 1 clove of fresh garlic instead of the powder one.  I use the beans i cook (we always have home cooked beans in almost every home in Guatemala)but have try the canned ones, just rinse them and let them dry, the same with the sweet corn.  The jalapeno is optional for me, since i don't like spice food I leave out, but for the guys I added.  One last thing, let stand on the fridge for at least 1 day to let all the flavors come together.

This recipe goes in my "all time best" file!  Excellent flavor.  I did make a couple of changes for the better:  Use green onion (3 w/tops) instead of regular onion, used 1 cup of frozen super sweet corn instead of canned, used 3-4 pieces of minced garlic instead of the powder, used chopped grape tomatoes instead of canned, used Good Seasons Zesty Italian following the lower fat recipe on the package, added a big pinch of chili powder, cumin and salt. 
There has never been one bit of this left!  You will love it!

I have to agree with everyone, its definately addicting! I, like others, added a little cilantro, two fresh tomatoes, and two cloves of garlic. Because the chips I served were salty, I left off the Zesty Italian Dressing, and used an additional can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes. With the additional ingredients it tasted more like a salsa rather than a salad.

This was good.  From all of the rave reviews, I may have initially been expecting it to be a little better.   But I have to say, this salsa really is addicting.  One that you find yourself mindless munching on and going back for more.  Did make the following minor changes - used frozen corn (thawed while marinating), only half cup of dressing, added fresh garlic, 2 seeded plum tomatoes (in addition  to the canned), juice of 1 lime, a little cumin, fresh Cilantro and then added Avocado just before serving.  Personally, I think the above changes (especially the Cilantro and Avocado) add to this dish.  Marinating salsa overnight really helps improve the flavor.  May continue to tweak recipe slightly, but will definitely make this again!  Thanks!  FYI - For those who don’t care for black-eyed peas (like me), you really can’t taste them once done.

I have made this recipe 5 times already and people claim it is addictive! I agree and LOVE this recipe! It is colorful and fun to make, and like someone else mentioned, you can't mess this one up. I put this in pita's with turkey, eat it with chips and have simply ate it right from the bowl on a spoon! I've made small changes each time I have made this and yes, it is even better the next day.

Today's batch went something like this:

Frozen sweet corn instead of canned, fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned, 1/2 cup each red and orange bell pepper for color and sweetness, I omit the green pepper. Red onion for color, fresh chopped garlic instead of powder, 1/4 C red wine vinegar, 1/4 C rice vinegar 1/2 C italian dressing. We are not cilantro lovers so I do not add that but many others do.

Delicious, easy, and fresh tasting!  Great for summer BBQ's.  I used fresh tomatoes and jalepenos instead of canned.  I also added a heaping half teaspoon of cumin.  Here is a good suggestion to improve the "soupy-ness"- Prepare a day ahead, and then drain the excess liquid right before serving.  It still has all the flavor because it had time to marinate, but it is not so liquidy.

I've never had so many requests for a recipe! I've made it several times in the last few months and added a few changes.  For the Italian dressing, we like Ken's Red wine vinegar and olive oil, a can of drained hominy for a fun texture, a clove of fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic salt, green onions (all I had at the time) plus their tops, 1/2 a teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 a teaspoon of chili powder, two to four roasted jalapenos (depending on where it's being served) and like everyone else, cilantro and lime juice.  I whisk all the dressing ingredients together while I drain and rinse the beans.  Addicting!

I love this stuff!  I made some last night and it was good even though the beans, etc. didn't have long to marinate in the dressing.  I omitted the garlic powder since the dressing I used is pretty garlicy.  I used Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian (I think that's what it's called).  I was going to use fresh cilantro, but accidently picked up parsley, so I ended up using dried cilantro which was fine.  I used fresh chopped cherry tomatoes and one small jalapeno.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and just added onions and bell peppers to my taste.  ***One thing to note:  I happened to have this recipe and I only made it once.  A friend made this for a get-together and I loved it.  She gave me the recipe and I made it and I didn't like it even a little bit.  Now that I think about it, it must have something to do with the brand of Italilan dressing I used (which was probably Kraft Italian).  So, just make sure that you use a dressing that you like when you make this.

Loved it!  I used 2 chopped fresh jalapeno peppers (seeds and membranes removed) instead of the canned ones.  Also drained the black-eyed peas and omitted the onion.  Thanks for the recipe!

We absolutely loved this, and wouldn't hesitate to make it again. The changes I made: used canned Jackson Wonder Beans and Scarlet Runner Beans, and plan to use them in the future, as well. As suggested by others, I used frozen sweet corn instead of canned, and used green onions instead of onion. Added some lime juice, 2 cloves fresh garlic, salt/pepper, chilli powder, cumin, and fresh chopped cilantro. The cilantro really brought out the other flavours. If possible, use fresh tomatoes and fresh jalapenos. (Membranes and seeds removed.) It's so much tastier! Used half a red bell pepper and half a green bell pepper for added color. Used Newman's Own Light Italian. Quite a bit of chopping, but more than worth it. Yumm!

I am SOOOOOO glad that I read the previous reviewer's suggestion to use lime/lemon juice and olive oil dressing because this was seriously the most amazing salad/salsa I have ever had!  Even my girlfriend who usually doesn't like this kind of thing could not stop eating it on chips.

Changes I made per other reviewers:  frozen (thawed) corn, fresh chopped garlic instead of powdered, and about 1/3 cup cilantro, chopped.  I also did not use the Italian dressing but made my own dressing using juice of 2-3 limes, 2-3 Tbs olive oil, generous pinch of salt & pepper & cumin.

I actually preferred the canned chopped tomatoes as I am not fond of fresh tomato and I used a whole orange bell pepper and extra corn to make up for not using the black-eyed peas.

MMMMMMMM...Instead of using the Italian dressing I juiced a lime and put that in with about 1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro...it was FANTASTIC!!! So fresh and flavorful, definitely a keeper! And I must add that my dad and grandma who are GREAT cooks came to me later for this recipe, I was flattered! Seriously, you should try this!

This was just ok.  Reading some of the other reviews, I used only half a cup of dressing..still was a bit much, maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup would be ok.

I took this to a work potluck and everyone raved about it. However, after reading others' reviews I decided to change a few things. I omitted the Italian dressing, and used 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (about 6 limes) & 2 TBSP. olive oil instead. I also added one clove of minced garlic, 1 tsp. ground cumin, 1 avocado cut into small chunks and a handful of chopped fresh cilantro. I served it with Fritos Scoops rather than tortilla chips and liked the change. This salsa makes a great presentation and is very hearty and delicious. It is definately a keeper!

This is a great recipe as written, but make a double or triple batch and make another meal out of it as well...put a couple of frozen skinless chicken breasts in a crockpot, pour your leftover black bean salsa over it and cook on low for 6-8 hours. Drain juice and serve in warm flour tortillas with a little cheese...It's great!

Awesome!!  I did use fresh roma tomatoes in lieu of canned and I always salt/pepper my tomatoes before adding to any type of salad or salsa recipe.  I used pickled jalapeno slices that I diced as well.  This recipe is superb!  We are hard core snackers and this will be a staple in our fridge from now on:).

This is Great!! Nice change from regular salsa/ queso or even taco dip for company! I went with a few other suggestions and used frozen sweet corn vs. canned. 2 whole fresh tomatoes chopped. A Lg. pinch of cumin, chili powder and salt (to taste). I then also used minced garlic and added chopped fresh cilantro!!!

This is definitely the best homemade salsa I've ever had or made.  It even impressed a very critical in-law in my family.  Adding a handful of chopped fresh cilantro compliments this well.  This is good as a dip, side dish or on burritos.  The longer it sits, the better it tastes!! Hats off to you Susan.

This was just okay. It was full of good beans and corn- but lacking spice and any real flavor.

Most excellent recipe.  I have made it twice.  Everyone loves it.  Very easy to make in a pinch, allthough it tastes better the longer it sits.

This dish was gone in record time!! Everyone loved it including the kids. Made 2 slight chages, used Newmans olive oil and vinger dressing and used canned chopped tomatoes with chilies.

Too yummy! Very addictive.
I did add fresh chopped cilantro and it added some nice extra flavor. I also diced the green pepper to small pieces (spreads out the flavor better)

OK WOW! YUMMY.  Not only did this taste great, but the presentation with all the color in this was perfect!  We ate it for days after kept in the fridge well.  My 3 year old ate it every chance he could. What a keeper!  Thanks.

This is excellent! I've made it a few times and everyone loves it. It really gains flavor as it sits overnight. Serve with Fritos or Scoops for a great appetizer. I use a 16 oz bag of frozen white corn. I also cube avocado into the dip right before I serve it.

Awesome flavor!  I took the whole batch and spun in a few times in the processor, to preserve some "chunkiness" but also create a little sauciness that would stick.  You can do that with any combination of ingredients.

Sheesh, I might serve that over pasta. :)

I really enjoyed this salsa because it's different.  I omitted the black-eyed peas, and used an orange bell pepper, red and green onion, fresh roma tomatoes (seeded) and 4 roasted fresh jalapenos (rubbed with oil, salted and set under broiler - a few minutes, turning frequently until roasted).  I also only used 1/2 cup Ken's italian dressing.  Next time I will probably add more jalapenos - it was not spicy enough for me!

This is delicious. It's good as written, but I agree with other reviews - using fresh tomatoes and a simple vinagrette really elevates this dish.

Excellent healthy recipe! Served this right after midnight New Years Eve *Black Eyed Peas served on New Years Day. Big hit, easy prep, let sit. We like a lot of lime flavor with our salsa, so added another lime. Yummmy!

Sub fresh salsa for onion,pepper,tom.  Not quite a cup of italian. Might actually try a little less next time. Added some hot salsa for heat and cilantro.  I made the day before.  This was one of the biggest party hits.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I can use to substitute for the black eyed peas?  They aren't available anywhere I have looked.  Maybe they aren't carried in Canadian stores.

This recipe is bland. I tried making it twice because of all the rave reviews, but it just has no flavour.  The first time I followed the directions exactly; the second time I added 1/2 cup cilantro and lime juice, but the results yielded the same absence of flavour.  I found myself rereading all the positive comments and wondering if I wsa doing something wrong.  I feel a little guilty about rating this dish two stars when so many others truly enjoy it.  No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I still could not coax out any flavour from this salsa.

It is a healthy dish, but I will not be making this again.

I get requested for this recipe often at work and my daughter absolutely loves it.  I use red pepper, instead of green, I use 3 large plum tomatoes, instead of canned, also fresh garlic, and finally, red onion instead of regular.  I've used both zesty Italian dressing, regular Italian or low-fat, good with any of them.

Took this to a party for a co-worker.  It was a HUGE hit!  I wasn't sure how it would turn out at first, but I could not stop eating it the whole night!  It made a lot, so be prepared to have a lot of it.  This one will be made again and again.

This salsa literally saved my dinner! I made a grilled dish that I flubbed (pretty much inedible). I had made this salsa to accompany it (as a dip w/ tortilla chips). It was sooo good (my husband has made texas caviar for years & even he  grudgingly admitted that this was MUCH better). So while we are sitting there making salsa & chips our impromptu dinner, I got a brainstorm. ;o) I got cold flour tortillas (I spread the tortillas w/ a just a tad bit of ranch dressing), cold boiled chicken, a couple of lettuce leafs, a bit of shredded jack cheese & made wraps, using plenty of this fabulous salsa. It was wonderful!!!! Thanks for saving my reputation & ending hubby's teasing about my inedible dinner...he couldn't talk w/ his mouth full. LOL I forgot to add that I did add fresh chopped cilantro to this & it was a great addition!!!

To die for! To the original recipe I added an extra can of black beans, substituted Rotel for the canned tomatoes, added 1 teaspoon cumin, chopped fresh cilantro, a teaspoon of lime juice and used Zesty Italian Dressing. I serve it with scoop tortilla chips.  It’s a good thing it makes a lot because I’ve had to send home care packages with party guests. My sister who lived in Arizona pulled up a chair to the buffet table and sat there and ate it. I am forever giving out the recipe and as other reviewers have said, there is no end to its versatility. You can add it to salads, tacos & burritos, on hamburgers, chicken breasts & baked potatoes and in scrambled eggs & breakfast burritos. Highly recommended.

Delicious, I only made a few changes, I grilled fresh tomatoes and jalapeno peppers to give it a little smoked flavor a tip I picked up from a Spanish neighbor, and added fresh cilantro. I also used lemon juice and olive oil like other reviewers did.

Super tasty although I used garbanzo beans instead of black eyed peas since I don't care for black eyed peas.  I did take others advice and season with 2 lemons, 1/4 c italian dressing (thought 1c would be a bit much), 1/4 c jalapeño vinegar, and italian seasoning!  Will most def make again for get togethers!

I had high hopes for this recipe but wasn't super excited with the result.  I let it marinate overnight but still didn't think it had a ton of flavor.  Was good heated in a wrap with some cheese, but I prefer just a yummy salsa for chips and dip.  Thanks though.

I made this to take to work and it is fantastic! I didn't use the salad dressing...just the juice of 1 large lime. It was perfect. The only other change I made was to add a little cilantro. I will definitely make this again!

If you don't have Italian dressing, try boiling together 1/2 c each of oil vinegar and sugar.  I add a little S&P with it, maybe a dash of garlic powder if I'm moved...  My girls gobble it up.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.

I made this for the Superbowl and it was great! Much better than I would have imagined just by reading the ingredients. I don't think it's necessary to use the entire amount of Italian dressing. I used 1/2 as much and it was plenty. Will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe, but I went further and added fresh avocados-2, spiced with garlic powder, cumin and fresh cilantro! I used Ro-tel spicy tomatos with jalapeno and 1-can of Ro-tel Mild tomatos..and I don't like the black beans so I doubled the black-eyes! It was wonderful! Everyone at my Superbowl party raved about it, I am usually the one who makes the 7-Layer dip...and this one was exceptional!

completly addictive!  I may add a bit more garlic and more jalapeno peppers next time though, or add it when I get home from work today... even my husband who HATES the texture of beans likes this..

I didn't think this salsa sounded very spicy so I made it with Fire roasted Tomatoes but boy was I wrong!  This recipe would have been perfect if I would have left it alone and next time I will use regular diced tomatoes.

I thought this was a very good basic black bean salsa.  I used fresh jalapeno peppers, fresh tomatoes, two cans of black beans and no black-eyed peas (my husband doesn't like them) and frozen corn instead of canned corn.  Next time I will add more "spice" because it was not spicy at all, but it was very good... and healthy!

So easy! Instead of Italian dressing, I just mixed a bit of my own: Red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar, olive oil, and some dried italian seasoning. Also, I froze half for later.

Fabulous! I made this for the first time last night and it's great right out of the gate. I did use frozen corn, fresh tomatoes and fresh garlic. Everyone in my house loved it. It was such a treat, I'm making it again soon to share at work. I agree with the other reviews. You will love it.

I take this to potlucks, scrapbooking get-togethers and other parties often, and it is always very popular. It is easy to throw together, tastes better if it sits overnight, and is also good alongside Mexican entrees like  enchiladas and huevos rancheros. Pretty healthy, too, if you use light salad dressing.

Absolutely loved this, it was so flavorful.  I did drain the black eyed peas, and added cilantro, also used frozen super sweet corn instead of canned, and chopped red onion.

I used about 1/2 the dressing called for. Used fresh tomatoes, jalapenos, garlic and added cilanto, avacado, lime juice and salt. It was very good this way. A wonderful healty dip.

Excellent and so easy to make!  Use 1 clove of fresh garlic + salt in place of garlic salt.  3/4 cup dressing would probably suffice.

This is an awesome recipe.  Tastes great and is super easy to prepare since most of the ingredients are from a can.  Great when you need a make ahead item for a potluck or party and don't have a lot of time.  People couldn't stop eating it.

Was a huge hit during the holidays.  Serve with blue/purple corn chips for added color.  Very fresh tasting.  I used purple onions for more color and added fresh chopped cilantro - about 1/2 - 2/3 cups.  Adds such a nice flavor and authenticity.  Even the folks who don't like spicy or cilantro gobbled this up.  This also makes a great side dish or garnish for BBQ ribs or chicken.  Just double the recipe if you do.

I made this 3 times over the holidays.  
Everytime several different people asked for the recipe.  I bought the peas and beans with a little jalapeno already in the can which was enough for me and a mustis to buy PETITE DICED TOMATOES unless you love big chunks!! Loved it for New Year's so we could get our black eyed peas in! Luck in our salsa!

Very Good!  My only variation, because of kids, was to use the canned tomatoes with chiles and blackeye peas with jalapenos.  This was enough spice to omit additional peppers.  Only used 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dressing and that was plenty.  Good flavor.  Agree that it is better after chilling for several hours.

This is excellent!  It is kind of like a bean salad since it was yummy on its own but also very good with chips.  I made some changes.  I used frozen corn, omitted the onion, used 4 fresh jalapeno peppers and 4 fresh tomatoes, used only 3/4 of the Italian dressing (and used fat free dressing) and added 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro as suggested by other reviewers.

Really enjoyed this salsa, and would consider serving it as a side dish salad.  I substituted a pkg. of dry italian dressing and a dash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the dressing and it worked well.

Yummy. I made 2 batches and froze one for use for a party later. The only change I made was an addition of cumin. I think I added about 1 teaspoon for both batches, so 1/2 tsp should be about right for the recipe.

This turned out perfect. It tastes great and looks very authentic. I omitted the jalapenos and instead added 3 teaspoons of Tabasco sauce. It gave it a very subtle heat and worked very well with the mixture. Also I followed some advice and didn't use Italian dressing, instead I used 1/2 cup lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and a few shakes of salt and pepper. Yum!

I made this recipe twice. The first time made it exactly as recipe called for.

The second batch, omitted the italian seasoning mix, replaced with 1/2 cup lime juice and 1/2 cup lemon juice.
Both were great but I think using lime and lemon juice in lieu of seasoning was better.

I did add a small handful of fresh cilantro

Addicting is right! Made for a party I was hosting and attending. I didn't think it was that spicy, and could maybe use some cayenne pepper...but then some people said that it was perfect as is and I shouldn't change a thing. All in all, very enjoyable!

Odd ingredients that are terribly addictive. I really enjoyed this and made it several times in a few weeks. Nice way to sneak beans in and the kids never noticed. I used black beans only and Rotel tomatoes for some kick. Cilantro really adds to this dish.

I didn't think this needed anywhere near a full cup of Italian dressing and would be better with a homemade spicy olive oil vinaigrette.  This recipe is quicker to prepare than some other salsas because it has canned tomatoes, but it's a trade off: fresh tomatoes (& fresh cilantro too) add freshness & flavor, but also more prep time with more chopping. I'd go with fresh tomatoes if possible.  I substituted frozen corn instead of canned to keep the salt level under control.  I used this as a side dish and had lots leftover, so  I made a burrito filling by combing 3 c. of this salsa with 2 c. of chopped cooked chicken which made four big burritos.  I rolled the filling in flour tortillas, placed in a greased glass pan, sprinkled with cheese and fresh cilantro, and baked for 30-35 min. at 350°.

This dip went quickly! Next time I think I will leave out some of the dressing as one cup seemed to overwhelm a little. Otherwise just delicious!

Super easy and easily adapted (dip, salad topper, tacos, etc.).  Everyone raves about it each time I make it.  Flavors are not overpowering when made per recipe.

I rarely rate something 5 stars but this was so good!  I did add cilantro and one avocado.  I used green onion instead of a regular onion.  It really helps to refrigerate overnight so the flavors meld together.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

This was so so so good! Good for me, too. I used 1/2 red and 1/2 bell pepper, a whole medium onion, doubled the garlic salt, added about 1/2 tsp cumin, several shakes of dried cilantro (fresh would've been so delicious) and the juice of one lime. Took this to a get together and it was a hit! I had many of the guests asking what the ingredients were so they could make it at home. Will certainly be using this recipe again and again!

I didn't think you could get this out of a bunch of cans!  I used fresh minced garlic and a can of petite diced tomatos with jalapeno.  I can't wait to try this with fresh tomatos from the garden.  I'll be making this often.

This recipe is really delicious, but like other's I made several changes.  Instead of using black eyed peas, I used half a can of garbonzo beans and half a can of pinto beans.  I used frozen sweet corn, and fresh jalapeno diced instead of canned (and only 1/4 cup because I'm not big on spicy and I feel it can take away from the freshness of the other flavors in the dish).  I used red onion instead of white onion, and about three nice Roma tomatoes instead of canned, and two cloves fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.  Instead of a half cup green pepper, I used half a cup of a mixture of red and yellow pepper diced (prettier colors and better taste with the salsa I feel).  I also was very turned off by the idea of using italian dressing, so I used, like others, about 1 tbsp or so of olive oil, just a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar (1/4th tsp.), the juice of one lime, a dash of cumin, chili powder, and four twists of sea salt, juices from the tomatoes are nice as well to add more moisture. And chopped cilantro, which is a total necessity as other's have mentioned.  I used a few handfuls, it really makes the taste more fresh and light.  This is really delicious though and a great recipe, and thanks to the suggestions I read I altered it just how I liked it.  That's the fun of it, you can do to it what you want and it will most likely turn out delicious.  Avocado would be great in it, but it browns fast, and this can last probably five day's sealed and refrigerated.  I a

5 stars for flavor, color, texture and varsatility! I often add chopped black olives and fresh cilantro... have made it with pintos instead of black eyes...there's really nothing you can do to make this not work! And once you start...you can't stop eating it!  It is the only thing that "scoops" were created for!  Thanks for a fabulous treat that is easy to have on hand and goes together at a minutes notice!

Listen...I made this recipe last weekend for Cinco de Drinko.  The girls (and, I must admit, the guys too--for you ladies who are considering deployment) went crazy.

It was so good that I am making it today for a BBQ (1 week later).  I am looking forward to spicing up this weekend!

UPDATE (6/2006): I have made this recipe 3 times. BE VERY CAREFUL which Italian Dressing you use.  The first time I made it, I used on the best...most expensive bottle.  Last time, I tried Wish Bone and then another time, Bernstein's. Bad idea.  Also, use name brand canned beans. Your palette will thank you later.

I took this to a gathering of only 6 people and one person sat in front of it the whole evening and couldn't stop eating it!  I absolutely love the fresh taste of the recipe.  I prefer to use frozen corn because IMO it tastes better than the canned.  It thaws while the salsa is marinating overnight and has a crunchier texture than the canned.  I used a can of drained rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes and also added some hot sauce when I didn't have a jalapeno. I added a red bell pepper for crunch and sweetness and added only a small amount of finely diced onion so it wouldn't overpower the dish.  I also didn't use the garlic salt and added jarred diced garlic instead to taste. Before serving I drained it so it wouldn't be soupy.  It's a great recipe that can be changed easily to suit your own taste.  The only problem I have with it is that I can't wait to eat it again!

This makes A LOT of dip, so it's great for parties. It doesn't keep well, so think about halving the ingredients if you choose to make it for yourself. It was a big hit while watching the New Year's Day bowl games.

Great Salsa! Like the others I added some cilanto & lime juice.  It makes a lot so I split it into 2 bowls and took 1 batch to work.  It was gone in no time and everyone wanted the recipe. When I got home that evening my husband told me he took the 2nd batch to his office and they all wanted the recipe as well.  My husband has a boxing party this evening and he's requested I make it again.  I recommend using the new "scoop" tortilla chips for this chunky salsa.

I can go on and on (and on) about how good this is! I doubled the recipe and made a HUGE bowl of it for a party I had, and there were zero leftovers. I followed the receipe exactly the way it was written. Great thing about this is you can use it as a topping for enchiladas or tacos, or just as a simple salsa. Anyway you use it, it's to die for good!

Fabulous!  Just made this with my garden tomatoes instead of canned.  Added cilantro and cumin.  My husband kept stopping by and grabbing a spoonful, he said the kitchen smelled wonderful every time he walked in to the house.  I haven't even had time to let it sit overnight to let the flavors meld more.  Looking forward to having this tomorrow with chips while sitting on deck and watching the hummingbirds.   I added about 6 medium tomatoes.

I made this for my nephews graduation party. That was in July and it was a warm day = not mayonnaise weather. I followed the recipe except that I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, as they are always in my pantry. Everyone loved it. My brother, who is not a mayo based salad person was able to eat it and loved it.  I sent him the recipe and he has since made it a few times also. I served it with the tortilla chip cups, easier for dipping or filling with a spoon.   I plan on making this for holiday gatherings, it's healthy and light.

This was too runny and tasted like bottled italian dressing.  I brought it to a party, nobody dipped twice into it, and the hostess sent me home with my container 3/4 full.  Bummer!

This is basically what we call 'Texas Caviar'.  Instead of the canned tomatoes and jalapeno I use Pace picante sauce.  Very yummy and healthy, too!

This was so delicious! I made a few changes though. I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, and added fresh cilantro too! I skipped the dressing completely, but doubled up (maybe more - I added it to taste) the garlic salt, and it was so flavourful! Such an awesome dish.

Love this stuff.  I also use fresh cilantro and 2 avacados along with the hottest hot sauce I can find and substitute mexican corn for regular corn.  There's never any left after our horse campouts.  Regulars always ask if we brought our cowboy caviar to camp.

Very Good! I went with some of the suggestions- cilantro and used lime juice instead of dressing. Also, I used a fresh jalapeno pepper (only half the seeds) and I thought it was perfect. It was gone in minutes!

I just finished making this for the first time and was a little skeptical of mixing Italian dressing with these other ingredients, but it turned out great.  I'm a garlic and onion freak, so I used a whole onion (about 1 cup) and added three cloves of fresh garlic in addition to the garlic salt.  I can't wait to taste it after the flavors have had time to meld.

YUMMY!!!!! it's a great dish thanks...I did however change it a bit...used fresh tomatoes instead of tinned, red pepper instead of green (green doesn't like me) 2 cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and instead of the Italian dressing (didn't have any at home) I used olive oil, lemon juice, lime juice, dash of balsamic vinegar (approx 1 tbsp), herbal salt, pepper and a bunch of cilantro roughly chopped...will definitely make again and again

I took reviewer Lucy7's suggestions and used olive oil, salt and pepper instead of dressing, and used fresh garlic, cumin, and cilantro.  This was sooo yummy!

I loved it.  I brought it to a summer party and it was not really appreciated.  Come to think of it-I did not have a lot in common with the rest of the guests.  I will make it again and bring it to a differnt party.

Fantastic! Made some minor adjustments: less onion, 1/2c Italian dressing, added some olive oil and balsamic, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, red bell instead of green, frozen corn instead of canned--okay, a lot of adjustments, but still I never would have thought of it without the original recipe and other cooks' comments.

This will definitely be a staple recipe at our house, especially during the hot summer months!

Yummy!  I have made a bean salsa similar to this in the past, and this one is much better!  I added 1 fresh clove of garlic and some fresh cilantro.  I also omitted the corn and added 1 can of hominey in its place (personal preference).  Very good!  Would definitly recommend if looking for something different and healthy.  Great for a hot day!  Thanks for sharing!

I am completely addicted to this.  I bought diced tomatoes with jalepenos in them.  I also added a seperate 4oz can of green chilles.  Petite tomatoes fit better on torilla chips.  Definately make sure that you let the flavors blend overnight before you eat it.  Also I use a white onion (not such a strong onion flavor as other kinds) and a whole green pepper.  Use tortilla scoops - with flat chips the beans etc fall off!  I have also eaten this with rice and it made a fast, easy and tasty dinner!

This is so good! I used frozen corn, fresh tomatoes, minced garlic, minced onion (that was all I had) and Ken's reduced Fat salad dressing and it turned out great. I tried using only 1/2 cup dressing at first and it did not taste as good. Also, it tastes even better after sitting for a few hours and the taste of Italian dressing fades after the spices have a chance to mingle. Although I love eating it with chips, I also love eating it on a salad with grilled chicken and cheese. Thanks for sharing!!

This is a staple in my household.  Everytime we have friends or family it is EXPECTED this will be served.  It is sooo easy and so good!  I put more jalepenos than called for in the recipe.  I have also added a dash of chili powder and some lime juice.

Made for a party - was awesome.  I had a ton leftover, so I mixed with coleslaw mix, shredded cheese, wrapped in tortillas, topped with more cheese and baked till cheese melted.  Yummy veggie burritos!

I brought this to a weekend get together and it went over really big.  We ate it with chips in the evening and with breakfast in the morning.  Half of the girls asked for the recipe.  I used fresh jalepenos and they were not hot at all.  I think next time I will add fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt and likely will add some fresh lime or lemon juice.  It was great just the way it is though.

This is a great recipe, I've made it many times- I substitute a small can of green chilis instead of jalapenos, fresh tomatoes in the summer, and add a splash of tabasco. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the combination of vegetables in this recipe.  However, because I'm a bit tired of the italian dressing addition to so many cold salads and salsas, I used the juice of 4 limes, about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of cilantro, and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, mixing well, and poured it over the salsa vegetables.  It is really great this way too, and adds a *fresh* element to the salsa, because of the lime juice.

Excellent! Made this for a card party we had, It went over very well.  I had to print off some recipe's for people to take home.  Only problem, my husband would not try, he said it didnt look appetizing to him. His loss. Very good.

I have made this recipe several times now and love it! I actually crave it. I use fresh tomatoes in the summer but have used canned in the winter and they are good also. I usually add fresh garlic, cilantro, and some lime juice. Really is addictive.

Very good!  I used 1 cup frozen corn, 3 green onions, 1 cup (increased) red/green bell pepper, 2 green and 1 red fresh jalapeno peppers, 2 fresh diced tomatoes, 1 bunch cilantro chopped, 1/2 tsp cumin, juice of 1/2 lime, and my own oil/red wine vinegar dressing - very good.  Could leave out the lime.

A VERY good bean salad / salsa.  Since the Italian Dressing is a main part of the flavoring, I guess it will only be as good as the dressing you choose.   I opt'd for the standard Kraft House Italian and it turned out VERY good.   Will make it again, I'm sure.

I made this salsa twice in a week and it was a big hit both times - it's my new favorite app.  I served it with fritos "scoops" corn chips - really yummy - but to offset the extra fat, I used lite italian dressing.  thanks for a great recipe!

Took this Salsa on a three-day RV rally with friends.  We had appetizers every evening and this salsa was a BIG hit.  People asked for it every night.  It makes a large amount, so there was plenty (thank goodness).  I had to e-mail the recipe to everyone.  Thank you Susan for a great recipe.

I use this recipe for all parties and potlucks.  I use fresh garlic and tomatoes and add generous amounts of bell pepper for extra crunch.  I also add 2 fresh jalepeno, because I like it spicy. My go to Italian dressing is Newman's Own Lite Italian for this recipe.

Made the following revisions: only used 1/4 cup of Italian dressing, added chopped cilantro to taste, squeezed in some lemon juice, and added Tapatio to taste. It was really great the next day after being refrigerated the over night. I can't imagine anyone using that much Italian dressing in a salsa, but I guess some people like it.

Honestly, I'd have to say, I've never made the recipe "exactly" according to the ingredients listed but using the modifications suggested by Lucia de Wagner.  I'm sure it is great either way -- I just prefer the lighter and healthier version with fresh garlic cloves.  The recipe is great and I'm grateful it was posted because it is becoming a regular item!  Great with tortilla chips, as suggested, but also as a topping/dressing for green salad, on its own in lunches, with eggs and as a topping or side with tacos or burritos.

Omigosh. This Dip is Amaaazing! It honestly doesn't look that appealing, but when you take your first bite, you're Addicted!  I did not put any of the Peppers in Mine and it was still very good with Fritos!  I definitely Recommend! I made on New Years and I made for a Poker Game and called it "Good Luck Dip" (Because of the Black- Eyed Peas) and people just Loved it! :-)

Super addictive. A healthy change from fatty cream cheese or greasy meat appetizers. Only changes is I added cilantro & green onion then chopped avocado right before serving. Do Make well ahead of time so it melds together. I use 3/4 cup of Newmans Family recipe italian dressing & it's fantastic. I am not a fan of Kraft's zesty chemical italian for anything so that is why I personally would not use it.  This makes a ton and is filling, after all it's beans so it's perfect to use for large crowds. If there are leftovers I wrap in tortillas w/ a little shredded cheese or on a taco salad. One of the best appetizer recipes on the site.

This was so good and tasted so fresh.  I didn't want the sodium from the dressing so I just used the juice of one lime and a little cilantro.  Fantastic!

I have made this several times and everyone always wants the recipe. Instead of the black-eyed peas I used red beans. I also used wish-bone red wine vinaigrette and added some cumin. It keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.

This was soooo good!  I used frozen corn instead of canned, red onion, red bell pepper, petite diced tomatoes and dry Italian dressing mix.  I added lime juice, red wine vinegar, and a little olive oil.  I also seasoned with chili powder, cumin and coriander.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband really liked this dip. I left out the onion and bell pepper, requested by my husband. I think the onion would have added a bit more flavor, but I'm not upset I left out the bell pepper. Very good! Also, didn't add as much dressing as the recipe called for. I think it's best to taste.

Oh My God was this an incredible and suculent recipe!!! I do change a few things in it like "lucia de wagner" does in her review. Instead of the italian dressing I use lemon juice and lime juice. I add fresh chopped cilantro and tomatoes and a bit of olive oil. This is always a winner at cookouts. I usually bring with me the printed recipe with my changes to give out to those who ask and rave about it. Thank you Susan for the recipe and Lucia for the review changes.

Great with fritos scoops; all the fritos were gone at the party, but still lots of salsa left. I used red onion and made my own Italian dressing, using good seasons and balsamic vinegar. Instead of canned tomatoes, I halved some grape tomatoes. Yum!

And the crowd goes wild!  I made this salsa for Sunday dinner for friends and family, it was a HUGE hit!  Doubled the recipe, eliminated the black eyed peas and salad dressing and took the advice of other reviews and added lime juice instead.  I also used all fresh ingredients, no cans!  Sadly, I had NO leftovers, but happy it was enjoyed by all.  Will definitely make it again, SO EASY, figure friendly and inexpensive!

Wonderful salsa.  It is my husband's favorite.  I make a couple changes- omit black-eyed peas because I don't like them, add avocado, use more green peppers because we love them.  Also, I make my own Italian dressing from a recipe on this site.

ALWAYS a hit!! I made it exactly per this recipe the first time .... it was very good. The way I prepare it now includes Rotel canned tomatoes undrained, fresh lime juice instead of the italian dressing, chopped cilantro, and 2 TBSP cumin.
No garlic salt or green peppers.

It was good but I wish I hadn't used Italian dressing.  It just didn't give it a "fresh" taste.  I wanted more CrUnCh so I threw in about 4 celery stalks.  Delicious when served with Fritos Scoops!

I had never made homemade salsa before but rec'd a lot of tomatoes this year from friends so decided to give it a whirl. I used freshed tomatoes instead of canned and added cumin. It was the best salsa I have ever tasted and have had many people ask me for the recipe! This is super easy to make and BIG on flavor!

Made it just as the recipe stated = best salsa ever.  Next time around I doubled the sauce and added 8 cups cooked orzo pasta = gourmet pasta salad!!

Great recipe! I followed others suggestions and what I did was use 4 fresh roma tomatoes diced instead of the canned, used the Kraft Zesty Italian dressing, added about 0.5oz chopped fresh cilantro, and two pressed garlic gloves instead of the garlic salt. Try it with the hint of lime tortilla chips...OMG amazing!

This is addicting.  I made this when we had company, and after looking at the bowlful that it made, I was concerned about leftovers.  We had none.  I even used fat-free dressing and it still tasted amazing.  We serve it with tortilla chips, wheat thins, and use it on top of taco salads.

Not my favorite bean recipe so I added some things.  I give it 5 stars with my additions.  First of all, it needs cilantro and some fresh squeezed lime juice.  I used red bell pepper instead of green and used fresh chopped grape tomatoes instead of canned.  I also added a touch of cumin.  I used the "make it yourself" dried packet of Italian dressing.  Lastly, I only had a can of black-eyed peas with bacon in it.  Next time, if I can't find them w/o, I will use all black beans instead.  Not that big of a deal but I don't like the hint of smokiness the bacon adds.  Be sure to rinse and drain all of your beans, of course.

This was really great!  I made this the night before Thanksgiving and the next day it was perfect.  I fixed it with lower fat dressing though and still everyone thought it was really tasty.  I will make this again.  It does make quite a bit.  More than your average salsa jar.  My husband said it reminds him of poor man's caviar.

I love this recipe.  It's easy and tasty!  Although, instead of Italian dressing, I use about equal parts extra virgin olive oil and basalmic vinegar mixed with a pinch of salt and pepper with a splash of lemon juice.  I like to use red onion instead of white because the basalmic turns the white onion brown-ish.

This was so easy, and so very delicious.  I made a few changes to suit my tastes:  I substituted chick peas for black-eyed peas, red onion for white onion, and two diced roma tomatoes for a can of tomatoes.  I also left out the green peppers and jalepenos since I was making it for a crowd.  I can't wait to make this again.

I will never buy salsa from the market again.  I will never buy jarred or fresh.  After tasting this they just cannot compare to quality and taste.  This is a delightful burst of flavor in your mouth and much healthier than the brands you buy in the store.  I didn't use as much Italian dressing as the recipe called for because I like a chunky salsa vs. a saucy one.  Try this!  You and everyone you know will love it.

This was very good; I'd really probably rate it a "4", but I can't take stars away from a recipe I altered so much (and others really enjoyed it).  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (1 w/sweet onion, 1 fire-roasted garlic), 1 can of black beans, 1 can of Mexi-corn, and 1 can of diced jalapenos.  To that mix, I added 3 TBLS EVOO and the same of lime juice.  I also added a dash of red wine vinegar, a dash of garlic powder, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  It was really good, but missing a little something (the obvious would be cilantro, but I don't like it so I was trying to find another way to pep it up).  I really couldn't imagine using Italian dressing, but I can't knock it until I try it.  Next time I will set aside a small bowl to combine w/the Italian dressing and see what I think.  What  a great "go to" when I need something quick, healthy, & easy.

this recipe is delish, but there are ways to make it a little yummier.  I took the advice of a few different critics, and I think it came out awseome.  I used fresh tomatoes, rinsed and dried the beans and peas,added fresh chopped cilantro (which made a HUGE difference, and used green onion instead of yellow.  The best change was to use lemon juice and salt and pepper instead of the itailian mix (less salty)  A huge hit at our party!

This was excellent salsa that continues to keep well.  Everyone loved it at our large anniversary celebration. The only change was to reduce the Italian salad dressing to one-half the recipe.  The substitute was some gourmet olive oil that is seasoned with basil and tomato.  That was a good choice.

Very good. The first time I made this was for my husband's work - I put it together the night before and tasted it the next morning before he took it to work and I thought it was good.  They loved it. So now when I make it for a get together I make a double batch.

This was great, i used light italian, fresh garlic, canned tomatoes. I added some cumin and a touch of chili powder. The cumin changes the flavor, helps to hide that italian dressing taste.I used a whole chopped fresh jalapeno and some green bell.I started eating this right away but it had that raw onion taste, I put it in the fridge overnight, and was eating it again at breakfast. Hope the family likes it so I dont eat it all! Thanks.

It's no wonder this has 5 stars.  Not only is this great the night it's made, it was great 4 days later.  I ending giving out a dozen of the recipes.  Even my NJ supermarket got on board when I told them I needed black-eyed peas (their manager went searching and found them in the organic aisle! It also went great just on salad greens! I will make this for years to come.

Great!  Healthy and yummy!  The petite diced tomatoes are probably best to use.  I used less dressing, probably half, and it was plenty, as others suggested.  Great with Sun Chips or tortilla chips!

Great recipe.  I was actually worried how it would taste, but was pleasantly surprised.  I used "Good Seasons" Italian dressing seasoning packet, followed directions to make dressing, which worked perfectly b/c It makes about 1 cup.

MMMM...  Didn't have green pepper, so used a small jar of pimento, but I bet the gr. peppers would taste great.  Used the dressing from the Classic Texas Cavier recipe on this site instead of italian.  It's wonderful.  You can really go through a bowl fast.

This is a wonderfull fresh salsa.  Is awesome with white corn chips, with chicken or fish, as a side dish or even as a complete meal on a hot summers night.  The only changes that I made were replaced the jalepenos with 1 can mild green chilies (to appeal to all people) used a whole green pepper, red onion instead of white, added 1 ripe mango, fresh tomato instead of canned (too juicy and mushy) and added a really good steak seasoning which includes course salt, pepper, garlic and a few other seasonings.  The pepper from the seasoning will give it the "bite" that it needs.  I highly recommend only using 1/4 cup of the dressing.

This is awesome! So easy, so quick, and so good! I would give it ten stars if I could. I used diced tomatoes with green chiles and Newman's Own Light Italian Dressing. This was a big hit. This is a new family favorite.

not the best I've had, but then again, I'm a Texas girl.  I used half the amt of italian dressing and still it seemed too much.  Maybe use fresh beans, corn, etc, instead of so much canned?

This was so good and I haven't even let it set yet.  

I used black beans and pinto instead of the black-eyed peas.  I also used fresh salad dressing jalapenos and tomatoes.

I added fresh garlic, lots of cumin and cilantro.  Oh, and red onion works great.  In the end I drained off about a 1/2 cup of extra liquid.

TFS.

This recepie is really good! I've made this on two occasions and both times I've been told how good it is and things along those lines. I haven't had to change anything about it and most of the time I eat it without chips or anything!

This is a GREAT recipe! No one is exaggerating on these reviews and that is wonderful. 
I made it for my husbands 30th and had out 3 kinds of chips, Blue Corn Tortilla, Fritos Scoops and Homemade Tortilla from a local Mexican Restaurant. (I recommend getting the chips for a mexican restaurant as they are really fresh, not too salty and fairly inexpensive)Everyone will rave and wonder what the secret is!

I took everyone's advice and made the following changes:
omit blackeyed peas,
added two diced fresh roma tomatoes
only 1/2 cup italian dressing
juice of one lime,
3 cloves minced fresh garlic
Added 1/3 cup fresh cilantro right before serving

This MUST be marinated overnight or longer. This is the best and you must try it soon!!!

I lived in San Antonio for several years and am married to a native Texan - we know this recipe as "Cowboy Caviar". This is a good recipe that you can easily alter to suit your own taste. I don't use black eyed peas, I double or triple the onion, double the tomatoes, add pepper, add cilantro, add a small can of green chiles sometimes - you get the drift. It's all good, especially when you wash this down with an ice cold Corona ;-)

The only thing I added was some hot sauce, as I thought a little "kick" was needed.  There were no leftovers here! This can easily be made and refridgerated the night before. I would pour it over a collander 1st, though, so it won't appear watery.

This was great. Nice and tangy and it makes quite a bit. I left out the black-eyes peas, but only because I don't really care for them. It's a nice alternative to traditional salsa.

This recipe is awesome! Every year I try to find a new recipe to bring to a family reunion and everyone just gobbled this up. I did make a few changes because my son cannot eat really spicy foods. I used canned diced chilis rather than jalapenos. I also used canned tomatoes rather than fresh and chopped green onions instead of regular. Do make sure this is refrigerated overnight before serving otherwise the flavors haven't had a chance to meld together yet. I have also made it twice since the reunion and my family is eating it on chicken, sausage sandwiches and with crackers as a snack. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This salsa is wonderful and all of my friends and co-workers agree.  I have to make it all of the time now.  I do add a whole bunch of chopped cilantro and some chopped jalapenos.  Leftovers keep very well and you can serve it over a grilled burger to give your burger extra flavor.

I made this for my Christmas party.  Not many people gave it a try.  I personally liked it.  I think it would go over better at a BBQ.  I added Fresh chopped cliantro and lime juice.  Every refreshing.

Absolutely wonderful.  Directions are right....do not taste ahead of time....must be kept in the refridgerator overnight for flavors to blend.  Great recipe, will definitely make this a standard dip recipe in our home.

My boyfriend and I thought that this tasted very good. I brought it to work for a potluck and it didn't go over so well. I think it would do better at a party hosted at home. I love spicy food so I put more peppers in the half I left at home for us. I also will use more onions and green peppers the next time I make it. I liked the beans... but I think I will like it more with extra crunchy veggies.

Everyone who has tried this has loved it!  You can add cilantro and green chilis and it makes it even better.  We eat it with scoop chips for the easiest dipping.

I omitted the jalapenos but added some canned chipotle peppers and sauce for kick and a smoky taste.  I also added a small handful of minced cilantro.  Should have added more.  Very easy and good.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and have to say that the best part about this (other than how easy it is) is the fact that I can customize it to the group.  I add cilantro to it no matter who I am serving it to, and I have added jalapenos to it.  The last time I made this, I just split it in half and made only part of it hot and left a mild version for the kids!!

My guests all loved this salsa.  A little cilantro and half the amount of jalapenos made this recipe perfect for me.  I'm not real fond of "hot." It does make a lot, so we used the leftovers on fajitas, yum!

I used homemade Italian dressing; I didn't have a bottle on hand. I omitted the jalapenos since I didn't have any on hand and used garlic powder vs. salt. Marinated overnight. Received compliments but not sure I would make again.

I altered the recipe as per others suggestions so, it was difficult to give this a totally accurate rating.  The bones are there so I'd say this is a solid 4 -  4.5 but, I decided to use fresh ingredients because I had them on hand. I substituted fresh white corn and instead of using the bottled italian salad dressing I used fresh garlic, lime juice, cilantro, salt, chipotle powder and olive oil to dress the salsa. I actually used this to make a southwestern grilled chicken salad.  Very yummy!

Love this but I did not use the italian dressing.  I used the juice of one lime,1.5 tsp of cumin, and 2 cloves fresh garlic. Yumm!  I also added this mix into corn tortillas and put a little crumbled manchego cheese rolled it up and microwaved it for about 20 seconds.  Dinner!

This is great! I chopped a red pepper and part of a green one. Instead of italian dressing I used 1 squeezed lemon and one squeezed lime. I was also lucky enough to find a can of chili spiced tomatoes. Which I wasn't sure of at first but def worked better because I didn't use any dressing. Also couldn't forget a nice bunch of chopped cilantro and fresh minced garlic. Superb!

Sooooo yummy and addictive!  Here are the changes I made: used about a cup of red onion, used yellow bell pepper, used 4 roma tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes, omitted the salad dressing and instead used 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and about 6 tablespoons lime juice, and used 1 large clove garlic instead of garlic  powder. (more would have been good) I added about 1/2 a cup of cilantro. then i added salt.  I made it a day ahead thinking the flavors would need to meld but it is soo good even right after making!

Instant hit. Everyone loved it and its extremely easy to make. Like what someone else said, skip the canned diced tomatoes and put in fresh chopped ones instead. It makes a world of a difference. I think I'll add a little more spice to them next time.

Love this!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I found diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers but I was worried it would not be enough spice, so I added a 4oz can of jalapenos on top of that - spicy!  Next time I will drain the black-eyed peas to make this less soupy.  I will definitely make this again.

I originally made this for a work get together and received rave reviews.  It is so simple and easy, and everyone is always happy to see it when I bring it in again.  I never bring home leftovers, so that tells you something.

Delicious............I make one very similiar actually the same recipe except I add a bunch of chopped cilantro and use petite white corn. I also chop a red and orange or yellow pepper to add. Tastes the best after a day or two so make it well ahead of an event.

This was a huge hit at the football potluck this weekend!  This is a definite "keeper".  I followed the recipe to a "T" and the only thing I will probably do next time differently is use my friend's modification of fresh cherry tomatoes, cut up, instead of the canned ones.  The canned ones were great, don't get me wrong, but who needs the extra sodium and fresh tomatoes make everything taste better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the first time the other day, and it's wonderful. However, I would add a few extra spices the next time I make is, as I found that it was quite mild.

Very good!  I used minced garlic rather than garlic salt, and canned tomatoes with green chiles.  Not a super spicy salsa, but I would definitely make it again!

I have been making an easier version of this for years...SO DELICIOUS!  1 can blackeyed peas drained and rinsed, 1 can white shoepeg corn drained, 1 can of petite diced tomatoes with jalepenos, about a half cup chopped onion or scallions and 4 oz of LITE italian dressing.  Simple with only 5 ingredients..healthy too and it disappears so fast!

I make this all the time, with a few changes.  I use red onion, 1/4 cup green pepper, 1/4 cup red pepper, appox 6 plum tomatoes instead of canned, 1/3 cup italian dressing, some lime juice, 3-4 cloves of crushed garlic, garlic salt to taste, and I add 2 chopped avocados.  My family LOVES this!

I followed the recipe just as it was stated and it was fantastic!  The only thing I would do different next time is to maybe try to rinse the black beans so salsa would come out less dark.

I can't believe how good this is!  Who would believe it's also good for you.  I followed another raters advice and just used some olive oil, lemon, garlic and salt and pepper for the dressing.

takes longer than stated prep time, but worth the effort.  Used fresh tomatoes and jalapeno instead of canned.  Also added cumin. Used frozen shoe peg corn and added a little extra as I do love corn.  Start with only half the amount of dressing as that was plenty for us.  Also can substitute fresh lemon or lime juice and olive oil instead of the dressing to make it even healthier.  Add some italian seasoning if you omit the dresssing.  Also added about 1/4 cup of fresh chopped celantro and 3-4 fresh garlic cloves. This is a keeper!

One of my favorite dips. I have made this so many times, and I'm just know getting around to rating it.  **I use fresh tomatoes!! I add one diced up avocado,some fresh cilantro and fresh minced garlic. Soo Delicious!!!   **Instead of italian dressing,another reviewer suggested using lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, so thats just what I do. It is awesome. The lemon juice and olive oil come out to be about one cup using more lemon juice then oil. Then I season with salts and pepper to my liking!  :)  Thanks for this amazing salsa recipe Susan!!

This is really yummy from the start, but even better when it sits overnight or for several hours. I used good seasons italian dresssing(the one tht comes in a packet and you mix your self in the bottle) and ONE cup of dressing is the whole thing. Yes I will make this over and over. Very versatile recipe. You could use a number of things on hand if you were missing something.

This was very bland, it doesn't taste fresh nor is it 'spicy'.  It is nothing but can of beans covered by italian dressing...then is it italian dip or mexican?  Wouldn't recommend.

Tweaked using fresh tomatoes and peppers, added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tbsp olive oil, and omitted italian dressing.  Came out excellent.

Made w/ cilantro, lime, & fresh garlic like others.  Made a double batch for a cookout, and used leftovers to make white chicken chili - can of chicken broth, 2 breasts, and some velveeta - awesome!!

Just served this at a party and it was the first thing to go, and the most talked about (by far) of all the food, most of which was a lot more effort!

Much better the day after it's made.  I used 2 fresh, seeded fresno peppers (look like red jalapenos, which weren't available), juice of one lime, chopped bunch of cilantro (better when added on party day), 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, sea salt instead of garlic salt, and a pinch of cumin.  The BEST!!!  I'm having to make it again for my roommate and myself since we didn't get much at the party and have both been craving more.

Good Stuff!! I followed what others said and used lemon juice, olive oil, i used kosher salt and pepper.  I didn't really measure these ingredients, I used the juice of one lemon and just eyeballed the amt of salt and pepper.Definitely needs to sit overnight for the true flavors to come out.  I took some to work and next time, I will follow the advice of one of my Latino friends who advised me after tasting this (btw he loved it anyways) to exchange some of the canned stuff for fresh stuff....fresh tomatoes, fresh jalapenos, fresh corn (roasted corn), roasted green bell pepper....  This is a great dish to make that's quick and not expensive at all....When I decided to make this dish, all these canned goodies were on sale, and I only used the store brand,and for less than $10 you got an easy appetizer to serve a lot of people.  definitely use the Tostitos scoops, easy to scoop up all those beans to get to your mouth!!  thanks again!

I give this a 4, not a 5, because I changed a lot of things. I used lime juice, extra virgin olive oil and fresh ground black pepper instead of the Italian dressing. I also used two cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt, fresh tomatoes rather than canned and green onions rather than regular onions. I also added a bit of cilantro. This is a delicious recipe, though, and can be personalized any way you like! I will make this a lot more in the summer--it's so good! Great on its own, or with chips.

This is a great recipe! I only gave it four stars though because I felt it needed a few changes:
1 - replace black eyed peas with one additional can black beans or leave out altogether
2 - replace italian dressing with lime juice and olive oil as other reviewers suggested
3 - add cilantro
That said, this is still an amazing recipe, would be a really refreshing summer dip! Highly recommend!!!

I subbed a couple of fresh tomatoes for the canned and diced nacho rings for the canned jalapenos.  They add a nice flavor and just a little heat.  I made my own dressing with 2 tsp. evoo, 2 tsp. red wine vinegar and just a little garlic salt.  I do think it would be good with Italian dressing but would use far less than 1 cup so it wouldn't be too soupy.  The black eyed peas added such a great flavor.  I'm hooked!

This salsa is unbelievable.  I have made it multiple times and am always asked for the recipe. 
I usually use petite diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers for the tomatoes.  And use a mix of balsamic vinegar and oil instead of the dressing.  I hadn't thought to use lime juice as others have and will definitely try that next time. 
This is much better a day or two after it is made.  We love garlic so I have put in as many as 4-5 cloves and the only salt I use is to mince the garlic. 
Another must is a handful of cilantro.  It is a GREAT dip with chips!  And, we even used it as a side dish/salad too.

My husband and I loved this!  It was healthy and tasted great.  I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and left out the Italian Dressing.  Instead I created a dressing using 1/4 c. fresh lime juice, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, salt and pepper.  I thought it was awesome and reduced the fat greatly.  And since I love avocados so much I chopped one up and added it in at the end so it would retain its shape.

FABULOUS !!  I loved this salsa...couldn't leave it alone !  I read others reviews and made a few adjustments - leaving out the dressing, replacing it with lemon juice; added minced garlic; and used can of Rotel instead of just plain tomatos.  The biggest hit I think was serving it with Tostitos with a Hint of Lime !!!! YUMMY

Made this recipe for my in-laws and they loved it.  Changed it a bit.  No black-eyed beans, added chopped cilantro, 1/2 the recipe of italian dressing and squeezed 3 key limes.  Excellent taste and wonderful with homemade nacho chips.  This is a keeper.  Will do this recipe again.

YUM! I agree to use less italian and add lime juice and cilantro (I used dried). I added some orange bell pepper (that I had on hand) to add even more color to this great looking salsa!  Eat with baked Scoops for a healthy snack.

We had "happy hour" at our house last night, and this was a HIT! Everyone loved it. I added extra jalapanos (we like things spicy!) and lots of fresh cilantro. Great dip with Baked Tostidos Scoops and a margarita :)

This is great. Made while camping. I did add 3/4 of a can chopped HOT jalapeno. Also one whole white onion chopped, along with crushed garlic. Couldn't keep people away from it. Everyone was asking for the recipe. Thanks

This is delicious.  Based on other comments, I dressed this with about 1/2 cup of a white wine vinaigrette that I made plus about 2 tablespoons of lime juice. I added some cumin to a portion of this, as a comparison, which gave it more of the flavor commonly expected from salsa, though I liked it equally without.  Very refreshing and I'll make this again.

OK. I just had to add my opinion.  This is the BEST thing to bring to a party. I've given this recipe out too many times to count!  We even keep a stash of all the canned ingredients to be able to throw it together quickly.

Great recipe! I added cilantro and lime as others suggested and only added a few teaspoons of the dressing. To be honest, it tasted good without the dressing as well. It was a nice compliment to grilled steak and chicken.

GREAT!  I didn't use the Italian dressing, though.  I found an organic sweet pepper marinade/dressing that I used instead.  It added a little bit of sweetness, which I though worked well with the spicy peppers.

Very tasty and refreshing salsa. Easy to make. I doubled up on the recipe cause I had many people over on a Sat night, ended up making to much. But we took it to a second party on Sunday.. and they loved it. Guess the taste does get better the longer it marinates. Like many others, I too added some cilantro and lime juice. I did not measure the cilantro, just added it.  Italian dressing.. I did not fill the cup up all with the dressing, but finished filling it with the lime juice instead. So.. I used all most all the Italian dressing, and some lime juice. It turned out great. 

I had too much food on the table, and so my salsa got hidden, but those that found it, made comments about it. I found with this recipe and the plain red salsa in a jar both on the table next to the chips, people ate the red salsa. I do not think they realized this was a salsa and for the chips. So be careful how you present this recipe, so they KNOW it really is to dip and eat with the chips.

I say besides maybe adding cilantro and a squeeze of some lime juice... run with this recipe at your next function!!

Wonderful! Probably my favorite recipe I've gotten off this site so far! I used green onions instead of regular, added one small diced mango, and used petite diced tomatoes w/green chiles. It was good after only 4 hours, but did get better with more time. We ate it again on a chicken salad with ranch dressing and crushed corn chips. I will make a double batch next time and see if it freezes well. With light dressing, it's pretty healthy too! YUM.

I get asked to bring this to functions all the time.  I do however use a roasted red pepper vinagrette instead of italian dressing.  There are many brands to choose from. The tomatoes with green chilis works good and make sure to have it in the fridge for awhile before serving.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't expecting much from all the canned ingredients, but this salsa was very good.  Everyone at Easter loved it.  I did use fresh tomatoes and added cilantro.  I would definitely make it again.  It's so easy to make, you can alter it to suit your tastes without worrying about messing it up.

Delicious & destined to become a favorite of our family! The only tweaks I made were to add cilantro and use 3/4 cup dressing as suggested in other reviews. This would make a great filling for a wrap sandwich.

This salsa is very good.  I added some cilantro since my husband likes it on anything and it really adds a nice touch.  This is a great mix of crunchy and soft veggies in the salsa.  The recipe makes a lot-No need to double, even if taking it to a gathering.  Very good!

I really enjoyed it! Easy to make, keeps well in the fridge...a different type and texture of salsa. Breaks the pattern of tomato salsas served all the time, and complements them when served side by side. Good color. Will make again!

I made this recipe and served it with sour cream and chips.  It is very good.  I added 3 ears of fresh corn that was left over from the night before.  I also chopped the peppers, onion and tomatoes in a food processor to make in less chunky.  I added cilantro and some lime juice to the recipe as other reviews sugessted.  I included 1/3 cup of salad dressing rather than a full cup to avoid the fat and calories.  I will make this again.

So easy! Delicious! I made three batches of this over the long July 4 weekend, and it received rave reviews every time. I'm making again for a party tonight. I added some Frank's Hot Sauce to spice it up. If you have leftovers, it makes a great addition to a taco salad. The suggestions to use fresh cilantro, garlic and good quality dressing were so useful...the cilantro made this outstanding. Update November 2008: I've made this dozens of times since I first came across the recipe; it's often requested by friends and co-workers. 2 vital additions to this recipe based on the feedback I've received: 1) MUST have cilantro, I won't make it if I don't have it on hand, and 2) I began adding canned chipotle peppers in adobe sauce (chopped fine, usually when I chop the onions) and this gives it an excellent, smoky flavor. Still one of my favorite allrecipes finds!

Very good...and simple, too!  I did use Fiesta Corn, marinated poquito beans with cumin & garlic, and black beans, then added jalepeno's and cilantro.  I used the Wish Bone Zesty Italian dressing and mixed it my self to use less oil.  Made the dip the night before and allowed all the flavors to blend...GREAT!  Will make again.

Very delicious, but I found it had a bit too much juice in the bottom of the bowl.  I think next time I will drain the salsa before serving it to make it seem thicker.

Hit of the party!  I had guests asking me for the recipe immediately and some talking about it days afterward.  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and left out the jalepenos to keep things mild.  Also, to keep it lowfat I used Kraft Free Italian dressing (I just dumped a whole 16 oz bottle) and couldn't tell a difference.

Good and gets better after sitting in the fridge for a few days.  I think the dressing amount is too much and will try cutting in half next time.

Made this for the first time tonight - put a huge portion in a large pickle jar I saved (glad I had it on hand because there's a LOT). As I was stirring and adding final touches (1/4 tsp cumin, 3 minced cloves garlic, juice of one lime, 2/3 c. chopped cilantro, 2 dashes tobasco) my boyfriend said, "that smells good!" He wandered over with a bag of tortilla chips and couldn't wait till I was finished before he started tasting. He loved it. I used 2/3 c. Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette because I really don't like Italian dressing. It tasted great and 2/3 cup was plenty.

THIS WAS FABULOUS and I know it's just going to get better jarred in the fridge. It's a great appetizer for hungry people waiting for dinner.

.... it's tomorrow, and strangely, the salsa is a little less bright and flavorful than it was last night. I added a bit of balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and another pinch of cumin, and it really sparkled up the flavor again.

This is a really great recipe and I've made it many times now. I leave out the onion, because we don't like the taste of raw onions. I also use fresh jalapenos first rubbed with oil and browned in the toaster oven in the broiler setting, then chopped.  Fresh chopped cilantro is also a nice addition.  Fresh roma tomatoes are a must! Definately need to let it sit overnight in the fridge to meld the flavors. Thanks, for the great recipe!

Wherever I take this, I get rave compliments.  I modify slightly by using the following:  red onion, frozen shoepeg corn, black olives, cilantro, fresh garlic and a little hot peper sauce to taste. Cut dressing to 2/3 - 3/4 cup. Also use the scoop tortillia chips to get every last bite.  Thanks!!

This recipe is AMAZING.  I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers by adding cumin, fresh cilantro, red pepper flakes.  Plus I used garlic powder, 2 fresh jalapenos and half cup of the dressing (fat free is good)- I totally skipped the black eyed peas.  I served this with tortilla "scoops" at 3 separate parties and people were scraping the bowl and asking for the recipe--it makes alot-- but it all goes.  my husband is always dissappointed that there are not enough leftovers for him!  The longer is sits--the hotter it gets!  Enjoy.

I made this for our Superbowl party.  I used only half the dressing, used real garlic and fresh cilantro.  I made it a day and a half in advance, and ate half of it by myself by the time I got there!!!  Talk about addicting!!!  I can't wait to put this on a baked potato or chicken breast!  Thanks so much!! 
PS.  I put some of it in a food grinder for my hubby who doesn't like 'chunky' salsa...It turned out a grey, pasty mess (although it still tasted good!)  I don't reccomend doing this!!

Well, my office had our annual holiday "gorgerama" today.  I brought this in & it was a huge hit.  At least 7 people complimented me, and I had numerous requests for the recipe.  One co-worker left a note on my desk that the dish was excellent & another co-worker said it was the best dish she'd tasted at the party.  Even though it wasn't an original recipe, of course, I enjoyed the kudos.  Anyway, I drained the peas, beans, & corn in a colander & rinsed them under cold water.  I drained the jalapeno peppers too but didn't rinse them.  I used a red onion and substituted 2 chopped fresh tomatoes for the canned ones & a tsp. of minced garlic from a jar & some salt for the garlic salt.  I recommend that you make it at least the day before.  Next time I make it, as people say it gets hotter as it sits, I think I may make it 2 days before & then drain it right before serving (saving the dressing for any leftovers) so it's less liquidy.  I didn't drain it this time as I'd made it the night before & wanted the ingredients to marinate.

This recipe is amazing.  My boyfriend takes a spanish class and needed to bring something in for a presentation.  I was a bit skeptical bc of the black beans and black eye peas, but it went over so big, and i can't stop eating it.  By the end of his class his teacher wouldn't let him leave without writing the recipe down.  It is great.

I made a double batch of this recipe for a party and it made so much I was worried I would have a lot leftover, but the guests at the party were scraping the bottom of the bowl. So it must have been pretty good!

Wow! I keep getting requests to make it again and again. I used FRESH garlic, jalapeno peppers, and grape tomatoes (time-consuming to chop into quarters but well worth it!). I used 1/2 cup of salad dressing, but added the juice of 1 lime. I also added cumin, chili powder, and fresh cilantro. I put it in a large tupperware container overnight, so I could easily shake it up every now and then to mix the flavors. Serve with the scoop chips. Excellent.

This was really good.  The only changes I made, were using fresh jalepenos (I used two, which wasn't enough, in my opinion), and fresh garlic.  It made a ton!  Even my 7 yr old liked it, so it must be good.

I use fresh tomatoes, jalapenos, and red onions for extra color. Also, before adding the Italian dressing, I pour as much of the oil off as possible to lower the fat content of the dip(I don't find the light dressing is as tangy). Paired up with baked tortilla chips, this is a great, low fat, high fiber treat!!YumYum!

I put about 3-4 times the amount of jalapenos called for in this salsa. It gets much better as it sits, was the best (and hottest!) after about 3 days.

I have made this several times now, and never without at least half of the people asking for the recipe!  I alter it a bit though, adding cilantro and reducing the amount of dressing. It's a nice, healthier, alternative to heavy, cheesy dips, but still full of flavor.

Don't hesitate with this one!  So easy and so very good.  I added cilantro like so many commented in the reviews -- good choice.  I got raves from everyone at the party and more than a couple people wanted the recipe.

This was so easy to put together! I left out the jalepenos and purchased canned diced tomatoes with jalepenos.  I substituted fresh garlic and 1 t. of salt for the garlic salt.  I served it with Frito Scoops and it was a great combination.  My husband loved it and after sampling, several co-workers requested the recipe.

This is so much better than your standard salsa from a jar.  I guarantee it will be the first thing to go at parties, so make lots of it! I improved on the recipe by using red onion instead of yellow, and adding some freshly chopped cilantro and some lime juice.  Simply divine!

Very good salsa.  I made it on a few occasions.  The only reasons I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because whenever I make it for a party, other dishes seem to disappear faster, which makes me think that other's aren't loving it as much as me and my husband.  I actually think the recipe gets more flavourful on day 3.  Would make again but in half the quantity.

This is excellent just as is but is a super addition to other dishes as well. This is not the typical recipe of the presumed definition or association with the word 'salsa' that we most all have. We followed the original recipe as is, although we used fresh garden tomatoes instead of canned. I like heat but my wife does not, so the recipe as written was fine for her. She jarred her own portion and I added more jalapenos to the rest for my taste. I've also added it to my personal bowl of our own homemade chile and really enjoyed the flavor it added. I did the same with some ground beef Bar-B-Q (sloppy joe) and it again added a new taste that I really enjoyed. Have made this twice and will again.

We have made this for several gatherings.  People love it and ask us to bring it and also for the recipe. It is very addictive.  We always have to sample before taking it because it is soooo good.  I used "Good Seasons" Italian dressing and increased the garlic salt just a touch.  We also use our own homegrown frozen corn in place of the canned corn.

This is good but I will cut down on the dressing or try some of the other recipe modifications in other reviews next time. I will also use fresh tomato and jalapeño next go round.

Mmmmm... this is excellent! Followed the recipe only modifying the amounts. I put less jalepeno so my toddler would like it and less italian bc I didnt have enough. It came out perfect! My family loves it including the 3 year old!

I have been making this salsa for years (without the green bell pepper).  It's so easy and everyone loves it!  I use fat-free Italian salad dressing and can't tell the difference!

May have to try a less zesty italian dressing next time.. it was more tangy than spicy. Also may add avocadoes to replace the bell peppers (didn't use bells since I don't like their flavors). Otherwise pretty good!

Very easy and perfect for any crowd. I jazz it up for friends that like really spicy by adding fresh jalapeno peppers. Tastes better after sitting  for several hours.

Good and easy to make!  Used a can of Rotel tomatoes w/chilis...We like spicy, so following this recipe was a little letdown as it was not so spicy to us - next time will add fresh diced jalepenos & some hot sauce before refrigerating.

I made this salsa for the first time a few months ago and my boyfriend loved it.

Every time we start running out, I make more.

I use fresh jalapenos instead of canned but I think I may start using canned because it's not as spicy as I think it could be. 

Also, I keep some of the black eyed pea liquid in (as recommended) because it thickens up the salsa sauce.

This was awesome! I made it for something different on New Year's Day and our guests cleaned it out! I used 2 small cans of Rotel instead of the can of tomatoes and jalapenos because it's what I had on hand and it worked great. Thanks for awesome new party recipe in our house!

YUM YUM YUM!  I added a can of garbanzo beans (because I love them).  I used red onion for the color contrast...it really is a pretty dish once it's all assembled.  1 large fresh chopped jalapeno is what really made this delicious!  I will be making this over and over again.

It was a huge hit at our Christmas party. I only made 2 modifications to it. I did not use any of the jalapeno peppers because some of the party goers can not do spice and I used a different kind of diced tomatoes with garlic.

I modified this recipe by using only half the dressing (Wishbone Zesty Italian) since we are dieting, adding a little black pepper and a couple dashes of salt, 1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro (as suggested), half a large seeded jalapeno finely chopped (I'm a wimp), about a tsp of lemon juice and less than that of olive oil, and a seeded roma tomato.  Also used Walmart brand frozen sweet corn instead of canned.  I mixed it all up (minus the wet ingredients) in a colander, since some folks had called the mixture "soupy;" this helped drain some of the fluid.

This was wonderful after sitting only 1-2 hours and great the next day. The salsa had plenty of flavor despite halving the dressing, and had no hints of Italian (I like to keep my flavors ethnically true!).  It was perfect both to my Anglo and my BF's Mexipino taste buds.  Note: it does make a LARGE amount of salsa.

I couldn't find black eyed peas so I left them out completely. Followed the recipe but almost too spicy for me! Next time instead of Jalapeno I'm sticking with mild green chilies...But good anyways!

*UPDATE*
Made this again with Mild green chilies and it was very bland, nothing special. much better when made as the recipe is

Quick, easy and absolutely delicious!  Far better than anything store bought, and much less expensive.

Once again, I've just made a double batch for a cookout tomorrow, and I'm certain it will be gone within two hours, with lots of requests for the recipe.

Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using northern beans instead of black-eyed as I couldn't find those in the store.  I am sure that using fresh tomatoes would make even better, but canned was far from objectionable.  Cilantro is a must.  Will definately make again and probably soon!!!

Adding cumin and chopped fresh dill makes this even better. It sounds strange, but everyone that I have made it for has *loved* it.

For Italian dressing:  Substituted 1/4 c. fresh lemon-lime juice, mixed with 1 tbsp. olive oil, garlic salt, ground pepper, and 1/4 - 1/2 c. juice from can of diced tomatoes.  Add salt to offset citrus flavor.
For diced tomatoes:  Substituted 1 c. chopped grape tomatoes and 1/2 c. canned diced tomatoes
For jalapenos:  used only 1/4 - 1/3 c.
ADD FRESH CHOPPED CILANTRO, ABOUT 1/3 C.

Everyone LOVED it!  I added more garlic.  Might try less dressing to save calories.

I was very surprised how good this was.  You have to try it!  I followed the directions except I used about 1/2 cup of the dressing and about 1 tsp of jarred minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.  The longer it sits the better it tastes. Great recipe!

Very good and very light/healthy tasting.  Just made it and already my family has eaten about a cup of it.  I can't wait to take as my snack at work tomorrow after it sits in the fridge over night.  I used red pepper instead of the green because it is what I had on hand.  LFarrell

This was awesome. I made alot of changes, but I think anyway it would be great. I used 3 cans blackeyed peas drained, 1 can of corn drained, 3 firm avocados chopped, 1 purple onion and 1 bell pepper both chopped, 3 roma tomatoes chopped, alittle cilantro chopped, and then garlic salt pepper and zesty italian dressing.

Was all gone in a couple hours!  I did not have black-eyed peas so I used a can of red beans instead, also instead of Italian dressing I used Lemon Juice, pepper, a little olive oil and cilantro. I left out the extra salt, since canned beans have plenty.  Healthy delicious salsa!

This recipe didn't get a 5 star rating for being "okay". I was a little worried about the Italian dressing, it just didn't make sense on paper. This is AMAZING salsa. I would say you could cut the dressing in half b/c it does tend to get a little soupy. I only used about 5 rings of jalapenos. Best when refrigerated for about 6-8 hours. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I served this at my appetizer party and of all of the appetizers, this was the most raved about, by everyone.  I used fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, reduced the dressing, and added fresh cilantro.  The cilantro was the best ingredient.  I am having another get together this weekend, and this is on the top of my list.

Thanks for the recipe Susan!  I made this as instructed and it turned out wonderful.  After it sat for a couple of days in the fridge it was incredible.  I definitely would make it at least 24 hours in advance and 48 if you can.  I also added cilantro the second time I made it and loved the addition, but the recipe is great as is!

I am not a huge fan of green pepper, so I considered leaving it out.  However, I did make this recipe as written and it tastes great!  I used a "light" Italian dressing.

I am not a bean eater at all...but this is AMAZING! I love this dip. Next time I will use less dressing because the beans seemed to be swimming in it after sitting overnight. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, you have made a bean eater out of me. Great Success!!! **UPDATE** Although I just reviewed this 2 days ago, I must say I have been obsessed with this recipe. Since this makes a lot, I used the last of the leftovers last night in a "mexican pizza". I added left over chicken to the  bean salsa and heated it just a bit. I then layered it between layers of tortillas and cheese and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Topped with sour cream and it was delicious. I'll say it again...I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Excellent.  I used green onions, and I took about 1/2 cup of the mixture and blended it with the italian dressing.  It made kind of a creamy dressing.

This salsa is the bomb!  I followed the suggestions of using fresh tomatoes versus canned, clove of garlic instead of garlic salt, and a squeeze of fresh lemon, olive oil and balsamic vinegar versus italian dressing.  I have made this twice and both times it disappeared by the next day when it sat overnight.  My brother even makes toasted sandwiches with just the salsa!  Great on a baked potatoe or cooked chicken breast too.  One other thing I want to mention that perhaps may be helpful to someone is use vacuum packed corn versus a can of corn you have to drain, it is the equivalent to a 15 ounce can and the corn is not soggy!

This was awesome! Made for a party and was asked for the recipe several times.  I made a few changes, just for my own taste preferences.  I think this recipe really lends itself to letting you play around with it.  I used only about half the onion called for (just not a big onion fan), used red pepper instead of green, and added some avacado and lime.  If you like avacado, I really recommend it.  It adds a nice flavor and a different texture.  I used homemade italian dressing (Italian Dressing Mix recipe on this site).  Delicious!

This is one of my all time favorites, although I prefer the name "Cowboy Salsa" or "Cowboy Caviar". I used Muir Glen canned roasted tomatoes and red onion and frozen corn (I like the texture better than canned corn). I doubled the recipe and made half without jalapenos for a party. Took a lot home, but that is okay with me! This is great and healthy if eaten in a salad or a wrap instead of tortilla chips. Really needs to be created way ahead of time (overnight) and served at room temperature for best flavor.  Edited to add: This recipe makes the best quesadillas!! I slathered a whole wheat tortilla with black bean refried beans; a layer of this recipe; some chopped, pickled, jarred jalapenos; and a layer of shredded cheddar. Top with another tortilla and dry-fried both sides in a non-stick pan to crisp and heat the tortillas. NUM NUM. One of the best suppers I ever had.

It was good the way it was written, but as one reviewer suggested, it was spectacular with the addition of 1/4 c. red wine vinegar and 1/4 c. rice vinegar.  Will keep this one ready when having company over!

Good recipe. I'd suggest adding as many jalepenos as suits your personal taste buds-- I probably doubled them when I made this; I used fresh and canned jalepenos. The heat is initially noticeable but continues to grow nice and steady. Preferred eating it with Hint of Jalepeno (Tostitos brand, I think) scoop chips and we tried several; I would definitely suggest a STURDY chip as this dip is chunky/heavy. Keeps for several days and this recipe makes A LOT of dip. If you're not a fan of black eyed peas-- shouldn't be a problem-- they're not noticeable (agreed by my non-pea eating husband). Based on reviews, I omitted Italian dressing completely.

This is a great recipe!  I took advice from previous reviews and substituted frozen sweet corn, green onions, 2 cloves minced garlic and added 1/2 tsp each of chili powder and cumin.

For simplicity, this was a good recipe, but the italian dressing in NO way goes with a salsa.  This should be omitted and fresh tomatoes should be cut up for juice and cilantro added like many others stated.  Tasty but not exactly with a normal salsa taste; oil and italian seasonings detract from it.

People at work loved this.  Instead of Italian dressing I add a clove of minced garlic, the juice of one lime and a handful of cilantro, chopped - doesn't need all the added fat you get when you add oil contained in Italian dressing.

Brought to a BBQ and had plenty left which leads me to believe that it wasn't a favorite.  However, I had no mango salsa left!

This recipe is fantastic and can take on many flavors depending on how you "tweak it"  
For example, I omit the black-eyed peas and use Garbonzo beans, Chick Peas OR Golden Hominy.  I use real garlic vs garlic salt and I also sub yellow and red peppers vs green. Be careful adding too much Italian dressing, it can ovewhelm.  Otherwise, experiment and have fun!

This is a great easy recipe!  Next time I will add more jalapeno's though - we like it really spicey!

*Made it a second time - used one can of black beans and one can of blackeyed peas.  Used frozen corn and Zesty Italian dressing.  Left out the green peppers.  Added a dash of cayenne and cubed avocado right before serving - PERFECT!!!!

I have made this for a few years now.  I cut down the Italian dressing to 1/2 cup, and add a few dashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce.  When I have fresh veggies, I use those instead.  Sometimes I even use a can of tomatoes w/ green chiles, and its equally as good this way.

I did what others recommended and added cilantro. I also added lemon powder as it wasn't tart enough for me and I used fresh tomatoes. It was delicious and I got a lot of recipe requests for it.

Everyone raved about this when I served it at a party (I don't eat this kind of stuff, picky).  I am going to make it again for a dinner tomorrow since it has become a requested dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I accidently bought canned tomatoes that had basil and oregano added, but everyone loved it.  oh, I forgot, I only added half of the salad dressing becasue it looked like plenty.  A real keeper!!

This is great! I only give it four stars because when I make it again, I will make a few changes. I suggest partially draining the black-eyed peas and using only a half a cup of the Italian dressing, unless you like a very wet salsa.

Very yummy, took it to work and it was devoured! Everyone loved it and asked for recipe. I did use a can of white corn and half can of yellow corn. Cant wait to make again. Did use real garlic and would use another jalapeno next time.

We were not wow-ed by this recipe.  I wanted to love it, but I guess it's just personal taste, not the recipe. 
UPDATE-02/05/08-I added regular store bought salsa to it and yummy,yum,yum!

I tried this because of the 5 stars and the high number of reviews. I am in total agreement with the high ratings. I did replace the Italian dressing with olice oil and lime juice and added CUMIN. It needs to "sit" for at least a day, and Scoops hold the beans nicely!!!! GREAT

WOW!  I could not believe how great this was.  I made a huge batch for an opening night gala and it is a good thing I did, because the kids and hubby got to it, and ate half of it! It is good right away, but better the next day.  I added fresh grape tomatoes, and cilantro. Will make again and again!

This was great! I was a lil' leery, but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try  since it was so easy to make! I used past review suggestions and used olive oil, cilantro, fresh tomatoes, fresh jalepeno's, and added lots of garlic. It was great! Oh, and def tastes better if you let it sit in the fridge over night.

This was awesome!  Was one of those that people just couldn't stop eating!!  But I found another use for the recipe!  I had made two batches.  One batch I added everything except the tomatoes (I too sub'd lime juice for the dressing) and froze it for another time.  Well one day I was making seven layer dip and realized I didn't have refried beans.  So I defrosted that batch I had frozen earlier and used it instead!  Was fabulous!  A nice change in flavour and texture!  Now I'm wondering what other recipes that call for refried beans I could sub with this recipe!

This salsa is to-die-for!  I agree with the others that you need to let it sit at least overnight.  I used the leftovers as a topper of grilled chicken breasts which was great too.

I highly recommend making this recipe AT LEAST two days ahead.  It is sooo much better that way!  I used just a little Italian dressing, fresh tomato, cilantro and lime juice.  I also added chunky garlic pepper sauce for some extra kick.  Lime chips are perfect w/ this.  The people at work loved it.

This recipe is wonderful!  It never fails!  I cannot even count the number of times that I have given this recipe out.  I follow the original pretty closely...I like the petite diced tomatoes better than the regular ones.
If you cannot find diced jalapenos, just get sliced or whole ones and dice them up.  I've tried using diced chilies in the past and it doesn't have the same flavor.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This is really good! I made this based on the many reviews and I couldn't stop eating it. The colour is fabulous! However, I did change a few things too. I omitted the Italian dressing, instead used 2 T. olive oil (heated 1 minute in the microwave with 2 minced cloves of garlic), added 1/4 cup fresh lime juice. Also added 1 tsp cumin and a small handful of chopped fresh cilantro. I would definitely recommend using fresh roma tomatoes(about 6)instead of canned, and fresh jalapenos(I used 2, add more for more heat)1 can of (black)beans is enough too, as one reviewer said. This makes a good 6 cups.  I also ate it the same day I made it, just sat for 2 hours and it still was good.

After reading the reviews I was expecting something fabulous...and this delivered!  I substituted petite cut diced tomatoes with chilies rather than using the jalapenos.  (Personal preference)  I also added some chopped cilantro which gave it a fresh taste.  Other than that, I followed this exactly.  When I make this next time, I will probably experiment with cutting down on the amount of dressing.   This was still a fantastic salsa, but the dressing began to overpower the other flavors the second day.  Even so, this was a great recipe and everyone who tried it at the party I made it for complimented the salsa.

I made this for a picnic this past weekend - everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.  I used only about 1/2 the amount of Italian dressing.

Excellent!  I added about 1/4 cup chopped cilantro and made the Italian Dressing Mix recipe.  Next time, I will try adding chopped cucumbers.

I've been making this for a couple years now and my family loves it!  Whenever we take it for potlucks, everyone always wants to know how to make it.  I do make it a little different though and turns out excellent.  I don't use the black-eyed peas or garlic salt.  I like to add chopped red bell pepper, a can of hominy (drained), chopped cilantro and minced garlic.  I add fresh ground salt & pepper and some lime juice.  Also, I don't use a whole cup of Italian dressing (maybe a half cup), but I don't drain the tomatoes either.  Love this recipe and will continue to make it for years to come!

Even though I don't like this type of cuisine, I make this often.  I know it is great because I have been asked for this recipe time after time.  The last few times I made this, I added one or two teaspoons of chili powder.  It seems to give it a little added flavor.

1/7/12 update.  Tried this again.  Actually loved it. Used grape tomatoes instead of canned and frozen corn, yellow,white blend.  Healthy, beautiful, yummy.
Upgraded rating from 3 to 5 stars


I thought this was very good and really pretty, but it just did not go over well at the party I took it to.  I didn't get any comments on it at all.  Also, it makes a huge portion, that is hard to cut down given the size of the cans of the ingredients.

Wonderful!!  Left out the jalapeno peppers, canned tomatoes and dressing. Added lots of fresh cilantro and juice from two limes and two fresh tomatoes.  Can't wait for my family to try tonight.  So yummy with fresh chips...  Use corn tortillas, quarter them, and fry in oil.

This salsa was really easy to make and it was really good.  The only negative was that this recipe makes such a big batch that you need to make sure you have enough chips on hand- two bags at least!

Absolutely Fantastic!!! The only thing I substituted was Ceasar dressing instead of the Italian and it was still wonderful. I received so many compliments on this and it was so easy to put together.

This was very good and popular. I doubled the recipe and it makes so much but expect that the leftovers will be good for several days. For the party I made this, Fruit Salsa, tortilla rollups and Easy Chocolate Crackle Cookies and it was a great combination and easy to prepare ahead.

This is good but I did tweak it a bit to my own tastes. Firstly, I think the recipe calls for WAY too much Italian dressing, I only used maybe a fourth to a third of a cup. Secondly, I left out the corn and black beans. I have never had this with corn or black beans in it and don't want to! Thirdly, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned because it gives it a really fresh flavor. I just put it out with tortilla chips and everyone dove in! I like it is so much better this way, it suits my Texas Girl tastes!

Very good, very easy recipe. I get lots of mileage out of this as I use it as a salsa, then a bean salad the next day, and even as a topping for mexican pizza.

We had a lot of company coming and going this past week and I made this recipe as one of our appetizers.  Everyone loved this recipe - five people asked for it! My aunt just called me for the recipe and is making it for her familty reunion. Great recipe! Tastes best if you let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least a day.

Delicious and easy to make - I substituted 3 fresh jalapenos and 2 serrano chilis in place of the canned and eased up on the Italian Dressing (~1/2 a cup). It was very well received at a UFC party I went to. I even saved some for lunch as a side to grilled chicken and pork skewers, and afternoon snacks. Can stand on its' own as a "bean salad". For that, I took off one star as many people mistook it for a bean salad instead of a salsa / dip. The next time I make this, I will probably use another can of diced tomatoes to even the ratio out.

Loved it!! Everyone wanted the recipe. Have eaten it for brekfast, lunch, snack and dinner.  A friend suggested adding cucumber and red pepper. Wonderful!!  I also threw in celery.  Why not!!  I will try it with cilantro and fresh garlic next time.

This is an easy slam dunk!  I am a salsa snob and was a bit leery about the italian salad dressing aspect, but it was a big hit.  Made it for myself and three grown men and we all pigged out.  The only thing I did different was add cilantro.  Quick and easy!

Wow, this recipe is extremely easy to make, and is not time consuming at all! I used about a bottle of low-fat Italian salad dressing to cut down on fat, and added garlic pepper (about a tbsp.) for added flavor. I also used red bell pepper instead of green, as I prefer the taste. This appetizer is perfect for a barbecue!!!

Absolutely wonderful, have made it three times already and everyone wants the recipe. I never add onions because I don't like them and it still is awesome. Also last time I had a lot of extra garbanzo beans instead of black-eyed peas and it was delicious too.

We loved this one. This is better than the cowboy caviar. I did make a change on the diced tomatoes. I used rotel tomatoes with cilantro& lime, fresh jalapeno peppers, omited the bell pepper & celery salt. We will make this again. Yum

The black-eyed peas I used had been 'seasoned' and that flavor was a bit distracting.  I would omit them anyway b/c I don't think they look very appealing.  Cilantro would give this an extra kick.

This is delicious and VERY addictive...even better the next day if there is any leftover!  I used fresh jalapenos and left the seeds in for added heat. I served this with tortilla chips but have had a similar version in Alabama that was served with saltines.  Definately a winner and keeper!

Best salsa EVER. Just spicy enough-- I used jarred jalepenos and put them in the food processor. Also, used a Balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I make.

Holy Moly this was good!  I changed a couple of things.  I added cilantro, which I think is a must for the recipe.  I also skipped the garlic salt and opted for fresh garlic. I will definitely be making this again.

Two years ago, I catered an event for my husbands work which was about 150 people. Everyone raved about this one as the best dish on the buffet. Two months earlier, I catered a retreat and one woman just loved this dip. It is definitely a winner. I make it for all my parties and get togethers. Recently we had a recipie exchange and this one was on my top ten. I think it is the Italian dressing, such a different ingredient.

This was wonderful - did not change a thing.  You could add any type of canned, flavored tomatos (garlic and onion etc.) I also used my submersible hand blender to help thicken a bit.  My picky 13 year old daughter loved the flavor, even if she did pick out the beans!

This salsa is awesome! Just the way I like i: spicy and fresh! And healthy! I didn't add any salad dressing, because the salsa was already quite watery. I did add some lime juice and cilantro. Perfect! Thanks for the excellent recipe!!!

Yum - this won first place in our salsa contest! Following some other reviewers, I used red beans rather than black-eyed peas, fresh tomatoes, chopped cilantro, and a pinch of cumin.  I only used half the can jalapenos, but would use the whole can next time plus some fresh lime juice.

I made this for a get-together I hosted and I couldn't have gotten more raves on this. I thought it made a lot but it was eaten in no time and much to my husband's dismay we had no leftovers.  I will make this again, and again and again! Like many others I used black beans only.

Wonderful combination of colors and flavors.  Took the advice of previous reviews and only used 1/2C of dressing and 2 fresh chopped jalapeno peppers.  Dressing was fine, but still had to add cumin and cayenne pepper to get some kick.  Next time will try peppers with more zip than jalapeno.

I just made this for New Years in lieu of a pot of peas, and we liked it a lot.  Two notes from me:  1) be advised that it makes a pretty big yield, so choose it for big crowds, and 2) I agree with other reviewers, it didn't have quite enough heat for this Texas girl.  I minced two big fresh jalapenos instead of using canned, but now I realize this dish just has a LOT of starch to soak up the fire.  Like others, I also cut the salad dressing by half; just serve it with a slotted spoon (and "Scoop" Fritos) and it will be fine.

I brought this to our Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit with kids and the adults.  I think the genius ingredient of this recipe is the italian dressing - not something that you normally think of adding to salsa, but boy does it make it good.  Lot's of good improvising possibilities with this, too.  I'll be making this from memory many times to come!

Sooo good! I made a couple substitutions/additions. Used only black beans, added fresh mango (delicious!), red & green onion, cumin, red pepper and about 1/2 cup of the Italian dressing. A keeper!

Loved it!!  I served it for a party and couldn't get people out of the kitchen b/c of it. I omitted the green pepper & black-eyed peas.  Also I just used oil and vinegar. Fresh cilantro and garlic make a big difference too.  Definately let it sit overnight. So good!

I made this for a party this weekend and it was a huge hit.  Everybody wanted the recipe and one guest stood by the bowl most of the evening. I adjusted by using only black beans, diced tomatoes with chilis and green onions instead of regular.  Next time I'm going to try using fat-free dressing and see how it affects the flavor. I think another can of tomatos would be good also. I served it with the "lime" doritos. Addicting.

This recipe was wonderful! I took this recipe to a party where everyone was asked to bring an appetizer and there was nothing else like it. A nice change from Spinach dips and Tomato Salsa dips. Quite the rave!  I took some people's advice from the reviews and added cumin and cilantro!  Wouldn't have tasted the same without it!

I have to admit...I was turned off by the picture and the thought of BEANS!!  But I am pleased to tell you this is the BEST salsa I have ever tasted.  It was made with fat-free Italian but you would never know it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is SOOOO GOOD!!!  I didn't have any black-eyed peas or jalapenos on hand, so I substituted pinto beans for the peas, and then added a couple dashes each ground cayenne pepper, and chipotle pepper.  Since I'm trying to watch salt and fat intake, I used garlic powder instead of the salt, and used fat free Zesty Italian salad dressing.  This is truly addictive!!!

Great recipe.  Very easy.  I did make a couple of changes.  I omitted the canned peppers and added 4 large jalapenos, chopped.  Sounds like a lot, but it wasn't very spicy.  Next time I might add 5 instead.  I also minced a clove of fresh garlic and added a little salt, omitting the garlic salt.  I left it in the fridge for a day and a half to marinate, stirring it a couple of times.  Delicious!

This stuff is absolutely addictive! I replaced the green peppers with red ones and used canned tomatoes with jalapenos already in them for an added kick. Also, the cilantro (at least a little) is a must! Thanks, Susan!

LOVE THIS ONE!!!  Used fresh jalapenos and tomatoes instead of canned and added avocado.  It was excellent.  We couldn't leave it in the fridge for 24 hours to blend--we couldn't stop eating it!!!

I've made this twice with great comments both times.  While I love it with the jalapenos and added cilantro, it went over very well without them. It's a nice accompaniment to enchiladas or tacos.

This recipe is wonderful!  I used fresh ingred., except for beans and corn.  Also used quarter bunch chopped cilantro and several cloves finely chopped garlic.  Didn't have time to overnite it, but was excellent with many requests for the recipe.  Thank you, Susan!

This salsa was a hit with my co-workers.  They all liked the interesting combination of ingredients and the "kick" of this salsa.  I added fresh garlic and large bunch of fresh cilantro.  I also added some of the juice from the jalepenos and used Zesty Italian Dressing.  I served with a side bowl of sour cream and it was a great combo and helped cut the heat for the light of heart.

A good dip, but it has to be chilled for several hours or overnight; don't try to skip that last step, or it just doesn't taste as good.  I added a little lime juice, cilantro and cumin.

Holy cow, yum! I added fresh jalepenos. This was very well-received by all who indulged. A quality Italian dressing is a must!
Definitely better after sitting a night, so I suggest making it the day before.

Go to favorite. I substitute 4 fresh Roma tomatoes, add fresh cilantro, a squeeze of lime and omit the jalapeños because we are sissies. Leftovers make a great topping for grilled chicken and pork.

I made this for my son and daughter in laws farm open house.  They are vegetarians.   The smell and color of this dish is just gorgeous and the taste if wonderful.  I used Good Seasons Italian dressing because the bottle dressings are too strong.  Great dip.

This was good.  However, when I added Fajita seasoning, red peppers flakes and jalapeno peppers it was great.

Right after I made it (the exact recipe), I took a few bites just to make sure it wasn't poisonous. It was so delicious I could have eaten it with a ladle or one of those little gardening shovels. About an hour later I realized I forgot the jalapenos...yikes! Grabbed the bowl from the fridge, added the jalapenos, tested it again. Oh, wow, even better! And yes, it gets even tastier the next day. I've made it since then using about half the dressing (light) and a little cumin. I'm very happy with those tweaks but believe me, it's amazing just as written. Fresh, satisfying, and very diet friendly if you don't eat the entire bowl at once.

Makes a large amount. I added the cilantro, 1 tsp fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and 1/2tsp cumin, but I'm thinking more would be better. I used 1 fresh jalapeno minced instesd of canned and 1/2 C italian dressing. Excellent the next day. Great idea by the reviewer who said to put it over chicken breasts in the crock pot! Served over rice and mmmmmmmm!

Yum! I used lime juice and cilantro as suggested because it is healthier than Italian dressing but also because it was what I had. It was a total hit!!!

Liked it, but found it better using 1 cup oil & white or cider vinegar mixed with taco seasoning (used about 2 tsp for our taste).

I started making this for an office Christmas party a couple of years ago.   It always goes over really great.  I serve it with "Scoops" totilla chips, so people can scoop it out of the container easily.  Many actually eat it without the chips, as a side dish.  I've also brought it to picnics and have used it as an ingredient in a wrap.  It's delicious and very versitile!

I would rate this a 4.5 only because I'm not a fan of Italian dressing or bell peppers. My husband, who loves both, really liked this as did a lot of the guests at the baby shower I took it to. I doubled the recipe and had plenty of left overs and people were taking big cup fulls home with them. 
Because I don't like Italian dressing, I made the following changes:
1/4 c Italian dressing
1/4 c olive oil
Little lemon juice
Little lime juice
2 sprigs of cilantro
Plus I used real tomatoes as I didn't think canned tomatoes would be as good as fresh.

I used 2 cans of corn and 1 can of black beans.  I used chiles instead of jalapenos because I was afraid that some would not like the heat.  Delicious!

I found this recipe while looking for a good bean based salsa for a baby shower. This was easy to make and it turned out both delicious AND beautiful. I will be making this whenever I need an awesome bean salsa. Highly recommend! And it tastes great days later as well.

I use 2-3 cans of rotel instead of tomoeos and jalapenos (The rotel has green chilies instead and is easier for the group since some people don't like spicy food). I have been making this for a couple of years and every party I RSVP to I get asked to bring it.

SoOoOoOoO good!! I took this to work for a graduation carry in and it was all gone. I didn't add the black-eyed peas and didn't have green pepper but used mexi-corn. YUMMY. I thought the italian salad dressing sounded sooo weird but it was so good you couldn't even tell it was italian dressing in it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this exactly as written for a large group of family & friends this weekend.  It was soooo good.  Even those that don't like jalapenos loved it. and I was asked several times for copies of the recipe.  I have a little left and will add that to salad greens and chicken for tonight's dinner.

Everyone loved this!  It's a great standard cowboy caviar and very easy.  I only used 1/2 cup of Italian dressing and it was delicious, and not too liquidy.  All in all, a crowd pleaser :)  Thanks for sharing :)

My friends devoured this salsa after a night of drinking. I got so many complements. They make me seem like I'm some kind of master chef even though it's the easiest thing to make. I would use just a half a cup of Italian dressing next time.

I loved it. I did make some changes. Not because they needed to be made. I just went with my gut I guess. I used 1/4 of a cup of fresh lemon juice and 3/4 cup of italian dressing. I also used a red bell pepper instead of green and a yellow onion. Regardless, I am very pleased with the result, as I am sure you will be, however u make it.

This was really great.  Instead of using the tomatoes, I put in a can of Original Rotel.  (You can find it with the other canned tomatoes)  I still added a few canned jalapenos because we like it a little spicy.  My husband told me I can make this for him anytime and he's very picky with his food.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this late afternoon today. Absolutely delicious with Scoops! Made a few changes: Chose not to use italian salad dressing and garlic salt, instead used 1 tsp. lime juice, 3/4 tsp. salt, 3/4 tsp. garlic powder, 2 cloves minced garlic, and one fresh chopped jalapeno (seeds & membranes removed). Used white corn. Also couldn't find black eyed peas in a can so I subbed pintos. YUMMY!!!

Its true, this is highly addictive! I decided to make this for our superbowl party because i had most of the ingredients lying around already.  The only thing i didn't have was jalapeno's so for some heat i added cayenne. I also added in some chopped red bell pepper, used green onions, frozen super sweet white corn instead of canned, and fresh chopped roma tomatoes. I only added about 1/2c dressing and added lime juice and cumin like others suggested. I couldn't stop eating it even before i had a chance to let it sit in the fridge. A keeper! will be making it again soon!

The recipe that I have, which is similar to this one, calls for 1 Packet Good Seasons Italian Dressing Mix, 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/8 cup vinegar. It also calls for 2 tomatoes chopped rather than canned.   It comes out delicious!

I've made this dip a dozen times all to rave reviews! My only tweak, use "hot" diced jalapenos and Good Seasons Zesty Italian (with a little less oil). Makes a lot, good with tortilla or frito scoops. Thanks Susan!

The recipe is pretty good, but the italian dressing ruins it.  I put half the amount called for and it was too oily.  It was more like a salad than a salsa, so i had to rinse the dressing off in the colander.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that using more fresh ingredients would be better.  I made it exactly as stated, and it had a little bit of a "canned" taste.  Still tasty, but will try it with fresh tomatoes, pepper and garlic next time.

This salsa is excellent.  I used fresh tomatoes, frozen corn, fresh jalapeno, just because I prefer fresh ingredients, although, it is awesome as is.  I have brought this to several potlucks and I get so many requests for the recipe.  I hate to admit how easy it is to make.

This was a great salsa for a holiday appetizer. It was tasty and healthy. It took some convincing to get my daughter to try it, but once she did, she loved it. I made minor changes. I used frozen corn, thawed, fresh tomatoes and skipped the jalapeno peppers. I used a homemade Italian Dressing. Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe!!!

I am giving 4 stars just because I made a few changes.  I used 1 can each of black-eyed peas, black beans, and hominy, 1 pkg. frozen super sweet corn (slightly thawed), 2 avocados (chopped), 2 tomatoes (chopped), 3-4 cloves fresh garlic (minced), about 1/4 c. cilantro, and 3-4 green onions (chopped, including tops). I tossed all of this with fresh lime juice (about 2 limes), some kosher salt to taste, and about 3 tablespoons of veg. oil. So addictive!

This salsa was a hit.  I served it with some flax seed multigrain chips (which are great because they are a thicker chip and can handle the weight of the salsa).  I did modify it slightly.  I omitted the italian dressing and instead used fresh lime, salt/pepper, cilantro, garlic, and jalapenos for flavor.

I read the reviews and took note when preparing this. I used low-sodium canned corn and black beans, and fresh jalepino instead of the canned version to save on the added sodium. I also used fresh cilantro (about a handfull) and fresh plum tomatoes (3). I sprinkled a fair amount of chili powder, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, white pepper and cumin, and slightly less italian dressing than a full cup with a dash of salt at the end. It was perfect, my husband even said so :) I am definitely saving this one!

I thought it was great!  I've made it twice now and everyone who has tasted it loved it.  I love all the flavors mixed together, the last time I made it I chopped up one half cup of fresh yellow squash and added to the mix, it was great.

I used frozen sweet corn; added a garlic clove; used green onion in place of regular onion; with no Italian dressing, I researched and substituted 1/4 C Olive Oil, 1/4 C white wine vinegar, slightly less than 1/4 C sugar... next time I'm gonna add fresh cilantro

Great salsa.  I brought some to work and everybody wanted the recipe!  I did add about 2/3 cup of cilantro...might add more next time.  I might also add a squeeze of fresh lime and maybe some of the zest.  This is a winner!!!!!!!

This was great! It's not spicy or hot but has excellent flavor. The only thing I didn't put in was the green peppers. This will definitely be a new party staple of mine.

This salsa is great and easy to make. I had it while at a friend's house and decided to try the recipe myself. I did give my personal touch by adding to recipe: 1 tbsp of Frank's sauce, chopped cilantro,2 tbsp picante ready salsa.

This is always a hit - neighborhood party, soccer tournaments, whatever.  Super easy, and gets better as the flavors blend in the fridge.  Make sure to rinse the canned beans for best flavor and appearance.  You can make this even quicker if your supermarket has pre-cut onions, peppers, and tomatoes.  I like this best with fresh rather than canned tomatoes).  I used Wishbone Fat Free Italian Dressing, and addedd chopped cilantro.  Yum!

This is awesome stuff.  I could eat it everyday until its' gone!  To cut calories, I used less salad dressing, (used fat free italian, and probably only half what is called for in the recipe) and I also added a handful of chopped cilantro to really make the salsa POP. Oh, and a squeeze of lime and a splash of   red wine vinegar.  Delicious and healthy!

This recipe is fabulous!!!  I highly recommend it.  I love to serve it at parties with chips and then I use the leftovers on a bed a lettuce as a salad topping.  Awesome!  The only changes that I make are that I use frozen corn instead of the canned, fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt and I add some fresh tomatoes as well.

This salsa is fabulous.  After reading many of the reviews, I made the following changes.  I used 2 Roma tomatoes vice the canned, I used chopped garlic vice garlic salt, frozen corn vice canned, and added fresh cilantro. There were six of us eating it and we ate the whole batch.  This will definitely go into my recipe box for future gatherings.  YUM......

This is fan-freaking-tastic!  I did make a lot of substitutions based on my pantry, but I think the basic essence was maintained. Used pinto beans instead of black-eyed-peas, green chiles instead of jalapenos, Newman's Tuscan Italian dressing, SteamFresh frozen corn (microwaved first, duh), didn't have green pepper, and voila!  A healthy treat which will be served on top of Zesty Chicken Meatloaf (check it out).

Added fresh minced garlic rather than garlic salt, 1 fresh jalapeno instead of canned, added tomatoes flavored with basil, oregano & garlic, and added a lot of cilantro. Gets rave reviews every time.

I made this for the football game last night and everyone liked it. I got a lot of compliments and a few people even asked me for the recipie. I am giving this 5 stars even though I made some changes because im sure it is good as written. I just used 1/2 the amount of liquid and subbed lemon/lime for 1/2 of that. I also used texicorn and fresh peppers because that is what I had on hand.

We loved this simple to make yet oh-so-yummy salsa! 

The changes I made(due mostly to what I had on hand) were minced garlic instead of garlic salt, using 2 cans Rotel, half the amount of Italian dressing and adding some fresh squeezed lime juice. 

Will be making this often!

This was very good. I took it to a family gathering over Christmas. I did some things differently. I used mexican canned tomatoes, added corn (tex-mix) already had bell peppers in can.  Also added some fresh cilantro. Added minced garlic. Everyone raved about how good it was. Thanks. for a great recipe. !!

YUMM-O!!!!!!  I just made this and it is heavenly!  The flavors haven't even "melded" yet!!  My kids are going to love it so I'm going to have to keep them out of it because I am taking it to a party!  I liked how inexpensive it is for how much it makes!  And it is very pretty, what with all the colors of the ingredients. I accidently bought italian diced tomatoes but I just rinsed them.  I was worried about using them but they are fine!!

I thought this was just average.  It was fine, just didn't wow anyone.  I didn't like the Italian dressing personally; would have rather used some fresh garlic, cilantro, olive oil and lime juice.  I think that would draw out the flavors more than mask them.   It was pretty to look at but bland to my palette.

Thank you, Susan.  And "Ditto" to those
who gave this 5 stars.  This is a souped
up version of Georgia caviar (also on 
this site).
Being a member of the "Some Like It Hot"
club the only thing I ever change is to
use serrano peppers or, when I'm feeling
bulletproof, habaneros.
Nothing I can add to almost 700 rave
reviews.  Just wanted to join the choir
and to say "Thanks".

This is a VERY good recipe. I've added and taked awayfrom it to fit whomevers taste...but the basic recipe with the italian dressing and garlic salt is sooo yummy. My favorite offshoot consists of
black beans
garbanzo beans
corn
tomatoes
cilantro
onion
frest jalapenos
dressing
garlic salt
and cumin!!

I followed the recipe in the rating section that didn't have Italian cheese... but lemon juice, salt, pepper and cilantro.  Absolutely fabulous.  I think I may always keep some of this in the fridge for those days I want a snack.

WOW!!!! This is the best salsa I have had in years! The texture is great, fresh cilantro smells awesome. I made it for a party of about 40 people and they all raved about it. I did get one or two people that asked me next time to not put in the green peppers, they were just to crunchy. Also one more thing that I might add if you are making this I would let a little of your juice in there from your tomatoes to make it a little more runny! By far the best salsa!

This is really yummy and simple to make.  I just used what I had on hand...can black beans, frozen corn, can fire roasted green chiles, can whole tomatoes (which I chopped up), fresh avocado, fresh minced onion, kosher salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, white wine vinegar, olive oil...tossed it all together.  It tastes really fresh (even though there are canned ingredients) and looks very colorful and appealing.  I was eating this straight with a spoon, but I can see myself eating it with scrambled egg whites, on chicken, on fish, or as a dip.

I used fresh tomatoes, and jalapeno. No Italian dressing, just a little olive oil, fresh garlic and lemon juice as someone suggested. Left them in the fridge for a day. Warmed up a tortilla, put just a little hummus on it and a bunch of this and Oh my goodness!!!!! Even the pickiest kid wanted one in their lunch. Fantastic

This is a refreshing and tasty recipe!  I don't use the black-eyed peas, just use another can of black beans.  Serve with tortilla chips, makes a good appetizer or snack!

did I not write anything?oh well, hate this lap top always moves my curser.. anyway.. best BEST salsa ever! I only use 1/2 cup dressing and generous amount of oil. lots of fresh tomatoes. fresh cilantro. lime, lemon and fresh garlic. Cumin. sometimes chilpotle. makes a huge batch. with left overs you can wrap in tortilla with cheese and sour cream. lighly toast in non-stick frying pan to heat.  cheese melts and wraps around bean salsa mixture.

I tried this a new recipe for my party last weekend and it got rave reviews. I only gave it 4 stars cause I thought it was too spicy. So next time I will add less jalepenos. I served with Frito Lay Scoopes and it was all gone. I printed out copies of the recipe for some of my family who raved over the salsa.

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  Let me say this: my friend made a full recipe exactly as written.  Between he, I, and my husband, we ate virtually 90 percent of it that night!  I came home and ate more at 11PM!  You must let it sit overnight, but when it's done, be ready with some tortilla chips or Fritos Scoops.  You are going to love this one.

Absolutely amazing!  I followed other's advice and didn't use the italian dressing (I used EVOO, lime juice and some spices to create a better marinade).  Great recipe!

I will never buy salsa in the store again. OK, thats not entirely true, but for any event where I'm having people over and we need salsa - this is that salsa. I followed the recipe exactly and it was spectacular.

I took this to a party and it was gone before we left!  Didn't have the black eyed peas so used red beans and I only added about 1/4 C italian dressing.  Added the juice of a lime and some olive oil and fresh cilantro.  People ate it as a salsa and some ate it as a salad.  Great recipe!

This was easy to make and good, but lacking in flavor. Definitely needs fresh ingredients and not canned, as in tomatoes. So I made MY version by adding cumin powder, a pinch of sea salt, fresh tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, red onions, yellow, orange and red peppers, squeeze of fresh lime juice and diced avocado. Was WAY better this way.  When I first made it without my tweaking, my husband (who eats anything) gave it a thumbs down. So I remade it using the fresh ingredients and a few changes and he gave a BIG thumbs up!

This is simply delicious! I have even had compliments from people who don't like beans! It's so easy to make and it tastes even better the next day.  I too add cilantro and lime juice. I leave out the jalepenos when making this for my husbands family since they don't like spice, and it's still wonderful.

This was beautiful looking and addicting.  Unfortunately, I took it to an in-law function where they are very "meat and potato", plain food consumers and no one but my husband went near it.

So yummy!  I followed a couple things from other reviews and did not use the italian dressing and use, cilantro, lemon, EVOO, garlic, salt & pepper.  I also used fresh tomatoes, jalepenos and frozen corn.  So good! thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I took the advice of a couple different people and used fresh tomatoes. I served this as a salad, instead of a dip.

This recipe is sooo good.  I did make a few changes.  I added 1 can of black beans, 1 can of pinto beans (drained and rinsed), 1 can diced tomatoes with jalapenos (did not drain), 2 cloves garlic, 1-2 T fresh cilantro, corn, 4 scallions, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes for some more heat.  It turned out to be a great, fat free recipe.  Even my picky 13 yr old ate it up!!  Great snack!!  Will definately make this again!!

Very very tasty.  I changed it around a bit though.  In lieu of the Italian Dressing, mixed it with EVOO, Juice from the Jaleponos, Lime Juice, Cumin, Salt and Pepper.  I also left out the black eyed peas and doubled the black beans.  Also added chopped garlic, crushed red pepper flakes and the next day chopped avacado.  Wish it were a little spicer but will definately keep this recipe and work on the heat factor!

This recipe is a huge hit at our tailgates! I use canned items that have no-salt-added in them, it makes for a bit healthier recipe.  I also use Light Done Right Zesty Italian dressing by Kraft.  As well as garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  The ingredients alone provide enough flavor!

This is the most requested dip for any gathering. Be careful with the garlic salt because the dressing has plenty. Also the addition of cilantro is a must. Serve with tortilla chips.

This was pretty good. It seemed healthier, too. Better after a couple of days and very filling. Add the juice of one lime and lots of cilantro of course.

I onl give it 4 of 5 stars because I made changes. I'm not a big fan of Italian dressing, so I used 6 tbsp. each of olive oil and lime juice, mixed with some chopped cilantro instead of the dressing. I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic, added 3 chopped tomatoes, a splash of red wine vinegar, and used diced tomatoes with chilis. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cumin, and it is PERFECT!! I will never again buy store salsa.

I thought this was Excellent.  We made this in our 4H group and the kids loved it.  The parents that were there thought it was great right away.  Even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing.

I was weary of this at first because of all of the different ingredients. I was afraid that I might not like it, and that my fiance and 3 year old might not touch it. I was sooo wrong! This is the best light, refreshing, and filling dish! The three of us ate the entire bowl in a few days. What's even better is that it only gets better as it sits in the fridge. I did not use italian dressing, instead used olive oil to incorporate the ingredients. This is a fantastic dish.

While reviewing another recipe I realized that I use this salsa in soooooo many of the Southwestern and Mexican dishes I make that I better let folks know that if you try this recipe, your shopping list will always include the ingredients to make it. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST TRY for anyone who enjoys Mexican food! PS. Try adding some cilantro too.

Took the advice of the reviewed comments and substituted the dressing with lemon juice,olive oil,salt,pepper and garlic. I couldn't find black eyed peas so I just omitted them and left everything else the same. I happened to make this just to try for my family. That same day I was going to a party my sister phoned and asked if I had any salsa on hand, I said it just so happens I do, but it needs to rest for 8 hrs.  Well we had it and it was great already, I'm sure time will make it even more delicious. I'll be making this for the Super Bowl.

Oh my gosh!!! This is our favorite summertime snack food.  We serve by the pool for all our parties!  Everyone love it.  There's never any left at the end.  Sometimes we make it just for us so that we can get a taste.  I've been asked for the recipe several times. (I always lead them back her to you Susan).  Thank you Susan for sharing this one.  It's a keeper!!

Wonderful recipe!  I use fresh tomatoes and jalepenos in mine, it gives it a much better taste.  Also, this is great for those two party weekends.  It makes a ton, I always have some leftover.  So on busy weekends, I will divide it and take it to two houses.

Made this with Rotel tomatoes and fresh
jalapenos. Lots of fresh lime juice (4), fresh cilantro, cumin, and only a splash of Italian dressing.   Everybody loved it.

I think this is delicious... except for the Italian dressing.  I thought it added a weird flavor.  I took another reviewer's advice and added 1-2 heaping spoonfuls of cumin and that fixed the problem. Now when I make, I only use a little dressing and always add cumin.  Also good when substituting lime juice, as others have suggested.  This always goes quickly at a party!

This was awesome!  I did substitute fresh jalapeno for canned and used a bit more petite diced tomatoes. I did also use freshly made Good Seasons zesty italian dressing. Everyone at work wanted the recipe! I will make this often!

This really makes a lot, so great for parties. Great flavor!

Good basic recipe.  I lowered the dressing to 3/4 cup and still thought it over powered the dip.  Had to add fresh chopped cilantro to offset it.

I love this recipe.  I left out the italian dressing and added the cilantro and lime juice.  I also add multiple colors of bell peppers for a different look and taste.  I also found that it tastes best after left sitting in the fridge for a few hours so all of the juices combine.

Loved this. Used 6 romas, 3 fresh jalapenos, and added some fresh parsley and 2 cloves garlic. Served with lime flavored tostidos, as suggested by another reviewer.

This was great!  I got many requests for this recipe.  My only changes were using fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, pigeon peas instead of black-eyed peas (couldn't find black-eyed peas), a few more jalapeno peppers, using only a couple tablespoons of dressing, and adding lime juice and cilantro.  Delicious!

I can't count the number of times that I have made this...it's delicious!  The only thing I do differently is use diced green chilies rather than the jalapenos...too hot for me!  I always choose a robust Italian dressing without any cheeses in it.  My friend asked me for the recipe when her teenage son asked her to get the recipe from me.  What a compliment!

This is wonderfully addictive! I made it about a month ago for a graduation party and have made it at least 6 more times since then! Each time I make it to share (it's hard to do with this recipe)more people ask for the recipe. 

It is perfect the way it is, but easy to adjust to your taste and what you have available in the pantry! It is very forgiving of changes. 

This is one for your recipe box!

I served this salsa as a bean salad for  dinner with some friends and it was a hit. I don't like kraft Italien dressing so I made the recipe with fresh ingredients just like Lucy7 had advised and it turned out great! I will make it again.

Great recipe that I've been making for a while with lots of requests for this recipe.  I use frozen corn and I have added anything fresh from the garden and it turns out great everytime.  This keeps well for a few days.

Outstanding! The only thing I added was a heaping teaspoon of cumin... other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. This one's REALLY good! I took it to a party and it was a huge success!
Serve with tortilla chips or your favorite crackers; you won't be disappointed!

My husband and I love this salsa. Instead of using Italian salad dressing, I used lemon juice, salt&pepper and cumin. I also added cilantro as I nad it on hand. It is full of flavour. Perfect for lazy summer lunch.

I'm not really fond of bean salsas, however, I HAD to try this because of the ratings & reviews.  I made it for Memorial Day and it was a hit!!  What I changed in this recipe is: 3/4 Cup Italian, 2 Fresh Limes, 1/2 Bunch of cilantro, 2 Jalapenos, and fresh garlic.  This is a great appetizer and I plan in making it for a 4th of July BBQ.

I followed the directions exactly but I though the Italian dressing overpowered the other ingredients and overall, too many beans. It should be better with all fresh ingredients, lemon or lime juice, parsley or cilantro, and just using one type of bean, black or black-eyed beans.

One word - DELICIOUS!  Everyone loves it, and I wish I'd found it sooner because a very similar recipe won a cooking contest at work (but I personally like this one better).
This one's a keeper!

Easy, Easy EASY!   Mostly opening cans and dump - with a little chopping.  Best part is its BETTER to prepare ahead to get the flavours to meld.  I had jalapenos with a LOT of kick, so this was really spicy, but still tasted great. It's even pretty healthy.  Beward this does make A LOT and I dont think it's one that can be frozen for later.

This is so yummy!  I like to use rotel tomatoes and fresh jalapenos.  I also add some cumin and use the Zesty Italian dressing made from a packet.

Very pretty. Good recipe. I agree with others than Cilantro would be just the right kick. Also, we like things a little hotter and so I added some Cajun seasonings to the Italian Dressing prior to mixing.

Love, love, love this!  Easy to make - everyone who has had this loves it.  I did make a little change to make it hotter tasting since my husband and I like spicy foods.  Instead of green pepper I added a can of Rotel Extra Hot Diced Tomatoes and Chile Peppers drained and also added extra onion.  I keep this on hand - great topping for salads also!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was pretty good.  Not so much with just chips, but piled on taquitos was very good.  I added fresh garlic and cilantro, used Rotel diced tomatoes w/ green chiles and omitted the jalapeno due to the Rotel.  Should have added the jalapeno, but I like it hot. :)  Also added some seasoned salt.  Took it to the office and it was a hit.  Very colorful, might add some chopped green onions next time.  I used Zesty Pesto Dressing(kroger) which is what I had open and added maybe half a cup.  Next time will use just plain Italian.  This would be good with refried beans, nachos, quesadillas, taquitos, or fajitas.  I will make again!  :)  Oh, and it's VERY VERY easy and quick to make.

This was EXCELLENT!  I was literally the salsa by the spoonfuls...it was so good.  I think I will drain the tomatoes next time (which I didn't do this time)to make it a little less watery.  Also, I may use a fresh jalapeno pepper.  Cilantro would have been perfect in this but I didn't have any on hand.  I will definitely make it again and will share this recipe with family and friends!  Thanks!

OUTSTANDING!!! This was very very good.  I added 1 fresh jalepeno and more cilantro to give it a little kick.  My husband and son loved it and they are not to fond of black beans.  Am now keeping black beans in the cabinet to make on a regular basis.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Quick, easy and delicious.  I made a few alterations; used fresh Serrano peppers & fresh garlic, added lime juice & cilantro, omitted salad dreshing.  Next time I'll use fresh tomatoes and more hot peppers.  
This would also be good on nachos or in quesadillas with chicken.

This was great-I followed others advice and added cilantro to the mix. I used an orange pepper instead of green and it looked like I mixed carrots in, so don't do that. My children that don't eat beans gobbled this up on tortilla chips. Will make often in the future-Thanks for a great recipe.

As written - 4 stars, modified - 5.  Used fresh tomatoes, garlic and jalapeno, less dressing, then added cilantro and juiced half a lime.  Gave half a spin in the processor to thicken up a bit, and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Perfect!

Everyone LOVES this.  I don't even buy salsa anymore.  I try to keep some in the refrigerator at all times but it is hard.  A healthier snack alternative to potato chips and fattening dips or cookies.

FANTASTIC!  We took this to a family picnic a week ago and it was devoured.  Even the children loved it.  Since then, I've made it 4 times.  We can't get enough of it.  Thanks Rachael!

I've made this several times and am always asked for the recipe.  To make a milder version, try adding green chiles instead of the jalapeno peppers.

Excellent Dip. I added chopped avacado & minced onion. I also served with guacamole flavored potatoe chips.This recipe makes a lot of dip but the flavor is even more delicious the next day. Everybody loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This salsa is fantastic. I had to modify the ingredients a bit or what I had at hand. I used 8 med tomatoes instead of canned, used 3/4 cup of salad dressing, and used pinto and garbanzo beans instead of black eyed peas and black beans, and added a bit more jalapeños! Very tasty!!! I don't think I'll buy salsa again!

Wonderful! I did make a few changes though.  Roma tomatoes, fresh cilantro, minced garlic, fresh lime juice, and 1/2 cup FF zesty italian dressing.  I served this with white corn tortilla chips, beef enchiladas, and key lime bars, YUM!

I make this with a can of Rotel instead of the tomatoes, add drained sliced olives and use green onions instead of regular onion.  I also use fat free zesty italian dressing.  My family likes this as a side dish as well as a dip. Even my extremely picky son is addicted to this!

I made this for a New Year's Day party so we could all eat our black-eyed peas for health?, wealth?.  Anyway, this stuff is addicting.  I could not stop eating it.  10 stars from me, and maybe my family will stay healthy and get wealthy this year!

This recipe was a hit at our labor day BBQ. Omitted black eyed peas,2 cans black beans, cut the dressing in half, added juice of a few lemons, lots of cilantro,a whole onion, and doubled the jalpenos. Thanks!!

I brought this to a BBQ without testing it...everyone loved it! Served the next day and day after and continued to get raves and requests for recipe. I modified by using fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and added about a 1/2 cut of fresh chopped cilantro, used an orange bell pepper since that's all I had...it made the color variety in this dish even more appetizing.  A keeper in this house.

AWESOME! My husband could not stop eating it! Neither could I. (Okay, we confess, we ate some before it sat overnight too, it is a lot better the next day). I used fresh tomatoes, but other then that I followed the recipe pretty much exact. Oh, I used minced garlic from a jar too and not garlic salt/powder. I also couldn't find a small can/jar of jalapenos so I just used about 1/2 of the jar I bought (my husband probably would have preferred I use it all, he likes things hot!). Anyway, I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!!!

This is such an easy recipe and one that is very yummy!! I've made two batches of it just last week. The first one was to try the recipe out, but went through that in just a few days! Made a batch for a cook out we went to and my friend ended up keeping what was left! I didn't add the black eyed peas or the green pepper, but everything else was really yummy! Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious salad, I even eat it as a salad!  I usually make the beans instead of using canned, and also chop up fresh tomatoes.  I also use less of the salad dressing and add the juice of one lime

Fantastic.  This recipe has a few things going for it:  it really couldn't be easier (the only thing you actually have to chop is an onion, I left out the green pepper), it's different (I'm kinda getting tired of the old chips and salsa), it only gets better the longer it sits in the refrigerator, and it is DELICIOUS!!!  Everyone who had some the last time I made it raved.  This will be my standard summer dip now.  Thanks Susan!

My husband makes this and it is excellent.  We omit the tomatoes and use fresh, chopped jalapenos instead of the canned ones.  The canned ones tend to add too much spice as it sits.

I made this last week for a barbecue and it was well received.  I changed the recipe somewhat by eliminating the can of black-eyed peas (didn't have), adding 1 1/4 cups frozen corn instead of canned, 2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned, 1 10 oz. can of Rotel with chilies and one diced fresh tomato, 1/2 cup of the Italian dressing and red onion instead of white.  I made it the night before the barbecue and it was fine the next day.  However, I had leftover salsa a few days later and it was really delicious!  The flavors had really come together.  I added this salsa to the inside of quesadillas and it was phenomenal!

This has now become my most requested dish!! It has wonderful flavor and texture. I tweeked mine a bit by only using fresh ingredients and adding a few items. I add red, yellow, orange, and green pepper....this provides great color. I, also, use fresh roma tomatoes. For those who are daring, add a few habenaro peppers in it for a much added kick or stick with the trusted jalepeno. The last thing I add is fresh, chopped cilantro. Mix it all up with the remaining ingredients and you have a very colorful and tasty dish.

What a great dish!!!! Took to two parties and the crowds gobbled it up. So easy to make.  I used fresh garlic and fresh cilantro and put in the fridge overnight.  It was wonderful. This is a keeper for sure.

I made this with black beans only, fresh tomatoes, and added fresh lime squeeze,fresh cilantro and fresh jalepenos.  I only added one jalepeno,and it wasn't enough spice.  Next time I'll add two or more.

Outstanding!  I served it for a barbeque and it was the hit of the party.  Three children (ages 7-12) attacked it with spoons, and the adults thought it was a fantastic hamburger topping as well.  I can't wait to make it again.

A very different dip!  I was worried about serving it to a bunch of Methodists, LOL, but they gobbled it right up!  Was also good as a side with chicken tacos the next night.

I didn't taste this because I don't like most of the ingredients, but everyone else really loved it.  I tripled the jalapeno measurements, due to taste standards.  Make a night or two ahead of time and mix occasionally to help marinate evenly.

I made some changes:  left out the jalapeno (my family doesn't like spicy) and tomatoes (forgot to put them) and added slice olives.  This was yummy and so simple.

Simply the best.  I took this to a family potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.  Next time I will cut the dressing to 1/2-3/4 cup.  Much easier to dip without so much liquid.

THE best salsa recipe -- bar none!  For a little extra 'kick', use zesty Italian dressing.  If you making this for a party, make sure you print off LOTS of copies of the recipe -- you'll need them!

This is great salsa, I roasted the peppers and frozen corn for added flavor. I also added some cumin. I also just love Rotel chilies and tomatoes. They are just great in here. Enjoy

We loved this recipe. Very easy to make and will impress your guests.  Next time I'm going to add an additional jalapeno pepper for a little extra "kick".  I've made this recipe several times and it stores well in the refrigerator.  Get's a little hotter each day.

Yum!  I was a little skeptical at first, even when I was making it.  But it turned out great and everyone at the party was going back for seconds and thirds and fourths....  This is definitely a keeper and a refreshing change from regular salsa.

This is got to be one of the best!! I took the advise of some of the other reviews and added fresh garlic (instead of g. salt), cilantro (totally makes the recipe)and used fresh diced tomatos (intstead of canned). What a delightful surprise! I've made this for 3 diff. occasions and I'm always asked for the recipe and to make this my "regular" dish. You won't be disappointed.

What a great salsa!  I've never tried anything like this before and made it for my Bunco group that meets once a month.  Everyone loved it.  However, I only added half the jalapenos and it was still hot, but not too hot...just right.  I also like the fact that I can make it a day ahead.  I also took the advice of some other reviewers and added cilantro and garlic.  Yum!

Wonderful recipe! I used as an appetizer for a group of friends and everyone loved it. I also added the cilantro and lime juice as others suggested. I will definitely be making it again, in fact I've already had requests for both the recipe and another batch.

So delicious! I made this without the dressing and in a mason jar, I put the juice of 2 lemons, a couple glugs of olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper. Shook that up and poured it over the mixture then mixed in a couple handfuls of cilantro. YUMMMMM!!!

I have been making this recipe for years. Now that I'm on WW (Weight Watchers) I only use half the dressing and still very delicious and it's only 1 point! My whole family enjoys this addition to the meal!

We made this for our Independence Day celebration and it was wonderful as a salsa and a salad.  I made a couple of adjustments after reading other comments.  I used frozen sweet corn, 2 fresh jalapeños and fresh grape tomatoes, halved, instead of canned.  I also used green onions with a little bit of red onion for the onion component.  Chopped cilantro was a fresh addition.  Everyone enjoyed the fresh flavors of this salsa/salad.

I made this dish for a pot luck brunch here at the Colorado campground my husband and I are staying at this summer.  I always like to make something that we will enjoy eating afterwards if I end up with a lot of leftovers.  There was not much leftover!  I always read the reviews for other suggestions and since I am not a fan of italian dressing.  I opted instead to add the juice of one lime and about a 1/4 cup of olive oil, in lieu of the italian dressing.  I used all the ingredients as mentioned in the original recipe with the addition of cilantro.  It was perfect for my taste.  Thanks Allrecipes!

This is by far one of our favorite dip recipes! It’s also good just to eat as a side, or on salads. I add a little salt and pepper, as well as some chili powder to mine, and we love it.

I didn’t use black eyed peas because I don’t care for them, so I added chopped green bell pepper instead. It was a huge hit. Loved it!

I made this for my daughter's 21st birthday party. We're vegetarian but many of her friends are vegan. I hate to be the one with the changes but when I got home, I realized I didn't have Italian dressing.  I also used frozen corn and a fresh jalapeno.  For the dressing, I mixed canola oil, two limes (the juice), and some seasonings and fresh garlic. I also put in a bunch of fresh cilantro.  Everyone loved it and said the phrase "this is addicting.". My daughter wants me to keep a batch in the refrigerator for lunches, etc. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

This stuff is delicious! I doubled this recipe because I was making it for a church supper,  and used 1 can kidney and 1 can black beans for more color. I also used frozen sweet corn, a purple onion, a fresh jalapeno and omitted the tomatoes. I only used 8 oz dressing tho.

I was looking for my cowboy caviar recipe, but could not find it. Found this and it was similar. I omitted the green pepper and added avocado. My version had powdered Italian dressing packet and olive oil. I like this one with prepared Italian dressing better.

This is a great bean salsa recipe.  I highly recommend it.  I adjust the heat for my family by adjusting or removing the jalapenos.  Mild chilis with the diced tomatoes works out real nice if you just want a dash of spice in there.

Great recipe.   Based on some of the other reviews I substituted frozen sweet corn, cut fresh grape tomatoes and added enough dressing to coat the vegetables.   Tostitos Scoops are perfect for this salsa.  Enjoy!

A great twist on a former recipe I used which is very similar.  Do yourself a favor though, and nix the caned goods and replace with fresh.  Also a little cilantro adds a nice side note.

Used Magi sweet chili sauce in place of Italian dressing. I've tasted it made with Tiger Sauce too. I imagine Captain Rodney's Pepper sauce would be good too. Serve with tortilla chips

THIS IS SO GOOD! Only thing I did different was add a clove of minced garlic. Still added the garlic salt though (I'm a garlic fanatic). Making this over and over until I'm sick of it haha!

Great salsa. Upped the jalapeno a little, didn't measure out the garlic salt, just added it to taste. Served with blue sesame tortilla chips.

This was tasty! I make something similar to this but with salsa in place of the dressing. The dressing was actually a nice change and we enjoyed that. I did use the dressing to taste, as I did not want it to be too much. I served this as a side to our taco dinner and the family liked it. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Italian dressing? I just used fresh lime juice, cilantro, fresh tomatoes with the rest of the ingredients. Far better dish.

Cool and hearty at the same time.  Need to use  hearty tortilla chips as well.  It was a hit at our last bbq.

This recipe is a hit wherever I take it! I've been asked for the recipe many times. Update: Since I made my initial review I have continued to make this recipe more and more. I find that it is more than just a great dip. It is great with tacos and nachos. Also, it makes a great accompaniment to grilled chicken that was prepared in a Mexican-inspired marinade. The only modification I make - for me it does not need the entire 1 cup of salad dressing. I use about 2/3 cup.

I've been making this dish for years. It was originally called a "Cowboy Caviar" I believe someone's already mentioned it. This dish is very versatile. It can be used as a side dish or, a salsa. My husband loves it. it's a "must have" staple during the summertime in our household. Great with Bbq and perfect for a potluck dish. Enjoy!

I doubled recipe as I am taking it to a family gathering tonight. The only change I made was based on several reviews to cut the amount of dressing, so I used half the amount called for. I scooped out a bowl full to try before it even marinated and it is delicious. I can only expect it to be better tonight. I will definitely make this again.

Quickest, easiest appetizer around, and it's absolutely delicious. I first made it for a salsa competition and won first prize. Now I have to make it for every family gathering. It makes a huge amount, and since it's canned goods there is no real way to cut down the recipe, so be prepared to have leftovers for days!

I actually triple this salad and put it in canning jars.  I don't process them, but I bring it to parties for an appetizer.
Zesty Italian dressing, fresh garlic & cilantro..  I don't like peppers so I don't use them.  I season to taste with salt, pepper & cumin.  I have soaked the dry beans and it is still great.  Stay with the proportions or add more diced tomatoes.  I love Muir Glen brand but I have used others.  Enjoy.

Amazing!  I omitted green pepper and added LOTS of cilantro. We ate two full batches at the lake over the 4th of July with extended family. I served it with tortilla chips and Mexican beer. Yum!!

This recipe was not quite what I was expecting.  While it tasted okay, I felt like it was something meant to be served over salad and not served with chips.  Like a hearty salad dressing.  I probably would have enjoyed it more had I served it that way, but I served it alongside tacos.  It doesn't really taste like a Mexican dish.  Probably wont make again.

This salsa isn't "addicting!"  That isn't even a word!  It is very addictIVE, though!!!  I made it EXACTLY to the recipe.  Once even one thing is changed, it is no longer THIS recipe.  It does say to drain and rinse the black beans and drain the tomatoes, but nothing about the corn and jalapenos, which are also canned.  Considering how much Italian dressing goes into this, I went ahead and drained the corn and jalapenos also.  The salsa was excellent!

This recipe just amazes me.  I'm not a fan of half of the ingredients in it, and I fear raw onion.  And I was asked to make it for New Years one year, because it's supposed to be good luck.  I was kinda thinking "I hope other people bring good stuff cuz I'm not gonna eat this!"  Boy did I eat my words.  And my salsa.  Everyone raved so much I finally tried it.  And for about 8 years now, it is a New Years tradition for me, and I somehow made it my signature dish for NYE parties!!  Everyone in my family was kinda like me.... I don't eat raw onions, or black eyed peas, or corn in salsa... but I made them try it, and they ravished it.  Plus, it is SO simple to make!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!

Made this recipe for a friend with a few small tweaks. Used my dad's tomatoes from the garden and also added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp chili powder after reading other reviews. I used Ken's Red Wine and Olive Oil ofr the Italian-style dressing. We didn't think the salsa was too spicy, but I did think the jalapenos overpowered the other flavors a bit. While I did appreciate the taste of the blended flavors after the dish was marinated overnight, I would next time drain the remaining dressing from the salsa after about a day. It was swimming in liquid! My friends enjoyed this and so did I. definitely a keeper.

Awesome, delicious, and healthy!! And the recipe is very flexible depending on what you like, or have on hand.  I used Zesty Lime Vinaigrette for the Italian dressing. Great way to use up veggies!

This is the biggest hit at a party, and it's SO easy that you can whip it right up the night before in less than 10 minutes. I will say, I always have to double the recipe if I'm bringing this to a party.  I also add in a double recipe about an entire bunch of cilantro, 1-2 tbsps of lime juice and whenever possible, I juse fresh tomatoes and jalapeno peppers rather than canned.  Makes a world of difference and so much more refreshing for a summer dish!  Enjoy!

I changed this just a little - I added cumin and kept garlic salt out and I added fresh cilantro.  With those changes this is EXCELLENT!  Serve with tortilla chips! I made a double batch and it was the only thing gone.

This was very easy to prepare! I used sweet onions, fresh tomatoes, added cilantro, diced 3 garlic cloves and only used 1/2 cup dressing. It was very good the next day but I had to add 1/4c fresh lime juice as my personal preference... it really brightened up the flavors. Over-all, great recipe and it is addictive!!!

My daughter was the first one in our family to make this.  It is truly delicious!  When I make it, I like to use fresh jalapenos in addition to the canned.  I use minced garlic, not garlic salt.  I don't feel it needs more salt.  Unlike others, I do not add cilantro, because I don't care for it.  The next time I make it, I will try it with diced grape tomatoes instead of canned.

This deserves the rating.  It's great and easy to make.  Everyone loved it at the party.  Do not double as it makes plenty.  Planning on making it again!

I changed only the salad dressing to lemon juice, salt and pepper.  The men could not get enough of it and I embarrassed myself "shoveling" it in.  I would imagine the salad dressing would work well if not better - I just didn't have any on hand.

Awesome!  A local grocier that went out of business used to make a bean salsa and I've been in search of the recipe since...finally found it!  I only used 1/2 c of dressing and added red pepper and cilantro.  It was a hit!

This is a hit at all our family functions. It is so delicious you will have no leftovers. I give it 10 stars because I make it in double batches. Who thought a can opener could make such a masterpiece. Thank you Susan Navarrete!!!!!

This is so ridiculously simple and yet it's sooo good and a definite crowd pleaser.  I added some cilantro and lime juice per others suggestions but even if you didn't I'm sure it would be good.  Oh, one thing though, the 'spicy' part is inaccurate.  Not the tiniest bit spicy.  But still super tasty!

I used the red pepper italian by kraft. Everyone who tried this commented on how fresh and tasty it was. When I ran out of chips my boyfriend and I took some lettuce out and made wraps with them. :)Great snack.   I only used 1/2 cup of the dressing (maybe a tad bit more). You can add more later if need be but I really dont think its needed and I have made this many times

This recipe has become a family staples at our summer cottage and on our boat, it travels really well and everyone loves it - including the kids which the parents said "no way will *** eat that" we couldn't keep them out of the stuff. The only adjustment I make to the recipe is to decrease the amount of dressing, it seems a little soupy with the entire cup in there.

oh this was very tasty and easily changed based on ingredients you have on hand.  I've usually chopped up more jalapenos because I like it a little spicier than written.  Also good with chopped green or black olives and garbanzo beans.  I haven't used chopped onions, but instead chopped green onions.

Not that this needs another 5 star review, but here it is... I didn't have the green pepper on hand so I skipped it (but I'll use it next time).  I used the juice of a lime, 1 packet of good seasons dressing (mixed according to the packet directions), 1 tsp of taco seasoning, and about a 1/4 cup chopped cilantro (next time i'll use more).  Let it sit in the fridge for about 6 hours.  Super delish!  We ate so much we almost didn't eat dinner!

This was really, really good.  I served it for a super bowl party.  If I make it again I'll reduce the italian dressing by 1/4 cup (I used low fat & it was still good). I would also use petite diced tomatos if possible - smaller bites.

I brought this to a party and everyone loved it! I did make a few changes, i added 3 cloves of garlic, minced. I also used 2 cans of black beans and omitted the black-eyed peas. then, because i know all people don't like spicy dips i didn't use jalapeno but i put about a cup of red pepper in the mix instead. So good! I will make this again

Holy Heck!  Way too spicy for me.  I was a bit dumb when it came to the peppers.  Next time I will leave them out.  I will definitely keep the recipie because it is super healthy and great to throw on salads and veggie burgers.  I would have given 5 stars but my mouth is still burning.

SOOOO easy! I even used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes and jalapenos, and I used Garlic Expressions salad dressing because it's all I had. I also used pintos instead of black eyed peas. If you have the corn, onions and black beans with something tomatoe, you can't go wrong!!!

Wow!  Thank you for this recipe.  It is delicious, healthy and easy.  I will make this for many years to come.   With this and another recipe I found here, I don't think I'll buy another jar of salsa from the store again.

Sooooo good and very healthy...I added a little cilantro and red bell pepper and instead of jalapeno peppers I used pepperoncini's sliced up.  I also omited the black eyed peas because I didn't want it to be too beany, I just wanted a little taste of everything.  I also used Ken's Lite Itallian dressing to keep it healthy.  Everyone will love this, serve it w/ scoop Torstito's the baked version.

I have made this salsa before and everyone that tries it, loves it! Very healthy and you can spice it up to your pleasure with more or less jalapenos. Serves great with tortilla scoops.  Would definately recommend this as an appetizer for any party.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!It is EXCELLENT! Served over salad!  Instead of adding salad ingredients (tomoatoes, bell peppers, etc..) we added this instead.. Great way to change up a salad!  Next we want to try it as a topping on our chicken..yum!

My husband and I love this recipe.  The only change I made was using red wine vinegar dressing instead of zesty.  I've made it both ways and really enjoy the red wine vinegar flavor a lot better.  Making a day ahead really makes a difference.  And it does make A LOT which is great for a big party or summer picnic.

Nice easy recipe- Better if you can make it in advance and let the flavors mix in the fridge overnight.

Nice recipe, wasn't a big hit at the party. This could easily have been my fault in preparation. Not for everyone, but still tasty.

This dip turned out GREAT! We all filled up on this while waiting for the actual meal to be ready. I didn't add the bell pepper only because I was out and I added abit more diced jalapenos. I will definatly be making this one again

I just made this and its YUM! I did change it though Didn't use the peas used 2 cans of beans and fresh corn.  1 cup onion and bell pepper. 1 tsp garlic salt, cumin, chili powder.  About 2 cups cilantro.  I wish it were a little spicer though. I probably will had more jalapeno next time. I used 2 this time.  I can't wait for tomorrow, because everyone says its better after 24 hours.

I have made this many times and it's always a hit.  Instead of the Italian dressing I use fresh lime juice, a little oil oil, kosher salt, and cilantro.  I also use red onion and serrano peppers since they have more spice than jalapeno peppers.  Sticking to the recipe still turns out great though.  I'm making tomorrow for a work pot-luck and can't wait to eat it!  Make sure you make a day ahead.

Needs a little more spice but the Italian dressing is not a good flavor for this! Use fresh tomatoes and add cilantro.

YUMMY!!!! I did change a few things.I could not find any black eyed peas and I hate tomatoes so I skipped those. Also added some cumin, and some chili powder and cut the dressing in half. Incredibly addicting great recipe.

This stuff rocks!  However, I did make a few changes.  I did NOT use Italian dressing, I diced fresh tomatoes instead of using canned, and added a little bit of cilantro and lime.  This made for a much fresher salsa.  Everybody loved this stuff with chips!

Yummy!  I added 1 can of kidney beans and cumin.  I turned it into a chicken tortilla lime salad.  Served it under tortilla chips and then the salsa, added chicken pieces (sauteed chicken with some lime and cumin in it.)  Also added cheese, lettuce, and ranch, fresh limes.

I omitted the bell pepper both times because I just didn't have it. Ridiculously easy to make, most everything I already had. I used one jalapeno and I didn't think it was "spicy"-which is good for me because I don't care for spicy foods-but I thought the one jalapeno gave great flavor. Next time will try to add cilantro and lime, but great easy recipe!

UPDATE: My husband requests this ALL the time! We love it. My only addition is fresh cilantro and it is delicious!! It only ever gets to sit in the fridge for about an hour before one of us is sneaking a bite!

This is a keeper :)  Made a couple of alterations:  Used fresh jalapeno from my garden and just a small touch of fresh cut basil, seasoned black beans (Bush's makes these) and 3 Cheese Balsamic Dressing from Newman's Own and red onion and fresh made black-eyed peas.  I'm definitely going to try the sweet frozen corn idea, for sure!

I used fresh ingredients where possible instead of canned, like tomatoes, corn,garlic & peppers. It is a good basic bean salsa recipe except too bland for me. I added cilantro which helped a lot. I suspect that other spices like oregano or cumin might add just what it needs.

Wow, we loved it!! I followed the directions exactly and it came out delicious. It was a real treat on a very hot & humid day. My husband couldn't stop eating it, thank goodness we ran out of tortilla chips, we now have some for tomorrow and I have to run to the store for more chips. Thanks so much for sharing.

I make this for every event I attend!  it is always requested. I also add 1 avacado, and mexican tomato sauce, I call it duck sauce, it is in a green can with a yellow duck on it.  It can be found in the ethnic aisle at the grocery store.  I also cut strips of corn tortillas, spray with cooking spray, sprinkle with sea salt and bake.  Incredible!

I made as is and the only thing I will change is using less dressing, it was pretty oily/watery (it was still delicious and I just drained off some of the dressing, so I will still give it 5 stars). I think just enough dressing to coat would be plenty.

I can't count how many times I've made this Salsa.  My family & friends always ask me to make it & someone always asks for the recipe. Without fail my daughter request that I make it every time she comes home from College. I don't use the jalapeno peppers,I always use frozen corn - 2 cups or so, I usually use red pepper instead of green & add cilantro (if I have it!). The cilantro definitely changes the taste but great both ways. Just as good with low fat dressing. I've used other "white" beans when I don't have black eyed peas & it's fine but the small size of the "peas" is best (for me!)I especially like the recipe because I almost always have the ingredients on hand for unexpected company! Try it - you'll love it!

Great Taste.  For the dressing I used 1/2 cup Kraft Free Zesty Italian with 1/8 cup rice and red vinegar each. To give it a kick I added about 1 tsp cumin and dash of chili powder.  Also added 1/2 cup yellow and orange bell peppers and cilantro.  I used 1 chopped jalapeno and garlic clove.   I think I like the dressing from Mexican Bean Salad recipe on this site better.

I served this at a party and everyone from the 4 year old on loved it and couldn't get enough! I served it with plain or the jalapeno tortilla chips for an extra kick. I used thawed frozen corn instead of canned corn.

REFRESHING! I used white beans instead of blackeyed peas, the entire bell pepper, and a bag of frozen sweet corn. I also used spicy Italian dressing, but a lil less than called for and added some chopped jalapenos. Everyone loved it.

Definite 5 in my book!  The changes I made were; 1/4 c. fresh chopped cilantro, frozen white corn, frozen black eye peas,  I liked mine with more diced tomatoes so I added another can & I did use fresh chopped garlic clove. (I don't think it needs the extra salt because of the Italian dressing)  ...This is so easy and you can make it to your taste.
UPDATE 2/10/2011: I made this for our annual super bowl party-forgot to ck my notes here and followed the recipe exactly.  I prefer the frozen black eye peas & white corn.  Honestly not as good with canned veggies. (just my opinion)

EASY - EASY - EASY  I made this for the first time to bring to a "4th of July" barbecue --- I was the only person to bring an appetizer so I was hoping it would taste "okay" --- everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. This is so easy to make, tastes great and is good for you, too. I now have a dish that I can always bring to any event and know that it will receive raves.  I love this site ---- I am not a great cook and always afraid to try something for the first time ---- this is the fourth recipe I made and loved all of them.  It makes it so easy when you can read everyones reviews.

The mix of beans and vegetables were a great combination, but I didn't care much for the Italian dressing (Package mix-oil, vinegar, and water) that I used which was recommended by several reviewers.

This is awesome! I make once a week for my husband who loves this healthy snack. I have also made this dish for many parties which always results in at least one person asking me for the recipe. I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have forwarded the link to this recipe.   This is SUPER EASY and I wouldn't change a thing. I have changed the recipe a few times but never like it as much as the original. I do like to add red peppers to the mix and use 3 cloves of fresh garlic in lieu of the garlic salt.   Other than that, this recipe is probably one of my favorites on Allrecipes.com. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I used 2 fresh jalapeno's instead of canned. It was not spicy, but the flavor was excellent!

Super easy and super good!  Definitely has some "kick" which you could turn up or down a notch or two with the jalapenos.  Great for a crowd!

I made this recipe for a party and it was just average.  I tried to add some flavor with cumin and chili powder but it didn't help much.  Not a hit and I won't be making this again.

I loved this, as did my hubby and daughter.  HOWEVER, it was not a hit with the teens who attended the super bowl party at our house.  It IS versatile.  I served it heated with cheese over Fritos.  Again I added chicken fajita strips and heated.  Served with cheese, sour cream, and chips or tortillas.  It makes GOBS!

I use light Italian dressing to reduce calories, and it doesn't compromise on flavor.  Excellent, easy, and inexpensive bean salad.

Great recipe!  I needed to use up some hot peppers and fresh tomatoes, so I used the corn and beans as suggested, 2 tomatoes, 1 red pepper, 4 small hot peppers, and a can of pinto beans to counter the spiciness.  Added a dash of cayenne sauce, red pepper, and the garlic and onion salts, and it was fantastic!

So good.  I make this frequently. I normally use a squirt of Italian dressing, and also some olive oil with lime juice. Always use 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic, and lots of cumin and chili powder.  Sometimes I use it as a base for Mexican chicken dip (refried beans or mexican rice, then mixture of chicken [cooked in taco/fajita seasoning and shredded] and salsa, and a can of nacho cheese...top with sour cream, salsa and green onions.)

Man oh man we love this stuff.  It is perfect for gatherings.  It is healthy, so fresh and addictive!  I actually put the leftovers on eggs - yummy!  P.S.  serve this along side the LuvAnn's guacamole form this site and you have a huge crowd pleaser.

I made this last night for a party. What a hit! I only made a couple of adjustments. I increased the garlic salt to about a tsp. I also used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned. I added a bit of fresh cilantro as well. Very very good recipe. Thanks for sharing. I will definetely be making this one again!

Fantastic! I made it just like it is (minus the green bell peppers as no one in the house likes them). Everyone loves this recipe from my husband to my youngest child. I took it to a party last night and it went over well there too.

sooo good! I added some lettuce, peppers and grated cheddar cheese to make it more of a salad. You could also toss on some grilled chicken as well. (Almost tastes like Red Robin's Mesa Chicken Salad!)

Made this for a neighborhood block party and everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was cut down on the jalapenos added because I don't like things too spicy.  Will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  Instead of the Italian dressing I drizzled a little olive oil and vinegar over the top and sprinkled the salad with a dry Italian dressing mix.  I think it worked just fine.  It makes a very large batch, once I served with tortilla chips, used it as filling in a quesadilla another night and today had it on top of a spinach salad with a little hot sauce, sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips.  I love how versatile this is.

I love this salsa. I usually serve it as an appetizer when making tacos and taco salad for dinners and I must say by the time I serve dinner no one eats much after filling up on this salsa. Ive never had 1 complaint from anyone who has ever tried this, in fact It always gets rave reviews and many recipe requests! I dont change the recipe at all.

Love it, love it, love it! Made it as others suggested.  Used fresh garlic instead of powder.  Added cilantro, lemon juice and used jared jalapenos with some of the juice from the jar.  Used Good seasons italian dressing and dipped with Tostitos scoops.  Make sure you let it sit overnight!  I've made this many times and everyone loved it.

This was really good! I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and omitted the black beans and jalapeno peppers (I added some green chilies) I also skipped the dressing. I ate it with Roasted Garlic Triscuits. Yum! :)

Nice recipe but it wasn't amazing. Missing something. I followed the advice of several people and used some fresh lime juice and olive oil. Added cilantro and used Rotell tomatoes instead of plain.

I made this for my husband to take to work with him. They guys all looked at it and said that they would try it just because I made it. They don't really like bean salads or stuff like that. Well, one bite and they were hooked. I have to send the recipe to work with him now. The only thing I changed was that the store I went to didn't have the right peppers, so instead I added green chilies. A must for summer...

This salsa is great. I added 1 extra can of diced tomatoes. Be sure to use the unseasoned blackeyed peas and black beans to avoid conflicting flavors. I made my own Italian dressing using the Good Season packet but giving it a southwest twist by substituting lime juice for the water and added 2 teaspoons of cumin. I doubled the recipe so that after company leaves, we will  be able to enjoy some for ourselves for a few days...just gets better as it sits in fridge.

I have made this quite a few times now and I have made a couple of changes.  I don't do jalepenos.  I put in green chilies instead.  Also, fresh Cilantro is great.  Try using Ro-tel tomatoes instead of just plan tomatoes.  We like Frito Scoops with this dip

I also left out the Italian dressing.  I did not drain the dices tomatoes so that juice was plenty.  i also added cumin, minced garlic, and chili powder for a little spice.

This was amazing. My dad always wants our family to eat black eyed peas for new years so the rest of us have to find recipes to put them in that make them tastier. I'll certainly be getting my dose this year now that I found this recipe.

This one is a bunch quicker and easier to make.

This is very tasty. My small neighborhood market didn't have black eyed peas, so I used pinto beans instead. I also used canned corn and canned tomatoes b/c I didn't have much prep time. I am eager to see how this tastes with fresh summer veggies if the mostly canned version was as good as it was! (added cumin, garlic, cilantro as suggested -- cilantro really adds a fresh taste)

This is a fabulous "base" recipe, great for playing with and modifying. I added garbonzo beans, a pretty firm avacado, and made a dressing of olive oil, cumin, fresh garlic and lemon juice. I used all fresh ingredients, no canned tomatoes and certainly not the italian dressing.

I missed the spicy part. While my threshold for spice is certainly above average, the Italian-style dressing completely destroys all other flavors. this salsa doesn't do it for me.

Bachelor friendly though

This is awesome!  I gave it 4 stars because I made alterations.  I used the juice of one lime instead of italian dressing.  Also chopped up 2 jalapenos, added 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, and used the petite cut tomatoes.

I loved this recipe!!! I changed a few things based on the reviews and it was excellent! I used 3 cloves garlic,  and Ro-tel diced tomatoes with green chiles,  1/2 cup cilantro and lemon juice instead of the italian dressing. I left out the black eyed peas. Yummy!!!

This salsa was very tasty. I made for my family and they absolutely loved it. I followed the recipe for the most part. I used less dressing than the recipe called for. I also drained all of the ingredients and used petite tomatoes. This is addictive!!!

Like many others, I skipped the Italian dressing and used 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar. I also added dried cilantro since I had it on the shelf, 3 garlic cloves, salt and pepper, cumin and chili powder, plus two additional fresh tomatoes that needed to be used up. THEN the recipe was perfect!

This has to be the most favorite recipe I've found in ages!  My 18 month old loves it too, although for her benefit I leave out the jalapenos.  I use less dressing also as I found it too wet with the whole cup.

Delicious, especially a day or two after preparing the salsa. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly, omitting the jalapenos. I only had 1 can of black beans so I used a can of field peas and they worked great. I made Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing, using EVOO and used 1/2 cup per recipe rather than the full cup. It was just enough dressing-not too soupy. I will make this again.

Excellent salsa!  My girlfriend doesn't even like beans, but she thought it was delicious.  I chopped fresh tomatoes instead of using canned ones; fresh is always better.  I don't think that I could ever eat store bought salsa again.

I followed various suggestions and used fresh tomatoes, frozen sweet corn, and substituted the garlic salt and italian dressing with my own dressing:  3/4 C olive oil, 1/2 C lime juice, some cilantro, chili powder, and salt.  It was perfect!!! Can't wait to make this again.

Very tasty, I've been eating it right out of the bowl with a spoon! I definitely recommend marinating for at least a few hours in the fridge before serving. Initially it doesn't taste like much. I used fresh corn, jalepenos, cilantro, cucumbers, and grape heirloom tomatoes based on other reviewers comments. For the marinade, I also skipped the Italian dressing and made one using lime juice, white balsalmic vinegar, cumin, salt, pepper, minimal olive oil, and dash of chili powder.

This salsa is awesome! The most time consuming part is shopping for the ingredients. I omitted the canned tomatoes and used two fresh ones instead. I also omitted the Italian dressing. I substituted a clove of pressed garlic for the powder and threw in a handful of chopped cilantro. A great recipe!

So far I've made this dip twice. Once for a Memorial Day party and other to take on vacation. It was a hit! EVERYONE loved it and they were asking me for the recipe. It's so simple and easy. I went with adding about 1/4 cup of lime juice as suggested. Also, instead of black eyed peas, I used white beans. My friends and husband love spicy foods, so I added a few more jalapenos for that extra kick! AWESOME!

I followed the other reviews and used lime juice instead of italian dressing.  I also added salt and pepper.  Everyone loved it!  However, I also made a spicy version by adding cayanne pepper and green and red tabasco - it was great!  My husband absolutely loved it!

Love this one...healthy and tasty. I serve it with Lay's "scoops" so you can get more slasa on the chip.

Absolutely the best bean salsa I have ever had. I did add plenty of finely chopped fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice. I followed the recipe closely except for using fresh tomatoes and jalapenos instead of canned. I added minced fresh garlic too as well as garlic powder. I used half the Italian dressing as suggested but did use an aged balsamic dressing which had a rich flavor. I chopped the ingredients in the food processor doing each one seperately to get the right size pieces. The garlic was finely minced with the salad dressing. This enables the pieces to all get minced up without having to stop and scoop the sides of the processor over and over again. The flavors that pop in your mouth are incredible with this dish. I served it with the Shrimp Durango recipe on this site and it was an incredible meal.

My family was hesitant when they saw me opening cans and putting this on the table. But everyone now raves over the dish - including my uuber-picky brother-in-law, who wouldn't eat it at first. My sister now makes it for all of their get-togethers at his request. The amount of Italian dressing works as-is, but I actually started cutting the amount in half. I don't think you really need quite that much.

this is a delicious salsa!  I thought the Italian dressing was an odd ingredient, but tried it anyway and it turned out great!  I use Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with jalapenos just to save a step.  It can easily be toned down or kicked up a notch with the type of diced tomatoes you buy.  Thanks Susan, this is a keeper.

This was so great!  I had to alter it a bit.  I used fresh jalapenos, crushed garlic instead of garlic salt and made my own dressing.  I used olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper and cumin to keep with a mexican theme.  The only drawback to this is that it makes enough to serve an army.  I've had numerous variations to this and they are all pretty much the same until you give it your own touch.  This couldn't be easier to assemble and is a great alternative to regular salsa.

this salsa is GREAT!  It is extrememly addicting, and tastes great with blue corn tortilla chips.  Definitely add a couple of chopped avocados and fresh cilantro that made the salsa for me.

So good, yum. I'm pregnant and craving spicy foods, and this really hit the spot....healthy too. I used fresh jalepenos (with seeds since I like it hot) and added a tiny splash of balsamic vinegar. I'm an official addict and will make this again and again...thanks for sharing!

I followed the previous user's idea and substituted italian dressing with 3 key limes and a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Everyone LOVED this recipe. I highly recommend it...very easy and VERY good.

This was good but definitely add the chopped cilantro as it gives it a bit of a kick that's missing without it.

I love this recipe, although I did alter slightly.  I add a 1/2 c. fresh chopped parsley, substituted thinly sliced green onions for the onion and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I also omitted the black beans, just because I didn't have any on hand.  A delicious crowd pleaser!

AWESOME -- my only suggestion is to use about a 1/2 cup of italian dressing rather than a cup.  I also added some cilantro and used a red onion.

I made this recipe several days ago for a family get together, and it was devoured in minutes! Everyone loved the bit of "kick" it had, as well as the fact that it's healthy. It's quick, easy, looks great, and tastes even better.

Great Recipe!! I made this for a family BBQ and I got rave reviews! I used fresh tomatoes and jalopenos, and cut back on the Italian dressing to 1/2 cup. Went great with fajitas!Yum!! Will definitely make again!

This recipe was very good, very easy (mostly canned vegetables mixed together), and makes a lot of salsa.  This is perfect for parties.  I only gave it four stars because, even after all of the ingredients were added, it was still a little bland and not as spicy as I had hoped.  I added a little more garlic salt, about a tablespoon of fresh ground pepper, a tablespoon of cilantro, and a tablespoon of lime juice.  I also served it with lime tortilla chips.  Will definately make this again with these additions.  Thanks.

This is excellent! It's perfect for spring/summer partys.  It's very colorful, and the longer it sets, the better it gets.  I usually like it on the second and third day even better than the first!!!We will keep this recipe, thanks for sharing

I used green onions, three cloves of garlic, yellow and green peppers, fresh and canned tomatoes, and red pepper flakes.  We like it spicy and it definitely improved after a day or so in the refrigerator.  I liked it over lettuce!

Fantastic!  Everyone loved it and asked to take home some of the leftovers (this recipe really makes quite a  bit).  A fresh alternative to the "everyday" bottled salsa.

Made this salsa for the first time for an office party & it was a hit!  I chose this recipe based on the reviews. Several people were hesitant to try it, but those who did were pleasantly surprised.  Next time I'll try some of the variations, like the lime, cilantro, fresh garlic, etc.

I made this for 3 BBQs this past summer and now my mother-in-law is demanding it for Thanksgiving.  I use about 75% of the Italian Dressing, add some cilantro and if you can put it in the fridge overnight, it is that much better! Always a huge hit!

My husband and I love this salsa!  A great change of pace from that same old store bought salsa! I had some cilantro so I added it and I think next time I will cut back just a little on the dressing.  Thanks! I can't wait to make this again!

I made this recipe back in May and totally forgot to write a review.  This stuff was soooooo GOOD!  It made so much that I ended up taking leftovers into work and then ended up emailing everyone the recipe because they all loved it so much.  Now when we do pot lucks they only want me to bring this salsa!  One suggestion though... it is 10 times better if you let it sit for a day before serving it.  This allows all of the flavors to blend together and it's just delicious!

Excellent salsa. I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chilis and chopped green chilis instead of Jalapenos. I also added cumin, adobo season, cayanne pepper for kick and garlic with pepper. I just made it and love the flavor, can't wait to try it after it sits over night.

This is a nice change of pace from your typical salsa.  Made this for a birthday party and although half of the people seemed a little wary of this, the ones who tried the salsa really liked it. I added some lime juice, cilantro and cumin as suggested; and used Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing. The lime and the cilantro gave it that little extra zing that everyone seemed to enjoy.  Will try this again with a different crowd because I think a less finicky group will rave over this one.

This was good for a change. But it was not spicy at all even after a whole can of jalapenos was added. As someone else mentioned, it reminded me more of a bean salad than salsa. I think I will stick with the traditional tomato-based salsa.

This recipe was very well received, but it's definitely better several days after you make it.  I added some lime juice, cilantro, and cumin, too.  Look out, though, it makes a TON!

My family raves about this when I make it. I add some cumin, fresh cilantro and fresh chopped garlic (instead of garlic salt). Very easy to make. My husband can't keep his hands off it long enough to sit overnight...

My husband gave this a 5, however it didn't have enough zip for me. It wasn't spicy at all so i added a can of peppers on top of my three fresh peppers the next day, and some cumin. It gave it a little more zip. I will make again, but add about 4 peppers!

I like this receipe. I changed it into more of a bean salad, so that is why i rated a 4 instead of a 5 since I did not do this receipe as how it was intended. Instead of black eyed peas i used Garbonzo Beans, Kidney beans and Green beans. i still used the the black beans. i used red onion instead of white and i forgot the bell pepper. I added about 2 table spoons of fresh chopped cilantro because i had it on hand and i really like the flavour. Used all the rest of the ingredients that were listed on the receipe. My salad made a lot more then 4 cups and i did not use 1 cup of dressing. i think i maybe used half a cup of zesty italian dressing. I did not want an overly dressing flavour, i like the flavour of the vegtables to come through and my boyfriend is not fond of italion dressing. The amount i used was good because he likes it, though he does say it tastes healthy.

So easy to make and so good.  Nice and spicy - went over well at our picnic.   Used Frito scoops which were good but I bought low carb tortilla chips, cut into wedges, sprayed with Pam and baked at 450 until crip and then sprinkled with Kosher salt.  It was yummy!

I got great reviews at my block party with this!  They all asked for the recipe.  I added 1 chopped tomato and some fresh parsley.  I think I would use all fresh tomatoes next time.

This is the BEST recipe I have ever gotten from this site.  Totally outstanding.  I took it to a huge camping cook-out with lots of friends.  They had the whole thing gone in minutes.  I heard "You've been holding back on us!  Why haven't you made this before?"  I made it two days ahead of time and stirred it around every 7-8 hours.  I made it as noted, plus added a couple of fresh tomatoes, about a cup of fresh chopped cilantro, some cumin, 5 cloves of fresh garlic, and substituted red beans for the black-eyed peas.  I also drained most liquids before serving.  Oh my gosh....this is just divine.

Excellent summer munchie! I took this to the sandbar and everyone was hanging around our boat waiting for another bite. The salsa didn't last very long and I had to make a double batch the next week. I improved the mixture by using fresh diced tomato & 3 diced jalapeno peppers instead of canned. (Use 4 if you like it hot!)

I have made this several times, I love this recipe. I have made this two ways, the original way(only use 3/4 cup dressing). And then at the end I add 1/2 cup picante sauce,which my husband loves. Me I like it both ways. Great recipe to sit around the house and watch the race on Sundays.

I brought this in to work, and it was a big hit! Great with fritos scoops. This salsa got hotter the longer it sat, so letting the salsa sit overnight is really important.
This makes a LOT of salsa, more than 12 servings as an appetizer. About 6 people ate it as a meal, and I still had half left-over. I ate some warmed up in a tortilla, but it wasn't as good as with the fritos.

I really loved this recipe. Makes a great salsa. I used fresh ingredients and added lime and garlic. The suggestion of using 1/2 c. of dressing was well advised. I will make again. If you can get a hold of a brand of Mexican salt called Lucas Lime, I would suggest adding it, we just loved it!!!

My family can't get enough of this.  I used pinto beans instead of black, and skipped the corn.  Used lots of minced, fresh garlic, and fresh tomatoes, not canned.  I make a double batch, and its still not enough.  Yummy with corn chip "scoops".

This was a hit at my daughter's birthday party among the adults.  I only altered the recipe by substituting a can of diced tomatoes with chilies for the regular tomatoes and I added some chopped cilantro.  I had many requests for the recipe.  Served with corn chip scoops and was so good that I could have made a meal out of it!  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again.

This is delicious!  With less dressing, it makes a great side dish as well...I only used 3/4 c. of dressing.  I had to use 4 fresh jalapenos, but I might put in 1 or 2 more next time.

We really enjoyed this.  The only thing I did different was added roasted green chili peppers.  Several of the guests were eating this on warmed tortillas like a burrito.

The favors only get stronger as this sits longer. Be careful how spicy you make this because the next day it is only going to be hotter. Which in my house means better. This recipe is a winner.

Yum!  This was a hit.  I substituted a 4oz can of chopped chiles for the green bell pepper.  I let this marinate 24 hours and served with Fritos Scoops.  Next time I am going to try a lime juice based dressing to mix with it instead of Italian.

this was so good.  I took it to work & everyone loved it.  Several asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did different was used fresh Jalepeno and I added one can of blk bean to substitute the blk eye peas.  this is a keeper!

I used half the italian dressing and added a sprinkle of red pepper, cumin and black pepper. Works best with the "scoop" tortilla chips.

Yummy! Used fresh jalapenos and fresh tomatoes instead of the canned...makes a definate difference. Would have liked a little more heat....will add more next time....but this is a great salsa....served with tortilla chips and loved every bite!

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it for a single's group that I belong to and they loved it.
I liked it because it was easy - not a lot of chopping to do, and the end product was very tasty. I liked the fact that you make it ahead too. Thank you Susan :-)

What a big surprise!!!  I read the reviews, but really didn't think this could be THAT good.  I am the only one in the house that even likes black beans or black eyed peas.  I knew I would be the only one eating this.  My husband HATES black eyed peas.   But everyone loved this salsa.  I made this one for anyone who doesn't like spicy.  I was making a different salsa for the hot and spicy lovers.   The only change I made was using chopped green chillis instead of jalepenos because I really didn't want it spicy at all.  It was wonderfull.  I am making another batch today.

MMMM!  Very yummy.  I was sure my Hispanic hubby wouldn't like this with the canned jalapenos, but it was a definite hit!  I used two cans of diced tomatoes & chilis (Rotel) and it worked out perfect!

Extremely easy!!!  Very tasty, I used 10 oz. can of jalapenos for more spice, still didn't find it too spicy.  Might try adding more.  Guests liked it.

Very unusual and tasty change of pace salsa (no pun intended!)I added an entire "bunch" of cilantro, and if you like it hot, you may want to add some hot sauce. Great stuff!
