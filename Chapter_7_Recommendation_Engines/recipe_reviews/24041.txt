I worked this recipe into my Christmas baking day and it was so worth it!  Out of all the goodies I shared, this was everyone's favorite.  Here are the tips that helped make it the best and easiest: use parchment paper so that it comes out of the pan easier, put each layer into the freezer to harden so that it speeds up the wait time, present the candy in cupcake cups, and use butterscotch chips in only one of the layers--I put it only in the bottom layer because it has a very dominating flavor.  I substituted 1/4 C. choc. chips for the butterscotch in the top layer.  Remember that a 7 oz. jar of marshmallow cream = 1 1/2 C.  I warmed this in the microwave first so that it came out easier.  This isn't something you want to make when time or patience is limited, but I hope these tips make it a little easier!  Oh, have I mentioned that this is delicious?!

This fudge is delicious!  Just a few notes to help save time:  A 7 oz. jar of marshmallow creme is 1 1/2 cups, and I microwaved the carmel and cream in a microwave safe bowl with great results.  Just be sure to heat it on medium heat and stir frequently until melted and smooth.  I must agree that the carmel does ooze out of the rest of the layers-I'll try the mini muffin cups.  Also, I thought the top and bottom layers tasted too much like butterscotch-I'll omit the butterscotch chips next time and substitute additional milk choc. chips.

This was really good! It was difficult to cut, but other than that fantastic. I read about everyone's trouble with the caramel layer, so here is what I did: I melted the caramels in the microwave with 2 tbsps of milk, stirring every 30 seconds to one minute. (It only takes about 2-3 minutes to melt them) and then spread them on top of the nut layer. I have had no problems with the layers sliding apart or the caramel oozing. I hope this helps!

I have made these for years and they are good.  However, instead of using a one pan I use mini muffin cups and fill them individually with each layer.    Also, you will find the layers won't fall apart if you DON'T freeze them first. And since the cups are so little, the layers set up pretty quickly.

I've made this many times now, always make it at Christmas time.  It has one top prize at two different holiday parties now.  I dont use quite as much butterscotch as it calls for, I feel it overpowers it, and I always line the dish with parchment paper. (first time I didn't and it was a nightmare trying to get it off the dish)

I've been making this recipe for 3 yrs.  It's expected at Christmas now.  Although I did make some changes I use Peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch.  I used dove milk chocolate instead or milk chocolate chips, more expensive but seem creamier.  I use whole peanuts I don't chop mine.  This fudge needs to be kept cold it melts very quickly....

I loved it! I was expecting it to be a little difficult after reading some reviews but it was simple. The only changes I made was how I did my caramel. I make caramel in the crockpot, take how ever many cas of sweetend condensed milk you desire and put it in the crockpot(yes the unopened can) and then fill with water until it covers the cans.cover with lid. Cook on low for 10 hours.I make several cans at a time then stick them in my fridge until I am ready to use, best caramel.I had no problems with this caramel sliding off. It is thick. Anyways, I love this fudge, and it will be a part of my Christmas goodies now. Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful. Everyone wanted the recipe! I read the reviews and lined my pan with parchment paper, cut the squares and served them in paper cupcake liners. By accident I used semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate and it was great. (I like dark chocolate anyway.) I did use butterscotch chips in only one layer. Putting it in the freezer between layers made the process much faster. (Be aware that when you add another layer it will cool quickly on the frozen layer--be ready and work quickly.) I agree with a few people that it isn't exactly like a snickers, but who cares! Very good.

Tastes delicious, however prep time is inaccurate.  This takes quite awhile to prepare, mainly because the chill time for each layer.

This recipe was excellent!  I have to admit it was time consuming because you had to chill each layer, but it was SO worth it!

This recipe is fantastic!  It really does taste like Snickers.  Everyone that tried it wanted the recipe!  I followed this recipe exactly with one exception...I used only milk chocolate chips for the top and bottom layers.  I put it in the freezer to hasten the chill time and it was ready in under 2 hours!  Thanks so much!

Very good recipe.  I did omit the butterscotch chips completely and just used all milk cholcolate chips the second time I made this candy.  It was so much better.  The butterscotch chips just overpowers the other flavors.  I did not have any trouble with the carmel oozing out.  To speed up the prep time I put each layer in the freezer while making the next layer.  Worked great.  I also did the caramels and the chocolate chips in the microwave.

Yum! This fudge does take a little time and dirties quite a few dishes, but I think it's worth it. SO good. I did omit the butterscotch on the top layer and added 1/4 C. milk choc chips as others suggested. UPDATE: DO NOT substitute marshmallows for the marshmallow creme! I made a 2nd batch and did this as the store was out of the creme - and although it tastes just as good - the texture is dry and crumbly. :-(

Ok this is a two part review with the stars.

4 stars is because my co-workers are lapping this up and stating that I'm either wonderful of evil for bringing this in for them to devour.

2.5 stars is my personal rating. Because this isn't fudgy at all and is gooey, nothing but sweet, I don't taste the peanut butter, and my boyfriend just said "it sweet and you know from me that isn't a compliment" So I don't know maybe if I ever decide to make this again I'll use an actual peanut butter fudge recipe that is flavorful. 

I did have fun making it, and it is being enjoyed by a lot of people!

So decadent!  A friend had made this recipe but called it Snickers Fudge.  I knew I had to try it, it was so good!  It does taste very much like a Snickers candy bar!  It makes a lot and is very rich, so I'll only make this for a larger group.  Really simple to put together, it's just the cooling/chilling that takes so much time.  I solved this by doing only 1 or 2 layers per night in the days leading up to Christmas and refrigerating in between times.  You definitely need waxed paper or parchment paper on the bottom of the pan or you'll never get these out - they're very sticky.

I did not change any of the ingredients and they are fantastic.  I definintely recommend lining the botton of the pan with parchment paper as they are tough to get out of the pan.  I also recommend putting each layer in the freezer, they did not seperate that way.

this recipe irritated me so much i registeredfor an allrecipies.com account to vent about it.

after three days and numerous attempts to get this thing to set up, i am officially giving up. 

the second layer never solidified for me, and the third layer became incredibly hard to cut through. sure they tasted good, but what i am left with is a mess of marshmallow fluff and peanuts. 

i will attempt this recipe again in the future, but for now I am completely down and out on it.

I made these a couple of years ago, and I've been asked to make them again so many times that I'm finally giving in and doing it.  They really are to die for!!  This recipe is so simple, but does require some time on your part in order to let each layer solidify.  These will make you a hit at any party!

Divine!  I thought it tasted exactly like a Snickers candy bar.  I made sure to spray my pan with cooking spray and I let the fudge sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes which made it easier to get out of the pan.

This is a great recipe! I loved how much these tasted like real Snickers candy. I used caramel topping for ice cream as one reviewer suggested. I strongly advise against using it. It made things quite messy and sticky. Next time, I'll use a thicker caramel-- perhaps the carmel used to make caramel apples. Otherwise, I'll be making this a Christmas staple.

I used this recipe with my Jr. High youth group and the girls loved it! We were able to do a layer and then another craft while waiting for the previous layer to set up. It was a great recipe to do with a group of kids and the parents all thanked me for the tasty goodies their girls brought home!

This was wonderful, looked very nice with all the different layers.  Instead of using marshmallow creme I melted marshmallows with the butter and added a little bit of sweetened condensed milk, turned out beautiful.  Also, instead of using evaporated milk and sugar I used sweetened condensed milk for that also - approx 2/3 cup.

This was good and everyone enjoyed it, but I would not call it fudge. It tasted a lot like a snickers and I left out the butterscotch and used peanutbutter chips instead. I refridgerated after each layer and had no problems when cutting. I did freeze it after cutting into squares because everything stayed really soft and melted easily. Don't leave out for too long cause it melts!

Wow. I followed the recipe exactly...well, I may have put a bit extra vanilla in but otherwise I stayed with the recipe and it is out of this world. I'm surprised Mars or Nestle hasn't picked this up.

This was tasty, but it didn't stand out, in my opinion.  It was difficult to get out of the pan, so next time I will line the pan with parchment paper.  I didn't read reviews beforehand so I unfortunately missed that.

I agree with some reviewers who said to omit the 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips for chocolate for one of the layers. Also, don't forget to line pan with parchment paper! (I wish I would have read that before making.) Also, when making the caramel layer I accidently put in 1/4 cup of evaporated milk instead of heavy cream..it still turned out great, didn't really need to buy that heavy whipping cream.

This recipe was awesome!  It was very easy to make, and not time-consuming at all, save for waiting for each layer to set.  I made this while I was baking a couple of other things to put in gift baskets, so I didn't notice the wait time at all.  It came out beautifully, and tastes amazing - I almost couldn't stop myself from eating it!  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and replaced the butterscotch chips for the top layer with chocolate chips.  The only reason I used butterscotch for the bottom layer was because I already had an open bag.  I think if you left them out completely it wouldn't affect the taste too much.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I took previous advice and used the buttescotch for just the bottom layer and also made them in individule cupcake liners. This was a huge hit at our party! Worth the extra time

Wow, these turned out amazing.  I made tins of different types of fudge from this website.  This one came out the best.  People asked if I really made this at home.  It does take some patience, but it is well worth the trouble.

Oh my gosh.. I did it! I found this recipe quite tricky! Though it ended up delicious, it was very messy. all of the components took much longer then I anticipated, mostly due to having to make the marshmallow cream myself as I could not find it at any of my grocery stores. With all of this being said, this recipe was spectacular to make and I had a lot of fun with it!

excellent and easy to make.  although i will say they are very rich and little pieces go a long way.  i did only put the butterscotch chips in 1 layer since so many reviewers suggested this, but i didnt have a strong taste of butterscotch at all so....maybe the chips in both layers would be fine after all.

This recipe is wonderful!  It absolutely tastes like a homemade Snickers.  It definitely is time consuming but well worth the effort.  I used that new Reynolds foil that has the easy release side and lined my pan with that, so then I could just lift the whole thing out of the pan and it was easy to cut into pieces.  I refrigerated overnight and then let the pan sit out for a bit before I tried cutting them and it worked fine.  Now they're back in the fridge ready to make an appearance at my holiday gathering!

I wouldn't really call this fudge. It's rather a candy, and a chewy one at that. I stuck the pan out in the snow between layers to get it to harden faster, and that sped up the process quite a bit. I didn't have any evaporated milk or heavy cream, so I subbed vanilla ice cream for each of those items. I only put butterscotch in the bottom layer, and I think that if I had put it in both, it really would have been too overpowering. I liked this one quite a bit.

I made this for a block party and there was a good amount of people there, maybe 100. Before the block party was half over, the fudge was gone! I was only able to take 8 pieces with me, for me and my husband! Honestly this recipe is sinful, it is now officially my holiday/anytime recipe! Thank you to the creator of this wonderful fudge.

My mother used to make this when I was younger and it always seemed so complicated. It tastes so much like a snickers it's amazing. My mom eventually lost the recipe (or it was taken, we're still looking for the culprit) and this is the first site I've been able to find it on... then again I was always looking for it under the name (Snickers Bar Recipes). This is by far my favorite recipe of all time and I'm so glad I found it! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!

Although it these fudge "bars" are time consuming, they have great flavor to them. I made them for my christmas cookie tray and received rave reviews.  Make sure to keep it stored in the fridge because the caramel layer does sort of ooze out of it when it is at room temp.  This has turned out to be one of my husband's favorites so in my book it is well worth the time!

Oh my!!  This fudge is TO DIE for!!  It may seem like a lot of steps, but they go quickly.  Believe me, it's worth it!  And you will want to cut them into very small pieces, because it is very rich fudge.  Yum yum yum!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I froze the bars after each step to make the preparation go faster.  Tasted better than the real thing.  The only slightly negative comment I have is that as the caramel layer warms up it gets soft and the top layer can slide off to the side if bars are not perfectly flat.

Sorry for the low rating.  I spent so much time following the recipe exactly.  It all looked great.  Until...I tried to cut it and remove it from the pan.  Hopeless.  I even left it out overnight and tried to cut it next morning.  It just broke up.  Anyone recommend an easier fudge recipe...one that melts in your mouth??

I made this recipe for a church function and at least 20 people asked me for the recipe!  I made it in one of those "disposable" baking pans and was able to pop it out onto a sheet of waxed paper which made cutting it much easier.

I have a husband who adores fudge so this recipe was a huge hit. We doubled the top layer of the recipe when we tried it and liked how it came out....but we will try doubling the bottom layer next time as it seemed a little hard to get out of the pan. We were a favorite in the neighborhood that day as all the kids came over to try the Snickers candy!

This is just sensational! Did someone say they would give it 10 stars? If so, I definately agree. It was somewhat long to make, but really fun, and there was plenty of time to do things in between layers.
My boyfriend said it was the best dessert he'd ever eaten, my mom said it was sinful (the good kind), and a friend of my mom's took a bite and instantly asked for the recipe.
It's just pure deliciousness!!

Wow! This was wonderful! I skipped the caramel and cream step and just used a jar of thick caramel topping and it worked out great. This recipe was delicious and really does taste like Snikers, which really surprised me!  I'll be making this again and again for Christmas!

This recipe takes some time to make.. mostly just waiting for the previous layer to set in the fridge... but it is well worth the time.  Not the best warm weather candy.  The top layer will slowly slide off if it is kept out in the warm air.  Everyone just loved this candy.

Very decadant and delicious... turned out perfect the first time. I lined the pan with parchment paper and then it was really easy to remove the whole slab for cutting. Sidenote: my son hates peanuts so I made half the pan without peanuts and it turns out fine also.... This was a big hit with all the kids (and the grownups too)!

You won't believe how much this tastes like a Snickers bar!  Much effort involved, but worth it.  Be very careful with the first layer...I burned it the first time.  Second time I lowered the heat to medium-low and it was fine.  They are extrememly gooey, so keep them in the fridge so that they stay set.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great no-bake recipe. Watch carefully so the chocolate and carmel doesn't burn. It makes a lot!! Great to bring as a hostess gift. I put them in mini-cupcake cups.

Pretty easy if you just take the time to let every layer set up.  I added sea salt on top of the caramel layer.  HUGE hit at my office this year!

Excellent!  To avoid caramel melting after cut when at room temp, consider omitting cream from caramel layer. Line pan with parchment. Score top chocolate layer when soft set. Then remove from pan and cut on board when fully chilled.

I've made this recipe twice. The most important thing is not to rush it. It will need more time to set after the final layer. If enough time isn't given it will be messy. If left out at room temperature for more than a few hours, the caramel layer will start to melt some.

Regardless, this is some amazing fudge that looks impressive.

This recipe has become a favourite!
I read previous reviews and amended the recipe as follows:
Only used butterscotch chips in the first layer. For the final layer substituted more choc chips for the butterscotch. 
For the caramel - I microwaved the caramel with only 30ml cream/ milk for 2-3 mins stirring after each minute. Caramel set well and everything turned out delicious! :)

Made exactly as written, allowed time between each layer to cool and set in the fridge. Did not have any problems with my layers, just right as is. Extremely rich and decadent!

I made this for a party last night, and it was given rave reviews.  I omitted the butterscotch chips, and used peanut butter chips instead, worked out well.  This is a bit messy, but oh so delicious!! Great recipe!

This recipe is good, however, it is time consuming and uses lots of pots (lots of washing dishes).  I also think the caramel is a little distracting from the creaminess of the chocolate part.  I have a recipe like this one without the caramel and it is much better and less work.

These are yummy, but I too think that I did something wrong! It was very difficult to get the squares out of the pan and when left at room temperature the caramel layer "melted" and I was left with a blob of caramel with a chocolate layer on the bottom and top. Trying to remove the squares when they were quite cool seem to work best, but did not solve my "melting" problem. I wish they had worked :(

I think I might have done something not right.  It was very hard to get out of the pan in those small pieces.  It came out but the top and bottom layer was very hard to keep attached to the whole piece.  It was good though even when it fell off we ate those pieces too!  Definite potential here!  Reminded me of a snickers bar!

I followed the suggestions made by looders and it came our perfect!  I forgot to add the peanuts to the filling layer, so I added them to the carmel layer and it worked out fine.  Will pass this recipe along.

Very rich, HUGE hit at all my parties! It is not easy and I only make it during the holidays. It takes time and is a bit messy. But this really is the closest thing to a Snickers that I have tasted and it is amazing!! I have been making it now for 4 years and will continue it as afamily tradition! while the cookies are baking, you can be making a layer. Thanks for submitting this!

This is time consuming but definitely worth it.  Good for a relaxed weekend day when you are putzing around the house.  I agree with a previous poster in that the butterscotch flavor tends to dominate.  I also found it hard to take out of the pan.  Let it sit on the counter for a few minutes before attempting to cut it, and be careful to not to hack up the bottom of your pan like I did.  On the Filling Layer, measure out the ingredients before starting and WORK FAST after you take it off the heat.  It hardens quickly.  Overall, delicious recipe, and I will be making it again.

This is quite tasty.  I made it without nuts because of my company, but I think it needs the salty kick.  Be sure to keep it refrigerated because it melts if kept at room temp too long!

This was WONDERFUL. I made it for a work function and I could have asked my co-workers to do all my work and they would have if I gave them some more of this yummy treat!!

Fantastic!
 Makes a tonne so I was able to cut it into several pieces and wrap them in fancy Christmas bags to give to friends. I had trouble getting it out of the pan and will use baking paper next time.

Even though it was not fudge consistency it was great tasting.  I don't know what I did wrong but the middle ooozed.  I had to put it in the freezer to give it as Snicker's Candy.

Wow!  Whoever came up with this recipe figured out the secret to the nougat in Snickers candy!  I left out the whipping cream in the caramel layer, and possibly because of that, my caramel layer melted everywhere.  So I just had to re-cut them, scraping the oozing caramel off of the sides.  But they were fantastic tasting, thanks!

I admit I was skeptical while making this (the filling layer didn't look very appetizing) but it turned out sooooo good!!! I gave these away as treats at work and people raved. And my boyfriend gobbled down the rest in like two days. Yum.

WOW!!  This recipe required a lot of work (especialy unwrapping all of those caramels), but in the end it was totally worth it!  The result is delicious, not exactly like a Snickers, but just as good.  Very rich though, so if you don't like things too sweet, this is not for you.  I sent it with my husband to work, and he said the guys were oohing and aahing like a bunch over women about it!  Will definitely make it again, but when I have plenty of time to do so!!

This tasted very good. And yes it does taste just like a snickers bar. I did like that taste, but I don't think I'll make it again. I think it would be easier to  just cut up a snickers bar.. that's how close this tasted to me. It's nice to know I can recreate a Snickers bar if I ever want to again.

I loved how this tasted.  My only complaint is that I added milk to the top layer and it never hardened.  Next time I'll skip the milk and just go with the list of ingredients.

Takes some work but *SO* worth it. The directions were easy to follow and it came out great! I made these as Christmas gifts last year. The only problem I had was that once the fudge was at out of the fridge and room temp again, the caramel would cause the layers to shift once cut. No biggie though. So delicious!!

Wow! This is a delicious recipe. It does taste very much like Snickers bars, but better and richer. I delivered this fudge to neighbors for Christmas and got three phone calls the next day raving about it.

Excellent recipe, tastes so good!  Recommend putting cut squares into mini-cupcake papers, because caramel layer leaks out, even when refrigerated.  Took me longer than the time indicated.  Will definitely make again.
