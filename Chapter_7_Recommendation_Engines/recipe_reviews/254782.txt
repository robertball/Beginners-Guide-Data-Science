I substituted out the oil for applesauce and it’s super moist and super healthy and low fat. I also cut the sugar down by half a cup cuz I roasted the sweet potatoes too pull out natural sugars. So it’s all around healthier and just as delicious.

Very good!  Since I try to avoid white sugar I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup pure maple syrup.  Also I used organic unflavored coconut oil in place of vegetable and added 1 banana and some chopped dates to the pecans.  To save time I used the microwave for the 1 sweet potato.  My oven has convection bake so it only took about 50 minutes at 350.  I was careful not to over mix the batter and used stone ground white whole wheat flour.  Will definitely make again!

Made this exactly like the recipe except I didn't have Chopped Pecans.  I measured the ingredients precisely as the recipe calls.  Then I combined the ingredients in the same way.  I waited patiently for the bread to cool down.  I cut a slice of the Vegan Sweet Potato Bread.  This is by far one of the delicious Pumpkin Breads that I made.   It is sweetened just right.  Not too sweet.  This will be the Pumpkin bread for future Fall recipes!

I doubled the batter and made about 3 dozen muffins with this recipe. All five of us, including 3 picky toddlers loved them. Will make these again!
