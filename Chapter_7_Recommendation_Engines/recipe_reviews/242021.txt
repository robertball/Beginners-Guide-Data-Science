Very nice, Celeste! It's hard to believe only three ingredients make such a delectable spread! I've taken it to two parties, and no one can stop eating this little goodie.  I'm so happy this has been published, because now more people can share the love.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my review from 2/24/10---and it STILL remains a favorite of ours!  This is a spread I have made countless times. The flavor is subtle and delectable and is suited to a variety of breads or crackers. I usually make it in small batches, using the 4- or 5-oz packages of chevre because there are usually just the two of us! It is a perfect accompaniment to a glass of wine before dinner. When my youngest granddaughter sees it now, she just goes nuts because she can hardly wait for tastes! I could never thank Celeste enough for aiding my new addiction to meyer lemon olive oil--could never be without it! And this is a perfect way to use it!
