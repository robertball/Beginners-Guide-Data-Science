I made 1/2 recipe in an 8x8 pan and they were excellent!  It should be mentioned that when using a glass pan the temperature should be reduced by 25 degrees (I forgot, and the edges were a little dark).  Otherwise these were very moist and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have now made this several times, which I believe would make this recipe my standard. These brownies were even fabulous on the occasions when I substituted 1 banana mashed with 1tsp of baking powder for the eggs (as per allrecipes suggestion in the reference section) when trying to accommodate for allergies. Also, I must note that a few times they have not been as chewy as I would have liked (other reviews have alluded to this as well), however I have determined that is due to overcooking; taking them out when they are still a tad 'gooey' has been the key for me in reaching optimal succulence!

this recipe is amazing! i modified it a little bit to suit my taste, but still: incredible! i  cut down the sugar to 1 cup, used the vanilla extract and added some almond extract to it. I also increased the cocoa to 1 cup dark cocoa to make it more decadent without making it overpoweringly sweet. i added 1/2 cup of each, semi-sweet and white chocolate chips, which looked really pretty once you cut the brownies into squares. i toasted the  walnuts before using them for the recipes, and didn't stir it into the mix. instead, i added them on the top after spreading the batter into the pan, and sprinkled with whie chocolate chips. deliscious, and my friends nearly cried out of joy after smelling the not-too-overpowering richness of the cocoa and biting into one of these squares!

I am a volunteer serving in the Philippines on a very slim budget, but I love cooking and baking.  I spent a good deal of time using the allrecipes ingredient search to find a brownie recipe with ingredients that I would be able to find easily, mainly cocoa powder instead of chocolate squares.  I had never made brownies from scratch, but this recipe yields the best brownies I have ever had, and everyone here in the Philippines absolutely loves them! I even used the local cocoa.  Even though I had to use someone else's oven to make these brownies, they were well worth it and will continue to pop up at all festive occassions!

These were quick, easy, and delivered the brownie satisfaction we were looking for. I keep all the ingredients on hand so it'll be an easy one to make again.

YUM YUM YUMMY!! These are fabulous!! This is the 3rd recipe 
I've tried for brownies and by far the best! They come out so moist and fudgy and chewy and chocolatey!! What more could you possibly want from a brownie?? I left the nuts out (personal preference) and instead sprinkled mini chocolate chips and walnuts over the top before baking. We had some with no topping, some with only chocolate chip topping and some with both chocolate chip and walnut topping! They were absolutely scrumptious, and you really get a nice variety when made like this. My husband asked me if I would bake two batches for him to take to work on Friday for the Halloween party he's having in his office!

I used this recipe and then added a cheesecake topping by using the "Cheesecake Brownies" recipe on this site and it turned out great.  A few of my friends commented on a pleasant nutty and/or cinnamon flavor, though neither were in the recipe, and I got overall rave reviews.

cut the recipe in half only change that was needed was more water to allow the batter to mix together. Baked 25-30 mins on 325*F as I was using a glass pan.

Very very good!!!! In between fudge brownies and cake type brownies. Definitely will make these again!!! Next time I think I will add in chocolate chips since I would have liked them to have a little more chocolate taste.

Absolutely perfect. I moved out to Wyoming over 2 years ago and my former go-to brownie recipe lost it's fudginess with the altitude change. I haven't been able to make adjustments that work and have been looking for that perfect, dense, fudgy brownie recipe ever since. My search has ended - thanks so much! :)

When I first made this, they were VERY cakey. And on the dry side. After a night in the fridge they are much more like brownies.  Great flavor. Thanks

These were not my favorite. Very cake-like and dense. They were missing the fat(oil). Also remind me of a health-food brownie

These brownies are awesome!  I've made them twice now and both times I've followed the recipe and they came out perfect.  Make sure you take them out of the oven when they're still a little underdone because they will continue to cook in the pan when they're cooling.  If you leave them to finish baking in the oven and then take them out they will dry out more and not be very chewy.  This will definitely be my go to brownie recipe!

Delicious and perfect! I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan, and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of nuts. (Baked for 22 minutes) Too delicious!! Next time I'll use a slightly smaller pan, as they were a little thin.

Great recipe! I used Ghiradelli natural unsweetened cocoa powder.  There is plenty of sugar in the recipe, so be sure you are not using sweetened cocoa.  I added one extra Tbsp of water to get my mixture to be pourable.  I am at high altitude.  I greased a metal pan with unsalted butter and baked mine for 23 minutes and will try 21 next time.  My oven is usually on the high end, so most of my recipes come out at the soonest time given.  This mixture goes from gooey to cooked in the middle really quickly, so keep checking!  A metal pan will stay hot for a good long while and the brownies will continue to cook while cooling in the pan on a wire rack.

I prefer a fudgier, chewier brownie than this recipe produces.  I baked them for 18 minutes & I think that may have been a couple minutes too long.  Next time I will try using leftover coffee instead of the water & vanilla.

I tried this one a few weeks ago and my husband thought they were the absolute best brownies he has ever had.  Instead of putting in nuts, I put in chocolate chunks because i love lots of chocolate.  :D

      These are moist, chewy (the way I like them), and super chocolatey!  :D  I see no reason to make any changes, and my policy is ALWAYS to make the recipe as is the first time, and rate it based off of that otherwise you aren't reviewing the recipe you are reviewing YOUR creation.  :)

      Enjoy!!!  God Bless ~Amy

Loved these brownies... not too cake-y and a good chocolate fix. Used an 8X8 glass pan and baked 40 mins. also used 1 cup Hershey's cocoa, and 1/4 cup butter plus 1/2 veg oil since I ran out of butter. I will try again following the recipe to a T... except the cocoa part, the extra 1/4 cup made it super chocolate-y. Will also add 1 cup choc chips next time.

I made these twice already and really like them.  I used a 7 x ll pan because I thought 9 x 13 would make them too thin.  Very good recipe. Dont need to buy d. hines anymore. Usually keep the cocoa powder in the house.  Try it.

Delicious, chewy, fudgy brownies.  My only complaint is that these are rather thin brownies, which could be easily solved by using a smaller pan and increasing the baking time a little.  I added some chocolate chips to the top before baking and then just served with powdered sugar on top.  I used a foil lined pan and refrigerated for awhile, which made these very easy to remove from the pan and cut into nice pieces. They do taste best at room temperature.

This recipe is wonderful....sooooo much better than the box brownies and pretty much just as easy. I did not even have to get out my mixer and I really love that!  I made them as directed and I also added some caramel (swirled in them before baked).  The second time I made them with dark chocolate cocoa powder and they were wonderful too!

Super yummy especially if you're looking for a chewy brownie recipe. I did add a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I excluded the nuts and powdered sugar. I also had to cook the brownies for 30 minutes total. I will probably never buy a boxed brownie mix again!

AWESOME!! And I only used 1 cup of sugar! Still PLENTY sweet and somewhat healthier. I also used half whole wheat flour. You'd never know. Makes me a feel a tad less guilty about clearing a third of the pan in one night.... These are hands-down the best homemade brownies I've ever made.

These were extremely moist and fudgy. I could hardly get them from the pan in one piece though because they were so moist.  I can't imagine getting only 12 servings from this because it made a huge pan full. This came in a close second to my hubby's all time favorite brownie so kudos for that! I skipped the powdered sugar dusted on top since DH is a brownie purist (meaning don't try to dress them up). Definitely a keeper and using the cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate, chips, or fudge syrup is always a plus at my house. These were so good I even ate two corners!

Excellent brownie recipe, dense, very chocolatey and not too sweet. This is the second time I've made them. The first time I followed the recipe completely with no changes with great results.  This time I've substituted some of the sugar with Splenda to try and reduce the carbs . I used 1 cup of white sugar and 2/3 cup of Splenda with good results. Next time I plan to use 1cup of splenda instead. Pretty perfect to satisfy my chocolate craving.

I made two batches - one made exactly as written, and another with changes.  The second batch - instead of 3/4 cup butter, I substituted 1/4 cup butter + 1/2 cup applesauce.  I then cut the the sugar to 1 cup and increased the cocoa powder to 1 full cup.  My husband likes the first batch, but I like the second batch since the first was too sweet for me.  Both did come out cakey.  Maybe I'll try a more fudgey recipe next.

These were simply "the best."  I made them according to the recipe except that I used a 9x9 pan with the insert that cuts the brownies.  Watch baking time closely.  In my oven, they looked "done" after 21 minutes.  DO NOT OVERBAKE.  They were great the first day and even better the second.  Loved them

These were great, I used special dark baking cocoa powder, mixed the margarine with the sugar while it was still hot and dbl the recipe and used extra large sheet pan...you can see how they came out by the pic...I didnt use the nuts or the frosting...they dont need it if you dont want it.

I have tried 100 different brownie recipes and have never found one that is as good as the brownies you make from the box. This is a first!! These brownies are moist and delicious!!! The only change I made was using Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, and I would highly recommend it!

These are delicious, easy to make brownies!! I mixed 1/4 cup peanut butter, 2 Tbs. margarine, 1 cup powdered sugar,and just enough milk to make it creamy then dotted it on top and swirled with a knife.  SSSSOooo good... just make sure to add the powdered sugar a little at a time so it won't be clumpy. mmmmmm....

Really good brownies.  I too only put 1 cup of sugar in the recipie.  I also put about a cup of smarties in it.  It was really decadent - you couldn't even tell that there was less sugar.

These are, by FAR, the best brownies I've ever made (and that's not a small amount of brownies). Fabulous.  Although, while making the recipe I was irritated over all of the "random" amounts - 1 1/3rd of this or 7/16th's of that (ok, not really).  I don't know, it bugged me. lol But, man, are they ever worth it - I'll always keep Nestle cocoa on hand now.

Wow, these are awesome, totally replaced my recent 'best brownie ever' recipe! Made these for my husband's work and I was actually sad to see them go! (They loved them by the way, they 'lit up like it was Christmas' when they tried them)

I was in the mood for brownies tonight and only had cocoa powder (no chocolate squares/chips/etc) and came across this recipe. Threw it together *really* fast and only omitted the nuts and powdered sugar. I think I used a bit more flour than called for because the batter seemed really wet. These are thinner than boxed brownies so either prepare for thin brownies or use a smaller pan.

Love this recipe! I tripled the recipe for holiday tins but I added 1 cup of cold strong brewed coffee (leftover from this morning) 1 bag of semi sweet choc. chips and browned the melted butter and left out the nuts. Added a sizzle of melted white chocolate when totaly cooled. I called them dark chocolate brown butter esspresso brownies. Total hit!

I've stopped buying boxed brownies since I've discovered this recipe!  It is so easy to put together and gives me a consistent result every time.  Moist, chocolatey, and not cakey.  I follow the recipe exactly, except that I omit the nuts since the family doesn't like them.  I usually bake for 20 min only.

These were not exactly chewy, but they tasted good. More on the cakey side. Very chocolatey, not too sweet (despite other reviews). Could have done with the chocolate chips though.

I tried another recipe off of this site, and they turned out horrible (dry and not much taste), and then I found these!  They are amazingly chewy, moist and the icing sugar on top is the perfect touch!  I will be making this again.

Followed recipe and they came out perfect!  Although, I did set the oven to 325 degrees because I used a glass pan.

These were great! I wasn't really sure it was done after about 40 mins, but I took it out anyway, and it set nicely while cooling. I also added semisweet choco chips instead of walnuts (not a full cup, just a few handfuls) and when we cut the brownies, they were melted just enough and it came out delish!

Best brownies ever, slight mod on this.  I added 1 cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar.  Rounded out the flavor profile perfectly.  I also added a thick layer of pecans on top then pushed them into the batter.  Afterwards I drizzeled ice cream Carmel topping laterally and horizontaly to make a yummy pattern that will set off the pecans nicely.

These are good brownies, but I thought they would be more chewy/fudgy. These are definitely cake-like brownies, not what I was looking for.

Warning - these are lethal! Used choc chips instead of nuts (kids don't like nuts).  My whole family devoured them while raving how much better they are than those made from a mix.  Easy and delicious.  Won't be buying mixes anymore!

If you like a thick, dense brownie this is the recipe you want. I double the recipe to really fill the 9x13 pan and add a cup of chocolate chips as an extra.  Be careful though, will dry out if overcooked!

I think this is a very good brownie. I only put 1/2 c. chopped nuts in it and i put a little extra vanilla in it and they turned out yummy and chewie. The only thing is to watch the time carefully, I had mine in 18 mins. and they turned out, this could be why some people said theirs turned out cakey. I think next time i will add some chocolate chips or try to marble them.

Excellent!  These were devoured at a Superbowl gathering and I WILL make these over and over! I don't know how the other rater said they didn't have the fat of a "regular" brownie...these were fudgey deliciousness, and I bake and cook a lot!

This was very tasty! Perfect with a cup of milk. A bit more 'cakey' than your traditional dry/flaky brownie. I baked it in a glass dish, slightly smaller than 13x9 for 28 minutes, at 350. i also used 2 parts tartar/1 part baking soda for the baking powder as a substitute and it tastes just fine.

Best and easiest brownie recipe ever.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine...which always improves any recipe.  Definitely moist and chewy.  They're somewhere between a fudgy brownie and a cake-like brownie...perfect!  My oven temp is dead on and I did cook these for the full 25 minutes.  Unlike many brownie recipes where the edges are too hard by the time you get the center cooked, these were (again) perfect!

While this was an ok-tasting dessert, there is no way I would call this chewy or categorize it as a brownie. It was chocolate cake. It was a decent chocolate cake but a highly disappointing brownie. I won't make this again.

Excellent basic recipe. I made exactly as is for the review and my kids loved it.  Then I made my own adjustment, and it was still great. I  doubled the recipe and used half reg cocoa and half Dutch processed and added half a bag melted chip. Unbelievable! Yes the orig recipe is thin, but if you didn't know that by the amt of flour, well I don't know what to tell you.

The brownies were a little thin, so I added frosting and sprinkled pecans on top.. other than that, they were very good tasting.

These are so awesome and so very easy to make. I think I would add some dark chocolate cocoa and some powdered coffee to the next batch. I added white chocolate chips to this as I was out of nuts and used liquid eggs in place of eggs.

So I have never made brownies from scratch before, but i decided to make these for my friends birthday (she loves brownies). They came out really really good! Very chewy. The trick is to not over bake. I baked for 18 minutes at 350 and they came out perfect. I topped with a chocolate frosting to make them extra decadent. The only thing i changed was the the cocoa; i used Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa. I will use this recipe again. =)

These are THIN!  I don't think that's clear from the picture, and they are pretty tasty, but they are only about 1/2" thick. They were fine for what I was using them for, as a base for a brownie sundae for my kids' sleepover, but they wouldn't look very appealing on a dessert tray. I won't stop here...I will keep looking for a cocoa brownie recipe.

These turned out pretty good for me. I was missing a teaspoon of vanilla and they still tasted good. I'm thinking I will reduce the flour next time though by 1/8 a cup.

Best made from scratch brownie ever! I purchased a good baking cocoa from our local spice shop, and used King Arthurs all purpose flour(costs more but it is just a "fluffier" flour). Yum

reduced the sugar to 1 1/2c. Good flavor.  In a 9x13 pan it was thin, could try one and half batches for thicker brownie.

I made these into delicious brownie cookies. Had to make a few changes due to a shortage of butter, but still turned out great! For butter I substituted in 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Then added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Baked at 350 for 10-12 mins. Turned out wonderful!

These were very yummy:) I used a whipped margerine spread (worked just fine- I couldn't tell there was less fat & calories) and hershey's special dark cocoa, baked them in muffin cups until they looked like they should still be in for a couple more minutes-moist and chewy once cooled. My mom, friend, and boyfriend told me multiple times how good they were. This is the homeade brownie recipe I will use from now on. Thank you!

i followed the recipe except for one exchange: instead of using nuts i added some bacon.  first i cut up and sauteed 3 strips of bacon.  i added the bacon to sections of a cupcake baking sheet, then spooned the brownie batter on top (i halved the recipe, which gave me 9 bacon brownies).  it came out amazing, and i will definitely use this brownie recipe again.     note: cooked at 350 for 15 min, then 300 for 5 min

These brownies are delicious. I get nervous each time I make them... they are so dense and seem dry when I manage to get them into the pan, but they always come out great. I add half a bag of chocolate chips as well.. its the perfect chocolate treat.

Great base recipe, followed it exactly the first time a made them.  The second time I added walnuts and the crunchy texture was very nice.  I think next time I will follow other reviewers and add some kind of chips or caramel on top.  The 3/4 cup of cocoa is nice, any more and I think they would be un-edible.  Thanks for a great brownie recipe!

Wow!!!!!  This recipe is a keeper.  I wouldn't change a thing!  When I made these I sprinkled the nuts on top--looked nice with the powdered sugar--then topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This was probably one of the easiest desserts I have ever made.

these were great. i used one cup of cocoa because i didn't want to leave 1/4 in the container and i think it was too much so next time i will stick to the recipe. they seem a bit floury though so maybe next time i'll cut it to just 1 cup. best brownies ever.

After a peanut butter cookie disaster, I made these. Super simple and a half recipe is perfect for a metal 8x8 baking pan. I did sprinkle in some semi-sweet chocolate chips and about a half cup or so of chopped pecans. 25 minutes at 350 was just right for this. I'm thinking I might frost this with something, but they're good as is. This would be a good base for just about anything, if you wanted to jazz them up. I think next time, I might increase the cocoa to a full cup.

I stopped at 2 stores looking for Betty Crocker Fudge Brownies tonight and there were none...now I'm really glad about that, because these are just as good, and healthier with my organic and whole wheat ingrediants!  I am SO excited that I found a homemade recipe that I LOVE!  I followed all of the directions except that I put in a little extra cocoa and didn't let them cool completely in the pan because I wasn't patient enough! :)

This is my go to brownie recipe. They come out with the perfect flavor every time, and are so easy to make! I even made them with the cream cheese swirls from the recipe for Cheesecake Brownies on this site and it was a delicious variation.  It is easy to overbake these and if you do they will be dry, so make sure to take them out when the toothpick still comes out with little sticky bits stuck to it.

i halved this recipe and also reduced the sugar to 1 cup (.5 cup for the halved version).  VERY GOOD!  definitely the kind of brownie you need to let cool so the chewiness develops--otherwise you have a gloopy (yummy!) mess...well, that's good with ice cream ;)  hehe!

I always make fudgy brownies, but lately I've wanted to try a chewy brownie recipe (but not cakey!). I made this recipe pretty much as directed (I added a little instant coffee to the 2T of water, and I added chocolate chips), and I can say that for chewy brownies, they are pretty good. Compared to the fugdy brownies I make, these of course are not as dense, but they aren't cakey either, and they have a good texture and chocolate flavor. I will make these again when I'm in the mood for a less 'serious'/dense brownie. I can see these being a good base for sundaes, with ice cream and fudge sauce.

Great brownie!  Perfect thick n chewy consistency.  I was in a pinch for a good, fairly quick n easy brownie recipe as I needed it for a cheesecake topped recipe.  This one sounded close to what I needed n had good reviews.  Made it exactly to the recipe and it turned out excellent.  Will use this one over all others I've collected over time.  The chocolate frosting I recipe is an excellent compliment to these!  Thanks for the recipe when I needed it most!

This is a very good recipe with a few minor tweaks. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to batter and a couple of tablespoons of warm water to loosen batter (it was VERY stiff). Underbaked for 17mins. They came out nice and moist, a little gooey. Chewy around edges, but the middle was soft. Overall, a recipe I'll use again.

These were awesome! My family is really picky about their brownies - the darker and denser, the better - so I modified this recipe very slightly by adding 3 tbsp. more water and reducing the sugar by 1/2 cup. I took them out after 20 minutes and allowed them to cool for an hour before cutting them into bars. Moist, chewy, DELICIOUS!

I was dissaponted by this recipe. The brownies were very cakey - not fudgy or moist at all. The recipe also called for large amounts of cocoa and sugar which I didn't find too economical.

Awesome!!  I love these.  They are perfect.  Very rich, moist, fudgy, and chewy.  Not cakey at all.  They have that crackly, flaky crust on top which I love.  I used chocolate chips in place of the nuts.  My search has ended!

I like thick brownies, so I baked these in a 9X9 stoneware pan for 30 minutes.  Stoneware can take a little longer than metal.  Brownies turned out perfect...not too dry or mushy.

These didn't rise right for me but I realized I have expired baking powder.  The taste is great!  I did what another reviewer did and halved the recipe for an 8x8.  I used 1/4 cup mini choc chips instead of nuts.  Delicious despite the flatness!

Fabulous recipe!  I served these at a family Birthday Party (Birthday boy's request) with home made ice cream.  Although the ice cream is the family favorite, it was the brownies that received the rave reviews this time.  I will definitely make these again and again.  I did make one change though.  I used Droste Cocoa in lieu of the prescribed NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Baking Cocoa.  Given that the main flavor in the recipe is chocolate, I wanted a quality chocolate cocoa. I made the right choice.  The improved flavor with a higher quality cocoa is very noticeable and worth the extra expense.  After all, if we are taking the time to make brownies from scratch...... shouldn't they be far superior to anything out of a box?

Great recipe, I added a layer of homemade caramel sauce on top and swirled it in with a knife. Took awhile to bake that way, but the texture was amazing.

I finally became a member of this site just so I could tell everyone how great this recipe is!  These are the best brownies I have ever had!  I added one cup of chocolate chips and about 1/2 cup of walnuts.  We also took them out of the oven a little early.  The brownies disappeared in less than a day.  You have to try these!

I usually avoid homemade brownie recipes because they come out dry.  This was the BEST brownie recipe ever.  I added mint m&ms to one batch and they were a huge hit with adults and teenagers alike!  Today's batch will include Reese's Pieces.  Thanks for a keeper!!

These were more like a 4 1/2 but not quite a 5 star recipe.  I made them and added 1/3 c. white chips, 1/3 c. semi-sweet chips, 1/3 c. milk chocolate chips for added flavor.  Yummy!!!

Yumm!   I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder since I'm a fool for dark chocolate and added 1 tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla extract.    *drools*   So very good, I'm not sure there will be any left for my hubby by the time he gets home from work!    ;o}

I made these brownies for a party and everyone loved them!  I ended up forgeting to melt the butter so after mixing everything together I then heated it up in a skillet to melt the butter.  After trying them my 'erred' way and the correct way, I prefer 'my' way.  I believe heating the entire mixture (verses just melting the butter) changes the consistency so they are more fudgy. These are very easy to make and made a nice amount.  I like the fact that you get more brownies than from a traditional recipe that goes in an 8x8 pan.  These brownies were moist, chewy, and chocolately enough to satisfy my chocolate craving!  I will definitely be making these again!!!

I made one batch of this brownie recipe and one batch of "Best Brownies" (also on this site). We liked the other recipe better because they weren't as sweet but they were both very good. I frosted them with German Chocolate Cake Frosting II (from this site) and I would definitely do that again. After I cut these into squares, I've been keeping them in the freezer and they're great to eat frozen as well.

These brownies were easy to make with items on hand and tasted pretty good.  They were fudgey, chewy, and had a little bit of a crispy crust on top.  My only problem came from following some of the other suggestions to use an 8x8 pan:  They were nearly an inch thick, and never did cook all the way in the middle despite baking for over an hour!  That's too long to wait when you are craving chocolate!!  I did add a handful of chocolate chips as did others, and they didn't even melt in the center of the pan!  Next time I will try spreading them in a 9x13 pan and see what happens.

I LOVE to cook, and have tried out alot of different brownie recipies, and this one is most deffinetly my favorite!! I don't think I'll want to look any further. It was more fudgy and had a more distinct chocolate flavor than the others. I was craving chocolate and it did the trick, even without the nuts and powdered sugar!!

Yum! This is a nice fudgy brownie.  I made them without nuts and did not sprinkle powdered sugar on them.  Absolutely wonderful with vanilla ice cream sprinkled with walnuts. I baked them for 18 minutes and they were pretty gooey in the middle, but that's how my husband likes them.

We are in a Gr. 10 foods class from SSM,Ont. Our whole class was assigned to make brownies useing different kinds of recipes, and we got this one "Chewy Cocoa Brownies". They were very good and the mixture was gooey. They were very chewy, yummy, and great!. So if you like chewy brownies that are delicious try out this recipe! Unless you really like nuts try not using them this recipe is better without them.

used Hershey 's natural unsweetened cocoa
Kerry butter/canola oil spread because it was all I had today and dessert was mandatory!

the rest of the ingredients were the same except cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups because we  want to use with ice cream sometimes.
 salt 1/2 tsp

The canola oil in kerry spread gave the brownies a slightly cake like texture as expected but nice. Baked 25 mins cut temp to 325  last 10 mins while using  parchment lined pyrex dish.

Amazing!!!!  I will not buy the mixes anymore.  So rich and fudgy!  I'm picky about brownies and these are fabulous.  I did add a cup of chocolate chips, but I think they'd be just as good without, that's just what I always do with brownies.

I left out the nuts and powdered sugar. Baked in a glass pan at 340 degrees for about 22-23 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!!! My favorite brownie yet. They cut clean and came easily out of the pan without crumbling apart at all. I didn't use parchment paper, just buttered the pan. They lasted less than 24 hours in my house, and there are only two of us :-). YUM!!!

Not the texture I was looking for.  Too cake-like, not quite enough chocolate flavor.  Will do in a pinch, I guess, when you're short on ingredients...  probably won't make these again.

This has potential to be dense and fudgy with modifications.  If using a 9"x13" glass pan, turn the temp down by 25-50F degrees depending on your oven and bake for about 15 minutes.

Great, normal recipe for chewy, tasty brownies.  No weird or expensive ingredients.  Like your grandmother would make.  Made this as a base for brownies I shaped like Christmas trees, then topped with green icing and crushed candy canes.  Stuck a 1 1/2" candy cane piece at the base for the trunk. Looked and tasted great.  Searched loads of recipes on this site, and this was the one I chose...thank goodness. Simple and great.

This has become my go-to brownie recipe! I bake them in a 9x9 and they come out so chewy and delicious. I've also used 1/2 C dark cocoa powder and 1/4 C regular cocoa powder... perfect, decadent, chocolate deliciousness!

These were the BEST brownies I have ever made. I used less flour and added chocolate chips and caramel pieces, filling muffin tins with batter and baked for about 15 minutes. Perfection. Gooey, soft and super chocolaty :)

This is getting 4 stars because I did run into a little problem. Made them in a glass 8x8 at 325.  After cooling and cutting they were still runny and mooshy.  So, I think 350 would have been fine.  I did put them back into the oven to cook longer.  Not that its necessarily bad to eat mooshy brownies but I just prefer more solid. Other than the little problem I ran into, the brownies were very good!  I even added 1/8 cup of vegetable oil to the recipe to make sure they came out chewy since I did read 1 review that said they were more like cake.  Worked out perfectly after cooking longer.  Will make again BUT will follow the actual directions.

Perfect recipe. I made it just as the recipe states and they were amazing. Not only is this recipe perfect just the way it is, but it's a perfect base for any of the add-ins you might want to try. I'll never buy box brownies again!

These brownies were very rich and satisfied my chocolate craving. Very chocolatey :) I will say that because of some of the reviews mentioning its "cake-like" consistency, I decided to cut back on the water and only added about 1 Tablespoon. The batter was very thick and did not look like what you would normally see from a boxed mix. Despite this, I spread it in my pan and baked it to see how it turned out. At 18 minutes, it was done! These brownies were moist, chewy, and so good! We loves brownies as a special treat in our house and I hate buying the boxed mix. This recipe will be our brownie recipe from now on! I rated it 4 stars because I think the 2 Tablespoons of water will have made it more "cakey" and less "fudgy". We like them "fudgy".

I think its really important to point out something I have noticed about baking recipes in general. They need to say UNSALTED BUTTER instead of just butter/margarine. If you are making these brownies, or any baked good for that matter, using butter that has salt in it you have just added X amount of salt to that recipe and even if you omit the salt the recipe calls for it may be too much (or not enough). Too much salt = cakey brownies (or, again, whatever baked good you're making). This is something I learned through trial and error in my early 20's right after I got married. Why do they always assume people know this? Anyways, this is a good recipe, box brownies always taste better to me, but for a home made recipe these are about as good as they get. Also, if you use a glass pan, try baking them at 325 degrees.

I love brownies in general and this recipe was really good.  My daughter took these for V-day party at school and all the kids requested more for snack!  Keep an eye on these when they cook as the edges can get a little dry and make sure to cool after they have cooled. My hubby prefers "the best brownies" from this site, but my kids seem to have liked these better when I made a batch of each for comparison. I think this is a great recipe and will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I too modified the recipe using the 1c. cocoa but, 1 1/4c. sugar. (thought the 1 to 1 ratio would be a little bland). Adding 1/2c. coconut (I love coconut and chocolate together) to the mix. After spreading in pan, I pressed 1/2c. chopped pecans and 1/2c. chocolate chips into batter. After cooling, sprinkled with the powered sugar. Found Brownies to be very rich in chocolate flavor and more 'cake-like' than  'brownie form'. Almost falling apart. Sweetness was Good. Would cut back on the cocoa to the 3/4c. next time. Definitely not your everyday Brownie but will make again, with the suggested changes. Will get back to you!

I thought these were a little sweet without modifications and I like chocolate chunk brownies, so I changed it to add only 1 cup of sugar and then stirred in about 6 oz of chocolate chips.  They were delicious!

Yum, I am on a quest to find a perfect brownie and these come pretty darn close. Followed recipe but added sugggestions of others: 1 cup of cocoa, 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a quarter teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. My new oven cooked these done at 16 minutes and I think if I had taken out even two minutes earlier I would have had the fudgier brownie I was looking for. Have to laugh at other comments with regard to "quality" meaning more expensive for ingredients, I used the market brand for both the chips and the cocoa, and the taste is fabulous! I did get a very chocolatey, cakey brownie - great for sundaes or holding frosting. Will try again. Update: made these again and didn't have enough white sugar so I subbed brown sugar for some of the white to equal 1 cup. Used espresso powder and the called for vanilla for flavoring. Then I realized that I only had a stick of butter so I put in a quarter cup of applesauce to get the needed three quarter cup. Cooked to same amount of time again and they came out of pan fine after cooling ten minutes or so. Got a chewier texture this time. Frosted with a ganache made from semi-sweet chocolate chips and two tablespoons of heavy cream melted together. Loved them even more this time. Such a forgiving recipe!!!

These had the exact brownie flavor and texture I love! They were a little soft and messy, but of course I dug in while they were still warm. I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up baking them about 22 minutes. Heaven!

I doubled the recipe. I used a little less flour and a little more cocoa. I'm not sure if I overcooked like it seemed like only 15mins but they are a little cakey.Next time I will add a little more butter to the mix. I also added chocolate chips to one pan and chocolate chips and toffee pieces to the other. Still satisfied my craving for brownies!

Loved this recipe.  Quick, easy and deliciously chewy.  I changed only the sugar - 1 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white.  I also used chopped almonds - perfect.  We served it warm with ice cream and it was good

Made these this weekend because we didn't have a brownie mix!  Substituted Baker's Unsweetened Choc. squares for the cocoa powder (1 sq. per 1/4 c. of cocoa) and they are fantastic!  Good consistency even the next day.  I would add lots of stuff next time (chips, nuts, etc.) but my family likes stuff plain plain plain.

definitely very fudgy brownies from the center and a little cakey on the sides.  but VERY tasty and satisfying.  I didn't have enough regular cocoa so ended up finishing with dark chocolate cocoa that I had.  I also put around a cup of sugar, maybe a tad less, because I can never eat the boxed mixes that are SO sweet.  The end result was perfect sweetness and excellent chocolatiness which may be because I put a few tablespoons of prepared coffee to accentuate the chocolatiness.  Am giving four stars cuz I didn't get that crusty shell on top that I love about brownies.  Not sure why not, but all in all good recipe! (But 1 2/3 cup sugar would be WAY too sweet for us)

it was ok but not what I was expecting , it`s totally different from any brownies mix, as another reviewer said it`s moist but it`s not chewy or fudgy the way I like , and the batter is thick like a cookie dough . it`s a cake like brownies . the only thing I like that it`s not too sweet.

I only gave it four stars because i did alter the recipe. 1c light brown sugar instead of the called for white... a full cup of cocoa and in order to please my turtle loving hubby i added caramel pieces to the batter and put the nuts on top.... this was rated the best ever brownie recipe and was transferred to the keep box. in fact im making a second batch after three requests and a trip to the store for more eggs... also great topped with a chocolate ganache

Surely Moist, but not chewy as the title claims! I used it for the centers of my cupcakes and it was very good; however, the brownie on its own lacked deep chocolate flavor and the chewiness I was searching for.

Very good chewy and fudgey brownie. I added a little extra cocoa and got a good flavor to them. I even "forgot" about them and they got a little over done but were still great. I will make them again.

These brownies were ok.  I followed the recipe, except the nuts.  They were thin, which is great by me, and chewy.  But I didn't find them to be rich or fulfilling.  For the flavor these had, I would probably just make a low-fat version with applesauce, as they taste about the same and has less calories/fat.  Sorry, they just weren't as rich and satisfying as I was hoping.

These just weren't chocolatey enough for me.  Otherwise good.  I maybe screwed it up by using different cocoa-- used Hershey's Dutch Process instead, which is usually super intense.  Texture was right-- nice and chewy, not cakey.  I think I'll make again but maybe mix in a cup of semi-sweet chips at the end so there will be little chocolate explosions throughout.  Either that or just increase the cocoa.

Good brownies, but not very chewy, despite the name. This one's more cake-like.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect. My chocolate fiend of a husband and I are still searching for that perfectly fudgy, chewy brownie. No luck so far.

If you need a chocolate fix this is it! What I had on hand was Hershey's dutch cocoa and chocolate chips...no nuts. They were quick and easy to prepare and sinfully delicious. I will never use a boxed mix again!

Yum!  I did about 1 1/3 cup sugar but could have used just 1 cup.  I also added about 3/4 cup chocolate chips and no nuts.  Mine were not very done, but I pretended it was on purpose, warmed them up to serve and put a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Man, it was wonderful!!!  My husband said he used to make brownies just like this and ate them with milk poured over the top.

Easy enough to throw together in a flash for company, but not as sweet as the box fudge brownie kind.  My company loved them because they wern't as sweet. Chewy and good texture, quick bake time too.  They were warm out of the oven when we were done eating.

Perfect brownies...I would never go back to box mix again. My female coworkers and I don't like sweets too sweet so I cut the sugar down to 1 cup (1/2 white 1/2 brown) and it's sweet just enough.  I use 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract. And instead of 3/4 cup chopped nuts, I just mix half M&M and half toasted grounded almonds (no walnuts available at the time) until they makes 3/4 cup. I use aluminum foil to line my pyrex glass pan and bake at a bit lower temperature like someone here suggested...exactly 18 minutes and it's done. It's moist, chewy and didn't last long! I will make it again tonight.

Great recipe.  I made it on a day when we were snowed in (one inch of snow/ice = snowed in here in the south), and had to make a lot of modifications to it because I didn't have all of the ingredients.  The brownies were still excellent.  Can't wait to actually follow the recipe exactly!

This brownie recipe was very fudgy and chewy.  I am not sure what the others are meaning by cakelike.  Mine came out very moist.  I substituted wheat flour for the all purpose because that is what I had on hand, added in a cup of chocolate chips and took the brownies out a few minutes before they were completely done.  I think that was key.  Also I omitted the vanilla and nuts because I didn't have them.  They came out sooooo goood!!!  Will definitely make again.

I give this recipe five stars because it is really east to make, it has the perfect texture, and they come out looking fantastic! The only problem is that they are not as chocolatey  as I hoped for, the flavor of the nuts is more prodomant than the chocolate. Next time I will add some chocolate chips to the batter I think that will solve the problem.

These were fairly easy to make but they did not come out as chewy as I would have liked.  I followed the recipe but they came out more like cake-like brownie.   Very good taste but only a 3-1/2 stars because they were not chewy enough.

Yummy! My kids loved these brownies. I topped with mint baking chips before baking. Just the right amount of chocolatey chewiness.

I thought it had a bit of a funny texture. It was moist and chewy, but the chocolate flavor wasn't defined and I found the batter hard to spread in the pan.

MMMmmmmm!  These were really easy to make and turned out delicious!  Taking them out of the oven before they're completely done is the key.

The verdict: Yes, very chewy, but not a make again recipes.  I actually thought the brownies were TOO chewy, which i didn't think was possible.  The flavor was very good and rich.  They were a bit too much like 'fudge' and not enough like brownies.  I'll keep looking for a happy medium.  Something chewy but I guess I want more cake like afterall.

this is the ultimate brownie recipe if you are looking for a brownie that is similar to that of MRS FIELD'S brownies. I used an 8 inch by 8 inch baking tray and had to bake for 35-40 min. do attempt to slice the brownie right after it has come out of the oven. make sure it has cooled down significantly before cutting it into slices. all in all I was very much addicted to the brownie i baked!!!!

These are great brownies!  This recipe is so simple and they turn out really well!  I didn't put the powdered sugar on, and I used pecans for the nuts.  I will definitely make these again!

I added roasted macademia nuts and chopped white chocolate. Although not THE BEST recipe for me (I like to make brownies with real chocolate, not cocoa powder)this recipe is very good! I like the taste and chewiness. I baked mine for 25 minutes and let them rest in the oven for another 5 or 10 minutes. Mostly they come out too moist, but these brownies were perfect!

These brownies were delicious, although not as good as the one's my grandmother makes. Very chewy and chocolatey! mmmmm... My boyfriend loved them. I only had one problem, when I tried to spread them into the 9x13 pan the batter would not move so I transfered them into an 8x8 and it worked fine, but I did have to cook them a bit longer. I will definetly make them again!!

These are super fudgey and absolutely perfect. They even come out of the pan easily. I couldn't ask for a better brownie. I added 1/2 c. chocolate chips.

Okay, I've come back to eat my words.  Pardon the pun.  My husband didn't care for the chewiness, but every other person at his work loved them.  Still wondering why I had to bake them for 40mins though.

This recipe was a great one for my grade 10 foods class to experiment on. It was fast and easy to whip up the ingredients together. The texture was chewy and very chocolatey. A yummy treat after the preparation.

My family was amazed that I could make brownies without a boxed mix! Don't know how they thought the mix got in the box. This is a definite "keeper" recipe for those times when you need a delicious dessert quick and easy.
