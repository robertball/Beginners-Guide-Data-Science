This was excellent. It tastes just like ragù alla Bolognese is supposed to taste. I think the red wine and nutmeg are key. At first, the kids didn’t even notice there were lentils instead of meat. The only thing I will change next time is to omit the broth and simply use broth powder. The extra liquid made cooking time a bit long as it took a long time to reduce risking to over cook the lentils. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.

We enjoyed this with some modifications. I used beef broth in place of the wine and veggie broth. I also added a spoonful of basil pesto. Served over zucchini noodles, it was delicious!

I eliminated the mushrooms as I am the only one who likes them .. we are having it tonight .. however I made the Bolognese Friday evening and trust me its worth a do ahead if you are looking forward as the flavors were so much better. Great recipe....

Great recipe.  If you are not a strict vegan, you can top with Parmesan for an extra kick.

I'm not sure if I'll make this again, but if I do I'll be sure to use canned lentils (I made mine separately in a pressure cooker) and cut the peppers and carrots smaller. The flavor was fine, nothing special or WOW inducing. All the other amazing reviews make me think I should give it another shot.

I don’t often review recipes but in my 20 years of using Allrecipes this is one of my favorite recipes. This makes a perfect vegan bolognese. Even husband who is a meat eater had two bowls. It’s delicious and if you are watching sodium it has low sodium since you don’t add any salt! I used no salt added tomatoes and low sodium vegetable broth. Excellent recipe! Thank you!

I was having company for dinner and was serving spaghetti and meatballs. One of my guests is a vegetarian.  I made this recipe as written for that guest, the day before  my company since I felt the flavours would meld better after being reheated.  As I taste tested it, there was something missing so I added about 3/4 of a tsp of salt in addition I added 2 or 3 tbsp of tomato paste as I wanted the bolognese to thicken up as I found it quite loose and watery.  The bottom line was that my guest loved it.   Since there were leftovers, the next day I added some italian sausage chunks,  baby quartered potatoes and beef  broth and made  a lovely soup for dinner for my husband and myself.

I did not expect the flavor to be the same as a meat version, so I was pleased with this recipe. I added finely chopped celery because I can't imagine bolognese (even adapted for veggies) without it. I, too, added a pinch of hot pepper flakes. Since this makes more than I can eat, I am going to try and freeze some and see how that goes.

It was quite tasty but a bit dryer than i expected, perhaps because of my noviceness. :/  
i used white vinegar instead of the wine because im muslim. 
there was no menion of salt so i used black salt, about a teaspoon.
Overall, its a wonderful recipe because all my relatives loved it, i would make it again

awesome and easy!
like the other reviews said, it's easy to modify if you want to add or omit to your taste.
I like to leave out the mushrooms and add a bit of half and half

Easy dinner and loved by company. I cooked  a sprouted lentil variety and used angel hair for the pasta.

Chose because of lentils rather than beef; made as directed; didn’t have the flavor I’m accustomed to; will not make again.

I mixed the sauce with macaroni noodles. And added some  crushed red peppers and Parmesan cheese. It was very good.
