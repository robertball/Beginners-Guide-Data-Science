Fixing steel cut oats for breakfast before work takes up too much time for me. I found this recipe to be a very quick way to enjoy steel cut oats, plus it's very good. Even my picky eater enjoys this way of fixing steel cut oats.

This came together very quickly and  was perfect for a quick hearty breakfast I could easily reheat in the morning.  It seemed thin at first, but, as the oatmeal cooled it thickened perfectly.  I added a couple of tbsp. of brown sugar for a touch of sweetness.
