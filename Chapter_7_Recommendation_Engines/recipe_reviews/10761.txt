Don't say yuck until you've made these correctly.  This recipe requires shortening- 1/3 c as another reviewer noted.  And it must be shortening, not margarine or butter. Also the dough must be chilled for 2 hours (or more- I've made the dough 1 day in advance. I've made these since I was a kid and they are my sons' favorite Christmas cookie.  I watch these cookies in the oven- 10-12 minutes is usual depending on your oven-know your oven!  I do not frost the cookies, but will put colored sugar on some of them.  I agree that the dough is tricky- however, if you chill the dough and have a cold rolling pin and a cold surface (granite/ solid surface), the cookies come out fine- you may also want to roll the dough a little less than 1/4".  Do not add too much flour in the rolling process- that makes them hard, too.  If you want a more honey-lemony cookie, don't be afraid to increase the honey and/or lemon just a little bit.

Sorry....this recipe also calls for 1/3 Cup shortening.  They are great cookies, but very tricky dough.  You don't want it too moist or they stick...to dry and they get tough.  These are also easily burnt...if they brown at all, then you've waited too long to get them out of the oven.  Just slightly golden in color.  Rory

YUCK! Tasteless and didn't even help to put a sweet frosting on them. They were hard and tasteless. Very disappointed.

I made these, but my honey was crystallized, and it changed the entire recipe. The dough was very hard to work with. However, after I kicked myself for that, the flavor, was Very nice! Reminded me a cup of tea. I will try them again, with honey, that pours.

What a great sugar cookie recipe!  These cookies are SO incredibly soft and the amazing thing is that there is no butter, oil, or shortening in them!  I made these cookies three times over the holidays because they kept getting devoured-- even by my skeptical teenage brothers and husband.  They don't taste just like sugar cookies because of the lemony hint of flavor in them, but since they are a nonfat option, I will be making these INSTEAD of the traditional sugar cookies every time!  Since I don't have children old enough to eat sweets yet, when they can eat them, this is what they will come to know as "sugar cookies"!

*** Make sure you ice or frost these!  Very lackluster cookie when plain.

We make these every Christmas and they are a family favorite!  Be sure not to overbake them and they are soft & chewy.  I use Christmas shaped cutters and decorate them with a confectioner's glaze.  Mmmm!

Tharlow said really "lackluster" if not Iced.......I think the recipe was really REALLY tasteless and I feel as though the public needs to be warned. Mine came outta the oven and were hard and well, I'll stop there. Overall if you want something to dunk and dunk and dunk again in your tea or coffee- Make 'em otherwise step away from the recipe people just step away........

A nice cookie, but I'm going to futz with the ingredient amounts a little.  And you definitely need flour on hand to roll out the dough.  Also, in my oven, the directed temperature baked them *much* faster than 8-10 minutes.  In fact, to avoid them getting brown, as the recipe directions instruct, I had to take them out in only *5* minutes.  Maybe it was the thickness at which I cut the cookies, but I liked the height to which they poofed, so I'm going to use the same again. All in all, a pleasant cookie, good with coffee or tea, but a lot of work....

It's really good when brushed with butter before baking and drizzled with honey after.

a decent coffee cookie IF you add 1/2 cup butter (and even with the extra butter the cookie is still hard) and 1/2 brown sugar to tone down the honey flavor a little more. For personal taste I also added1 tsp more of lemon juice.

This was only 'okay' in my opinion.  I saw some reviews later suggesting other things to try.  Having those improvements in the actual recipe would be much more beneficial and would result in a better product.  These were not as good as I had hoped or expected  They were nice and soft though.

I  used 2 eggs because it's wasn't mixing  and used lemon juice from one entire lemon and didn't use baking soda. It stayed in the oven for about 8 min. They tasted really good and had a great texture.

I have been making these for years, since my boys were little, and they're in their forties now.  It's not Christmas without them.  I make the dough ahead, let it chill overnight, then cut and bake, and when cool frost with a butter, sugar and extract glaze, then
 use colored sprinkles or sugar. They store well and are good to ship to family.  Follow directions and you won't be disappointed.
