This makes a delicious gravy. Here's a suggestion, if you make a meat dish that you are not using the drippings from, save them in your freezer for later.  For example, when I make pulled pork in my crockpot, I save the juices from that for when I make a pork roast with gravy.

I usually fail at making gravy but this recipe worked and tasted amazing!  I would highly recommend it.  I think I only ended up using about 1 cup of the chicken stock but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I really enjoy this recipe,  only thing I added to this recipe was a little bit of dried parsley. Other then that its a fantastic gravy especially for beginners.

Thank you so much for posting your wonderful gravy recipe.  Used the drippings from the recipe Juicy Roasted Chicken also from this site.  The two together were so yummy.  Better than any restaurant.   Thank you again.

Worked great, but was a bit thin. I cooked it down and added a little corn starch in cold water and it tightened right up. I'd go for more roux for the amount of stock specified or reduce the amount of stock by 1/4.

Delicious. I didn't add the cream as it was perfect  the way it was, color, texture  and consistency.  No need for the extra calories.

I made a whole roast chicken yesterday and made gravy using this recipe. Absolutely amazing. From roasting 1 whole 4-5 lb chicken I was able to have just enough drippings for this recipe.

I used over a cup of drippings from roasted chicken thighs and added some milk because I didn't have stock on hand. It turned out delicious!

This is so good that I stored it under 'soups' and used a straw.  Not really, but...this is great with Chef John's pan roasted rosemary chicken, which I'm making tonight for the zillionth time. I just won't use lemon like in that recipe.

excellent recipe! I put onions and mushrooms in mine. But next time I think I'll just stick to the basic recipe because there was just too much stuff in it. Great flavor!

This is my go to gravy. It always comes out very good, and it is easy.
