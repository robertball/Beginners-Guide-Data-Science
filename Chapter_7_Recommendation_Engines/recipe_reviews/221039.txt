I was able to get ham "ends" at my local grocery deli--I just cubed up enough to make 1 1/2 cups. (I made a ham spread a couple years back that called for the ham ends and I think that gives your ham spread so much more flavor than you would normally get.) I used lowfat mayonnaise and dijon mustard. I do not keep celery salt on hand but I did have Beau Monde seasoning which is basically celery salt and onion powder. My family ate their ham spread on bread, I had mine spread on sliced cucumbers. This was quite good. I liked that it didn't have over kill of condiments that overpowered the ham spread and it wasn't runny which I really appreciated. Next time, I would add more onion and celery but that's really only to make it stretch a little farther. As is, it's fantastic!

This was so good. When I was a kid, deviled ham and cream cheese was my very favorite sandwich. The canned stuff is just awful, nutritionally so I made due with good memories. When I found this recipe, I knew I had to try it. I used fat free mayo, a very lean ham and left out the carway seed. I toosed it all into the food processor. I made a sandwich with this and fat free cream cheese... and it was wonderful!

My husband asked me to make a ham spread and I had no idea what it even was so I found this recipe and tried it. It turned out SO good. My husband said it was awesome. We put it on Ritz crackers. When I went back for more my husband told me not to eat all his ham spread. Looks like I'll have to make some more.

My first reaction was, wow this is salty, but it really is very good. I don't think I'd change anything, other than I don't use caraway seeds. It tastes just like the deviled ham in the can from when I was a kid. At least I know what is in this deviled ham! I made mine totally in the food processor. Threw everything in and pulsed to the minced consistency I wanted.

The only deviled ham I have ever had has come from a can...  Sad but true.  Compared to this, the canned stuff is pure garbage.  It was as if there was a party in my mouth and angels were singing...  I made a double batch it was so good!!!

Oh my this was good! I made a double batch, might need a bit more mayo and mustard bc it seemed a bit dry. Changed celery salt to celery seed and scaled it back a tad based on comments made by others in re the salt. Otherwise no changes, thanks for the awesome recipe, I'm keeping this as my permanent one for all time :)

This was really tasty. I used leftover ham from the holidays. My kids don't really like onions or celery pieces so I threw those in last and gave the food processor a couple of short bursts. They loved it on triskets. I thought the recipe was relatively healthy for a spread.

This very good. We both loved it. I used leftover ham. I omitted the celery salt because ham already has plenty of sodium in it. Instead I added 1/2 tsp. of dried celery for flavor. Also, as I was pureeing the ingredients, it seemed a bit dry, so I added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth. Probably won't be buying nearly as much ham spread at the deli counter any more.

I made 1/2 recipe of this for lunch today and I got about 2 servings. The flavor was fine, but boy was it salty! That came out to a 1/2 tsp of salts. I would make this again, but just do a small pinch of both. I followed the recipe exactly just omitting the caraway seeds, because I realized I didn't have them. I don't care much for them anyhow and I just chopped everything by hand. The salad will take on more of a yellow or orange color with the mustard and red seasonings.

I thought this was pretty good, but I felt it needed a little "je ne sais quoi". So I added a couple more shakes of Tabasco, a bit more mustard and a touch of prepared horseradish and catsup.  I included 1 tbsp of finely diced red onion as part of the 1/4 cup of onion.  Like other commenters, it is a bit salty, if you have the option to use celery seed instead of celery salt I would substitute it as the ham alone has plenty of salt.

Made this tonight. I had caraway seeds from my spice rack, but I'd never tried them before this recipe. I will skip them next time. Used my Ninja to chop it all up. Thought it was very good.

This is excellent exactly as made, directly out of the food processor..

and even better if left to chill in the refrigerator for an hour or so before serving.  I pulled it out, gave it a stir, set out some triscuits and it disappeared!  lol

I didn't have caraway seeds, so I left them out.  It was good. I will make it again and increase the hot sauce a wee bit, just to try it.

Just made a batch of this using leftover Christmas ham!  My husband pronounced it very tasty and better than the canned stuff.  The only changes I made were due to what I had on hand.  So I used scallions instead of onion and cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.  I omitted the caroway.  I also added a scant extra tablespoon of mayo.  Love that I can cut the fat using lean ham and lower fat mayo!  Will definitely be making more!

Wow!  Been looking for something after 3 days of ham sandwiches.  Perfect!!!  Read the salty comments and I'm a low salt person (wife is high salt) so I can see the celery salt being the tipping point for folks....  also leftover ham has a lot of salt anyway so I can see that being overlooked.  I altered by upping the paprika, adding horseradish, and using green onions (leftover) and subbed white pepper to give some warm slow heat.    All in all - great find and thanks for the share!  - Max

I followed this recipe exactly. When it was done, it was salty and had a taste and consistency that reminded me of pureed hot dogs.  I added more hot sauce... no help.  More black pepper... no help.  I know it wasn't the ham because I started off with some slices of fresh Honeybaked ham trimmed of all rind and fat.\ I'll keep it in the fridg for a while and see if it undergoes some miraculous taste transformation.

First round: food processed the ham, followed rest of directions: dry, added more mayo.  Very little texture, could have used more spice.  Try again!

I increased the amount of ham used by about 1 cup.
tasted a bit bland at first, so I added a teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce, some chopped dill pickles and a teaspoon of cayenne.

I made this like the original recipe call for (like I usually do). after I made it and tasted it I thought it was pretty good. The only issue we had was it was a little on the dry side so I added 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise and that was the trick. Next time I might try miracle whip instead and add a couple teaspoons of sweet relish. Thanks for posting.

I was missing too many ingredients to offer a reasonable review of the recipe.  From what I had I have to say I'm satisfied with the results.  I had a lot of ham left over and needed to find something to make with it.  I'm very satisfied with this recipe.  Thank you.

Didn't have celery salt, used 1/4 tsp of powder ingredients, a small pinch of Caraway seed. Blended in food processor. Taste like the $1.79 can but without the fat. Much fresher. I made 3 cans for$2. Salt to taste.

I used fresh garlic and added horseradish instead of hot sauce.  I believe if I hadn't had to substitute anything it would have been just as good.  I will definitely be making this again.

Updated to add:
I've made this several times now. I like a bit of sweetness in my ham spread so I put in miracle whip as well as mayonnaise. I put everything in my food processor and whir it all together. This has become my go to recipe for leftover ham.

Original review: I didn't have celery or caraway seeds so I omitted them. The spread still turned out really good and I think this will be my go to recipe for ham salad.

I skipped the caraway seeds and added a heaping tablespoon of pickle relish. Also used a combo of regular and smoked paprika.

What to do with leftover ham when you're tired of typical sandwiches?  This was the answer.  My husband and son loved it!  I didn't have any celery so had to leave that out, and I cut back on the salt because, well, it's ham and already salty enough.  This was great!

Ehh. 
Sorry, fresh out of caraway (for the last 30 years). 
Way dry! 
Had to use a huge handful of mayo. 
Maybe after I chill it the flavors will pop.

Mine came out a little too salty.... so next time I won't eliminate the celery.  I thought the spice blend was right on!

Was pretty much way to salty.  I even omitted using salt to keep it low sodium, and was using quality Black Forest Ham. Wife like it though, but it just didn't work for me. Not Good!

Followed the recipe exactly.  WONDERFUL.  My first attempt to make Deviled Ham, and I'll never buy the canned stuff again!  Thanks of a great recipe!

I used the sliced ham from Christmas dinner.  I didn't measure any of the quantities.  For seasoning I used celery salt , pepper and thyme to taste.  The thyme was a nice compliment to the sweetness of the ham.  This was a great after holiday lunch that we all enjoyed.
