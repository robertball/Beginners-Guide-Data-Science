I prefer my Chicken Livers cooked to "medium" instead of well-done. I reduced the cooking time to 11 minutes. YUMMY!!!

Ive used a duplicate-type of recipe so have marianted in Shoyu or soy sauce and a bit of water with fresh chopped water (after rinsing livers) Add sliced onions.... If anything remaining add a can of Cream of Mushroom soup and add livers bacon onion & even extra onions. Delicious the next day...and wonderful w/fried potatoes or mashed potatoes.

This was pretty good. Maybe I used too lean a bacon or something but the livers pretty well soaked up all the oil in no time flat forcing me to turn down the heat and cover for the last 10 minutes to prevent scorching. To deal with the minor dryness issue a little sour cream on top would go nice. I'll make this again.

This was fabulous. I excluded the bacon as I was looking for something more on the healthy side (and didn't think turkey bacon would cut it). Instead cooked sliced garlic and pearl onions in olive oil until they released the taste and used that to cook the livers. This was another fantastic option for chicken livers. It really really made a huge difference to use fresh organic livers instead of frozen. Adding a few to morning eggs can be a luscious option! Thanks for the great recipe.

This is just how Grandma used to make them....unfortunately I ate a piece with bile and it was bitter...I thought they were bad so before I ate another bite I threw them out...then found out what it was.. Oh well I will make them again and be very careful of making sure there are no gallbladder parts before cooking!!

Very good. Pretty rich you really can't eat more than a few. I'll cook the bacon a bit first next time.

Only average - definitely not the height of gourmet fare. I love chicken livers but there are far better recipes.

This was different. My family didn't like it so much but as we don't believe in wasting food we ate it. I've had fried chicken livers before and like them but cooking them w/ the addition of the bacon is different. I think it may help to add some garlic or onions like others suggest to heighten the flavor. Equally perhaps using less bacon would also make it taste better as the bacon adds a salty richness that overpowered the taste of the liver. Giving it 3 stars now but will try again with changes recommended and see what I think.

Tried this dish but just cooking with the bacon grease was not enough and I had to add more oil. Other than that it was pretty good.

Delicious! I saut√©ed some sliced onions and added them. I have prepared this recipe several times already.
