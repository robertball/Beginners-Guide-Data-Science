My mother made this by memory every Holiday my entire life - she is gone now and I've never actually seen this in print. What she did differently might be of some help  1. drain asparagus and save juice 2. mix asparagus juice w/ cream of mushroom soup 3. chop boiled eggs very finely and add to soup & juice 4. crush a sleeve of saltine or butter crackers and use as a "crust" 5. lay asparagus over crackers 6. pour soup & egg mixture over asparagus 7. top w/ cheese then bake. It looks pretty out of the oven, is awkward to serve, 
BUT always taste delicious!

I had forgotten how much I love asparagus!  This resipe was great.  I substituted stovetop for the crackers, just sprinkling them on, and cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom soup.  It tured out wonderful just the same.  Thank you for the recipe. :)

I have made this casserole twice now, and I think the flavors are very good.  The recipe as-is, however, is quite soupy at the end of baking.  I cut down the cream of mushroom soup to about 1 1/2 cans and it turns out to be perfect.

This has been a favorite in our family for years. However, we use a 9x13 casserole dish and enough hard boiled eggs to cover both layers of asparagus/cream of mushroom/shredded cheese. We also use Durkee fried onions instead of crackers. The top layer of fried onion is not put on until the last five minutes of cook time so they come out crunchy but not burned. The whole family loves this casserole!

I changed the recipe a tiny bit by steaming fresh asparagus instead of using the canned asparagus.  Overall, this is an awesome recipe and all the flavors just came together!

Only used 2 cans of asparagus  and a 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish.  Otherwise did not change anything.  Took to Dinner on the Grounds at church and everyone dug in.  Next time I may add a little cayenne pepper and black pepper.  Definitely will make again!!!

Great recipe!!!!  I left the boiled eggs out since my son does not like them and it was still excellent.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.  My husband said this was a keeper!

Asparagus is my favorite, but I have to agree with Stacey, expensive and not so good.

I first had this at a friends house and she said the recipe was on this sight.  Last Sunday was the second time for me to make this when I had guests for dinner and both times everyone wanted the recipe.  Asparagus is a vegetable that is often forgotten but this is really good for a change.  The asparagus are a little more expensive than other vegetables but it is well worth it.  I have found that asparagus tips seem to more tender.

Even better if you substitute cream of mushroom for cream of asparagus. Using the entire box of crackers and mixing them with cheddar cheese and a stick of butter to make a crust doesn't hurt either. Everyone loves it!

I did cream of chicken soup, fresh, raw asparagus, stove top, and we thought it could use some noodles.

I have to admit a couple things: 1. I should've known better. This recipe didn't sound good to me when I read it, just interesting, but when I read the reviews reminding other cooks of Grandma's cooking, well, I fell for it. 2. I didn't have Ritz crackers so I used saltines.  I did not care for this.

This was for just my husband and I.  I cut the recipe in half and used fresh steamed asparagus.  I used one egg and one egg white, to cut calories.  It turned out good.  BE SURE NOT TO ADD SALT, ritz or Townhouse crackers are usually ALREADY salted.

This was a very good, very easy and quick recipe. It was very filling and my family loved it. Very tasty and a new twist to canned asparagus. Highly recommended.

I love asparagus and this was great for when you can't get fresh asparagus.  Although the canned stuff is kind of expensive.

Yum!  I've made this recipe several times & am more pleased each time.  I followed the recipe exactly (the 2nd time anyway!).  The KEY to making sure it doesn't get mushy is to LAYER the ingredients as mentioned in the directions.  Stir the whole thing up & you're asking for mushy asparagus (believe me, I did that the first time!).  Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this was the most disgusting thing that I have ever made from allrecipes. I don't know if it is because I used fresh asparagus, or just becuase I am pregnant. My kids didn't care for it either. I'm sure that with all of the good reviews that I did something wrong.

This recipe was okay, but bland. Needs spices. It reminded me of that classic green bean recipe everybody makes. Ordinary. I used fresh asparagas and steamed it.

This is an awesome recipe! It's very tasty and unique. We've never had anything like it before. The hard boiled eggs were a nice touch which made it very creamy . Followed the directions exactly. Only change we made was scaling down the ingredients to make a smaller batch. We did 2 eggs, 2 cans asparagus, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup crackers, and then just sprinkled the cheese of top. Thanks for posting it! we'll be having this again :)

I served this with our Easter Dinner tonight and have to be fair with my rating. We had never had asparagus before so this was new to us. My youngest daughter and I didn't enjoy it one bit. But, my oldest daughter and my husband really enjoyed it. I'm giving this 4 stars because the recipe was a good one ~ it's just that 2 of us don't care for asparagus.

This recipe was delicious.  I had never eaten asparagus before and really didn't think I was going to like it but it was really good.  My family suggested that I make it for Easter since we are having grandparents and everyone for dinner.  This will definitely be added to my family's favorites!  Thanks for sharing this.

The best vegetable dish that I've served!  Everyone wanted seconds at my party and asked for the recipe.  Couldn't be easier.  No experience with kids and this recipe but the adults loved it. If any left, it's good reheated, too.  Maybe it's my oven, but needed more cooking time to bake.  A real winner...thanks for sharing.  Laurel Bean

The recipe called for canned asparagus, however, I used fresh and it was great. I will be using this recipe again.  Thank you Peggy.

Delicious!  I used fresh asparagus because it was in season, and precooked the asparagus in boiling water until tender. I made this with low fat ingredients, also ( cheese, crackers, and soup) and it was still great.  This is one of those recipes where the whole is better than the sum of the parts.

Not amazing, but it was good. Probably won't make it again with fresh roasted asparagus. I think it would have been better had I used canned.

This is one of my late mother-in-law's holiday staples. My kids still ask for it for holiday meals. It's not healthiest, but it is one of those ulitmate comfort foods that always has a place at the table.
