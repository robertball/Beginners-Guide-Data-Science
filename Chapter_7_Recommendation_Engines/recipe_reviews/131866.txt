This is a fairly standard chicken soup, a bit heavy on the onion.  It didn't thicken up much for us.  We prefer dishes with a lot of spices and flavors, so we probably won't make this again.

I absolutely loved this recipe. It made the loveliest soup which I intend to add to my compilation of 'go to' winners!

This thick soup is very similar to Colombian Ajiaco  except for the Guascas. I did tinker a bit to tailor the flavor a bit but, basically stated with the basic ingredients. My Colombian and Mexican friends really liked it. I did use about a half pound of lean, chopped bacon to sweat the onions. Gave it a great background flavor.
