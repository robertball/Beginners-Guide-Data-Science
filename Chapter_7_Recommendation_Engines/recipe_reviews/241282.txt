Slow Cooker Red Beans & Rice Soup Haiku: "Really needs more rice. Quarter cup not quite enough. Needs bell peppers too." Only changes that I made were to put it on low for 7ish hrs., and browning the sausage w/ the onion and celery 1st (and some chopped bell pepper too) as we like our smoked sausage a little "charred." Found that 1/4 cup of rice wasn't nearly enough to even warrant calling this "...and Rice Soup." The taste was fantastic though, but truthfully, I would rather just reduce the water, increase the rice and make this traditional red beans & rice and not have it soupy at all.

This was really delicious!  I added a yellow pepper and a half cup of brown rice rather than 1/4.  Also I cooked it on low for about 8 hours.  Came out much better than I expected.  I am always disappointed by my attempts at low fat, healthy meals so this one made me happy!  Will definitely make it again.

I did a few changes; used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, a fresh garlic clove diced and a 1/2 teaspoon of low sodium salt, a second can of beans (I'm a bean eater) and 1/3 a cup of rice. It turned out really good. I think next time I make it I'll add some mushrooms.

It had wonderful taste, but there was not enough rice and one hour on low did not cook it long enough.  I would use more rice next time and add it sooner or make rice on the side.

I didn't make it in a slow cooker.   But, it turned out great! The mahjung players loved it.

This was really delicious and satisfying. I added some jalapeno peppers to it, just to give it a little more kick.

I added 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 bell pepper, increased the cajun seasoning to 1 1/2 teaspoons, and increased the rice to 3/4 cup. I also added 4 shakes of Tabasco sauce. I would make this again as it was a good recipe, but my rice got soggy. I'd make the rice separately and put in bowls then add the red beans and rice on top. (I used regular long grain rice, not a minute or quick cook rice.).

Not a big fan of this one.  I found it rather bland. Will not make again.

It's a very Plain Jane sort of recipe that allows for plenty of additions for something southern and soul food-esque.  On the first try out I decided on making it a fusion of Northern and Southern Cuisine adding 1/4 cup more rice, as well as Summer Squash (Yellow Squash), Zucchini, a little Dill (to offset the Cajun Spices).
