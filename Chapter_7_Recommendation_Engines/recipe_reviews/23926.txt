Being a Texan myself, I am very picky about my BBQ, especially brisket.  In fact, although I am a caterer and consider myself a very good cook; I was always fearful to attempt brisket.  I have to say I took a risk and tried this recipe for my first attempt and it was AMAZING.  My husband (a BBQ lover) raved and told me to laminate this recipe!!  This brisket was so tender,easy and delicious.  I even made it again in the same week for my extended family who now requests it at most family funtions.  I am taking the idea of offering this to my catering customers into deep consideration as well.  Thanks for the great recipe....it is definately a winner!!

Are there 10 stars? This is one recipe that rates a "10" !!  The only change I made
was using an injectable marinade (garlic & herb).  I used a cup and let the brisket
marinate while I started the fire.  The meat was very flavorful and "fork-tender".
Definately one for your barbeque book !!!

Two hours in a smoker does not give enough smoke flavor - I followed the recipe but I still don't understand that if you have a smoker why finish in the oven?  This may be a brisket but not a "smoked" brisket...

This is definitely a recipe for garlic lovers!  I love garlic, and I thought it was just on the brink of too much - but not quite!  Like all good brisket, it takes awhile, but you sure feel official when you taste it.  Even good the next day chopped with bbq sauce on a hamburger bun!

followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. All the garlic is scary, but it was not overpowering at all. We took ours out before serving. After the brisket came out of the foil,saved the juice. The next day sliced it up thin and heated the juice and layed the meat in it before making sandwiches. Yummy. Was very happy with how tender the meat came out. Excellent recipe to try for the beginner as this was our first ever.

I have made this many times and it is always wonderful.  I use a gas grill with wood chips and have caught the whole thing on fire a few times.  It actually turns out just as good or better.  I also use salt free greek seasoning and season all so I can control the amount of salt a little better.  Again this is awesome and I make it as often as I can.

This was excellent! We live in Texas and just got a nice grill and we were determined to conquer what Weber calls the Mt. Everest of Grilling -Brisket!! This was our second attempt and it was perfect!!  Although we did make modifications - for a 5lb piece of meat we smoked for 2hrs and baked for 2hrs. We did most of the oven time at 275, except for the last 30 mins we did at 300.  Also we didn't have greek seasoning so we used 2 tablespoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried rosemary 1 tablespoon dried onion 2 teaspoons granulated garlic 1 teaspoon dried lemon peel  1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon kosher salt  And we used 2 cloves of garlic per pound, being sure to squash it release flavors.   We plan on making this for my kids birthday party - easy way to feed a ton of people.   Oh-one more thing -we got the meat from a butcher and not the grocer -it was a much better piece of meat.

As a Texan and living in South Texas, I've cooked and eaten my share of brisket.  When I "smoke" a brisket I use about Â½-1 tsp (depends on size of brisket) of Liquid Smoke and this time I took Heloise's advice and used the Greek seasonings rather than a mix that I usually use.  Excellent!  I double wrap it and put it in a 200 degree oven all night.  The first couple times I got up 2 or 3 times to make sure it was okay ... now I just sleep through the night, dreaming about BBQ dinner the next day.  The liquid smoke may not fool anyone at a brisket cook-off but it's pretty close to perfect.  Thanks for the changes, Helo!

If only there were more stars for this recipe! HUGE HIT among family and friends. After making the first, I made three of these for a family reunion... Needless to say, all 60 family members were in awe. Great recipe! Try marinating the brisket in a can of Root Beer and Ginger Ale over night. The taste is phenominal. Thanks David

Just finished this recipe and it is great.  I used apple hardwood instead of mesquite and smoked on my Holland Grill on high for one hour and low one hour prior to the oven.  Follow this recipe and you will have a brisket that falls apart.  Best ever and I have had a bunch of it.

This turned out a great smoked brisket. My husband didn't use charcoal too, he just used mesquite wood and we smoked it for 2 hrs and then into the oven for another hour. I only had a 3.5 lb brisket so we cut the time in the oven down, because I was afraid of getting a dried up piece of beef jerky, instead it turned out very juicy and moist and was only a little tough still. It would have been fine I think if I had left it in the oven the entire time indicated even though it was half the size. Thanks for a great brisket! I used minced garlic instead of cloves since it is what I had. It worked fine.

I cooked the brisket as recommended.  I really wanted this recipe to work out. My brisket weighed 4.6  pounds . After 4 hours, the meat was not tender.  I will add more seasonings the next time. I might slather the brisket with mustard. The Greek Seasoning I used didn't have salt, so I would add Kosher salt and pepper.  SAVED this recipe by placing the sliced brisket in the oven at 325 degrees for 3 -4 more hours. I used  1 sliced green pepper, and a  sliced medium onion. I poured 5 cups of beef broth over the meat. I cooked the meat until the meat fell apart.

I made this for a party at my house and it everyone loved it, I pressed the garlic and added alittle salt and pepper and injected it into the meat with the greek seasoning rubbed on and I had a 16 pound brisket. I cooked it on an electric smoker for 13 hours though with the last 4 being wrapped in foil. It was awesome, fell right apart and was a huge hit.

My whole family loved this!  It was delicious.  I only had crushed garlic and filled slices with that.  I also couldn't find the greek seasoning and used spike seasoning.  It was truly delicious!  Definitely going into the rotation!  Thanks for sharing!
