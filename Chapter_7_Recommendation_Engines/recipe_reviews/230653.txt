I made these with spelt flour instead of whole wheat and honey instead of sugar.  Great inspiration for light, fluffy biscuits!  The dough was rising as I spooned these onto the parchment paper for baking!  Delightful flavor and consistency!

These are pretty darn tasty little biscuits. My kids liked them. I used coconut oil, as that is what I had on hand and it gave it a nice flavor. I think I added more applesauce the second time I made them and they turned out a little more moist. Overall, this was a hit at my house. Family enjoyed them and they were super easy to make. Thank you for the recipe.

I took the advice of past reviewer and used all honey as sub for sugar. I also used canola oil. They turned out sweet and delicious!

I cut it down to 4 servings and like others did half sugar half honey and canola oil over peanut.   The dough was pretty dry so I added a tad more honey to get it going.   Worked fine and got 4 decent sized tasty biscuits :)

They are good, but not what I was hoping for. You can't really taste the applesauce. Maybe a little more applesauce and use honey instead of sugar.

Delightful vegan biscuits! I used olive oil, although I think that coconut oil could give it a nice flavour and might make the recipe a tad more together. I did a half and half of sugar and honey, but I think I'll try all honey later, as I'm trying to cut out refined sugars. Overall, bravo! Loved it!

flavor was pretty good.  They are a bit dense, I would assume because of the whole wheat flour.  Overall not too bad though.

I was skeptical, but these were delicious!! Only had cinnamon applesauce on hand, but it just gave them a little extra character. :-)

I made these exactly like recipe. Ended up with  34 good size biscuits! That's ok though because they were so good  we didn't mind eating  them the next day at breakfast  and dinner. I'm making  them  again today.

These turned out very yummy. Like some of the other reviewer’s I substituted honey for sugar only because that’s my preference. For my kids, I think having them a little sweeter would’ve been better so I might try a little more honey next time and maybe a little more applesauce. These were so easy to make! Thank you for the great recipe!

These turned out great, everyone liked them.  14 minutes was the perfect baking time.  Only thing I need to change is the  salt.  They were very salty. Other than that there were no problems.
