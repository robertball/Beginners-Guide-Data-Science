I have been looking for a great alternative for flour pancakes and these are yummy! Most gluten free pancakes I've tried are fragile and these hold up well when flipping. They are  super dense so they fill you up easily.

These are great pancakes.  I know the recipe creator Elana Amsterdam (I have her cookbooks) recommends NOT using Bob's Red Mill Almond flour because they are not as fine as what she used to test her recipes with.  Before I knew that, I was using Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour and was getting really grainy oily outcome from her recipes.  I recommend switching to something else.

I actually really liked these.  I used almond meal instead of almond flour (that's all we had).  they burn very easily, so keep the heat low!  also, we added unsweetened coconut and dried cranberries to the batter to make it textured.  yum!

Very good, very filling pancakes. My kids loved them and I liked that they were getting protein and a filling breakfast.  I liked the fact that this recipe was a true almond pancake (no all-purpose flour filler).  We aren't gluten-free, but prefer these pancakes over the regular ones.  I add a little almond milk (maybe a couple of tablespoons) to make the dough less thick and my kids like them with sliced bananas or fruit added into the batter.  They do burn quickly so I learned to always cook them patiently on low!

Overall, they were pretty good.  My kids ate some, but my oldest didn't have seconds.  They are more dense than white flour pancakes, but similar to buckwheat.  I liked that I had all of the ingredients on hand and that the recipe is gluten free, sugar free, and dairy free.  I recommend letting the batter rest for about 10 minutes so they rise better.  I was worried about using a whole tablespoon of vanilla, but it was not overpowering.  I made them a little bit bigger than silver dollar sized, but would recommend keeping them smaller.  Also, they get dark quickly, so I turned down the heat and flipped the pancakes as soon as the bubbles popped.  I used blue agave nectar as my syrup on top, which was yummy.

I recently discovered that I shouldn't eat wheat and I've been following a paleo diet, so these were a nice treat. I added some cinnamon and blueberries. I thought they were a little heavy. Also a little dry, like they could have benefitted from having a little butter or oil added to the batter. A little trick for oiling the griddle or skillet: dip a paper towel in the oil and then lightly swipe the skillet.

These were very good. I did use honey instead of agave but that was because I didn't have agave. I also used almond meal instead of flour. The texture came out great. Also, I advise that you don't heat your griddle no more than 250*. They burn easily. My first batch came out a bit black. They are good with jelly and syrup. I will make these again!

I made these for my son, who is allergic to wheat, milk, and eggs (among other things).  I substituted chia gel (3 Tbs chia seed soaked in 3/4 cup water) for the eggs, used powdered raw vanilla, and subbed real maple syrup for the agave, as I don't believe agave nectar is healthy.  The batter was always too thick to bubble, but I cooked them on low and watched closely and they did not burn.  Next time I would try only 2 tbsp chia seed (but keep the liquid the same).  My son enjoyed them so much he had three servings and asked for more.  They are sweet enough that he didn't even think to ask for syrup until his third serving.  The rest of us liked them as well.  Thanks for the recipe!  ** okay, I came back and made these again, this time exactly as the recipe was written (using eggs, but I did still sub maple for the agave).  I thought they tasted quite eggy plain and preferred them topped with organic chocolate hazlenut spread and maple syrup.  I also tried coconut butter, homemade strawberry syrup and homemade apple cider syrup on them, but those weren't as big of a hit with my family.  I actually think I preferred the chia seed version, but my children loved these with eggs as well.

I decided to try these after trying a more traditional paleo pancake that was a much thinner batter.  As it turns out, these thick pancakes were hard to swallow.  So dry.  I prefer the thinner ones.  Perhaps thinning them down with some water or coconut milk would be more pleasing.

Very tasty. The batter is quite thick, so you should spread it out as much as you can in the pan. They brown quickly if using Pam, so keep a close eye on them.

i have tried 4-5 gluten free pancake recipe and while they were all ok as long as you put enough syrup on, I really loved the taste of these pancakes. I also liked the fact that they really fluffled up and keeping them smaller assured that they didnt break appart. I used maple syrup instead of agave. This is going in my recipe book and i will keep on making them. thx!!

I have tried many almond flour pancake recipes but this one is it! The pancakes actually stay together and don't fall apart, and the nectar gives them a little sweetness so you don't have to coat them in anything. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I added a tiny bit of honey on top. My whole family, including my 18 month old, loved them.

These are really good, especially with fruit. I used honey in stead of agave nectar, and left out the vanilla (my nursing daughter can't tolerate it). I also used a lot less salt as several others said. They are delicious!

We made these as waffles.  My Family liked these...I thought they were quite dry.  But, if you're eating paleo and are dying for a waffle, it's an option.

I have tried other almond flour pancakes before and this recipe definitely is far superior - in terms of taste and "flippability". I grind my own almond meal/flour from slivered almonds (I find that it is cheaper that way) and like that it has some texture in the pancakes. This is a great almond pancake recipe and I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

I just made these. The only change was I did let the batter sit for ten minutes as I believe someone else commented on. These are not bad. A bit dry. The next time I make these I will add a very ripe banana to the batter to moisten it up. I used butter in the skillet for cooking so that added some good flavor. Overall I'm pretty impressed with a non flour pancake. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was good for gluten free cooking, however I had to tweak it a little. The batter in its original state was very thick, so I added 1/4 cup of Almond Milk and the consistency was great. I also added a tbsp of brown sugar and 1/4 cup fresh blueberries because the batter lacked flavor.  I added an additional tsp of baking soda so they would rise. (I've been baking and cooking with almond flour for 6 years now, just lessons learned over the years) The final product came out great. I used blueberry agave to top each pancake for my family and fresh fruit and whip cream for me. They came out delicious. Will experiment with this recipe again. Thanks for sharing

I'm always scared to try a new GF dish but these were outstanding.  I added a few tablespoons of coconut milk to thin the batter a little and honey instead of agave since I didn't have any on hand.  I kept them small and cooked on low heat as others recommended.  Definitely a keeper!

I would eat these they taste great.  Not like regular pancakes though if that's what you're after.  My 2 year old ate them and he's extremely picky - that's why I'm giving them 5 stars!

I'm on a gluten free, low carb diet.  These pancakes were delicious.  I ate them with sugar free syrup and butter.  With this recipe I won't miss regular pancakes at all.  I look forward to playing with some variations like adding unsweetened coconut, adding peanut butter, adding nuts, etc.
