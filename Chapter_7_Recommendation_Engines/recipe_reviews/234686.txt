This was absolutely 5star delicious! I actually used 3 cans canned clams versus clam juice...poured it into a small pot and steamed the salmon atop it all. It was perfect! Thanks for this amazing recipe!

mixed in  other fishes in small amounts cod, whitefish, salmon and shrimp  this tasted fantastic and I am not a fish person but anything will go in this sauce did not have shallots or leeks but was good anyhow. not crazy about the puff pastry shell so I am going to try regular pastry next time but it was great

I substituted scallops for the shrimp.  My family loved it, definitely will make again.
