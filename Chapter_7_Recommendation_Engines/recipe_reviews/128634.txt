I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone raved about it. I did not have the Bob Evans sage sausage on hadn, so I used a pound of hot sausage I had and the results were very good. This is probably because the stuffing I used was seasoned with sage. I used the shredded stuffing, not the cubes, and I think this made the dish better. I did not have a turkey to stuff (we had a turkey breast), so I just made this in a glass casserole dish. I even made it the day ahead and stored it in the frig until it was time to bake it. A very good and easy recipe, it will be a family favorite of ours for several years!

We had this for Christmas last year, and I'm pulling it out again for Thanksgiving. I love the contrast of the sausage and cranberries. I usually make this the night before, then just pop it in the oven.

This recipie is relatively basic but went from good to amazing with day old Italian bread with the chopped onions & celery..then added sage etc. Pre-packaged bread stuffing simply can't beat the real stuff. I also moistened the stuffing with some white wine..you can also use chicken stock or orange juice, then frozen and or fresh cranberries. The Evans sausage is wonderful and a keeper. I also threw in a couple of chopped apples...ahhh wonderful!!!

OK Folks. I made this last year but substituted 1 can of chicken broth with 1.5 cups white wine and used a roll of Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage. Followed everything else as directed. WAS THE BEST STUFFING MY FAMILY AND I EVER HAD!! We all loved it!

this was awesome i used it with a pork roast and served it on the side. i am not a big fan of cranberry's but it tasted better then i anticipated. everyone loved it and that was from 20 people since it was for my brothers going away party. thanks this is a definate. in stead of the stuffing ina  box, i made a corn bread stuffing (better for my son to eat since he can't have milk, so made the corn bread with rice milk instead. no one knew it was made with rice milk.

Easy recipe.  I substituted vegetarian sausage crumbles, and they were good.  The cranberries were the highlight of the dish.

This was awesome! I made this Last year and I am making it a new tradition. This is a great way to make a kindof plain side dish great. We ate this as a main coarse with the leftovers too! Thanks for sharing it. I'm surprised it has not had a whole lot more reveiws.

I think making was the last time for stuffing. I've always been a stuffing gal, even going as far to stuff the bird, remove and re-bake to kill bacteria for the taste, but I found that I really didn't like this. I wished I had done a really nice wild rice mix for christmas instead.

i just made this for the first time to stuff our thanksgiving turkey. i didn't have bob evans sage sausage, so i used regular and added poultry seasoning and sage--maybe a tablespoon of each. i stuffed the bird(20 lb) and had a whole pan of leftover stuffing which i held in the fridge. when the turkey was done and i was ready to put the pan of stuffing in the oven, i had to add 2 more cups of broth--the stuffing had soaked it all up. everyone loved the sausage/cranberry taste. i will definitely make this again!

This was awesome! I pulled some turkey out of the bird in the oven before it was done and used that instead of sausage! I also used some turkey juices in place of chix broth. Oh my heck, yummy!

I LOVED this ~ It was a great shortcut for stuffing/dressing.  (I served a pre-bought, fried turkey from a local restaurant) I really like incorporating the dried cranberries in it as well.  Some family members didn't care for it as much as I did, but I WILL be making this again :)

Made this for thanksgiving this year.  Was a HUGE hit!  My family never finishes stuffing, even my Mom's, who's recipes was similar to this.  She past away and never wrote her recipe down, this seemed closest so I thought I'd try it...It's a keeper!  Sorry Mom!  I did add some freshly diced sage and rosemary, even though I had the sage sausage ( not Bob evans but Johnsonville ) and I diced and mixed all ingredients except the stuffing mix and broth, the night before, then mixed in the stuffing ( country style Pepperidge farm stuffing mix ) just before baking.  Also, I diced the dried cranberries, they seemed a tad too big and my kids would not have eaten this if they saw them in there!  Guess I'm on stuffing duty from now on!

This was wonderful.  1/2 batch was plenty for 4 people.  I made only 2 slight changes which was to add (to 1/2 batch) 1/3 cup dried cranberries/pecans mix and 1 pkg of the seasoned stuffing that was 8 ounces. I cooked it an hour and then removed the top to get it a bit crunchy on top (another 20 min or so). Was WONDERFUL with the slight sweetness from the fruit and the crunch from the nuts.  Is definitely on my "go to list" for stuffing.  Simple and delicious!

Made this for our holiday dinner. My husband loved this and I thought it was just good but not great. I felt like there were too many cranberries myself. Overall not a bad stuffing but not a 5 star recipe.

I like my stuffing on the dryer side.  I was only going to add one can of broth...but then I decided just to follow the recipe.  It's good, but I think I should have gone with just one can of broth. I will try it that way next time.

Best stuffing I have ever made, love it! I used to always make the boxed Stovetop stuffing and I could never go back again.  Unless your vegetarian add the sausage, it really makes the dish.  I have tried it with turkey sausage as well as pork sausage and both are great though I prefer the turkey.

This stuffing was AWESOME!  I made my first Thanksgiving meal last week and I used this recipe for the stuffing.  I loved the cranberries.  This was better than my mother's (but don't tell her!).  The only change I made was I added some roasted chestnuts.  Thank you so much!  I think I'm going to the store to buy up all the cranberries so I can make it all year round!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving, and many other times.  My family loves it.  We also love to have the leftovers from breakfast and add a poached egg on top.  It is delicious!!!

love this receipe. I added some chopped apples and reduced the chicken stock slightly for a more firm stuffing. Would highly recommend it!!!!
