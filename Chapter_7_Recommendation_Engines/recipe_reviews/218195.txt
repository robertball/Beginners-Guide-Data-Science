I made this whole recipe in my cast iron skillet which was great because it could go from stove to oven lickety-split. I did cut back on the frozen hashbrowns just a touch only because I had just under a cup and a half left in the bag. I did not have the specific cheese that the recipe asked for--I used pepper jack. The salsa I used was homemade and I also used reduced fat sour cream. Boy, was this good--both my kids and I thought this was VERY tasty. Both my sons asked for seconds! I would like to make this again but I think I would cut back both the cheese and the sour cream for next time and see if I can't throw in some fresh chopped vegetables. As is, quite good!

I was really surprised by how good this was.  We had to make some minor changes.  We subbed 4 whole eggs for the 8 egg whites, used whatever cheese was around, and par-cooked diced potatoes since there were no hash browns in the house.  Everyone (even the picky kid and picky adult) loved it.    Definitely keep the chorizo- I think that's what gave it so much flavor.

I made this for Christmas morning and it was really good. I had never had chorizo before but I wanted to try something new. I bought liquid egg whites instead of using 8 egg whites. It was good as a left over as well.

Very good! light, flavorful! I am queen of substitutions so I altered the recipe a bit. I used ham loaf instead of chorizo - that's what I had on hand. I didn't have the cheese or green chilies so I used a can of Campbell's fiesta cheese soup. I used a total of 8 whole eggs instead of the egg whites.

This little gem has been in my recipe box for at least five years. After looking in my fridge at some chorizo that I needed to use up, I figured this recipe would be perfect. I halved the recipe (since it's just the two of us), I used a regular Mexican blend cheese, and chopped up jarred jalapenos instead of the canned chiles. The end result was fabulous; I have a happy tummy and M is now in a food coma, sleeping on the couch. Before closing his eyes, he said "That's a keeper." And it will be. Great recipe!

I have made this many, many times! It is such a wonderful recipe and soooo good. As I have done it so many times, of course it has my own touch and thought I would share. But I do not want to take away from the originality of this recipe!
I fry my own potatoes. And I throw the cream cheese right into the eggs and pour together. And I cook up a little breakfast sausage with the chorizo. And I add salt and pepper to the eggs also, sometimes a little cumin! And I always cook it in my cast iron skillet! Fantastic!!!

This was ok growing up my mom would make chorizo with nopales and eggs and her simple dish was so much flavorful then this one. All the cheese and  is not called for when making chorizo they are fillers. Seeing all these recipes makes me want to start my own cooking website. I have had coworkers ask me if I would sell my left overs..and ppl have paid me to cook for their parties and I am not a chef or run a catering business. I just love to cook and use fresh,local ingredients. Try longanesa instead of chorizo it will blow your mind.same flavor but its more meaty.

Good, easy, fast recipe! I used regular hash browns, cheddar cheese, and subbed ricotta cheese for sour cream because that's what I had on hand, still yummy. mir

this was not good at all. could hardly even taste the chorizo, the potatoes were mushy, and the cheese mixed too much and did not taste good like a regular omelet. it was a mushy mess.

Came out pretty good, although I did add 5 more minutes to the backing time, as the dish appeared slightly "wet" still after the initial cooking time listed in the recipe.
Doing it again, I'd add a splash of salt to the eggs while wisking them, as the end product definitely needed it.  I'd also pre-cook the potatoes just a little, before putting them in the pan to mix in and cook with the chorizo & onions.

I made this exactly as stated, loved it and so did my family. I loved that the eggs were the binder and that you could taste everything. A melody of flavors, yummy.

I am a very picky eater and since stomach surgery years ago things just don't taste right anymore.  So when I say something tastes good it must really taste good.   I reduce the serving from 8 to 6 even though I am only cooking for two.  I don't have the right size skillet for just two servings.  I usually end up freezing left overs which makes for easy dinners etc later on.  Anyway.  I made this with all the right ingredients and I love it!

I made this for a family party. it was a hit. I made it exactly as the recipe except used soy chorizo (which tastes the same, in my opinion). I will definitely make this again.

Very yummy breakfast 'omelet'. My wife and I have added this one to our regular list now. The only thing I had to do differently (which shouldn't make too much of a difference) is I had to use regular hash browns instead of southern style as I didn't have the southern ones in my freezer. Other than that it turned out quite tasty.
