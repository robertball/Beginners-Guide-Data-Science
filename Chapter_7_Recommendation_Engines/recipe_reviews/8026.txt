I made this fruitcake for my dad. He loves fruitcake and hadn't had one in years, due to his diabetes. I left out the coconut, because he doesn't like it. He absolutely LOVED this cake! He is the type of person who never asks for anything for himself - but he's already put in his request for more of this fruitcake!

This was really, really good. Made for my diabetic dad for Father's Day.  Make sure you use canned crushed pineapple in juice-- and include the juice with the measurements. I actually added a little extra as well. I used craisins instead of fresh cranberries and used half whole wheat flour. Very tasty and flavorful. This is a great recipe.

Wow, I am so pleasantly surprised how great this tastes!  I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of mace and then used a whole 20oz crushed pineapple. Followed the rest of the ingredients on the recipe.  I did bake it for an extra 15 min for a total of 55 and my picky husband said it was one of the best fruitcakes he's ever had!  Thank you, thank you since I've been searching for a great recipe for Fruitcake.

Very good.  Dense and delicious, plenty sweet just as written.  Thanks!     I didn't soak the berries for an hour, just as I prepped the other ingredients and that worked just fine.  Like others, I had to bake mine for longer, but that is to be expected as oven temps vary and it is quite moist.

My husband is a diabetic and this was a wonderful treat for him, since he always missed fruitcake.  I was unsure how this would turn out, but it is amazing!  I couldn't find a single change that would improve this recipe.   This recipe is a new Christmas keepsake.

I'm not a fruitcake eater, but my mother is and she loves this!  Se said it rials Klaxton's (sp?) fruitcake.  I've made this for my grandmother who is diabetic but loves fruitcake.  The only thing I did differently was I used only 1 up of choppe walnuts.  Very moist and smells terrific!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this as a healthy recipe for a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it quite a bit. However the first time I made it, it came out slightly dry so I doubled the amount of pineapple the second time and reduced mace to at least half. Also, I used whole wheat flour and my little cousin who is a year old had a blast eating it!

The whole time I was making this I was thinking that it wouldn't taste sweet & that it wouldn't stay together, but it is sweet & it stayed together nicely.  Tastes good! Kind of a lot of work but, quite yummy.  I made 4 small loaves instead of one large one & reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes.  I think they could've used 5 more mins or so...but quite tasty!  Wonder how these would do shaped into bars like granola bars?

This was a hit at Christmas.  the only difference I had from the original recipe was the baking time.  I had to bake my cake for 50-55 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love fruitcake and my husband and I are on diets.  So when I saw this recipe I was excited.  It is not the FAT kind but its a good substitute.

Came out delicious! I'm always looking for a healthy alternative to dessert and this was fantastic. Plus it's completely vegetarian friendly. I used just what I had available in the house. I substituted California raisins for the cranberries, used splenda packets, and left out the coconut flakes. So delicious and guilt free.

Very nice flavor and very moist. Next time I will chop the nuts and fruits smaller, mine was too chunky.

These waffles were very tasty.  I baked them in my Belgian waffle iron.  The dough is very airy and suites that type of iron well.

You can't call it sugarless because all the fruit and orange juice is loaded with sugar

It was too mushy for my families taste buds.  I can't imagine using a 20 oz can of pineapple in this as one reviewer did, I used a 15 oz and it was way to much liquid! I didn’t like the "mushy" consistency and you really couldn’t cut it in nice slices.  I had to spoon it. It was not a nice presentation. I guess if you are diabetic, it would give you a taste of fruitcake if you like fruitcake but if you are not diabetic, it is terrible, both in taste and presentation. Not a keeper for me.
