This is a great cake!!!!!
I make it without the coconut as most of my family does not like it - I love coconut and would probably eat the whole cake if I made it with coconut.
I use 1 pint of cream, whipped, to frost the cake - its a favorite here!

This was a good cake.  The whipped cream
(1 cup)was not enough for the whole cake,
just middle and top.
Also, I baked it for only 25 minutes
at the specified temperature and it was
done.  The coconut on top of the cakes 
would have burnt if I left them in 
longer.

Nothing spectacular - just a cake.  Won't make again.
