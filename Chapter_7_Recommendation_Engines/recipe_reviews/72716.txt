Great way to have fruit in the morning -- even my husband loved it! A squeeze of lemon juice over the fruit when they're first cut keeps them from browning (if the salad is going to be saved for more than a few hours) and adds a nice tang to the salad. Wonderful recipe!

So good and so healthy! :)  The different textures are wonderful!  I would advise not letting sit for very long before serving, as it looks the best just mixed.

Very good basic recipe that you can easily adjust. Due to allergies, and my personal dislike of bananas, I used blueberries and strawberries. Again because of allergies, I used granola in lieu of the walnuts. Yum Bridestein and thanks for a great lunch today!

Perfect for breakfast - I cut the recipe in half and just love the crunch from the walnuts!

We loved this! I've not used cinnamon as a spice in fruit salad before and it was aromatic and scrumptious. I used fresh pineapple, red grapes, and bananas and added some lemon juice and a little brown sugar.

I thought this was awesome.  i made mine with blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, apples, bananas, and walnuts.  i would definitely make this again.  i love the idea of granola in it too.  The only thing i would do different is cutting up the fruit the day of the brunch and not the day before.  the fruits did get a bit soft overnight and by the next night there was a good bit of liquid at the bottom of the bowl.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I used it several times for company parties and it was a hit every time.  I did use a different types of fruits, like honeydew and canteloupe and it worked just as wonderful.  Thank you.  I will definitely use over and over again!

I really liked this fruit salad. It was yummy, light and tasty.  I used Nancy's fat free vanilla yogurt.  Wasn't organic, but they do have an organic line.  Nancy's is a lot less sweet than other yogurts and I love it.  My store didn't have strawberries, so I used black grapes (left whole) and they were perfect in here.  I don't love bananas but I loved them in this.  I sprinkled the walnuts on top of the salad, and used about half of what is listed.  The cinnamon was a great touch!  I took this over to a friend's house for dinner and they liked it too.

Simple and very good.  Easy to adjust for fruits that are in season and personal likes/dislikes.  I did not use organic yogurt and it turned out great.

Tasty morning treat!  The vanilla yogurt is a perfect companion for the fruits.  We always love the mixture of strawberries, bananas, and apples, so this was perfect for us.  I forgot the walnuts, but it was still delicious.  Made this to go with a coffee cake and the combination made for a wonderful breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband LOVED this fruit salad - especially the organic vanilla yogurt, which I never would have considered.  Thank you so much!  I will be making this recipe every week this summer.

This was really good.  Why hadn't I thought of it myself?? It was fresh and delicious.  I added granola instead of walnuts, as another reviewer suggested.  It was more kid friendly that way.  Yummy!!

Absolutely wonderful. The cinnamon made it irresistible I served this in individual dishes at a semi-formal dinner. It looked beautiful and tasted even better. I ended up using 1/2 strawberry and 1/2 vanilla yogurt. Everyone loved it. My husband had me make another batch the next day.

I made 1/2 recipe to try this. I found I like fruit with just a tad of yogurt mixed in to not mask it. This was just a few too many textures in one. The apple texture really didn't work for me either. The walnuts gave it a nice contrasting flavor. I also thought the cinnamon definitely improved it flavor wise. I made it for a lunch, and I am sure it will all get eaten, just not a repeat fruit salad recipe.

This recipe is delicious and versatile. I used apples, bananas and walnuts, but I only had plain yogurt, so I used that with a few drops of vanilla extract. Add the cinnamon and voila -- a quick, easy, delicious, nutritious breakfast.

This is definitely a solid yet basic fruit salad recipe.  None of my guests seemed to be really in love with it or anything, but I personally loved the unexpected addition of a little cinnamon.  The only thing that I might do differently next time is to up the cinnamon just a wee bit.  Of course, I'm a cinnamon fanatic so take that into consideration before doing the same.

Made this for my Mom's Birthday breakfast. I used Dannon light vanilla yogurt.  I had the walnuts, but forgot to add them and it was still yummy. Refrigerated leftovers the next day were not as good even with the addition of a shot of lemon juice.

Very good!  The cinnamon makes such a difference.  Didn't have a problem with the fruit browning like some others said...I did put a little lemon juice on them to help with that though.  Very yummy!

This fruit salad is just fabulous!  It was Mother's Day breakfast.  Mom loved it!  She asks for it all the time now!  I changed this by using pineapple instead of strawberries, berry yogurt instead of vanilla, and no cinnamon.

Delicious morning breakfast! However, with all the fruit going into this, it was a little sweet using 1 cup of vanilla yogurt. I would recommend using 1/2 cup of plain and 1/2 vanilla yogurt. And I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, which was plenty.

A recipe only good as a base to work with later on. I was not too much of a fan of the heavy walnut crunch that was present; it made the overall salad feel very heavy. I might ease up on the walnuts and add more apples, bananas, and yogurt in the future.

This was quick, tasty, and easy. I used strawberry yogurt as my other choices were cotton candy or strawberry kiwi, but not vanilla. I really liked the combo of walnuts and apples, that was great together in this. I added a spoon of cool whip to this and it was great.

I didn't have any apples so I omitted them. This was still good. I did toss the fruit with a little lemon juice to keep from browning before adding the yogurt and cinnamon. My family enjoyed this.

A nice fruit salad as we transition to autumn. I really enjoyed it . . . Plus the fruits can be varied, as can the nuts and probably the flavor of yogurt. Yay.

I've been wanting to make this salad and got to have it this weekend when allrecipes' reviewer, What a Dish!, made it for us!  I had felt a little uncertain about having cinnamon in my fruit salad, but this was really delicious!  "Dish" used plain Greek yogurt that was doctored up with farmers market honey & homemade vanilla (from this website).  For the fruit, she used bananas, peaches, plums, and strawberries.  Great salad, Bridestein and What a Dish! :-) Thank you so much!

WONDERFUL and EASY to make. Everyone LOVED this fruit salad. The only changes I made were I omitted the apples and walnuts and substituted blueberries, mandarin oranges, and pineapple. I also added one cup of granola. Definitely a keeper!!!

I found this recipes very refreshing.  It is something that can be used any time of day...bfast, lunch or dinner.  Sometimes I do not have everything so I throw in another fruit (such as mandarin oranges) or instead of nuts, I use granola.  It works very nicely for a healthy snack too!

This salad is excellent: healthy, tasty and easy to make. Does not have all those marshmellows, sugar and processed stuff that is supposed to make salads palatable. I substituted pecans, clementines and other fruits and it came out great!

I made this for a business meeting and everyone loved it. I sliced the strawberries and let them sit in a simple syrup overnight and drained them before adding to the salad. I diced the gala apples the night before and sprinkled with a small amount of lemon juice that I drained off before preparing the salad. The bananas, cinnamon and yogurt were all added the next morning before the meeting.

Quick and easy.  Tasted good. I made the mistake of using poppy seeds, which seemed to changed the color/consistency. I also used finely chopped nuts (chips) which also contributed to the strange appearance. I made this ahead & it 'set up'...maybe tossing it all together at the last minute would be better.

Good, just make sure you use firm bananas, not soft, it works better. Put a little lemon juice on the fruit to keep them from browning.

I made this to serve alongside our meal tonight as a fruit salad, but it could easily be breakfast or dessert even. It is delicious! I was entertaining 2 grands tonight, ages 6 and 9, so I didn't add the cinnamon. I omitted the walnuts from their servings, but not from my husband's and mine. This will be something I serve often.

This was great, it is a very versatile salad.  I like to include fresh pineapple and more berries - blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.  I've tried it with regular organic yogurt and greek yogurt and I think I like the Greek yogurt better - helps the sauce be less runny.  The cinnamon with the vanilla flavor is wonderful!

and much better when i tweaked it---into the "best fruit desert ever"--[according to my 84 yo husband today] by replacing the apples and bananas with bite sized cantaloupe, blueberries, kiwi, grapes, lemon zest and black cherries and those fresh strawberries. Folded in mango puree [smoothie] mixed with local honey [about 3 tablespoons each]  and set out with bowls of lemon mixed raisins/cranberries & both pecan and walnut pieces & a mint chocolate chip greek yogurt--or the vanilla. Gratefully a friends recent gift of persimmon pecan raisin bread---toasted--- provided the substantial grain/flavor/texture component that balanced the mixed fruit.  [even better with our spread of mascarpone cheese blend with a tart compote]. No cinnamon in this mixed fruit desert [fulfilling meal in fact]. 
FYI--
For simplicity and a 2nd meal/desert I use a dusting of great cinnamon with a tablespoon of mascarpone & equivalent of Ferrero NUTELLA.  Simply --in a bowl.  Great snack/small meal--no bread/crackers required,  but sure--if u want that....there are many tasty, affordable whole grain choices...  enjoy

If you like this recipe, the next time you pass one of those Frozen Yogurt places - you know the one you crave but try to avoid because it's basically dessert and way too much sugar, yadda, yadda, yadda - go in but "flip" the dish.  Fill your cup with all the fresh fruits, especially berries, and then top with just a little frozen yogurt.  Garnish with nuts and/or granola for "healthy, easy, delicious" with no guilt, AND no hassles of washing, peeling, chopping, etc.!  My favorite fro yo shop: Yogurtini!

a fantastic quick recipe that makes for a great addition to any brunch.  Put this together for Date, as I was invited over to enjoy a Vegetarian brunch with a betty that I had been seeing... Worked out great as the rest of the meal was not ready for a good hour and a half, but I was able to walk in with something that was ready out the box.  Really simple to assemble; I had no difficulties, even coming off of a late late late night/early morning (depending on your perspective) and being only about 1 cup of coffee in at the point of prep and assembly.  good times really

I enjoyed this. I am not sure that I would add the walnuts next time however. But overall, it was pretty good.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some fruit that I had and came across this. It was good and very fast. I didn't have strawberries on hand so used oranges instead, squeezing some of the juices over the rest of the fruit. I also used fat free yogurt and it turned out ok. I added a little cool whip and a sprinkle more of cinnamon to the top, and served it in a small custard dish. My husband loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Used Trader Joe's vanilla yogurt and Vanilla Almond Granola.  It was a hit!

Awesome!!! And so easy! We eat this often and my kids think it's a dessert! (wink wink) We also sprinkle a little ground flax seed on the top for extra fiber.
