For those who attended Ohio University and know what "real" beer cheese soup from the Pub is like... I tell you this recipe is pretty close to the famous Wednesday special.  It was quick and easy to make.  Somebody tell Mike, the secret recipe is out.

I highly recommend forgoing the velveeta yuk :) I used 1 can of cream of chicken & one can of cream of broccoli.
Instead of fake cheese, I used 8oz of cabot sharp cheddar & 8oz cabot montery jack. I used dogfish head 90  minute IPA so there was a little bite, but it was mellowed out by the montery jack, I also used fresh cauliflower - delicious!!!

After reading the reviews I can see where this soup can turn out a bunch of different ways with different tastes. I use 4 cups of chicken broth instead of boullion and water. I also omit the califlower, brocoli, and carrots. The onion and potato are perfect for this type of soup plus the leftovers don't get soggy. I recommend using a beer that doesn't have a bitter aftertaste. The darker the better for true beer cheese soup flavor. This recipe freezes well. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good beer cheese soup.

This was great!  I used low fat cream of chicken soup, low fat processed cheese, and light beer.  My boyfriend never had a clue.  It was still rich and creamy, but with less fat.  I also left out the boullions to cut down on the salt and added garlic and basil to spice it up.  Wonderful!

Being from Wisconsin, this is my husband's and my kind of soup!  We absolutely love it.  I do not use bouillon cubes though because they are too salty.  Instead, I use either chicken broth from a can or "Better Than Bouillon" paste from a jar.  I also substitute a bag of California Blend (broccoli, cauliflour, carrots) frozen veggies instead of just broccoli.  Thank you for sharing Naomi!

Oh my heavens ..This was perfection!  My husband said this was one of the most fabulous dinners he had ever had - I served it up with a great Bruchetta recipe from here!  I did not change a thing except I made it in a crockpot and simmered it for hours.  YUMMY!!!

I have found after making this soup twice that I would leave out the broccoli.  The two times I made the soup it was wonderful - but the broccoli stole the show.  I made it for clients and they thought it was cheese & broccoli soup.  Next time - more potato,carrot and cauliflower, less water and 18oz of beer.

I replaced 3 cups of the water with milk (who uses water in a creamy soup??), left out the broccoli and cauliflower and used about 1/2 a Cup onion. Turned out perfectly!

I'm not really sure what kind of soup this is.  It's not broccoli cheese or beer cheese but the two of them put together.  I too am from Wisconsin and am used to a much thicker version of this soup minus the broccoli.  The recipe is good, but it's not a traditional beer cheese soup.

Very good soup.  I omitted the potatoes since we didn't have any on hand.  I also used a dark ale and sauted the carrots, onions, and celery and some garlic before adding them to the soup base. This is a definite soup to make again. Topped it off and served with green onions and croutons.

This is so very good!  I used New Belgium Sunshine Wheat (those living in CO know it!) and I think it was too mild.  I'll probably try Fat Tire next time.  But I really loved this, especially with all the great veggies.  And it's so fast and easy!

very, very good.  Rich, but not too much so.  I did not add the broccoli/cauliflower mix.  It didn't need it at all.

I have made this over and over again. I do not use brocolli as it ends up being a brocolli/cheese soup. Use Gennessee beer and velveeta cheese. I have tried using other cheeses, but they tend to stick to the spoon when eating. And I serve with roast beef and min-weck rolls. Yum! Great recipe, thanks!

I used chicken stock instead of bullion and water.  Also used a light beer b/c that's all we drink.  Added a few more veggies b/c I like the soup chunky.  Great soup!

Very tasty! I made this with Sam Adams and reduced sodium chicken broth in place of the bullion and water. In order to ensure the soup was thick enough for our liking I increased the potatoes by a full cup and used an immersion blender before adding the condensed soup and processed cheese.

Made this exactly as directed.  It was excellent, but I think it could use a little more beer taste.

I served this to our friends for our annual After Thxgiving and No Turkey party, close to 100 guests.   EVERYONE LOVED IT!  I had one person ask if I added 'crack'.  Please take it as it was meant.  It went over very well.  I purreed the cauliflower, carrots , potatoes, and onion so it was a smooth blend, used a very dark beer and added a little milk at the end.    I will definately be making this again and soon....Thank you for sharing

This is another favorite in my house & great for kids too!  After making this for several years, I have made a few changes that I think make a perfect broccoli cheese soup.  I cut out the onion, for personal taste preference.  I also just use about 2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli (no cauliflower) and stir it in for about 5-10 minutes.  For the cheese, I use 8oz velveeta and 8 oz sharp cheddar.  Also, I have found that just about any beer will work, but I prefer to use the Coor's Non-Alcoholic.  You can sub Apple Juice/Water, but it will change the taste dramatically.

really really good! I would use all broccoli next time as I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower but wouldn't change anything else. Used Bud Light as that's what we had on hand.

Simple to make and turned out better than I thought.  I took the advice of other raters and used chicken broth instead of bouillon, fresh cauliflower & broccoli and 8 oz cheddar/8 oz jalapeno jack.  I also used Schlafly's pumpkin ale for my beer and it gave the soup a nice fall flavor (not too pumpkin-y) and my house a nice pumpkin aroma.

Absolutely wonderful!  I make soups all of the time and this is going to be a keeper.  I added two frozen bags of veggies:  One of brocolli and one of cauliflower.  I will probably just do the cauliflower the next time.  The brocolli really breaks down while it sits and it looks more like brocolli soup than anything else.  I also added two bottles of Newcastle beer and I added more potatoes.  Very hearty dish! It's even better on the second day.

I didn't like this recipe at all, this isn't the kind you can get from a restaurant. Real Beer Cheese soup doesn't call for Cream of Chicken. If your looking for something that tastes more like Beer and Cheese, look on.

I'll keep looking for a recipe that better suits my tastes. This was OK but nothing that makes me want to make it again.  Knowing the kind of beer to use might help, all I had was an imported english ale, which gave it a bitter taste.

Very good, and as most soups go, even better the next day. Used "Better Than Boullion" instead of dry cubes. Used Bud Lite! I thought it was going to get lost in the other flavors, but it actually was the right hint of beer flavor for our taste. Definitely making this again.

Very good. I used a dark lager and ended up w/ a nice mild beer flavor in the background.  Very rich.  Whole family liked it, even the little ones.

This is good.  Not the very best I have ever had, but good.  I made the mistake of grabbing an ale instead of a pilsner beer- it had a bitter beer aftertaste to it.  I think next time I will pay attention to what I grab out of the fridge.

YUUUUUMMY!  This was very easy and really delicious.  I had never had beer cheese soup with veggies in it so I was a bit skeptical.  It turned out great and the whole family liked it.  I used a 20 oz can of beer (that's all I had on hand and I don't drink beer so didn't want to waste it.)  I added a bit of sharp cheddar and omitted the equivalent of the velveeta.  Will be making this again, especially on a chilly winter evening.

Mmmmm....We tried this twice - first as is and then spiced up a double batch with a can of Rotel tomatoes and a cup of frozen corn.  My son suggested that I "give this recipe to GRANDMA! (Obviously, the highest praise).  Thanks for the recipe - definitely a keeper.

Mmmm... so yummy!  I used a spicy velveeta cheese with jalepeno's because I love spicy foods, and it had a great kick to it.  Next time I'd like to serve it in bread bowls, but by itself it was delicious!

This is great!! I doubled the recipe for a small party (8 people) and there was only a tiny container of it left by the end of the night. I didn't change anything - it's perfect as is!!  Update - Careful when heating/reheating this soup, as it burns easily.

I used canned chicken broth, light beer, store brand sharp cheddar and a bag of fresh veggies including carrots, snap beans & broccoli (chopped into bite sized pieces). I had some leftover cooked sausage which I chopped into bite size. My hard to please children LOVED this and I will definitely make again and am passing this recipe along to my mom.

So good and so easy!  I made this on a weeknight for a quick meal with grilled sandwiches and loved it!  Brought the leftovers to work the next day and everyone wanted the recipe.  This is a recipe you can play with-I omitted some indredients that weren't on hand.  Yummy!

I gave this a try, however instead of using cream of chicken, I used tomatoe sauce, and I replaced the cheese with kidney beans.  I'm not a big fan of cauliflower or brocolli, so I only used onions, and peppers.  I decided to spice it up a bit by using some chili powder and oregano.  I took the potatoes our to give it more of a southern feel.  It turned out to be not so bad.

Ever wonder about these people who substitute everything, and then complain about the taste?

I actually did make it according to the recipe.  It was good, but I'm not sure if this is exactly what a true beer cheese soup is.

Very authentic and incredibly delicious.  We used 6 cups canned chicken broth and half of the processed cheese the recipe called for.  In place of the other half we used a pound of shredded cheddar.  We also used 2 bottles of Henry Weinhardt's Hefeweizen beer and upped the veggie count.  Excellent and a definate repeat.  But be sure to have alot of hungry friends for dinner because it makes alot of soup!

I made this recipe for the 1st time the other night, and my family loved it.  As a last minute choice to make as an accompaniment with some polish sausage, this recipe was very easy and even my picky 9-year-old had seconds.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used pumpkin ale (left over from an impulse purchase, and apparently no one was going to drink it), and fresh broccoli and cauliflower.  Also used the mexican-flavored velveeta.  The whole family gobbled it up!

I found this to be quick and easy.  I would cook it a little longer at the end to thicken the soup a bit more.  Other than that, it was a big hit.

I found this soup to be "OK", but my husband (who's homebrew we used in the recipe) loved it.  My two little boys ate it with some coaxing (there's the cauliflower factor, after all), but weren't especially fond of it.

I used real cheese, and spiced it up a bit more than the recipe called for.   I'll probably try it again with regular beer (Bud, or the like), which would be less bitter than the homebrewed IPA we used.

agree with the posters that said this was a rather thin cheese soup, so based on the original recipe, I gave this a four star. However, I will be making it again with the modifications I made to thicken it. I added a 1/2 lb of provolone and 1/4 lb of sharp cheddar.

We loved this soup! We don't care for celery or cauliflower, so I left those out; made up for lack of cauliflower with extra broccoli.  Also reduced the onion, as some is needed for flavor, but it doesn't agree with me.  I used very low sodium organic chicken broth instead of bouillon and water; was afraid it would be too bland, but the flavor was great - no need even to add salt or pepper at the table.  Used Coors Light; just a very slight beer taste, and no bitterness as others noted in their reviews.  I might try with "real" cheese next time, but the flavor and texture were so good, I hate to change anything.  Husband loved it; he's nursing a tooth with a temporary filling, so a rich, filling soup was just what the doc ordered!  Thank you for this tasty recipe - it was a big hit!

This was great! Only a few changes; I omitted the broccoli and cauliflower and added an extra 1/2 c each of carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes. I did not use velveeta instead I used 1/2 c extra aged Gouda and 1 1/2 C sharp cheddar.

I guess I did not add enough cheese because all I could taste was the chicken soup.  Maybe it will be different tomorrow, and the next day, as it ages.

I used Pearl Street Brewery Brown Ale (Wisconsin) and Shullsburg Sharp Cheddar (Wisconsin), but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It was delicious and I will surely make it again.  Not sure yet how it rates as a leftover though.

I love this recipe!  I went to OU and yes it is almost exactly like The Pub's beer cheese soup!  I have been searching for this recipe for years and I'm so happy I've finally found it.  My husband loves it and we eat it at least once a month.

Skipped the celery, used veggie bouillon and fresh broccoli. Added fresh ground pepper. Very rich, start with cup vs. a bowl if you are serving with other food. Hubby loved it.

Very good. I made some adjustments based on what I had. Didn't add the broc/caul, added extra potatoes and diced red and green pepper (I had some in the oven), replaced the bullion with "better than bullion" cause it's better :)  I didn't have quite a lb of velveeta so I added almost a lb and about a cup of shredded cheddar. The cream soups I have were cheddar cheese and cream of celery. It turned out very creamy and just a bit thick (this could have been my fault because I boiled a bit longer with the potatoes I detest hard potatoes) and the cheddar. I added a bit more beer which was really good. Overall great and very flexible recipe. I can see doubling or tripling and making for a large group.

Pretty good. The only modifications I made were to omit the broccoli and cauliflower as I didn't have any. I also used the lighter cream of chicken soup. Thought it was a good way to use up veggies, but was a bit salty even with the lower sodium canned soup. Not sure if maybe it was the cheese or the bouillon that made it saltier. May skip the bouillon next time, reduce it or use low sodium broth in place of water and bouillon.  Good base recipe if nothing else :)

Made as directed. Once it was finished I couldn't taste the beer.  I will certainly try this again but I will add the beer at the end, use chicken stock/broth instead of the cubes and less veggies.

I liked most everything about this recipe except it does not really suggest a beer... I used Bristol Winter Warlock, an oatmeal stout, and by the end of the bowl the beer taste had become overwhelming and bitter. I would suggest using an Amber or lighter ale for this soup.

Loved this soup.  I did change some of the ingredients though.  instead of chicken boullion cubes I used low sodium chicken stock, left out the cream of chicken soup, using cream instead, and instead of processed  cheese spread, I added shredded 5 cheese blend prior to turning off the heat.  This soup disappeared fast!  Absolutely Awesome!!!

Very good! Could have used a bit more "cheesy flavor" but still great nonetheless! I used a dark/red beer, and it gave it a great beer flavor!

Whenever I have made beer cheese in the past, it always got gritty from the milk curdling.  This was very good and was able to be heated high enough to melt the cheese but not curdle.  I did not use the broccoli/cauliflower due to being allergic. I also did not add any water but used beer and chicken stock.  I used sharp processed cheese (8 oz), montrey jack (8 oz) and can of Campbells chedder cheese soup.  I used Heiniken beer and for more "bite" added dry mustard, red and white pepper, Tabosco sauce and Worchshire sauce. Very good!

This turned out great!  It was very smooth and creamy.  We really enjoyed all the veggies in it.  I did sautee the raw veggies in olive oil and garlic prior to putting into the soup to soften them a bit.  The only addition I made was to add a little pepper at the end to give it a bite.  Great with crusty bread to dip.

This soup was very good and I will make it again. I too like some other reviewers used chicken broth instead of bullion cubes.... It was tasty but must stir constantly after adding cheese and cream of chicken so it doesn't burn to the bottom of the pan.

This recipe was better than I expected. Nice and thick consistency - very hearty. However, I would call it vegetable beer cheese soup - it's loaded with veggies! Next time, I will only use potatoes, celery & broccoli. Also, make sure to chop the potatoes small enough - mine did not seem to cook and I had the soup on the stove for almost an hour overall.

I used Guiness for this soup, which gave the soup a bit of a strong aftertaste. Next time I'll use a lighter beer, but otherwise this soup was fabulous!

I made this and it was pretty good the first day, but the vegetables in the leftover soup were a little soggy the next day. I used two small packages of frozen vegetables instead of the carrots and mix listed in the recipe. I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to make up for the extra veggies.

Perhaps I don't know what good beer cheese soup is supposed to taste like, but mine came out bitter. I used a fine Czech Pilsner and used half velveeta and half real cheddar. I just think something about the fake cheese, the broccoli and the beer made this taste bitter. I might try this again and not put in broccoli at all, but use corn, instead. It would have been nice to know what kind of beer the author of this recipe used. That might make all the difference.

My boyfriend and I agreed that this was the best soup we've had. We substituted 4 cups of vegatable broth for the 4 bouillon cubes/water and also cream of celery soup instead of chicken. It was excellent, we made it again the following week.

This is a delicious recipe!  My husband loved it.  He likes his soups simple though, so I left out all of the veggies, put a dallop of sour cream in the center and sprinkled cooked-crumbled up bacon on top.  Yummy!!!

A simple, tasty and delicious recipe.  I substituted 4 cups canned chicken broth for the bouillon/water mix.  Used "IC Light" beer from the "Burgh" for great flavor.  Also used a frozen veggie mix that included the carrots.  I will be adding this to my "make again" list.

I highly recommend you do not follow the ingredients to a tee- modifications NEED to be made. This dish is incredibly, unforgivably high in salt. Me and my girlfriend could only eat a few spoons before we had to tap out because it was so salty. Underneath that salt- was a decent flavor, good texture and very easy to assemble meal. definitely get reduced sodium soup, and perhaps even use less boullion or use a reduced sodium chicken stock for the base. Seriously disappointing to see a beautiful pot of soup wasted, it really was pretty good aside from the high levels of salt. I even went so far as to whisk some milk and flour over a medium heat to create a bland "gravy" to dilute the soup after it was done to alleviate the salt, and it helped only so little I would have had to create a ton more, to give you perspective. Remember, there is a lot of sodium in this- cream of chicken soup, chicken bouillon and cheese. Manage it!

Started making this last fall. I mix up the way I make it though. I find adding one container of chicken stock or chicken broth cuts down on the sodium of the bouillon cubes. I usually use Guinness for my beer and just stick with potato and onion for veggies, don't want people to confuse it with cheesy broccoli soup. I spice it up with just a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, which complements it nicely. Fresh homemade dinner rolls round off the meal. Great comfort food for a cold autumn/winter night.

Exactly how the submitted described it - simple and satisfying! I used no-sodium chicken granules (what I had on hand), non-alcoholic beer, and about 12 oz of just the cauliflower. I only had 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup, and the consistency turned out fine for me. I've noticed the price of Velveeta in the brick-form skyrocketing lately; instead I used a 12 oz pkg of Velveeta cheese slices. They melted down very quickly and so smoothly. Thanks NFGRUPE! Loved this!

Really loved this soup!  Great flavors and a nice twist to vegetable soup.  My only complaint is that I would have liked it to be a bit thicker, like a traditional beer soup. However, I hate making a roux so I'll take it!   I used a brown ale, which was perfect.  In looking up the best type of beer for soup, light beer was not recommended because it is too watery and not enough flavor and an IPA would be too bitter.  My only adjustment was to use vegetable broth and a combination of cream of onion soup and cream of celery soup to make it vegetarian.

Absolutely delicious!  I kinda felt like something was missing though.  Can't quite put my finger on what it is that is needed.  Definitely worth making despite that!  I will make this again!

Okay, so I must admit I'm a cheese fanatic.....this soup was fantastic!  But I added a jar of Ragu triple cheese, and it was even better!

Fantastic!  I didn't have any celery and I used a block of Colby-Jack cheese.  Also, to make it easy, I just threw in a frozen bag of cauliflower, broccoli and carrots.  My husband couldn't stop salivating while it cooked and then ate it all up!

I love beer cheese soup and order it any chance I get.  If you are looking for a recipe that is easy to make and tasty, this is the one.  I leave out the celery because I feel like it gets soggy if you are going to eat it the next day.  The same comment can go for the cauliflower and broccoli.  The recipe is also flexible.  Sometimes I add more beer, sometimes less.  Sometimes I do all potatoes and carrots, sometimes I mix in the other vegetables.   Super easy recipe to work with!!!

This was so easy & excellent! I made it just as the recipe called for except I did not have any broccoli or cauliflower on hand. It was fine without it. A fun addition is to pop some plain popcorn and add to your soup in place of crackers ~ very good!

I first had this soup at a restaurant a number of years ago and fell in love.  A few years ago my brother brought over some homemade beer cheese soup that tasted just like the restaurant!  When I got around to asking him for the recipe he couldn't find it! :(  Lucky for me I found this recipe.  I just made it tonight and it was awesome.  The only thing I did different was that I put all the vegetables in a food processor to chop them up.  I still followed the recipe about when to add the vegetables though.  There really is a surprising amount of vegetables in this soup!  Use the food processor and the kids will never know!    The original recipe makes way more than 6 servings though.  I'd say it's at least 10 bowls.

Not has thick as other cheese soups I've had, but could easily cut back on the water by a cup. (Overnight, it should thicken some too.) Wound up adding Fontinella cheese for a little sharpness. My grocer didn't have the brick Velveeta, so I used those packaged slices. I think some flavor might've been sacraficed there. The cream soup is a nice cheat!

We didn't like this at all. Maybe it's because I left out the broccoli and cauliflower, but this tasted like a mouth full of velveeta cheese. A pound of velveeta is a LOT. I could feel my arteries hardening just looking at it. Sorry folks.

This is TERRIBLE.  Even my husband who is not picky at all will not eat it again.  Too thin, incredibly bland and not enough of a cheesy taste.  In no way can this be considered Beer Cheese Soup...removing it from my recipe box and moving on to try another recipe.  Blgh!

Whole family loved this soup.  I made a few changes though.  My kids don't like veg. so I left them out and used more potatoes.  Next time I think I will cut back on the cheese a little, but over all it was fantastic.

This was very good and easy to make. My family really enjoyed it. Next time I will leave out the colliflower, but that is a personal taste. There are a lot of vegtables in this so I may ease up on them some, but that again is a personal taste. Overall this was excellent and easy!

Very little flavor. If it hadn't been for the garlic bread that we had to go with this, I would have been very disappointed and hungry.

Loved this!!  I made a mistake because I didn't know boullion cubes come in larger sizes (oops!) But it was still good!  Will make again!

This was so easy and yummy!  I used california blend frozen veqia and omitted the fresh carrotts, as they are in the frozen vegis - also used 2 cans of chicken broth versus bouillon.  Used the mexican velveeta for spice.  This was awesome!

This was very good and my husband said it was the best soup he ever had. But the kids did not like it, and I did not like the processed cheese taste. Rather have one made with real cheese.

This was good. I only had one bullion cube, but it still turned out really well. Next time I'll try some sausage or ham in it.

Very tasty. I was hoping for some more flavors in the seasoning side so that is something I may work on. I felt the beer flavor took over a little bit but VERY GOOD and I will definitely be making it again!

I also used broth instead of bouillon and a mixture of cheddar and Velveeta. Added fresh broccoli at the end instead of frozen. Very tasty soup, perfect for a cold winter day.

I made this into a vegetarian soup by substituting vegetable boullion and cream of celery soup.  It was delicious, but very salty.  Next time I'd add less cheese and definitely won't add any salt.

This is a great soup recipe! I made this for my grandmother after she got out of surgery and she just loved it. My grandparents keep asking me to come over and make it again.
