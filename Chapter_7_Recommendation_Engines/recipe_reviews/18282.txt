This was excellent!  And so easy.  I didn't have any onion soup so I used cream of mushroom instead.  Also, I used fresh mushrooms sauteed with an onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  I will be making this all the time.  It tastes like it took a lot more effort than it does.

*** Update:  made it as written for the first time last night and I didn't like it as much.  The cream of mushroom version is so much better than the onion soup version!  So, as written 4 stars but with cream of mushroom, 5!

Mixed 1/2 can of the French Onion soup mix and 1/2 can of golden mushroom condensed soup!  Tripled the mushrooms with a mix of fresh sauteed baby bellas, brown, shitake and regular white mushrooms.  Wonderful recipe ~ thanks Karen for the submission!

I've found the rice that works in this is the Uncle Ben's Converted Rice.  When i used the cheap brands of regular long grain rice, the rice takes more than an hour to cook.  An additional half hour even.  The converted rice is cooked through after 60 minutes.  Definitely better to spend the extra money than to run around the kitchen like a chicken with her head cut off because the guests are hungry and the rice isn't done.  This is on the table every year for Christmas.

This is a favorite of my husband & myself.  The only changes I made was chicken broth instead of beef, and to cook it in the rice cooker.  I just mix it all up & turn on the rice cooker, much quicker than using the oven.

If you are a mushrom over I would HIGHLY recommend double/ or tripling the amount of mushrooms in this dish.  I always use fresh ones and sautee them just until they start to wilt and then pour the mushrooms and the juices into the rice.

This is a recipe my family has been making for years! Everyone loves it and it's so easy. I make mine healthier by using low-sodium broth, a bit less butter, and brown rice instead of white. With brown rice you have to increase the cooking time, but it turns out just as nice. Sometimes I cook chicken in with the rice - I just throw it in with the rest of the ingredients before popping it into the oven and it's always cooked through and juicy when the rice is done.

If this could have been any easier, I would have fallen asleep making it.  I did add a little to fit my personal preference.  I used 3/4 c. of white rice & 1/4 c. of wild rice (which the wild rice ended up to be a little undercooked, so I will cook it 1/2 way through next time I make it).  I also added some shredded carrots & some fresh chopped parsley (about 1/8 c.).  I will make this again, but I will probably only use the can of french onion and a 14 oz can of low sodium beef broth to cut a little on the salt.  Good recipe Karen, thank you ;)

I have to say, the smell of the onion soup was kinda gross, but the end result was really good!  Prep couldn't be easier!  Also from Canada and had to really look for the French Onion soup, just found "Onion" soup by Campbells and it worked fine.  Used Uncle Ben's converted rice and was done in exactly an hour as promised. This recipe will go into my regular rotation, thanks!  Update:  Aug/30/07 - DO NOT try and use Minute Rice as it is a disaster!  I also have tried this with mushroom soup and with chicken broth instead of the french onion soup.  The mushroom soup is my favorite.

I used a combination of 1 cup brown rice and a 1/4 cup wild rice, a 14.5 oz can low sodium beef broth, French onion soup and a can of mushrooms, drained.  I left out the butter and baked it uncovered for 90 minutes, stirring about half way through.  Couldn't ask for an easier recipe than this and pretty tasty too.  It had a funny aftertaste though; I think I'll try it with 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and a couple teaspoons beef bouillon next time, with a dash of either Soy Sauce or Worchestershire.  I think it would taste better if you used fresh mushrooms sautéed in a little olive oil as well and toppled with some thinly sliced green onions or fresh parsley.  I am on a quest to find a tasty, simple to prepare, rice side dish to replace the processed boxed varieties that are full of chemicals and preservatives!

I got this recipe a few years ago from a friend's mother.  Since first making it, it has been requested more times than I can count.  I too use fresh sliced mushrooms and low sodium broth.  Always comes out right, dish always comes home with me empty.

Excellent recipe!  It could not be easier to throw together.  I used a long grain/wild rice combo and replaced the butter with reduced-fat margarine.  Since I served this with chicken, I substituted chicken broth for both the onion soup and beef broth and added minced onion.  This was fantastic and ready within 60 minutes!  Thank you!

Loved its simplicity and savory-ness! Thank you!! This makes a nice lunch dish because it's not too heavy and it reheats well, too.
If you need some extra protein....this goes well with pan fried tofu tossed on top/mixed in before putting in the oven and a then few dashes of soy sauce at the table!

Very good recipe. It can't get any easier!! I doubled the recipe and ended up with way to much, I would say the orig recipe serves 6 for sure.  Everyone enjoyed. Used white mushrooms because that is what I had, but I imagine this would even more delicious with a more flavorful shroom:

This was really easy and came out very good. I substituted the french onion soup for cream of mushroom and did it on the stove top. Melted the butter in the pot, then added the rice with diced onion and a little bit of garlic. Stirred until rice was golden, then added chicken broth and cream of mushroom, turned heat to low then let simmer. It came out great!

The was a great base recipe.  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I used cream of mushroom as someone else suggested, and fresh chicken broth instead of beef.  I also used fresh mushrooms and added diced onion, and I sauteed them in the butter before mixing with the other ingredients.  This was an instant favorite rice for my family.  Thanks!

I have been making this for years, and it is so easy! I have a change.  I use Long Grain rice.  Mix all the ingredients, cover and place in the microwave for 20 minutes.  The rice is perfectly done without the long period of time in the oven.

I made this in my rice cooker using one can of cream of mushroom soup, one can of beef broth, one stick of butter, and one and 1/2 cups (the cup that comes with the rice cooker) and just turned the cooker on.  It came out so great and creamy!  I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.

This is the easiest greatest no fail rice recipe, I use it all the time at the lodge and can substitute ingredients as using diluted beef granules etc and dried chopped onion etc, just love it and it always comes out perfect every time.

Everyone in my family of picky eaters enjoyed this recipe--that's practically unheard of in my house!  I did tweak it a little to suit our preferences.  I used one can of Cream of Mushroom soup and one can of Cream of Chicken And Mushroom soup and skipped the added mushrooms.  I doubled the recipe so it take about an hour and a half to cook.  It is very tasty!

Excellent!!!  Must admit is was a bit difficult finding the condensed onion soup in the market.  Finally found it--Campbell's makes a 10.5 oz. one.  It's small and you have to REALLY look for it amongst the soups!  Also, I didn't have 8x8 baking dish, but I used 2.5 quart Pyrex baking bowl that worked fine.  I also melted the butter before adding to the remainder of ingredients and stired it up.  I followed directions to the letter--but I opened oven a few times to bake the pork tenderloin--and the rice was perfect in just an hour as advertised.  This rice is definitely going into my permanent box!

I haven't come across many dishes on this site that had such high ratings and were this disappointing. My husband NEVER complains about the food that I make, and he did tonight, in fact he didn't even take more than a few bites. I suppose if you really like french onion soup then you might like this recipe, but for us it was way to sweet. I might try it again with cream of mushroom instead, which I should have done in the first place, but I thought I would try something different.

OMG!!!  This ia as wonderful as it is easy.  This will be a side dish on my Thanksgiving table this year.  I did not use canned broth, but broth from a box carefully measured and I used 8 oz of fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  This will now be a staple side dish in my house.  Thank you!!

I really like reading the comments from other people. Took the suggestion of substituting mushoom soup for onion soup.  Sauteed a few fresh mushrooms and some garlic.  This recipe was incredibly easy and it turned out really well.  When the comments are "make this again" I know I've found a winner.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

OMG...this was Fantabulous!!! I did make changes as well...yet again, I always do!  I used fresh mush (cremini) instead of canned, also used onion and garlic. Sauted them in the butter and a lil bit of EVOO and added the rice to the pan B4 adding it all to the cass dish. I also used cr of mush soup instead...the reviews had sueded me to do so...I am glad I did...we LOVED it! I also used chicken stock, pretty much all but the smallest amt in the can. It was more than the recipe called for....but made the rice sooo yummy! We ARE rice ppl and this was outstanding! But, I highly suggest making the mods to the rice, it makes it much more flavorful! I made it with Mushroom Melt stuffed chicken...I made mods to that as well...as always! It was an AMAZING dinner!!! So much so that we all overate bc we couldn't get enough!!
**Update-- I made this again with my mods, but this time I tried the healthier approach with brown rice and I used reg button mushrooms instead of cremini. Not the same, or as good. So I will always use white rice and cremini mush. I was still good, but not 5 stars good that route. Oh and I did have to bump up the cooking time, I increased it by an additional 30 mins to compensate for the extra cook time for brn rice. Wasn't overcooked, but be sure to have enough liquid, I used a whole 14 oz can of chick broth.

Yum!  I didn't have an condensed french onion so I did substitute it with cream of mushroom.  I only had fresh mushrooms, so I sauted them in 1 onion and 2 cloves garlic as suggested and it was great.  I'm sure the orginal would be just as good :).

Hands down my favorite rice recipe ever! I sauteed fresh mushrooms (never use canned), onion, and garlic in a little evoo. I also used ff low sodium chix broth instead of the beef broth. Loved the fact that you just put everything in one baking dish and cook. It was perfect in one hour like the recipe said. Rice was tender and still a little saucy from the broth and onion soup. I loved the flavors with the mushrooms. And my family loved it. A definate keeper. Wish I had found this one sooner!

Used cream of mushroom soup and doubled the recipe. Cooked in a 13x9, so it took a bit longer than an hour, but not long. YUMMY!

So easy and foolproof!!  I tried this recipe when I had a large crop of porcini mushrooms.  I followed it except I did use sauted fresh porcini's instead of the canned mushrooms.  I loved that I could toss it in the oven and forget about it.  My kind of rice, since I can BARELY make the bagged/boxed rice turn out!  This recipe is a keeper and make a nice accompanyment to many meats.

Yummy!! I tried a users comment and used cream of mushroom soup instead of the beef broth.  I think this could go either way, cream of mushroom replacing the beef or the onion broth.

This was just delicious, I actually crave this dish.  I followed other users suggestions and used Uncle Ben's Converted Rice and Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I've also tried the French Onion, which I didn't care for at all.

This was okay - the flavor was a little different from what I'm used to, but I still think I prefer Knorr, Uncle Ben's, and Rice-A-Roni rice mixes.

Was delicious!! Followed MISSJENAFFLECK's advice and used mushroom soup rather than the french onion soup and it was amazing. Made along side a picnic Ham, steamed broccoli and steamed carrots. Was the perfect touch to a yummy dinner! Will definitely right his one out and place it in my *best recipe* box!

This was delicious! Thank you for sharing.   I used a can of cream of mushroom soup (undiluted) in place of the onion soup as one reviewer suggested. I also used chicken broth in place of beef broth. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and also added a can of chopped spinach. I left out the butter.   The spinach and mushroom together have a wonderful earthy flavor and using the cream of mushroom soup gave the rice a nice creamy texture.   The boyfriend and roommate both liked it very much. I would make this again!

Rice was easy to make, and tasted ok.  I thought it was a little bland though.  I will try again, but use Lipton onion mushroom soup in it to add more flavor.

This rice was amazing.  I did follow some other users suggestions and use cream of mushroom instead of the french onion and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Also because I didn't have any beef broth I used chicken broth.  Yummy!

I'm obviously in the minority here, but this recipe did not do anything for me. It was waaaaaaaaay too salty and just kind of blah. As another reviewer said, I prefer Rice-a-Roni to this. Will not be making again.

This is a great recipe for rice.  Tastes great and would be wonderful as left overs with some chicken added to it.

So comforting-- reminds me of my grandma's oven baked rice!  I used cream of mushroom and fresh mushrooms sauteed w/ garlic.  I also used FF, low sodium chicken broth.  So easy!

This was really really good!  I didn't use as much butter as it called for and it still turned out great.  I live at 7500 ft and cooked the rice for a little over an hour.  I also added about 1/2 cup of water during the last 15 minutes of the cooking time due to my high altitude.  My kids and husband loved it.  Sure to replace boxed rices!

I cannot say that this is one of the best things I ever tasted yet because I think this recipe still lacks more potential despite what all the five-star reviews have said. I use my rice cooker to make it and after the first *click* I totally thought I was making soup and the rice was still hard so I press the button for it to cook again. It came out alright after the second *click* and my impression of the texture and taste was whoa, this is beef-flavored mushroom rice porridge. It also leaves a weird after taste on your tongue. I try to balance the weird glutton mixture by eating it with regular rice. I probably won't make this again unless I was 1) sick of regular white rice porridge 2) desperate for an easy meal to make 3) had a vegetarian guest visiting to my house. Things I used when I made included: beef broth, mushroom soup, 1/2 an onion chopped, 1/4 cup of oil instead of butter and 1 (4 oz.) can of mushrooms. I also washed the rice before I used it.

The recipe is great but it needs twice the mushrooms listed. I used fresh instead of canned, which I recommend.

This was great, though I made some changes due to what was on hand; I didn't have any soup so I used 3 cups of water and 4 boulion cubes (probably could have used only 3) and a couple tablespoons of instant minced onion.  I had fresh sliced mushrooms and used about 6-8 oz.  It needed about 10 more minutes in the oven but it was very tasty!  I am not a big fan of rice but I will definitely make this again.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe. I live at high altitude so it took a considerably long time for this to cook and a much larger amount of water than called for in the recipe.  If you're in the mountains, just keep adding water while it's baking otherwise the rice comes out crunchy.  Used fresh shrooms sauteed in butter instead of canned.  Really good!!  Thanks for sharing!

I used 8 oz of water, 1/2 package of onion soup mix in place of the can of onion soup and also used fresh sliced mushrooms. Soo good!

This was a nice hit.  I did a few changes.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms in some butter and I used chicken broth instead of the beef and brown rice.   Everyone loved it.  

Thanks for a quick side dish.

DELICIOUS..... The aroma of this dish cooking filled the house. Could hardly wait for the rice to finish cooking. Somehow all of the mushrooms ended up on top of the rice and made for a nice presentation. Wish there was a rating for 10 stars, this recipe deserves it............

Very easy and very tasty.  I used low sodium chicken broth (since it was being served with chicken) and did not add any butter or margarine at all.  It was done in exactly 1 hour as the recipe states.  Will surely make this again.

It was good, but we found this too salty even with reduced sodium broth.  We used short grain rice, and I am uncertain whether that affects its saltiness.

Well, I don't have kids but I still gave 5 stars in that section cuz I loved it, and I'm a picky eater.  :o)  Also, it's not quick getting done, but the prep is VERY quick, so that got 5 stars too.  Anyway, this is a great-tasting, super-easy side dish.  Thanks!

This had a slight "processed" taste due to the beef broth but it was pretty good otherwise.  I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty as a side for my family of 4 (my kids barely eat).  I didn't have french onion soup so I doubled the beef broth and added about 1/2 a chopped onion.  I sauteed the onion in the butter, then I added the rice when the onion was just soft to toast the rice and finish browning the onion.  I added it all to a casserole dish with a full can of beef broth (remember I halved the recipe and didn't have onion soup).  There was just the right amount of liquid and the rice cooked ALMOST perfectly (just a little gummy).  I would like to try this with the onion soup but I think beef broth might be just a bit srong for my taste in this dish.  I might prefer it with chicken broth.  I would have loved to add some fresh sliced mushrooms to my onion while I was sauteeing, but my family won't eat them so I left them out.  

Thanks!

So amazing. I didn't have french onion & this was being paired with chicken so I used cream of chicken & chicken stock. I used brown rice. I cooked it at 450° for about 45+ minutes. I do want to try the original recipe.

Love this delicious, simple recipe. I did add 1 tsp. Onion Powder
and one cup frozen peas thawed, when rice came out of oven. Smells so good while cooking...As a personal preference, melted the butter before stirring in to mixture. Really a ten star recipe when factoring in ease, taste and minimal prep time and ingredients.
Low sodium soups don't take away from the taste.

I made this recipe as written.  It is really good, and easy to make!  I especially liked that I didn't have to cook the rice first.  Makes a quick and very good side dish for a weekday meal.  I'm going to keep these ingredients on hand so I can make this any time.

Loved love loved this recipe! I don't like canned mushrooms so I did slice fresh mushrooms and onions and sautéed all together then mixed it and threw it in the oven. Made this for Easter Brunch and there was nothing left. now I did have to cook about 10 minutes longer than stated but that's probably just my oven. This will definitely be part of the rotation in the house. My eldest son hates mushrooms and picked them all out but said he loved the flavor. Didn't really need to add extra salt because there is a lot in the French Onion soup. SO easy and really really good.

This was so good.  I used brown rice and cremini mushrooms, cream of mushroom soup and chicken broth and did not use the butter.  It was awesome!!!  I will make again and again.

Fantastic recipe!  Condensed French onion soup is not available locally, so followed other suggestions and used 2 cans creme of chicken soup the first time (double recipe for dinner function), and the second time (also doubled for a bbq dinner), used 1 can of creme of chicken plus 1 can creme of mushroom soup.  First time used fresh mushrooms sauteed in a bit of oil, and found the recipe slightly oily (should have reduced the butter I guess).  Second time used 1 can of mushrooms iso fresh mushrooms, and it was excellent.  My chef daughter-in-law wanted the recipe straight away!  Think I will stick to the tinned mushrooms - quick and easy and I could in all honesty not really taste the difference between the two lots of mushrooms after it came out of the oven.  Also so easy to add extra spices if needed.

I made this for Christmas dinner with the family, it was a hit with everyone. The things I changed was I used chicken broth instead of beef broth, I added boneless chicken breast and rosemary to season the rice. Next time I will marinate the chicken a little more with seasonings, perhaps cajun. Overall, I would make this again and it was very easy to make for beginners.

This was very good!  I made as instructed, although next time I think I will try cream of mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms.  I would also probably add some fresh onion and maybe garlic.  The recipe says it makes 4 servings but we have a lot more than that!

Have been making this for many years.  I too added extra mushrooms (fresh,sauteed slightly) but also added a can of sliced water chestnuts for a nice crunchy addition.

This was really good, and as the name implies, very 'easy'. I had a package of sliced fresh mushrooms just screaming to be used, so I sauteed those in the butter called for, and added in some garlic powder and parsley, just until tender. I mixed them with the rest of the ingredients and baked as directed. This has great flavor and I would totally make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Thanks for sharing!  This is a great way to spiff-up rice.  I did follow the suggestion made by another user and switched out the French Onion soup for cream of mushroom.  It turned out great!  I will be making this again soon.

I really liked this, despite the fact that I completely changed the ingredients to stuff that I have (but I give it 5 stars anyway, I know :P ) Anyway. i...really didn't have any of the ingredients, so my recipe consisted of brown rice, cream of mushroom soup, beef broth and butter. Threw it together, threw it in the oven, cooked it for longer cause hey, brown rice, and it was delicious.

This is truly a great recipe. Even my 4 yr old Granddaughter liked it, and she can be a fussy eater. I could not find a can of French Onion Soup, so I used a can of cream of mushroom. Turned out great. Thanks Karen for sharing this recipe

I have a rice cooker, so instead of baking, I dumped everything in there.  I used 1/2 the amount of butter to save fat/calories and I used fresh sliced mushrooms, because I don't really care for the taste of canned.  It came out great, in less than an hour, and even my kids ate it up.  Next time, I think I might add a little dry sherry and more mushrooms!

I doubled the recipe, and it required about 20 minutes extra cooking time.  I used a can of Cream of chicken and a can of cream of asparagus as that is what we had in the house and it turned out delicious.  I also added some Italian spices and garlic powder.  Will def. make this again!!

This was super easy, even for a beginning cook like me!  I substituted cream of mushroom soup and chicken broth for french onion soup and beef broth, as others have suggested.  I also only used about two tablespoons of butter, as well as adding a dash or two of minced onion, garlic, and parsley.  I let it bake for an hour, but it still needed about five additional minutes to be completely cooked.  I served it to mom, who enjoyed it (she went for seconds!), and my dad, who thought it was just ok (he's not into mushrooms).  Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe!!!  I use an entire package of fresh mushrooms since they shrink down so much when they cook.  This weekend I am going to try and make it with brown rice to make it a little bit healthier.  I will let you know how it turns out!

This was awesome! But I made some changes to get it that way. I used fresh mushrooms, not canned. They added a much better mushroom flavor. I did not, however, saute them before. I think I will try sauteing them next time but it turned out great without it. I also used cream of mushroom soup which gave it a better flavor. 

Makes GREAT leftovers (I only had leftovers because I cooked it all for only 2 people)

I can see how it would be great with chicken, and will try that next time.

I will give it three stars due to the fact it was easy and took very few ingredients. Our family just did not care for the taste of the dish. Thanks for the post.

I made this recipe with cream of mushroom soup after reading many other reviewers suggestions. The flavor was fantastic, but it was like glue. Needed some more moisture, perhaps more broth (and I even used a 14 oz. can, instead of a 10.5 oz. can). Will definitely make again, but I'm going to have to play with the recipe to make sure the consistency is right.

My sister introduced me to this & I fell in love!! It's so great and so easy too. Nothing needs to be changed unless maybe using low sodium soup since it is rather salty, but my DH loves the saltiness of this recipe (go figure) LOL

This was really good and it also surprised me how fast it cooked for me also as I was really in a hurry and decided on this at the last minute with only 45 minutes or so before serving. I had to improvise a bit though. I only use basmati rice in my home, and I had no cans of beef broth or F.O soup. I had french onion cup-a-soup and a beef bullion cube (haha), so I prepared them with liquid of 1 1/4C each and poured them into my pyrex pan with a little more butter than the recipe stated and sliced mushrooms. I set the oven for 375 degrees and it was done in about 40 minutes, no foolin' I went back to check on it and there was no water. The rice was tender to taste and well seasoned. I will make this again very soon. Thanks

This is an easy dish but it needs a little more salt or flavor.  I may add bouillon or granules next time.

SO yum!! I LOVE mushrooms, but my husband is allergic. So I divided all the ingredients and put them into two smaller dishes. I made his without mushrooms and the flavor was still very good! For mine, I used real mushrooms and sauteed them for a short time, as other reviewers recommended. Will DEFINITELY be using again!

This was really good and really easy (put all ingredients together in a rice cooker).  We paired it with the "Breaded Ranch Chicken" recipe from this website + some brocolli.  Also, no French Onion soup in the house, so we used Cream of Mushroom soup instead.  Really tasty!  Will make again.

I didn't have any french onion soup and used two cans of beef broth.  Very easy and tasty.  I think next time I will add some onion and also green pepper cut in strips.  Give it some color and more zip. I cut cooking time by 15 minutes and sprayed my pan with pam so it wouldn't stick.

I had no soup, so I used 1/2 pkg onion soup mix, undrained mushrooms and about 1/2 c water. Mine cooked way faster than 60 minutes. Very good liked by all.

This was super-easy to make. Since our household love mushrooms I doubled the amount and it received rave reviews. My only complaint is that it's pretty fatty, so try to use good-for-you broth/boullion and cut the butter in half. Everyone asks for it now!

I wasn't too big on this dish, but nearly everyone who came to Thanksgiving dinner really liked it.  My brother had 3 big helpings, and the leftovers went home with my niece (I had to substitute the beef broth with water due to her being vegetarian).  I used long grain brown rice and condensed cream of celery soup instead of cream of onion.

Delicious...thanks for posting. Did swap the soup for cream of mushroom as posted by another. I would imagine it would be great either way. Just a personal preference on my part. Thought it would make it creamier.

This was very good.  I followed another readers suggestion about substituting cream of mushroom soup in place of the onion soup.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms in place of can mushrooms along with the onion & garlic that was suggested.  My husband loved it, but I felt there was something missing......
Definitely try this one it is good.

Very yummy if you are a mushroom fan like me.  As others stated I used brown rice and it took longer than the 60 minutes.  About another 30 minutes for me.  I would probably use the low sodium broth next time.  I am not a cook and this is as easy as it gets!  I sautéed fresh mushrooms in olive oil and used half the butter.  I am sure it would be fine with even less butter. Love it!

The family loved it. The only thing I did differently was I used fresh mushrooms which I sautéed in butter and garlic. My son, who normally doesn't like mushrooms,  told me he like how the mushrooms were soft from the sautéing.

Delicious... I had to transfer the dish to a pot & cook it on the stovetop halfway through because it seemed to be taking longer than expected when doubling the recipe, but the finished product was well worth the wait! Will definitely make again.

Super easy to make. The adults loved it, the kids didn't. :-(  I loved the beef flavor.  I wonder if fresh mushrooms would help. I'd make it again as a side, but in addition to other sides as well.  And I might jazz it up with fresh veggies. We'll see. Thanks!

I never cook and decided to make this as my first dish and it was great! I followed some of the reviews and used cream of mushroom, sautéed the mushrooms first and it came out great after an hour in the oven. Thank you so much for a wonderful easy first time cooking experience!

Soooo so easy and delicious!! I needed a good side dish for a potluck so I doubled the recipe. I was pressed for time, knowing that the bake time would take longer with a double batch, so I combined everything in a pot, got it all boiling together for about 10 minutes, then put it in the 13x9 dish to finish baking. 60 minutes was perfect, the rice nice and tender. This is the kind of dish people think takes a lot of work. I received so many compliments and recipe requests. It was kind of embarrassing when I told them how easy it was!

My mother before me and I have made this recipe as shown (except bake time as 45 mins) with our Brisket for years and our family won't let us serve brisket without this side dish.  If we double it, we bake it 60 mins.  We love it and it so easy!

Very tasty! I used brown rice, a cup of fresh sliced portobello mushrooms instead of canned, and vegetable rather than beef broth.
Brown rice takes 90 minutes. However at sixty minutes, you might want to stir the contents. For example, my mushrooms were on the top and needed to be stirred in.

I've been making this dish for years. Always a big hit at potlucks and family gatherings. 
 I use 1 can beef consume, 1 can French onion soup, 1/4 cup melted butter and one can of sliced mushrooms with liquid (optional).  I pour the cup of uncooked rice (NOT instant rice) in bottom of 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Mix soups, mushrooms with liquid with melted butter in a bowl and pour on top of rice. DO NOT MIX WITH RICE. Bake 350 for 50 minutes. The rice absorbs the liquids. Great with grilled fish and wild game recipes!!

I cooked this recipe in a rice cooker and I even used less beef broth and condensed onion soup mix because it looked like way to much liquids and it still came out a pile of mush.  I am trying to fix it right now by spreading the mush out on a baking sheet pan and cooking it at 300 degree to try to pull some of the moisture out but I also realize that it was very bland (I added some salt) AND it is REALLY greasy.  I've been moving the rice from one side of the baking sheet to the other side while wiping the baking sheet off of the other side to try to reduce the oil in the food.  Probably won't be making this again.

I've been making this super easy mushroom rice dish for years. I LOVE it for its salty flavor and ease of preparation. It also looks gorgeous coming out of the oven, almost like you had it on broil, with how the top layer of the rice and mushrooms get dark and golden. Great recipe, thanks!

I first heard about this recipe in the 70s.  I have updated it to a bit healthier version by using brown rice.
1 cup brown rice.
1 can cream of mushroom soup.
1 onion or dehydrated onion flakes.
Chives.
2 1/2 cups either low sodium beef or chicken broth.
1/4 cup of butter.

I use the pressure cooker with a removable insert. It only takes about 35 minutes for brown rice.  

You can cook it in the oven at 350 for 60 minutes or until rice is done( BR takes longer).  

Sauted mushrooms, cooked ground beef are optional towards the end. 
 
A bit of parmesean cheese at the end gives a huge Yum as well.

Super easy and delish! I added browned ground beef and it was perfect in about an hour and ten. Also I used fresh mushrooms but I am sure either would be great.

This is very easy and a good accompaniment to beef.  I used canned mushrooms, which I thought were very good, although I chopped them up a little before adding to the rice mixture.  Will definitely make again.

I accidentally bought chicken broth...per the advice of others, I opted to buy cream of mushroom soup instead of the French onion..and I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and it turned out awesome!  My husband loved it.  I'm going to try it again with the beef broth, but wasn't disappointed with the chicken!

I changed this recipe a lot.  First of all I used 1 cup of rice, 2 cups of Beef Broth(sodium free), one package of French onion soup mix, and an 8 ounce can of mushrooms.  I just threw it all into the rice cooker, turned it on a normal cycle, and ta-da DELICIOUS!

Great Recipe...Great taste. Next time I will strain some of the onions out of the soup, and add some parsley at the end. So you know, it came out of the oven slightly liquidy, but thickened up nicely. Used Uncle Ben's and it was perfectly cooked after 60 minutes.

I made the rest of my dinner to be ready when this was and I was highly disappointed because this was NOT ready after 1 hour in the oven.  I ended up leaving it in for 1 hour 20 minutes.  It tasted ok, the french onion soup was a really strong flavor.

I did not like this at all! I am very surprised with the ratings, but it was so "SUPER SALTY." In addition, I baked it for one hour and it looked like rice soup. There is another similar recipe on here that says to bake at 425. So, I uncovered it and stuck it back in the oven at that temperature for another 25 minutes. When it was done the color was almost gray brown and looked unappetizing. The dish also tasted a lot like "boxed rice-a-roni," which I really did not expect, especially for a 1 1/2 hour dish! I was leary of making this with the 3 canned ingredients, but the reviews were still pretty good. But, the rice never asborbed the salty taste of the 3 canned items. I dislike rating recipes this low. But, the after taste of this was like opening a salt packet and eating it straight. The dish was an unfortunate waste of ingredients as it got tossed.

After I adjusted the recipe ... this is worth 10 stars!!!  First of all: I don't even LIKE rice. I made this for my BF who loves rice and mushrooms and risotto is tedious in the summer. From the first bite into my mouth I was in Mushroom Rice Heaven.   I used 1 cup uncooked rice. I did not need to cook it for more than an hour. I used raw, organic rice.   I used MUCH less butter. Maybe less than 2TBL and added about 1-2 TBL of grapeseed oil. It wasn't missed.   Instead of beef broth I made my own vegetarian broth using the Better Than Bouillon brand(which I swear by) and 10.5 oz water.   I sauteed 1 med yellow onion, 1 clove of garlic and one regular package of raw cremini mushrooms. (Diced onions, sliced mushrooms). I cooked this in the fat amount I mentioned... added the rice after it was cooked, sauteed a minute or two... then added the liquid ingredients. Instead of using French Onion soup I used Cream of Mushroom. I stirred it up, popped it into the oven and I will be making this again and again. It was an easy side. Went great with steak and snap peas.   My BF actually announced: "If this is so easy, how come its not taking over the world? I should see this on every menu!!!"

So easy!  Tasty.  I sauteed button and cremini mushrooms in the butter.  I used french onion soup this time but want to try cream of mushroom and regular mushroom soup.

This dish is sooooo easy and sooooo delicious! The only thing I do differently is substituting cream of mushroom soup since I am not an onion fan. This has become a go to dish for me!

My husband loved this. Asked me how I made it... as if he cooks. :-) I've never seem him eat rice so fast; first thing off his plate. This was a little salty so i'll use low sodium soups next time but it's a keeper.

Yummy! I did make a some changes to accommodate what I had on hand. I used fresh mushrooms, and sauteed them with the onions & garlic in butter. I used cr. of chicken soup & veggie broth, and used basmatti rice. It took about 1 1/2 hours to cook due to the type of rice, but well worth it. Recipe is very forgiving & easy to change to fit each families likes/dislikes. This one is a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not a big rice fan, but was asked to make a rice dish for my M-I-L's Mother's Day Dinner and found this recipe.  WOW, is all I can say.  My mom was upset that I didn't make her any, so I ended up making 2-9x13 dishes (one for M-I-L/one for mom).  The only thing I did differently w/my mother's was to add ground pork.  It basically turned the recipe into a filling meal.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Karen~

Wonderful recipe. It was so easy. I have had in my refrigerator for three days and I am still eating it. I used fresh mushrooms which worked perfectly fine. A great side to baked chicken.

I went with the other reviewers and used a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of chicken stock and sauted a package of fresh mushrooms/chopped onions/3 cloves minced garlic in the butter and mixed all with the rice and baked for 1 hour with awesome results.  The bowl was practically licked clean.  Thanks so much..!!

For the amount of effort involved (almost none) this recipe packs wonderful flavor!  I tripled the amount of canned mushrooms.  They settle to the top which makes the dish as tasty-looking as it is tasty.

This was a very easy and yummy recipe...although I admit, I ran out of time to cook it in the oven, so I simmered it on the stove top for about 30 mins and it came out great. Being the spur of the moment cook that I am, I don't always have the right ingredients so I substituted onion soup for onion soup mix, and beef broth for beef boulion. I added 3 1/2 cups of water and the rest of the ingredients and just let it cook....turned out awesome!

we liked this.  should've cooked for about 10 minutes longer I think.  Probably too salty- definitely use lower sodium beef broth.  used a package of fresh, sliced mushrooms.  kids even ate it- shocker!

What an amazing and flavorful way to cook rice as a side dish. And it tastes SO MUCH BETTER than the boxed/prepackaged flavored rice. I used a medley of different mushrooms. It looked so fancy alongside a baked chicken breast and creamy spinach I made. THANKS!

Went with minor changes to recipe - used cream of mushroom soup instead of onion. Used fresh shrooms'. Was worried that uncooked rice in the oven would result in some uncooked - wrong - they were perfectly done - EXCELLENT and easy recipe!.

I loved this. I did make some changes (sorry - had to use what I had on hand). Sauteed mushrooms and onion in the butter, then put in dish with the rice, cream of mushroom and chicken broth. Cooked covered for 1 hour - yummy. My guys don't like rice but they even liked this.

Great easy and delicious. I made few changes: sautéed onions and fresh mushrooms. Also, I added garlic powder, dried parsley and fresh ground pepper. I also substituted the onion soup with mushroom soup, and the beef broth with chicken broth. Even my “hating rice” kid loved it and took seconds.

Was very skeptical on how this was going to come out.  Didn't look so good in the oven and I thought it was going to be very liquidy.  It wasn't at all. It was delicious. Definately a keeper

Just like the Rice-so-Nice recipe on this site. I would recommend cooking in a rice cooker for fluffier rice. Also, I would add garlic. For some fun additions/changes I added cream of mushroom soup, instead of french onion and substitute the beef broth for chicken broth. I like it better with chicken instead of beef.

Yum! Rich. I too sauteed fresh mushrooms with garlic and shallot.  I also used vegetarian bouillon (prepared in water of course) and cream of mushroom soup.  Last bit of changing was with the butter.  I used a bit of canola oil instead. Good recipe.

I followed the suggestions of others and modified this recipe.   I used fresh mushrooms and an onion and minced garlic.   I sauteed them in the butter then added them to the rice with some chicken broth (not beef).    I also used creme of mushroom soup instead of french onion soup.     It was fantastic.   It may become my favorite rice dish.

I expected great things out of this dish but it didn't do much for me.  It was pretty bland, and I probably won't make again.

I have to say that I did not follow the cooking directions on this one.  I did use all of the ingredients, though, so I'm sure the taste was very close to what it should have been.  I had some leftover rice in the fridge that I wanted to use up, so I had to modify the preparation in order to accomodate pre-cooked rice.  I sauteed the mushrooms in the butter (though I only used about 1T).  Then, I added the cooked rice,1/2 cup of beef broth, and a packet of dry onion soup mix.  I simmered until the liquid was gone and the rice was hot.  The results were very good.  My boyfriend went back for seconds!  I'll try this again as suggested in the recipe, but I think, too, that this may be my go-to recipe whenever I have leftover rice.  Thanks so much, Karen!

This was absolutely outstanding! I used 21 oz water (while doubling the recipe) and 1 packet of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix for the beef broth and cream of chicken soup. I used converted rice and it took exactly 60 minutes. I also stirred it 3 minutes before removing from the oven. It looked very "soup-y", but after I stirred it and baked for three more minutes, it came out perfectly. This was a huge hit with our entire family of 10. Everyone declared it a keeper.

Not quite what I was looking for.  Would probably prefer this recipe made with real mushrooms and sauteed onions rather than processed ingredients.

Wow...I just pulled this out of the oven and cannot stop nibbling on it!  Tastes great and very easy to put together.  I used brown rice, condensed cream of chicken soup, 14 oz can of beef broth, a few Tbsp of butter and on can of mushrooms.  Next time I will double the mushrooms.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this.I was afraid it might be too salty. But was just right, reduced the amount of butter, next time will grease the casserole dish to make clean up easier. What a nice side dish to put in the oven along with a baked meat main dish, that's a change from a baked potato.

This is the same recipe that my mom has been making since I was little.  It's super easy to make and so good.  My guests are always impressed and always ask for the recipe.  The only difference is that I use 1 beef bouillon cube with 9-10 oz. of water instead of the can of beef broth.  This is a definite keeper!

Delicious! The only problem is that it is very high in sodium.  Try to use lower sodium products (soud and broth) if possible.  I have also used barley instead of rice and definately increased the mushrooms for my taste.

This is a recipe that I learned from my mother 60 years ago.  We have always browned the rice in the butter in an oven proof dish before baking. I use fresh mushrooms and saute them also with the rice.

I followed the top reviewers advice and I used cream of mushroom soup. Also, I used fresh mushrooms sauteed with some onion and 2 cloves of garlic, and used converted rice. However, I was surprised at how fluffy the rice was at the end. I was definitely expecting a more casserole texture with everything stuck together. So I dumped the dish out into a bowl, added another can of cream of mushroom soup and it's exactly what I was looking for. Very mushroomy and very tasty!

I too used cream of mushroom soup. I also used beef broth made a bouillon cube and added half a packet of Lipton French Onion Soup/Dip Mix. I sauteed fresh mushrooms in the butter and added them to the mix. It was good, but way too salty and not quite creamy enough for me. I think the bouillon along with the dressing mix made it that way though. I'll have to play around with the recipe a little more, but it's so similar to a main dish I make (Chicken & Mushroom Wild Rice Casserole) that I'm not sure I'll be making it that much.

This is one of the best rice recipes that I've come across.  My husband have recently committed to cooking from scratch using brown rice as often as possible.  This one is so yummy!  Easy enough to make: you can do it with one hand if you must (eg: if you're carrying a baby with the other arm).  I also substituted the french onion soup with mushroom soup in a pinch.  I look forward to trying the french onion next time!

It couldn't be any easier to prepare.  My husband cleaned up the night I served it and actually saved the tiny amount that was left because he enjoyed it so much.  I added a little ground red pepper for a little subtle kick.

This recipe was simple and easy and very good. I used fresh mushrooms as opposed to canned and sauted them first. This will continue to be on the menu rotation.

Served this with the Crab Stuffed Chicken Breast and it was a hit.  My husband doesn't like mushrooms and really liked this.  I used Portabellos and followed the recipe to a T.  Will make again...loved that you could just stir together and stick it in the oven!

I didn't have the condensed soup on hand, so I used onion soup mix/water instead.  This was very good and so easy!

I really like this recipe, it is so easy you can turn on your oven to preheat and by the time it hits 350 you have it mixed and ready for the oven.

This can't be easier to make, and it's absolutely great!  I didn't have beef broth, so I used chicken broth.  It was a hit!  Thanks!

It was good as is...but could have used a bit of something else...like little cubes of chicken or cheese...just something more!  Should be a side as is...not a meal.

Very tasty and super easy to make.  I sauteed fresh cremini mushrooms in a little butter before adding everything into the rice cooker and simply turning on.  I also used cream of mushroom soup and a little less butter and it still turned out very creamy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy and tastes great.  It stays very moist and has excellent flavor.  I am a mushroom fan, so I add more into the mix.  Great side dish.

this recipe was absolutely delicious!!! i actaully sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter. i was skeptical about putting uncooked rice in the oven, so I had combined all of the ingredients in my stovetop rice steamer and it came out perfect!! this is definitely a keeper :D

Great rice dish!  One of my friends suggested mixing the rice into the melted butter and then proceed with the other ingredients.  It was so good and I plan to make it again soon.  Thanks.

After baking for an hour the rice was still kind of crunchy.  I think I'll add a little more liquid next time and bake it a little longer...other than that it was pretty good.

Wow!  Easy and tasty!  Made this for company and all loved it.  After reading earlier reviews I was a bit worried about saltiness. I used low sodium broth and 3/4 can of condensed onion soup with 1/4 can water.  That wasnt needed as it was not salty in the least.. I even added a bit at the end.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms in a bit of butter and ommited butter in the baking pan.  Otherwise made as directed.  Thanks!

Love this!  Easy and tastes wonderful. I used fresh mushrooms sauteed in garlic & butter.  The hint of garlic is a great compliment with the mushroom/onion flavor.  This is a keeper!

This was not too bad, but strongly tasted of too much onion.  Next time I wil subsitute beefy mushroom soup in place of the french onion soup.

Fantastic!!!  I sauteed fresh baby portabella mushrooms in two tablespoons butter, instead of canned, and added a little more liquid.  I will definitely make this again.
