This recipe makes fajitas that are addictive! And I ought to know - I'm from Texas! I scaled this to 20 servings for a party and used half the marinade for top round steak and half for chicken breasts.  I used only 1/2 cup water in this re-scaled recipe, and I also threw in a generous handful of chopped fresh cilantro.  It needs the cilantro... that gives it a wonderful kick.  I marinated the meat for 24 hours and then grilled it nice and slow.  It couldn't have been better!  The meat was tender and absolutely perfect.

Wonderful! - Better than our favorite restaurant.  I've never made fajitas at home and had them come out so well.  Followed the recipe as given.  Marinaded chicken tenders for about 8-9 hours - was plenty of time.  I used my new grill pan skillet and grilled the chicken in just a tiny bit of the marinade.  When that was done, I took them out, put a little more marinade in the pan, and grilled a large sliced onion and both a red and green bell pepper, cut into strips.  Added a little more olive oil and cajun spice while the veggies gooked.  Best fajita meal ever!

Made this with chicken tenders and let them marinate over night.  I swapped out the soy sauce for Lea & Perrin's, doubled the cayenne, added half a teaspoon of cumin, and a few jalapeno slices.  I also left out the salt.  I was expecting this to be a little spicier than it was, but the flavor was great.  I was worried my mom would think it was too spicy, but surprisingly not (my dad and brother liked it, too, so the heat level must have been just right to please everybody).  If I were making this recipe for myself, I'd probably add even more cayenne, but then, I am pretty crazy.  The only complaint I have (and not enough to bump it down to 4 stars) is that prep time for me was a lot longer than 15 minutes.  I guess if you start with your limes already squeezed (or juice from a bottle) and your chicken already cut up and stuff, it might take 15 minutes, but if you have to take those into account, it'll probably take a little longer.  Or I could just be slow, since it took me around an hour. ;)  I'll have to do this with steak next time.  I made two pounds of chicken, and usually when we have fajitas, there's chicken left over the next day.  Not this time!  Too bad, because I was looking forward to quesadillas for lunch tomorrow.  Oh well!

Perfectly wonderful marinade!  I have never used the liquid smoke and it's still great.  I've changed the water to other things...beer, wine, veggie broth...all work well.  Also, lemon subs very nicely for lime in a pinch.

Great fajita marinade for chicken! I omitted the water and added 1/4 tsp. of cumin. I poked the chicken with a fork serveal times, put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight, turning it serveral times during the marinating process. It was so good grilled over charcoal! We served it on warm tortillas with all the fixen's: peppers, onions, shredded cheese, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.

This is good, but I think too much water is called for.  If I made it again, I would probably omit the water altogether.  It literally watered down the flavor.  I had to add extra lime, garlic, and pepper.  Then, it was good.  But three stars for the recipe as-is.  I made chicken fajitas with green and red bell pepper, and red onions in whole-grain toritllas, and heirloom tomatoes, sharp cheddar, lite sour cream and sliced avocado on top.

THIS WAS GREAT!!!  My husband wanted to have a "Fajita BBQ" so we invited the whole family (both sides) over and tried this recipe with 7 lbs. of fajita meat!!! I have to say I HATE trying new recipes when we have parties but I bit the bullet on this one and it turned out WONDERFUL!  We got so many rave reviews and my husband has been begging me every weekend to make more fajitas.  The only addition I made in the recipe is I added 1/2 c. chopped fresh cilantro cause I love the flavor of it and marinated overnight.  They turned out awesome!!  I thought for sure I would be left with a ton of leftover meat, considering I always over estimate, but we had a small handful left, which my husband nibbled on after the guests all left. I will definately be using this recipe again, my husband wants to laminate the recipe!!!  KUDOS ROBBIE!!

This was WONDERFUL!!! I did make a few easy changes I increased the soy sauce  to 4 tsp. and left out the salt. I also added 1/2 tsp chili powder and used about 1 and 1/2 tsp cayenne. It was quite spicy and VERY flavorful!!!

I really was so excited for this because I love steak fajitas so so much, but have never actually made them myself.  I found this really limey, and not really that spicy. I will admit I didn't use as much liquid smoke as it called for, because I have never used it and it smelled really strong. Maybe that would have taken away some of the lime taste because it needed something more.  Thanks for the recipe anyway. Maybe I will try it again exactly as written and see if I like it better.

This is a GREAT marinade!  I used it with chicken. The first time I made it as written and the family loved it.  The next time I tweaked it a bit to my family's preferences and added 2 T more of lime, a handful of fresh chopped cilantro, and 1 1/2 t of cumin.  I added red and yellow peppers and an onion to the marinade and let it sit for 12 hours.  My mouth is watering while I type this.  It is now a family fave and will be in the weekly rotation.  Thanks, Robbie!  *NOTE*: The last time I made this recipe I was in a hurry and threw everything together in a matter of minutes.  I didn't have Liquid Smoke, so I used Tabasco Brand Chipolte sauce for the smoky flavor.  I didn't really have time to accurately measure the ingredients, and poured straight from the bottle into the marinade.  I was a little nervous about how it was going to turn out.  I marinaded the chicken and held out a little marinade to use for the onions and red, orange, and yellow peppers.  It turned out to be fantastic!  I don't think you can go wrong with this marinade!

My family loved this recipe and i have already being asked when will i be doing it again.. I added 1/2 cup of cilantro and a sprinkle of cumin for a more authentic kick.  I fried the chicken and added green bell peppers and opions towards the end.  I placed all the ingrediants into a tortilla wrap with avacado, grated cheese and sour cream..  It was mouth watering delight.  Good job.

Left out the liquid smoke and the cayenne.  With these omissions, five stars.  Light, flavorful, but not overpowering.

My review might not be fair since I did make a change. I had no liquid smoke so I change it to 2 tbsp. of Chipotle sauce. I marinaded steak slices for 30 hours and it came out with very little flavour. In the end I had to add a pkg of fajita seasoning. The steak was extemely tender. Maybe chicken would be better. I don't think I will make again though.

ohhh boy! this marinade was absolutely delicious.  definitely add the cumin, coriander, and cilantro and use a whole teaspoon of cayenne.  i only used 1 lime b/c i didnt want mine to turn out too tangy.  i used a cheap piece of top round steak meat and the marinade made the meat taste better than NY strip.  save the marinade and use it when you sautee bell peppers and onions for your fajita topping. EDIT: just want to add that i have used this marinade at least 10x with USDA choice top round steak that i purchase from costco.  everybody comments on how great it smells whenever i bring it to work for lunch.  i cant get enough of this marinade

I never made Fajitas before so I looked at several different marinade recipes.  This one had the ingredients I was thinking about using.  The only thing I did differently was to use Taquila instead of water and added 1 TBS. dried oregano and 1/4 tsp. dried thyme.  This was soooo good.  My husband, who likes to "tweak" every recipe, said he wouldn't change a thing.  I used this on flank steak but am going to try chicken and shrimp next time.  Great Recipe.

Wow...what a great, fresh-tasting marinade for both meat and vegetables!  It is a thousand times better than store-bought fajita marinades, especially the dry-powder varieties.  I like to add a little more liquid smoke, and cilantro is a must for an extra bit of flavor.

This is wonderful as written.  I halved the recipe because there were just 2 of us for dinner.  I cut a bottom round steak into thin strips and marinated them for about 24 hours, turning them several times.  I then sauteed the beef in a small amount of olive oil and served it over brown rice with grilled vegetable kabobs (yellow and green peppers, onion wedges, and mushrooms - see recipe, this site) and orange slices.  The normally tough cut of beef was tender and delicious.  My adult son kept commenting on how good the meat tasted and asked that I make it for him again.  I will definitely use it again, trying different cuts of meat & chicken, and don't plan to make any changes.

I tried this recipe both the original way written and with the water omitted as suggested in other reviews:  Don't mess with this recipe!  As written, this is a terrific marinade for fajitas!  Increasing the lime juice or reducing the water only drowns out the smokey back-taste that makes this a winner.  Just make those two dashes of smoke heavy-handed dashes.  I've made fajitas using this recipe for flank steak and sliced peppers and onions with wonderful results.  This is a keeper.

I've been using this recipe for over a year, it's THE BEST. I increase the cayenne to 1 tsp and add 1/2 tsp cumin & coriander, and some jalapeno juice. I marinate the meat 8-10 hours. I cook it in a hot skillet, the juice that comes out of the meat will cook down and I add sliced onions just when the juice is almost cooked out, it coats the onions and makes them so yummy!!!! I sprinkle black pepper on it while it's cooking, it will not disappoint.  I always do a pan of sliced top sirloin steak and a pan of chicken, we love both.

This marinade is pretty good.  I didn't add the water as others mentioned.  The only changes I made were using cider vinegar in place of the water, not using liquid smoke, and adding some cumin and coriander(1/2 tsp of each).  We used it on chicken breasts and grilled them. Afterwards we just sliced them up- very tender!  I usually freeze our meat in the marinades so the day we cook, all we have to do i thaw the meat.  After the ckicken was thawed it marinated for about 6 hours in the fridge.  I also sauteed bell pepper and onion using the juices from the marinade- to decrease the amount of oil needed(it's okay to use the marinade the chicken was in since it was heated to boiling temp for a while).  I kept the lid on for a while, allowing the steam to help cook the veggies.  I took it off towards the end to allow them to brown a bit.

Don't let the negative reviews fool you.  This recipe is awesome, especially when using it as a marinade for fajitas!  Serve sauteed pepper strips and sliced onions along with it, and you've got some of the most awesome fajitas you'll ever have!  No need to marinate overnight either.  Marinating for 30 minutes to an hour is good enough for very flavorful fajitas!

My sister prepared these fajitas Saturday for her son's graduation dinner and they were delicious!  She left out the smoke seasoning and added cumin.  She also increased the garlic.  Yum!

I'll give this 4 1/2 stars, it would be even better had I grilled the meat. =) 
This marinade is awesome! I was skeptical at first since it didn't even smell like anything (followed the recipe as written) but had some hope since it had rave reviews. I did half chicken and half steak (sliced trip tip) and let it marinade for a few hours. I simply cooked it in a hot pan (wish I had grilled it) and cooked up pepper & onions to go with. It was SOOO good! This will be my go-to recipe for now on.

Awesome.  These were the best fajitas I've ever had.  Did add 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp coriander to the marinade and didn't have soy sauce at the time so substituted Worcestershire - I've made it over and over again always with awesome results.

Fabulous!  I subbed apple juice for the water to give a bit of sweetness, and cut back on the cayenne so the kids would eat it.  I halved the olive oil as others suggested, and added cumin and some Kirkland brand (Costco) Sweet Mesquite seasoning.  They were the best we've ever had by far!

I thought this marinade was great.  Not overpowering as I thought it might be with the liquid smoke.  Made as exactly as stated with top sirloin.  Very delicious.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

This was great! I added a little less cayenne but otherwise didn't change a thing. I cooked up the chicken with green and red peppers, and onions. An easy, delicious meal!

We usually use Fabulosa's Marinade, but I didn't have any on hand so I tried this and was very pleased with it. All of the ingredients are things people usually have on hand - I didn't have any fresh limes or even regular bottled lime juice, so I used key lime juice and it was still good. I liked the fact that it didn't leave our meat as "mushy" as bottled marinades can sometimes do. The cayenne and black pepper are just the right amounts to give it a kick without being overpowering.  I used the recipe with a pound of beef.  Very good and from now on we'll have this for a cost of pennies rather than paying $2.50 for bottled stuff.  Thanks for submitting the recipe.

Being from Texas, I've tasted all sorts of fajitas from the bland, the peppered, and the citrus. This falls in the citrus category so keep that in mind if you don't like that sort of taste. 

I made these exactly as written and marinated a beef skirt cut of meat (1-1/2 lbs) for around 5-6 hours. While flavored well, the meat was kind of tough so I would marinade it more next time (possibly overnight). Keep in mind, a beef skirt cut is thin and is what a majority of the southwestern fajitas are made of. 

Since my family likes the citrus marinades, I will up the quantity of lime next time and scale down the liquid smoke flavoring. We found the smoke flavoring to be a little overpowering. 

This is a good "base" recipe for many cuts of meat which I will try later.

I thought this was great!  I have tried other fajita marinades and found them bland, but I liked the bite of lime, the liquid smoke and the garlic of this one.  I made steak fajitas from top sirloin and marinaded them for a few hours and it came out tender and flavorful.  I did add some chili powder and more cayenne to the skillet but that was it.  I will use definitely use this again!

Have used this several times...always on short notice so no time to marinade. I just throw everything with the chicken once it is no longer pink and it still turns out great!

Delicious, and great for camping! I cooked the chicken and put onions, green pepper and red pepper in the marinade with it overnight. I put the sealed ziplock bag into the cooler, and we took it out at the campsite and cooked it in tinfoil. Awesome meal with hardly any dishes!

The first time I made it was a little spicy for me. The second time I left out the cayenne pepper, and added some chili powder and cumin. Great either way!! Will try adding some Tequila next time!

this was really easy and smelled good, but some of the flavor was lost by the time it cooked. my husband would have preferred it to be more spicy and he mentioned he wouldn't have used olive oil.

Thanks for this wonderful marinade recipe!  I used black pepper and crushed red pepper spice since I didn't have cayenne pepper.  Nice tender steak with a little kick!  I also don't use liquid smoke since it may not be good for the body.  On the toasted tortilla I put on about a tablespoon of sour cream, then the steak, the sauteed onions and peppers, some salsa and a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese.  You can even add spinach if you like to, you'll hardly know it is there! 
 Thank you, thank you!  We are beef farmers and I never knew what to do with all the sirloin steaks we get.  Now they'll get used up first instead of last!

I used this recipe at our firehouse and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone wanted the recipe from me, and there wasn't a single bit of leftover. A great bonus is that it is all made inside a throw-away container (gallon resealable bags) and you just toss the veggies, meat and marinade together! Super easy and great flavor! We will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

I made Fajitas last week for my Mothers birthday "Mexican Fiasco" (we call it that because it is a fiasco when the whole family gets together..ha!)  She absolutely LOVED this.  I used 3# chicken and 3# of steak (round steak & believe it or not it came out tender) and there was only a little of each left over, which my Mom took home.  Thanks for the easy & great marinade Roberta!!

I used sliced turkey thigh meat in this recipe, the only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp additional mesquite flavored liquid smoke, they were terrific!  My husband (an Aussie) repeatedly asks for these when we have company, to show off my American cooking skills! :)

Personally I would rather cook myself than go out to eat , with a marinade and recipies like this , I know my food will taste better and cheaper than going out. I have tried this 2 times , first as written then tweaked it a bit tonite, added a bunch of chopped cilantro and extra garlic and some orange juice to the marinade, it was cold here tonite I n east tn, yes I grill by flashlight when I have to, the smell of the veggies I grilled first( marinated red , green bell peppers with onions in with the meat) was incredible, then it threw on the strip steaks, this recipie is friggin great

My entire family LOVES this, lots of flavor but not real spicy. I substituted the lime juice for lemon juice because that is what I had on hand. I made a double batch and used half as a marinade, and I simmered my steak, bell peppers and onions in the other half.

fantastic!!  I marinaded boston steaks for this recipe and thinly sliced the  meat while it was still frozen.  This will make it into the regular rotation.  I also cut way back on the liquid smoke to make it toddler friendly

I would use a little less lime juice and add some other spices (cumin & coriander come to mind). I didn't cayenne, so I subbed a hot chili powder. I marinated chicken for 2 hours and cooked it in a hot skillet (but this would be way better grilled!). I like the addition of the liquid smoke to get the "bbq" flavour, but nothing beats actual "char".

I made a variety of kabobs for my husband's fantasy football draft party.  He is a fajita enthusiast so I created fajita kabobs just for him.  I marinated the steak, chicken, peppers, and onions (in separate gallon- and quart-sized bags) overnight.  The flavor was wonderful, exactly what my husband loves.  He and his friends could not get enough and kept thanking me for the delicious food.

Excellent! I had to use worcestershire because I was out of soy sauce and it still turned out great. (Also, It was enough to marinate 3 lbs of chicken.)

This is a good marinade as written, but I took a few of the suggestions from prior reviewers and added a few of my own tweeks. First, I noticed that a few reviewers thought that the water took away from the flavor of the marinade. Basically 'watering' it down. So I added 1/3 cup of orange pop! I know...what the...? Well, I didn't feel like going to the store to find something else more appropriate, like orange juice or the like. I happened to have a bottle of orange pop, so I just added some of that in place of the water. The only other adjustments I made was to add a bit of cumin, I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and just a couple dashes of liquid smoke instead of 1/2 teaspoon. Liquid smoke is very strong, and I noticed that a lot of people found that even 1/2 tsp was overpowering. Everything else in the recipe I followed exactly. I marinated 2 flank steaks for about 4 hours, and my fajita's came out PERFECT. Thank you for the recipe, as I needed a good starting point, and I think this recipe is it!

I didn't have liquid smoke so I omitted it. I also omitted the garlic and added a Tbsp. of Chili Garlic Sauce, 1tsp of cumin, 1tsp. smoked paprika. I marinated steak and chicken all day then grilled it for approximately 30 min. over low heat. Delish!

Love the flavor.  Just want to share how I use this recipe.  I include my vegetables (green & red peppers and onions) in the marinade.  I then take and cook the whole marinated batch in peanut oil with a wok on a turkey cooker.  Just till the water has boiled off and the mixture is cooked through.  From there, I take the mixture and, on high heat with olive oil, cook it on the stovetop until the chicken is golden brown and the vegetables have that nice burnt edges look to them.  Sort of simulates the sizzling platter you see in resturants.  Very delicious and well received by everybody I have shared them with.  Little more time for sure, but I make large batches and freeze most of it (after the wok) for later dates!

This was soooo good.  I used it to marinate flank steak and actually ended up leaving it for about 32 hours since something happened and we weren't able to cook it the first night as planned.  I was worried the meat would be mushy or the flavor too strong, but it turned out perfectly.  My husband kept raving about what a good meal it was.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

Used this on chicken, and it was a bright, tangy, delicious marinade.  Aside from the cilantro, I had every ingredient in my pantry, so it was easy to throw together.  The chicken was best served immediately after cooking.

It might have helped if I could have grilled the meat but rain prevented grilling, so I broiled it in the oven.  I like my fajitas a little spicier as well.  I marinated the meat for a full 24 hours but it was just not as flavorful as I had hoped.  It was a good home made fajita but I been searching for that restuarant quality recipe.

I made this for my Cinco de Mayo party and it was a big hit.  The only change I made was substituting a good tequila (100% agave) for the water.  It was gone in the blink of an eye.

Really good. I thought it could have been spicier, but my kids thought it was perfect.  I still gave it 5 stars because I think spice is a matter of preference. I loved the combination of flavors this doesn't even compare to pre-packaged mixes.

I highly recommend this recipe. I made a couple of changes and thought it was perfect. I substituded cumin for the black pepper and left out the water. I deboned a store bought rotiserie chicken (probably about 1 pound of meat) and marinated it 24 hours. I wasnt sure how it would be with precooked chicken but it made fantastic fajitas.

I made a couple changes to this recipe- 1) I used 50% lemon juice and 50% lime juice. 2) I eliminated the liquid smoke flavoring. 3) I only used 1/4 cup water.  I marinaded my steak overnight in it.  Next time I would probably add a little less citrus juice, I found it to be a little much.   But overall, the meat had good flavor.

Update: I tried the recipe again, using all the listed ingredients, except cayenne pepper and liquid smoke flavoring.  Marinated chicken breasts and a very thin steak.  Grilled the meats after about 3 hrs.  Chicken was great!  Next time will use a thicker steak. 

Update- 3/30/11- I used this recipe on chicken breasts (left out the liquid smoke flavoring), I marinated them overnight and then cooked them on my indoor grill and they were delicious!!!

These fajitas are awesome!
I used Chicken Breast tenders so that everything would cook pretty evenly and quickly. The first small batch I cooked had only marinated for about 2.5 hours and they were great. The rest I cooked the next day and they were wonderful as well. Great flavor. I made the following changes: 
Cut the water to 1/4 cup
added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 C chopped fresh cilantro, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp chili powder. I upped the soy sauce to 4 tsp. I had no cayenne pepper on hand so instead used 1/2 tsp hot sauce. I'm not fond of anything too spicy and this turned out fine. If you like things spicy you'd need to up the cayenne. Next time I make it I might up the salt just a tad, when eaten alone the chicken lacks a little salt. However, I grilled all this in just a fry pan with olive oil and after I finished the chicken I threw in the onions and bell pepper with a tad more olive oil. I also had set aside about 2 oz. of the marinade and used it when grilling the onions/bell peppers and they were fantastic. I'm sure I will make this often.

Had to edit my original review, and changed it to 5 stars.

Great as is, but didn't use liquid smoke. Mexican friends of mine said it tasted like home, except they would use something called Maggi seasoning (a liquid) instead of the liquid smoke.

To make fajitas:
1. We used rump steak and let marinade for most of the day (6-8 hours)
2. heat a flat BBQ plate to stir-fry heat. You really need a hot BBQ to get the best results
3. Start cooking peppers & onions with a little oil until half-cooked
4. Squeeze meat well to get rid of extra marinade. Add to vegies on the BBQ and stir fry until done. 
5. DEVOUR! Had both flour and corn tortillas, pico de gallo and chuncky guacomole to serve. Fantastico!

This is a nice, simple marinade.  I used it with flank steak that I grilled after marinating, but this would be great with chicken or pork as well.  A keeper!

This was decent - but not wonderful. I felt that the water may have diluted the marinade too much. The meat didn't really have a lot of flavor - even after marinating overnight. I think there are some good things about this recipe - but it definitely needs some tweaking. I am going to try substituting tequila for the water and adding some fresh chopped cilantro and brown sugar. Maybe some cumin, too.

I made this for my son's 16th birthday party and used for steak quesadillas and chicken fajitas. Both were very good but the quesadillas were the first to go, the kid's loved them!! I took the advise of others and substituted worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce. Thank's for a great marinade!

I used this recipe the other night for some fajitas.  I have never made fagitas at home, always eaten then out.  The whole thing turned out wonderul-we thought there was more lime juice then needed though, the lime kind of was overpowering.  We will make it again for sure, but I will be adding less lime juice.  Thank you for sharing.

The next time I make this, I will definitely eliminate the ingredient "water".  This totally took all the flavor away from the marinade, watering it down.  I would also increase the amount of spices I add, to make it more flavorful.

Really good marinade.  I will be making this again.  I did use a little less water.

This was so good! I omitted the water and added a splash of cider vinegar and a bit of cilantro, and I only added a dash of cayenne. I later realized the recipe called for four cloves of garlic - I thought it was only one. It still turned out great. I marinated sirloin steak for about 8 hrs. I then broiled the steak. I sautéed bell peppers and onions. I boiled the used marinade and added a couple splashes of it to the peppers and onions. Then I sliced the steak and threw it all together with some fresh cilantro. Thanks for the recipe. It was so much better than using the packaged powder seasoning!

Absolutely amazing!!  Best chicken fajitas I've ever had!!  Only thing I do different is add a bushel of fresh cilantro leaves and a jalapeño or 2 just for kicks it is mouthwatering and delicious.  Try this one you will not regret it!

TOo much lime-y flavor. It is quite regular and nothing out of the ordinary for me. I DID NOT have the liquid smoke, so maybe that's where it's at.

This was really good.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro.  I used this tonight with beef fajitas and it was awesome.  This would be a great marinade, even if you weren't making fajitas.

This was simply delicious.  I eliminated the cayenne because my 8 year old doesn't do spicy.  I let it sit for only 3 hours because the skirt steak I had was very thin.  It turned out to be just right....not over/underwhelming.

I know this marinade is meant for meat, but it is excellent on veggies as well! I make the recipe as written and mix it up with sliced portabella caps, different colored bell peppers, and onions. Then I put it in one of those vacuum containers and let it sit for a few hours. Grill it up and enjoy! Cilantro does complement the marinade's flavor well, but I just serve it on the side. For reasons I'll never understand, some people don't like cilantro. I'm convinced that this marinade could make even dirt taste great. Five stars all the way!

Just made this. Followed recipe except added 1/4 t cumin and 1/8 t red pepper because my family is sensitive to spices. Very good and tender chicken. Will make again! Very easy and my husband wanted me to try another marinade.

I did this with chicken tonight, it only soaked for 1 1/2 hours, 1/2 of that was out of the fridge and it was perfect and moist and yummy.
Oh, and I used lemon juice and it was still fabulous.

We really liked this marinade. I followed the recipe to the best of my ability with what I had on hand. I used avocado oil (if you haven't tried it, you should!) and omitted the liquid smoke, as I had none. I reduced the cayenne by a bit, because we're wimps. I marinated my chicken for about 7-8 hours then cooked the chicken in marinade until it was browned then added our choice of veggies. I used all of the marinade and let it cook down while meat and veggies were cooking. Very tasty and chicken was tender! Thank you for sharing!

I don't recommend leaving this overnight, as the meat can actually start to get a little tough. I always add cilantro and season the meat with fajita seasoning before putting on the grill.

This was one of the best meals I have enjoyed making. Along with fresh guacamole and pan fried onion and peppers it beats any restaurant fajita. I can't wait to do it for a dinner party with a jug of Margaritas to accompany!
Must add some cilantro to this is the only thing to make it magic.

This is the best marinade I've ever had.  My husband and I use it on chicken breasts and steak.  With the steak we add a little bit of white wine vinegar and cilantro and with the chicken we add cilantro and extra lime juice. The chicken comes out juicy and moist every single time.  We use if for everything as a marinade and not just fajitas!  A +!

This marinade was excellent made exactly as written.  My 17yr old son made fajitas at school a few days ago & wanted to make them for me, but forgot the recipe.  All he could tell me was it had soy sauce in it, so I search & found this recipe.  My son raved about it  & told me to add it to my "favourites" recipe book.  It was not too spicy, not too heavy on the lime....just perfect!!!

Followed exactly except for when I realized I was out of liquid smoke.  This is so delicious! I used a 1.75lb skirt steak and 1lb uncooked, frozen shrimp.  If I used those quantities again, I may make another half batch of the marinade so everything is generously covered.  It was wonderful the way it was though! Thank you!

Delicious, easy marinade!  I marinated chicken and shrimp (separately of course) in this marinade and both turned out great.  I left out the liquid smoke and kept everything else the same.  Will definitely make again and again!

I made this with steak last night and it was amazing. It was the first time I've ever made fajitas at home. I reduced the amount of water slightly, and only put in 1/2 teaspoon salt, but otherwise followed the recipe. Very good, will be making this again.

Very good - nice flavor.  I didn't use liquid smoke because i grilled using lump charcoal which gives it a smokey flavor.  This was easy to make, and I had everything on hand.

This was a successful, yummy marinade. I used chicken breast cut up and marinaded it for 1.5 hrs. I only didnt give it 5 stars, because 5 stars is mouth watering amazing. This is good, but not 5 star worthy. I would add cilantro next time.

Tasted mostly like Liquid Smoke.  I think if I were to try this again, I would just leave the Liquid Smoke totally out of the entire thing.  If I want a smokey flavor, I'll just put my fajita meat on the grill.

Pretty good probably could have used a little less water or more lime juice. Fajitas night was a hit!

This stuff is great!! We use it to make veggie fajitas - I just put everything in the bag after I chop it and add whatever meat substitute we're using and let it sit for a few hours. Dump it all in the skillet and cook it until it starts to brown. Sometimes I add fresh cilantro to the mix, but it's really not necessary... the recipe is awesome as it is!

The oil:water:lime juice ratio is spot-on, and the liquid smoke is a really key ingredient for the restaurant fajitas I am trying to replicate. There arn't any spicy/pepper/herb/seasoning notes though, which we did miss even with the garlic and smoke flavor: it seemed to be lacking something. Whether you go for spicy or not I think an addition or two of flavor is needed to really make the meal memorable. Thanks very much for sharing.

Followed recipe as written and found these were just bland to me. I should've doubled the recipe as I didn't think it was nearly enough for a 1.5lb Flank steak let alone 3lbs. So I made it twice & put each Flank Steak into it's own Zip lock along with the marinade. Everyone liked them & ate more than a few helpings but said these were good but lacking something. Didn't taste anything like restaurant Fajitas, but were just ok. Thank you for the recipe. May try it again with a few changes.

Based on the recommendations of other reviewers, I have adapted the recipe and really enjoy it now. My husband and I enjoy foods with a bit of "kick". I have reduced the amount of water, added jalepeno peppers, cilantro, cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper. I do not use the smoke flavouring.

Pretty good.  Gotta cook it slow on the grill.  First time Imade it I used higher heat and turned out not as good....more blackened.  Cooked on low 11 minutes and then flipped it for 8 minutes on med.

I liked this recipe, with the exception of the liquid smoke, I dont think it needs it plus it adds the wrong flavor to fajitas. I will try it again without the liquid smoke.

Yum! I was also skeptical of the liquid smoke, but it turned out to be delicious (esp since I don't have access to a grill).  No need to add salt, since I think the soy sauce/lime is enough.  I'll definitely use this again!

I was a little skeptical about this marinade at first but it turned out amazing! I made my family fajitas after marinating the steak strips for only two hours and they were delicious! There wasn't a scrap of food left after dinner. I did take the advice of one of the other reviewer's and added cilantro. I was great! This marinade is definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic. Per other reviews, I added 1/2 t each of chili powder and cumin. I'm trying to watch sodium intake, so I deleted the salt. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I like to use flank steak and marinade it overnight.  I toss it in a hot pan, with the marinade, add sliced peppers and onions and cook it up.  If there are any leftovers, I thicken the sauce and we spoon it over rice.  I do like to add hot peppers or hot sauce for a little kick though.  The lime is the key and I always squeeze fresh, I never use the bottled stuff.

This is an excellent marinade.  We loved that it has a little zing to it with the cayenne pepper. We didnt have the liquid smoke but it was still great.  I brushed it on some large portobella caps and let sit for 10 minutes before grilling and it make fantastic vegetarian fajitas.

I made some really good fajitas with this marinade!  I was cooking for company so I halved the cayenne pepper after reading reviewers who said it was spicy.  Also, I used less marinade on my meat because I sliced it before marinating and was afraid the flavor would be too strong for small slices - however, next time I'll dump all of it in.  Also, not that it's a big deal but why does the recipe yield say 2 cups?  It barely makes one.

I used this on top sirloin and it was very good.  (I also followed earlier folks' advice and replaced the soy sauce with Lea Perrins.)  I was worried when I sampled the meat off the grill (don't overcook!) because it was quite spicy.  It did, though, mellow out and blend well with the other flavors once the steak was smothered in onions, peppers, guacamole and sour cream within a tortilla.  Will make a gain.

I haven't tried fajitas at home before, but due to the cost of them out, hubby's frequent desire to eat them, I thought we needed to try. These are easy and DELISH!! Have made them twice, most everything I have on hand, so that was one of the main reasons I chose this recipe, my husband LOVED them, if you don't like too much heat, cut the cayenne pepper to half. We thought it was good and won't change a thing. THANX!!

Very good.  I like that there isn't a lot of oil.  I used lemon juice because it was all I had.  Lime probably would have been better.

If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would. It's okay. I marinated overnight and then all of the next day and it just seemed like it wasn't anything special. Did not have a strong flavor. I used Top Sirloin beef which I expected to be great, but I was a little disappointed. Thanks anyway!

Delicious!  We have marinated both steak and chicken overnight and received wonderful reviews from friends and family.  I have also substituted lemons for limes.  The marinate has a little more zip, but still very good!

this is a wonderful marinade.  I did do a little tweaking to it.  I substituted worchestershire sauce for the soy sauce simply because we don't care for soy sauce.  I also added 2 tsp of liquid smoke, 1/2 tsp each of onion powder and cumin. I used a round steak and it was VERY tender, which surprised me. I did not think there was too much lime juice either, maybe the worchestershire sauce conteracted it, but it was very good! I am going to try and marinate some rib eyes and brisket in this and see how they do!

Ok I have never made this as published. I am not fond of Smoke Flavoring, but other then that I follow the recipe. I like to marinate it for no less then 4 hours, but the longer the better. The meat turns out so good. After searing the outside I make sure to cook it over a low or indirect on the grill. I always make extra and my kids eat fajitas for a few days. The leftovers will barely be gone when they are asking for them again.

This is a very good marinade.  Use it all the time.  It is easy to make, only requires a few simple ingredients, and appeals to a wide variety of taste preferences including kids who tend not to like really spicy.

My family loves some good fajitas, so I decided to attempt them (for the first time) last week. I found this recipe and thought it sounded pretty good. IT WAS AMAZING! I liked these fajitas better than our local restaurant. Definitely a thumbs up, you definitely need to try these. The only thing I did a bit different was cut back a tad on lime juice, water, and cayenne pepper only for our taste. It's all a matter of what you prefer. These are top notch fajitas!

I'm a Texan living in Canada now and there are no Mexican food places here or even much stuff in the grocery stores so I had to learn to make my own.  This recipe is simplicity at it's best, on par with the best fajitas I've ever had in the land of Tex-Mex.  Delicious and Tejas approved.  AATW!

I absolutely loved this marinade. I did tweak it & added 1/4 tsp of cumin and corriander plus fresh cilantro. I marinated a flank steak for about 8 hours and then I grilled the steak. I used the mariade to cook my onions, bell peppers & shimp. Served with hot tortillas, sour cream, avocado & grated cheese. I will definitely use this everytime I make fajitas.

This is an excellent marinade!! My family loved it. It's not real spicy which is great for kiddos, so if you want it spicier, I would add more cayenne pepper and some jalapeños and/or juice. I did add a bit of cumin and cilantro to the marinade. I will definitely use this recipe again!!

This was terrific.  I added cilantro, cumin, red pepper flakes, and used chicken stock in place of the water.  Next time, I will drain the marinade from the meat so it can dry a bit before cooking.  Use the drained marinade to deglaze the pan and flavor the veggies.  Yum.

This is a great & easy marinade, I use it on steak and chicken and it always makes the meat tender & juicy & flavorful, even if you only marinate for a couple hours. I like to take the extra marinade and boil it then saute peppers & onions in it, to add even more flavor to the meal.

I made this for my boyfriend who is Mexican and an overall complete food snob. Honestly, I think he generally hates most things I cook(I'm still learning!) but he LOVED these fajitas. I'm leaving for a trip next week, and was so surprised and excited when he asked me to make him some again and put them in the freezer for when I'm gone.

This was fantastic...I only wish I would have had the time to marinate as the instructions state.  I was in a time crunch so I replaced the garlic cloves with garlic powder(1 teas) and browned the meat - then I added the spices, lime juice, veggies and a little water and simmerred for about 10 minutes(I did not have liquid smoke)
Without a doubt the BEST - I will definitly make these again but make sure I have the time to marinate them.

Even though our cut of meat was a little tough, the flavor was spot on!  I only got it marinaded about 3-4 hours and next time will do overnight in hoping it helps tender up the meat as well.  Great throw together marinade!!!

This tastes nothing like fajita meat.  We had to add fajita seasoning to make it taste normal.  Followed the recipe EXACTLY.

This was great!  I agreed with the other reviewers that suggested adding cilantro.  Only other tweaks I made was to add the zest of 1 lime and I used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce (becasue I was out of soy).  We marinated chicken in it  overnight, then grilled it.  The whole family loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly & it was rather bland.  The liquid smoke added a nice "right off the grill" flavor but it wasn't anything to write home about.  I'm going to move on & try another recipe next time.

Sooo good!It's AMAZING as it is but an easily adjusted recipe to perfectly suit anyone's taste. I personally like it spicier so I add more cayenne, just add more or less of what you prefer or leave it. I have never had left overs because every time I make this everyone devours it!

Use Sprite! I used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken breast, 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, and 1 sweet onion to make kabobs. I substituted Sprite for the water, omitted the salt and added 2 extra tsps of soy sauce, also didn't have cayenne pepper or liquid smoke.  I marinated overnight. My husband grilled these while I was at work and he and my daughter finished them off):  I only got one little bite that was left on her plate and it was delicious.  They loved it

This blend is spectacular!  I didn't change a thing.  I had never made fajitas before but my new daughter-in-law is Brazilian and loves them, so of course, I had to give this a try.  I used 4 pounds of skirt steaks, marinated for about 30 hours and grilled to perfection. They were so tender and delicious.  Thanks, Robbie for a great recipe.

Wonderful!  Better than any fajitas I've had at any restaurant.  Took the cheapest, though not really a bad cut of beef, and marinated it in this overnight.  Like butta!!!  And the taste was fantastic.  Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! I made this just as recipe is listed above. I marinated a flank steak overnight and seared in a cast iron skillet on each side for about 4-5 min. Sliced and served with peppers and onions also cooked in the skillet, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream. Got rave reviews from everyone. Delicious!

I have collected many recipes from this website and never felt the need to rate it but this one I have to.  This is an excellent recipe and really is addictive. My husband and son request this constantly now and we never get tired of it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fajitas.

Really good with chicken (which is all I have tried it with, want to try with shrimp and beef still.)  One of the best online recipes I have had for fajita.  My 4 stars are like a lot of peoples 5-stars, but I don't usually give 5-stars unless it is the best I have ever had with no room for improvement!  I modified by splitting the water 1/2 and 1/2 with tequila and adding about 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I like garlic!  Not sure the tequila made much difference, but sounds cool to say you used tequila in your fajitas.   I found 1/4 cup lime juice was exactly 2 normal sized limes juiced.  Definately will make again and tinker around with it (more cayenne, paprika, red wine vinegar, tequila only(no water)...lots of ideas), but even just as written it is really good, I just like to play around.

AMAZING! Made as directed for 1 1/2# steak. Marinated for 4 hours. Only thing I added was a handful of fresh cilantro (chopped up just a little) Also made another 1/2 sauce and tossed my cut up onion and peppers in this plus half packet of dry Italian seasoning mix about 20 minutes before cooking. Delish!!

This was a great marinade to start with. I did have to change the cayenne pepper to chili powder, I didn't have any on hand. It was still great, but my husband and I both agreed that there was too much lime juice to our liking. I'll use an 1/8th of a cup next time but also use the chili powder. Oh, I also didn't want chunks of garlic so I used 2 teaspoons of garlic powder. All in all though, a great marinade and I'm sure that with the lime juice change it'll be even better next time.

This marinade was GREAT! It was the first time I ever made steak fajita's and it was delicious even though I could find my cayenne pepper so I used chili powder and I didn't use the liquid smoke.

Delicious!!! I used this for chicken AND vegetables.  This was fantastic.  I did not have limes so used lemons instead, but next time...LIMES.

Great marinade! I let it sit overnight and cooked up the chicken in my cast iron grill pan. I didn't have any liquid smoke, so I left that out. I squeezed in a fresh lime and I could REALLY taste the flavor of it, even after everything was done cooking.

Delicious!  My husband and I tried this for the the first time tonight.  I cut up the chicken into strips first and then let it marinade in the fridge for 1 hour.  It was bursting with flavor.

This was surprisingly easy and very good.  I dumped all the meat right into the hot oil and cooked what little juice was there, and it was very very minimal. I used the left over meat from dinner the next night on Pita Bread and made Fajita Pita Pizza's using salsa as the sauce and they were GREAT!!!

We added about 3 TBSP of chopped cilantro to this recipe and reserved just a little of the marinade to baste on after grilling. The marinade is also great for the bell peppers and onions. Very nice flavor!

Awesome marinade!  I doubled the recipe and added a little Accent and about 1/2 tsp. Cumin.  It was enough for 2 pounds of flank steak and 4 chicken breasts.  The whole family loved it.

So yummy. I left out the water and the liquid smoke. I used 2 thin (cheaper cut) steaks, marinated for an hour or so in the fridge and threw them on the grill. I sliced the steak and served it over a sauted black bean and corn mixture (with jalapenos, onion, cumin, chili powder) topped with pico de gallo, cilantro and a fresh squeeze of lime and a side of spanish rice. Fantastic! This would be great on chicken, fish, or veggies as well. Might try it on grilled portobellos or halibut next time.

It was pretty good but tasted unethnic and North American.  I think fajita marinade should have more cilantro and Hispanic flavors, I'll probably keep looking.

Really really great, especially with the addition of a handful of chopped cilantro. I scaled back both the peppers by half cuz I'm a wimp and scaled the water down to 1/4 cup. This made for some fantastic fajitas tonight, thank you!

Used to marinate chicken for fajitas and it was delicious! Omitted the water and zested some of the lime peel. Marinated for about 3 hours. The liquid smoke really enhanced the flavor.

This is my new go-to recipe for fajitas. I let it sit overnight and even the toughest cut of skirt steak is really tender. I threw a Cinco de Mayo party and the fajitas I made with this marinade disappeared so fast!

I made this recipe exactly and really enjoyed it. I did use low sodium soy sauce, however. Note thaqt you DO need to let the mean SOAK for at least a couple hours so the 15 minute prep time is somewhat misleading. I sauted 1 red, 1 green & one jalapeno, 1 clove garlic and a pinch or so of oregano in olive oil until soft, and added the chicken. Be sure to reserve some of the marinade to add to the dish as desired. Don't use the marinade you soaked the chicken in though! Good stuff, slightly different from typical Tex Mex restaurant fajitas.

This is a great marinade. As suggested, I added some cilantro and it turned out really good. I only marinaded for about 1 1/2 hours and it had enough flavor. I woldn't marinade this overnight because I think the lime could cook cook the chicken. Served with homemade guacamole and grilled veggies. UPDATE: I made this again and let it marinate for 4 hours, it was even better.

This was a really great marinade. We used it on bison strip steak for my family, and tofu for me (the vegetarian). Both came out wonderfully. The only thing I would change is reducing the lime juice by about a tablespoon so as not to distract from the flavor of the protein. It was slightly over-powering, but still citrusy-delicious!

We really enjoyed this! I skipped the water, and doubled the olive oil - skipped the cayenne as we had none on hand, and added just a bit of chili powder.

Good marinade. I marinated for almost 24 hours, which was a bit much. Next time, hope to do 2 hours (unexpected dinner delay caused me to have to throw it in the fridge for another night).

I would have rated this 5 stars except it was a bit too spicy for us, next time I'll decrease the cayenne.  I'll for sure make it again though!

This was pretty good - although I wish there had been a bit more smokiness to it.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but next time, I will increase the liquid smoke flavoring to 1 tsp.

I liked this quite a bit. It made for a flavorful, moist chicken. I wish it had a bit mroe punch though. I plan to read through the suggestions and try a few of them to give the chicken a bit more pizazz.

Fantastic reviews from all ages. I marinated flank steak and chicken breasts for 24 hours, really easy and great flavor. I sauteed onions and peppers in olive oil with a sprinkle of chili powder. Wish I had leftovers...

It was very easy, quick and all things I have on hand. My husband really liked it and he is not a big fan of chicken. I had thought it may be a bit spicy for me but didn't seem to be, a nice balance of spices. I marianted the chicken, grilled it sliced thinly and added it to green peppers and onions that I had stir fried with some fajita mix from the store. I thought marinating the chicken gave the mix alot more flavor.

This marinade is phenomenal!  I put a flank steak in it overnight and then grilled it over direct high heat 5 1/2 minutes a side and it turned out perfect.  I also used some of the marinade when I sauted the vegatables and they turned out awesome.  My wife said these are better than the fajitas at our local mexican place.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I actually used this to supplement precooked chicken and pork that I put in a skillet with peppers and onions and it gave it a wonderful flavor like my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant. My husband was spooning it out of the pan!

This marinade is very tasty. We made the recipe as is and we also made it with lemon juice instead of lime and added some New Mexico chili powder and cumin for extra spice. Either way is good, very versatile recipe. Worked great with steak or chicken.

I used fresh lemon instead of lime and didn't have liquid smoke but it still tasted fantastic for chuck strips.  I left it marinading while I was at work.  When everything was cooked, I put it on a pre-heated (very hot)griddle and placed it in the middle of the dinner table.  It sizzled just like at a restaurant and then I squeezed half a lime over it and it really sizzled like a pro.  Served it with warm tortillas, sour cream, salsa and chopped cilantro.  Can't wait to make again!

While the chicken did come out tender, we didn't really care for this recipe.  It was kind of bland for our taste.  Usually I just use a packet of spicy taco seasoning and wanted to try something different tonight.  Will probably just stick with the packet from now on.

What a fantastic recipe!! I used this marinade for broiled salmon (to use in fish tacos) and it turned out wonderfully.  I did not use any water so that it would stay thick enough to pour over the fish, and I used garlic salt instead of the fresh garlic (too much for my taste).  Thanx for a great recipe--I'll definitely use this again!

I marinated veggies with this and it turned out great! Next time I will use less cayenne because it was a bit too spicy for the kids. Also, I'll probably use half the salt next time too, as it was a bit on the salty side but still excellent.

meat turned out tasting pretty good. not spicy at all (marinated abt 6 hr). played with the ingredients some. added small amt of tequila, cumin, cilantro, lemon juice, didn't have cayenne or liquid smoke so used some red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning. would make it a bit spicier next time. cooked in a skillet in the marinade, meat cooks quickly! very fast and easy dinner when all the prep work is done ahead of time

I love fajitas, usually a special restaurant treat.  I've made this twice with chicken, onion, and red/orange bell peppers.  I cooked it on high heat to get everything nice and brown, just a little more olive oil in the pan and everything glistens. They are amazing, better than the restaurant by far!  One batch marinated overnight and it was a deeper, hotter flavor.

Followed advice of other reviews - upped the cayenne to 1t, added 1/2t cumin and about 1/4c fresh cilantro.  Loved it!

I did without the soy sauce and liquid smoke, however I did get adventurous with the spices. Here's what I added: paprika, mexican chile powder, cumin, and ground coriander. Note: If you are using skirt steaks which are less tender than other cuts of beef, AND you have less time to marinade, I find it helpful to use a meat tenderizer in additon to the lime juice- then prick the steak all over with a fork or steak knife. Prior to seasoning and marinating my 1.8 lb. skirt steak, I trimmed off excess fat and connective tissue. I had only 4 hours to allow the steak to marinade. I pulled it out of the fridge, let it sit out to come to room temp before grilling on my gas grill. I set the flames for medium high heat and grilled both sides for 5 min. each side with the grill open. I let the steak rest for 10 min. and cut it into thin strips across the grain with at a 45 degree angle for more tender strips. the steak was medium-medium well. They were sooo mouthwatering. My neighbors were peeking through the fence to see what we had grilling! Serve with Pico De Gallo- delish.

Very good, but I took the advice of others.  I added 1/2t each of cumin and corriander plus cilantro.  I definately would lessen the lime juice if you intend to marinade overnight.  Also, it comes out quite salty, but once it's wrapped up with all the other ingredients, it's not so bad.  Next time I will omit the salt and see how it turns out.

Pretty good. I decreased the lime juice and added lime zest because I was marinating chicken for around 20 hours and I didn't want it to be "cooked" by the acid. I also threw in some cilantro and used paprika instead of cayenne pepper cause I ran out. What is this liquid smoke flavouring stuff? o.0

I used this on tri tip which I then grilled, sliced thinly and served with spanish rice, sauteed bell peppers/onions, and other assorted toppings on flour tortillas.  Very flavorful and great on steak.

My brother eats this entire recipe himself each time I make it.  I use 2 lbs. of chicken and added a 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro.  I let the chicken, 1 onion and one green bell pepper (sliced thinly) marinate in a plastic bag for 2 hours before cooking.  Then I serve it with corn tortillas, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.  For those watching their weight, it is just as good over white rice.

I doubled the recipe for 2 pounds of chicken, three peppers and one onion. I let it marinate overnight.I chose this recipe because I was going to use the indoor grill pan and wanted an outdoor grill taste. I think the liquid smoke helped with that. I think it would be better if there was no water or substitute the water for soemthing else. I like the idea of using tequila. Especially for shrimp. Maybe I will try it that way in the future.

The first time I made this it was kind of bland for me.  The second time was great by making the following changes to the marinade.  I added a 1/2 packet of McCormick Fajita Seasoning to the marinade.  I also didnt use the smoke flavoring and also used lemon juice instead of lime.  I let the top sirloin strips marinate for only 2 hours in this and it was so tasty!

Excellent flavor. It was not as tender as I  had hoped, but I think that was because I didn't get the best cut of meat (small town - not many options). Next time I will go to a meat market in a neighboring town.

I gave this 4 because I made this exact marinade for the chicken and for the steak both in different bags over night.  The chicken was great tasting but I was told the steak didn't taste as well with it.

This was an absolutely wonderful fajita marinade.  Because I found the recipe so late in the day, I was only able to marinade the chicken for two hours and the fajitas still turned out great.  I can't wait until I make this again, so I can marinade the chicken overnight.  If it tasted this good being in the frig for two hours, I'm sure it will be great after marinading overnight.

Yowza!!!  I had some sirloin that I wanted to thaw in the fridge overnight so I whipped up this marinade and put the meat in with it.  I didn't have any lime juice or liquid smoke so I used just under a 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 tsp. worecestershire instead.  It was still fabulous!

I thought this was delicious!  We had vegetarian fajitas with peppers, onions, and portabella mushrooms---and it was wonderful!  The mushrooms definitely soaked up the flavor of the marinade.  I didn't use the liquid smoke flavoring or the cayenne pepper because I didn't have any and they were still good!!!  Enjoy!

Oh my, this was wonderful.  Using other suggestions I used worstershire and we like it spicy so upped the cayenne to 1 teaspoon, added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and some jalapeno juice.  WOW, THIS IS GOOD!

Very good recipe. Made chicken fajitas. I don't care for liquid smoke flavoring so I left it out. Used fresh lime for the juice and added a bit of dried cumin to the marinade. Extremely simple to prepare with good results.

I originally rated this recipe only a 4 star, but since that have made it several times and wondered what the heck I was thinking!!!  It is really, really good and everyone always comments on how yummy my fajitas are now!  So...I have upgraded it to a 5 star.  Enjoy!

Well, here we are again with my native Texan hubby pining away for his hometown fare in San Antonio. This was a superb marinade Although we are now located at the foothills of the Smoky Mountains we closed our eyes eating this and it seemed like we were right there on the RiverWalk. We omitted the salt, made a double batch and enjoyed! God Bless Texas and allrecipes.com!

I love this recipe.  I use it all the time to cook beef fajitas.  I usually cook about 20-40 lbs of meat at a time.  I usually make about a gallon of marinade for every 10-15 pounds of meat.  I let the meat marinade overnight before I cook it.  A key item would be that I tenderize the meat before I marinade it...  That helps A BUNCH with the tenderness of the fajitas when served.

Comes out great every time...  All my frield love 'em.
  
Makes me miss San Antonio!

very tasty marinade. I added more garlic, less salt and pepper. I also added some fresh cilantro to the marinade.  After cooking the steak added some beans and rice to the fajitas which made them the best.

Wow!  This was wonderful! I made this for a group of friends.  We almost hated to make fajitas out of the meat.  Eatting it alone was good enough!!! P.S.  I did add 1t of cayenne pepper, 1/2t of cumin, and some jalapeno juice.

Too much lime juice!!!!  Flavor was good but not great.  Don't know what to substitute for the lime, maybe a little less of it?

Now this made a pretty good fajita. I used boneless/skinless chicken breast and let it marinate overnight. This makes better fajitas than you find at most restaurants. Definitely worth a try.

This is the best! It still has the zip like a fajita marinade should but not quite the bite of some of them...I really liked it. I will definantly keep this on file for future use.

I followed "igloosgirl's" suggestion and added
extra cayenne, cumin, coriander, and jalapeno juice.  Marinated both chicken and beef strips for nearly 24 hours.  I also served with salsa verde from "Lisa C."  The next day, the leftover cooked meat tasted even better in enchiladas.

This was really good. The beef was very tender and tasty, but I would recommending using about half as much lime juice than is stated in the recipe. It overpowered the flavours of garlic and spices. Other than that, it was great. I added 1 tbsp of cilantro, just to add something extra to its flavour. Thanks!

This marinade made a great base to go from. I also added more flavorings to it as did others. I added more cayenne, cumin and red pepper flakes. I will definately use this marinade again. Thanks!

This marinade was good -- it has a subtle flavor, but it was very enjoyable.  The kids even ate it.  I made mine with chicken.  I didn't want to discard the rest of the marinade, so I added it all to the pan and then thickened it up a little bit with corn starch.

Made these over Memorial Day Weekend & they were a hit! Definitely restaurant quality. We used tenderized flank steak and chicken, both were great. We also brushed a little marinade on our veggies while sautéing and they came out perfect! If you are sensitive to cayenne, you may want to tone it back-- there is definitely a little kick!

I thought this to be a very tasty marinade.  I used strips of round steak, marinaded for 48 hours and they were fairly tender.  My husband, a big mexican food fan, thought it was better tasting "carne asada" than any restaurant he'd been to.  Yippee!

EXCELLENTE!!! Oh man...I used this recipe to make steak and chicken for fajitas at my family BBQ this year and it was awesome!  It took me a little longer to make it (maybe 20-25 minutes) because I scaled it up to 50 people, but I everyone liked the marinade on the meat so much that I ended up with a ton of leftover tortillas because everyone just ate the meat as a main dish instead of making fajitas.

My wife has been bugging me ever since to make more.

Used this marinade for both chicken and steak.  Served to our small group.  Got rave reviews.  The chicken was quite spicy though I added far less black pepper than the recipe suggests.  (I did use the suggested amount of cayenne pepper.)  I suggest letting chicken marinate for only a short time as it seems to soak up the flavors pretty intensely.  Definitely a keeper.

Very easy marinade to assemble and it tastes great! I decreased the water and added cumin, along with onion powder. I also seasoned the meat with fajita seasoning from the Fiesta line of seasonings. The taste rivaled the preseasoned fajita meat from HEB in Texas!

I love this recipe, a double the lime juice, substitute beef stock for the water. I also add 1/3 orange juice and I zest the limes for more lime flavor. I make this recipe every 2 or 3 weeks at home. Also I use wood chunks on my grill for even more smoky flavor to the outside skirt steak i use. I found most importantly that it must marinate over night for that real authentic taste and tenderness of the meat. I know some may argue the liquid amount but it's marinade  for the meat. the meat takes only a few minutes to cook.

The only thing I had that was different, was smoked garlic.  Trimmed, and wet down with olive oil in the smoker. This garlic is tender, moist and smoky. The skin falls right off. This is gonna be great!

I use this recipe on a regular basis.  The only change I make is that I don't add the water.  Even if I don't have two hours to marinate the food, it still makes it taste yummy in a few minutes, but best if you can give it time.

I had avoided trying to make fajitas for years, afraid they would be to hard to make well. This marinade made great tasting fajitas easy! I work a lot so I put some pre-cut stir fry meat into the marinade on Thursday for dinner Friday evening. Leaving only veggie prep for Friday. I cooked the meat first then removed it from the cast iron skillet I was using to cook the onions. The onions deglazed the pan nicely, becoming coated in the cooled down marinade, then I added the bell peppers and extra marinade to finish cooking, adding the meat back to come up to Temp after the rest was cooked and the marinade and juices had formed a thick sauce.  Heaven!

We loved it but next time we will make some of the adjustments other reviewers suggested such as adding cumin, cilantro, and a bit more cayenne. We also used the same marinade for the peppers and onions and grilled them over the fire. Sliced them before serving and made a great home fajita meal!

This is a keeper.  Followed the recipe and marinated the flank steak for about 6 hours.  It was delicious!  Will definitely use this again.  I served with a fresh salsa and corn tortillas.  Light and tasty - perfect for summer!

I added a bit of cumin (never heard of smoke flavoring) and increased garlic - awesome and spicy!  Definitely on our favorites list!

The recipe is easy to do and the lime really tenderized the steak.  However, I thought there was Not enough flavor.

I made Fajitas with out using a frozen package for the first time.  I followed a marinade recipe for chicken and this one for beef (I had bison in the freezer so used that)  The family loved it.

This is a great Fajita marinade! definitely a keeper!
I added a few more spices, some cumin and a little coriander, extra cayenne for a little bit more heat, and instead of water, I used beer. it turned out amazing! Thanks for sharing

Followed directions to a T. Didn’t really care for the soy sauce in it. It’s not a taste for fajitas that I would recommend.

I really liked this. Cooked it as is - no substitutes. Marinaded overnight. Super yummy and easy. Not authentic fajita flavor but really good nonetheless. In the future I’ll make some modifications to more my liking but I call this one a win.  Finished dinner half an hour ago and I keep grabbing little bits out of the fridge to snack on.

Won a Fajita cookoff with this recipe!  Spicy, flavorful, clean.  The only change I made to the recipe was fresh squeezed lime as opposed to lime juice.   Also, used thin sliced chicken breasts and was sure to not overcook.

This is a great recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. I used with chicken and marinated 24 hours. 
The amount of marinade this recipe makes will work for 1 to 1.5 lbs meat.

I've made this a few times and I don't change a thing, except that I only use about half the marinade for chicken. About 15 minutes before grilling, I pour the other half on mixed veggies: 1 each of red, yellow, and orange peppers, 1 red onion, 8 oz of halved mushrooms, and 2 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2" thick pieces.  Seriously: Save some for your veggies; you won't be sorry!

instead of liquid smoke I chose to use Dale's liquid seasoning. You can also substitute for the lime juice, apple cider vinegar as an extra special flavor!

This was amazing! Only my second time cooking steak, so I was nervous, but it worked out very well. I did make a few substitutions. We generally eat paleo, so I subbed in coconut aminos for the soy sauce. Instead of plain water, I used bone broth. (We had freshly-made beef broth, but chicken would probably work just as well.) At my 7-year-old's request I used cumin instead of cayenne, since she was afraid it would be too spicy. It was delicious that way, but I might try sneaking in some cayenne next time anyway. ;-) I marinated four top sirloins for 24 hours, let them rest for an hour, then seared them on the stovetop. I cut it into chunks, then used some for that night's dinner and divvied the rest up for future fajita meals. Delicious, and so easy. Will definitely make again! Thank you!

Halved the water, used a ceramic skillet and marinated the meat for 1 1/2 hours.
Came out GREAT, huge hit.  Will try and marinate longer next time, and there will absolutely be a next time.  Served with Mexican rice (rice a roni) and refried beans, guac, chopped gr. onions and cilantro.  Cheese and sour cream and flour tortillas as well as salsa and some habanero hot sauce made this one of the best meals we've had in awhile. (also we used tri tip bottom sirloin for the meat)

I am a vegan and found this a great starter base for a fajita marinade. It works well for my veggie blend of onions, red, green,  yellow and jalapeño peppers, zucchini and/or yellow squash, and tofu (black beans work as well).  As per many review suggestions, I lessened the water by half, the cayenne by at least half, used only a few drops of liquid smoke, and upped the lime to our family's taste. I also added a generous shake of both cumin and coriander, and fresh cilantro. I felt the recipe wasn't flavorfully complete as written and needed the changes made, therefore the four star rating. That said, the recipe, with changes, turned out a restaurant quality 5 star marinade!!

Terrific marinade. I didn't change anything. I had some sirloin steak and didn't have skirt steak. I was worried it wouldn't come out tender but it did a fantastic job. Great flavor. Lime is not overpowering at all.  I will try this again on chicken.

Every time I've made this for company , they've raved. We grill our meat after marinading it and then slice it up. I once did add a quarter teaspoon of cumin to the veggies and it was delicious. I did what other reviewers said and reduced the water.

Don't be afraid of using the water,  with fresh lime juice, the flavor still comes through.  Add 1tsp of cumin.  Would make again

This is delicious.  My daughter the picky eater liked this. I did marinade it for about four hours. Might try overnight to see how that taste.  Looking forward to trying it with chicken.

Finally a good fajita recipe. We have tried hundreds from packets, pre made sauces, and just cooking chicken with salsa. We love this marinade. We grilled the chicken, Nd have eaten these fajitas every week since we found it.

I used this with flank steak to make beef fajitas.  The combination of flavors was good.  I did add some lime zest to kick up the lime flavor a bit.  Next time I would add a bit more cayenne for a little more kick and leave out the water as it did seem to mute the flavors.

As long as you reduce or eliminate the water. I wash the meat and just drop it into the marinade wet. Otherwise another good spice option is to  add a thinly sliced jalapeno

Absolutely loved this marinade!! I eliminated the liquid smoke and added a little more cayenne pepper. Grilled the steaks and sautéed some onions and peppers. What a delicious quick and easy dinner!

Used to marinate chicken thighs and skirt steak. So mich flavor, and the smell of the meat when grilled was awesome. Used some of the leftover marinade to pour over peppers & onions while grilling for fajitas. This will be an often repeated one!

This was really tasty and easy to make. I used fresh lemon juice instead of limes as that's what I had on hand and also added about 1 1/2 T brown sugar to the mix. I also only sprinkled a dash of cayenne pepper and black pepper in to make it better for the kids. Last I threw in a bunch of cilantro. Great starting point!

Excellent marinade. We soak green pepper and onions in it as well, then dump the whole bag into the pan at once. Cook on medium-high, making sure your sauce is completely absorbed by the meat and veggies. Seems to have stronger flavor that way.

This was amazing! I had 2 chicken breasts that I cut up before marinating for 2 hours. I used no water and added a fresh jalepeno to the mix. Also, I did not have any liquid smoke so instead I used 1/4 tsp of Worcestershire. Loved this!

This was remarkably good!  I had all the ingredients on hand except for the liquid smoke so I substituted smoky paprika...worked like a charm on the top loin sirloin steak.  Used the Fajita Salad recipe from this site as a base for the meat and topped the salad with thin (3/8") slices.  Would definitely make this again (but will try it with the liquid smoke which I just bought)....thanks much for sharing your recipe, Robbie:)

Delicious. I had already purchased an Old El Paso Fajita kit.  Then, I was afraid the meat would be tough, so I used this marinade for a couple hours and just added a little of the kit seasoning mix when I was cooking it.  Such a hit with my son and my "meat and potatoes" husband.  Will definitely make it again and probably omit the kit.

What an amazing marinade!  We have decided it's our number one marinade.  The steak was so flavorful with a nice amount of heat, but not overpowering.  Used the remaining marinade to saute the peppers and onions . . . delicious!  My only changes were (suggested by others on here) is that I used a little more cayenne pepper than the recipe called for and omitted the water.  You won't be disappointed!  Enjoy and thank you for this recipe!

Since finding this recipe, I no longer buy fajita marinade.  This recipe is amazing.  I usually double the recipe, since I usually make enough for my household to last for two days.  I also make the "Guacamole" from this site, and serve with some organic jasmine or brown rice ,with cilantro added for flavor, and it's truly a restaurant quality meal (of course, not to mention the sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc.).  Oops!  I almost forgot to mention:  I add my fajita veggies and chopped organic portabello mushroom from whole foods (value pack is only $5 for 3 or 4 huge mushrooms) and marinade the veggies, along with the meat for added flavor. Yum! :)

Great recipe - thanks!  I was not able to cook it after marinating overnight, so it marinated for 2 days, but I definitely don't think that hurt it - before I added the meat I sautéed some onions and peppers in oil, when they were almost done I added the meat - wonderful!

I lived in San Antonio for many years, so I have experienced many different fajita recipes.  This one is basically pretty good as it is, I would replace the water with 1/2 can of SPRITE or 7-UP, replace the soy sauce with Worcestershire Sauce and leave out the liquid smoke if your grilling on coals.  The SPRITE/7-Up will make a nice carmelization on the meat.  Don't forget to let the meat rest before you slice it and always slice skirt / flank steak across the grain.. ENJOY!

Simple and tasty. Everybody loved this marinade. I followed the recipe exactly except for these two changes: I omitted cayenne and liquid smoke because we don't like either of those. I marinated the meat for 24 hours in a zip lock bag and the taste was fantastic. I will use this over and over again and next time it I'll try it on chicken! This will definitely be our go to marinade recipe from now.

I tripled the recipe (no modifications) for 2.5 lbs skirt steak, 2 large chicken breasts, and 3 bell peppers and half an onion (had the steak, chicken, and veggies in separate bags).  We only had it marinating for about an hour (last-minute meal decision) and it was great even with the minimal time.  I imagine it would be even better with an overnight marinade.  Served with guacamole, mango and regular salsa, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  Everyone loved it.  Will use this marinade from now on.

Fast, easy and delish marinade.  I even forgot to put the liquid smoke and it still came out great.  Everybody raved about how delish the meat was.

Amazing! It does produce a lot of juice while cooking, so I just periodically drain it off to get that caramelization on the meat. So good! Now I need the perfect queso recipe to go with it.

The flavor was fantastic. I cooked the meat in small batches (single layer, uncrowded) and tried to sear it so that it had browned edges. But it was so wet that it just steamed. The only way I could brown it was to overcook it. Yes, I drained it before cooking, and I omitted the water. What should I do differently?

I was a little reluctant to try this because my husband doesn't like things with citrus, garlic or cayanne.  I used very little cayanne and omitted the water.  I only had a short time to marinate and it still turned out great.  My husband really enjoyed it and is looking forward to having it again.  That says a lot!

LOVED this marinade. Although, we made it last minute, and just poured it in pan to cook meat and veggies. In place of water, I used hard apple ginger cider. We decided it would be good with just  peppers and onions, chicken, fish, shrimp. I might lick the pan.

I adjusted based on user reviews: replaced 1/3 cup water with 1/4 cup white wine, left out liquid smoke, added 1/2 tsp of both chipotle and cumin. Marinated for about 5 hours.

But in the end this was just OK - it produced a very tender, limey chicken, but it was not quite what I would imagine "fajita" seasoning should be, and even with the modifications it was a bit bland. This may have been more appropriate for a limey chicken to top a pile of cilantro rice.

I may give it another go but add some chicken stock, paprika, and sugar to give it a bit more depth. Perhaps less lime, and beer instead of wine (definitely not water!). But it looks like now I'm actually looking for a completely different recipe, haha ;)

I marinated it for 24 hours and it gave a wonderful flavor to the flank steak.  I would decrease the liquid smoke the next time because it was a little more aggressive than I would have preferred, but that could have been because of the quality of the liquid smoke I used.

I marinated onions, bell peppers, and cilantro leaves in this, and they were DELICIOUS once skillet-roasted. I didn't use any liquid smoke (none on hand), and while my veggies might be even better with the smokey flavor, they didn't seem to need it.

Delicious. I doubled the liquid smoke, because I like a smoky flavor and was cooking indoors. Omitted the lime juice, simply because I didnt have any. Only marinated the chicken and veggies *green and red peppers and onion* a half hour. Came out full of flavor. I will definately use this again!

This is good, but it is the first one I've tried so I don't really have anything to compare it to other than the store-bought dry mix. I made it as written except omitted the salt (my boyfriend needs to watch his sodium, and it seemed a little much with the soy sauce). I used a cheap cut of beef (can't remember which) and cut it into thin strips, marinating for 24 hours then stir frying in an iron skillet with onions and red, green and yellow peppers. I agree with many that it is way too watery, I thought the smoke flavor was good but overpowering, and I would have liked more (and more complex) spiciness. I may try it again, leaving out the water, reducing the liquid smoke, and adding many of the spices that others recommended. Tasty, but needs tweaking.

I doubled the marinade and threw it in the crock pot along with some skirt steak.  I let it cook all day on low and the sauce basically evaporated but the meat was very flavorful.  I served it with sauteed peppers and onions, sour cream, cheese and cilantro.  Full of flavor.

I like the spice but I wish that I had not put the water in. I had to drain off tons of liquid. But it is good and I would definitely try and make it again.

Good recipe. I decreased the water as suggested by others to 1/4 c and did a pinch of cayenne. Served with rice, sauteed onions & peppers

I've made these twice now and the first time wasn't that impressed. The second go around I cut the water out and replaced it with beer (lager), added 1/4 tsp of cumin and chopped a small bunch of cilantro and added that. These turned out much better also traditional fajita meat is a skirt/flank steak which needs to be marinated at least 24 hours for the fibers to be broken down.

FANTASTIC!!!! One of my favorite meals by far.  I double the recipe if I use steak and chicken.  I also cook up 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper and 1 onion.  Wrap it all up in a non-hydrogenated flour tortilla and you are good to go. YUMMMMY!

Absolutely the best fajita marinade I have found.  It was resturant quality.  I marinated chicken, steak and shrimp.  I then grilled the meats using a grill and grill pan.  For the veggies, I marinated grape tomatos, red/yellow/green bell peppers sliced and sweet onion.  I grilled the veggies in a grill pan also.  Absolutely wonderful.

This is the good stuff.  I let some chuck steak cubes sit in this for an hour or so, and not only did they taste marvelous, but as all good marinades should it took the toughness right out of them!  I will be making this on a regular basis.

Wonderful marinade!! My husband and I both LOVED it! I made one slight change: I eliminated the water entirely. I marinated flank steak for four hours, threw it on the stove while I tossed the peppers and onions in the same marinade and cooked them a little later. Just the right amount of heat - not overwhelming. We will certainly make this marinade again and again. Thanks for sharing!!

I just made this 5 mins ago - didn't even marinate, just sauteed chicken and onions and then added all the ingredients to pan - didn't have liquid smoke so I used Lea&Perrings (did not add water and also added some cumin)  IT IS AMAZING!!! Soooo good I had to write a review, now I gotta go EAT!

Not spicy enough for me. I added some chili powder to try and compensate. Next time I think I need to marinate it longer. Wasn't flavorful enough after three hours.

I think this is fabulous!  I added a little ground cumin (I don't really follow measurements too closely, but about 3 shakes), but I loved how the garlic and cayenne flavor shined through!

This was a HUGE hit!! Used chicken breasts, marinated over night, cut down on the water a bit, but other than that didn't change a thing.  Slapped them on the grill and they were eaten up quick!

Also a Texan, I can say this is the best Fajita marinade I have tasted bar none. Not just from home grilled, but anywhere. Grilled over live fire (not gas) and added a dash or two of Tabasco.

My fajitas were fantastic thanks to this marinade! I used raw stew meat I got from walmart and marinated it for a day and a half, then cooked it on the stovetop for an hour in some water to make the meat tender. I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin to the marinade. FANTASTIC!!!

I had 2 large grilled (rare) sirloin tip steaks left over from a cookout and decided to turn them into fajitas the next night. I used this recipe and they turned out excellent.  I sliced the steaks very thin, marinaded them only about an hour (that's all the time I had) and used my wok to cook them.  Anxious to try this with chicken and shrimp!

I think this recipe is worth 4.5 stars but have to round up since my husband is such a huge fan. I have made this many times and the only change I've made is swapping tequila for the water. Next time I might add some cumin and coriander like many reviewers have done. This recipe also works well with shrimp. Thanks for sharing!

This is really good marinade.  I used it for steak fajitas and the only changes I made were to increase the cayenne pepper to 3/4 tsp. and I added a half tsp. of cumin.

I thought this was just a little bland.  It wasn't bad, but it also didn't add much flavor either.  Other than adding a little bit of spiciness, I didn't think it tasted like it had been marinated at all.  The water seems like a strange ingredient to me... seems a bit counterproductive.  For a much tastier recipe, look online for Paula Deen's Gold Medal Sizzling Fajitas.  Much better IMHO.

This recipe was a great start! I give it four stars only because I did have to tweak it to my preference. After reading the other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp. of cumin and cut the water to 1/4 cup. I only had time for it to marinade for 2 hours, but wow! It was wonderful! My family absolutely loved it and I will be using it again for a large group this weekend. I put it into a tortilla wrap with some cheese, shredded lettuce, salsa, black beans,and rice. YUM!

If I try this again I would maybe leave out the water as some have suggested and add some cumin and chili powder.  It wasn't very flavorful but it was easy and I had everything on hand.  I used it on chicken breast tenderloins and put them under the broiler after a few hours of marinating.  Then I cut the chicken up and sauteed it a little with onion and red and green bell pepper.

Very good marinade.  So far we've tried it with chicken only but I'm looking forward to steak and seafood as well.

We have been looking for a good fajita marinade for a long time. This one is right on! So easy too! First time we marinated chicken breasts & I saved out about 1/4 cup of the marinade for the peppers & onions. Marinated the chicken for about 6 hours then grilled them. Delicious! The second time me used the marinade on sirloin steak. Marinated for about 8 hours. Also delicious but we felt that the marinade gave the chicken a better flavor than the beef. This will be used often at our house!! Only changes, broth used instead of water & a full tsp. of cayenne.

I think this recipes would be great as is, but since halfway through I realized I put in 1/3 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup water instead of the other way around AND I didn't have soy sauce or cayenne pepper like I thought I did I can't say for sure.  What I ended up with was really good.  I omitted the salt on accident, left the soy sauce out (since I had none) and substituted crushed red pepper flakes for the cayenne.  It was such a light citrus taste.  I didn't marinate the chicken I just cooked it in the sauce with three sliced red/ yellow/ orange bell peppers and onions and served with some lettuce on whole wheat tortillas.  It was so flavorful.  My husband calls them lime-itas and he only names things when he likes them.  This recipe led to a great dinner and I recommend it as a starting point.  Maybe next time I'll actually try it as-is!!

I recently went to a "cookware" party and the hostess made fajitas using the Covered Baker that were so good! The cookware company offers a Southwestern seasoning mix that I didn't want to purchase...this recipe duplicates that seasoning pretty well. I thought that maybe it was just a tiny bit too hot, so next time I'll reduce the cayenne (I also added a little less than 1/2 tsp chili powder). I also liked that this recipe doesn't use a lot of oil. Very good!

I made this with shrimp and it is amazing. Me and my girlfriend were instantly hooked. It isn't spicy at all in my opinion so I added a couple habenero peppers to kick it up a notch since we love spice. Highly recommended.

Excellent, easy and much better and cheaper than the Allegro marinade we usually use.  We had it on chicken. I'm not sure how it would hold up on steak. Thanks!

This was great and my family loved it!  I used it to marinate both steak and chicken and then cooked some shrimp in some of the marinade.  Here's a hint-substitute mexican beer for the water.  This really added some great flavor to our meat.

I would of given it 5, if it said "READY IN 2 hours". When I read the recipe it said 15 minutes:). So I didn't bank that the marinade would take 2 hours...  I did it for 1 and quarter hours and it came out pretty good, the flavor was spot on. A little chewy, but that could of been my meat:)

Don't change a thing in this recipe -- it's delicious! Even if you can only marinate your meat and vegetables for an hour it still flavors them beautifully!

I've tried dozens of fajita marinades & this was by far the best. Marinade itself didn't smell great, but once the meat was on the grill there was no question this was a keeper. Equally delicious on steak & chicken. Thanks!

This is a great marinade for fajitas.  I made fajitas for a family get together.  There wasn't a single slice of chicken left! I did make a few modifications to the recipe.  First, I left out the liquid smoke - I didn't have it and we were putting the chicken on the grill anyway.  Second, I eliminated the salt.  I was out of soy sauce so I tried balsamic vinegar - worked great.  Finally, I used a little habenero hot sauce instead of cayenne pepper.

This was pretty good.  It was my first time at this.  I will most likely omit the salt next time.  There is enough sodium in the Soy Sauce.  Loved the liquid smoke.  Great grilled taste without grilling.

A definite keeper! Easy to prepare and adds a wonderful flavor to both beef, shrimp, and pork. It really made our fajitas wonderful. Note: I did add some cilantro, chili powder, green chiles, and mexican hot sauce to this mixture to add a bit of more zest. This was good.

I always get raves on this one.  I add extra lime juice though, and some cilantro.  Also, it needs to marinade more than 2 hours to get tender fajitas.  overnight if you have ime.  otherwise, the perfect fajita.  thanks.

So good.  I omitted the salt and it was still great.  Smoky with a bit of a cayenne kick.

I was a bit worried at first, because the chicken got a bit white after it was put in the marinate...I think the acids in the lime juice cooked the chicken a little bit. I used it anyways, and there was no need to worry. It turned out wonderfully! Better than any restaurant I've tried. My boyfriend loved them too!

I used this marinade for a Fajita Kick-off this past weekend and won 1st Place.  They were awesome.  Grilled 5lbs and made four tacos for the judges and the rest was gone in 10 mins by samplers.  It was hit.  Now my husband says he doesn't have cook fajita's anymore since I can make a kick a** marinade.  Highly Recommended.

Great!  Used this for chicken fajitas and everyone loved it.  I only had about 3 hours to marinate the chicken, so the only thing that I would change next time is to marinate it maybe 12-24 hours ahead.  Still great regardless!

Followed recipe, used 1/4 cup of water as others suggested and it was perfect. I highly recommend this recipe - we left the chicken to marinade overnight and the chicken was juicy, tender and tasted amazing.

Thought this recipe lacked something. Chicken sat in marinade for two days. Not much flavor except lime. Chicken was dry, and I did not overcook. It was too watery when added to the heat, may be better if omit water and add some more oil, because I like them a bit more oily like at my favorite Mexican joint.

this is awsome!, made this last weekend for father's day.  the only change i made was to decrease the oil to 1 tablespoon to cut down on the fat and cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon but the next time i'll probly use the whole teaspoon of the pepper as it wasn't real spicy. this had a nice lime flavor and was not overpowered by the liquid smoke, i used a flat iron steak and marinaded it over night in this. yummmmyyyyy. that's for a great marinade!

I made this for 80 portions, and used 15 pounds of chicken breats.  Divided between 3 large ziploc bags and re-froze.  Put in the cooler and took on a camping trip, they were thawed 2 1/2 days later and grilled over open flame (had to butterfly them).  They were DELICIOUS and everyone was very impressed.  Also made the Refried Beans w/o the refry and Mexican Rice III, (all prepped before hand in ziplocs), sauteed onions & peppers, chips, and condiments. Dinner for 30 was ready in under an hour.

I had tried a chicken fajita recipe from this site and found that the taste of the worcheshire sauce to be overpowering, so this was exactly what I was looking for.   This one was much more authentic.  I added cilantro, cumin, and coriander per previous reviews, and it came out perfectly!  It was also my first time grilling as my husband usually does it.  I am so pleased with the results!  Even the our picky kids loved it.  This will be in the regular rotation from now on.

This is great, however, I used it a bit differently...I wanted to make burrito meat in the slow cooker, so I used a can of beef stock instead of water, more seasoning, fresh cilantro, CUMIN-MUST HAVE-and threw in a flank steak, cooked on low 8 hours, oh my gosh-great on tortillas!

This marinade is perfect! I used roasted pepper olive oil (what I had on hand) instead of regular. I placed a red pepper, green pepper, and some sliced onion in the bag with the thinly sliced top round to marinate for a couple of hours. Perfecto!

Everyone loved it!  Husband said it was a keeper - and that was without adding the cayenne pepper and the liquid smoke.  I had used it to make beef fajitas with lots of green and red bell peppers and onions.  I did add fresh cilantro just before pulling skillet of fajitas off of the burner.

This is a great marinade base for fajitas and so easy to make! Better tasting than the store or powdered fajita marinades and you can control the amount of sodium (unlike the store stuff). I will definately use again and add a little here and a little there.
Thanks!

I used this to marinade flank steak and chicken.  My guys preferred it on chicken, eating all of the three chicken breasts.  Would probably be good in quesidillas the next day, next time I will marinate only chicken, hopefully enough to have leftovers........

Pretty good, I ended up needing more in the pan, so I added some italian dressing to the veggies.  It turned out well!

Not that spicy, kick it up with some extra cayenne or garlic.  Very good on either flank steak or chicken strips.  Overnight in a bag and then to the grill.  Winner.

only thing I added was a healthy dose of cilantro to the marinade.  Also, turning the bags every hour or so helps circulate all the flavor. We used grilled chicken and sirloin...both amazing.

This marinade made very tasty chicken fajitas!  I pretty much followed the recipe ingredients, but not necessarily the amounts - I also added some minced onions. We cooked the marinaded chicken on a stove-top grill griddle, then cooked red and green pepper slices afterwards with a little leftover marinade. Very good!

Wow!  The Marinade was great!  I allowed my chicken strips to marinate for 48 hours (I was only planning for 24 hours, but dinner got skipped!) The flavor was strong but not overpowering.  I think it would be great to marinate chicken or pork in and grill, even with out making fajitas!

The flavor was fine, but nothing special. That might have been because I used venison, which has a stronger flavor than beef or chicken. On the other hand, I marinated the meat, cut into strips, for about eight hours, and it ended up pretty tender, for venison! My family liked it.

I do this recipe a bit different but use this base recipe.  

Instead of watter I use beer, (I don't like to use water in marinades), don't use light beer I use High Life(but any full beer should work fine.)  I leave out the soy sace and don't use quite as much lime as stated.  I cut up a large sirloin or a fat trimmed rib eye cut it in strips  steak for the meat and marinade for 8-12 hrs.  I add a cut up a fresh seeded jalapeño with the marinade and some green onion with the marinade.    


Thanks for the good base recipe I just changed it for my taste :D  Serves 4.

A fantastic recipe!!  This marinade creates a wonderful taste.  My husband and I loved the end result!  I did not have any "liquid smoke flavoring," so I used worcestershire sauce (using a reviewer's suggestions).  I added slices of green peppers and green onions for extra flavor.  I broiled the meat for about 12-15 minutes.  Simply perfect! Thank you, Robbie.

This went down a treat with my Fiance. I used worchestershire sauce instead of soya as suggested by another reviewer. I also added some paprika as I wanted to darken up the colour of the meat. The flavour of the marinade was only subtle but once your fajita's are prepared with additional fillings it works really well.

This was a decent marinade, but I thought the lime flavor was a little too strong.  I followed the recipe except for doubling the amount of cayenne which I liked the result of.

I was not thrilled with this recipe.  I marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts for four hours.  The taste was okay but I didn't think it was anything special.  I guess the telling evidence was when everyone only had one fajita.

We had a Cinco de Mayo party at our house, and I used this marinade for beef fajitas.  Everyone devoured all 15 lbs. of meat I made. They asked what made this so tasy.   (I'll never tell :)) This will be one of my "secret" recipes!  Gracias Roberta!

Yum and so easy to make! Also, the flavor is better than that from those seasoning packets. I'll definitely make this again!

Fantastic!! The whole family loved it.  I used both steak and chicken. You won't have leftovers with this recipe.

Pretty good marinade, but I cut down on the garlic, (2 cloves)  and added extra cayenne.  Made great fajitas that my 2 teens and husband enjoyed.

I wasn't too crazy about this marinade, but hubby really liked it so I will probably try it again!
