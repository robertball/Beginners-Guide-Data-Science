I found the recipe spot on for the making of the risotto, mushrooms and asparagus.  However, I used less butter than the recipe called for and would recommend making it with little or no butter the next time.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This a wonderful recipe.  The two flavors work great together.  Used less butter than suggested. If you have ever made risotto before you know it will take more time to get your rice perfect.  It’s worth the extra time so don’t try and speed it up.  Add the broth slowly and continue to stir constantly.  Used a lovely balsamic reduction over the top.  Will certainly make again.

Absolutely spectacular!  I received some Morel mushrooms as a gift and pulled up this recipe by chance.  I had never made risotto before - just had the impression it wasn't worth the time - wrong!  My only complaint is that I probably won't repete the recipe often because can't afford the Morels, but I'm going to give it a try with some other varieties and see how it works.

Delicious risotto! I made two adjustments - I used baby bella mushrooms in place of the morels, and dried thyme for the fresh (fresh would have been better, but my herb garden didn't make it through the winter). Cooking time for me was closer to 35-40 minutes to get the arborio rice to our desired firmness. I find this is the standard time for me whenever I make risotto. The flavors complimented each other nicely in this, and I will be making this again, for sure.

Yummy! Didn't have Morels so just used thickly cut crimini mushrooms instead. Added black truffle oil and some red pepper flakes at the finish. Plates were licked clean!

This was  very good! Please note: I did not use Morel Mushrooms, I used Baby Bellas.  I also added a clove of garlic when I added the rice.

Wonderfully delicious! Fresh morels are harder to come by in this part of Florida so I used a mix of rehydrated morels and white mushrooms (shiitakes would have been better than white I think - next time). I agree with another viewer that the cooking time for the risotto was closer to 30-40 minutes.

My husband and I loved it! Really delicious. Unfortunately I did not have fresh Thyme or parsley so just used small amounts of dried. Added just a touch of the balsamic vinegar on my plate and loved the additional flavor...but it was delicious even without the vinegar.
