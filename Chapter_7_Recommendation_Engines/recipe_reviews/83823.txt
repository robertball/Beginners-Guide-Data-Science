With a few changes this is a 5 star recipe and one I will make many times over I’m sure. First off I must say do not wait till after adding your onions, bell pepper, corn and tomatoes to drain off excess grease. One you lose too much of your veggies flavors and natural juices in doing so, for they get drained as well as the grease. Drain your ground beef after cooking it. 

Adding garlic is a must in my house, so I did. I can see where others say using 3 boxes of cornbread is way to much too. I made a homemade corn bread spread which would have been the equivalents of about 1 ½ box of store bought and it was just right. I also took the advice of others and I increased my barbeque sauce to 1 cup. I also did not pre-drain my tomatoes so it would have more moisture. I’m glad I did not drain them either for it aided in making it moist and gave it more flavor. My husband loved it and is looking forward to leftovers tonight.

Basic recipe is good as is, except I think to much cornbread. I doubled the recipr and two boxes of cornbread mix was to much. I mixed up two boxes and used about one and a half. Made the rest into muffins. I also used several tablesppoons of Worcestershire Sauce when browining the meat. To keep from being to dry I did not drain the tomatoes. I added a can (14.5 oz) of kidney beans, drained ands rinsed, two small cans of mushrooms, and a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.I mix the cheese and the barbecue sauce into the hot mixture and it melts through out the dish.

This recipe is really good, but with some modifications. We halved it and put it in a 9x9. The smallest can of corn I could find was 8.5 oz, and I ended up using the whole thing, and used the whole can of diced tomatoes instead of half of it (and I think the results were very good). Ended up adding more bbq sauce like everyone else. Also, one box of cornbread was just enough, butI can't imagine using 3 on the full recipe; I think it would be way too much. Don't be scared of having the cornbread bake on top, only the bottom 1/4" or so will absorb any liquid, and it's a good thing! That part tastes the best! I really liked how quick and easy this recipe was, and great "bang for your buck" in terms of flavor. The bbq and cornbread go together beautifully, not weird at all. would like to try a little cheese next time.

I was looking for a bbq pork casserole recipe and came upon this on for beef.  The subsitution worked nicely!  I slow cooked some pork with a homemade bbq sauce recipe.  I had a ton of it leftover, so after a copule days, I found this recipe.  I re-heated the pork on the stovetop and added the vegetables and bbq sauce (reduced to 1/2 cup since I already cooked the meat in sauce). Then I took the advice of one reviewer and added a can of drained, rinsed pinto beans.  For the corn bread topping, I used two 16 oz. packages of Marie Callenders mix (no trans fat, just add water).  I had a lot of meat and veggies and so the topping spilled over a bit, but I really like it with a thick bread crust.  It tastes delicious!

This was so quick & easy.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used 1lb. ground beef, 1/2 chopped onion, 8oz. can of corn, 14.5oz. can of petite cut diced tomatoes and 1 pkg corn muffin mix in an 8in. square pan.  I read the previous reviews and started off with 1/2 c. bbq sauce.  I added about another 1/4 c.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Be careful.  Top looked done and even toothpick was clean but some of the cornbread underneath was a little gooey.  I would bake it another 5 minutes.

both my boyfriend and i liked this. i skipped the bell pepper (since he does not like it) and added some jalapenos and other spicy peppers instead for some more flavor. i also mixed the corn in with the cornbread instead of putting it with the meat. the recipe does call for WAY too much cornbread - i've found that half a recipe of Homesteader Cornbread (on this site) covers the entire thing in a 9x13 pan.

This recipe is delicious! My husband loves it and it's so easy to make. I did add a little Worcestershire sauce when browning the beef & onions. Also, I used 1 cup BBQ sauce. It is definitely a family favorite.

This was absolutely delicious. I made two changes: 1) I only used one package of corn bread mix. Three boxes seemed just way too much and carby. 2) I added garlic powder to the beef as it was browning. I drained the beef grease BEFORE I added the veggies.

This was excellent!  My 19 mo old loved it.  I used 1 lb hamburger, 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce, 2 boxes of corn bread and 1 whole can of undrained tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good but needed a few added things to give it 5 stars. I modified it a little with the suggestions of others: I only used 1/2 an onion (1 whole onion looked like wayyy too much!), a whole 15.25oz can of corn (because we all like corn!), just a little over 1 cup Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, diced tomatoes w/ onion, garlic NOT drained, and used one Marie Callender's (16oz) package of corn bread. I browned the ground beef first with garlic salt & fresh ground pepper and then drained excess grease. Then I tossed in the onion, bell pepper, corn & diced tomatoes. BUT...next time I think I'll just sautee the onion & bell pepper until tender and then toss in with the ground beef, corn & tomatoes because the way I did it this time, the bell peppers weren't tender enough. Then I stirred in the bbq sauce and filled a 9x13 baking dish and topped with the cornbread mix. Baked for 400degrees for 20 minutes.   Now for the critique: The only BBQ sauce I like is Sweet Baby Ray's BUT I think that for this recipe, a less sweet BBQ sauce should be used because in combination with the cornbread (which offers the sweetness to the dish), it becomes TOO sweet. So to counter it a bit, we ended up putting a little sour cream on the filling--great! Also to add a little kick, a little hot sauce (cause we like things spicy). And lastly, threw in some shredded cheddar cheese--because cheese is yummy! Oh and I wouldn't use more cornbread than 16oz because that was plenty!! Hope this helps!

It is hard to rate this recipe because after reading other reviews I made some of the suggested changes.  I added kidney beans and cheese, and I only used 2 boxes of cornbread mix.  We didn't like the bbq sauce in this recipe.  It was too sweet and odd for our liking.  I am going to try this again, but w/o bbq sauce.  I will use taco seasoning, rotel tomatoes, and jalapeno cornbread on top.

I was excited to try this recipe but not happy at all with the outcome.  I served it at a pot luck at my house and everyone (8 people) agreed tasteless and boring.

I used 1 cup of BBQ sauce, added a can of kidney beans and put a layer of sharp cheddar cheese between the meat layer and the cornbread.I also only used two boxes of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix. I think it would be good with creamed corn in the cornbread to make it a little more moist and we love corn! The only negative review was from someone that doubled the sauce and halved the meat. Go figure! This recipe is so easy and delicious! Great leftovers for lunch too.

This Was Sooooo Delish!!! Will Make again and again! My Pickiest eater even gobbled this up. Not spicy at all (we used the sweater BBQ sauces/ mixed 2 together added 1 - 1/2 cups- perfect) I also added 3 butcher block slices of bacon, cubed into the hamburger meat and cooked it together. (I feel it didnt make much difference.... Might slightly cook it before adding hamburger next time) We only used 1 box of jiffy corn bread mix... I felt it was perfect, however my husband felt there needed to be more. Next time we will make 2 batches, and use 1 -1/2 boxes on each. Surprisingly to me this comes out of the pan very easily and together. I am Itching to try this recipy with chicken, or even pork.... MMMMMmmmmmm!!!!! This family's New Fav. My Husband said he wants this for dinner every other day. Yes it is that Good! (although we will have this more regularly just not that regular.) Thanks sooooo Much to - themamalion!

I really loved this but DH just thought it was ok. I did make "Buttery Corn Bread" instead of using boxed mixes so I don't know how the quantity compares to how it would have been, but he said he'd try it again with less corn bread on top :) I did add about 1/4c more bbq sauce too - the flavor was really good, and this is very different too - yum! Oh, and I did need to bake it longer - like someone else said the cornbread looked cooked, and the toothpick came out clean but it wasn't cooked completely. I made cuts in the top of the bread to get the heat into the uncooked layer and that helped.

This was very good, I did however alter the recipe a bit to fit my needs. I left out the onion and the bell pepper. I added in a few shots of Worcestershire sauce as recommended by other reviewers. Also, I made the "stew" part of the casserole in a non stick skillet and then served it piping hot over leftover cornbread squares. Was really tasty! Hubby asked for me to make it again, which really surprised me. He had 2 bowls full for supper and then another container packed for lunch the next day. I will definitely be making this again!

Wonderful! I kind of eyeballed the amounts based on the reviews, and made a batch of cornbread off the cornmeal box. I cooked the whole thing in my deep 8-inch cast iron skillet, turned out wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe--

A different casserole than we are use to.  Hubby said to keep the recipe and try again.  We decreased the cornbread, the second time making it.  It calls for three boxes.  I mixed up the cornbread topping seperately, one box at a time.  Even at two boxes it was still alot.  I didnt put it all on top.

We enjoyed this greatly! I pared it down a bit purely due to personal taste. I left out the onion and bell pepper, but used 1 cup barbecue sauce and 2 packages of cornbread mix. I added some pepper and garlic sauce to taste. Will definitely use this again!

Very good!  I followed to the recipe w/ the exception of only using one pound of ground meat which is plenty for my family of 5.

This was good.  I made the kid friendly version by eliminating the pepper altogether and using some tomato puree instead of the chunks.  I find that kids will eat just about anything if it does  not have visible chunks.  Onions minced!  Tomato puree! Very tasty.  Might add some kidney beans next time.

Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  It is very full of flavor.  The only thing is, is that I used a full cup of barbque sauce not a half, it just did not seem enough.  I used the Jack Daniels Original barbeque sauce.  I also drained the grease after cooking the ground beef and then added everything else, it just did not seem to make sense to add everything and then drain the grease.  It took an hour to prepare before going into the oven, but I do have two very small children.  Also the cornbread took twice the time to cook all the wat through and was still a little doughy.  I took my husbands advie and turned the oven down to 350 so it would finish cooking without burning the cornbread.  Next time I will only set it to 350 and just cook it a little longer.  At 400 it cooks the top too fast but does not cook all the wat through.  We will definetly make this again.

I'd be willing to try this one again because the changes I made might have affected the end product. I used Rotel tomatoes which made it really spicy which I liked but was too hot for others. Also I didn't have enough meat so the cornbread seemed overwhelmingly thick even though I used only half a recipe of Homesteader Cornbread (from this site per another reviewer). So next time I try this I'll make sure to have the right ingredients. It was edible just not the best thing I've eaten.

This was a very delicious meal if you like anything with BBQ sauce! I did do a little tweaking though! After I got done with this dish it was like a gourmet sloppy joe with a yummy crust on it lol :) ....I only used 1 pound of ground beef... I saw that to be plenty. I did use 1 cup of BBQ sauce. I drained my meat first. Then added my veggies and let them cook for a min or two to bring out their flavor. I didnt drain the can of diced tomatoes. Also, when cooking the ground beef I added some minced garlick, salt, pepper, and some red chili flakes. I put it in a 2 Qt casserole dish... When making my cornbread I only used 1 box of Jiffy Cornbread mix. I mixed in some diced green chilis and a little bit of colby jack cheese. This was a success!! My 3 year old started singing I tried it and now i like it!! Def a keeper!!!

Good flavor, but way too much cornbread.  I'll make again with just two boxes of cornbread and perhaps add additional ingredients such as, jalapenos or black olives.  Fun and easy recipe.

I loved this recipe.  The package of meat I got was about 2 1/4# so I added an additional tomato chopped up.  Also I used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix.  Everything was perfect.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I also think that instead of using bbq sauce this recipe could also be made with chili powder to make it like a chili casserole.  There's lots you can do with this.

This is a five-star recipe with just a few changes:

2 boxes of corn bread mix instead of 2;
3 cloves of garlic added with veggies;
red bell pepper instead of green;
1 cup of barbeque sauce instead of 1/2;
a few splashes of worcestshire sauce added to sauce

I made a few changes which really made this great....  1) I browned the ground beef with the onion and a few cloves of minced garlic. 2) Used a 12 oz. steamer bag of corn 3) Used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes 4) Used over a cup of BBQ sauce 5) drained the beef/onion/garlic BEFORE adding the corn and BBQ sauce 6) To taste added onion and garlic poweder 6) Add some shredded colby jack cheese 7) The biggest change was that I made an 8x8 pan of cornbread and just served the beef mixture over cut squares of bread.  I highly recommend "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" from this site.  This alleviates the complaint that half of the cornbread was cooked and half was still gooey.

Fabulous recipe, quick and easy to make and delicious to eat! I did use more BBQ sauce and less cornbread just like most everyone else. I also added more spice to the meat & sauce. (I used garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, & black pepper.) My husband and I loved this and so did most of my kids. (The only one who didn't like it said it was too spicy.) I will definitely be making this again and often!

Great Dish. Definatly when ya add about 1/2 yellow and 1/2 red pepper and a small can of corn for more flavor and substance to it. I also used a honey BBQ sause to go with the sweet corn bread and its sooo good. Great for a Family or for a day of leftovers.

This is probably the best dish i've ever made, a huge hit with all my friends. To make a 5 star you definitely need to make a few adjustments to the recipe. I cut the recipe in half and only used 1 box of corn bread like everyone else. I did not drain the tomatoes and I used a whole can instead of half, I actually used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles which game it a little more kick.   THIS IS WHERE I THINK MADE IT A 5 STAR: I replaced the ground beef with 1 pound of BBQ pulled pork. I bought a package of Curley's Pulled Pork (which is already cooked) and cooked the veggies separately until tender and then just mixed the two in the baking pan while adding another cup or so of BBQ sauce and then cook according to the directions and enjoy!

This is a good recipe. My family and I enjoyed it. I've made it with both 1 lb of meat and 2 lbs of meat. It's fine either way. Using 1 lb makes this a very budget friendly meal. I only use 2 boxes of corn bread mix it would over flow if I used more than that. I like my cornbread moist so I always mix in at least 1/2 cup of prepared mashed potatoes into my corn bread batter. Since I used 2 boxes I mixed in a full cup of mashed potatoes. It makes a big difference.

Really would have given the meal a 4.5 or 5 but only gave it a 3 because of all of the modifications I made. I added a can of red beans, as well as celery and salt-to-taste to the ground beef. I also added about a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and 10 dashes of tabasco sauce to spice it up a little. Gave it more of a chili vibe. Also, I added shredded colby-jack cheese to the top of the corn bread. Next time I might add some cheese to the ground beef mixture right before putting it in the oven. I did use 3 boxes of corn bread mix. Although I liked the massive amount of corn bread on top...we're talking about 2 inches of corn bread on top, my husband thought it was a little too much. Next time, I think I will try 2 boxes instead. Overall, with all of the changes, it turned out great. Will definitely make again since it was a really easy and convenient recipe.

I thought this recipe was really good! My husband liked it also. I took others advice and added some worst. sauce and garlic powder to the beef, and drained the beef before adding the vegetables. I didn't drain the tomatoes.. kept liquid. I also used 1 whole cup of BBQ sauce, and used 2 boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix. 2 boxes was perfect. This recipe made a lot, will have leftovers:) Turned out great, definitely will keep this recipe.

This is a great family pleaser, even my kids loved it! I did cut the recipe in half (except bbq sauce) and added a layer of shredded cheese between the meat and cornbread. This recipe can easily adjust to ingredients you have on hand.

I split this recipe in half as it is just me & my husband.   I cooked in an 8 X 8 casserole dish .   I drained the grease prior to adding the veggies & used a a little bit extra BBQ sauce & only 1 pack of cornbread.   I also added one clove of garlic for flavor.   My husband & I both enjoyed it & will definitely make this dish again.

I thought it was pretty good  I would have just used 2 packages of corn bread and added a bit of liquid like v8 .. and honey on top of the cornbread , my husband said when he added the honey it made it a lot better .

Good, but 3 boxes of cornbread is definitely over kill.  2 would have been fine.  Added just a little more BBQ sauce.  GF really liked it.

This recipe turned out great! I added TWO extra ingredients: bacon and hamburger pickles.  I think adding bacon and the pickles really boosted the taste overall.

As is, this recipe is just so-so, but after adding more ingredients, this is definitely a five star recipe. To the meat mixture I added kidney beans and black beans (both rinsed and drained), a cup more bbq sauce (a spicy and a Maui onion variety mixed), garlic and some Worcestershire sauce. To the cornbread (I used one 15 ounce box) I added more corn and sharp cheddar cheese (a cup of each). When layering, I put the meat mixture down then cheddar cheese and then the cornbread mixture. Baked as directed. It came out golden brown with a sweet and spicy fragrance. Plenty of flavor. A keeper for sure!

This was  pretty good, perfect for that crazy Monday night family meal. I (kind of) did a half recipe. Here is what I did: browned 1 lb ground meat (elk, actually) in a 10 inch oven-safe skillet, added 1 diced onion, 1 diced bell pepper (cuz I can't stand half a leftover onion or bell pepper hanging around), probably little more than a cup worth of frozen corn, the whole can of diced tomatoes and little more than half a cup or so of bbq sauce, and let that simmer until it started to thicken. I only had one box of corn bread mix on hand so I mixed that up, spread it on top of the mixture in the skillet (skipping the transfer to a 9x9 and another dish to wash) and put it in the oven for 20 minutes. Had I bothered to spread the cornbread batter out more evenly it would have covered the whole casserole just fine. As it was, it was plenty enough. My two-year-old and 9-year old both asked for seconds and my picky four year old ate every bite without too much protest (onions aren't her favorite). I had to put the leftovers away in a hurry to keep from eating too much! Overall, this was simple, fast and delicious. I think I'll make this again, though I might take more liberties with it in the future. Stirring shreds of cheddar into the cornbread batter before baking sounds fun. How about crumbled bacon? Frozen peas? Mmmmm, the possibilities! Well done, themamalion! Thank you!

I used the full amount of cornbread mix and even after 45min, it wasn't completely cooked in the middle. Next time I will cut the cornbread mixture in half. Otherwise, it tasted amazing.

I really enjoyed this recipe, granted I did change some aspects based on ingredients I already purchased and owning smaller pans.  I spiced and cooked the meat, drained off the grease and added BBQ sauce (1 cup) and tomatoes.  In a separate pan, I cooked my bags of frozen corn and frozen onion/peppers.  I put the meat in my pan first, threw in some cheese, then the veggies, mixed it all up, and threw in a little more BBQ sauce (because I love the stuff).  Then I tried all 3 boxes of cornbread because I'm a big fan of my carbs, but I can definitely see why people thought that was a lot.  However, it may have been more difficult to fully cover the casserole without 3 boxes.  I'm looking forward to leftovers!

Terrific recipe for folks look for a quick weeknight meal.  I only used two boxes of corn bread mix.  I think three would have been too bready.  I also made with 85% ground beef to cut the fat.  Simple and tasty.  My family enjoyed it.

I think we'll try 2 boxes of corn bread mix next time, there was a bit much of it on top. Other than that, It was a VERY good dish. Very filling! I also added 2 stalks of celery and it was very good in it.

It looked wonderful, just like the picture.  There was a little taste missing, maybe more spices and more Barbecue sauce would have made it a little tastier.  Was overall good.

Loved the flavor.  Only used 1 lb. ground beef. Upped the bbq sauce to 2/3 c.  Kids didn't like the onions so might leave out next time or cut back.  Only used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix.  Easy to make so we will add it to our list.

The family did NOT like this. Mostly is was the BBQ sauce. I felt it was ok. I've done a similar recipe in the past without BBQ sauce and it was better. A different sauce would likely make a difference, but I'll likely stick with my old method/version instead. 2.5 stars.

Recipe is a great idea, but would make a few changes, I agree that there should be more sauce, but I just added a little bit of chili to the mixture instead of more BBQ. Also this recipe would be GREAT if you used shredded beef instead of ground beef! But over all a WONDERFUL recipe.

Next time I'll make it in a deeper dish and use only two boxes of cornbread, as I thought it was just too much bread.  But, will try again this way.

This was really good, and quite easy.  I added peas, in addition to the corn, and I also jazzed up the cornbread topping with green chiles, 1/4 tsp. ground oregano, 1/4 tsp. cumin, and a pinch of sage.

i'm not a beef eater so i'm not rating this based on my taste because i didn't eat it.  but dh and dd gave this a quadruple thumbs down.  hubby says odd flavor, too much cornbread, dry, and just a weird combination.  seems like it would be something he would really like so i'm surprised, but it did not go over well at all:(

My family watched in horror as my elderly grandfather licked his plate clean - he loved it that much. I made it for Christmas and everyone quickly ate it all. When my mother was cleaning out the dish she told me I had to make it again next week for New Year's - ugh!   I listened to other reviewers who said three boxes of cornbread was too much, but I disagree. Everyone's plate had more meat than bread, so next time I'm using all three boxes. The one reviewer who suggested adding black-eyed peas had the best idea. The black-eyed peas were an excellent addition and made the dish pop. This was overall a very tasty casserole, however, we felt it needed some heat. I don't like spicy dishes but this casserole was very sweet to us so next time I'll be adding a dash of cayenne pepper to balance it all out. Excellent, easy meal for the whole family.

I should have read other reviews before I make this. It was a great idea, but need to modify few things to my taste. 1. way way too much corn bread. I would only used one box next time. 2. need some spices. black peper and jalapeno pepper would probably help. 3. more BBQ sauce. increase to about 1 cup. I am even thinking making mashd potato to lay at the bottom of the pan. I will have to update the outcome after I do this.-Update: I've just made some cheesy mashed potato on the side and eat it with. It provide some saltiness and moisture. To me it worked much better. I will do the mashed potato layer next time I will make for sure:-)

I followed the suggestions of others and added some garlic and kept the tomato juices in.  I upped the bbq sauce a little bit and cut back on the corn bread mix.  But I still felt this was missing something.  I think it needed some sort of a bite to it.  If I ever make it again I'd probably add some jalapeno peppers to it.

I'm not sure why this recipe only rates a 4.  It's a casserole, and for a casserole it's very good.  My whole family ate it and wanted seconds.  I did follow others and added garlic and cut the cornbread to one package.  I also added creamed corn to the cornbread mix and made this with Boca crumbles instead of meat.  It was really good.  At the end of dinner I always ask if the dish is a "make again" and this one got a unanimous "yes"!  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this recipe exactly according to the directions and it turned out great.  My whole family loved it.  The only thing I would change is to maybe add just a little more BBQ sauce to give it more flavor.

Yummy!  I doubled this recipe, kept one for my family and took one over to a friend who was recovering from surgery.  My family gave it 10 stars, and my friends said her family loved it as well!  This will definitely go in my recipe box, as well as be added to my list of dinners that I can make for family and friends in need.

I thought this was awesome. I invited over a few friends and they enjoyed it as well I did cut it down by a box of cornbread simply because I didn't think it would fit in the pan but it was awesome. Took a little longer for the center to cook but thats understandable as stoves vary. I am going to try adding a can of kidney beans to it next time just for kicks! Must try.

Excellent recipe, especially when using the changes suggested by other viewers.  My husband and I are trying to stay healthy, so we wanted to make this meal good for us as well as tasty.  Changes we made:  1) Used 96% fat free beef--if it's available at your grocery store, get it!  You don't have to worry about draining the grease off after cooking, and it tastes delicious. 2) Added Worcester sauce and two cloves on minced garlic when browning the meat 3) Used canned tomatoes diced with roasted garlic instead of plain tomatoes. 4) Did not drain the can of tomatoes before adding to the mixture. 5) Used 1 full cup of barbecue sauce (use your favorite sauce here, probably the runny-type sauces won't work as well) 6) Used only 1 bag of cornbread-perfect! 7) Added shredded fat free cheddar cheese to the top after spreading the cornbread mixture.  When making this, it took a long time for the vegetables to soften once I added them.  Next time I will add them before the beef is completely done.  Also, I was worried that the mixture was too liquidy before I put it in the oven.  I took out a couple spoonfuls of the liquid, then decided it was too much work.  It turned out perfectly.  My husband absolutely LOVED this recipe, and said it was his favorite new dish.  We will be making this frequently!

I thought this would be deilcous, but no one in my family liked it. I gave it to my cusion who basically eats anything and everything, I will actually be surprised if he even eats it. I followed everyones suggestions, but I guess it is a very taste specific recipe.

This was very good, I only gave it 4 stars because I changed some things.  I added pinto beans and put a layer of cheese between the filling and cornbread.  I only needed one box of cornbread and I still had a HUGE layer of cornbread over the filling.

I probably won't make this again.  Doesn't specify what kind of BBQ Sauce to use.  I used Kraft Original but it turned out waaaay too sweet.  My husband and kids would not eat it either.

I gave this one 4 stars becuase it needed some tweeking.  I don't use beef in my house, only elk (since my husband likes to hunt).  It didn't come out gamey at all.  I also used only one box of corn bread mix and that was more than enough.  It also says that it will serve 12, not in my house.  The whole 9x11 pan was gone with only 5 adults and 2 kids.  It was a winner in my house.  Everyone asked me to make it again sometime soon.

I used 2 packages of cornbread and it was still WAY too much.  The amount of meat mixture should be double the recipe, while the cornbread should be about 1/3 the recipe.

This is very yummy! I did halve it and put it in an 8x8 dish. I did use the whole can of tomatoes, undrained as several reviews suggested, but it was a little too soupy.  Next time I would maybe drain off 1/2 of the liquid. I used about 1/2 cup of frozen corn and 1/2 cup BBQ sauce. I sprinkled "Fiesta Blend" shredded cheese on top of the meat mixture and used 1 box of Jiffy corn muffin mix.  Turned out great!

This recipe was very attractive to me because of the ease of making it plus already having the ingredients in the house. I used 1 lb. ground turkey and a whole can of diced tomatoes with chilis, undrained. I added a dash of garlic powder, about 3/4 C. frozen whole kernel corn, and over half of an 18 oz. bottle of "original" flavor bbq sauce. My mixture was about the thickness of chili. I only used one box of cornbread mix, which was what I had on hand, and it was Jiffy brand (sweet). This created a crust about 1" thick, which was plenty for us. One reviewer cautioned against using sweet cornbread mixes, but I liked the way it tasted versus the zesty meat mixture. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by how easy and tasty this was, and I'll definitely make this again.

My husband didn't read the note about cutting back on the cornbread- the night he made it, there was way too much cornbread but the next day all the juices soaked in and it was absolutely delicious! Definitely a recipe that gets better every day it's in the fridge! He added some BBQ sauce but it was really better to add the sauce yourself because we like different amounts, like you would with salad dressing or spaghetti sauce (if you're like me).

Very good!  Halved the recipe, added garlic to the meat/veggies mix, added some Texas Pete sauce, and substituted a can of tomatoes with jalepeno chilies for the plain tomatoes (used a full can).  Used only 1 box of cornbread mix (Jiffy is the best!).  Hubby liked it, said he wouldn't change a thing!

I just don't think the flavors melded well together.  I DID follow the original recipe, and I do believe the recipe would be better following the advice from these ratings. (1.Drain right after browning meat, 2. Extra barbeque sauce, 3. Less than 3 boxes of CB mix) I do believe it may have been a little better than, but not something I'd make more than once.  No one liked it.

This is a keeper for my family. I also used two boxes of mix and tomatoes with green chiles. I used a huge onion and green pepper, and added garlic. The cornbread was a little sweet, so I'll look for a mix that is not so sweet. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

I made this tonight and it was good and simple-perfect for me.  I used 3 boxes of cornbread mix because when I put 2 on per the other reviewers suggestions, it seemed very thin.  Being a bread fan, I added the other box.  BIG MISTAKE.  Trust me, don't do this, the ratio is now like 3/4 bread, 1/4 mixture....

I will make it with only 2 next time, lesson learned, otherwise, yummy!

This is was fantastic! I subsituted with ground turkey instead and drained the grease before adding the veggies. I also did not drain the canned tomatoes and went to a 1 cup of BBQ sauce. I used about 1 1/2 box of cornbread mix and even that was a little thick. Defintely a keeper!

I followed the recipe except added a cup of BBQ sauce instead of a half cup as per most suggestions. None of our family particularly liked this.  It was just too weird with BBQ sauce.  I'm wondering if Taco sauce might do better because of the cornbread, more of a Mexican type dish.

This was really easy and tasty.  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce, the best BBQ sauce ever!  I left out the corn on accident.  I turned around after it was done cooking and saw the can of corn still on the counter.  I also added a cup of BBQ sauce to increase the flavor.  The blend of corn bread and BBQ sauce will make your family gobble this up.

I made this recipe looking for something to give me a base that I could manipulate a bit.  I used 1 lb ground pork and 3/4 c bbq sauce and I did not drain the tomatoes, as it seemed that dryness was an issue with other reviewers.  I also topped it with some cheddar during the last 5 minutes of baking.  Finally, I made corn bread, but did not make it on top of the dish, as I was afraid of it becoming soggy. 
Given all that, my kids and I thought it had good flavor and I thought it was easy to make.  I would recommend trying it.

Good recipe but took the advice of the others and used just over a cup of BBQ sauce.  Used the 3 boxes of cornbread but I do think two would have been more than enough.  It was very tasty and we enjoyed it -- I ate leftovers for a couple days :)

Surprisingly good!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added Worcestershire sauce to the beef and onions.  I also doubled the amount of barbecue sauce.  It made great leftovers for lunch the next day.

My husband liked this recipe, and I wasn't crazy about it.  So I changed some of the ingredients to make it a Mexican Casserole.  And we LOVE it!!!  Thanks for the idea...

I took this casserole to a church fellowship and it was a huge hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It is very easy to make and good on those days when I don't really want to cook.

I made this recipe with a few adjustments after reading the other reviews. I used 1 1/2 c. bbq sauce (so it wouldn't be dry) and used only 2 boxes of the corn bread (more than enough). 
I thought the recipe was just ok...tasted like something from a fast food restaurant. My mother liked it a lot, I on the other hand will not make it again, it was so so, sorry!

Can't say I like this one.  I thought it was too dry.  I won't make it again unless I use a bisquit-type topping instead of corn bread.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe almost exact but I just used one box of Zatarans Cheddar Jalapeño Corn Bread Mix and 1 cup of bbq sauce-Heinz Sweet and Smokey. I served along side Mac n cheese and my bf said it’s the best thing I’ve ever made, thank you!

i really liked this.. I didn't have a bell pepper so, i used a can of chili ready diced tomatoes which has peppers in it. I chose the wrong corn bread mix and it was too sweet. Do not use Sylvia's southern corn bread mix. i should've made my own.  i usually use jiffy cornbread mix when i made a tamale pie/bake, because u want it sweet. This recipe you don't want it sweet because the BBQ sauce.

Quick and easy especially for a week night.  Followed the directions except I added seasoning to my ground meat.  I used a honey cornbread because that’s all I had on hand. Turned out great. Will definitely make this again.

I would make this again. I added a little more beef and bar-b-q sauce. Also I used the Hunts Diced tomatoes with red pepper. Much tastier for those who like a little more heat! I used one cup of Jack Daniels bar-b-q sauce. Made it more interesting. i'll also try using a little less cornbread next time.

We enjoyed it. I probably had my proportions off because I made a large one- 9x13, for a friend and a small one for home. So I did use extra ingredients but I would have liked better with a little less cornbread and a little more filling. To be fair though I made my cornbread from scratch so I may have had more than the 2 boxes that everyone has recommended. I also used ground cumin and ground garlic, and extra BBQ sauce. I will make again, and probably make extra meat and veggie filling. Flavor was good, and I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

i also cut the recipe in half, and used only one box of corn muffin mix, and used red peppers instead of green peppers.  and i used a whole can of tomatoes, undrained, 1 whole can of corn, drained, and added more barbeque sauce. it was great!

Good "starter" recipe. I cooked the burger with Adobo.  I used southwest rice blend on bottom of a 9x13. A can of corn well rinsed, Rotel tomatoes w/ chilies, I cooked the peppers & onions before putting in dish. topped with ground beef. shredded cheese than I made my own flint cornmeal bread and covered the top of the casserole. This would be great w/ a few chipotles in adobo sauce. Also, I do not buy just the average bbq sauce. I used Outta The Park hot & spicy, makes a huge difference.

I made a few changes and it turned out wonderful. I added some red bell pepper, chili style diced tomatoes and a layer of cheese under the corn bread. This was probably my husband's favorite dish that I have made recently. Great recipe!

My fiance really liked this & took leftovers for lunch today, my toddler wouldn't touch it, & I thought it was just ok.  I'll probably make this again, with my own finishing touches.  I was happy to use up a lot of stuff I had in my cupboards & a fresh yellow pepper from my garden that I fried up with an onion.  I did add 4 slices of swiss cheese which added a little dimension to this.   Next time I will add garlic, more BBQ sauce ( I went easy on it due to it making me nervous - 1/2 c is a lot), paprika, mustard powder   & possibly homemade cornbread.

My husband and I liked this dish.  I cut the recipe in half and used only 1 box of cornbread mix and it still made a lot.  4-5 large servings.  This recipe is also very good with Manwich sloppy joe sauce nstead of barbecue sauce, and the Manwich sauce makes the recipe less dry.  I used about 2/3 can of Manwich for half of the listed recipe.  I will continue to make this dish, it's pretty easy and doesn't take long to bake either.  It's also cheap.

Easy, quick and yummy.  Like other reviewers, I only used about 1.5 boxes of corn bread mix.  Added chipotle seasoning for a little kick.  Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe.  Will be making this one again.

I read most of the reviews, so I increased the BBQ sauce and I'm glad I did.  I also used less cornbread, but it was still too thick.  I used a 13x9 pan as suggested and it boiled over in the oven.  Luckily I caught it right away and put foil under it.  This was a good casserole for my family who doesn't usually like casseroles.

Making this again tonight! First time around, I followed some others' ideas, with the 1 cup of BBQ sauce and not draining the tomatoes. I did add onion and celery (ran out of green pepper), and garlic. Tonight I am also adding some shredded carrots chopped fine just for extra nutrition and color along with the corn. Used one box of the Krusteze cornbread mix. Last time, I added chopped green chilies and cheese to the cornbread mix, and also creamed corn to replace the oil and milk. That was just to see if it would work and this was EXCELLENT. This is really a great recipe to experiment with, and with simple ingredients. Gave this 4 stars due to my changes, but why not be creative while cooking?

Tasty recipe.  I did make a few changes - 1.5 pounds of beef, 2 boxes of cornbread mix, 1 cup of BBQ sauce, and 1 can whole tomatoes for the diced tomatoes since that is what I had on had.  Overall a keeper of a recipe.

the beef portion was very good. The cornbread seemed to over power everything though. I would definitely just use two boxes next time.

This was delicious! I added a little more bbq sauce. And used jiffy corn muffin mix so it was sweet instead of cornbread.

I thought the recipe a was great building point. I did season the ground beef as desired (garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, seasoning salt) and I also added black beans. Another thing I did was layer 6 slices of Havarti cheese between the meat and the cornbread layers. Served with sour cream, chives, and shredded cheese. I will definitely use this recipe again.

My family and I loved the cornbread topping. Added a couple of cloves of garlic and used a full cup of bbq sauce. Yet it still didn't taste flavorful.

It was tasteless.  It had way too much cornbread on top and not enough barbecue.  Seemed like corn bread on top and dull meat mixture on the bottom.  True waste of time and money.

I thought that this was very good.  I made it as written with the exception of using closer to 1 cup of barbeque sauce based on previous comments.  I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and Jiffy corn muffin mix.  I used all 3 boxes of corn muffin mix, but I did use a slightly larger dish than 9x13, which allowed the corn muffin mix to cook through in 25 min.  I didn't feel that it was too much cornbread on top, although I may be biased because I love cornbread!

I gave 4 stars because I adjusted it to my liking and didn't want to mislead. I love it! It was so easy. I really wanted to make this but didn't have some of the ingredients so I improvised. I read some of the other reviews and got ideas. I seasoned the ground beef with taco seasoning. I added some frozen bell pepper mix and used salsa instead of the tomatoes since I didn't have any. I added some pinto beans as suggested by another reviewer and I only used half the bbq sauce because I'm not a big bbq sauce fan but was curious. I only had 1 box of cornbread mix so I just used the one and made this in an 8x11 pan. It really needed just a bit more so the topping was only about a half inch thick. I could see using the 9x13 pan and using 2 boxes, I agree with other reviewers that 3 would be a bit much. I also sprinkled some cheese on top before adding the cornbread mixture. Next time I might try some rotel. Definitely making again. My 10 year old daughter is so picky and she had seconds. My husband finished it off he liked it so much.

We really liked this one. The first time I made it I used sweet BBQ sauce. Dont! It was way too sweet. Next time I made it with a regular BBQ sauce and added kidney beans. Wonderful.

I loved this recipe! I used a 15 oz package of cornbread and it came out perfect. Leftovers were just as good as the first night. It set like a meatloaf and still had a wonderful flavor. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but it was one of those foolproof recipes - hard to mess it up.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I expected to like it more than I did, but the barbecue taste was just a little off-putting to my family. We did like the cornbread topping, so it has potential.  I might try to make again, maybe using a chili or taco sauce in place of the barbecue sauce.

Winner, winner, casserole dinner! This was so yummy and filling.  I also used two boxes of cornbread instead of three and it was perfect. Also added a little cayenne pepper to give a little kick. Amazing. The husband went back for thirds. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made it exactly as stated, but it was on the dry side.  It had a goof flavor and easy to make, but way to dry.  I have left overs, so I will need to figure out how to warm it up and adding a bit more moisture to the mix.

Very good! Would have rated it a five because my husband LOVED this recipe, except I had to tweak the recipe a little bit...   I used only half the amount of corn bread (and still found it a bit too much). I used this Allrecipes recipe -- Buttery Corn Bread -- instead of using the boxed cornbread (amazing cornbread!) I also used less onion. Didn't use green pepper (only because I forgot...).   I didn't want it to taste overwhelmingly of BBQ sauce, so I used the same amount (from this AR recipe -- Applesauce Barbeque Sauce.  This BBQ sauce is sweet, so it tasted good with the sweet corn bread.   I cooked the beef first, drained the fat, then added the veggies (I also didn't completely drain the canned tomatoes) and also added garlic while it was cooking. The extra liquid from the tomatoes made the corn bread extra moist.

Love this dish - hearty and filling and not soupy or runny.  Changes that helped: used only 2 7oz. packages of cornbread mix, 1 lb. of ground chuck, added can of kidney beans and a small can of mushrooms.   Needed more time in the oven than 25 mins. Yum!

This tasted good but the bottom of the corn bread wasn't totally cooked while the top was beginning to brown too much.

I've made this twice. Once as written except halved the recipe on both occasions (there are only 3 of us), once with modifications. The first time we enjoyed it, but felt a flavor conflict between the barbque sauce and the tomatoes and bell pepper. Second time, I left out the tomatoes, green pepper, added 1Tbsp of minced garlic, 1Tbsp of Worchestershire sauce, black and white pepper, & a couple dashes of crushed red pepper, while browning the beef,  added more barbque sauce, and 1 can of Ranch Style Beans, and 1.5cups of frozen corn instead of canned. I use a Thick and Spicy Kraft barbque  or Stubb's mesquite barbque sauce. I only use 1 box of Jiffy yellow cornbread with about 1/2 cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese added before layering it over the beef mixture. Thanks for posting, it's a great base recipe that can be altered for personal tastes.

Great recipe and loved by all.  I omitted the bell pepper and added diced jalapeno, black beans, and cheddar cheese. It had excellent favor and has been requested as a regular by my family now.

This was sooooo good. I took the advice of others and made some modifications. I drained the beef before adding the vegetables and I did not drain the tomatoes. I also added a can of black beans, about 6 dashes of worcestershire sauce, and about 6 dashes of cayenne pepper. I added 1 cup of Bullseye original BBQ sauce. Another thing I did was layer the bottom of the dish with Idahoan Four Cheese Mashed Potatoes before adding the beef and cornbread mixture. I only used two packets of cornbread instead of 3 and it was enough but I think 3 would have been fine too. Next time I think I'll make it without the mashed potatoes. It worked fine but it was just too carby. My boyfriend loved it with the mashed potatoes though so it really is a matter of preference. I definately be making this again.

Delish and super easy. I quadrupled the recipe for a freezer swap and it was still super easy and got RAVE reviews. I did sub pulled slow-cooked pork for the ground beef, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.

What a nice change for dinner!  It was easy and quite tasty.  Best of all, my teenagers loved it.  I did end up using 2 boxes of Jiffy Cornbread mix and that was just right.

My family really liked it. It was easy to make. I also added garlic and cut cornbread mix to two. Intead of green pepper I added red. For color I also added chives. Great dish. I will be teaching this one to my single brother

This was quick, easy and very tasty.  I was able to zap the leftover shredded BBQ from our dinner the night before so it made it that much quicker.  Only changes I made was to add a can of rinsed black beans.  Very hearty, the whole family loved it.  Will add to our dinner rotation. Thanks.

Everyone loves this but  I made some changes. I used 2 boxes of cornbread mix, 1 pound of hamburg, an onion, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of frozen corn, 1 tbl of worcestershire sauce, and only 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce.  I added tomato sauce to get the consistancy I wanted- about 1/3 of a cup.  The kids didn't like the strong babecue flavor when I amde it the first time. I sauteed a diced zuchinni along with the onion.  I wanted more vegiges than meat.  My daughter and her hubby ask me to make it every week.

Really tasty. Cut it down to one box of cornbread and add more bbq sauce. My boyfriend loved it, so it gets 4 stars--but maybe will use ground chicken or turkey next time for a healthier option.

I liked this. I added twice the BBQ sauce. I think next time I wont use as much corn bread mix... I think it would have tasted better without it.

I made this last night and I thought it was pretty good...but my boyfriend LOVED it.  I did, however, cut the recipe in half.  1 box of cornbread mix (jiffy brand) was more than enough.  And bbq wasn't enough...so I doubled (maybe even tripled it).  But it did turn out good.  I'll be making this again.

It was okay.  I took the suggestions of doubling the BBQ sauce, which I definitely recommend, and I used only two boxes of cornbread which still seem a tad too much.  My boyfriend and I both thought it was just alright.  Maybe not our taste... but just wasn't "out of this world" good.

I've never enjoyed BBQ sauce so much!  Fantastic recipe!  Of course I used garlic in the meat, beans, juice from the tomatoes, one box of cornbread, doubled the BBQ sauce, basically all the suggestions everyone else wrote.  But I thickened it all up with a flour and water mixture before I layered it in my baking dish.  I put cheese on top of that, but wish I had used more.  I used half a can of corn with the meat and veggies, and used the other half in the cornbread.  The one box was just enough to bake up to about a half inch on top.  If I had another box of cornbread mix I would have liked to use it.  In the end I served it with a nice salad and it was an incredible meal!

I love casseroles of all shapes and sizes! My boyfriend gets tired of them though he eats them but last night he looked at me and said "I really liked this though less BBQ sauce next time" I put more than it said because it looked so dry.

Found this recipe when my fiancee said that he was bored with food. He said he hadn't been that hungry anymore since he always ate the same things just in a different "way" and nothing was favorful or "exotic" enough for him. (I don't cook that much) Made some changes to this recipes as suggested. 3 boxes of corn bread seemed too much, but one box proved too little. Next time I will use 2 and see how that turns out. Long story short on the fiancee -he gobbled it up and bragged about it for two weeks!

This was really good with a few modifications. I cut the beef in half, to one pound, and added a can of black beans to stretch it. I used dried onions to saute with the beef. I also added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes to the browned beef, beans and corn, and omitted the green peppers since my family won't eat them. Used closer to a full cup of sweet bbq sauce. For the topping, I used two 8.5 ounce boxes of cornbread mix, with 2 eggs and 2/3 C milk. It baked beautifully in half an hour, and the leftovers were even better the next day.

My fiance loved this. Barbeque sauce,cornbread and beef are 3 of his favorite foods, so I knew he would. I used 2 boxes cornbread and cheddar cheese over the top. Will this with more spice next time. Maybe hot sauce in the ground beef.

This is an awsome meal.  My family loves it and as things are today, it is a GREAT BUDGET STRECHER!!!  I did add a little more sauce and only 2 boxes of cornbread. 3 boxes is a little much. I used the rest for muffins on the side. It is a must try!

I thought this was rather bland tasting but my daughter loved it.  I put pepper jack cheese on the top of the cornbread when I warmed up the leftovers and it really gave it some zip!

This recipe was very good. I see most people think there is too much cornbread, well I thought there was too much meat mixture, so I divided that in half and left the cornbread in half.  My kids even liked it. This one is a keeper.

I wish there was a 4 1/2 stars. My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I was pleasantly surprised. And it's so easy, that I have it memorized, which is a huge bonus. The only thing I would change is the cornbread, I think one package will be plenty. I love lots of corn bread, but I had a really hard time cooking it all the way through. So the next time I make this budget friendly meal, I will be using just one package of cornbread mix. Thank you so much for an easy, delicious recipe.

I liked the flavors of this recipe, but it came out a little dry.  A little more BBQ sauce might have made a difference, but overall I would probably do this again -- with some changes.

Very tasty, simple, and inexpensive!  I halved this recipe (only had one lb of gr. beef to use) but I still used the whole green pepper because it needed to be used up, and I also used the full cans of corn and tomatoes because I didn't want to have 1/2 cans sitting in my fridge.  Also I used the full 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce even in the half recipe since so many reviews said to double it, plus I didn't drain the tomatoes.  Many people said there was too much cornbread, so in my half recipe I used only one package, but I think it could have used more so next time I'll likely use 2 packages.  My picky husband liked it, and so did I. :)

I know we're in the minority, but my husband and I did not care for this at all. I made it with one pound of hamburger (all I had) and two boxes of corn bread mix (yes, I made too much) and added the one cup of BBQ sauce.  Not for us, but you can't please everyone!

This was really yummy and inexpensive! I cut the recipe in half, left out the bell pepper (personal preference), definitely drained the grease before adding the veggies and ended up only using 1/2 a package of cornbread mix since i didn't want a very thick breading on top. Not sure exactly how much bbq sauce i used, i just kept adding more until i liked it. Very good, will make this again, thank you!

This is a delicious and easy dish! I added 1 cup of BBQ sauce following the advice of other reviews. I also addes 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies along with the other can of tomatoes.  It addes a little spice.  I did not drain either can.  The juices soak up into the cornbread. YUM!  I only used 2 packages of cornbread mix.  I added a can of creamed corn to the mix.  It makes the cornbread a little more moist. I will definitely be making this again.  :O)

I LOVED this recipe. However, my husband wasn't in agreement with me. I think that the issue is that we have different tastes in BBQ sauce. I like sweet BBQ sauce and he likes vinegary BBQ sauce. Next time I will make 1/2 (this recipe doesn't work well for a family of 3-one of whom is a 7 month old baby) and I will then make 1/2 with my BBQ sauce and 1/2 with his in 2 dishes. I've eaten leftovers 3 times and there is still 1/2 a casserole dish of this meal. Once again, I LOVED it. I also did as many others; strained my beef before (although I used venison so there wasn't much fat anyway) and doubled the BBQ sauce.

My Hubby and I didn't like this . I read all the review, and cut the Cornbread back to 2 boxes, which did seem to be the right amount. I didn't enjoy the taste, and hubby thought the BBQ sauce was the wrong sauce for casserole. I used BullsEye Orginal sauce. I wouldn't recommend this casserole.

This is a great recipe!!!  I agree with the other reviews and in the future will reduce the cornbread to 2 boxes.  I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green and 1 cup of BBQ sauce.  In the future I will put it into a deep casserole dish instead of the 9x11.....I found that in the 9x11 the layer of meat was too thin. Overall, my family enjoyed this meal and we will continue have it in the future!

this was good and yes, i too changed just a little bit of it.. for the diced tomatoes- i used diced tomatoes with jalapenos and because the family likes bbq sauce, i used extra.. and the first time we tried it with the cornbread on top.. it wasn't a big hit, i've made this a few times- and they like it better similar to a stew with cornbread muffins on the side.. oh yeah- to make things easier and a little more colorful, i used a package of frozen mixed bell pepper strips.. love all the tastes simmered together.

This was pretty good! I too used a little more bbq sauce *1 cup* BUT, I have to say it is a little over powering. I would suggest using only half cup as recipe calls for unless you are going to make the night before. It was much better the next day as the sauce wasnt so powering. But this is a delicious recipe... Thanks so much for sharing!

Honey barbeque sauce? Not so much. 
Curious to try this with Chorizo (plain) vs. Ground Beef (BBQ). Seems like it'd be a good fit.

I thought this was great!! very good. i did use 2 packages of corn bread as suggested by other reviewers, it was plenty. I also added a little over a cup of BBQ sauce. Of course in my house i sauteed the burger with fresh minced garlic. Other than that it was great all the guys over for Sunday football loved it and one pan served them all.

I LOVE this! It is so different and wonderful! I did everything as follows, but added some cheese, kidney beans, and a little garlic salt. I also just used 2 boxes, I do believe 3 would have been wonderful, but Im glad I didnt use that much because my pan wasent big enough. :) It was delicious though, thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

I really liked this recipe! The meat mixture was great! I did take other cooks advice and I added more BBQ sauce. I used a cup and a half. I used three Jiffy boxes and next time I will definately only use two. But the family said this is a keeper!

Wasn't sure about this one, but loved it.  Unlike other reviews, I needed almost 3 boxed of Jiffy corn bread mix. (I used a 13x9 pan).  I added kidney beans and grated cheese.  Even the kids like it.

I agree that with some changes, this is a very good dish. I misread the recipe when I made it, and only used ONE 9 ounce box of cornbread, which was the perfect amount for a 9x13 casserole dish. I also used a full cup of barbecue sauce at the suggestion of other reviewers. My family loved it and ate the whole thing.

This was a great dish.  I read several reviews and made my own adjustments.  I made the recipe for 6 servings.  I added the onion, garlic, black pepper and a little salt to the meat while it was browning.  I do not like green peppers so I added organic black beans instead.  I used petite cut tomatoes with jalapenos added in, undrained.  I used a half cup of BBQ sauce.  And I used two boxes of the corn bread mix.  Very tasty!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe is awesome.  I made it with only two boxes of corn bread mix and it still turned out great.  Nice meal the whole family likes.

I made the recipe for the first time this evening. My fiance and I loved it! I did add more bbq sauce though. It was very easy to make and I had most of the ingredients already in the kitchen. I definitely will be making this again.

I had everyone asking for this recipe!  Really quick and easy to make.  I used the Del Monte diced tomatoes with jalapenos and it was a really nice addition to the BBQ sauce and gave a little kick.

This is a great recipe especially when trying to convince your young child to eat veggies.  (I always sneak in lots of peppers and occasionally a carrot or two).  However, I put the cornbread into the casserole dish first and then put the beef mixture on top so the cornbread cooks up around it.  Oh, and I top it with a bit of shredded cheddar, too.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I halved it as there's only 2 of us.  Used 1lb of HB and used 2 packges of cornbread mix.  I followed the recipe pretty closely....drained and rinsed my meat first, then added the onion, peppers, whole can of mexi corn and seasoning.  I didn't measure exactyly as I poured in the BBQ sauce, but used sweet and spicey.  I did not drain my can of tomatos and it turned out perfect...not to dry, not to wet.  I also added shredded cheese to the top of the meat mixture before I poured the corn bread on top....even my picky hubby liked it.

This was a nice change from the usual hamburger meals of sloppy joes, tacos, spaghetti, etc.  I only used two boxes of cornbread, which was more that plenty.

Good base recipe.  Skipped the tomatoes and peppers, added garlic to the beef and cheddar to the cornbread.  Will definitely make again.

This was not enjoyable.  We are not a casserole family but wanted to try something different.  Alterations I made included using fresh corn from cob, added can of green beans, a small amount of garlic powder. Didn't care for the texture of the meat nor the taste.  Family indicated that the corn bread on top was "gross".  Obviously won't be making this again.  Disappointed because I can usually find good recipe ideas on this site.

This recipe is good for a midweek meal, when there is little time to cook.  My family likes spice, so I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I too drained the meat before adding vegetables. I used two packages(6.5 ounce)of Betty Crocker cornbread mix and it was just enough. Baked for 22 minutes at 400 - golden brown and cornbread was perfectly done. I also used a can of kidney beans, with red and green bell peppers.

Good, I will make again with a few modifications. First off I took everyones advice and doubled the BBQ sauce. I thought it was good that way but my Boyfriend said it was a little too much so next time i won't add so much extra sauce. As for the cornbread It didn't rise on top of the meat filling. I thinks its because I bought the cheap box mix. I blame the mix not the recipe. I also added garlic... Overall a good recipe thats pretty quick and easy.

Very, very good recipe! My 3 yr. old and husband loved it, too.  I loved the BBQ sauce in it. I was hesitant since I only had spicy, but with the sweetness of the cornbread, it was just right. To cut down the recipe, I used 1.3 lb of beef, half the corn, 1 can of tomatoes undrained. I took the advice of others and drained the meat before adding veggies/bbq, added a clove of garlic and kidney beans. I really liked the addition of those. I also used 2 boxes of cornbread. Next time I may use 1 1/2. This tasted soooo good on a cold, windy day!! We will definitely have it again! Thanks!

I followed several of the recommendations other reviewers provided and it worked really well. I doubled the BBQ sauce, didn't drain the tomatoes, and drained the meat before adding the veggies. One problem I had was getting the corn muffin mix to spread evenly, there were places it was really thick, and places with a very thin layer after I took it out of the oven. This is probably my fault for dropping great big spoonfuls on the meat mixture. I would also say to watch the timer....I only cooked it for 20 minutes and the top was very brown. Overall, it was a great recipe. My husband added grated cheese and sour cream on it after it was baked. Excellent recipe!

I liked it very much. Next time I will make it in individual serving dishes since it will cook more evenly. My boyfriend said it was a little too sweet so I added hot sauce to his and he liked it better.  Great recipe and it looks so pretty in the pan! I will make it again. And I too only used two boxes of Corn bread.

I only made half of this recipe because its only my husband and I. I used 1lb ground beef 1/2 can of tomatos, 1/2 can corn 1 small onion and 1 small green pepper I used aprox 1/2 cup of bbq sauce 1/4 seemed too dry and I used 2 boxes of corn muffin mix. It needs extra seasoning for my taste next time I will add some.

Wonderful recipe and even making half the recipe it made enough for me and my husband for two meals. The homesteader cornbread recipe off of this site was the best cornbread I have had and it will now be the only recipe I use. I made half the cornbread recipe to top this casserole.

My Dad said this was "interesting", but I think the biggest problem that I had was using a sweet bbq sauce. Definitely use a spicy one for this recipe. I used a little less than 1.4 lbs of beef, and only one package of cornbread mix. I also used the whole bottle of bbq sauce, and omitted the tomatoes since I didn't have any on hand. The whole thing fit perfectly into a 9x11 inch pan. I'll probably make this again, I'll just be sure to use a spicier bbq sauce.

I didn't need the full recipe (there's only two of us), so I only used one pound of ground beef, but I left the rest of the recipe the same. I just didn't like it; the ingredients somehow didn't really go together (which is weird because I make recipes with similar ingredients all the time and love them). I think maybe not using bbq sauce but making your own seasonings--worcestershire, soy sauce, spices, etc. might make it better. My husband really liked it, but I don't think I'm going to make it again.

I followed this to a T.  In my opinion this is a step below hamburger helper.  I used Marie Callendars cornbread mix...maybe the sweetness of that is the culprit...but this was not a keeper for my family

This was great!  I actually preparred it in two 2 1/2 Quart casserole dishes and froze 1 for another meal.  I also added another 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce.  This was a very good meal and will be something I make again!

I made this recipe for dinner last night, but I did change a few things due to my taste buds (or as some would say, lack of taste buds):) I left out the tomatoes, onions and peppers, I know I know but what can I say. I also used 18 oz of open pit bbq sauce, and added about 1 cup of mozzerella cheese over the meat/bbq sauce and corn layer before topping with only 2 boxes of corn bread mixture, and we added sour cream to taste when eating.  My husband and I loved this meal.  I got up at 2:00 am to have more and I just had more leftovers for lunch as did my husband.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I believe the bbq sauce makes the dish.  I would probably only next time do 2 boxes of cornbread instead of three.

This was very quick and easy to make.  I left out the corn, but it wasn't missed.  Very tasty, and you can't beat the simplicity of it.

I loved this recipe! I only used 2 packages of cornbread mix and that was plenty. I might cut back to 1 1/2 next time. Mine was a bit sweet but that was because of the barbeque sauce I used. I used rotel instead of plain tomatoes and that added a nice kick. I will be making this again.

This turned out wonderful! I followed it nearly exactly except I added a whole 18 oz. bottle of barbecue sauce since some other reviews said it was a little dry with just the 1/2 cup. When I did the cornbread mix I used two packages then ended up making the third cause two didn't seem to be enough. Three was perfect. It had a nice thick layer of cornbread on top. I will definitely be making this again.

My boyfriend and I really loved this. He had 3 helpings!! I was surprised at how easy and quick it was to make this.  I will definitely make it again! I took the advice of others and drained the meat before adding the vegetables, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This was delicious, inexpensive and incorporated the meat, bread and veggies all in one!

This was really good....very tasty.  Hubby and I really liked it.  My super picky son called it "sloppy joe casserole" and only ate the cornbread off of the top, but that's his loss :) I only used two boxes of cornbread and that was plenty...my family LOVES cornbread, so I didn't want to cut it down too much.  I left out the corn, onions, and bell pepper and used onion powder, and added some garlic and cayenne pepper. I also used WAY more bbq sauce than 1/2 cup (didn't measure, just dumped it in) so that it wasn't too dry.  I will either omit the tomatoes or puree them next time. (per family's request, they want NO CHUNKS!)Thanks for a great recipe...this is a keeper.

This was pretty tasty, but there was way too much cornbread!  I'll make it again with just one package.

I gave it a 4 because I made some changes, it's very good. Changes I made:
no onion
no corn
1 lb. hamburg
1 package corn bread
cook in 2qt glass casserole dish
I added a bit more bbq sauce also (not exactly sure, just made sure all the stuff was evenly coated)

I will make this again. I really think the corn is overkill and there is no need for that much corn bread. If you want the top to look "nice" then use 2 packages. Otherwise 1 is enough but you can faintly see a tomato or pepper poke through the top if you only use 1.

This recipe was delicious. The whole family loved it. There just seemed to be too much corn bread on top. Maybe 2 boxes would be enough? Thanks a lot for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  Easy to make, so good for a weeknight.  I liked the bbq and cornbread flavors.......if I make it again I would add way more bbq sauce.  For the cornbread, I used 2 6oz packets and that was a good amount.

Loved it. Its a great combination of corn bread and barbeque. Can do variations of vegetables in it, or no onions if you have picky eaters.

Loved this recipe.  I liked all of the cornbread mix, however I think next time I will add just a little more BBQ sauce.  Very easy to make and very tasted great.  Also warmed up for leftovers really nice.

I did add the Worcestershire sauce & upped the bbq sauce to 1 cup. I thought is was all right but all four of my kids didn't like it. The two older kids said it was ok but the two younger kids would not eat it.

Very good and Easy. I made it the way the recipe called for, the only thing I did different was add more bbq sauce.
