This recipe was very good. I made during the day on a Friday, we ate it at dinner but it was far better on Sunday. My only adjustment was I added a little more salt. I didn't give it 5 stars because it could have used some other seasoning to perk it up a bit, but very good. I used fresh dill and parsley from my garden.

My husband really liked this.  I thought it was good, but would cut down on the vinegar and omit the pickle relish next time.  Used dill weed instead of fresh dill.
