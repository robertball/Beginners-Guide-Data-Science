For a meatloaf, this was great - possibly the best I've had.  My hubby proclaimed it was "a hit" after our kids consumed most of it (my 14 yr old had triple helpings).  I didn't really make any changes, just a few necessary ones.  I didn't have saltines, so I used bread crumbs.  Also, I had quite a bit of left-over tomato sauce (had the 15 oz size can rather 8 oz), so I mixed half tom. sauce with a good amount of catchup and added another Tbs of corn syrup to match.  Ultimately, I suspect the quantities added up to the original recipe as I didn't use the entire glaze.  Also, I baked until the meat reached 155 or so degrees for about 40 minutes (glazed after 30 minutes) and let rest for an additional 10 minutes.  Came out perfectly moist.  Served this with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  Family was fully satisfied.

I made this for my husband and in-laws. They loved it! I didnt have any of the corn syrup, so I used 2 table spoons of honey in place of it. Also I double the amount of sauce to 1/2 ketchup and 4 table spoons of honey! This was AWSOME! and so easy!

This wasn't a bad meatloaf recipe in and of itself, but the glaze just was not my cup of tea. The corn syrup gave the glaze an almost gummy texture, and the sweetness just overpowered the savory flavors of the meat loaf.  Also, while the loaf was seasoned pretty well, the crackers would need to be crushed to a virtual powder, as we had several mushy spots that pretty much ruined the texture of the loaf. I would recommend using 1/2 cup of plain ground quick oats (oatmeal, in other words, make sure they're the plain kind, not flavored), as they work just as well as a binder for the loaf, you don't end up with a salt overload, and the oats don't lump together to cause mushy bits. Overall, a solid recipe that, for me, required some tweaking. I also added some freshly ground pepper and would recommend adding a pinch of sea salt if you don't use the saltines as a binder.

After battling cancer this year, I have had to change the way I eat. Instead of 2 pounds of ground beef, I used 1 pound of ground chuck and 1 pound of ground turkey. Great meatloaf! I made a few substitutions and added some garlic and worchestershire sauce. Instead of regular tomato sauce, I used tomato sauce seasoned for meatloaf. The topping, I used regular mustard and honey, and did not add the thyme. I will be making again! For a side, try the Sweet and Savory Kale recipe.

This recipe is very good and easy to make with a few changes: used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt; omitted marjoram; used 1/2 cup of oatmeal in lieu of  bread crumps and for glaze use 1/2 cup of chili sauce instead.  Makes 2 loaves and frozed one for later date.

This is similar to how I make it, but I use a can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. It is the best I've ever had!

This is almost identical to the meatloaf my Mom made when I was a kid - a recipe I lost some time back, and am glad to have again.  I double the ketchup & corn syrup glaze, though - I've always had a sweet tooth!

I tried this recipe and tweaked it a little here and there based on what I had in the house.  My family LOVED this meatloaf recipe and I have now thrown out the recipe I've made for 23 years and replaced it with this (with my tweaks).  As a plus, my husband doesn't generally like when I make meatloaf because it gives him heartburn EVERY SINGLE TIME.  When I made this meatloaf he was so excited that he never got heartburn -- not that night or the next day.  Just an added plus.  Both of my teenaged sons loved this as well.  Instead of the corn syrup I used honey and I believe the sweetness of that made all the difference with how much we liked it.

Great recipe. I added 3/4 lb ground sausage and 2 TBS powdered buttermilk and Increased all other ingredients by 1/3. I substituted honey for corn syrup and added a couple TBS sriracha sauce to the topping.  Delicious!! Served with a jar of brown gravy.

I had to make a substitutes: I used molasses instead of the light corn syrup (which gave it a nice smokey flavor). The meatloaf came out nice and juicy.

Delicious meatloaf.  If I were to change or add anything I would add  a little hot pepper.  I only mention this because my family loves spicy food.  Great without the extra heat too.

This was a hit at home.  It was super easy to make and even my mom loved it.  The only thin I left out was the corn syrup (it seemed like too much sugar and not healthy)  and I only glazed one loaf with ketchup.

It was excellent! I felt like it needed just a bit more tastiness to the meat, but with the glaze I made it was good.

There must be a zillion recipes for meatloaf, as well as that many preferences for favorites. I figured that if it was someone's grandma's recipe, then it would be the one to try. Alas, we found it to be very bland and missing  herbs that I find necessary for flavor. It was moist without adding tomatoes to the top. Sorry, I can think of nothing to rehab this recipe .

It was ok.  This was the first time I have ever used marjoram in anything.  I found that the spices combination was not good for my palate.  I will continue searching for the recipe that rocks it!

Great dish. The only thing we changed was increasing the proportions to fit the amount of ground beef that I had and the topping. We used a similar amount of ketchup, and mixed in brown sugar and mustard to taste, and a sprinkle of nutmeg.

I made this with a couple modifications...just because what I already had on hand. I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers, left out the thyme but added a few shakes of Worcester sauce, and used honey instead of corn syrup. I didn't measure the onion and pepper, but I'm pretty sure I put in about double what was called for. Made 1 big loaf & added 10 min to uncovered cook time. It turned out really good! Will definitely make it again! Rating it 4 instead of 5 only because I didn't make it as is.

I enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few changes because I didn't have certain ingredients on hand.  I used fresh basil instead of marjoram, & bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers.  I also added 4 oz of tomato sauce to the ketchup, & added an additional tablespoon of corn syrup for the glaze, as another poster had suggested.
