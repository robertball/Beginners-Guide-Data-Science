I made this exactly as shown. It was very good.  My husband and guests raved about it.  I served it with nacho chips and sour cream to be added as a garnish. I will make it again.  The only thing I will add as a personal note  - it is more of a chili than a soup in my opinion.  And next time I would like to add celantro as a garnish as well.  I think it would be great used in making nachos with melted cheese in the oven!! I will do that in the future too.   Thanks for the great recipe.   (I do not review a lot of recipes but I use this site constantly.  I would just like to say that please chef's stop rating a recipe based on how you changed it up.  Make it first and than if you think it is soooo wonderful submit it as a new recipe.  This is getting out of hand on this site.  And I have noticed a lot of other comments like this. It is in fact changing up the whole "feeling" of how this site started)   Thanks!!

I made this last night at the last minute. I used a pound and a half of ground turkey, a can of fire roasted tomatoes, I left out the Mexi-Corn (I'm watching my carb count) but I added in two additional large chopped red and orange bell peppers, two cans of organic black beans, homemade taco seasoning mix, and because I don't have Rotel on hand, I used one jar of organic chunky salsa. I did not use the chili sauce or jalepenos as my salsa was a medium salsa and warm enough on it's own. I used Bud Light beer. I did saute the onion, bell peppers, and a ton of garlic in EVOO before adding it to the crockpot. This cooked overnight and was ready to go this morning. It turned out very well.

I make a version of this a lot..I've not tried the bottle of beer ingredient, but I would imagine that it only enhances this easy, popular, and REALLY REALLY good dish!!

Chad!  This is good stuff!!!  I made it today on one of our first cold days in southern Texas.  I put everything in the crockpot except for green, red, and jalapeno peppers.  I used a smoked beef sausage link cut up instead of the pork sausage and a Corona instead of the dark beer.  I was so worried about the beer taste that I used only about 2/3 of a bottle and added about a cup of water.  Well, it has been cooking for 5 hours and I have had two bowls already.  It's very filling and the layers of flavor are amazing and come through in every bite.  This is a true TexMex style dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I made this for work and everyone raved about it. Followed recipe exactly. Used Negra Modelo beer and it gave it great flavor. More of a southwestern chili than a taco soup. Served it with tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream. Try putting the chips in the bowl first - you will love it!

What a beautiful dish! Absolutely vibrant colors and lovely smell.  I'm guessing my 12 year old son is liking it, since he's on his second bowl.  I pretty much followed the recire, with a little creative measurement since my can sized were different that the authors.  I left the seeds and ribs in the Jalapenos, and it isn't too spicy at all, (in fatc, I prefer a little more).  A real winner and a future favorite!

I had a girls night in and needed something easy that would feed a bunch.  This soup was awesome!!  The girls all loved it!  I also had some white rice available for those who didn't want tortilla chips and it made a great combo!!

My family loves this great tasting easy to make soup. When some of the reviews said it was bland I made a few simple changes to add a little kick. I only used 2 chicken breasts and doubled the can goods. One of the cans of beans was black beans with jalapenos and my diced tomatoes were the kind with green chiles in it. We like a little kick at my home. My kids love to add sour cream, mexican shredded cheese and tortilla chips.

I used Farmland hot and spicy sausage (this was plenty hot)  I had to forego adding the hot sauce because I knew the kids wouldn't be able to eat it.  I used 2 chicken breasts instead of the hamburger.  Turned out really well, but still kids thought it was too spicy, but husband and I liked it.

I won 1st place in a chili cookoff with this recipe.  I lightened up on the chili sauce by using 1/4 cup instead of the full 1/2 cup of which the recipe calls for.  
Thx Chad!  Good stuff!

I only used half the amount of corn & black beans, and did not add chili sauce or black pepper. Very good and very filling. Would probably be good topped with cheese.

This soup is the BOMB. I made it two weeks ago for company and everyone raved about it. I'm making it again for our neighborhood Christmas party. It deserves every star!! (Used regular pork sausage instead of hot, and eliminated jalepenos because I can't take the heat, but its fantastic just the same.)

I was not impressed with this recipe. Hoping it will taste better after it sits in the fridge overnight. I found it bland even after adding an additional 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, 2 t. garlic, 1t. cumin, and 2 t. cilantro. The beer did NOT enhance the soup at all. Am looking for another Taco Soup recipe!

My family liked this a lot. It was a bit thinner than I was expecting, so I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a some. I also omitted some of the hot sausage and peppers for my kids. All in all it was a nice recipe and I will make it again.

This was a hit for all ages. Used 1.5 lbs of ground turkey instead of beef and 2 hotdogs instead of sausage since that's all we had. Also added 1 diced fresh tomato. Cooked on low for 16 hours. This will definitely become staple in our home.

Made in crock pot, used the meat as suggested in recipe plus added one package of Chorizo sausage as well. Couldn't find Mexicorn so just used plain corn. I added the kidney beans but not the black beans as it was so thick already. Not sure if the ranch dressing was really necessary? I used part of the package but don't think it was really needed as soup already had great full flavour. (I just used a plain normal beer cuz I didn't want to have to buy a 6-pk for one beer).  Soup was spicy and filling, went fantastic with homemade baking powder & buttermilk biscuits to which I added chopped jalapeno and grated cheese! Wow! Great for Canadian winters!

Meh. This was "OK." While I don't think this was terrible, I wouldn't race to make it again (sorry!). Fullly expecting TONS of leftovers, I plan to serve them sometime in the near future (again, this is not THAT bad). I'll have to serve this on a night when I can invite my parents or friends over for dinner tho... my hubby didn't care for this at all (he thought this was too beany / bland). For me, this was super tangy, almost too tangy. To my surprise, I could taste no spice whatsoever. I don't think using hot tomatoes & green chilies, a hot chile sauce or a hotter variety pepper would make a noticeable difference either, so I won't be reattempting this to find out. Another surprise? The beer was totally unnoticeable. I even used a dark, flavorful beer as directed (Bischof premium black lager is all my hubs could find at the Italian market we grocery shopped at this weekend). Serving bowlfuls garnished with Frito's, cubed avocado and shredded Mexican-blend cheese added a nice touch (this seemed more like chili to me, hence the idea). This just needs more spice to appeal to me / us. Thanks for sharing your idea tho, Chad! :-)

Wonderful!  I saved the bell pepper for a topper with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  And I didn't have any sausage but I am betting that would make it even better.

I love the soup and so did everybody else. I had to print the recipe for my aunt. The only thing I  different was use turkey sausage and no peppers. I don't like spicy food so I didn't chance it.  Next time I may add more ground beef and sausage. We ate that so fast I barely had seconds. I feel the same somebody else do on these reviews. You can't make a review on some changes you did and give it less that recipe deserves because you decided to change something. Try the recipe as it is and then rated if you have negative stuff to say. I am sure I feel the same way if I like spicy food and did it as it. I really didn't make many change just no peppers or hot sausage. Thanks and I love the soup. Everybody is asking for it again. Don't know what the beer did but I added that too.

This is tremendous.  
The only change I made was I used the spicy chili beans,undrained, in lieu of the kidney beans and 1/2 c. chili sauce.  Very very very good.  We crumbled Doritos and shredded cheddar on top when we ate it.  Delicious!
I bet sour cream and green onions on top would be excellent as well!

This was a really good chili.  I did add a little chipotle chili powder and a dash of chyenne pepper also and substituted a can of low sodium diced tomatoes and two small cans of tomato sauce for the crushed tomatoes (because I didn't have any). I think it might have been a little on the mild side for us if I didn't add the extra spices.  My husband said it could have used more but my daughter (who is not that into spicy things yet) said that it was still a little too spicy but still ate it.

We love this recipe!  It's in my Top 5 favorite recipes from this site.  I follow the recipe to a tee, and don't change a thing.  It's soo flavorful with some heat.  You MUST add the beer.  It makes a huge difference in the flavor.  I serve it with some cheddar cheese & a dollop of sour cream on top.  YUM!

Chad-This stew is FANTASTIC.. My family LOVED it. My husband is on a low sodium diet, so I used low sodium taco seasoning and low sodium tomatoes. I only used half of the ranch dressing mix, and it tasted wonderful. Just the right amount of ingredients, and my family liked that it wasn't too beany. Modifications I made were 14oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of 28 oz, and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic, fire roasted reduced sodium! I used Heiniken beer, and it didn't taste like beer at all.  Many thanks for a wonderful recipe. When it was sitting in the crock pot ready to heat overnight, my husband wanted a bowl. I warmed it through on the stovetop,
 and he loved that the peppers were *al dente*. So it doesn't even have to slow cook!! :)

Very yummy and hearty! I overdid it with the jalapenos and spices, so it's hot! Lol!

Didn't have dark beer so I used Coke. Will definitely make it again. Thanks, Chad ??

This came out really good! I used a can of refried black beans in place of the regular black beans to thicken it up a bit. I also added better than bouillon beef flavoring at the end. I served with sour cream, cilantro and jalapeños. Thanks for the recipe:)

Delicious!  Had lots to freeze for take-away school lunches for grandchildren.  They absolutely love this taco-chili cross, but because of sports schedules, it stayed in the slow cooker extra long and wasn't "soupy."  Didn't change a thing in the recipe,  and will make this again and again for them.   Be sure you have a pretty big slow cooker!

I liked it and had a regular size bowl with crackers and added some hot sauce when it was finished... It definitely tasted way better the next day as left overs. But my boyfriend on the other hand LOVED it! He tried it the first time as left overs the next day and literally ate half the crock pot if not more! (When I came home from work there was only enough for a bowl). He raved about the beer. All he talked about was how the beer set it off, gave it that extra humph. To me the beer taste was a tad too much and was definitely there but the "soup" (chili) had the perfect amount of spice. It was thick and hearty. Instead of a 1/2 cup of chili sauce I used salsa :-) Also to even out the beer taste for me I added some hot sauce, but the man of the house thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Overall a good recipe and I will be using it again. Like they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach... and this definitely is the key for my guy :-)

This is my favorite "chili"! Made it on the stovetop since my crockpot is only a 4qt and this made too much to fit. Also added some Cayenne for more kick.

I couldn't believe how delicious this was! I made the recipe as directed, with plans to freeze what my husband and I didn't eat, and there was PLENTY to freeze - even after we ate this for lunch and dinner.

My chief complaint was that is was very salty.  I think the combination of the taco seasoning and the ranch dressing mix added too much sodium and it was just too much for my taste.
