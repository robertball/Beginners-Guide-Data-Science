I really appreciate the recipe and I love the cookies.  I had to tweak it a bit because some ingredients I don't consume.

Well, this is a recipe I created and it is definitely a 5 star. I promise this will be as good, if not better than a wheat flour cookie.

**If you want a higher, fluffier cookie, use duck eggs. The cookie will still be soft on the inside and have the finest crisp to the outside. It will also be more stable and not fall apart as easily.
