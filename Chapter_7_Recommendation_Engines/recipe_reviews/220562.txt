I made a huge punch bowl full of this today for a sip and see. Even the guys were coming back for seconds. I will make this anytime I need a punch.

This was a party hit!  Only gave four stars because it is a little too sweet. :)

This was very, very good. The combination was excellent, and the lemon-lime slices add a nice touch. I would probably use a little less pineapple juice next time so the taste won't be quite so strong, though.

Absolutely loved this- sooo delicious! The only changes I made were using Sprite instead of Ginger Ale and not using the entire can of pineapple juice. It was pretty sweet with 3/4 of the can. I also couldn't fit both Sprite bottles in my punch bowl- maybe that's why it seemed sweet with the amount of pineapple juice I used. Will be using this for more parties!

Family loved this, said it tasted like a Mai Tai without the liquor, which you can add individually if you like.

Add dry ice and serve at Halloween in a black cauldron - everyone loves it and the adults can spike with rum or vodka.

Made this for Special Needs Prom... made over 10  batches and still needed more.  It was a HIT.  Then made it for a retirement party and there was barely anything let.

This was a big hit! I did change it a little though, using raspberry sorbet instead of lime sherbet, and only lemon slices, no lime.

I had to use tropical sherbet since I couldn't find lime, but it was still good. My daughter asks me to make this every time we have company.

This is ABSOLUTELY THE VERY BEST PUNCH I have ever tasted!!  Unlike so many of the cloyingly  sweet punches, the lime sherbet gives this a little tartness, but it's still a sweet punch.  It's perfect for a shower, any party or celebration, or to share with a friend or neighbor on a hot day.  Everyone loves it, comes back for seconds (or more!), and several people ALWAYS ask for the recipe.  It's quick and easy to make and tastes more complex than merely three ingredients.  Do yourself (and your guests) a favor, and make this delightful punch for a real treat!  It's a real winner!!!
