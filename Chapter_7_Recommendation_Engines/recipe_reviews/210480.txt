I'm glad I tried this recipe!  The taste and appearance were quite interesting.  I loved the heat of the cakes, and the fact that I could tone it down with a vegetable salad!  I will be making this again!

Really easy to make. and super tasty. I added some water while blending to make it easier to spread out in pan.  Also, we liked it with more onion. Highly recommend
