I cut the recipe in half and poured it into a ready-made graham cracker crust. It was so quick and easy to make. It turned out delicious and not too sweet. I will definitely make it again!

So easy and yummy! Because others commented that it was too soft or runny, I did use two pkgs unflavored gelatin in 2/3 cup water, brought to a boil in the microwave and then slowly added to the cream cheese and sugar mixture with the electric mixer running. It turned out great and was a big hit for our family gathering. I definitely recommend and will be making this flavor or another version again.

I liked the flavor, but like reviewer Karen above it was far too mushy and you could not cut squares. I let the fruit sit in strainer for an hour while cream cheese softened on counter. honestly it was was just too loose, maybe they had higher quality fruit?

I followed all directions w/o variation.  The crust was delicious, but the rest was mushy soft.  It was hard to cut so there were no smooth cut edges.  It was unattractive and hard to serve.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Two tweaks: I purchased a crust rather than making one (the little bit of extra filling I used to fill filo cups); and the 2nd time I made it I reduced the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup. The whipped topping that goes in it is plenty sweet.

Used the exact ingredients and made this cheesecake in a springform pan, then put it in the freezer until ready to serve.  It was just great and very easy to serve from the springform pan.  Everybody loved it and I made it again soon after, same awesome results.  (The "leftovers" were quickly spoken for so I don't know what it was like IF it lasted until the next day!

I made them in oversized muffin tins for individual servings. I used frozen strawberries that I had on hand.    They were a hit!

Made this with 2 packages cream cheese and half the fruit.  Added zest of one lemon. Removed sugar from graham crust.   Quite nice.

I used fresh berries, fresh whipped cream & half coconut sugar. I made it for Fathers Day and my husband, who is not usually big on desserts, had 4 servings before the night was over. Will make again!

Didn't make any changes.  It was delicious and my daughter in law loved it.  She said her mother  made something like it when she was younger.  I drained as much of the berry juice as I could and folded the Cool Whip into the mixture.  It was great and quick to make.  Everyone really liked it.

I used dream whip instead of cool whip, since I didn't have cool whip on hand and, I used an oreo cookie crust. It  was awesome! I also think maybe the problem others had with it being too "mushy" was instead of whisking the cool whip in, they may have beat it in. Thank you so much for a delicious recipe!

I've made this recipe many years ago, always a fave. I too halved the recipe and put it in a graham pie crust. Came out great

I was pleasantly surprised how great this simple recipe tastes! This Philadelphia cheese was bought in error, and was reaching its expiration so was looking for a quick way to use it. What a pay off! Used the frozen raspberries I had on hand and loved the taste combination. It set just fine. Maybe those that had an issue beat in the Cool Whip instead of whisking it in. Will definitely make this again! Yum!
