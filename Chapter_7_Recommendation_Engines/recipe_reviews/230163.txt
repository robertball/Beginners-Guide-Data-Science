I used vanilla whey protein powder instead of the dry milk powder for added protein and they were delicious.

These are super easy and quick to throw together. I used a 1 1/2 tsp. cookie scoop and got 30 balls out of the recipe.  I think they are better kept cold in the refrigerator since they aren't so sticky that way.

This is great.  A perfect snack. I substituted wheat germ in place of the rolled oats. I used the same 1 cup measurement.  Love it!

I also substituted almond flour and flax seed for the rolled oats! Very versatile recipe!
