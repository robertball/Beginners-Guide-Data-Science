I have found so many delicious hot dog recipes since using this site and this one is no exception..It is fantastic, even with the boring veggie dogs i use to save on fat grams! One bit of advise. If you are like me and are feeling lazy on a monday night after a long day at work, do not try to save time by heating the cream cheese in the microwave. Who knew cream cheese could explode!

I am from Chicago & love my Chicago dogs but these were a good change. They sounded so gross, but I was intriqued by the reviews. I hate onions and cream cheese seems so wrong on a hot dog, but they were really good! I had to fight with my mom to convince her to try it, since she was so repelled by the thought. Once she did, she agreed these were great!

How can you possibly improve on a delicious dog? Make this recipe and find out! The warm cream cheese was so delicious with the mustard and kraut! I used Saeuerkraut Hot Dog Topping from this site as a garnish and it was delicious. Thank you, I will forever eat my hotdogs the Seattle way!

I think you could replace the hot dog with a shoe and it would still be tasty.

I am one of those Seattle people that it is a must to stop and get a cream cheese hot dog after the bars.  Try it, so goood.  Another popular topping to go with the cream cheese at these stands is cucumbers

to me cream cheese is the secret ingredient in ALOT of foods!  This is no exception...we served with the saurkraut recipe from this site as others suggested (I have aways hated kraut) But actually I prefered the dogs with it! My family looked at the cream cheese on the dogs.....(it wasn't appealing)...but raved later...gotta get past the unusual to get to what's good! best with polish or spicier type sausages, tried on regular weiners...too boring.

So glad I found this! I used to live in Seattle, and this was one of my favorite late-night treats. I've been craving it since I left! This recipe is superb. If I turn on the twinkle lights and sit next to a cold shower, it feels like I'm back at home. :)

I used brats but I can see this would be great with kielbasi, too (and hot dogs!)  The cream cheese really made it.  I nuked it in a cup for 30 seconds or so to soften.  Per Molle's review, I used the Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping, also.  This is the way to go serving dogs of any variety!  Thanks!

This is the first recipe in countless recipes from this site that I've posted a review! It was that good! 
I HATED sauerkraut, until now. I added a little bit of splenda brown sugar to the kraut, and substituted veggie dogs for regular. EASY, QUICK, tasty. My boyfriend from Chicago looked at me funny when he saw the cream cheese, but changed his mind after two bites.

I tried this with a veggie dog and it was SOOO good! I thought cream cheese on a hot dog would be repulsive but the reviews sounded so positive I wanted to give it a try...and I'm very glad I did!

Wow!! I would have never thought to put cream cheese, onions, and mustard together on a hotdog (I used kielbasa). My daughter was like, mom I don't know about this, but once she took a bite she was hooked. Thanks Dolan A

In an effort to cut some of the fat and calories, I used Hebrew National 97% fat free hotdogs and neufchatel cheese. I also halved the amount of butter to cook the onions in. And still, all I can say is WOW!! These were good! I also topped with the sauerkraut hot dog topping from this site - delicious!

OMG, were these outstanding...the ultimate in guilty pleasure eating!!  We used cheddar brats, crisply cooked and topped them with the onions and sauteed jalapeno sauerkraut.  My boys could not get over what the cream cheese did for these dogs!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Awesome. I am not a hot dog fan at all. I guess I tend to eat them to be apart of the crowd and not be labeled as one of the few strange folks who don't like an American favorite like the hotdog. THe taste of these things are usually less than can be desired..even the beef franks, which is all I eat.  When I do eat them I burn them or blacken them on the grill and top them w/ all kinds of toppings so as not to taste the bologna inspired taste. But despite my finicky taste buds my family loves hotdogs, thus I am always looking for different ways to prepare these so I can enjoy hotdogs with thekm. THis recipe (as weird as it sounds) is AWESOME. I think the cream cheese does it. and the saurkraut topping (found on this site) makes the hot dog an instant Family Fav!!! I will definitely make again.

My kids loved the dog ( of course) and the caramelized onions, but the cream cheese was too rich for them, which surprised me, as they love cream cheese. The rest is great. Not a recipe I needed to look up though, I was trying it for the cream cheese.

I thought this was pretty tasty.  Didn't get a whole lot of taste from the cream cheese, but I think it complements the sauerkraut.

I'm rating this for my sweetheart as I'm not into hot dogs and this was our Cooking Forum's Community Cook-Along recipe choice for this month. Rob rated this a four merely because he loved the caramelized onions and kraut, however, felt the cream cheese was a waste of fat and calories being that it was barely noticeable. Thank you Dolan!

This was a really fun and tasty hot dog preparation, and not something I'd ever heard of or would have thought of on my own. Bravo to Seattle! I didn't do the onions exactly the same way; I had some leftover French onion soup that was really thick with onions, so I just pulled some strips of onion out of that and piled them on my (veggie) dog and (whole wheat) bun with the (lite) cream cheese and mustard, and it was great! Even though I made all kinds of nutritional swaps. :)  This is a very accommodating style of dressing up hot dogs!

We loved these. My only change was to use a regular yellow onion instead of a sweet onion as that is what we had on had. Next time we make these we are going to try with sauerkraut. Thanks for sharing!

These were so good! I think they might be tied for my favorite style of dog (tied with Chicago style)!

YUMMY! I never want to eat my hot dogs ANAY OTHER WAY! Its winter here so no cooking on the grill (unless you're just plain CRAZY). So, I boiled the dogs and cooked the onions and kraut (rinsed it off and squeezed it dry) all together in a frying pan, when that was all done i set it on a plate and put to the side. Then, I put the hot dog buns in the pan to toast em. I softened the cream cheese in the micro for about 30 seconds, and spread it on the bun. Add all your topping a voila! DELICIOUS! Thanks so much for a great way to eat boring old hot dogs!

My daughter told me about this recipe and said her husband really liked it. I tried it yesterday and would not waste my time on it again. I think just a plain hot dog with mustart, reslish & raw onlions was better.

Previous Seattle native rater probably wasn't outside a bar at 2am in Pioneer Square if they've never heard of these.

The first time a friend tried to get me to try one of these I was so disgusted!  Now I make them at home when i want a hot dog!  Its important to note that their best with spicy or smoked dogs and those french buns!  Don't waste this on a crappo bun and dog or you will miss the full effect!

I made half of these with sauerkrat and half without...I never liked sauerkrat...but I liked it much better with and so did my kids I ended up adding sauerkrat to the ones without it.  These were great, a little bit messy for the kids to eat but everyone enjoyed it. This is definitely worth making again.

I made the recipe as written, and it was fine. It definitely had plenty of flavor (which it should, due to the fat in the dog and the cream cheese, plus the caramelized onion and sauerkraut). But I've lived in Seattle for my entire adult life, and was born & raised within 40 miles, and this was the first I've EVER heard of this menu item! I've never seen it offered around Safeco or Qwest Field (where our professional baseball and football teams play) nor around the Kingdome, their precursor. Although I must admit, if this were offered only on late-night bar menus, I might have missed it, as I don't party "after the bars close" these days. At any rate, it was a fine recipe, just nothing spectacular.

My husband grew up just outside of Seattle and I can't believe he held out on me about these for so many years!!!  He casually mentioned them a couple of weeks ago and I said "OMG, cream cheese on a hot dog...yes please!".  Funny how something so simple can turn out to be so delicious!

OK, I've lived 20 minutes outside of Seattle my whole life and I've never heard of nor seen this until randomly searching hot dog recipes on this site. So, of course, I had to try it... Boy, have I been missing out! Needless to say, cream cheese will be in the basket with the buns and dogs when I'm shopping for 'Ballpark night' from now on!

As far as hot dogs go, this is a 5-star recipe. My onion was a small white one; it caramelized fine. I spread my 1 onion over 8 hot dogs, because I wasn't sure we were going to like that flavor; we did and my husband expressed a sort of wistful wish that there were more onions. I forgot to use brown mustard and used regular yellow, which was fine. I skipped the optional sauerkraut because I don't like it, but I think if you DO like it you should definitely use it. My husband commented that these could use another layer of flavor, and I'm sure the sauerkraut would provide that. But I give this 5 stars because I ate an entire hot dog and I haven't been able to eat a whole one in YEARS!

We REALLY enjoyed this! We loved the taste of the cream cheese with the cooked onions and the hot dog. I did omitted the optional sauerkraut (didn't have any). This was such a different and delicious way to enjoy a hot dog. I will definately make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was looking for a way to cover the unusual taste of veggie dogs, and this is certainly a winner!  I never would have dreamed of putting cream cheese on a hot dog, let alone topping it with sauerkraut.  But I have to say this is my absolute new favorite way to eat them!  (I did leave off the onions because I'm not a fan.)  Thanks for sharing!

As a fellow Seattlite, I have to say these are absolutely wonderful.  I like to add red hot peppers to mine as well.  Especially after late night partying.  These are definitely a Seattle institution.  I always get them at "Shorty's"!

Good, casual weekend dinner.  We had these tonight and hubby and I agreed they were pretty tasty!  I used brats tonight but I think this would also be good with good quality dogs.  Served with Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping.

As a fellow Seattlite these always hit the spot! They are amazing made with hot links because the cream cheese cools the great spice and flavor of the hot link.

I'm on the fence with this recipe. I'm not overly excited about it, but I don't dislike it, either.

Only thing I did was add Frank's Hot Sauce because I like spicy food.

I doubt I'll make this again.

Very good. I didn't have any hot dog rolls in the house so I used a whole wheat tortilla. I also used a lower fat hot dog and a lower fat cream cheese. This was a very tasty dinner and I'll definately use cream cheese on my kraut dogs again!

This was different and delicious!!  Will definitely make again.  Almost gave 4 stars because these are hot dogs but decided to go with 5 for originality and surprise.  Thanks.

Surprisingly, the cream cheese is very subtle in this recipe (although it is the winning ingredient).  This dog is very good as is...but if you want to let it fly, get a bigger hoagie type roll and stuff it with what you like.  This great recipe is so strong that as long as you have the cream cheese, onions, mustard, and hotdogs/wieners/sausage, it will lead the way!

Id give this 10 stars if I could.  Soooo Yummy!  I didnt add the sour kraut just because we dont like it much.  But I tell you what, it didnt need it.  The caramelized onions and soft cream cheese go great together!  I spread a little butter on the buns and toasted them on the grill.  Layered them with cheese, onions, the hotdog and topped off with spicy brown mustard.  I knew Id love these because anything with cream cheese is always tasty!  I'll never have a plain hotdog again!

Husband wasn't too keen on the idea of this, but admitted they were better than he expected. I liked it - the cream cheese and sauerkraut does work well together - but wouldn't want it every time we had hot dogs.

This was DELICIOUS! The best part was the cream cheese! We forgot to add mustard,  but we will next time!  Either way, they were amazing! My BF asked for this to be made twice a month.. BTW,  being from Western New York, we use Sahlen's hot dogs..

Although I'm not a big fan of mustard, onion and sauerkraut, this came out pretty good. I don't have a grill or an indoor grill--so I cooked the turkey hot dogs in the oven for a few minutes and left the buns not toasted.  Delicious and filing.

The only change I made was using a healthier option for my meat..... chicken sausages.  I also gave a quick warming to the cream cheese via the microwave.  Other than that,  all was the same and I found it excellent. Seemed to be a strange concoction of ingredients like others had stated however they blended nicely.  I will definitely do again!  Thanx for the recipe!

Whenever I make it downtown I make a point of getting myself a Seattle Dog. So heavenly! However the ones I get at the stands (and occassionally make at home) do not have kraut, but instead use sliced jalepenons and I always use a polish sausage. Not a kraut fan but I can assure you the jalepenos rock this dog!

Easy and tasty. I left the kraut out entirely (neither of us are fans) and left the mustard off of mine, but the fiance said the mustard was a great addition. These seem like great after-drinking food....

Great start to the true Seattle dog! One thing is missing, however... the smoked salmon!  If you don't like fish, do bacon. Our little town in eastern Washington did this and it was perfection in your hand. Thank you for specifying Walla Walla onions! Nothing grills up better than those :)

These were a particular delight because we rarely treat ourselves to hot dogs and sauerkraut due to my husband's sodium restriction.  However, we really watched our sodium the rest of the day to be able to try these.  He drained and rinsed the kraut well, added some chopped onions and pepper cooking that for probably 15-20 minutes.  The dogs went on the grill and we used Edmond Fallot's Dijon mustard (a GREAT flavor)to top it off, along with the kraut on top and cream cheese on the bottom of slightly warmed buns.  What a treat for not only him, but me as well.  We've highly recommended this to many!!  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!!! This was simply amazing. I am from Seattle and have never tried these before. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I've already sent the recipe to ten people. I used angus hot dogs and heated the sauerkraut up in a pan before putting it on top. I also used regular yellow mustard, and they still turned out amazing! It's a must try.

My fave hotdog recipe of all time.  In the last few mins of cooking the onions I added in the sauerkraut to warm it up.  The combo of brown mustard and cream cheese is spectacular...I wouldn't substitute a different mustard.  I made this in homemade hotdog buns from allrecipes.

The cream cheese certainly is something I would never think to put on a hotdog! It was delish! It cuts the tang of the sauerkraut, but that's where I lost my husband on this one. He LOVES the mustard & sauerkraut & didn't appreciate the cream cheese at all. I may very well make this again for myself:)

I personally thought these were awesome. My husband and kids not so much. I am not one ot mix my food per say but I thought I'd try it.   I made buttery onions, used Philadelphia cream Cheese, Used Sabrett Hot Dogs and toasted the buns. I topped with the mustard (which I never put on my hot dog) and they were oddly so scrumptious.  I probably wont make them again only because no one else in my house will eat them but they are great!

I was planning on having my ubiquitous chili dog for a quick supper tonight.  I came across this, & decided to give it a try. Wow! I skipped the kraut, but might try it in the future.  Also used olive oil to caramelize the onions.  Absolutely delicious!

Absolutely delish!  The first time we followed the recipe and it was great.  The second time we used pork sausage instead of weiners and added green chiles to the sauted onions.  Either way, we will definitely eat this again.  I have a 16 yr old and 2.5 yr old and they both loved this...that says a lot!

The lady who has been to events at Safeco and Qwest field is probably one of the locals who never try the dog stands outside the fields. I was brave enough my last trip to Seattle to finally try a cream cheese dog.  What a treat. Looking forward to this recipe.

Hmmm... I don't know why we didn't like these as much as everybody else.  They were okay but we prefer a Chicago style dog.

WOW! This recipe was so odd I just had to try it and I'm so glad I did. I didn't have kraut but did grill some onions with my dog. This is how I'm making mine from now on. Oh, and I used low fat turkey hot dogs and low fat cream cheese- still good!

Very tasty. Husband bought beef hot dogs so I used them to make this recipe. I didn't add the sauerkraut but next time I will add some. Served with cold veggies and Ranch for a fast and simple meal.

yummy yum! i live in seattle and when i used to go out it was a ritual to get these dogs after a long night of dancing! of course this recipe can't compare to the actual seattle cream cheese dog but it comes pretty darn close. will for sure make more often.

I love that you posted a recipe for this. Since I moved to Seattle 4 months ago from Texas, this is literally the best food I've eaten here that I didn't cook myself. I am a purest - just cream cheese and carmelized onions on a toasted bun - no additional condiments. Try it and you'll love it!

I had a hot dog party and chose a number of recipes to try.  I printed out a menu with a number of options so people could experiment.  One of the favorites was this recipe.  I will definately be making it again.  Thanks for the yummy hot dog topping!

These were fantastic!  They sounded so strange I had to try them and I'm so glad I did!  I made them as other reviewers posted, with the Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping also from this site.  Unbelievable!  My hubby and I loved them! If you have any doubts about them, just try them once and you will understand!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Ok, this is now my favorite hot dog! I *loved* it. The onions seriously make it so good. I loved everything about it. I didn't use sauerkraut though because I didn't have any. I'm sure I'll make my hot dogs this way from now on. *So good*

I had to try this hot dog since my daughter has lived in Seattle for 3 yrs. She had never heard of these. Well, I tried these last night with the Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping found on this site. It was heaven. I couldn't hardly wait to tell my daughter to tried these.

I made these exactly like the recipe. Wasn't a big fan of the creme cheese or the caramelized onions. Wasn't terrible, but won't make again. Cheese whiz would have been much better.

My boyfriend who is not a bit fan of onions HAS to have them on these hot dogs.  In fact, he doesn't even like hot dogs...but he requests these all the time...he even makes them for me sometimes.  I wouldn't change a single thing...they are awesome!!

I grew up in Chicago so I ate a lot of hotdogs as a child. In chicago you only eat it with mustard, onions, tomatos, and a pickle spear. So when I saw this recipe I was skeptical to try it. I am glad I tried it. This is so good. I love the saurkraut on it with the grilled onions. I hate brown mustard but I wanted to try this exactly as printed so I ate it with the brown mustard. I no longer hate brown mustard. It went really well on this. Thank you so much for posting.

Oh, my goodness! You can add anything you want to these or just eat them with only the onions and cream cheese (my favorite) and they are great... my family likes them with regular jumbo hot dogs over sausage/kielbasa... we've tried both ways.  SUPER!

I never would have thought to put cream cheese on my hot dogs but my husband and i tried them last night for dinner...VERY GOOD!  the fried onions with the cream cheese makes a wonderful flavor... We did not put sauerkraut on them but they still tasted great... a little on the rich side...will make again!

Awesome! We also used the Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping from this site and it was fabulous together!

My husband loved these!  We had a hot dog bar for one of our kids birthday parties and these were a favorite.

Love this idea... We made hotdogs using the cream cheese idea on the buns and the "Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping" recipe from this site. Made a very very good hotdog!

I read the reviewers comments and decided to cook this using bratwurst since I had some in the fridge.  I cooked the bratwurst using the "Wisconsin Bratwurst" recipe on this site and then I followed this recipe in putting the sandwich together.  The cream cheese was a real winner!
