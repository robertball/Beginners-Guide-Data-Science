My great grandmother was from the Liege region of Belgium. She made her potato salad with equal parts sugar and vinegar (I use 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 wine) to give it a sweet/sour flavor. She also used salt pork not bacon. But since salt pork is difficult to find I usually have to settle for bacon.  Yummy! Just had some tonight.

Good.  I used only a touch of the vinegar for sweetness.

This was good but if you stick to the recipe, you're going to end up with A LOT of bacon grease. I poured off all but about a tablespoon, and that was plenty. I also used white balsamic vinegar which is much more mellow-tasting than the regular stuff (You might want to add a pinch of sugar if you don't like a strong vinegar taste). Thanks.

I had to try this recipe because my parents are from a small town not far from Liege, and this reminded me of dishes at my grandmothers' houses.

I made this for a recent dinner party/barbecue and got rave reviews.  I rarely follow recipes to the "T" when it comes to proportions (other than baking) but I know I used a full pound of bacon.  It was not too much because so much volume was lost in the cooking.  I used more potatoes than called for.  Although I didn't measure it out, I'm sure I did not use 2 cups of balsamic.  I added it about 2 Tbs. at a time and then tasted until it seemed right.  I liked the fact that this recipe is not loaded with oil or mayo.

As I said, everyone loved the potato salad and this will be added to my regular repertoire.

I think this is best served warm, and with a bit less vinegar.

Way too "vinegary" and sour. Taste was similar to German Potato Salad flavor but without the sugar to offset the sour taste. I think canned green beans would have been much easier and quicker than using fresh. The recipe doesn't specify whether to retain or drain off the bacon fat. I drained off most of it for health reasons, reserving just a little for flavor. When I asked my husband's opinion, he said, "Well, honestly, when I came home and smelled that smell I hoped that wasn't what we were eating for dinner!"

My dad used to make this all the time when I was growing up. It's such a simple recipe, but it packs in a lot of flavour, and leaves you feeling satisfied.

I'm thrilled to find this recipe! My Belgian great-aunt made this for me years ago, and I've been wanting to make it ever since. Thanks!

What a great way to combine fresh green beans and potatoes!  My family of veggie lovers thought this was great.  Adjust the vinegar with olive oil and sugar if you are omitting the bacon grease.  This is definitely best served warm.

This is a great hearty winder salad. However, I found the amount of balsamic to be a bit overwhelming. Next time, I will decrease to a quarter of the amount and make more of a balsamic glaze. I also cooked the potatoes for five minutes, then added the green beans to the same pot. I hate washing extra dishes :)
