The taste of this dish is good, but the texture leaves a little to be desired.  A better way to cook the eggplant is to slice it in 1" pieces, place the pieces on a paper towel, and lightly salt them.  Leave them for at least a half hour (2 hours is ideal), then pat them dry.  Cook them at about medium on the stove in some oil, stirring often, for about a half hour or until they lose most of their water and turn a darker color.  The texture and taste of the eggplant really comes out this way.  The rest of the recipe was quite tasty.

Here is my version:I removed the skin on the eggplant and cut it into 1 inch rings, sprinkled it with some salt and let it sit for at least 30 min (to remove the excess water). Then I placed it in the oven and let it bake for approximately 15 min. Then i cut it into cubes and used it as dirrected. I eliminated the cumin seeds. I added 4 med tomatoes, and 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of 1/2 tsp of tumeric, i added 1 tsp of tumeric. I also added 1/2 tsp curry powder and 1/4 tsp of garam masala. I also cooked with olive oil instead of veggie oil. I also added 1/2 cup of water.

At first i passed on this recipe because i thought it would be too much work to broil and peel.  Was I wrong!!!  SUPER easy recipe.  We had an indian night and this by far was our favorite dish.  Perfect soft consistency.  Pick 2 small eggplants instaed of a large one because it will be more tender and not have the bitter flavor some eggplants get when they're too big.  Perfect spices, and the onions are amazing.

This dish was a big hit. I added in curry powder instead of the cayenne pepper. My father usually doesn't like eggplant, but he helped himself to multiple servings of this.

this recipe was very good. usually vegetarian recipes taste as if something was missing, but this one was full of flavour! i made a few changes though. I didn't want a mushy texture so i chopped the eggplant into cubes, drizzled with oil and baked in the oven for 15-20 min. this way it takes away the bitterness and brings out the flavour. i also cubed zucchini and added it at the same time as the onions. i added a couple teaspoons of fungreek seeds, and chickpeas just to add some extra texture. my 3 year old really doesn't like veggies unless it's hidden well... and he ate this up like no tomorrow. i will be making this again.

I was dubious about charring the eggplant in the oven, but it turned out perfectly, and was very easy.  I acutally set the broiler to 500 degrees rather than all the way up, and by the time it charred, all of the bitter juices had leached out of the eggplant and it was extremely soft (no need for pureeing to get it smooth).

The flavor of this dish was very good, though I left out the fresh cilantro because I don't like it.  

I will be making this again!

Outstanding.  I was out of tomatoes so I substituted 1 large roasted red pepper.  I also used 1 med red onion julienned and 2 small fresh purple eggplants roasted not fried.  I recommend letting the skin burn a bit, I also allowed the eggplant to cool and drain before dicing it up.  I finished cooking it and my 14 year old daughter came floating into the kitchen with a euphoric look on her face (she's my most discerning taster), and said, "Dad, what is that smell....hmmmmmmmmmm."  I said, "here, try it."  (she claims to "Hate" eggplant).  I gave her a fat forkful of this with a big chunk of eggplant and her face melted into bliss producing, after a few resonating moments a satisfied smile.  I said, "what do you think?"  She said, "it's amazing."  I said, "thank you, I'm glad to see that you have an appreciation for eggplant."  her mouth dropped and her eyes opened wide and she said,"are you serious? this is eggplant?"  I said, "that's right kiddo, thank you for being open and willing."  This was a big hit and is in my list of staple meals that we eat regularly.

Good...I cut the eggplant in half and roasted it in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes. I also used a can of tomates with onion instead of the single tomato and ground ginger instead of fresh. Definatey low cal, but there is Baingan Bharta (Eggplant Curry) on this website that I think I better.  Thanks, though.

Delicious! Just the right balance of spices. Serve with a yogurt or mint sauce and enjoy it even more.

Great review. I recommend a few changes, however. First, I used a half a can of peeled, diced tomatoes with juice instead of fresh tomatoes. I also added curry powder (1/2 tsp) and garam masala (1/2 tsp). Next time I will add a half a cup of green peas. I also think it may be better to slow stew this over a few hours, so I'm going to try that too.

This recipe was delicious!  I had bought on sale several eggplants for my husband to make eggplant parmesan; however, when I saw this recipe, which seemed more healthier, I decided to use my eggplants to make Bhurtha (I had never tried this before). I doubled all the ingredients and I added green peas as suggested, and two zucchinis I had available. I was planning to freeze the leftovers - no such luck! It was so good that my husband had two servings, I took some for lunch the next day, and we had the same dish again for dinner the following day! I served it with Basmati rice one day, and the next day with boiled new potatoes. Great recipe for my collection!  Thank you!

This was excellent. I'm usually not very good at making spicy Indian dishes, 'cause I can never figure out the right combination of spices. But this turned out great and ohsospicy! :) Thank you.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I recommend doubling the spices.  Broiling the eggplant isn't hard and the flesh will easily come off.  I served this dish over basalmic rice.

I agree with Swandivr22's suggestion: cut the eggplant in pieces, salt it for a few hours to draw out the moisture, pat it dry and then slow saute.  Whether you follow the original prep or do it this way, this eggplant is a winner - easy, savory, not overly spicy (although you can certainly make it that way - I love very hot food), and could win over people who don't think they like eggplant. I served it with red dal and spinach with mustard seed. I'll definitely be making this again.

Much easier than I expected it to be. Also, my boyfriend is not really a fan of indian food, but he loved this. I also replaced the cayenne pepper with curry powder and increased the amount of fresh ginger. It was just spicy enough. I also left the onions still a bit crisp for added texture. We will definitely use this one again!

This was a good recipe, although I will make some changes for next time I try it.  I didn't think the work of charbroiling the eggplant added any flavor.  Next time I will cut the eggplant in cubes and pan fry it.  I used garam marsala spices as suggested by other reviewers.   I wasn't impressed by the flavor that the garam marsala added.  Next time I will use the spices listed on the recipe.

I love recipes. I would just suggest to add green onions instead of regular onions. It gives it a great taste. I also did not add the cayenne pepper but instead added regular chili powder.

I followed this recipe to the letter... and it came out well. There is room to make one's own special improvisations which makes this recipe even better (IMO). i usually cut and salt my eggplant but i DID NOT do that here- as i stated- i followed this recipe as is and it was yummy.

This was delicious!  I diced the eggplant and cooked it in with everything else because I wanted it to have some bite, and I also upped the spices a tad.  We loved it.  Really great vegan dish.

Just made this last night and it was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a tomato and I used 3 eggplants. After roasting them they shrink down alot. Next time I will add some more cayenne or a chili pepper because we like more heat. The flavor was delicious though. I served it over basmati rice with spicy chick peas and chicken curry. It was a big hit!

This will now be by far my favorite recipe for eggplant.  I LOVED it!  It was very close to excellent restaurant versions of Bengan Bartha--and when you make it yourself it's low in fat :-)  I used two medium eggplants and the spices were strong, just right in my opinion.  The spices need to be increased if using larger eggplants. Eggplants didn't cook properly when broiled whole, sliced in half and placed skin up on the broiler pan worked better.  Also, I only got THREE helpings out of this dish (served with lots of rice) so it's definitely one to be doubled.  Raita on top was great.

I'm crazy about Indian/Pakistani food, and I wanted to love this. I've never eaten anything with eggplant that I've liked but I still made this with an open mind. Sorry, but this wasn't good at all. It wasn't the flavor so much but the texture/consistency. I'm giving up on eggplant. Thanks anyway.

This recipe was my first attempt at cooking Indian food. The pressure was on, as my boyfriend and I were attending a party with about 20 Indians, who turned out to all be amazing cooks! With a "rehearsal dinner" making sure the taste was just right, when I chose to add peas the second time, I cooked this, I only had to add a bit more of the spice mix and the flavor mix came out just right (the sweetness of the peas compliments the heat really well). The dish was a big hit at the party, and I'm about to cook it again tonight!

Definitely the easiest and most flavorful recipe i have made thus far -- i don't know how it tasted so good, it was so easy.. plus i could make this to keep as a pasta sauce, throw in some lemon juice and capers and it's heavenly on pasta.

This dish didn't turn out as well as I've had in restaurants but I think it might be due to my error. I'll use a smaller onion and tomato next time.

Man, was this good! The only thing I changed is that I peeled the eggplant, salted mine (it was a little old) and grilled it to cook it.

Loved this!  Made a few changes (of course)!  In addition to the onion and eggplant, I added 6oz broccoli florets, 1/2 bunch kale and used a can of petite diced tomato rather than fresh.  I also used 1 tsp garam marsala and 1 tsp curry powder in addition to the spices called for in the recipe.  Finally, I finished it off with a can of lite coconut milk and it was DELICIOUS!

really delicious!
I made this recipe with some grilled eggplant slices. I didn't have some of the ingredients  (coriander seeds) so added a pinch of garam masala, used 3 cloves garlic. It is a good basic recipe that you can tweak easily. It seemed a bit dry so I added a little water and it was still nice and chunky. Yum.

Awesome. I also added some garam masala to the end product, after it was done, and just mixed it in (I eyeballed the amount, about 1 tsp).  The only other change I would make (which I didn't do this time, but will certainly do next time, is add some coconut milk after getting the eggplant in there, and letting that simmer in to help out with the spicyness a bit. As It is, though, still awesome.  It tastes very close to the old bengan bharta that I used to eat at this restaurant in town, until the restaurant closed :(  I think they pureed their eggplant/tomato/onion together though, then added in the peas.  Whatever the case, it's great!  Thank you!! :)

awesome recipe! This is a great dish to serve any vegan who are coming to dinner. I served the Bhurtha with garlic naan. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I added pepper flakes instead for a nice kick. I also didn't have the cumin seeds but it still came out Deelissshhhhh!

I love Indian food but have always been a bit intimidated about cooking it. This was my first attempt and it was just as good as the take out I normally order. Not as time consuming as I had thought either.

I was worried about the texture, so instead of baking the eggplant and scooping out the flesh, I cut it into chuncks, then soaked in salt water overnight (my mother always does this with eggplants...I think it takes away some of the bitterness). The next day I drained the eggplant peices and placed them on paper towels briefly. Meanwhile, I heated olive oil in a skillet, then added the eggplant and continued with the rest of the recipe.  I added 3 more cloves of garlic for flavor and bam! it was delish.

Really enjoyed this one.  Made it with a side of basmati rice cooked with one can coconut milk.  Definitely double this.  I had myself and 5 dinner guests and with it being doubled it was not quite enough for six.

I just made this recipe for the first time and I think it turned out wonderfully! I did make a few changes because I had a bunch of baby eggplants with bad spots from my garden that I needed to use. I cut them lengthwise and wept them for roughly an hour (coat them in salt and all of the bitterness and moisture seeps out, then rinse and pat dry). I had to cut them up to get rid of the bad parts, so I chopped them and put them in casserole dish with a few garlic cloves, a cherry bomb pepper and two tiny chili peppers (seeded and diced) and coated everything in olive oil. I roasted them in the oven at 400 degrees for about half an hour, turning every 10 minutes.   I followed the rest of the directions as usual except I omitted the cumin seeds, used ground ginger and chili powder instead of cayenne. I also threw in a can of peeled potatoes just because I wanted to make it more substantial. I don't really measure spices either, just throw them in to taste. Also added a pinch of garam masala and ground cardamon. Delish!

I liked this recipe very much!  I love eggplant, so I am always looking for a new eggplant recipe.  I would recommend cooking the onion longer though.  I followed the directions exactly and I didn't think the onions were cooked long enough to "meld" with the other flavors.

I've made this twice, the only suggestion I would give is to have all ingredients ready to go in the skillet like in the cooking shows. This way you don't risk over cooking anything, things cook fast and you can work on the skillet prep while the eggplant broils. I added mushrooms to bulk up the dish and it came out great!!

Prepared this dish the day before serving - waited to add fresh ginger until the day of serving at reheat
ingredient changes: added Zucchini; couldn't find cumin seeds or cilantro, so didn't use them.
Preparation changes - eggplant removed the skin on 2 medium eggplants and cut it into 1 inch rings, sprinkled with some salt and let it sit for at least 30 min (to remove the excess water).  cubed the eggplant drizzled it with olive oil and put it in the oven and let it bake for approximately 15 min. 
Meanwhile I cooked the onions, cubed zucchini (1)  and other spices listed; then followed the rest of the recipe.

Very happy.  I've tried other Bhurtha recipes which were more complicated and yielded bland results.  This was a simple recipe, very flavourful with a hint of spiciness left on the tongue.  I added frozen peas as the recipe hint suggested.  I also substituted cumin powder for seeds because I couldn't find any.  And used leek instead of onion simply because I don't like onions.  Also, I didn't bother peeling the tomato.  I already plan on making it again for company.  This was delicious eaten with naan bread.

There are a lot of supposed eggplant haters in my house, so when I made this, I didn't let anyone know what was in it until they tried it.  Everyone loved it and all said "can't even taste the eggplant".  I made some small changes, I grilled the eggplant (to avoid putting the oven on), added a jalapeno pepper that I had on hand (and we like a lot of heat) and a pinch of garam masala (it just needed a little something more at the end).  I served it over some basmati rice with raita sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was quite good! I never broiled an eggplant before; it was very easy and turned out a great texture. Though next time I might use 2 eggplants or a larger one since I thought there could be more. The only modifications I made had to deal with quantities. Doubled all the spices and the ginger and garlic for my own taste. Ixnayed the cilantro since I don't like it. But all the flavors are there to begin with. Will make this one again.

Good flavor, easy (the eggplant just falls off of the skin), pretty healthy, enough for leftovers. I made it without the whole cumin and with canned tomatoes and it was lovely. Also used the peas, which added to the texture and were pretty against the red tomatoes.

Bangain Bartha is one of my favorite Indian dishes and I tried to follow this as exactly as possible, although I cooked the eggplant on a hot grill rather than under the broiler in the oven. That said, I was very disappointed. The eggplant was stringy and nearly tasteless, even after I added additional seasoning, e.g., more salt and 1 tsp of garam masala. I finally added a Trader Joe's Punjabi Eggplant side dish and the final result was pretty good. Needless to say, I'll keep looking for an Indian eggplant recipe.

I have made this twice, with excellent results. It's a very low-calorie, low-fat dish! I cooked the eggplant in the oven, per the original recipe, because I can do other things while it cooks. Also, a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with liquid does well if you don't have a tomato handy.

These were okay. It was quick and easy to cook. Just seemed like a basic indian dish using the same common spices.

I grilled the eggplant rather than cooking it under a broiler and had great result.  This is really good.

Delicious! I made this for the 1st time last night to bring to a curry party. Great reviews. I made mine spicier, but that is the way I like my curry. I have already emailed this recipe to others at the party.

This was very good.  It was not overly hot, but still very tasty.  I served it over couscous.  I added a can of mixed fava beans and chick peas which increased the protein and added an extra texture to the dish.  Will definitely fix again.

This was absolutely amazing.  I made it for myself, my husband and a guest yesterday and they couldn't stop raving about it! The flavors were all perfect together, the amount of heat was just right for all of us and it was easy & inexpensive to make. The fact that my husband liked it really says something, since he dislikes eggplant and hasn't liked much Indian food to this point.  He wants me to make this again!

Delicious! This was my first time cooking a curry, and it turned out great. I love dishes with lots of veggies, so I would recommend adding chopped carrots, peas, and chickpeas.

One of the most delicious meals i've ever made! After roasting the eggplant the flavor was incredible. i used a hot pepper infused olive oil and a red curry powder in place of the individual herbs. Adding the peas was a wonderful touch and garnishing with fresh cilantro and a sprinkle of sweet currents made this a magnificent meal!!!

was good but not what i expected. thought it would be more flavorful due to all the fun and tasty spices involved. it's missing something...will need to figure what it is and maybe it can get a higher rating. if anyone knows, please do tell.

This eggplant is very tasty! I was afraid that the long cooking time would make the eggplant mushy so I just cubed it and added it to the saute pan after the onions were softened. The eggplant only took about 10 minutes to simmer with the tomatoes and onions.  Our family really enjoyed the flavors.

Tasty!  We used 2 med. eggplant though, and 1/2 can diced fire-roasted tomatoes (I think it needed the whole can) instead of a fresh tomato.  Also added 1 seeded, minced jalapeno.  Only added 2 dashes cayenne and it was still a little hot for me.  Had to broil eggplant 45-60 min.  Followed suggestions and simmered 2 hours and blended in food processor at end, texture/consistency were perfect!  The spices were a little off for me, not bad but not like in the restaurant.  Next time I might omit the ground cumin and add a little lemon juice & garam masala.  Also I would double the recipe as the portions are small.  Served it over basmati rice and mixed in a little plain yogurt at the end per another baingan bharta recipe on this website.  I didn't expect to like the yogurt but I did.  Oh, and I might add some peas next time.  All in all definitely worth making again!

Very delicious! I mushed everything up when it was done. Also, I used an "Indian Eggplant" which was this long green eggplant (I found it at the market labeled as such). This was very good and my husband cleaned the pan after supper. This tasted very authentic.

This dish was amazing! I added mushrooms, curry powder, and garlic and omitted the tomato, cayenne pepper, and cumin seeds because of my younger sister not liking spicy foods and lacking the ingredients. I, as well as my whole family, loved this dish! I will definitely make it again. I just can't express how delicious this dish was!

This recipe is great! I have already made it numerous times and love it as does my family. I grilled the eggplant a couple of times and roasted it too; it comes out great both ways. I double the spices to give it a super kick, the spicier the better.

Excellent.  I adjusted the recipe for 8 people even though there's only two of us.  Of course there was some leftover, but nothing extravagant.; just enough for another meal.  Great recipe!

Pretty tasty but not my favorite dish I’ve ever made. I made it exactly as directed other than using a can of petite tomatoes rather than a fresh one. Good recipe. Fresh cilantro was definitely a fresh component.

I did not have cumin seeds, coriander or cayenne pepper. I used a can of diced tomatoes, and added garam masala as others had recommended. I did not broil the eggplant, but cut it up and salted it. Overall, I really enjoyed this dish, and would make it again. I may try broiling it the next time.

I loved this recipe. I've never made anything like it. I made naan to go with it, and it was a great combination.  Next time I think I will  double the recipe.  I am  wimp when it comes to spice, so I cut back on the cayenne.  I actually  don't think it needs it, so next time I'll try it without.

Loved this. We used slightly less red pepper as my wife doesn't have a high spice tolerance and it was perfect for her. It only makes a little more than 2 portions so I would double or even triple for a family.

Have made this twice. Did not add the black pepper either time. Eggplants can be grown or purchased several at a time. Then follow any online directions to "blacken skin, drain, scoop out flesh and then FREEZE in portions! Saves time tastes great in the dish!

Very tasty. My husband found it a bit too spicy, but I thought it was perfect... that said, I can definitely feel the heat in my stomach after eating it. I served it with Roti and jasmine rice. We would be hard pressed to get 4 servings out of this, but that may be because the amount of eggplant was so unclear. As with many recipes on this website, it would be so much more helpful if weight or volume amounts were specified. I used 2 smallish eggplants, and when I removed them from the oven they “deflated,” and the eggplant was like a pulp when I scooped it out of the skin. I chopped the pulp as directed, but really, there were no “pieces” of eggplant to add to the skillet, just mushy pulp... but I have a feeling this is fine and normal. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty! Quite easy. I went with canned tomatoes, ginger & garlic paste, skipped the seeds as I didn't have them. Soooo the lazier route and still delish. I will make again.

I loved this and I didn't even do it perfectly.  My mistakes were 1.  I had no cumin seeds, so doubled down on ground cumin, 2.  Didn't follow directions to cook onions long enough, 3. My eggplant was small and seedy ..I would cook two next time, 4, I added extra cayenne ..hottt.  Good things:. I added more tumeric.  It needed it.  I had no naan, so filled a pita pocket with mixture.   I just loved it, even with my mistakes.

A-MA-ZING! We couldn’t stop eating it.
One slight hitch...my eggplant exploded in the oven. Not sure if it’s because I forgot to brush it with oil, but next time I will for sure and I’ll puncture it a few times like I do when I’m cooking a potato. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

There were no leftovers! I grow eggplant every year and tend to be the only one in the house that will eat it. This recipe was a hit with those non-eggplant lovers.

I thought this was delicious. I wanted to try making it in an InstantPot, so while the eggplant was broiling, I completed the sauté steps using the sauté function. My dilemma was how much water to add because the sautéed ingredients, even with the tomato, didn’t look very saucy. When I added the eggplant, it definitely added a lot of moisture. I put in 1/2 cup of water, but 1/4 would have been plenty to get good pressure. I pressure cooked for 5 minutes and used slow release.

Awesome dish, pretty quick to make. The yield was a little small, so depending on your family, you may want to double recipe, but otherwise awesome.

Wonderful. Never been a huge fan of aubergine, but this is an amazing dish. Simple to make, easy to rustle up.... One I'll be making again and again.

This dish is really delicious! I used a can of petite diced tomatoes ( fresh tomatoes aren’t in season).  I broiled the eggplants just until the skin was ready to peel off so that the eggplant was cooked but not mushy. All the seasonings were perfect, but I doubled the ginger. Served it over cooked bulgar wheat. Will make this one often!

Okay. So it was super fun and a great experience. I love cooking. My boyfriend is Indian. So I decided to try something new and healthy. I seen this and it was extremely cheap. I followed step per step. But wasn’t expecting the texture to feel like that. Was pretty strange for us. Haha. Also the measurements of  the spices were a bit off. I would suggest for the people who read through the comments , if you love intense flavor and the melting sensations of baked vegetables, I would say add 1 extra teaspoon on all the spices ,that way they veggies will soak the flavors more. Also the eggplant as you’re putting it in the mixture after it bakes, will give off a lot of juice which will make the flavors of the spices  kind of disappear. Before you add the eggplant, sprinkle salt on the eggplant that way the salt will melt into the eggplant giving it just the right balance. I liked this meal and will definitely cook it again sometime. THank you to the people who shared this video. I can’t wait to see what else I can cook ?????

This was delicious and so easy.  I pretty much doubled the spices  called for in the recipe.   I took another reviewer's advice and cut the eggplant into small pieces, salted them and let sit for an hour , patted them dry, then cooked them in some oil until all the water had been cooked out, then followed the recipe from there.
I wanted it to be more saucy so I added some tomato sauce to it.  Next time, I am going to try using a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid instead of using the tomato itself.

I also made the basmati rice with peas from this site and raita, also from this site and served it with warm naan.




 August 21, 2018      Made this again tonight.  Adding the canned, diced, tomatoes was the way to go for us.  I still doubled the spices and, again, It's 5 stars for us.
This time, I served it with Indian tomato rice from this site, Beet yogurt salad, (also from this site) , and warm naan.
Just great!

This was amazing, especially the next day as a leftover with basmati rice.  After reading several reviews, I peeled the eggplant, cut into chunks, drizzled with olive oil and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  We like spicy, so doubled all spices, including garlic and onion , plus 1 tsp. curry powder, 1/2 tsp. garam marsala, 3 tbsp. grated ginger,  used 1 1/2 cups of canned diced tomatoes with the juice (instead of fresh tomato), 1 cup water,  one can of coconut milk and 1 cup of frozen peas. Simmered for 30-40 minutes so the eggplant was super tender.

I made a "redneck version" of this as I'm recovering from hand surgery and have a ton of eggplant coming from my garden. I used 3 Japanese eggplants cut into small cubes, salted them and let sit in a colander for a couple of hours -- rinsed, then used dried/frozen/canned versions of everything except garlic. I cooked the garlic in ample olive oil, then added frozen chopped onion and half a can of organic tomatoes, then added the spices and cooked for a couple of minutes. Last I added the eggplant and frozen peas, then cooked on medium heat stirring frequently until the eggplant was thoroughly cooked through, maybe 20 minutes. It was delicious and would have been even more so with fresh ginger and fresher spices. I didn't have cilantro on hand, would have been a great addition.

Very good. I made some prep changes: peeling, cutting up and microwaving the eggplant made things much simpler. Also, I dipped the tomato in boiling water to peel it, much better than using a peeler.

A+/excellent recipe - I diced a large eggplant [skin on/ uniform pieces], tossed in olive oil and roasted in 375 degree oven 20 min, stirring often.  I did not have cumin SEED, so just used twice as much cumin grounds. I roughly doubled all the spices as we like our food spicy.  I used 1/2c diced cherry tomatoes for the one tomato. I did have to add some water to the pan as the eggplant was not mushy, thus did not make a lot of liquid.  Served over saffron Jasmine Rice. I would make this again.

Very tasty recipe. Has a bit of a kick so reduce cayenne pepper if you don’t like it too spicy. I didn’t change anything. One note though - you can bake whole aubergine in oven rather than grill it as suggested here. Bit less work.

We added a sunny side up egg on top for some protein - what a perfect dinner.  Also, I'm not a big onion fan so only used 1/2 the amount, but doubled up on the garlic and ginger.  Definitely will make this again.  Soon.

Yum! I followed the recipe closely but, got confused when scooping out the eggplant. Thinking: "is it meant to be this smooshy?". Turns out, it is AND is so, so yummy.  I used 2 small/med eggplants and it made enough for two. Would double next time so I have some left overs! It is pretty spicy so be careful with that cayenne! such an easy and authentic curry!

Really liked this. I followed the recipe except I used diced peeled canned tomatoes, cut the cayenne in half and added chick peas for protein since we were having it as a main dish. Will make it again.

I absolutely loved this.  I used 2 eggplants and 3 small tomato's.  I should have cooked the eggplant as it was written but it was still fine.  Amazing spices.

Absolutely delicious way to make eggplant. This is such a satisfying and flavourful dish, it could serve as a vegetarian main or a side dish. I made exactly as the recipe directs except omitted the cilantro since hubs can't stand it. I think parsley might work too and may try that next time.

This was good.  My eggplant disintegrated into a paste, but I didn't mind.  The eggplant I put in the freezer after roasting and mashing would be good in this dish, and a great way to use up what I've put aside from the summer garden.

I made the recipe as written, including the 1/2 cup of peas.

Instead of broiling, I roasted the eggplant whole  at 350 degrees F.

After simmering everything together, I used an immersion blender to get the texture I wanted.

I had bought two eggplant when they were on sale at the grocery store and planned to make eggplant parmesan with it. I changed my mind when I came across this recipe. This was wonderful. I have never cooked eggplant in the oven this way before and was surprised at how easy it was and at how easily the peel came off. The recipe itself has wonderful flavours and is so simple to make. I easily made this on a busy weeknight.

Yummy!  I added white beans for increased protein and a little bit of garam masala.  Served with pita, plain yogurt and hummus.  It worked well for us!

I absolutely love this dish! My favorite local Indian restaurant makes this and it's one of my favorite dishes. Tastes just like theirs and it's cheaper for my wallet! Only problem I found with this recipe was that it didn't make anywhere near enough! In order to want to share this I will be quadrupling the recipe next time so I can share and have leftovers because my family and I can't get enough

Great recipe.   Perfect balance of flavors.   I followed others' suggestions by slicing and sweating the eggplant with salt before baking.  Only other thing I changed was an added dash of Garam masala.  Would make again.

Absolutely delicious!  Had to stop myself from having a third helping.  I cubed the eggplant without peeling it, 
threw some olive oil and black pepper on it and baked it  on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Plus, I think it helped the consistency from becoming mushy while it was cooking on the stove.  I like my food chunky, so I didn't puree the eggplant. Towards the end of cooking it , I added a some (based on desired amount) Rotel tomatoes to add fluid and more taste. I kept all the spices the same with loads of cilantro.  Next time will add more veggies. Enjoy the recipe!

I ended up following another recommendation on salting and  cooking the eggplant in a fry pan. Take the time to use the salt and let it sit for 2 + hours vs broiling it. I did not have fresh ginger so I used ground. and did not have cumin seeds so I used ground as well. Absolutely fabulous blend of spices.

I added chickpeas which made it even more delicious and filling. I'm new to cooking so I really didn't know eggplant was full of so much water until after I broiled it. I wish I had seen the review earlier where someone mentions cooking it differently and adding salt. Anyway, the flavor is a different story. This is my first curry and it bursts with flavor. Being engaged to an Indian man I already had many of these spices in our kitchen. I added Thai chilis in place of the cayenne and finished with a bit of lemon juice. I'd make it again, next time dehydrating the egg plant (my own error) and probably adding coconut milk !

This recipe is SO delicious I can't wait to make it again!  Not a bit went to waste!!!   I almost hesitated to try it having used my broiler probably all of twice and a few reviews about the texture being mushy.   My Fiancé and I had no issue with the texture.  We liked it mushy and all!  I'm glad I stuck with the recipe as written.  I also made the Naan  recipe by Mic with garlic, and it really complemented this dish very nicely.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  It's definitely a keeper.

I grew eggplants this year and was looking for a new recipe to use them in. This was so tasty, my husband and I loved it. It had a ton of flavor. The one change I made was instead of cayenne pepper I used a fresh Serrano from the garden. It was just the right amount of spice. I will definitely make this again!

I did not have cumin seeds so I used ground instead. This was so good.  I will be making it again and again. I cannot wait to share is with my daughter who is vegetarian. This she will really enjoy. The flavour is outstanding. Thanks for sharing. :) 
I made this again for my daughter and she also really enjoyed it. She came out this weekend and asked me to make it again  :)

I must admit alone, it is a little overpowering to a sensitive pallet but I served it with basmati rice and a dollop of light sour cream (plain yogurt would work well too!) and it mellowed it enough to make it amazing.  A few people said it needed more salt but a few said it was fine as directed.  Salt is a personal taste in my opinion so the way it is written is good.  Salt can always be added but not taken away right?  Oh and I went with the option to add peas, any reason to add more veggies is good with me.   I have to remember this recipe.  Affordable and easy AND yummy! Can't beat that!

I loved this. I doubled the recipe - I doubled everything except for the onion, which I still used one of. I didn't have any cumin seeds so I skipped that step. My husband thought the ginger taste was too strong, but I disagreed.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit. The only modifications that I made were to add additional garlic and turmeric.
Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe! I made it just as it says, and it turned out wonderfully. I think next time I will bbq the eggplant to give it more of a smoky flavour.

I am not an Indian but enjoys Indian dishes and and enjoy cooking their dishes as well.  I have done this before and as traditionally prepared, I roasted the eggplants on open flame (using my gas stove) until the skin turns black / charred but the insides are evenly soft.  Instead of cayenne pepper, I use chili powder.  I had the time to prepare it again tonight for dinner, and I have attached a photo of the outcome.  Best eaten with roti (Indian flatbread), or similarly a tortilla.

Very good recipe. I modified the recipe a little by adding one chopped and boiled potatoe, 1/2 teaspoon pav bhaji masala, 1/4 teaspoon curry leaf powder and finally mashing the dish a little. It felt downright yummy.

I've been making this recipe since I first found it some time ago. It's delicious as written. Today I wanted to make it but didn't have any fresh tomato's so I used a can of diced tomato's with their juice. Still delicious. I always add a small dollop of sour cream to each bowl before serving and a couple of drops of lime juice. Thank you so much, Simmig, for one of my favourite recipes!

Seriously, I was convinced this was a disaster until the moment I tasted it; had a great spice & legitimately tasted like an Indian eggplant dish (please excuse my ignorance. I grew up in an area with a large Indian & Pakistani population & have always loved their food, but have never been good with names of dishes outside of the basics).

The only way I like eggplant is in Bhurtha  - I got an eggplant in my vegetable share, so tried this recipe.  It was easy and delicious!  My first time cooking eggplant and I loved it!  Followed the recipe pretty religiously - but used a white eggplant since that is what I had handy.

My wife and I live near Seattle and once tried a surprisingly good hole-in-the-wall indian place near pike. And they had pretty good eggplant Bhurtha there. But I couldn't but think I could cook a better recipe myself at home. And this recipe made that possible. One of my all time favorites. 10/10 would eat.

While this was kinda good, I have definitley had better Indian eggplant recipe before.  Where's the curry??  I served this over split whole wheat sandwich rounds instead of naan to save some calories.

Great recipe and quicker than salting the eggplant.  If you aren't comfortable cooking with spices - this may not come out right the first time ** 

I highly recommend using fresh ingredients and spices to get the full flavor :)  I used a red onion instead, and added a sliced serrano about two minutes before it was done, then set the flame on low and covered to add some spice throughout.   

Make sure to put spices directly onto the hot oiled pan before folding it into the rest of the dish to bring out the flavor. Covering the dish at the very end on a low flame will help moisten the dish if it's too dry and eggplant isn't reducing (see more about this below)

About the eggplant - I put the oven on 375 for 30 min. and was a little impatient and didn't wait for the skin to blister, albeit it was very easy to get the meat out (will use a higher temp next time)  - easy solution is to cut the eggplant in long slices when cooking and at the very end cover with flame on low and smash everything down once it's nice and soft.  

**If this didn't come out right for you with the level of spice - I recommend practicing with everyday dishes. Breakfast eggs and potatoes are my guinea pig with Indian spices and ingredients ;)

we love indian food so this totally worked for us.. didn't broil the eggplant.. cubed and left the skin on and roasted in the oven at 400 for half an hour.. followed the recipe after that.. only had ground cumin, no seeds so i skipped that step.. didn't feel it needed the cilantro.. bf agrees that this dish stands on it's own.. ty for the recipe

Super easy to make and absolutely delicious! I used olive oil instead and added a cup of peas. I didn't bother peeling or de-seeding the tomato, just chopped it up and turned out great! SO is not a fan of indian food but loved this!

Amazing!  Eggplant is something I stay away from at the super market because I haven't found an easy enough way to cook it.  With this recipe, a brief broil and peel makes this dish a keeper.  The seasonings can be tweaked a bit for flair and heat.  Enjoy!

When I first made this dish I thought it was ok but wasn't jazzed about it. My better half came home late so the dish sat in the fridge for a few hours. When I reheated the dish and served it with chappatis I found I liked it much more. He liked it as well. He thought the tomatoes made it quite good. Thanks to the author for sharing.

Very tasty.  Will make again.  To make a more saucier dish, I added a few tablespoons of water when cooking the onions/tomato.  Per a suggestion from another reviewer, I cut the eggplant into 1 inch pieces (with skin on), salted them and let them sit for a bit, before rinsing and baking at 350 for about 30 minutes.

This tasted great! Due to evening time restrains, I actually cooked my eggplant in a slow cooker all day (NOTE: have to use a lot of water with eggplant as it soaks it up). This greatly reduced my cooking time at supper.

I'm not sure if I used too small of an eggplant or too big of an onion, but this tasted way more like onion to me than it did like eggplant. Also the picture makes it look more saucey, but this was pretty dry. The seasoning was good, but would have been better with more of a sauce.

I roasted the eggplant on my gas stove top without the oil – 15 minutes, turning 4 or so times…..  Easier and faster……  let cool, remove charred skin and slice.  Reduced cayenne pepper and added  2 minced serrano peppers. Overall, authentic taste, and a great recipe.

This was DElicious!  I didn't have turmuric, but it was still really good.  I almost think you could use 2 eggplants with this recipe.  But the flavor was fantastic.

this was wonderful and spicy. we added a spiced indian powder to it instead of the tumeric since we didn't have one.

This was wonderful!  I needed to use my crockpot so after I broiled the eggplant I just threw the rest of the ingredients into the crock.  I did saute the onions but I skipped the cumin seed roasting step, used two cans of stewed tomatoes, powdered ginger and added a handful of shredded chicken breast to fill it out a bit (the eggplant cooked down more than I'd anticipated).  Anyway, it cooked on low for 4 hours and it was super delish with some rice in the rice cooker when we all came home hungry and tired.

Very good. This is one of my favourite Indian dishes. Cooking the eggplant whole as described worked very well. I was going to cut it lengthwise first, but then I thought I'd just try to do it whole, as described and it worked great.

It was a fairly good flavor but it was just a bit too wet for my liking.

This was awesome and fairly simple to make! Made it as an experiment for my boyfriend and myself before I serve it to guests and we LOVED it. The heat was a perfect amount, the flavors were outstanding, and it was all very easy and cheap to make. I will be making this recipe many many many more times.

Delicious! Very enjoyable. Being a bad vegetarian, I added some chicken (fried it in with the onions in 1" strips), and I think it made the texture a little more enjoyable. The spices were great, though, and we both really liked it! We'll definitely make this one again.

this was good, but it wasn't particularly flavourful, or at least not what i was looking for. everyone did eat it though, and it certainly wasn't bad, but i'm going to keep looking for an eggplant recipe that i really love.

this was tasty.  i thought it tasted a little strange, so i decided to puree it in the blender since that is how i've had it at indian restaurants.  i preferred it pureed.  i served it with basmati rice.  i thoguht the spice combinaiton was a little boring.  very similar to 5 other curry recipes i have.  i guess i was expecting something with a little different spice combination.  i would probably make it again but i am still searching for something different.  the more days it sat in the fridge, the spicier and more flavorful it became.

Spectular flavor but like many have said, the texture is a little strange.  Still, I'd recommend it to anyone.

The dish came out great. The only difference was that I used garlic paste and ginger paste.

Maybe I did something wrong.  It just was not good.  Most of it is still in my fridge, uneaten. :0(
