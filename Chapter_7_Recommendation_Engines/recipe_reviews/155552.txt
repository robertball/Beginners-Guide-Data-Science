I was unsure about the onion & celery being uncooked in this dish but made for a healthy dinner party with crab cakes and red pepper sauce. Perfect together and the quinoa was delicious and vegetable crunchy. I introduced quinoa to friends with this dish and they loved it. When serving, I packed it in a 1/2 cup measuring cup and it stayed molded on the plate. I topped it with a stem of rosemary and it was pretty and tasted wonderful. Nice side dish.

Yummy!  I boiled my quinoa in stock, and found it a bit too intensely flavoured.  Next time I'll use 1/2 water and 1/2 stock.  I added chopped red pepper and cucumber as well as the zest of the lemon I squeezed.  Very yummy salad, thanks for the recipe!

Very good side dish.  When I make it again, I'll add the spices to the water so the flavour blends into the grain, and since I'm not vegetarian, I'll use chicken stalk to increase the flavour.  I don't like pine nuts & substituted whole cashews. I sauted the veggies & cashews in a little olive oil for a nice hot supper for myself while the family is away.

I made this recipe as a side dish and it turned out great. Loved the crunchy texture and the bright lemony taste. The next day I added a little olive oil to the cold leftovers and that was my lunch.  One thing I did do, after reading several articles on quinoa, was rinse it thoroughly before cooking it.

This was a delicious recipe! I didn't have any pine nuts, so I used some slivered almonds instead. I also left out the parsley, because I didn't have that either! Even with these changes, the quinoa turned out great and was very tasty. Thanks for the recipe; I will be making it again!

I loved this dish.....I did omit the celery and pine nuts since I didnt have any on hand...I did sautee the red onion,garlic, and a diced zucchini and added that to the cooked quinoa. Loved the lemon juice flavor and enhanced that by adding the zest of a lemon as well. Very fresh tasting. Very healthy. Will make again!

This was the first time I prepared quinoa, and I won't be looking for other recipes...  I did make some changes to the recipe that I will use the next time:  I sauteed the vegetables (used a shredded zucchini in addition to the onion), added curry in addition to cumin (actually by accident - I grabbed the wrong "c" spice and it was added before I realized it) and used slivered almonds (that I browned in butter) in place of the pine nuts.

Now this is some pretty good stuff!!! I love the flavour of the lemon mixed with the spicyness of the cayenne pepper! I threw in some dried cranberries for good measure too - awesome meal! Thanks for the recipe! A definite keeper!

I loved this recipe.  Healthy and delicious. I added the veggies and spices while it was still in the pot.  Didn't have pine nuts, so used toasted pumpkin seeds.

I've never cooked quinoa at home before, but this recipe reminded me of one of my favorite dishes from a local restaurant, and I just had to try it. So glad I did!  I thought the lemon was refreshing and tangy, but not overpowering (although I love lemon -- so maybe add bit by bit until you get the flavor you want.)  I used cucumber instead of celery, added a little red bell pepper, and cooked the quinoa in half chicken broth-half water. I omitted the pine nuts since the recipe I was trying to recreate didn't have them.

I liked this recipe. I am always looking for new ways to prepare quinoa, and this one was different and tasty. One comment, however: quinoa is actually a seed, not a grain. Just like to keep things accurate!

Super delicious just as the recipe is written. No modifications needed. The taste can be altered by poor tasting celery, parsley, lemon or onion, so since you don't cook those ingredients use the freshest you can find.

This is a great recipe, but I did need to make quite a few changes to make it perfect for my family.  First I found that it was a little dry and needed more flavor, so I doubled the amount of Lemon, and Cumin.  I left the cayenne pepper the same since my children do not like spicy food.  I also added Garlic, 1 tbsp of Lemon zest, 1 tbsp of sugar, 1 tsp olive oil, shredded carrots, red bell pepper, and grape tomatoes.  I took out the pine nuts and cut the amount of parsley in half.  I will normally serve it on a bed of arugula, with grilled chicken strips.  I know it is a lot of changes, but this is a great base recipe that has become a family favorite and is always on the request list for neighborhood BBQ's.

Fabulous!  I will be having this again!  Also, this is a very substitution friendly recipe as others have mentioned (curry powder, raisins, toasted pumpkin seeds or other nuts, cilantro, couscous, etc.)  It's great as is and as a starting point for creative cooking!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This is one of the best quinoa recipes I have ever seen.  I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts because the almonds were half the price of the pine nuts.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon because that is what I had handy. I added a teaspoon of curry powder after reading other reviews.  I didn't add any salt (I prefer food less salty).  This was tasty, refreshing with just the right amount of crunch.  This will make a great potluck dish.

Not my favorite - made the recipe as is - too lemony for my tastes.  Very acidy - felt like I was missing something.

I doubled the recipe so that I could take some to a BBQ and have some for home as well. I substituted the pine nuts with chopped almonds and added 5 thinly sliced baby carrots and half a yellow pepper. At first, after I made it, I felt like it was missing "something".  I had my son taste test it and he agreed there was "something" missing.  So I added a little more cumin and cayenne pepper (maybe about another 1/4 teaspoon of each) Plus I added about 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano.  After I mixed everything in, I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving.  It was DELICIOUS (and very colorful).  A huge hit at the BBQ.

I liked the taste of this, except for too much celery for our likes.  When looking at the recipe I knew that was too much, so I cut the amount in half. Next time I'll cut it down a little more even.  Using fresh-squeezed lemon juice is a must - very tasty!

This is pretty good.  It felt like it was missing something though.  Next time I will try boiling the quinoa in half water and half stock for a little more flavor and maybe snip in some sun dried tomatoes.  One thing I like to do to add a little more flavor to my quinoa is toast is first in a skillet before boiling it. Stir with a spatula over medium heat, rinse over a fine mesh strainer (to wash off any possible bitterness from the coating), then boil.

This is delicious!  I would have given this five stars but I found that cooking the Quinoa in two cups of chicken broth gave it a better flavor than in water and eliminated the need for salt.  So I am giving it four stars.  So good and a nice accompaniment to any protein dish!

This was good, I would change a couple of things.

1st - Definitely saute the onions first, 5 minutes!!  When they are raw there is way too much of a bite and the onion overwhelms the dish.  Sauteed is so much better!

You don't need to add salt to the cooking of the quinoa, just salt to taste when all ingredients are mixed together.

This was delicious. I tossed the celery, onion and seasonings in with the quinoa because I am lazy. :) Added pine nuts and lemon juice at the end.. just now realized I forgot the parsley.. oops will add that to the leftovers. It was very good and not too lemony for me

I love quinoa, but this seemed to be lacking something for me.  I think it needed a little bit of a kick.  If you like lemon, you will definitely like this, though... very lemony.  Thanks!

I used walnuts instead of pinenuts, black pepper for cayenne pepper, and broth in place of water.  I added carrots for sweetness and grated the peel of one lemon to give it a little more citrus.

I had high hopes based on all of the reviews.  I liked the crunchy of the celery/onion/pine nuts but the whole family didn't like the cumin/cayenne/lemon combo.  I will keep searching.

Loved it! Made per the recipe, served the pine nuts on the side, tried it with and without the lemon juice and it was delicious both ways.

Delicious and tasty. I doubled for a potluck and it was all gone. A really great side dish to have for your friends who cannot eat wheat & for vegetarians.  I used the tri-color quinoa from Trader Joes and as suggested, chicken broth instead of water. This recipe is sort of like a taboulleh for quinoa. I did add an entire diced English cuc & three plum tomatoes, and not quite as much parsley as called for, about 1/2 c and salt. Lots of color and great taste! A great way to use this grain.

This is the 1st time I prepared quinoa, and it was important that my husband didn't feel it was bland. The only thing I did different was left out the parsley only because I didn't have any on hand. Other than that it was to the 'T'. We both enjoyed it and I will make it again. There will be one adjustment; only 1/2 the lemon juice will be used. It was just too strong for our taste. Thanks so much for the recipe. Happy cooking!

It was okay but not my personal favorite.  Too much like bird seed.  My husband really liked it and my 8 year old went back for seconds so I guess it was not all bad.  I will try it again maybe without the cumin since I am not a huge fan of that spice. I did saute the onion and celery in a little butter until they were soft because  I wanted to soften the onion taste and I hate raw celery.  The pine nuts were great!

This may be an excellent recipe with a few more additions since the flavor is all lemon rather than a nicely combined flavor. It is, however, a very healthy addition to any meal and I would recommend anyone try this as a base recipe and be creative with extras.

This was good. I did find the lemon juice made it  slightly bitter, so next time I'll try a bit of lemon zest instead. Really nice flavor otherwise.

Quinoa is such a versatile (and yummy!) grain.  This turned out to be a nice light side dish!  As noted by a couple others, I also did not like the thought of celery mixed in, so opted to sauté zucchini with my onion before hand.  I also added the cumin, cayenne and salt to the water with the quinoa.  Also added lemon zest with the lemon juice at the end, but was unfortunately out of fresh parsley.  Turned out great, thanks for sharing!

If you don't have pine nuts, slivered almonds are a good substitute. Toast them in the same way.

I love all the lemon flavoring. I will cut back on the lemon if we had young taste buds at the table, because my daughter was puckering up whenver she had a bite of the quinoa. I have only made quinoa one other time, but after this effort, I think I will work it into our menu at least once a month.  Its a nice change.

I omitted the celery (husband doesn't like it) and subbed red peppers. I also sauteed the onions and red pepper in olive oil before adding to the quinoa. I thought this recipe was delicious. Light with a little bit of spice! Thank you.

Our family loves this side dish with grilled salmon.  I have a tough time finding/keeping from going rancid pine nuts so I usually omit them, but it's still wonderful.

This makes a great side dish or luncheon salad.  I used toasted slivered almonds instead of pine nuts (can't get them easily out here), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  When adjusting the salt and pepper I realized that the dish absolutely required carrots; what a difference a little bit of chopped carrot made.  Had leftovers right out of the fridge for lunch the next day -- great!  Thanks, MBlassnig, for a delicious quinoa recipe.

My husband didn't love this but I thought it was very nice. We both liked the texture and taste provided by the toasted pine nuts. I used veg stock instead of water for more flavor (and therefore omitted the salt), white onion in place of red, and 5 large sprigs of Italian parsley. It was a little too acidic and seemed to be missing something when it was served hot, but it had a mellower and more pleasant flavor when it was served cold the next day. I will make it again but I will only serve it cold, so it would make a great addition to packed lunches.

I just made this for the first time and its yummy, I'm usually not a grain type of person but it made a nice change from potatoes or salad as I had it with a piece of salmon.  I didn't change the recipe much but after reading some reviews I put the spices in the water and cooked it like that, I added celery leaves instead of parsley and some chopped red pepper along with a small amount of onion, no nuts (they get stuck in my teeth). Can't wait to have it cold for lunch tomorrow.

Very Good base recipe, I did need to add some garlic and increase the spices to make it more flavorful, and I used veggie stock rather than water and that helped with the flavor as well.  Quinoa is a delicious, healthy grain and I am always looking for different ways to prepare it.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this!  We made a lot and it was an easy meal or snack to grab and eat cold.  I added some julienned carrots, slightly steamed and they went perfectly.  I do think it needs heavier veggies, so I doubled the celery and onion.

I loved this recipe. I did a few changes though. I sauted the onion and celery first, just until they softened a bit, not mushy. Then I added the lemon juice just before all the water had cooked out and let the lemon juice cook out as well.  Wonderful!

We really liked this! Made this to accompany Whitefish for guests eating gluten-free. Even my husband, who  doesn't like anything "healthy" (Lol!), enjoyed it! I used chicken broth to boil it, didn't add all the lemon juice. I was concerned about the veggies not being cooked but it was perfect. I also like that quinoa only takes 10-15 minutes as opposed to 50 for brown rice. Will definitely make this again!

Best quinoa dish ever!  This is our go-to quinoa dish as it can be stored in the fridge as a healthy protein-rich snack for my daughter. I often double the recipe because we can dust a single batch in one sitting. Try adding raisins for a nice sweet element. And I tend to use more lemon for a more zingy flavor. Yum!!!!!

This has been my go-to quinoa recipe for a while now.
However, I skip on the celery and instead I like to broil asparagus or artichoke hearts in olive oil, salt and pepper, and fresh grated reggiano. I chop it up and throw it in there instead. Sometimes I throw in chick peas and red beans for some protein. Delicious!

This was delicious!  After reading the reviews, here are my adjustments:  I used more lemon because I really like it, and I also used the zest from the lemon.  I used 1 c water and 1 c stock for more flavor.  I sauteed the onion and celery in a little olive oil, and added the spices to this, to give them a chance to become fragrant and release their flavors.  Since it was my first time making quinoa, I rinsed it as I've heard to do.  I'm not sure what difference it makes, but I do know people that use quinoa a lot swear by rinsing it before use.  Delicious!

Quick.  Easy.  Great flavor.  I did add a little less lemon and added a little chicken broth.

I've been looking for more quinoa recipes and this one is definitely a keeper. I absolutely loved it and could nibble on it all day long. Due to lack of ingredients, I left out the onions and used cilantro instead of parsley.

Holy parsley!!! I only used a bit of the "bunch" of parsley and it overpowered the dish. I think all of the "stuff" overpowered the quinoa in this a bit, which would be nice if you don't like quinoa anyway. I followed the recipe in that I didn't cook the onions and celery. Perhaps that is why they were a little overpowering. Might try sauteing a bit before adding next time or just adding a bit less. I'll definitely add a lot less parsley next time! Also, I forgot to get the pine nuts so I ended up using sliced almonds. Very good with these as well!

I didn't have any pine nuts, but other than that I followed the recipe. 

I really didn't care for this. It was bland. All that really came through was the lemon juice.

We reheated leftovers with some shredded cheddar cheese on top and that helped a lot, but I won't be making this again.

Sorry, but I can't imagine this being acceptable to most kids or picky husbands.  In an effort to salvage what was leftover I added a chopped apple, sliced grapes, light mayonnaise, and some chunked chicken breast for a delicious chicken salad.

I would not recommend this to anyone. It tasted way too lemony and too spicy for kids to enjoy. I was surprised to see such good reviews. I will not be making this again.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the recipe should say "Serve 24-hours later." It's soooo much better the next day. Since the celery and onion aren't cooked, it's just too crunchy and raw to serve same-day. I also added a touch of olive oil. Other than that, very good!

I have never had quinoa before and really wanted to try it.  After searching around for a simple recipe, I came across this one.  It turned out utterly delicious!!!  I left out the pine nuts b/c I love them but they don't love me back :-(

The celery gave the quinoa a nice crunch and I loved the lemon flavor mixed with the sea salt.  I will try to make quinoa a few different ways, but I know this will be my go to recipe when I know I will get something good!!!

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used 1/2 chicken stock, 1/2 water, added the cumin & cayenne pepper while the quinoa was cooking. I don't like onions so I also added a few dashes of onion powder while it was cooking. Omitted the fresh parsley as I didn't have any on hand. It could use a bit more flavor, but it was an easy, tasty and healthy dish that I would make again.

A wonderful and healthy recipe!  We will deinitely try it again.  I followed the recipe but just for fun and because I had the ingredients on hand I added diced sweet red pepper, diced black mission figs and chopped fresh basil.  I took the hint from Cook471 and set it up on the plates in 1/2 cup molds topped with a basil leaf (the rosemary would have been prettier but I didn't have any fresh!)  Someone suggested adding diced cucumber.  Great idea especially for summer.  I will do that the next time.  Thanks for a refreshing & healthy side dish!

A delicious and light dish. Pine nuts were too expensive, so I substituted them for cashews. I also threw some pumpkin seeds and red peppers into the dish and omitted the parsley.

Good recipe.  I didn't have red onion and used a small sweet vidalia onion instead.  Made this 2 nights ago for dinner and am having leftover for lunch today.  Was good 2 nights ago warm for dinner, and is even better today,  cold straight from the frig.  The flavors may have even improved.

Good recipe! I followed the notes of several reviewers and cooked the quinoa in half broth, half water, I added the spices to the quinoa while cooking. I also cooked the celery and onions in a little olive oil.

This is excellent and perfect as written!  I didn't think it was too lemony at all.  The flavors all blended together beautifully.  I used 3/4 tsp. sea salt, which I think helped to balance out the lemon.  I'm not a big fan of celery, but I enjoyed it in this dish.  Next time I might add some chopped spinach to make it a complete meal.

I love quinoa but not to much in this recipe. There was to much parsley and I didn't like the veggies raw. If I make this again I will cut back the amount of parsley and saute the veggies a bit before adding.

Loved it! I used vegetable stock instead of water and added the cumin and ground pepper to it before addind the quinoa. I also followed others' recommedations and boiled the water and spices before adding the quinoa. It did take a lot longer than the bag of quinoa said--closer to 20 mins in the pot.

This is a great recipe!  I boiled my quinoa in reduced sodium chicken broth and added some sauteed zucchini and onions because I did not have (or particularly like the idea of ) the cold celery.  i also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder.
yum!

First time making quinoa. I added chopped cucumber, a splash of olive oil, and a can of artichoke hearts, cut very small. Didn't have pinenuts or fresh parsley, used toasted walnut pieces and dried herb. Just realized I missed the cayenne and cumin, but I did add cracked black pepper. Served with high-quality canned salmon and extra lemon. Yum!

I will be making this again!  Easy, tasty and fast.  It looked really pretty using red quinoa.  No pine nuts available here so we just skipped that part, didn't miss them, would have liked them.  Kids and husband both enjoyed!!

I made it with sliced almonds since I didn't have pine nuts and did a few other things a little different (parsley wasn't fresh and I used bottled lemon juice) but it still turned out pretty well!

This was the first time that we cooked Quinoa, the kernels were kingdom of stuck together.  The flavor was great, but think maybe we did something wrong.  We did rinse it very well before starting the recipe.

Great recipe and very versatile.  Yes, I did modify.  Sauteed ¼ cup onion and two chopped cloves of garlic then added 3 chicken bouillon cubes to the water.  Didn't have enough fresh parsley so used about 3 tablespoons of Thai basil, purple basil, and parsley.  This recipe would probably be fabulous with shrimp.  Will add shrimp pieces to the onion/garlic saute next time.

Enjoyed the dish, however, the cumin was a bit much for my taste.  Next time I will either leave out completely or cut the amount in half.

Cooked as is, but it was a bit to lemony for me.  Plus are you supposed to serve warm or cold.  The recipe didn't say.  I served cold and neither my husband or I cared for it.

My kids didn't like this and I thought it was only "ok". The cumin overpowered the dish and we couldn't taste the lemon. Don't know if I'd make this again, I'm sorry.

Really good recipe!  I made a couple of changes.  I cooked the quinoa in stock and quickly sautéed the celery and onion.  Because I love lemon, I added some more lemon juice and lemon zest.  I don't typically have pine nuts on hand, so I used the slivered almonds suggested by another reader.  I turned out fantastic and I've had it as a cold lunch salad all week!

I loved the crunch from the toasted pine nuts, onion, and celery but I found that it was a bit spicy for my room mate who is sensitive to heat.

Going forward I would use only 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper!

Excellent!  I would only suggest more pine nuts.  I have never cooked with pine cuts before and now I love them.  I cooked the quinoa with a little bit of Knorr chicken powder and with the cumin.  I also love cumin a lot so I added some after anyway.  I usually add more lemon to recipes than required, but this one doesn't need it.

This is the first time I have ever had Quinoa.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious but it did have a bit of a bite - for me I would cut the cayenne in half.  I saved the leftovers and it is great as a cold salad too.

I love this recipe and make it all the time, just as it is written. If you don't have the pine nuts, or have a nut allergy, it comes out just great without them (but better with them!)

I thought this dish was delicious and quite healthy, But it didn't quite pass the kid and husband test.  I made exactly as the recipe said, but I think next time I will use almonds instead of pine nuts, that was the only part I wasn't too thrilled about.  May also add some extra veggies simply because we love veggies in this house.  But otherwise very good dish!

I made this to bring to work for the week.  It is delicious!  
I did as a few reviewers suggested and used some stock in addition to water. I used Better Than Bouillon reduced sodium veggie stock-1 tsp for 2 cups of water.  It was a good amount. Also, I added a squeeze of lemon juice to liquid. 
I added a bunch of sauteed veggies to the recipe, too: summer squash, green bell pepper, onion and mushrooms.  Next time I will add more.  
I served it with some baked cod-I used lemon juice, paprika, dill and pepper on the fish. 

Makes a great meal.

Good but not amazing. I also used half water half chicken stock. I only used half a bunch of parsley because a full one would have been too much for my taste. I used 3 Tbsp. lemon and thought it was still too much, had too much of a sour taste. I left my celery and onion kind of chunky because I like it like that. If I made it again, I would only use half the lemon and maybe more cumin.

Really very good! I followed reviewer advice: added the cayenne and cumin to the water/quinoa mix. Used one cup water and one cup with chicken consomme flavor; sauteed the onion and celery and actually used almond silvers just because I had pine nuts in two other dishes I was serving. The cooking instructions for the quinoa is a bit weird though: on my package of quinoa, it instructs you rinse it, bring the water to a boil and then add the quinoa; bring it back to a boil and then cover, reduce heat and simmer 12 minutes. I'll do that next time.

Wow- this is GOOD!  As someone else recommended- I added the spices directly to the cooking water, as well as some dried onion and a dash of garlic powder.  I do not like red onions, and didn't have celery but they are definitely not necessary- this is delicious even without them!  The spices still come out very faintly, but the tang of the lemon juice is a perfect compliment.  My fiance raved!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is delicious!!  I have made it several times and most people have asked for the recipe to cook it at home.  The recipe has spread like wildfire!  I change it a little bit.  I don't add celery due to an allergy, but I add olive oil.  I never prepare quinoa dishes without olive oil.  Delicious!

This was our first quinoa recipe.  We liked it very much.  Next time I'll back off a bit on the lemon juice.  We sauteed the veggies as we don't care for raw onion. Will make again for sure. Might add garlic next time.

This was excellent!  I had some left over pumpkin seeds so I toasted those and used them instead of pine nuts.  The quinoa was a little dry... probably should've used more liquid while cooking but instead I just added some olive oil over the top of the finished salad.  Next time I'll probably use green onions instead of  red, just because my family likes a milder onion flavor.  I would also like to try this using basil or maybe cilantro... though the cilantro might be too much with the lemon.  We'll see.

This is the first time I have eaten quinoa and it was a wonderful experience! I did make a few adjustments. I do not like pine nuts or celery so I omitted those ingredients. I was out of parsley so I used fresh spinach. I don't really care for the taste of cumin so I used just a pinch of it. It tasted amazing! Next time I am going to try it with parsley and I am sure it will be just as good if not better.

Pretty good but I think the texture would be improved by making the quinoa in advance and letting it sit for a bit to throughly absorb the liquids.  I did use stock and added the spices to the cooking liquid to flavor the grain.

I added some green onion and cilantro, and I think that added to the flavor, but it was a little too lemony. I would recommend half the suggested lemon juice, and to replace some of the water with the lemon juice. Otherwise, it was very good!

This recipe goes great with any fish dish.  I have successfully substituted walnuts or pecans for the overly expensive pine nuts.  Since my beau doesn't like parsley, I substitute cilantro.  Delish!  I also add some quartered grape tomatoes.  This is a go to dish for pot lucks.  Everyone always enjoys it.  It is good hot or cold.

Thought this was delicious!
 I didn't have chicken broth on hand so I added the raw onion and celery to the water as I boiled the quinoa. Turned out delicious. I followed everything else exactly, except no salt. I do not add salt to anything usually and it did not need it.
Will definitely make again.

I LOVE to make this recipe! It's healthy, refreshing, and a great side dish to baked chicken. I'll leave out the pine nuts and red onion if I don't have them. I also add in blanched asparagus when it's in season!

I WILL make this again! Loved the lemony flavour and then the zippy cayenne after bite!!
Instead of pine nuts used pumpkin seeds, was tasty and added a little extra green colour.

It was definitely very lemony but it paired really well with salmon that I marinated in dijon mustard, lemon, paprika, etc.  I served it with broccoli and skipped the celery and onion since I wasn't sure about those with salmon.  

Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe would be better without the red onion. The onion overpowered the entire dish until that was all you could taste. I will make this again but omit the red onion.

A very tasty and fresh tasting side dish.  I made as directed with the addition of an apple, lemon zest and dried cranberries, soaked in the lemon juice and zest.  I also mixed white and red quinoa.   I did not have pine nuts, so I used walnuts.  This was delicious and I will use again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

this was a nice base recipe.. i didn't have any pine nuts so i left them out.. used half water/half chicken broth (bouillon) as others suggested but could have gone all broth.. i used bottled lemon.. one green onion and some onion powder to make up for the quarter red onion.. used only a half bunch of parsley (worried it would overpower everything).. i added the cumin and cayenne to the quinoa as it cooked like Azurel did.. i think the quinoa could have cooked a little longer as mine was not as dry as i'd like it to be.. i sprinkled in some lemon pepper, red wine vinegar, and beer salt (it's got citric acid in it and i was looking for sour).. i realized at the end that it was missing garlic! bf said it could have used a bit of montreal steak seasoning.. i think he was also looking for the garlic.. he also said this would be great with some shrimp or chicken stirred in.. either way.. this is what i was hoping for.. something reminiscent of tabbouleh.. ~~UPDATE: having leftovers this morning.. i added some more chopped fresh parsley and some lime juice.. it was exactly what i was looking for yesterday! this is a great dish and i look forward to making this again.. ty for the recipe

I ended up serving this cold on a salad, topped with shrimp cooked with lemon, cayenne and garlic on top. I served it with Italian vinaigrette salad dressing. 

I added some sauteed mushrooms, used sunflower seeds, and dry parsley because that's what I had on hand. I served it to someone that has never tried quinoa before and they said it was delicious! It's now a permanent recipe in my file.

Good recipe, but quinoa can have a bitter taste if you don't rinse it first under cold water before cooking. You will notice the difference. Also one of the best ways to cook it is in a rice cooker.
I have a cheapo one (because my expensive one is useless) use 1 cup Quinoa to 2 cups liquid. Perfect every time.

I thought it was very good. Next time I won't put all the lemon though. I didn't have any pine nuts so I used walnuts. I also sub tajin bc I didn't have the cayenne.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't use celery stalks, instead I used celery salt to taste, about 1-2 tsp.  Also, I used Knorr chicken stock powder to make the stock for the quinoa, turned out great. I also added the lemon to taste.  I added a bit to the water/stock and than added some more while mixing.  To make this highly nutritious I added edamame, peas, avocado and spinach, all to preference.  It's a great dish!

This is one of those recipes where you can just make over and over again.  It's easy, quick, and great.

I love this recipe, already made it a 2nd time. I couldn't find pine nuts, so I subbed with roasted sunflower seeds, and added a garlic clove on 2nd batch. I also sauted the celery & onion breifly. This is yummy warm or cold. I served the rest of the batch I made yesterday cold on a bed of baby spinach leaves for a side dish to go with dinner. Will be making often.

I followed recipe exactly (OH except that I used chicken broth instead of water) and I love lemon but this was too lemony for me.  I like the suggestion of maybe sautéing the onion first as well and I suppose cutting back on the lemon.  The pine nuts were a great addition.  Would consider using recipe again but we a few tweaks.

Fantastic recipe - both delicious and healthy. I found that adding two tablespoons of chopped up craisins (dried cranberries) gave the perfect balance to the lemon juice. Of course the celery can be swapped for diced zucchini or asparagus too. I serve this with a feta laden tossed salad and sauted crispy skinned salmon for 'vegetarian heaven'.

I tried this and ended up serving it with craisins mixed in, and over spinach salad with some diced carrots. The lemon helped...as I'm not very fond of quinoa's taste overall. I do think it needed a bit of sweetness...hence the dried cranberries.

LOVE IT! I have modified it somewhat. I do not use the pine nuts since they can be pricey and some folks have allergies to nuts.I use broccoli instead and also add garbanzo beans. This is great to take for a pot luck because you can prepare it a day or so before and it's better chilled. There's never any left over!

Such a great recipe, and keeps well in the fridge - great for lunches!  I usually add more lemon juice than the recipe calls for, and have used chicken stock instead of water for the quinoa, but I couldn't say it made much of a difference.

I used this as a main dish with chicken on top.  I cooked the rice in a rice cooker with the spices.  It was really wonderful!

This was a bit too lemony for my liking, but I'm sure I would have liked it if I would have used less lemon.

Great grain easy to work with! this was my first time trying quinoa. my husband didnt like the lemony taste much so the 2nd time i just added some leftover pasta sauce i had in the fridge. i also sauted the onion and celery in some butter to make it a little softer, and then stirred in the quinoa, pine nuts and tomoato sauce.

This side dish was great with Grilled Lemon Herb Pork Chops and Fasoliyyeh Bi Z-Zayt (Syrian Green Beans with Olive Oil(both from this site). I could not find Quinoa so I used couscous and it was still great. I also couldn't get any pine nuts so I used toasted slivered almonds. MMMMMMMMM!

This was really good. Instead of parsley I used cilantro because I like it better than parsley. Everything else I kept the same. It was very delicious.

Really good!!!  Didn't have pine nuts on hand so omitted.  I was wanting to make a take off on the New Orleans classic...Shrimp Creole and Grits but wanted to use quinoa in place of the grits.  I used the shells from the shrimp to make two cups of shrimp stock in which I cooked the quinoa along with the lemon juice, celery, and spices.  It really was the perfect partner for the Shrimp Creole but could have stood by itself.

This was ok, there is a better recipe for a similar type of dish that I've made before - which is DELICIOUS. This was fine though.
