I used Trader Joe's roasted red peppers in a  jar and followed the recipe instructions to the letter.  When first blended, this was just pure liquid.  I added a little more mayonnaise (which I really didn't want to do because I was adding fat), and it thickened a little.  At least in my mind, the problem is the name of this recipe because it's too runny to use as a spread or even a dip.  It should be "Roasted Red Pepper Sauce" not "...Spread."  On the other hand, what I ended up with is a nicely-flavored sauce.  If I were to make this again using roasted peppers in a jar, I'd blot the peppers with paper towels or use a salad spinner to remove as much water as possible.  If you roast your own peppers, you may not have this problem.  In spite of the consistency issue, it does taste yummy.

So after reading the one review here I added about 4-5 oz of cream cheese for thickness, and since I was out of garlic gloves I used granulated. But the reviews I got for the dip were raving. I used a mix of red and orange mini bell peppers and over roasted them, then blended it all together. Definitely will make again, most likely with a few tweaks here and there since I am incapable of following a recipe exactly.

It was very liquid so I added a half a block of cream cheese and it is wonderful! Served it on wheat crackers and with carrot slices. Loved it!
