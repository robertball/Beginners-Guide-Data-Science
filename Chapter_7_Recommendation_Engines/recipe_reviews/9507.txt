Very good! The only thing I would suggest is if there's a version that uses real eggs and real sugar - I tried to sweeten to taste using brown sugar instead of artificial sweetener (blech!) and the cake came out somewhat flat, but very rich. (3/4 c. brown sugar, if anyone else wants to try.) Worth experimenting with.

It wasn't clear in the directions if the water that the raisins and pumpkin was boiled in was poured off or added to the mix.  I thought all that water would be too much liquid to add to the cake mix so I poured it off and it turned out very dry and lumpy.

It was pretty yummy!  I added a brown sugar crust mixed with walnuts on top so that made it even better.  Real egg nothing artificial
