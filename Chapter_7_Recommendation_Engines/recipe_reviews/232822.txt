This is easy and quick! I made it as written and thought the cake mixture needed more moisture. Second time, I added a splash of milk. To the mixture that goes on top, I mixed in some marshmallows and pecans! Yumm!

It was really good - my guests enjoyed it very much.  Next time I will add a bit more moisture to the cake, though...  a little dry.

I made these for our Girls Night Out in June. Very easy to make and they set up nicely. The girls loved them and I came home with an empty pan. I think that is a great compliment to this recipe. I would make these again.

This recipe was very good.  I made a diagonal lattice top with the remaining half of dough.  Next time I will try this recipe with chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips.

This recipe is a crowd pleaser!  It is easy and quick to make, and everyone proves that the name is true.  Every time I make these, people cant leave them alone!  They are usually the first to disappear at any potluck I take them to! Cake, creamy chocolate, and finger food size.  Absolutely perfect.

Took to a church potluck function and EVERYONE asked for the recipe. Especially good the second day. If you want a really special treat put some in the freezer and eat them frozen. Yummy!

Note: These are kind of soft. I might cook the filling a little longer next time to see if they would set up better.

Probably one of the best, easiest desserts I've ever had--"Can't Leave Alone" is an understatement!  I could easily have eaten the whole pan.  Absolutely delicious!!

I made a chocolate version (choc cake mix). I also wanted it lower calorie, so I substituted pumpkin for the oil, and used fat free sweetened condensed milk. It reminded me of lava cake! So yummy! Thanks for sharing a great easy recipe!

Delicious!! A family favorite!  Made it as directed, but for the 2nd half of the cake mixture to the top, I added a little milk. Makes the tops a little more fluffy. Don't add milk to the bottom portion, then the chocolate middle blends into the bottom and just wasn't the same.

Made as directed, but the cake mix I had was yellow.  Didn't figure it would make a difference.   Mixture seemed to sticky to flatten between hands, so I basically spooned it atop the chocolate layer.  I did cook it longer, but not sure how long, sorry.  Turned out just like the picture and was delish!!!

I've been making these for years - and it's the first recipe my son ever made (as a 8 year-old). They are very addicting and everyone who eats them can't leave them alone!

THis is fantastic!!!  I made it exactly as directed, but added a splash more oil to the batter as I saw previous reviews had noted that batter was a little dry.  Next time I may use milk, but overall, this turned out delicious!!!

These were pretty good.  My guests and husband liked them more than I did.  I added a little extra milk when mixing the top layer which kept them from drying out but then it made it hard to work with and spread on top.

Quick and easy do not always make for a great outcome. These are VERY sweet and I  added a bit of unsweetened cocoa to the melted chocolate.  The sweet of the cake mix, the sweet of the condensed milk and the milk chocolate leaves this a bit cloying.

they truly deserve their name. plus, they are extra easy and extra quick: you cannot go wrong, and it takes a ridiculous amount of time. Now with the drawbacks (there are some, of course, as usual): they are quite rich. And quite sweet. For me, definitely a keeper!

This is one my family's favorite recipes, so I was delighted to find it on here. I added a small splash of milk to the batter. It seemed to be too greasy, but it came out perfect after about 25 minutes in the oven.

Delicious and very quick and easy.  I had to bake in my pre-heated oven for about 28 minutes, so give yourself a little additional time.  I covered the entire top with the dough so it was uniform instead of patchy and it turned out well.  Next time I might try incorporating a layer of marshmallows.

I had such high hopes for this.  However,it became one big gooey mess.  We ended up eating just the top layer.  I will try it again though, in case it was an error on my part.

I've done this twice; once following the recipe and once with changes to it.

Doing the recipe as stated was quite a disaster. The pan size was too big for the amount of ingredients, so it varied in thickness with some places just barely covered, and the chocolate filling was severely lacking; the stated time also meant for an undercooked slice. Overall it was one big gooey mess - Sure, it tasted okay, but it was a lot of work for a gooey confection.

The second time I more than doubled the amount of chocolate in the filling (app. 2 1/2 - 3c chocolate), used a 10x10" pan, and added app. 1 - 2tbs of milk to the cake mix. This was baked for 40 - 45 minutes at the same temp (covered in foil to prevent the top over-browning). The filling was more solid and flavorful and the base was a level thickness. Despite this, it still wasn't anything amazing to rave about. Even with all the changes, I wouldn't really try it again. It's just not worth the money or hassle.
