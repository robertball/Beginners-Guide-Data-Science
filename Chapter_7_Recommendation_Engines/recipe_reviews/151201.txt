We liked this recipe!  I added fresh spinach to the top of the first layer.  It cooks down and doesn't even taste like spinach.  It's a way to put veggies in without the spinach taste.

You know, I think I was expecting more.  Some of my family didn't think it was spicy enough...I made it just exactly like the recipe.  I think I would spice it up a little next time, maybe some spinach, maybe some potatoes, a little hot sauce...

Served this for Thanksgiving breakfast to a house full.  Everyone enjoyed it and it was substantial enough to keep everyone going till dinner that afternoon.

The bread got soggy which was unappealing. I couldn't even eat it after one bite. I think next time I'll omit bread and it'll be good.

We make this every year for Chrismas morning because you can make it ahead of time, refridgerate, and pop it in the oven in the morning while the kids open gifts.  We add bacon and diced ham and tomatoes too!
