This turned out so fabulous. I have a large Instant Pot so I doubled the recipe. I did not add the Habenero Pepper (small children ) I followed the directions & pressure cooked 30 mins. It was fall apart awesome. The gravy/sauce was loved by all! I served it with mashed potatoes, green salad & garlic bread. This will be served many more times at our table.

Good flavor, but not fall-apart, tender like another review stated.  Maybe I didn't have in long enough.   Followed the recipe except for the peppers.
