This is my most favorite margarita. I think they call this the Cadillac Margarita at Mazatlan. If I'm making this at home, I'll up the Grand Marnier 
and tequila for a stronger drink. VERY good.

To make this better...add the juice from 1 fresh lime and 1/4 of an orange. Also...its better with a tequila that is 100% aguave, which is one of the upper level Cuervos,

The very best of Margaritas is this one.  You don't necessarily require a margarita mix.  We mix it in the bars with a lemon/lime ration of  2:1
