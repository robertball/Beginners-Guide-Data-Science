OK, fellow "tweaksters": here is my version of this recipe. Heated oil and mustard seed (mine was really old, so not much flavor); added cauliflower and potato as directed but also added a medium onion cut up in chunks, about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, and about 1/2 Tablespoon (approx) of steakhouse seasoning (the grinder kind with chunks of garlic, dried onion, salt, peppercorns, etc) and a few shakes of CURRY powder (because I didn't have any turmeric). I also added a container of fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms. I think the extra onion and mushrooms helped balance out the oil. There was savory, tangy and a hint of sweet without adding any sugar. My husband and I thought it was very flavorful. I served it with a lemon/pepper marinated turkey tenderloin and it was very good! Quick, tasty sidedish!

Thought this sounded good as a side to go with some Tikka masala. Unfortunately,  I didn't have quite all the ingredients, but I made the dish anyway. I am writing this review because reading how others have made recipes work for them is my favorite part about allrecipes. I did not have any potatoes so I carmelized about a 1/2 onion in the oil before adding the mustard seed. I then followed the actual recipe. Please note that I used kosher salt not table salt. The end result was okay, just a little too sweet and oily, but this is likely because of the caramelized onion and lack of potato. I added same garam masala for some more spice and crushed crackers to soak up the excess oil. The end results were good. I will be making this again,  hopefully with the potato, but I think I will keep the onion, garam masala, reduce the sugar and add the scallion mentioned in the first review. Thank you for posting this recipe

This was okay.  It really had no flavor except the fried potatoes and cauliflower.  Even though I cut down on the salt, it was salty.  I added some chopped scallions after my initial try and it was much tastier.  Maybe some onions in the pan would be helpful.  Doubt if I will make it again.

I made change white sugar to coconut sugar. Kept pieces on biggish side so it would hold up to the stirring . I'll. Make it again and play with different spices. Yum Yum!!

Excellent side dish. The cayenne pepper added just the right kick. Definitely will make again!

Oh, my! So delicious. I used a partial head of yellow cauliflower and added some purple pepper (my Saturday public market finds!), but followed the rest of the ingredients as is. Yummy! Thanks, I'll be making it again soon.

I didn't have turmeric, so I substituted curry. I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes, but I thought the flavor was nice and it complimented the main dish of Indian Butter Chicken.

I wasn't a fan of this dish, but my 10yo liked it and he normally doesn't care for cauliflower. The potato made the difference for him. I was surprised it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. So I doubled the mustard seed and was a little heavy with the turmeric too. I even added chopped onion. I ended up adding an equal amount of cumin as well. 2 stars as is, but even with my tweaks, I'd only give this dish a low 3. Sorry, but I won't make this one again.
