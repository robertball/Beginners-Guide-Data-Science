I thought it was pretty bland, so the next time, i doubled the basil, chopped up 2 garlic cloves and added it to the tomato mixture, then finished it off with some shredded mozzarella on top. It got a much better reception from my husband the second time.

I added balsamic vin, minced garlic, salt, and used dried basil. I also added some fresh sliced mozzarella underneath. This base recipe is fine, but if you can add any of the above ingredients, you'll be happy!

Great recipe! I find that adding a few drops of balsamic vinegar to the bread right before serving really enhances the flavor!

There is not much too this recipe, and I thought it was very bland.  I didn't care for it at all. My husband seemed to think it was okay.  I do not recommend this recipe.  Sorry.

I am looking for a good Bruschetta recipie. Tried this and it was just tomatos on bread. Expirimented a little bit and it was lovely. Add more basil, add balsamic vinegar. Rub bread with garlic and then toast. Drizzle with olive oil and melt a little mozerella over it!  This was far too bland!!!

I highly enjoyed this recipe. I read the reviews before I made it. I added one more clove of garlic, and mozzarella cheese. I also decided to add 1tbsp of parsley to add flavor. Turned out great.

So simple and absolutely delicious! With a recipe this simple, you need the freshest, ripe tomatoes and fresh basil. I added minced garlic.

Something very important is missing in this recipe... GARLIC! It's okay like this, but if you add a couple cloves of garlic, chopped, it has much more flavour. Fresh basil is also essential!

Not the best, not the worst. I added dried basil and garlic powder, and topped it with and pecorino romano.
