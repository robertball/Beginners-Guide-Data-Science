For years I bake my breads and rolls every day fresh. Here and there I try some new recipes, so I made this one. While I thought this bread will be our lunch bread for the next day when I baked in in the evening, it was eaten by my family within 1 hour just with olive dipping oil and salt. I should have made 2 loaves :)  The flavor and consistency was just perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was a very easy recipe, however the flavor really didn't work for us.  This is the first time I baked bread and the house didn't have that delicious baked bread aroma.
