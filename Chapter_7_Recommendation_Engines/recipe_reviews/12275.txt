The filling is yummy - the only thing I did was to mix the sugar mixture together with the pears as others have suggested. But since I am not a baker and the thought of making the top crust look nice was terrifying, I made a crumble topping: 1/2 cup each butter and brown sugar mixed together with 1 cup flour. Pour the crumbles over the pears and bake at 350 for about an hour. I took it to a party tonight and everyone raved, even hubby who claims to not like pears. Thanks!!

I followed the recipe as written.  

Our neighbors gave us pears from their tree and I found this recipe to make.  I took the pie over to their house and you should have seen the looks on their face.  Pear pie?  I think I will pass.  They tried and said "it doesn't taste like pears, it tastes like apple pie.  This is really good."

I will definitely be making more this weekend as they gave me more pears.  I will freeze and take several to work for a treat.  I'm sure everyone will love it.

Thank you.  This is really delicious!!!

My family has been making pear pies for generations so I consider myself somewhat of an expert on the subject. The reason your pear pies are tasting like apple pies is the CINNAMON!!! Do what our family does and use NUTMEG! Other reviewers are correct: make sure your pears are ripe almost to the point of being soft. Also, don't be afraid of using salt in your dessert recipes!  This recipe says use 1/4 teaspoon salt. That's not enough to even bother with! I would at least double that, and the reason is: SALT MAKES SUGAR TASTE EVEN SWEETER! We also traditionally sprinkle some white sugar over the top crust before baking. This always helps us differentiate it from an apple pie at a family meal.

I have made this pie at least 10 times now, since we are hooked on it.  Originally came upon recipe because we have a pear tree that gave us an over abundance, more than we could give away or store.  The first time I made the recipe I followed exactly as written, until I came to the lemon zest and realized I didn't have a whole lemon.  I did have fresh ginger and grated some of that in.  My pie was wonderful!  Since then I've made a few variations of this original recipe and my winning one is, I use the lemon zest AND fresh grated ginger - at least a good heaping tablespoon.  And I have changed the 3 tablespoons of flour to 4 tablespoons of corn starch, and changed the 1/2 cup of white sugar to 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar!.  Wonderful - the ginger gives it a taste that is not over powering where anyone can put their finger on what it is - but it makes it most unique.  The corn starch allows the cutting of the pie to come out picture perfect

This pie was a great hit with my family.  I did add a half cup of cranraisins and sliced one green apple into the pie.  Also I used Spendor which is a sugar substitute that you use the same amount that the recipe calls for.

This pie was wonderful!  I forgot to dot with butter, but it was fabulous anyway.  A simple recipe with a great fruity taste.  I made a deep dish pie with about 8-9 cups of pears and a little extra lemon zest and it was just right.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This pie recipe was a hit!  It tasted like an apple pie, but it was not as tart.  The recipe was easy to follow.  The only thing I would do differently is mix the sugar mixture with the pears, since I followed the directions and sprinkled the sugar between the pear layers, it really did not blend with the juices from the pear.  All in all, I will definitely make this pie again.  It was very yummy!

I was trying to figure out what in the world to do with all of the pears that came off of my grandmother's tree this year when I found this recipe, and boy am I glad that we found it.  It really is quite tasty! As per other reviews, I mixed the dry ingredients with my pears before dumping them in the crust, and I used a crumb topping on the top instead of the second crust.  If you're interested, my crumb topping it is 1/4 c. butter melted, 1/2 c. light brown sugar, and 3/4 c. flour.  Oh, if you use a crumb topping there's no need to mix any butter in with the pears.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe...I used my own family pie crust and it was great.  The cinnamon is not overpowering.  It took about 5 d'Anjou pears, sliced thinly.  This tastes A LOT like Apple Pie, only a bit different, but use it when pears are in season.  Nice and sweet - and it thickens perfectly.  Going in my recipe book.

So I made this the way it was written and while it was yummy, it kinda reminded me too much of a basic apple pie. So four stars for that. The second time I made it, I made some adjustments that made it phenomenal! I used dark brown sugar instead of white, and oranges instead of lemon zest and juice. I added some ginger paste, cloves, and crushed cardamom to the cinnamon.  The difference was like night and day! Also be sure to use ripe pears. I usually eat my pears when they are crisp like apples, that doesn't work with this, they need to be soft. I also liked mixing up the kinds of pears. We used green and red for a festive pie!

I have made this several times and it's always delicious.  I sprinkle blueberries or huckleberries on top of the pears before adding the top crust and it makes it extra special.  (frozen berries are fine--just rinse them and drain or pat dry).  We were blessed with a bumper crop of hard native canning pears, and they have to be peeled, sliced, and boiled before making the pie or they are too hard.  I prepared and froze several bags in just the right amount to make pies and find that even people who say they don't care for pears love this pie.

I was worried about that high temp, but it worked beautifully! This pie is amazing! I've made 3 pies so far; using different types of pears with different ripeness, from rock hard to very soft. They all turned out great, but the ripe pears are definitely the best. If you bake the pie a bit longer, maybe 5-10 minutes for the hard pears with foil over the top, it turns out really nice.

I love pear pie; but my family especially enjoys it made with brown or raw sugar, and the addition of either raisins or dates, along with chopped nuts.  I also find that sprinkling a little powder from a packet of lemon Jell-o adds the lemon flavor but also absorbs extra liquid, so I can use less flour, and gives it a very pleasing texture.  This also allows me to use pears that are overripe and more watery, since the dried fruits and Jello-o hep absorb the liquid.

Love it! Like apple pie only better because I don't like the way apples in apple pie are sometimes hard/crunchy.  Very simple too if you only have an hour and 20 minutes to make a pie.  Because of time constraints I used refrigerated pie crusts and 5 D'Anjou Pears.  Prep time was 20 minutes.  I skipped the lemon rind.  Then on the top crust I brushed on melted butter and put some sugar on top.  I baked it at 450 for 10 and then 350 for 40 and it was perfect!

I've been making this now for two or three years. It has become my signature pie. My mom absolutely DEMANDS one all to her self for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The only thing I do differently than the original recipe is mixing everything together before putting into the crust (as opposed to sprinkling it on top) and increasing the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp (because I love cinnamon) and adding a half tsp of nutmeg.

I made this last night, and it was just delicious! I canned over 125 pounds of pears this fall, so I tried using the homecanned ones in this recipe. Since I don't use hardly any sweetner in my canning, they worked great. Baked it about the amount of time listed, and the filling was perfect and the crust not soggy. Will be making many more of these this winter!

Delicious pie! I didn't add the lemon zest, lemon juice, or butter and it turned out great anyway. It tasted a lot like apple pie and I expect it would have been tart like apple pie had I added the lemon. I suggest placing a pan or foil underneath to collect drips.

Really good recipe to get rid of excess pears. I made it almost as written, except that I used half brown and half white sugar. I also forgot to add the lemon juice and dot with butter. Also, cuz I did not want to go through peeling the pears, I just sliced them peels on. Bad idea! The peels stay a little tough, I recommend to take the time and peel them! i made my own pie crust. Came out really delish, and my son, surprisingly, wanted to eat only the filling cuz he loved it so much! thanks for this recipe.

Great recipe! Very easy and quick! I made the crust fancy by using small fall leaf, acorn, and pumpkin cutters to border the edge of the pie. See my picture (#14). Love it! Thank you!

Love this as a base recipe, I swapped the white sugar for light brown, added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and just mixed everything together except the butter that I diced up and scattered on top of the filling before covering. It was yum yum! I used Pillsbury Refrigerated Pie Crusts and just brushed the top with butter then cinnamon/sugar worked well.

This has to be the pie of the year! I was asked to bake this 4 times over the holiday and everyone just couldn't get enough. 

I am an organic consumer so I opted to use only organic ingredients all the way down to the whipped cream. Which, by the way, whipped cream has to be the best thing added to this pie. It added the perfect amount of subtle sweetness.

Other than the whipped cream, the only thing I did different was add an egg white and teaspoon of sugar mixture to glaze the top of the pie for a golden crust. I did this before I put it in the oven.

This is a great recipe, and it held together nicely once it cooled. However I did change two things: I left out the butter and the lemon, and added nutmeg, quite a bit of ground cardamom, ground cloves, a tiny bit of ginger and a minuscule dash of cinnamon. It turned out wonderfully, and the whole house smells like spices!

I love this pie. A few notes. I love to bake desserts. I am picky about desserts. I found this pie, and it sounded nice. But I don't have much money to spend, being a College student. This recipe does not require many unique ingredients other than pear, and the ingredients I had to buy didn't cost much. I told my mother I was baking pear pie and she freaked. She thought I was crazy, she thought it would taste bad. But I decided to bake it anyways. EVERYONE LOVED IT! It was a huge success. I tried it with the suggested 'crumb topping' which was faaabulous! Can't forget the vanilla ice cream to go with it! My brother, his girlfriend, my mom and her friend, and my fiancee and me all loved it. There were no complaints! I am asked to bake this all the time, and I love to bake it all the time! Simple, cheap, wonderful, and delicious! A++++++!

This is a great recipe! Note you should preheat your oven, not stated in directions. This is very apple pie like, with a slight pear taste. The sauce is cinnamony syrupy but not too sweet. The recipe is simple & straight forward. Those lucky enough to taste this delish pie will think you are a serious baker & think you have slaved away over this pie, when it is really easy. You can't mess it up! I made my own pie crust as follows: 2 cups All-Purpose Flour 1 tsp. salt 2/3 cup shortening 5-6 tablespoons ice cold water  Whisk or sift together flour and salt until well mixed. Rub shortening into flour with fingertips or cut in using two knives or a pastry blender until mixture has lumps the size of small peas.  Fill a small glass with ice and water. Using a tablespoon measure, spoon out 1 tablespoon of ice water at a time, stirring quickly into the flour mixture, using only enough water (5 or 6 tablespoons) for the pastry to come together (mixture will be crumbly).  Divide into two portions, with the larger half being for the bottom of the pie crust. Shape each portion into a 1/2" thick disk shape. Smooth the edges. Wrap in plastic wrap and rest for 20 minutes.  Roll out on a lightly floured work surface to a size 1 1/2 inches larger than the pie pan. Fit into pan loosely.  Bake according to directions given in the pie recipe being used.

Wow followed recipe exactly, using fresh lemons. I used one box crust mix to make one large crust. Dumped all the ingredients in the center and folded up edges. Crimped, painted with milk, spinkled with large sugar crystals and cinnamon. My dad was here when it came out of the oven and wow did he love this. Even ate seconds!! Really good.

I've been using this recipe for years and it is always a hit. For a more complex flavor, use a few different types of pears!

I don't like pie, but I love to make them.  However, my family was raving so much about this I had to try a bite.  WE LOVE IT!!  I made a homemade crust for the bottom and used a cinnamon biscut drop batter for the top.  (crust is why I hate pie).  The spices are perfect..we didn't even need ice cream.  Thank you so much for sharing!  This one is a keeper!

This pie is fabulous and it's my first time baking! I halved the amount of sugar used because my dad has to watch his sugar intake, but the pie still turned out great (and even when I substituted the white sugar for brown). I found it helpful to make sure the pears were sliced thinly. We ate half of the pie fresh from the oven and I will definitely make this again. This one's a keeper.

This is a terrific recipe. I didn't modify anything and it was gone in one evening. My only advice is to increase the flour if your pears are really ripe, as mine were. My filling was still really wet and it caused some of the bottom crust to be a little underbaked.

Really nice; don't hesitate. I mixed the pears with the sugar, following regeland's recommendation and adding about a tablespoon or so of fresh grated ginger to the mix; it was subtle, but added a zip. It didn't really taste like apple pie, but like something a little different. And I was worried the pears would turn to mush, but they held up, sliced about 1/4" thick.

I loved this and have made half dozen cause the feedback has been so positive. Changes: Instead of a top crust I used a brown sugar/pecan topping from an apple pie recipe on this site. 2) I used only 1/4 c of sugar for 2 pies plus the zest and juice of one lemon -- our fresh pears were so sweet i didn't need much sugar. The pie was light and refreshing and just sweet and tart enough to be a hit with kids and adults of all ages.

My husband has said for a while that he loved Pear pie and so I wanted to surprise him and made this recipe. I followed the recipe and when it came out of the oven it looked amazing, however when we cut it to serve it there was so much liquid that the bottom crust was soggy. He said the flavor was good however there has to be a way to cut down on the moisture, would love any suggestions.

I used this for mother's day as something light and different.  It was excellent!  Similar to apple pie but without the sweet syrup.  
I tossed the pears with the sugar mixture like another reviewer mentioned.  I also used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust which made this recipe even easier.

I make this pie all the time.  I use brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I made this pie for Christmas and Thanksgiving celebration.  Let people think it's apple.  They'll think it's the best apple pie they've ever had.  Then only after they try it tell them that it is pear.  People seem to prejudged this pie that's why give the above advice.

Probably the best pie I have ever made... I did read previous reviews and tweaked it a little.  I used 1/4 cup each brown sugar and white sugar.  Instead of lemon zest, I subbed 1 tablespoon of grated ginger root, 1 tsp. lemon juice, 3/4 tsp. of nutmeg and only 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  Combine all the ingredients together and mixed thoroughly before putting into the pie shell.  I did not use any more lemon juice to sprinkle over the pie, but dotted with 2 tsp, of butter before baking.
With a glass dish, the pie took much longer to bake; probably 20-25 minutes more.  Next time I will increase temperature to 375.
Honestly the most delicious pie I have made in my 40 years of baking pies.  Thank you for sharing, a true winner!

Good recipe! I was short one cup of fruit, so I put a cup of frozen blueberries as a bottom layer (and to make the pie prettier, without staining all the pears blue). 
We love pear pie. Happy to have found this recipe when I couldn't locate mine and none of my cookbooks had one. This is very similar to the one I have---somewhere.
I have used orange juice and zest when I didn't have lemon.

Excellent - I made two because I had so many pears (from a family members tree) and it was a hit. I've made apple pies and I've learned my lesson - slice the pears very thin. Definitely serve warm! And I followed Lisa L's suggestion to use the crumble topping: 1/2 cup each butter and brown sugar mixed together with 1 cup flour. Thank you!

Delicious! I brushed the top crust with some egg wash to give it a nice shiny finish. Tasted kind of like an apple pie, with a hint of pear. Pairs nicely with vanilla ice cream!

After buying a bag of pears from Sam's that I could not eat fast enough I decided to look online for ideas so my pears would not go to waste and I came across this recipe. I am so glad I did this pie is ridiculously wonderful and everyone is right, you CAN NOT tell that pears were used. We luv apple pie and this is a great substitute when you have too many pears on hand. I think the problem people had with theirs coming out runny is because it all depends on how ripe your pears are. The riper the pears the more "water" they have so you will have to adjust accordingly. As others, I also mixed my dry ingredients into my pears and did not layer. My pie came out great. Thank you for sharing this is definitely a keeper!

Everyone loved this pie! Followed the recipe, but since I'm allergic to cinnamon, I substituted nutmeg and added 1 t. of vanilla. The pears held their form, but seemed to almost melt in the mouth when eating. This recipe is a keeper.

I enjoyed this recipe, but if i had to choose between this or apple, i'd choose apple. I used asian pears - maybe that is where i went wrong? Although I thought  they were perfect because they remained firm while cooking. I would make this again with double the sugar mixture.

This pie deserves more than the 200+ reviews it has. This is fantastic, and I don't even like pears. I need to remember the vanilla ice cream the next time I make this.

This pie was very tasty and the pears held up surprisungly well.  Not nearly as textured as an apple pie but all the flavor of an apple pie but with pears!  Mine came out extra watery so after the first cut, I drained some of the soupy water and it's quite lovely.  The only change I would make would be to toss the sugar/flour mixture with the pears before layering in pie crust as the sugar/flour mixture was not evenly coating the pears.  Delicious pie - I would make again

I used Bartlett pears, a little under ripe; I also used dried lemon peel instead of fresh. Relative to the amount of crust, I would say there wasn't enough filling. However, the filling was very good - it really is a lot like apple pie, and unless you warned people, I don't think they'd figure out it was pear. My crust on top didn't brown though I left it in for 45 minutes (but I don't know if my oven has an accurate temp).

My husband was NOT looking forward to eating this pie...he thought he got robbed out of an apple pie.  Well, we were all pleasantly surprised how much it tasted like my apple pie!  The texture is slightly different, but that may vary by the ripeness and variety of pears.  I did not have a lemon on hand to zest, otherwise I followed the recipe as is.

This pie is delicious.  I used only the bottom shell and it was good.  I added a touch of vanilla and brown sugar on top of the pie also.   It is so good I can hardly believe it!!  I used the pears from our tree and the pears were not hard so that helped too. This pie is truly fit to serve a king!!

This pie is amazing! If I had to pick a pie for a beginning baker, this would be it. It was absolutely delicious and it set perfectly. I made the recipe exactly as listed and I know I will be making this again and again. Bring on the ice cream!

Very similar to apple pie, but my pears didn't cook down like apples do.  It was delicious, and I will make this pie again with produce from our pear tree!

I'm not a cook or a baker, but I made this pie late last night out of boredom and it turned out really good.  I didn't use the zest but only because I didn't have any lemons on hand but other than that, the recipe was followed as is. Pear pie was a first for us.  I think I willl be making it again.  I highly recommend!

Wow!  Perhaps my new favorite pie.  Freshly squeezed lemon juice and lots of lemon zest made this really unique.

This pie was AMAZING! It's now my favorite. I had the red pears that were going bad in the fridge, a premade pillsbury pie crust, and I even forgot to add the lemon juice at the end. This pie was just perfect, it came out looking perfect and tasted even better. GREAT recipe - thank you SO much for sharing. We just added some rediwhip since we're out of all the other stuff, but the pie would be great served on it's own.

very good even though I used a boxed recipe for the crust and used a crumbled white sugar crust for topping - the topping made it.  I also added another pinch or two of cinnamin.  No one could believe it was not apples!

Excellent pie recipe! This was the first fruit pie I have made and it turned out very well for me. I used 5 medium-large pears (doyenne du Comice, a sweet winter pear). I used half brown sugar and half white, added 4 teaspoons of lemon juice, and added a dash of "speculaaspice" (probably only available in holland). I also tossed the flour+sugar mixture with the filling as per the advice of other reviewers. I found the taste neither too spicy nor too lemony - I may use even more lemon next time but that's my personal preference. The only problem I had is that the filling was a bit watery, but next time I make it I won't pour all the liquid from the tossed pears into the pie. Total cooking time was close to 1 h 15 min; I wanted to make sure the pears were thoroughly tender. I'll make this again!

Having been given a huge bag of pears and not knowing what to do with them, I turned to allrecipes.com :)  Had never heard of pear pie, but went with the most 5 stars rating.  I was in a hurry and forgot to read the recipe again and ended up throwing all the ingredients into a big bowl, minus the lemon zest, with the pear slices as I do with apple pie.  It tasted very similar to apple pie so it naturally was a big hit!  Thanks!

This pie is a hit everywhere I take it.  I much prefer it to apple. I brushed the crust with egg and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top--that gave it a good color and flavor. To make it healthier, I only used a top crust and replaced half the sugar with "blue" sweetener which didn't give it a sweetner taste.  The only danger is I could eat the whole pie by myself!

I have two pear trees in my back yard since forever and never knew quite what to do with them but to eat them raw. Today, while browsing your site I happened to notice a pear pie recipe in which I have cooked today with my children. Let me tell you it was the best pie my family and my neighbors have ever had since I cooked 4 pies and shared them around. It was just sooooooo goooooood!

My 16 year old daughter made this recipe for our family.  We made the suggested changes offered by Amy Staten McNeill because she sounded like she knew what she was talking about on this particular pie.  (Thank you Amy.)  We followed her advice by changing cinnamon to nutmeg, bumping the salt up to 1/2 tsp, and even sprinkled a little granulated sugar over the top of the pie before baking.  Amy's advice proved trustworthy:  this pie was definitely pear - no apple flavor here.  We chose Bartlett pears, and made sure we used fresh lemon juice & zest - (we sometimes cheat on those things because I don't always keep lemons handy.)  It was a big hit here, and we will most certainly be making it again.

Delicious! Everyone loved this, especially my dad since I used the pears from his tree! Will use less lemon next time, as I was told it had a pinch to much. I mixed all the ingredients with the pears. Would definitely make this again!!

This pie was amazing. I forgot to add the lemon juice but did add extra zest! I loved the sweetness and zing of the zest...I cooked my bottom pie shell before filling with pears. On 400 for 10 minutes (weighted with beans), then removed beans and cooked for another 4 minutes, then filled as instructed.

My friend was about to throw out overly ripe pears so I requisitioned them and found this recipe and what a delight!!  Totally worth the 5-star review.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did as others suggested and tossed the pears in the sugar/flour mixture prior to pouring into the pie crust.  I also love cinnamon so I increased it by 1/4 tsp. and added about another 1/4 of sugar (I like it sweet) and it got rave reviews from all my friends.  A refreshing alternative to apple pie.

Gosh this was really good. It is not icky sweet. I think it is just perfect the way it is. I can't imagine it any other way. We have pear trees galore where we live and Nobody around here will pick the local trees, so I generally put up about 600 pounds of pears. So this is just a perfect pear pie for that cold winters day like today. Excellent!

I honestly think this tastes better than apple pie.  I had a bunch of pears from my sister-in-laws tree so decided to triple this recipe and freeze the other two batches for another day.  I did not have a lemon on hand so that was omitted.  I also topped with the crumble topping that another viewer listed: 1/2 C. butter (melted), 1/2 C. brown sugar mixed into butter and then 1 cup of flour.  I also added into this crumble some walnuts (I didn't have pecans on hand).  A great pie crust recipe on this site is "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" if you're looking for an easy homemade crust to accompany this.  I baked at 350 for an hour.  Thanks for making me look like a master baker!

1/2 Cup of sugar = WAAAAAAAAY too much. Pears are nice sweet so just a couple of tablespoons was perfect, almost too sweet even.  I would've had to have thrown the whole pie out if I used 1/2 cup!

I got alot of pears from a neighbor and didn't know what to do with them all. So glad I found this! This was very easy to make and takes just like an apple pie. I followed the advice of another follower and used corn starch in stead of flour. I did not use lemon zest, but I did use the lemon juice. Delicious recipe!

This recipe is incredible!!  After making this pie I have people asking for this recipe! We actually like pear pie over apple pie! The only change I made to this was adding 1 tablespoon of cornstarch!

I admit I did not make this as shown, but will rate it high because my pear pie recipe is so good.  Since this one sounds so much like "apple pie" and pears are usually bland, I switch things up by omitting the cinnamon, using orange peel instead of lemon and adding 1/4 c raisins and 2 T. chopped walnuts.  (My recipe also calls for 3 T. instant tapioca instead of flour).  When pie is cooled to luke warm, glaze with a thin powdered sugar, orange juice & orange peel glaze.  Fabulous!

Loses the pear flavor in baking. A good pie but tastes just like apple pie so not sure I would use pears again.

I too had lots of fresh pears from our orchard, so I found this recipe and decided to make it.  This pie is fantastic!!!  It does taste a little like apple pie, but even better!  I will be making this one again instead of apple pie.  I only had enough pastry to use on bottom of pie  and so I made a crumble topping of brown sugar, butter & flour.  It is the best pie I have tasted in a long time :)

This was wonderful, we made it twice in 1 week, found that we needed to increase total baking time to 45 min at 350, otherwise it was too soggy. We mixed all the ingredients first in a big bowl with the pears, that way it was evenly distributed, I think I will try some golden raisins or cranberries for my next pie.

WOW! No one in my family has ever tried pear pie., but AM I GLAD I FOUND THIS RECIPE!!! The 1st time I made it I forgot to dot w/butter, and sprinkle w/lemon juice, but it was still superb, so I made again(2 separate fam gatherings in 3 days) Both times I also added 1/2 cup dried cranberries that I plumped up w/hot water for 10 min..Delicious(& I'm sure this recipe, as is, would still be a winner for me had I not added this)

Don't get me wrong; this pie is delicious. I'm just a little disappointed that it doesn't taste like a pear pie. Both my mom and I agreed that if we didn't know it was pear, we would think it was apple. As for the recipe, I didn't change a thing. 

UPDATE: I figured out why the pie tasted like apples - the pears weren't ripe enough. If making this pie, make your your pears are as ripe as they can be before cooking them. Happy baking!

Enjoying this pie right now.  Followed the recipe using Bartlett pear's and a store bought crust.  Very good.  The pears give the pie a very nice flavor similar to the apple pie, but with that distinct sweet pear taste.

Yum. Pears were very cheap this week, and I decided it was time to try baking a pie with them. This came out great. It's similar to apple pie (flavor-wise), but still has that sweet, mild pear flavor. It was a huge hit with everyone, including two toddlers. The only change I made was, I mixed the pears with the flour, sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon. Then, dotted it all with the butter.

Fantastic. I used graham cracker crust and topped it with the leftover graham cracker mixture. Used 3/4 of a yali pear that I had on hand. Small pie....enough for the 4 of us for dessert, fabulous!!

Wonderful pie... very much like apple, but a little different.  I made it mid-September with fresh pears from my tree.  Brown sugar was substituted for the white sugar and also a little more cinnamon.  It was great warm with ice cream and just as delicious cold with a cup of coffee.  It is a recipe that will definitely be used again,

This pie was absolutely delicious and has been added to my all-time favorites!  I replaced the white sugar with 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar.  I also used fresh sqeezed lemon juice in my second batch of pies which was definitely preferred over bottled lemon juice in my first batch of pies (I made 7 pies).  This pie is HIGHLY recommended.

This was so very yummy...I was actually pretty lazy, I got the frozen pastry pie shells from my local supermarket, I purchased the canned pre-sliced pears in light syrup.  I bought two of the larger cans and drained them.  I also bought gruyere cheese, which I grated and rolled into the pie crust.  I also topped crust with the grated cheese as well.  It came out very nice, my boyfriend loved it!  Ooh...and I left out the lemon, not huge fan of lemon in general.  The pie was not sweet, but I wasn't overly generous with the sprinkling of the sugar/flour mixture.

this is an excellent recipe. I would not change a thing.I didn't think you could taste the lemon as an individual taste, rather it combined with the pears to create a wonderful zing. I grated the nutmeg over each layer lightly.It was perfect.

I liked this recipe quite a bit. It was easier to make than I thought. I used 3 large pears and 1 apple, it turned out very nice indeed. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.

Who knew pear pie was so good?  Recipe was GREAT, used a box crust and left out the lemon juice & zest (not a big fan).  Other than that kept right to the recipe and it turned out perfectly. All the roommates said it was better than apple pie which I agree.

Very Good, but try to find very ripe pears otherwise you loosed the unique flavor.  Most of my guests thought it was apple.  Yummy nonetheless. PS adding nutmeg is great.

OK, I must say, pears do make super pies! I had so many pears from our pear tree and they don't ripe well, so I really wanted to make something that involves baking these pears. I followed the recipe except I tossed pears in sugar mixture and it was BETTER THAN APPLE PIE.

Absolutely fabulous recipe!! Extremely easy to make and the taste is wonderful. Light and airy and sweet, but not overly so. We are usually not fans of fruity desserts, but this was wonderful. It didn't last very long. We used pears that were very soft and on their last leg so this was a good way to use them up. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

I adjusted this recipe because I didnt have any lemon zest.  I used the same amount of vanilla extract in stead of the lemon zest... It was amazing!!!!!!  Perhaps next time i will use slightly less cinnamon because the taste of it slightly overpowered the taste of the pear.

Wow - this was as excellent as all the other reviews stated.  I would only serve this with whipped cream, not ice cream - it is so delicate that whipped cream seems more fitting.  I ran out of pears and used 1 apple and it was amazing.  I highly recommend this recipe!

DELICIOUS PIE!! There is just something a little different about a pear pie that is wonderful! And the recipe for this one is absolutely THE best! I made it yesterday and of course my husband and I had a piece, but then he had to have a piece for breakfast this morning. And he doesn't even eat breakfast! So good! This one will definitely go into our favorite recipe box! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this pie was excellent!  However, I forgot to add the lemon juice.  It still turned out great.  I think the lemon juice would've added a little tartness that was missing.  I'll try it next time.

Very good and simple pie. It does taste like apple if you use cinnamon so I added a little nutmeg which brought out the pear flavor nicely. I used unripe Bartlett pears (I was in a rush) but an extra 20 minutes in the oven while covered with foil softened them up nicely. Also, they didn’t turn into mush which I feel happens often with fruit pies.

I used about 2/3 of the spice mixture which made for a more savory pie (the pears I used weren't too sweet). Regardless of using 2/3 or all the spice mixture, this makes for a really wonderful pie. Absolutely delicious!

How wonderful that a few simple ingredients can produce something so wonderful!  I used brown sugar because I was out of white...probably white would have been better.  And I didn't have the lemon zest or juice, so I just left it out.  But with those variations, it was still great!

This really doesn't taste like you would think.... It was a nice spin on the traditional apple pie taste. The pears give it just a little boost in the fruit flavor. I think next time I will cut the nutmeg in half. It was a bit over powering. I also didn't have any course sugar so I sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the top before baking and it was fabulous!!! Also a good idea to use a deep dish. The amount of pears this recipe calls for is too much for a standard 9" pie plate.

Delish! And I love that it only has a TB of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  Make it using the French Pastry Pie Crust from this website, and you'll be happy you did.  :)

Didn't use the lemon zest but did follow one of the reviewers advice and used a tablespoon of fresh ginger and instead of flour used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I didn't layer, I just mixed everything together.  Before putting in the oven, I wet my pie crust with milk and sprinkled sugar on top.  Very good!!!

Great fall flavour!  Serve it with vanilla ice-cream.  As others suggested, tossing the sugar mixture with the pears makes for better distribution.

Mix your pears with the sugar and then add. Some of our company thought it was a apple pie.  I used butter flavored crisco and what a great pie.

Our pear tree produced an exceptional crop this year. I found this recipe and it is delicious. I did exchange the lemon juice and zest for orange in some of the pies and it is outstanding. I was able to freeze several pies for a later time. Thanks for giving this recipe.

Incredible!  I may have put in a touch more lemon zest & juice than called for but it tastes great and makes for an attractive slice.

I had never tried pear pie before so I didn't know what to expect. This was delicious! I loved the lemon hint to it.

This was enjoyed by all, although I didn't find the filling to be anything life-changing.  When eating the fruit, I prefer pears to apples, but in pie, I have to say I prefer apples to pears.  I just like the tartness of an apple pie a little more.  I filled a whole wheat flax crust (double crust) and grated some gruyere on the top and THAT was life-changing.  I think without the special touch of cheese this would've been some ho-hum-pretty-good-pie-but-I-ain't-gonna-write-home-about-it.

Someone sent us a box of wonderful pears for Christmas, and we couldn't eat them fast enough.  I found this recipe on the site, and decided to try it to use the pears.  My husband went nuts.  He said it was the best pie ever.  I will definately make this again and again.  Thank you!

I got to thinking to myself hey I've had lots of apple pie in my life but never had a pear pie. Nor have I ever heard of pear pie, so I googled pear pie and found this recipe. Made it and an Apple pie using the same recipe for both pies and the pear pie was gone first. Every body was suprised when they found out it was a pear pie. they want it again. I am happy with it but I am going to tweak it a bit next time.
 Now I used my gramma's hot pie crust recipe witch is great for fruit pies real nice and flakie but not so great for pot pies. It's a hard crust to work with and not to pretty but dang good.
    
     It just fit my taste.

I think this pie is excellent! its super easy and tastes delicious..the only thing I do differently is mix together the flour and sugar, etc and stir it in with the pears and then dump into shell and top with butter.

This was awesome. I have about 6 asian pears and was looking for a recipe. I did make the change as one person suggested to use corn starch in stead of flour which made it set up perfect.

I had a bunch of pears in the house and was trying to use them up.  We just loved this.  I think my boyfriend liked it more than apple pie.  Delicious.  

P.S.  I didn't skin the pears.  Takes too much effort and really doesn't matter if you thinly slice the pears.

Purple Ribbon Pie!   I had never heard of or tasted pear pie.  I had pears from a friend and decided to give it a try.  Wow!  My dad thought that he was eating apple pie--but this is much better!  I will most definitely be making this again!  Yum!

This was disappointing, only because it was almost indistinguishable from apple pie. It probably could be improved with additional spices spices . The consistency of the cooled pie made for a nice, neat slice, but I don't think I'll make this again. Not bad, just lackluster, for me.

Yum, yum. It was a little sweet for my liking, so next time I will reduce the sugar. But this was a fun variation on an apple pie. Everyone loved it.

I made this pie because my little guy is allergic to apples. After taking it to a picnic and only getting one slice, I made another the next day. It didn't last long! My mom, who doesn't even like pears, has decided that I can just bring this pie to Thanksgiving instead of having apple. It tastes just the same. So yummy!

this is probably the best fruit pie ever created! WAY better then an apple pie. I use the No Fail Crust by Molly from this site. i always get rave reviews even from the ones that arent pie eaters or even ones that arent pear fans. I went with the other reviewers suggestions about mixing the pears with the sugar mixture before placing into the crusts. I also use a mixture of about 6-7 pears (depending on the size) because i like a fuller pie. Thank you Carol for such a scrumptous dessert. i cant tell you how many times i've made this but it's a hit everytime. Take my advice and others here. this is the recipe you want!! mmm yummy

The first pie that I've made-it's super easy to make and really quite delicious!  The only thing that I would add would be to sugar coat the top crust.  Turned out fabulous and my hubby loved it too!

Delicious. The 2nd time I made this I forgot to adjust the rack height to the lowest position and the bottom of the pie was wet and soggy. I won't make this mistake again and I'll also put some of the sugar/flour mix on the bottom of the pie before adding any pears. Guests still really enjoyed it though. Nice change of pace from your standard fruit pie options.

The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is that I can't give it more!  This is absolutely the best pie I've ever eaten!  It's light and full of flavor and not really that fattening.  I just wish my pear trees produced all year long!!!

A wonderful Fall pie!!  I also threw in 2 small handfuls of Craisins and used orange zest instead of lemon.  Next time, I'll omit the butter, because it doesn't add much.

This was my first pie ever, made it last night, it came out perfectly. i did substitute lemon for ginger and put a crumble on top of flour, butter, brown sugar, and pieces of white american cheese (i know that sounds odd but it is really yummy) thank you for the great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe, I actually prefer pear pie to apple pie!  I have made this pie for friends and family and every time I make it, ppl rave about it.  Definitely a keeper and I like how is is a different twist on the traditional pie that ppl do not expect.

Really does taste very similar to apple pie. It was nice as right now, pears are less expensive than apples and its just something different. Even my skeptics gave in and loved it!

This pie is delicious. It tastes similar to an apple pie but the pears add a great flavour! The only thing I changed was to mix the sugar mixture with the pears as others have suggested.

Great recipe! I think I added more lemon juice and zest than they suggested, but otherwise, I followed the recipe and had no problems or complaints. I used 4 kinds of pears and sliced them VERY thinly -- it helped fit more pears in I think.

The best. I will definately make this again, it is perfect. If you don't like lemon or a little tartness in your pie its not for you-stick to the sweet American style recipes.If you have a more Europeon type pallet you will enjoy the sweet/tart flavour mix.

I made this as written except didn't use the lemon zest.  This was terrific.  Keep in mind, with a 9" plate five cups of fruit does not make a mounded pie.  If you like that, you'll need to make adjustments.  I personally like a "flat" pie because sometimes mounded seems like too much fruit.  Anyway, the flavors were fantastic.  Got great reviews.  Thank you.  Will definitely use again.

Very good, mild flavor.  I followed the recipe except for omitting lemon.  Sprinkling the spice mixture over each layer worked fine for me.  I used  Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts and 4 very large ripe Bartlett pears.

Delicious!  Instead of using a full teaspoon of cinnamon, I used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I forgot to add the lemon juice, but the pie still came out lovely.  I also grated some gruyere cheese over the crust before I baked it, a la Pushing Daisies.  Baked for an extra 5 minutes.

No one I knew had ever heard of pear pie but everyone really liked it. I used Bosc pears that were very ripe and they were a bit of a pain to peel plus I didn't really care for the consistency of them in the pie. The taste was good but I think next time I'll use them the same day I buy them.

I made this pie for our family holiday gathering and it was a bit hit. I used 7 pears to fill my pie crust (not deep dish)and served with vanilla ice cream. Wonderful recipe... Next time I will make 2 pies!

I was looking for a recipe to use some pears I had that were going to be past ripe before we had a chance to eat them. I'm glad I found this one! I made it a day ahead and then took it to an evening outdoor concert/picnic and it was great! The taste is not as sweet as an apple pie, and more elegant, if that makes since. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and a little more zest than was called for. I served it with a dollop of cool whip and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top. Very tasty! I'll make it again.

Pears are my favorite fruit but hubby resists getting them because they bruise so easily and get overripe so quickly.  This recipe?  Problem solved!  He loved it as did everyone else.

AAAA-MAZING!! I don't care for apples but i LOVE pears and this was an awesome way to serve them! It really keeps the flavor and texture of the pears in the pie. I will definitely be making this one again! A big hit with everyone... even my picky boyfriend!

Used Bosc Pears for this recipe - because they were bigger and easier to peel.  Also used golden-sugar instead of white and extra cinnamon.  I added more lemon juice because I didn't have lemon zest.  
It tasted like a tarter version of apple.  Everyone who tried it thought it was great!  Will definitely make this again.

It was a nice way to use the pears that are on sale this time of year. Hubby liked it as a change from apple pie.

This was a simple and fun recipe to make with the kids.  The taste was okay the first day we made it; however, when left to sit overnight, the pear flavor was stronger and the pie tasted much, much better.

Very good! I had never made anything with pears before, but had an abundance from a pear tree. Perfect way to use them. The kids loved this pie! I would recommend slicing the pears very thin if they are hard pears. Good with vanilla ice cream, too!

very good and easy to make. I used the really ripe pears from my fridge and it came out perfect. I also used extra lemon zest and lemon to give it that zing.

I made this pie with some homegrown pears.  The flavor was excellent!  I love the hint of lemon - it was very flavorful and unique.  I used 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white sugar, and I chopped my zest into tiny pieces.  The only problem I had was that the pears cooked up rather soupy - and I'm not sure if this is from the type of pear I used, or if they were too ripe?  But even though it wouldn't win any presentation awards, it tasted fabulous!

Fantastic for the pears I had that were over ripe.  Did it in a tart pan which was really pretty.  Sold it at the coffee shop that I manage.  Ate a couple pieces for breakfast myself!

YUM! I made this yesterday to use up some pears that were almost going bad and I'm glad I did! It is very similar to apple pie, but with a nice pear taste! I didn't dot the pears with butter, but it still turned out great (I think there was probably more than enough butter in the crust!). I also cut down the sugar a bit since pears are already quite sweet. Great recipe though! Tastes great cold too!

A classic! Crunchy, just-right spiced, sweet pears hold their shape & bake up perfectly. I used Bosc pears. I will add this to my "Favorites" in my recipe collection & bake it again (& again!).

I used 3/4 cup of sugar as the fruit was sweet. Also, maybe go easier on the cinnamon and try the nutmeg as reviewed by someone else.

It was really good. Pie was easy to make. Pears were a little crisp. I think the next time I will try decreasing temp. And cooking a little bit longer. All in all I will definitely do it again!

Only thing I did different was cook the pear mixture same way I did the preserve, but not as long. I wanted to cook up alittle of the juice. I had allowed the pears to sit in sugar mixture over night. I added grounded cloves, cinnamon and allspice. Delicious!

This is an awesome recepie! My pies tasted like pears, I used nutmeg instead of cinimmon, as suggested by a different review. I also used a crumble top,¼ c brown sugar, ¾ c flour, and ½ c melted butter.  If using the crumble top, I would cut back on the surgar in the pie filling.
Also it seems better to have a mixture of semi firm and very ripe pears, that way the filling has some pears with more texture.  This recipe is very versatile, tweak it to suit your taste.
I took one pie to pot luck and only one piece was left.  Therefore I made another pie later the same day for at home because my family didn't get our fill of this yummy pie.

As I made it, the spices were so similar to those of an apple pie, I wondered if it was going to taste like an apple pie. But no, it tasted like pear! Yum. Great way to use up pears that were ripening faster than we could eat them.

This pie was AWESOME, even using ready-made pie crusts! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I made a lattice crust for the top. (personal preference)
I think baking at 450 for the first ten minutes w/the baking sheet underneath made the crust perfect. I recommend trying to slice the pears uniformly thin, rather than "chunks," and don't skip the lemon zest or juice!
  I never would have made a pear pie, except that my financial planner always sends a Christmas box with pears and a couple of apples...now, I know what to do w/all those pears!!

Delicious!! OMGosh! Followed directions exactly — well, except for waiting a few hours for it to cool! We ate it hot the first night and scooped it out cobbler style. Will definitely make this again!  The lemon adds such a delightful brightness to the recipe; don’t skip it. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.

First time I’ve made a pear pie.  Everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly but added grated ginger as well.  Next time I’ll cut smaller slices of pears so they cook a little more.

I had never had pear pie before, but this was wonderful.  I substituted half the cinnamon with nutmeg, as some suggested, and by accident, used the lemon juice in the dry mixture.  Still worked out well.  Delicious!

Not bad, but not great (though I admit I didn't have lemon zest, though I don't think that would've improved it that much?).  I thought it just tasted like cinnamon and wasn't very sweet. My husband liked the recipe as is, but he gravitates toward more bland food and I like a punch of flavor.
I will try again with tweaks. Definitely needs at least double the salt to better bring out the sweetness. Also, I'll probably add nutmeg and will try 1/4 C white sugar and 1/4 C brown sugar instead of 1/2 C all white sugar.

I used a Pyrex dish. I didn't put cinnamon or nutmeg. I wish I had not put in more salt than the recipe called for. I also did not make slices. I just cut up about seven pears. I also cooked it for ten minutes more .  My husband and I really enjoyed the pie.

1. As written, it's pretty good especially if you like apple pie. 
2. I changed the salt from 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. 
3. I changed the 1 tsp of cinnamon to 3/4 tsp and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. 
4. I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl and then mixed the fruit so it was thoroughly coated before placing in the pie shell. 
I will definitely make this again.

Since my pears were still hard, I cooked them first to soften them. And like some others have said, I mixed the pears with sugar mixture(actually after I put pears on the crust because I forgot!) and baked it. Turned out so good! It was like a lighter version of an apple pie.

Pears make a nice alternative to apple pie -- particularly if your pears are nice & juicy. (and if not, move on. :-) ) As others have done, I changed it up a bit: Substituted the 1/2 C white sugar for 1/4 C Splenda & 1/4 C brown sugar. I substituted the 3 T flour with 4 T corn starch.  I cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp., then added 1/4 tsp. ginger & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. I omitted the butter, and the top crust. Instead I made a crumb crust by combining 1/2 C. brown sugar, 3/4 C. flour, 1/4 c. chopped dry roasted/salted almonds and mixed in 1/4 C. melted butter. Yum! The almonds toasted up nicely during the baking process and added a bit of interest to the crumb crust.

This was good, but required a number of changes for me. I use the Emile Henri pie dishes, so this took 7.5 C of sliced pears, added 1/4 C brown sugar, reduced cinnamon to 1/2 t., then added 1/4 t. each of powdered ginger, allspice, cardamom and fresh grated nutmeg. Heavy on the lemon zest, tossed the lemon juice in with pears as I sliced them, used 4 T cornstarch and 1 T flour, mixed sugar and spice in with that and incorporated it into pears before turning into crust laden pie dish. Topped the top crust with brushing of melted butter and sprinkled white sugar. Took approx an hour to bake and bubble. It still could have taken heavier hand of spices and zest and sugars for that many pears, but it was a nice subtle flavor which allowed the complexity of the four varieties of pears I used to shine. This amt of cornstarch and flour was perfect for a great set with no runny juices for that amt of pears, it cut beautifully. Will make again for something different.

We liked this a lot, and it definitely tasted like pears, not apples (which some reviewers reported). Maybe it depends on the type of pears.  Ours were what I think are bartlet pears from a tree in our yard.  I think the lemon zest and  fresh squeezed lemon juice are very important to bring out the best flavor of this filling, and I might use a little extra next time I make it.

I used baking pears instead of regular pears. Additionally, since baking pears are so much harder and crunchier, I tossed them into a small pot with cinnamon, nutmeg, butter and the sugar and cooked on low-medium heat until the pears were mostly soft. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and tossed into the baking dish. My husband had eaten the entire pie in two days and asked if I would make another pie from the pears leftover.

This was really tasty and easy to make.  I did make some minor changes based on advice of past reviewers though.  I just tossed the sliced pears with the sugar mixture rather than layering as directed (I then just placed the mixture in the pie crust about a third at a time, dotting with butter and drizzling lemon juice on top after each addition). I used 6 cups of pears and added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I also used a crumb topping rather than a top crust (1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup flour- thanks to a previous reviewer's suggestion) because that is my preference for pies. A really nice pie- I loved the addition of lemon!

I didn't use the lemon as my husband didn't care for it the first time I made it. Now he can't eat it fast enough!! I also used the pre-rolled pie crusts you can get at the grocery store. This is our new favorite pie. Be sure to get soft pears. Enjoy!

i always wind up butchering recipes because i hate following directions. anyway they manage to usually come out well.  for this pie i used pears from my yard even though the raccoons and skunks have scarfed up most of them. some were ripe, some green and hard. i used a premade crust, confectioners sugar instead of flour and sugar, and squeezed lime instead of lemon zest. also twice the amount of butter. no top crust. instead covered with pierced foil during baking and served with melted sharp cheddar on top, added last few minutes of baking. odd i know but tasted great.

This pie was so easy to make (I used my local HEB brand prepared crust), and when I made one, EVERYONE LOVED IT!!  Since I had so many pears from my tree, I made 6 more for freezing and gifts.  I am hoping that they are as good in the disposable pie pans as it was baked in my glass pan, though.  I'm a little worried about that.  If they are, I am going to make more of them to freeze!!

Amazing pie! Love the lemony addition to the pie. Used Anjou pears and turned out great. We sprinkled the leftover sugar mixture on the top of the pie and loved it. Definitely something to be made again. Wonderful tasting pie!

I was so happy to find this recipe.  The pear tree did so well and I had no idea what to do with them!  The pie is perfect!  The only thing I didn't use was the lemon zest and it was still great.  Can these be frozen so I have some for the holidays?

This pie was AMAZING.  I made it vegan by using the "Buttery Double Crust" recipe from Isa Chandra Moskowitz's and Terry Hope Romero's "Vegan Pie in the Sky" book and by using Earth Balance vegan margarine instead of butter (though I'm not sure the butter is even necessary at all for a great pie).  I also didn't bother layering the pears and the sugar mixture - I just mixed it all together in a bowl, poured it into the bottom pie crust, and lattice-crusted the top.  5 stars - amazing pie.

Excellent recipe and it came out good on my first try. I mixed a portion of the dry mixture with the pear slices then rest as I layered. this is going to be a standard in my house.

OMG! This is amazing! I mixed 5 peeled slices pears with everything, and used a pre-made pie crust. I had enough to make a lattice crust too... I didn't dot with butter or use any lemon juice, both are totally un-necessary and the lemon zest (I did just about the whole-medium sized-lemon) gives it just the perfect amount of lemon. SO GOOD!

I bought a case of pears at Sams Club that were mushy.  I just thought what the heck am I going to do with all these pears?  I made this pie for my skeptical-apple-pie-loving fiance.  He loved it! I loved it.  The sweet soft pear flavor mixed beautifully with the hint of tart lemon.  I will be making this again and again.

I was pretty dubious of pear pie in general, but I had some old bartlett pears sitting around that needed to be used.  Absolutely delicious!  Somewhat like apple pie, not too sweet (as I was afraid would be the case with bartletts), will definitely make again.

This pie is so good!  I ended up using two pears and three apples (because I didn't have enough pears) and I can't wait to try it again using just pears.  It's great warm with some whipped cream.  Yum!

We had an abundance of pears from my parents' garden so I tried this recipe to use them up.  Now these pies are a family favorite.  Every summer people are constantly asking when the pies will be ready.  Preferred over apple pie in our house.

Great pie! The pie isn't too sweet or tart at all, the lemon and butter really make this a mild tasting pie. Similar to apple but better! The pears do put off quite a bit of juice, but its great if serving with ice cream! Everyone who ate it loved and loved the mix of flavors. I used 4 different varieties of pears that were ripe so it turned out wonderful!!

Very tasty! I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose but I think it still tasted pretty good and had a caramely texture inside.

A wonderful change from apple pie.  Use the best pears you can find, and a mix of different varieties makes it even better.

This tastes very similar to apple pie.  I added a crumb topping and it was very tasty.  A great way to use the pears up that grow on my parents' tree.

WOW!!! What a pie! With the two changes i listed below, it took me less than 30 minutes to put together and the baking time was on the spot! I've never had pear pie in my life but found myself with a few to spare so I went ahead and put this one together. The only changes I made were using a 2pack of Pillsbury pie crust and since I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand or dried lemon zest, I just added a bit more lemon juice (about 2 tbsp total). Will make again! It was AMAZING! Even my husband, who does not like much of anything sweet, LOVED it!

I made this pie for my family at and early Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! I modified a little by cutting the sugar in half and adding 1 tsp fresh grated ginger. I will be making this one again.

GREAT recipe! I am not even a pie person, but this was so yummy and fun to make! I did leave out the lemon zest but that is just personal preference. My husband ate it  fresh out of the oven while I liked it better cold the next morning after it had been sitting in the fridge all night. Either way this is a delicious pie!

This was a great recipe. I followed the directions to a T. Next time I will cut down on the cinnamon as I found it a bit overpowering and I'm not the biggest cinnamon fan. But it was still delicious and I'll be making this every pear season for years to come!

This was a good pie and went over well at a potluck.  I cut the sugar from the pie as I made a crumble topping (using brown and white sugar) and it really could have used a little more sweetening inside.  Next time, I think I would try adding some honey to the pears, with the crumble topping again.

I know the cinnamon and texture of the cooked pears lends itself to traditional apple pie, but common folks, you just can't compare!!! The freshness of the lemon zest and the warmth of the cinnamon pairs beautifully with the pears! I love this recipe! Its delightful, thank you!

My daughter brought home a bunch of pears from work.  As I am not a big fan of pears, I was a little worried about what I would do with them.  I found this recipe and am now in search of more pears.  This was fabulous!!  It was gone in one day.  My whole family loved it!  I made a second one for my parents!  Quick and easy!  Thanks so much!

This is the first pear pie that I have made and it is wonderful.  So easy and turned out beautiful.  I left out the lemon zest, but did add the lemon juice.  Whenever I have fresh pears I will be making this again.  Thank you Carol.

I had such high expectations for this pie, it sounded so good. Unfortunately, it was no more spectacular than your run of the mill, store-bought apple pie. I may look for an apple pie recipe and just substitute pears in the future. This is still sitting on my kitchen counter, nearly a week later :(

This will go down as one of my all-time favorites.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and everyone who had it raved about it!  This is my new favorite pie!

My first pear pie ever--it's better, more delicate and complex in flavor, than apple pie.  I was worried about these organic D'anjou pears being too unripe and hard for this, but my concern was in vain!  I actually think using ripe pears would have been more of a mess, a pain to peel, and more liquidy at the end.  But this pie turned out wonderfully even though I forgot to actually "measure" out the five cups of pear because I couldn't stand to see them oxidize.  I just winged it, mounding the slices slightly in the center and of course sprinkling the sugar mixture on every layer.  My friend said that it is "excellent" pie (and he's a bit hard to please), and I asked if it's his new favorite pie (taking the place of strawberry-rhubarb pie)... :)

Fabulous!  I had a bunch of pears(Harry and David kind).  I didn't peal all of them and the recipe was just fine. I cut the pears really thin.  My zester made big zest, I will make fine zest next time. Rave reviews from a family that doesn't care much for pears!

This was delicious.  The pear taste was perfect - not too overpowering as sometimes happens with other pies.  The pears were also just the right texture.  I used the pears from my tree in my backyard, which nobody eats because they are usually too hard and small.  I just used refrigerated pie shell and it was great.  Warm with whipped cream was awesome.
