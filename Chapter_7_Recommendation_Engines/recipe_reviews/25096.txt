These cookies are fabulous. If you don't want to print out the recipe just take it off the package of shortening.

These turned out great. I used a cup of real butter instead of shortening and I didn't have enough semi-sweet chips so I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips. My brown sugar was really old but even with the added brown sugar "rocks" the cookies tasted great.

These cookies were really quite tasty. I somehow didn't have any vanilla (I know how does a person run out??) so I substituted about 1 T of peanut butter to give some sort of flavoring to the cookies. The end result was a very soft and puffy chocolate chip cookie with a very nice hint of peanut butter.

This is a really great recipe!! I changed a little bit of the recipe I used butter instead of shortning and put a little bit more flour. I had to bake them a little bit longer than 7 min. They were super duper good! Best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had!:P

This is such a great recipe. I cook these once a week for my work and everyone loves these. When I cooked mine for 7 minutes like it said it wasn't fully cooked so I left it in there for a couple of more minutes and they came out wonderful.

I'm not too sure if it was becuase this was the first time I used this recipe but I found the dough to be runny and it tasted a little too salty...

first i would like to give a warning: DO NOT cook on an insulated pan. it makes the cookies spread out which causes them to run together and also be too thin so they end up crispy instead of soft. now then! i used butter instead of shortening and half bread flour because i ran out of all purpose. still they were delicious! even the crispy ones:)

I had to bake these longer than 7 minutes and I should have added more flour but I do like that they make a small batch.

I'm not much of a cookie eater but these are very good! My fiance really likes them. Mine turned out more cakey than other cookies I've made but often I find that can depend on the cookie sheet or oven I'm using. I also added some peanut butter chips to them.

Great recipee. I am almost positive it is the same as on the back of the Giradelli Chocolate Chip package. The only thing I changed was I used baking soda instead of baking powder and I put in 2 1/4 C Flour because I live in a high-altitude place. Delicious!

I read all the reviews and made this for the first time today. Came out perfect and delicious with the following changes. - butter not margarine and make sure it is soft not melted - increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup - added 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon - two cups chocolate chips and 1 cup crushed pecans. I always keep my nuts in the freezer to keep them fresh so when I added them they were cold. No need to chill the batter the pecans did it for me. - roll into balls the dough is good for that. Don't drop by teaspoons. - cook exactly 10 minutes and take out keep on cookie sheet 2 minutes as directed. - perfectly puffed and soft delish! A definite keeper.

The only thing it needed was substituting half the flour for bread flour. It makes all the difference in the world. Try it and you'll never use just flour ever again. Thanks
