5 stars all the way!! This is a simple HEALTHY side dish that will have wanting 2nd helpings. You can get creative and add raisins or cranberry's and celery which you would add at the same time you do the onions and take it up a notch. Also, slivered almonds or pine nuts would be wonderful in it too for some "crunch". I love a recipe that is healthy, tasty and you can get creative and add things to it...that wouldn't be changing the recipe just enhancing it.

love the cooking method (pilaf), definitely adds body to the the quinoa  however I could've used a bit more flavor. Might try fresh herbs and doubling the garlic next time.  Overall solid side especially for a pungent main course.

I third the recipe, added green pepper and kept the rest the same. It was very good. I will make this again.

Very good basic recipe that's easy to tweak to your own taste. I'm not a big fan of thyme, so I omitted it and used a little fresh basil in its place. I love another reviewer's suggestion of adding nuts and/or dried fruit. I think toasted almonds or pine nuts would be excellent additions next time I make this. Thank you truRoot, for a great and versatile recipe!

Really good!  I think the butter and saut√©ing it first added character.  I like it more than brown rice.  A keeper.
