Excellent recipe!  I love slow cooker meals and an alternative to preparing turkey legs.  To increase flavor, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin and 1 teaspoon of ground thyme.  Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of onion.  I substituted 1 can of mushroom soup with 1 can of cream mushroom and roasted garlic soup.

This is a good base for a turkey stew. This is definitely not your typical set it and leave it crockpot meal. We substituted sweet potatoes and added carrots, mushrooms, and peas for a well balanced meal. It would/could be better with some fresh herbs as well.

I used 2 turkey legs that we reserved from thanksgiving - they were pre cooked, but frozen. I used 4 sweet mini peppers, and 4 red  potatoes. All other recipe notes were followed.  There is enough liquid in this dish that it could easily be converted to a one dish meal by adding 2 cups of rice with the potatoes.   Because it ends up more like a gravy than anything, it would be lovely on biscuits.  It was nice for dipping crescent rolls in! The rice only serves as a sauce delivery system here.  I'd add more peppers next time - they got a bit lost in  the cooking. Overall it was a crowd pleaser and a nice way to use frozen precooked leftover turkey legs!
