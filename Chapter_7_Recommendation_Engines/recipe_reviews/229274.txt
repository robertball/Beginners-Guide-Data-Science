This is a remarkably quick, easy and satisfying dessert to make.  If you have a couple of apples on hand you could have dessert on a whim!  I loved that it didn't contain oatmeal or water and the topping was excellent - buttery with a nice crispy crunch as it should.  But... there was too much of it for the amount of apples, which made it seem much  too sweet.  Unfortunately there was no way I could use it all and I discarded the excess.  I think adding half again as many apples would be an improvement that would elevate this to 5-star status.

Finally, apple crisp like MY grandma made!  No oatmeal, nuts, or fancy things...just simple pantry staples and fresh, homemade taste. :)  This is wonderful, easy, and quickly made.  You can pop this in the oven while you eat dinner, and by the time you finish dinner and clear the dishes, it's ready.

Loved it- reason giving it 4 stars vs. 5 is it is light on apples.  I used 8 small/medium apples and that was a perfect ratio for the topping provided.  I also added a little vanilla to the topping and extra cinnamon because we like it.  This recipe is simple and delicious.  I love apple crisp that doesn't contain oatmeal!

I have made this recipe many times now and love it. I think my record is 4 in one week (lot's of company and parties). Love using Jonagolds as they don't get too soggy, and I cut them into chunks. If you find the topping a bit sweet, 3/4 cup sugar works great. I use a whisk to 'sift' the dry ingredients - so much easier and gets the job done well. So glad to have this simple and amazing recipe!

I was really impressed! This recipe seemed so simple and required only a few ingredients, so I didn't expect it to turn out very well. It really WAS simple and easy...but it turned out delicious! This will be a last-minute dessert favorite in the future!!

It was easy to make the pastry part.  But I found it too sweet so I have cut back on the sugar.  Also I added a pinch of nutmeg and that made it even tastier.

This was just as described, perfect and easy. I did not measure out 2.5 cups of apples I used Cortland (medium sized) and used about 5 total. My apples were stacked pretty high so this is probably why I didn't feel there was too much topping for the apples. The topping came out crisp, light and delicious and I served it with lowfat vanilla frozen yogurt. This will be my go-to Apple Crisp Recipe.

I used 4 cups of apples and added a half cup of pecans to the topping. Since I had more apples than the recipe called for, I baked in a slightly larger oval casserole dish. It was just a light (in density/texture not in calories... haha!) and tasty apple crisp... exactly what I wanted.  I'll make it again.

I have been making this for years . Wonderful recipe.  Don't change a thing.  Just a little clumsy to stipulate "2  1/2  cups" of apples.  Why not 6 large apples?

I loved this recipe.   I used Granny smith and McIntosh apples to compliment the tart with some sweet.  Again this was a huge hit!  I will definitely use this recipe going forward!

My granddaughter and I made this after a day of picking  apples and it was absolutely delicious. As suggested I doubled the apples and it was perfect!  My daughters wedding is in a couple of weeks and was wondering if I could freeze it?

The topping was crispy perfect, but it was too sweet.  I'm not sure if it would be as crispy with less sugar.  Next time I will try apples that are very tart.

It was delicious, and easy to make. Not time consuming. It took me longer to peel and cut the apples than it took me to prepare the whole recipe. I will make this one in place of Apple pies, when I don't have time for pies. Thank you, for recipe. I am making another one today, it will be my third time making it in less than a month.

Read reviews before making this for the first time.  Used 3 very large apples (Fuji and Koru) sliced thinly.  Cut sugar to 2/3 cup but used brown sugar. This was a smash hit for our hosts at a dinner party.  Will definitely make this again.  I may even double the recipe because people want seconds.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my grandmother's recipe, at least 75 yr old. We add sliced apples to fill a larger flat baking dish (better than a smaller deep one) and then sprinkle to topping on top. Always add cinnamon and some nutmeg on the top. Family favorite!

I made it the first time by the recipe. The second is in the oven now. The only change I made this time was to double the amount of apples just because we prefer more fruit. The topping is just what we like and super easy to make by pulsing in the food processor. Leaving little  pieces is the key to a crispy topping.

This was very easy and very tasty but the first time I made it, being the rookie that I am, I left the peel on the apples. Not a good idea. The second time I peeled them apples and it was so so much better. I think it would be great  with a scoop of ice cream which I will try next time.

I made it exactly like the recipe and I doubled it. Best Apple crisp I have ever made and I have made many. This was the traditional flavor I was looking for.

I only had two apples so I added unsweetened apple sauce about a cup. It was great, no other changes needed.

I used half brown sugar and half white. On top of the crumbs I sprinkled more cinnamon to add more flavor. So good.

Not much of a Baker but needed to do something with fresh apples picked from a farm. It was super yummy!  Can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving.

Came out excellent. 40 minutes in a metal baking dish was the perfect amount of time.

I made this using 3 red apples and 1 green apple. And it turned out amazing!! My dad can't stand cinnamon, but he loved it anyway. Wanted me to make 2 more. Very simple and very tasty!! Some people in other review said it was really sweet.  But I think its spot on.

First time making apple crisp and I burnt it a bit on top because I used a 9×9 pan and tried to guess the time to 30 minutes because it wasnt 8x8 like in the recipe, but added the extra 10 minutes because it didnt seem golden enough. Will time it to 35 minutes next time (just added that if anyone else uses a 9x9). Also, I used 7 Ambrosia apples as 2 1/2 cups only covered the bottom of my pan so I wanted another layer.
Smells amazing and will be my dessert tonight. I've been waiting to put my apples to good use! I love classic recipes too so I'm glad I tried this one first! :)

I use a mix of apples, 3/4 cup of sugar, and add 1/4 tsp of water to the apples before adding the crumble on top.  I like the fact that this recipe requires basic ingredients.  It's our go-to recipe for apple crumble...it's absolutely delicious!

Simple & delicious! I like to make plenty of topping to keep for future batches. I also only use half  a batch of topping with the full amount of apples - which came out plenty sweet with plenty of topping. For future batches, I doubled the amount of cinnamon and swapped out half the white sugar with brown sugar which improved the color and flavor a bit.

This recipe turned out perfectly and sure is a comfort food. IMO though, it is a tad too rich for my palette. I will make this again, but will use less sugar.

Our new home has a apple tree and we could not let them rot.  Found this recipe and decided to try it with our apples.  Wasn't sure which apples we had but took a gamble.  Neendless to say it was delicious!  I did add more apples than what the recipe called for as mentioned in other reviews.  Will make again!

Crust to apples ratio way off. Way to much crust and too sugary. Maybe try 1/3 crust ingredients or 3x the apples.

This really is the best apple crisp. I love brown sugar and oats and always made my crisp with both. But I had some picky eaters so I tried this version and had to leave out the cinnamon too. I was shocked how much better apple crisp is without those 3 delicious ingredients. It gave it a clean, fresh quality and it was definitely better, but isn’t that a counterintuitive outcome!? I wouldn’t have believe taking out my favorite ingredients would make something better but it really did.
 I used honey crisp apples, btw.

I loved it. Was surprised at how good it tasted. The first was a little too sweet because I did not add too much apples, but the second time I made it I added more apples and some other fruits along w/ it. I am happy about how it all came out. It truly is simple and easy!

This was so delicious and so easy to make! I used 8 small/ medium sized apples and I think that was the perfect amount for the amount of topping. I actually could have used less sugar because the apples were Galas, but it was still super good. I also added a half teaspoon of vanilla. I'll definitely make it again and probably try it with peaches also.

I used cold butter instead of softened because I was making the topping in the food processor. I tossed my Honeycrisp apples in a little bit of cinnamon (I had to use three whole apples because my apples were smaller). Will definitely make for every party!

I did slightly adjust by adding brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and about a tablespoon of melted butter to the apples prior to adding the dry ingredients. I love the simplicity of this recipe, and it turned out delicious!

I make this ALL the time.  It is by far the easiest apple crisp and the BEST I have ever made.  I love it.  Delicious and easy.  What more could you want????  My neighbor always gives me apples from her tree and what a better way to use them.  Thank you for this amazing recipe.  I follow it to a T and it turns out unbelievable every time!!

This Apple Crisp is delicious. I was looking for a recipe that didn't use oatmeal.  It reminds my of the Apple Crisp of my elementary school days.

Loved it - so easy !
I did 4 cups of Granny Smith and 1 tsp of cinnamon as we love cinnamon!
I might actually try more apples as there was plenty of that yummy crust !

I like to follow the recipe exactly before rating it. It’s not fair to make adjustments (based on other reviews or own discretion) and have the original recipe suffer in ratings for it. I agree with other reviewers. The topping is too sweet! While I will definitely make this recipe again (for to the ease and simple ingredients that are almost always on-hand) I will reduce the sugar next time to 1/2-3/4 cup and increase cinnamon to 1 tsp.

Yes i have made some changes since I am Paleo.
I used fine almond flour and ghee butter , also I grease my single serving casserole with coconut oil. It turned out amazingly  delicious. my hubby added a scoop of ice cream to his, and I was happy with just plain.
Definitely i will be making it again and again.

Only use 1/2 to 2/3 of the flour and definitely only 1/3 of the sugar.  I used half and it was still way to sweet but I also used a sweeter apple. measure the cinnamon with your heart.  if your looking for a crunchy apple crumble this isn't it

I made several mistakes all with the topping. The butter was too soft and didn’t turn out like a crisp at all. The apples were delicious but it tasted like it had granulated sugar on top. I really must try again.

It is excellent as is, but next time I make it I will use more apples  for the size pan I used (8X8) and maybe 1/4 to 1/3 less of the sugar in the topping.

I made this recipe at least 5 times when I was given a bucket of apples. It is easy, simple, quick, and always gets positive feedback! I don't peel the apples because it's a lot of work when I don't even notice the skins much at all once they're all cooked. It always seems to turn out a little different each time I make it, but it's always delicious, and made with ingredients most people already have in their homes. I highly recommend trying this recipe out.

I made two crisps. One as written for a neighbor family and one for my family with low carb substitutions. I swapped almond flour for regular and monk fruit sweetener for sugar. Everyone enjoyed this recipe. I will make it again.

Made this with crisp southern pears, thinly sliced.  Very good recipe.  After reading other reviews I elected to double the amount of fruit and used a slightly larger pan.   The fruit to topping ratio was perfect.

The next time I might try adding a smidgen of grated fresh  ginger and a dash of nutmeg tossed with the fruit.  To me nutmeg has a more fruit happy flavor compared to cinnamon in cooked recipes.

Hubby loved this just the way it is.

I loved this! It was so easy to bake and it tastes great. Instead of using one cup of white sugar, I  used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar. After baking it covered with aluminum for 40 minutes, I then broiled it for about 5 minutes for a crisp top.

Where i come from we call it apple crumble, and i always thought you had to stew the apples before putting them in the dish! So it was very easy as you just chuck the apples in the dish and grind up the flour and butter. The only hassle is peeling the apples and cutting the butter, but it turned out great! I reduced my sugar to 3/4 but it was still quite sweet, but it tastes beautifully crisp and my family loved it and asked for seconds! I served it with whipped cream but it honestly tastes better on its own. thank You!

After reading several reviews, I decided to use seven  (about 5 cups) Granny Smith apples.  The  textures of the crumble and the apples together were great; however, with one cup of sugar, it was still quite sweet.  I'll definitely use this recipe again; I'll simply adjust the sugar content until I get the right amount for my family and me.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

It needed less of the powder mixture and more of the butter to hold it together and crisp.  The flavor was so nummy though.

I think this is a very good recipe, because it is so easy. However, as one of the other reviewers noted, there was too much topping vs. apple for my taste. The second time I made it, I doubled the amount of apples to 5 cups and replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with light brown sugar. The result was much better, in my opinion. More apples made the topping/apple better, and the brown sugar made the topping a little more crispy. Either way, I think it's a keeper!

I just made this recipe and although it tasted decent, I found the overall result to be dry and disappointing. It is definitely easy to make, though, and I'm glad I tried it.

I substituted with gluten free all purpose flour (plus 2 tablespoons psyllium husk instead of xantham gum) and followed the rest of the directions as is. I've made many apple desserts - apple pies, apple cobblers, apple butter, apple sauce, apple danish - THIS is my favorite! Made it last night just for us. Making it again for my husband's potluck at work tomorrow!

3 stars because there was not near enough cinnamon for my taste.  I went back & sprinkled the apples with cinnamon/sugar mixture & then used 1 tsp cinnamon in the flour mixture.  It was perfect.

I peeled and cut up eight green Granny Smith apples and put them in a huge greased casserole dish. Sprinkled a few tablespoons of lemon juice and a tsp of sugar on them since everyone was complaining this was too sweet! Made the topping from the recipe with no changes. Baked it for 50 minutes in the oven since there were so many apples. It came out perfect! The crunchiness of the topping was so good! My husband has been devouring this dish-- he eats it for breakfast, lunch and dessert. Maybe I will cut the sugar a little next time-- I don't think he would notice, but this is the only way I can get him to eat apples.  Thanks!  :-)

Just made it tonight. Wow! What a nice easy recipe. I used a few more apples since I used a 9" pan, I also added about half a cup of brown sugar for a bit more sweet. I am amazed how yummy it tastes. I will absolutely make this whenever I have extra apples. I may even try it with fresh peaches come summer. Thanks, I'm enjoying your recipe app very much!

This is overall way too sweet. I measured up 2 1/2 cups of apple as being 2 apples, and that wasn't enough for the pan, so I added 3.  I would decrease the sugar a lot next time. What I do like is that it is a quick dessert, and you only need basic baking supplies, and just a few apples, which I always have on hand!

Perfect and easy, indeed! I used 8 apples and didn't measure if it was 2.5 cups, but that's the only way I possibly deviated from the recipe.  Really great recipe, will make again for sure. Delicious!

Very easy to make, and really tasty.  For my taste, I found a whole cup of sugar to be a little too sweet, especially since I used HoneyCrisp apples.  3/4 cup of sugar was perfect for me.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very easy and quick. I used two very large honey crisp apples and used a round cake pan. It turned out great!

I love that this recipe was simple and straight-forward!  My husband absolutely loves apple crisp, and this is similar to a recipe I used to use when I first started making it--but this recipe has more "crisp" to it.  It looked beautiful coming out of the oven, and we are all looking forward to dessert tonight!

Added lots extra apples. I served it and all parties took 2nd much larger portions.
Filled the apples up so as to allow the topping to fit!

I really enjoyed this recipe! It's easy and delicious but I did make a few changes based of the reviews, mainly that I made it gluten free by using of gluten free flour. IT TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY. Apple crisp is my all time favorite dessert and I prefer it with a classic streussel topping without oats which is why this recipe appealed to me. I did use more apples than was listed (10 small granny smith apples which I had. The final product was a little tart but still yummy, when I make it again I'll likely use a different apple). And as a personal preference instead of 1 cup of sugar, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I also dusted the apple pieces before topping them with a little sugar and lots of extra cinnamon. In the topping, I substituted Bob's Red Mill brand Gluten Free 1-1 Baking Flour. And then I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as it was written. The topping was perfect - dry, sweet, and crumbly with just a suggestion of saltiness paired really nicely with warm soft apples.

Substituted Earth Balance dairy free buttery sticks for the regular butter with excellent results. Wonderful and easy apple crisp recipe, with a tasty crumb topping instead of a traditional oatmeal crisp.

This recipe was amazing. I recommend doubling it because it will be gone in a snap. This recipe deserves all 5 stars. I added some leftover oats for texture; it was very yummy. :)

Really easy to make! Wanted more flavor on the apple filling, so I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 2 tablespoons of white sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tablespoons butter cut in small cubes. Got the idea from another apple crisp recipe. I also used only half the topping. Amazing!

This is one of my favorite Apple Crisp recipes. That being said, I wanted to play around with the ingredients to see if I could create a healthier alternative (Vegan friendly) to this well loved dish. 
I added a 1/2 cup of extra organic apples. I substituted 3/4 cup of Maple syrup for the sugar and 8 tablespoons of Coconut Oil for the butter.  I baked the dish at 350 degrees (because of the maple syrup). 

The only issue I ran into was I decided to warm the coconut oil prior to adding to the other ingredients. The mixture became very soupy and I had to add additional flour until it reached the crumbly consistency. The dish came out tasting less sweet and more like flour. Next time, I will add the Coconut oil in its solid form. 

Either way, a great dish to drizzle a topping over and eat with a side of banana ice cream! :)

This is by far the best apple crisp receive. No need to try any other one. I have made this one for years and have not tasted a better one! Enjoy with a dollop of whipped cream on top!

This was delish!! I'm an amateur baker and I grew up on a similar Apple crisp. Very good with homemade whipped cream. I am trying it with Bartlett pears tonight, fingers crossed.

This is a great, easy recipe. I have made it three times in the past month much to my family's appreciation. What I love about the recipe itself is all the ingredients are ones that I usually have on hand. That, plus the fact that it only takes a few minutes to throw together and it yields a delicious dessert that everyone loves.

Great go-to recipe.  Quick and easy.  Always a crowd pleaser, especially with ice cream.  Best when it's fresh out of the oven.  Definitely need to make in a 8x8 dish - anything larger would make it too thin.  I always add an extra apple or two. 

Easy to make a few hours ahead by adding a little lemon juice to the apples and then stick in the oven when you're ready.
