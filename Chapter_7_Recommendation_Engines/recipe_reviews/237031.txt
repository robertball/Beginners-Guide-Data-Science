I gave this 5 stars because I make something similar and it's delicious. I have 1 question. Is the 1/4 cup of black pepper a typo, is it supposed to be 1/4 tsp? I'm going to fix this tomorrow and will play with the amount of black pepper starting with 1/4 tsp.

We liked the flavor of this dish a lot (that's why it gets 5 stars); however, I have to admit that we had no sweet potatoes or maple syrup in the house so I just used carrots instead of potatoes and just didn't put in syrup. Family ate it up with rave reviews.

Yes, for sure only use 1/4 t black pepper. I also found the recipe a little salty, but I only used cauliflower (entire head) and no potatoes. Recommend reducing salt by half. Also left garlic whole and used more cloves. Baked for about 45 min.

Really tasty. I was in a rush so I only added the following: 1/2 T. hot curry powder, 1/2 T. garam masala, olive oil, coarse salt and maple syrup. It was great! I used three sweet potatoes, which I microwaved until halfway done, and a whole head of cauliflower. Baked about 30 mins at 400 degrees. I'm sure the garlic cloves would have made it even better. I don't think I'll ever add the thyme,  however. I think it would be too overpowering.

I was hoping that this recipe would turn out like the curried veggies that a local french comfort food restaurant serves.  I'm happy to report that this recipe does!  I'm so happy I found this recipe -- fairly easy and so tasty! Thanks!

I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it was really delicious.  This is a combination I wasn't sure about but we both loved it.

I have made several versions and YES...love it.  Last night I MESSED UP by not roasting, but did it all in large saucepan, and then thinking I needed to add green, I added a package of chopped frozen spinach...AAARGH!   Unappealing with the spinach leaves coating everything.   Flavor was there, but this needs to be roasted  AS PER THE RECIPE!!!   Thanks

I made no changes and it was delicious. The curry powder I had was labeled "HOT curry powder", so they're spicier than normal but so SO good. My vegetarian husband loved them.

I needed to cook mine another 10 minutes, but I doubled it and didn't think about how that might require more time. Yummy & easy!

It was something different and good, but I think it needs something else in flavor.

Really good! Required much more than 20 mins, however, especially if you like your veggies crispy. I added onion too, because why not! And I used sweet curry: lots of flavor and barely any spice.

This dish is so good - it could be the better part of your meal.  The curry and sweetness of both the maple syrup and sweet potato are flavorful.  Steamed cauliflower pales in comparison.

Made this recipe again after the pepper revision & it was amazing! Great flavors & you can easily use a full head of cauliflower without dunking the rest. Only change I made was to use vegetable oil instead of olive oil because I wanted to maple flavor to really come through.

Great base recipe. 
I decided to use one medium/large sweet potato and a full cauliflower because it wasn't huge so half only resulted in about 6-8 pieces, it wasn't much.
I didn't add any black pepper because I'm not keen on it so it's not  something I have in. Also I didnt have generic curry powder but I did have tikka masala spice blend so I used that, also added about a tablespoon of smoked paprika and a little bit of ground ginger.
I forgot to add garlic
I also decided not to add salt, and didn't feel it suffered for it, the spices gave it plenty of flavour and worked well with the maple syrup.
Last of all I used 3 tbsp of oil and 3 tbsp of maple syrup (rather than 2 like the recipe said.

I have to say, I was a little dubious about the claim to 'bake for about 20 minutes', I was right to be. After 30 minutes the veg was still pretty much raw.
I left it another 30 minutes (1hr total) and then it was nice.
Id definitely par boil the potatoes and cauliflower for about 10 minutes first before seasoning & roasting/baking, otherwise allow for a full hour in the oven.

Everyone loved this but do not use 1/4 cup black pepper.  One tablespoon seems to be more appropriate.

only because it calls for 1/4 cup black pepper. Way too much in my opinion. I added 2-3 TBSPS that was enough. Otherwise, delicious.

It calls for 1/4 cup black pepper!!! I thought that seemed absurd so I only added 1t. and then I read reviews that said it should be 1/4t.

I left out the curry because we don't like it.  Definitely 1/4 tsp of black pepper if that - I just sprinkled a little bit over the top.  I left them in for 25 minutes - nicely browned and delicious.  The house smelled like fall, according to my husband.
