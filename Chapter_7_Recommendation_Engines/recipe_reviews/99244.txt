What an unusual (and tasty!) alternative to my dull way to prepare carrots! I would've given this recipe 5-stars, if not for the over-bearing cinnamon taste that put-off both my husband and 3-year old, so next time, I will scale it back to 1/4, if not, 1/8 tsp. The only thing that I changed was using way less than the 5 TB olive oil called for. Overall a very exotic and yummy way to prepare carrots! I served it w/ 2 recipes from here -- "Brilliant Sauteed Broccoli" & "Roasted Pork Chops with Mushrooms, Tomatoes, and Garlic Sauce" and the result was a vibrant, colorful plate of complimentary flavors.

These are possibly the best carrots I've ever eaten.  Didn't use lemon juice because I didn't think they needed it.  Such a welcome change from the old butter/dill or brown sugared carrots.  These were an excellent side to our spicy curried chicken.

Great flavors and fresh twist on the traditional steamed carrots. It was very important to maintain a crisp-tender texture in the steamer to avoid mushy carrots after sauteeing with spices.

I didn't really follow the measurements exactly because I made the dish for 20+ but the spice and herb combination tasted great together. I suggest tasting as you saute to make sure the combination is just right

I'm always looking for creative ways to cook carrots, and this is perfect! I admit I was skeptical at the cooking instructions and combination of spices... but it works! Delicious! I did not saute the garlic as long as the recipe suggested, though.

This is my new favorite way to prepare carrots. I could eat a pound of carrots this way, I loved them that much! I used carrots and sliced them into sticks, rather than using baby carrots. Awesome!

Simply delicious! My family aren't much for cooked carrots, but they couldn't get enough of these. I did tweak the recipe a little, instead of lemon juice I just used Lemon Thyme.

this was not to our tastes at all.  But I didn't steam them as directed, I steamed/baked them in the oven with all the ingredients and a bit of water (for steam).  the lemon taste didn't seem right at all...

Not so much for me.  It was good but I thought it needed more cumin, S&P.  It was a nice change from the sweet carrot recipes though.  Don't let my tastebuds dissuade you cause I'm in the minority here.

Loved the flavor of this, but I felt like it was way too much oil! I actually added a small chopped pear to mine in the last step - just warmed it through with the carrots. Delicious!! Thanks for the unique recipe.

Followed recipe but set the serving to 2 since all I had was shredded carrots. Also added roasted sesame seeds/flax seeds. Loved it! Such a break from sugary/sweet carrot versions. Finally someone who knows how to season a vegetable.

I made these carrots for dinner tonight.  I followed it for the most part.  The only thing I changed was I reduced the amount of carrots by about 1/2 pound, I used a little less oil, and only about 1/2 of the cinnamon called for.  Everyone liked them (except the 11 year old who didn't like the spice blend).  I love carrots so I will be making them again, but will probably reduce the cinnamon even further as it was a rather bold, albeit nice, flavor.  Oh yeah, I also used baby carrots.

The flavors in this dish are tasty, but it was excessively greasy.  If you make it, I suggest lowering the olive oil by half.

This is going to be the only way I make carrots from now on. My husband loved them, and he doesn't like any veggies! I only used about 1/2 of the olive oil and I forgot the lemon juice at the end. But it still tasted wonderful!!!!

I don't know what I did wrong but cooking the spices in oil didn't work for me, everything just burned even though I have the burner on the lowest setting. I started again and used a cup of the cooking liquid and threw all the ingredients in that until it began a soft boil then threw the carrots in. It's very tasty and even my picky 2 year old went back for seconds. Will make it this way from now on as it was so easy. I served this as an accompaniment to cilantro chicken and pilau rice.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit.  The next day was even better in fact now I make it the day before and don't quite finish cooking the carrots,  just finish the next day.  It's sooo good that way after the flavors have had a chance to really blend together.

These were definitely the hit of the holiday buffet for all the adults. Probably a little mature for younger palates, but the kids did try them. I thought the recipe was spot on with all the oil, spice, and herb proportions. Overall, delicious side dish that is now slated to be on our table several times a year -- not just for holidays.

Great change of pace from all the sugary carrots out there! I needed a side dish to go along with a turkey roast and barley (Brydhouse Mushroom Barley Pilaf - another fab recipe from this site), and wanted something savory. This fit the bill perfectly. I used only 3 T. olive oil - no more is needed, and roasted the garlic for far shorter than stated since it started to burn. This was too strong for some of the kids, but most of my family liked it.

My family has never been big on cooked carrots, when I found this I thought I was going out on a limb. I was happy when everyone wanted seconds! Not one carrot was left. I did not have thyme or a Bay leaf so I left them out. I followed the recipe except when steaming the carrots I added a chopped onion. Once finished it smelled so good we forgot to add the lemon juice. Next time we will add the missing ingredients. definitely a keeper!

A really nice change from sweet carrot side dishes to go with a savory roast. Will make these again!

Made this for my entire family- parents, and siblings included. They loved it and looked up the recipe before we finished dinner. Two notes about this: 1) It can take much longer than 30 minutes if you use a vegetable peeler on the carrots and then thinly slice- previously I have used baby carrots instead and it was just as great. 2) using fresh roasted garlic adds a whole other layer of flavor!

I reread the reviews after trying this recipe and I can't quite believe them.  I thought this recipe was awful.  Yuck!

Wonderful flavor. My mouth just got tired of the flavor by the end of my portion because I think it is a little much. I might tone this down a little next time that way there is more a hint of the original flavor rather than a punch of it.

Made it tonight to have with steak. Since the serving size was for  only 2 of us i reduced the recipe accordingly. I also reduced the cooking times roughly in half except for the steaming part. The end result was great and will definitely be added to our favs.

Surprised that my kids wanted seconds. They are a nice change from plain old carrots.

These turned out great! A nice change from sweetened carrots. The sweetness from the carrots and the savory from the spices was a good combination. I didn't add the lemon juice because I burned my hand like a rookie and then completely forgot it. So, I will have to make them again and decide which way is better!

Not bad, but I feel like there could’ve been more of the “sauce” to coat the carrots. Truth be told, I think I was looking for more of a glaze which wouldn’t be fair to the recipe. It had a mild flavor which fit in with the thanksgiving dinner as a nice side, just not very memorable.

These were really good!  I didn't use the lemon because the main dish had lime and thought the flavors might fight with each other.  They will be on my regular veggie option.  Great combination of spices.

Great recipe! I every seemed to cook more quickly than this recipe said it was supposed to. I recommend using multicolored carrots, as it looks great and makes for an interesting dish.

My hubbie thought there was too much cinnamon, which may have been a function of the brand new bottle of organic cinnamon I used.  I thought it too wet, it didn't seem to simmer down for me. I love carrots, but think I'll skip this recipe.

Great! and Vegan! I just thought this recipe could be simplified.  There are too many steps.
