I always enter into a recipe assuming I might have to adjust the seasonings to my preference, so giving this recipe a low score b/c some might find it bland seems unfair to what is a GREAT idea for veggie burgers.  I've made veggie burgers with just about everything, and we were so pleased with how the polenta held up.  A good alternative to this recipe is to use the tubed polenta rather than dry.  We used brown rice, & I added an egg and 1/2 c wheat germ to get to a good point of sticky as not to fall apart while cooking, which so often happens to veggies.  These cooked beautifully.  Rather than add in cheddar, we put on provolone while "frying", which we did in just a bit of evoo.  Thanks for a wonderful idea!  Polenta veggie burgers are definitely making the rounds.

this combo was really really REALLY bland. the tiny bit of seasoning gets lost among the starch......i would highly reccomend upping the fresh herbs to a tbsp or more and adding some chopped onion and more garlic .....instead of water i would boil the rice and polenta in some kind of broth or boulloin....

Where to start - this recipe is inedible. You’re doing a disservice to the ingredients by making this. It is outrageously bland. It tastes of nothing other than starch. It’s so sad.

I read the reviews beforehand and decided to add the flavor packet that came in my wild rice packet to cure the bland factor the others spoke of. Good call because these were great. I served them as a side instead of a main dish and used a mustard sauce from this site to top them with. Excellent! If serving in a bun as a "burger", you will definitely need some type of sauce for they are a little dry on their own.
