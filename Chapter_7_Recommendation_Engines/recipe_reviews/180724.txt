I would have given this 3 stars; my Indian husband would have given it 5.  Be careful adding salt...some tomato sauces have salt added already.  I used half the sugar and chili powder (I buy cp from the Indian grocery..it is hotter) called for in the recipe.  I blended the soup with a hand blender and added leftover cooked basmati rice and chopped cilantro.  Next time I think I'll leave out the cream and serve it with a dollup of yogurt and sprinkle with chopped cilantro in the style of our fav mulligatawny recipe.  I might also try this with coconut milk instead of cream.  Even with half the chili powder, my kids thought it was too spicy, but again my Indian husband loved it.  We'll make it again with adjustments.

Easy and fast to prepare, delicious results.  I substituted a bit of minced ginger and crushed garlic since I didn't have the paste.  I used home-canned crushed tomatoes, but if you prefer a smoother consistency you could run the soup through a blender. This was a delicious change of pace for tomato soup. Great Indian flavor, thanks for the recipe!

Very Good soup.  I'm not a huge fan of minimally cooked tomatoes, but this was good and very easy to prepare.

I've been sick all week with sinusitis and unable to taste anything well.  I thought this would be just the thing to loosen things up.  This is delicious!  I didn't have Indian chili powder so I used what I had, added  some cayenne and 2 dried chili peppers.  It was good the first night and great the second night.  Thanks for sharing njmom!

I used some ginger and garlic separately as I didnt have ginger garlic paste. I also used regular chili powder. I didn't have a can of whole tomatoes, so I crushed them with a hand blender. Worked perfect. My sister came over for dinner, and even though she doesn't usually like soups, she looved this one and even asked for the recipe! My kids and I loved it too. Lovely flavours, thanks for sharing!

This is quite something (I've modded with a mix of coconut milk/heavy cream).  Also fresh cilantro that I needed to use up.  I plan to make a batch of this and add cream before microwaving.  Need to keep this around for "at whim" snacking.  Excellent!

I just made this...it's quite tasty and easy to make! The only modifications I made were adding a half tsp of coriander powder, and I cut the amount of chili powder I used (from an Indian grocery) to 1 tsp. It was still quite spicy. I'd probably cut it down even further if I make it for people who don't like spice. Thanks for the recipe!
