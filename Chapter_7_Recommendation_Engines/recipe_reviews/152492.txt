I was looking for a sugar-free alternative to ketchup and found this recipe. It's actually pretty good. I think next time I make it, I'll cut the lemon juice in half...it was just a little too bitter for me. The recipe suggests freezing if not using right away, but I actually canned it in jelly jars. I also have made a good sugar-free barbeque sauce out of this catsup, too. My recipe for that is:

1/3 C organic catsup
2 tsp Worcester sauce
1 1/2 tsp blackstrap molasses
1/4 tsp prepared mustard
palmful of smoked paprika (you can use any smoke flavoring you want)
1/2 tsp baking cocoa

Just cook it to barbeque sauce consistency. I was very happy with how this turned out. It stayed well on the chicken during grilling.

This recipe is a keeper in my book! I always been a Heinz only catsup lover and this beats it by far and so much better for you using all organic ingredients.  However i did tweet the recipe to my liking. I used only Roma tomatoes, two large onions, 8 cloves of fresh garlic, 3/4 cup organic apple juice that i had already canned, tripled the cayenne pepper, organic apple cider vinegar, celery seed and peppercorns. I kept the whole cloves and bay leaf as is, as they can become overpowering imo. I added 1 cup of fresh homemade maple syrup from this years harvest. I Omitted the lemon juice. Cooked on the stove top for two hours then i put it in a large crock pot with the lid off overnight. It turned out thick and wonderful. Then transferred it to my food processor to smooth all the lumps out.  I added 1/8 tsp canning salt to each 1/2 pint jar. Sealed and hot water bathed for 10 min.  I will never buy store catsup again! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, can't wait to make it again and again...

Wow! this recipe is great!  I had a whole bunch of tomatoes from our garden that were going to go bad if I did not use them up fast.   The only things I did different was I blended the whole tomatoes with the onion and garlic in my VitaMix, added another 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple juice and cut back on the lemon juice by half.  Tastes like ketchup to me! I will be using this ketchup recipe from now on!

Fresh tomatoes are out of season so I used tomato sauce.  This catsup is great. I like it because I can control the ingredients. I have a condition that causes many things to burn the tissue in my mouth. I don't use a lot of catsup but, I miss it if I cannot use it. This recipe is tasty and simple. I was able to can several tiny jelly jars with this catsup.
