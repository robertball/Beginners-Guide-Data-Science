If you have a sweet tooth (like I do), I think you will love this! It is very rich and decadent, and a little goes a long way. The caramel sauce is delicious, and I'm looking forward to drizzling some of that over ice cream or even in my coffee! I made this exactly as directed, but my loaf was done at about 54 minutes, so keep an eye on the time, knowing your own oven. Toothpick in the center should come out clean when done.
