This salad, prepared according to the recipe, is phenomenal - the flavors blend perfectly and is as delicious the next day.  Everyone in my family loves it and it was the first dish to go at our picnics.  Now I scan all the Bush's bean cans for more recipes that will become family favorites!

I used chopped Kosher dill instead of cucumber and Catalina dressing instead of Ranch.  Excellent

This recipe was just ok. I really liked the combination of veggies, although I did add some carrot.  However, I did not care for the dill weed and ranch dressing together.  I think that this could have been so much better if a) I had just used ranch dressing and NO dill weed or b) if I had used Miracle Whip with the dill weed. But this is just my personal opinion...
