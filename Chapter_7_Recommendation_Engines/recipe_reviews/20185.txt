Very nice tuna salad recipe, but maybe there's a misprint here - the recipe says to use 3 (6 ounce) cans of tuna.  Well, seeing as I really didn't have any army to feed and there's no way that 3 Tbsp. of mayo would make any sense I used only one can.  I eyeballed the amount of chopped celery and left out the relish (personal preference).  I added a little salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders.  The addition of the hard boiled egg was a nice change.

A hard boiled egg in tuna salad is such a nice addition. I like to add chopped onion and green pepper as well as black pepper and garlic and onion powder to the mixture for more flavor.

This is a great base recipe and just needed a little tweaking to make a great sandwich. I had to add another egg, it just needed more and I only used 2 cans of tuna and had to put three times the mayo it was too dry with only the 3 Tbl. I used dried celery in the jar and added some chopped onion per son's request. I was heavy handed with the pickle relish too. This made a good lunch though, so thanks for sharing!

I stepped it up a notch. I added diced red onion, lots of celery for the crunch. Instead of sweet relish I opted to add dill or sometimes my favorite dill pickels diced up and my other version...Giuliano jalapeno spread ( it's really a relish)! WOW. Or...chili flakes.
Let the flavors mesh for several hours or overnight.
I've served in a hollowed our red bell pepper. Even diced the tops into the salad. Great on crackers too. Toasted bread is a must!
I don't use the egg, but I do use Costco's Kirkland Albacore and chill the cans ahead. I keep all in the fridge for fast cool salads or sandwiches.

Also, another variation....diced cucumbers (persian), dried dill.....the sky is the limit.  Even added tabasco at times, or lemon juice.  Have fun...let the family rate them or have several and give your guests rate them. I did this for an all day bbq as lunch snacks.  SoCal so we try to make it healthy. I also use light Best Foods mayo.
You can do all the above and also add  small shell pasta.    Enjoy

This Tuna Salad is the best, i've been making it this way all my life and Im in my 40's...instead of celery I use onion. The only way to eat it in my family. 3 cans of tuna needs alot more mayo then 3tbs...I eye it "no measurement".

I used chopped garlic dills instead of sweet pickle relish and after mixing up the ingredients, I did add more mayonnaise to make it wetter. I also added a little onion powder/garlic powder/fresh ground pepper. This was a nice quick tuna salad for the boys' lunches--it filled two small hoagie rolls and three sandwiches.

Excellent entree for a light lunch. Prepared this recipe with minor tweaks; used 3 6.5 oz packages of tuna rather than canned(better texture),added 1 egg (more substance), diced small red onion (more crunch), 1 T Dijon mustard (the heat is nice). Loved it. Will do again.
Thanks, Kristiev

This is a pretty good tuna salad recipe.  Are the ingredients right? 3 cans of tuna?  That would make about 6-8 sandwiches depending on how much you put on the bread. Only 1 egg and only 3 T's of mayo for 3 cans?  That seems off.  Either way, I made it with 1 can of tuna upped the mayo and kept all else the same.  Tasty with the egg and a little different from my normal tuna go to recipe.

My two minute version.  For two of us, I just use one 5-oz can of tuna, still use one egg, adjust the other ingredients.  I microwave the egg in a covered bowl at 50% power for one minute, then crush with a fork and mix with other ingedients.  Literally ready in two minutes, really!

The best tuna salad recipe ever. Classic and tastes like home. It's not gourmet, but if you're looking for gourmet, why are you making tuna salad? Love it on toast.

This is great! I have been making a similar recipe all my life, with one exception. Try Miracle Whip! It has such a wonderful tangy flavor....you'll love it I swear. I've snuck it in on die-hard mayo lovers and they said it was the best they had ever had.

I used one egg for only one can of tuna, and thought it was perfect.  I cut all the other ingredients by a third, except for the mayo, which I cut even a bit more.  Dill relish was my choice.  I really enjoyed this simple salad for lunch!

This is good, however I didn´t have mayo so I subbed with 1 Tbsp light ranch dressing and 1 Tbsp sour cream. Also, I like to add onion to my tuna.

Very good. I've been making tuna fish similar to this for years. I really like the egg in it. I added a bit more mayo in it than what the recipe calls for.

Not bad but too plain for my personal taste.  My family did not like this.

This is a simple recipe that tastes FABULOUS!  I'm very picky when it comes to tuna salad and this one is PERFECT!  I did add an extra egg and a little extra freshly ground black pepper.  Delicious!

Such an easy and quick dish to whip up and it's very good. I added chopped apples to mine. Next time I will add a little bit of onion to it I think.

Great tuna salad! Since everything has gotten smaller (my can was 4 oz), it's common sense to add the amounts that are work for you (otherwise you probably won't like it). My preference was to use only 1 tblsp of relish (would not want more). Nice change adding the egg.  I also added a little garlic and onion powder. This really makes a lot for one can. Thanks for the recipe. I'll surely make this again!

Didn't have the celery so I skipped that and added in some finely chopped onion , but the rest of it was great. I did plus up on the eggs but i doubled the recipe.

This is exactly how I make my tuna salad when I want a “no frills no fuss” easy sandwich. I didn’t bother to measure the mayo...just used a large forkful and stirred in.

Good basic recipe. Made a few minor alterations. Only added 1.5 stalks of celery, 2 tbsp of may, 1 tbsp of sweet relish, and 1 tsp of Dijon mustard. Will add red onion next time for added flavour.

Great recipe! The eggs were a wonderful addition that enhanced the flavor! Thanks for your tip to include fruit as well.  Adding 1/4 cup of cranberries, 1/4 tsp of Old Bay spice  and one garlic clove to the ground pepper creates an extra layer of spiciness. One-eighth of a large onion also gives a nice, crunchy texture. We were out of celery so we decided to substitute onion instead.

This was quite good, but it was very good after I switched the sweet pickle relish with dill pickles and added some prepared mustard. Also, I used coriander instead of parsley, which gave it an unusual flavor.

I finely chopped some dill pickle chips instead of sweet pickle relish.  I used 2 12oz. cans of tuna instead of the 3 cans.  I used 4 chopped hard boiled  eggs.  I probably used about ½ cup Mayo, I eye balled it. I added a few dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce® and a pinch of salt and sugar and pepper.  To make it look pretty I topped it with sliced hard boiled egg and paprika.  :-)
