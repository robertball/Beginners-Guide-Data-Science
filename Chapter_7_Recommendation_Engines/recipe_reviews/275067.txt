Made as written and this was super simple and turned out good. This would be great to make for the Holidays when your oven is tied up with other things. The recipe did not specify to peel the potatoes so I left the skin on but I think most would prefer them peeled.

What a cheesy delight. This recipe is so easy to put together and potatoes are rich and creamy.
