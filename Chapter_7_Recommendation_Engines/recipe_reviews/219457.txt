This was really tasty! I added a little mozzerella in the dip as well as topping it with it and it was so delicious! Served it with low fat sour cream and salsa like Charleston's Restaurant and everyone loved it! Definitely couldn't taste the difference!

This was amazing and several people asked for the recipe.  I doubled it, and it turned out fine.  Only had Parmesan, so I didn't use Romano.  Used a large garlic clove and a few dashes of hot sauce to taste.  Had carrots, plain pita chips and crostini that I made from a baguette.  I could see eating this on a bagel!  This really is good!!

Made this for my family and it was a big hit. Even when they were full they kept going back for more. Will definitely make it again.
