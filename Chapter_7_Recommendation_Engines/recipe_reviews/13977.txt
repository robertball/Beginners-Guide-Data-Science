Excellent recipe!!!

With some fine-tuning -- as per the suggestion of 2 earlier reviews, I used less lemon juice and lemon zest than suggested here.  I also, since I thought the number of serving sizes (4) was too small for my purpose, and had a 12 point something ounce package of silken tofu, made 50% more by multiplying all the cake ingredients besides the crust, the topping, or the lemon zest and juice by 1.5 times the amount listed. Almost all of it still fit in the 8 inch glass pie pan I used and it made bigger servings.   I did NOT increase the amount of lemon zest or lemon juice, however.  I kept the lemon zest the same (1 Tbsp.) and actually LOWERED the lemon juice to juice of ONE lemon.

My 1.5x version made about 8 or 9 servings though, so I think the regular recipe really makes about 6. I also added the vegan all-natural Earth Balance margarine substitute to the crust, but still had problems with it -- there was two much of it, and it held together, but could have been more solid.  Also it needed more flavor IMO -- I plan to experiment with other pie crusts.  

Given all the changes I'm making, why am I still giving it five stars?  Because the texture and basic flavor alone are worth at least five stars -- this recipe came out INCREDIBLY cheesecake-like, and was the most authentic tasting and feeling vegan cheesecake I've had.  I think AllRecipes should list it in the regular cheescake files too -- most meat eaters would love it.  It's a little less heavy th

This is an exceptional cheesecake recipe...it is SO good!!  Quite delectable--the texture is so smooth and creamy, and the flavor is divine--pure cheesecake decadence!  The only difference I noticed compared to non-vegan cheesecake is that this one is rich but not too rich--it doesn't sit really heavy in your tummy, which is a good thing! My friend is vegan, and I made it for her birthday party--I got tons of compliments, even from the non-vegans.  I tripled the recipe, and it fit perfectly in my 9-inch springform pan.  I used only 1 lemon and added 1.5T vanilla -- baked for 30 min @ 350 deg., reduced heat to 325, and baked for approx. another hour, until the internal temperature of the cheesecake was 165 degrees.  Turned off the oven and left it in there with the door closed for another hour, and then chilled it for 4 hours (1 hr of that was in the freezer since I was short on time).  Finished it off with a homemade blueberry topping--it looked beautiful and was eaten in less than 5 minutes!!  THANK YOU for this WONDERFUL recipe:)

This recipe would surprise even the most die-hard non-vegans.  Yummy and light.

Recipe calls for too much lemon juice.  I used the juice of one lemon and even that was too much.  Next time I will use the juice of one half of a lemon.

I found it very difficult to get the crust into the pie pan.  It was too sticky -- stuck to my hands rather than the pie tin.  Eventually, I tried greasing my hands with a little vegetable oil and that helped.  Next time I may use margarine instead of maple syrup.

Otherwise it was a great dessert, and I will definitely make it again!

I am an avid cheesecake fan, and I found this recipe to be just as good, if not better than the real thing!  I made this recipe because my mother-in-law is allergic to dairy and I wanted to surprise her with sweet goodness for Christmas.  Everyone loved it and didn't even know that it wasn't the real thing.  The only thing that I did different was eliminate the lemon all together and added 2 tbsp of Vanilla instead!  I am going to make this instead of real cheesecake from now on!

This was just amazing! I had my doubts at first and thought I would give it a shot. The crust held beautifully together and so did the 'cheese'. My parents loved it and even had seconds swearing that it tasted just like real cheesecake! It's not as heavy and rich as real cheesecake and so you can always have a second slice, or third...

Thank you *sooo* much!!! I have finally found a **great** tasting vegan cheezecake!!! Yeeeaaaahhhh!!! **smile** Please do try this, it is awesome and everyone I served it to loved it. Absolutely yummy! I would make a couple suggestions though (personal pref.)... Cut down on the lemon rind and juice a bit or it will be too tangy (though the flavor does mellow out the next day), instead of the cherry filling I made a blueberry sauce, and I also used a traditional graham cracker crust (I used a vegan margarine if anyone is wondering).

This was a fabulous cheesecake, and I will be making it again in the near future. It certainly is a healthier version than the typical, "dairy" cheesecake. However,I have to disagree with EMAZURAK--this is not a vegan cheesecake since the recipe uses white confectioners sugar. Make no mistake though, this cheesecake was delicious! I also recommend using fresh cherries if they are available. (Serving w/o the canned cherries on top was still very tasty as well.)

Although the flavor was pretty good, this didn't really turn out that well.  I may try it again, although If I do I'll use a muffin pan to make individual portions.

This tastes like cheese cake! It is awesome! I only used juice from one lemon, and a half TBS of zest. It still had a slight lemon flavor, I think it would be really good with chocolate on it.

I loved this!  I had extra blocks of Nasoya extra firm tofu on hand and wanted to try something new.  I made my pie in a pre-made pie-crust and left out the lemon aspect all together.  I combined it with the chocolate tofu dream pie (a pudding pie) recipe on the site and made it chocolate cherry cheesecake.  It was simple, I just added some baking coacoa into the mix (about 1/2 - 1/3 cup).  I also used fat-free cream cheese since having dairy wasn't a problem for me.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I was skeptical at first, but I will definitely make it again.  Even thinking of a gluten-free version for my sister!

I used less of the lemon juice and added butter extract. Also used fat free cream cheese and made the crust with 2 C graham crackers and 1/4 c butter. I made a sauce out of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries for the topping. No one knew it was made with tofu. Delicious.

I gave this a 5* even though I didn't care for the crust, because the filling is great (just like cheesecake) and my husband liked it! (he hates tofu).  I used Azumaya Firm Tofu and Tofutti imitation cream cheese and it cut great.  Also used Tofu Sour Cream instead of soy milk, only 1 Tb lemon juice and skipped the rind.  Will definitely make again, but with another crust (this one was soggy).

I love this recipe!  I'm the only vegan in my family and everyone who tasted this thought it was great.  Two people said the texture was slightly different, but I didn't notice any change(if anything it was for the better).  If you don't like using the white confectioners sugar fine ground beet sugar would probably do the trick.

This is a fabulous "cheese" cake.  My family loved it. The texture is really great.  I served it to company without saying it was tofu and it was a big hit. I served it without the cherries.

This was phenomenal!!  I can't have eggs and this is a fantastic egg free cheesecake recipe.  It was very easy and even my family members who can have regular cheesecake liked it.  I just used a store bought crust.

I had extremely high hopes for this "cheesecake", and I wasn't disappointed! I used 2 tablespoons of vanilla, instead of the lemon. Also, I used whole wheat crust instead of making my own. Next time I will try making my own crust, since the whole wheat crust didn't really fit in with the "cheesecake". The best tofu to use is Firm Tofu. It set nicely, and was easy to slice. I will definitely make this again, but try a pumpkin "cheesecake" instead.

My oldest son is allergic to egg and milk, so I am always looking for recipes the whole family will enjoy.  This was a wonderful cheesecake.  My husband loved it, and we were actually shocked that it taste so good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is cool!  Since other people thought it was too lemony, i used the zest and juice of one lemon, and it was good.  I can still taste the tofu though.

I made this recipe last night and it was great!  After reading the other reviews I had to taste for myself, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I modified it a bit by adding 1 cup of pure pumpkin, 1.5 tsp of pumpkin spices and juicing only 1 lemon, but it was just as tasty as any pumpkin cheesecake I've ever had!  My meat-eating parents enjoyed it as well.  I will be making it again for Thanksgiving and maybe even Christmas too. Yum!

Honestly, they were right when they said, "No one will be able to tell the difference."  No one was able to tell that this was NOT "cheese" cake. I will be making this for Christmas.

WOW!! this recipe rocks!  i decided to turn it into a lemon cheesecake since most reviews seemed to agree it was a little strong on the lemon.  i made a lemonglaze from icing sugar, lemon juice and nondiary margarine.  i also made my graham crust according to the package directions.  i was so impressed with the texture and how well it all held together.  it really looks and tastes great!  i can't wait to try different flavours and toppings with this!!!

THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC!!!!  You have to try it.  It's so good, that I will never make another 'real' cheese cake.  This one seems so much better for you.  Everyone loved it, and noone even suspected the ingrediants!  I used blueberries instead of cherries, and it was just superb.

Three stars, but with direction changes, probably four or five. Used what I call a coffeecake foil pan = deep dish cake pan - so I used 3x the usual recipe for it & 2x the filling amounts for two of those pans.  No lemon, but added 4t vanilla.  I couldn't tell if the bits were cream cheese or tofu, but the flavor is still good regardless.  'Thinking if the cream cheese & tofu are whipped separately, then combined, the result would be a smooth pie.  'Glad I tried & I'll play with it later.  :)

Delicious, use margarine instead of maple syrup and reduce lemon juice to juice of 1/2 a lemon.  This cheesecake is creamier than regular cheesecake and also doesn't make you feel full and fat like regular - YUM

I tried this recipe for our vegan friend's birthday - he seldom gets to eat desserts, let alone cheesecake!  Well, everyone at the party loved it and didn't know it was dairy & egg-free.  I did add a bit of vegetable oil to the crust so it would stick together better, and I also substituted fresh strawberries simmered in jam for the topping.  I would definitely recommend anyone (especially vegans) to try it.  It's so easy to make - if it didn't turn out right, you may have used the wrong type of tofu (make sure that it's the silken kind for sauces).  The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe just so there would be enough for seconds!

I am NOT a good cook and I needed something impressive to take to my next veggie potluck, this is PERFECT!!! This cheesecake is sooo good! I did like everyone said and used less lemon, and I used firm silken tofu, it held together nicely but was a little tricky to slice so I think next time I will use X-Firm. Deffinately a keeper!

This was my first try at making non-dairy cheesecake, and I was more than a little disappointed.  I only altered the recipe slightly, making mini cheesecakes in metal cupcake cups instead of one whole cheesecake, and I also used less lemon and more vanilla.  But I was disappointed in the texture, as well as the taste.  My boyfriend, who is not LI, did not like it at all, and even though I am used to the taste of tofu and soy, I did not care for it either.  IMO it definitely left something to be desired, and was not a good substitute for the real thing.  However, I think I will try this recipe one more time, just to be sure.

never set up right, had a strange consistency and was too lemony.
