This recipe is straight forward and the final product is very impressive. I added a bit more flour to make the sauce thicker because I wanted it to be more like gravy. As suggested, I served it on garlic toast. I think it would also be fantastic with potatoes. Yet another crowd pleaser from Chef John. Thanks!

P.S. If you are the type of person who makes a recipe using so many modifications that the original is unrecognizable, you are not entitled to rate that recipe nor are you credible if you give said recipe a poor rating. There. I said it.

Superb recipe and better by far if you use Trader Joe's Organic Chicken Broth (the reg.) It's almost as good as homemade. I soak my chicken breasts beforehand in milk and marsala, about 1/2 cup wine  to 1 1/2 cups milk for 20 min. Then pat dry and I always use flour in a zip lock bag (the gallon sz) when pounding/flattening my chicken so it does not stick or fall apart. Then I use a couple of beaten eggs laced with a little more marsala before I dip into my flour seasoned flour mixture.  My chicken comes out so tender and juicy that you literally do not need a knife ever when eating my chicken.

Perfect, classic chicken marsala. This was so simple but it looked like I worked all day on it. I had two minor changes.....I added a few more mushrooms because we love them and I used bonelss skinless chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand. Thanks for a easy and delicious recipe Chef John!

Extremely good except for the fact that I had to thicken my sauce much longer than anticipated. The amount of chicken stock to add should be halved, as should the parsley amount. Other than that, excellent taste.

Awesome flavor!  We loved it!  I used a good quality Marsala so I wouldn't mess this recipe up!  I followed the recipe exactly, even plating it on a piece of toasted sourdough bread.  Next time I may cut down on the chicken stock as it was thin prior to me using a little starch and water.  Thanks Chef John!  I think it was the best thing I've ever cooked!!

We did not have any Marsala Wine but some good old North Carolina Red Sweet Muscadine Wine just hit the spot.  Great Receipe.  Also did not have any Shallots so we were forced to use Onions and Garlic.  What is not to like...Serve over rice with Broccoli or Zucchini.

I decided to make this with some homemade pasta & it tasted just like the one we get at our favorite Italian restaurant! I used 2 cups of Marsala wine and 1 to 1-1/2 cups stock, and replaced the shallot with 2 cloves minced garlic instead. I think I also used a bit more butter and flour too. This has become one of our favorite recipes!

Followed recipe to the letter.   Was very disappointed.   The sauce was not nearly thick enough, was a pale golden color and not all that flavorful.   It wasn't terrible, but definitely needs something else to make it "pop".    Kind of bland and runny.   Will look for another marsala recipe.

Great flavor but I agree with some of the other reviewers who say that 1 cup of chicken broth would suffice.  While tasty, the sauce was too thin for my taste even after simmering for quite a while.

Easy and simple as this is it is also quite easy to mess it up.  The one mistake you can make is to not reduce it enough.  When you reduce it the taste gets richer and more delicious.  If you use less liquid as some reviews have said you will get something ho hum.  You really need to reduce it quite aggressively at each stage.  

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts dredged in flour with some salt pepper and oregano.  Browned and set aside then after adding the marsala wine to the sautéed mushrooms and shallots really reduce it until it is quite thick.  Add the stock in the proportions suggested and reduce it until it is almost the consistency you want but still a bit runny.  Then I added the breasts and cooked 5 min per side.  After taking the fully cooked chicken out I further reduced the sauce until it was at the thickness I wanted.  Watch carefully it can reduce fast and burn if you are not careful.  So then the sauce is rich and full bodied, absolutely delicious.  I added the butter at the end as John suggested and wow.  Awesome.

The only thing I didn't have was shallots, wife loved it but I think there's so much missing like a garlic clove or a tomato or something, less liquid it's way too soupy for me, I'm think I'll put corn or potato starch instead of flour next time

This recipe is simply the perfect Marsala recipe. I've also used this same sauce on pork medallions and steak (filet). It's better than most Marsala sauces in any restaurant. Thank you Chef John!!

Best chicken marsala I've had in awhile! LOVE this recipe. Altered a smidge in that I used boneless chicken breasts and 1 cup chicken broth instead of 2 cups chicken stock. But it turned out great. Thanks, Chef John!!

Good, but as some others stated the sauce was too thin. I ended up adding an additional tablespoon of flour in at the end to thicken it up to a consistency I am more used to seeing for chicken Marsala. This is definitely worth a try.

Awesome dish. I make a lot of curry and am very used to thickening up sauces. You can get it nice and thick if you cook the wine and chicken broth/stock to the right point... which will take practice and a good eye and feel for what your heat is doing to the fluids of the meal.

When you add the chicken to the sauce to finish cooking it you should monitor the consistency of the sauce and change your finishing process accordingly. Do a google search and watch some videos if necessary OR just wing it like I did and learn by feel and taste.

I added a LOT more mushrooms than is listed in the recipe.

I serve the chicken marsala with brown rice (because most of my meals consist of brown rice) and a vegetable depending on how I feel: carrots, green beans, broccoli, asparagus all of which usually with some sort of garlic olive oil drizzle and Parmesan.

Chicken Marsala is one of my favorites when going out to an Italian restaurant. Chef John's recipe is spot on and my family raved about it. It does take some time for the sauce to reduce and thicken, but the time is worth it and next time I just need to build in more time up front. The sauce was excellent and I can see why he would use it on his salad. My son came over to visit and said that he wasn't hungry, however the house was filled with the aroma and he couldn't resist, and then proceeded to clean his plate. He then asked if I had called his sister and told her about it. Olive Garden has nothing on this recipe.

We all really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of  the Marsala (I know...it's chicken MARSALA!) but I didn't have any. I looked up substitutes and found that Marsala is brandy fortified white wine and an acceptable substitute is 1 cup white wine to 4 tsp. brandy. I will put Marsala on my next grocery list so I will be prepared next time!

Possibly my favourite chicken dish.  For me, the key is to ensure I take the time to let the sauce reduce to the consistency I want and the resulting great flavour  -  typically longer than is noted in the recipe.

Amazed my guests!  Fine restaurant taste and went nicely with a variety of good Napa Valley cabs.  I also needed to add more flour, but that was probably my fault because I quadrupled the recipe and had to make it in a stockpot instead of a skillet/sautee pan.  Served it with "Sarah’s Orzo Pilaf" and pan-sautéed veggies.
This may make Chef John groan, but there was tons of sauce left, and I made it into soup by adding veggies and barley mix (quite good and could be its own recipe).

Used boneless breasts but otherwise followed exactly. The two cups of broth took a little while to cook down but was not an issue when it came to thickening. So easy and tasty. A little salty but that's right in my wheelhouse.

Was truly amazing!!! My version, which I didn't alter this recipe, had significantly more sauce that I needed to cook down taking a bit more time to complete. However I don't think I would change anything. Spectacular recipe!!!

Very, very very delicious. Perfect sweet to salty ratio and tender chicken. I made mushroom caps with extra shrooms. The time spent cooking/prepping is well worth it. I used the ingredients with 2 large chicken breasts and it was perfect.

When I look for a recipe to make for dinner, I search CHEF JOHN first because everything I make of his is fantastic.  I can't say enough good things about his recipes and helpful hints.  I have perfected your caramel apple pie and serve it to guests who think it is divine!  This chicken marsala was delicious and used little flour, a preference I look for all the time.  So Thank You, Chef John!!!!  -- Karen Morrissey

This is excellent! Always loved chicken marsala and wanted to make it myself. Researched several recipes and picked this one. Glad I did! It is fantastic. Only change I will make next time is cut the chicken stock by half. The sauce was way too thin so I added some starch to it  as suggested by another reviewer. I highly recommend this one!

I followed the recipe as directed. The flavor was ok, but not great - a bit bland. It is very difficult to get the sauce reduced...even after cooking it for 25 min, the sauce was very runny. I would have liked a thicker consistency. This may be a good starting place for a recipe and make some tweaks for more flavor and a thicker sauce.

Great recipe but I like alot more mushrooms. I did flour the chicken before pan frying, added some minced garlic, and some capers. I liked the amount of liquids because you come up with a great sauce that we served over pasta with chicken.

Delicious. We love chicken marsala, but it is hard to find a good recipe for it! This was perfect, simple and delicious. My only change was using skinless, boneless chicken breasts rather than skin on.

We had this tonight served over wide pasta noodles...delish!  Didn't have any Marsala, so I used white wine with brandy.  Will make this one again.

Delicious! The changes I made, since other reviewers talked about thin sauce, was to use 2 TBSP flour, 1/2 c. Sherry, and 1 c. water mixed with 2 tsp Organic Chicken Bullion Concentrate. My family doesn't like mushrooms, so we left those off too. :)

Perfect and simple. And the bonus is that it is a much lighter dish than you may think. Served with fettuccine and a nice salad.

I made this last night and everyone raved how good it was without me having to ask. Watch the video for tricks how to make it better. I used both breasts and leg quarters and the leg quarters tasted better in my opinion. Sooo simple to make. Defiantly going to be a weekly family favorite. mmmm....

So GOOD! can't stop tasting the sauce as the chicken tenderloins (8) simmer. I did add a small pinch of Cayenne in tribute to Chef John and promised husband he has a great supper on the way, as he is out side gardening-we're preparing to raise our own vegetables due to expected crop failures in California. Whenever I want a recipe I always go to Chef John first! Thank you Chef John for a wonderful recipe.

Was very good.  Next time I make this I will use less salt and a low sodium broth and add more mushrooms, but will certainly make this again.

I am a huge Chef John fan, but this fell a little short for me. The chicken ended up being a bit tough and somewhat bland. Maybe I picked a bad chicken, or did something wrong, but it failed to impress. Nevertheless, GO CHEF JOHN!!! KEEP THEM COMING!

Chef John, I've been using dozens of your recipes since before you actually used Chef John as your moniker. I've loved them all, when my wife and I want to make something we always say, let's see if Chef John has something before looking anywhere else! This recipe is fantastic, the balance of flavor and the depth of the sauce is out of this world! We loved the story as well! We knew you must have worked kitchens, too much knowledge to suggest otherwise. Not to say someone at home can't obtain the "tricks of the trade" by following someone such as yourself. We never buy store bought sauce anymore, thanks to your Sunday sauce recipe. And there is no restaurant that has a better lasagna than your recipe, I don't even bother ordering that out anymore. And... by superstition and suggestion I always use a wooden spoon and spatula for those sauces! Hahaha! Thanks for all you share!

I'll give it four stars because I love Chef John.  But I haven't tried it yet because from my point of view, Veal Marsala must be made with a cream sauce.  And though off-topic, let me just say, Chicken Kiev is made with tarragon butter, not parsley butter.  Please, Chef John, could you please elevate your dishes please?

Made it following the recipe other than cooked cubed chicken breast with no flour and corn starch to thicken, then served it over gluten free pasta! Super yummy! I will be making this again! .

Goodness Gracious!  This was the best Chicken Marsala ever!  I tripled the mushrooms, added some basil and used corn starch instead of the flour.  It took a little longer for it to reduce but it was soooo worth the wait!  Thanks Chef John for another keeper!

The best chicken marsala recipe on Allrecipes. Stuck with the amounts given and reduce liquids to thicken. it might require a bit extra heat and less time in each stage of Browning veggies to allow for a lengthy cook time in the broth. But if you follow this recipe as directed, your end result will be the perfect balance of mushroom to marsala to fat ratio. Just perfect.

This Recipe was incredibly flavorful!!
We made it for a large party and used boneless-skinless chicken breast.  It took a bit to bring the reduction to a good consistency, but was well worth it !! 

We also used non-stick pans as well.  It turned out Amazing!!!

All the guest commented on how much they loved the recipe !!!   We will definitely be making this again!

Omg the best! Don’t get upset, with my review...I substituted chicken with bone in pork chops and m husband devoured them. He actually picked up the bone and cleaned it out f all meat. I followed the directions to a T only changing the meat. We make this recipe often!

Overall very happy with the result. Holding back 1 star only because I think it needs far more mushrooms than the recipe calls for.

As far as technique I made this exactly as directed. I only had boneless skinless breasts and garlic in place of shallots. The only thing I would change is the amount of time to simmer down sauce. After 5 minutes Marsala was reduced but 2 cups of chicken stock took SIGNIFICANTLY longer. Overall finished meal was delicious!

Very tasty. I  will use less chicken broth next time, maybe 1 cup instead of 2. I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves. Sauteed the mushrooms first, then took them out of the plan. Then sauteed the chicken tenders till nearly done. Removed them from the pan, kept them warm. Returned mushrooms to the pan, made the sauce as directed. Once thickened, added back the chicken for the last several minutes.

Very good as is, but I made the following changes: reduced broth to 1 cup (still made enough sauce for 4 breasts so I'll feeeze half for another day), used skinless breasts, and it felt like it was lacking something.... I will add a splash of sherry next time to brighten up the flavor.  I served over brown rice with a simple salad.

I've made this before using a different recipe and without masala wine. NO COMPARISON!!!!
This is one of the best dishes I've ever made. I used onions and garlic because I've never used shallots. Will try with shallots next time. Wow, this was so good. It doesn't even need chicken.

Are use chicken thighs instead of the breast and it turned out really good. The only thing I can say is that it may be had too much broth it was too watery. And I let it cook down a lot. Next time there’s chicken broth

Very yummy, even my husband who does not like mushroom ate all of his. The only thing I did extra was add a little bit of lemon juice. I felt as though it needed a little more acidity.

I made this dish last minute.  Because I didn't have all the items listed I substituted the chicken broth for 2 bouillon cubes and for the shallots I used onion finely diced.     I layered this over buttered noodles.   It was a hit and will definitely  be making this again.

I've made this several times.  Every time it has been a hit.  This is definitely a dish where patience pays off.  Taking the time to reduce the liquids properly and develop the flavors is rewarded with rich restaurant quality sauce.
I've made this in both stainless and non-stick pans.  If you have a choice, use stainless.  I found that the non-stick doesn't create sucs.  The sucs have a noticeable benefit to the finished flavor of the sauce.  That said, my family liked the dish either way.

Made this dish for dinner tonight and it was great.  The recipe was easy to follow.  You have to have patience and let the wine and stock reduce, otherwise it will be too thin. Great dish, the whole family enjoyed it.

This received amazing reviews in my house.  I made some small modifications because I didn't have a shallot.  Sauteed sweet yellow onion first and added chopped green onions with mushrooms.  Also took the other reviewers advice and reduced to one cup of stock.

My fault, the chicken was not as tender as I would have like, the sauce did not have a strong Marsala taste. I’ll try again.

This is fabulous. I had never had chicken marsala before let alone made it myself so I watched the video over and over again before gathering all the ingredients and taking a whack at it and serving it to my husband and myself. Success! The second time I made it we served a couple of visiting family members  from out of state. Result? Smiles all around! Thank you Chef John for sharing this very special recipe!

Quick and easy, impressive main course.
I had company coming and not a lot of time to prepare, this dish served with boiled baby potatoes tossed in a little butter and garlic and glazed carrots was a perfect fit.
My chicken breasts were skinless and very meaty so I chose to split them in half making them thinner.  This also sped up the cooking process. 
I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and oregano.
I added a clove of minced garlic to the mushrooms - just because!
I only had 3/4 cup of  Marsala so only used 1 cup of chicken stock.  As I was serving this with potatoesi wouldn’t need so much sauce, this worked out perfectly.  However even though I had about half the amount of liquid the sauce was still very thin, so I mixed up a little extra flour slurry to thicken the sauce.
I also tossed in a cup of chopped parsley to finish.

Very tasty and impressed my friends, will defiantly make again.

Really good Marsala!  Served mine over Fettuccini.  Also if you don't have Marsala on hand, you can use any good, dry white wine and had 1 tsp. Of Brandy per 1 C. of wine for the same taste.

This was very tasty, and I found it to be restaurant quality.  I followed the recipe exactly. It was a little time consuming though. My hubby loved it, and I will definitely be making this again. Next time I will add more flour to make it thicker. I will also add way more mushrooms, as they cooked down too much and we like them.
6-25-19... I  made this again using 8oz of mushrooms and a tad more flour.  It was perfect.

Way too much sauce! I agree that one cup of broth is plenty.
I ended up boiling mushrooms  trying to reduce sauce.  I think even 1/2 a cup of broth would do.

It was a very simple dish to make for your family. Not complicated at all. I ended up adding more wine than it had called for looking for a bit more flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly with one exception after reading reviews. I adjusted to only 1 cup chicken stock but I think I could have done the two bc I used 3 boneless skinless breasts, another change, and I would like to have had a little more gravy. You can adjust the thickness of your gravy by using cornstarch to your preference. I served it on thick sliced garlic bread with tri color fusilli tossed with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh Parmesan cheese. I also put some of the Parmesan on top of the chicken once on the plate. This was a huge hit at this house! Will definitely be making this meal again.

Very good but will change a few things next time. First I will serve this with mashed potatoes (noodles had to be "Captured"), I will also double the sauce, double the flour and marsala. t
Changing it from a sauce to a thicker gravy.
Very easy and quick to make. Oh and did I mention Delicious?

The only change I would make is using way less chicken stock. This would thicken up sauce. Great receipe. Easy to make.

I didn’t have chicken broth so used veggie broth instead.  Still tasted amazing!  The cold butter and parsley will take the sauce to another level so don’t skip that step!  Chef John, you magnificent genius!

The recipe is very good and very easy.  I added extra mushrooms to taste, and I used a bit more flour as I like a slightly thicker sauce.  I also added a bit of oregano as well as the parsley during the thickening stage.  Dried herbs seem to work fine if fresh aren't readily available.  This is definitely going into my rotation.

This dish is incredible. I only substituted boneless skinless breasts because that’s what was available, otherwise followed the recipe. My husband said it’s the best chicken Marsala he’s had and couldn’t stop raving. As some others have suggested, the sauce does need to reduce for much longer than the directions indicate to thicken properly and really intensify the flavors. I’d say mine sat simmering for at least 20-30 minutes. It was perfectly saucy- not quite gravy but not au jus either. Make this as soon as possible!

This is an awesome recipe! I have never had chicken marsala much less make it. I used a dry Marsala and didn't change a thing in this recipe and it's a good thing I didn't because it was perfect just the way it was. Thank you for a nice introduction to this great recipe!

I sure will make again.  I did double the recipe to feed four, but next time I won't double the gravy, maybe add half more of the liquids and make a slurry to thicken it more.  I did flatten the chicken to uniform thickness and they were fork tender.  It was a delicious meal.  Thank you Chef John for an easy, scrumptious supper for guests.

Good simple recipe. I made it tonight but I did add to the recipe. I added a lot more flour because I wanted a thicker sauce. I also used an onion in stead of a shallot because that's what I had on hand. I cooked the sauce and then combined it with the chicken in a baking dish and baked it together for 20 minutes at 450. It came out great!

Excellent recipe, no changes made except I used 1/2 cup of sweet marsala wine and 1/2 cup of dry marsala wine( I don't like savory dishes to be too sweet) . It tasted fabulous. This is a keeper. I always trust Chef John to steer me right on the classics.

Followed the recipe.  All was good until I added the two cups of chicken stock.  As mentioned in other reviews, this was way too much.  Washed out all the marsala flavor.  If I make this again there will be a few tweeks.

Yummy dinner for special friends!  I used thinly sliced pieces of chicken so it cooked faster but flavor was wonderful.  I served it over fettuccine  with a side of zucchini. I'll definitely make this again!

I realized halfway through that other reviews were correct in saying that the sauce is thin so I ended up making another mini-roux (with another tbsp or so each of butter and flour) and using some of the liquid from the already-cooking pot to make a thick base and then added it into the existing sauce. That thickened it up really well. We agreed that it was restaurant quality! Absolutely excellent!! I’m going to try it with steak next, a la Carabba’s.

This was sooo yummy!!!  I served it over rotini pasta and I’ve also served it over rice both were great!  
I added extra mushrooms (doubled the recipe amount) because my family loves mushrooms. 
I highly recommend this marsala dish. 
I’ve made it several times, I couldn’t get marsala wine so I used Riesling and it worked great.

This is our favorite masala recipe. I double the amount of mushrooms, but that's the only change.  I serve over a bed of capellini pasta. There is enough sauce to compliment pasta that is cooked al dente & tossed with olive oil & salt & pepper.

This is the simplest Marsala recipe that I have ever seen and it came out amazing.  I tripled it for 8 of us (not quite on the broth) and it was absolutely delicious.  Constantly amazed at Chef John's recipes.

This recipe turned out pretty good!  It wasn't very labor intensive, which was nice.  Just very time-consuming.  I served it on a bed of steamed brown rice (the Uncle Ben's microwave one) and my husband ate his entire plate.  We'll probably make this again in the future.

I made this last night and it was incredible!  Time consuming but well worth it -- I did add an extra tablespoon of flour at the end because I felt the sauce was too thin, even after it reduced down, but it was just  awesome.  My first attempt at Chicken Marsala (my favorite to order at a restaurant) and served it over linguini (what we had - but next time Its going over fettucini)..

OH MY! I've used other marsala recipes and this one is for sure my favorite - I did pound my boneless/skinless breasts first, then I dredged them in a flour mixture before cooking stovetop.  I also subbed green onion & garlic for a shallot, just b/c I didn't have one. Also I used corn starch to thicken the sauce & had no problem getting it thick. My family loved & will make again.

Even if you don't use this recipe you MUST try the tip that Chef John gives at the end of the video about the toasted bread - it has changed my "foodie life" (smile).  I took it a step further and after toasting the chunk of bread I put it right in the pan for a dunk and then put the chicken on top with additional sauce.  All through dinner we kept going to the stove to soak more bread.  I kid you not my husband and were like little kids pouting when the bread ran out.  It was SO good.
My changes:
I cut the liquids in half and my sauce was perfect.  (I also roll that last cube of cold butter in flour before adding.)
We enjoyed this a lot and will be making again.  And of course using that bread trick on just about everything with a sauce, lol.

Delicious! I did double the sauce ingredients (butter, olive oil, flour, marsala and broth), as my husband likes it "saucy". Also, I used a whole package of sliced button mushrooms. Will definitely make again!!

This is a great recipe, very good as is, however I added a bit of worstershire sauce and some capers. Served it over mashed potatoes... was excellent..

No changes, but sauce was too thin.  Maybe I didn't let it cook down enough.  Flavorful, and chicken was moist.  I preferred the skinless, boneless breast to the skin on, boned one.

This was the most delicious Marsala I’ve ever had! Followed the recipe exact... just used skinless breasts because that was all that was available.  SO good!

We love this recipe!  I flatten my skinless breast and use extra mushrooms. I I serve over spaghetti or linguini.

I loved how easy and clear the recipe was to follow.  The taste was outstanding and the chicken so tender.  Agree with less chicken stock but, even though a bit thin, it did not stop us from  loving the flavor.  I will definitely make this again and again!!

I make this for special occasions and it has ruined my family's ability to eat it anywhere else. It never tastes this good at ANY restaurant. This is the dish I'm known for cooking by anyone I've fed it to.

I normally prefer using shallots when called for, but onions didn't overpower this recipe. When I'm cooking I always remember I wish I'd used less chicken stock so it would be done sooner, but I think reducing that much chicken stock is part of why we like the flavor.

Follow the recipe exactly and it turned out like soup. I had to adjust to 4 people and don’t know if that is what went wrong. It was really a disappointment.

More mushrooms! Cook off the wine a bit and don’t add all the chicken broth at one time. The sauce may become too thin.

It was really good! My family and I loved it very much. The only reason I didn’t do 5 stars is because the sauce wasn’t as sweet as I was hoping for. I ate Chicken Marsala at a restaurant and the sauce was a smidge sweeter. Maybe more Marsala wine will help? I’m really not sure.

This was delicious! Certainly on my "make-it-again" menu. I hate when people review a recipe and tell about all the changes they made but I made three out of necessity. I wanted to use up mushrooms I had but I didn't have fresh parsley (used dried), green onions instead of shallots and subbed cabernet sauvignon for Marsala so I guess I made Chicken Cabernet. No problem, great results. The sauce was wonderful.

This was absolutely delicious, as we have found many Chef John’s recipes to be.  We did add more mushrooms, but it is the sauce which brings the flavor to this dish.  Will definitely make again (and again.)

This recipe was amazing and kid-approved by a 9 and 10yo!  I added a bit more flour to thicken the sauce and I didn’t have shallots on hand but it was prefect without them.  Served with a side of mashed potatoes.

Made this a week or so ago, and it was absolutely amazing! My husband is the cook, usually, but not this time. He is a foodie at heart and said it was, “better than mine”. It was the best compliment he’s ever given me on my cooking. I actually cried! Thank you Chef John for such an amazing recipe! It’s definitely a keeper!!

Tastes good but I had same trouble as some other reviewers, sauce refused to thicken.  I think next time I make it I will reduce the amount of chicken broth I use substantially.  Still tasted good tho!  I’ll try it again.

As everyone else said, the sauce is rather thin. Next time I will not use so much chicken broth. My husband really liked it, and that is the true test, because he eats chicken Marsala at every restaurant at least once.

I followed this recipe to the latter except for the fresh herbs, I ran out.  Delicious. I over cooked and over salted the chicken at bit but that error was strictly on my end and easily remedied the next, and there will be a next, time I make this. Leftovers are awesome as well!

I love chicken Marsala. This sauce was way too thin. Try adding more flour and maybe less broth. Flavor was ok but nothing special. I served with a wedge of lemon because I often think it cuts the sweetness of the Marsala.

So delicious and really easy! I did not change anything. I just followed along with his video. I served each chicken breast on a piece of toasted French bread.  To make it easier to manage and get more sauce on the chicken, next time I will slice the chicken breast before placing it on the bread.  This is the first time Chicken Marsala has turned out right for me...and I have tried several times!

The leftovers, though:
That was too much chicken for me, so I saved about half of one chicken breast (sliced) in some of the sauce. I had bought a loaf of French bread at the bakery and had most of it left too. The next day, I sauteed more mushrooms in butter and olive oil (because we ate them all). Then I added the leftover sauce and reduced it a little more. Next, I added the chicken slices and reheated them. I sliced the French bread lengthwise, brushed it with olive oil, and toasted it under the broiler. I put the bottom half of the French bread back under the broiler, topped with the Chicken Marsala, a slice of Swiss cheese, and a little sweet onion. (Watch carefully so you don't burn your delicious lunch!) Once the cheese was melted, I added lettuce for some crunch and the top half of the french bread and had a delicious sandwich. I will probably make extra Chicken Marsala next time to ensure I have leftovers. :) So good!

Loved it! Tasty, simple to prepare! Served with sautéed green beans and roasted peppers. (May have over peppered the chicken a bit-but it did provide good amount of spicey!)

I followed the recipe with few changes.  I used 1/2 marsala and 1/2 chicken stock.  It was ok, but not great.  I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Delicious! I reduced the chicken broth and added some heavy cream at the very end, to die for! Just a touch is all it takes. Great served with jasmine rice and a green salad. Perfect!!

WOW!  This recipe is the best for flavor, texture,  and every other yummy thing!  I followed the recipe closely but didn't have shallots so used a small yellow onion, diced and put it in the pan with the mushrooms (I used about 1 & 1/2 cups of white button mushrooms, sliced, as we love mushrooms and the flavor they add to a dish).  I had skinless, boneless chicken breasts so I pounded then to an even 1/2 inch or so, salted and peppered them and then put them in a Ziplock bag with flour,  a bit more salt & pepper before putting them into the hot butter & Olive oil to cook.  This made them brown to golden very nicely!    I used FICI Superiore Dry Marsala for this savory dish and it was absolutely lip-smacking delicious!  Served over Bow Ties & Rotini pasta noodles for easier eating (than linguine, etc.)  and only added butter, salt & pepper and a light sprinkle of garlic powder to the pasta and then ladled the Marsala mushroom sauce over it and the chicken breast on top with more mushrooms & this most delicious sauce to top it all off!   This is definitely a dish I will add to our rotation!  Loved it!  Thank you Chef John!  I have loved all of your recipes that I have had the pleasure to try!

I did love this dish. I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful! I even plated it up on a slice of toasted bread.  I had made two loaves of cheddar bread the same day and used that. Magnifico!

I decided to try this recipe because I grew tired of the same old chicken dishes.
 I did follow the recipe exactly, and it came out moist and tender, wonderful flavor,
 I use very little salt, so it tasted 'salty' to me, but my sons both raved. Maybe it's me, but next time I'll probably cut back on the salt and let people season to taste.

Great recipe!  I've been looking for one just like this.  I have been using another Marsala recipe for 30 years, but this is much better.  I didn't have broth so I dissolved 2 boullion cubes in 1/2 cup of water-this was enough liquid.  I mixed my flour with a little cold water as my first sprinkles did not dissolve.  My sauce was lightly thick but just right in my opinion.  Great job Chef John.  You never disappoint!  Kate

Great recipe. I used boneless, skinned chicken breaststroke and pounded them to about 3/8", floured and browned.  The sauce is ver nice- only thing I would change is more mushrooms next time. The whole family enjoyed this meal. Very nice served with mashed potatoes.

This is my new favorite chicken dish to make.  This blew away any chicken marsala I ever had in any restaurant.  The sauce was just silky, savory and gorgeous.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and I loved the slice of french bread underneath the chicken to soak up the flavors.  Just wonderful!!  I'll be making this again and again.

I followed the recipe and made double the sauce.  It was very good, but sauce was too thin for my taste.. and I added an extra table spoon of flour and it still came out thin. I suppose the thickness is a personal preference, but overall the taste was amazing.  I will make it again, it was a nice easy recipe.

This simply, easy Chicken Marsala was off the hook!  Note:  I used chicken breast fillets,  1 1/2 cups of chicken broth.  Was totally amazing.  Served it along-side with baby green beans and fingerling potatoes.  Yummy!

My husband and I really liked this. I do agree with the other reviews that the sauce was way too thin. I had to add a tablespoon or two more flour in the end to thicken it up.  Also, you have to really crisp up and brown the chicken skin or it is very soggy when it cooks in the sauce after returning it to the pan.  I think next time I'll use skinless. Very easy to follow and delicious!

Delicious! I added more mushrooms ('cause we like them) and used only 1 cup of the broth. The sauce was enough to cover 4 chicken breasts halves.  When I make this again, I will use 2 tbsp of flour instead of one as the sauce was still too thin.  Thank you for a wonderful dish.

The sauce was way to thin but when I cooked it down it was a beautiful consistency.  Next time I'll only use 1 cup of chicken broth.  Also more mushrooms with a few shitakes added in.  Although a traditional marsala doesn't call for garlic, I usually put one clove in mine.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  The best part is that there is plenty of gravy for the chicken and to top mashed potatoes or for leftovers.  The chicken was tender and tasty.  This recipe will become part of our regular meal rotation.

I LOVE this recipe!!  Having read reviews prior to making it myself, I did cut back to one cup of chicken stock and I used slice baby portabella mushrooms as I prefer either those or Crimini over white.  Outside of that, I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  The chicken was moist and the sauce absolutely out of this world!!  I served this with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and was in absolute flavor heaven!!  This will be a do again recipe for sure!!

Made and it came out great. Added a few more mushrooms and used chicken tenders. Also took awhile for the sauce to thicken so added some cornstarch. We served with garlic mashed potatoes and carrots which was great but would probably serve it with pasta next time.

I used one pound of chicken tenders.  I only had about 2/3 cup of wine and I reduced the chicken broth to 1 1/3 cup. I didn't add the butter at the end.  I would make this again.   I made fried rice to serve with this.

This was awesome!  It was quick, easy, and delicious.  We used an entire carton of button mushrooms instead of just 5 mushrooms and used a green onion stalk since we didn't have shallots.  We'll make this again for sure.

Chef John, thanks so much for sharing this recipe. Like you, this is one of the first recipes I learned to make from the new owners of the same restaurant I owned! Being 21 at the time with 2 kids I was so happy to have learned so much from them and they looked to me like family. I will forever be greatful to have them in my life. The Chicken Marsala is my favorite, but it's been years since I've made it. I recall butterfly the chicken breast in olive oil,set aside,minced garlic sautéed with cubed mushrooms with O.oil n butter ....?! Chex stock and Marsala to deglaze the pan and reduce, return chicken near end of reduction. My question is, would the chicken breast have had flour? I don't recall that it had!

This was a real hit! I didn't have shallots so I used a bit of onion and garlic instead.  That was the only substitution I made. Also, I used gluten free flour, and it all turned out great!

Thank you Chef John for another great recipe. I used boneless chicken breasts which was the only that I change that I made to your recipe. My husband gave it 5 stars!

The only changes I made were due to time and my own failure.  I didn't have a shallot and decided not to add the onion just because I was running really behind.  The mistake I made was not reducing the Marsala before adding the chicken broth.  The sauce reduced eventually and was extremely tasty.  Overall the dish was excellent and I can only imagine how much better it would have  been when made correctly.

Sometimes you have to say "diet be dammed" when you make a meal as good as this. I used skinless chicken breasts, pounded down, and 1 3/4 c of Marsala, 1/4 c of cooking sherry and followed the recipe besides that. Exceptional!!!! Hubby thought the sauce was a bit strong w pasta, so I recommend maybe mashed potatoes, or don't pour sauce over pasta. But I loved it!

I tried 2 different recipes for chicken marsala but this one was definitely the winner! I did use boneless skinless breasts as that was what I had and I did dredge them in flour first. No other changes. My husband and I both loved it. I was great left over too!

Simple and delicious! The only changes I made was I used skinless chicken breast and when seasoning the chicken breast I used salt pepper and also dried oregano and dredged them in flour to really lock in the moisture. Will definitely make this again!

The tenderness and consistency were excellent.  The only thing I didn't like is the inclusion of chicken broth.  For me, that watered down the taste of the Marsala too much and it tasted more like any other chicken dish.  Double the marsala, instead of broth and this is excellent!  I also added tarragon, because I love it, and red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.  Not too much.

Delicious recipe. I would make it all over again...tonight!  If you don't have Marsala wine; just Google Marsala substitutes.  There are a couple   We used  1/2 cup of Sweet Vermouth and and half cup Sherry and it was a really nice recipe.

Superb as always.  Another Chef John recipe added to the go to list.  It does make a thinner sauce which I thickened up with a few more minutes and some corn starch.  The chicken I had done sous vide earlier so the recipe was even easier.  Just sear in butter and make the sauce.  A real winner.  Thank you as always Chef John.

Phenominal!!!  I made this recipe almost to the letter.  The only change I made was using a regular red wine.  Such. Simple recipe.  My girlfriend and I loved it.  I'm sure we'll be making this at least twice a month, if not more.

This was a wonderful recipe! I haven't made Marsala in a long time and was looking for a nice recipe to prepare for guests. My cooking skills are fine, as long as I have a recipe. I followed this to a tee! I used boneless chicken breasts and the only thing I would have done differently was to pound the chicken flat first. It was a huge success at my dinner party and  I will make it again!

One of the better recipes I've tried for Chicken Marsala. I used dry Marsala wine and used more wine, less broth. This is probably my favorite Chicken Marsala recipe so far. Easy to make and tastes pretty authentic.

I made this tonight for dinner.  It's a great recipe as is. I did make some changes.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I used 8 oz. of sliced baby portabella mushrooms and sauteed them together with finely chopped onions.  I also added roasted garlic.  I used Florio Marsala dry wine.

I made this last night for dinner. The only thing I did was triple the recipe I have a big family. Everyone loved it even myself and I'm not a chicken person. Delicious I'm definately gonna be making it again. Thank you soo much chef John for sharing this recipe.???

This dish was very tasty. I will recommend adding 1-2 additional tablespoons of floor if a thicker sauce is what you're looking for. Also, adding a bit more Marsala wine if you want more of a Marsha taste verses a chicken taste. Overall, I will for sure make this dish again :)

I will definitely make this again.  I doubled the recipe for four portions and it turned out fine.  The Marsala wine was a little pricey.

I made sure to pound my chicken.  I also finished cooking it in the oven because i didn't have a big enough frying pan.  I made 4 x's the recipe because i wanted a lot of left overs.  I ended up eating it 4 times during the week and loved it every time!

This is one of the best versions of this dish that I and my husband have ever eaten.  And very easy to make as well.  I substituted olive oil for all but the last tablespoon of butter (which was used only to add gloss to the sauce) and it was wonderful.  I already had a very good recipe for this dish, but this is now my go-to version.

Loved it.  Went totally by the recipe except doubled the mushrooms ( I just love mushrooms!!) and butterflied and pounded out the chicken breasts.  I love to cook for friends joining me in the kitchen and this was a easy to execute recipe to do.   It's a keeper!!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers  and didn't add any of the chicken stock.  This was absolutely delicious! I also added garlic and used skinless chicken. Yum!!!

Had to add more flour to thicken up but if you have patience, it will get there. Removed chicken before adding parsley and butter in order to thicken the sauce and not overcook the chicken. Really nice flavor.
Try cutting broth by half.

I have made this multiple times and the only thing I change is to actually add a little more Marsala and thicken the sauce.  We like the amount of sauce because I serve it over angel hair pasta sometime, or, mashed potatoes.  It is quick and delicious!

It was good...but the sauce wasn't thick enough and I added extra flour and I think next time I will make the sauce half chicken stock and half marsala.  I served it over a bed of sauteed spinach.

Awesome! Couldn't wait to try this recipe again. This time I used Chicken thighs. Since this piece of meat has more fat, I reduced the Olive Oil to 1 Tbsp or less.

This was awesome!  added a photo too.  Now we don't have a gas stove so it seemed to take MUCH longer to cook down the liquid at the end but it turned out wonderful!  We also used it as the warm salad dressing you suggested, Chef John, in the video.  We also made the slow cooked green beans.

Chicken Marsala has always been intimidating to me, but your recipe was easy to follow.

Very tasty! As others have mentioned, there is a lot of thin sauce, so I added some corn starch to thicken a bit. Next time I will use less liquid, but overall, excellent flavor and a keeper as a recipe!

Delicious really!! I did add spinach replace the scallion with onion and freen onions.   I didn't have the Marsala so I used Pinot noir and a bit of balsamic glaze.  This is definitely a redo!!!

Very tasty recipe that's very easy to follow. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because it is VERY watery. I had to add a lot of corn starch, at least 2 tbsp and it still was very loose.

This is a very, very good dish! My family was blown away, so needless to say this one's going in the books! As for changes, I just about tripled the mushrooms and I also let the sauce reduce for more time than was called for.  Overall, excellent.

Turned out great, though I agree with halving the stock. Also, I recommend hammering the chicken nice and flat before cooking as this makes it more tender, and it cooks faster so adjust times accordingly. More mushrooms never hurts.

Very easy recipe except I used 1 lb. of all white boneless chicken tenders.  The recipe served. 4 people.  I placed the chicken over a cup of mashed potatoes. Very delicious.  Guests loved it too.

I really like this recipes,  it is simple.  I have made recipe from the culinary institute ad there are so many  steps.  I would egg and flour my chicken before sauteing in oil cook out the marsala to reduce a bit,and use beef base. instead of chicken. Everything else is awesome!

I have made this several times and I love it! The only change I made was to add a little flour to thicken the sauce, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

We were very disappointed. The chicken stock overpowered the dish and the taste and sweetness of the marsala wine.

I usually stick to backing but I decided to make this dish for Mother's Day, and my mom loved it! (Same with my family and I) It did take a while for the sauce to reduce but it was worth it! The sauce was beautifully thick and flavorful, and the chicken was seasoned amazing and was tender!

I did take some feedback from other reviewers and reduced the sauce.  But it was still more liquid than I wanted. I added more flour to thicken it up. It's a good recipe but it's not my "holy grail" marsala I am searching for.

Delicious.  Sorry for all the substitutions but saved a trip to the grocery store.  Used 3 small cans of mushrooms (didn't have any fresh mushrooms).  Used fresh onion and garlic to substitute for shallots.  Used boneless, skinless chicken breast because that's what I had in the freezer. I think boneless with skin chicken breasts would be a special order from the meat department in our town of 12,000.   Or cut out the bone yourself.  Chianti for the wine. (Husband convinced me there is no marsala wine.  Marsala is part of Sicily  so used a red wine he had already.)  Added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed in cold water for additional thickening,  Served over mashed potatoes.   Tasted great to my husband, our grown daughter and me.

Definitely the best chicken marsala I've ever had!  I just didn't have any shallots to put in, and I put a lot of mushrooms in it, and it was absolutely fantastic!

I followed this recipe all the way. The chicken came out tender and juicy and the sauce was amazing. I had steamed potatoes on the side with garlic toast. My husband thought I spent all day on the meal. The time on making this recipe is very accurate unless you are new to marsala. I will absolutely make this recipe again.

Will certainly make again! The only changes I made were to add more mushrooms and use boneless, skinless chicken breasts as that was what I had. I did use a heaping spoon of flour which made my sauce perfect.

GOOD. I liked this. It's not my favorite however. I followed the
directions exactly , except using only one cup of chicken broth.
After reading reviews I made that choice. Next time I will use more broth. My sauce was not runny and turned out well,
but I think I could have used a touch more served over rice.
I think this turned out. Just not my favorite.

I did it strictly as the recipe was written, and the sauce was still a little loose. However, the bread idea on bottom was great. I used a slice of Brioche (toasted first), and it really made it great. I will make this again, but reduce the sauce after I add the broth a bit more.

It is one of my new favorite dishes!  I can understand why Chef John likes it so much.  The chicken is as tender as I have ever tasted and the sauce is perfectly balanced.  I did make one addition to mine, since my garden sage is now producing, I added a few sage leaves - nice touch.  I plan to make this again soon.  Thanks.

I am fast becoming a Chef John fan.  The few recipes I've tried are all awesome!  I didn't have marsala when making this so I substituted another wine.  It was still amazing.  I did add more mushrooms because I love them so much, but other than those two alterations,  I made it exactly as directed and it's perfect.  A super yummy worknight meal that looks like a restaurant meal!

Really good ... I put half the broth in for the gravy and thickened it with corn starch/wine. I also used twice the mushrooms.

Great easy recipe. Rather then keeping the breast whole I cut it into bite size pieces, but the end result is the same. Very good and impressive recipe for entertaining!

I used 6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, sliced length wise  to make cutlets.  Doubled other ingredients and prepared in 2 12" skillets as directed. I found sauce a little thin, but pretty tasty- I would use less chicken broth by 1/4.  I would make again with my small change.

I have always been intimidated by Chicken Marsala, but this was an easy to follow, clear recipe with delicious results.  I forgot about the suggestions to reduce the amount of stock put in, and because of that I ended up thickening the sauce myself because it was taking waaaaay too long.  I'm sure it would have been even tastier if I had given it enough time to reduce properly, but it was really good anyway.   I would also thin the breasts, just to reduce cooking time.  I had some rather thick ones and it took forever to cook them. I ended up cooking them partially in the main skillet, enough to get all the good bits stuck to the bottom, and finishing them in another while I prepared the sauce.  What resulted was an absolutely delicious sauce that we all couldn't get enough of. Yum!  You can always add more mushrooms, but I found one package of the pre sliced mushrooms at the store was enough (and I love mushrooms).

It's good.  It took almost 15 reducing for me on high. I woulsuggest you thin the breast to maybe a inch or less.  Just to get more flavor into them.  I did not do this and found the thickest part have very little flavor.   Pretty easy and tasty overall.  It's a keeper for me.

Make sure you buy imported marsala wine, from a liquor store. If you want the real taste.

I had never made chicken marsala before so I was excited to cook this dish as I am a big fan of Chef Jon's. The only change I made was I used boneless and skinless chicken breasts and it turned out beautifully. My dinner guests really enjoyed it. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts.

This had really great flavor. I doubled the mushrooms and recommend getting thin slices chicken or slicing them in half. I also soaked the chicken in milk and Marsala wine per someone else's recommendation.

Gourmet flavor without much effort.  I  dredged the chicken breasts in flour along with the spices before frying. I cut the broth to 1 1/2 cups since i like a thick sauce. I couldn't get Marsala wine, so I used 3/4 cup sweet red wine and 1/4 cup amaretto liqueur. This supper was a big hit.

We loved this!  Follow others advice and use garlic and good Marsala. Added a bit of sherry too.  I used the fresh refrigerated fettuccini and a pound and a half of boneless skinless breasts and the sauce to pasta ratio was perfect

I used dry Marsala.  Added small amounts of thyme and oregano to give this dish the taste of a similar dish at a popular chain restauranI stirred a little cornstarch into the chicken broth before heating, it helps with thickening.  Just FYI ~ and much thanks for a lovely looking recipe.  (c:

This recipe was much better than similar dishes I've had at restaurants and it was totally due to the sauce. I followed to the letter even down to the timing except that my chicken was skin-free. I admit to feeling guilty about the amount of butter but I would not change a thing. It was flat out AWESOME. You got this one Chef John!!

3 cloves garlic and one medium yellow onion as a substitute for scallions and a generous glass of Chardonnay for the chef. Next tome some crunchy green beans steamed just right.

This was very delicious and satisfying.  I served it with mashed potatoes and the sauce poured over the chicken and potatoes.  The only changes I made were to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and I didn't have shallots, so finely chopped up a small onion.

Made it last night.  Per other reviews, used about 3/4 cup less chicken broth, more mushrooms, skinless boneless chicken breasts, and some garlic.  Used a very good Marsala wine.   Flavor was amazing, my husband and I both liked it a lot.  I would probably use crimini mushrooms next time, and maybe a few shitakes.

Good base recipe but needs something.  I increased the amount of marsala and decreased the amount of broth. I also felt that WAY more mushrooms were needed. I probably quadrupled the amount and still felt that it could use more.  I also used thighs instead of breasts but that wouldn't impact my review.  Still using my tweaked version of recipe and still trying to find the right ratio of marsala to broth.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. We almost licked the plate. I added more mushrooms and pounded the chicken for a thinner breast. I also only had vegetable stock so I used that instead. So yummy. Served with spaghetti and asparagus.

I made this dish as a treat for my wife.  The dish reminds me of the French dishes my mom made when I was young.  We did have to make a wine replacement.  We didn't have any Marsala wine and our Cabernet had gone bad, so we used what we had; a semi-sweet white wine.  Even with that potentially disastrous replacement, the dish turned out fabulous.  It was lighter in color, but still had the wonderful wine accent.  I also replaced the white mushrooms with Crimini (baby Portabella mushrooms).  It gave the dish a more hearty mushroom flavor.  I definitely recommend giving that replacement a try.

Yummy!  I've made this twice now.  The first time just as called for in the recipe, except I added 8oz of mushrooms, because we love 'em.  We thought it was DELICIOUS, but runny - more like a broth.  The liquid created by the extra mushrooms could certainly have contributed to the runny consistency.  It seemed like all was going to be great - the sauce was thick and bubbly - until I added the 2 cups of chicken broth.  I simmered an extra long time, but didn't get it to thicken up as much as I expected it to turn out.

The second time I made it, I cut the broth in half and doubled the flour.  This turned out nice.  Still lots of sauce, but more substance to the sauce.  This is definitely going into the rotation!

Update:  This is truly a staple at our house.  I've experimented with making 3-4 meals' worth at once.   I cut the chicken into cubes to facilitate re-heating.  I freeze meal-sized portions in  freezer bags that I can re-heat on the stove for a quick weeknight meal, or throw the whole sealed bag into a pot of boiling water for easy, delicious meals on backcountry trips (like multi-day river trips).  No clean-up is the best!

Made this recipe using good quality Marsala wine.  Agree with other reviews regarding the amount of chicken stock. I just thickened myself.  Will use a little bit less next time. Dish was still delicious !!

I didn't have marsala wine or shallots so substituted with onions and sherry.  Also added a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar.  Sauce was delicious!  I served it over boiled potatoes.  Mashed would have worked well too.

I hate Chicken Marsala; in fact, I hate the taste of wine, so that has everything to do with it. Still, it's one of my BF's favorite dishes. It being his birthday, I made this for him as he wasn't in the spirit of going out to eat.

He LOVED this. One of the best Chicken Marsala dishes he's ever had, he said. I've been with the man for 12 years now and I can confirm he orders this dish at restaurants at least four times a year. So this is high praise coming from a man who is quick to add improvement suggestions for anything I make. No problems with this one so, five stars. One change I made: I reduced the stock by one-half cup as many here have suggested.

Served with rice pilaf and roasted brussels sprouts, two of BF's favorite side dishes.

Thank you, Chef John!

Sauce was too thin; too much broth.  Maybe the Marsala cooking wine was a bad choice but it is what I had on hand.  The next time, I will tweet it my way.

Family loved it, me too! I had to use cornstarch & water slurry to thicken because I overlooked the flour step, my fault. Came out perfect anyway.

This was a great recipe! I give it 5 stars but 4 stars from my husband just because he doesn't love wine in food. Would make it again, and I'm sure it would be a hit with company. Served with basil parmesan orzo. For my family (2 adults), 6 sgs = 4-5 individual meals.

I thought I had tried every chicken Marsala recipe on this site....then I found this one.  This was simple and delicious, and a great pick if you like lots of sauce.  My only concern is the sauce, no way three cups of liquid reduces much in 7 minutes, even over high heat.  So if you want a thicker sauce, reduce the liquid amounts or plan to stand in front of the stove for awhile.  I served over pasta to soak up all of that goodness.  Hubs loved this, and Marsala is his favorite dish, so that's saying a lot.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, CJ!

Excellent chicken dish!  I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breast halves, accidentally used 2 cups wine that I had on hand so I decreased the chicken stock to 1 cup.  let simmer to thicken.  it was divine!  served with a 20 minute cook and serve box of risotto and a quick tossed salad. my husband raved how great it was.  will add to my regular rotation of chicken dishes. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!

HAVE TO AGREE WITH PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT THE SAUCE WAS TOO THIN. I USED 1/2 CUP LESS CHICKEN BROTH AND BROTH INSTEAD OF STOCK. IT WAS STILL DELICIOUS, JUST PREFER THICKER SAUCE. I SERVED IT BY ITSELF WITH A SIDE OF CASHEW ASPARAGUS.

BUT follow the video and recipe the tee. I did use boneless skinless chicken breasts and though I was so good I could double the recipe first time I made it. DON'T do it just like Chef John says with the two chicken pieces. ALSO add the flour a little bit at a time. Makes a better sauce. The third time I made this I finally made it right. And it was outstanding! Thanks Chef John!

I made this last night for dinner and it was excellent! I did use boneless thighs instead of breasts, so the cook time was a bit less for me. I also had to thicken the sauce a little more then called for with a little more flour. If you havnt made this yet, you should. It was very easy and delicious.

Super new to cooking at home. My wife and I are tired of throwing money away eating out all of the time. I was looking for something new to make. This recipe looked so delicious. Now, I have very little to no cooking experience. I was able to get this done no problem. Used skinless chicken breast and garlic instead of shallots. Looking forward to trying other recipes!!

This is the first time I've made chicken Marsala. It was delicious. I couldn't find regular Marsala wine, but I did find the Marsala cooking wine.

Love Chef John's recipes. This one didn't go over so well. Sauce is way too runny.  Consider less stock and add more flour. Be sure to get a dry Marsala

Went to a friends house and cooked them this chicken dinner. It was a grand success. Now I'm invited back to a house I never want to return. Thanks chef John.

Simple, restaurant quality, recipe.  My wife and I love this.  I replaced the white mushrooms with baby Portobello mushrooms and used more than the recipe called for.

I thought the amount of chicken broth was too much.  I ate it in a soup bowl.  Updated: With leftovers I took time to reduce the sauce more and it was very good.  The recipe doesn't explain to turn up the heat and how much to reduce the sauce it just says, "slightly reduced".  After looking at the video I realized the sauce really has to be reduced. Thanks for recipe.

I had to turn the Marsala/chicken broth into a thin gravy which was drizzled over the mushroom/leek topping. Absolutely Wonderful!

Made this for a dinner party. Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  We added more mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe.  A keeper!

Very easy and very tasty! My supermarket didn't have shallots, so I used a yellow onion, cut very finely. I used dry marsala wine, I tried a bit before pouring it, and it was quite strong! I was concerned about serving the meal to my kids, but after I reduced the sauce, the alcohol burned off.

This was so yummy and easy to make. I do not like chicken breast, so I used boneless chicken thighs. The flavors of this recipe left my mouth wanting more. Did not change anything.

This is my husband's favorite recipe! We like the chicken cut into chunks and breaded in flour, salt & pepper before cooking. This is a relatively easy dish that looks like you spent all day!

Very good recipe. I added twice as many mushrooms, since my family loves them. I also used a nice quality dry Marasala which made a difference in the taste as well. Thanks Chef John!
