Had a bounty of carrots and zucchini this year, so I decided to grate equal amounts of them and freeze  in meal size packages using my sealer.  Just used the first package, put them for several hours in a colander to lose moisture, then  proceeded with recipe and they are wonderful!  Roommate had 2 helpings!!

I don't get why you would add salt to dry out veggies then rinse with water! And if you are going to squeeze out moisture use paper towel because the carrot juice will stain your towel! All that aside they were yummy but   a bit saltier than I like. I will make again.

Excellent! My carrot was ginormous and my zucchini was wimpy so if I had to guess I'd say I had about a 50/50 ratio. We don't love zucchini and we sure don't love cooked carrots but we loved this. Hubs dipped his in ranch dressing but later admitted it really wan't necessary. Our motto in this house is "brown food is good food" so I cooked them a little longer on each side. Personal preference is all. Excellent recipe and the perfect way to incorporate some fresh veggies in your meal. 5 stars all the way! Thanks for sharing Beth S.

I made some changes, so take this with a grain of salt. I upped the carrot so that the carrot/zucchini ratio was 50/50. I used 1 tsp salt on the zucchini/carrots prior to squeezing them out. I used GF bread crumbs instead of flour, and quite a bit more than called for. I also added a second egg. I love veggie patties, so I've tried a lot of recipes. My family usually is usually meh about them, but the family loved this one.
