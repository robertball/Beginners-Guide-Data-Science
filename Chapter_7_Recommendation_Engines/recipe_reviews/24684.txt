OMG! I have never had cabbage rolls cooked in sauerkraut.  I used my regular recipe which is very simular to this one with the exception that I add, diced peppers and a heaping tablespoon of horseradish to the filling.  This gives it a nice little nip.  I noticed that everyone cooks their cabbage.  You dont need to do that.  When you buy your cabbage make sure its clean then put it in a clean bag and tie it up and put in freezer for a few days.  The night before you are going to make your rolls, take cabbage out of freezer, leave in bag and put in deep dish.  It will thaw over night and the leaves will just fall off.  I use to hate making rolls because having to cook the cabbage.  Now I love making them even more.  Hope this helps everyone out.

You can freeze the head of cabbage and as it thaws the leaves easily peel away, but I like to cut the core out and place the whole head into boiling water and one by one the leaves boil off, this makes it pliable to roll, and you will not have to use toothpicks to secure them. (Cut the thick stem out for better rolling)  I also think if it's par-boiled it de-gases the cabbage.  Do add a good quality 1-2 TSP of Hungarian Paprika to this, and 2 cloves of fresh garlic as well. I place them seam side down  & I cover the rolls with tomato sauce then sauerkraut and instead of the water for the Cabbage Rolls to simmer in I use tomato juice.  Ready in 2 hours! Serve with a dollop of sour cream!Excellent.

I halved this recipe & only used ground beef, no sausage.  I also cooked it in the crock pot.  I put the sauerkraut in the pot first then layered the cabbage rolls on top.  I poured a can of tomato sauce on top & added a little water.  I cooked it on high for a couple hours, then turned it to low for about six more hours.  It turned out great.  I served it with mashed potatoes & we poured the sauce from the cabbage rolls over the potatoes.  This is one of those comfort food recipes.  Very good.

This is a great recipe! I have enjoyed a very similar recipe for as long as I can remember. We have this as an added dish every year at Thanksgiving. Most recipes call for you to cook the rolls in a tomato base. There is nothing like cooking them in saurkraut. I mean think about it, saurkraut is made from cabbage, they are a natural compliment. It is wonderful re-heated. They freeze really well.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago on a Sunday.  The only things I did differently was use tomato sauce and cook the cabbage rolls in a slow cooker for about 6 hours.  They turned out EXCELLENT and tasted EXACTLY like the ones my dear grandmother used to make (who passed on before handing down the recipe).  Thanks so much for this one - it was perfect!

My mom used to make these growing up and I hated the cabbage. This was my first attempt at making them and they turned out pretty good.  I scaled this recipe to 6 servings and used ground turkey in place of the ground sausage.  In place of the water I covered my cabbage rolls with a large can of tomato sauce and baked in the oven on 350 for 2 hours.

I have tried several cabbage roll recipes – all using tomato sauce, and we have never been quite impressed, which is odd as we all like all the ingredients. So this recipe was our last try at the cabbage rolls and it was a hit! My husband and my 5 & 6 year old boys ate them up; they were also enjoyed the next day for lunch. We have made these twice now and are making them tonight. (Edit) after making this again, I followed the recipe as stated, not so good, we threw them out. I realized too late, I went through most of the reviews the first time before making. Going forward I will (as I did the first few times according to my notes) par cook the rice and season the beef with garlic and Hungarian paprika. Then will cook in a casserole dish with beef broth (NOT water) at 325 for 3+ hours, or cook them in the Crock pot with less broth or just the juice from the sauerkraut if there is enough, on low for 6 hours. Made this way I would give 5 stars, but after following the recipe exactly I am knocking it down to 3

I have never made my own cabbage rolls before and these tasted just like I imagined them to taste.  I used only ground beef because I did not have the other.  It still turned out great.  I had some trouble with the cabbage leaves and would suggest to freeze the head of cabbage first as other people suggested.

Reading all the reviews before trying this for an annual Oktoberfest party, I modified the recipe and added 1 heaping T minced garlic, 1 T horseradish, and 2 tsp Hungarian paprika to the meat mixture. I also cooked the rice almost through using beef broth and let cool before adding to meat mixture, and used 1 c tomato sauce instead of water in the meat mixture.  I used a large covered casserole dish to make this, layering sauerkraut, then the cabbage rolls, then sauerkraut, and then poured enough spicy V-8 juice over the top of the rolls until almost covered.  I then covered the dish and baked at 300 deg for 4 hours.  Absolutely fantastic (very flavorful!) and lots of compliments at the party! Will definitely make again!  
NOTE:  I didn't trust myself not tearing many of the leaves, so I used 2 heads of cabbage , cut out the core and boiled the heads.  Leaves separated nicely.

My grandmother always made these for New Year's. she only used fresh unseasoned pork sausage, 1/4 cup rice per pound of meat, and no onions. then she would make little logs using 1/4 cup meat, (pigs as she called them) and then roll them in a sour head blanket(cabbage soaked in a brine). she layered sauerkraut, sliced onion, then a layer of pigs.  Layering them til all the pigs were in the electric roaster pan, cover them with additional sauerkraut and cook them all day long on 325 degrees. then just before midnight we all had a plate of pigs and kraut over mashed potatoes.

Great recipe!  I took the core out of the cabbage and boiled the whole cabbage and the leaves came off without ripping.  I did ground beef and ground pork.  I put half in the crockpot and half in the oven and preferred the crock pot cabbage rolls better.  I will for sure be making them again!

Great recipe! I make mine with sauerkraut, as well but in the meat mixture I add 2 pounds gr. beef, 1 pound gr. pork, and 1 pound gr. ham. Change the rice to 1 1/2 cups and add garlic salt to taste. Layer rolls with kraut in a 10 qt. soup kettle, mix 8 oz. can tomato sauce with enough water to cover the rolls. Simmer on stove for at least 2 hours. We call these Sarmas. Yum!

Love the saukraut in this recipe! Used rice that was almost cooked and topped it off with a Italian sausage, onion and green pepper, tomato pasta sauce. Also used homemade vegetable broth instead of water and savoy cabbage instead of regular cabbage. Delicious!

Delicious!  I will be making this again and again.  The only recommendation I have is to soften the cabbage before trying to take the leaves off the head.  Otherwise they break.  I put it in the microwave, in a bowl of shallow water.  Approx. 2 minutes per 2 leaves removed.

These are an old family favourite! However when my family makes these we make a large roaster full.... even better cold the next day! I do have a few suggestions ..... DO NOT boil your cabbage, freeze the heads for a couple days in the freezer and then let de-thaw the leaves will be supple, also shave the stem part of the leaf. when you cook them, pour equal parts vinegar and water over the cabbage rolls about half way up and cook long and slow. A large roaster in oven at 250 for about 3 hrs. Such a treat!

Beautiful recipe! Bland as written; I added 1/2 tsp each Hungarian paprika, onion salt, and dried parsley. I also used brown rice and 2lbs extra lean ground beef, no sausage. Healthy and delicious.

This is EXACTLY the recipe my grandmother (of German decent) uses for her cabbage rolls or at least they taste exactly like the ones she makes.  Out of her 7 grandchildren, I'm the only one that eats these.  Thank you for posting! Brought me home.

I only used the beef. I sauté a finely minced garlic clove with diced onion in the pot I made the rice in, no reason to dirty another pan. I added greek seasonings and plenty of ground black pepper. I used the very large outer cabbage leaves to line the 9x13 pan and proceeded. I added the sauerkraut to the tops of the rolls and mixed a little brown sugar in with tomato sauce and baked 'em. I did freeze the whole cabbage a day prior. leaves came off perfect. I will make cabbage rolls with sauerkraut from now on. great taste and   excellent recipe!

Really great basic cabbage roll recipe! I think The filling could use a bit of tweaking & flavour-enhancement, but otherwise it was a really fabulous recipe for my first attempt at cabbage rolls!

These were so good!  As other reviewers suggested, I used beef broth instead of water for both the mix and to almost cover the rolls with.  This added tons of flavour. I loved the density of the filling with all the meat.  It's important to use the sausage or ground pork as well as the beef!

I made this today and it was fabulous even with my mistakes/customizatlon. I used 1lb ground beef and 2 cups of cooked rice I seasoned the rice with bouillion,black pepper,red pepper flakes and onion powder than cooked it til 1/2 done then mixed the rice and (here is my mistake) i cooked  the ground beef and onion. I layered a few cabbage leaves and 1/3 of my jar of saurkraut [rinsed well]. then added a small can of spagetti sauce and about 1/2 cup liquid from the saurkraut and cooked on high in my slow cooker for 2 hours then another 2 hours on low.  It was Great!!!!!!, even my kids who dont care for cabbage and loath saurkraut asked for seconds!!! I  cant wait for hubby to get home and try it.

This was my first time both making and eating cabbage rolls and they did not disappoint!  After reading other reviews, and taking my own personal tastes into account, I did tweak the recipe just a bit.  I added 1/2 teaspoon each of granulated garlic, paprika and onion powder as well as a spoonful of horseradish.  I was also worried that the rice might not cook all the way, or at least to my liking, so I par-cooked it in some beef broth first.  I didn't think I liked sauerkraut and was worried that it might have an overwhelming flavor, so I used a can of condensed tomato soup mixed with the water that I poured over the cabbage rolls.  Overall, I thought that was a really great recipe and I'd definitely make it again.

Delicious!  I do these in the crock pot.  No need to add any water to the pot, juice from sauerkraut is enough.  I do them on low for about 6 hours.

I think uncooked rice is too risky because it may not soften completely.  I semi-steam the rice in beef broth until al dente, cool, and then add to a three meat mixture.  When semi-cooked, the rice still absorbs meat juices/flavors but dies not add any undesireable textures.

My hubby loved these. I cooked them in the crock pot. Put layer of sauerkrat on bottom and top of rolls added about 1/4 c water and cooked on low 7-8 hours. Served with mashed potatoes.

Delicious! I did substitute the sauerkraut for a large can of tomato soup because I was afraid my kids wouldn't eat it otherwise. Turned out very good and my kids really liked it! Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe!  Finally one without tomato sauce!!  To add more flavour to the filling I included 2 tablespoons of paprika and an egg.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't alter the recipe and it was a big hit. My six-year old son also liked it. Now, that's high praise! I actually didn't like sauerkraut until I tried this recipe - and that is not an exaggeration. My husband loves sauerkraut, so now we have a sauerkraut dish we can enjoy together.

I have made these this way for 30 yrs. I use a recipe from my mother-in-law.  I use crumbled bacon and some diced ham instead of sausage. And I alwaysmake a whole roaster full. I bake them for 4 hrs at 300. These are my husband's favorite!

Excellent!  I also used Cookie's technique for peeling the cabbage leaves.  Plus I added paprika to the meat and tomato sauce for the final 90 minute cooking time prior to the last layer of kraut.

I have cooked Cabbage Rolls for yrs.
Usually simmered in a Large Tin Of Tomato Juice with a bit of Sauerkraut.



Also, I sometimes like to do half minced beef and minced pork.  Or Minced veal is great too. 

Great Recipe  Thanks for sharing.

I had not tried cabbage or grape leaf rolls in years and used this recipe as a refresher when I
could not find mine.   It is WONDERFUL!! Much better than I remember -- and the cabbage could have been fresher = still delicious!  Changes: I
cooked them in small aluminum "loaf" shaped pan covered with foil to save on time = no harm and 
much easier.  The stuffing is smooth: maybe to some would be bland but, of course, doctor if you must.  I will definitely make it again.

I have tried this recipe, but cooked in V8 like a review said.  Also added a few garlics.  Oh, I substituted the regular cabbage for sour head cabbage.  You can find it in the supermarket.  It is wrapped.  I also took the sauerkraut and added accordingly to the beef mixture.  Just a hint of it. It turned out pretty good!  I will make it again...and again! :)

I used the ingredients as stated but added a jalapeno and a jar of picante sauce and did what a couple of people suggested...put the sauerkraut in the bottom of a crock pot....added the cabbage rolls...had extra meat sauce left over so I added it to the top as well as a little more picante sauce...cooked on high two hours and then low 6 hours....Enough for an army!!!  Easy to freeze for yummy leftovers!!!!

This is a great recipe, very easy to make, easy clean up, and very good.
I misread the recipe and thought it called for 1/4 inch chops.  Mine had to be at least 1-1/2 inch, so I made triple the gravy.  When I realized what I did, it was too late.  Read the recipe... believe me, you won't need triple the gravy (lol).  Very good, and thanks for sharing.  I'll be making this again.

This was my first attempt at cabbage rolls.  I followed others' advice and froze the cabbage rather than boiling the leaves.  The filling was good and lends itself to tweaking if you're so inclined.  Wasnt sure how much a 'small amount of filling' meant so I just had to use trial and error. I found an ice cream scoop was about the right size.  I didnt have a pan large enough for the top of the stove so I used a covered roasting pan in the oven at 350 for 90 minutes then took the lid off and let it continue to bake another 30 minutes.  My husband and I liked it but the kids hated it.

This recipe is REALLY good!  A great alternative to the tomato sauce recipes.  I made it for my in-laws and they loved it.  I will add a few more spices to the filling next time to give it a little more flavour, but this is a GREAT basic recipe and really easy to make!  Thank you for sharing!

The sauerkraut is what makes this so good. I used ground pork in place of the sausage and also added green peppers, shredded carrots, and chopped celery, also spicy V8. Thaks for the idea of sauerkraut.

These were so delicious. I would love to make them again soon. They are great re-heated too!! I loved the sauerkraut on them as opposed to pasta sauce (how I've always had them in the past). My husband loved them too. I had some meat/rice filling left over and made a meatloaf with it (adding a little spaghetti sauce and sauerkraut to the loaf).

This is very close to our recipe, but we cover with tomato sauce. We mix half the amount of sauekraut (well-drained) into the ground beef mixture. People who have told me they hate sauerkraut have eaten these and loved them. I have frozen the head of cabbage, or omit the sauerkraut and use sour cabbage to wrap the rolls instead. I like them using seasoned salt and lemon pepper.

I loved this recipe but only after I made a few changes. I used brown rice instead of white and added extra garlic salt.Then I could not get my head around the no tomato sauce.So I made a tomato soup in case my kids did not like this . Basically I took a can campbells tomato soup and added a cup of milk and a generous pat of butter and 1/2 tsp of garlic and and tsp of italian seasonings with salt and and pepper to taste. And then simmered soup on the stove.When the cabbage rolls were done my kids said ehh . But after we poured the tomato soup with a piece of american cheese melted in the soup over the rolls they loved it. Then we took the leftover rolls and saurkraut and soup put them in a bowl it made in excellent soup the next day.

A very good recipe! I used others' suggestions for the tomato sauce and juice, garlic cloves, paprika, and freezing the cabbage (a very good idea, by the way). I also decided to add diced portabella mushrooms to the meat, and instead of the white rice, I used a brown/wild rice mix, which I cooked for 15-20 min in low-sodium chicken broth. All in all, VERY delicious! My only regret is that I didn't have sauerkraut on hand. Next time, I'll try it!

Really Really Good!
I had a hard time separating the cabbage leaves, so I just put the meat mixture over the cabbage, covered it with tomato sauce and diced tomatoes ..... and actually ...... I seasoned the meat with garlic pepper ........... it was awesome!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. My husband loved it. I had some problem peeling the cabbage without breaking the leaves. However I saw one of the reviews(from "Cookies")  and next time will definitely be much easier.

My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed the meat portion.  I hate - repeat HATE - sauerkraut, so I chose to cook this in tomato soup instead (two cans condensed, mixed with enough water to cover all of the rolls).  I'm not sure if I cooked the cabbage too long or not long enough, but we were kind of unimpressed with it.  It was sort of slimy and tough at the same time... I don't know what happened there.  I'd like to figure out this one issue though, because other than that, we both loved this!

We make a similar recipe for the holidays but add 1 tsp of red petter to the meat and rice. We let it sit in the fridge for a day in the krout and then freeze.  We reheat by frying in butter.

These rolls were pretty tasty. I made them for an octoberfest party and everyone seemed to like them. I added a little fresh dill to give it a little more flavor. I had a little trouble getting the inner leaves off in one piece. I will try to freeze them next time like someone else suggested.

My husbands Grandmother and Aunt made something very similar. But added about 1 1/2 cups Apple Cider Vinegar to the water. Then cooled. Fry in butter low and slow browning them.  Or cool, wrap individually in waxed paper and freeze. And yes serve with sour cream and perogies. Heaven!

Whole family really enjoyed this!  They are not sauer kraut fans, so we skipped that piece.  I, personally, would probably add some garlic next time. But I'm a garlic addict.

My husband and I both love cabbage and cabbage rolls, but usually find them bland and not with enough cabbage flavor.  These were darned good!  I made a half recipe, and I still made about 10 rolls.  I also added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and upped the onions just a bit.  I do think that doubling the sauce is a good idea.  There was not quite enough to have a good sized spoonful with each roll.  This recipe is definitely going into my "keeper" notebook.

I used the ingredients as listed, but made this into a lazy man's cabbage roll casserole, just for time's sake, as there is no way I could prep this in the time stated :P . Cook meat and onions in a pan, then add to a large roasting pan along with the cabbage which was chopped up, the rice, and the saurkraut, and mix well. Cooked covered in a 350F oven for 90 minutes. Stirred it at the 60 minute mark just to make sure all the rice was cooked evenly. Really yummy. We are big saurkraut fans though, so I think next time, I would add more, as it was, I just added a scoop of saurkraut to my serving on my plate.

Delicious! I used beef broth instead of water and added minced garlic, finely diced celery, dry french onion soup mix, and an egg to the meat mixture for flavor. Perfect.

This turned out great! I needed a recipe that didn't use tomato. My husband grew up on cabbage rolls and he admitted he was worried when I told him there were no tomatoes. After dinner he told me he didn't miss them at all! Will be making this again.

This was one of three meals that I cooked in one day and turned out to be one of my favorites.  I followed the recipe closely, except that I only used 1/2 a can of sauerkraut (I wasn't sure how it would taste) and seasoned the meat with Italian Seasoning. YUMMY!!  I also poured a can of spaghetti sauce, sprinkled Parmesan cheese and backed for over an hour.  My only mistake was not coring the cabbage and maybe taking them out of the oven prematurely.  Next time, I will core and boil the leaves longer and will bake for about 2 hours or more.

These are the cabbage rolls I grew up eating. Grandma always used ground beef and ground pork, she also added some chopped garlic and a spoonful of Hungarian paprika and didn't bother with the toothpicks.  I don't know why everyone wants to add tomato sauce to them. Cabbage rolls cooked in tomato sauce are good but try them with just the sour kraut. I cook them in the crock pot (grandma would have loved that)or bake them in the oven at 325 for about 2 hours.  They also freeze really well.

This was really good, family enjoyed it.  However, I did add garlic and paprika to the stuffing and also added tomato sauce to the liquid when boiling the rolls. I also pre-boiled the rice in chicken stock just in case that did not cook like another reviewer indicated.  Overall, delicious - have left overs which will be frozen for another day.

Really liked the simplicity of this recipe, yet it lends itself to various additions.  I added a bunch of chopped cilantro, used chicken stock, 1 cup spicy Mexican tomato sauce, 2 cups reg tomato sauce to cover each layer.  Delish!

Delicious! I added some garlic and paprika to the meat mixture as other reviewers suggested. I only had red cabbage, which was much more difficult to work with and didn't roll as nicely, but it tasted great once it was all done! The red cabbage made it pink - a beautiful side dish with mashed potatoes and bratworst. I served it to my Dutch boyfriend and his family and it passed the test!

I have always loved cabbage rolls and didn't know how awesome they could be without the tomato sauce, of which I was never terribly fond. These were amazing! I will cut the recipe in half, though, as we were eating them for weeks afterwards! I basically followed the recipe exactly. My fussy, cabbage-hating boyfriend loved them, as did my Polish-German grandmother, who is very particular about her cabbage rolls. I will be making these again!

bf made this the other night.  I don't  like cabbage rolls so I didn't try them. He said the only thing he didn't like was putting in the rice uncooked--he said he'd "I never liked that when my grandmother did it so I should've known".  He used tomato sauce instead of saurkraut; I don't know why he didn't although I don't think we had any in the house and I think he's used to cabbage rolls with tomato sauce.  Thanks for the recipe--used up some of our cabbage!

I did as another reviewer recommended and cooked in tomato juice and added tomato sauce, but I still found this recipe to be bland.

Meat mixture was very good.  The rice wouldn't cook.  I'm not sure why after 2 plus baking it wouldn't cook.  Next time I think I will cook rice first.

I don't like cabbage rolls with the tomato flavor so I was happy to find this recipe.  This was my first time making cabbage rolls but they came out great. The only thing I did different was to use ground turkey.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks.

My family loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was use a german hamburger/pork blend from our local meat market.  It has spices in it and it MADE the cabbage rolls.  This recipe will certainly be a keeper!!

Not bad. A little bland. If you add in some of the sauerkraut juices and some hot sauce before cooking----wammo! flavor!
