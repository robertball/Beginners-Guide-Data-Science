I used a frozen banana, so it was VERY thick...I had to thin the consistency with a fair amount of milk.  Used plain Greek yogurt, added some vanilla, tasted, and added a bit more cinnamon, as well.  Garnished with a little dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Pretty good, and I like the way this one breaks down nutritionally.

I like another reviewer did used pumpkin pie spice for the spices. I wanted mine a little sweeter so added mango.  This was amazing! Definitely going to be a regular for me.

I used plain yogurt and it was quite bitter; so I added some honey and it was fine.  Also, I didn't feel that this made enough for one, let alone two; so I'd double the recipe. :)

This was a nice different idea for a smoothie. I used frozen yogurt and frozen banana, so I left out the ice and included about 1/3 cup of milk. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed. This was for my daughter's breakfast, so I also added a packet of Carnation instant breakfast drink, and I think it really needed that extra sweetness. It made a nice breakfast for her, and it really was only one serving, not two.

When I made this I didn't have a banana so I used apples and added apple cider to thin it out. I also added vanilla extract and some extra cinnamon to add some extra flavor. Then added whipped cream on top and then cinnamon sugar on that. Over all an amazing smoothie. I loved it

This smoothie is just the right thickness by itself. So don't worry if you think it is going to be really liquidy . I used plain Greek yogurt and it was a little sour so I added a little sugar. Over all it is a pretty good smoothie.
