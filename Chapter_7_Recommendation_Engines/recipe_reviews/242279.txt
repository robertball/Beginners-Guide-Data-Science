These were delicious. I had to use whatever beans I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe. Indeed spicy, but for us it was enjoyed as is. Thank you for the recipe.

Love this! I subbed in shredded chicken and it's been a fantastic lunch for me to take to work. Reheats well in a microwave (that's tough to find!).

I made this for my wifeâ€™s take to work lunches. I found it to be fairly easy and highly customizable. 

For instance I omitted the beans and replaced them with frozen peas. I also cut the water by half. 

Wife enjoyed them very much and it keeps quite well.

This is CHILI! It's a good chili, but very saucy for a wrap filling. I had to drain off some sauce to get a thick enough consistency to put on a lettuce leaf.
Next time I'll present it as what it is: chili!

Great recipe for something a little different.  I used ground chicken instead of beef, and used a can of small white beans, and half a can of black beans.  That was plenty of beans for our taste.  I made the filling the day before and reheated.  I used bib lettuce for the wraps.  It's certainly a recipe that anyone can adapt to their family's tastes.  Will definitely make again!
