I added some hot Italian sausage to the tomato basil sauce and some chopped green chilies to the onion, garlic, spinach, tomato mixture, everything else I follow exactly.  (except I turned the oven to broil for the last minute.
It was delicious!

Very delicious! I used cottage cheese and frozen spinach instead since at hand and I also added some salt and white pepper to the tomato-spinach mixture! Easy to make and perfect for a leftover lunch the next day! Thanks for sharing!

Tasty dish.  Even the 15month old loved it.
Prep time is maybe 20 min if you are an expert cook or have someone helping you cut up stuff... took me more like 40.  All fresh ingredients from the local farmers market probably helped the flavor! :)
MUST drain the spinach well and make sure the tomatoes don't make the spinach part too runny.  Else you have to cook much longer in the oven to get the fluids off.   My first attempt here was really runny so I had to slow cook for almost 1 extra hour to get rid of the moisture.
Other than the prep and work on the runny stuff the flavor was fantastic and leftovers will be well enjoyed!

This recipe was wonderful.  The only thing different I did was add fresh mushrooms, and extra fresh garlic as I did not have garlic powder.  Since I had two eggplants I also tried the Eggplant Parmagian II on this site (eggplant is baked rather than fried.)  This recipe was the same concept but 100 times better.  I did use part fresh and part skim (regular) mozzarella, with the parmesan and ricotta.  There was some liquid at the bottom of the dish from the fresh vegetables.  So, if anybody has any ideas about dealing with that, I would appreciate it.

I am in love with this recipe! I did add a spicy fresh chorizo sausage to the spinach mix. I also substituted diced can tomato with green chilies for the fresh tomatoes (be sure to drain). I didn't have ricotta cheese so I just added pepper jack as the third cheese. This recipe ROCKED!

I'd never had eggplant before when I decided to use this recipe. It was great! People who don't like veggies can add more cheesey goodness to the top. Next time, I won't cook the spinach, because I like more green in my food.

This turned into a really yummy, healthy meal!  Without much experience with eggplant, it was really helpful to know it's done when easily pierced with a fork.

Delicious. This is first time I have cooked eggplant.  Recipe is easy to follow and to prepare.  Did not use garlic due to garlic allergy. Also diabetic, so 14.8 grams carbs per servicing is great. I used Irrresistibles Tomato and Basil Sauce. Thank you Julie3333 for this great recipe.

made it a few nights ago using my parents' garden vegetables, my dad's home made ricotta and mom's home made sauce. 
EVERYBODY LOVED IT!!! My GF has a gluten allergy and this was very easy to keep gluten free. 
the kids thought it was more like a lasagna than eggplant.

This was absurdly delicious. I used drained grated panela cheese in place of the ricotta and fresh sage, and it was so scrumptious I could serve it to people who think they hate eggplant.  Next time I'll add some whole-grain ziti or lasagna to the mix.    Especially considering that the last time I made eggplant it was rendered so disgusting that I had to throw out even the chicken it was cooked with, I give this five stars.

I'm surprised this got such a high rating. I was not impressed with this recipe. Ok as a side dish, but certainly wasn't hearty enough for a main dish. The flavors were dull, and everything had the same mushy texture.

My husband has always been reluctant to try a vegetarian meal; this one was a true hit since he has asked me to make it again as one of my best recipes. I made one small change in that I added about 1/4 cup of choppped fresh basil to the cheese mixture before putting it over the spinach mixture. Overall, a great dish, and one I'll make often since the calorie and carbohydrate counts are also very reasonable.

Excellent dish. 5 star taste, however it came out really watery-even after I drained water after cooking the veggies and I let it sit in the oven longer. I added extra veggies (broccoli and zucchini), used frozen spinach, and extra sauce and cheese. I also added some italian seasoning to the veggies. We just happened to have some pepperoni, so I put little pieces on the top. Yum yum
