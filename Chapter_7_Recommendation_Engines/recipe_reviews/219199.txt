I gave this 4 stars because I didn't really like it, but my boyfriend loved it.  A little too creamy for my taste and I wanted the crunchy top I expect from a baked mac and cheese.  I'll probably make it again because my boyfriend was such a fan, but not my favorite

Made this with baby back ribs and there was not much taste to it.  I am not sure what was missing but it needed something.

This was a great side dish to honey mustard chicken breasts and collard greens. I even substituted with whole grain pasta and it tasted wonderful.

This turned out great for me, with a few changes. I omitted the red onion and substituted the olive oil for bacon grease. I added chopped bacon to the sauce, and topped with bacon chunks and bread crumbs as well. While this did not make it healthier, it really amped up the flavor. I also added Goya all seasoning (a sprinkle or two) to the sauce while it was thickening. Overall, this was a great base for baked mac and cheese.

This was alright but it really didn't have any taste.  I followed the recipe exactly and it also made way more than 8 servings.

Seemed like to much noodles, so thefore a bit dry.  The flavor of the sauce was really good. Next time i will cut to 3-1/2 C of elbow macaaroni and I think it will be just right.

Best mac and cheese ever! I love the flavor the mustard adds. I follow the recipe exactly and add 2 or three teaspoons of cayenne pepper.We like most things with a kick.
