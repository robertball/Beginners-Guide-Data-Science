It is comfort and I put it in my favorite cup from Allrecipes! I made no changes but did need to nuke the mug after mixing everything together.  Maybe I'll heat the milk first next time, and there WILL be a next time!  I did add whip cream on top.  Thanks nanel's mom!

Yummy! The recipe as written made enough to fill two regular coffee mugs with room to add whipped cream :) I mixed everything but the alcohols together and microwaved for 30 seconds, then added the booze and found it to be the perfect temp. Thanks for sharing your comfy recipe, Nanel's Mom!

Excellent just as written! A very good drink after a day out in the snow, or a day inside by a fire!
