These ribs were awesome! The only thing i did different was marinade them over night in 2 packages of the marinade, then basted with the sauce during cooking. They were very flavorful!!!

Husband liked these more than I did - they were a little too sweet for my taste. The mesquite flavor is delicious. I will definitely be using that seasoning blend again!

fantastic recipe!  I just used it for our 4th of july picnic.  It was a hit with 5 hungry guys.
