I'm always surprised when an old family recipe made many, many times doesn't turn out quite the way I'd expect.  I followed this recipe to the letter, didn't get much of a rise, at 20 minutes the top and cake sides were overly browned, the bottom burned, and it stuck  when I tried to get it out of the pan after sitting for 2 hours.  Putting those things aside, it tasted good.  It looked so pitiful that I sliced it, added a layer of SF lemon pudding, and topped with some sliced strawberries   Putting those things aside, it tasted good.  Just have to wonder if 425 is simply too high a temperature.  I liked the taste of this well enough that I'm going to try it again at 375 and, hopefully, eliminate the issues that I had this time.

I didn't get stiff peaks to form, although I spent 30-40 minutes trying. The cake sank while cooling and ended up only partially cooked in the middle. I didn't end up eating any so can't comment on the taste.
