Great tasting corn bread, very moist and rich. I made these as muffins and they were done in 15 minutes. I also made this recipe in a in a 9x12 baking pan and that baked for around 8 extra minutes. (see my 2 photos) It's so easy to make. The best ever!

This is a new favorite!  Talk about easy and yummy!  I did add an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  I like my corn muffins a bit sweet.  They were so moist!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for a family event and everyone loved them.  I baked them the night before in a mini muffin pan for 10 min and let cool on wire rack, then bagged them.  When everyone arrived I warmed them at 375 for 10 min, which provided a crisp outside and soft inside.  Will make again.

I cooked these for dinner last night.  They were fast, simple, with few ingredients, easy, with only one bowl and economical.  Good for when you only have a little time.  I filled the muffin cups up 2/3 and instead of 12, I got 15.

These corn muffins were surprisingly very good and not dry. I hate a dry muffin. The creamed corn added nice flavor! A definate keeper! Thanks! UPDATE: 5/17/09 - I used a cheaper canned corn this time and although they were still good, they didn't have the same taste as they do when I use a name brand, like Del Monte or Green Giant.

These are not good, they are great! I used 2tbs. white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar on hand and they were awesome! These will go perfectly with my fried chicken and southern green beans.

I love this recipe! Finally I enjoy cornbread. I knew I could like it, but I just never had cornbread I liked until this! Everything else is dry and crumbly. This is moist, has a great texture and delicious taste! I'd give it more stars if I could!

These are perfect, truly.  What creamed corn was invented for.  And exactly what I've been searching for.  These are not dry, savory corn "bread".  They are sweet, moist, simple, fast, single-serving little mouthfuls of heaven.  Perfect for a quick snack or breakfast, as well - they need no butter, no syrup... nothing.  I made 12 overful muffins cooked for 17 minutes; I think next time I'll fill them less and get a few more muffins out of it.  But this recipe is a big fat keeper.  Thank you!!

A nice corn muffin that goes well with chili.  I prefer the corn muffin recipe with one corn muffin mix and one cake mix since it is sweeter, but the rest of my family likes this recipe better since it is not as sweet.

These muffins are very moist and very 
quick to assemble. I added a dollop of
sour cream and got 15 servings.  I served these with a Cobb Salad and Peach
Soup.  Thank you!

Made as mini-muffins for a child's birthday to go with chicken chili.  Made one batch with the sugar and one without - no noticeable difference in flavor so next time I will leave out the sugar.  The recipe made 36 mini-muffins.  I baked the muffins @ 400 degrees for 11 minutes.  Everyone loved these moist corn muffins.

I made this cornbread for Thanksgiving & it was a hit!!!! I added about 1 tsp baking powder so it would rise & not be to thin. I also used the confetti style cream corn instead of the plain. It was delicious.

I was able to make 18 muffins from this recipe.  For the first 12 I followed the original recipe.  However, I desired more texture and flavor from the corn so for the last 6 I added 1/2 cup corn kernels and 2 T. melted butter.  They were absolutely wonderful after those additions.  Next time I make them I will add 1 can creamed corn, 1 can whole corn, melted butter and a dollop of sour cream for a nice zing.  Goes perfectly with sweet potato soup! :-)

Wonderful recipe.  I doubled the recipe to accommodate the 12 people at the pot luck.  I was out of buttermilk so I added a can of evaporated milk and 1 cup of 2% milk. I also used safflower oil in instead of plain vegetable. They came out great.  I brushed melted sweet cream butter mixed with honey on the tops as they came out of the oven.  The double recipe produced 18 muffins and a 8-inch pan.  They were a hit.

Love these!  Very good. Though I would make sure to watch them. Mine were only in for the 16 minutes and the bottoms overcooked.  Check around 13-15 minutes.

These corn muffins were very good and easy. I used Jiffy Corn Muffin mix and left out the brown sugar. This recipe make a lot of batter! I was worried that two boxes of mix would not fit in one muffin pan. The muffin cups were filled to the top (not the 2/3 full the recipe calls for) and all of the batter fit (barely). The muffins had a nice "muffin top" and were very yummy, gooey, sweet (the sugar was not missed) and popular. I will definitely make this again!

5 stars for easy prep, great flavor/moisture, and less guilt than some other recipes. I followed the recipe exactly and baked in a parchment-lined 9x9 for about 25-30 minutes.  They're a little crumbly, but what cornbread isn't? Bravo, Marcy! :)

I made these muffins to go with our traditional New Years dinner today and they were absolutely delicious. Very moist and just enough sweetness to add flavor to a side of collard greens.  Very yummy

Made this last night with only one change.  I took the advise of previous review and used an 8x8 pan.  Everyone loved it with my homemade apple butter!  Served it with a Slow Cooker Beef Stew.  I am forever looking for different ways to fix cornbread.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it

I made Slow Cooker Taco Soup again tonight and found two kinds of cornbread mix that I wanted to use up. You know, use what you have on hand.

I think because of the two different brands that mine might have needed more liquid because when I started stirring the cornbread dough, it looked a tad dry.
I ended up melting 1/4 c. of butter and adding that in.

Turned out great. Really quick and used ingredients I usually have on hand. And also complimented the soup well.

It was moist and yummy! I baked in a 13x9 and it was finished in 20 minutes, so make sure to check it if you cook this way.

Great recipe, I added a splash of milk. Served with venison chili to a group and everyone enjoyed the muffins. Moist and just the right amount of sweetness. Will save this, it will be my go to corn muffin from now on. Thank you!

I added 1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese. Also, after filling 2/3 of the cups,  I added 1/2 of a minced jalapeño to the batter before filling the remaining cups and marked the pepper muffins with a slice of jalapeño.  These were well recieved at a friend’s chili party.

I’ve used this recipe a few times and love it.

We made these for a crowd of 80 incarcerated men we serve with in a prison ministry. They LOVED them!! They are so moist and crispy on the outside. We're doing them again this month by popular request! Thanks for an awesome, easy, inexpensive recipe!! We found the ingredients very inexpensively at Aldi.

Great with a couple of changes. First, you have to add the milk (per the Jiffy box). Second, I always add about 1/4 cup sugar per Jiffy box.  It makes ALL the difference!  Moist and yummy!

I can't stress enough not to use a muffin tin, definitely use cups. Unfortunately, I made this for the first time when I was having company over. Even though the tins were prepped, they were still stuck and the muffins broke in half. We ate the muffin tops anyway to try and did not like them. Too dry, and not sweet enough. I guess I'm more of a store bought type ; )

Quite flavorful. I recommend a brief puree of the creamed corn, but don't overdo it or the volume increases & dilutes the flavor.

I liked these muffins. Used regular muffin pan and filled them full and it made 15 muffins.  
I used 1/2 teaspoon less salt and 1/4 cup sugar. I would let the cornmeal sit in the hot batter longer as I felt they were a little gritty. I cooked them 14 minutes and they were a little more done then I would like but any less time they didn't brown.

So simple and delicious.   I love the consistency of this muffin.   My 3 year old daughter "made" them for dinner.  I omitted the brown sugar just because I thought the mix would be sweet enough for us.   I was right, but the brown sugar might be right for some.

Good, even if you mess up and grab a can of whole kernal corn as I did and realize it after you add it to batter.  These are nice and moist, also added a dollop of sour cream to batter.  I will make again and try to add the correct can of corn.  Thanks Marcy.

Quick, easy and yummy! Kids loved them with the turkey chili recipe I used from this site. Very moist muffins.
