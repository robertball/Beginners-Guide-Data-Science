Well I inadvertently had to make some changes: thought I had apricots but I didn't, so went with cranberries instead.  Also didn't have enough pistachios so used half pecans/half pistachios.  Lastly, I thought white chocolate would go with the cranberries better than chocolate, so dipped in vanilla almond bark.  The reason I'm not giving 5* is I'm not entirely keen on the texture the cornmeal lends to the cookie.

There's nothing better than a nice, crunchy biscotti dunked into a hot cup of coffee or cappuccino, in my opinion . . . and these were delicious! I chose to swap out the dried apricots for a 4 oz. container of candied cherries, for a more festive look. I only used about 1-1/4 cups of pistachios as well, which was plenty. I find that when working with biscotti dough, after placing the dough in two mounds on your parchment lined baking sheets, sprinkling it with a bit of flour and working with well floured hands works best to form each rectangular loaf. We did dip half of some of them in the chocolate, but also left some plain (my daughter's request), and did just a chocolate drizzle with others. My favorite are the ones with just a drizzle of chocolate. Thanks ReynoldsÂ® for a great and versatile biscotti recipe!

It was good but not awesome like I was hoping.  Mine did not get crunchy...I may have underbaked it.  I was hoping for a stronger pistachio flavor and didn't quite get it.

I love biscotti. This recipe is delicious. I used tropical fruit mix instead of only dried apricots and the taste is wonderful.I didn't have any problems following the recipe, so easy! Reynolds parchment paper sheets makes the process more enjoyable as you don't have to worry about cutting the pepper to the right size and there are not dirty trays after baking. An elegant and tasty cookie perfect for the holidays.

This was my first time making Biscotti. I wish I had known how easy Biscotti is to make because now I'm hooked. You just need to remember to factor in and plan for the baking, cooling, slicing and re baking time . I really liked the end result and will make again. Next time I will use cranberries instead of the apricots; although the apricots were good. A great recipe and wonderful use of Reynolds Cookies Baking parchment paper sheets. It truly made cleanup a snap!

This is a fantastic biscotti recipe.  Super easy, with great results.  I changed up the add ins and used almonds and chocolate toffee bits.  Wonderful addition to my homemade coffee basket gift this holiday.
