Abstaining from meat on Friday during Lent is supposed to be a bit of a sacrifice but this was a definite treat.  I have made similar dishes before but the small addition of heat sets this one apart. I had to make a few small changes to use what I had on hand.  I used red onion instead of shallots and dried basil and cut the oil and butter back to 2 tbs each.  Thank you for sharing, Chitimacha!

I made this as directed and found it lacking in flavor.   I tasted the distinct flavors of the veggies and shrimp. Tthe only change I made (after I made it as written) which made it 5 stars to me was add in some Cajun seasoning.   I'm guessing I added in 1/2 or 3/4 of a teaspoon.  I will probably make this again with my change.   Thanks!

Made just as directed, only adding a bit of Cajun seasoning, as others suggested. We enjoyed it a lot and I will make it again. Thank you.

Just added salt and pepper to the skillet, and a little pasta water when finished.  We loved it!

So tasty! I added a dash of Cajun seasoning, as one other person had suggested, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. I highly recommend this, and it will be a regular in our rotation for sure!

This was very good , my husband really liked it too ! I added some old bay seasoning to the asparagus tips before final assembly ( and didn't use the Parmesan cheese .)

This was great.  I added a little more Parm because we are a cheese eating family.
