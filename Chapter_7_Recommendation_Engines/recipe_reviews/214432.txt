Cooking times have been updated in the recipe.  If your steak is thinner or thicker than 1" reduce or increase the cook times.  7 mins on each side for a 1" thick cut will result in a medium rare to medium cooked steak.

This was very good. You really have to get a good steak that isnt too chewy. it you dont cut the asparagus bottoms off high its makes for a chewy meal.

I loved the steak. The worcestershire sause made the steak taste great. I also added hollandaise sause on the asparagus thats on the side.

This impressed my family so much, they asked me to make it again. If possible, get your steaks fresh from a butcher. Makes a great difference. Cheers

It wasn’t very flavorful but it may be because we used the broiler instead of the grill? It was super easy to make though! Major plus. I won’t make it again.

I am always looking for different ways to prep steak and add sides/toppings.  This one was not only simple to make, but unique and enjoyable for the whole family.

this was a great starting point for us.. we used thin sliced chuck steak.. seasoned with montreal steak seasoning.. blanched the asparagus in beef broth.. and assembled for the oven.. cooked until the steak was done and cheese melted.. ty for the inspiration for this simple but tasty dish
