I grew up with cabbage prepared this way and it has always been one of my favorites.  I use fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder, but it was the addition of the mustard in the recipe that grabbed me. I think the recipe is misleading when it directs to cook the cabbage for 5 minutes--I believe it should read to cook to the desired degree of tenderness, and in my case it was a good deal longer than 5 minutes. After 5 minutes the baggage was still pretty crunchy.   I added a bit of water to the pan and covered it for several minutes, then uncovered the pan to let the juices evaporate.  As for the mustard?  I was disappointed that I couldn't even taste it, so the next time I make this I'll have to double it!

This was delicious!  I'm eating it right now as I'm typing!  I stir fried some onion and fresh garlic in the bacon grease before adding the cabbage and I added a teaspoon of ground mustard instead of half a teaspoon.   I think next time though I will try a healthier version without the bacon grease.

This is southern cooking at its best. Cabbage smothered down in bacon grease with onions and a little salt. You can't mess this one up, use as much bacon or onion as you want. You can add a little bit of water to help the cabbage cook. The longer it cooks the sweeter it taste. We cook ours until its falling apart. No need for the mustard. No need to pour off any of the bacon grease, it makes the cabbage taste so good.

Excellent!  I used turkey bacon, so I added a little bit of olive oil with the cabbage.  I wasn't sure if the recipe meant mustard powder or coarse ground mustard, so I opted for the coarse ground mustard and double it.  Used a clove of minced garlic instead of the powder.  Very fast and delicious!

I just cooked the cabbage in leftover bacon fat and added in garlic and half a yellow onion. I also skipped the powdered mustard and added in a couple Tbsp. of dijon mustard.  I served it w/ roasted chicken breast and it was even better heated up the next day.  I'll be making this again!

This is absolutely delicious! The flavors are subtle and the texture of the cabbage is wonderful. I doubled the mustard as others suggested but think will a bit even more next time. What a great way to get some green in your diet!

I've made this numerous times in the last few months.  First time as written, I'd have given it 4 stars, pretty darn good!  Since then I've been making it with italian sausage instead of the bacon, minced garlic instead of powder and whatever chopped vegetables I have in the fridge.  SO, SO GOOD!!  I'm making it again tonight!!

This was a hit with my finicky son and my husband, who doesn't usually care for cabbage. Very simple and tasty. I will definitely be making this more often.

I grew up eating this dish. Growing up on a budget, my mom would prepare this meal for us because it was cheap and quick. The only difference was we'd use black pepper and maybe a little salt for the cabbage. Tasty meal.

'Had leftover cabbage - 4c raw.  Sauteed an onion, added the cabbage, sprinkled garlic power over, a t ground mustard & 1/4t salt.  'Had about a T bacon (cooked).  Okay, not more than that.  'Even doubling the mustard, it wasn't noticable.  'Probably stick with regular noreciperecipe.  It's on the plain side, too; but we like it.  :)

Easy and really good!  I increased the mustard to 1 1/2 tsp.  It was just a little sharp - next time I would use 1 tsp mustard.  I also covered after stir-frying and took off the heat - it steamed to perfection.

I served this instead of noodles with chicken paprikash for a low-carb version of the dish.  the simple preparation of the cabbage was a great match to the paprikash.

This was pretty good.  Probably would have been better had I had some fresh bacon to use.  I had to use some stored bacon drippings to fry the cabbage in and then added some real bacon bits that I had on hand.  Not bad for something different than regular fried cabbage.

Made exactly as written and it was very good.  Easy to prepare.  But I'm only giving 4 stars because it was a little salty for our taste.  With the bacon we really didn't need any added salt.  Will omit salt next time.

I am from the south myself and my family are really good cooks. But I have never cooked cabbage. And being a picky eater has really limited me to trying different food or recipes. OMG!!!! This was delicious! I'm eating it right now as I'm typing! I added only a few seasonings and took away the ingredients of  ground mustard. I stir fried some diced red onions, pepper, a few sprinkles of seasoning salt, and some McCormick Grill Mates Roasted Garlic and Herb seasoning in the bacon grease before adding the cabbage. I did cook it a little longer than 5mins and allowed the steam to cook the rest of the cabbage. It was tender and still had a little crunchy but it was absolutely delicious.

I had never had it with bacon before and I really liked it. I did use as small amount of bacon grease as I could. I usually cook the cabbage this way with just onions or sometimes I cook a little ground beef and onions and then add the cabbage. I don't like mustard, so I didn't add that. Great way to save some money and eat your vegetables too.

This was good. I cooked my cabbage for about 10 minutes and added water as suggested by another reviewer. Next time I will to use fresh garlic and saute some chopped onion in the bacon grease before adding the cabbage.

Really good! It has such a German taste to it.  I did add extra mustard and keep the rest of the recipe the same. I will make this more often since it is so simple and yummy.

I made this for dinner last night, and I was not overly impressed. Maybe the cabbage that I bought was just a bitter one, but it was just okay at best.

As a child we often had sauteed cabbage mixed with egg noodles on no meat Fridays.  I too usually add some slivered onion.  For a change, try it with smoked sausage too for a one dish meal (with noodles).  Definitely need to cook for more than 5 minutes!
