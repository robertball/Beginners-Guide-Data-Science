I have had these since a child. Always purchased at a Syrian place. I always kind of liked them, but was not crazy for them.

Making them myself changed everything. They were fantastic. 

Just delicious.

Someone mentioned taking out the salt. Foolish. The salt mixes with the spices and makes it that much better. Do not listen to them, include the salt.
