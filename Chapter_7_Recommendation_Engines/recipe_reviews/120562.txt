These pancakes are very yummy and much easier to prepare than the directions make them seem! The second time I made them I skipped separating the eggs and whisking the egg whites and the pancakes turned out just as beautifully. 

I replace the sugar with Splenda, use whole wheat pastry flour, and add a bit more pumpkin puree than the recipe calls for (I LOVE pumpkin), then serve them with organic applesauce on the side - everyone loves them like this and it makes the dish diabetic-friendly!

This batter even makes tasty waffles - just be sure not to peek under the waffle iron before they're fully cooked.

Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe with us!

I didn't have the ingredients to make the syrup so I used light syrup instead. For the pancakes, I substituted whole wheat flour for the AP flour, brown sugar for the sugar, and melted butter for the oil. Turned out so yummy and kept me full way beyond lunchtime. I might increase the cinnamon to 1 or 1 1/2 teaspoons next time though, but only because I like cinnamon. Brenda, thank you for a great recipe!

Wonderful texture!  Nice and 'creamy'...very easy to make, too!

although these are delicious the way they are, they're ot as sweet as other recipes - which is fine, because the syrup MORE than makes up for it!  EXCELLENT RECIPE!

Very good texture and easy to make. I did not make the apple syrup but found the pancakes tasted great with maple. This is an easy way to use left over pumpkin.

These were delicious. I made both the syrup and the pancakes.  For my family of 6 that includes teenagers I doubled the pancake recipe but not the syrup recipe and we still had plenty of syrup.  Of course some still used regular syrup on their pancakes.  The only thing I did different was to add slightly more cinnamon.  I did not measure my pancake batter in 1/4 cups just put it on the griddle with a spoon and I had no problem with them getting done in the middle.  Will definitely make these again.

The Best!  The Hot Apple Syrup really compliments the delicious pumpkin pancakes!  I made the syrup the day before and warmed it up in the morning.  It's a really sweet syrup but we still enjoyed it!  The pancakes where like little pumpkin pies, so light and fluffy and Ohhh so good.  Thx!

This was delicious!  We just came back from a stay at a bed & breakfast in eastern PA.  The owner must be a Taste of Home subscriber :)  She made us both the pumpkin pancakes and the apple cider syrup.  What a treat to have the two together!  The flavors play off of each other so well and make a wonderful Fall breakfast.

I made these for my husband and 3 year old daughter.  They both enjoyed the pancakes.  My husband even said these are his new favorite.  I did make a few changes using ingredients we typically use in our house.  I did not add the eggs and added a tsp of baking soda.  Replaced the sugar with splenda and also added a pinch of nutmeg. I did not make the syrup because we use sugar-free syrup instead. Thanks for the great recipe.  we will definitely be making these again.

I made these for my husband and we both loved them.  We didn't make the syrup because of time, but they tasted great anyway.  I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to add to the pumpkin flavor.

I really liked these!  My batter did turn out a little runny, had to add extra flour.  They cooked up great and had good flavor.  Will definitely make again!

made these for breakfast the other day, trying to use random things from the freezer up instead of going to the store. The kids really liked these, I made them into waffles, and They didn't know it had pumpkin in it. So I didn't tell them! Thanks for sharing...

I used whole wheat white flour in this recipe and lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk. I also used my own homemade organic pumpkin mash.I did double the pancake recipe only because we're a pancake-y family. I did not double the syrup recipe, but I did cut the brown sugar back by half and used half homemade maple syrup instead of corn syrup. The syrup needed double the spice. These pancakes were light and fluffy and puffed up beautifully when cooked but I wish there's been more of a pumpkin flavor.  Next time, I'll use pumpkin pie spice. We liked the syrup, but it was still a little too sweet, even cutting the sugar in half. After all was said and done, double the pancake recipe and I only had two pancakes left over and no syrup.

These pancakes and syrup are so yummy, my husband requested that we have them for dessert.  I made several dollar size pancakes, placed them on desert plates with the syrup and put a dollap of whipped cream on the top.  Delish!

These pancakes are absolutely amazing! The only big substitution I made was using Butternut Squash (fresh, baked and pureed) instead of Pumpkin Puree.

Made the pancakes alone (didn't bother making the Hot Cider Syrup as I had excellent maple syrup to use).

Husband and mom in law just adored them! Will be making again for sure!

Very good - I added some extra cinnamon and 1/2 t of ginger.  Made a batch with chopped pecans and they were delicious!  I also made a caramel sauce ('buttermilk sauce' from this site) and the whole thing tasted like pecan pie.  mmmm

Delicious! I had some sweet potatoes left over from dinner the night before and I actually used those and it worked just fine. Actually easier than opening a can of pumpkin. I will definitely make these again. Perfect for a Sunday brunch after church.

Fluffy, perfect, delicious.  Family kept saying "these are really good" and ate more than they usually do.  Instead of straight milk, I mixed in 1/2 egg nog, 1/2 milk.  Very good recipe!

my quest for the perfect scratch pancake continues.  i think these definitely need more spice - they were really bland.  i think additional sugar (not much, juts a little) also couldn't hurt.  mine had an of-texture too, not even sure how to describe it.  like they weren't quite done, except i know they were...  anyway, thanks for the try!

Was going to make regular pancakes when I saw recipes for pumpkin pancakes.  Since I had a couple of cans of pumpkin left over from the holidays, I decided to try this recipe because of reviews.  Followed recipe w/exceptions suggested by others:  Increased pumpkin to 3/4 c.  Added 1/4 tea. of pumpkin spice, used 2 tbsp. brown sugar in place of white, added some walnuts and didn't separate eggs, just whipped until fluffy.  Didn't have any wheat flour but would like to try next time along with increasing pumpkin to 1 c. and using pecans.  The pancakes were light, fluffy and delicious.  Very good taste, but I like more pumpkin.  Will definitely make again.  Added to my recipe box.

I decided to double the recipe and overall it was good. I feel that it did not have enough pumpkin and I would definitely use 1c instead of 1/2c of pumpkin next time. On the other hand the pancakes were very fluffy and light. I served this with Cinnamon Syrup from this site, it was a great compliment to the pancakes. Everyone enjoyed it.

Delicious!  Very moist and flavorful.  Added about 3 T additional pumpkin and 2T sugar based on other reviews.  Everyone loved them and they were gone quickly!  Very filling.

Just made the pancakes, and served with cinnamon applesauce instead of the syrup. Used a boxed multigrain pancake mix I had on hand, so for dry ingredients I just added some sugar and cinnamon. Also mixed the wet ingredients in a blender to get them super-fluffy. Awesome! Light and fluffy, delicious. I'll keep this recipe around for awhile!

I made a double batch so I would have extra to freeze for the kids. There weren't any extra ones to freeze! Great way to hide something healthy for picky eaters.

yummy & moist!  I only had 1 egg & used unsweetened almond milk...turned out great!  
I didn't make the syrup.  It sounds good but we used sugar free syrup.

These were yummy, next time I think I'll add a little pumpkin pie spice to get more flavor.  I also used applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour, and added flaxseed to make more healthy.  Skipped the syrup and cut up strawberries and banana as topping with a little jam for moisture!

These pancakes were so moist and amazing!!  I did add some nutmeg and ground clove to the dry mix to add some spice.  These were probably the best pancakes I've ever made even thought I did not make the syrup in the recipe, just used some fine upstate NY maple.

This is possibly the best pancake I have ever made.  The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup wheat germ for 1/2 cup flour for more fiber.

Any time my kids eat 5 big pancakes each, I know it's a good recipe.  We didn't have time to thicken the syrup so used regular syrup. Son tried the watery syrup and liked the flavor, though.  Fun day after Thanksgiving breakfast!

After reading the reviews of others, I upped the spices. The taste was not as dynamic as I thought it would be and the texture was a little too cake-like for our tastes.

I did not make the syrup, so this review is for the pancakes only.  I have been on the lookout for a better recipe to replace one I  had for years that calls for Bisquick and settled on this one to try.  I did make changes to the spices used as that is one thing we always loved about our old recipe.  I used 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  I also took Jackie's advice on not separating the eggs.  I beat them with a hand mixer for several mintues until they were thick and lemon colored before adding the other wet ingredients.  The resulting pancakes were so light and easy to make that I'll never know how much lighter they could have been if the whites had been beaten separately!  I do wonder why the need for 2 eggs and notice that some of the negative comments mention an "eggy" taste.

Just made these for my 2 year old niece & I (not the syrup though, as I didn't have all of the ingredients).  She devoured hers!  I made minimal changes: 1) subbed whole wheat flour 2) used pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon 3) seperated the eggs & was beating the whites but I had a little Miss Impatient who was hungry, so added them in before they got stiff.  Though there was a light pumpkin flavor, next time I would add more pumpkin puree (but I admit I LOVE pumpkin).  Same goes with the spice, would probably add another 1/2 tsp.  All in all, glad I tried the recipe, it turned out to be a fairly tasty bfast!  :)

Tasted just a little too eggy, and needed more of pumpkin and spice presence.  It seems like it has promise, so I'll probably tinker some more with this.

So so good. I didn't realize I didn't have milk, so I just substituted water for it and it was still amazing. Can't wait to make these again with milk...probably will be much thicker. Also, I didn't make the hot cider syrup, just used heated up pure maple! Thank you for this recipe!

These pancakes were so fluffy and moist.  The second time I made them I liked them better than the first.  I added a little more pumpkin and a little more sugar.  This way I can eat them without adding any type of syrup and they are still sweet and delicious.

This is a fast, easy and delicious recipe.  It took less than 5 minutes to make the batter and the kids loved it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and did not whip up the egg whites; I just added them into the wet ingredients and mixed it all up.  Other changes I made:  4 TBSP brown sugar instead of the 1 TBSP of regular (we like our pancakes sweet), 2 1/2 TBSP oil and an extra spoonfull of pumpkin (could even be a little more).   I also spread the batter out with a spoon when cooking.  I did not, however, make the syrup.  Most definitely I will try it next time.  A lovely, comfort food that makes the house smell wonderful on a cold, rainy morning.

I love this recipe! The pancakes are so moist and delicious! The only change that I like to make is using 3/4 cup of pumpkin and only 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. This makes the recipe slightly healthier but is still as tasty!

The Hot Cider Syrup recipie was Amazing. I didn't use the pancake recipie, I already had one. The only change I recommend is it didn't need to boil for more than about 10-12 minutes and it thickened right up after I removed it from the stove and transfered it to a gravey boat to cool slightly. I was pressed for time and worried about ruining the syrup but everyone myself included loved it!!! Thank you so much for sharing. I will make this again.

The pancakes are so delicious. Whipping the egg whites makes them nice and fluffy despite the pumpkin. 
The syrup was tasty as well (and better than conventional pancake syrup), but I would omit the butter since it doesn't mix in at all. If someone wants butter he can add his own.

I only used the pancake recipe and they were pretty good. Mine were quite thick and were a bit difficult to fully cook without burning. I enjoyed this recipe but will continue trying others as well.

Thick like others commented, next time I may add more milk to thin it a touch. But super yummy! I will definitely make this again.

Very good. We didn't make the syrup and the pancakes weren't as sweet as we'd like so I added an extra TBSP of sugar and a splash of vanilla to the batter. I made it with whole wheat flour and it wasn't too heavy. I threw in a chocolate chips and it was fantastic. We topped with ground cinnamon roasted almonds. Great pumpkin pancake recipe. Thank you!!

Turned out pretty good!  This was my first time making pancakes from scratch and the batter was thinner than I was used to working with, and therefore I burned a few before perfecting my timing.  Other than that, the only change I made to the recipe was adding more sugar...probably used 1/4 cup overall.  Didn't do the cider syrup, just used regular maple.

I love pumpkin, and made this recipe for breakfast this morning.  The kids loved it, and I like how these pancakes turned out fluffy, unlike a lot of other pumpkin recipes which seem to taste uncooked or raw and slightly gummy in the middle.  I also like how the pancakes are not sweet.  I let the kids dip their pancakes into little syrup dishes, which helps control their sugar, and a little sweetness really adds to the flavor.  I also like these with pumpkin butter.  Very good.  I'll definitely make these again.

After making these pancakes it will be difficult to ever make regular pancakes again. The only change I made was I used unflavoured soy milk in the place of regular milk, because it was all that I had. They were SO delicious and did NOT require the syrup, which I made. Also, I didn't care for the syrup very much in general. You're better sticking to maple syrup if you decide the pancakes need it, but they are  plenty sweet and moist without it. I refrigerated the leftovers and ate them COLD the next day and they were DELICIOUS. Like pumpkin bread.

The cider syrup is Fantastic, just needs to be thickened w/ a little cornstarch- about 1/2 tsp.  The pancake flavor is incredible (with a few minor changes...increase sugar to 2 T, pumpkin to 3/4 C, add 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract) but it wasn't as fluffy as I was hoping for, but the taste makes up for that!  Husband and daughter couldn't get enough- really amazing!!

These were really delicious! I had a problem with them getting too done on the outside before the inside firmed up, and creating a balled-up mess- even with the heat turned down. I did use a cast iron pan, but I usually do with pancakes with the same pan and never had a problem before. Once I made them really tiny and used a lid, they were much easier to handle. They don't really "firm" up on the inside and seemed kind of gooey but they tasted fluffy and not raw while on the plate. Make the apple cider syrup or at least your own variation if you can, this was the best part & really complimented the pancakes.  I used real maple syrup with apple cider and threw in some apple butter, heated on the stove, it was super easy and delish. You could sub honey for the corn/maple syrup and probably still get really yummy results. Or just add some spices to apple butter. For the pancakes I used an organic whole wheat mix and added the oil and pumpkin puree and spices. I used apple cider instead of the milk/water it called for.  I would definitely make again.

PPP - perfect pumpkin pancakes. I didn't have a problem cracking the eggs right into the mix instead of scrambling them first. And I used a full teaspoon of cinnamon (but then, I love me some cinnamon). Made these for breakfast Halloween morning! Yummy.

YUM! These were a great hit with my family. I did not make the syrup (didn't have ingredients). The pancake is not as sweet as I was expecting it to be. I imagine they would be perfect with the syrup!! Based on other reviews I did add more cinnamon. I also added 1/3 cup of finely chopped oatmeal - it seems to fill my kids more. I also added a tsp. of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg. I used the small cookie scoop to measure out batter. I got 22 pancakes. Enough for seconds for the kids and a few leftovers for a snack later. Thank you, Brenda for a great recipe!!

I made these for my nephew and his friends and they came out wonderfully.  Because I didn't make the syrup and we were short on the bottled kind, I added 1 tsp of vanilla and a bit of brown sugar to the mix.  Still, very easy to make and delicious.

Amazing!  My syrup didn't turn out quite thick enough but it still tastes really good.  We made a double batch and froze the rest so we could eat them during the week.  My husband said every time he ate them it was like they were fresh from the pan!  He microwaved them for 30 seconds and then put them in the toaster.  DELICIOUS!

These were very easy and delicious!  Even my friend who doesn't like pancakes loved them. I added a little cloves and nutmeg to the mix. I didn't do the suryp, but instead topped them with cream cheese which was great.  I think this will be my new standard pancake recipe.  Would also be be great with nuts and you could easily use bananna or carrot in place of pumpkin.

These pancakes were delicious and devoured, even by my 5 year old who repeatedly commented "I'm not going to like them and I'm not going to eat them...no matter what!"  I didn't make the syrup but I used honey and my husband used real maple syrup and I also toasted some pecans to go on top.  Yummy!!  Definitely my new favorite pancake!

Very very yummy. If you double the recipe DO NOT double the mount of syrup. My kids are heavy handed with the syrup (try not to let them) and we did not use it all. Syrup does keep in the fridge though.

This is a GREAT pumpkin pancake recipe.  It's not too sweet, yet you get a great taste of pumpkin that comes through.  They were some of the best pancakes we've made.  It's simple to make.  We didn't have all the ingredients for the cider syrup, so we just had it with warm butter syrup and it was delicious!  Per other reviews, i did and an extra 1/2 TBS of sugar.

Loved this recipe.  I also used brown sugar (plus a bit more) and I added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning to the batter.  I didn't separate the eggs and it still turned out very light and fluffy.  The best part was the Hot Cider Syrup.  We topped our pancakes with toasted pecans and powdered sugar.  It was autumn in every bite!  Will make often!

this was very good! i made this for my family on christmas eve morning and it was all gone! i must say though each batch doesnt make a whole lot, so if you have a big ole family like i do, you'll want to make at least two batches! 
also, i put the syrup on the stovetop a little longer, it was a little thin for my liking. 

good recipe! will make again.

These were delicious!  Light and fluffy with a mild pumpkin flavor.  I made it a second time with some ground ginger and allspice for a bit more flavor, which turned out very well. I will definitely make these again!  Loved it!

These were ok but not our favorite pancake recipe. The taste was a little off to me and I made them exactly how the recipe said. I also made the syrup but for some reason it didn't get thick. We enjoyed our meal but I don't think I will be making these again.

Made the pancakes exactly per the recipe.  DELICIOUS!  Will be making this many more times.  My husband liked it with white chocolate chips in the batter.  Both were good...  Will try the syrup next time!  Oh, definitely doesn't serve 5, it fed 2 of us tonight...  Thanks for the great recipe!  :D

Excellent.  Made with real pumpkin (not from can) left over from another dish.  Moist, dense, and really good with just maple syrup.

Delicious.  I didn't add any extra flour and they were fine and easy to cook.  The only thing I did different was to add about 1/8 c. brown sugar.  They were WONderful on a Sunday morning.  As others suggested, I served them with the cinnamon cream syrup.

Ok so I just used regular Log Cabin syrup, but these were still delicious!  I added lots of spices though:  Used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves, and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I had no problems with them burning.  They turned out great!

Very good although I did not try making the syrup.   Will try the syrup next time.  I made 2 changes though.  I increased the pumpkin to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I agree with other reviewers that it is difficult to cook them all the way through without burning.  Trying to spread them out seemed to help.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had a tough time with this recipe. Although the flavor was good, all the pancakes were either burned or undercooked, and a few were both. Overall, too frustrating for me to make again.

I only used the syrup with some other pumpkin waffles.  It is good and really doesn't take as long as this says to cook.  I popped in the fridge for a couple of minutes and passed on letting it sit for 30 mins.  It is great.  But it carmelizes and doesn't reheat great so plan to eat it all up that day if possible.  I used some of the leftovers as jelly for PBJ's later that day.  Not rehated, that worked well, too.

I've never had pumpkin pancakes before, and this was a great introduction. I have 4 kids to feed daily, and this was a success! The syrup is delicious and really adds the flavor to the pancakes. They all ate two and that says something for pancakes!

These were very yummy! I just made them this morning and the whole family enjoyed the meal. My only complain is the syrup was a little runny but probably due to not being left out long enough. Next time I might try making it up the night before. The recipe was fairly easy and turned out great. Will definitely make this a regular in our house! Thank you!

I made this recipe without the pumpkin (I forgot that I used my can of pumpkin for something else)!  :(  It still turned out great!  I added a little vanilla and dash of pumkin pie spice.  I can't wait to try it WITH the pumpkin!

So yummy! I didn't make the syrup, because I wanted to use some maple syrup that I'd received as a gift. The pancakes were delicious, though! I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, because I like my pumpkin recipes spicy. =)

These pancakes were delicious! Very light and super fluffy from adding the whipped egg whites. I think next time instead of just using cinnamon, I will use pumpkin pie spice to give it more of a seasonal flavor. I didn't make the syrup but instead used a cinnamon maple syrup from the grocery. Very, very delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best pumpkin pancakes I have made. My husband loves anything pumpkin and usually you don't taste the pumpkin in the recipes.  I added 1/2t nutmeg. I also added extra cinnamon and about 1/4 cup more pumpkin!!!! These are excellent.  I didn't try the syrup but I will next time!

Made these for dinner and they were a hit! The only changes I made was shifting the dry ingredients - which I have to say I think made them even lighter and fluffier. I also added fresh grated nutmeg and a little more cinnamon.  Will certainly make again!

These had great flavor! Like pumpkin pie for breakfast. I tried the apple syrup and it made the kitchen smell awesome. I only had cheap apple juice, I'm sure it would be much better with true apple cider. I followed the syrup instructions but it never thickened up. Still tasty though. My boyfriend thought they had good flavor but turned out soggy.

These are yummy pancakes, but the syrup pushes them over the edge to delicious.  These are now on the menu for holiday breakfasts this year. I will have to make a double or triple batch to make sure there are enough.

I thought this was delicious and so did my kids! However, at the end I think I had a bit of a sugar overload! lol 

Note: do not proceed to sit and eat a ton of these in a row. You will likely regret it.

I LOVE pumpkin but theses just didn't work out. The finished product was too "wet" almost gummy. But I will try again and hopefully have a better outcome.

I made these pancakes for my husband and I. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out AMAZING! Probably some of the best pancakes we have ever had. I did not make the hot cider syrup - we just ate them with maple syrup - and they were still.. oh so good! I will definitely make/try the syrup next time when I make these pancakes in the years to come! Yum!!!

I was unsure of these. I had a hard time with them burning and getting cooked inside. So I spread out the batter as I put them on the griddle. The batter is not sweet, so I was worried about that. But with the syrup, OMG!! I was a hero in my kitchen when I made these! The inside is creamy that had the tongue feel and taste of pumpkin pie. Unique and wonderful!!

This was delicious. I didn't have pumpkin puree so I used pumpkin butter instead and left out the spices in the pancakes. It was better than I could have ever imagined. The syrup was outstanding. I didn't change that at all. Definitely making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

I used whole wheat flour and the batter turned out a little thick. I added chocolate chips and my daughter loved them. Didn't try the syrup, we just put a little honey drizzled on top. Next time I will try adding more pumpkin, replace brown sugar for the white sugar and add more cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Good recipe to use up extra pumpkin.

VERY GOOD! I added an additional tablespoon of sugar to the pancakes as they weren't sweet enough. The syrup is so good and worth the time. I combined the simmer/set time because I didn't want to wait and it was thinner than it should be, but the taste was still so amazing.

very easy to make, after reading reviews I decided to mix in whole eggs and pancakes came out nice and fluffy.  Next time I am going to use low-fat buttermilk.

Pancakes were FANTASTIC!! I altered a little to give it more of a pumpkin taste. I added about 3/4 of a cup of pumpkin puree instead of 1/2 and only added 3/4 cup of milk, for future will add more to thin batter out. Also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. These were great!! I also didn't have all of the ingredents to make the apple cider syrup, so, I made a carmal sauce and filled the pancakes with some sweetend cream cheese!! YUM!! So good, this will be in my Sunday morning breakfast recipe box FOREVER!! Thanks!

Wasn't as sweet as I like so I added some honey (about 2 tablespoons) I also used just plain syrup because I dont have the corn syrup although I am sure with the hot cider syrup the lack of sweetness in the pancakes would of been made up for.

These pumpkin pancakes came out very fluffy and light (I previously tried the highly rated pumpkin pancakes recipe from this site and they came out very heavy and dense in comparison to these).  The syrup was a bit thin, and tasted like spiced apple cider, but it complemented the pancakes very well.  There was enough syrup that you could probably make the pancakes twice to use it up.

My family loved these.  I couldn't cook them fast enough.  I followed the recipe except used soymilk instead of milk because of allergies.  They tasted great.  I didn't make the apple cider syrup this time just used maple syrup.  I will try the apple cider syrup next time.  My 4 and 5 year old boys ate them plain and loved them.

These were absolutely wonderful!  I did make several changes for my convenience, but have no doubt that the original recipe would be great!  I used a gluten free flour mix, didn't separate the eggs, and used regular syrup.  In my mind, they couldn't have been any better!  I do look forward to someday trying the syrup when I have more time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

made these; they were too runny.  so I added some flour.  I also added some nutmeg, ginger and clove (since hubby likes the spices of pumpkin pie). I did not like these at all. the kids are eating them.  Haven't heard from hubby yet.  But unless he gives a definite thumbs up, I will not be making them again.

I didn't make the syrup (which sounds awesome, by the way), and I did a couple things different with the pancake part: I added freshly grated nutmeg, substituted the sugar with maple sugar, and used apple sauce in exchange for the oil. It had good flavor, but not pumpkin-y enough for me. I also felt the texture was a bit too mushy, even though I know I cooked them enough. I think I would try another recipe next time.

Very tasty. Cider syrup is fantastic, but I have also eaten them with plain maple syrup and with apple butter. I do alter the spices a bit. In addition to the 1/2 t. cinnamon, I add 1/4 t. ginger and 1/8 t. ea. cloves and nutmeg. These are a staple in our home.

We made these tonight and the were wonderful.  I love pumpkin and these were so good.  I upped the cinamon and added nutmeg.  I also added some chopped pecans to mine.

The syrup was good but got very stringy and thick, I am not sure what happened but it was still very good!

Wow...children and adults alike loved the pancakes-even my husband that doesn't like pumpkin!  I used the called for cinnamon and an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice.  Like another reviewer said, the creamy consistency is  more like french toast than pancakes.  They take a bit longer to cook than the typical pancake, but it is well worth the extra time.

We used some left over cinnamon syrup in a chocolate chip pancake recipe on this site: 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup butter, and 1t. cinnamon (I use extra cinnamon)-microwave until butter melts and serve warm.  It complimented the pancakes perfectly.

Wow! These pancakes are seriously yummy. I made them with a 50/50 blend of white flour and wheat flour and they were delicious. I also used 1/3 the amount of brown sugar for the cider syrup and it turned out great. I think that it would be too sweet with the full amount.

I only made the pancakes. They are very good. I added a pinch more baking powder & 3 tbsp more flour (I like fluffy pancakes) and nutmeg and pumpkin spice for added flavor. I had to cook them a little longer than normal pancakes to ensure their cooked all the way through. These are a favorite!!

These pancakes are light and perfectly delicious. Be more generous on the spices for a real pumpkin pie taste.

Since I'm lactose intolerant, I substituted about 1/3 cup plain nonfat yogurt and 2/3 cup almond milk for the milk, and they tasted great!

Absolutely delicious!  The syrup could use a little cornstarch to thicken, but it is a MUST HAVE with the pancakes.  They are fantastic with a little powdered sugar on top, and maybe some applesauce.  Will definitely make again!

I did have the ingredients to make the syrup but the pancakes turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 t. of ground cloves, 1/2 t. ground ginger, 1/2 t. ground nutmeg.  We called the pumpkin pie pancakes.  They didn't even need syrup although next time I'm making that too.  Delicious.

My kids and husband loved these.  I had to make a double batch so I could have some!  I increased the cinnamon to 1t and added 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/2 t ginger and 1/4 t ground cloves.  We'll definitely be making these again.  Do spread them thin so they cook through.

I used fresh pumpkin, and the batter was more liquidy, so I had to add some extra flour.

Otherwise, no problems.  We made the syrup using apple cider and it was well worth it.  In fact, it was sweet enough that we have extra and are thinking about baking some apples later and drizzling it on for dessert.  We also discovered if you serve the pancakes with sweetened whipped cream they taste like pumpkin pie!

Light and fluffy. Although I did add a bit more cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

These were good, I also used a tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  I also folded in 6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled!  It was good, believe me!  Thanks

my family went crazy for it, for me it tastes like french toast ! maybe because i ate it after hours of making it !! the reheating may changed the taste.

These were pretty good.  My husband and I made them and he really loved them.  Next time I will add more cinnamon to give them a little extra spice.  I didn't have the time to make the syrup so I mixed together some cinnamon and sugar and sprinkled that on top (don't like maple syrup) and that was really nice- it enhanced the flavor of the pancakes.  Overall, a nice treat!

So delicious! The syrup really added great flavor. It  didn't get as thick as I wanted so I added a can of apple pie filling and some dried cranberries while cooking and served it warm. It was absolutely delicous! The pancakes were super yummy too, moist and fluffy at the same time!

These were good. My kids liked them and said they want them again. I like the fact they are getting something a little more nutritious for breakfast than the normal pancakes. We didn't make the syrup and just used Mrs. Butterworth and they were fine together. We will be making this again!

I have only made the pancakes but I loved them. I may add a little more pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice next time to increase the flavor. However, this is both easy and delicious and so I recommend it.

My kids really liked these and each rated it 4 and a half stars. I rate it at 4 because they took an awfully long time to cook through. Spreading them with a spoon does cut down cooking time but also fluffines. Still, very tasty!

There are never leftovers when I make these pancake I am begged every weekend to make them, I have to double the ingredients because I have to make them for a family of 6. 
 And the syrup is a must for these pancakes.

These are delicious - light and not too pumpkin-y. It is definitely worth making the syrup as it compliments the pancakes.

This recipe was easy to follow and the pancakes were delicious, even without the syrup.  We will definitely try them with the syrup soon.
