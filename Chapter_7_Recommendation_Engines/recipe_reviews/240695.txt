Mmm. These hold their own against beefier meatballs. Lots of flavor. We couldn't stop eating them.

I liked these a lot. I did use ground turkey breast as that was what I had. It turned out just fine for me. I think I left the mixture in the fridge longer than an hour, so perhaps the extra time gave the veggies more time to leech the needed moisture into the meat.. my meatballs were not dry at all.

I thought that these meatballs are fabulous! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. I just replaced the milk with skim. Since ground turkey was on sale, I made a lot to freeze and use later. I thought the flavor was great on its own, and would make a great pair with a vegetable for a healthy dinner. To freeze the meatballs I let them cool, then placed them on a cookie sheet in the freezer. After they were frozen solid, I placed them in labeled ziploc bags.

these came out pretty good.. i used this as a base for making 4 large burgers.. made the following modifications: low carb bread for the whole grain, almond milk for the regular, 1/2 a red onion for the whole onion, and 1/2 a green bell pepper for the red.. also added one carrot and one celery stalk.. threw all the veggies in the food processor and let it do all the work.. added 1/4 tsp salt just b/c i do the 1:1 ratio of lb to tsp.. this came out tasting like meatloaf, but in a good way! bf said he'd like to have some type of cheese in there next time.. i didn't make the dip but i could see how it would go with the meatballs.. looking forward to making this again.. ty for the recipe

Best turkey meatball I have made (and I have tried quite a few).  I did not make the dip, so I can't comment on it.

What a great dish! I overcooked it a little (oops), and didn't have mayo in my dip (by choice)--but it all turned out so yummy! Read about it in the magazine, and just started a new diet. All clean ingredients and super tasty and healthy!
