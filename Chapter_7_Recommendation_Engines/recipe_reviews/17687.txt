Oh my goodness, I am SO glad I looked for a recipe today to use up a bunch of oranges!  What a wonderful, lovely, delicious cake! I took a few suggestions from other reviewers and the result was perfect. I used 1 T. of zest and about 2 T. orange marmalade in the batter (tho' I don't know that the marmalade was really necessary). I made the cake in two 8-inch layers, and made the frosting as stated with just a little less vanilla than called for, which made enough to fill and frost the top. The orange flavor came through perfectly, the cake is moist and a beautiful shade of yellow-orange. The frosting is a must in my opinion, creamy and fluffy, and takes this cake over the top. I made this for my husband to take to the office tomorrow, but this cake is staying right here!

I found this cake to be absolutely delicious! I made a loaf cake in a loaf pan. It was absolutely great! I didn't make the icing though, as I found an even better recipe. A recipe intitled "Orange Loaf" by Carol is a recipe for a yummy orange bread AND an orange glaze. I used the glaze recipe instead of icing and it turned out amazing!:) Less fat too! The recipe is: Combine 1/2 cup orange juice with 1/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan. Heat and stir to dissolve sugar. Spoon glaze over hot cake. Let stand in pan for 10 minutes before removing cake from pan. I also garnished the top with halved orange rounds. It looked beautiful! Good luck!

I made this cake for my husbands birthday. But before I did I checked the reviews, some mentioned it didn't have enough orange flavor. So what I did was added more orange zest, but what I think made it perfect was the 2 1/2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier (an orange liquer). I imagine you can use orange extract but I didn't have it. It was absolutely delicious. It baked so well, to a golden brown. I will never make a boxed cake again! I used an old Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting recipe of my mothers, it was awesome. My husband was in heaven, told me how yummy it was with every bith he took. Two thumbs up, Excellent! Thanks.

This is a very good cake. To the batter I added the zest of one orange, 1 tsp of orange extract and 2oz of cream cheese (afraid it would be dry based on other reviews).  As a result, this was a 5-star cake!  The flavor was fabulous and it was soooooo moist!  I baked it in a bundt pan generously sprayed with Baker's Joy for 45 minutes and it released beautifully.  Just beautifully.  I didn't use the frosting, instead I glazed it.  I will make this again and again!

This was a great cake recipe. A very moist cake. The only thing that I did different was to use orange, tangerine, and lemon zest in both the cake and the icing. (I like a strong citrus flavor). In the past I have not had good results with your basic cake recipe (they have been a little dry), so I added 1/4 cup of sour cream and a pkg. of lemon jelatin to the cake batter. This definitely made it a moist cake. My husband liked it also and he is not a sweets fan. He really liked the citrus flavor. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It was great! Wilma

This was excellent!  I baked for 35 minutes at 325 in a 9x13 pan.  I added a little extra zest to both the batter and the frosting. I also added some sour cream to the batter.  Even with the extra zest, it was not too "orangey".  I will definately make this again.

Excellent recipe! I made this for my fiance´s bday and I usually never take the risk of trying a new recipe for a special ocassion. I´m really glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly, but I was concerned about moisture, so the only thing I changed was I added half the milk and the other half yoghurt. I also made it in a bundt pan. It was done in 30 mins. I also made the frosting, it´s really good, but a tad too sweet for my taste. Still would make the frosting again, but maybe a bit less powdered sugar. Refrigerated overnight and it was great. Fantastic recipe.

Last week I made the Orange Yogurt Bread on this site and thought it was wonderful and gave it a glowing review. Last night I made the Beat and Bake Orange Cake.  I prefer this recipe and the frosting is so good, it really makes makes this cake. The only change I made was to substitute orange yogurt for the milk.  I felt it gave the tang that an orange cake should have.

This recipe is incredibly quick and easy and has become one of my stand-bys! It's also very flexible - I've made lemon and lime cakes by changing the juice and zest. I've also eliminated the juice and increased the milk to make a coffee cake.

What a delightful cake!!!  I "upped" the orange zest in the cake part to heaping tablespoon and the same amount for the frosting.  I would have to say that even a little more zest in the cake portion would not be overpowering.  It is such a beautiful "sun-shiny" cake---it just screams HOT SUMMER DAY!!  I refrigerated mine and served it slightly cold--very refreshing!  I am an orange cake fan and this one has really won me over!  Will make it again and again!!  Thank you so much!

The egg flavour totally overwhelms the orange taste in this. Three eggs is a lot, and although the cake was moist, it was a bit too crumbly. It has a scrambled egg/cakey taste for me.

This cake and frosting are absolutely perfect in every way. Everyone loved it. The cake is light but moist and the frosting is to die for. Super fast and easy. I used the zest of 1 large naval orange in the cake and 1/2 of an orange in the frosting. The frosting measurements do not make enough to fill between the layers and cover the top and sides. I had to go back and make an adiditional 1/2 frosting recipe to finish up. But it is so worth it. Thanks for sharing!

We LOVE orange flavored anything. I've had this recipe in my RB for some time and when I decided to make Real Strawberry Frosting using oranges in place of strawberries, I knew this would be the recipe. It's really good, in fact, it's very good! The orange flavor comes through and it's still light and cake-like. I half anticipated it would be a little bit heavier than it was. Most difinately a keeper, I'll be making this one again.

I was really impressed with this orange cake recipe.  I did add one additional ingredient: a bit of rough cut orange marmalade which just added to the fresh Valencia orange juice! I also made it in a loaf pan which kept it more moist I think.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious & easy to make. I lessen the sugar & added in homemade orange extract. The 2nd time, instead of adding milk, i put in sourcream & it's so awesomely good. Didn't even bother with the frosting

Great cake!!Moist, creamy and awesomely orangey!! I added orange marmalade and extra zest to the batter.
For the frosting, I added 1/4-1/2 tsp orange extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I also added a bit of marmalade and no zest. And, I used orange juice with pulp !!
I felt the cake would do well without the frosting!! thanks! >>> UPDATE 28/12/2010 I love this cake. This time I didn't add any zest in the batter/frosting (forgot!!). But did add 3 teaspoons of bitter orange marmalade to the batter and 1 teaspoon marmalade to the frosting. Also added 1.5teaspoon orange extract to the batter and 1 teaspoon to the frosting. And this time, I used orange juice with no pulp (coz that's what I had on hand). This does take me more than 35 minutes to reach perfection. I made this in a Christmas tree tin and used the frosting to look like snow. Not too sweet and a fab change after the sweets/candies and chocolates of the Christmas season. Loved by one and all! Thanks Mau! :)

This cake turned out well even though I didn't have a proper beater and just used a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients. I used more orange zest to make it more fragrant. The taste and texture is great! Thanks a lot for sharing this wonderful recipe, will be making it again soon :D

This was simply incredible. I used freshly squeezed orange juice, used half brown sugar and half white, upped the orange zest, and added a dash of orange essence. Simply fantastic! Also added a dash of the orange essence to the icing. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I would give it more stars if I could.  OMG, it was so good.  The frosting was to die for!  I did add more orange zest to it than it called for though:)  For the cake I used splenda instead of sugar and no one seemed to notice.  Out of the 10 deserts at our easter celebration, it was the only one without a crub left.  Thanks for such a good recipe!

This was the best cake I have had in a long time, I added extra zest and OJ to the cake and I added a little extra zest to the frosting which turned out to be more of a glaze then a frosting but that was great as well.

So delicious and easy. I baked mine in a 9x13 pan for about 32 minutes and topped it with an orange buttercream frosting. All together, the recipe calls for about 2 oranges for the cake and I used an additional orange for the frosting. Wonderful recipe.

My husband loved the texture and the taste.  I made the recipe exactly as written. I baked it in a bunt pan and used the icing suggested by NOVACAT 2003 which was 1/2 Cup Orange Juice with 1/4 Cup sugar cooked in a small saucepan and I poured it over the cake while it was still hot and in the bunt pan and let it soak (I poked holes in the cake).  I was unable to get the cake out of the pan, but we just cut it inside the pan and it came out piece at a time  just fine.

This cake received rave reviews.  I did follow some of the advice given by other members, however, and added 1 and 1/2 Tbsp. orange zest and 2 Tbsp. orange marmalade.  Additionally, instead of using the suggested glaze, I prepared a chocolate sourcream frosting, as suggested by one member.  This cake was gobbled up and had a perfect texture, yet I would recommend that anyone preparing it increase the amount of orange flavour.  Thank you.

i just finished baking this cake. GAH! it smelled great as i was baking.  i used a bundt cake pan that turned out to be a huge mistake.  when i flipped it over, the cake broke.  so i was hoping if i did it one more time  the other half would come out clean and i could just fix it up a little. it didnt. i have a broken cake.  if you are planning on making a bundt cake, bake it a little longer, but it might be dry.  the cake tastes good, but next time i'm using a regular cake pan. that picture is misleading..but i did make a tastier (in my opinion) glaze from about 3/4 a cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup cream cheese, 1 tsp orange zest and 2 1/2 tbs of orange juice.  it was good (with our broken cake). i will make this again but be more wary of which pan i use.

My daughter asked me to make this cake for her birthday. Everyone loved it! I made it as written except I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want to make a layer cake. I still used the full amount of orange zest because other reviewers said it needed more orange flavor. The only other thing I changed was to add 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract. I didn't make the frosting, but used Cool Whip instead with some extra orange zest on top because I wanted to keep it light. This cake had the perfect amount of orange flavor! It was just what I hoped it would be...light and refreshing! Thank you Menling for a great easy cake recipe.

I made these into cupcakes.  I used a little more orange zest (about 1 tbsp.). They had a really nice orange flavor but were a little dry.  I will make a cake with the recipe next time to see if that takes care of the dryness. The frosting was REALLY good.

This is the best orange cake I have ever tried. It was sooooo moist and delicious. I did add extra grated rind to both the cake and the icing as well as some of the orange pulp to the cake. Yummo!!!! I will make this over and over again. I remembered this flavour when my mother made an orange cake and this was very close to that. Brought back some great memories. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty cake. After reading the reviews, I used sour cream isntead of milk and the cake wasn't dry at all. Also used whole orange zest and bit more fresh orange juice than called for. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and used orange glaze rather than the regular icing. Though probably not often, I would make this again.

I made this cake in a springform pan so it was a thick, single layer.  It was nicely done in a 350 oven in 25 minutes. To compensate for the extra height, I made an orange syrup (1/2 cup o.j. with 1/4 cup granulated sugar simmered for 7 minutes) to top the cake before icing.  I used a skewer to poke many, many holes and while hot, slowly poured the syrup over.  When completely cooled, I covered the top with a nicely thick layer of buttercream.  I prefer buttercream icing to have some sour cream in it, so I added 2T of it while leaving out 2T of the butter.  It gives an ordinary icing a little edge.  All in all, a good cake.  I was proud to serve and everyone loved it.

I used lemon instead of orange, and the cake turned out very well.  I made this for a friend who loves lemon desserts and she loved it!  Even I liked it, and I usually stick to chocolate.

Its ok. The icing that other reviews rave about it just ordinary icing with a bit of orange flavour in it. The cake tastes a bit like a giant pancake, I probably wouldn't make it again, but it was edible.

Serviceable, ordinary cake by directions, only AWESOME with addition of spices... which is why three stars.  It's a basic yellow cake recipe (compare it to Cake Mixes from Scratch on here, it's close!) with natural orange flavor and a glaze.  Biggest deviation I made was NO GLAZE.  It's just extra sticky sugar calories, and I just wanted a nice "snacky" orange cake.  

Minor(?) changes I made was substituting the 1/2c orange juice with four whole (peeled, separated and mashed) clementine oranges, and bumped up the amount of zest (I used the zest from all four clementines).  All that fruit pulp (hooray for dietary fiber!) meant that I could use less oil... yay... lower fat too!  Only a splash instead of a 1/2 cup.

ESSENTIAL awesome-ness changes... add SPICES!  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and Cardamom, which a lot of folks may not have in their cabinet.  (I bought my first jar a few weeks ago - it's expensive, but delicious in any fruit flavored bakery item, and pork, of all things!) Pumpkin Pie Spice mix or Allspice  would also work.  Boy, did this cake turn out well!  The BF and I ate half the bundt as evening (dessert) snack.  If we hadn't restrained ourselves - we would have eaten the whole thing!

Really good, for those who find that it doesn't taste very much like orange, did they try the oranges before??, sometimes you can find tasteless oranges, but with the right fruit, this cake is the best, with or without icing!

I added 1 teaspoon orange extract.  Also baked in 8x8x2 inch pan for 45 minutes.  Glazed with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup OJ mixture.  We really enjoyed this cake and it was simple to make.

First time I have made an orange cake.  Very good.  Followed recipe.  The juice and zest of two oranges were enough for the cake and the frosting.  Nice orange flavor and good texture.  I would make this cake again.  Also would like to try with lemon.

This was a very moist cake, almost too moist for a bundt or angelfood pan. I used all (freshly squeezed) oj and no milk, and only 2 eggs.

It's my first time ever baking a cake and it was for my mom's bday. Am glad that I chose this recipe! It was easy to follow and everyone loved it! Just came back from dinner and the cake Was finished in one seating!

The only thing I did differently was to add the zest and instead of a buttercream frosting, I did a cheesecake frosting that I got out of another recipe. The end result was marvelous!

Thx so much for this recipe! :-)

I did a quadruple batch for a huge double layered cake, and this recipe's good, it is very moist due to the oil/milk  base, and you can add as much zest you want, but try to get unwaxed oranges. Also different varieties of oranges will give you different results. I used half the sugar because my frosting will compensate for sweetness. The best is to let the cake rest until the next day, I find it tastes alot more of orange (also works for other citrus loafes). Thank's for sharing !

Wow! Great cake :)The only flour I had in the house was whole wheat and unbleached, so I used about half & half for this recipe. I did sift it after measuring it. I also used whole milk plain yogurt for the milk. Topped it with an orange glaze rather than frosting. Cake is moist and flavorful.

This cake is unbelievably quick and yummy. I will probably include some additional zest in the batter next time, i feel it wasn't "orangey" enough. The rest of it was perfect though: sweetness, texture and moisture.

I made this to take in to work for a colleague who's leaving. As some of the reviews said that there wasn't enough orange taste, I added 2T of orange marmalade to the batter. I also subbed orange extract for the vanilla in the frosting. I baked this in two 8" pans and I had enough frosting for the middle and the top of the cake. When I went to get the container from the staff room there wasn't a slice left, I didn't even get one. All my colleagues enjoyed this. Thanks.

I've made this cake twice and my family loves it! I haven't made it with the icing because I didn't have everything needed but I have made it with the syrup someone else suggested. I've made it with and without the syrup and both ways are great I can just imagine how awesome it would be with the icing. When I baked this cake I just used a rectangular dish, a 9x13 I think.

Thanks so much for the recipe.  I used orange juice concentrate as the reviews indicated that it wasn't orangy enough.  What a hit!  I made it for my husband's birthday and he raved about it!!!  Great butter icing!  Will definitely use again and again.

Great recipe! I added some crushed almonds, put 2 tbsp of orange zest, and while the cake was still warm I poked holes in the top with a skewer and poured hot orange syrup all over it (made with 1 cup water, 3 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp orange juice and 1 tbsp orange zest boiled till reduced to about 3/4th). 
It was vert moist and 'orangey'!

The cake was quick to make, however i was disappointed that it didn't have the 'orange' flavor i was expecting. I even added more orange zest than originally called for. All in all it was ok and i'll make it again. The icing is more of a glaze that probably works better with bundt cakes than a layer cake.

I have never even heard of an orange cake before i made this, and I am so glad i tried something new. If you love oranges(my family does) then you will love this cake. For the orange juice, i did use fresh squeezed and i think that really added to the fresh orange flavor. Im recommending this recipe to anyone who likes cake.

This cake was very tasty and moist. I didn't have 8 inch round cake pans, so I used the alternate 9 X 5 inch loaf pan. But far too much batter for that size of a pan. Cake cooked over and onto the bottom of my oven. What a mess!  Next time, I'll put into 9 inch round cake pans or divide batter into 2 loaf pans for two thinner layers.

This is a lovely light and moist cake.    Ingredients we normally have on hand and so easy to make.   Does not really need a frosting but a dark chocolate one would enhance the lily.   To give it a deeper orange flavor it does need orange zest and, as one reviewer suggested, orange liqueur.     Thanks for a great contribution to this site and my files.

After a friend gave this recipe very good reviews, I made it for myself and I was NOT disappointed.  The cake is delicious.  I did sub buttermilk for the milk and add a TBS Grand Marnier to the batter and then made cupcakes (baked for 18-20 minutes at 350 degrees F).  To make your regular granulated sugar superfine, pulse in food processor a few times. Using superfine will allow the sugar to dissolve better.  The cake is light and moist with a nice orange flavor...not overpowering, but just lightly there.  I also added a TBS of Grand Marnier to the frosting.

This cake is amazing, I used the fresh orange juice and added a bit more of the zest but it was perfect. I did the same for the icing, used fresh juice and it really is good. I did omit one egg per one comment and it was a big HIT, Will make it again!!!

This recipe was awesome. Great texture, light and fluffy. The only thing I changed was I doubled the orange zest and added 2 tsp of orange extract. (I really like a strong orange flavour). Made this with alternating layers of chocolate orange cake, chocolate orange cream cheese icing and Contreau Chocolate ganache. Divine :)

Pretty good. It had the texture of an angel food or sponge cake without all of the work! I didn't have orange zest so just added a splash of orange extract. Also I was taking this to an outdoor BBQ & didn't want to mess with frosting so just made a quick glaze with 2/3 c. OJ, 1/3 c. Sugar, and a splash each of vanilla & orange extract heated just until sugar disolved. I poked some holes in the cake and dumped in on top. Then topped with thawed, pureed frozen raspberries. Super Yummy.

I forgot to add additional cream (either in the form of cream cheese or sour cream, as I usually do for cake recipes to maintain a moist consistency), so it did come out drier than I would've liked, but even still it was delicious. I used almost 2 full T of zest and the 1/2 cup of juice for the batter and still think it could've used a little more kick - but the icing really did the trick. I followed the instructions listed, but instead of 6T of butter, I used three. I still added the same amount of juice, sugar and vanilla, but used a heaping 1T of zest, and then mixed all of that with whipped cream to help balance out the taste and make a lighter consistency. It was perfect for this cake. I started out mixing about a cup of whipped cream and then just kept tasting it until I was happy with it. It ended up making enough to cover both cakes, though I didn't put a huge amount on each. It was just a thick layer to cover the top. The last thing I added was coconut - I just sprinkled it all over on top of the icing. Along with the orange flavor, it was amazing.

This cake was all that it claimed to be!  It was easy and tasted really good.  I didn't use the frosting b/c we are (trying) to be a little healthy, so I simply used the juice from the zested orange, added 1/4 cup more  of bottled oj, 2 tbs of sugar and boiled it down to make a glaze.  I added a tsp of cold butter and brushed it on the cake.  It was sooo good!

I have just made this cake and it is devine - I made it in one deep 9in round tin as that was all I had and used the glaze suggested by novacat (1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup sugar) as I discovered I didn´t have enough confectioners sugar after I had started baking.  Really easy and quick recipe to make and its a tasty, orangy, moist cake.  I will be making this a lot in the future!

Overall, I was pleased with the recipe... though I was expecting it to be a bit lighter and fluffier... pretty sure I didn't overbeat it when I mixed it by hand and sifted all the ingredients. It was easy to throw together and did have a nice orange flavor. I made into cupcakes and was able to get 20 regular size from the batch.

This is a delicious, simple recipe but you MUST add cream cheese or other ingredient for moisture. I made this recipe the first time and everyone said it was too dry. The second (and third and twentieth) time I added about 3 ounces of cream cheese to rave reviews.

Oh yes.  You all did not steer me wrong.  These were very yummy.  After reading the reviews, I may have gone a wee bit overboard in adding additional zest (didn't measure it but used the zest of 2 oranges for the cake and 1 for icing).  Even with a bit more orange taste than ideal these were delicious.  Very bright and sunny treat.

I made it as per the recipe, but as I used OJ from a carton and didn't have any zest, I added about 2 tbsp of marmalade. When it was done, I poured about half a cup of OJ mixed with 1/4 cup of sugar over the cake. It made the cake really moist.

This turned out great!  I used 1 TBS orange zest in the cake aling with fresh squeezed orange juice.  I did not make the frosting the first time, but when I make it again (for my teachers' gifts) I am going to make the frosting.  I baked these in foil mini loaf pans (yielded 3 mini-loaves) for 40 minutes at 350 degrees.

Very good! My whole family really enjoys this cake. It's very fresh and unique, but mine was pretty dense and heavy. If you're doubling the recipe, don't double the icing! I have a lot left over now... :) I can promise you it will be a hit with your families. Have a great summer, everyone!

LOVED this recipe! Did make some minor changes...used whole wheat flour, raw sugar and fresh squeezed orange juice vs store bought. Also had to add a bit more OJ than recipe called for for frosting, but WOW, how tasty!  For Easter, I made egg shaped mini cakes and they came out perfect! I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand..YUM!!!

This was fabulous. It reminds me of Sara Lee orange cake that I used to eat as a child (no baking occurred in our house, even though my mother was an excellent cook). I mad half the recipe because there were only three of us, and it was just perfect, with some left over for the rest of the week. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This cake turned out to be very dry. We served it with homemade whipped cream and it was a little bit better. Also, It really did not have a great orange flavor. I suggest using a little more orange juice.

This recipe is fabulous just as is, but I wanted it to have a little more orange flavor and be just a tad moister so I added 1 11oz can of mandarin oranges that I chopped fine and drained well. It turned out great! Thanks for the great recipe.

great cake very moist.  the only reason for the 4 stars was that it was kind of hard to get out of the pan.  not the sharp tangy kind of citrus flavor i hoped for but still a great dessert.  will make again but with grand marinier like the another suggested.

It's a lovely, orangey cake - but mine didn't rise very much despite the 3 tsp of baking powder. It was rather dense and moist. Apart from the orange zest, I also added candied orange peel (homemade - peel an orange, slice into thin strips, toss in a tbs of sugar and leave in the fridge till you need to use it). I got the idea from a reviewer who added marmalade. Will definitely try again because it's just so easy to make. If it rises the next time, I'll add another star.

I was hoping this would be a very tasty "definitely keeper" kind of cake...  It doesn't taste bad but it doesn't taste great, either....  Unfortunately this won't be one of my keeper recipes...

I don't have 8-inch cake pans, so I used the loaf pan, and it came out great. The cake has a nice texture and moisture. The taste is really great too, except I didn't have any oranges in the house, so I used orange extract in the place of the zest. It still came out great. My husband says I can make it anytime. 

The frosting is really good, but really, really sweet. And, it doesn't frost too well on a loaf, but what can one expect?

Nice light cake. Perfect for morning tea and using up some excess oranges. I only had a cup of icing sugar for the icing rather than the 2 it called for so I used a 1/2 cup of light cream cheese instead. Placed the icing in the middle and stacked the other cake on top. Worked a treat.

Very good.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Substituted Splenda for the sugar and added frozen oj concentrate along with the dry ingredients and then again with the butter cream frosting.  Ended up having a wonderful orangey taste.  Thanks

This cake was delicious - though the orange flavour could have been more pronouced - next time I will add more zest.  I baked it in a loaf pan - it did not rise very well, maybe I overbeated it. I am going to try using two 8 inch cake pans as the receipe suggested.  I added about 2 tbs of cream cheese to the icing and used lemon instead of orange and it was yummee. But the proof is in the pudding and when I brought it in to work for someone's birthday (there are 5 people in the office) it was all gone by the end of the day.  I liked the fact that the number of ingredients was not too many and definately stuff that you would always have on hand.

I wasn't too thrilled with this cake. I follwed all the direction but, the cake started to brown 20 mins after i had it in the oven but it's center remained jello like until the 35 mins were up. Maybe next time i will cook it on lower than 350.  Dispite the outside being over cooked the inside did taste good.

This cake did not turn out how I expected it to. The cake was dry and not moist as I expected. The temp was too high or something because after about 5 minutes of cooking it started smelling like it was burning and it came out later (after reducing the temp) with REALLY brown edges/bottom. I will probably not be making this recipe again.

I've made this cake at least 6 times--and have changed it every time. The best adaption?  Substitute half the sugar for honey, and 1/2 c. flour for 1/2 c. ground almonds.  Add 1 t. almond extract to the batter.  As a vegan I also use egg replacer and mix in extra OJ instead of water for the replacer and double the amount of zest. It always gets raves.

Very easy, with a good flavor, though not particularly "strong" in my opinion.  My guests seemed to like it quite well.  I baked it in a bundt pan for about 30 minutes.

I converted this to a vegan recipe by using enerG egg replacer , soy yogurt in place of the milk and turbinado sugar instead of white sugar .to this  I added 1 cup craisins ,1/2 cup of chopped toasted pecans and 2 ounces of coarsely chopped vegan white chocolate . Baked in a bundt pan  this cake was a huge hit at my husbands birthday party with everyone and 2 people left with  the recipe :)

Fantastic cake! I zested two oranges for the cake ( didn’t bother measuring). Made orange curd for the filling and orange cream cheese frosting. One of the best cakes I’ve ever made or tasted. Made for Mother’s Day and the whole family loved it

Great flavor, the orange really comes through!  I did add a few drops of orange extract to make certain it tasted "orangey", and some extra zest.  I made this on Easter in a lamb cake mold, I would make it again.  The frosting was also good, but if desired, I believe this cake could be served without frosting.  Maybe some sprinkled powdered sugar, or fruit.  As long as you don't over bake it and dry it out.

Frosting is too sweet, and kinda ruined it.
Make sure to let the cake and the frosting cool down enough time before spreading the frosting on the cake!

I thought there is too much sugar with the sugar in the orange juice, I used a bunt cake pan, the cake got stuck in the pan, I grease the bunt pan good.
I set my oven for 325 degrees. 

Had to add more orange juice to frosting cut down on the butter.
I wanted the frosting towards a orange glaze for the cake.
The cake had a good orange flavor.

I didn't modify the recipe at all and it was fantastic. The only thing I did different was to bake the whole batter in one springform pan (45 minutes).

In the oven right now. It doesn't smells very orangey and the look of the cake is quite pale compared to the photo. It may be on me because I don't have that much grated orange zest, but I did put in 150ml of OJ. Will see how it tastes.

I've tried this cake before, but with a different recipe and it is MUCH easier and takes half the time to cook. it is very moist and uses ingredients that you all would have in your home.

This was a pretty good cake. I would've liked a slightly more intense orange flavor. The only thing I changed was less confectioners sugar because I like a buttery, less sweet tasting frosting.

very good cake and easy to make, I think I like the idea to bake in loaf pans and pour an orange glaze over it while it is still warm.

I read the reviews I added a extra drizzle of canola oil. Or about a1/8 cup more to the 1/2 cup stated.  I used the zest of 2 navel oranges 2 tbs in cake 1 in the frosting and sprinkled on top of the frosting. I added4oz of cream cheese to butter cream icing. Use real butter. I thought the layers were a little thi  I may increase it by50.percent next time. It was moist and deiish. The whole house smelled wonderful.Add tony favorites.

It was easy and good. I used 2 eggs instead of 3 because one of the reviews said it was too eggy. I also cut the oil and sugar a bit and used extra zest. I didn't do the icing - maybe next time. I will use this recipe again!

I used 1 T. of zest, and juiced oranges for the orange juice (added a little extra juice since it was not as strong as store orange juice).  Maybe next time I'll try the orange marmalade, but I thought it was great with just the fresh orange juice.  I also think the frosting is  great.  It's a really nice lunch-time or tea-time sort of cake.

DELISH cake, Mening! Fresh squeezed oj gave superb flavour. Not necessary, but I did add a full tsp of orange zest a 1 tsp of orange extract to cake. Mom who is a superb Dessert baker loved it, too. Her helpful  tip: always sift flour before you measure for cakes etc. Also, please watch the baking time as mine cooked under 35 mins.  Thank you for a superb Orange Cake & Icing that melts in your mouth . . . so much so I couldn't stop eating it last night LOL. This one will be added to our family's recipe book!

Our family's favourite cake! My husband and son can never get enough. Sometimes I buy a cake for some special ocassions like birthday.My husband always says then that he wish I baked the orange cake.   I made it so many times, and it always turns out great. I follow the receipe exacly most of the time, but sometimes I add a little orange extract, and sometimes I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I really think that coconut oil adds interesting touch to the cake. If you have it, use it. You will love it. 
And I really like "working" the cake from sctratch, without any boxed ingredients.

This cake is SO GOOD !  Very Moist--I made cupcakes--the batter made (18) regular size cupcakes. Instead of Orange Zest--I used a natural-Orange Bakery Emulsion--which has the taste and smell of fresh picked oranges. I made a homemade orange butter cream frosting which really added to the great orange cake.

A delicious cake and easy to make.  I made this for my husband's birthday with a dark chocolate frosting.  Chocolate-orange is one of his favorite flavors.  He was very pleased.

I made this recipe as cupcakes and they were just perfection! The only change I made was added 2 teaspoons of orange zest (original recipe calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons). I filled the muffin tin about 2/3 full, baked for 22 minutes and got 18 perfectly rounded cupcakes. And let's not forget the most important part - absolutely deeeeelicious!!

Awesome!  Lovely orange flavor.  I made 2 8-inch rounds, and used the orange buttercream in this recipe as the layer between the 2 cakes with some sliced strawberries.  I then frosted with a regular white buttercream icing - yum yum!

The cake itself was perfect-- not too sweet, light but moist, neither dense nor crumbly. I'm not a big fan of the icing/frosting, though. Aside from being too sweet, I thought the flavor was a bit off, and the cake actually tasted better without it. I'll keep looking around for a better frosting, but I'm definitely keeping the cake recipe. Thanks for sharing this!

I found this cake to be wonderful. Although when I first made it I used the two round pans.  When I took the cake out of the oven  I was shocked to see it was not even close to being the size of a normal cake.  I thought for sure I did something wrong.   I used the icing recipe and it was just wonderful.  I also made the loaf cake thinking  the other would not be enough.  For the loaf cake I used a glaze of 1/2 oj and 1/4 c. of white sugar heat till the sugar disolves.  I then poured it over the cake and let it sit for about 30 minutes.  I was great.  So if your going to make the round cake double the recipe.   Still can't go wrong with this.

I thought this cake was very dry. And even though I added some orange extract, it still didn't taste very orangey. The frosting was very good though.

I baked this cake today with the metric conversion recipe.I made a 9 x 5 loaf and baked it for a good hour and 10 minutes.
It is exactly the orange cake I wanted. Moist,delicate crumb and a true orange flavour.I used freshly squeezed Seville orange juice and grated rind.
I kept exactly to the recipe and was extremely happy with the result.
I will try it in a bundt tin next time.
Definitely will make another one as a gift to the person who gave me the box of oranges. Thank you for the recipe.

Thanks  also to allrecipes for the helpful conversion tables.

This cake is not a knock your socks off type. I gave it a 3 because of the average flavor. Had fun making it though. I did however make it into a bundt cake.

I didn't have any fancy liqueurs or essences but I found that adding the zest from two oranges and the orange glaze on top gave it all the flavour I could wish for. And what's perhaps even more important than that, it was really easy to make :). Thank you for sharing.

I used whole wheat pastry flour when making this cake and it came out great!  Nice orange flavor (I used a lot more zest and chopped it very fine.)  The icing leaves a lot to be desired.  Next time I'll try a cream cheese frosting, possibly a little candied orange peel for decoration.  Yum!  Even my mother in law, who bakes the worlds greatest cupcakes asked for the recipe!

Hello thank you for the Recipe, the cake came out delicious I used cuties brand oranges and added 2 cups regular white sugar and 2tsp orange extract I,I also added little less then 1/4 c. Orange marmalade that aided in the moisture  ..the pool only. Bad side was that it took about 45 min to bake because I added in the extras.will be saving this recipe  thanks:)

OMG! This cake is sooo good, especially the day after baking. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the changes I made were to substitute unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, and add poppy seeds as my husband has been asking for an orange poppy seed cake of late. Could not recommend adding poppy seeds more! They added a delightful nutty flavour and a bit of light texture. 

The icing is amazing as well, again I followed the recipe to a tee except for the addition of poppy seeds here as well. I would suggest at the very least doubling the icing if you are icing a layer cake, and even then you might need to triple it depending on the size of your cake, number of layers, and if you want to ice the sides too.

The cake was delicious however I wish i didn't make the frosting. It was too sweet. I think 2 cups confectioners sugar is way too much, 1 would have been enough.

Tasty and juicy, added a 20ml of VSOP,  and less 20 ml orange juice, increased bit of orange zest to 2tbs. Awesome tasty last in your mouth. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I baked it as a pair of 8-inch squares, topped them with chocolate icing, stacked them and served it as my son’s birthday cake. 

The cake came up very nicely, with a moist, springy crumb, and was luscious with all that orange juice and zest.

I made this cake for my cousin's birthday and it was delicious! Based on the reviews, I added 1 T. of orange zest and about 2 T. orange marmalade to the batter. I sprinkled orange juice on the finished cakes and they absorbed it very well making it moist. This cake is a little on the denser side, so I decided to frosted the cake with whipped cream-cream cheese frosting (with a couple of tablespoons of orange juice and 1 tsp of orange zest to make it more orangy). The light frosting went very well with the cake and the whole thing was beautiful!

Lovely, soft, moist cake.  I added a drop of vanilla to get rid of the egg smell but generally a lovely cake.  Made it with my 6 year old son - this is my new go to cake!

I made this in a 9x5 loaf pan. It seemed to need about 70 minutes to bake, but then turned out somewhat dry. I actually served it in slices and then drizzled each slice with orange juice. It was topped with whipped topping mixed with orange zest and a little sugar. It turned out fine, but wish the cake was a little more moist. I will try it again, probably in round pans.

I made this exactly as the recipe reads, (I don't feel it's fair to change things and then rate it) except I don't use vegetable oil, I used avocado for a healthier version. Otherwise I didn't deviate. My husband said there's nothing to change about this cake. He loves it.

Great flavor.  Ii substituted 1 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder instead of 3 tsps baking powder. This gave a lighter cake. It is a keeper.  I also used a powdered sugar and orange juice frosting which is lighter and easier to make.

Very easy to make, and so delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and make a layer cake.  My pans are 9" rather than 8", so I only baked them for 25 minutes.  I did double the frosting, as the initial amount was only enough to barely cover the cake.  (What can I say, we like frosting!) My husband loved this so much, I'm making it again just a week later.

- For the sponge - perfect orange cake recipe! Follow directions to a tee and you will not be disappointed.
- For the icing, I wouldn't use all of it... it's makes too much and way too sweet, in my opinion. What I did was used a thin layer between the two layers of cake, more than enough to give it the moistness and richness of a frosted cake.

Very dry, I would not make this again. I am seasoned baker and this cake was not good. I can't understand why there are so many good reviews. The icing was good.

Fabulous cake.  It’s the one I go to every time I’m making an orange batter sponge.  I use the same ingredients but substitute the orange juice for lemon juice to make a lemon batter.  Really fabulous.

I needed a light dessert after Christmas dinner so I used this cake as a 9x13" base for cherry filling, chocolate ganache and crumbled florentine topped with whipped cream. I intensified the orange flavour with 2Tsps concentrate since I didn't have an orange on hand.
It looked festive and my family of cooks all gave it rave reviews. This one's a keeper.

YUMMO!! This cake is awesome!! I mixed regular white sugar with the milk and juice mixture until almost dissolved, then i beat the eggs and added them and a splash of vanilla too. And just plain cream cheese icing for us. Don’t over mix the batter!! Leave a few small lumps. It’s ok. I promise.

This cake is delicious, light, fluffy, and moist! When I made it for a client I did add a little orange food coloring so that it was obviously orange, but the flavor was soo amazing!

There are only two of us, so I halved the recipe, using only one egg.  Instead of icing,  I mixed orange brandy and icing sugar with finely grated orange peel to taste. Poured the glaze on while cake was warm.
Delightful!

I have made this cake twice now, both the times with whole wheat flour and it turned out great. I just doubled the amount of orange zest. My family loved it.

Not enough orange flavor. The cake wasn't as moist as I was hoping. The icing also needs  a lot more orange "punch" to it. I added a teaspoon of orange extract, a tablespoon of zest, a pinch of salt and about a ¼ cup of coconut milk to get it creamier (since juice alone didn't give it the consistency I wanted).

It's delicious, my family gobbled it up! I did tweek it a bit the second time around. Like a previous poster stated, it was a little too much egg. So I substituted an egg for a banana. It just added a hint of banana flavor and made for a more welcoming texture. So banana-orange cake lol. I too added a extra orange zest. I'll definitely be making this more often!

I modified the recipe.  What follows is for 1 loaf pan:

2 c + 4 tbsp cake flour
5 eggs
3/4 c sugar
3/4 c vegetable oil
1 cup fresh orange juice
1.5 tbs baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
4.5 tbs orange rind
1 tsp vanilla extract
15 drops orange oil

It was very moist with excellent consistancy and just the right amount of sweetness.  For the icing,  I used approximately 1/2 c of orange juice, 2 tbs orange peel, and 5 drops orange oil.  Next time I will make it with half the icing sugar only (or skip the icing sugar and use powdered cane sugar instead) and 1 block of cream cheese :)

I actually prefer the cake without the frosting, so you might want to try it before you frost it all up.

Very tasty and moist with a beautiful crumb! I baked my cake in a 9x13 pan which baked in 30 minutes. I used my Tupperware bowl and melted the butter in that fot the oil, then threw all the other cake ingredients in and beat for 2 minutes with my hand mixer. I doubled the zest and added 1/4 tsp orange oil. If you make layers I would double or triple the frosting as I just had enough to cover the top of the 9x13 cake. I didn't have any juice left for the frosting so I used cream and doubled the zest and added 1/4 tsp orange oil. Smells awesome in my house!

Excellent cake.  I used orange marmalade between the layers and used a white chocolate ganache frosting. I added some orange zest and orange extract to the ganache. Superb!!!!

Very easy to make (I went only for the cake). But...the result was disappointing: almost 45 minutes to get done, a ruberry texture and a bland flavour. Eatable while warm, once cold it was just a rubber mix of eggs, sugar, flour and a tiny hint of orange flavour. The proportions of the ingredients should make me think twice, but the reviews were so great that I decided to test it.
Such a waste of electricity, great free range eggs and fragrant oranges!

This was my first attempt at baking any cake ever, and I was so pleased with the results. The only change I made was to up the amount of zest, as I like a strong orange flavor. The cake was perfect, even without any frosting!

This is a very versatile recipe and make a fantastic cake! I made it in a 9 x 13 pan. Have made it twice already and each time it was a big hit.  Once with Frangelico and vanilla to flavor and once with Baileys and vanilla to flavor.  Be sure to use zest and if using fresh oranges throw the pulp in too!!  This will be my go to cake when I need a delicious and easy one to bake and take!

Cake was super easy to make and baked beautiful even layers. I did substitute the milk for buttermilk. I like baking with buttermilk and sour cream ??. I made a 2 tier Baby Shower cake for a customer that request orange flavored cake. She was pleased.

I was making this for a Labor Day cook out so I wanted a bigger cake. I doubled the recipe and put into 3  9" pans. I took other's reviews and doubled the orange zest and added sour cream. It came out perfectly! I had doubled the frosting but realized early on that I needed more so I quadrupled it. Glad I did. Perfect amount of frosting for all 3 layers.

I followed the recipe except added more zest to the batter and icing. Otherwise I did not change anything else. I was interested to make this cake without using a mixer. No mention of a mixer, just mix the wet and dry ingredients. The result was a cake which barely rose. Cake was flat and dry.

I made  this delicious cake in a 13"X9" Pyrex baking dish.  Instead of the  buttercream frosting, I made a simple orange glaze (powdered sugar, orange zest, and orange juice).  When the cake was still just barely warm, I poked holes in it with a toothpick and slowly spread  the glaze over the cake.  Everyone loved this cake!  Thanks for the recipe -- definitely a keeper!

When I asked my son what he wanted for his graduation dessert celebration he responded with, "Something summery & surprise me, ok?" Navel oranges are in season & this recipe fit the requirements I was searching for.  Wonderful, summery, different-from-chocolate-yet-yummy, recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Guests & the Graduate whole heartedly approved of the cake with the bright, fresh orange flavor. I will recommend using a zester specific for fruit.  So much flavor is squeezed out of the light bits of rind scraped from the outside of the fruit.  If there is time, make up some candied orange slices or peel to decorate the cake, so pretty in presentaion.  I am in the process of sending this recipe to a guest who wants to make it for an upcoming event. How much more could one ask for?

This is THE BEST cake recipe!  I have made it numerous times and it is just as good to swap the oranges for lemons and have a lemon version.  I am always looking for recipes that convert to organic and healthy eating versions. I substitute Coconut oil for the oil and that adds a WONDERFUL touch to the flavor!  DELICIOUS!!

I made this cake to use up a bunch of my oranges. After reading all of the reviews I was hoping for a cake with lots of fresh orange flavor. The cake was moist but I didn't get much orange. I will probably try this recipe again because I had to use baking soda and vinegar in place of the eggs and i put too much milk Even with what I did wrong it did not taste bad but it didn't have as much orange as I wanted it too. Next time I may add more zest as others suggested

This is a really tasty cake with a wonderful texture. Such a nice flavor change from the traditional cake flavors! My husband loves the cake and says it is light, flavorful and not overpowering with sweetness. I made a loaf, no frosting, and it was devoured by family and friends in one sitting. I made it again with the icing and that icing was really great also! You need to double the icing recipe if you want to have enough frosting between 2 layers and cover two 8" rounds, though. I followed instructions exactly but added a tiny bit more zest to the frosting mixture. Nice and tangy! Thanks for this recipe!

This is by far the easiest and best tasting cake to make in a flash;  It really is One bowl! I get rave reviews EVERYTIME I make it and the requests for it are overwhelming. Super impressive with not a huge amount of effort. Highly recommend it for a first date, family dinner, or special occasion.

This is an absolutely delicious cake. I made it with fresh squeezed orange juice and also added a little lemon juice to the frosting to break up the confectioner sugar taste. Was very well received by everyone!

This was very good! My couple of nit picky  complaints are that I'd like more orange flavor, and the frosting was too sweet and there wasn't enough of it. I used buttermilk in place of regular milk and added some orange extract. I'm wondering if I used orange concentrate in place of the OJ next time, would it be orangey enough?  I think I'll try that. There will definitely be a next time:)

i LOVE this cake recipe. Quick, easy and very yummy!  The only changes I made was I added a little orange extract to the frosting and cake batter only because my hubby REALLY likes orange.  I also spread orange marmalade between the layers.  I made this for a friends birthday and it was the first dessert to go with friends asking for the recipe.  A true 10 on my yummy scale!  Thanks for sharing it

I added 1 tsp of orange extract to both the batter and the icing plus 2 Tbsp Grand Marnier to the batter.  Volume was just right for two 9" round pans.  This is a simple, easy recipe that pleased family and guests.

The cake turned out a little dry.  I changed the recipe by using 2 eggs instead of 3.  I used 1 teaspoon orange extract and reduced sugar to 1 cup.  Next time I make this cake I would add sour cream to it.  I also used a different recipe for frosting.

Great recipe.  I've always made this as written, but today I followed some reviewers advice and added 2 tbsp of triple sec and a 1/4 cup of sour cream to the batter (I also added some green and red jimmies to make it more Christmasy).  I baked it in a bundt pan for 40 minutes then glazed it (1 1/4 c powdered sugar, 2 tbsp orange juice and 1/2 tsp vanilla.)

Perfect just the way it is.  I baked in a 9 inch loaf pan and used a simple orange glaze instead of frosting. Perfect with coffee in the morning.

This is a nice, simple cake.  It is moist, but was a little heavy.  I used Simple Orange Glaze from this site, and it added more orange flavor.  I will make this again, but will follow the advice of other reviewers who added more orange flavor - either zest or extract.  Thanks for posting.

I initially made this cake exactly per the instructions/recipe.  It was fairly good, but a little dry and not as much orange flavor as I had hoped.  Could just be my preference however.  I did alter the recipe for something akin to 5 stars which I will submit later.  All in all, this was good and also presents very well

I would give this 3.5 to 4 stars. It is good and the recipe is very easy... The frosting is really good (did I even have to say that? LOL) It is a bit dryer than I like, but some of the reviews have solutions for that. I meant to add the sour cream, but forgot it. The taste is good, but I did use the zest from two whole oranges and used a third in the frosting and the rest in the cake batter.

This is a delicious cake with a light and fluffy texture. The flavor is perfect and it's just sweet enough. I actually like it best without frosting and will be making this again without a doubt. 

Note: I didn't have superfine sugar on hand, so I substituted regular granulated sugar and found the texture to be great as is.

So quick, easy and tasty.  Here's how it was changed (hoping to reduce caloric intake):  Halved the recipe, using two large eggs, a bit of Grand Marnier with the OJ, and only 1/2 cup sugar.  I like sweets, but nothing overly sweet and don't care much for frosting either.
Baked them in a cupcake pan, using 1/4 cup measure, which made 10 nice sized cupcakes.  Used the convection oven at 325 for 25 mins., then dusted powdered sugar on top.  Perfectly wonderful sweet for me; this will definitely be made again.

This is the only birthday cake that my very fussy daughter actually liked! We've tried red velvet with cream cheese icing, Betty Crocker chocolate with buttercream icing, chocolate sponge cake with fondant and buttercream, a biscuit crumb topped cheesecake, and now finally this lovely moist orangey cake was the winner. After discovering that her favourite ice cream was a Solero - like an orange creamsicle - I was keen to find an orange & vanilla flavoured cake. This was a hit for everyone.

The recipe was too dense and too crumbly.  After reading reviews about the lack of orange flavor, I decided to add 2 oranges worth of zest to the batter and 3 Tbsp. Orange Liquor, but the cake still tasted bland.  Very disappointing.

Far too much wrong with this recipe. I should have followed my instinct and added vanilla or orange extract to the cake and decreased the eggs to two. Orange zest is far too oily for the frosting and keeps it from remaining fluffy and actually makes the ingredients separate. The cake was very bland and extremely heavy.

Ok so I followed this recipe to the letter, and even though I hade my mouth set for that creamy frosting my hubbz wanted a glaze. (One cup confectioners sugar, 1 tb spoon orange zest, 3 t-spoons oj... Adjust to your liking) OMG.... AMAZING!!! Will be making again!! Tips for the glaze... Put fork holes throughout the top.... I made in a bundt pan... And it needed about 90 minutes in the oven. But I poured the glaze while the cake was still hot and let it sit overnight.... Hubbz loved it!!

Flawless! 
this recipe resulted in a perfect cake! 
I used orange glaze instead of buttercream frosting and added chocolate chunks to the cake batter towards the end. Follwed the rest of the recipe as it is and it was amazing! Loved it

I made this for my Christmas Day gathering and it was such a big hit! The only change I made was a slight reduction of sugar and I used an orange cream cheese frosting. Fresh, light, and bright flavor. Nice height on the cake. Yummy!

I love this cake. I normally don't tweek the ingredients on baked items but used real oranges so I reduced the amount of sugar to one cup. It turned out awesome. I also used this to make some Pettit fours and they turned out better than ever. I gave it four stars because I agreed with another review about it needing some more orange,I fixed that by adding a bit more zest. You can definitely add more or less orange flavor to suit your preferences.

This is a delicious cake! I made it for my mother in laws 87th birthday. I changed the steps in how the ingredients were blended using an electric hand mixer. Beat the eggs, add the oil, sugar, orange zest, orange juice (fresh squeezed). After measuring and combining the dry ingredients I added the dry ingredients to the wet in 3 portions alternating flour and milk. I used Almond milk instead of cow's milk. So moist and delicious!

My family loved this cake! I used 1T of orange zest in the cake batter like many reviewers suggested.  This cake with the orange zest frosting is the bomb!

So far I've only tried the batter, I made it double to top a another double batter choclate cake for a HUGE cake... the batter was so yummy!! and I didn't even put any zest cuz I didn't have fresh oranges... can't wait to try it done....  The consistency of the batter was beautiful, and fluffed up so nicely... let's see how it turns out ;) Yum yum

The frosting is AWESOME!!! Great with fresh strawberries, too!  The cake is good, but I agree with other reviews...it does need more orange flavor.  Next time I make this I will definitely bump up the citrus in the cake.  Very good!

My husband brought home some oranges from his co-workers tree. I made this recipe into cupcakes and they came out fantastic! I did increase the amount of orange zest and brushed the tops of the cooling cupcakes with a mixture of Frangelico liquer and orange oil. They were light and moist with just the right amount of orange flavor. I sprinkled toasted chopped almonds over the frosting and my husband went nuts for them, and he is not a dessert person at all.

I used one cup of ground roasted hazelnuts in place of one of the cups of flour, and doubled the amount of orange zest and orange juice. Added half a cup of coconut flour, which is a great cake flour (very fine, like cake flour). RAVE reviews. I will definitely make this again. (I also used freshly squeezed orange juice)

Thank you very much for the simple and delicious recipe. I'm very pleased for the result. Even my husband, for the first time he likes the cake I make. And for the frosting I used melted chocolate mixed with icing sugar because I didn't make the cake sweet enough plus my daughter loves chocolate frosting. At the end it looked amazing.

The only reason I am giving this cake a 4 star instead of 5 is because I used a special ingredient in mine. I substituted the oil for some speshial blood orange olive oil. Awwww...So good! So it amped up the orange flavoring. But I am sure it would be really good without the orange oil.

My niece wanted an orange cupcakes for her birthday.  Having never made an orange cake recipe, I read several recipes and chose this one.  The instructions are easy to follow; the ingredients blend very well together; the prep time is very accurate.  I baked 12 regular-sized cupcakes and 24 mini-cupcakes for 15 minutes at 350°F, and they turned out beautifully.  Since I was baking the recipe as cupcakes, I did not substitute with pudding or sour cream, but if I bake this as a cake, I the substitution, because I can see where some dryness might occur.  We have several diabetics in our family, and so I made an even substitution of Truvia for sugar, and no one could tell the difference.

I left several of the cupcakes un-iced, and I thought those were better.  I followed the icing recipe, but it never set and was extremely sweet.  I thought the icing overpowered the cupcakes, and I could not eat the iced ones.  I have added the cake recipe to my box, but I will keep looking for a complementary icing recipe.  The icing is what kept me from giving this overall recipe five stars.

Really a nice cake, nice and light. I used spenda/sugar mix and used more than a tablespoon of orange zest. Baked at 325 in a 9x13 for 35 min.
