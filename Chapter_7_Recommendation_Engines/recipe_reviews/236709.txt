This was very good.. I subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I wasn't sure about cooking this on high temp but I went ahead... it turned out great. I am sure you could also cook this on low for 5-6 hours and have it be great as well

I made this chicken recipe last night and it was absolutely delicious. First of all to get it out of the way: The recipe calls for 2 individual peppers - not 2 cans of peppers. I love chipotles, so I used 3 whole peppers along with a little extra adobo sauce and the spiciness was on point. I subbed non fat greek yogurt for the sour cream, and next time I think I will also substitute low fat cream cheese instead of full fat. I was able to throw this all in the crock pot during my lunch break and cooked it on low for 5.5 hours. So yummy and easy. I definitely think you can add whatever you want to the chicken, I know I will be adding some roasted corn when I have it over cauliflower rice next time... along with cilantro. Gotta have some of that in there.

jennbo your problem was adding 2 cans, the recipe calls for only 2 peppers from the can. Hope this helps you. I use chipotle all the time and it is a delicious flavor to anything.

This was excellent. I sautéed the onions in 3 tbs of butter instead of oil and added 5 cloves of crushed garlic instead of 2. I also used 3 chipotle peppers instead of 2. The result was a delicious, spicy, creamy sauce like no other sauce I've ever made before. Great recipe!

This one of my favorite recipes off the app! I love it! I made a few additions though. First, I used 4 chipotle peppers. This might be too much for some, but I love chipotle so it was perfect for me. Also, I added one russet potato to make the dish a bit more filling. I would recommend doing this if you eat a lot like I do. I Peeled and chopped the potato and added it into the slow cooker at the same time as the chicken. I have made this dish once with sour cream. This last time I tried Greek yogurt has others have suggested and found that it tastes just as amazing. Finally, I added a bag of roasted corn and one chopped tomato with the yogurt and cream cheese. This dish was excellent served with cilantro lime white rice

We took this to a potluck and ended up bringing 2/3rds of it home so evidently we weren't the only ones who didn't like it.

Thankfully some reviewers cleared that up about just 2 peppers out of a can of chipotle chili sauce that's listed in recipe.  I would have been one of those cooks that would have added 2 cans!!!  Whew!  Anyway, this is what I ended up doing:  I had some leftover rott. chicken so I shredded it and coated it with some Mrs. Dash Chipotle Seasoning, added the "1" pepper with some sauce, mixed it all up good and put in the crockpot.  Laid the sliced onions and diced garlic on top.  Instead of the water and chicken bouillon powder I heated up some rich chicken broth I had on hand (I forgot to follow directions about adding the pepper, onion and garlic and then blending...will do this next time!)and poured over chicken mixture.  Cooked on low around 3 hours.  Served this with corn chips, sour cream and salsa.  Believe me, this was delicious.  Of course I plan to make according to recipe next time but honestly I don't see how it could taste any better.

We eat a lot of chicken, but this is in our top 5 favorite main dish chicken recipes!  The flavors in the sauce were perfect (creamy with a little kick…).  The recipe involves little prep work, so it's great for a yummy weeknight dinner.  I served this with warm flour tortillas, but it would also be great over mashed potatoes or rice.  Thank you, Mazola!

this dish is reminiscent of a dish called pollo con crema that is served in some Mexican restaurants. I've used my own experience making Mexican food to improve this dish. First I added a whole can of chipotle sauce, the Costeña brand. it has some other ingredients and spices to improve the flavor.  in addition I used chicken stock instead of water and added a couple cubes of chicken bullion.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of Ancho chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle powder.  and instead of sour cream I used Mexican crema, which is very similar to sour cream but less sour and more runny.  I then added half queso blanco and half cream cheese.  I skipped cilantro and added a diced Fresno chili instead to add some color.  MUCH better and more authentic.  give it a try I'm sure people won't send it home.

Very tasty, doubled the chipotle peppers.  Cooked on low for a couple of extra hours so that I could get a head start on dinner.  To keep it low carb I served over salad- no dressing needed, the sauce does it all!

I was looking for an alternative to  bbq pulled chicken for a quick weeknight meal.  I just  shredded the chicken and returned it to the cooking liquid before adding the sour cream.  This was a great balance of creamy and smokey.  We ended up adding a good bit more chipotle hot sauce to get the spiciness level we like, but we'll defiantly be making this again.

My family loves this recipe! I made it as written the first time and it turned out fine. I like being able to cook it for a longer amount of time though, and my family loves their sauce and their spice, so here is what I normally do now: double the broth, double the peppers. I put it in the crockpot on low for 7 hours, take out the chicken, then add the sour cream/cream cheese mixture, stir it up, replace the chicken and turn to coat. Then I turn the crockpot to warm while I finish up the side dishes. It turns out wonderfully every time! Thank you for the recipe!

i enjoyed this meal. It came out super spicy. I'm not sure what i did wrong. However, it was a very tasty dish. Not recommended for people who can't eat spicy.

Very good over rice. We enjoyed ours on a bed of white sticky rice with a squirt of lime on the chicken. Avocado and cilantro add to the flavor as well.

I think this is the first recipe in a long time that my husband truly complimented. He must have said 'this is really good' three times during dinner. Only change was using yogurt instead of sour cream. Will make again and again.

Only had 5 oz frozen chicken breasts to use, but wasn't a big fan on presentation with the end result... tasted pretty good for flavor when we served on taco flavored rice & salsa, but just didn't look very pretty when served up. Also missed a cooking aroma when the chicken didn't throw off a great smell while it cooked until the very end. It also took about 5 hours before I even trusted the chicken was cooked through enough. I did add a small amount of chicken broth to help add some moisture at the beginning. This recipe finished reminded me of boiled chicken...rather than a slow cooked chicken recipe in soup or broth. We tried another similar recipe and that one had turned out much better. I think I'd try this again but would not 'puree' the contents and just cook them without the blender. Almost like it made the ingredients too broke down...

Not bad.  Family decided like it, don't love it.  I used 3 chipotle peppers and added tsp red pepper flakes and stil found the sour cream overpowering.  I did use  all low fat and not fat cream cheese and sour cream which may change the rich flavour.  I'm sure we'll make it again just to change things up.  Thank you for sharing

This recipe was SO good and realllly easy!  I skipped out on using the food processor to make it even easier and to save dishes and it still turned out wonderfully!  I'm adding this to my usual list of meals to make!
