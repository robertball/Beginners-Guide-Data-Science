This was a really good pizza! This recipe is very easy to put together and strays a way from the ordinary pepperoni and cheese for a nice change of pace.  I think you could easily swap marinara sauce for the bbq sauce and have a fun take of sausage and peppers on a pizza. Great pizza!

We loved this!  The flavors worked perfectly together for a savory pizza.  The bbq sauce was a great touch.  Plus, it is so easy to throw together.  I made a homemade crust that had additional herbs in it, and I'm so happy I prebaked the crust on 425 for a few minutes (after brushing lightly with olive oil), because the small amount of extra water from the veggies would have made it very soggy if I didn't pre bake before topping.  I am making this again tonight!

This pizza was amazing. After cutting the sausage, I fried it along with cut mushrooms until they were browned and added that to the thinly sliced green peppers and onions on the crust. I also used a pepper jack cheese and hot regular sausage, since that is what I had. So good! I will definitely make this again.
