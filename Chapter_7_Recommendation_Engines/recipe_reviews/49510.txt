This recipe was very easy and quite good.  I used red wine instead of white because that's what I had.  And I supplemented the feta with a bit of blue cheese, because I didn't have quite enough feta.  And it was all delicious!  I think this dish would also be very good if you mashed the chickpeas slightly and used it as a filling for pita sandwiches (maybe with fresh sliced tomatoes, cucumber and ???)

This was cheap and easy to make. We served it on pita bread with a side salad. Yummy!

As per my previous posting I'm back to tell you this freezes very well. I froze it in portions (for work) w/ (cannned, rinsed, drained) chickpeas that had been sauteed w/ olive oil, onion & garlic, & with brown rice portions (cooked in orange juice). As always, I let all components come to room temp, then chilled overnight in the fridge b/f freezing. When I re-heated at work the meal was only partially thawed but still turned out well. Of course if frozen/only part-thawed, microwave at Low for best results.

Wow, this is delicious!  I followed the recipe except for not draining the tomatoes, then poured the whole lot over some chicken breasts and baked them for about 1/2 hour - really really good.

Excellent recipe! I followed the suggestions of others and 1)didn't drain the tomatoes 2)added a little extra garlic, plus some basil and rosemary 3)added the feta cheese upon serving the dish, rather than cooking it for 5 minutes 4) added spinach and mushrooms and 5) squeezed fresh lemon juice over the dish just before serving. Definitely making again!

Very yummy.  Went great with grilled tuna.  Wouldn't change a thing at all.  Make sure you slowly cook the onions/garlic/oregano.  It is definately a sweat, not a saute or you'll burn the oregano.  Thanks much, this will be made again.

I was looking for a new chickpea recipe, and I really enjoyed this. It was good on basmati rice, but also really good on a soft baguette, and also to dip my pita chips in. A good excuse to enjoy a glass of wine. Easy and creative! Love it.

This was really good with a little cinnamon and basil added. I did not drain the tomatoes, and took the suggestion of one reviewer to add the feta just before serving for a more attractive dish. I think it would also be good with the addition of some currants or raisins to balance the flavors, but it is delicious as is.

This recipe has become a weekly favorite in my family. I usually change almost every recipe I make but not this one! The only thing that's not specified is the kind of feta used. I use good quality sheep's milk feta because it's much tastier than cow's milk.

Really easy and very tasty! I used a Riesling and it had a really nice flavor. I also added some cubes of tofu for extra protein. Also, the tomatoes I used had garlic and oregano already in them, and I added some rosemary to it. I didn't have any onion and it still turned out great.

My mother-in-law loves garbanzo beans so I've made this a couple of times when she visits.  We both like it but I'm always surprised that it isn't more flavorful with all of the delicious ingredients.  Haven't really had time to tweak the recipe yet but have added fresh spinach and that worked well.  This is nice for a fun and different side dish.

This is a great vegetarian dish. I doubled the recipe, left out the cheese due to allergies, substituted red wine vinegar, and used fresh tomatoes. I also added half a bag of frozen chopped spinach. Delicious!

This was not good at all.  I'm a huge fan of feta cheese and garbanzo beans so it was very disappointing for me.  Plus it just didn't look appetizing.  Maybe if I had sprinkled the cheese afterwards, instead of letting it melt into the goo...

I liked this recipe as a base for my own additions.  I used fresh cilantro instead of oregano, and red wine instead of white.  I steamed some zucchini on the side and served this delicious stew over couscous with a bit of smoked sausage (as a garnish more than a meat) and a Mexican crumbled cheese I had on hand.  Oh, and per others' recommendations, I squeezed fresh lemon juice on as I served it.  Yum!  I'm so glad I doubled the recipe and have dinner in the freezer for a busy day!

This is one of my favorite side dish recipes. I use a small can (8oz) of tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and I serve it over rice or chicken. Really delicious- especially the next day!

VERY good!  I, too, had some chickpeas and feta and not much else in the kitchen, so I tried it.  Followed the recipe precisely and loved it!  You could make it a meal by adding a starch or protein, or eat it right out of a bowl, as I did.

as some other reviewers recommended, i didn't drain the tomatoes. i also didn't measure the garlic, but probably put in a little more than it called for. i poured the mixture, minus the feta, over some boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked it for 30 minutes at 350. i added the feta when i took it out of the oven so the cheese was just barely melted. delicious! my dish only had room for two chicken breasts, but this recipe made enough to top three or four.

This was a great dish.  I also did not drain the tomatoes.  I added a little cumin to the onions and served the dish over turmeric cous cous.  My husband thought that it was too dry over the cous cous, so I will probably add more liquid to the bean/tomato mixture next time.  Thank you, this was great!

I used Blue Cheese instead of Feta and tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes and I thought the sauce came out great, but next time I'd use less oregano and I would maybe try it over pasta instead of rice.

Excellent vegetarian recipe and easy to prepare. My boyfriend and I went back for 2nds and then there wasn't any. 

I added 1 cup of feta instead of the 3/4 cup and it was wonderful.

My family loved this-quite a surprise that it was so satisfying without meat. I used 1 c. feta and per another's suggestion served it with the Barley Bake from this site (I added 1T basil to the bake). Next time I'll double it to make the portions of the two recipes come out even.  Thank you, Jen, we'll have this again!

4-15-07. This was easy to make, and tasted wonderful, just per recipe.  Used as a side dish with roasted leg of lamb, brown basmati rice and simple green salad for a wonderful Sunday dinner with friends.

I didn't like this recipe.  The ingredients were just that: ingredients - they did not really work together...

It was edible, but I wouldn't make it again.

This was simple to make, but while it tasted good, it wasn't anything really special.  A good meal for tonight, but I probably won't make it again.

I loved all the ingredients in this, but was quite disappointed in the results. It was bland and non very exciting. Heated the leftovers and served it on top of rice, then it was a bit better. Won't make again though..

This is pretty much made out of all my favorite ingredients, but somehow it just didn't appeal to me. I wanted to like it and appreciated all the favorable reviews, but it just wasn't that great in my opinion.

I made this for my boyfriend a few weeks ago and he LOVED it.  I added more garlic than called for (I love garlic) and tossed chicken in with it then served it over penne pasta.  It was a really great summery meal!

This is VERY good, especially for a vegetarian recipe. If you aren't a vegetarian, throw a couple of chicken breasts on top and serve it with brown rice. Delicious.

Awesome! Added extra garlic, a jalapeno, a handful of chopped baby spinach, and didn't drain the tomatoes. Also felt it needed something to add depth to all the bright flavors, so I added some paprika and a little smoked paprika, and I think that helped balance it out. My fiance, who's a meat eater (I'm veg), said upon taking his first bite "If only people knew how good vegetarian cuisine could be!" Then he added something about chickpeas being the new steak :) Served this hearty dish over couscous and will certainly make it again.

Followed recipe precisely except adding the oregano just before the tomatoes.  I served it over baby spinach and loved loved the combo.  I love how easy this is with so much coming out of cans - only 1 onion to chop!  Could probably cut back on the cheese to be healthier without losing much.  Even though its a lot, though, I love cheese!

This is now one of my favorite meals! I added a bit of cooked chicken I had left over, but that was it. My mom didn't care for it, but that's only because she doesn't like feta. Thanks!

So great!!! We did not miss the meat in any way with this recipe. I can't wait to eat the leftovers! I used 2 fresh tomatoes instead of canned and broth instead of wine and it was so fantastic. I'll bet it's even more fantastic with wine!!! Thank you, thank you for the recipe :)

Inexpensive, and so delicious!  We did a whole cup of Feta, but I'm guessing that there is a difference between a packed 3/4c and loose 1c.  We also sauteed some shrimp first, to boost the protein for my pregnant vegetarian wife!

I served it on a simple lemon rice pilaf(regular rice with some juice and zest, onions, a little thyme).  Amazing!  One of the best on the site.

The ingredients sounded strange to me... but since I had a huge amount of feta on hand I decided to try it.  I used seasoned diced tomatoes and didn't drain them.  I have to say this was quite good over rice!  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't like oregano, so I used basil instead and this came out very good. It's a very simple, quick, and tasty dish.  I served it with rice pilaf, which complimented the beans well.

I was suprised that this didnt turn out well.  All of the other reviews praised this dish, but I found it to be very bland and not appetizing.  I love all of the ingredients seperately, but this mixture was not optimal.  I hope I will eat the leftovers, but I have a suspicion they will just end up down the sink.

We love this and it's definitely a go-to.  Made it as-written the first time and it was delicious.  Now I add almost any other veggies I have on hand and oftentimes chicken or chicken sausage to make it a main dish.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe.   So versatile and we love it.

Works great with red or white wine.  Serve with rice or egg noodles.

Decided to give this recipe a try as I was looking for something to go with risotto and roasted asparigus for a vegetarian dinner party. As some other reviewers suggested, I used tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes; and red wine instead of white and it turned out quite well. Because some reviewers did not care for the feta cheese, I split the finished product into two separate serving dishes - added feta cheese to one and parmesan reggiano to the other. Between the two, the feta version was by far my and my guests preference.

Delicious flavor.  I used only half a red onion and used pinot grigio.  I served it with pita bread.

A very good starting point for a vegetarian meal. A few modifications: I used only half of an onion chopped, and cooked it with 1/2 cup of fresh sliced onions for about 10 minutes before adding the garlic, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and just 1 tsp of oregano (because that's all there was left). I'm glad I didn't add a full tbsp, because it may have been overpowering. I simmered the tomatoes and wine as directed, then added just the chickpeas to let simmer for another 10-15 minutes to really get the flavours blended. Based on other reviews, I just sprinkled the feta on the dish at the end to keep it looking as good as it did while it simmered!

Served it with brown rice cooked in vegetable broth to get a full protein. Excellent!

The flavor of this recipe was great.  I added chopped up pieces of kale to give it even more of a nutritional boost.  The kale tasted delcious sauteed with the melted feta.

This dish lacks color and flavor.  I would suggest using some frozen corn for color & flavor as well as well as extra spices.  I would also suggest more feta cheese as well as perhaps some red pepper.  I served this with whole wheat spaghettini and topped with grated parmesan cheese.

This looked awful, but tasted pretty good.  I didn't drain the tomatoes as others suggested and added extra feta (although I don't think that was neccessary).  I would also suggest using less oregeno.

Wow!  I love this.  I think I may used fresh spicy oregano next time.  Other than that, perfecto!

Great, but with a few tweaks: I did not use a whole onion because that seemed a little excessive. I also did not drain the tomatoes, then added a litle more wine and threw in some orzo to soak up the extra liquid. I added basil as well. Great flavor, and tasted even better the next day!

This is excellent.  I used white beans instead of chickpeas because I had none, and I actually found the consistency of the white beans more suitable.  I paired it with a recipe called 'Barley Bake' on allrecipes.  It was a fabulous dinner!

I really liked this.  It was surprisingly full of flavor for such few ingredients.  I would recommend putting the feta sprinkled on top each serving rather than mixing it into the dish.  It made the dish look really pretty and it tasted good, too!
