I loved the flavors that the marinade imparted along with the grilled flavor of the meat. Due to my family's tender tongues however I did make some changes. I reduced the red pepper flakes in the marinade to 1/2 teaspoon omitted the fresh hot chilies altogether and roasted the red pepper whole on the grill then chopped it. Then I threw everything into my slow cooker using 2 (14oz) cans (undrained) of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of fresh. It gave just enough of a bite to make my 9 year old wimper and saved us old folks some grief in the chest area! I can't imagine all that pepper though...ouch! This is definitely a keeper!
