The only reason I am only rating this at 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the sauce is SUPPER SWEET.  I am going to play around with the amount of sugar & honey, but the overall flavor is great.  I ended up using chicken breats (rather than wings).  I cut each chicken breasts into 4 pieces and cooked the chicken in the sauce for about 15 minutes.  Took the chicken out of the sauce (covered to keep warm) and then cranked up the heat, for about another 10-15 minutes, to thicken the sauce (be sure to stir more frequently as the sauce gets thinker).

Yummy and sticky.  Excellent taste and I kept gong back for more along with everyone else.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I did start with frozen chicken wings so I simmered them with the cover on about 50 minutes and without the cover about 40 minutes.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.

Super good!  Thank you, Shannon.

No peanut butter in this house, tahini made a great substitute.  Cut sugar by 1/3 - 1/2.  Thickened sauce with a bit of cornstarch and baked @ 375, 40 minutes covered,  20 minutes uncovered.

Nothing left.  YUM!!!

If I could give this more stars I would - thank you Shannon!!  This was absolutely fantastic!!!  No changes needed.  This recipe is so much easier than a similar chinese one I have, but it doesn't take over 2 hours to bake and turn and I LOVE that I don't have to take the time to marinate!!!  We all loved it and I'm making it another time this week - but tonight I'll used boneless thighs.  I hope others discover and use this recipe!

I made this recipe today and it came out amazing. I used drumsticks instead of wings, and chunky peanut butter, which worked since the peanuts added the extra crunch. I also used splenda instead of sugar. I simmered them covered for 30 minutes, then finished them in the oven for another 30 minutes so they got that golden brown carmelized feel. Great Recipe.

Very tasty. The family truly enjoyed these wings. The only thing we were missing is a little crispiness. I think next time I will prepare in the broiler or something. This is a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was delicious!!  My husband and 4 kids (ages 11, 9, 7, and 3) and I all l.o.v.e.d. it!  My husband was leery because he doesn't like "weird" food (peanut butter + soy sauce = weird in his book), but he ended up loving it!!  It was so disappointing when it was gone!  I used 12 drumsticks instead of wings because that's what I had.  I made the sauce as written, just tripled it to make sure there was enough for the drumsticks (no sesame seeds on hand though).  It was so very easy to do and the family's favorite meal in a long time!  This will be on a regular rotation!  It was *very* sticky, but worth it!
We served it with Japanese noodles and sliced bell peppers.  I'm going to try the sauce with shrimp or chicken over pasta or rice so we can eat it with a fork and it might be less messy.  It was oh so good!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe Shannon!

This is a great go-to dish; Ingredients  I usually have on hand, nothing too exotic. I just dumped everything in the pan, checked on it occassionally & it turned out great.
Next time I will half the sugar, add more garlic and maybe some scallions. 
Thanks, Shannon!

This was a tough one for me.  I was in that group of folks where the sauce just would not thicken.  I did add a touch of cornstarch and when that wouldn't work fast enough a touch of flour- and that helped but these did not caramelize for me or get "sticky" as others had described.  When I finally served them to my husband who prefers fried wings, he was very disappointed that the skin was still soft and fat-like.  So, I threw the whole pan under the broiler for about 8-10 minutes then flipped for another 8-10 and my husband said "they were saved!"  So, the broiler thickened the sauce, the wings caremelized and darkened and the skin crisped up.  So, hopefully this helps others that may have had similar issues. Tasted very good in the end- fall apart tender- just took me a lot longer to get there!

OH MY YUMMY!!!!!! I made this in the electric skillet just like the recipe. I did everything just as directed and this is hands down the best and only way I will make wings from now until eternity! I know it is good when I look up to see my family members up to their elbows in sauce with sauce all over their faces licking fingers and asking for more!

as another reviewer said, I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could. Incredibly easy to make, and more importantly, incredibly easy to prepare. No marinating necessary, no complex preparation or cooking method. Amazing.
I personally didn't change anything, and I'm not sure I would unless I had to.

Easy to prepare and delicious. The first time we tried it we stuck to the recipe and loved the wings.  The second time we used boneless skinless chicken beasts, added some hot pepper paste to give it a little kick and sliced the cooked breasts into strips.  It was terrific in a salad with a ginger soy dressing.

I liked this but cut down on the sugar and still thought it was too sweet.  The sauce reminded me of cracker jacks, which isn't bad but too sweet for my taste.  I think next time I'll just eliminate the sugar and maybe use a little more honey.

Delicious!  I will be making this a lot!  I used a package of about 12 drumsticks.  Couldn't fit all in one skillet so doubled sauce and put half the sauce and drumsticks in one skillet, and half in the other.  Cooked covered on the stove for 30 minutes then poured everything into one 9x13 baking dish and baked in over, uncovered, for 20 minutes.  Perfectly done;  it might be just as good cooked in the skillets the whole time.  I wanted them to be browned on top.  The only downside was having to wash 2 skillets.  I'll have to get a bigger one just for this recipe.  Yum, just yum.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this! I used most of the ingredients as a baseline (water, a pinch of sugar, 3 cloves of garlic, soy sauce, salt). I also added onion powder, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, and 1/2 tsp of garlic hot sauce. Came out wonderful!!! Served over rice.

Finger licking good!  I only used about 1 1/2 T of peanut butter and the flavor was still dominant so I added a little more soy sauce and that helped.  It also wouldn't thicken up for me very much so I took the juices out of the pan, added a little cornstarch and cook it til it thickened, then threw it back in the pan with the wings and cranked up the heat until it reduced a bit.  When I took them out of the pan the sauce stuck pretty well.  The meat is so tender and has great flavor!

Great wings!  Love that they didn't have to be fried first.  Like several others, my sauce never really thickened ... wonder why it works for some and not for others?  Used a bag of Tyson frozen wings, but thought I had 24, so doubled the sauce, but way too much sauce, since "24" meant they were already split.   Ended up actually pouring off some of the sauce while trying to cook down the sauce, but still never really thickened.   Flavor was still great, and may try this again with the boneless chicken breast and served over rice ... bet that would be amazing, too!

These are so easy and delicious!  The only thing I changed was to take the wings out at the end, and crank up the heat a bit on the sauce to thicken it.  Once it's thick, I add the wings back in, coat, and serve.

this was wonderful i was weary about it not being crunchy however the meat just fell off the bones and the flavor was great i'm not a peanut butter person but it just gives the chicken a slight nutty flavor!

Oh my word ... SOOOOOOOoooooo good!!! :)  Made them for the family for Superbowl and they were sticky and tangy and absolutely a winner.  I kept dipping carrot sticks into the sauce 'cos I couldn't get enough of it.  My daughter was hesitant when she saw peanut butter going into the sauce but you can't taste the peanut butter at all.  It just adds to the overall flavour.  Will definitely be making this again.  SO easy and delicious! :)

We loved this one!  We didn't have wings, so I used thighs. I cut them into smaller pieces, nugget-sized. One of the other reviews commented on trouble with the sauce carmelizing, so I put the chicken and sauce in the oven for the second 30 minute instead of on the stove top. I used a cast iron skillet to cook the sauce and chicken, so it transferred to the oven nicely. The chicken was in the oven at 350 F for 15 minutes, and 400 F for the final fifteen. The sauce was wonderful, served with the chicken over a wild rice mix.

Awesome!  The only thing I did differently was broiled them on each side to crisp them up a bit at the end.  The recipe was just perfect!!

Was nervous about using red wine vinegar b/c  I don't use it often& that was all I dad & I did used a little less sugar as most suggested. My husband LOVED it. I did however have to cook it longer for it to thicken but worth the wait.

I am rating and the reviewing the sauce only, as I have my own method of preparing wings.  Based on other reviews, I halved the amount of sugar used and the level of sweetness was perfect for us.  We are  big fans of sweet with a little kick, so I added a generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper.  I mixed all of the sauce ingredients in my electric skillet and cooked until slightly thickened.  I then coated wings that had been boiled for 10 minutes and placed them on a broiling pan and broiled the wings on each side for about 5 minutes to give them a little crispiness.  I then returned the wings to the electric skillet with the remaining sauce and continued to simmer uncovered until the sauce completely carmelized.  Delish!!

Sticky, Gooey, Yummy, Delicious! OMG we LOVED these wings. I was worried because I love my wings crispy and as these were cooking I figured they would be somewhat soggy. Although they weren't crispy (don't think these wings are meant to be crispy) they were perfect. I followed the recipe but did brown them first. I also didn't have a problem with the sauce not thickening. Me and my hubby gobbled these up quick, and he said I should definitely make these again. I will make them again and eat the entire plate by myself LOL. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a big hit. I left out the wine vinegar and used brown sugar in place of white sugar but this recipe was amazing and so easy to make. They are already asking for it again. Thank you.

This recipe is very simple but the rewards are plentiful. I made these for my boyfriend during Sunday football and he loveeddd them. I added a bit of hot sauce and crushed pepper so they weren't too sweet. I definitely added bacon for flavor!!!!!!!

my family loved these wings!!!! I didn't think they were too sweet at all & It was so easy to make that I made a second batch for everyone's lunch tomorrow. Only thing different that I did was cooked the wings first in a pressure cooker then used the skillet with the sauce for 20 mins, no lid and the came out perfectly sticky. I did use a hint of brown sugar with the white sugar because I didn't have any honey on hand.

This is a very easy recipe that makes yummy wings.  The hint of peanut butter peaks through giving these wings a nice twist from our usual wings.  Our sauce caramelized beautifully giving the wings a beautiful sticky coating - be sure to have plenty of napkins on hand.

I came across this recipe and decided to try it from the rave reviews. My bf came home, tasted the sauce and was amazed. Later he simply said "Best. Dinner. Ever." I only had chicken tenderloins instead of wings and cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar but was still amazing.

YUM!!!!  The sauce rocks.  But it seemed like a waste to use it with chicken wings.  I made some rice to eat with it and that was the highlight to me.  I want to make this again, but use a chicken breast instead of wings.  Throw in some stir fry veggies and this will be 5 star.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe! It was so convenient to have almost everything in my pantry already. I did not have honey and I used Asian vinegar rather than wine vinegar because that is what I had. I am not entirely sure what the difference is; they still turned out fantastic! The texture is very sticky for finger licking fun! 

I was first hesitant when I did not see the peanut butter dissolving into the marinade but once I moved forward and added the chicken wings and covered them, in about 15 minutes, the sauce was fully blended and smelling great.

I have made this recipe several times...I LOVE IT! I didn't have any white vinegar, which for some might make the sauce too sweet, but I really enjoyed the stickiness, the taste, texture and tenderness of the chicken. It turns out well every time. I even used crunchy peanut butter since I ran out of creamy peanut butter. Suggestions: continue to turn chicken every 10-15 minutes, turn down heat if bottom of skillet is getting too gummy.

I tried this recipe for the first time and it came out delicious! The only thing I would change is to cut down on the sugar a bit. It is really sweet. I also simmered the chicken for 30 mins covered, 10 mins uncovered, then threw it into the oven for about 25 mins. Came out nice and gooey. Would definitely make again!

This was a very tasty sauce, the family enjoyed it.  My hubby thought it tasted like Pad Thai.  I did mine differently though as I had no desire to stand in front of the stove for an hour.  

First off, I used drumsticks rather than chicken wings. I doubled the sauce recipe (but reduced the sugar by 1/3).  This was a little too saucy, would do 1.5 of the recipe next time.  Mixed the sauce in a saucepan on the stove and heated it so the peanut butter would melt.  I also coated the chicken with flour, pan fried the drums in oil then baked them in a 9x13 pan with the sauce poured over top.  Baked them for about 55 mins.  To serve I poured the sauce in a pan and thickened with cornstarch.  Ate the sauce with the rice and a side of veggies.  It was really tasty and would make again.

My wings didn't "caramelize".  I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch which helped but I think we would have preferred the wings to be crispy on the outside......maybe grill or broil it after cooking.  Otherwise we liked it but didn't love it.

Delicious! Used turbinado sugar in place of white but didn't cut back amount. It has a sweet savory taste that is just unbelievable! Everyone loved them, even the kids. Made with frozen chicken wings-will definitely make again and soon!

HOLY COW this are awesome!! I of course changed things up a bit. And let me tell you I was winging it! hehe!
Made 26 fried chicken wings 
used 1/2 cup of water
4 tablesppons of PB
2 teaspoons of honey
3 Tbs of garlic

Boiled it down and added a pinch of corn starch to thicken it at the end. 

Mixed them all together and added the seeds last.

HUGE HIT with the family!

LOVE the "caramelizing" cooking method here.  The wings were so tender, and the stove top left a nice, crispiness in places.  Sesame seeds and peanut butter together?  Awesome.

I followed the directions exactly, and though the flavor of the sauce was good, it did not thicken. Also my chicken was on the tough side.

Used thighs instead, so cooked a little longer.  A few minutes under the broiler right before serving made for an even better presentation.  Delicious sauce.  I added grated ginger.

This is so delicious!! I make it a few times a month. The only change I would recommend to the recipe is to broil the chicken for about 4-5 minutes on each side after it is cooked and baste it with the sauce to add more flavor. After that top it with sesame seeds and green onions and serve it with rice. Best chicken ever!!

Absolutely delicious! I took the wings out at the end & continued cooking the sauce to thicken it more then returned the wings and the sauce coated them perfectly. I have also used this recipe with skinless boneless chicken thighs and that was fantastic, of course with the thighs I definitely had to remove and let the sauce thicken.

My husband loved this recipe better than his spicy one!  I added some crushed red pepper flakes (maybe 1/2 tsp?) for a bit of kick but left everything else the same.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have used it for chcken wings and turkey wings.  I like the sauce on the rice that I make with the dinner.  The only change I make is to use sugar substitute and only half of what is called for.

The flavor is wonderful- reminds me of Thai food. The only thing I would suggest is some heat- a little red pepper flakes or cayenne- just to compliment the peanut butter sweetness. I've already made this several times. Sometimes I just broil chicken breasts and do the sauce separately. I add a bit of cornstarch to the water and bring it to a boil, then pour it over my chicken breasts.

The flavor is good but these are SUPER SWEET! I am surprised that not many other reviewers mentioned that fact.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar and add crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper for some depth of flavor.

I was looking for a wing recipe different from Soy, teriyaki or hot.  I came across this and was unsure about the texture.  Then I read the reviews and wanted to make them.  So glad I did - they are simple, yummy and would definitely make them again.

The flavor is lovely and everyone in my family of 5 liked these. I will try them again with thighs and tenderloins. The sauce got kind of watery for awhile, but then it thickened up nicely at the end. (NOTE: I did cut the sugar to a couple of TBSP, used a bit of splenda, and cornstarch from the start per the other reviewers and the fact that I'm diabetic so too much sugar is not a good thing and it still turned out really wonderful. Also, I used a bit more vinegar because I only had rice wine vinegar which has a lower acidity than regular wine vinegar, and heaping tablespoons of peanut butter.)

This recipe is AMAZING! Per previous reviews, I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. Since we like things spicy, I also added some red pepper flakes and hot sauce to the recipe. The chicken literally fell off the bones into your mouth! It was absolutely delicious. I added some peanuts and water chestnuts to the sauce and served over noodles and broccoli. I will be making again and again!

Just finished serving these to my family for dinner.  Rave reviews from my husband and me.  The 3 1/2 year old, being her normal picky self, wasn't too sure.  The 15 month old prefered the French fries, but obligied me by eating a little of the chicken too.  I used homegrown chicken, of which I had frozen a pack of 10 large wings.  I followed the recipe exactly, except cutting back about 2 T of sugar.  They took a little longer than specified to carmelize.  Will definitely make these again next time I have a package of wings!

This recipe came up when I was searching for kid friendly chicken recipes.  I was skeptical at first but my toddler loved them.  I struggle like most parents through irrational eating patterns of toddlers.  She had not eaten chicken in months.  The smell is great and that enticed her to give it a try. - 

I did make two changes, but not intentionally.   I thought we had Soy Sauce in the house, and did not discover we did not until I was just about to make it.  I had a bottle of teriyaki sauce and used that instead.  I also only had red wind vinegar in the house.  We will definitely be making these again!

My husband and I liked it. We both love to eat and try new recipes. So this was the pick for tonight. I served it up with white rice, corn on the cob and a Cuban Salad (tomato, avacado and sweet onion).  I did cut back on the white sugar as I am diabetic and did not use the sesame seeds as I have IBS. I have been taught by different cooks over the years and have learned soy sauces taste different, I used Lee Kum Kee (Hong Kong) - I find it less salty and used Nakano Rice Vinegar which is natural and has a mild, smooth and unique taste for the wine vinegar. My husband's critique was to add more soy sauce and garlic and if there was any wings left to throw them under the broiler (which I did) for his lunch the next day. Thank you for the recipe(s). As I am unable to work right now, this is great!

I made this for my boyfriend-- it is his all-time favorite chicken dish.  This is a great dish, especially for men and kids.  The sauce is delicious, and surprisingly only slightly reminiscent of peanut butter.

The only reason I gave this four rather than three stars was because the sauce did not thicken as advertised.  We ended up taking out the wings and broiling them a little to get them crispy, while at the same time adding some flour (3 tablespoons max) to the sauce that was still on the stove to make a nice roux which thickened up and made this VERY tasty.  Great recipe!

Wow -this is delicious !!!!and so easy to make!
I will definitely make it again.
The small downside,which did not bother me because it was so yummy,was that the sauce did not thicken as promised. Maybe I didn't wait long enough.
Highly recommend it.

I made them for my kids and they absolutely LOVED them...The only thing I might change next time, is the amount of sugar I use. It was a lil bit on the sweet side...Perfect for me, but too sweet for my kids. Other than that this recipe is great...Loved it, loved it LOVED IT!!!

I loved this recipe . I am not a fan of Peanut butter so i left that and the wine vinegar out. I substituted the white sugar for brown, and only added a1/3 of a cup. My children loved it!!!

Amazing! Best chicken wings I've ever had. My husband and I are addicted. Just used 1/2 the amount of sugar listed in the original recipe.

Fantastic!!!  My wife and I, and our 3 year old, loved these!

Only issue I had was I cooked them in a large wok-style pan, and when it came time to thicken the sauce, it wasn't thickening until I transferred it into a standard frying skillet.  THen it all came together.

Served these with rice and veggies, and used some of the leftover sauce on the rice.  Delicious!

Only complaint was that I didn't make enough chicken, it was done too fast!!

these were really good after reading reviews I started them on the stove and then transferred them to a wire rake on a cookie sheet to get "cripsy" put the oven to 450 and continued to baste them while they cooked. I also added cornstarch to the sauce before hand to thicken it up a bit and I did not use all the sugar suggested. Seemed a bit much. Although the flavor was good I think it would be best on a meatier piece of chicken-thigh, breast, leg.

I am doing legs tonight and going to use this sauce my kids loved the wings so Im sure they will love the legs!

Used chicken breasts cut into strips. Fried strips in coconut oil. Made sauce in separate pan until chicken was almost done. Poured sauce over chicken and simmered it down. Used half the sugar. Served with brown rice.

My daughter has asked me to make this several times in the past two weeks, as it has been awhile.  In looking at my recipe box I cannot believe I never rated this dish, as I must have made it 20 times at least!  This is an awesome, flexible recipe that is great with steamed veggies and Jasmine rice.  We all like it and I make it with boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into cubes.  I sub Splenda for the sugar and honey...tossing all ingredients into the electric skillet and letting simmer down until it is nice and thick.  Really delicious, quick, easy & foolproof recipe...thx Shannon!

So I tried this recipe and after turning my nose up at the thought of peanut butter being added to the recipe and with one adjustment it turned out DEEELICIOUS!! Instead of white sugar I used Brown Sugar and then after the last leg of the 30 minutes cooked uncovered, I placed them on a pan, poured what was left of the caramelized over the chicken,sprinkled some more brown sugar on top of the wings to give it a more sweeter tangy taste in the oven @ 450 for about 10-15 mins and it turned out great!! I will be making this again tonight for dinner!!

it was easy to make but did not need the whole hour to cook. Next time I would make more sauce and try it in the oven instead of the electric pan.

I make this once every couple months. It's so easy - you mix ngredients, cover for 30 minutes, uncover 3o minutes and it cooks itself. I usually make a rice pilaf and salad or vegetable with it. Never any leftovers

Tried this recipe this evening, was very delicious, but I added 1/4 cup more of soya sauce and a t spoon of pepper flakes. Our guests loved it as we did also. Not spicy at all just a tingle.. Will make again soon

I loved this recipe; it was so flavorful and unique for my family.  I would definitely make this a staple in my household.  I used chunky peanut butter since that is the preference in my household and it definitely adds something special to the wings.

Really liked this. Cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes. Browned the wings a little first. Then baked in oven at 375 for 40 minuets covered--uncovered for 20. Had extra sauce for dipping.

I like this one, simply and people love it. I reduce the sugar a bit and have tried it with drumsticks but still prefer wings.  I also like to get this recipe started and then stick it in the crock pot. That makes it simple and easy for travel purposes like company picnics.

With such a high star rating and so many reviews I had high hopes for these. I should have heeded the reviews and adjusted accordingly. These were entirely too sweet, even the kids didn't enjoy them. Will decrease PB to 1Tbs, add some heat & see if they're better.

Holy smokes & hot !  This was good!  (Note - if you season your chicken, easy on the salt, the soy sauce adds just enough).  And yes, they do get sticky and sweet!

Just tried it. LOVED IT! Hubby loved it and the kids loved it as well. I'm thinking of trying this on different parts next time. By the way, I admit that I did fry the wings before mixing them in with the sauce. I only fried them to a very light golden brown.

Really Good, not too sweet, not too soy-saucy, glad it glazed well in the oven, I basted with boiled remaining marinade. I cook much but not wings recently. Keeper for sure.  Thank You!!

The sauce is fantastic!! I halved the recipe and used tenderloins instead of wings. If using tenderloins, no need to cook as long. My chicken was a bit dry and difficult for my 1 & 4 year old to chew, but that was my fault. Definitely a 5 star for taste!!

Delicious!  I substituted agave syrup for the sugar (less than 1/4 cup) and did these on the BBQ.  Turned out awesome!

This recipe was ok..just a little too sweet for my family. If I make them again I'll definitely cut down the sugar. They also didn't caramilize.

These are by far the best wings I have had.  It was a great hit for the family.  Not one wing leftover.

Super delish!  Easy too. I used half the soy sauce and added a little Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper. Next time I will use more of the wine vinegar too.  It is sweet but it is good. Wonder what I could use to cut the sugar content.

These were soooo yummy! You would never have guessed they were made in a skillet instead of baked! Even my niece who doesn't eat wings ate like six of these! Needless to say, there were no leftovers!

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious.  The sauce thickened and caramelized nicely. For those who cut the sugar in half, maybe that is why the sauce didn't thicken for you.  The sugar is what causes the caramelization.  
My husband immediately told me to copy this to my recipe file and to make it often.  It's a keeper.

This was EASY and Tasty! Kids loved =) I made it with chicken breasts (browned first with some adobo seasoning and minced garlic) Then cooked in pan for 30 min, took chicken out and wrapped in foil while I cooked the sauce down for another 30 min. Sauce thickened up on it's own (I doubled everything in the sauce BUT the water). Served sprinkled with green onions along with jasmine rice and sauteed spinach. Next time will add some minced ginger too. This would be good with any kind of chicken, but wings would probably be the tastiest :) Next time I will prob do the wings...DEF will be making this again! UPDATE: This was Awesome reheated on day 2or3!! I shredded the chicken in big chunks before putting it in fridge and it soaked up the flavor nicely =)

This was an excellent dish! I would have given it five stars, but it was a little too salty. Next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce instead. Also, I halved the sugar based on other reviews, and it worked great. Can't wait to make this again!

These were really yummy... I doubled the sauce because I made double the wings.... I followed the recipe and my sauce was pretty thick... after the 30 minutes uncovered.... I put my skillet under the broiler for 8-10 minutes checking on them every 2 minutes.... they were super sticky and delicious. Making again tonight the same way.

I made just a couple of easy substitutions. Instead of ½ cup white sugar I used ¼ cup brown sugar. Instead of 2 Tbs. of honey I used ¼ cup honey. Richer flavor. Otherwise it was terrific. I’ve made this several times for company and everyone wants the recipe. It’s excellent!

Really nice recipe. As others had said it was very sweet I cut the sugar to about 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white. I also left out the peanut butter. The sauce is like a honey sesame sauce. I used a pressure cooker to cook the wings for 30 minutes and then reduced the sauce in about 15 minutes. Tender and delicious. Will definitely be making it again.

I used 3/4C sugar based on other reviews about it being too sweet..it still was WAY too sweet, unless you like that! Also, the sauce never thickened.. the chicken was dry and bland, in my opinion of course! I had to add onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, a splash of chili garlic sauce, and green onions to bring it back to life;) Also, I took chicken out and blasted it at 400 in he oven to crisp it a bit, and added  corn starch to the sauce thicken it up while I waited, but I should've just stuck with my own recipe;) Thanks though!

I thought these wings were incredibly good. I did them for the super bowl and again tonight because we enjoyed them so much. I changed a few things out of necessity, I used balsamic vinegar and natural peanut butter as that is what I had on hand. I also found both times that I prepared them that the thirty minutes uncovered part of the recipe was inadequate to get the stickiness I wanted. The sauce was still a bit soupy at that point. I left them uncovered on medium heat for an extra twenty minutes and that did the trick. That being said the culprit could easily have been my aging electric range. Either way we love this recipe.

Turned out so tasty! Made without wine vinegar and instead of white sugar I used brown, gives it that sweet taste just in the same. Turned out deliciously, served with brown rice and broccoli.

This is a really great recipe. You won’t be able to tell there is peanut butter in the sauce but everyone will know there is something a little different that makes them great. I didn’t have very many wings on hand when I made this but I wish I had had more. Fantastic!!

Delicious wings but very sticky and gooey! Have some wet napkins ready! Ingredients combine well for great flavor. No taste of peanut butter, really.  I scaled this down to 6 servings, using 10 chicken wings. I used garlic powder in place of fresh garlic. The sauce starts off thin but transforms into a thick, carmelized glaze. On the second 30 min with the cover off,  I frequently turned the wings over and lowered the temp; let them go for only 25 min. Looks like they could have a tendency to stick so keep an eye on them. Thanks for the great recipe, Shannon!

Just made this for my husband and myself, it was fantastic! I did tweak it a little according to our taste by adding less sugar and throwing in some ground cayenne pepper for a little kick! My husband can be a picky eater but this recipe passed the test and I will definatly be making it again!

These are easy to make and very tasty.  They are sweet but my family loved them.  I'm going to use concentrate orange juice with the water and cut the sugar in half, maybe even less.  I also added fresh ginger and it was very good in this recipe.

These turned out terrific!  I made only 1 change to the recipe by adding only half the sugar - other reviewers had thought them too sweet with 1/2 cup, and so I decided to error on the cautious side (more can be added to taste, but that already added can't...right?).  They were really good, sticky delicious!

Made it with drumsticks. But used only 1/3 of the white sugar called for.
Loved the peanut taste!
I found the sauce too watery and thin.  Maybe some cornstarch? I don't think I would make it again.

If I could have given more than 5 starts I would have..This dish is outstanding and the sauce is to die for, seriously.. I followed all directions but I did add a couple of Tbs of brown Sugar along with the White....These Wings would be great for a party/event and I guarantee that they will be gone in minutes.. I used an Electric Skillet and I was concerned that the sauce wouldn't thicken but as soon as I uncovered them for the last 30 minutes the sauce started thickening and was perfect when finished...This recipe is now a very big fan favorite in our home..  Thank you All Recipes...

These wings were awesome! Nice and sticky and went well with rice. I halved the sugar for personal preference, and added some hot sauce for a little kick, but I'm sure they would have been just as awesome as written.

went the fair route and made it exactly as directed the first time, no changes (I made mine in a skillet on the stovetop). It gets 5 stars, no question! The flavor was amazing.
Advice to others: You must cook for two 30-minute intervals, that's what thickens the sauce.

Made it exactly as directed.I believe the skin needed to be crisped first as the skin was soft and flabby and unpleasant to chew.The sauce was goopy and way too much for the amt. of wings.

Looked good after I made it but the inside tastes a bit bland to me. The outside/skin, of course, tastes great. I'll try making it again though & maybe tweak it a bit here & there. My family likes it though so I guess that's all that matters.

I read the reviews and decided to use boneless chicken breasts sliced so I could use them in a salad as suggested. I had no problem with the sauce thickening up). I did not like the taste of these at all.

The first time I made this dish, the Hubby gave it a two thumbs up! I have made this many times since and normally use my slow cooker (Yes, the crock pot) for a super easy meal. At times, I have substituted ingredients for what I've had on hand such as garlic powder for fresh garlic, garlic rice vinegar for wine vinegar and chicken thighs for wings and the dish is consistently delicious! Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I made a few changes. I did a quick deep fry of the chicken as I was making the sauce (about 3-4 minutes).  I then put the chicken into skillet with sauce. I let the chicken soak in the sauce for a few minutes and then I transferred it all to an oven dish. I covered it up with foil and let it cook in there for about 25 minutes at 400°F.  I love sauce so I made another batch of the sauce downsized to pour on top halfway through. I ten cooked it for 10 more minutes uncovered. That sauce!! Just made it last night but I'm ready to do it again tonight!

I will make it again... I used boneless chicken thighs... Only 1/3 of the sugar but added 2 table spoons if brown sugar ... 

I kept "tasting" while cooking you know to make sure it was done ( wink wink) 
My sauce thickened in about an hour... Just amazing gooey and delicious... Side dish is roasted potatoes carrots and green beans... Yum!!!!

This was really yummy!  I was looking for a new chicken wing recipe and found this one.  The only modification I made was I used 1/3  cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup and felt like it was still slightly sweet after the addition of the honey.  Next time, I'll try 1/4 cup.  Otherwise, it was perfect.

I have made these over and over and over again. My family loves them and when I make them for groups I'm always asked for the recipe. We always have them over rice with broccoli. I've also made the sauce and added it to cut up chicken breast. Just have to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Amazing recipe Shannon.

This was not able to be prepared as written. Several reviewers (and I agree) said the sauce would not thicken even after doubling the cooking time. I finally drained the liquid and added a different sauce to salvage them. Unfortunately because they were in too much liquid for too long they were not tender. Changing the recipe to give it higher marks is not accurate to the recipe.

Both family and friends did love this. No sesame seeds allergy. I've already made it three time and this last was simply perfect. I used 2 lbs of chopped tigs (cut in half). Starting from the 6 servings I made few adjustments according to my taste and previous 'tests':
-  Used 1/3 packed dark brown sugar and 3 TBs of White sugar (to better thicken the sauce at the end of cooking but keeping acceptable the sweetness)
- 3 TBs of honey (not only 1)
- Added 3 TBs of ketchup
- Used cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar.
Smothed into the pot with a blender then cooked followings directions... no need to use cornstarch. 
The result was just perfect and 'mamma mia' ;) ... lucky i took the pic before placing it on the table!

Loved these! I finished off the wings under the broiler 2-3 minutes each side, and turned the heat to medium after removing wings to thicken up the sauce. I did add a little sea salt to the sauce at the end. I'll be making these again. Thank you Shannon Koller for posting this wonderful recipe.

Wow! So easy and flavorful. This is a keeper. For those of you having a tough time with sauce thickening, it's nothing more than reducing liquid. Be sure to take off the lid during the last half hour and turn up the heat from simmer to about medium. The goal is to evaporate the sauce to make it a glaze. Toss wings with a spatula from time to time to promote evaporation. Careful though, they're almost falling apart at this point. Turn the heat down at about 15 minutes remaining. Continue to reduce, toss and glaze. OMG, what a wonderful flavor. Yum! Enjoy!

I swapped white sugar for brown and used 1/2 of the prescribed amount. Rather used a little extra honey. I also added a teaspoon of ground ginger. It was delicious. Served with garlic and rosemary roasted potatoes and squash

Unbelievably delicious! Tried the recipe last night for the first time and it came out spot on. My hubby wanted to add that we should crisp it up first in the oven or frying first before following the instructions of putting it in the sauce to cook. I see others have suggested the same thing however I question if there would be too much liquid sauce if the chicken is already partially cooked. I think I'll stick with the tried and true method. It was perfectly cooked, fall off the bone ready, sticky, sweet and completely gone before I even realized. Will definitely be making this for my sons birthday party!

I made this dish for my mom, and let me say it is absolutely fabulous. When I prepared this dish I followed the instructions exactly. The only struggle I had was seperating the wing from the tips from the drums as this was my first time. I used black sesame seeds because I have to stand out and my mother loved it. thanks Shannon girl....

I wasn't too thrilled about the final outcome.  I DID cut the sugar to about 1/3 cup as others did and the sweetness was fine.  I think I would have liked a bit more peanut butter though because I couldn't tell it was there in the final product.  The sauce did thicken up very nicely but the overall taste was just okay.  I also added some red pepper flakes to add a little bit of heat.  I made two different kinds of wings last night and we agreed we liked the other kind better.

This was just too much work for too little payoff. When I took the aluminum foil off after 30 minutes, I had chicken wing soup. I poured off about half the liquid and turned on the convection fan. I ended up pouring off the liquid 2 more times in order to get the wings to brown and get rid of the sogginess. They tasted okay, but no wow factor worthy of wasting all those ingredients.

Fab-u-lous! Great recipe. Only changes I made were broiling the wings for 10 minutes on each side (or until browned), and adding a bit of hot sauce and cajun spice for some kick. Sauce thickened beautifully and flavour was delicious. I was curious as to why this recipe was lacking negative reviews, and now I know why. Thanks for sharing.

I've made these twice.  My 11yr old and 3yr old loved them. My 11yr says these are his favorite!  They were a tasty change from the usual buffalo wing. Will definitely make again.

My son made these using smaller wings that are usually used for hot wings. Came out excellente. He loves using this recipe. He loves showing off his skills. We adjusted the recipe to make 24 wings not realizing the recipe called for 24 whole wings which would have made 48 sections. the sauce didn't thicken so we added about 2 tbsp of corn starch. thickened right up!!

Yum! My hubby wasn't sure about the recipe at first, but when I gave him the chicken (served with white rice), he said it wasn't that bad. It was good! Next time, I'll make more so there's leftovers! XD
