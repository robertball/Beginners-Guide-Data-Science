Oh, what a wonderful dinner we had tonight, this chicken being the star of the show.  I'm sure it would probably be even better with the bone-in chicken breasts called for but I used the boneless chicken breasts I had on hand, altering the roasting time to 400 degrees, 20-25 minutes.  I added minced garlic to the mix and drizzled the leftover butter over the chicken but made no other changes. The aroma as this was baking was so wonderful and just a forecast of what was to come.  This was just delicious - I thought the amount of oregano would be overkill, but it wasn't, and the paprika contributed the beautiful, rich color I knew it would. If you do substitute boneless chicken breasts, 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees is perfect - the chicken was very moist and tender. This couldn't be easier, quicker or more delicious.  I served this with pasta with garlic and olive oil and  "Sauteed Swiss Chard with Parmesan Cheese," also from this site.  Mmmmm, I wish you could smell my kitchen!

This is a keeper. My husband and I are trying to watch our weight so I substituted the butter for egg whites and it turned out great. My kids, husband, father and I all loved it. I will be making this one often. I may try the boneless breasts next time.

Very good!  I used 2 egg whites instead of butter and scaled the recipe for 4 servings.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  The coating crisped up nicely and the flavor was delicious.

Yum! Great recipe - I substituted 1/2 the butter with olive oil and added a little bit of Italian bread crumbs with the Parmesan cheese. I didn't have whole chicken breasts on hand, so I used chicken tenders which taste the same! This recipe was easy and fast and I will use again. Thanks!

I cater parties and was looking for something different for chicken.  After several failed attempts, I found this recipe.  I tried it out on the family first, and they loved it and wanted me to make it again the very next day.  For the party, I used boneless chicken,  I had so many compliments I couldn't count them.  EVERYONE asked for the recipe.

This was a hit.  I used boneless chicken breasts and just adjusted the cooking time down, checking doneness as I went.  Delicious!

I used five boneless skinless chicken breasts that I pounded pretty thin and a mixture of half butter/half EVOO. Great paired with a simple salad or served in a wrap with avocado! In the wrap I used Paul Newman's Parmesan & Roasted Garlic dressing - delish! The second time I made this recipe I added rep pepper for a little kick, too. Baked @ 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

Awesome chicken!  I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and reduced the rest of the ingredients to 1/3.  I only used 4 Tbsp. butter (Smart Balance Butter Blend), but I bet I could have gotten away with 3 Tbsp.  I cooked it at 350 for about 45 minutes, but I think it would have browned better at a higher temp and shorter time.  It smelled and tasted delicious!

Was an easy, okay take on regular baked chicken.  Very easy prep and my husband seemed to like it okay.  It was a little strong on the herbs to be one of my favorites but I am not a fan of tons of herbs.  I would probably make it again.

This was a very good chicken recipe.  The use of fresh parsley definitely made this recipe stellar, as well as using freshly grated parmesean cheese (instead of the pre-grated Kraft stuff).  My only complaint was that the Parmesean mixture made WAY too much, so it felt like such a waste of ingredients that I no longer had any use for (and they couldn't be saved, since they had raw chicken dipped in them).  Like other readers, I used an egg white instead of the butter/margarine to coat the chicken.

This was so easy and so delicious!!! I'm just starting to learn how to cook and even I didn't mess this one up! I found it to be a little salty though because Parmesan cheese is salty all on its own so I think next time I won't add any salt to it. Other than that it was absolutely delicious!!!! Definitely keeping this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added about 1/3 cup bread crumbs to the mixture.  The smell of this cooking was wonderful! I had planned on using boneless chicken breasts but ended up using the bone in ones, which was great.  I love a strong herb flavor, however my always picky 6 yr old didnt care for it.  The only complaint my fiance had was the taste of the oregeno.  He felt it was too strong and as he put it, "oregeno belongs only in spaghetti sauce".  So I will definitely be making this again, but will cut the oregeno in half, or substitute something else in its place.

This chicken was excellent!  I used boneless chicken breasts, and cooked at 350 until they reached an internal temperature of 165.  They were moist and delicious.  The seasonings were perfect.  I will definately be making this one again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was quite good, and my husband absolutely loved it. Stuck to the recipe pretty much, but added some bread crumbs to the parm mixture, as well as cayenne and garlic powder. I used just 3 breasts, but made double the coating mixture. Cooked for about 45-50 minutes! Delicious!

I made this tonight, using bone-in skin-on chicken breasts.  Since the meat still had the fat from the skin and bone, I omitted the butter and just smushed the chicken into the cheese mixture.  I had a wedge of Romano - no Parmesan - so I used that instead. Actually, I used half Romano and half Panko breadcrumbs.  Also used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I baked mine at 375' for 40 minutes, which was perfect.  Despite all of my substitutions, it was still delicious, and the coating was nice and crispy!

Yum!  I didn't have oregano (I have NO idea how that happened) so I used a pre-mixed shaker of Italian seasoning instead and left out the additional salt.  I also used the egg white idea to save on calories.  It was delish!  Thank you for sharing :)

one of my husband's faves. He absolutely loves the parmesan crust it makes. No problem reducing the recipe for 2 or up to 4, 6 etc. I don't use quite as much butter, if you can't get it everywhere use a basting brush. Fantastic recipe for guests. Just make sure you get smaller sized chicken breasts if you can find them, otherwise it can take more than an hour to cook to the correct temperature inside. And the parsely works fine if it's dried.

very Yummy! If your not a oregano lover you may want to cut it down some. The only thing I did different was dip the chicken in milk as I was out of eggs and did not see any reason to use 1 cup of butter. I did put a pat of butter on each chicken.

Excellent Flavor!!  Hubby wanted to "bake" this chicken on his grill using indirect heat, so I agreed.  We used a remote thermometer which we love and use a lot, but maybe it's intended for larger cuts of meat, not smallish chicken breasts.    We have a pretty nice grill so we can maintain a 350 degree temperature without a problem, but after only 17-19 minutes the thermometer was registering "done."  Well, no way was it done, so I put it in an oven to continue baking for another 10 minutes, then broiled to crisp it up.  Well it was very good chicken and it looked beautiful, but it didn't crisp up like I thought it would.  I'm sure our problems were directly related to the thermometer, not the fault of the recipe.  I'm definitely going to make this again, but in the oven and without the remote thermometer!

Very good. Quick and easy supper with pasta on side. Decreased servings to 2, dipped in EVOO instead of butter and added plain dry bread crumbs to Parmesan--only had a small piece left to grate.  Chicken very tender, nice flavor but next time make bake on rack since bottom was a little wet.

My husband, who is not a fan of baked chicken, loved this recipe. I used chicken tenders instead, and found that the flavor was much better when using smaller pieces of chicken, and not too strong. A definite keeper.

This chicken was wonderful!  The flavor is great.  We are monitoring carbs, so the parmesean is a great alternative to using bread crumbs to coat the chicken.

I made this chicken tonight and it is DIVINE. I used boneless chicken breasts, though. I also added fresh rosemary, and fresh dill (since I had it laying around. SO savory, even my picky-as-hell 7 yr old ate it all!!!

Absolutely fantastic! I substituted the butter with extra-virgin olive oil and added mozzerella cheese to the parmesan to give it an extra kick. This will be going in my recipe book for sure!

Nice easy chicken recipe if you're looking for something different.  I used boneless chicken breasts, but other than that, followed the recipe.  The chicken had nice flavor, and it stayed moist (I always use an internal thermometer to make sure I don't over-cook it).  It received great reviews.

Really good! The ony problem I had with it though is the cheese mixture got to be pasty after all of the dipping. Next time I make this I'll place the chicken in the pan, sprinkle the cheese mix on top, and then flip and do the same thing.

This was just ok for our tastes with little too much parm flavor.  I may modify for next time.

This was good and I'll probably make it again, next time reducing the amount of herbs.  It tasted to "herby" for my likes.  Family enjoyed it.

I use a gas oven and was a bit worried that the timing would be off.  So I set it at 400 and cooked it for 45 min.  The chicken was absolutely juicy and super-tasty!  
This recipe was a complete hit!!!!  

Keep em' coming, Lady!
