Delicious! It is thick enough that in stretching it (by adding more pasta and chicken broth to make it more soup-y) for our large family of 8, it still maintained its rich, tomato taste.  I love the fact that I can use whatever veggies I have on hand and it works well.  I have had my share of bland minestrones before, so glad to find one so easy and full of flavor.

It was fantastic, only thing we changed was omitting the green pepper.

I made it vegetarian.  Left out the meat and added a can of white kidney beans.  I also used veg broth to replace the chicken broth.  And it was still very flavorful!

Yum! Easy, quick soup with great flavor. Tastes just as good the second day. Even my husband who is picky about most veggies liked it.

It’s pretty good, but kinda bland. Had to add a tad more herbs, salt and pepper at the end. Think I’ll add Italian sausage and one more can of broth next time. I like hearty soups, but this is more akin to a stew.

The seasonings were right on!  This is a great base for a minestrone soup. It’s easy to make changes and have it still taste good. I made two versions. One with shredded beef and another vegan. The vegan batch had vegetable broth and garbanzo beans.  I didn’t have broccoli so I added chopped celery and green beans. You can’t go wrong with this recipe!

I do admit I made some small adjustments. I used hot sausage instead of hamburger and feel this gives it more flavor.  I did not add broccoli or green peppers but added orange/yellow pepper, fresh green beens and yellow squash.  
I make this recipe regularly.

Omg! I have never bothered to rate a recipe before now even though I get all my recipes from this site and the majority of them are fabulous however I felt compelled to immediately rate this one. I have never made minestrone soup and I see a lot of highly rated recipes on this site for the same but this one will be the only one I'll ever use because it is perfection. I followed the recipe exactly but used ground turkey so I could be more heart healthy and it turned out to be my favorite soup recipe. The whole family loved it as much as I did. I want to make this weekly because it tastes so good and is a great way to get your fill of veggies. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was the bomb!

Our family loves this recipe and I often make it when taking a meal to a friend.  It always gets rave reviews!  I omit the broccoli and green beans and have used other veggies I have on hand.

Excellent recipe.  The soup was thick enough to be considered a stew.  I replaced the pasta with kidney beans to add fiber and protein without the pasta carbs.  I also used whole stewed tomatoes and ran them through the vitamix to make them a tad smoother.  I'm the only one who likes chunky tomato texture.   I used organic, grass-fed beef, and it was still an awesome deal to feed four people.  We had some left over for lunch the next day.

It was really, really great.   I plan on using the base as a stew for whatever I've got in the fridge.  It would be great as a chicken vegetable or vegetarian stew.

I really love that it's so easy to make.  Thanks so much, Jessipeer!

Very Good.  I used Louisiana hot links , not ground beef, this made it even easier, no draining the beef.  Zucchini and carrots, one can of baby white beans, out of basil, so I added about 1/4 tsp. of ground cumin and lots of oregano.  Great go to soup.
Thanks for the recipe

Wow...this was great! Only change was chicken Parmesan sausage because we're cutting back on beef. Also added.kidney beans. Oh...I also added some back olives because I put them in almost everything.

Excelent. I added corn and green beans, left out the broccoli. I doubled the pasta also. As the cook said, options.
