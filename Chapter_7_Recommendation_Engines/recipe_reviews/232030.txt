I received this recipe years ago from a Weight Watchers leader. It's fantastic!  You can adjust and play around with the ingredients as you like (I'm not a fan of spinach) You can also make them not-diet-friendly by adding sausage, bacon, ham, other cheeses - I like jalepeno in mine with onion and mexican blend shredded cheese. Plain old pepper and egg are good too.  AND they can be frozen - so I grab a couple and head out the door to work, by the time I'm there a min or less in the microwave warms them up and I'm ready to have a healthy breakfast.  LOVE this recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

This makes a great low-carb breakfast. I have made these many times in the past. You can make up a batch and store in the fridge for several days..just warm them up in the microwave for a few seconds and you have a quick breakfast. Sometimes I will add some diced ham to them and they can also be made with 3 large eggs instead of eggbeaters.

I did not have egg substitute on hand, I used three extra large eggs instead. I also used regular sharp cheddar. This was okay--edible but bland. If I were to make it again, I would play around with the recipe a bit to make it more flavorful.

I love this recipe - easy, healthy and tasty. I make mine "greek salad style" - Along with the base of eggs and spinach, I use low fat feta cheese, add a tsp of dried oregano, red and green bell pepper and onion. They are tasty and easy - freeze well, and are great heated in the microwave on a slice of whole grain toast. One note: make sure you spray your cupcake pan well, or use foil muffin liners:)

This is an old S Beach diet recipe.  It was bland back then so I made it with some extras such as adding salt/pepper, garlic and onion powder, and because I wanted a little more protien, I added 3 diced slices of Canadian Bacon.  Definitely use the tin foil baking cups and cooking spray or they'll be very sticky with paper!

Vegetable Quiche Cups To-Go Haiku: "Fun and convenient. Just didn't taste like that much. Needed seasoning." Other than swapping egg substitute for 3 larger eggs, I followed the recipe as directed, and found myself adding considerable amounts of salt, pepper and hot sauce when it came time to eat one. I do love having frozen mini crustless quiche bites for a quick breakfast, but I also want them to be tasty, so if I made this recipe again, I'd tweak around w/ more spices, as well as maybe sauteeing the onion and bell pepper 1st rather than mixing them raw and crunchy into the eggs.

I made these in mini muffin pans for a relative to freeze for easy, healthy breakfast after having her first child. I used red peppers, spinach, and carrots (shredded in food processor) and no liners. She loved them and requested again next time we visited.

This recipe is from the South Beach cookbook from many years ago. It's a great go-to breakfast. It's easy to make, freezes well, and is very satisfying.

Very good! I used fresh spinach (blanched) and a red bell pepper, otherwise stuck to the recipe. These are perfect to make ahead, cool and store in the frig for a quick on-the-run breakfast during the work week. Thanks!

It's not bad, but you need to add salt if you don't use hot sauce. I can see why people said it's bland. Will be playing around to see what other variations would be good.

Used fresh spinach and 6 whole eggs. It made 9 muffin cups, so next time I'll use 8 eggs.

I made these and added 1/3 cup of pork sausage crumbles, used roasted red pepper (diced) and sauted my onion.  I didn't have any muffin cup liners so I used a sprayed 1-1/2 quart casserole and baked it for 30-35 minutes then cut it into 12 small squares.  Pretty good for diet food.  I calculate 91 calories for 2 small squares by using MyFitnessPal.com.

I used about 8 ounces of spinach instead of 10. This made a nice quick bite to eat before my morning workout. I like them cold or popped in the microwave about 15 seconds.

Loved it. Just added a little bit of salt to it! My 2 year old girl called it "green thing" and she loves it too.
