ADD SUGARFREE VANILLA PUDDING (100 calories) & these low calorie treats are delish!! Mine weren't pancakey at all. They actually were like little mountains that didn't spread. 
I made some tweaks:
>> Sm. pack Sugarfree Vanilla Pudding (1 oz)
>> 3/4 C whole wheat flour
>>1/2 C choc chips (more than enough)
>> 1 whole egg
10 min bake time

Enjoy!

this recipe is amazing for someone who is looking for low calorie sweet snacks! Yes, they have a soft fluffy consistancy.......but they taste great and wow........I added 1/3 cup of oats... 68 calories in 1 cookie, you cant get any better than that! And hey look like real cookies. I also made my own apple sauce using 2 apples, which cooked while I was putting the rest of the ingredients togther. Thanks for this recipe.

Okay, so yes they taste a little pancake-y. But come on they are 63 calories! And who doesn't love pancakes? If someone told me they were only that many calories I wouldn't believe them! I added more chocolate chips, about a 1/4 cup more flour, and a tablespoon of butter the batter seemed like it was missing something, they may have gone over 63 calories but they are still a lot lighter than the 500 calorie ones on this site and taste origional and amazing! Make this recipe with these alterations and you won't be dissappointed!

I really enjoyed these cookies! They were very good considering how healthy they are. I usually add a little cinnamon, and substitute whole wheat flour. You can also add 1 cup of dry oatmeal for a hearty chewy cookie. Just eyeball the dough as you add the oats so it doesn't get too dry, but if it does, just add a little more applesauce.

Interesting cookie...the texture is kind of like a pancake, but the flavor is good. It did satisy my chocolate craving (I doubled the chocolate chips so that probably helped!). I would make these again, but nothing like the real thing.

Maybe these cookies have a different texture but they are still very good. I'm not a big fan of chocolate so I didn't put any in the cookies but I did add cinnamon which made them even better. I also used splenda instead of real sugar.

Very easy to make. This has become favorite for my family. I do tend to add items like oatmeal,honey nut cerel, slivered almonds. makes batter thicker and does increase baking time but well worth the time.

First off, don't compare these cookies to a regular cookie when you make and rate them. Of course they aren't going to taste as good as the fattening ones, duh! So with that in mind, make them and you will see that they do indeed satisfy your craving for a cookie without any of the guilt. They do have a pancake texture and they do stick to the pan, so be forewarned and definitely use Pam. I make these together with my toddler and I feel good about giving them to her and she loves helping me make them. So even if you're not watching your weight, these are a great healthy alternative to give to your kids.

I am not sure with this one. They taste ok but not as well as others have stated. I guess they are good for a lite cookie but are sort of cake/pancake like. I do not think I will make again. I will wait to see what the hubby & grandkids say. I did post a photo of my cookies they looked great…

I followed the recepie exactly. I was debating on keeping the egg yolk in there, but I did exclude it. With that said, these cookies came out looking great. The taste wasn't so bad either. However, it's the texture that gets me. They're are rubber like. Not very good. Like, I said, the taste and presentation was nice. Due to the rubber consistancy, I don't think I will be making these again.

Instead of chocolate chips, I used M&Ms(candy coated chocolate). Delicious for a low-fat/lower cal cookie.

These cookies are delicious...for being low fat. If you hadn't told me they were low fat and I popped one in my mouth, I would have thought them so - so. I substituted splenda for sugar (use half since splenda is 2x as sweet) and cut down the calories even further. A note here: the recipe says to use an ungreased cookie sheet, but these cookies WILL stick! I recommend doing a quick spray of non stick just to be safe. Also, these make 12 very small bite size cookies. It was hard for me to stop at two! What I love is that these cookies fit perfectly into my diet. But I kinda stick by the old adage..."If you're gonna have a cookie HAVE A COOKIE!" In other words, to really satisfy my sweet tooth I'll reach for Mrs. Fields. :)

Given what this cookie is I must say that it is excellent. Like other reviewers I agree that it has a pancake like texture. I can live that. I do wish the batter wasn't as wet as it is. It makes spacing the cookies for baking difficult. also this recipe doesn't make 1 dozen cookies if you are using a standard size cookie scoop like I do. I got about 8 this way. Nevertheless everything came to gether very fast and the bake time is right on. I baked for 8 minutes then turned the oven off for the last minute. Make sure to spray your cookie sheet or your parchment paper as the cookies will stick badly if you don't.

Was looking for a light cookie and these are not bad with only 2 pro-points on Weight Watchers. As other people have reviewed they are quite pancakey but I did not mind this texture. That being said I wouldn't really consider this a "cookie" but a low fat chocolatey/cakey treat or something. I am only giving 3 stars because they do not last and I had some problems baking them. I made them yesterday afternoon and then wrapped the plate in saran and this morning they are not hard but very very tough and super chewy and cannot eat them. Better to make them with more people around and eat them quickly after they come out of the oven. Also make sure to USE WAX PAPER!!! The first 6 cookies I just put on the cookie sheet as directed and they did not want to come off. I had to force them off and the cookies even took some of the metal off my pan onto the bottom of the cookie. I didn't actually have wax paper so used foil for the next 6 and they stuck as well but after about 2 minutes when the foil was cooled it was easy to peel the cookies off much like peeling a sticker. Interesting to try but probably won't make again and can find other low fat treats.

Delicious. I followed the reviewer's suggestion and tried them once with a serving of sugar-free Vanilla pudding (awesome!) and once with a serving of Double Chocolate sugar-free pudding mixed in. Both were delicious, but I think I preferred them with the vanilla. My batter made so many cookies though (was shooting for 24 and I think I ended up with 36 or so- and some were huge!)

I was looking for something semi healthy to take to a party and they were a hit. They didn't harden when they cooled which caused them to be more pancake like rather then cookie like, but, a good low fat and sugar recipe.

first go wasn't the greatest with these... the texture was really chewy... that could be because I over mixed my dough... it seemed really runny so I decided to add some more flour... the flour was needed but led to over mixing... 1/4 of flour is a definate must or add some oats to help out the texture... not bad flavor for being a healthy alternative though... will try again

Very chewy, but good flavor. Cooked in confection oven and this helps to get it a bit crispy on edges.
Something is missing, can't figure out.

I used Splenda instead of the sugar. Mine were not as flat as the ones in the picture, but they tasted great! My fiance even liked him. I didn't tell him they were low fat.

I made these cookies exactly to the recipe. They're not that great but expected for a "lite" cookie. I think if you follow the other reviewers suggestions such as light instant vanilla pudding and decrease the chocolate chips by 1/2 that the recipe will be much better and not that much more calories then before.

I LOVED this recipe! I used white whole wheat flour and instant oats to help the cookies stick together a little better. This took care of the "pancake" appearance and a few extra choc. chips took care of the pancake taste!

Fantastic!!! I used Splenda in place of the sugar. Also for health reasons I used carob chips and wow, made it several times now. Can't have caffine and am on a diet. One time all I had was a cup of peach flavored applesauce and that was good also.

These cookies are pretty good for the calorie content, but I have to agree with many of the reviewers -- they're more like a cross between a cake and a pancake with chocolate chips thrown in.   I didn't make any modifications and made the recipe as written until the very end, when the batter was way too soupy.  I ended up adding about a cup of old fashioned oats, and the cookies came out looking like the picture provided with this recipe.   They taste pretty good and not at all 'lite' but for those who're expecting a crunchy or chewy cookie, these might not work (I even tried baking one batch a bit longer, but they only ended up becoming more brown)

A little thin and pancake-like, but otherwise good.  They are low-calorie, so I didn't expect them to be ooey-gooey.  I tried this recipe with raisins instead of chocolate chips as well and they didn't taste good at all.  I had to throw those ones away.  Next time I think I will try adding oats to the recipe.

For "diet cookies" these were very good.  I did alter ther ecipe slightly.  I used splenda in place of the white sugar, whole wheat flour rather than white and added a small package of SF/FF vanilla pudding.  I scooped them onto the tray with a tablespoon and they came out in perfect little balls, just like they went in.  10 minutes was perfect in my oven. Very yummy.   Oh yes and I doubled it to get 17 cookies.

Delicious! A few changes: 1/4 applesauce, a packet of instant oatmeal, and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Soft and chewy!

they tasted really apple-y (but that might have just been the apple sauce i used, i used Tree Top) and i didn't like the texture, it was too pancake-y. they also didnt have a great flavor, but if your watching what your eating, these healthy cookies are better than no cookies!

I'm giving this 5 stars because for being a "lite" treat it is excellent.  My husband didn't even know it was healthy!  And it's something I plan on making often for the kids as a snack I can feel good about giving them.  Also, it's so easy my 3 1/2 year old boy can help with it.

These weren't bad, but still have that certain texture you get when you use applesauce.
Next time I'm craving choc chip cookies, I'll just make the regular recipe (with the butter, and all the calories!) and try to limit my portion.

This recipie suffers from the use of fat free and sugar free sugars. The texture is that of a rubbery pancake. Was disapointed, but as it serves so few, not much was lost except time.

I promised my daughter that I would make cookies with her.  My husband and I need to eat healthier so I looked for lite cookies.  I found these and was so excited until I looked in the fridge and realized we didn't have any applesauce.  Then I remembered that I had babyfood applesauce in the freezer (I make my own babyfood and freeze it in ice cube trays).  One "cube" of babyfood applesauce worked perfectly.  Yeah!  We love these cookies.

These were pretty darn good for low-fat cookies!  They do come out a little more like a muffin or a pancake than a cookie, but I like muffins so it works.  I also used splenda instead of the sugar, and that worked out very well.  I recommend the use of some kind of cooking spray or parchment paper, though.  I needed a jackhammer to get those cookies off the sheet!

Having read the reviews first, I was prepared for pancake-y texture, but was still surprised at how thin the batter was. I used Gluten Free flour, so that may have been the problem. I increased the flour 1/4 c. and added butter flavoring.
They are definitely more bread-like than cookie-like, less so if slightly overbaked. But not bad for an emergency craving. And even if I eat all 12, I won't feel guilty!

I thought this recipe was O.K., but it tasted more like pancakes than cookies.  They also turned out looking very strange.  But, aside from the pancake taste, I thought they tasted alright.

The best, healthy chocolate chip cookie recipe out there! I added a 1/4 cup oatmeal and increased the applesauce to 1/4 cup as well. I replaced the white sugar with Truvia (Stevia) and used whole wheat flour. These were great!

I doubled this recipe to make 24 cookies, and OMG am I ever glad I did! These are fantastic! I baked the first 12 cookies for 10 mins and they turned out nice and soft. I baked the second half for 13 mins and they were a bit crispy on the outside and still very soft and chewy on the inside! (I liked them best this way!) I used gluten-free flour instead of regular flour and it created a very sweet, soft cookies, with a taste similar to merengue. I've been looking for a low fat, healthy cookies without butter and this is defintely a keeper! I try to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free diet so this recipe with my alterations was perfect! The only thing I will change is to experiment with less sugar because it was almost too sweet. It would be very tasty even without the chocolate chips as well!

This should be named mini lowfat chocolate chip pancakes and maybe then, the product wouldn't be so disappointing. As cookies, these are not good... You would have to be on a very long term diet to think that these are good in the least. Won't make these again... I got a good laugh out of the whole thing though!

Though I followed all that the recipe said; my cookies came out rubbery & cake like. I do not like that in a cookie.... BUT the taste is just fine & they smell very good. Saddley, for a cookie to be prefect; it needs butter.

yummy! I changed the white sugar for splenda; now it's officially a diet cookie :) I also used baking powder in place of half the baking soda. It's definitely a light "fluffy" cookie now, but I like it! (oh and I added a few hemp seeds for some healthy essential omega fats) ...the baking powder was prob a silly move cause of the fluffy factor.

I can't believe I hadn't seen this recipe before tonight on the review tab.  I doubled the recipe and used a little over 1/4 cup of Egg Beaters and I also used butter flavoring instead of the vanilla.  It turned out more of a batter than a dough so I put into a 9" pie plate and baked for about 18 minutes.  It does have a cakey texture but it tastes soooo good without the guilt.  Thank you so much for posting this great little recipe!

i love these! i've made them too many times to count... they're fantastic (for a lite cookie) as is, but even better when you add 1tsp of butter flavoring. it gives it a buttery flavor without the butter! i dont think its neccessary to add extra flour, which i've tried doing because others suggested doing so... the cookies come out tasting more like a bread or a muffin. i like adding dried fruit to these (cherry-flavored cranberries,chopped apricots, ect) and white chocolate for a change every now and then. thanks for the recipe!

They taste like stale pancakes.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they are spongy (but not in a good way) and flavorless.  I'm all about trying to make desserts healthier, but this left me thinking: better to just eat the full-fat chocolate chip cookie and then hit the gym.  I threw the batch I made out.  If you do make them, be sure to grease the cookie sheet because they stick to it and are very hard to get off (prob. because they have no butter in them).

For light cookies they were yummy.  I only had cinnamon applesauce and it worked great!  The pancake-y texture was different, and the batter very liquid-y, maybe more flour?  The only real problem I had was that they were very hard to get off the ungreased pan.  Grease next time?

Yes, very pancake-y.  Just make the regular chocolate chip recipe(more satisfying) and ony eat 1 or 2 a day, not a half dozen, it pays to change my eating habits, not the food. I find that works for me.

For taste, I would give this recipe five stars. However, it says to place cookies on an ungreased baking sheet.   I unfortunately just learned the hard way that low fat cookies must always come off of a well-greased pan.  I wish this had been stated before, as I now have two dozen moist and delicious but paper coated chocolate chip cookies.

This deserves 5 stars for being a low fat cookie (you can't expect it to taste like the real thing).  I read the other reviews and people seem to think these cookies are a little "pancake like" so I used the whole egg (still low fat) to make it a little fluffier and more "cake like".  I also added a handful of chopped walnuts.  The batter is runny so instead of shaping the into cookies I just baked them in a small round cake pan. Before serving it my family I warmed it up just enough to make the chips nice and gooey and we all loved them.

This recipe didn't really produce cookies, it was more or less a bread. It taste fine but the texture was not at all that of cookies.

These cookies were not good at all. They had a very weird consistency and were even worse the next day. I will definitely go for the higher calorie version next time!

Would have been great except that they stuck to the pan way too bad I only managed to salvage half of the cookies. The taste was excellent but its too much of a hassle scraping the cookies off the pan and the cleanup really sucks

These cookies are great for those more health conscious, but still have a sweet tooth! I used brown sugar Splenda instead of the white/brown sugar combo and it tastes great. I used whole wheat flour and I also added oats, and since I didn't have any chocolate chips I cut up four squares of an 85% cocoa bar I had on hand-so good! I'll make these again.

I really enjoyed these cookies, and since the lite cookies are for ME, I didn't much care what my husband or kids thought about them. Like Vanessa, I used tin foil but the cookies stuck miserably to them. Luckily after they sat overnight, I was able to peel the tinfoil off the bottoms, sort of like you would peel a cupcaake out of its paper... the cookie was more stuck than a cupcake would be but less of the cookie was left behind than what typically happens in a paper cupcake liner. I will tryt parchment paper next time.  Main point? I love this cookie. I doubled the recipe and still sent some with the kids' lunches. My daughter really liked them, my son - didn't like them at school, but liked them at home. Go figure?

very easy to make and pretty good for such a low-calorie cookie.  almost a cake-like texture, and didn't spread much at all on the pan.  i did a "reverse" chocolate chip cookies that's a variation on a variation (from the 4/11/08 review by ALR) - great if you like white chocolate. here are the changes i made:  3/4 c all-purpose flour 1 whole egg 1/2 c white chocolate chips  and added a small (1 oz.) packet of sugar free instant chocolate pudding mix this made a baker's dozen and they were done in 8 minutes.

I decided to double the recipe and made 12 regular sized cookies. I did use 1 whole egg and subbed 1/4 cup of oatmeal and used all whole wheat flour for the remainder. I only used 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips and small handful of chopped pecans. They are very good and satifying. I have been looking for a chocolate chip recipe that didn't have butter, shortening or oil--this will certainly be my go to recipe when I want something lowfat/lowcal and dessert-like.

Yes - lite cookies is always good, but these definitely were not cookies.  They are definitely more like mini pancakes.  They do not have any cookie crunch or texture like a soft cookie.  I like them, but not what I was thinking of when I wanted a cookie.  My husband was not excited about these and told me to not be so healthy at the expense of taste.

SO GOOD! I have been on a diet since the new year. I have tried to eat one regular cookie but it was too sweet and thick...These are smooth, sweet, light, and tasty! When placing on cookie sheet use pampered chef stoneware (since they dont need oil and are non-stick) or use aluminum foil like i did and you wont have to add oil to your sheet!

I left mine in the oven for 11 minutes and they came out nice and chewy, just the way I like them. The apple sauce gives this recipe something you just cant find in your normal store brought ones. BUT i did find they didnt keep for very long so next time I will make a smaller batch so none go to waste, they are too good for that.

Very good cookie but, a big mistake was that it was very unaccurate. When all done mixing the batter fold in 1 cup of All Purpose Flour because the batter was very watery before I added the flour. :)

Yummy & guilt free! I made this recipe yesterday for a get together, except I used Splenda brown sugar & whole wheat flour.  The cookies looked strange, but they were delicious and my guests loved them!  I will try them with the Vanilla pudding next time.

Very Good! I ended up doubling the batch, so added the entire egg, 3 tbls Smart Balance butter, pinch of nutmeg, & sifted in whole wheat flour when I thought the dough looked gloppy. I also used 1/2 bag mini chips (all I had!). So good-not pancake-y but soft & tasty!

I added some coconut, raisins, oats, cinnamon and extra vanilla.  I also traded quantities of white and brown sugar. This yielded some awesome cookies!  All the extra stuff made them not pancake-y at all.  My husband absolutely loved them!

So absolutely fabulous! We made them into muffins and they were great. Just use the amount for two cookies on one muffin. They don't rise too much, but just enough. Delicious!

Let's not compare apples to oranges.  For what these cookies aspire to be, they are fantastic!  Definitely pancake-ish, but the flavor is there.  Next time I will try the variation another user mentioned.

DEFINITELY use a cooking spray on the cookie sheet otherwise you may have trouble getting them off! Mine were done at 8 minutes, so these should be watched carefully so as to avoid overbaking--which they can't afford since they're so thin.  These are okay to good light cookies, but they become great when you consider how low in calories and fat they are, and they definitely satisfy cravings for sweets or chocolate!

Alot lighter then normal heavy cookie recipes. I like the flavor but the consistency is strange. Will use when I need a quick cookie fix.

These are a great alternative to chocolate chip cookies.  Don't make the mistake I did and put wax paper on the cookie sheet.  The paper stuck and it took me forever to pick it off the cookies.  Otherwise these taste great.  I used milk and white chocolate chip swirls.

I prefer the taste of these over normal chocolate chip cookies. My husband is on a low-fat diet (Alli) and he was dying for some chocolate chip cookies. So now he can finally have them. Thanks for posting the recipe. I am really impressed!

interesting recipe! dough was really wet, almost runny. the first batch did, in fact, appear like pancakes. but actually very tasty, like a pancake chocolate chip cookie. second batch, I added some instant oatmeal to beef up the dough. turned out fine. did make a little thicker, but actually the original recipe is just fine. just takes a little getting used too, but still great

I followed the recipe exactly, and they look nothing like they did in the picture. They flattened out like little crepes, but they tasted amazing. I am going to make these again, but the recipe needs some sort of adjustment.

These were good, they were comparable to the muffin tops that you get at Panera. I added some ground oatmeal along with a whole egg instead of only egg white and that most likely helped with the consistency. Other reviews are right, it's not a typical cookie, but it really helped with my chocolate cookie craving.

I have nothing to say except that I loved it! I used more brown than white sugar. I also had to use butter in place of applesauce cuz I didn't have any. I left it in the oven for 15 minutes which gave it a deliciously crunchy exterior while still having that nice, chewy interior! My go-to healthy cookie recipe.

This was the worst cookie I have ever had!  The batter was runny, so I kept adding a little bit of flour at a time.  I had to pour it onto the cookie sheet, not drop.  They were very chewy...I had to pull on it to get it to tear.  I followed the recipe to a T, other than adding a few extra tablespoons of flour.  I will say my husband really liked them, and he does not like sweets typically.

The texture was weird on these, but it might be because I added oats (instant... next time non-instant as I found they work better in other cookies).  These are good though for a quick sweet fix.  I keep mine in the freezer so I don't end up eating them all at once (defeats the whole low fat aspect!)

The unusually gloppy dough I got when I made these resulted in a deliciously smooth and moist cookie.  A definite favorite with my children, but not so much with myself and my husband.  Both of us prefer a greater texture.  Still, for a cookie that purports to be low in fat, a very good choice.

I think I did something wrong here. They tasted delicious, but they came out rubbery. I think I just didn't add enough flour, because the "dough" was slightly runny for cookie dough. I'm going to try this again and add a little more flour. Otherwise these were fantastic!!!!

Well, the taste was there, I think I added to many chocolate chips, but its nice and chocolatly. The problem I had was it didn't fully "rise" and I used all the ingredients in here. I cooked it for 9 minutes, and it looked like it was done. I also had a major problem getting them off the cookie sheet, not sure why that is, when normally I have no problems, even ungreased. A little too much complication for this recipe. Although they tasted ok. So I gave it a 3 stars, just for taste.

Maybe I did something wrong but this was horrible! I was really looking forward to it b/c we're trying to cut down on fats in our house. This won't be the way we satisfy our cookie cravings. Sorry :(

These are a good alternative to a full fat chocolate chip cookie and can help satisfy a craving for chocolate.  Obviously they do taste different than a regular chocolate chip cookie.  I added cinnamon for a little more flavor.

Surprisingly, these were pretty good, although oddly chewy.  My son is allergic to all dairy and eggs, so we substituted one tablespoon of flax seed and appropriate amounts of water for the egg.  We also were out of regular applesauce, so we used blueberry-flavored applesauce, which gave these cookies a very interesting taste (to say the least).  My son was super-excited to enjoy chocolate chip cookies (we also used semi-sweet chips without dairy).
