I used slightly smaller chicken pieces.. the chicken breast halves cut into maybe half again. Cooked beautifully in the honey and juice over a low/medium skillet. Could maybe add a little more honey if you like a sweet sauce.

I modified this recipe to the ingredients I had on hand.  I also always cook onion and garlic with whatever I am doing so that went in first, then the chicken in bite size pieces, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, honey and some salt/pepper and cooked that about halfway.  Then I added pineapple chunks and adjusted seasonings, letting it cook some more.  Just before serving, I sprinkled sesame seeds on top.  It was a hit!!

I made the pineapple chicken for my boyfriend and I. I added more honey to it and also cut the chicken into bite size pieces when partially cooked. We enjoyed the chicken very. I served it with rice and a vegetable.

Dee-licious.  Cut the chicken into bite size pieces and mixed some poultry seasoning into the flour.  Crushed some pineapple chunks in the food processor with the (probably more than 1/4C, didn't measure!) honey.  Totally forgot the vinegar.  Poured the pineapple and honey into the pan after the chicken had browned and slapped a lid on to let if finish.  No mint.  Would not change a THING.

This recipe has become a household favorite.  I prefer to leave out the mint.  Try cooking the pinepapple with the chicken for the last minute.  It's a great flavor.

My family enjoyed this chicken.  The chicken pieces I used were too thick, it would definitely taste a lot better with thinner pieces of chicken, I think this sauce would work well on wings and drumsticks as well. I cut the remaining chicken into thin pieces and used them for sandwiches the following day, the sandwiches were very tasty.

I just realized that I haven't rated this yet and I'm planning on making it again this week! We all loved it. We made it how the recipe is written except for the mint. We also cut the chicken into bite size pieces as many have commented on. It's so good, and we plan to make it regularly :)

I was looking for something a little different to do with boneless chicken breasts and this was an excellent change of pace.  It fried up beautifully and tasted great.

Sorry but this was so blah! I think maybe more of the redwine vinegar might have helped but there really wasn't even a strong honey or pineapple taste - not sure what I did wrong but I won't be trying this one again.

Nothing special.  Pretty much tasted like chicken and pineapple, but I love both ingredients so it works.

My husband said I could give this 4 stars if I promised to say that it's much better if you mix a little honey and pineapple together to serve on top.  I served this very flavorful dish with plain white rice and string beans.  Yum!

I was looking for something fast and good made with chicken and pineapple and found this recipe.  I made it for supper tonight and it was very good.  I cut my chicken up into small pieces and did not add the vinegar or mint.  Otherwise, everything else was the same.  This is a keeper!  Thanks

Good recipe! However, if you do use the mint, chop it up VERY small! I didn't prefer the texture of the leaves with the chicken, but overall a nice tasting dish!

I found that with the sugars (honey and pineapple juice), it burned very easily, so I recommend cooking on lower heat for a longr time period. It was tasty in the end, though, and easy to make over all.

I used small pieces of chicken but this turned out mushy for me.  I ended up dumping it in a lasagna pan with pineapple chunks and setting the oven on T.Bake 525F and took it out when they started to turn golden brown.  Turned out great but be prepared to do dishes.

This recipe is great! I pounded the chicken to even it out and it is excellent. Adding the honey to the juice thickens it up enough to brush on nicely. I've added the crushed pineapple at the last 5 minutes of cooking and I use red raspberry vinegar to give it a tiny punch of flavor. I've served it with Basmati rice. Love it.

Very basic recipe.  How is it possible to brush juice onto chicken?  I just used the juice and honey and cornstarch to make a sauce. Very ok recipe.

Have you ever made something that was so bad, that for years after you heard about it?  "Remember when you made that pineapple chicken"....  Well, this was it for me.  Sorry, don't mean to be harsh, but it really was that bad....

This was great.  I did cut the chicken into bite size pieces before cooking and cooked most of the pineapple with the chicken but other than that no changes really.

I took a chance & baked this dish with large chicken breasts (unflattened) in this sauce but followed all other directions as is, baked at 375 F for 1 hour - juicy, tasty and easy! Must cover baking dish. I can't wait to to marinade my chicken next time - not for too long though, the acidity from the pineapple tenderizes chicken fast!

This recipe was wonderful, although I did change a few things: I used chicken thighs rather than breasts (they stay moister and have more a Chinese-takeout taste), I dredged the chicken in cornstarch rather than flower (more absorbent and, again, more a Chinese-takeout flavor), and I didn't brush the chicken with the pineapple-honey mixture before cooking. 
*I seared the each side of the chicken for about 2-3 minutes and removed from the pan. 
*I made the sauce by sautéing a clove a garlic (minced) and some ginger, and then immediately added the pineapple juice (all I had was juice, not canned pineapple), honey, and a bit of red pepper flakes. I cooked the sauce for about 2-3 minutes, before removing it from the pan (it makes more sense to cook the sauce first, but I didn't realize this until after).
*I dipped the seared chicken into the sauce before returning it to the frying pan for about 1-2 minutes each side. 
*I added the rest of the pineapple-honey sauce, reduced the heat, and let it simmer until done, flipping occasionally. It doesn't take long to finish, and it falls apart. 
*I served with white rice, spooning some of the cooked sauce over my rice.

Came out perfect, tender and flavorful. I disregarded the red wine vinegar and fresh mint. After coating with flour and then pineapple juice/honey mixture I just cooked the chicken with the rest of the liquid mixture. Delicious.

Overall this recipe was very bland. I thought the mint would have added good flavor, but it actually made it taste much worse. I do not recommend this recipe to anyone.

My husband loved this recipe. I thought it was ok but I like a stronger flavor, and this seemed to be missing something. I will probably make it again though, it's so easy.
