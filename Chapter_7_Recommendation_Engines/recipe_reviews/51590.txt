These cookies are excellent. The first batch I made, I let the butter soften too much before using and the bottoms came out charred. When I tried it a second time, I made sure to use firmer butter and they turned out perfect. I rolled them into round balls before baking and they didn't spread out as much as the first time. The second batch was a definite hit with everyone who tried them!

These were excellent.. I followed the recipe exactly (except I used Hershey's Cocoa powder... because that was what I had on hand). I cooked for nine minutes, and they were just perfect.  I will definitely make these again.

These cookies were dry and cake-like, not chewy like the ones you get at a baker. I used butterscotch chips instead of white choc. chips and the flavor combination was good, but I didn't like the texture of it. I'm still hunting for bakery-perfect chocolate cookie.

My oldest son and I made this about an hour ago, but only a half recipe. I don't know where Nestle gets their numbers from, I was only able to get 18 largeish cookies from one halved recipe. We made no changes or substitutions. We didn't chill the dough, like I normally would have with a cookie recipe that calls for butter which is why I think my cookies spread a little more than usual. 350* for eleven minutes was just right. These turned out nicely, even if they were quite thin. Next time, I'd chill the dough before baking. My son and I were both impatient to see the end product. I think I'd use a whole teaspoon of vanilla next time for a half recipe instead of a half teaspoon.

The family said that these were really yummy and went back for seconds straight away. The only thing that you have to watch is that the cookies don't get burnt as I made about 4-5 trays of them and one of them I had to chuck out as within the space of 1-2 extra mins cooking time they went black around the edges on the bottom.

These cookies turned out great.  The dough was more stiff than regular chocolate chip cookie dough.  They hardly spread and I did pull them as soon as the tops looked set and were just starting to crack which I think helped make them more moist and chewy.  I did have to bake a little longer than specified but I have come to expect that since I bake on stoneware.  I had no problems with the cookies burning like some others mentioned.  I think if you were to leave them in until they look done they would be overcooked and possibly burned.  The only change I made was to use mint chocolate chips in place of the vanilla but I think those would be fantastic as well.

i made these for my boyfriend on valentine's day.  he loved them so much, he refused to share them with anybody.  according to him, it's the best thing i've ever baked.

my mom made this with melted butter, and the cookie dough spread when baking.  they were still good, but very flat.  when i made them, i made sure that i was able to hold the butter with two fingers without it falling apart.  the cookies came out a lot better looking, and more delicious.

These are the perfect cookies! So delicious. I recommend adding even more of the white chocolate chips to make the cookies chunkier and even more scrumptious - though I wouldn't recommend it for calorie-counters!!

I wasn't crazy about these cookies.  In fact, I don't think I will make these again.  They were not moist and the flavor was lacking.  There are a million other cookie recipes out there like this one and I think I would try one of them first.  Sorry for the bad review and I could have done something wrong but....

These turned out very very well with a few tweaks. I agree with a previous reviewer they do have a cake-like consistency but I thought it was really tasty.

I added in a tablespoon of vanilla instead of following the receipe for taste, I melted half of the butter and left half soft to thin out the batter because I use cake flour instead of all-purpose. Thinning out the batter was to make sure it wouldn't be terribly thick and the cookies too dry. With the cake flour I followed to receipe but added 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons. They turned out very very well, moist and chocolaty! 11 minute bake time. Definately does not make 60 cookies!

Perfect!  I don't change a thing when I make them and they always go really fast.  I've never been able to make 60 like the recipe says (I think they'd have to be REALLY small to make that work) but the recipe is still awesome.  Definitely remember to eat one hot out the oven they are fabulous!

Just made these, one word YUMMY! Here is a hint for all those who said they burnt or spread... use parchment paper!  I bake all my cookies and cakes with it.  Cut a piece the size of the cookie sheet, place the cookies on top, no greasing needed if called for or not.  Just be careful as the paper is slippery and will slide. My cookies came out perfect, moist, soft, and a nice shiny top.  I followed the recipe as is but did add chopped macadamia nuts.  This will be my new chocolate cookie recipe. Lots of great ways to change it up, mint chips, peanut butter chips, double chocolate chips...
I did use high quality butter and cocoa pwd. also King Arthurs flour.  I feel makes a big differnce.  Next time I will double the recipe!

I didn't realize until afterwars that this was supposed to make 60 cookies, thankfully it didn't! Lol. It did make a lot though. I didn't melt the butter, just let it sit out and get a little soft, and the cookies didn't spread out or anything while baking. I got a cookie like this at the mall & wanted more of them & this recipe was just what I was after. Yummy cookies:)

Excellent texture, cookies didn't flatten. I've never made cookies without shortening that hold their shape so well as these.

These are THE BEST cookies! Any time I want to have cookies for the family or to give to friends, these are the one's I make. I use Premium Quality "Smooth" White Chocolate chips and it makes them soo much better.

These are so yummy! I actually added a lot more salt than the recipe called for by accident, but they still tasted phenomenal. I also added about a tablespoon of milk into the batter because it was very stiff and hard to stir. Best tasting chocolate cookie I've ever made.

Thanks, @Shadowvee and @She Riot, for the butter tips!  My cookies spread just enough; tips I'll be using for other cookie recipes.  I found they were perfect at 9 minutes--this is definately a timer recipe.  When they cooled, the texture was just right.  I'm thinking maybe just a little orange extract next time.

I have made these a few times and my family really enjoyed them. They spread a lot but it night have been the fact that I used margarine instead of butter. Either way, they were very good

This is the first time I've offered my family a chocolate cookie.  I kept the recipe as it is written, except that, as another rater mentioned, the cocoa I had on hand, and used, was not Nestle's Cocoa.  As far as cookies go, it's fine.  We just prefer regular chocolate chip cookies.

Perfect! I absolutely STINK at baking, but I followed the directions EXACTLY and what came out of the oven was a delicious, crunchy-on-the-outside-chewy-in-the-inside, white-chip chocolate cookie! YUM YUM!

A very yummy cookie! I followed the recipe except for using chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips. I used a cookie scoop & my cookies did not spread much, probably because of the cold temp today. Soft & chewy with a strong chocolate flavor.

these cookies are great, I usually don't rate any recipes, but this one is great I didn't change anything, except I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets and refrigerated the cookies before baking them so they didn't spread.

This is my go-to cookie recipe. My husband always raves over these things, and this is the one recipe that I can always get to come out tasting like it came fresh from the bakery. One tip: make sure you do not OVER BAKE these. Even if they seem a little underdone, that's ideal. Let them cool completely, and you'll wind up with that soft, moist, chewy cookie that will have the masses begging for more. This is also a great dough to refrigerate/freeze for future consumption!

This cookie is delicious and a nice change from the traditional chocolate chip cookie!  I always keep a bag of white chocolate chips in the pantry so that I can make these if I am going somewhere or hosting friends.  As someone who bakes frequently, this is one of the better and simpler chocolate-based cookies that I continue to make!

This is an outstanding cookie. I made my first batch and everyone had seconds (even the people who said they don't like white chocolate chip cookies!). Spread and consistency depend on altitude and dough temperature; high altitude usually requires a little more liquid and less fat while baking cookies immediately after mixing will cause more spread. If spread or flatness are an issue, consider rolling the dough into balls and refrigerating for 1/2 hours before baking. Enjoy!

Dough was very dry and the cookies an odd consistency. More like little blobs of cake that fell apart and didn't look very pretty.

These are good, but they don't spread much unless you flatten the dough. I found the dough so stiff that it was hard to mix, and I have a good mixer. I could only make 36 normal size cookies out of this recipe. I'm not sure this is a keeper...

The dough itself is not very chocolatey.  Maybe the flavour could be improved upon by adding some melted chocolate to the mix, or espresso; I don't know.  I won't be making this again as is.

Made these cookies as is with NO substitutions. The dough was thick and the first bath I made came out too flat because I think the butter was too soft...so I rolled them up again and put the balls into the fridge until firm and they came out perfect :) They are moist, chewy and a mix between cake like and cookie for me :) I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

The dough was really hard to work with, a little too stiff.  I added another Tablespoon of butter, otherwise I didn't change the recipe. Just a heads up about the baking time: 9-10 minutes tops.  The first batch I baked for the 11 minutes and they were very hard after cooling, 10 minutes they were chewy, 9 minutes even better.  Just like brownies, they will be soft from the oven, but will get firmer upon cooling.

These are fantastic!  Tonight is the second time my daughter and I made them.  Very cakey/fudgey. We didn't use regular Nestle's cocoa though.  We got a huge container of special Dutch chocolate and that made them even better!!

Wonderful! My butter was half melted, and seeing other reviews decided to refrigerate them over night (so they wouldn't get pancake like or burned, as others have said). They were perfect! Very chewy (not dough like)- like brownies, but my family loved them. This is one recipe I'm going to use for a long time.

These cookies didn't flatten-out like regular chocolate chip cookies (or at least the ones I make), which I prefer.  However, they turned out okay and tested great.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Baking time was 10 minutes.

Thanks for sharing!

These were great!  I used Hershey's cocoa and 11 oz of white chips.  The dough was very stiff and dry, cookies did not spread when baking.  I baked for 8-9 minutes so they would be soft (they are not chewy). I did bake mine on parchment paper and would make the same way again.

I liked these cookies, they tasted kind of like a brownie to me. My hubby LOVED these, and my two small kids did not like them at all (go figure). THey are very chocolaty, and have a nice texture. On my second batch I added walnuts, and liked them alot better that way.

I don't know if it's just me, but it didn't turn out cookie-like at all. it was more like an airy brownie and didn't spread well. I tried baking it at 9 mins at first, but it was too soft, so i tried it at 10 and 11. Still too soft. Also, a little too much choc chips for me. I just baked 2/3 of the original recipe and froze the rest for later. I might not be trying this recipe again.

These cookies are delicious! They have the perfect texture of being a little chewy and a little crispy. I only made one change and that was replacing the ap flour with whole wheat pastry flour. They took exactly 8 minutes in my oven. My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't really make 60. I made mine quite small and only got 48.

Can't think of a single way to change these!  Mine didn't fall flat, but the butter I used was just room temp!  I must have used a big ole teaspoon, becausee I got 48 cookies, not 60.  Also, glad I have the stand mixer, cause this was thick, thick, thick batter!

Awesome cookies!  Used mint-chocolate chips and baked heaping-tablespoon-sized lumps on stone for 12 mins.  Still soft 4 days later, gone by the 5th day :-)

I thought these cookies tasted really good, the only thing was I couldn't taste the white chocolate chips.  They just blended in with the taste of the cookie.  Next time I will add M&M's or regular chocolate chips as well as the white chips, so that I still get the white colour but also the taste of chocolate chips.

They taste great.  I made them with butterscotch chips instead of white chocolate morsels, and I suppose they would have come out better had I used white chocolate, but they were still good.

Over all, this recipe is only so-so.  From all of the reviews that were given to it, I was expecting something truly spectacular.  Sadly, I was a little disappointed.  Next time, I think I'll up the amount of sugar and add a little more cocoa powder as well.

Great recipe, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  My 12 year old needed a project on a cold January day and thought they were a snap to make!
