This is my original review on this recipe before it was published and I have since made it at least a dozen times: "This might be the best 'specialty' pizza I've ever had in my life....and I can't believe it came from home. My daughter even said I could make money on this and she made it clear that this will be a new 'regular' around here!! I used a pre-made Boboli crust for ease, but we are extra excited to try this on a homemade crust next time. I followed the recipe exactly. No adjustments needed:)" We LOVE it!!!

I made this for Recipe Group. Of course I tweaked (= I used red onion, turkey bacon, and two 4 oz cans of diced jalapeños. I had pre-cooked my bacon, so I used olive oil and butter to sauté the onion and garlic. Then I added the chopped, cooked bacon and the jalapeños, before stirring in the spices and cream cheese. I made a 2 ingredient pizza crust =D and, following Molly's lead, and stuffed it with string cheese, split in half lengthwise. I spread the cream cheese mixture on the crust, then sprinkled the cheeses and parsley over the top. All my tweaks worked fine, and it looked prettier than I expected (= But it set my mouth on fire! Yow! Next time I will use 1/2-1 can of jalapeños! One last, bizarre sounding tweak: after a couple bites, I spread a thin layer of strawberry jelly on the pizza  [that's what I put on jalapeño poppers and the jalapeño popper grilled cheese].

We were really excited about trying this recipe. I followed the recipe with one adjustment. The recipe says to saute the onion in the bacon drippings without mentioning draining. I drained the majority of the drippings away, leaving just enough to skim coat the skillet. Even with that I wish I had drained more and I do think if I were a beginning cook that I might not have known to do that. There was something about the mixture of seasonings that didn't work for us, but we couldn't figure out if it was too much of one or not enough of another. The main criticism we had was too much cheese. It seemed to overwhelm the other ingredients so you had heat and you had cheese while other flavors faded into the backdrop. We like the idea of this enough to keep playing with it but as written, for us, it was OK.

As the submitter of this recipe I want to clarify that PREPARED PIZZA DOUGH PASTRY is raw dough you buy at your grocery store.  You can use pre baked crust such as Boboli but watch your bake time. Be sure to also use the large, 16 inch size, prepared crust.  If you can only find the smaller size then divide the topping between two pizza crusts.

This was the BEST jalapeno popper pizza recipe that I have ever made or tried! I used *Sherri*'s personal recipe 'Basic Pizza Dough' for the crust, and stuffed the crust w/ mozzarella for extra cheesy goodness. This was so good that hubby already said that I have to make this for him to take to the guys at work. I seriously think that I 'sauce' would even be great just as a dip for pita chips, mmmm. I will be using this recipe again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing another winner, Jan! :)

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and made a jelly-roll sized rectangle pizza out of it, and had a little "sauce" left over. I can't handle too much heat, so I soaked the jalapeno rings in cool water for about 1/2 an hour (I had read somewhere that that tames the heat).  They were perfect as appetizer squares!!!

I made two different pizza's for the SuperBowl this year with this being one of them and it was a huge hit. I made exactly as written and would not change a thing. The onions sauteed in the bacon drippings gave it such a nice smokey flavor. I was rushed and didn't take the time to take  the seeds out of the peppers as I normally would have but the cheese and sour cream tamed it down enough that I didn't really need to. This was delish! The boys at the party devoured this before I was even able to take a picture which means I will just have to make it again soon :) Thank you for sharing Jan. I miss seeing you and some of the others around these parts. I plan on "popping" in more often.

This is a great idea...thanks, what's for dinner, mom!!!  I used a homemade crust and we made it on the grill.  I added more jalapenos (I like heat), some sliced onion and more cheese on top. Personally, I would like more of the cream cheese mixture (will try that next time), but it was really good!  Oh yeah...I left out the cumin.  That just didn't seem like it needed to be in there.  All in all, a great recipe!!

This is a delicious pizza and a nice change from one with tomato sauce.  I followed the recipe all the way and it was perfect.  I really loved the bacon on the pizza.  It does have all the flavors of a jalapeno popper.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Recipe Group Selection:  25, January 2014 ~ This was my first time making jalapeño popper pizza, but it won't be my last time.  We loved this pizza!  I used duboo's 'Homemade Pizza Dough' personal recipe for the crust, which I stuffed with string cheese.  I was worried that my husband wouldn't like the pizza because of the cream cheese and the sour cream (2 ingredients he doesn't like) but with the sautéed onions,seasonings, bacon and jalapeños, it was a great blend which he loved.  I used round sandwich bacon and it doesn't shrink up as much as long, standard bacon and it worked really well on this pizza.  Thanks Jan, for another fantastic recipe.

so incredibly delicious. I made only a few minor tweaks...subbed plain Greek yogurt for sour cream and because it's my favorite less-mess way to make bacon, I cooked that on a baking sheet in the oven at 400 for about 15-20 minutes, using center cut bacon so there wasn't too much grease, and then used some of the drippings to saute the onion, garlic, & spices (cooking the spices this way really helps enhance the flavors). I didn't measure the cheese, just eye-balled it -- probably used less than the recipe called for which was perfectly OK, this is a very rich & filling recipe! and then I added little dollops of raspberry jam on top just because that's my favorite dipping sauce for jalapeno poppers so I figured it would be good. Used a pre-made pizza dough (the kind you find in the refrigerated section next to the cookie dough and biscuits) and my hands-down favorite method for cooking pizza (which I learned from Chef John's recipe for Ham, Asparagus, & ricotta pizza, also on this site)...5 minutes on the bottom rack of a 550 degree oven, and then 5 minutes on the top rack. (this gives a perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside crust...mmmmm) The end result was Jalapeno Popper Pizza perfection! My compliments to the creator of this recipe -- it is most excellent!

Terrific! My husband raved about this pizza, saying I could sell it in a restaurant. It was creamy, thanks to the sour cream and cream cheese (I cut the cream cheese down just a bit, but otherwise didn't adjust the recipe). I had to use jarred jalapenos as fresh are hard to find here in France, but happily the vinegar taste cooked out and the peppers were excellent. Great combination of flavors in this pizza, between the smokiness of the bacon, the soft creaminess of the cheeses and the spice of the peppers. My pizza was done in less than 20 minutes, not the 30 as stated in the recipe.

I loved this pizza! I made my own crust & topped it with this recipe and it's now my favorite pizza! I didn't have fresh, so used canned jalapenos, and it was still delicious. If you like poppers, you'll love this. Thanks Jan - great invention!

Wow!  My husband and I love spicy, so it was an easy bet we’d try this, but OMG it was wonderful!  I made two adjustments, which I will unmake next time.  First is cooked the “pre made”crust for 4 minutes befor I put on the toppings.  We like weroll done crust, but next time I will skip this, it was unnecessary .  Second, I used only 2 jalapenos, my husband ask that I try the recipe amount of four next time!  This definitely warms your cockles!  Absolutely wonderful!!  Very differennt , very creative, and very good!!!!

So good--definitely making again. I followed the recipe with a couple of minor changes out of necessity. Used red onion; added fresh parsley after it cooked; used three fresh jalapenos with seeds removed (although I like it hot and spicy). Love the Pillsbury Pizza crust product in the tube.

Made as written.   Used ALL the bacon grease (it's gold).  Sauce was to die for.  Didn't have any heat with the jalapenos.  Next time I'm going to try chopping some jalapenos and layering them under the cheese to see if I can preserve some heat.  Not a fan of the seeds, but I did leave a lot of the inner membrane intact.  I used bagged frozen dough (Walmart) on my big stone platter.  It baked up great in 30 minutes.   Next time, I'm going to precook the dough for 10 minutes, then add the toppings and cook for 20 minutes . . . just to see if the toppings come out any different.  But I have to say, as written it came out fine.   Trying it differently is my thing.  You never know if "better" is around the corner.

I really like the filling for this.  What I had was really 3 stars worth but feel it is my fault as the purchased pizza crust was too thick for this thin crust lover.  Next time I will make my own crust and it will be really yummy!

I made my own pizza dough for this one and it was a hit with my kids. A little more work than a typical homemade pizza, but worth it.

Poppers AND Pizza? It's like a little Game Day celebration in your mouth. Touchdown! We made these exactly as written with lizard_C9's Italian Feather Bread Pizza Dough (my personal fave here on AR). My DH doesn't do well with pepper seeds, so I had to seed the peppers for his pizza. Mine was a combo of seeded and au natural peppers. Mine was better, not because it had more heat (jalapeños aren't very hot), but because it tasted more of the peppers themselves. If you don't want heat, by all means seed your peppers, but I'd suggest using extra peppers to make sure they're not muted by the sauce. Speaking of the sauce, it has a lovely oniony smoky thing going on that would make an excellent base for a mushroom pizza. Anyway, if you like poppers even a little bit, you're going to love this pizza!
EDIT - I've probably made this 8-10 times since my initial review. it is literally our favorite pizza now. An easy weekday lunch crust is Flatout's Artisan Thin Pizza crust, super thin, and just delicious. I keep the base sauce sans bacon grease on hand for several different pizzas, then when I fry up the bacon for this one, I brush bacon grease onto the pizza skin, sauce it, then top it. I bake it in my Breville Smartoven. So easy, and takes less than 30 minutes start to finish. BTW - Jalapeño peppers freeze exceptionally well. Simply slice or dice them, put them in a quart freezer bag, and freeze. They hold their shape and don't get at all watery.

Awesome!! It's a keeper! Our jalapenos weren't quite hot enough for our liking so we added hot sauce as we ate.  I made it as written and it's great.

And Dutch Girl, too much cheese, me being Canadian and you being Dutch, what the hey. Never too much cheese and the Dutch with their Gouda, One of the best cheese in the world.

Love love love. Made exact to a tee. Wouldn't change a thing. Though I will say when you apply the cheese make sure to get it close to the crust. It seems to just melt where it lands as opposed to melding  with the sauce.

Amazing! My boyfriend says he wants this for dinner every night (I wish), we’ve made it twice this week! First time I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was fantastic! The second time I was lazy and bought pillsbury pizza crust and used that instead of actual dough. I also diced the jalapeños and roasted them in the oven first with a little olive oil to cut out some spice as it was a tad too spicy for him the first time. I also preferred this way as the roasted jalapeños seemed to be more flavorful than the raw slices. Lastly I drizzled chili infused honey over the top which I will definitely do every time in the future! As I said the pizza is amazing with absolutely no changes! Highly recommend!

This is the bomb!  We have an outdoor pizza oven and we make this every time we have a pizza party. It is always everyone’s favorite. Of course only ones that can handle the heat though I always try to get rid of the seeds so it isn’t as hot.

WOW, this is my new football Sunday go to pizza!  I did not change a thing!  I did remove most of the seeds and soaked the jalapeno rings in some cool water for about 30 minutes.

This was very good. I made it just as written except made my own pizza dough. Tastes just like poppers. My husband loved and it was fun to make something different and delicious. Great party food. Will definitely make again.

The flavors are great but it's really gluey. It needs a saucy topping, salsa, ranch dressing, something. Also, the recipe never said to drain the drippings but I figured it would be gross if I didn't so I drained it after the onions & garlic were browned.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I made my own dough. I wasn't crazy about the taste of the onion/cream cheese/spice mixture, but my husband thought this was a great dish.

My pizza crust was a 12inch. I think that maybe the issue. It was VERY rich. Too much cream cheese. Maybe if my crust was larger? (12 i think is pretty standard) then, it would have been thinner and better. I will try again with more sour cream and less cream cheese.

We were so excited! There was definitely too much cheese happening. It overpowered all the other ingredients so there was no real taste - those gorgeous onions just disappeared - and the cumin was odd in a pizza. I'm definitely making it again, but this time with oregano/basil/and maybe a little paprika for color, and I'll be reducing the amount of cream cheese/other cheeses as well.

I followed this exactly, so that I might judge the recipe for itself.  The flavor was good.  I think this might be best on a thin crust, as the thicker crust overwhelmed the toppings a bit.  I used home-grown jalapenos, which may have been milder than others, but we found the flavor needed just a little more of a boost.  I will be making this again, but will double the bacon and jalapenos next time.  Great idea for a great pizza!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!   Very spicy (I kept the seeds on the jalapeno's and used 3 very large ones but I love spicy!   The creamy cheese helped calm the spice, it turned out perfect with the recipe as is. 

Definitely will do this one again!

My family loved this!  Very spicy hot.  I used a frozen pizza dough followed package directions for thawing.  Shaped dough, then proceeded with this amazing recipe. I will make this for our next poker party.  Thank you so much for the joy this brought to my family!
