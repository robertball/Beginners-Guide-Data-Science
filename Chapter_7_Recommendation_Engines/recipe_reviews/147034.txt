This is my favorite salad.  I added strawberry cool whip to a vanilla yogurt and a half a bag of mini marshmallows with fresh strawberries!  My family loved it!

This recipe is also great using sour cream instead of yogurt, flaked coconut, chunk pineapple, maraschino cherries, and the colored mini marshmellows.

I really liked this. I took it to a gathering at a friend's house, and her teenaged daughter loved it! I've made regular ambrosia with sour cream, oranges, pineapple, and coconut, but I like the healthier option of using yogurt, and it tasted every bit as good. I think the tanginess of the yogurt offsets the sweetness of the marshmallows, and if your strawberries are a little on the tart side you could balance it out by using vanilla or pineapple yogurt. I might modify my own regular recipe next time, by substituting yogurt and adding strawberries to all the other fruit. Still, this recipe is five-star, just as written. Thanks eclectricity, for a great recipe and a great idea!

I'm the recipe submitter. As of 7-15-09 it has been edited to correct an error I made when I originally submitted it. It now calls for two 16 ounce bags of marshmallows instead of one, and the title has been changed from Strambrosia (I know, I know, it was a phase!) to Strawberry Ambrosia. Remember to drain the strawberries thoroughly, or they'll tint the marshmallows a lovely shade of pink!

I used vanilla yogurt (on hand) and colored marshmallows (also on hand). This was very simple and tasty. I might add more yogurt the next time or cut back on the marshmallows. They seemed to absorb the yogurt after being refrigerated. Delicious!

A little tangy for my tastes - I added a little white sugar and that helped.  I think I will try about a tsp. of vanilla extract next time.

Made this with Greek yogurt. It definitely gets better the longer is sits in the refrigerator.

this was a hit at our Easter table! I used fresh strawberries and threw in some fresh blueberries, too.

I made this last night to go with our french toast. Mr C and my teens wouldn't even try it because it looks different than anything they have had before.  I liked it though.

This is a great salad to use as a dessert with a summer meal, especially a cook out.  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and everyone loved it.  This will be a staple throughout our Summer.  It also makes a lot and would be good for a large crowd.

I had a similar version of this strawberry ambrosia last Thanksgiving. The ‘ strawberry ambrosia bearer’ :) left before I could write down her recipe! I’ve been searching ever since ,and this recipe closely fits the bill. I left out the mandarin oranges and used one can of crushed pineapple ,( like the original salad I loved), and I added toasted walnuts. I served this at our annual family Holiday Christmas brunch and it was a hit!
