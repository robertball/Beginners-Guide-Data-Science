I have been making this for years and have never had any negetive feedback.I roll my chops in flour and brown them before baking,not only does this make a much jucier chop,it also helps to thicken the sauce.

This recipe was great.  I modified it a little, but it turned out amazingly well. I rubbed the pork chops with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper then browned them.  I also added 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon corn starch to the ketchup mixture.  I put the pork chops in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  They were moist and the sauce turned out to be the perfect thickness.

This is pretty tasty and very easy to make with just  a few readily available items! I also recommend covering chops in flour and some seasonings (salt pepper garlic powder..whatever you like) and browning then putting in oven.  Also when you are mixing the ketchup/soda mixture..let it sit in the bowl after mixing for a few minutes, it thickens and makes a thicker overall sauce when cooked.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I was skeptical b/c of the simplistic ingredients but it was wonderful. I did use a few of the suggestions from other reviewers. I floured and fried up the chops before putting them in the sauce to thicken the sauce, it also reduced the cooking time to about 40 minutes. I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 barbecue sauce. I added onions and 2 cloves of garlic minced up. This was great, my husband and kid's loved it! I will definitely be making this soon:) Thanks for such a great recipe!

I can't believe this was so good! I would normally have passed this up, but after reading the reviews, I just had to try it.  I used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and equal amounts of the Coke and ketchup (a little more than a cup)and added a few slices of onion on top of the chops. I took the chops out at the end and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and water.  It was not too ketchupy for us and tasted great over rice. This was so quick to throw together and then fix the side dishes while it cooked.  How simple! Thanks for sharing this recipe - I will definitely make it again...and again..

Don't worry about those reviews who said this wasn't good. It was awsome. I cooked this for my hubby his friend and myself and we all thought it was great.
I spiced it up with garlic powder, seasoning salt, pepper, lemon juice (will ommit next time), a dash of tabasco and 2 tbsp of bbq sauce. I served it up with roasted potatoes (put in the oven at the same time and ready at the same time) and peas and corn. I'll definately make this again. I marinated mine for 2 hours first, not sure if it made a difference or not. TRY THIS

I covered my baking pan, and as a consequence had a lot of sauce, that was very thin.  Will definately make this again, but will bake without a cover to thicken the sauce up.  Hubby says this is actually a seven star recipe.  I did add sliced onions and some garlic powder.

I was hesitant about this because my husband HATES ketchup... but I LOVE it! So I made it with half ketchup and half barbeque sauce, and I used Coke with Lime... which i found was really good because through the sweetness you could taste the lime! Needless to say there was NO leftovers!!!

Very good! I followed a few of the tips of other reviewers, using half ketchup, half BBQ sauce, and I also added in some tabasco and garlic powder. Before putting them in the oven, I dredged the chops in lightly seasoned flour and fried them in olive oil to get a little caramelization and so the flour could thicken the sauce a little. They were very good. I used the extra sauce with added oregano on some pasta and served it as a side dish.

My daughter is taking a cooking class in school and chose this recipe to try.  She read the reviews and decided to sear the chops first and change the catsup to half catsup/ half BBQ sauce from the reviews.  We also added some garlic powder and onions to the mix.  She baked it for 45 minutes at 350.  It was good.  We all liked it.

So easy and so delicious!  I doubled the ketchup, Coke and brown sugar and used boneless pork chops.  I put it all in the crock pot and cooked it low and slow all day.  So tender you could cut the chops with a fork.  Even my kids liked this!   I will definitely be making this again.

The flavor was good, but I give it three stars because 1 hour is too long to cook most pork chops and they gave off a lot of liquid and made the good tasting sauce too thin and runny.  I might try searing the porkchops first and browning them before baking them with the sauce next time.

Excellent way to make chops.  They come out so tender.  I did 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 barbeque sauce instead of just ketchup.  And, like other reviewers, I coated them in flour (seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, & garlic powder) and browned them first.  I did find that most of the sauce burned off in the pan.  I would definitely recommend coating the chops with only 1/2 of the cola mixture for the first half hour of baking.  That's plenty to coat the top of the chops.   Let it go about 30 minutes, take the pan out of the oven, flip the chops, then add the rest of the mixture.  You'll end up with "saucier" chops in the end.  Other than that though, no complaints.  The sauce gave them a really good barbequed flavor.  It was almost like eating some good ribs.

This works great with Diet Coke! This is simple and makes delicious and tender chops and chicken! Cut calories and sugar, but don't sacrifice the taste by using Diet.

This is by far the best pork chops I have ever had. I followed others suggestions and added 1/2 cup honey mesquite bbq sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup. I also seasoned them with garlic,onion,salt and pepper. I also added 1 1/2 cups soda instead of one. Please understand I do not like pork but I will eat it if its made this way. It is soft,flavorful, moist meat. To thicken the sauce I removed the chops and strained the sauce into a sauce pan and added flour to thicken. About 2 tbs of flour. Make sure to stir or it will clump up. Just pour sauce over chops and serve. I like to serve these with either rice or potatoes any style. Do not let the weird ingredients fool you. They are out of this world. Thanks to the author of the recipe for contributing. This is going in my permanent family recipe book. Yummy.

this is the same recipe we use for those premade meatballs in the crockpot for Christmas or Showers.  It works perfectly, and people love it.Just dump the ingredients over top a bagful of premade meatballs in the crockpot and leave on all day.  Yummm.

It smelled great while it was cooking, but....Sauce was way too watery,chops tasted boiled. I even added onion as suggested by other users, & sprinkled garlic powder, paprika, etc on the chops before putting the sauce on them. Not something I would make again.

Had 2 thick cut chops marinating to go onto grill for tonights dinner.  Big boomers and a lot of rain ended that idea and I went looking for recipes. Found this one I had saved and decided it was a little late in the game for anything fancy and I had all the ingredients at my fingertips.  I have to tell you, the chops were juicy, tender and delicious!  The sauce of cola, ketchup and brown sugar was a touch of genius.  I have no idea why I was saving this recipe instead of using it, which I will do often.  Big raves from DH, my favorite critic.  Loved it.  Thank you for sharing!!

Yum! There were so many good suggestions from all the reviews. I chose to make the following changes. I seasoned and browned the pork first. I didn't have enought katchup, so I substituted Banana Katchup (from the Asian market, and a staple in Filipino kitchens). I mixed the sauce ingredients together before pouring over chops. I added 2 tablespoon of onion soup mix to the cola mixture. It was SOOO flavorful! I will make this again, but next time I will try it in the slow cooker.

We love these pork chops!  I don't change a single ingredient and they always come out moist and tasty.  I do keep them covered for 90% of their baking time though.

I thought this was delicious but I did have to modify it a good bit.  I am not a fan of pork chops and wanted to try them a new way.  Since I was not going to be home long enough to bake this, I put it in the slow cooker.  I used 3 cans of Coke and about 3/4 cup of ketchup.  I added 4 pork chops and 2 sliced bell peppers and sprinkled all of it with brown sugar.  I cooked it on high for about 4.5 hours and served it over rice.  I thought it was delicious.  The pork chops were so tender.

I love recipes that involve cola as it adds that caramel/sweetness to the food.  I used this once in awhile and did so this weekend.  The children were skeptical but the middle child actually ate ALL of his vegetables to get 2nds of the chops! :^)

This is a very versatile recipe.  I used a gourmet tomato soup with the cola and the results were two thumbs up!  I also browned the pork and added onions.  Great recipe - very tender pork chops.

Followed suggestions: half ketchup half BBQ sauce, seasoned some flour, coated the chops, and seared on each side before baking in oven.  This will definitely be in our regular rotation!

very good chops. I did not brown mine like others had done. I only made half a recipe. the sauce came out a little to thick for me but other than that they turned out fine. will be making these again.

YUM :-) BE SURE TO GIVE THIS ONE A TRY  I made 3 pork chops with the sauce ratio for 6 pork chops for extra sauce.  I also followed everyone's advise and added garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. Then I coated each side with flower and browned them in peanut oil and followed the rest of the recipe.  35 minutes was perfect for these chops.... and the boyz LOVED them.

Wow, was this good and so easy!  I made this with diet cola and brown sugar splenda.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to brown the chops in a cast iron fry pan then add the sauce and pop it in the oven.  I made twice baked potatoes and the sauce was excellent on them as well....wonderful recipe!

We grilled these instead of baking them.  Next time I will bake them as per the recipe.  It's a good flavor sauce though!

*I tried these again and I LOVED them baked.  I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but these are really good!

Very simple to make.  Dredged the chops in flour, garlic, salt and pepper.  Added the left over flour mixture to the sauce.  Cooked uncovered for 45 minutes.  Served over rice.

Great flavor.  Made the recipe as stated, using diet Pepsi.  I did dredge the chops in seasoned flour and then browned them in a fry pan with olive oil before placing in baking pan.  Hubby who doesn't particularly care for pork chops, really liked the flavor.

Good recipe but made a few changes. I needed a lower sugar content so I used half regular ketchup and half low-sugar ketchup, half Coke & half Coke Zero and added about 1-2 tsp Lee & Perrins. My husband loved it & couldn't tell the difference which was what I was after. Definitely a keeper.

My husband and I thought these were delicious. I followed a few other suggestions posted in the reviews - seasoned the chops with salt and pepper and garlic salt, rolled in flour and browned then put in the oven to bake with the sauce. They were a good blend of sweet and spicy --- I also added a little bbq sauce to the mix. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This is really good if you season flour with salt, pepper and garlic powder, dredge chops, and brown in olive oil before putting in baking dish.

My husband and 2 year old and 3 year old really liked these.  I dredged in flour that I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder and salt and pepper and seared in a pan in garlic infused olive oil before baking.  I baked my about 1 inch thick chops for 30 minutes.

This recipe was great. So easy and tasty. My husband loved it, and he doesn't like trying new things. I did roll my pork chops in flour, pinch of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then I browned them before putting them in the oven. Also, 15 min. before the chops were done I added some french fried onions to the top. Tasted great, thanks for the recipe. Will be using this recipe again for sure.

I added pepper, salt, garlic powder (because my fresh garlic was old), onion flakes and a dash of paprika prior to adding the "sauce".  The recipe turned out very tasty.  I can imagine that without the added spices it would have been very bland.  My boyfriend, ironically, said "it's a keeper!"

Sounds very weird but looked so easy I thought I would try.  Porkchops came out very tender and moist with a great flavour.  Kids loved them and pork is a difficult one to get them to eat.

Yummy.  SO EASY! I read in a few of the reviews that the ketchup was overpowering.  I halved the ketchup which I think helped.  I also follows the suggestion of another reviewer and added lots of sliced onions on top of the pork.  It came out delicious.

I was looking for a quick recipe for chops and this is so easy and great everyone loved it!  I used 4 tablespoons of brown sugar and baked them inside a reynolds cooking bag.  This has been added to our favorites.

This was an easy recipe with lots of flavor, but since I modified it to have bar-b-q sauce instead of ketchup, it changed the dynamic enough to not be fantastic. I marinated the boneless chops for about 2 hours before baking. I will try this again but use it exactly as written to see if that makes a difference. They were very tender and the boyfriend ate every last bite, however he didn't say I had to make this again (usually his way to say its wonderful).

I fixed this for my family last night and everyone loved it. It was put on the "Fix Again" list. I did follow other reviewer's suggestions and did 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce. I also floured and browned the pork chops before I cooked them. I ended up baking at 350 for 40 minutes.

Pork chops are usually pretty boring at my house.  My family rolls their eyes when they know I've got some thawing.  NO MORE!  This was great!  Browned them first with pepper, garlic and onion powders and baked for 30 minutes instead.  YUM:)  Thank you!!!!

It was good...used some of the variations with garlic, etc. The chops are very moist, but unless you like ketchup, I wouldn't bother. My husband is a ketchup junkie, so he loved it. I thought it was fine...something you'd find in a buffet restaurant.

Terrible. I have made these twice-once before using original recipe and again following others advice of using 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 BBQ sauce. Sauce was thin but worse than that was the taste. Very sweet and tasted like ketchup. Will not try again.

Surprisingly yummy. I increased the sauce by half and used root beer instead of cola flavored. Next time I prepare this, I will make it the same way.

This was a hit, with a few changes, with my family.  I did 1/2 and 1/2 ketchup and BBQ sauce, added chopped garlic, and sliced onions.  I also took the suggestion of seasoning/flouring the chops and browning prior to putting them in with the sauce.

It was pretty good, everyone ate it and all said they liked it. Will probably make again. I just wasn't expecting it to be quite so much like BBQ sauce.

Easy and very good. I seasoned my pork chops with season salt and dry onion soup mix and cut up some thinly sliced onions to place on top on them, prior to pouring the cola sauce on the chops. These were good, easy to prepare and moist.

This was very good, much better than I expected.  The cola sort of threw me, wasn't sure how that would turn out but it was great.  I also made a few changes based on other reviewer's tips; i browned the chops after dipping in a mixture of flour, seasoned salt and minced onion, and added about 1/2 cup chopped onion to the skillet while browning.  I also mixed in an additional 1 TBSP of brown sugar with the sauce mix, and after pouring over the chicken, i sprinkled additional minced onion over top.  I only baked 30 minutes and they turned out great!  This one is worth repeating; even my husband thought so!

These were perfect just as the recipe is listed. The only thing I did differently was salt and pepper the pork chops, lightly coating them with flour and browning them in the pan before covering with the sauce and baking. I think the sauce would have turned out thick anyway, though, because it was thick in the bowl after I mixed it together. I used regular Coke for the cola, and these were delicious!

A keeper! I did flour/season the chops then brown lightly before baking. Stayed exactly with the recipe after that. I cannot imagine this recipe without the added texture and thickness of them being floured & browned beforehand. That said, excellent sauce--really tender chops, and they re-heat beautifully in the microwave next day. A definite keeper!

I have been using this recipe for years.  This sauce works well with diet coke/pepsi also.  It works well on any kinds of meat.  Works well in the oven or grilling.  I suggest using it as a marinade if planning to grill.  Let marinate for at least and hour.

Add a tablespoon of mustard to the sauce. Brown a round steak like you would use for swiss steak.Cover it with thinly sliced onions and pour sauce over. Bake as directed and you will have a treat!

This is really great shredded for burritos too! I cook the pork (I have also used chicken) first in the crock, drain and shred, then put the ketchup, cola, salt, pepper, and brown sugar in.  I also add a bit of either red pepper or tobasco to taste just to give it a little kick.  Cook for about another hour.  Slap it in a flour tortilla and top it w/tomatoes, black beans, cilantro, cheese, salsa ranch dressing, green onions, and just a little squeeze of lime.  Very tasty! :0)

This recipe is pretty basic, but after making these numerous times I've found a way to make these have more depth. I rub the chops on both sides with black pepper, garlic powder, oregano and Worcestershire sauce. Lightly brown them on both sides for increased flavour. I use half ketchup and half bbq sauce, also a sachet of onion soup mix and additional garlic powder. I use cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Doubling the sauce amount makes way too much, so I would recommend making enough to coat the chops with a little bit extra for serving over mashed potatoes or some other mashed vegetable. These are a keeper made this way!

The taste was very good.  It was easy to make and my family really enjoyed this.  I too added garlic powder, onion powder and pepper to the floured chops while browning them.  I baked them uncovered and they came out tender and juicy.

I made this for my family.  My husband and 8-year-old thought it was pretty good.  I was reluctant about the recipe at first...to me, obviously, Pepsi is something you drink, not eat.  The sauce almost tasted like a really mild BBQ.  I will make this again although I am always looking for new ways to cook pork chops!

I was looking for a new pork recipe and thought I'd give this one a try.  It was wonderful!  I followed many of the suggested changes - I first dipped the pork chops in flour, added some garlic salt and ground black peper and browned them on each side.  For the sauce, I used a 1/2 cup of ketchup and a 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce instead the 1 cup of ketchup.  I had very thin pork chops so I only cooked them for about 35 minutes, covered.  They were perfect - and my husband loved them and he is very picky about things like this!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a very simple, yet delicious meal. Being Filipina, I usually prepare white rice instead of potatoes with my meats. Therefore, the sauce being too thin, which some reviewers have mentioned, was perfect for me as I used it to drizzle over the rice. Thank you, Kim, for a great recipe! Next time, I'll try this with chicken!

I used half ketchup & half bbq sauce as suggested by other reveiwers. They were no more tender than usual. I will stick to using all bbq sauce. This recipie was not bad, but, rather bland, and the sauce was not sauce, it was watery liquid. Will not be using this again.

I have read many reviews on this recipe that say the meat came out dry.  One way I avoid this is to freeze the chops and then bake them without thawing.  This keeps them VERY moist.  This is a great recipe.  I made a double batch and had the leftovers the next day - they were even better than the first day!!

This was great!  I used fat-free catalina dressing instead of ketchup for a bit more flavor. My husband loved them and they were yummy with mashed potatoes!! Definitely will make them again.

I was looking for something new to try and this was a Big Hit with my family. I also have picky eaters but you couldn't tell by the way they left their plates (completely empty). Thank You!! I also gave this recipe to my sister-in-law to use and she loved it.

This was very good, however the cooking time is way off.  I used thick cut pork chops and they were over cooked.  Next time I will cut it down to 30 minutes. The sauce was very tasty and there was enough to serve over white rice.

Absolutely delicious and super easy. 
I followed another user's suggestion and added thickly sliced onions which made a nice touch to the dish. The sauces goes well served over rice. YUM!

I sauted one minced onion and 4 cloves garlic and added to sauce.  Browned seasoned chops in EVOO (seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic pepper... No flour).  Baked in oven for 30 min.  The sauce was a bit watery so I Removed the chops and added some cornstarch to thicken.  Came out great!

Loved this with a few minor changes.  Like many others, I salted and dusted my chops with flour and browned them a few minutes first.  I used Pepsi since it is what I had on hand.  Instead of getting another dish dirty, I added the sauce to my skillet on the stove.  I covered it up and turned it down to a low simmer and cooked half an hour or so.  Served with white rice.  This really reminded me of sweet and sour pork.  I am making this again soon and I am going to try cutting the pork into smaller pieces before cooking to see how that works.  It was just slightly messy to be trying to cut up the pork chop while it was sliding around on the rice in all that sauce.

this garnered mixed reviews in our house.  hubby said it was ok, but far too ketchupy.  as others have suggested, the 1/2 bbq 1/2 ketchup route is probably how we should have gone, but i wanted to try it as written first.  kids thought it was good, but they drown everything in ketchup anyway, so that makes sense.  i don't eat pork but i put the sauce over the brown rice i made with this dish, and did not like it at all.  i think 1/2 bbq would help...but i'm not convinced the ketchup/soda combo is one i like.  i will try again with the modification for hubs and the kids though.

Didn't love these. They were just OK. Seasoned chops with salt/pepper and browned in olive oil before baking. Followed other reviewers and added worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to cola mixture, and cut ketchup down to 1/2 cup and brown sugar down to 2 TBSP. Baked for 45 mins. but even that was too long. 30 mins. would have been fine. Flavor was good, but not great. Family ate it, but no rave reviews. Sorry.

This was very easy and delicious! The whole family liked it.  I browned the chops first then added some onions and deglazed with the sauce....I put it all in the oven and let it roast for 45 minutes.  Delicious!!

Hubby said it is definitely a keeper. Served over plain arborio rice with green beans.  Even my 3 year old ate half a pork chop.  I used inch thick pork chops, followed the main recommendations of half ketchup half bbq, and seasoned flour browned chops before covering with sauce.  Tweaked spices to our liking of course. No leftovers needless to say! Thanks for sharing.

The Cola Pork Chops were okay. I wasn't amazed by them (nor was the rest of my family). It was very basic. I believe if there was more involved (spices, etc) it could have been a lot better. I'm sure someone else has tweeked the recipe so I'll check on that before I make it again.

I took the other reviews suggestion to roll in a seasoned flour mix and sear before putting them in the oven. I also halfed the sauce recipe since my pork chops were thin and added a little bbq sauce and used cherry coke. They were done in 30 min. So tender you could cut them with a fork.

A very tasty recipe.  Next time, I will make extra sauce to pour over white rice.  I added minced onion to the recipe and also seasoned the pork chops well with salt and pepper. I then browned the pork chops before putting them in the oven.  They came out tender, tasty, and moist.

This was very easy. The pork was very tender. However, there was something missing. I haven't figured it out yet but it needed something else to make it to that 5 star rating.

Excellent and so easy to make.  I have served this several times and everyone has raved about it.  I make it with and without chopped onion and bell pepper, just depends on if I have them in stock, both ways are very tasty.  Served over Jasmin rice makes it a perfect dish.  I  always use 1/2 Ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce.  Hint, make extra sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

First off I hate pork chops but these were so delicious I ate one and a half, my whole family raved and wants to use the glaze on ribs next time. I dredged the pork in flour and browned on both sides so the sauce would get a little thicker as it cooked just like suggested by other reviews, cooked for 50 minutes and the pork was perfect! Also seasoned pork w/salt,pepper, onion and garlic powder and added sauteed shallots to the sauce.

Not bad as written. It tastes fine but it could definitely use a little more flavor.  It basically tastes just like what it is; soda and ketchup. Next time I think I'll add some onion or garlic like others suggested.

I've been making this recipe for about a year now and it's pretty much become a weekly must have for my family. The only difference in how I make it is I add the brown sugar into the cola and ketchup mixture before pouring it over the chops, then I sprinkle a little more brown sugar on top. For heat, some times I'll add about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

This was great!!!!!!!  I did add some garlic, toch of honey, and red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I also took the pork chops out after cooking and added a little flour to the sauce to thicking it up.  I place the pork chop on top of mashed potatoes and drizzled sauce all over....my husband and kids LOVED it!

These were wonderful.  My husband was at first skeptical about the cola but raved over the taste.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, it's perfect as is.

This recipe was great!  I did tweak it a little.  I did what some of the others did and did half ketchup and half bbq sauce.  Also, instead of using brown sugar I used a little bit of honey.  I also put crushed red pepper and garlic powder in mine.  My family loved it!  I will definately make this again soon!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed instructions mostly as written. Took some advise from other reviews and I browned the chops before baking in oven. I added some minced garlic to the cola/ketchup mixture for added flavor. My family loved it but I thought it was okay - nothing against the recipe - a bit too sweet for my tastebuds. Nevertheless, I am a fan of any recipe that gets my picky kids to eat.

These were delicious!  I used pepsi and let the sauce sit after mixing like other comments suggested.  I also seasoned the meat with garlic salt, pepper, coated them with flour and browned them in a pan with a little olive oil before putting them in the oven.  Delish!  Will definitely make again!  :)

Everyone raved at how tender the meat was and how tasty. We used lime diet cola, for the more sugar sensitive in our family. Easy to prepare in a pinch.

Simply delicious!!  Followed other users' suggestions and added some hot sauce, used 50/50 ketchup and bbq sauce and put in minced garlic.  Topped the cutlets with sliced raw onion before baking.  Everyone enjoyed the meal.

I browned the chops briefly w/ flour and olive oil.  I used ketchup, some spicy BBQ sauce and Dr. Pepper since we were out of coke.  EXCELLENT!  I think I'm going to try this for BBQ sandwiches.

Like most of the dishes I cook, I was attracted to this recipe because of its simplicity and the great ratings by members.  I mixed together and marinated the chops for a couple hours, I grilled our chops.  The chops were moist and juicy but the marinade reminded of the market brand OPEN PIT BBQ sauce [that my parents used years (and years) ago and that I did not like back then].  It's a decent recipe but I do not think I will be using it again.

I tried this since a few reviewers that said their kids liked this. My nephew was thumbs down (oh well).  My sister and I thought it was ok but nothing to rave about.  I made as recipe stated but if I try this again I will definitely use 1/2 bbq sauce.

I made this according to the recipe. My husband & I enjoyed it. I agree with the suggestion to adjust the cooking time according to the thickness of the pork chops. Quick, easy meal when served with baked beans and cole slaw.

I thought this was awesome - I did take another reviewers suggestion and browned the chops first and added 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp cornstarch. The thickness of the gravy was perfect.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and I halfed the ketchup with half BBQ sauce (Krafts Thick and Spicy Brown Sugar).  Also I topped the pork chops with sliced onions.  And finally I dredged the pork chops in flour seasoned with onion garlic powder then browned in olive oil.  My husband and I liked it a lot and will make it again.

Yummy! Browned chops with garlic powder and pepper, then used half ketchup and half bbq sauce with almost a whole onion and minced garlic added to the sauce. It makes a lot of sauce, so if you have 5 or less chops you can cut it in half safely.

My kids loved the chops!  I used a few suggestions from other reviewers that I found helpful.  I seasoned the chops with slat, pepper and garlic powder and then dredged them in flour and browned them in oil.  I placed these in my crockpot and covered with 1 cup cola, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1/4 cup ketchup and 3/4 cup beef broth.  This was a necessity since I ran out of ketchup.  I then place some sliced onions on top and cooked on low for about 7 hours.  They turned out great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used with a pork roast, slow cooked for 8 hours while at work.  Shredded it and had a delicious pulled pork sandwich.  WIll try also as written.  Nice and easy recipe, few ingredients.  A keeper for my busy lifestyle!

My mother  used to make this from a recipe book that she picked up at a garage sale once called Cooking With Coca-Cola. She lost the biik 12 years ago when she moved so when I saw the recipe I was so excited. My mom used it on ribs, chicken, pork chops and any thing else she could think of in the  book it was called Cola Barbeque, thank you for posting this wonderful recipe I can get my five year old to start eating meat again.

Recipe looks very tasty.  I will try it.  I've been using coke to cook a ham for year (my mother's recipe). You must use real cola, diet won't work.  I also used brown sugar to glaze.  I must say it is a great combination.

Super easy and my family really liked it, what more could you want.  I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup bbq sauce.  I used thin sliced pork chops so I baked 25 mins covered and then 10 mins uncovered.  Also sliced an onion and threw it on top of the mixture for added flavor.

suprisingly good. I followed some reviews and added flour, garlic/onion powder, and pepper all to taste and the family loved it. Ate it all up. Going into the recipe box!

Very Good. I make them whenever I can't think of something to cook for dinner. I leave the brown sugar out to cut back on calories and it is still delicious.

Excellent recipe.  I had everything on hand and threw it together in no time.  I made a rub of 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1/8 tsp. of sage for the chops, dredged them in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, browned them lightly in olive oil before baking for 40 minutes.  With two big men in the house those chops never had a chance.  Thanks for a great tasting recipe  :)

I made this last night for my boyfriend, who's a real beef lover, and he couldn't get enough of it! It was super easy and very delicious. As other reviewers have suggested, I used half ketchup, half barbecue sauce. It really gave it an extra zing. I would also recommend pan searing the pork chops before baking them. It helps lock in the moisture and cuts down on the baking time. I can't wait to make the sauce again and pour it over ribs!

This was so easy and it was delicious!  My husband hates ketchup but he couldn't even tell that it had ketchup in the sauce (of course I didn't tell him, either).  My 2 year old loved this too - he kept asking for more!  I'll definitely make this again!

Wow!!  I love simple recipes that come out this amazing.  I took people's advice and I lightly dusted the pork chops in flour and garlic powder and browned them in my Le Creuset dutch oven on top of the stove with a tiny bit of butter while the oven preheated.  Once they were brown I poured the sauce over the top, sprinkled on salt and pepper and transferred the whole pot uncovered to the oven for 40 minutes.  When I pulled them out of the oven they were just PERFECT!  The sauce had gotten thick and carmelized and even though I was scared it would be too sweet it really wasn't at all.  I love having recipes that I don't have to go to the store to get any of the ingredients for and this one is perfect.  Cola Pork Chops are going into my regular rotation of easy weeknight meals.

We made this tonight, it was really yummy. I used half a cup of ketchup and half a cup of BBQ sauce.  I also dredged the chops in flour before cooking, that helped to thicken the sauce.  I will make this again!

I made this last night and my husband asked me to plan to make this every couple weeks.  At other's suggestion I coated with flour, thyme, salt and pepper. then browned in garlic infused olive oil.  Added mushrooms and onion to saute last couple minutes then placed over chops when adding sauce.  Also added a few red pepper flakes to the sauce before baking. Very simple but good.

My family loves pork chops so I was looking for something new to try and came across this recipe. The only change I made is that i seasoned my chops with garlic and onion powder before placing in baking dish and i added sliced mushrooms and sliced onions on top of them before covering with sauce. The pork chops turned out very tender. Will definitely make this one again!

I lightly browned like other suggested.  I added a little of this and that (A1 Steak Sauce, Tabasco Sauce, a bit of soy sauce).  I think next time I will do more A1 and less ketchup so that it will cut the tanginess of the ketchup.  And I will add a little more tabasco to add a spicy level to it.  But it was very moist.  And I will try to make it again because my husband enjoyed it a lot.

I loved it! Can't wait to try it on chicken now :) I usually find pork chops pretty bland and dry but this was a delicious treat for me when it came time to cook our pork chops. Thanks! And one tip with pork chops *that I didn't notice* is covering the pan with aluminum foil to lock in the moisture* :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this twice.  The first time, just like the recipe states.  I think I would have given it a 2, only because the chops were very tender.  I changed up and used barbeque sauce, added a dash of this and that, and the chops were a little better.  Not one of my favorite recipes, but definitely makes a tender pork chop.

These were great! I used a can of tomato soup instead of ketchup, since my husband & I are not big ketchup fans. I added some Worcestershire to make up for flavour, and sprinkled onion powder & garlic powder over the whole thing once it was in the pan. Delicious! Hubby loved it, too! I'll definitely make this again.

These were incredibly moist I must say. I am from the south and usually fried pork chops is the only way to go. But I wanted to try a pork chop recipe that baked them.  This was a great starter recipe , teaches you a good barbeque sauce and baking technique. The sauce was a little sweet for me, I would add some heat to it if you are not really into sweet BBQ sauce. Adding your fave spice would do fine. The end reslut was some wonderfully moist BBQ baked pork chops. A good basic recipe worth experimenting with.

This is a fantastic recipe. Instead of all the ketchup though, I mixed 1/4 cup of Hoisin source with 1/4 cup of ketchup. I also added 1/4 tsp of ginger, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and  1/4 teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes, as well as browned the chops in extra virgin olive oil before putting them on the baking dish. It turned out great. The tangyness of the Hoisin source completed that of ginger wonderfully. Everyone had seconds, including my picky mother-in-law.

I followed the recipe exactly (except for sprinkling the top with chopped onion) using butterflied pork chops but I think one hour was too long to cook them as they weren't that thick. Thusly, the pork was a little bit drier than I would have licked. The meal was tasty so I think I would try it again but I would cook it only for 45 minutes the next time.

The family loved them!!  I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Next time I will make rice or egg noodles for the sauce.

You can use this Cola BBQ sauce on any meat from pork to chicken to ribs. I used Vanilla coke and it gave the meat an amazing flavor. Also, I substituted 1/2 cup thick and spicy BBQ and cut the ketchup in half for a little more of a kick This also helps to thicken the sauce. I made a simple dry rub of ground pepper, garlic powder and onion powder for the meat before placing the sauce on them. Turned out great!

This gave me the idea to mix two different recipes on this site. Instead of cola I used root beer and added 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and chopped onions. The recipe turned out to be 5 stars, but I changed it so much I feel bad rating this one 5 stars.

I need another * for this recipe.  Suberb on pork chops, super good on chicken and going to try it on steak next.  No fuss, easy to prepare and outstanding to eat.  Husband asked for a straw for the left over sauce - needless to say - he didn't get it - lol.

I used this recipe to marinate steak in and they turned out great.  I then boiled the left over 'marinade' and it makes a great bbq sauce.  I'd recommend trying this one.  Thanks!

I used 4 butterfly chops and followed the  directions for 4 servings.  My family thought it was pretty good, not fantastic.  We will add this recipe to menu again.

I never would eat pork chops but my husband loves them. When I saw this recipe I decided to give it a try. I love it. The cola and ketchup blend well together. Even my husband enjoyed it. Thanks for a recipe that allows me to eat Pork chops.

This was great with a few alterations I made. I seasoned the porkchops heavily with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and black pepper on both sides before placing in baking dish.  I topped the pork with sliced onion rings and then poured the cola mixture and baked covered for 1 hour in a 350 degree oven

Yummy! The only revisions that I make for this recipe is to add a little less cola so that the suace isn't as watery and add a little worcestershire sauce.I marinate these for as long as I can before baking or grilling.Thanks for the great recipe!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of the pork chops and it worked out great.  The chicken grabbed the flavor very well.  I added some diced onions, coarse deli mustard, garlic, and a tiny bit of tabasco to add a kick. I let the chicken soak for 2 hours then baked it at 350 for about an hour and a half.  Everyone loved it!!

I grilled these instead of baking.  The chops were moist, and I made a gravy out of the marinade that was just ok.

excellent recipe. It got great reviews from my home. It's a recipe you can throw together in 2 min pop in the oven and forget about it. However I did not add brown sugar, I thought it was already sweet enough. Keep up the good work with the great recipes!
And thanks

I made it with brown sugar and pepsi the first time and it was a big enough hit that I made it again-without the sugar this time. I'll do it again without the brown sugar. It was surprisingly good-all my picky eaters loved it and so easy!

Very tasty. I was using butterfly pork chops, so I increased the temperature to 375 F, and baked them for 30 minutes on one side, 40 on the other, basting every 15 minutes or so. Came out very moist and flavourful.

I've been making this for years but without the brown sugar.  I also cook the chops until the sauce is thick.  If you want an easy BBQ style pork chop, this is it.  My husband asks for this dish!

I was very skeptical with the recipe... Now this is one of my favorite dishes I did make some adjustments like instead of one cup ketchup. I did half BBQ sauce and the other half ketchup. I also dipped my meat in flour and browned my meat. IT was great I will be making again!!

I have to admit I was skeptical about this one..but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. So glad I did!! I rolled in flour, seasoned with garlic, onion, salt and pepper, then browned them before baking in the sauce for 30 minutes.....and it was FANTASTIC!  Thank you!

I really like this recipe and it always turns out well. I agree with other reviewers that browning first does add a lot of flavor, but still good without that step. I omit the sugar, add onions and use garlic salt. baking time is usually less than an hour for me. also great over rice.

Very good recipe nice change to the normal pork chop recipes. Tangy and moist I took some changes from other reviews to incorporate into my dinner tonight pan flash fried the pork chops before I baked them with flour salt pepper and paprika. Then before I poured the sauce over them in the baking pan I placed butter in between a few then poured the sauce and salt n peppered on top. They came out juciy and moist so yummy. Will try with chicken next time. :) once you try this easy recipe you won't regret you did!

My friends love this recipe! I used egg wash, flour and panko bread crumbs. Fried them in peanut oil. Placed them on a rack to drain. I cooked the sauce ingredients on the stove top to thicken it, covered the chops and baked until done. Served with tossed salad and baked mac. We are having it again tomorrow night.

Really yummy idea. I made a few changes though. First, I used chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand. I also omitted the brown sugar and used 1/4 cup bbq and 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/2 can of Coke. The other reviews all mentioned how juicy their versions were so I wanted to cut down on the liquid. I sliced onion and added garlic powder, onion powder and fresh pepper. The chicken came out very tender and flavorful, the sauce yummy and SWEET despite omitting the sugar. Paired it with lightly buttered pasta and that cut the sweetness. Very yummy! Will make again and again.

Super easy-super yummy--the whole family LOVED them and they are finicky bunch. Read the reviews and since we don't eat pork used turkey chops floured and pan fried in olive oil first, also used half bbq sauce and half katsup and cut brown sugar in half--delicious!

I made this for the first time last night and it was awesome!  I did cut down a bit on the ketchup and seasoned the chops with salt, pepper and garlic before adding the sauce.  I also only put about 1/2 the brown sugar in the sauce and sprinkled the rest on top of the chops.  Baked for about 50 minutes and served with rice!  Even my picky husband who hates anything new liked them!

I changed this up a bit partly based on other reviews. I coated the chops with a mixture of flour, garlic powder and s&p and browned a bit. Instead of ketchup I used a raspberry chipotle barbeque sauce and omitted the brown sugar. It was really excellent. I'll do this again for sure. It was a very interesting flavor mix.

I took the suggestions of others and dipped in flour and pan fried for a bit. I also used half ketchup and half bbq and cooked for 40 minutes. Fiance and I both liked it but I think next time I will skip the BBQ as I feel it overpowered the flavor

This was my first time ever attempting putting any meat in the oven [as I'm only 15 ... but found myself cooking for me and my 9-year-old younger brother one afternoon] ... BUT I used a pork tenderloin instead, and put garlic to give it a hint of something besides pepsi and ketchup ..and I can honestly say it was a success..unfortunately, to me, it smelled better than it tasted, but my little brother who never eats rice, ate all the rice with the sauce on it .. so i would think it's a success.. Definitely a keeper and will be kept for any future dishes I want to make that are easy :) Thanks!

I love this recipe and my family does as well.  I tweaked it by adding copped green peppers to the sauce and applying onion and garlic powder to the chops before sauce application.  The rice in the picture is a great side dish for this because its great for soaking up that sweet, tangy sauce!

Great recipe! It make a lot of sauce with this. I serve it with rice. The kids enjoyed it. 

This would be GREAT in a crock pot with chops, ribs, or any pork. It would also work great for smoked sausage, party franks, or a twist on jerk meatballs, with cubano peppers and onions even for parties.
The sauce would thicken a bit more I think in the crock pot as well. For a tangier sauce add a bit of vinegar or orange juice.

Very easy to make.  The only thing I added was an onion thinly sliced on top of the pork chops and then poured the sauce over the onions and pork chops.  The sauce had a good flavor and the pork chops were moist and tender.  Will definitely make again.

These were sooo good.  My family (and me) loved them.  I did brown them before and did the 1/2 ketchup/1/2 bar-b-que sauce.  They were so tender.  Yum.

Both of my boys (17 & 6) were somewhat doubtful about making a sauce from cola and ketchup! They thought mom had lost it, but this was fun to prepare (they helped) and the whole family loved it! YUM! I am adding this to my weekday meal lineup. Thanks!

My family and I love this recipe! Like some of the other reviews mention, I also dredge in seasoned flour (black pepper, seasoned salt, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder) and pan sear first. While pan searing I splash a little white wine in the pan to deglaze the pan. And the only thing I have added to the sauce is molasses. But the sauce is delicious with or without the molasses.

Wasn't bad - a change from what I usually make. But it won't be a favorite. Sauce was too thin and a bit boring.

I must have done something wrong- my sauce was bland and very runny- didn't coat the chicken at all- also had a funky taste.

Loved this recipe. It has great flavor and the pork chops turn out very moist. I did change it up a tiny bit. I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder, onion salt and season salt. Then I dipped them in eggs and flour. I also seasoned the flour with the above items and chopped onions/garlic. I put foil over the top while cooking. This will be my #1 pork chop recipe.

Great pork chop recipe.  I seasoned our pork chops with onion salt, garlic powder, and pepper, floured, and browned them.  Otherwise followed the recipe and really enjoyed them!

Not sure why people are so into this....ours were very tough and just tasted like pork chops covered in ketchup. I'm used to my pork chops being fall off the bone good...and these are not.

easy recipe.  I did 1/2 ketchup and Bar-B-Q sauce and crushed hot pepper flakes.  I served it over rice.  I also used a whole pork tenderloin and marinated it for a few hour.  Fast and Yummy!!

I thought these were fantastic! I took the advise of others to make them with 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 barbecue sauce. I also added some crushed red peppers and Mexican chili spice. They were DELISH! MY hubby loved them too! I will definitely make these again! Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I wasn't too sure about the ketchup, but made it as the recipe states, just added a few spices..a cajun spice, garlic, onion powder.  Marinated them for about an hour and baked in the oven.  Hubby hates ketchup, I didn't tell him what was in the sauce, he ate it right up and had seconds!  Will make again!

These tasted surprisingly great, considering there's very little to it! I marinated our two chops for a few hours and then baked them for 35mins uncovered. I used diet Coke, and they tasted sweet, but not overly so.

Tried this for the first time and it was amazing! I did add a few mods to it though. I did the 1/2 bbq sauce and 1/2 ketchup, but my husband said all he could taste was the bbq sauce, so I'll stick with ketchup. I also only used 1/2 a tbs of brown sugar. Before putting the chops in the pan, I dumped them in salt, pepper and garlic powder. When they came out I added flour to the sauce to thicken it. They we very juicy and tender! I HIGHLY recommend them!

Yummy pork chops. I used 4 thick chops and the amount of sauce for 8 servings. Before baking I floured the chops, seasoned them with (garlic powder, onion powder, a little paprika, and salt and pepper), then lightly browned them. I baked the chops at 375 for approximately 35 minutes. Once out of the oven I removed the chops from the baking dish and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Served with white rice it made a quick and tasty meal.

Pretty darn good! Used half ketchup and half bbq sauce instead of all ketchup, and chicken instead of pork. It came out wondeful and not to sweet.

These were wonderful and very easy!  I baked them without covering them because I had seen other people say theirs came out too thin.  Mine was just right!  The pork chops come out fork tender.

This was a really quick and easy recipe, and it turned out great.  I used Mountain Dew instead of cola and added a touch of onion powder when I salt & peppered it.  Quick, easy, and no fancy ingredients!  Love it!  thanks for posting!

Better then expected. Pan fried first, dusted with flour/garlic/salt. Then put in the oven... and used 1/2 bbq sauce, 1/2 ketchup. Sauce and pork went well with rice.

Good chops.  I couldn't resist enhancing this dish just a bit.  I seasoned the chops with kosher salt and ground pepper.  I browned the chops then removed them to the baking dish.  I sauteed some onions and mushrooms in the same pan, then covered the chops with that mix.  Poured the sauce mix over all and only baked for 30 min.  Turned out very good.  Thanks Just_Peachy.

This recipe was ok. My husband loved it but I didn't care for it at all. It was very easy to throw together. I didn't flour and brown them like others did. Maybe that would have made it better.

I browned the chops and added mustard, soy sauce, and minced garlic to the sauce.  It came out great.

One hour was way too long for my chops. I pulled them out at 45 minutes and they were a little charred (okay with me) and dry. Otherwise this was yummy. The sauce smells like A-1 steak sauce when you make it, so I knew the family would love it. They did!

I floured chops with garlic powder, onion powder, S & P.  I also added a couple drops of hot sauce to cut down on sweetness (next time add 3-4 drops).  Baked 40 min uncovered and half way thru, basted.  Very yummy!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, who isn't a big pork chop fan.  It turned out really great.  I used about 3/4 cups of barbecue sauce and 1/4 cup of ketchup. I rubbed the chops with a little bit of pepper and garlic salt and a dash of paprika. The sauce came out really well. I made 4 chops and it was the perfect amount of sauce for 4 chops.  Next time I will probably try and brown them to retain some of the juiciness.  Pork chops do have a tendency to get a little dry easy but the sauce was awesome! My boyfriend said they were really great and ate two of them.

Eh!  This was ok, particularly if you have cola to use up.  Very easy, and most uses things you have on hand. I'd put onions in it if I make it again.

I made this receipe but I did it on the stove top and just simmered it. I also added sliced peppers and onions on top of the pork chop before adding the cola mixture. It came out tender and the sauce was very rich and thick

Very easy, and very good! I wasn't sure how all that ketsup would fare with my kids, but they cooked up just wonderful. Sweet and tangy and just about the easiest thing to throw together at the last minute, esp when the pantry level is getting low! I did dredge them in flour, salt and pepper and quick browned them before baking--which seemed to seal in moisture.

Great recipe--I took the advice of the other reviewers: 1/2 BBQ, 1/2 ketchup with the cola mixture. I also floured (seasoned) & browned the chops first. I also put the cornstarch in the marinade to help thicken. Warning--make sure the bottom of your oven has foil or something b/c this dish bubbles quite a bit and makes a mess--well worth the mess though!!!

I had never heard of this recipe before. I could not believe how good the sauce tasted, I noticed when I was mixing it that it smelled like A-1. It was almost like a different version of it. Very simple and very tasty.

Fantastic Recipe!  Breeze in prep! I've tried this on pork chops, pork roast and meat loaf. All recipes are delicious. Being used as a topper for meatloaf, makes the meatloaf out of this world!! Thank you for sharing!!

This is a very easy recipe, however, a little bland. The sauce is a "lite" barbeque sauce. I made the recipe as stated, but would recommend cooking in a slow cooker next time.

I liked them, but they seemed like they needed a little something extra. I put them in the crock pot and added a little barbeque sauce along with the kethchup. That helped. I'll probably try them again sometime.

This was a good sweet sauce.  I used Dr. Pepper since that was all I had and I'm not sure if the soda type matters, but the sauce was covered all over the cooked pork chop, yet it was difficult to taste unless I rolled it in the drippings.  I will definitely try this again, but I will inject some of the sauce into the pork chop before cooking next time.

This recipe was excellent. My 8 year old son watched as I poured the coke in with the other ingredients and said "that looks gross..coke on pork chops!"  However, he could not get enough of it.  Now, it's his favorite recipe.  He wasn't even a big fan of pork chops before!

I used Dr Pepper, our favorite soft drink.  I only used 1 1b. of pork chops so I ended up with a lot of extra sauce.  This tasted pretty good, will try to make again.

I have to give this one 5 stars! It's tasty,cheap, the chops are so tender and easy to make and something even my kids love...and that in itself is a miracle! Personally I prefer to use only boneless, thick cut butterfly porkchops.

I gave this a 4 star. I tried this on chicken. I made the sauce and marinated it for 2 hours and then grilled it. When I read the reviews it said it was grillable. But I found it was not so. First the skin of the chicken got really chared and that was because of the sugar. I'm going to try this on pork chops and bake it, I suppose that is what I should have done with the chicken. Next time I will know better.

My husband isn't big on ketchup, so I used barbecue sauce in its place 1/2 cup, and 1/4cup A-1 sauce. Other than that, it was ok, but not as good as I had anticipated.

A good "novelty" recipe. Do be careful with cooking times if you are using a thinner chop.

This recipe was really good.  I love the sauce, I think I might use this sauce on other other meats.  It was great.  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks for an easy and yummy pork chop recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand, and it was super quick to make.  I did brown the pork chops in a bit of flour and seasonings as others suggested as I decided to try this at the last minute and wanted to cut down on the baking time.  My two young daughters (4 and 2) gobbled this up with rice.
**Update - I'm now a full-time working mama, and made this in the slow cooker - amazing!!!  Pork chops were sooo tender - a must try!!  I added a bit of garlic powder and mixed half ketchup, half bbq sauce.  Would take the time to thicken the sauce up next time around.  A keeper!

My mom made a similar recipe when I was a child, but using vinegar instead of cola and using spare ribs instead of chops!  Loved it.  I like using beef ribs or chicken! Definately cook uncovered so sauce will thicken.

I usually don't like pork chops but I will eat them for something different.  I made this recipe with my pork chops the last time and I loved them. My husband and toddlers also ate them up,wanting more but there was none left. I think the only change I put Lowery salt in the mix also.

It was the reviews that made me want to try this one. I would have passed but everyone else said it was good, so I gave it a go! The best part? Only 3 ingredients in the sauce and no real prep - perfect for a busy evening! Using thin cut chops, 40 minutes was sufficient cooking time.

This was not as flavorful as expected. I did flour and brown the chops first, with seasoning. Sauce did not thicken as some of the others have said. My family was not impressed, I do not think I will make these again.

This recipe is awesome. I was a little hesitant about the ingredients, but it turned out really good. I only used 4 pork chops and double the "sauce" mixture and served over rice. I will be making this again!

It was OK, but I probably won't make it again.  I floured and browned the chops with onion & garlic powders and pepper after reading the reviews.

I was plesantly surprised at how good this sauce was!  I took other reviewers advice and seasoned some flour (salt, pepper, Italian seasoning) and then coated the boneless loin chops with the flour.  Then I browned the chops for about 8 minutes in olive oil.  I used some spray cooking oil in the baking dish (highly recomended or the sauce will take forever to clean up from the baking dish!) and put about half of a Mayan Sweet onion that I had sliced up on top of the chops before adding the sauce.  The chops cooked in less than 30 minutes and the combination of the onions with the sauce was terrific.  Will definately use again!

Delicious!  Took the advise of others and coated with flour and seasonings and browned in a pan. For the sauce I also  used half ketchup and half barbecue. My chops were thin but still took about 45 minutes to cook through. Served with sweet potato fries also from this site. No leftovers!

Was a bit disappointed with this one. Cooked it as per recipe. When removed from oven, the chops are saucy on top but are sauceless and watery on the bottom. Probably will not make again since there are so many better pork recipes out there.

These were the most tender chops I've ever prepared!  The recipe was so easy, too. As others suggested, I browned them a little first before baking. Advice: if you have a picky eater, don't tell them they were baked with cola. My husband bragged on them but snurled when I mentioned coke. (He still gobbled them up).

This is so good! I tried a few of the suggestions from other users.. I rolled my chops in flour and browned them before baking, and I also lined the pan with aluminum foil (I don't know if that made them more tender, but it sure made for easy cleanup!!) I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce because I'm not a ketchup fan and it was good! My hubby hates sweet things but he really liked these.

great recipe!  I was looking for something fast with some chops I bought.  I did use 1/2 chili sauce and 1/2 ketchup, and seasoned the chops with s/p and a little of Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion seasoning.  Next time I will use the full cup of chili sauce instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  I will also add some thinly sliced onions on top next time too!  I cooked 8 chops for 30 minutes on 350 and it was done perfectly!
thanks!

I liked this combination of ingredients and the taste was very good. I also added some onions slices and garlic slices and covered the dish for the first half hour with foil

Made this for the first time tonight.  It got rave reviews from the family.  I did brown the chops in a pan and added a little flour with the sauce in the frying pan to thicken it before putting into the roaster.  The chops were tender and very delicious!

I remember my dad making this when i was a child and it was sooo good! But this version did not compare. He made it in an electric skillet instead of the oven. The cola became syrupy and intensified the sweetness. The oven baked method made the sauce very thin and it hardly had any flavor. I wont try this again until i get that electric skillet.

This was a good basic recipe for pork chops.  I used half bbq sauce and half ketchup as others had suggested.  The sauce was a little runny.  So I added a little cornstarch and cold water(that I had mixed together first) to the sauce and boiled it for a few minutes to thicken it. I will make it again.  Thanks!

I did this with boneless ribs. The sauce was slightly thin but I could've fixed it if I wanted to. Excellent flavor and tenderness, no need to sop up a bunch of thick sauce.

This recipe was just O.K. You could really taste the ketchup in this & it didn't do all that much for the recipe. I added chopped onions on top & this did add some better flavor. The chops did however turn out very tender.

Pratice up with the sauce--getting it just right for your tastes...and don't be shy about adding your favorite enhancements to it.

When you get the sauce just right, pour it on the chops or chicken and bake away!!  You'll get a five-star restaurant tasting dish every time.

My sister and I made these.  We were quite skeptical but were suprised. However we did add a few things garlic powder and a touch of merlot gave it a nice kick!  Next time I will probably add a little corn starch to make the sauce a little thicker.  Over all it was delicous!

In my opinion, these chops were fabulous!  I am not big on sweet meats, but did not find this sweet at all like some of the reviews say. I added diet coke instead of regular- maybe that was the reason. I also substituted seasoning salt for the salt and pepper and added onions on top, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe as it was. The chops were tender and delicious! Such an easy, wonderful recipe- it is definitely going in my favorites. Thanks!

This was really great, the whole family loved it.  I used a slight variation, used Root Beer instead of cola, added a little cumin, garlic and onion powder, worcetershire and drop of liquid smoke to the mixture.  This was just my variation, but it was really good.  I will cook it again, maybe this time with venison.

I used Diet Cherry Coke with this recipe and my husband and oldest son loved it! It was a little too sweet and not enough twang for my taste, I will probably use 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce next time and try a different type of soda. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Easy recipe, will do again, but I'll be more careful not to over cook the chops.  Luckily, because of the sauce they didn't dry out.  I ommited the sugar.  I thought the Coke would make it sweet enough.

Wow - have just finished the washing up from this dish (which was very easy!) and it tasted AMAZING.  My kids practically inhaled it, including Miss6 "I don't eat meat if I can see it" !! She ate a whole chop.  I added a little garlic salt in place of normal salt, and I marinated the chops in the sauce mix for about 4 hours.  Chops were juicy and tender, and a little fine semolina stirred through at the end of cooking made a thick, luscious sauce.  Thanks for this recipe - will use again!

This was pretty good.  I followed everything. Except it seemed to sweet. So i added garlic salt. Which helped alot. My husband didnt care for it to much said it was ok.  He isnt one to dwell on the taste.  The pork chops were dry though. Next time i make them will add less soda and marinade them over night.

I tried this on a whim, simply because I had the ingredients on hand.  I am not a fan of ketchup, but wow, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  My whole family loved it, even my pickiest eater. This is defienately going to be on a menu quite often

My whole family LOVED these chops, and I was surprised at how tender and flavorful they were. I adjusted the recipe to include my own rub of paprika, barbecue seasoning, garlic salt, and topped with Soy sauce to marinate for a bout 20 minutes before cooking. I also brown the chops 5 minutes per side before baking to seer in the juices. Wonderful easy meal for a family of 5!

My wife and I really liked this recipe. There was a little more "juice" than I thought there would be. However, as someone else stated, I think the next time I'll make some mashed potatoes with it. Oh, I also have never really cooked before and this was a very easy recipe for a first timer.

Very Tasty.  Some changes I made: used seasoning mix (I used Country Bob's Seasoning), add a little onion powder, floured it, fried it just to brown it. I used 3 Tbls brown sugar. Then baked as recipe called for=350 for about an hour.  Try adding a little Country Bob's All Purpose Sauce for a little more Sweet/Tangy Taste, MMmm mmmm.

As others have stated, the sauce is extremely liquidy but I didn't mind.  It was quite delicious and I added some of it to my mashed potatoes, gravy-style.

The flavor of this is ok.  I did half bbq sauce and half ketchup since many reviews complained of too much ketchup taste.  I marinaded the butterfly chops first and then baked covered for about 45 min and uncovered for 15.  The chops were very tough and dry.  Next time I will grill or maybe try baking uncovered.

I tried making it with chicken, and it turned out pretty well. I used diet coke to make it low in calories. I also liked the idea of adding onions to the dish. The onions blend well with the sauce. The con of this dish is that it doesn't look very nice. It's not something I can serve my guests. The chicken was very white, and the sauce was a lil watery. Maybe I'll add cornstarch in the end to thicken it.

This is so simple and the entire family loves it.  It's suprisingly not too sweet.  I layer a sliced onion on top of the chops before I pour the sauce over it. It's become one of my standby dinners that is no trouble after a day of work.  Mix up the sauce in a second, pour and bake.  E-Z!

Makes awesome chops. It does make a lot of sauce. I cut the recipe in half, as I was only cooking two chops, and it made quite a bit of sauce, which is good. I believe when roasting/baking chops, the more moisture you have in there the better. Sauce was not overpowering at all, adding only a subtle but tasty flavor. I placed two 1" plus sized chops in a 9" pie plate, poured the sauce over them, and just cooked them for 55 minutes. The final result: perfectly moist chops!

This recipe is very simple, and the result was just as uneventful.  It was very bland.  I used garlic salt and soy sauce to give it some life, and it still came out bland.  I didn't think it was too sweet.  I do want to try this again, but the recipe requires a lot of adjustments.

These were good, my mother used to make coke chicken when I was young so this was like that. I like the way the coke tastes all through the pork. The only problem I had was that the sauce wasnt thick enough for my taste and I over cooked the pork by a few minutes. Next time I will cook for less time. But all in all this is a good quick dinner solution!

I liked this recipe very much.  The sauce that the cola and ketchup made smelled a lot like A-1 sauce which I like a lot.  The pork chops came out tender, which is usually not an easy task when cooking pork chops, probably because I marinaded them in the sauce for about three hours before I cooked them.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I cut the sauce recipe in half for three pork chops and had plenty.  It didn't seem particularly sweet to me- I'm not sure why so many other reviewers felt it was too sweet.  I thought this was just OK, nothing too exciting, but my husband, who puts ketchup on just about everything, loved it.

This is a tempting idea for a simple quick fix meal.  This recipe, however, is just generally too sweet.  Not sweet like a fine sweet and sour pork, nor savory sweet like a good barbeque, just sweet.  Deleting the brown sugar may help, but you can't get away from the syrup content of the cola you just poured all over your main entree.  The cola solution is much lauded for helping promote tenderness and that result was observed when I experimented with this recipe.  I couldn't escape the sweetness though.  I tried adding onions to the mix and heavily seasoning the chops, but the sweetness is overwhelming.  Personally, I think one is better off hunting for a recipe with a little more complex flavors that will enhance rather than overwhelm the flavor of the meat.  There are a lot of good pork recipes out there that call for just as few and as simple ingredients as this one.  (And aren't as "sweet").

Hmmm, it't Saturday night, the pantry is kinda bare...I know, I'll got to Allrecipes.com and find something to make with the pork chops I have unthawed. And viola, I found an awesome recipe that I will certainly use over and over again. The family (hubby, and two teens) loved the flavors of the cola, brown sugar...I did add a dash of steak sauce into the mixture and it certainly made for an interesting taste. Will pass this one on to my oldest daughter, who, like me, is always looking for something new and different to make for that age old "what's for supper, Mom"!!!! Thanks, Kim for sharing and thanks allrecipes.com.....you rock!!!

The chops came out tender and I added the sliced onions on top as some people suggested but after an hour the onions were still a little undercooked.  I didn't add as much brown sugar and the recipe was still too sweet for my taste.  Thanks anyway!

I tweaked this recipe per other reviews, adding some garlic powder and dried minced onion and left out the brown sugar as I felt the other ingedients were so sweet already. I went a step further and subbed half the ketchup for an equal portion of hickory smoked bbq sauce. I probably should have left well enough alone for the first try because the predominant scent was just bbq sauce. While that's not a bad thing, I didn't get to try the sauce as Kim had posted... but there's always next time. I may also try it with the chicken as suggested.

Could anything be any easier?! This was a lot like a recipe called "chicken hurry" but we thought that it was even better.  I didn't change anything except that I sliced a bit of onion over the top of the sauce. A must try!

This recipe looked interesting.  Turned out nice and moist with lots of sauce for the rice, BUT it tasted just like ketchup!  I even added some garlic powder, seasoning salt, and chili sauce and it still TASTED LIKE KETCHUP on my meat and rice!

This dish was tasted much better than I expected. Was sweet and easy to make. My husband ate it with no complaints. I actually had all these ingredients in my house. It was a welcome change to my usual breaded and fried porkchop. Not extraordinary, but good all the same.

I made the recipe as is without altering anything and they were the juiciest pork chops I've ever made. My man couldn't believe it when I told him it was just ketchup, coke, and brown sugar. Didn't even need a knife to cut them. Excellent! This recipe is headed to my Favorites cookbook.

Tasty. I used center cut loin chops. I only had 4 so I had a bit of sauce left. They tasted more like bar-b-que than I imagined they would. But I would still make & eat them again. I probably would tweak it more...someone suggested garlic and I did add some but probably more next time.

My family laughed at this recipe before I made it - they are not laughing anymore, and all agree that these are some of the best tasting pork chops I've ever made!

This was nice and quick!  I never would have thought of using Coke to make porkchops.  It was surprisingly very good.

I made these per recipe, and they tasted ok. But next time I think I will either add more brown sugar or do the garlic and onion powder for a little more flavoring. Pork chops were nice and tender.

I made this in a pressure cooker and it turned out very moist and flavorful.  Cooked for 12 min, turn off, let pressure drop and served.  I used full can of Coke (12oz) and 12 Oz of ketchup for 4 bone in pork chops.

I followed the recipe with the exception of not adding sugar. I personally am not somebody who drinks Coke on a regular basis but I found the recipe to be extremely an overwhelmingly sweet. Mine turned out soupy which was fine because I can see if I had simmered it would’ve reduced the sauce and possibly thickened but I still didn’t care for the flavors as I mentioned.

Season, flour, brown first.  Place six 1 inch cuts into 9x13 pan. Pour the cola, ketchup, brown sugar sauce over it. Cover with foil .Cook 35 minutes at 350-375 F. Remove foil. Let rest 5 minutes. Very moist and tender. Nice flavor. I added some chili powder and salt to cut the sweetness and give it another layer of flavor. My pickiest eater liked it.

Simple and tasty. I did cook a single chop and started the timer at 30 mins. Chop was done at 20. Has a nice tang - can taste all 3 ingredients in the sauce without one overpowering the others. Quick, tasty option.

It didn't have enough flavor and it should cook at a lower temp for a longer time so the pork chops turn out tender.

Loved these chops so easy and the sauce was to die for. My kitchen was very warm so I cooked them  stove top instead of the oven.  They were just a little tuff.  Will make them in oven next time.

Tried this one today, and it was really good. Great flavor, I would however put some flour in the sauce to make it a bit thicker. I like other ideas of frying the chops before baking, may try that sometime. Chops came out really tasty.  We would definitely try this again.

I was a bit skeptical at first...but then again, I'm skeptical about most things. But I must admit, these were delicious! The sweetness & tang go together so well. This is a definite addition to our usual supper rotation!!!

Cut the chops into bite sized pieced, coated in flour & cooked in a tiny bit of coconut oil. Thought it would be too much sauce if I used it all, but I should have put it all in. Good sub for plum sauce etc. in a pinch. Kids liked it too :)

This wasnt horrible but there was too much of a ketchup taste.  I probably wouldn't make it again but if i were to I would probably do 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 sweet baby ray.

Okay, this was fabulous (& easy!!) I do want to add a few tips. While waiting for the oven to pre-heat, I let the soda-ketchup mixture sit there and it thickened fabulously. Also, I only used 4 pork chops but kept the same ingredient amount (I wanted extra sauce for rice!) Anyways, that WAS NOT a good idea. The only sauce that thickened was the sauce on top of chops... the extra sauce just laid in the pan & thinned out... It ended up looking like pork juice, ick. We fixed the problem by adding flour and it turned out to be good sauce (not at thick, but still good). Sooooo, if you half the recipe, HALF the ENTIRE recipe.

Did the suggested with a little flour and garlic salt and pan fried before going in the oven, still for the full hour. Super tender and it must have been excellent because my husband was licking his plate and I was scraping sauce from the pan. Totally a 5 star!

i always enjoy making pork chops in the crock pot, i kind of have bad luck if i cook them any other way and they always turn out dry. anyways, for the crock pot i did double the sauce and cooked overnight on low. had a lot of extra thin sauce that i could have maybe thickened up, but i wasn't crazy over it and thought the sauce was a bit on the sweeter side. very tender though and paired well with buttered rice that i added salt & pepper to. the rice balanced out the sweetness of the chops. i did not think my husband would care for them, but he enjoyed them and did not think they were that sweet. will make again, very easy to throw in the crock pot and simple, on hand ingredients

It might have been the quality of the meat since we live overseas... but this was slightly sub-average and not worth making again.  Definatly edible, but nothing to look forward to.

I do not like pork chops sam! I do not like them sam I am...uhh wait I do like pork chops when made this way...yum yum yum.  Can't believe people are saying this is too sweet what did you think with ketchup as one of the main ingredients?? I've mixed this up with BBQ sauce, worcestchire (sp?), mustard.  Always stayed with the Coca Cola never tried any of the other colas, any which way i've made it i've enjoyed it.

I enjoyed these. I did use half a cup of ketchup and half a cup of bbq sauce. I didn't have a coke so I used coke zero and it worked just fine. I did flour and brown my chops. I used boneless chops cause that was all I had at the house. I sliced some onions and put them on top of the chops with the sauce. Yummy! Will make again!

I've cooked this dish several times over the past few years. I like to add a tbsp or so of soy sauce and a healthy dash of sriracha.  Be sure to cook it uncovered for best results.  If not, the sauce comes out a little thin.

Wow I was surprised how good this recipe turned out, it was very tasty and super easy to make on a week night.  There was plenty of gravy left over to put over stemmed rice, will definitely make this one again.

All I can say is YUMMY!!!!  It was a hit and will definitely be making again.  I did roll the chops in flour with salt pepper and garlic powder and brown first.  Plus mixed ketchup and our favourite bbq sauce, that had been suggested. Thanks for sharing.

It was good, more of an Island type flavor than I imagined.  A few changes were made:  I used A&W Root Beer since we didn't have any Coke at the time.  I lessened the ketchup like many suggested.  I added dehydrated onion, garlic powder and a general seasoning with a little hot pepper.  I had boneless thin pork chops and they only needed to cook at the recommended temperature for about 35-40 minutes.  Overall it was really yummy.  My uber-picky 2 year old even ate some.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  Do not be scared off by the weird ingredients!  I took others advice and rubbed the chops in onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper and then browned on the stove.  I also added 1 tsp of corn starch to the sauce and cooked for only 40 minutes.  It was so moist!!  My biggest suggestion is doubling the sauce!  I used only 3 pork chops instead of the 8 it called for, but still used the amount of sauce used for 8...it was the perfect amount.  I like serving this with rice or mashed potatoes and having enough sauce to pour over it.  I'll be making this again!

Nothing special.  I did the 1/2 and 1/2 with BBq sauce and ketchup and omitted the sugar as BBQ sauce and ketchup are full of sugar as is the cola that goes into it.  Probably wouldn't make this again.

This was really good!  I did dip the pork chops in flour and brown them before I put it in the oven.  I also was out of regular cola and end up using cherry coke flavor.  I don't know if that made much of a deference but my picky family ate it all up.

A very good recipe!  It made me smile because way-back-when, my Mom used to bake pork cutlets with a mixture of 1 cup 7-up and 1 cup ketchup!  Can't go wrong with either!

Made the recipe as directed and it was not that great. The sauce was very thin. I expected it to be thicker like a gravy. Plus, the ingredients didnt give the pork chops much flavor. Dont know if I will try it again or not.

I liked this because the sauce wasn't really one like I've tasted before sort of reminded me of A-1 steak sauce is all I can see but me & my boyfriend liked it and were going to use it time & time again.

I read this recipe, and I thought, "That doesn't sound very good" so I read the reviews, and they were all positive. I had the ingredients on hand, so I thought, "It won't hurt to try." Boy, am I glad I did. This is really tasty! I did not modify it at all!

these pork chops were sooooo good! I followed the directions word for word and got some pork chop majic! they were not overly sweet and the meat feel off the bone.  usually pork chop recipes i try have a rather texture.. but this was not the case here. i'm telling you - try these pork chops and they will become a family faovorite. my hats off to the person who invented this recipe!

I was looking for something new and easy for pork chops and this was IT. It was easy, quick and delicious!!! I added some chopped green peppers to the sauce. I also dredge pork chops in flour, garlic, salt and pepper then browned in frying pan before baking in over. I served with white rice and chopped spinach. Delicious!!!! I will make it again and recommend it to friends and family.

I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic salt on each side before rolling in flour and browning. Then I followed the recipe. I found it only needed about 25 minutes at 375 degrees. Delicious!

I made these for dinner last night and must say that they were really good. A little too sweet but overall good flavor. Even my picky brothers ate them and than was lookin for seconds. Thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful, my whole family loved it. Served with fresh green beans and garlic mashers. I did 1/4c ketchup and a 1/4c bbq sauce and it turned out great. Will be making this one again.

This is an excellent but easy recipe.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I did coat the pork chops in flour and garlic pepper and brown in olive oil before adding sauce and baking.  The coating ended up being a little soggy so I'm not sure this is necessary but it was delicious!  Next time I will add onions.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans, the family loved it.  This would probably be really good on a pork loin and also with chicken.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great - my entire family loved it, even the baby!  I didn't have cola, so I substituted apple raspberry juice, which turned out quite well.  Also, I followed other suggestions and lightly coated the chops with a gluten-free coating mix (flour) and then sauteed them in olive oil with onions and garlic before baking them in my stoneware deep covered baker.  I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce, no brown sugar since there was already sugar in the juice.  Served with steamed broccoli, sweet potato fries and brown rice - yum!

I tried the option of battering and lightly frying and then baking in the Cola & ketchup mixture- no, no, not preferable. My husband was very disappointed, he absolutely hated it. The outside was soggy and my husband said it tasted like "cheap barbecue sauce". I say save the Cola for drinking, not for these poor defenseless pork chops.

I made this last night for supper and it was delicious!  I used country-style pork ribs and sprinkled them with salt & pepper and a little cayenne pepper.  I think next time I'll add a little onion and perhaps green pepper.  I cooked them in a roaster with a lid and I thickened the sauce with a slurry of flour and water.  All in all, we loved this served over rice.  Yummy, yum, yum!!

I thought the sauce was tasty.  Nothing fancy, but these were put together quickly and were good.  I sprinkled with salt, pepper and flour and browned for a bit first before I put them in the oven, but I don't think that was necessary.

The chops turned out really well and reminded me of the bbq pork chops my mother always made. She had her own homemade sauce that is very similar to this. I am going to try chili sauce the next time instead of the ketchup since that is what she used. Leftovers made a great pork chop sandwich.

Yummy!  I dipped them in a flour/onion salt/garlic powder mixture and fried them lightly before putting them in the dish for the oven.  Also used 1/2 ketchup, and 1/2 BBQ and diet coke for the topping.  Left out the brown sugar, since the BBQ and coke are already sweet, I didn't think it was necessary.  I only baked them for 45 minutes since they were already partially cooked from the frying.  Came out delicious!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thanks!

Giving this a four even though we overcooked ours and it was a bit dry.  The sauce was really tasty. I took the other reviewers' advice and halved the ketchup with barbecue sauce and tossed in a bit of garlic powder. Nice. Will probably try this again.

These were easy to make but the taste was bland at best. I wanted a recipe that didn't require frying the chops ( trying to cut down on fat) so I didn't take the suggestions of browing them. I did add a little tabasco. The sauce was runny. I added some cornstarch to thicken it. I found them edible with lots of pepper on them. This recipe would be good for a very new cook to try. While it's not great it certainly is easy.

Very good recipe that is easy and I normally have all of the ingredients on hand.  The made a few minor changes: I sprinkled each pork chop with salt, pepper, and onion powder before pouring the cola glaze over them.  And I added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic to the cola, ketchup, and brown sugar.  The pork chops were tasty and, juicy, and not tough at all.  And even my two kids liked it!  Highly recommend for a quick, simple weeknight meal.

This is a pretty good recipe and super easy too.  We don't really care for pork chops, but really liked this.  It was juicy and sweet and my son liked it too.

you can also do this on the stove top, using a covered pan on slow heat, or even in a crock pot. Very tender! If you're in a hurry you can just use a bottle of bar-b-q sauce and the cola. Very tender!!

I did not like the taste.  I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, as others recommended.  I might try again with ketchup.

I dusted the chops w/ flour, garlic salt & pepper and pan fried them for a few minutes. Overall I was not impressed w/ the flavor. Even w/ the flour dusting I found the flavor to be very bland. :-(

I tried this the other day and LOVED it.  I seasoned it a little with some cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder and browned it with some flour before putting into the oven.  The sauce was thick and the pork chops was incredibly moist. This was also incredibly easy to make as well, which made it even better!

These turned out great and were so easy!  I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and seasoned the pork, coated it in flour and browned it before coating in the sauce and putting in the oven.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a generous amount of sauce for 8 chops.  I plan next time to split the sauce, freeze & save for another time.  The smell coming from my oven is divine!

Best Easy Pork Chops Ever! I did salt/pepper, dreged in flour and browned in frying pan. Added minced dried onions to the sauce and baked as directed. Taste is so much better than expected. Will make again and again!

Great recipe. The second time I made it I used sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and put a little onion slice on top of each chop. My family loved it !

This was not for us. I marinated the pork chops and then skillet fried them as did some other reviews. I added seasoning to my flour. The sauce was not good at all. We will not be making this again.

Quick, easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe, seasoned pork chops with salt and pepper and let sit for a few hours, then seared them on both sides, and used ginger ale instead of cola because that's what I had open. My husband and 3 sons loved it. I served it over rice with fresh string beans on the side. No left overs.

We don't eat pork chops often.This recipe was a hit, even for my very picky 7 year old.Simple,easy and quick. I did sear the chops lightly coated with flour before baking. I will use this recipe again.

I make this all the time now. I use a teaspoon of lemon juice & a teaspoon of cornstarch in my sauce to thicken it up a little. I prefer to use boneless pork ribs and serve it over white rice with the sauce. Yummmm! It's so easy and taste so good. Deffinately a keeper!

The sauce was pretty flavorful, although I might have preferred it a little thicker.  The pork didn't come out incredibly tender, but I think it may have been the meat itself.  I will try the recipe again with fresher pork chops.

Like others, I was skeptical when I read the ingredients.  But it is just fabulous.  Much lighter, and a lot less boring, than plain old BBQ sauce.  My kids, especially my toddlers, love it.  I did double the sauce though.

The flavor of the sauce is very family-friendly...however, I think if the sauce were thicker, it would be more desireable.  Perhaps some cornstarch could be added prior to pouring over the chops.  Great flavor.

I'm a novice cook and I fixed this tonight for my housemates (one of whom is as good a cook as any chef) They loved it and it was sooo easy! I made similar substitutions, 1/2 ketchup 1/2 -an Onion/Pepper BBQ sauce, some lime juice,worsteshire sauce (sp?) and Tobasco sauce. I didn't flour the chops, but I did brown them in olive oil and added onions and a lil corn starch to thicken up the sauce. Served with brown rice.. yum! Thanks for the recipe!

I seasoned these chops with a seasoning salt for more flavor and it worked out amazing. The chops turn out moist and delicious and you would never guess there was cola in this. Will be making this again.

Using cola in the recipe made for a conversation starter at dinner and the flavour was nice but it was nothing special. You could taste the cola faintly and it was not overpowering. They weren't dry but they did lack curb appeal.

We really liked this recipe.  My pork came out very tender and juicy, the sauce was delicious. I followed other's suggestions and dredged the pork in flour and very quickly browned them.  I put sliced onions on top of the chops then topped them w/ the sauce (I made the sauce exactly the way it was written). I only cooked them for 30 min.  I would make this recipe again.  I served this w/ buttered rice and green beans.  Very good.

Great Recipe!  I did coat the chops w/ flour & pepper and browned them as suggested by many.  I also chopped an onion and some garlic for the sauce.  It made it sweet yet savory.  Fabulous served with mashed potaooes!

If you like your pork chops sweet, this is the recipe for you.  The sauce is sweet with just a hint of savory.  For thin pork chops, be sure to cut down the cooking time.  We used 1/4-3/8 inch chops and cooked it 45 minutes, but they may have been done in around 30-35 minutes.

This recipe rocks!!!  Like others recommended, I too rolled my chops in a mixture of flour with a little bit of black pepper and seasoned salt and browned them briefly on a grill pan. Very easy, very tasty!! I also doubled the sauce to serve over mashed potatoes. It was quite a bit of sauce so if you're doing a different kind of potato, it's probably not necessary to double the sauce. Definitely a keeper!

My fiance thought this was ok, but our other roommate and I loved it.  I seasoned the chops with flour and a small amount of red pepper and then pan seared them, as suggested by others.  Cut cooking time to about 40 min.  Delicious.  And great left over.

This recipe was okay. If you're not into sweet meat, you won't like it. The cola mixture makes a VERY sweet sauce. I liked it but my husband didn't think it was great.

I used chicken because I always have chicken on hand and it was wonderful! Wow, so easy!. The sauce was a little thin so I had to take the chicken out every now and then to resauce it. I also doubled the sauce because it never seemed to be enough. Love it and already have made it twice!!!

Absolutely marveous! I saw some reviews saying the sauce was too runny, but mine on the contrary, hardened and stuck to the tray - but the part of it that could be spooned over the chops was out of this world! Sweet indeed, but then again if you don't want sweet you wouldn't pick this recipe :) The meat was not dry, and the sauce did not taste like ketchup. We all loved it.

This was very good. Even my little boys who claim they dont like "chicken" (any meat) ate it right up!  Like the other reviewers, I did half ketchup, half BBQ sauce and browned the chops a little first. Will make this one again.

Great recipe, in my opinion.  Easy to cook. the sauce was excellent over rice.  I did change it, though, to the dredged in flour and 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 BBQ sauce.  It was, however, quite delicious and something i will make again.

I have to give this 5 stars because the whole family loves it.  Pleasing everyone (meaning mostly the kids) is no small feat.  :P  I normally half the recipe because I buy 4 boneless pork chops.

This was not a bad recipe for porkchops.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used half bbq sauce/half catsup but I think the bbq sauce overpowered the cola.  Next time I will just follow the recipe the way it is written.  Also I had thick porkchops that I had to slice down the middle to make them thin, so cook time was only a half hour. If you do this I would suggest using a bit more catsup and cola so that they don't come dry (mine were a bit).

I made this recipe and i thought it was delicious! I would reccomend it to everyone. The pork chops were very juicy and flavorful. I tryed a few different things like pan frying them before i baked, using bbq sauce, and additional spices. I will make this recipe very often.

I accidently over cooked the pork, however the flavor was still good. I am always looking for different ingredients to prepare food with and would have to say this is a winner!

I loved this dish. I took previous suggestions and seasoned the chops with garlic and onion powder,lightly breaded the chops and browned before placing in the oven, and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce. They were delicious and the flour made the sauce a perfect consistancy. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was good, but not great.  The sauce was great on the chops, but not so great over rice.  My kids loved it, though.

If I were making this for a large group this recipe is a crowd pleaser. On a personal note, it just seems to be missing something little to make it POP.  I rolled the chops in flour, seasoned with garlic and spices like others had suggested.  Next time, I plan to substitute the ketchup with bbq sauce and add some heat.

This tasted like pork chops in BBQ sauce.  I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce so it was a miss for me.  The rest of my family enjoyed them and they couldn't have been easier to prepare.

I got this recipe from my sister a long time ago and I stuck it on the fridge. I wanted to try something different one day and I tried it. It is out of this world!I added some garlic and floured and browned the chops first. It doesn't get much easier than this!

ok so why has it taken me this long to find this recipe!!!  LOVED IT!  So easy and very convenient!  Added minced garlic to the cola sauce...along with salt and pepper. Didn't add bbq sauce...but I think next time I will!  Definitely brown the chops before you bake them!  D-LISH!

I will make this again definately.  I seasoned my pork chops with salt pepper and garlic salt, rolled in flour, and browned both sides of the pork chops (as recommended by another reviewer) before baking.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and yuuuummmmm.  Delicious.

This meal was great. I went ahead and did half ketchup, half bbq sauce. I also pan seared the pork and then cooked half an onion in the drippings and added the sauce to that before covering the pork. It was awesome...my boyfriend loved it too!

My family was really pleased with this quick and easy recipe.  I floured the chops first as well with a mixture of flour, seasoned salt, garlic & onion powder, and black pepper; I also heated the sauce in the pan I browned the chops in before I poured it over.  That way I got all the browned bits from the pan - very good! Will make again!

I have to say, these did not really have much taste at all!  I did not pour sauce over the pork chops after they cooked.  Maybe that was the problem???  I had assumed cooking in the sauce would hold SOME of the flavor.  NOPE!  Even just salt and pepper alone make better pork chops than these.  I did use salt and pepper, but the sauce seemed to wash it off.  Oh well!  We will not make these again.

Definitley lacks something, even though I used garlic and onion. Tastes more or less like a sweet bbq sauce. Easy, but I won't make this again.  Wasn't at all satisfying.

Very good, I love the sauce. It was very tasty, my guy loved it. I did marinate my chops for 8 hrs as well, and cooked them in a pan for about 5 mins on each side, than put them in the oven as directed. Perfect texture!

I would have given 3 stars, but that wouldn't be fair since I didn't use coke.  I used Mountain Dew thinking the lemony taste might be good.  They were just ok.  Coke would be better.  Tender though.  Served with rice and tomato,cuke salad.
Easy which is important.

Not that good.  Very bland and I even added garlic. Chops were juicy, just no flavor. We ended up eating them with barbaque sauce.

This turned out very yummy! I did do a few things differently though...I used mostly tomato sauce with some ketchup, added lots of garlic and minced onion. I did make one BIG substitution...it turns out that the Coke I had bought specifically for this recipe had been guzzled by my husband! So, I used some rootbeer instead. :) And it was actually pretty good! I think it would've been better with the Coke, but hey! It worked.

This recipe was awesome.  My family normally does not like pork chops but these were a hit.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and floured and pan fried the chicken before pouring mixture over and I also cooked it covered for the first 30 mins or so.  I will be trying this with chicken tonight.

I used chicken strips instead of pork chops. This was a big hit at my house.

quick, easy recipe. I used bbq sauce since I didn't have any soda in the house. I made extra sauce to coat both sides of the chops before baking. Good flavor. will make again.

This dish is delicious!  The sauce reminded me of a honey/barbeque based one.  I sliced a white onion and put the pieces on top of each chop before baking.  The flavor was so good!  My husband wants me to try this sauce with boneless chicken breasts or boneless spareribs.  No reason to go out in the cold to grill..have an indoor barbeque!!

This recipe was okay. I followed other reviews, put half ketchup and half barbecue sauce, omitted the brown sugar (hubby won't eat sweet meats) and sliced thin onions on top of the chops. I put garlic powder, salt & pepper as well. My chops seemed to be falling apart before I started cooking them though. They are the small round 1-2" thick ones. It smelled good, cooked in only 30-40 minutes, although the onions were slightly crunchy. But the chops were not super juicy, were a tad dry and they were somewhat tough. We get our meat delivered so I don't think it was b/c the meat was cheap. The sauce was super thick for me, almost too thick. I was careful not to overfill though, so for me I used actually a little less than a cup for both the ketchup/barbecue sauce and the cola. I won't make this again, just didn't turn out to be a very good dish.

We loved these pork chops, including my kids.  I didn't use the onions that are pictured. It was wonderful over rice.  I followed another reviewer who floured and browned the chops first.  I think this would make a great slow cooker sauce (doubled) to cook meat; look forward to using it in the slow cooker.

I just made these porkchops tonight for dinner and they were tasty, but a little dry.  I cooked them as directed, so not sure, maybe it was a bad cut of pork chop, but I would try to make them again to see if it was indeed the meat that was tough.  It was SO easy to make, thats definitely a bonus to this recipe.  It probably took me all of 3 minutes to get these from the fridge to the oven.

My husband didn't like the idea of these pork chops at first, but when they were done he just raved about them.  I took the advice of another reviewer and omited the brown sugar and mixed 1/2 cup of ketchup with 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce.

I tried this tonight.  It was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than downsizing it for less chops.  I will make again, but next time I'll use some of the adjustments some others have suggested.  My sauce was very watery, almost seems to have separated while baking.  I'll try using less soda (I used Pepsi this time) and also try the half BBQ sauce half ketchup modification.  It was a tiny bit ketchup-y so that should help.  Pretty good for 3 ingredients and 5 minutes to prepare!

The meat was super tender, but next time I will thicken the sauce and add a few other herbs and spices.  Will also marinate the meat overnight w/ the cola & a capful of crown/southern comfort.  My son loved it.

Very good and VERY EASY.  The kids ate it up and my husband liked it even though he was skeptical.  Don't be scared of the cola.  The meat was tender and I didn't change a thing (aside from cutting the recipe in half).

I just made this last night. I had semi-bone 2 inch pork chops, and decided to make this recipe. I chopped to relatively medium sized onions (next time I will only do one). I used salt, pepper and garlic powder and fried them in a cast iron frypan for a few minutes on each side. I also added to the sauce, worstishire (sp) sauce, and yellow mustard. Put the onions on top and poured the sauce over everything. I left the pork chops in the cast iron frypan and cooked them at 350 for about 35 minutes (temp 160). They were wonderful. Never saw my husband pick up the bone before and eat every piece of meat off the bone. Oh and also, I added corn starch to the sauce to make it thicker.
Quite yummy. I think I would like to try the more simpler version just for myself. Husband likes things kicked up a notch or two.

Hit with the family.  I love it when I find something everyone likes.  I did add a little garlic powder and onion powder to the chops as I read in several of the reviews.  I haven't tried it with chicken yet but I will.

this was a quick and easy way to make porkchops with ingredients that are laying around the home and when you don't want to put much thought into how to prepare your pork chops.  i am giving it three stars because my husband liked it...  i am pretty sure that there are better ways to cook porkchops.

YUMMY! I only made 1/2 recipe b/c we are a small family and it was great!I took the advice of others and added a bit of BBQ sauce and some onion powder to balance out the sweetness. Easy, simple, and we all loved it! Thanks!

As a newly married woman (who doesn't cook much--and married my High School Home Ec teachers son :-)I made this last night and it was wonderful. My very picky husband really liked it too! The flavor was great. I did add some fresh garlic to the mix and sprinkled a bit of onion soup mix on the top before baking. We will eat this again! Thanks!

not sure why people are saying it sauce was thin.  mine never is. maybe it depends on the brand of cola you use? i use PEPSI and my family loves it!!  my sister even used it for meatballs.

I thought my husband would be a little weirded out by the idea of putting cola in, so I didnt tell him at first. When he tried it, he loved it! I finally told him about adding cola, and he was shocked! I thought that telling him might change his mind, however he raved about it still!! In fact, when his company potluck came up, I ended up making it for 30 hungry men!! I am vegetarian myself, but I think it even smells good!! GREAT RECIPE and thank you so much for sharing it!!

This is really good.  I suggest adding a bit of hot sauce to the procedings.  My girlfriend and I made corn bread muffins which were perfect for sopping up the extra sauce.  Anyone who says this is bland isn't doing it right.  Garlic salt or Mortons natures seasoning will spice it up enough.

These were good, but not fantastic.  I think I cooked mine a bit too long, so they weren't as juicy as they could have been.  I will probably make these again though because they are easy.

The chops were tender and moist. I added chopped onions and fresh mushrooms on top of the chops and also marinated it for one hour before baking. This recipe will be used again.

This was really good. I also browned the pork chops before I baked them. Added the brn sugar and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.Wasn't really sure how good they'd taste with the ketchup but turned out great. This is a keeper.Thanks!

Hubby thought it was ok, did say he would have it again.  I gave it 4 stars because it wasnt something he loved, he just liked it. Very simple recipe, will definately make again.  I did cut down on the ketchup and cola a tad bit and added 1 tsp of cornstarch.  The sauce was still thin though. thanks for sharing the recipe.

I read the reviews before making this dish and I thought I could make it in a way where there wouldn't be tons of liquid on top. I was wrong. There was still tons of liquids and the flavor didn't permeate. I poked holes in the pork chop but it didn't help. It was tender but rather flavorless. The only good part was that a small amount on the top caramelized and had a nice flavor. I might try boiling it down and thickening it some.

We liked the taste of this recipe alot. The mixture didn't penetrate the meat it stayed on top more like a glaze. Maybe I should have coated both sides. I cooked these at 385F for 35 minutes. The hour cook time seemed to long.

The pork chops came out somewhat tender, but the sauce didn't seem to marinade. The sauce was runny.  We ate it, but I won't be cooking this again.

Hmmm.   Not sure what I did wrong, but I'm still giving it 5 stars because of the taste!  The chops were *very* tough and were floating in the liquid when I removed them from the oven after 50 minutes.   Now I did use white sugar as I had no brown, and I substituted Chili Sauce instead of Ketchup.  Maybe this made a difference in thickening the sauce.  So I just threw the juice in a saucepan and thickened it up with corn starch.  Maybe next time I will put in the slow cooker to get the chops tender.   Or use a tenderloin... I don't know yet, but will definitely try again!

I made this dish the other night when I had pork chops on hand and nothing else to do with them.  They turned out great and were very easy and inexpensive to make.  No leftovers for us!  Will definitely make this one again and again, although I may add a little hot sauce or something to give it a little more zing.

I didn't follow directions.  Marinated thick loin chops 'all day,' then grilled 10 minutes on each side.  Sauce caramalized, chops were very tender & juicy.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks.

Easy but not fabulous. 
I was very excited about this recipe.  When my husband brought home some juicy porkchops I decided to make this.  I added the worchestire sauce in the recipe as well.   I probably won't make this again unless I'm all out of ideas.

I really didn't find this tasty at all.  Sorry.  One thing is that it was very easy.  If you tend to like less spicy kind of foods, you may like it.

This was REALLY good. My kids thought I had lost my mind after combining ketchup, brown sugar and half a can of Coke, but everyone loved it. It made the boneless pork chops very moist and juicy.

I loved this recipe. My kids are so picky and I could never get them to eat pork chops, but they loved these. I used dr. pepper instead of cola though and they were still yummy!!

It was easy and the kids ate it, but it's not a better alternative to cream of mushroom with pork chops, which is what I'm looking for.

This was very good.  The chops had a sweet flavor and were very moist.  It made a lot of sauce, so you can probaby cut down some of the ingredients.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I used honey instead of the brown sugar, and added garlic as others suggested.  Turned out great,  I didn't cook them as long as suggested cause the chops weren't as thick.  Will make this one again.  The next time I will cut the sauce recipe in half,  it made way to much.

I added a little bit of garlic and minced onions and the sauce turned out great--it was sweet but not too sweet.  Also, I would use chicken or short ribs instead of pork chops.  Check out "A Good Barbeque Sauce" for a similar recipe if you like things a little hotter.  I will definitely make this again.  It tastes just like the sauce I usually make but takes less time and uses less ingredients.  Thanks, Kim!

I sprinkled the chops with pepper and garlic salt before baking. I only cooked two pork chops but I used the whole sauce recipe and it was way too much! If I make this again I will make less sauce, use less sugar and maybe mix some spicey brown mustard in for more flavor.

I gave this recipe four stars for the simplicity of it , not a lot of ingredients , pretty good taste... however, i seem to have trouble with pork chops being tough and dry..so basically it is a good recipe for moms on the go! If only i could solve the mystery of cooking chops without overcooking them!

I don't want to blame it on the recipe however the pork chops I used were dry.  Very sweat.  there wasn't enough sauce to pour over rice. 
Don't think I would make it again.

I think this is an excellent sauce. Next time I'll use it for a bbq sauce for chicken or pork chops. I think that will be better than baking. :} 
I will use it again though!!!!

Very easy recipe. The family loved it but it was a little too sweet for me. But everyone else loved it.

I make this recipe by substituting salsa for the ketchup and diet coke for the coke and I don't use any brown sugar. These changes make it really tangy and healthy. Be sure to use a lower hotness than you normally would with salsa.

These were, by far, the worst pork chops I have ever eaten.  They were dry and tasteless.  I will definitely never make these again

Not impressed.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about a 3.  Edible, but that's it.  Wouldn't make it again, or recommend the recipe.

My husband loved these pork chops.  I thought they were a little too dry so I think next time I will bake covered.  The sauce was excellent.  I served it with white rice and green beans.  I made extra sauce to spoon over the rice and I was glad I did.  My 4 year old nephew was over and he didn't like it, but then again he doesn't like anything but peanut butter and jelly.  I will definitely make this again.

This was surprisingly tasty.  And I do believe this is probably the easiest thing I have every cooked.  My chops came out a little dry - I'd reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes and then check to see if done.  I was also thinking that adding a dollop of sour cream might make it even better.

This dish had a pretty good flavor. It was a good change from the usual grilled bbq pork chops. The ketchup kind of dominated the taste. Maybe a little more of the spices or adding some different spices would improve it.  Couldn't be any easier to fix. I would definitely fix/eat it again.

My husband and I thought this recipe was great.
I would have never thought about cooking with a 
coca-cola.
