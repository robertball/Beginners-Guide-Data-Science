I made 2 batches of this exactly as written, one cinnamon and the other pumpkin spice swirl bread.  3 out of 4 people likes it and all had complaints of it being a bit soggy. If I make this again, I will experiment with the cooking method.

It was good.  I used some apple cinnamon bread we had been given for Christmas that I had frozen and it turned out well.  I will use it again.

Absolutely delicious and just sweet enough without any syrups or jellies on it.
