I made this cake as a birthday cake for my mother. Her favorite ice cream flavor is Black Rap\spberry and her favorite cookie is an Oreo. I used a 10-inch springform pan to make this recipe. This is how I adjusted the recipe:

1 (1lb 4 oz.)pkg. oreo cookies
6 tbsp. butter
2 pints Edy's Dreamery ice cream (black raspberry avalanche)
1 qt. edy's vanilla bean ice cream
1/2 cup hot fudge

I used 30 crushed Oreos and the butter to press into the bottom of the pan and froze it for 10 minutes. I then spread room temp. hot fugde over the bottom and lined up whole oreos around the edge of the pan. I froze 15 minutes and then spread the Dreamery icecream into the pan over the crust. I froze 30 minutes. I then added a layer of the vanilla and smoothed the top. I had 3 remaining Oreos and so I crushed them very finely and spread them over the top of the cake. I think added hot fudge and cherries and whip cream would have made the cake way too sweet. It was just perfect like this.

This is a very flexible recipe and I will use it again with ingredients tailored for the recipient! I will probably make it for my husband's birthday in March with Pecan Sandies, caramel sauce and Butter Pecan ice cream.

Great, simple recipe! I did two layers of ice cream instead of scoops and then put a layer of whipped cream on top (Cool Whip tasted great!). I also put a layer of some remaining cookie crumbs and other full 11.5 oz bottle of fudge between the two ice cream layers. Just a suggestion...nuke the fudge. That way you can just pour it on instead of spread, which tends to bring the cookie crumbs up. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday, and he said it was the best ice cream he's ever had. It's so easy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband's birthday lastnight. I have 7 kids and they said it was the best ice cream cake ever!! I used a deep dish glass pie plate. I used vanilla ice cream and regular sized chips a hoy cookies. I didn't make the last addition of ice cream into balls, I just did it like the first one--smooth.This is a recipe you can really be creative with.--by changing the type of cookie, adding Twix,recees etc around the side, sprinkiing m&m's on top....changing the flavor of ice cream etc. when we have company over, I thought I'd double the recipe and make it in a longer pan etc. You can't really go wrong with this recipe. I kept it covered while it was freezing to avoid the ice cream tasting like the freezer.

Thank you Arvilla for such a wonderful recipe!  I made this for my son's 18th birthday and it turned out better than anything you would get in a five star restaurant!!!  I used Oreo cookies (my son's favorite) instead of chocolate chip, and I used cookies-n-cream ice cream for the bottom layer, and Häagen-Dazs vanilla for the little scoops on the top!  I re-froze the cake after each layer, and softened the ice cream for the scoops.  For the middle layer, I used more hot fudge mixed with crushed Oreo cookies, and then a thin layer of Cool Whip, then topped it with little mini scoops of Häagen-Dazs vanilla and decorated with mini Oreo cookies!  It literately turned out picture perfect!

Impressive presentation for my son's l6th birthday!  I used a deep dish pie pan and would
suggest spraying it with Pam.  Pouring hot margarine over crushed Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies made a wonderful chocolate crust, but it took more than 20 small cookies to soak up the margarine.  I softened both the caramel and hot fudge for a minute in the microwave and used coffee and cookie dough ice creams with the caramel between; freezing between layers.  For the top layer, I used a melon ball scoop and covered the whole pie with little cookie dough balls, then a pastry tube filled with Cool Whip piped over the entire top.  Used softened hot fudge to write "Happy Birthday" over the Cool Whip, then lined up maraschino cherries with stems around the edge. It was an awesome "birthday cake".

The only problem I had with this is that the bottom layer stuck to the pan... I think because the fudge layer did not "lay on top of" the cookie layer.  It got mixed in.  I think this could have been avoided with an added freezing period before putting on the fudge layer.  Eveyone loved the taste and presentation of the cake however, and I would definitely try it again!

This is such a great recipe!  After reading other's reviews, I knew exactly how to customize this cake for my son's 12th b-day. For the crust; I crushed a 12oz pkg of chocolate covered mint square cookies, I used another pkg to ring the cake sides then into freezer for 20 min.  I smoothed in creamy soft mint ice cream creating a 1/2" layer, then froze for 30 minutes.  I crushed a pkg of Pepperidge mint sevilles and pressed onto the ice cream layer, then into the freezer for 15 min.  For the the topping: I spread 3/4 of a 16oz container of thawed cool whip then drizzled chocolate syrup over the top.  I pulled a toothpick through the syrup to create a heart design. Finally, I sprinkled chocolate mint sprinkles over the top, wrapped with foil and froze. until the next day.  I precut slices hour's before serving at my son's b-day bbq.  Using a springform pan gave such a beautiful presentation---this is easy to do and everyone will love it!

This was really fun to make and cost a lot less than a store bought ice cream cake. I substituted a brownie crust instead of crushed cookies. I used a boxed brownie mix for a 13x9 pan and baked part of it in the springform pan and part in a bundt cake pan. After the brownie had cooled, I spread the jar of fudge on the springform brownie and cut up the bundt brownie into pretty wedges and formed the "edge" of the cake with them by placing them into the fudge and froze the cake overnight. The next day in the morning I filled half of the cake with Coffee Heath Bar ice cream and half cookies and cream, putting the pretty full scoops of ice cream on top and froze it again until my daughter's party. the cake was a huge success and everyone wants me to make it again!

A+++ recipe.  I used chocolate creme filled Oreos and bought Dairy Queen soft serve for the 2 quarts of ice cream.  I family declared the cake was better than Dairy Queen's....not to mention about $10 cheaper!!!

Very easy to prepare ahead of time when company is coming.  A great treat for those of us on diets!!!  NOT!!! LOL! I used Hershey chocolate syrup and I soften all the ice cream and spread it out smooth.  When serving - I drizzled more chocolate sauce over the top of each slice. mmm...

This dessert was awesome!!  I substituted Oreos (about 30) for the crust, and then the ice creams of my choice.  HaagenDaaz chocolate on bottom, chocolate sauce, and then Caramel de Leche on top!!!!!  I  served this to my inlaws and my husband had 4 pieces on one day! When placing your cookies around the side, make sure to follow directions and place BEFORE freezing the bottom layer.  I misread the directions the first time and couldn't get them to stand up! Also, a good tip-- place them with a small space between each cookie so you'll be all set when you go to cut them into slices.  Delicious, and I can't wait to experiment with different flavors!

Very good! I'd recommend a cookie layer between the two kids of ice cream with a layer of hot fudge because we like that cookie crunch in our house. I didn't bother with scoops on top, I just smoothed it out.  VERY good. Didn't last long!  :)

Delicious!  I had fun going crazy with this recipe for my sister-in-law's birthday.  In a 9 X 13 casserole dish I covered the bottom and sides with whole chocolate chip cookies (the chunky Chips Ahoy Ones).  Then I put on my first layer of ice cream - Chocolate fudge brownie.  I used the slow churned because it spread easier.  I froze it for 30 min. then spread chocolate topping all over it.  Froze for 15 min. then added layer of vanilla ice cream.  Froze 30 min.  Added tub of Cool Whip and sprinkled with mini chocolate chips and wrote "Happy Birthday" with chocolate syrup.  Froze overnight before the party.  My chocolate syrup writing didn't exactly stay where it was supposed to, but the cake TASTED absolutely delicious!  I had made it larger so their would be enough for the 14 people that were there.  Well, there was only one small piece left!  Everyone loved it and few people had seconds.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!

We used this recipe to made a wonderful ice cream cake for our Mother's birthday.  It was a big hit...everyone agreed it was far superior to the expensive ice cream cake we purchased as a treat several years ago!  Instead of chocolate chip cookies we used Amaretto cookies for a crust in a 9"-spring mold pan.  We did not put cookies on the sides.  For ice cream, after freezing the crust, we did a layer of chocolate brownie fudge and spread a layer of chocolate fondue sauce (leftover) on top of that. After freezing that, we then added a layer of old fashioned vanilla ice cream flavored with Amaretto and almond extract.  We topped it with scoops of straight old fashioned vanilla. After the assembled cake was frozen solid (overnight) we transferred it to a chilled cake plate, drizzled more of the chocolate fondue sauce over the top and then finished the edge along the plate with Cool Whip (we were afraid whipped cream wouldn't hold up when frozen.)  As much as I loved the flavor of the chocolate fondue sauce, it seemed chewy in the cake...I didn't mind the brownie chunks in the ice cream, so maybe if instead of spreading the sauce into a solid sheet between the ice cream layers, I drizzle it instead, it would be OK.  The drizzle on the cake top was perfect.  Delicious, gorgeous, cake!

The greatness of this recipe is how truly adaptable it is.  I'm not sure you could say I even followed this recipe by the time I was done adding and tweaking.  However, it was a bit hit, so here are my changes.  I used crushed oreos with margarine as the bottom crust.  I then spread melted fudge and put chocolate ice cream over that.  My next layer (after freezing) was a bottle of that magic shell chocolate.  It gave such a nice crunch!  Before the magic shell could freeze I put more crumbled oreos on top.  After freezing that layer, I topped off with a layer of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  The different oreo layers with extra fudge made it very similar to Dairy Queen ice cream cakes.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday because he requested ice cream cake for his party.  I didn't want to buy a cake, so this one looked good.  I used a 9x13 glass pan because we had a party for 15+ people.  It turned out great.  Like other reviewers, everybody thought it was AMAZING!  People literally said "tastes way better then Dairy Queen".  My only change was to substitute oreos and I left out the chocolate syrup.  I also doubled the recipe as I was using a bigger pan, and I made sure to liberally spray the bottom with PAM.  It was perfect.  Nothing stuck to the bottom and even the frozen cookies tasted great.  I will make again.  10 X easier and 10 X cheaper then any store-bought substitute.

I made this for my fiancee's birthday party, and it was such a hit! We had a DQ cake too, but everyone wanted the one I made instead (or as well). For the base, I crushed up 1 pkg of double stuff oreos (didn't use any margerine - didn't need to). I put regular oreos (it took about 3/4 of a package) around the sides of a clear 9x12 pan. Spread Hershey's chocolate sauce over base, then sliced a block of cookies & cream ice cream on top of that. Next, used a small ice cream scooper for scoops of blueberry cheesecake ice cream and cookies & cream ice cream. Topped with more choc. sauce and a package of mini oreos. Super sweet, but very good. It cost about $20 to make because I used premium ice cream and storebought cookies. But it went over so very well!

I now know why it is suggested to make this with different flavors of ice cream.  If using just vanilla ice cream it can be boring.   "It was like a dish of ice cream with "some" cookie crumbs."   Please try different combinations that suit your taste.  Do not worry that it will become too sweet.  The people I served were just being polite and telling me it was delicious.  I knew better.  I had them add more topping on their individual slices. I will make again, but with ALOT more FLAVOR.  Very presentable.  The results are very impressive. Worth the effort.

This recipe has definately become a favorite at our house and anyone elses house I bring it along to. I varied the recipe by,using a 9x13"pan, I used a Oreo crumb crust, a layer of chocolate fudge, then I open a 1 litre square box of chocolate mint Ice cream, by slicing the icecream its alot easier to put slices on top of the fudge layer. Then I make up the whip cream and give it a hint of peppermint flavoring, and tint it a pretty green, then alternate balls of icecream and balls of green whip cream on top. Then I drizzle more of the fudge sauce on top of them. Very pretty when done. Used this recipe on St.Patricks day!!

Husband said this was the best dessert he had ever had - and he's had a lot of desserts!  

Don't forget to nuke the hot fudge before trying to spread on crust.

This was great!  I used Keebler chocolate chip cookies, chocolate and vanilla ice cream and Hersehy's hot fudge.  As suggested by other reviewers, I spread out both ice cream layers and I put the Cool Whip on and stuck it back in the freezer (instead of doing it before serving).  It was a little messy to cut, but I think if it had froze a little longer it would've been easier.  People loved it!

I followed this recipe with a few of the modifications listed by others.  I sprayed the 9-inch spring-form pan with cooking spray.  I used crumbled Oreo cookies mixed with butter as the base and Nilla wafers standing up as the edging around the outside.  I heated the hot fudge sauce and drizzled 3/4 cup over the Oreo base.  The original author was spot on -- 20 cookies and 1/4 cup butter was the exact amount.  After freezing, I spread the first layer of Vanilla ice cream and crumbled Oreos and Nilla wafers on top.  After freezing, I spread on the 2nd layer of Vanilla ice cream and topped with more crumbled Oreos, Nilla wafer cookies and hot fudge.  I froze for 4 hours with aluminum foil on top so not to pick up any freezer odors.  After releasing it from the spring form pan, I spread the top with Cool Whip.  It was the perfect summertime birthday cake for my ice-cream loving husband.  I'll make this again -- I love the endless possibilities for modifying it!

I tried to use lower fat icecream to save some calories but THIS DOES NOT WORK WELL!!  This would be a 5 if I had not tried to skimp! The reduced fat makes the icecream too mushy to do the second layer correctly.

This was a HUGE hit at 7yos family birthday party. I made 2 "pies", one had Keebler grasshopper crust with mint choc. chip ice cream on bottom and cherry choc. chip on top (with hot fudge middle)and the other had strawberry ice cream on bottom and vanilla bean on top with Chips Ahoy crust with strawberry sundae topping in place of hot fudge. EVERYONE loved them and had to try both. This is a great recipe because you can use whatever ice cream and cookies you like. I highly recommend it. Also, very easy to put together. I will say hot fudge is difficult to cut thru when frozen. Strawberry was alot easier.

This was a big hit in our family. My son does not like cake and this was a great alternative for his birthday. All three of my boys used this for their birthday cakes.  Each picked out the type of ice cream and they used oreos for the crust.  They topped it with thier favorite candy ranging from crumbled Heath Bars, to Skittles, to an m&m gummy worm & sugar octupus mixed topping for the 7 year old.  The candy did the decorating, all I had to do was add the candles.  If you use the candy, don't add it until ready to serve.

Love it. Omitted cherries as they are not a family favorite. I also added cookie dough bits to the middle, and made it all flat layers instead of the balls on top. Great and easy to make with kids!

So yummy! It was literally gone in less than 5 minutes at the BBQ I brought it to. I used oreo's, coffee icecream and mint fudge...whipcream but no cherries. OMG the combo between the mint fudge, coffee and oreos was sooo good. So easy too and hella fun to decorate. One thing though - I'd advise to freeze the cookie layer before adding the fudge layer or else it gets stuck together and won't spread.

Everyone in my family absolutely loved this -- it works for all ages, right down to my 8,6,and 3 yr olds.  I rushed the chill times, which was a messy mistake, and my scoops on top didn't look nice so I took them off, softened them, and made the top layer flat like the bottom.  I also used chewy cookies instead of crisp ones, which I thought would ruin it, but it was very easy to work with and cut, and tasted delicious.  This one actually DESERVES it's 5 stars!

Simplified this a little by throwing a package of double stuff oreos in the food processor which ground them perfectly.  Used half for the crust with two layers of different flavored chocolate ice cream and the cookie/margerine mix between.  Just topped it with cool whip.  I omitted the fudge and cherries because I felt it was sweet enough.  Next time, I might use my peeler to shave some chocolate from a  cold Hershey bar on top of the cool whip.  Got lots of compliments and it was simple to do.

I made this for my husbands birthday, he loves reeses peanut butter cups so I crushed some of those for garnish on top and little ones along the edge.  It turned out to be amazing and didnt last long.  The crust was to die for.

You can't go wrong with this.  I didn't have a full box of cookies (didn't hide them fast enough :)), so I didn't place whole ones around the edge.  Instead I crumbled 5-6 cookies and put them between the layers of ice cream with some drizzed hot fudge.  I too, did not use scoops for my 2nd layer of ice cream, I just spread it.  Then I used a cookie scoop and scooped my semi-frozen whipped topping and place those on top with some more drizzled hot fudge.  Looked great and tasted great and was super easy for a fraction of the cost of a pre-made one!  Thanks!

Very nice! Fun and easy to make....beautiful presentation!
I did not use a springform pan but placed two layers of plastic wrap in a deep dish pie plate.  Then I added everything as stated, froze, then removed the whole pie, took off the plastic wrap, and served in a pretty large platter.

I used strawberry,vanilla & choc ice cream anf freezed them btw layers,and top it off with balls of cookies n cream ice cream..it tasted quite gd.. however,the crust tasted TERRIBLE to me..it seems tt the fudge made it way too hard and i had prob cutting thru'. Also,as fudge don't freeze easily,it made a huge mess when it started seeping thru' the crust & the ice cream.And this is even aft i followed e directions and freeze it before putting the ice cream.Nxt time,i'll juz ommit the fudge.

My entire family enjoyed this recipe.  I decided to make a few minor changes as per other suggestions.  I used a brownie mix to bake brownies in the round spring form pan.  I cut the brownie circle in half leaving half for the base of the cake and then used the other circle as a middle layer in the cake.  I layered brownie, Hershey's chocolate fudge topping, chocolate ripple ice cream, brownie, fuge topping, skor bits, ice cream, then I iced the top of the cake with cool whip.  I decoated the cake with a bit of Hershey fudge topping and 2 broken up skor chocolate bars.  It was yummy and very pretty.

Easy and spectacular! I made this for my nephew's birthday and everyone raved about it. I used chocolate wafers for the crumb layer and around the outside, Chocolate Crunch ice cream for the bottom layer, and vanilla for the scoops. I put a blob of Strawberry Lavender jam on top of each scoop, then drizzled with hot fudge topping. I didn't add any whipped cream. It was gone before it had a chance to melt. This was such a fun dessert to make, and it looked very special. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for a family get together last weekend. It was gone in minutes! Bonus points because I didn't have to turn on the oven. I used packaged cookies for the crust but used Wegmans yummy store-baked chocolate chunk cookies for around the sides. I used choc chip cookie dough ice cream for the first layer and then regular vanilla for the "balls" on top drizzled with hot fudge and decorated with mini M&M's.

I never realize ice cream cake was so easy to make!  I did the ice cream in layers and uses 2 flavors.  In between, I put more fudge and cookie crumbs.  This cake was awesome and the hit of the party!

Was very good! I used cookies that were more soft than crumbly. That might explain why my crust was pretty hard... I crumbled the cookies with the butter and patted them down very tight. Next time I won't pad them down too tight.

I also thought that adding the extra scoops of ice cream on top was too much ice cream. The soft ice cream that I poured in the pie pan almost overflowed the pie pan, I saw no reason to add more on top.

I also found no need to drizzle more chocolate topping on top, there was plenty inbetween the crust and ice cream!

This was a very sweet treat regardless, I could not have imagined it with more ice cream and topping. I really liked it the way I made it. I just have to maybe use crumbly cookies next time.

This is great but the instructions need modification, especially for a pie pan, which I used.  You need 1/4 to 1/3 less of all ingredients or it gets too tall and runs over, looks awful.  Nicely contained, I used thawed Oreo ice cream on on the bottom layer and Chips Ahoy ice cream as the scoops on top.  YUM! Then skip the whip cream and cherries, just drizzle warmed fudge topping randomly on top before you freeze it for 4 hours.  It all hardens nicely that way and there's no "before serving" instructions necessary.  Plus it looks awesome.  I made this for a b-day party for a two year old and all kids and adults loved it.  Everyone said it looked like it was professionaly done.  Served 12 easily.

Wow! I took some of the reviewers' suggestions and customized this for my seven-year-old son's birthday; it was fabulous. I followed basic directions for assembly, including the springform pan (which was key), but I substituted the following:
1. Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookies (12.4 oz) 
2. 1/4 c I Can't Believe It's Not Butter stick
3. 1 Quart Turkey Hill Vanilla and 1 Quart Turkey Hill Choc Chip Cookie Dough (from two 1.5 "half" gallon tubs)

Since I used choc chip cookies as the crust, I layered the vanilla first and let it freeze. Then, I crumbled some cookies between the first and second layers. I did not use scoops as the recipe suggests for the second layer, I just followed the instructions for the first layer. I topped it with cookies and drizzled hot fudge over. And I froze it overnight. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, and removed the springform pan. It was perfect!

This was a huge hit, but I changed a lot.  Did the chocolate chip cookie bottom crust in a 9x13 and lined the sides with Oreos.  Used hershey chocolate syrup in between two layers and just spread the top layer of ice cream (it had melted too much too scoop).  Topped it with some crackle syrup and served with whipped cream, my fiance could not have been happier.  Great base recipe!

I feel guilty for all the compliments I got for making this cake- it was way to easy! All my kids say they want this for their birthdays now. Much more affordable than buying those premade ones at the store and more delicious.

This is a great recipe!  Made this for my hubby for Father's Day, and he almost refused to share, lol.  Will definitely make again, but next time will cut the butter in half, it was way too much, I had to keep adding cookies to absorb it all.  The best thing about this is that you can use so many different combination of cookies and ice cream.  I made with chocolate chip cookies, mint chocolate chip ice cream and vanilla bean ice cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I had some chocolate chip cookies in the freezer and decided to make a mini version of this for Hubs and me.  I used this recipe as a guide, but I think my result was similar to the submitter's intent.  I used a tiny 4" springform pan that I lined with plastic wrap to ensure I wouldn't have trouble getting it out of the pan.  My cookies were too big for my mini pan so I had to skip the border of cookies.  I used black raspberry chocolate chip ice cream, skipped the hot fudge topping, and topped it with whipped cream and a cherry.  Any way you decide to change this up will no doubt be delicious!

I made this for my sons birthday.  It turned out perfect!  I used cookie dough ice cream (his favorite).  It also went well with the cookie crumb crust!  Much cheaper than those expesive one's you can buy!

I adapted this recipe to use leftover chocolate chip and sugar cookies.  I used the sugar cookies for the bottom crust, topped it with chocolate syrup, and used the chocolate chip cookies for the side crust.  I filled it with vanilla ice cream and garnished it with chopped up chocolate chip cookies-Great!  A quick dessert for after Sunday dinner.  Thanks for all the great tips!

I made this with a twist for Christmas, with oreos as the crust and a middle layer and candy cane ice cream on top.  Everyone was very impressed, it was beautiful and very tasty.  Real easy to put together - next year I'm having my kids help!  5 stars - thank you for this recipe!

This is such a great recipe and really lets the user be creative!   I made this for my best friends birthday and was a little bit nervous. I only had 5 total hours to make and chill the cake, but it turned out GREAT!   I used a brownie for the bottom. I baked a brownie mix in a springform pan. I then added chocolate brownie ice-cream, popped it in the freezer for an hour, and added cherry chunk ice cream on top. I added the cherries, hard hershey shell for decoration, and popped it bake in the freezer for about 3 more hours.   It turned out beautiful and SO yummy!  My only issue that I had was getting the cake out of the springform pan. It wanted to stick to the sides, but with some maneuvering and a knife around the edges, it was just fine!  I will definitely be using this and experimenting some more in the future!

I just made this today for my son's birthday and it is almost gone!  I used crushed Oreos (25) on the bottom of the pan w/ the layer of hot fudge. After freezing that for 15 minutes, I used Peanut Butter Jumble (peanut butter ice cream w/ chunks of Reeses peanut butter cups).  I then topped that with the hot fudge and the rest of the oreos crushed up.  After I froze that for 30 minutes, I topped off w/ vanilla ice cream, the rest of the hot fudge, and caramel drizzle.  I froze that overnight.  Before serving, I decorated it with whipped cream and Reeses Pieces.

i made this for my hubby's bday.  he loves cookies and cream icecream, so i used that.  i also used oreo cookies for the crust.  the fudge on the crust seemed much to rich for us though.  too much chocolate.  so if you do oreos, i would ommit the fudge on the crust.  easy to make and tasty other than the richness part.

I found this recipe on this site about 2 years ago and have made it COUNTLESS times since.  I make it all the time for family.  Anyway, I love the versatility of it.  My favorite combo is - chocolate chip pecan cookies, with one layer of vanilla bean ice cream and one layer of Moose Tracks ice cream.  I like to switch it around though and test it with other flavors.  The suggestion to microwave the ice cream is wonderful - I NEVER would have done that if it didn't suggest it.  Thanks!

EXCELLENT.  i made this for my husband's birthday and it went over great.  i crushed all the cookies and make a cookie crust in a spring-form pan instead of leaving some whole.  i also omitted the cherries and topped it with crushed nuts, and drizzled hot fudge and carmel on top before freezing.  it worked great, and looked fabulous.

I had trouble at first getting Oreo cookie crumbs to stick to the bottom.  Here is what I did: I mixed a little more melted margarine with a little fudge, then I took wax paper and put that on top.  The wax paper allowed me to press the cookie crumbs to the bottom of the pan.  Then I put frozen peas on top and put that in the freezer.  It worked like a charm!

So simple and easy to make...as well as customize!  I just finished making mine, with one layer of chocolate ice cream and one layer of vanilla.  I crushed up chocolate sandwich cookies (after taking the creme out) to go in between the ice cream layers.  Looks delicious and I can't wait to present it at the BBQ I'm going to tomorrow!

This cake was amazing. I made it for my mom's b-day, and she said it was best cake she has ever had. I used chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla and still tasted fenomanal. I have made this cake for everyone's birthday, and I never tired of the fabolous taste.

This turned out fabulous! We did cookies-n- cream ice cream for the bottom layer and topped it with Vanilla Ice cream. Served with whipped cream and cherries and it was a hit for my 5 year old's bday party.

Made this for my Dad's birthday,with oreos and vanilla icecream. Everyone loved it and my brother requested it for his birthday.  Sprayed the pan with Pam and didn't have any trouble getting it out. Will definitely make again, so easy and there are a ton of possible combinations.

The only change I made was to use Eddy's slow churned chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream (it has 1/2 the fat of regular ice cream,) instead of just vanilla.  It was awesome!!  The crust/fudge layer was so freaking good.  I also sprayed my spring form pan with Pam, after reading others had issues with it sticking.  I did not have any issues, so thanks to the other reviewers!  This also looked perfect presentation wise.  I had to take a picture and post it for the recipe..   My first ever picture I submitted on here.  Thanks Arvillalar!  This was an easy, delicious recipe and it is so beautiful looking as well!

This is absolutely delicious - better than any ice cream cake I have had in the past.  I used low fat chocolate cookies for the base and sides, frozen yogurt (vanilla fudge chunk) in place of the ice cream.  I also put caramel and fudge sauce in between layers and sprinkled more crushed cookies in the middle and on top.  This is a recipe that you can truly make your own!!  It is a keeper!

This was super easy and VERY good!  I used chocolate ice cream and in between two layers I crushed up some peanut butter cups and topped with more chocolate fudge.  My family loved this!

Although this recipe doesn't need any more comments, I'll explain how I doubled it.  I used a 9x13" pan.  I made an oreo crust for the bottom using 2 sleeves of crushed Oreos.  Then added a half gallon of raspberry swirl.  Then a layer of strawberry sauce and 1 sleeve crushed oreos.  Another layer of strawberry swirl and covered that with whipped cream.  Delicious!

great base & can really mix it up a lot w different flavors.  i wanted to make a neoplitan one so i did an oreo crust, then the fudge topping spread over it (crust + topping was the best part!) - a layer of choc ice cream, a layer of homemade strawberry sauce (recipe on this site), layer of vanilla ice cream, choc frosting spread all over that, strawberry sauce on that, then little puffs of redi whip around edge & big puff in the middle.  it was well-loved, but i learned that the strawberry sauce was a bad idea - frozen strawberries are REALLY cold & they just didn't work.  next time i'll make the sauce to put on at the end.  i was thinking a pretzel crust w a layer of peanut butter then chubby hubby ice cream might be delicious - will try that soon!  i'm so glad i found the recipe - i know i'll use it lots.  thank you!

definitely better than any dairy queen cake!  i like to do 2 layers of ice cream with a layer of the crunchy cookie/fudge in between.  i also let the ice cream soften and smooth the layers because i can't get nice looking scoops on the top!  a choc/p.b. bottom with a vanilla/choc chunk on top is excellent with reese shell topping drizzled over the top!  also did a chocomint version with choc i.c. on bottom, choc. chip mint i.c. on top.  use mint oreos for the 2 crust layers on this one!

OMG sinfully delish! I used chocolate chip cookies with peanut butter chips,Butterfinger ice cream, hot fudge and caramel toppings. It only took one 1/2 gallon of ice cream to make and I poured the hot fudge and caramel over the crust, froze 15mins, put ice cream over that,froze 15mins, and poured more hot fudge and caramel over top and froze overnite.Before we ate it I put extra creamy cool whip on. This was for my bosses birthday and he shared it with our small class. Everyone LOVED it and it was moan out loud good! I will make over and over again and try different flavors.

I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  I used crushed oreos and cookies and cream ice cream for the bottom and vanilla for the top.  I think next time I will do enough of the cookies and butter mixture to put a layer inbetween the ice cream layers.  I also did the 2nd layer like the first by softening it.  very good.. thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again and try different varieties (ie. mint!)

This was delicious! I did make a couple of changes/additions as follows: Used Oreo instead of Choc. Chip Cookies. In addition to hot fudge sauce I also used caramel and put some chocolate chips & heath chips between layers. Made it for Mother's Day and it was the hit of the party. I think this lends itself to using almost any type of cookie and experiment w/different flavors of ice-cream. Thanks, this is a keeper!

i didn't think that this would be anything more than just ice cream and cookies (which is good enough for me) but we couldn't stop eating it. i did end up using only 1 pint of ice cream for each layer (dulce de leche and slow-churned vanilla) because it wouldn't have fit otherwise and i left the top smooth since i don't have the patience or manual dexterity to make the little scoops on top (which look really cute in the picture). apart from that, i used the full amount of cookie crust, fudge topping (smuckers!), and topped it with skor bits and more fudge sauce...really good. oh and to make it more cakey, i placed a number of two bite brownies on the fudge topping layer and covered them with the second layer of ice cream so they wouldn't show...turned out really well - i think you can add anything to this cake and mess with it and it will not taste bad! oh, but one warning: wait until each layer is well frozen before moving on to the next no matter how long it takes...we were impatient and the bottom layer started to melt and drip onto the cookies lining the sides.

Great recipe! I made this last year for a birthday celebration and I am ordered to make it now for every birthday after! Couldn't of been easier. There are so many variations also with different cookies toppings etc. You cant go wrong with this. Only suggestion is to make sure you thaw it a little before serving bc it is insanely difficult to cut. ENJOY :)

Very easy and versatile. Most recently I made this with pecan sandies cookies and pecan & praline ice cream drizzled with caramel on top. Very nice change from the traditional flavors. Delicious!

This turned out well.  I used a pie plate and just lined the crumbled cookies all the way around it like a cheesecake.  I made it a layer cake as well.  It was very yummy, and the only problem was cutting the cake (the crust was very hard to cut, but when it did, it was a very neat cut and not messy).

Yummy! I changed the recipe by using chocolate waffer cookies and butter for the crust and thin mint cookies around the edge and filled it with mint chip icecream!! A great dessert...although when I added the fudge it melted a little too much...c'est la vie...next time I'll add it before I freeze it! Thanx!

My family loved this recipe and it is so super easy that my 7 y/o could help do almost every part of it.  I confess that we made a few changes.  We used Tofutti instead of ice cream.  2 pints for the vanilla base and then 1 pint of vanilla fudge for the decorative balls of ice cream that go on top of that.  We left off the cherries and the whipped cream as the kids didn't want that but it would have made a truly elegant dessert.  However it is VERY family friendly and truly being gobbled by the gremlins!  :-)

This has become a favorite for birthdays.  I
usually put a layer of caramel on the crust, then
a layer of coffee ice cream, a layer of hot fudge, little scoops of cookie dough ice cream on
top, then garnish with hot fudge, Cool Whip, and
maraschino cherries.

Looks wonderful and tastes wonderful. Bryers brand was on sale, so I used vanilla w/ fudge ribbons for the base part and then extra creamy vanilla for the top.. filled in the holes between the icecream spheres with whipped topping, smoothed it over, arranged the cherries in kind of a spiral towards the center, and then dribbled hot fudge over the whole thing. It looks better than something from the store and it's for my sister's birthday. Will make this one again for sure. Oh yeah, instead of using whole cookies around the outside, I broke them into halves because my brother got into them and I didn't have enough to use whole ones!

I made this dessert for my husband for Valentine's Day.  I gave it to him early because he was out of desserts.  He raved about it and said it was wonderful!!! (I have to let you know he is a big advocate of Dairy Queen's ice cream cakes!).  I did substitute Oreo cookies for choc. chip and they were great.  Needless to add, this was a very easy recipe to make.  Will definitely use again!  Thanks!!!!!

Beautiful presentation.   Try sprinkling the balls of ice cream with some sprinkles before the final freeze.  Made for my 10 year old daughter's birthday party and it was a big hit.

I made it in a pie plate and just layered the ice cream flavors (froze 20 mins in between layers), then layers whippped cream above that and froze. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Who wouldn't like an ice cream cake?? Yummy crust.

I made this with organic oreos and mint chocolate chip ice cream. It was a hit for my son's birthday party and so much cheaper then getting an ice cream cake from the ice cream shop!

i love this recipe!!!  i just wish i had thought of it myself.  i made it extra special by using homemade chocolate chip cookies and homemade hot fudge sauce. my husbands two favorite treats are ice cream cake and homemade cookies.  this was a perfect birthday cake for him, and i'll definitely be making it again.  so simple but DELICIOUS!  also, the presentation is most impressive...  :)

As written I thought it had to much cookie crust, not enough fudge sauce and I used not a good combination of ice creams (used cookie dough for bottom & vanilla for top).  I would use maybe a chocolate and something else.  The cookies around the pan are for presentation only and I would leave them off next time.  Everyone else enjoyed this very much.

Awesome - I made this for my husband's birthday celebration.  Everyone loved it.  Next time, I'll probably use chocolate ice cream (maybe two layers of different kinds) since he is such a chocaholic!

Took this to a bbq and everyone LOVED it.  Make sure to freeze for the full time.  Putting it in the deep freeze for a couple of hours is not enough.

Oh my gosh.....this was so good.  You HAVE to make homemade chocolate fudge sauce from this site!! I made this with 1/2 chocolate mint chip and the other half just chocolate ice cream.  I'm dying to try with praline ice cream and pecan sandies like another reviewer suggested.  (and caramel sauce)  Really good!!!  Also.....I never use margarine.....I used butter, much better!!!

These were so fun to make and eat! I made four ice cream cakes for a summer BBQ and everyone seemed to enjoy them. What is so fun about this recipe is you can make it different every time depending on what kind of ice cream or toppings you are craving.

This is a great recipe!!  I used chewy chocolate chip cookies and cookie dough ice cream.  Instead of putting whole cookies around the sides I just mashed up the whole package and melted it with 1/2 a cup of butter and built the crust up all the way up the sides of the pan. (I used a 9 inch pie pan).  I tried to apply the fudge to the crust without heating it first and that didn't work so well, the fudge needs to be heated to spread it, but it still freezes on fine.  Also instead of adding hot fudge before serving I put the fudge on while it was freezing and it tasted delicious.  I was only able to freeze my cake for a few hours and I was worried applying hot fudge would melt the cake too quickly.  This cake could be made so many different ways, I will make it again and again.

This is a great recipe!! You can basically use it to make any kind of ice cream cake you want! I made a butter pecan ice cream cake for my dad for his birthday. He loved it! I used crushed pecan sandies for the bottom,butter pecan ice cream,low fat cool whip with crushed pecans sprinkled on top and pecan sandies all around the sides of the cake!

I changed this recipe around quite a bit but still used the basics.
Bottom of springform pan I used crushed up chocolate peanut butter oreos and butter. Then I lined the pan with chewy chocolate chip cookies (standing up). Then i layered hot fudge on top of the oreos, then chocolate ice cream, then peanut butter topping, then vanilla ice cream, then whipped cream and topped with crushed up mini peanut butter cups. It was a huge hit!!!

This was great!  I substituted Oreos for chocolate chip cookies and used vanilla and butter pecan ice cream.  Also, I added some caramel sauce in between the layers.  This seemed to get better over a few days.  The whole family said that it was better than a Dairy Queen ice cream cake...Enough said.

This tastes heavenly :)! the recipie was really easy to make and it was very basic so you can play around with different variations of cookie and ice cream. Next time I would purchase some extra ice cream because my ice cream ran out.

Very Yummy.  I used philsbury cookie dough and made cookies.  I used half vanilla and half chocolate chip.  I did a layer of cool whip and hotfudge in between the two ice cream layers. Will make again.

I made this for my mother's birthday. I used peanut butter cookies and dark chocolate topping since her favorite candy is the peanut butter cup. I added a layer of topping and crushed cookies between the ice cream layers and omited the ring of cookies around the pan. It turned out fantastic!

This is a great, basic recipe that you can alter to make it your own. For my sister's birthday, I made it with an Oreo theme: I chopped up Oreo cookies for the crust, put a layer of fudge, and then topped it with cookies n' cream ice cream. I broke up some cookies to put on top. It was a great success! Thanks for sharing the recipe; I'm already thinking of other additions I can make for the next one!

My son, who loves Dairy Queen Ice Cream Cake, said that this was better!  Used Oreo cookies, vanilla ice cream for the bottom layer and cookies & cream ice cream for the top layer.  The Oreos were rather 'big' around the edge, but it worked out OK and tasted great.  Lots of possibilities by varying the ice cream and cookie types.

This got rave reviews at my house last night. The only substitution: I used a caramel-vanilla ice cream instead of plain vanilla. I will definitely make this again, and I'm happy to report there was ONE slice leftover for tonight!

I made this for my birthday cake.  I used Breyer's vanilla bean and very chocolate cherry ice cream with an oreo cookie crust.  Delicious!!  I didn't put the cookies around the outside edge and probably should have - the sides were a bit melty.  The fudge layer over the crust makes this EXTRA RICH, but it's very good and flexible.

This is sooo good and easy!  Looks great too and it is very versatile!  I love it!  You could totally switch it up as far as ice cream and cookies.  I made it with 1/2 strawberry ice cream and 1/2 vanilla ice cream.  For the scoops on top I used the strawberry again and added pink sprinkles!  So cute for the ice cream at my daugther's birthday party!

I made this for my boyfriend as a birthday cake. I modified the type of ice cream to his favorite (mint chocolate chip) and put the whip cream on before I froze the entire cake, I think it tastes better that way. He loved it!

This cake is great.  I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he and his roommates really enjoyed it.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and heated the fudge before putting it on the crumbs and this made it much easier to spread although it is still a task.  Other than that, the cake is very easy to make and it is very enjoyable to eat.

I thought this tasted great!!  Everyone loved it!!  I didn't put the ice cream balls on top though.  i made sort of an ice cream pie which I thought looked better and was easier to serve, but it tasted just as good as a bought cake.

What a hit! I made this for my nephew's 11th birthday party and all his friends loved it. They thought it was better than traditional cake. I used chocolate filled Oreos for the crust, cookie dough ice cream, added more hot fudge on the top and then sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. YUM!

This recipe is absolutely the best!  It looks fancy and tastes delicious!  I used vanilla ice cream on the bottom and chocolate ice cream for the scoops, which gave it a pretty two colored appearance.  I also warmed the hot fudge slightly in the microwave to make it easier to spread.  Excellent!  My husband said it was better than any store or restaurant bought ice cream cake!  A definite keeper!

This went over extremely well for my 10 year old son's birthday.  We made it with oreo cookies and added some sprinkles over the whipped cream to make it look more festive.   It cuts nicely and serves a crowd.  Best of all, no waste like with birthday cake.  It seems like it always gets thrown out. My family likes the ice cream the best anyway.  I can think of all kinds of variations with different cookie types.  This is a keeper.

I made this cake to bring to a friend's house.  It was easy to make, minimal mess, which is great when you have small children.  I followed the directions exactly and had no problems. The cake was a big hit for all the adults and children too.  I am about to make the cake again for a July 4th barbeque!

This was such a huge hit at my son's 10th bday that when I was asked to make the cake for the family celebration, they said, "Make another!" Used homemade chocolate chip oatmeal cookies for the base and sides, yummy and chewy even when frozen.  With the second one I used sugar cookies for the bottom, will see what the crowd says.  We used all strawberry ice cream, big fans and gobbed the whip cream on.  Ten year olds wanted multiple maraschino cherries too.  There wasn't a slice leftover, served 20 kids.  Fun to make too, used spring pan and just served it on the metal base, came right out.

Have made several times & its always a hit!  Easy to add your own personal touches ie. crushed oreos/peanuts etc.  Be sure to make the day prior to eating, as it takes many hours to freeze!

I made this for my nephews birthday, using his favorite flavor (mint chocolate chip) and I used  2 packages of chocolate graham crackers and 1 stick of butter for the crust.  My brother didn't think he'd eat it because he's so finicky but he ate it and loved it! It was amazing and easy to make thanks!

takes more ice cream (use an chocolate chip).  Alternate version - use shortbread cookies, vanilla or butter brickle ice cream and caramel sauce.

We really loved this here, but I had a few issues. Most of them were probably brought on by the fact that my freezes decided not to work, so it sat melting for hours before it was actually frozen. The cake was wonderful and enjoyable, though wiked hard to cut. Too hard when frozen, but too melty when thawed a little. The best part of the whole thing is the crust, which got lost when we were cutting it. I scooped it onto the plate next to it, because it was too good to miss, even with faulty presentation! I'll try again because it was so good though!

This was very good, I was doubting the whole cookies on the sides, but it actually came out good. We used mint chip ice cream, caramel and hot fudge with a whipped cream topping. Tons of sugar but soooo good.

Loved this dessert! I accidently left the ice cream out a little too long so it got pretty liquidy, but I ended up being glad I did because it poured into the cake pan very nicely, leaving a smooth top to the cake instead of the scoops. Before putting back into the freezer, I drizzled some thin lines of chocolate syrup across the top in a criss cross pattern. Everyone at the party asked me, "You MADE this?!" What a hit!

Great Recipe!!  I baked a brownie on the bottom of the pan (only put 1/2 the batter in)and then put a layer of hot fudge over it.  I added cookies and cream ice cream. after freezing 30 min as suggested I iced that cake in cool whip, put oreos around the outside and crushed oreos on top.  It was a big hit!!!!

Absolutely delicious!  And don't skimp on the sauce.. I added caramel sauce as well as the chocolate sauce and the kids loved it!  Try it with  different flavours of ice cream too for variation.

I had never made an ice cream cake before attempting this recipe but it was so easy!  I crushed Oreo cookies for the crust and used whole Oreos for the edges.  I put a layer of strawberry ice cream, followed by a layer of Oreo crumbs and a layer of vanilla ice cream on top.  Before serving I added whipped cream and sliced strawberries.  It was a hit!

This cake is amazing, and it's completely customizable. You can mix up the ice cream flavors, mix up the cookie flavors, add different toppings - and the outcome will always be delicious. I made this for my mom's friend's 40th and it was devoured. The only problem I have is that the crust sticks to the bottom.

This was so easy & fun to make.  I used my favorite flavors of ice cream with an oreo crust.  The crust was very good. I also made Chocolate Ganache (from this site) and used that in place of the fudge topping.  I didn't add the whipped cream or cherries, it was perfect without them. I did make the scoops of ice cream on top and thought it looked great---thanks for the recipe!

This is absolutely the best ice cream cake.  I've made it several times including once in a 9x13 glass dish for my son's birthday.  It is so versatile, you can use any kind of cookie or ice cream.  I always put a layer of cookie crumbs between the layers of ice cream.

This was a big hit for my daughter's 8th birthday party. I made it with half vanilla and half cookies & cream ice cream, with a chocolate chip cookie crust. I will definitely make it again and look forward to experimenting with other ice cream and cookie flavors. Oh, and it was super easy to make too!

so amazing and so easy. Just make sure you have enough butter in your crust cause the second time I made this I think I put too many cookie crumbs in it and the crust fell apart when you tried to eat it. But delicious anyway!

I used oreos and made it a two layer cake with the cookies in the middle.  It turned out great!

I used the Chocolate Chip Crust from this recipe and found it turned out great, with a few modifications. I still crushed the cookies but instead of margarine i opted for butter, simply a personal preference. I then packed the mixture into a springform pan much like I would a graham cracker crust. With the oven at 400F I let the crust bake for about 5 minutes. Turned out splendidly. Will Make again!

This was good. I'll definitely use hot fudge topping next time instead of chocolate syrup.  I think I'll double layer it and use chocolate ice cream for one of the layers; and try using oreos for the crust(s). I also used a cake decorator to decorate the top of the whole thing with whipped cream.

With all the yummy stuff that goes into making this cake, how could it not be good? 
My only recommendation is to buy good ice cream. I bought a cheaper kind and wasn't as impressed with it as i think i would have been with a really yummy ice cream. I think next time I will use coffee ice cream.

We really like this recipe!  It is so easy to make and easy to customize to different tastes.  We've tried probably a dozen combinations of ice cream/cookies/toppings.  This is a frequent dessert on our summertime menus!

This was a huge hit at my housewarming and my friends couldn't believe it wasn't store bought!  I used 2 boxes of Entenmann's Chocolate Chip Cookies and used almost 1 entire box for the crust.  Then I used the remaining cookies to line the edge of the springform pan.  When cutting the cake, the cookies provide a perfect guide of where to cut.  And there's plenty of other cookies left over to make mini ice cream sandwiches with.  Also, i used 2 different types of ice cream with a layer of fudge in between:  first layer was cookies 'n cream and the top layer was vanilla ice cream.  Such a delicious treat!

This one is absolutely DIVINE!! I did my crust with Choco cream Oreoz, hersheys choco syrup, caramel choco ice cream for the first layer and then some more crust and fudge. The 2nd layer was a cookies & cream ice cream and i topped it off with almonds at the top plus shredz from a chocolate bar. The cake was very rich indeed. The whip cream had to be omitted because it was already too sweet and the cherries too. Will definitely make this again! However, my freezing times were much longer than those stated in the recipe.

Superb! My family could hardly believe I made something so beautiful and decadent. All my kids are asking for this for their next birthday cake. I found this fairly easy to make and very inexpensive compared to ice cream cakes at DQ or other local restaurants. This will be a family favorite. And it will be a perfect dessert in the heat of summertime.

It is so great!! I made it twice, but because I am a chocolate lover I melt chocolate with some milk, and use that sauce on top (after it is a bit colder). Mmmmmm.... Wish I could eat this everyday!

It tasted as good as it looked!  It was very easy to make and looked like I had taken hours.  Of course the kids loved it.

I loved this recipe as did the people I shared it with.  This recipe is very easy to adapt to your own taste and imagination.  It is also very easy to make.

I think this is one of the best base recipe. I read all the reviews and twisted it based on other suggestions and our taste. I started with 13.5 oz Keebler's deluxe double chocolate chip cookie. Made the cake base using that but couldn't use all of it so saved 1/3 of the butter and cookie crumbs mixture. Spread it on 9.5 inch glass pie dish and stacked Keebler chocolate covered graham cracker on side. Then put the hot fudge then edy's some kind of chocolate ice cream ( had it in the freezer). Then remaining layer of cookie crumbs( this add nice crunch between the layers). Then remaining hot fudge and at last cream cheese topping. Decorated the cake with mixture of pecan, walnut and Heath toffee bites plus chocolate straw. I made this for Saturday night and started it a night before did the base and hot fudge then next morning another layer of ice cream in afternoon cookie crumbs layer then after couple of hours topping.
It was much appreciated....some guests thought it was from store such as cold stone.

I made this ice cream cake three years ago for a friend's birthday, and he still talks about it. His girlfriend just asked me to make it again for his surprise birthday party this weekend. I make several modifications: I used two types of ice cream (vanilla bean and chocolate chip cookie dough). I made a thicker layer of the sweeter one (cookie dough) and used hot fudge as a layer between the two. I had to freeze it after applying the first layer and fudge before the next one, then I used a can of whipped cream and covered the top with little stars and toped it all with sprinkles. I'm going to do it again and possibly make a couple more modifications. Great cake!! Thanks.

I made this for my daughter's 10th b-day party and she loved it. I used a store bought pie crust that I baked in the oven, then put in sliced bananas on the bottom, drizzled it w/ hot fudge. Then I used Dreyer's Tagalong ice cream for the first layer, cut up Tagalong cookies for the middle and used Chocolate ice cream for the next layer. I topped it off w/ some whole Tagalong cookies, whipped cream and more hot fudge.

Excellent!  This ice cream cake was so easy to make and I received many, many compliments on it.  I used chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream for the bottom layer and chocolate ice cream for the top layer (which I spread on top instead of putting scoops on top).  I put a thin layer of cookie crumbs in the middle and on top.  There's so much versatility with this recipe...next time I might try an Oreo cookie crust as other reviewers suggested.  I'm looking forward to making this cake again!

Used Oreos and pulverized them in the food processor.  Coffee ice cream & caramel in addition to the hot fudge.  Skipped the whip cream & cherries.  This was amazing and amazingly easy.  Thanks for the basic recipe, you can do so much by changing the flavor of ice cream & the cookies.

Yummy!  I followed the original recipe, for the most part.  Instead of using all vanilla ice cream, I made the bottom layer out of rocky road, topped that with a layer of cookie crumbs and fudge, spread a layer of vanilla ice cream over that, then garnished with remaining fudge and cookies.  I planned to use whipped cream and cherries for garnish, but quickly realized it perfect without them.  As it was, it was VERY rich...not sure I could even have handled the extra garnish.  What a versatile recipe.  I'm already coming up with variations for next time!

All who ate this, said it was the very best ice cream cake they ever had.    Thanks to Arvillalar for the recipe!!  I used oreos...personal preference....fudge ripple ice cream (what I had on hand)...but any ice cream will do :)   I think using a springform pan is the best way to go with the set up...but that is my preference.  I need to save up on calories for awhile but can't wait to make this again !

For his birthday I gave my husband a choice of oreo or maple/butterscotch and he said 'peanut butter'.  I used oreo crumbs, a layer of peanut butter, a layer of chocolate fudge and topped it all with lactose-free ice cream.  So delicious!  I used Reeses Pieces around the edge, but we found this was too sweet and the flavour didn't mesh somehow, so next time I will use plain chocolate wafers or something that doesn't detract from the peanut butter yumminess.

Thank you for this wonderfully versatile recipe!  I made a variation of the cake using graham cracker crumbs for the base (because we had 9oz of them in a bag that needed using up), chocolate brownie cookies for the sides, brownie chunk ice cream, dark chocolate fudge topping and chocolate pocky. (Pocky are a Japanese treat, thin pretzel sticks dipped in chocolate or an endless variety of other sweet and savory toppings. They're not too hard to find in North America though - I found that 3 small 40g packages were more than enough.)  I put a layer of pocky on top of the first layer of ice cream, then sliced and flattened the remaining layer of ice cream so that I could arrange another layer of pocky on top. I put this in the freezer for a few hours and then drizzled the hot fudge over top and froze again for another hour or so. The end result went over very well with the kids, though I personally was not happy with the base which I found salty (probably should have used unsalted rather than salted butter). However, everyone liked the ice cream cake a lot. This was my first attempt at an ice cream cake and I think we will be making it again quite often, since there is so much variety possible.

This was amazing!  I used store bought choc. chip cookies. with fudge, then a layer of cookie dough ice cream, then a layer of crushed cookies with caramel, then a layer of french vanilla ice cream (spread out not scooped). i used chewy choc chip cookies for the outside and to decorate on top and it was ammmaazzzing! I already have requests for my bother-in-law's birthday cake :) This cake was very easy to make. It just took alot of time for the freezing between each step.

I made this recipe for Father's day and it was a big hit.  I used oreo's for the crust.  Then mint chocolate chip ice cream then another layer of crushed oreo's more mint chip ice cream and surrounded the cake with Keebler's Mint Wafer cookies (similar to girl scout thin mints).  Loved it!

This is a very good "base" recipe to go off  of. It tastes great and looks good. We used oreos instead of chocolate chip.

Thank you for this recipe!  It helped me turn a lemon into a lemonade (so to speak!)  I tried to make the Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie from this site and it ran over into my oven.  I wasn't sure what to do with the cookie that was still on my baking stone...someone in my family suggested an ice cream cake so I did an ingredient search and came up with your recipe.  I didn't have to add the butter as my cookie crumbs were still soft, so I just used a fork to press it into the pan.  Well, the final product was awesome...I'm glad I had the chance to try this recipe and will definitely use it again.  Just a tip...make sure this is fully frozen or you won't have much luck cutting it.

I also made this for Father's Day. It was a big hit & I have another in the freezer to serve to company tomorrow.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't garnish the cake.  I just set out the whipped cream, cherries, chopped peanuts, fudge sauce, carmel sauce, etc. and let everyone do their own thing.  If you just use vanilla ice cream, I do think it's a good idea to use the "good stuff".  Our favorite is Wells Blue Bunny Homemade vanilla.  It's outstanding!

I used caramel instead of fudge for the crust, and then for the top I used caramel and fudge.  It worked well.

Wow how easy was it to make this! It was a big hit for Fathers Day. I made 2 different ones, Chocoloate Chip Rocky Road and Orea Cookie & Cream. Melts fast so dont take it out too soon from the freezer. Will make over and over again with different combos.

I made this for my dad last night for Father's Day today, and it turned out great! Very easy to make, and it was delicious. I didn't use all of the ice cream, however. I bought a 1.75 qt box of ice cream, and ended up using MOST of it, but not all. So a little less ice cream still works. When I get the oppurtunity to make this again, I'm going to try a different flavor. There are so many possibilities with this! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent results and easy too!  Everyone raved about it and said it looked so yummy that I could sell them to restaurants.  I made this with Matt's cookies and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  The best part is the bottom crust.

Excellent Recipe. Very sturdy and great tasting and very easy to make. However I didn't use scoops of ice cream on top I just made a smooth cake and then swirled hot fudge on top as well.

Excellent ideas for a simple and delicious ice cream cake! I used choc chip cookies with m & m pieces for the outer rim. Also added caramel sauce on top of the crust instead of hot fudge. Then added vanilla then a layer of hot fudge and a layer of double fudge brownie ice cream. It was a huge hit for our Fourth of July party!!

If course it tastes great. It's cookies and ice cream! The thing is, it's a lot of work to come out tasting like a scoop of ice cream with crushed cookies, whip cream and a cherry on top. The bottom is very hard to break apart while eating with a fork.  It was delicious, so you could make the crust with fudge topping on cookies sheet , freeze, and just crumble that over the ice cream.  Tastey, not worth the effort.

Delish! Made it the first time for a co-workers birthday and used chocolate chip ice cream and vanilla bean with chips ahoy cookies crushed and as the "back" for each slice. It was a huge hit! Such a hit, in fact, I decided to make it for our 4th of July BBQ. Everyone raved about it! That time I used Salted Butterscotch and Vanilla with vanilla sandwich cookies as the "back" and a graham cracker crumb crust. Again a hit. I actually got a request to make it for the next family birthday in a couple of weeks. Super easy and you can do whatever you want as far as flavors go. Love it!

Homemade chocolate chip cookies make this great with your favorite ice cream - we use cookie dough and a layer of vanilla

I made an Oreo cookie crust and used chocolate and cookies and creme ice creams. Topped with redi-whip on top. Garnished with chocolate syrup and more Oreo cookie crumbs. I used a 10" pan. It turned out amazing!!

I made a CMP (chocolate, marshmellow & peanuts) ice cream cake. So that I could transfer the finished cake to a nicer serving plate I did the following: used 10" spring form, lined the bottom of the pan w/ wax paper & then closed the form around it. Mixed oreos w/ butter for crust, then froze. Cut wax paper to line border of spring form (used PAM as glue, keeping the wax paper stuck to the side).  Added hot fudge, froze, added marshmellow fluff (heated) & chopped peanuts, froze, added vanilla ice, froze & repeated the fudge/marshmellow/nut/ice cream layers. After last freezing, I used 2 spatulas to transfer the cake to a nice platter, peeled away the wax paper sides & "frosted" the sides w/ vanilla ice cream, so you couldn't see the layers & sprinkled nuts on top. Prior to serving, I added whipped cream & maraschino cherries on each pc & in center. My only complaint is that it melted fast once serving & turned into a huge mess. After reading more reviews, this could be because I used sugar free ice cream.  I'm going to try it again w/ full fat/sugar/etc. coffee & chocolate ice creams!!

Super recipe.  We made this with Moose Tracks ice cream and used butter instead of margarine for the crust and it was fabulous - much better than the B&R's ice cream cake we had purchased for $20+ for the last birthday.

Wonderful recipe that leaves plenty of room for creation. I used chocolate ice cream as my first layer, coated it with fudge, then added a different layer of coffee ice cream. My boyfriend requests this dessert for every special occasion! The cookie crumb crust coated with fudge is DELICIOUS!

My son made this cake last Thanksgiving, everyone loved it and he was very proud of himself. Easy recipe for children. I would like to try it with another cookie because I am not fond of chocolate chip cookies, perhaps oatmeal!
