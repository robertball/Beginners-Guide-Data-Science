I had to try this recipe after reading some reviews, even though it was way out of my comfort zone, in regards to flavors. I'm not a fan of eggplant or lamb, but decided to try the eggplant,i did however substitute ground beef for the lamb. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I omitted the rosemary, and i didnt have dried mint..but added fresh mint on top before serving. Also decided to cook mine in the Slow cooker (too hot for oven today)..knowing it was going into the slow cooker i reduced the liquids just a touch. I used a 12oz jar of a delicious Tomato, Olive, and Ouzo sauce..which was gifted to me (DELISH)and used only 2/3 cup of the chicken broth. Overall this was great...and i didn't have a problem with the eggplant..all the flavors complimented each other real nicely...I Also really loved what the Lemon did to this dish..made it seem real fresh! Cooked in slow cooker on low for 4 hours.

Mama Mia this is good! I would give this 10 stars if I could! I am so glad I tried it as I never really liked eggplant before this. But I will definitely make this again and again!One of the things that might have put this over the top was the sauce I used. I was lucky enough to be gifted a Tomato, Olive and Ouzo sauce imported from Greece, if you can find that or make that sauce I highly recommend it! With the Greek sauce in mind, I used Greek seasoning instead of the lamb seasoning but kept the cumin, paprika and mint the same. I also added a dash of allspice, a little chili flake and half a chopped red pepper to the onion mixture. I also used a 14 ounce can of copped tomatoes instead of fresh as that's all I had on hand. Like the recipe submitter says, the longer the stove-top the better the outcome!! I also baked it uncovered like recommended! I wasn't sure if I'd prefer just bread or served over rice so I tried both. Rice definitely makes it a meal, and it soaks up the sauce. But the bread is good too, and served with a salad would make a lighter meal. My husband and I sprinkled some parmesan on ours, and I thought "how good would this be if I drizzled a béchamel sauce over top?" So I made a basic béchamel with parmesan cheese and a dash of nutmeg, poured that over the casserole and baked for 15 minutes. Oh-so-awesome!! I could see this used as a sauce over orzo, pasta or egg noodles. Put this on your must-try list!~~update--This tastes even better the next day!

A very good recipe.  This is a keeper.  Other than using canned tomatoes, I followed the recipe exactly.  Direction number six should say transfer one-half of the sauce to the casserole dish.  I halved the recipe for the two of us and we had plenty left over for another night's dinner.  I did serve a big salad and a side vegetable with it.

This recipe was easy to follow. I did use fresh herbs from m my garden that compliment the ingredients, like oregano and basil. I will repeat this one. I like the tip on keeping the sautéed lamb like badly made meatballs, it kept it chunkier and more flavorful

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and I have made it 3 times. I increased all the spice amounts except salt.. as I like it that way. I sent the recipe to a friend who doesn't like lamb, and suggested she might like it with ground beef.. but if so, I wouldn't put the mint in. THE MINT and other spices really do the trick. One large eggplant with other ingredients makes about 4 servings.

Great flavor. Simmered it over the stove, with lid slightly open for an hour instead of using the oven. The dish turned out like a bolognese sauce or chunky stew, delicious.

Lamb needs to be drained after cooking for lower fat and better mouth feel. Very good.

I made it as written with the exception of doubling the spices and using canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  It was good but still a bit bland.  Next time I think I would use substantially more spices.  But I will make it again.

This turned out pretty well.  I followed the recipe very closely, except that I added a lot more of the spices than was called for... this definitely wasn't over-powering, so I'm glad I did.  We ate it out of bowls with dollops of greek yogurt, which was a good addition.

Like the concept, but the photo is unrelated to the recipe!! The dish in the photo has cheese while the recipe doesn't.

Very flavorful and well textured. Added some extra seasoning in roughly the same recommended proportions. Used 2 cans of no-salt diced tomatoes, drained, as I had them on hand. Used refrigerated, bottled lemon juice from the produce section.

I have not yet prepared this but after sight reading the recipe I can say it's got to be a WINNER. This is pretty close to my Family's (Armenian descent) version of Musaka but "Deconstructed". Wonderful idea for a large family or gatherings.

Added a little more spice, zucchini, fresh tomatoes and mint and I also gently simmered it for hours, slightly covered, on the stovetop.  OUTSTANDING!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I like my eggplant very soft so I cooked it a long time covered.  It was very, very good.  served with rice and yoghurt sauce I make with garlic powder, salt and dill.  Would be great with pita as a kind of greek sloppy joe.  the meat did not resemble "little meatballs" for me, but was just like ground meat.  you could do it with little meatballs, but doing it like this you just get like a chunky sauce.   I had a prepared greek seasoning from the store and I just used that.

We really liked this recipe.  The only change I made was to use one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes and the tomato sauce.  I prefer to let the other vegetables shine a little more with less tomato.  Thanks for posting this.

Really enjoyed this one.  Followed the recipe as closely as possible (I'm allergic to onion, so we used dried minced instead of fresh) and it was delicious!  There are only a couple of small changes I would recommend.  Next time, I'm going to stick with the 45 minute cook time, instead of an hour.  The eggplant was very, very tender, but may have been a little too done for my taste.  And add the rice the end of the recipe suggests.  I did this as just the dish, and we had bread as a side, and ended up putting it on the bread instead of just dipping into the sauce.  The spices give it a wonderful flavor, but you almost need a slightly bland background to it, or it can be a little overpowering.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe though!  This one's a keeper!

I thought this was very good.  I will make it again. I served it with bread.  I did add 1/2t Greek seasoning as one reviewer mentioned that and I had it in the cupboard. I would put it in a category of a  "comfort" food.

I tripled spices based on comments. Be sure to drain lamb before adding to dish.  Would have been very greasy had I not dine so.  
This was good.  Hubby put it over couscous.  Would make again.  To ease time I would consider canned tomatoes.   I did vege potion in oven proof  Dutch oven. Then cooked lamb in separate skillet and added to Dutch oven before baking.

Amazing! Did it fully in a wok as I didn't have a casserole dish with the oven. Kept adding water so it wouldn't stick to the bottom, simmering 45 minutes. Perfection.

Delicious!  I didn't have lamb (my bad I know) so I used ground pork...it was the bomb.  I also added a couple hot Hungarian peppers (we like spicy!!) and mixed in a little cream with the tomato/lemon sauce to make it a little less acidic.

My family loved this receipe!  Mine was more like a stew, I added a few more tomatoes from our garden, and used a 2 quart bowl Pyrex.  It was delicious!!

No changes made to this recipe, which was amazing! It was authentically Armenian- the balance of eggplant and tomato and lemon with the lamb was spot on. It is immediately one of our favorite meals and will be part of a regular rotation. I love that it is also Whole 30 compliant. Mostly love that it is so delicious!

This was very tasty except that the lamb flavor was a bit overwhelming (might have just been my lamb).  I agree that it fould use more spice. I added salt and more garlic & pepper but it was still a bit bland.

I used zucchini and yellow squash instead of eggplant. I also grilled the zucchini, onion, celery and squash on the grill. 
It turned out incredible!

Quick question.  The photo look as though there is bechamel sauce or cheese on top.  Is that just the eggplant?

Really liked this.  I used more seasoning than what it called for. I would recommend tasting before you add.   It is delicious!  I used ground lamb!  Will make again!

It's a very wet casserole, so next time I think I'll add double the eggplant to soak up the tomato sauce and create more substance.

I make a version of this recipe on the stove top, using much less chicken stock (if at all, depending on the amount of liquids).  Serve with Tzatziki sauce for a great meal!
