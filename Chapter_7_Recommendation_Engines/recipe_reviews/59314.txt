This drink is yummy. Seems so simple, but it's really good. Next time I'll make more and serve it as punch instead of individually.

This was very good. The combination of whiskey and amaretto are very balanced, one isn't overpowering the other. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis! I used homemade amaretto.

This drink has a very light taste. When I first tasted it, I really liked it; halfway through one was all I wanted, though. I won't make it again, but then again, I've never liked whiskey.

This is my kind of no garnish-no frills drink (though, I did a cherry because I love any excuse to eat maraschino cherries).  I enjoy a 7 & 7 as a nightcap occasionally and I enjoyed the addition of amaretto and could see myself regularly adding at least a splash of amaretto now to my 7 & 7's.  I also dig the homage to the college dorm in the naming of this cocktail.  Cheers, KIRALEWIS!
