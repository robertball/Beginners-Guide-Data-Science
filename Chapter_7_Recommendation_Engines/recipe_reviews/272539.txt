I am the submitter of this recipe and in my original submission I added an extra step not listed in the published recipe. Once baked, I placed chicken in the broiler for 2-3 minutes, charring the skin to taste. It makes all the difference!

One of the easiest and tastiest oven-baked chicken drumsticks I had.  I am making it again.

I made it as directed using chicken thighs,  It was ok but a bit bland.  Given the number of ingredients, that surprised me. I probably won't make it again.
