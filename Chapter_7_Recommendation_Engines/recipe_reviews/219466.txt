I made these cookies but with regualr 'storebrand' chocolate chips, and left out the chopped peanuts. Basically followed the recipe (didn't feel like chopping nuts and had no unsalted on hand) and they came out really good and I am picky about my cookies!

I also used different chocolate chips (Nestle) and omitted the nuts (like the other poster, no unsalted on-hand).  Great cookies, didn't miss the nuts and definitely if you're going to add them, make sure they are UNsalted, especially if you add the optional 1/2 tsp. of salt already.

I thought these were pretty boring. There's no need to chop the peanuts it would be much easier to use chunky peanut butter. I wont be making these again.

I doubled this recipe. I used one cup Nestle's Halloween semi-sweet chocolate chips (half were orange colored) and one cup Reese's peanut butter chips. I also added an additional quarter cup of flour because the batter seemed a bit loose to me. Baked at 350*, my cookies were perfect at 10 minutes, 30 seconds. I let them cool on the sheet for two minutes, then pulled them off to cool on the kitchen counter. Chewy and soft, these cookies are excellent. Six thumbs up from my husband and kids.

I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding peanuts and I didn't skip the salt like so many did ...

I read the other reviews before I actually made this and was skeptical but I added a little extra crunchy peanut butter high quality brand and used store brand chocolate chips and I must say we love these cookies.  We make again and again!

the recipe alone wasn't all that impressive, but then i tweaked it by adding more peanut butter and on accident left out the baking powder but they turned out so smooth and yummy oh also did not use ghirardelli chips i used milk chocolate store brand chips. DELISH!

The cookies were good and looked great, but lacked something tastewise.  A little bland - not enough peanut butter flavor and could have used a few more chocolate chips.  I omitted the peanuts - which may have helped. They did not need the optional salt.

I accidentally spilled more chocolate chips into the mix and forgot the nuts. They weren't amazingly delicious - said no one in my family.

We were looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe with some peanut butter flavor. These were perfect, best of both worlds. They don't flatten out very much so if you like a thinner or crispier cookie you'll want to squish them down a little bit.

I loved this! I did use a combo of extra crunchy and regular peanut butter (and then I just kept adding peanut butter...haha) and mini chocolate chips. I thought these were fantastic!

These are SO good! Made a few changes though. I used WowButter instead of peanut butter and ground up oatmeal to use instead of the regular flour called for.  My son has many allergies and I am SO happy that this turned out!!  Just allow to cool well on the pan before taking them off.

Overall really good. I used a flax egg, extra crunchy peanut butter, and a combination of peanut butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips (homemade and Nestle, respectively). They turned out delicious!

These were amazing! I took them to work, and my coworkers gobbled them up. I didn't add the peanuts and only used half the salt called for, and they were delicious.

Husband loves peanut butter cookies with chocolate, so had to try these. I used other brand chocolate chunks, and no salt because my peanuts were already salted. I also used 2/3 cup peanut butter to ensure a big peanut flavor. These turned out good, but not mind blowing. They did actually make 2 dozen cookies, which I feel like never happens!

These were okay.... I only had milk chocolate chips, I wish I had dark I think that would have made them better.  I used unsalted butter and not added salt (and light PB) and it still seemed a little salty- for sure I didn't think it needs the added salt.   They didn't cook up quite as nice as some of the other pictures show and the edges browned far before the centers were cooked.  They were alright, not amazing

My changes: no chopped peanuts, natural peanut butter, swapped oil for butter and reduced it to 3 T, soy milk instead of milk (and doubled the amount). I used 60% cocoa solids chocolate chips. Yum! My kids kept begging for more.

I doubled this recipe and it turned out great! I used crunchy PB and omitted the peanuts just because that’s what I had on hand. I made sure not to over bake them. If anything they might have been a little under done but where so delicious! Very rich!

Very tasty! Great recipe and flavors are good. I used regular JIF peanut butter, Nestle chocolate semi-sweet chips, and chopped nut topping that I had on hand. Don't think I'd use the nuts again, didn't really do anything for the recipe so I will omit them next time, or maybe use a different type of nut instead. Wasn't too thrilled with how dense they were in the center and want to try to perfect it so they have more fluff and bake more even. I know that's harder to do with peanut butter. If left in 'my' oven more than 12 min, they would have burned on the bottom. I did use softened 'real' butter, so I'm surprised they were a little flatter than my other cookies come out. Generally using softened real butter (not melted) allows for some fluff, but it did not give that result with how this recipe was written. The peanut butter seemed heavy, so maybe it needs more flour? I'm hopeful I can find a tip or two in the reviews to come up with the right combination of ingredients to make them even better. I will make them again... they honestly were quite good... I'm just not a fan of dense/flat cookies.

These turned out great. I used natural peanut butter, didn’t add salt, did added a mixture of peanut butter and semi sweet chips.   I have small children so I made my dough balls a little smaller for a smaller cookie- yielded 3 dozen. (Very important to chill the dough it helped it set up)

Turned out great. Recipe yields about two dozen 3” cookies. I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy peanut butter and eliminated the nuts. Worked just fine.

Recipes makes just enough

The flavors taste good together.

Pretty standard cookies. Based on some of the comments, I added a quarter cup of peanut butter and some flour, and cut the baking powder in half. Not sure I should've added the flour; they would've been chewier without the extra.

They were good. Moist and tender. I did add a little more pb and added buds along with semi sweet buds.

I mixed the butter and the sugars together first then i used 2 tablespoons of milk then added vanilla. I didn't have baking powder so i use baking soda and did 3/4 of a teaspoon. Then slowly added the flour and used 2 eggs instead. Cook for 10 minutes in mini muffins pan. Turned out super fluffy. I also used more then 1/2C of peanut butter but i eyeball the measurement. I used milk chocolate Ghirardelli and some mini semi sweet chips :)

I made these for my family.  Everyone loved them.  I just used "storebrand" chocolate chips and left out the chopped peanuts.  I had no peanuts so no big reason for leaving them out.

I really liked these! 
I had to make a couple of minor changes, simply because I was out of a few things. I didn't have creamy peanut butter or peanuts, so I subbed chunky peanut butter in their place. I was also out of baking powder so I subbed a mixture of cream of tartar & baking soda. Lastly, I only had Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips on hand, so I used those in place of the semi sweet. Otherwise followed the recipe. I very lightly sprinkled each unbaked cookie with a bit of coarse ground Himalayan pink salt and then baked for only 9 minutes. (I like my cookies a bit under done.) These were a wonderful sweet & salty treat that my whole family enjoyed. I will definitely make them again.

I added 1/3 c cocoa, 1/4 c white and brown sugar each, and used roasted salted peanuts to it.  They are perfect
