Delicious and fresh tasting....I actually dumped the bacon bits and cranberries in while chopping the veggies not realizing they were to be added at serving time and they taste great! So far I haven't used the whole bottle of dressing just in case it get's to be too soupy. It would be very good with any oil/vinegar based dressing and easy to use fat free to save calories...if one feels they must. I will like to eat this for several meals in the warm weather. I think I'll also make it for the next pot-luck. I think cubed jarlsberg cheese would be really tasty in this salad if you wanted to add a little protein.

The bacon and the cranberries add a nice touch to this pasta salad.

I omitted the cranberries and added tiny cubes of mozzarella and substituted the bacon for sliced, hard, quartered slices of salami.  Wonderful results.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Mangia!

This looked like a good and easy one for a hot summer day when you don't want to have the oven going. I did cut up some mild chedder cheese and addded it to the mix.  My husband,  who does not normally like pasta even liked it.....

Great recipe! I've never added cranberries to a pasta salad before but I really liked the sweetness with the sharp provolone. I added chickpeas for extra protein. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent salad!! I made exactly as directed using real bacon bits, and Olive Garden's Lite creamy Italian dressing found in my grocery store (1/2 a bottle was plenty)  My family raved. We really liked the dried cranberries--not often found in a pasta salad. Together with the cucumber, they added interest.

I really liked this.  Used whole wheat pasta and ditched the olives.  Also used cut up bacon instead of bits.  Great flavor.  Perfect for a summer day/night.

Great tasting, pretty and easy!  Top three recipe necessities for me.
Always looking to reduce calories, I kept recipe as is but doubled the veggies. For Christmas touch I used Christmas shaped pasta.  I know my Grandkids will love it!

This salad was great, however I only used half of the salad dressing as it would have been swimming if I had used a whole bottle.

I added
 small cheddar cheese cubes 
mayo

I left out
cucumber 
onion 

I didnt care for the zesty Italian flavor of the salad dressing so I added some mayo to calm the flavor down and it worked great. I will make this again. the family loved it. Yum!

I made this for an alternative to sandwiches for my kiddos lunches. I left out the tomato, bacon and cranberries and it was still great. I cut the cucumber, pepper and red onion all into small pieces.  Three of us took this for lunch and I still have a whole container at home.

Was a huge hit at our party!  Only used 1/2 the bottle of dressing. Cranberries and bacon were a great touch!  Thank you for an awesome recipe :)

Fantastic!  I added some cubed mozzarella and cut the amount of dressing in half, which was plenty. I brought it to a potluck and everybody raved. I will definitely make it again.

Super good and pleases everyone! I've made this for multiple summer get togethers. I usually add some cubed cheese.
