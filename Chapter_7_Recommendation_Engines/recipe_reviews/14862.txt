My only complaint about this recipe isthe bread was a bit dry next time i will probably brush some olive oil infused with gralic onto the toasted baugette slices. I did like that mozzerella was sprinkled on then melted on top of the tomatoes. It kept the tomatoe mixture in place while you bit into it. I made this for my dad for dinner tonight and he thought it was great, even though he's not a big bruschetta fan. I will definately use this recipe again.

I used 5 plum tomatoes, about 1/4 red onion, 1/2 tsp dry basil, 1/2 tsp minced fresh garlic, a dash of oregano, and topped finished brushetta with feta cheese crumbles.  Original recipe has too much onion for our taste.

I like my bread a little crispy for bruschetta, so I broiled the slices for 5 minutes and then topped with everything but the cheese.

It is very fast and easy. I personally thought it could use a little more seasoning. It was good I will keep this one.

I think olive oil is a missing ingredient here--I drizzled it on before adding the cheese.  Also, shredded parmesan is our personal preference with bruschetta to mozzerella.  More traditional for a bruschetta.  Otherwise, this is the only recipe for bruschetta I've found with all the ingredients of my memory: garlic, onion, basil & oregano--not just tomatoes & cheese.  Thanks!!

OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  My picky mother and husband both loved this.  My mother who rarely eats a bite of bread ate two pieces.  I did make a couple of previously suggested changes; added a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.  I tried it two ways; both with a little butter added before toasting and without, and it was better without the addition of butter.  I used slices of cheese and think they would be better than using shredded.  Loved it so much that I plan on making it as soon as the menu would allow it!!  Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is really good... I made a couple of changes and minced some black olives and added it to the tomato mixture and also added a splash of olive oil..On the bread I spread a very thin layer of Jalapeno garlic spread..I also used shredded mozarella..It was so good we have had it twice this week..It goes great with the "Tomato Chicken Parmesan" recipe from this sight...

I made it last night and it was very nice. As a garlic lover I added 3 large cloves instead of the one and I used home made Italian herb bread instead.

I scaled this recipe back to 6 servings and used 1/2 loaf of french bread. I used fresh garden tomatoes and fresh herbs in the recipe instead of dried.  Before broiling the bread slices, I drizzled with EVOO. Topped each piece with freshly shredded mozzarella cheese. Hubby and I ate every piece for lunch!  Will make again.

This was delicious, however, not worth the effort to make the bruschetta yourself.

These were very good!  I only had French bread so I used it instead. I sliced it and brushed it with some olive oil as others' suggested.  To save time I used canned diced tomatoes (drained) and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  Makes a great late night snack!

Trick or treat was from 6-8 pm here last night, so I made this for Hubs and me to munch on while sitting on the front porch handing out candy.  It was great!  Just enough to tide us over until a late dinner.  I made a small amount for just the two of us.  I did change the process and was happy with the results.  I combined the tomato mixture early in the day and covered it.  I let it sit at room temperature until needed.  I try to NEVER refrigerate tomatoes, as they lose flavor.  I brushed both sides of my baguette slices with a little EVOO and toasted both sides under the broiler.  Then I topped them with the tomato mixture and shredded mozzarella.  Popped them back under the broiler just long enough for the cheese to melt.  Perfectly yummy!

Great bruschetta!  The only things I did differntly was to brush the bread with olive oil before toasting, then switching too broil for the last 2-3 minutes instead of the lower setting.  This helped get the cheese bubbly and the bread a bit crisper.

Very good bruschetta.  I added about two tablespoons of olive oil to the tomato mixture to bind it.  Otherwise, ti would be too difficult to scoop onto the bread.

This was so delicious!  I added olive oil when mixing the ingredients and used about half the onions.  Also, I used regular tomatos but Roma tomatos would have saved some time.  This was soooo great though!  Big hit!

I have tried many recipes bruschetta and I would have to say that Angel's is THE BEST and THE YUMMIEST!  I have used this for MANY gatherings at my home and EVERYONE has raved about how good this tastes.  The best part is they all think I'm a magician in the kitchen!

I found this difficult to put together.  The topping didn't want to stay on the bread.  Then when there were some left the melted, dried cheese looked disgusting :(

This bruschetta recipe seemed almost authentic but very easy!  I've been told that an authentic bruschetta calls for fresh basil leaves and that's what I used.  I also used a teaspoon of dried italian spices (which included oregano and dried basil and a bunch of other spices) because that's all I had on hand.  The mixture turned out wonderdful and even better the next day to make some more!  Thx Robyne!

Bruschetta was on the menu request for my daughter's 22nd birthday get together.  This was the first one I saw.  It was a hit!  I changed how I toasted the  bread by brushing it with olive oil before putting in the oven, as another rater mentioned.  I mixed up the ingredients for the topping (minus the cheese) and put them in the fridge to steep overnight.  Someone else set the food out the next evening, and set the bowl of topping next to the toasted bread, and that's how everyone ate it: spooned onto the toasted bread.  So, the individual slices never made it to the oven with the cheese topping, and the tomato topping and the bread disappeared as fast as the mini cheesecakes from this site did.  My daughter has asked that I provide bruschetta as a snack next time she invites friends to eat.

DELICIOUS!!! I added 2 extra garlic cloves to suit my taste (Very, very garlicy!)
and finely chopped a red onion. I also added a little olive oil, balsamic vinager and lemon juice.  Shredded cheese melts much better than slices.

Great bruschetta recipe.  Very simple.  I used shredded mozzarella on top and baked it a bit longer.  I also added some balsamic vinegar because some of the other people did, but next time I think I'll go without.

This was a great base recipe.  I used about 9 green onions, tops included. And I used fresh basil and oregano.  I also spread olive oil on the bread before the first baking.

Great Tomato Topping.  If you would like to use this at a casual party, toast the bread as directed, but do not top.  Set the table with toasted bread, tomato mixture, shredded parmesan and a cut clove of garlic.  Allow guests to rub the toast with garlic and top with room temp tomato mixture and sprinkle with cheese.  Fun!

Outstanding!  The only change I made was to shortcut the tomatoes by using canned instead of chopping fresh.  I have made this 2 times now in 2 weeks, because I enjoy it so much!  Angel, you were right...this is some YUMMY bruschetta!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

This is the best recipe I have found for bruschetta.  I spread olive oil on the bread and bake for 5 minutes before adding the tomato mix.  I also use red onion.  I have passed this recipe to all my friends.

I've never made bruschetta before--this was quick and easy!  I read other reviews and also added a touch of olive oil and red wine vinegar.  I made two batches--first one according to the recipe--the second one I broiled the bread first and then added the ingredients and broiled again--I didn't like it as much as the preparation the recipe calls for.  Thanks!

This was ok.  As long as their are left overs, I'll probably finish making the rest.  But unless I can make a little bit better flavor to it, I don't plan on making this again.

Definitely yummy! I used a baguette which had to be baked so the bread was a little crisp but slightly soft in middle. Added some basalmic vingear to top.

Turned out great. Did put it under the broiler though to crisp up the baguette bread. I added a dash of balsamic vinegar to the tomato mixture. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. I also added some olive oil after dressing the baguette before putting the cheese on top.

I made this twice in two days. My hubby loved it. The second time I drizzled olive oil on the bread and added some balsamic vinegar to the tomato mixture. It's delicious both ways.

Although we liked this one, it wasn't like the Bruschetta that we had at a resturant.  I will make it again but I think I will add olive oil and eliminate the toasting of the bread next time.

Excellent. I used dried basil and dried oregano and I had to substitute a dense small white load of bread for the baguette.  I did brush olive oil onto one side of the bread before I toasted it.  I served the bruschetta with Whole Yellow Pea Soup (by Lori on this site) and everyone loved it. Both teenagers and my husband were trying to think of other times to serve the bruschetta.  We plan on trying the recipe modified to toast on the BBQ on a summer afternoon.

I don't double bake the bread, I like it a little soft in the middle, so I just broil it until the cheese melts. It still gets crispy. I also add parmesan cheese with it.

A good recipe and close to how I prepare mine except 1)I drizzle both sides of the bread with olive oil. Toasting beforehand is optional, as it still comes out nice and crusty. 2)After I put on the fresh mozzarella I drizzle some balsamic vinegar on top of each piece before baking. I first experienced this at a local Italian resturant and tried it at home with great results.

great recipe! The only thing I changed is that I added extra garlic (I like a lot of zip) and added a little bit of olive oil to the bread before spooning the mixture on. Otherwise... Awsome!

I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  It was all gone!  So easy to make ahead and just pop in the oven right before serving.  I added a dash of red vinegar and olive oil to give it some more flavor.

Very easy to make and a good flavor. Made two batches, the first per recipe, the second I added a splash of balsamic vinegar.

Wonderful Bruschetta..... It's great to do when hosting a small party.  Two minor changes I did to this recipe is that I added two tablespoons of olive oil with the mixture because it was too dry and I used the grill instead of the oven. , this way you dont need to pre-heat and you get finished faster.

This recipe is so quick & easy and delicious. It was the hit of the party. I added garlic butter to the bread when toasting, and it turned out wonderful.

This was very good.  It does need just a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The nice thing is that you can vary the amount of onion, fresh herbs, etc to suit your tastes.  It is a very versatile recipe.  Every last piece was eaten off the plate and people were asking for more.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We served this at a party recently and it was gone before we could even get out of the kitchen.  The only thing we added was a little balsamic vinegar for an extra kick.

DEEEElicious! and so easy.  I used unsliced scali bread and cut in long wise in half; next time I'll scoop more bread out so the ingredients are "in" the bread.  Also, I used mozzarella slices but next time will do shredded as I think it'll melt better and easier.

Tasty! I added fresh parsley and used a shredded blend of Italian cheeses because that's what I had on hand. Skipped the onion out of personal preference. Thanks! :)

I brushed olive oil on the bread before putting it in the oven for the first time. That created a nice base for the topping. In my opinion, this is not quite as good as Ali's Amazing Bruschetta, which has become my default bruschetta recipe for several years, but it is suprisingly good, definitely five stars.

These are fantastic! I used homemade french baguettes (from this site) and tomatoes I bought at a little farmer's market stand and these were so yummy! I don't like raw onion much, so I did omit that and added a few shakes of my Tastefully Simple Onion Onion seasoning instead. I also taste tested after combining the tomatoes and seasonings and added a bit more basil and garlic for my taste. This was super simple, beautiful and so fresh tasting. Great appetizer!

Fabulous! I marinated the tomato mix in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before making and the only other change I made was to put the cheese on the bread and the tomato on top for company who didn't like much tomato.  Tasted wonderful and so easy to make.

To add a more savory flavor add a bit of sun dried tomato to the mix. I also add a little lemon juice for a little zest. Let the tomato and basil mixture set in the fridge for about 30 min for a fuller flavor.

This was delicious, but I modified it quite a bit (almost a whole new recipe). I highly suggest the following.....
to the mixture add some olive oil, basalmic vinegar, and parmesan cheese. With these changes it is simply out of this world. For a change of pace, try red onion instead of white.

This didn't really do it for me, it was very bland.  Some fresh basil and maybe a little balsamic vinegar would punch it up a little.  Currently, most of what I taste is onion and tomato, which I like, but the other flavors just aren't there.

This was delicious, really very tasty.  However, it didn't do very well as an appetizer for a party since it was sitting out on a tray and didn't get eaten right away, therefore turning cold and the bread a little mushy.  I'd make it again for a little dinner party, just not a buffet item.

This recipe is quick and easy. It's great for dinner parties.  I usually prepare the brushetta ahead of time and then keep it in the fridge.  When my guests come over and are ready for appetizers, I pop them in the oven.  They are done so fast and yet they are so elegant.

Omitted onions and only used about 3 oz of skim mozzarella, and then stirred in about 1/2 tbs of olive oil.  So easy and yummy!! A new staple recipe for my household.

This tasted just like the bruschetta in a small Italian restaurant near my home! It is absolutely marvelous-never any left!  It is also very easy to make-I mix the cheese into the tomato mix right before I put it in the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I agree with another reviewer that this needs olive oil. I added several sun dried tomatoes & oil out of the jar. Also added Parmesan. Thanks for a wonderful dip!

My first time making bruschetta.  Very easy and went over great for my fiance.  Made it as an appetizer with some wine before we sat down to some other great recipes that I got from here.  He was impressed.

Excellent - a big hit with everyone!  Only thing I changed was to use fresh basil confetti.  Will make this often!

I made this ahead for a party a few months ago, and it was buffet style so I toast slices of french baguette bread and served the bruchetta mix seperate with grated romano cheese for topping with.  That way the bread does not get soggy and people can serve themselves.  It was a huge hit!!  I add a lot more garlic.

This is easy, but I found it somewhat bland for our tastes. I added more oregano and basil, and also added parmesan to the topping.  Thought it was better on untoasted bread than crostini.

Must change. Sorry. Toast the bread with butter& olive oil. Here's the key... FRESH basil and drizzle with basic glaze. You'll never eat it any other way once you've had it this way. ;)

As is, the recipe is ok. I made the tomato mixture liked stated and served with Fabulous French Loaves. It was fine but missing a lot of flavor. My older and pickier daughter liked it this way, hence the 4 stars and not 3. After tasting it as is, I added whole slices of sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, capers, splashes of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Definitely better than the original but far from the same taste. I will probably use as a base recipe for quick bruschetta and add extra ingredients to suit my younger daughter and me.
