My 13 year old Beagle has been going through chemo since last August.  I was feeding him only chicken, rice, and vegetables mixed together, but he barely ate the rice or vegetables.  With this recipe, he eats everything.  I'll make it with ground chicken or turkey next time, so he can have both red and white meat.  Thank you very much!

We make this all the time. I add liver that I chop into fine bits and we make it in 9x13 pans instead of muffin pans then cut it into squares and mix it in with dry dog food. It's time consuming to make and makes alot, but we just freeze it and it lasts for weeks and weeks.

Great recipe. I found ground turkey to be less expensive than ground beef and my dog loves it. I made most of this in loaf pans -- just like meat loaf -- and use a slab of it as a serving. This is the first time my dog has ever eaten everything in her bowl.

I have been making homemade dog food from a recipe I developed about 2 years ago.  The results to my dogs health have been fabulous and unexpected by me.  I think this recipe is great, however I used ground turkey instead of the beef and cooked the brown rice with a homemade broth. I think if you wanted you could also add different vegetables. My recipe is one I cook on the stovetop, but I liked the idea of individual cakes. My recipe also includes all of the ingredients here, except I use sweet potatoes.  My dogs loved this one as a change from their regular food. One of the great things about a homemade diet is you don't have to be so careful to wean the dogs on or off their standard food.  My dogs digestive systems are so healthy that they never seem to have upset tummies.

My old Belgian Sheepdog is now going through chemotherapy and this recipe has literally saved his life. He eats it with absolute relish and it has kept his energy level up despite what he is going through. All I can say is WOW!

I added some chopped garlic and ginger to the water for the rice, then added some chopped brocolli to the recipe. My hubbie came into the kitchen as they were cooling, took a taste and announced he really liked what I made for dinner.  Now my hubbie is begging for the dogs food...move over roover!

The recipe is misleading when it says to use a large bowl... I used one of those big metal bowls (the ones that everyone has, you know the ones), and had to make half at a time and even then it just barely fit without spilling raw meat all over the counter. Also, it took way more than 2 hours... I'm going into my 4th hour as I type, because I've been baking 18 at a time and the last should be the 4th batch. Maybe its the size of my pans. 

Great recipe though. This is just a fair warning since no one else has mentioned it. Just make sure you have a lot of time and patience, or even just cut the recipe in half. 

I'll be feeding this to the new puppy I'm getting tomorrow!! 1-2 a day mixed with kibble should do it. Hope she likes it!!

My dog recently had surgery and had to have a bunch of teeth removed, so I made her a batch of these and she absolutely loves them.  I made some smaller ones in the mini muffin tins and they're so perfect for treats!

My dog absolutely loves these.  She knows as soon as I pull out the muffin tins, that I will be making her favorite food.  I make half the recipe and that produces 18 large muffins.  I freeze in 2's and give her 1 /day.  Her other feedings consist of her dry food.  I only defrost 2 in the frig at a time, to keep them really fresh.  Takes about a day to defrost.  Great recipe...thanks.

My dog has a rice intolerance, so I just replaced the rice with quinoa.  He loved it.  What dog is not going to love a meat patty though.

My chihuahua LOVES this recipe. I used ground turkey and any vegetables I had on hand. It is a little dry, but gravy helps. My dog wants to eat it so fast that she chokes on it because she won't stop long enough to take a drink!

I didn't try them myself, but my dogs certainly liked these. I didn't have celery, so I added extra carrot and potato. I wasn't certain what was meant by "large" muffin tins. I have one six-compartment tin that makes really BIG muffins, but that seemed too large. I only made 1/3 of the recipe since I had just under 2 lbs of beef to use. That amount of mixture made 24 meat cakes.

Wonderful and easy to make. Very easy to alter and adjust. I use whatever meat is on sale and switch up the veggies with each batch. My cats were jealous so I altered it again to have more meat and added cat supplements and make theirs in mini muffin pans for a nice healthy addition to their kibble.

A word- if you're going to switch out ingredients make sure you aren't using anything dangerous to pets. My dogs digestive system seems much better these days, and her weight and coat are great too!

I changed the potatoes to sweet potatoes, dropped the carrots, used spinach instead and added a couple of apples. I just wanted a bit more nutrition. I also grind egg shells to add calcium, a much needed nutrient for dogs. I have added berries, squash, beans , millet, and flax seed for substitutes as well. You can use what ever a person is comfortable with as long as it is dog friendly! I have even cut back on the hamburger and added tofu! But the overall concept is excellent! I also found it easier to make into patties and use cookie sheets.

I swear I have the pickiest dog in the world.  We have tried about 5 different kinds of high end dog food and ended up throwing most of it away.  But she LOVES these.  She's just a little thing (about 10 lbs) so we give her half a cake twice a day.  She is now a card carrying member of the Clean Plate Club!

Small changes.  Made the recipe for 48.  Modifications -  Eliminated salt, shredded enough carrots, zucchini, and white potato to equal more than four cups, used maybe 6 or more celery stickes, reduced my ground beef to six pounds, added four cloves of garlic, about 1/2 cup more of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of rice.  I would also recommend eliminating the olive oil -meat contains plenty of fat already. Used two 8"x13" pans and two cookie sheets and patted the recipe out to about 1/2".
The end results were more like brownies in size and I got about 24 per pan.
My Danes, well, except for one, devoured their juicy meat brownies.
The one who was the least interested wanted to make sure the others realized he had some left and savored each bite that was hand fed.  
Overall this was a savory treat enjoyed by each of my puppers.

I decided to try this for my year old Jack Russell.  Before, I was feeding her dry kibble mixed with a little wet food and she liked it, but after eating, she would get sick.  I made this recipe last week, and cut the recipe in half because I wasn't sure if she'd eat it.  I added pound of chicken livers and used 2 lbs. of ground turkey instead of beef.  I mixed it with her dry kibble to begin with, and she would push all of her kibble out of the bowl and just eat the homemade food.  She loves this food!  She hasn't been sick since starting this diet.  I was dog sitting for my mother last week and put down some dry kibble for the Japenese Chin.  My dog wouldn't touch it!  I will never buy dog food again!  She seems so much healthier now!  I'm so glad I tried this!  Thanks to all the reviewers, because of what they said, I was convinced to try it.

2 months ago I adopted a dog. She appeared to be a little underweight and would barely eat the kibble her foster home had been giving her.  I tried out this recipe and it was like night and day!  She is no longer underweight and really appears to enjoy this food.  The only problem I see is that it is quite dry and soft, so my dog eats it too quickly, almost choking on it.  I add either unsweetened applesauce or plain yogurt so that my dog has to eat it slower (plus both are good for dogs).  I also add a vitamin supplement to her daily meals for balance.  I also make it in pans rather than muffin tins, as its less of a hassle to me during baking, then I just chop it up and freeze it! Using a food processor makes it even easier.

I have been using this recipe minus the celery with ground turkey for my dogs.  I like the tip below to use a homemade broth for the brown rice and sweet potatoes instead of white.  Will have to change up this recipe a bit

Ok so I didn't have this much ground beef and my dogs are spoiled so I used what I had in the freezer which was sausage n beef cubes.  I cut the cubes up in small pieces and made the recipe as called for.  My very spoiled beagles loved it.  The only other change I made was I don't have this many muffin tins so I used a bread pan and made it like a meatloaf.  I will cut off a slab for each of the dogs.  Dogs went nuts for it.  Not sure if they will ever go back to dog food.

This recipe is great. I grow our own vegetables and enjoy being able to fix them for our new pocket beagle puppy as well. I search out the reduced for quick sale section at the meat counter and have gotten some really great deals on ground turkey or chicken as well as the ground beef to use in this recipe. I even found some muffin tins at a yard sale to use and cook up a huge batch all at once. Once they are cooled I just bag them up and toss them in the freezer so I can just grab one and defrost it up to serve up a nice warm breakfast for her in the morning with her dry food. She comes running now when she hears the microwave.

This is a a great recipe!  First, I just wanted to see if our 2 dogs liked it, and second, I was amazed how much cheaper it is than the store-bought kind.  Thanks Shelley..

My 7year old Lab and my 1 year old MinPin both love this...I add dry kibble to the big dog's meal.  I used large package of chicken thighs (boiled), instead of ground meat.Also, just left whole from pan, and break off what I want per meal (also froze some).

I have not tried this recipe, but I have been making my cockerspaniel 
food like this for years.  I have never used eggs to hold it together.  I use either ground turkey or beef or chicken, and mix rice, and any vegetables I have; brocolli, cauflower, carrots, peas, green beens usually. I cook my rice in chicken broth, mix all of the above together and weigh it out to a serving, and freeze in individual freezer bags.  He actually likes the chicken or turkey better than the ground beef.  I like the idea of the eggs, and either the 9x13 pan or muffin tins, and I will try it. Thanks.

My two labs licked their bowls clean with this one!  I made little meat loaves instead of using the muffin tins, and then froze the loaves in freezer bags, 4 per bag.  Definitely be prepared to use two bowls since I also used a gargantuan bowl and still needed to half the batch.  Two weeks plus worth of dinners - DONE!

This recipe would be perfect if not for the ground beef. Never feed your dog regular ground beef.  You must use extra lean. A high fat content is bad for the intestinal track. Causes cramping, twisted intestines and/or diarrhea!

Very easy to make but next time I will cut the ingredients in half. I made it for my rotties 11th bday as a cake and it was perfect! He and my two other dogs swallowed it up! They love the left overs too. I'm just adding some in their dog food until it's done. Very healthy and again, they loved it!

YUMMY.  I was looking for a healthy treat for my puppies.  Not only did they love them but so did I.  Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe! More importantly my dogs do too. My shih tzu had all but stopped eating store bought dog food and wouldn't get out of bed in the morning. Now he bounds downstairs ready to eat!  I also substitute ground turkey and works perfectly!

My dog is crazy about them, however I thought they took along time to make, and the meat sticks to the pan.

We live on a farm and always have an abundance of ground meat!  I made these exactly as the recipe stated, and both of the dogs absolutely loved them!  I'm also going to try in replacing the white potatoes with sweet potatoes, since the dog food I'm presently buying has them in it and both dogs like it.  THANKS for a great recipe!

Started making dog treats a few months ago when we took in another foster dog.  Was hesitant over this recipe as I can't cook decent rice for my own family let alone the dogs.  But this recipe is so easy to make the all four dogs (two mine, two fostered) love them.  Well worth the effort.

I had to modify a little only because of ingredients on hand. I used 2 lbs meat to make 1 loaf pan full. Ground 1 potato, 1 celery, and 3/4 cup frozen mixed veggies in my Ninja. Added the oats and used flax seed oil. I did not use eggs only because my dog does not like them. Baked 50 min. @ 400. He is a picky eater but did eat this for breakfast instead of letting it sit in the bowl all day.

So good I would eat it myself. I substituted garlic powder for salt and sweet potato for regular potatoes. I put the veggies in my food processor to make digestible. I mixed the veggies with the eggs meat and rice. As per another review I used 2 - 9x13 pans and after patting in the mixture I sprinkled on top ground egg shells for calcium and sprinkled some nutritional yeast for added vitamins. My 6 month old puppy who was not eating the very expensive dry dog food I was feeding him just loves this recipe. The 2 9x13 pans make 24 servings. And by my estimate the cost per serving is about $1.25.

Made these last night.  Great recipe and you can use whatever you have on hand or your dogs loves.  I did use ground turkey and instead of the celery I put some cheese in as I didn't have any celery on hand.  I mixed a half of one in each of my dogs kibble and they gobbled it up.  They thank you for this yummy recipe.

We've been so concerned about our little pomeranian and his dry skin. I started looking for some alternate diet. It's too soon to know if it is going to help his skin issues but he sure does love love love it! I did substitute ground turkey and added a couple apples. Just put all the vegetables and fruit in the food processor and made quick work of chopping it up. Didn't have muffin pans so just put it all in a large casserole dish and baked it. Cut up into serving size pieces after it had cooled and set them on a cookie sheet in the freezer to freeze individually. Threw all the frozen pieces in a couple ziploc bags and just take out what I need each day. Adding 1/2t of UltraOil to it, (he only weighs 5lbs) and keeping my fingers crossed this will give him some relief! I am surprised how much he loves this recipe!Thanks Shelly for sharing!

My husband is an avid hunter so I made these with a ground goose and venison mixture. everything else was the same. I baked them in mini muffin pans per someone elses' comment. My Jack Russell baby LOVES them! the next time I did add about 1 cup of flour , spread them out very thin on a jelly roll pan and made little snack crackers for treats.

My old chihuahua who turns to 19 years old next year loves this recipe. He eats everything except for chicken due to food allergy.  I don't have brown rice. I used barley, frozen hash brown and mixed vegetable.  It made it healthy and nutritious.

My Yorkies love this. I use sweet potatoes instead of russets, and add no salt chicken bouillon to the rice. They especially like it when I toss in some spinach, green peas, or green beans. I toss everything in the stand mixer, so it's very easy. I bake in small muffin tins, and have had to reduce the cook time to around 20-30 minutes. This is a go to for us!
