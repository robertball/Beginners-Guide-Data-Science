These are so good!  Barely out of the oven, and I have tasted them a half a dozen times.  I did double the batch, along with adding a few pine nuts and hazel nuts.  I used 3 egg whites with 3 tsps. of vanilla, along with 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar and white sugar, 1/2 tsp. of salt, 2 tsps. of cinnamon, 2 tsps. of chili powder, and a heaping tsp. of cayenne.  Such an easy recipe, and the next time I make this, I will quadruple the amount so there will be enough to share.

First time making anything like this. Had some unroasted unsalted almonds that were sitting around so decided to kick them up to make them more appealing. At the advice of the other reviews did less sugar and also added a pinch of smoked paprika. Turned out great, the whole family loved them. Just a little hint is that I wasn't sure they were done cuz they were still sticky/gooey, but after giving them a little extra time just decided to pull them out and when they cooled the coating dried up nicely. So may appear to still be sticky/gooey after the hour, but when cooled will be fine.

I made a third of this recipe to see how I'd like it, and I will make some more.  The directions are very easy to follow, and the nuts turn out just like you think--evenly coated with the mixture.  You could easily change out the seasonings in the sugar, and I'm thinking I'd like a little cayenne to accompany the flavors next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

My first batch turned out good but not spicy enough.  My second batch was sweet and it wasn't until you finished chewing and swallowed before the spicyness hit.  They were goooood.  I making my third batch now. 
If almonds weren't so stinkin expensive I'd make more!!! They are very high in protein and nutritious (or at least in my mind they're nutritious :-)... great snack tho.

Way too much sugar!  I reduced it to 1/4 white and 1/4 brown and it was still sweet.  Maybe it would have been better with more salt too to balance the sugar taste.

I made this recipe for gifts for pastor and a teacher.  Pastor's wife told me they were great; their kids enjoyed them too and asked for recipe.  I did it exactly as listed. There didn't seem to be much spice though.  I think I saw somewhere you can add cayenne pepper?  I may try that next time. Linda

This recipe came out great! I used peanuts & almonds and cut both the sugars in half and added a bit more chili powder for more kick though.

Sooooo addicting! Don't make these unless you have a lot of people to share with because you won't be able to stop eating them! I agree with other reviewers that you should cut back the sugar.

Easy to make but lacked spice.  I did cut the sugar in half which was perfect and I added paprika for some kick, but there was no kick.  Next time I will double the chili powder, add cayenne and some paprika too.  It's still good, just not great

These are AMAZING! My husband and kids just attacked these!. The first batch I made was all almonds and a handful of Pecans. The 2nd batch- I mixed almonds, cashews, and pecans. I added a tad more salt, and used half a tsp regular chili powder and half a tsp of Hot chili powder. So good!

These were a big hit!! I made them and gave them as gifts.   Also put them out Christmas Eve and everyone loved them!  The only change I made was I cut the sugar in half.  Next time I would probably also add more chili powder, but they were really good nonetheless.

I thought these turned out great! I doubled all the ingredients and used a heaping 1/2 tsp of the cayenne instead of the chili powder.  Gave the nuts a little more heat but definitely didn't over power them...just a little heat at the end.

Can I add fresh rosemary to make it more savory? Will it burn? Maybe leave out the cinnamon? I had dine almonds like this & vowed I would figure out how to make them at home.

After reading many reviews, I made a few changes, but the basic recipe is really good.  
I used 4 cups of nuts, (nothing to drain but everything was well coated), I used 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Kept everything else the same.  The extra salt and spice balanced out the sugar.  These were such a hit.

Good flavor! I made a couple changes based on other reviews. I added the spices to the sugar water mixture and then tossed them together. I like a little more spice so will up the spices a bit next time but definitely a recipe I’ll make again.

Good flavour.  I mixed the sugar and seasonings in an empty bread bag, and shook them together.  I added the drained almonds and shook again.  I also lined the pan with parchment paper.  Quick and easy.

Changed it up a bit.   Less sugar, added cocoa powder, a bit more cayenne (not chili powder) and touch more salt.

WINNER!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar in half.  I added more spices (paprika and cayenne pepper) because we like the heat.  It didn’t deliver as I had hoped, but they were okay, not extraordinary.

They were a big hit with all of my family, old and young. I didn't get the bite of the chili powder but I may need to buy new spices. They were delicious nevertheless, and my family is very picky.

I followed the advice of the first reviewer and decreased the sugar.  I started with salted almonds so I left out the salt.  I used the spices and quantities suggested by the first review.  I made 2 triple batches and distributed them as party favors and they disappeared.

This was simple and delicious! They were a big hit over the holidays. I loved the recipe just as it was for gifting or taking to a gathering. If I make it for just at home I would add more cayenne.

I cut the sugar in half and it worked very well. I will now experiment with different seasoning blends. Excellent homemade gift idea and party snack.
