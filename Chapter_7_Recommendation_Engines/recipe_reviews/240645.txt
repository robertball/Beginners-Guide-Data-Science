My grandmother made these for years just at Christmas though pecans are pricey. Since she has passed on me and my sisters now make them, I give portions out in special containers that they can keep for Christmas gifts! People beg for them every year lol they are a HUGE hit!!! One thing try only baking them at 270 for about an hour, stir every 15 mins so the nuts will not stick or burn, this works much better in my opinion.

Many of the pecans burned on the bottom in the last 5 to 7 minutes. Next time I’ll try lowering the temp from 325 to 300 for the last 10 minutes.

325 for 25 minutes gave me burnt tasting pecans.  200 for 50 minutes gave me much better results.

I made many batches this holiday season and the recipe is a consistent winner  every time.  I stir the nuts every 15 minutes as directed, and add an extra 15 minutes to make the nuts extra crisp.  The end result is they remain fresh and crisp for a longer period of time. I highly recommend for all baking skill levels.

I made these last night to include in a couple of Christmas gifts. The recipe was amazingly easy, and the kitchen smelled wonderfully as they baked. The finished pecans tasted great, and will now always be on my Christmas baking list. Yum!

These are delicious.  It makes a wonderful hostess gift.  I made these and put them in festive Christmas tins for gifts.  The only complaint from the recipients of these gifts is tgat they couldn’t stay out of them.

I will make again. and I might add a little more cinnamon or use a higher grade of cinnamon, but these are just about perfect.
