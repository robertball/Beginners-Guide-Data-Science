This cheesecake is very good; however, is it really 17 grams of carbs? That's really high for a keto diet.

I didn't like this dessert.  I haven't found a good keto dessert yet so it may be my taste buds.  The cocoa seems so over powering.  It is nice to have keto recipes on this website so thanks for posting.  Some people do like this just not me.  keto on....:)

Cocoa cake portion is very dry.  Too much cocoa.  Also to make brownies, I highly recommend you double  all parts of the chocolate part of the recipe EXCEPT  the cocoa. 
The cream cheese is very very tasty. I thought by combining the two would help but not a chance.

Followed recipe and it came out great! Made it in a bigger baking tray to make it thinner and go further.

I made it once and loved it! So I made it a second time doubling the ingredients to make thicker brownies!  Thanks

I followed the recipe bit didn't have Almond powder.   I improvised by chopping about 1/4 cup of Almonds very fine
