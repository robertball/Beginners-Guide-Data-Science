This is great. I added my own usual routine... some rosemary, beef broth I'm the bottom of the dish, maybe a few other things if I'm feeling it. Cooked at 500 for 20 minutes then 1 hour, then 20 more minutes after checking it. (I check it by cutting, because I don't trust using only a thermometer). Just cook it longer the more done you want it. Easy p easy and super delicious. Thanks for helping with my cook time and such :). Cooked with mashed sallys spinach mashed potatoes, a salad, and au jus gravy with mushrooms and buscuits. Crab dip for an appetizer and apple crisp for dessert.  Happy Christmas eve!

An awesome recipe, with perfect directions for a ribeye roast! Ideal for a nice hearty meal with the family.

Flyinghippy: You obviously arent competent enough to read the directions and follow them accordingly which is why your roast was garbage. Firstly, after searing it at 500 degrees, the oven temperature is supposed to drop to 325, not 375 like you posted. Secondly, the recipe calls for a roast of 4 lbs, so the cook time will need to be adjusted if your roast was smaller.  Im guessing your roast was around 3 lbs, so it only needed about 1 hour after the 20 minute searing for a rare cut. Follow the recipe closer next time for great results.

Easiest Christmas meal ever!  I combined 2tsp thyme, 1 tsp salt,  pepper, 10 cloves of garlic, and 3 tbsp of olive oil in a bowl  and poured this mixture over the roast.  I left the 10 lb rib eye roast sit at room temperature for 75 minutes.  Cooked initially for 500 degrees for 20 minutes and then 14 minutes per pound at 325 degrees.  Once internal temperature reached 137 degrees, I removed from the oven and tented it with aluminum foil for 30 minutes.

The timing and temperature here is pretty spot on. I had a 5 lb boneless ribeye roast and used some herb butter on the top of it prior to cooking. (1 stick soft butter plus fresh thyme and rosemary) sprinkled with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Came out awesome!! Served with creamy horseradish sauce found on this site (1/2 c sour cream, 3 tb horseradish, 1 tb oil) and twice baked potatoes, sautéed portobello mushrooms, steamed green beans tossed with bacon bits and sautéed onions...chocolate pots de creme for dessert. I believe we've found our New Years meal tradition!

I followed this recipe step-by-step. Mine came out extremely burnt. I noticed it was looking burnt and took it out of the 375° Oven after 35 minuets. It was extremely over done and the butter and garlic were burnt. I was using really thick ribeyes.  It was extremely over done and the butter and garlic were burnt. I was using really thick ribeyes  I will not be trying this recipe again.

Can't go wrong with simple salt and pepper seasoning.  The butter on the outside creates a "crust" (I used lots of pepper and kosher salt over the butter) once it's in the very hot oven.  
Most recipes ask you to brown the meat.  This is much easier!

Delicious recipe!  Thank you.

I have used this recipe several times now and it always turns out great! It's very easy. I did make one change and that was to use minced onion instead of garlic. Otherwise it's perfect.

Too much butter, but the cooking method was perfect - I've always made slits all over my roasts and inserted garlic (watched my grandmother do that).  And I did use about 1/2 stick of butter -- some inserted, some rubbed on.  It was delicious.  Mine was a choice cut of meat with enough fat of it's own -- maybe the extra butter recipe is needed for a lower quality rib roast?

This is the second time we've done this recipe. Both times it has turned out amazing! The first time we did it with a 4.5 lb roast, but instead of salt and pepper we did Montreal steak seasoning. Tonight was a about a 2 lb roast. This time I put the butter and garlic in the mini food processor, and again used Montreal instead of salt & pepper. We did it at 500 degrees for 15 minutes and then shut the oven off to get it to 145. EXCELLENT!! I definitely recommend getting a digital meat thermometer (I paid like $14 for this one with a probe and a wire) It has saved numerous pieces of meat.. I'm  calling this Prime Ribeye....

Fantastic and easy. After the high temp, cook 20 minutes per pound for medium rare. Let sit 20-30 minutes for juices to re-absorb.

For those EXTREMEMY stupid like flyinghippy, this recipe is for a ribeye ROAST, not steaks. The turn down temperature also is 325, not 375. So much for following the recipe precisely.

This was so easy and delicious. My picky Husband and Son really liked it and I was told we need to make this again. 
The only change I made, I added 1 tsp Thyme and 1 tsp Rosemary to the Butter and Garlic Mix. I used Kosher Salt and Coarse Black Pepper.
The searing of the Meat in 500 degrees for 20 minutes is just the perfect time. Cooked the meat as adv in 325 degree oven, only took 2 hours and we rested it about 20 min. 
I also think having set it on the counter prior to cooking for 75 minutes while fully seasoned, helped as well.
We had a 8 1/2 pound Roast and I took others advise and cut down on the butter, by using a 3/4 cup only. I also put some sliced onions under the roast and I admit, they did not make it to the table as I ate them straight out of the roasting pan.  I also basted the meat with the butter drippings a couple of times. 
Best Rib Eye Roast ever.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added quartered red potatoes placed around the roast in the pan. I had never made a roast before. This was so easy and it tasted wonderful! My husband and father-in-law loved it. I will definitely make it again.

Freaking Amazing! There are not nearly enough stars to rate this recipe! I followed the directions as written with the exception I cooked it an additional 30 minutes, due to my roast being 5.5 lbs. Poking holes did nothing to affect the juiciness of the cut. Infact, I believe it added to the moisture level. The butter does seem like alot but I put it over the entire roast, including the bottom. Yes, the butter does smoke and pop a bit but I put the roast on the lower rack and put a sheet of tin foil directly above it on the upper rack. All in all it was fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing!

Put some garlic in between the slots and rubbed melted butter all over,  seasoned with Santa Maria. It got nicely charred being at 500° but we dropped the heat and cooked for another 2 and a half hours.  Perfect!!

I followed this recipe to the letter with a few added ingredients and it came out spectacular.  First and foremost this is a recipe for a ribeye ROAST.  If you are using this guide for ribeye steaks then you need to find another guide.  2nd if your not using a roasting pan,  placing  your ROAST on top of a bed of celery will prevent overcooking and burning at the bottom.  Enjoy

This turned out really good.  I made a 5 lb. bone-in ribeye roast, cooked as directed here, except only using 1/2 c butter..  I took it out with center reading at 141 degrees, and after resting 20 mins the temp was 151.  The center was a perfect medium rare, but there was a good 1 1/4 inch around the roast that was more done.  My husband still really liked it, he's a huge prime rib fan, and while this is not prime rib, it's pretty close.  Next time I might try half the time roasting at the higher temp.  But flavor was wonderful.  Thank you for a really nice reciipe.

I've made this twice and will continue to do so.  I made only minor modifications by reducing the amount of butter (1/2 cup instead of 1 cup) and I switched up the seasonings.  
The first time I sprinkled dry Italian salad dressing mix over the buttered roast and the second time I mixed minced garlic and oregano into the softened butter then rubbed kosher salt and black pepper over the top of that and I think I enjoyed it that way more.  We used the seasoned drippings to make au jus and it was really good.
The cooking time and method were perfect.  I sliced it thin using my meat slicer so we made hot beef sandwiches with au jus and served it along with red mashed potatoes and a romaine salad.  It was fantastic

This turned out absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe for the most part. I basted only once with more of the butter/garlic mix and increased the cooking time as my ribeye roast was almost 6 pounds. I also placed onion wedges and garlic cloves in the roasting pan. If I were to do this again (and I will) I will allow the roast get close to room temperature before placing in the oven, approximately 1 hour. This will cut down cooking time and have it cook more evenly. Also, allow it to rest for at least 10-15 mins depending on the weight. Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I made the ribeye roast for Christmas dinner and mom, dad, and I really enjoyed it.  The only change I made was instead of using salt, I liberally sprinkled the garlic-buttered roast with smoky mesquite seasoning salt.  I placed a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the meat and cooked the roast to 145° F.  The roast was tender and juicy and the smoky mesquite gave it a wonderful flavor.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  The only change I made was to cut a medium onion in wedges placing them under the roast and also basted it several times with the drippings during cooking. It was delicious, my family loved it!! 

Tip: even though the garlic looked like it was burned, it did not taste burnt. The roast had a lovely crust from the butter garlic salt and pepper.

I had a 5 pound boneless rib eye roast, so I increased the sear time by 4 minutes. The roast was up to temp at 2 hours flat. I agree with the other posters who said you only need half the butter - 8 tablespoons mashed in with the garlic is plenty. A full cup of butter is a waste in my opinion. Everyone loved it and I would use this recipe again.

Just used the cooking time.  Had nearly a 10 pound roast, cut it in half, put in roaster and followed recipe.  Used an instant thermometer and took meet our when it hit 140 degrees.  Came out perfect!

This was my first time making a rib roast and it came out delicious! Used half a cup of butter and added some seasoning to my 4.8 lb roast, did as instructed on high for 20 mins, 1.5 hr at the lower temp and rested for about 25 minutes before carving. Perfect rare, medium rare throughout. I did leave the roast out for an hour prior to cooking which I believe is crucial to the doneness of any meat. Thank you for the recipe! We will repeat soon!

Awesome recipe. Maybe use a bit less butter.  I used a lot of black pepper and garlic on my rub. . My roast was much smaller so I simply adjusted the cooking time.

I did add water to the pan after the searing time at 500 degrees. I felt it was going to burn if nothing was added.

We made this for Christmas Eve, first time for this type of roast (8 pound roast). Used all ingredients as listed, first 15 mins at 450 and then at 325. Wow, we will be cooking again!!!! So easy and as my husband said, that was one of the best tasting cuts I have had. Bought it on sale, $63 on sale for $36!!!!!! Left overs for tonight!!!!!!!

Great, easy recipe. I made a couple changes in the two times I have used this recipe. I reduced butter amount to 3/4 which was more than enough. I added about 1Tbs herbs de Provence mixture ( thyme, rosemary, basil, parsley, oregano, tarragon, marjoram, lavender) to butter before spreading over roast.  I also cooked to only 140, then let sit outside of oven to finish.

MELT IN YOUR MOUTH PERFECTION
Definitely easy, delicious, and a keeper of a recipe! The directions are spot-on. Only addition I made was to also put garlic cloves into the slits made with the knife. Came out to a beautiful medium-rare...perfecto!! 

The person who had a horrible time must have used the wrong type of rib-eye and wrong heat on the oven because I followed them to a tee and it was shear perfection! I hope they try to make it again...I hate for them to miss out on this deliciousness due to errors made. 
 
Bone appetite !

I cooked it exactly how the recipe said to.  Turned out fantastic, the picture with the recipe on it does not do it justice.  Wouldn't change a thing.  It was our Christmas Eve dinner. Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli.

Made this for Christmas dinner with an 8lb bone-in ribeye roast.  We did this in a roaster vs oven.  It was fantastic.  Very flavorful and tender.   Served 12 people and everyone loved it.   I did add a little fresh rosemary to the butter mixture based on some of the reviews.  I will definitely do this again.

This was really good and easy.  The only thing I changed was the amount of butter it called for.  I only used 1 stick and there was plenty to cover the entire roast.  I also cooked mine with an internal meat thermometer to 150 degrees.  It came out wonderfully

I doubled the garlic and included a bit more butter. Even though there was a little extra at the end, it was perfect to use for a baked potato!

First time cooking and used this recipe to sear then slower cook.  Came out perfect medium rare and with a nice crust.  Was well received Christmas Day dinner and used leftovers for a follow up meal.  Believe it or not thin sliced for a upscale grilled cheese that was unbelievable!

It was excellent, my roast was in need of a little defrosting so I left it naked for the 1st 20 mins on 500 then covered with foil and kept the heat up for another 20-25 mins. I then turned down to 325 for an HR+10, rubbed down in garlic butter+ fresh thyme (I added) once again & popped back in while turning off the heat letting the roast rest as the oven cooled for about 20 mins. It was a perfect med - med/rare roast, I served with garlic mashed & corn, it was a hit I will definitely make again.

I followed the reciepe timing to the letter. 4.5Lb roast was too rare. Up the temperature to 340F for an hour and forty -five minutes. Pull it and let it rest for 15. This will produce a medium rare  result.

This was restaurant style ! I used a 5lb boneless rib eye.  I cut the roast in half.  I cut slits of 3 on each half, inserted garlic gloves, basted with melted butter, salt and pepper.  
Cooked 24 mins at 500 degrees, then lowered to 325 degrees and cooked another 50 mins. I tested it at 50 mins and internal temp was 135.  Knowing the temp will rise another 8-10 degrees  Let stand 20mins. Perfect med rare!!!!!

OMG! Best roast ever. So tender!  We are giving up steaks and this the new go-to. Simply perfect flavoring with a good cut of beef.   One tip: chill/ freeze butter mixture ahead and slice little chunky spears to put in the knife punctures.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve, it was easy, and so flavorful. Everyone loved it. I followed the instructions exactly, timing was perfect.  I made French Dips from the leftovers, perfect! Definitely save the juices for your au jus. 
It was such a hit my husband brought home another roast a couple weeks later! I added basil to the butter, perfection!
This is on my to make often list!

Good flavor, ours was a decent size roast & still pretty rare for us at temp.  I just sliced it & put them under the broiler till they were the right for us.  Very easy with good directions.  (2 hours cooking time, plus a few under the broiler)

Superb! I’ve never cooked a prime rib before and decided to give it a try yesterday for our Christmas dinner. I followed the directions in this recipe and it came out perfect! If you follow the directions you can’t go wrong!

I made this for Christmas dinner. I added fresh rosemary to the butter and garlic, and I rubbed the entire outside instead of poking holes.
I followed the roasting instructions, and at 90 minutes after reducing the heat to 375, I checked the temperature, and the roast was at exactly 145 degrees. My husband loved it was not overcooked. Will definitely make this a regular holiday meal.

This gets an easy 5 star rating. No changes needed but you can cut the butter to half if you want. I agree with others who suggested 20 minutes per pound after searing. That seems to produce the best result, even for smaller 2 pounds roasts. While the steak is wonderfully pink, I didn’t find it to be bloody. So make sure it rests appropriately (20 min max). Also, since the steak cools a bit while resting, make sure your au jus is piping hot!

I have two comments. One, it's not rocket science or anything special but it's a good basic recipe. The one thing I would change is instead of slits which allow the juices to run out, I injected the roast with beef stock and garlic. Secondly for people like Hippy who say they followed the recipe exactly but didn't, what did you expect? You roasted it at 375 when the instructions said 325 and you wonder why it was over done.

I needed a longer cook time for a personal schedule. 500F for 20 as the recipe, 100 min at 280F. Perfect result. Used Montreal seasoning not salt, thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe if you want a medium cooked roast. I wish I would have read that you like medium cooked roasts. I only take off a star for now because I have had better, but it could be that I didn't like it as much as other recipes because I prefer rare to medium rare cooked beef. I'll update it once I try it again.

Also, what would be a good method to make the outside crisper without affecting the inside temp too much? Thanks.

This turned out really good. The cooking time was off by almost an hour for me, but I'm pretty sure it was because I was cooking baked potatoes at the same time. I was so nervous about ruining an expensive piece of meat on my first try, but didn't need to be with this recipe. I will definitely use this again! Thanks!

We had a boneless ribeye roast and used a cast iron skillet to cook in.
The roast turned out fantastic,  perfectly cooked!
We will definitely use this recipe again.

Super easy, super tasty and now a family favorite!

My only changes are a decrease of softened butter to 1/2 cup and I added 2 teaspoons of crushed rosemary. The recipe came out cooked exactly as we liked it - moist and medium rare with a seared outer crust.

This will be our goto recipe for rib-eye roast.

Delicious! I had a 5 lb roast  but it seared well at about 23 minutes. Turned the heat down and cooked it to 145 - it took about 1 hr 40 minutes. The flavor is incredible. As per others, i used 1/2 cup butter and that was almost too much. My husband is not a huge beef eater, but I had to cook this roast before it was in the freezer too long. He loved it.

I had to forgo the foil since I didn't have any. I added the sea salt and the black pepper cracked. I added the sea salt and pepper first and then rubbed in the butter on the top the of Ribeye and let the garlic sit on top.

It was a awesome recipe. It was the first time I ever cooked a ribeye roast. It was a nice pink, juicy and tender. Next time I think I’ll get a little creative with some other ingredients.

Great recipe.....smaller roast, just under 3lbs....turned off oven after time noted in recipe and did not turn back on.   maybe could have gone 5 min more, but was great.   i also used Montreal Steak seasoning as another mentioned.

This was excellent.  I will always use this recipe for rib roast from now  on.  I had little trouble with rubbing the butter/garlic mixture on the roast and getting it to coat.  But it did absolutely fine in the oven.  The cooking time and temperatures were perfect.  Thank you!

We loved this recipe. Made it as is except I also only used 1/2 c butter which was plenty tasty. After slicing, I poured the juices in the bottom of the pan over the c
Slices which was excellent. I did also add some thyme and rosemary to the mix.

Only thing I didn’t do with this roast was add all the garlic.  We’re not heavy garlic lovers so I just sprinkled granulated garlic in with the melted butter.   Melt in your mouth good!  To the few who complained it was burnt, you didn’t turn down the temp to what was said in the recipe.  Will make this again!

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it turned out perfect! The simplicity of ingredients and directions was definitely what drew me to this recipe. It was my first time cooking rib eye roast and got rave reviews from my husband, mom and mom-in-law. Even the gravy was perfect, did not need to season to add flavor. The only thing I added to this recipe was rosemary rubbed all over the roast along with salt & pepper. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I've never made this before, so I was really nervous experimenting with an expensive cut of meat! But I followed the exact directions for the oven time, and it turned out Perfect! The changes I made were, I rubbed a little bit of olive oil together with the butter and I let it sit at room temperature  for about 30-40 mins. Then right before I put it in the oven, I rubbed it with salt, pepper, a little bit of thyme rosemary and oregano. It turned out a little too salty, so I will cut down on the salt next time, but overall it was so tender, juicy and Tasty!  mmm I'm about to go get seconds !

Christmas morning I didn't have garlic, so I substituted granulated garlic and added a little onion powder.  I have a question:  Did any of the negative reviewers actually use a roast?  From the descriptions, it sounds like they either used steaks or didn't use the right temperature.

I liked this recipe; I used a roast that was a bit smaller but took down the cooking time. I would use it again but would add some additional seasonings for flavor. As it was, I marinaded the roast in red wine for two days, so it was good and tender. I would have liked a bit more garlic though :)

This was awesome! I have other recipes that call for a lot of prep work, but I bought the roast on sale today and didn't have time for dry aging or marinating. I was a little dubious, but it turned out incredible!! Makes me wonder if I'll bother dry aging or marinating going forward. I did cut the butter in half because I used a 3.5 lb roast and that seemed like a lot, then seasoned it with kosher salt, pepper, thyme and parsley. I will say it cooked a lot faster than I expected so next time I will either lower the temperature to 275 rather than 325 or I might try the reverse sear method.  Everyone LOVED it and that speaks volumes in this house!!

Definitely make again. I used a rub of  rosemary and basil seasoned salt instead of just salt and pepper. Amazing! I also sautéed mushrooms on the side. Yummy!!!

I wasn't sure what to expect because I was making a ribeye roast just under 3 pounds, but it turned out perfectly! The only adjustments I made to this was I halved the butter and added a slight sprinkle of dried rosemary. Delicious!

Cooked it exactly as the recipe was written.  Good, but a little too bland for my tastes.  Will use the cooking technique again, but will add a lot more seasoning!

I made some modifications. Used Chicago Steak Seasoning and Worcestershire sauce as spices, really only used temperature settings and an electronic thermometer set at 145. Godamighty, nice meat when it was done!
