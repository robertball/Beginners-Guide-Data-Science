I'm ashamed of how long it's taken me to review this, considering how often I make the recipe.

This is perfection in hot-dip form.  

EVERYONE asks me for the recipe when I serve this at parties (and yes, I do give credit!).

The changes I make to the recipe are minimal. I up the onion to 2 tbs, I up the garlic to 2 cloves. I decrease the mustard to 1 tbs (I find it makes the dip a little too sharp with 2 tbs) and I add a big dash of hot sauce.  Not a big difference, in the grand scheme of things.

My Mother-in-Law called me from the grocery store recently because she was having difficulty finding the roasted red peppers. If you do, as well, they're usually located by either the olives and pickles or they're located by the "fancy" canned goods (like marinated mushrooms, etc), depending on the store.  

The only other note is that I can only find a 12oz jar of the roasted red peppers. I usually use most of it (scraping off any charred skin left on the peppers) and just snack on any leftovers while waiting for the dip to come out of the oven. :D

My friends and I really enjoyed this dip.  Based on previous reviews I made a few changes: used 2 tablespoons of dry minced onions, used 4 cloves cloves of minced garlic, used 2 cups of shredded monterey jack / colby jack cheese and added a half cup of shredded parmesan cheese.  I prepared the dip in two Pyrex 5 X 7" dishes and cooked them approximately 25 minutes.  I plan on making this for many upcoming parties.

I have a recipe similar to this using artichokes instead of the peppers.  The sweetness of the roasted peppers compared to the saltiness of the artichokes makes this a completely different dip however.  I added extra garlic, several chopped jalepenos, and about 1/2 c. of parmesan cheese.  The combination of sweet peppers, salty cheese, and spicy jalepenos is extraordinary!

Fabulous recipe to tinker with as you please and still have it turn out great.  I had a cheddar/jack mix, so I used that, and I used 1/2c mayo/1/2c sour cream to cut down on grease, and I didnt have dijon mustard, so I used Cleveland Stadium mustard (its a brown mustard) and my guests loved it--said it was a definite keeper. Also added a bit of horseradish, and only the 7 oz jar of peppers. Served with Frito scoops.  So, this recipe is not too sensitive--you can substitute, and it still turns out as a crowd pleaser. Very easy and quick to make, and goes over very well.  I quickly patted excess liquid from my roasted peppers to make sure there wasn't too much liquid, and it turned out excellent. Definite keeper.  Think it would go well served in bread bowl with bread pieces or with cut up pieces of bagel.  Very versatile as to type of chip/bread for dipping.

This was amazing.  I prepared it the day before and took it to a friend's house, heated it up and we devoured it.  We all loved it and I had to pass out the recipe.  I roasted my own bell peppers instead of using the jar.  I used 2 but I think 3 would have been even better.  Yummy Yummy!

Good if you like mustard-flavored mayo. I had high hopes for this b/c of the recipe's high rating and the fact that I love red peppers, but to me, the taste of this dip was nothing more than hot mayo and dijon mustard. Ick.

Everyone loved this dip - especially the teenagers!  The only changes I would make would be to use a little less mayo and more cheese.  The color was perfect for the Christmas buffet.

Two words:  DE-LISH!!!   I used lite mayo and 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was still super creamy.  One note:  don't rewarm in microwave, it will seperate.  LOVE THIS DIP!!!

This dip was very good.  I made it for a party and everyone kept telling me how good it was and asked for the recipe.  I used hot pepper jack cheese for a little spice. I served it with tortilla chips and small toasted pumpernickel bread squares  I am so glad to have found this recipe.  Thanks!

This is a solid hit - for company and family. My son keeps asking for this for dinner one of these nights... As the reviewers suggested, I added extra minced onion, 1/2 parmesan and with some reviewers saying it needed additional spice - I added a few chopped jalopenos. It was easy, fast and delicious on bagel chips from the deli section... Everyone enjoy! Thanks Doreen!

Delicious!  I used a 12-ounce jar of red peppers for a full-bodied taste.  I added half again as much garlic, onion, and dijon mustard, but my friends and I all felt this could use even more.  Perhaps due to the extra peppers?  At minimum, I will double the amount of the garlic and onion ingredients.  We all felt it was a winner!

I used one whole pepper out of a 12 oz. jar and diced it.  I used one pkg of  4 cheese mexican blend of shredded cheese  for better flavor instead of just monterey jack and only 1/2 cup mayo.  Optional, but I doubled the garlic and onion.  People loved this dip!!  Makes enough for about 14 adults.  I have no idea how this could feed 32!  It is too good to stop eating!

Very good--a hit with my friends--several went home with the recipe.  I doubled this and baked in an 11 x 7 rectangular baking dish--it took between 30-40 mins to bake.  Next time, I might  add a bit more onion & garlic.  It does need to be served warm (it has so much cheese that it starts to "set" after sitting); but you can just re-heat individual portions in the microwave.

I threw all the ingredients in the food processor to make preparation even easier. It was delicious BEFORE I put it in the oven, and sensational after; I think I ate half the pan myself. Kind of reminds me of a hot pimento cheese dip. Simple and scrumptious.

I have used this recipe for years but forgot to rate it!  Everyone loves this and it's always requested.  I replace the mayo with sour cream (I hate mayo) and it's great.  Low-fat or fat-free ingredients also work fine with this.  You can also add corn or black beans to bring it to another level of yumminess!

delicious, will definitely make it again, made it for a group of 6 people aged 30-60 and they all loved it.  Next time might add a bit of Tabasco for some spice.

This was the hit of a party I went to yesterday.  Here are my modifications:

- used Roasted Red Pepper spread in a jar
- used only 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- used mozzarella/cheddar blend
- served with sliced cucumbers as well as thin crackers
- no mustard used.

Thanks...a beautiful and delicous appetizer/dip!!!!

My girlfriends and I take a prepared 13x9 pan of this dip on our ski weekend; we pop it in the oven while we're unloading our gear and by the time we've unpacked, we have a nice tasty warm snack!  As a bonus, what we don't eat can be reheated again the next day - or in an hour!!  Also, if you like more spice, mix in some chopped fresh jalapano peppers.

minus one star for too much mustard in original recipe.  

Next time I made it, only used 1/2 tbsp mustard, and it was much better.  I replaced 1/2 of mayo with plain yogurt, which lightened it up considerably.  IMPORTANT!!! Make the dip ahead of time - if you put it together and bake right away, it is pretty bland in the beginning and too sweet - however, upon sitting, the flavors of the red pepper and garlic really develop in the finished product!

I have been making this  for years now and it is my most requested dish when visiting friends or having a get together! Several of my friends now have the recipe and make it for their own events! I usually cut down on the amount of mustard and add a bit more onion and garlic just to suit our tastes but it is wonderful when it is made as is!

Love this!! I roasted my own red peppers which I will do everytime. I used three medium sized peppers. Throw them under the broiler until charred on all sides. Remove and place under a towel for 10 minutes. Then remove all the skin, cut up and put in a 400 degree oven with some olive oil for about 20 minutes. I put everything into a food processor for easy mixing. So simple and so delicious!

I threw this together with ingredients on hand for a quick get together.  I used half sour cream and half maynoise.  I used a little less mustard.  I used granulated garlic and onion powder instead of what the recipe called for.  I also used half mozz. and cheddar.  I served it with big crunch croustini bread pieces and tortilla yips and it was definitely better with the tortilla chips.

This was a huge hit!  I made some modifications to this to suit my tastes as I don't like mayo and I like a little heat.  I also had some left over roasted garlic so I substituted that as well.  This was WONDERFUL!!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I used a 14oz jar of peppers, sour cream instead of mayo, granulated onion powder (3 pinches) since I don't like raw onions, 3/4 of a brick of pepper jack cheese, 1 head of roasted garlic, mashed and 3 big squirts of Emril's Kicked-up Horseradish mustard.  This was excellent! Has become my new "dish to bring"!!

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Everyone in my family loved this dip. I only made a couple of changes. I used fat free cream cheese, and pepper jack cheese instead of monterey. Also, if you have the time, it's totally worth it to roast your own red peppers. (drizzle on a little extra virgin olive oil and add a little crushed garlic)YUM!

Very good - was a big hit at a party.  Next time, I think I will increase the onions and cut back just a little on the cream cheese - it was a little overwhelming - hard to taste other ingredients.

Embarassing to admit, but I have woken up in the night thinking about this dip.  I have now made it several times, always just the way the recipe says.  I do cut the cream cheese into little cubes to make their distribution easier, and I just mix the whole mess up with my hands, which leads to one caveat:  if you're going to do that, take off your jewellery or you may find yourself explaining to a friend at a baby shower that no, the ring she just found in her snack does not make her the winner of some cute secret game, it just makes her an accomplice to finding the engagement ring that must also be in the dip!!  It should be noted that she STILL asked for the recipe.

This recipe was so easy and tasted so wonderful! My 5 year old son loves it as well as everyone to whom I have served it. This recipe is great for any time of year.

I made this dip for a party with one other one and this was gone before the other dip was touched!  It was just delicious and addicting.  I made it again the next day and didn't have roasted red peppers and it was still delicious!

I made this for my daughter's 5th birthday party.  All of the adults LOVED IT. I had to print several copies of the recipe for them to take home!!!!   Very easy.  I made the night before and then baked it when I needed it.  Try it, you will love it.  It is a keeper!!!
Thanks, Lisa

I had someone bring this to a party at my home and it went quickly.  I got the recipe and have made it several times since.  It is wonderful!  The only thing that I change is the mayo.  I cannot stand the stuff so I use sour cream or plain yogurt instead.

This was fantastic!  Very heavy so be be prepared to feel guilty the next day.  I turned this into a bread bowl for a friends surprise part and it was almost gone by the time the guest of honor showed up.  Will be using this again and again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent!  It makes a ton- but who cares?  It is so good, you want a lot of it!!  I ended up using a 12oz. jar of peppers and a Mexican blend of cheeses. I also added 1T horseradish to the mix, and puree'ed the whole thing in the food processor.  I brought it to an "eat-with-your-hands" dinner party and it was a huge hit.  Definitely a keeper!

Oh my oh my--this is absolutely divine! I made it for my cookie exchange and used my own roasted red peppers instead of jarred. It was a hit--and I couldn't keep my hands off it in the fridge. It was especially pretty with a vegetable platter and sesame sticks as dippers. It tasted incredible hot or cold. WOW!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!

Very easy to make and has an interesting mix of ingredients.  The recipe does make a lot of dip, so for a smaller group, the recipe can easily be cut in half.  Very enjoyable!

FANTASTIC!!! Everyone at my BUNKO party loved it...they jokingly asked for spoons...foget the chips. I followed the recipe exactly. When it came time to mix it I rolled up my sleeves and 
mixed it by hand....This is a keeper!!

I don't mean to be a fuddy duddy, but I was really disappointed with this dip. The flavor is nice - like others, I also doubled the garlic and added more minced onion. I added a bit of cayenne for a little bite. What really needed modified was the mayo. One cup of mayonnaise is WAY too much; it essentially ruined it. That much mayo made it very, very oily. The presentation was awful. If I made this again, I would cut the mayo to 1/2 c. at the most. I would possibly even skip it all together and let the cream cheese give the moisture to the recipe. I would probably add more red pepper, too. The red pepper flavor seemed to get lost. 

This is probably a nice base recipe, but it definitely needs some kick added to it and the mayo cut in half - at least. And yes, more red pepper, too.

Thanks to others, I used a little more onion and garlic. To get five stars, I think it still could have used a little more spices to liven it up a little more (although I can't say which ones). Still, pretty tasty and a nice change! Great w/ toasted bread and butter crackers.

This dip was good, but I added more onion and more garlic.  It needed a little more seasoning.  I also added some salt and pepper.  I came home with an empty bowl from the party.  I would make this again with some modifications.

This was good but as written you wouldnt be able to taste the red peppers. I used a 10oz jar (and then one ADDITIONAL red pepper I had in a jar in the fridge) I used onion poweder and garlic powder. Also, i used about 2 tablespoons of mayo...not the full cup. and i pulsed the peppers and cream cheese in a food processor to get a nice creamy smooth texture. will definately make again!

I love making dip - and so does everyone else who tastes it! It's usually one of the first appetizers to go at our parties.  A friend suggested adding lump crab meat which I haven't tried yet, but it sounds like a good idea.

I made this dip 2 times over the holidays and both times people raved!! The recipe is so easy. I added as much red peppers as looked good, I'm sure it was more than what was called for. Second time I made it I used the peppers made by vlasic rather than a fancy brand in oil and tasted no difference! This dip is also equally as good heated up in the micro the next day!

Thank you Doreen! - I had to make copies for this scrumptious dip, which I made as a surprize and put into our teacher's lounge. I even had requests from Teachers that had simply just heard about it because it was gone before they got a try! This will be my potluck choice from now on.

This was easy to put together, but the mustard flavor was a little stong.  Couldn't really pick up on some of the other flavors like the pepper or garlic.  Tasted best with tortilla chips.

I halved this for six and we cleaned the bowl!  I loved the subtle tang of the red peppers and it was so nice and creamy. I did scale the mustard back a bit.  Used Spicy Brown mustard and probably added about  1 t for the half recipe. Served it with tortilla chips and it was a big hit.  I think it would be nice served with Triscuits as well.

It was such a strong red pepper taste. It didn't really seem to mix well with the other flavors. One thing I would recommend is to eat them with tortilla chips. The saltiness of the chip was nice with the dip.

Another one of those recipes you just can't live without!  Seriously, I always look for recipes that I don't have any left overs.  I hate wasting food and more importantly money$$$. Co-workers, friends and family always express how much they love this recipe and can't wait to try it out for themselves!

Have been making this awesome dip for a couple of years now-love it!  I like that it makes a big batch so even if I take it to a small party and there is some left over it is also yummy as a cold spread the next night!  Absolutly love it goes with chips, veggies, crackers or bread!

This is my favorite dip recipe to date. I roast my own peppers and the garlic as well. I also use mozerella cheese since it's what I normally buy. I'm enjoying some right now!!!!!

This is FANTASTIC!  I made it for my marina friends, and it was gone in about 10 minutes with several asking for the recipe.  I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used Muenster and threw in a handful of shredded Colby Jack cheese.  As suggested by a few, I added some Tabasco sauce (about 3/4 tsp.), and also added a few dashes of black pepper.  I served it with crackers and slices of French bread.  As many of my friends said, this recipe is a keeper!

I made this recipe as is and received tons of compliments at a recent party. I'll definitely be making it again and might try some other raters' suggestions such as using some pepper jack cheese or adding some hot sauce.  Thanks for a great dip!

This was okay, not anything outstanding.  Great dip for those who are not fans of a ton of spice.  I was just looking for more flavor.

I get rave reviews with this recipe every time I serve it. I always do parmesan on top (not any other cheese) and broil it at the end; otherwise you won't be able to dip bread into it. Amazing dip! So easy and so much better than any store bought dips.

I have had made this quite a few times and while I am not crazy about it, I always get asked for the recipe or to make it for parties.
I add one small can green chili peppers, 1Tbl horseradish, 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream and a mexican cheese mixture. I also add a splash of hot sauce. This gives it a bit of a tangy kick but not spicy hot. 
I serve with bagel chips. 
Thanks Mary!!
Thanks Mary!!!

It really wasn't that GREAT.  It was a little bland and I ended up with a lot of leftovers.  Maybe I'll try again, but I'll a little horseradish as others have suggested.

Made this for a Christmas party and was a huge hit.  My hubby even liked it (and he's picky!).  Added horseradish and used 12 oz red peppers instead of 7.  Will make again!

Texture was thicker than I expected, but very very good. It took an additional 10 minutes in oven to brown and start bubbling around the sides. I put mixture in a round corningware dish so this may be the reason. Big hit at the Christmas party I brought this to!

I made this recipe yesterday for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner appetizer and it turned out wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't add the minced onion because I didn't have any and I used one reviwers suggestion and added 1 teaspoon of horseradish to give it a little kick. I don't know how much red pepper I added because I was using what was left from a Costco-sized jar but it was about 6 large peppers. Probably less than what the recipe called for but I thought the amount was perfect... it didn't overpower the entire dish. I served it was Fritos Scoops which was perfect as you could scoop out a lot!  This was a huge hit and is now one of my favourites. Thanks Mary!

Very disappointed....I am a roasted red pepper lover, thought for sure this would be a hit. I found it very blah...I used light mayo...could this be the reason? It just had no taste. I even used a 12 oz. jar of peppers.I made it for a block party and I came home embarrassed...no one ate it!

I used low fat cheeses and mayo and it was just as yummy. Also 1/2 the jack cheese I used had jalepenos which others suggested and is highly recommended. I also used a 12 oz jar of the red peppers because that happened to be what I had on hand. Everyone at my party loved it!! Thanks, Mary!

This dip was good but not "wow" in my opinion.  I made a couple of changes.  Instead of 1 cup of mayo (way too rich for my tastes) I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Next time I think I'll also add some Horseradish Mayo to the mix to give it a bit more flavour.  A good dip (it was gobbled up) but just needs a few tweeks I think :)

This is the best dip!  I have made it so many times and everyone always asks for the recipe.  I serve with the scoop tortilla chips as the dip is pretty thick and hearty.  Some people are hesitant to try it as the color is kind of bland but make sure you push them to try becuae they won't stop eating it!

YUM!!  The only thing that I changed was I used a 12 oz. jar of roasted red peppers (I couldn't find the 7 oz).  It turned out GREAT!  Super EASY to make!!  I tried it with tortilla chips & wheat thins.  Both were good & gave the dip a different taste each time.

I made this dip over the holidays and it was very good.  I bought the monterey jack cheese with jalepenos in it, which added a nice spicy twist.  Very easy to make and enjoy!

Very good reminds me of a fancy pimento cheese.  I added 3 minced cloves of garlic after reading other reviews, and could have added more.  I also subbed yogurt for the mayo, just to cut the fat and richness.  When I make this again, I will try pepper jack cheese, as it could have a little more spice.

This is a great dip. I had many comments of "This is so good, you'll have to givce me this recipe!" I followed others advice and put 12oz of peppers in, and of only using 1Tbsp of Dijon Mustard. I also used ultra low fat Miracle whip and low fat cream cheese and it was just fine.I used a plain Montery Jack cheese but a pepper or jalepeno cheese is what I am going to put in next time for a little extra something! Great recipe!

This was an easy and very tasty dip! I will definitely make it again and if there is any leftover, it is good on a sandwich.
In the South, though, we call this pimiento cheese!

This is absolutely outstanding -- the Dijon mustard gives it a subtle taste that most people can't figure out, but it makes them want to eat more and more.  I've made this three times in two weeks for Xmas parties, and I always come home with an empty bowl.  I've found that the roasted red peppers in olive oil taste better than the ones in water (even though you drain them).  Serve with tortilla chips, as suggested.

WONDERFUL!  I used a little more onion and garlic as previously suggested.  I also made a few revisions to cut down a LITTLE on the fat.  I reduced the amount of cheese and used 2 cups of Pepper Jack and 1/4 cup Parmasean instead of 3/4 lb. of Monterey Jack.  Using light mayo and 1/3 less fat cream cheese didn't hurt the flavor or consistency at all!  Will definitely make again!

Yummy. It makes up pretty quickly and tastes great. I served it with garlic cracker/chips from Costco. Went over very well. Serves 32 though, which I didn't realize. You might want to scale it down if you're not serving a large group.

This dip is GREAT!! I made it for my friends and they all RAVED about it and now ask if I will make it again whenever they come over.

The dip was very tasty with melba toast but it was just a bit too rich for my liking. Not red peppery compared to the cream cheese and mayonnaise. Probably wouldn't make it again.

This was a delicious dip. I think the reason some are saying it had no flavor is because I made the recipe that was printed in my Allrecipes magazine. When I came to the site to print out a copy, the recipe on this website is different than the one in the magazine. For instance the magazine recipe calls for 12 oz. of red peppers, not the 7 oz. that is on the website. There are other differences also. This is not the first recipe from the magazine that did not match the website, so just a heads up, that might be the problem with some recipes not turning out the way we want, why some reviews are 5 star & others rate it 1 star. I don't know which version is the original, 
but I do know that it is the same title & same person who submitted, but the web version is not the same as the magazine version.

This was a hit!  I only added 2 Tbs of mayo but doubled the minced onion and garlic. I used Mexican 4 cheese (2cups) and it was perfect. You really need the extra onion/garlic for taste.  Will make again!

This dip was a big hit at a party recently! I made several changes... I swapped out the mayo and used 8 oz of sour cream instead. I doubled the amount of red peppers (and would even add more next time) and added corn as well. It turned out great!

I brought this dip to a neighborhood pot luck dinner and it was a HUGE hit!  I had a 9.9 oz jar of roasted red peppers and used it all.  More peppers is better, right?  I also went with what other reviews suggested and upped the minced onions and garlic and cut back on the mustard.  I am going to make it again this weekend.  Yummy !

I must admit the first time I made this, I hadn't purchased enough Monterey Jack cheese because I thought it called for 3/4 cup, not 3/4 pound!  I ended up being short 4 oz and thought the dip was a little bland and tasted like cooked mayo.  FYI, it made a great sandwich spread!  I made it a second time, since I messed up the first time, but used sour cream instead of mayo having already learned my lesson.  I also increase the roasted red pepper for a more intense flavor, but it still wasn't all that great.  There are too many other yummy recipes out there to spend my time repairing this one!

I served it warm on the burgers and the melted colby jack was delicious!!! can't wait to serve this dip again! or make it for burgers!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!

I made this twice over the holidays and it was a great hit with everyone. I served it first with tortilla chips and the next time with baguette. I think I prefer the baguette. I couldn't find a 7 oz jar of peppers so just used 1/2 of the big jar our supermarket carries. Thanks for the recipe

This was a very well, got ingrediants on hand, and easy recipe to follow.  Rave reviews at a party but I couldn't help but feel like something was missing...I think if maybe green chillies or something spicy was added it would have been a 5 star for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!!

There is nothing to change.. this is just the best recipe and at least the 10th time I've made it exactly as the recipe states.  And if your jar of red peppers is slightly larger (12 ounces) the extra bit will work out just fine.

So easy to make and delicious.  I make the full recipe, split it in half and freeze so I'll have little something to munch on with unexpected company.  Everyone loves it!

Yum! This dip turned out really well. I made it almost exactly as written, except that I reduced the mayo and substituted half of the mustard with prepared horseradish. I agree with one of the other reviewers that tortilla chips are too salty and take away from the flavor. Nice crackers, little toasts or served in a bread bowl would be excellent!

This was a GREAT dip!!  Very easy to make and lots of flavor.  I disagree about serving with tortilla chips though - the salt in tortilla chips overpowers the flavors.  Play around with your serving choices to see what you like best :)  I made this as-is in terms of ingredients, but instead of dicing up red peppers (Which I made myself instead of buying the canned varieties), i made the entire dip in the food processor.  So instead of a chunky dip, this came out a nice creamy dip.  I was worried about the greasiness as others have mentioned, but maybe the puree helped keep that from happening?  Because I warmed it up a couple of times after inital baking and it never separated.  Two big thumbs up!

This was a very good dip. I made it for the adults at my 2 year old's birthday party. Everyone kept asking me for the recipe. The only suggestion I got was to maybe add some parmesean next time. I will definately be making this again.

I give this 3.5 stars. It was pretty good. Not fantastic, but good. I heated it, then scooped out a sweet Hawaiian bread bowl and served it in that.

I really liked this!  I made it last night for a get-together with my girlfriends, and several of them asked for the recipe.  I did sub lite sour cream for half the mayo.  For less grease.  I bet it is pretty forgiving, for instance I think you could probably use many different kinds of cheese to experiment with different flavors.  I might try with some Italian blends next time.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!!  I made it for a dinner party we hosted last night and it was very well received.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked out very well.  I took a shortcut and when I was using my food processor to grate the cheese, I also grated the onion so nobody got a chunk of onion in a bite of this relatively smooth dip.  Next time I might grind up some of the red pepper in the food processor (as well as adding the diced bits) to give the dip a more saturated red color.  In the end, really delicious and quick to throw together.

I've been making this dip for a couple of years now and my only change is to use less mayo and mustard, but we LOVE this dip!  It always gets good reviews with guests as well.

One of our favorite dips for Sunday afternoon football games. I've also served it over the holidays -- the red peppers add that burst of color I like to see at that time of year. Over time, I've decreased the mayo to 3/4 cup  and double the red peppers.  Usually use pita chips for dipping (it doesn't matter whether they're store bought or homemade!).

AMAZING! As suggested by others, I also used pepperjack cheese at it was an excellent substitution. I puree'd the roasted red peppers in the blender, with the juice from the jar - it worked out great.

I made this in advance and put it in the fridge overnight. I heated 1/4 of it in a dessert-size corning ware dish, and it took about 20 minutes to heat thru.

This was pretty good but would be better if I had pureed some of the peppers or chopped them very small to distribute better and had used a little more of them. Next time I will also add some green chilis or jalepeno to give it a kick. It was just a little bit boring as is, especially when I served it alongside a spinach/artichoke dip that had more flavor.

This recipes was very good. I did make one small change and I am glad I did... I added one can of artichoke hearts, drained & chopped, to the recipe. Next time I might add two cans. It was a perfect combination with the flavor of the red peppers, but still different than your average artichoke dip. For those of you that don't care for artichokes, I would still recommend this dip just as it is! The red peppers & jack cheese are so good together!

I've made this dip many times and it's always a hit. (I've been asked for the recipe many times too.) To make it somewhat healthier, I sometimes substitute the Monterey Jack with 1/2 a pound of skim mozzarella cheese. It still tastes great. When in a rush, I process the onion, garlic, and the peppers before mixing. Sometimes I add more garlic too. Even when I haven't let the cream cheese sit long enough and there are little unsoftened chunks, the dip is fantastic.

I made this for Easter dinner.  It turned out really good, and everyone really liked it.  Based on other reviews, I used only 3/4 cup of mayo instead of a full cup, and it was plenty.  Thanks for a great recipe, I will be using this one again!

I served this fabulous dish with pita bread at a brunch and my guests loved it. One of my guests, in particular, raved about it so much that I gave her the leftover dip as she was leaving. I knew that if it was left here, I would end up eating volumes of it and I have to watch my weight.

This was a good recipe: I kept it warm in a fondue pot, but it got a little bit gummy as the night wore on.  Overall, however, I'd say this is a recipe I would make again.

Excellent!  I made it as the recipe called for.  I bought a large round loaf of bakery white bread and cut the top and center out; had people dip the cubed up bread in the 'breadbowl.'  It was delicious.

I made this for a holiday party in December and it was the first thing to go. I loved it myself and probably would have eaten it all had I not had guests! I'm headed to a Super Bowl party this Sunday and the host asked me to make it as my bring-along appetizer. Can't wait to eat it again!

If I could put this in an IV drip and drag it around with me daily, I would...it's THAT good, people! My friends have come to expect this dip at ALL get-togethers and they stuff themselves on it to the point that they are barely hungry for dinner! We like it best served with Fritos Scoops. It is sinful, delicious cheesy goodness. GAWD BLESS YOU, MARY! :o)

Not what I expected with all the great reviews.  Good dip, but I expected more.  I prefer the classic hot artichoke dip over this.

This dip was awesome!  I made it according to the recipe with the exceptions of using the 12 oz. jar of roasted peppers in water and used Pepper Jack cheese along with the Monterey Jack cheese.

This was ridiculously easy and relatively fast, most of my ingredients were already on hand, and the taste was interesting and a big hit with adults and kids.  I served this with pita triangles and crackers, and it went over really well.  A great option because of its ease and taste.

Delicious!  I used 12 oz. roasted peppers and pepper jack cheese as others have noted, and although a few guests said the dip was a bit spicy, most of them really liked it.  It needs that kick to put it over the top!

Very rich, but very good.  A fabulous New Year's Eve treat.  It beats the heck out of the same ol' store bought French onion dip.  I can't think of anyway this recipe could be improved.  As a garlic fan, I did go with two cloves of garlic instead of one--and the extra garlic really stood out.

I made this dip last night and it tasted great! I also followed reviewers' advice to use more roasted peppers (I used the whole 12 oz. jar) and some spicy cheese (ended up using a habanero cheddar cheese I had, though not the full 3/4 of it).  I also used at least double the onion & garlic, and omitted the mustard, although I may try it with the mustard one of these days.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I love this dip and people beg me for the recipe whenever I serve it at a party.  I have completely omitted the mustard.  It is too strong and overpowers the rest of the ingredients.

On a scale of 1-5 I would rate this dip about a 7!  It is so good.  Made it tonight for a party and my guests all raved about it.  I had very little left and there were only about 10 people here. It was so easy too.  Served with blue tortilla chips and it was by far the most popular dish on the table. I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This dip is great. I've made it 4 times now, and it's been a hit every time. I spice the recipe up by adding a can of diced green chilis. Instead of serving it w/ tortilla chips, I serve it w/ the plain crostinis from Trader Joe's. If you're chopping the red peppers and grating the cheese by hand, it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to prepare.

I made this dip to take to a football "watch party" . . . GO SOONERS!!  Anyway, the dip was a hit with everyone at the party. It is very cheesy, and kind of reminds me of pimento cheese spread, only it's warm. Don't let the red peppers scare anyone off. The taste is not overwhelming, and I think they mostly just make the dip "pretty". I'll definitely be making this again.

This was okay, pretty good but not what I expected.  I expected a lot of flavor and something different tasting.  What I got was basically a baked cheese dip with a tad bit of the flavor of roasted red pepper.  This is okay, but I wouldn't make it again.

This was a big hit at my family pool party.  I also used the whole 12 oz jar and it came out great.  Since it is hatch season here I added Monterey cheeses with hatch chilies in it.  Was a great addition.  Love a little heat.   I shared the recipe with the family because you never have enough good and new dishes to bring to a party.   I will make this again.

I made this for our monthly card club get together.  They loved it!  After reading several of the reviews I decided to decrease the mustard to 1 TBS, change the cup of mayo to 1/2 a cup of mayo and 1/2 a cup of sour cream and increase the onion to 2 TBS.  I also had a 12 ounce jar of red peppers so I used the whole thing.  Everyone had seconds and cleaned the bowl.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a very easy dip to make and everyone raved about it. I did think the onion and garlic had a powerful rawness to them since you only bake this long enough to melt. I'm gonna try sauteing the onions and garlic down some before adding it to the cheese next time I make it.

A hit at all gatherings! I put it in two smaller dishes at the holidays so that it can be used at two separate occasions, such as Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  I use a bit less mustard.

I took this to a dinner party and everyone loved it!  I followed some of the changes suggested by others.  I used more roasted peppers, 1/2 the mayo, 1/2 the mustard,  I added 1/2 cup parmesan, and a splash of sriracha.  I served it with restaurant style tortilla chips.  Delish!

I don't understand the rave reviews for this! I followed the recipe; however, rather than a good combination or an enhancement of any of the ingredients, I found it to be the reverse. I hate waste, but unfortunately, that's what happened with this stuff; I threw it out.

This was a bit disappointing. Boyfriend and I both felt like it was more of a cheese dip and that it needed something… At minimum definitely needs more roasted red pepper.

Totally forgot to put in the mayo and still turned out delicious. However, while delicious, it's mainly a cheesey dip, you can hardly taste the red peppers.

After reading reviews, I cut back on the mustard-did less than a tablespoon and less mayo..perhaps 1/2 cup.  Warmed in a little crock pot and served with soft pretzels- AWESOME

I would've given this a 3 star rating but my roommate loved it, so I'm going in between :) 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard is way too much for either of our tastes, so I'd suggest cutting it back to 1. Added an extra clove of garlic. The problem I found was that I couldn't really taste the red peppers at all. It tasted ok but more like a salty cheese  dip than anything else. Saying that, my roommate thought it was great, so to each their own :) I would strongly recommend using a low-salt, non-flavoured cracker or chip for this dip. Also, I suggest draining/blotting  the red peppers with a paper towel beforehand.

Well, maybe it was the brand of roasted red peppers that I used but it didn't have much flavor. My daughter liked it but it was disappointing for me and my husband. I plan to give it one more go before I decide whether to keep it or not.

Made exactly as written. It was just OK. Way too much fat-I skimmed a half cup off the top before serving. Too much mayo flavor.

I put the roasted red peppers in the food processor. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and let the flavors sit for a few hours together. The only flavor that stuck out was the red peppers. If I make it again I would add more seasonings. Easy to make for a party. Make it your own!

A keeper! Can't give a higher rating than that! EVREYONE loved it. I used the whole 12 oz jar, used 1/2 sour cream &  1/2 mayo,  & cut the dijon in half. Next time, I'll add some parmesan to the top and add more red peppers. Will make over and over again! 7-4-16 Made again for July 4th party, and used 24 oz roasted red peppers and topped with shredded parmesan. Was even better! It was devoured, and everybody raved!

As written....this makes way too much, even if your have a crowd. Always half the recipe. Once halved I made the following modifications. 
Used 3/4 of the Monterey jack. Next time will try a sharper cheese thpugh. Replaced half the mayo with plain Greek yogurt. Doubled the onion and halved the dijon. Added a few spurts of Worcester and a few drops of tobasco.

Just okay. Made it for New Year's Eve with high expectations based on the reviews, but was somewhat disappointed. The texture was odd. Probably won't make this again.

Tasty, but way too rich for me. I'd make it again, but I would cut  the richness with some sour cream. I also found some need for more spices. I added 'roasted red pepper seasoning' (bought prepared) and extra roasted red peppers, and it was much better. I also threw in some diced scallions.

I thought this dip was amazing! The one thing that I did was to roast my own red peppers on the grill. This gave the dip a deeper pepper taste with that grill flavor also.

Excellent recipe!  I used 1/3 less fat Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Hellmann's Light Mayo to reduce calories.  It was a big hit over the holidays!  I served with crackers and light and crispy tortilla chips.  Best right out of the oven!

Good dip, used a little extra garlic, added some hot red pepper, will add more next time and maybe some jalapenos. The dip as is is very rich and a little sweet, so a little heat could be good.

I have made this dip several times for parties I have had and it has been an absolute hit!  I have been asked for the recipe by several people and it has been requested by multiple people.  Absolutely delicious.  We have also thought it would be tasty with crabmeat added to it.

This recipe is one of those recipes that transcends everyone's personal taste preferences, making it a great party/gathering crowd pleaser.  I love the simplicity of this dip and have made it many ways, but the original recipe as is, is truly superb.  Great with crackers and tortilla chips as well as homemade pita chips! 
I find as another poster stated, that teens especially, love this dip and my teens and their friends request this all the time, and let's face it, a happy teen is a really good thing!

Everyone loved this dip when I made for a get together.  I did cut the mayo to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Also, I think next time I will use Pepper Jack cheese just to give a bit more kick but that would be a personal preference. It was excellent anyway and I would recommend this dip to anyone looking for something delicious to take to a party!

so so good! If you want leftovers, you better make two batches. My husband likes to use it as a spread on his ham rolls/biscuits at Christmas. I use a little less mayo, as a cup is a lot. I sub spicy brown mustard and cheddar cheese. It's a great recipe to play around with according to you or your family's liking. ENJOY!

Made a double batch of this yesterday. Used FF and LF Cream Cheese and LF Mayo. Also doubled Onion, cut in half Dijon Mustard and added Hot Sauce as recommended by another review from AVARAH. I put mine in a small crock pot and heated in the microwave. Then took left over Mont Jack Cheese spread it on top and put in oven on broil until cheese was brown. Kept on warm in crock pot. Was a hit at the party I took it too.

I loved the flavor of this dip!  The only changes that I made was that I purreed the red peppers and I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and 10 oz package of chopped spinached. The mustard I used was horseradish mustard.  It was awesome.  Instead of cooking it in the oven, I put it in my mini crockpot.  It was great for our party.

Wow, this tasty.  I've always wanted to try a roasted red pepper dip and I'm glad I did.  This is very easy to make.  I roasted my own red peppers (2 of them), and also grilled a bit of onion before I chopped it up. I then chopped one of the peppers and pureed the other.  I also used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and used a box grater for my clove of garlic because I didn't want to accidentally have someone bite into a big chunk of garlic.  Thanks for the recipe, it a nice to try something new!

This was a big hit at the get together I attended last night.  Everyone commented on it.  I took other people's advice and used only 3/4 cup of mayo, added a sprinkle of hot sauce and crushed red pepper.  Next time I will try adding horseradish to give it real zip.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  Will go in my favorites.

Forgetable at best!
- it looked like something the cat threw up. I only added 1/2 cup of mayo. Besides that I followed the recipe. After it cooked and I tasted it I added some pepper jack cheese and siracha to try to save it. The add in's made it a little better. I wish I wouldn't have taken it to the Christmas eve party - yuck!

I thought this dip was good but very rich...You can't eat too much of it before you are satisfied. The people i served it to thought it was decent but it did not get rave reviews except from my sister.

Super simple. There were no leftovers. I felt like I could have added a little more roasted red peppers. I really like the sweetest of the red peppers. Delicious!

This was really good!  I had a craving for some cheese and since I already had wheat thins and roasted red peppers on hand I thought I'd give this a try.  I did scale the recipe way back and did improvise a bit just to make this really quick so I could have some right away.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic and dried minced onion instead of fresh onion and since I didn't have Jack on hand I used a mexcian blend.  I'll be making this at my next get-together!

This was a hit! I only used one garlic clove and was still a bit "garlicy". Looking at some of the other reviews- I would like to try this with some hot peppers next time- or a bit of hot sauce. I baked it in a crock-pot and served it with yellow corn tortilla chips- yum!

This is one of my favorite things now. The first time I made it I couldn't find red peppers so I used fresh bell and chili and cooked them in a pan. I LOVE red peppers so I used 2 large bells and one serreno chili. The second time I made it was after I moved and new grocery store has roasted red peppers, so now I'm using one jar of those, one big bell pepper and one chili. I think it tastes better, but if your not a huge fan of red peppers, probably not so much.

This was sooo delicious. I added small chunks of chicken to make it a bit heartier, but without would've still be great. Great with buttery crackers. Thanks for an awesome party dip!!

Delicious, although I think it would boost the flavor to saute the onion and garlic in about 1-2 tbsps. of butter before adding them.

Big hit! I made this tonight for a dinner party and everybody loved it including myself... I ate more than my share I have to admit. .. I used the Monterey Jack with Jalapenos for a bit of a zing ... not spicy at all just a little kick. Loved it!

I made this dip and it went over so-so.  I thought it was good but not great.  I probably won't be making this again because SEVERAL people that tried it said, "oh, it's pimiento cheese."  That took away from the dip to me.

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and all of it was gone at the end so it must have been pretty good. I agree with the other person...in the South, we call this pimento cheese.

I reallt enjoyed this dip, but I noticed some people thought it needed Something.  May i suggest grated Parmesan cheese? It always adds a flavourful depth tha t usually does the trick.

This was ok- it needed some depth to it- perhaps a complementary flavor to enhance the red pepper but I am not sure what.  It just tasted like red peppers which I really like but not in this fashion.

I get requests frequently for this dip.  It's so easy and delicious to make.  I occasionally add pepperjack instead sometimes to add a little bit of a kick.  I also double the garlic.  Also, to cut back on fat I usually use lite mayo and light cream cheese.  It's best served with corn chips.

This had a very good flavor and was pretty easy to mix up. I would have given it 5 stars, but it was quite greasy because of all of the cheese.

I thought this was only 'okay'.  I made this, the hot corn dip on this site which was rated great by our guests, and spinach dip also rated great.  This was the only leftover I had.

Very Good.  Changes I made were using a 12 oz jar of peppers instead of 7 oz, and a teaspoon each of the mustard and onion.  It was a hit!!  Next time, I will use the full amounts though.  I was asked to email the recipe to people that ate it.  Great recipe, Doreen.

EASY, DELICIOUS, and QUICK! I followed the recipe to the "T", except I left out the onions.  Everyone raved about it and gobbled it right up. I didn't think the mustard was overpowering at all.  You could probably make it with a little less mayo though.  Great recipe!

Very delicious dip!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used sweet lime juice instead of lemon juice, so I'm not sure what the taste difference would be.  It came out great and was very popular nonetheless!

Very easy and quite good - mine was a little salty, but that may have been the peppers or the cheese. I did use the hot pepper cheese, which was a nice touch. Makes a nice spread for tortillas too. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent quick and easy recipe.  It's easily thrown together with everyday ingredients.  Thanks for sharing!!  I did find that I needed to bake the recipe for approximately 40 minutes and then a few minutes under the broiler.

This is very, very good.  I doubled the onions and garlic and used pepper-jack and parmesan cheese as others suggested.  Mixed all ingredients in the food processor before transferring to a baking dish.  Everyone in my family liked it (kids and adults)---can't wait to make it again.

This was very good.  Since it makes quite a bit, I divided the recipe and put into 2 pie plates.  Our younger daughter took one to a friend's house for a sleepover, and I served the other to family visiting from out of state.  Both adults and children liked it.  I'll serve this again.

this is great! everyone loved it. I thought it was best with raw veggies. I used hot pepper cheese, I also used a 12 oz of peppers (and added a few very hot ones too) This is a keeper!

An Excellent recipe,  Easy, it's even good once it cools. I make it for every party.  It's always the first thing to disapear on the table, I always bring at least 2 copies of the recipe along with me as everyone asks for it.

I made this for a cocktail party and was pressed for time.  Realized as I was putting everything away that I had grabbed the Miracle Whip instead of the Mayo but it was still great.  Used cheddar and parm cheeses and everyone loved it...plus it was low carb.  I would definitely suggest more onion and garlic to taste.

AWESOME RECIPE!  I added some shredded parmesan cheese and replaced the other cheeses with cheddar.  I served this at our Christmas Dinner as an appetizer. Everyone LOVED it...
Thanks for sharing!
