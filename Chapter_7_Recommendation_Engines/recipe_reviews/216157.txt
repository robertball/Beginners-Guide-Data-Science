This a great basic hash brown casserole recipe!  I love that I had all the ingredients on hand.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top, since I had it anyway and it was a total hit.  I used regular milk since I didn't have half-n-half, but that's the glory of this recipe - it's versatile!

This is a pretty good basic potato recipe. Have been doing something rather similar for some time now. With that said I do a few things a bit differently. I actually cook the hash brown potatoes in a little bit of butter on top of the stove in non-stick fry pan. I don't really try to get any color on the potatoes other than just a very light brown. After the potatoes are completely cooked I add a few more ingredients. I add the half and half along with pecorino Romano cheese and spices. I use Aromat seasoning. I procede to cook the entire potato mixture in the oven for about 15 minutes. After the mixture pics up a very little bit of color on the bottom it is done. When's season properly this potato mixture is the best casserole potatoes you ever had. It is creamy and delicious. Plus it doesn't require a long amount of cooking time. So there's absolutely no way that you're going to curdle the half and half mixture.
