These were great! Quick and easy!  I used 2% milk, light cool whip, and a different brand pudding (i don't think the oz matters, just a box)  Husband loved them too!  I think next time I will use white chocloate.

EDIT::  I made this again with sugar free cheesecake mix and white chocolate and loved it!too!

It was very tasty but it tasted like pudding mixed with cool whip.   I think if you want the real mouth feel of a mousse (which this recipe says it is) you'll need to go to a recipe that calls for eggs and traditional heavy cream that you whip yourself.  However, this is a terrific shortcut.  Great for kids or large groups.
