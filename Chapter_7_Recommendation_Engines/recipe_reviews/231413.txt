Yummy in my tummy!  This salad was a hit with the whole family !  I loved the flavors that seasoned the squash against the sweetness and tartness of the the dried cranberries.  So good!  
Is anybody else annoyed by the fact that the photo doesn't match the recipe?  The photo has avocado and pomegranate in the salad.  Annoying?

Delicious when following the recipe exactly. Its also good with spinach instead of arugula, and with butternut squash with seasonings doubled. I especially like how you can make the squash and dressing ahead of time. To make the squash easier to cube, put the whole thing in the microwave for a minute or two before cutting.

This recipe was outstanding!  This is what AllRecipies is all about - getting new ideas and making things you never would have made otherwise.  

I will make this again and again trying different things to mix it up.  

I forgot to add the orange zest, but didn't feel it was lacking any flavor.  I will try it with it next time though!  I used left over acorn squash, but then mixed in the seasoning.  I also added some seeds instead of pistachios and put left over pork chops on top.  This tasted like it was from a 5 star restaurant and that hint of Indian spice was so great.

The acorn squash was a pain to peel and cut (I've read maybe you don't have to peel it--will try that next time), but this recipe was fantastic. The dressing alone was super good, but the flavors combined really nicely. The only real difference I made was use feta instead of goat cheese. I know it has a different taste, but it still worked really well in the salad.

Fantastic! I love the dressing. I added some poached chicken breast to make it a full dinner. Used a sharp white cheddar instead of goat cheese. Super easy & great flavor.

Wonderful salad! I used Romaine not Arugula and my family and friends couldn't get enough of it. I will make over and over again.

Dressing is great.  Squash is a lot of work to cut and peel and not super excited about taste for all that work.  I used pomegranates instead of dried cranberries.  Dinner group loved it.

Dressing was good, but I'd skip the squash mix was  not great.  Will definitely make the salad  again minus the squash (used butternut squash instead of acorn). Did not have apple cider vinegar, used red wine vinegar instead.

This was a combination of things that I love - goat cheese, squash, pistachios, arugula - and it was STILL better than I'd expected. Super filling, too. A really good dinner-salad.

LOVED IT! I'm not a big fan of acorn squash but I had one  that I needed to use. Searched for a recipe & so happy I found this one. I would cut the squash into 1/2 inch cubes instead of 1 inch. It took longer to cook than the recipe stated and was too large for the salad in 1 inch cubes. I added roasted beets since I had some & switched feta for the goat cheese. The dressing was THE BEST.

A really great sauce ! Quite versatile too. I replaced goat cheese with a poached egg and a slice of French baguette bread per person and it was still perfect.

Didn't have arugula, pistachios, or onion powder, so I improvised and used fresh spinach and romaine, and chopped pecans. I subbed 1/4 t garlic powder for the onion. I wasn't sure how to go about peeling the squash, so I just sliced it along its ridges and baked the slices, then sliced the skins off after it was cooked and cooled. I also just used plain feta for the cheese. It turned out fabulously, a surprisingly filling dish that everyone enjoyed!

We made this as a side to accompany a spicy chicken dish. The spices of the recipe  were both flavorful and the dressing was a bit sweet - a lovely complement.  This will be a new favorite  salad and is a great way to enjoy winter squash.

This was delicious and different, since you don't usually see squash in salad!  I lean vegan so I left off the cheese.  I also cut the amount of oil to 2TBSP of olive oil to roast the squash and then a tsp per salad.  Leaving off the cheese and some of the oil cuts the calories by more than 50 percent.  I will definitely make this again!
