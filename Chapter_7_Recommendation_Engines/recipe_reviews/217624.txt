I added a few things and my family loved it.  I sauteed onions in with the meat and mushrooms.  I also used lipton onion soup mix for the seasoning along with a can of golden mushroom soup.  Fabulous!!

Tasty, easy to make, good dish. I've made this 3 times, and will pull it out occasionally. We are always busy - and this is fairly simple to make. Thanks.

I thought this dish was rather bland, though the mushrooms (which I forgot) may have added another layer of flavor. I don't think I'd make this again.

really easy to make, a bit salty. the pork turned out tender and the rice and vegetables were perfect! overall, probably will not have it again.

I liked the look of this recipe, but the cooking method of poaching the pork did not appeal to me.  I kept to the ingredients here but changed the cooking method.  I also didn't have any pre-mixed rice blend.  I started by sauteing 1/2 cup wild rice and 2/3 cup brown rice with a bit of butter in a sauce pan until the brown rice toasted and it smelled like popcorn.  Added water and chicken base, some herbes de Provence, and let it cook for 50 min.  Meanwhile I seasoned the pork with S&P and browned it, then removed from the pan.  Added mushrooms, sauteed them and let them deglaze the pan.  Put the pork back in along with more herbes de Provence.  Lastly added a bag of frozen (thawed) Asian mixed veggies (carrots, pea pods, green beans, red bell pepper, water chestnuts, broccoli, onions and that was really nice with this) and dumped in the rice from the sauce pan.  Covered and let gently cook for 10 minutes.  I wanted to add garlic with the mushrooms, but forgot.  Regardless, this is a really nice combination of flavors and I enjoyed my dinner a lot.
