My family really enjoyed this. It didn't last long. They wanted more. Next time I will make two.

This recipe sounded most like the pie my mother-in-law used to make for us. I made it, and it was spot-on and delicious! The thin chocolate layer on bottom was thick and rich, and the rum custard on top was light and soft, with a very delicate rum flavor. We always had ours on regular pie crust, not graham cracker crust, so that's what I made. We also never used whipped cream, just a few semi-sweet chocolate shavings on top of the rum layer. This pie is plenty decadent without cream or graham cracker crust. My favorite pie - Perfect! I am new to this site, but will try to upload two pictures of the pie as I made it.
