This is by far the best tuna salad I have ever had. There is one thing that didn't work but I'm not going to knock off a star for it because the tuna mix itself is that good. The bottom side of the melt never gets toasted and you are left with a soggy piece of buttered bread. I will toast the bottom and flip it over before assembling the rest next time. I ate the leftover tuna mix without any bread the next day and I actually preferred it that way. Hands down the best tuna salad out there!
