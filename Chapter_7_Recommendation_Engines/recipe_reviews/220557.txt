LOVED THEM!!  I had a vegetarian friend over for dinner last night and made these and the whole crowd raved about them!  I was a little worried that they wouldn't have a lot of flavor but once they were grilled they had an amazing taste.  Mine were a little watery (because I used the entire package of tofu) so I added some crushed Triscuits to soak up the extra water and they turned out great.  I will make this recipe over and over again!  Thanks AmieO!

They tasted great, but fell apart on the grill. We ate grilled tofu walnut crumbles for dinner. :(

These are wonderful. I dont drink and couldnt find a single bottle of stout, so I used an IPA... I liked the texture in these.. every once in awhile, you'd get a little nugget of walnut..  I didnt  grill them  as that would be my only issue with them. They are very soft.  I cooked  in a skillet sprayed with non stick spray.   As long as you leave t em alone for 5-7 minutes to let a crust form, these should work fine.

It was decent enough, but probably not something I'd make again. There just wasn't much flavor to it, and I followed the recipe exactly as it was given.

I couldn't even bring myself to grill these :(  I am not a picky eater--I'll try just about anything, especially if I know what's in it, but these didn't even smell good.  The best thing I can say is that I was able to enjoy 1 can minus 1/2 cup of tasty refreshing Guinness instead.  Sorry AmieO
