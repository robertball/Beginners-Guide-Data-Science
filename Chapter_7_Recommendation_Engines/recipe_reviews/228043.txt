We followed the recipe on one fish but on the other fish we substituted fresh dill for the other herbs. Both were delicious and had great flavor.

I had a difficult time with this recipe. I had a large fish, and after I cooked it about 12 minutes per side, it still wasn't done. Also, I couldn't figure out how to keep all the lemons, onions, and herbs inside the fish without them falling out when I flipped it.

I ended up finishing the fish in the oven, but the things had all fallen out of it. So it tasted OK, but I'm sure it would be better if I knew how long to cook a big fish, and how to keep the stuffing inside.

This turned out great. I never grilled whole fish before, this recipe and directions were excellent. For anyone thinking about making this and reading reviews of how difficult it was because of the stuffing falling out, here is a simple solution; after stuffing I tied a piece of butchers string around it and it kept everything inside even when flipping the fish.

Delicious trout.  Ours was a bit larger than average so I increased the cook time by 1 minute each side.  The skin was charred but overall everyone was delighted with the outcome.

The second time I made this I used lemon pepper seasoning and it gave the fish a more consistent lemon flavor.  It eliminates the need to having to replace the lemon slices when you flip the fish.  I used a cast iron skillet on the stove and loosely covered the fish with foil as it cooked.  The fish was flavorful and tender with a crispy  skin.

We followed this recipe exactly using the medium-sized whole trout from Costco.  It was excellent, with a crispy delicious edible skin.   A bite of the onion with the fish was sublime!

Great flavor. I used kitchen twine to hold it together but next time I will use the same ingredients but use my usual method of cooking in which I wrap each individual fish in foil and then place it on the BBQ.

Per suggestions, added minced garlic. I also hate raw onions so I sauteed them before stuffing into the fish. This actually allowed me to stuff more onions into the fish since they were soft. I also saw people talking about the insides falling out. So I used toothpicks to hold the fish together (maybe about a total of five each fish) since I did not have butchers string. It worked like magic! Noted that skin stuck to grill so I oiled the grates before turning fire on. I also used a spatula to gently scrape the fish up. Helped tremendously!! It was very tasty.

I did it for a little longer on the bbq maybe 7-8 minutes is a better time.
Flavor was remarkable but instead of salt and pepper I used sea salt and a kind of spicy seasoning

I wrapped every achy trout in individual foil packs and also made a variation ton the usage of the herbs: I mixed a little oil, dubbed lemon juice for lemon slices, and mixed the herb mix and brushed it on the be inside of the cavities.

The trout came out almost perfect.  M y only problem is that the skin stuck to the grill and it is hard to keep all the ingredients inside the trout.  But the taste and texture was excellent and will definitely be making this recipe again.

My first time grilling whole fish and it was awesome. Rosemary flavor infused well and not too lemony. Used a fish basket to keep stuffing in.

Fish grilled up really well and picked up some of the lemon and spices. The onions I stuffed the fish with picked up a really nice flavor and tasted great as well. I would recommend this.
