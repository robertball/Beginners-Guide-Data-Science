This dip is indeed addictive.  Very rich, with a nice tangy taste.  For those, like me, who enjoy some heat, I'd add some Tobasco, and maybe a pinch of cayenne pepper.  This is a keeper.

Awesome! This is the closest I've found to my mother's homemade Pimiento Cheese recipe, which was wonderful -- but I can't find it anywhere. Hers was a bit drier and more pungent, this one is creamier and milder. Hers used green olives (like this recipe) rather than just the pimientos, and I've found it hard to get recipes using the olives, so when I stumbled across this recipe, I just had to give it a try. I did leave out the green bell pepper and used 1/3 cup green onion instead of regular onion -- and it's terrific. I did everything according to this recipe except I used a food processor to blend the cheeses and mayo together -- and then I pulsed in the rest of the ingredients -- made things a lot more simple, especially in light of how easy it is to end up with cream cheese all over your kitchen walls with a mixer. If I were to change anything, it would be to use mayo to taste/desired consistency. Otherwise, I have to say, I might like this recipe even more than my mom's b/c it's creamy and more spreadable/dip-able, and not as strong as hers was. And by the way -- this is SO much better than anything you'll buy pre-packaged at the store! Those spreads are far too sweet! FWIW, this is a wonderful recipe -- I will make it again for the upcoming holidays! (I'm thinking about adding some crumbled cooked bacon, too!)

Delicious and addictive.  I doubled the recipe and added some jalapeno's.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Suggestion: Be sure to buy the thinly shredded cheese...it mixes better.  Thanks for the recipe...I will be using this often.

The cheese I used was extra sharp white cheddar and I used red bell pepper instead of green (we don't care for green pepper). I added a teaspoon of garlic powder as well as a shake of Frank's Hot Sauce. Dude. We absolutely loved this. There was nothing left over.

The best!!!! I was a bit apprehensive when I tried this (took it to a New Year's Eve party) but it was gobbled up in no time, with so many people asking for the recipe. It's delicious on crackers, and, as the submitter said, highly addictive. ;o)

Definitely a keeper...so good and super easy.  My stoic husband said, "This is REALLY good!" and for him, that's kind of amazing. I followed the recipe except I omitted the green bell pepper and used green onions instead of regular onion.  I think a sweet bell pepper (orange, red or yellow) would have been a great alternative to the green and will try it that way next time.  And there will be a next time...

Made orgininal recipe for Christmas party and it was pretty good.  I didn't like the chunkiness factor with the celery but others did.  I made it again without celery today and really minced the onion and I like this one better.

This was a cinch to make in the food processor.  I used low fat cream cheese and it was still quite tasty.  I wasn't sure I was going to like this when I tasted it the day I made it, but an overnight in the fridge was all that was required to make this a hit in my household!

I have rated this before but wanted to add more. This is very addictive! It is delicious as written. I have made it numerous times (over 10 times). What is so wonderful about it is you can change it to suit your tastes. I have made it using the lighter cream cheese, no mayonnaise, with extra red,green,and yellow bell pepper along with green onions,the green olives and celery and it is so good! Please give this recipe a try you will be so glad you did.

This is sooo good!  I didn't put the green peppers in at all, and everyone loved it.  The second time I made it, I took out the olives, just because I'm not a huge olive fan.  Still wonderful... everyone gobbled it up with Ritz crackers!

I made this using Marzetti's Gardenera mix since I was out of green olives.  I followed the rest of the recipe using a food processor to finely chop the veggies and then added the cheeses and mayo.  Gave it a few whirls and voila... great cheese dip.  I used Ritz crackers to dip and it was perfect.  I will be making this again using the green olives next time.. but this was a great alternative too.

Made this for a cookout & everybody loved it. Some of my family is hard to please! I didn't have any celery but other than that I followed the recipe. Think I might try chopped jalapenos instead of the olives next time to give it some heat.

This was great!  I'm even not a huge fan of green olives, but I quite enjoyed it!  I used my food processor as another reviewer suggested...chopped the veggies then through in the cream cheese and cheese and let it do all the work.  It was awesome.  My boyfriend loved it!  It went great as an appetizer after having bloody mary's with our breakfast : )

I was looking for something new to make for a get together I was having, but wasn't sure with this having pimento-stuffed olives, as I don't like them.  I tried it any way...BOY was I glad!  This was very good and all of my guests raved about it!

Made this spread up and then filled sweet cherry peppers with the mixture.  Diced everything real fine to make sure it would fit without breaking the peppers.  Made a big tray full and took it to a church gathering where it was a total hit.  Many people asked for the recipe.

Used the low fat products for this and it was quite good.  The olive flavor shines through for a great spread.

Very tasty.  I made it according to the recipe but did not have fresh oregano and parsley so used 1 tsp of dried.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make so that was a plus

Well, I’m sorry to say that this was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe as written using green onions and fresh parsley instead of dried.  Although we like celery, it just didn’t seem to go well in this.  Not the best we’ve had and not the worst, but I probably won’t make it again.

Excellent.  Reminds me a lot of the garden vegetable cream cheese spread that comes in little tubs - but this is SO much better.  I added a little bit of minced onion and just a little cayenne, but it's perfectly fine the way the recipe is written.  I will definitely make this again!

SO Good!  I do leave out the peppers, as I don't like them.  Also, I replace the chopped onion with sliced green onions or finely grated white onions.   This is an oft requested dip now!

I made this just minutes ago It is wonderful!! the flavors have not had time to meld together yet and it still tastes great. I used a sharp/aged white cheddar and green onions. I made as directed except for using the lighter neufchatel cheese and a bit less mayo. It is a little on the salty side, but this is due to the green olives and the cheese I chose to use. I still LOVE IT!!!!

I make this all the time;  Thanks for the great recipe!  I don't put in the mayo and I add a splash of hot sauce.  This is really great served with multi-grain pita chips.  I don't measure anything so I do:  One large celery stalk, 3 green onions, about 3/4 of a bell pepper and a large hand full of olives.  This is really great for breakfast on a bagel, too :)  Yum!

Would have been a five star but it seemed like there were just TOO many vegetables in this. It seemed better after sitting in the fridge for a while though. I think I would have had a better first impression had I used stronger green olives. The ones I had were so mild they almost tasted like black ones, so it could just be my ingredient choice that is the problem. My guests LOVED it though, so I will keep this recipe around and continue to tweak it a bit. I added a bit of salt and freshly dried oregano. I also veganized this by using cheddar Daiya, Follow Your Heart cream cheese, and Vegenaise. The creamy base of the dip was wonderfully delicious.

This spread is very tasty.  We served it with crackers but it is just as good right out of the bowl.

This is delicious!  The first time I made it, I took it to a work party and three people asked me for the recipe.  Everyone loved it.  Let it sit for several hours or overnight to let the flavors blend together.  It seemed to get better as it sat for a while.

I made this for my Bible Study today and it was eaten up quickly. Two people insisted on the recipe, so I guided this to this site. I used a food processon to chop my veggies, so it was a little finer than yours. Next time, I will chop. Yours is prettier. It was still delicious. Thanks, Kelly.

Good dip. If your guests happen not to be fans of green olives this won't be a hit. I love green olives so I thought it was great. My hubby doesn't like them so he did not like this dip at all. I will cut back just a little on the green olives next time just so that people who don't love green olives won't be totally turned off as it has a pretty substantial green olive taste.   Love the crunch of the green peppers and celery. Thanks for a great dip

This isn't a bad recipe, but I prefer Cheese Ball III on this website.  I used a food processor instead of an electric mixer, although I just stirred in the olives (which I halved, but should have quartered).  The first time I made it I chopped the celery, onion and green pepper by hand, but thought I'd prefer them chopped finer... I'm not sure I did!  But all that chopping is a lot of work.  Cheese Ball III has less chopping and tastes better.  You could easily cut down the mayo on this recipe - I thought it was a touch loose.

We thought this was pretty good, however it seemed excessively salty.  I love olives, any maybe mine were just extra briny, but I felt this would be much better with perhaps 1/2 cup of olives, as opposed to 3/4 cup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Kelly!

I made this pretty much exactly to the recipe.  I used a red instead of green bell pepper, added a little garlic powder and finely diced my veggies.  I also shredded some sharp white cheddar.  I think using the white cheddar is important for the appearance.

Didn't have the pepper, would love to add it next time. Cut the amount of olives drastically. Next time would eliminate them entirely as every time anyone would get a bite with an olive they'd get this pinched look on their face. Used green onions. Loved it! Would definitely make again.
