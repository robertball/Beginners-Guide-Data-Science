I am not good at making these - 2 tries, 2 fails but my co worker uses this recipe so its likely my fault.  

PLEASE NOTE: toxic for dogs!  I feel it is WELL worth noting somewhere in the recipe that although this is great project for families, etc - these cookies are SUPER toxic to dogs!!  After leaving my failures on the counter in a hurry I came home to a dog who was drinking excessively & getting sick.  After googling "dog poisoning and salt dough" I had NUMEROUS results of families who were not as lucky as I and the treatment can be somewhat extreme if the dog is small and ingested a lot of salt.  I was fortunate my dog is not small, had access to plenty of water and rid her stomach of most of it's contents or it could have been very bad.  

Please consider adding this warning to the recipe - I don't want to deter anyone from making them - just feel they should know to keep away from dog's reach - even when hung on the tree.  Thank you!

Perfect and basic salt dough recipe. I know there are people who look for a recipe and want it to be perfect as is. If you are experienced with baking, you will understand that you have to add your water slowly. Your climate affects how much water goes in to dough. For example, I needed to add a bit extra, but I don’t fault the recipe. Also, as for it burning when you bake it, maybe your oven runs hotter or maybe you rolled your dough thinner than the OP, although it seems like it would be difficult to burn anything at 250 degrees. It’s always best to check a few minutes early.
Just saying, this is your basic salt dough and it is a perfectly fine recipe. Thank you OP

This turned out fantastic. I have no clue why this doesn’t have 5 stars (unless some fool leaves a poor review because they let their dog eat a SALT ornament). Honestly though, if you’re an adult that doesn’t need someone to help you wipe after the toilet, you’ll love the simplicity of this dough. Very malleable. I made some Christmas ornaments and then a hecken Shenmue sculpture.

I didn’t  add all the water, and still had to re-knead on a floured counter... dough was very sticky on the first try. Will use less water next time. The kids had fun and the ornaments came out cute!

As a substitute teacher, I used this recipe with a group of 5th graders.  Teacher left instructions (and apologies in case more was needed!); could not have been any easier.  Kids got to work on their projects and had a good time constructing with the dough.  We didn't bake it, instead we let everything air dry.  If I were to try to dry it out more quickly, I would probably put it in a warm oven after the oven was turned off!  Good luck!

I used pink Himalayan salt so it gave it a pinkish tint. Bake it for the whole time and flip or you will have darker patches. Used food coloring to change the tint. Loved it adding it to family recipe book.

Love this recipe! I have made it for a few years now and we make a special Christmas ornament for our tree. My kids love playing with the leftover dough, it makes great homemade play doh! It’s quickly becoming one of our favorite traditions! I would add though that it doesn’t need to be kneaded hardly at all. As long as the ingredients are well mixed together, you can just roll it out on a floured surface with a rolling pin and you’re good to go! It couldn’t be easier!

Great recipe and super easy will use in the future.  The thinner you make them the faster they dry!

I want to find larger cutters for my Halloween and Christmas ornaments. I'd also like to find Thanksgiving cutters. This recipe is perfect. My daughter and I have so much fun painting these.

3 hours and my ornaments are almost dry.... The bigger handprint ornaments have a long way to go.... taking way too long. I think maybe the water content in the dough is too high?
