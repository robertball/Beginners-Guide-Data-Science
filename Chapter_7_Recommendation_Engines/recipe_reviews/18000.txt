As a fan of crumpets, I was eager to try a new recipe.  Compared to some of my favorites, I found these a little salty and the batter thicker and more difficult to manage.

This filled a craving, thanks for posting!  One reviewer said these aren't really Australian, but I don't think they're intended to be, oddly enough, so hold the Vegemite.  Oroweat used to make a product like this called Australian Toaster Biscuits - who knows why the name.  But this recipe, I think, is meant to duplicate that.  Oroweat's product was discontinued years ago, but I still miss it.  The taste and texture are similar to what I remember, and I will make these again.

Too salty and did you know that there is no such thing as an Australian Toaster Biscuit in Australia?  Stick with traditional crumpets - far more authentic and available in Australia.

Tried it a couple times but it did not turn out the way I hoped it would. The texture is a bit like cake which in fact I think it should be a bit more chewy. The taste was good but the texture is not like the real thing.

Let me start off by saying that normally, I never review a recipe unless I try it unchanged.  So one cannot consider this a negative, nor even a neutral review, because I changed it from the beginning. On the other hand, what I wound up with wasn't half bad, and I'll probably make it again.  :) 

I was hoping for something that resembled the "Australian Toaster Biscuits" that Thomas' used to sell. Based on other reviews, I reduced the salt to 1.5 tsp, and added 1/4 c milk. The salt reduction wasn't enough.  I added about 3 tbsps of sugar, which overcame the salt problem.  Made the first two, and still didn't like them very much.  I'm not really a fan of sweets, but I decided I might as well just make them honest-goodness "sweet biscuits" and added an additional 1/4 c of sugar. They came out tasting pretty darned good.  Next time, however, I will reduce the salt to 1 tsp, and up the milk by an additional ounce or two.

Yum.. kind of a cross between a biscuit and a muffin. A friend gave me some fresh rosemary from his yard today so I added some of that..

This recipe could have used a little more liquid. The batter I ended up with was very thick and hard to pour into the crumpet rings.
