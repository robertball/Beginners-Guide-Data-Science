Very tasty - perfect for those who like soft/cake-like cookies. I substituted 1 cup of white chocolate chips for the nuts (personal preference).

These cookies were pretty good. There are a few changes I will make next time I make them but that is due to personal preference. I will be adding some cinnamon and nutmeg next time. I added some to the last 3rd of the batch and loved them that much more.

I like the cakey texture and the coconut in the cookie. The walnuts give a good crunch to the otherwise soft cookie. The flavor was just a little bland for me to want to make again.

The lighter texture of this cookie makes it a great change from my usual toll house cookies. I used semi-sweet chocolate as a personal preference I'm not a milk chocolate fan. I found using my cookie scoop required a little additional time in the oven. This is a delicious cookie and I'll be making these again soon.

Did not have chocolate or walnuts...but still tried this. Turned out kinda cake-like to me. I though OK but others really liked. I'm sure if I had made it as it's supposed to be with choc&nuts it would be much better.
