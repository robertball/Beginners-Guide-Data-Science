I'm not the ideal reviewer for this recipe because I couldn't use onions or peppers due to picky children.  What I did use:  7 small red potatoes -skins on and 5 eggs.  I don't think that three is enough to really bind everything together.

I cooked everything as directed and was pleased with the result.  The potatoes on the bottom layer of potatoes did get a little too brown/black so I'll turn the heat down next time.  

Overall, a good, homey recipe with cheap ingredients that cooks quickly.   A week night keeper.

This was really good for the leftover ham I had from a big family dinner.  I, like previous reviewer, don't like onions or peppers so I added minced/dry onion and peas for a little color, but next time I will add some mushrooms, that would be great; and I lowered the heat and cooked a little longer so the potatoes wouldn't burn.  But a super weeknight meal, quick and easy.

Delicious!! I changed a few itmd to speed things up a bit. I baked potatoes in microwave to get them soft (5 min. or so). I microwave bacon instead of the ham. I peeled the skin off potatoes and diced. I put small amount of butter in pan added pirates and cooked bacon that I cit into small pieces with scissors. I added onion powder, salt and pepper. I let that cook a short while, stirring often. I add the eggs and cover and cook them till set. I add the cheese and cover till cheese melts. My whole family lives this and it makes your house smell great while cooking.

I think I'll dice the potatoes next time, but this was a quick, easy and tasty dinner last night. Thanks!

This was a great solution for leftover ham. I made it just like the recipe without the pepper because I didn't have any on hand. It was wonderful anyway! Next time I'll be sure to have the pepper available. The crunchy crust of potatoes added just the texture it needed. Thanks for another addition to my recipe box!

I really enjoyed this dish for our Binner night.  (You know breakfast for dinner.)    The potatoes got quite crispy on the bottom but I enjoyed that part the best.

Very good and easy!  Sliced potatoes in the food processor and used dried onion flakes since I didn't have green onions.  Mixed a little aged, sharp white cheddar with regular cheddar which was great.  Used an electric skillet at 300 degrees. The bottom got a little crispy which was nice.   Husband took leftovers to work.  Probably even better leftover!  Will definitely do again.  (I think that there is a duplicate sentence in the instructions.)

This was a delicious meal!  It is better suited for brunch vs dinner, but very good.  I actually misread the amount of butter (Tbs vs tsp).  This may have added to that taste and the fact the potatoes on the bottom did not burn.  I will cut back on butter next time, but still use more than the recipe called for.

I made this vegetarian by omitting the ham and adding extra egg (I used 6). The end result was really good! I love how the dish holds together and you can serve slices. I didn't have any problem with the potato overly browning like the previous reviewer. You can add any veggies to this as well. I would add garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the eggs before pouring on. The cheese, I felt, was not necessary. Thanks for the recipe!
