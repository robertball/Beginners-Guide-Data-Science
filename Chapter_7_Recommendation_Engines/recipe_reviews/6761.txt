For those of you who found these buns to dense, the key factor I've found in how fluffy they are is the inital mixing before you add the rest of the flour.
When I mixed these by hand i never did the full three minutes, since the mixture looked smooth well before that. They came out kinda dense this way, but still tasty. When I was able to use a mixer I mixed longer and faster, and I was surprised how fluffy that made the buns. I learned later why this happens. True yeast does do most of the rising and forming air bubbles. However with out proper mixing there will be air bubbles in the bread and they will be uneven in size. What the mixing does is with grainy things like salt kinda punches holes in the dough even in the soupy state before adding all the flour, these holes in the dough will remain and be filled by the CO2 made by the yeast during baking, thus fluffy buns

As of this date(January 2014) I have been making these buns for almost 15 years.  My family LOVES this recipe.  They prefer hamburger buns from this recipe to any others I have tried, including store bought...these don't fall apart.  These buns make great sandwiches, too.  I usually quadruple the recipe for my large family because the kids love to snack on them and we like to give them away. I have been making breads and rolls "from scratch' for decades and this is a great, fast, easy, recipe.  It is by far the best hamburger bun recipe I have used, but we also love them as dinner rolls.  It IS basic so you can adapt the ingredients to your liking... read the reviews and see what others have done.  I have shared this recipe with lots of friends and family.  Everyone who has tasted them loves them.  My one DIL made these as her first venture into yeast bread making and had great success.  Another friend made them as her first venture into yeast breads and her MIL was "very impressed."  It is pretty much a "no fail" recipe.  You will be glad you tried them.  I have already passed this recipe on to my children.  Both of my daughters have people requesting them.

I have also made these with fresh ground whole-wheat flour. They were still excellent! :)

Make these if your house stinks - :)  The aroma alone is worth the price of the ingredients.
I made a batch and cut into 32 strips.  I rolled each strip into a circle and pumped apple pie filling into the center.  I let rise and then baked.  I drizzled powdered sugar glaze over the top and called them danish - they were a BIG hit!

Hmmmmmm, I hate to be the "rebel reviewer", but these buns weren't great for hamburgers.  They had an overwhelming yeast smell & they were a little dense as well.  I may use this recipe again for rolls, but I would take the suggestion of Denise & add less yeast & sub butter for the oil.  Thanks Charlene ;)

Not tasty enough for dinner rolls but an excellent hamburger bun.  I even shaped into long rolls for hotdogs and they were yummy.  For Onion hamburger buns I added a Tbsp. of dried minced onion to the liquids and that was good too.  This is a good, easy, quick recipe.  Thanks!

I have used this recipe many times. Even my mom enjoyed these buns, and she was the one who made all the homemade bread on the farm. Having her seal of approval on this recipe means alot. I  use this recipe to make 12 pan buns, and also for my pizza buns. An easy and never fail recipe.

Thanks for submitting your recipe for all of us to enjoy too.

These are good for hamburger buns, or they make great dinner rolls.   I've also wrapped hot dogs in them to make pigs in a blanket.   Good, easy bread recipe.

I've made these twice (measuring very carefully) and I've had to add a lot more flour than was called for just to make the dough less "soupy".  The buns tasted good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  They were super easy.  I'll keep making them for dinner rolls but prefer something less sweet for sandwich buns.  Thanks for sharing!

I cannot believe how easy this was to make!!!  Forgot to buy dinner rolls one night and found this recipe, what a lifesaver!  Hubby thought they were perfect and daughter gobbled 2 up for breakfast!  (Toasted w/ butter)  We made another batch a couple of nights ago for leftover chicken sandwiches.  Great recipe for an all purpose bun!

I have used this recipe many times.  Just wanted to say if you want to make them a bit healthier you can add 1 cup whole wheat flour and deduct one cup of the white flour.  I mix them in my bread machine on the dough setting; it works great.  Thank you Charlene for submitting this recipe.  Mary M.

These were almost too easy to make, and very good. These will make excellent hamburger buns and sandwich rolls. I will not be buying packaged hamburger buns anymore!!!

These buns were the perfect texture -- substantial, yet light unlike many bread recipes.  They are comparable to store bought buns, but taste so much better and are just as easy!  Five stars all the way!

This is an amazing recipe. I never thought you could make any kind of yeast bread with out all the work of kneading and waiting so long for the rising.  Well, this proved that wrong.  I added a little less yeast (-1/2t.)and it worked great.  Next time I'm gonna try adding a little melted butter in place of some oil to see if they come out more buttery tasting (just personal preferance).

Oh, hallelujah!  These buns are the best things to come out of my oven yet!  I halved the recipe and shaped the dough into 8 balls instead of 6 for PERFECT moist dinner rolls in no time whatsoever.  I can't wait to make more of the larger ones for sandwiches and hamburgers.  With a little help from a Kitchenaid, this was the easiest recipe I have tried yet.  Thank you for a wonderful, fail-proof, EXCELLENT recipe that will definitely stay in my collection!

These are good buns! I added honey instead of sugar and used more wheat flour. I brushed the tops of the dough with egg wash. (egg whites plus 1 tbsp of water) Following the advice of one of the reviews, I measured out my dough to 6.5 oz, so that I could have all same sized buns. I ended up with Jumanji sized buns! If you want the size that are sold in stores, then use your scale and measure about 3 oz of dough, or a bit bigger than a golf ball size. After rising it'll still be a pretty good size bun.

Produces lots (16 med-sized) of delicious soft buns easily in a short time (~ 1 hr), which satisfied my in-house critics (5 of them) from ages 39 to 10. I love making bread from scratch, and this is the first yeast bread I've tried, that didn't need kneading, WOW. Apprehensive but did as per recipe, used all milk (as per reviews, thank you. Will try with melted butter next time, instead of oil. Thank you Charlene - excellent recipe. 5/3/04: Tried with butter and 1/2 cup wholemeal flour - still good but firmer, husband ok with it, but I think I prefer it like the original with all milk, as do the children. 

Updated - 24/11/07: Have made sticky pecan caramel rolls and many variations of dried fruit and nuts and/or chocolate buns with this recipe - always a winner. Fave combos: crystallised ginger, pineapple, apricots, almonds/pecans - all chopped coarsely, + mini choc and white choc chips. Or, dried cranberries, orange rind, almonds or pecans and mini white chocolate chips. One of the best recipe finds here.

Light & DELICIOUS!!! These buns are ready in no time at all. I've tried many recipes for rolls, but they never turned out like these do. These  buns put store bought to shame. "EXCELLENT" G.M.S. Amity, Pa.

Wow, I have tried countless bread/bun recipes to no avail, but this one came out perfect!  Thansk you so much for posting this wonderful recipe.  I made as directed, and got 12 HUGE buns out of it.  They were very very light.  Next time I will knead in a little more flour.  Very easy to make and quick beyond compare.

Super quick and easy to make. However, I don't understand why this recipe could of gotten so many rave reviews. They were just average rolls, nothing too special. I give it **.

The greatest thing since sliced bread!This bread was incredible....I made 24 rolls and it took only 45 min to rise and 12 min to bake.  I brushed the tops of the buns with butter when they were hot out of the oven.  WOW...we ate them all!

These were amazing as dinner rolls, and I can't believe how easy they were to make.  I just made them half the size that the buns should be, and they turned out perfect.  I like dense rolls and my husband likes light ones, but these rolls were the perfect compromise--not too light or too dense, and we both loved them.

I could see where these might make good hamburger buns, but I was making them as dinner rolls (as sugesed) and they just tasted like flour! So as a dinner roll, they were completely disappointing.

I varied this recipe for what I had in the cupboard to meet my needs. I used 1/2c margarine[no oil]/1 egg[no milk]added 1/4c wheatgerm and made 50% wholewheat flour. I increased the yeast to a scant 2tbls. The method was the same. These rolls were fabulous.

These were great! I am increasing the recipe to make 18, as only 9 fit on one of my baking sheets.
Yes, they are very easy and quick to make not to leave out delicious, too! It's a keeper!!

I loved these. They were so easy to make! I made half the reciepe, not being sure if they would come out for me, but they did and they were wonderful! I used olive oil and honey instead of sugar. I also followeed the advice of someone below and I stirred it for 3 minutes by hand and it was not dense. It was the perfect texture to use on my bbq pulled beef. I will def. make these again. So easy and tasty!

Perfection!  These buns were tasty and had a perfect consistency to hold up to a hamburger!  I didn't change the recipe itself except to use only 4 1/2 cups flour and made the dough in my bread machine.  I got a little creative with the dough, though.  After the dough rested for 10 minutes, I used a rolling pin and rolled it out to about 3/4 inch to 1 inch and used a 2" round cutter to make 2 dozen mini buns.  Before baking, I brushed some egg wash on top to give it that nice shiny glaze and sprinkled half with sesame seeds and the other half with dehydrated minced onion.  Yummy!  Because the dough expands when rising and hamburgers tend to shrink, I used a 3" round cutter to make the perfect size little burgers for these buns!

Excellent recipe. I subbed 2 c of the flour with whole wheat and warmed the liquids on the stove instead of the microwave. Just a note of caution - don't heat the milk mixture too hot or it could kill the yeast (so I've been told) and then your bread won't rise. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Cut the recipe in half and thru all ingredients into the bread machine on dough cycle.  
Added salt and olive oil to the tops before baking.  VERY soft and really tasty!

I made these H.Buns today, and we loved them, But, I used bread flour instead, & I used my bread machine on dough cycle.
  those of you who have a machine know how to do this, & I did not change anything , except the flour. It just makes it so much better, & not heavy.!!At all. Thanks for the recipe..

After working with several other bread recipes to perfect loaf bread and cinnamon buns, my husband and I decided to try this recipe for hamburger buns.  We followed the directions exactly, which are different in terms of rising times for other bread recipes, and the buns were great!  We will definitely be making more.  Also, once you have the buns shaped, they freeze beautifully.  Then you can take out the number you need, thaw, rise and cook as directed.  This way we always have fresh buns anytime we're having burgers.

Mightyroy, the yeast taste/smell is unavoidable with a single-rise bread. If there are ways to diminish it, I don't know. Even doughs made with 2 rises (raises?) is too yeasty for some--the "real" Bakers don't bake using yeast that's been activated in same day. They start that the night before. If you're interested I can recommend a book or 2. Baking bakery quality bread really is an art, and try as I might I just don't seem to get better at it. That said, I made these buns and they were a huge hit with my kids. So, sure, I'll make them again, but I won't count it as serious baking.

Charlene, your recipe is a keeper. I have been using this recipe for 2 years now and I get nothing but compliments. Just a few days back, I mixed all the ingredients except the remaining flour and let it sit for about 15 minutes before adding remainder flour. Boy oh boy, the bread that was baked was so soft. Baked it for a community gathering and all the ladies were interested to know where I had got this recipe. I don't add milk cause my niece is allergic to it so I substitute it with lukewarm water. Sugar and yeast can be reduced if you don't like it too sweet or dislike the yeasty smell. Fantastic recipe. Thanks

I think that this recipe was so simple to make that even my 4 year old could do it.  Tastes great but does have a bit of a yeast taste, but i think that it could be solved with melted butter ontop.  thanks for the recipe!     *note* for those that did not know what yeast to use, if a recipe calls for yeast not to be dissolved in water before adding with the other ingrediants then you will use rapid rise or highly active yeast for every thing else you will use dry active yeast.

5 stars for the texture.  I substituted 2 cups wheat flour for two of the white and brown sugar instead of white for fear that my change in flour would make the rolls to hard but no problem!  Next time I'll add the white sugar back in or maybe some honey to make these a bit sweeter.

If there were ten stars to rate this recipe it would be a 10!  I've tried other hamburger roll recipes and they were too hard and dry.  This recipe is perfect.  I did substitute 2 cups of the white flour and used whole wheat to make it a little more healthy.  THANK YOU so much for this wonderful recipe!

This was just what I was looking for.  It's so nice that it goes together so quickly and you don't have to think 3 hours ahead for buns.  (These took about an hour, maybe a little less.)  I used half a recipe and divided it into 8 pieces for hot dogs.  I think it could have been divided into more pieces and left to rise a little longer, as the buns were fairly dense.  But they were good that way.

Charlene, thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  It is so much simpler to bake buns and bread, no more 2 or 3 risings.  I let the dough rest for about an hour if I have the time before shaping them into buns.  I use the dough to wrap round sausages. Delicious according to nephew and neices who are my guinea pigs!! I have distributed this recipe to quite a number of people.  Thank you again

Excellent recipe for hamburger buns which remind me of Fuddruckers but would not recommend them for dinner rolls.  The rolls are a beautiful color and texture for hamburgers but are a little bland for dinner rolls.

This was a great quick bread recipe! The dough rises so fast! They taste pretty good too! I used these 2 days (making a total of 3 batches) of the labor day weekend when I had my family over. We had italian beef sandwiches one night and hot dogs with Coney Sauce the next. Made wheat ones using half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour - they were great. Lots of compliments. Gave it a 4. I bought extra ingredients to quickly make my own rolls instead of buying bread at the store.

I've always tased buns like this in restaurants, but could never duplicate the taste or texture. This is it! It was very easy and the rolls are delicious.  I baked mine in a muffin pan and they were beautiful.

These rolls were so good.  I was looking for a quick bread to serve with dinner.  It took about 10 minutes of actual work and about an hour until they were on the table.  Everyone loved them.  No fuss great bread

Dera Charlene, I've gotten hundreds of recipes from this site but this is one of the greatest and most versatile.  The buns are delicious, quick, easy, and the dough is a pleasure to work with.  I make pepperoni rolls, clazones , etc by adding to them before I let them rise.  Thanks so much for sharing

Holy cow, these were good! I did the whole thing in my KitchenAid, which made it super easy and fast. They rose well with the listed amount of yeast. I used white whole wheat flour, which made them a bit more "robust" than a white roll, but they were still amazingly good. We used them as hamburger buns and as sweet rolls (cut open with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon spread on them). My husband and I had to box them up and ban ourselves from the kitchen so we didn't eat them all! Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

I made this recipe without any ingredient substitutions.  I did however, put all the ingredients in my bread machine, set for the dough cycle, with the liquids on the bottom and the yeast on the top.  Once the dough was made, I followed the recipe for shaping and baking.  The rolls came out looking beautiful and very tasty.  They were on the sweeter side, as others have stated, but we liked them that way.  They made great sandwich rolls; but, if I were making them as dinner rolls, I would make them half the size.  They would make fabulous dinner rolls!

Easy and delicious.  One tip: start with 4 cups of flour and then add what you need as the liquid mixes in.  If the weather is dry you'll need less, I've never used the entire 5 cups and it's easier to add more flour than liquid.  We made some hamburger and some hotdog buns, everyone liked them a lot. I sprinkled my shaped rolls with cornmeal and they were great.  Now I'm going to end up doing this for every BBQ because store-bought rolls will seem second-rate!  Thanks a lot!!  (just kidding).  Great idea, great recipe.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe as printed and they came out perfectly--great appearance, texture and taste.  My husband grills terrific hamburgers and they are a great compliment to them.  I used my KitchenAid mixer with the regular paddle and the dough was easy; very little effort compared to most yeast breads.  Kay B.

Lovely recipe - I cut the measurements down to 4, used dried skimmed milk and water and added extra salt and they came out amazing.  So easy and I will be adding various extras.  Thank you

You HAVE to try this recipe.  It is wonderful!! I have made it a number of times. One tip I would like to share is to roll the dough out just slightly and use round biscuit cutters. I use a small cutter for dinner buns, and a larger cutter for sandwich buns. My family can't believe they are homemade!!  This recipe is quick and easy, even for someone who has not worked much with yeast doughs.  Thank you for sharing.

EXCELLENT!!  What more can I say.  I made these with Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil and they turned out delicous.  The next day, I made them again this time adding another 1/4 cup of sugar, a handful of raisins and some cinnamon and ginger and I had some delicious tasty fruit buns which were delicious toasted with butter.  Yummy!

These buns are amazing!!! I used them as hamburger buns and they were great because they didn't crumble or get all mushy. They also baked up huge. Which was perfect because the patty's we had were huge. The taste was really yummy and they smelled amazing baking. I baked them on a baking stone and made 2 into hotdog buns that are soo big they will be perfect for sausages. I am soo impressed with my self, but really I am soo happy I found this recipe. I was worried when I didn'thave to dissolve the yeast before adding the flour, but it worked so well!!!
Thanks for a great recipe!
Anna

These were very good hamburger buns, but I wouldn't use them as dinner rolls.  There are better recipes for that.  They were so quick and easy--loved that.  I used one cup of whole wheat flour.  Thanks!

These are the best I have found so far. I made burger and hotdog buns out of these today. I loved hearing all the compliments my family made when I served these for dinner. I can't wait to serve them to guests. They were very simple to make too. Thanks for sharing!!
UPDATE!! 7/9/03 I had my bread machine to stir these up this time and they were still wonderful. WE will never buy store bought again. And they are still so good when reheated the next day.
 Thank you soooo much for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic. After mixing in the last flour I knead for 10 minutes...just like regular bread then the buns will not be dense.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made nice, fluffy burger and hotdog rolls (I got 6 large burger buns, and 8 hotdog rolls from the recipe.) I added some ground flax seed, but made no other changes.  I used all organic ingredients. Waaaay cheaper than buying them at the health food store!! Quick and easy, too.

3.25 stars for taste and texture.  a little to yeasty for me and a bit dense for hamburgers.  I made mine into longer buns for tortas and grilled them with some butter.  My boys said they were good.  4 Stars for ease.  I'm new to bread making, a total amateur...that could've contributed to texture issues.  TFS

I'm giving these buns a 5 based on serving them the day they're made.  I got rave reviews when I served them to 50 people today.  I don't feel they're as good unless they're freshly made.  They're so quick to make, so why not make them when they're needed?
By the way, I simply put all the ingredients into my stand mixer and mixed them up all at once.  If they hadn't turned out so well, I would have reverted to the recipe's instructions.  I've made them 4 times now.  It's the recipe I'll stick to now. 
Update: I've made this recipe 10 times now.  Just wanted to add a note: when doubling quantities of a bread recipe, don't increase the yeast amount - leave the yeast amount the same.  Rising time doesn't change.

This recipie is great and it is easy! The first time around I substituted 2 cups of wheat flour and I was out of milk so I used yogurt. I was very pleased with the result. I just made a second batch with new variations. I added a little less yeast and sugar. Also I wanted to try mixing in whole grains so I sprouted some wheat berries(to make them soft) and cooked some quinoa, I also mixed in some flax seeds and rye. I mixed all of these in after mixing the liquids, and before the remainder of the flour. I still used a mix of white and wheat four as well as the yogurt in this recipe. Wow what a success! I am very pleased with the addition of the whole grains, I will do this agian.

Despite reading so many reviews of this recipe I was still so shocked at how great these were.  And they couldn't have been easier.  They didn't rise as much as they were supposed to, but that was my fault.  I added a tiny bit of sesame oil with the rest of the oil and it added a nice flavor.  My husband said they were better than any other hamburger buns he's ever had.

I used part WW pastry flour, less oil, and less sugar. They were excellent--light and just the right texture and taste for a burger. My husband & Mom couldn't stop talking about them. Now I'm going to have to make homemade burger buns every time we grill!

What great buns! So fast and easy to make it's almost a joke, and they're perfect for hamburgers. I've changed only a few things: I slightly reduced the amount of sugar and used almost 1 tablespoon of salt, used bread flour instead of all-purpose and mixed a little bit of olive oil in the vegetable oil, just to give the bread some extra flavor. Thanks a lot, I'll make these again for sure!

These buns were truly, as the title suggests, very tasty! My hubby has to have a burger once a week and I decided to make something fresh rather than buying the ususal at the grocery store. Used honey instead of sugar. I brushed the tops with an egg wash and then with sesame seeds. Drew said that they were excellent Charlene. Thanks so much!!

I made the original recipe once for hamburgers and they were good but they were kind of bland. I made 3 batches today (15 rolls per batch) and made them with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. of salt. Fantastic! These are for sloppy joes for a Boy Scout event. Thanks for the orignal recipe!

These buns are incredible! I am an avid bread baker, usually making sourdough bread.  I decided to try this one, and it is wonderful. The recipe made 12 puffy and delicious buns.  This is a very simple recipe for someone just learning about baking yeasted bread. I made the dough in the bread machine, but not all machines are large enough.  We use these buns for everyday sandwiches.  I did need to add about 1/4 cup more water than the recipe called for.

This is a really great recipe, I am new to making bread and they came out perfectly.  I used olive oil instead of veg and they tasted like really good authentic ciabati bread.  Perfect for a good vegi burger

These buns were extremely easy to make and they tasted great.  No more store bought buns for us.  I make them ahead now and freeze them.

These were great dinner rolls I made them for my family and my kids just ate them up.  They were so easy to make that I think I could use this recipe to make a loaf of bread too.

These were a snap to make.  Very easy for the yeast bread shy....They do produce a rather light texture...If you are looking for something a little more dense try else where.  Overall, they were very tasty.

This recipe was delicious! I needed onion rolls to go with my favorite french dip sandwich recipe so I tried this one. I rolled the dough to about 3/4-1" thick, cut and X in the top of each roll, brush with beaten egg and topped the rolls with the following mixture before allowing to rise.
Onion mixture:
1/8 tsp Bonappeitit seasoning
1/8 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp beef boullion granules
1 tsp dry minced onion
They were terrific!

I made these for a baby shower with chicken salad and they were a big hit. Everyone loved them! I even made them a few days ahead of time and froze them...let them thaw a few hours before the event and they were still fluffy, soft & delicious. My grandmother, a wonderful cook, raved about them and asked me for the recipe...the best compliment I could get. I did make a couple of modifications to the recipe including using 2.25 tsp of instant yeast instead of two packets (which I think is equivalent of one packet) and I used bread flour instead of all-purpose. And I kneaded the dough with my stand mixer for about 5 minutes. Wonderful recipe I'm sure I will use many more times. Thanks!

awesome. Used a mixer to stir the dough both times, left it nice and tender, but well kneaded, without me getting sticky. It was hard enough just to get it out of the mixer! Mine ended up rising twice, as I put it under the bowl, then had to nurse my son. By the time I got back to it i was doubled in size, but I cut it up and made eight good sized hamburger buns and eight hot dog buns. It cooks fast, keep your eye on the oven! I'm so glad I found this recipe, super easy and taste the way rolls should. I think butter could make them a little bit better, next time

These were Great! We wanted to grill hamburgers today but didn't have any buns. So I made these and let me tell you they were a hit! I used quick-rise yeast. Tastes better than any storebought and did not fall apart.I also took care to mix the dough for the time suggested. I am going to try this as hotdog buns.

Followed the recipe exactly and LOVED them! So simple, so tasty.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I also made sure to use the hand mixer for the entire 3 minutes in the initial mixing and had no problem with the rolls being dense. They were very fluffy. As another rater said, I think the mixing allows some air to get whipped in the dough to make it fluffy. Very very good served as a sandwich roll or by itself.

These are very good and very easy to make.  You can also shape them into hotdog/hoagie rolls.  I subsituted 1.5 cups of wheat flour to make them a little healthier and they still turned out great!

Thank you so much for this wicked recipe!  I make all hamburger buns, hot dog buns and all bread at home now and just love it.  It is cheaper and much healthier. I agree with the previous comment that it is a little sweet though - I will use less sugar next time.

Amazingly easy and amazingly good! I followed one reviewers tips, and made sure to beat the 'dough' for a SOLID 3 minutes (I used my stand-up mixer). I also let these rise for a total of about 45minutes. They came out SUPER fluffy and light. Really really perfect.

These worked well as buns for our BBQ Chicken Sandwiches. Although the recipe did not specify, I had to knead the bread because it was very sticky. Very good for buns, though I would not use them as dinner rolls as they would be a bit too bland for that use.

This recipe was very good and easy to follow. The buns came out bakery-quality good.
I replaced 2 cups of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour to make it healthier. It tasted great. And it took less than an hour!
These make really big buns, so, the next time I make them, I'll probably make 15 instead of 12 buns.

This recipe was very easy to make, with no kneading and only one rise. If I had made them to be eaten on their own, I might say they weren't very flavorful, but we ate them with sloppy joes and burgers, and they were perfect!

It's important to beat the dough after adding the lukewarm liquids for the full 3 minutes to get soft buns. And don't add too much flour. I ended up adding 4 1/2 cups of flour, one of which was whole wheat. The dough was kind of sticky after the 10 minute rest, but ended up making buns that were soft and fluffy, perfect for hamburgers. I'll definitely be making these again!

Awesome!  I made these as dinner rolls last night.  I have never been able to make bread, but my mom and hubby kept pushing me to keep trying.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!  They were so proud and so was I!  I only made a few small changes...used bread flour, used half of the sugar, and used 1 1/2 tsp. salt.  I made 24 rolls and put them into two 9x13 pans.  Then, let them rise until doubled and baked them.  When they were hot out of the oven, I brushed the tops with butter.  I am so happy and excited to have this recipe.  It's easy, quick, and it works!!!

These are great!  I used butter instead of oil, I am just not fond of oil, and I used half wheat flour and regular flour.  Made some hot dog buns and some hamburger buns.  I will make these again.  My family loved them.

This recipe makes very good buns. The only tip I can add, or agree on if someone else has already mentioned this, is that you space them on your baking sheet so they have enough room to rise, and with no intention of punching them down or moving them later. Once they rise (about an hour and a half) they will be puffy and ready for the oven. They will not rise much in the oven, so if you've punched the dough down before baking, you'll end up with a hard piece of bread.

These were the best buns I have ever made.  I love to bake and I just couldn't get over these.  I made half a batch, (only had one pkg of yeast), but the family loved it and want me to make plenty next time.  Thanks for a great recipe and taking the time to tell everyone exactly how to do it.

A keeper. Soft, light, and tasty. I used half butter and half olive oil for the oil, and substitued 2 cups of whole wheat flour for 2 cups of white. A very easy bread recipe too! The only thing was the bottoms got a little browner than I'd consider perfect, but I don't think that's a fault of the recipe.

Unbelievably easy! These were delicious and just like store bought. I was amazed and impressed by the ease and simplicity of making these. I used bread flour instead of all-purpose. My family all decided we should never buy buns again. (As quick and easy as these were, I have to agree) I am relatively inexperienced at making breads, (5th or 6th time ever in 30 years of cooking) and was intimidated at the thought, but this is so worth it. Definitely a keeper!

I have made these buns quite a few times, I have even tried the whole wheat variation, they are really good, they are good with dinner, for breakfast with some jam, with some tuna or chicken, these are a keeper in my recipe book!

Wow, what an easy and fast bread/roll; I can make this quickly, after work, for an accompaniment with dinner.  I added dried tarragon and dill to mine, and I make it as a dinner roll recipe -- but with the added herbs, it's nice as a savory breakfast addition, as well.  I always substitute extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil, and I even placed less than called for, in the original recipe; it always bakes perfectly.  Thank you for a delicious roll!

This is a very easy and versatile dough! I use it several times each week for buns, dinner rolls, and pizza crust. I recommend subsituting 1 cup oatmeal for 1/3 cup of the flour to make a chewier, more homemade tasting bread. Excellent recipe!!

I have been baking for quite a long time and have tried dozens of recipies. This is so far the best quick bread roll recipie I've ever baked.  I make this rolls almost every week. My sons constantly ask for more. I use it whenever I have guests and it always a hit. It is incredible how easy and fast they are to prepare and they never fail.  No need to spend a lot of time to get great quality and excellent rolls with this recipie. I have been baking these for over a year now.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipie.

This is the hamburger bun recipe I have been looking for.  The buns are not too sweet, not too light, not too heavy.  They smell and taste wonderful - yes, they are yeasty - but to me that's what they should be.  They are beautiful - imperfections in shaping were lost in baking.  I am serving them with pulled pork - always a hit and very easy to do for a crowd and the home made buns will make it very special.

The recipe did not specify what type of yeast I should use. I used Fleischmann's Traditional Yeast and the buns came out alright but the next time I will try the recipe using Quick-Rise Yeast.  Hopefully they will come out fluffier.  Other than that, I would use a milk and sugar glaze on the dough before baking.  Next time, I should end up with sweet, fluffy dinner rolls.

I made dinner rolls out of these.  They were very good for my first try at bread made from scratch.  They didn't really rise for me though and we found them to be fairly heavy.  I will definitely try this again but will use 4 cups of flour instead of 5 and wait a little longer to see if dough will rise.

I made dinner rolls out of these, and was very dissapointed.  However, my 5 year old and fiance loved them.  They did not rise for me really.  I also scaled the recipe  down, thinking I would be overwhelmed with dinner rolls, so that could've been a big boo boo on my part.  I do, however, plan to try again with the full scale recipe for the hamburger buns, so I'm not completely writing this off.

I'd never tried my hand at homemade sandwich buns before, but this recipe seemed to simple to pass up.  When I saw that there was no kneading and only a single rise, I was intrigued.  When I pulled these gorgeous, fluffy buns from the oven, I was sold!  They tasted great and held up well to saucy barbecued pork. I followed the recipe as written.  This would be a great recipe for the first-time bread maker.  High recommend!

LOVED This.....I actually put the dry ingredients into my Ninja blender, heated up the liquid in a pyrex measure cup, and added a bit of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning. This is such a NICE DOUGH! Perfect on it's own, and so easy! Nice to have a perfect base to add to, to make the breads your own! Thank you!

This is a very simple recipe that anyone can follow.  However, I modified my methods a bit.

1) Instead of vegetable oil, I used butter
2) Instead of milk, vanilla soy milk
3) I mixed the flower and salt together in a bowl, made a well in the center, placed the yeast in and then poured in the warm mixture (milk, butter, water) and let it sit for a minute or two for the yeast to activate.

There was too much yeast, so I would suggest only doing about 1.5 packages of dry yeast.

These are absolutely fantastic! I have made them 3 times now and they are consistently great!! I even froze them and just set on the counter over the course of the day to thaw, and they never had that strange frozen taste some breads get. I cut the recipe in half and used my bread machine's dough setting. 

I added all liquid ingredients first (I also substituted raw honey for the white sugar in the same amount) and then added flour, salt and yeast on top of liquids. Set it for dough cycle and let it do all the work. After it was done I simply shaped the buns and baked in the oven -- they smell amazing and are just delicious! I have used them as hamburger buns, sandwich buns, dinner rolls -- I can see these making fantastic cinnamon rolls too! 

This is a super easy recipe that is consistently wonderful. I will NEVER buy store bought buns again after these!

Very plain but also perfect for burgers, etc. This takes me 45 min. of uninterrupted time to get them rising on the pan. Considering there's nothing left to do besides get them in the oven, that's pretty good but I need remember this and not start them when I don't have that much time to devote at once. Thanks!

I made these buns in the bread machine on the dough cycle and then just rolled into buns and raised for 30 to 45 minutes. Very easy recipe and so I no longer have to buy them from the store! I also used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of all oil to cut down on the fat. These make very good hamburger or sandwhich buns.

These were very easy and didn't take much time at all (I did let them rise on the cookie sheet about 1 hr in an oven I heated for only about 5 min, then turned off). I followed other reviewers advice and was sure to beat the mixture at least 3 mins. I think this is what makes them lighter and fluffy, not dense. I made 11 large buns to serve my pulled pork on. They were perfect. I didn't alter the recipe at all but only used abut 4.5 cups of flour. I left the dough a little bit tacky. Whole family loved them!

I always follow this recipe exactly as it says, and they always turn out awesome!  I don't think I've ever made them and not had someone comment about how great they are.  Whenever I need buns, I just whip these up because they're so simple and easy.  When I pull them out of the oven, my husband usually eats 2 or 3 before I have a chance to pull them off the baking stone.  Look no further for the most amazing buns you've ever had!

We loved this recipe.  Very quick and easy to make.  I made 8 instead of 12 buns, and they were a good size.  I also used an electric mixer and they turned out very light and fluffy.  This will be a staple at our home.

Very easy to make (and customize with lots of curry powder), but I found that the dough didn't rise very much. Maybe the house was too cold.

Incredible and so easy! At the suggestion of another reviewer I made some of them into strips and filled with a strawberry (rather than apple) filling (strawberries,little sugar, little flour) and sprinkled a powder sugar glaze over them to make danishes (powder sugar glaze is just the sugar, vanilla and butter and a little water). Thank you for this new family tradition!

I just made these buns for dinner tonight and they turned out great!  I forgot to mix the batter for 3 minutes in the beginning and then got distracted when the dough was rising under the bowl, so the dough ended up under the bowl for twice as long, but they turned out fluffy and superb despite all my mistakes.  I also made the Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers and these went great together.

These were great!  I made them in my KA and they were super easy.  I made into both hot dog and hamburger/sandwich rolls.  I baked, then froze some and they were great thawed, as well as fresh from the oven.  I also froze a batch after the first rise, to later bake and serve, but I haven't baked and served them yet, so I'll have to edit my review then and update how that worked out for me.  These are a tad sweet, so if you don't care for a sweeter roll, you may want to cut back the sugar a bit.  I don't think I'll buy rolls again!  TY!

I wanted to try this out by making it as written first.  These were very easy to make in my Kitchen Aid and they were fast too.  Now, what I've noticed that may be helpful to others is that it seems to have just a little too much of a yeast taste, so decreasing it a little may be the best solution because for 12 buns I don't believe the recipe would be impacted at all since they grew so much and I probably could have made 13 or 14.  Besides that I'll have to try to substitute butter for the oil next time because in my opinion that would have made the recipe true to it's name "Tasty".  Have to agree with Mallinda... They were absolutely beautiful to look at!  I paired it with "Barbecued Beef Brisket from this site".

I think these are wonderful! They were very easy to make using my KitchenAid mixer. the only change I made was I used a little less white sugar, probably more like 1/8 cup. I have 12 big hamburger-size buns that I'll be using tonight with the Zesty BBQ chicken from this site. My kids and I each had one with our lunch a little while ago though and we all agreed it's a keeper :)

Very good little buns.  A bit sweet, but I'm getting used to that from white breads.  I am not a sweet person, so maybe it's all me.  I used honey instead of sugar bc I prefer honey and I had some honey that's carmalizing so I wanted to use it up.  I was leary of mixing salt with yeast and no proofing, but they worked well enough.  I used about 5 1/2 cups of flour total and ended up kneading the 1/2 cup in.  It was just a bit sticky--it's a bit wet here.  Bf loved them.  I'll have to add them to my rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good, basic, FAST recipe.  I like making my own breads but I hardly every have time.  These rose much faster then I anticipated - I checked them after ~25 minutes and they were doubled in size.  We ate half and froze the other half - kept wonderfully.  Thanks for sharing!

I wish my buns would look like the ones in the pictures, but they don't.

Might be user error, but I am a novice bread baker though I have tried for years to find a no fail recipe.  I would recommend Amish White Bread as being the best soft airy type bread anyone can made.

This one may take experience ...cause mine don't really even have good texture.

Thanks for posting though!

This is the BEST! I've tried several other recipes for hamburger buns, and this one is perfect. Thank you so much for such a great recipe. I bake superb whole-wheat bread (thanks to my KitchenAid mixer), and my husband has requested that I make this bun recipe in several versions, starting with 1/3 whole-wheat pastry flour and working it up to 100% whole-wheat flour to see which we like best. I'll keep you posted. He also requested that I make bagels for him. Do you have a bagel recipe? I hope so, because after my first very, very successful baking of hamburger buns, I'll try any recipe you have. Must go searching for them . . .

This was second try at a yeast bread recipe from this site.  I don't have great luck with them so I halved the recipe to begin with.  I did read most of the reviews to try and get some tips.  Special thanks goes to TTHMC and Bill for their reviews because their tips may actually help me finally make a good yeast bread!  My only change was to use half wheat flour and half white.  I did use my kitchenaid to mix, let rise covered with a cloth in a warm sunny place.  Got 7 good looking buns!

This recipe is so easy!! I even altered it to fit the low fat, I use whole wheat flour, (I can't believe it's not butter spray) for the oil, and splenda for the sugar, they are awesome!!! I make these weekly, regular for the kids, and lo-fat for us.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!  I made a double batch for a family party and everyone raved about how good they were. Remember to mix the wet ingredients with the first two cups of flour and yeast for at least 3 minutes.  This is what will activate the yeast to make them rise.  I love the ease of this recipe.  We will make again and again!

These turned out great; they look like I just picked them up from the bakery! They are a little more dense that hamburger buns I'm used to, but it was no big deal. I made these to go with pulled pork and it was just perfectly yummy. I might like them better as dinner rolls next time though. I'm just happy that they turned out so well. Thanks!

I've tried 5 different bun recipes and this is my favorite.  I use half bread flour and half whole wheat (or white-whole wheat), and throw everything in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  I buy my yeast in bulk, but I only put in 1 package worth (2.5 tsp) of yeast.  The bun is a little sweet, but everyone seems to enjoy them that way!

This is a great bun recipe! Though the buns turned out on the bland side, I'm still giving 5 stars because they were superbly soft and easy to make. I used them for hamburgers, so the lack of flavor wasn't a factor at all. Next time I make this - which will likely be soon! - I will be sure to add a bit more salt, and use butter instead of oil. And also, some reviews have mentioned a horrible yeasty smell/taste, and I'm happy to say that my buns had neither. The smelled so delicious baking, and when eating.. in fact, I'm enjoying a leftover bun with butter at this very moment! Yummy!

First time for homemade hamburger buns, turned out great.  Used 2 Cup Wheat Flour and 3 Cup Bread Flour.  Mixed in Bread Maker.  Now I just have to practice making them prettier!  Thank you for sharing.

I don't know what happened here, these didn't turn out for me at all! They got real big in size, and then just flattened like a pancake! I've been doing good with breads lately, but I'm thinking I did something wrong. I'll try them again.
Update: I just recently tried these again, and they turned out perfect! A perfect 5 this time around!

What a great recipe.... so easy and versatile. I've had them plain, with raisins, and even filled them with tuna before baking. I substituted soy milk because my son is allergic and it is still delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I'd gone to the store to get hotdog buns and came back with burger buns.  I didn't feel like going back to the store and had the ingredients for this recipe.  I'm glad I tried it!
I substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour, and it came out perfect.  My boyfriend said the buns were the best part of the whole meal!

Thanks Charlene for a tasty and versatile recipe.  I took another reviewer, Crystian's suggestion to half the flour with whole wheat flour and half olive oil and they turned out very tasty. They rose well and baked up beautifully. I froze some and they thaw nicely for future meals.  I will be making them for years to come!

I just made these buns and they were awesome.  As usual I changed this recipe to my own tastes. I used half white flour and half whole wheat. Also I used half vegetable oil and half olive just for some extra flavor. Because I was serving them with pasta I added some of my favorite dry herbs and sprinkled cheese on top. Mmmm!!

I rolled these out and cut them with a small biscuit cutter. Used the recipe for Favorite Hamburger Bites and made mini burgers. These rolls were so easy to make and turned out so well. I can't wait to try making them with little smoked sausages in the middle. Great recipe, thanks Charlene!

This is a wonderful recipe. I did not change a thing and they came out beautiful. I will be making them again, but will make a smaller size as they are huge.  Thank you Charlene.

This got huge! I let them raise for maybe 1/2 hr and then baked them.They got even bigger while baking and I have huge hot dog and hamburger buns for our Memorial Day celebration! Next time I will have to make them smaller and flatter I think ;) But great recipe. We are using our hamburger buns for pull bbq--mmmmm. Oh and I used about half wheat flour too--mmmm mmmm!

Very quick and EZ! Delicious taste! I used 1 C. wheat flour and they were perfect for burgers. Made a lot of buns. If you're having a cook out and want to impress, choose this recipe. Thanks!

OMG!  I just pulled these out of the oven and I am thrilled!  These were super simple to make.  Not only do they smell wonderful and look great but I just ate one plain and they taste wonderful as well.  We will be eating them shortly for chopped beef sandwiches.  I can already tell that I will be making these often.  Thank you sooo much for sharing!

These were wonderful.  I used them to make the best hamburger buns.  These made 13 large buns and I topped them with a little sesame seed.  The smelled wonderful, and tasted even better.  Very easy to do.  I could easily see these as dinner rolls.

I wish I had discovered this recipe years ago when my husband was alive.  He loved buns and   I did make them, but they took so  much work and took so long that I did not make them often.  How he would have loved these buns!  So easy and delicious!!  Five stars!!

Sorry, I tried it following the recipe except for halving it and found the buns to be very heavy.  I'm go back to the AllRecipes Hamburger or Hot Dog Buns recipe, it has never failed me.

Fantastic!!! Some people commented that the buns are too dense... I didn't try the recipe "as is" so I can't say for sure. I added 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten, as this keeps the texture light and fluffy (I always add some when I use all purpose flour for yeast baking.) Also substituted some whole wheat flour. I made 17 buns instead of 12 and was glad I did, as they were plenty big enough. I will definitely make these buns again!!!

These are perfect and easy. I throw all the ingredients (I just use one package of quick rise yeast) in my bread maker and let it do the work for me. I then pinch the dough off and roll in my hands to make 12 balls, which I just flatten out a bit on a baking sheet for burger buns. Tonight I'll be making hot dog buns. I love the simple ingredients and the lack of preservatives and artificial crud. These are a keeper, and the recipe allows for the addition of herbs or the use of various oils if you want to spruce it up.

Turned out great. I replaced the sugar with honey. They ended up almost as big as hamburger buns. Next time I will make twice as many out of the same batch.

The buns are great for sandwiches and burgers.They are soft and chewy and just the right density to hold toppings. I  read multiple comments and decided to make a few changes to put chance on my side. It was worth it!  I cut down the yeast a little (4 tsp instead of 5) and I added less flour (4 cups instead of 5), since some people said it was dense (half all-purpose half bread flour) and the buns turned out great! I made 9 and cooked for 17 minutes.

Delicious!  Substituted 2 tbsps of melted butter for the  vegetable oil.  Made the  dough in a stand mixer, but mixed for 7 minutes on medium speed.  No more store bought buns for us.   Thanks Charlene!

Very easy and very good. Light and fluffy just like it said it would be. I halfed the recipe and made 4 very large buns. I think next time I will add some whole wheat flour- just didn't have any today.

These are amazing.  It feels so good to make a bun at home as good as any you can buy, and you know all the ingredients included.  Just reading the list of chemicals in cheap store-bought buns turns me off.  These hold together wonderfully for burgers, and with just one rise, they could not be any easier.  I've found It is important to  mix the full three minutes before you add the final flour.  And the final amount of flour varies depending on the day.  That's true with lots of breads, and you just have to live with it.  You just have to aim for a soft dough that pulls away from the bowl into a ball when you are kneading it.  

I never  buy buns anymore.  I always have the ingredients for these, and they are quick, requiring little pre-planning.  And as a plus, they looking beautiful.  Thanks for sharing.

Not a bad bun, made it as the recipe is written except dividing into approximately  140 gram balls  of dough to make 9 buns. I don't like a normal hamburger patty hanging way over the bun but I'm going to look at more recipes to find a lighter, less filling bun. I love a good burger but the recipes I've tried are heavier, denser, more like a hearty sandwich bread. Add that with a big piece of meat and all the fixings I just find it too much food. Thus, looking for a lighter fluffier bun similar to a store bought version that I can make with possibly more flavor....... Hope it isn't impossible! If I do make this recipe again... I would add an extra teaspoon of salt.

I was looking for an easy recipe for buns and this is great! I made these so I didn't have to go out and buy some bread for sandwiches for the rest of the week.  Great right out of the oven with a little butter on them. Will have with sandwiches tomorrow. I'm not sure about other people's reviews saying they are dense. I followed the instuctions almost exactly except I kneaded the dough a few times. I also only had 1/2 cup milk so I used an extra 1/2 cup of water. Mine turned out really fluffy. I put some sesame seeds on a few other them and will use those for hamburger buns. My batch made 15 total, 4 of which I made into hot dog shaped. Will make these again and again.

Great for hamburger/sandwich buns.  I made them for pulled pork my husband made in the smoker.  I don't think that I care for them as dinner rolls, but my husband like them on their own, as did my 9 year old who rubbed his belly and proclaimed them "delicious".  Very easy to make, too.  No kneeding.

Despite problems I have had with breads in the past, I made these and could not have been more pleased with how they turned out. As suggested by another reviewer, I was sure to mix the ingredients the full three minutes (with a Kitchenaid) before adding in the final flour and they came out very light. They did have a touch of sweetness to them, but I like that--in fact, I am going to add a bit more sugar next time to see what happens. Great recipe!

These were great had been on vacation on Bald Head Island and the local market had ran out of hamburger buns the night we decided to cook.  No problem I had extra flour and we made these buns.  Excellent and really rather simple.  I will definitely make these again even when buns are available.

Awesome!  I am a very poor baker - and these rolls turned out perfect. I only needed 6 rolls so I cut the recipe in half and it turned out really good, plus it was so easy!  Next time, I'll try adding some garlic for garlic rolls.

This was my first attempt at making buns and they turned out fantastic. I do not own a mixer, so I did it all by hand. Quick and very easy. My DH loved them so much, I have to make another batch already!

This recipe makes tasty hamburger buns but even better dinner rolls.  It yielded 26 dinner rolls baked on a 17" cookie sheet.  I followed Bills advice to beat the dough for 3 minutes with the mixer.  They were flavorful and light.  They stayed fresh even better than the buns and they froze well.  This recipe is quick, easy and tasty.

I made no changes.  This is an amazing recipe.  My impatient family all said that the rolls made dinner worth the wait, and BF even said he wants me to make them every week!  My only comment is that the prep time is unrealistic.  Factor in at least an additional 45 minutes to an hour for rising time.

I made these buns twice in one day because the first batch did not work. I followed the recipe to the T and the buns didnt rise much and were super dense. I Made the recipe again and this time, mixed the flour with the salt and in another bowl, the rest of the ingredients. Once the yeast was foamy, about 8 min, I slowly added the flour until a soft dough formed. After rising I brushed them with milk/egg was and topped them with poppy seeds. They were flavorful and fluffy!

Thanks for the recipe!!  I have been making buns for about 20 years and usually use my Mother in laws recipe.  It has allot of steps though.  Yours was easy and the dough has a nice consistancy.  The flavor and texture were great.  I will be using mine for hot ham and cheese in the crockpot.  I am sure they will make unbelievable sammies!!

YUM!  And so easy.  I made these and used as dinner rolls (as opposed to buns).  Next time I will halve the recipe again and make them smaller (more the size of dinner rolls).   SUGGESTION:  Use recipe from AR "Herb Garlic & Cheese rolls".  Use just the oil and herbs from this recipe as a topping for the Tasty Buns .... YUMM-O!!!   Perfect.   *Caution*  About 110 is the warmest you want the milk mixture - any more may kill the yeast and rolls won't rise correctly.  I heated milk mixture in the microwave for about 45 seconds and let it cool for a few minutes.  (use thermometer to be exact - don't guess)   Again - these were YUMMY and I will definitely make again.  Very easy!

These were awesome, I will never want to buy store bought again!  I had trouble with this rising so I proofed the yeist first.  I made 3 servings with gradual addition of approx 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour.  It made 2 big buns.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I used a mixer with the dough beaters and it didn't work so well with a small amount of dough.  They did NOT have a yeast taste to them and were perfect consistency.  The bottoms were slightly too brown at 12 minutes....I would check them at 10 mins.  I served the chicken salad recipe from allrecipes on these buns.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I am allergic to soy. I cannot find hamburger or hotdog buns I can eat. These come out perfect everytime. I reduce the sugar to 1/8 cup for hots and hamburgers. I keep the 1/4 cup and turn the dough into cinnamon rolls.

SO good!  I make these often to go along with dinner, or for hamburger buns and for French Dip.  They taste great and they are so easy and quick!  I really enjoy them made with white flour, but  I have made this recipe many times using all whole wheat bread flour rather than all purpose white and they turn out really well too.  Anyone that I have made this recipe for loves them.

So so so good.  Our family likes them with small sticks of pepperoni baked inside.  A recipe doesn't get much easier than this.

I started making these in 2002 when I didn't want to drive to the store for hamburger buns.  I haven't purchased buns since.  A smaller version makes a great dinner roll with an egg wash right before baking.

These were really good.  They came out a little dense for me, I'm not sure if maybe I should have let the dough sit for a little bit longer.  Per other reviews I only put an 1/8 cup of sugar in the mix and they came out wonderful.  My BF ate them with burgers and I dipped them in the Delicious Ham and Potato Cheese Soup recipe from this site.  I will be making these again!

The dough of this recipe is great to work with. I did, however, let it rised twice. The buns came out soft and very tasty. I made 6 hamburger buns and 7 hot dog buns. Another keeper. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Oh, yum.  My husband's still talking about these.  Great recipe.  I did use only 4 cups of flour (one of them whole wheat) and kneaded after the mixing for about 4-6 min.  It rose well on the table (I was unsure about this).  The ones on the top rack looked a lovely dark brown.

Very easy and flavorful.  I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  The buns were a little bit crumbly, probably because of the whole wheat flour.  Will try making as dinner rolls next time.  Couldn't believe how easy these were for a yeast bread.

This is our favorite recipe for hamburger buns, I actually use white whole wheat that I grind and it is still so light, I don't know how some people get dense buns.  I let mine rise for 20-30 min. and they are definitly doubled in size by then.  This is a recipe you should try if you want some good hamburger buns!  Oh I forgot to add that I do put the water (110 deg), milk (110 deg), yeast, and sugar in my kitchen aid and let it sit for 10 min (when it gets bubbly) and then add the rest of the ingredients and let it knead for10 min or so.  I don't know if that makes a difference or not, that's how I always work with yeast.

A very good and simple recipe.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer to whip these up in no time. They only require one rising which is also a timesaver.My husband likes sesame seeds, so I put a bunch on top of the buns rising.  I didn't need 12 buns, so I rolled some of the dough flat and covered it with a mixture of apples,raisens, cinnamon, ginger, nuts, and a little sugar and rolled it up cinnamon roll style.  Yummy!  This recipe will definitely stay in my recipe box.

I made these tonight for our grilled chicken teriyaki sandwiches..they were fantastic! I used whole wheat flour, rather than white and canola rather than vegetable oil. Other than that, I made as directed. I plan to make again & again! Thanks for sharing.

These are wonderful! This was my first attempt at homemade buns and I can say...I will never buy them again.  I did make one change.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 3 cups white.

I made brat buns with this recipe.  Followed the recipe as mentioned, tastes like bisquik the first day, but are awesome brat buns the second day. 

For a greased pan, I used non-stick spray and flour.

Note:  the way I made them, they turned out a bit heavy, but that's perfect for brat buns.  A bit too heavy for burger/chicken sandwiches.

Wow.  Add me to the list of admirers.  The recipe was so easy that I was *sure* something would be off--they'd be bland, or heavy, or dry, or something--but they are phenomenal.  I made a 1/2 recipe.  Ran out of all-purpose after the first cup so I then used bread flour.  I love the yeasty taste and they look just beautiful.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

I tried this recipe twice, once with vegetable oil and once more with butter. I'd say the vege oil bun taste blander, whereas the butter bun smells wonderful from far and tastes much better. However, i found an overwhelming foul yeast smell in both buns that sort of makes them unpalatable to some people. If breathe deep into the bun with your nostrils, you'll get the undesirable yeasty smell. I don't know. Textrue is sublime, smells great from far, but close up it smells horrible. And this smell affects the taste. I'm giving it 4 stars because this would be a wonderful bun (with butter replacing vege oil) if I can find a way to remove the foul rotten yeasty smell with a more subtle sweet smelling "normal" yeast smell. I think the bad smell came from yeast action on the milk (fresh milk). I've tried another recipe with milk too and got the same smell. Will powdered milk + water help? Maybe i need to add an egg. Read somewhere that eggs can inhibit undesirable yeast products. I gotta try, need you guys to help!!!

Update: Thanks for the advice BeJane. I'll look into culturing yeast the night before and also multiple rise :)
I tried replacign all milk with water but the yeasty odor was still present.

This recipe was just alright for me.  I found it to be quite heavy. Not what I wanted for a hamburger bun.  However, it was still good, but I think better for dipping into soup or chili.

This recipe is amazing! We call these "Easy Peasy Rolls" in our home. I have made these over and over, with wheat and white flour, in multiple countries, and it ALWAYS works. It's FAST (I can make homemade from scratch in 60 minutes or less), EASY (few ingredients works great) and TASTY. They do taste a bit yeasty, but they are just sweet enough to counteract that. Be sure to beat them well at the beginning of the process, though, and DO NOT add extra flour from what the recipe calls for. If you do, they will be too heavy (as it is with all breads).

I've made buns before and they never seemed to turn out. I tries this recipe and they tasted great, all my friends asked for the recipe. The only thing i changed was after the dough sat under the bowl i kneaded it for 7 minutes and then shaped them into buns and put them on my tray and put a cloth over them till they become twice the size they were before. I used the buns with my stew that i had made in my crock pot that night.

I'm pretty inexperienced at bread-baking, but I found this to be a pretty quick and easy recipe.  Only took about 30-45 minutes for them to rise.  Subbed 1c Bob's Red Mill whole-wheat pastry flour for 1c A-P flour.  Topped off with sesame seeds and served with grilled burgers tonight.  Thanks, Charlene!

These truly were very tasty buns and better than store bought. I used 90% of the suggested oil from the soybean oil from the cooking spray and 10% from melted butter. The buns came out great, soft and very delicious. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely, this recipe is a keeper.

This is a perfect hambuger / hotdog bun recipe. I always get 6 hambuger buns, and 5 hotdog buns out of this recipe. I have hambuger and hotdog bun pans that help the dough keep a nice shape. My children eat these over store bought.

These are so good and easy to make. Hubby and the kids were eating so many of them by themselves when they came out of the oven I was concerned about having enough to actually have with supper. Thank you so much for this recipe. Will definately be making tons of these in the future.

The recipe was excellent and I added the Italian herbs as suggested by one of the reviewers. Made three rounds and must say the room temperature plays a very important role for the dough to rise. I left the heater on in all 3 attempts in a confine room but on the last attempt the weather was colder and the dough did not double in size as good.

Good to check the weather forecast if you are relying on extra external heat.

These were so easy and came out great! I used 4 cups of flour total. Also, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tsps salt. Next time, I will make seperate the dough into much smaller balls, they came out larger than I expected.

This is a very quick and easy recipe.  I made smaller dinner rolls which turned out great.  Also I used some of the dough to make cinnamon buns.   Added a confectioners sugar/milk/vanilla glaze and they were very tasty too.

These are PERFECT!!  I have made them several times and they come out perfect every time.  Even when I had it half mixed and then realized the milk was empty and took the time to run out and get more.  I have used the recipe to make hamburger buns and to make dinner rolls and they get rave reviews from everyone.  Thank you for the recipe, it is really really good!

Made smaller into dinner rolls, brushed with melted butter before baking and they were 'okay'.  I wasn't sure whether the recipe called for rapid-rise or regular yeast.  The rolls got crumbly soon after baking and don't hold over well.  Not a bad recipe, might use again, but I'll keep trying!

Fast great recipe. Add egg wash and sesame seeds for a totally professional look. Use scale for weighing each bun's piece of dough for uniform size buns. Divide into 24 buns for dinner rolls.

I think I heated my microwave ingredients too long on the stove top & killed my yeast.  They are tasty buns but did not rise.  My husband loves them.  I will make them again.

not too bad.......I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of all purpose flour, and found them to be a little bit heavy. Very easy to make, though, and I will make them again!

Love this recipe. I rolled out the extra dough after shaping 12 buns, brushed on some butter and added home made saskatoon jam. I rolled them as you would make cinnamon rolls, let them rise for an hour. After risen I topped them with a butter, honey, and Saskatoon concoction. Baked them for ~25 minutes. They are super tasty! Thought I would share :-)

Every recipe for buns I've ever made turned out dry, and deserved to be rated two stars. But this recipe...?! It was AMAZING. It was moist, and fluffy, and could be eaten without butter (: Thanks so much for this awesome recipe. PLEASE come out with more like it!!!

Buns are very dense and heavy yeast taste. Was not clear from the ingredients if the recipe calls for regular yeast or quick rise yeast.

I've never made rolls before and these came out perfect! They were fluffy and had a great taste. I followed the original directions perfectly and I wouldn't change it.

Like others have mentioned, initially mixing on a high speed is crucial for these. I usually use these for pulled pork sandwiches and they're perfect!

My first attempt with the recipe was for New Years Eve and it was a success.  I used a Kitchenaide mixer as mentioned in some of the other comments to make the dough and the rise time I found to be 45 minutes in a kitchen with an ambient temperature of 23C.  Baking time was 13 minutes in a convection oven.  This is a nice simple recipe which I will use again.

These were very easy to make, and they didn't even have to rise that long. I will make these forever. They turned out perfect and we used them for turkey leftover sandwiches. Would highly recommend.

It was easy to make, my first try was a success and it was a great experience in making buns. The packet yeast that I bought was slightly extra from the recipe, so I speed up the process of raising the dough. It turned out to be perfect.

Love these buns!! Always taste great, and are super easy to make!

I have made some edits to this recipe based on my own preferences:
-I swapped out 2 cups of the white flour for whole wheat (one for the initial mix, and one for post wet ingredients)
-I replaced 1/2 of the white sugar with brown, and took a touch of sugar overall out (to the tune of about a tbps or so). It made the buns less sweet, which made them tastier overall!
-I also let the dough rise for about an hour rather than the 10 minutes as the recipe suggests, which allows them to be super light and fluffy.

Perfect best recipe for yeast rolls,not too dense fluffy and delicious..I will be making it again. Most definitely...useful  tip? I used 109 degree water and mixed well before adding  flour and kneaded dough until warm(slightly above room temp.)just wish I could post picture to show how beautiful my buns are.

I made these for hamburger buns and they turned out great. And I agree with out reviewers don't over mix at the beginning, I mixed by hand and it didn't take 3 mins to make it smooth. Also I only needed to add an additional 2 cups of flour not 3, and I just let it sit for 15 mins in the bowl covered ( why dirty the counter?) Make sure to let them rise to double their size once divided, it doesn't say how long in the recipe, it took them about an hour-hour and a half to double for me. They came out light and fluffy. Hubby requested that I make them again.

These were very good, and so easy to make!  The dough is very soft and pliable, it made very shapely hot dog and hamburger buns.  My only complaint is they did turn out pretty dense , and I would prefer them to be a bit more light and fluffy.  I think I will let them raise a little bit extra next time, and as well I might turn the oven down a bit.

These rolls came out fantastic. I followed the recommendation of the other reviewers.  i.e. mixing for exactly 3 minutes. The rolls came out beautiful, light, and fluffy. The only change I made was to brush the buns with an egg-wash before baking. It gave them a lovely golden color.  Next time I might also  use a little less sugar. They were a tad sweet for my taste, although my husband  thought they were perfect.

These are great, especially for a fast roll! I've been sick for the past three days and wasn't in the right frame of mind to be cooking Christmas dinner, and completely forgot to get my usual rolls rising while my prime rib was roasting...so, off to Allrecipes I go for a quicker yeast roll recipe. Glad I did! These were great, super fluffy. I did follow one reviewer's suggestion to make sure you really beat the yeast mixture before adding the other 3 cups of flour. I also substituted melted butter for the oil and upped the sugar to 1/3 cup. Definitely a keeper!

Certainly wasn't the best buns I have made.  I found it too dense and not that tasty.  I think doing an egg wash to offer shine to them would make them look nicer.  Also I think you could probably make more buns instead of 12 as they were a tad large.

I will certainly be making this again. I don't tend to make bread often, although it's something I love to do... Who doesn't love the smell of fresh baked bread? But this turned out beautifully. While most of the reviews do say it can get dense, I will agree that when I mixed it for a minute or two it turned out to be very fluffy and perfect. I enjoyed making little designs in them, my family loved them!

My first try at bread from scratch.  Yummy warm heaven right out of the oven with homemade minastroni soup.  I used 1/2 cup melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  Look forward to making this again.

They were pretty dense, but tasted great!  Definitely did in a pinch when I didn't have any hamburger buns for dinner.

Very simple recipe. Great for burgers and sliders.
I made them smaller and used them for Superbowl night for pork sliders. They were a hit!!

WOW!  This is the best bread recipe I have ever used, ever!
I followed this to the tea. except right before it went in the oven I lightly brushed them with Vegetable oil and sprinkled sesame seeds on top. They came out browned and crunchy on the outside and soft and wow on the inside. I took the advice of another review, and beat my dough in a mixer...AMAZING!

These rolls are the best! The only change I made was to heat the milk alone in the microwave on "beverage" setting, then add the oil and sugar to reduce the temperature to the proper point.  So easy and speedy. Everyone LOVES these and they're requested for every family gathering.

I didn't care for these ): I'm sure I did something wrong. They were a bit flat, and the taste was kind of like a cross between a biscuit and a bun. Also, they were too delicate to be used as hamburger buns.

Very tasty rolls. I have to modify it slightly for high altitude to avoid over-rising and collapse and achieve a finer texture. I reduce the yeast to about 1 tablespoon, use bread flour, and let the dough have a full rise to double in a covered bowl at room temperature before punching down and forming the 12 rolls. I let the formed rolls rise about 75% (not fully double) before baking at 415 degrees F for about 10 minutes. They'll rise a little more while cooking. I freeze the rolls in bags of 3 so I only have to pull out one bag to thaw for dinner. This recipe makes for yummy dinner rolls too if divided into 24 rolls.

Wow Wow and Wow where has this recipe been all my life! Its so good and so easy and fast! I made it exactly as written the only thing i let my kitchen aid do most of the work! My husband said that i needed to make these everday! I took them for a family supper and got mass approval!  I have made them several times and they turned out perfect each time, they are a little dense but that was a good thing for us ! These will  be my forever buns!?? Oh and i did brush them with butter when they came out of the oven just to make them look even better!

I followed the recipe to a T.  They were really tasty and super easy to make, but I would not use them for hamburger buns. That's what I did and they completely overpowered the actual hamburger and the flavors didn't really mesh well. If I make them again it will just be as dinner rolls.

These are the best. I made the buns according to the recipe the first few times. We thought they were great. Then I decided to try substituting half of the white flour with whole wheat flour and also cut the sugar to only one tablespoon.  Just because we like some whole wheat and we do not like a sweet bun.  I have not bought hamburger buns since finding this recipe. They are light and fluffy and do not fall apart like bought hamburger buns. I also use this recipe for dinner rolls.   Thank you so much for this fast and tasty recipe.

Very easy and turned out great. Mine did turn out just a bit on the dense side, but we really liked them. I will be making these again. Next time I will split the dough into 18 instead of 12. They were just a bit bigger than we prefer.

Mine did not rise, but our ac is set at 72 or lower. I tried heating the oven and turning it off and letting them rise for over a hour. Even turned oven light on for 30 mins. Still did not try to rise. They did rise a little when I cooked them. I used brown sugar (double the amount) and followed the other directions, even the 3 mins first step. Loved them, but wished they were fluffier. Almost as good as Kings HW rolls ;)

First time ever making bread and I nailed it! Was a little unsure if how long to let it rise but out turned it great. Used these with the black bean veggie burger recipe and loved it. I didn't change a thing!

I was hosting a BBQ last night and wanted a gourmet burger bun but didn't want to pay for 20 gourmet buns at the store. This recipe was an absolute hit! No one could believe that I made the buns. They worked out perfectly. I used my kitchen aid mixer and let the dough stand for longer than 10 mins (closer to 45). I then punched it down and formed it into rolls. I pushed down the rolls twice before baking so they would not be too round. I agree the flavour of these may not be ideal for a roll, but they were awesome burger buns. Very happy with this recipe!! I used a combo of bread flour and all purpose.

This goes down in history as one of my biggest cooking tragedies of all time. To be fair with the rating, I changed an ingredient. I used "bread flour" instead of "all purpose flour". That must have been the problem. Please use this review as a "what NOT to do" with this recipe. Here is what you shouldn't do: I used bread flour instead of AP flour because that is what I had. I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. I used the regular attachment (don't know what it's called) to mix in step one until creamy as recipe suggested for 3 minutes. Then I switched it to the dough hook as I proceeded with step 2. I let it mix/knead for about 5+ minutes. The dough was BEAUTIFUL and easy to work with. I thought everything was going great. I followed the rest of directions exactly. The buns came out looking like hockey pucks and RAW. I put them back in the oven for a total of THIRTY MINUTES!!!! They weren't burnt, but still FLAT and raw and doughy in the middle. What a tragedy. They were disgusting. I make breads all of the time. I can only assume that the bread flour and using my mixer were TERRIBLE mistakes.

Very easy and tasty indeed... Although I've replaced 1/2 of the oil with some (leftover!) melted butter and they turned out divine! I'll be making them again (and again and again!) and try them with some whole grain flour too!

. I have made it 3 times in 3 days doubling   We had them with our clam chowder soup, chili, as sandwiches for lunch and with burgers.  I have had to chase my husband and teenage boys out of the kitchen, they can't resist warm from the oven.

I made these with my stepdaughter yesterday on a whim and they were delicious!  Hardest part was shaping the dough for hot dogs - but we'll keep working on our technique.  I'm glad to have this recipe as something to make when I need fresh rolls...  Just the thing I needed.

this are surely buns no dinner rolls very good with hot dogs. The only reason it a four star is the taste of the bun itself plain, taste a little off without the meat.

This recipe is great! Made it just this morning and it was a big hit! My only recommendation is to beat the batter for the 3 minutes it is called for and not under at all, it really seems to help with the consistency of the dough!

ADORE these buns! I make this recipie all the time now! No more store bought for us! Ive also adapted this for the bread machine, just 1/2 the ingredients (place wet on bottom, dry on top) and I added 1 tbsp more water because it was a touch too dry.

Changed out flour for whole wheat flour and oil for applesauce and added about 1/4 cup honey .... These were yummy!!!!! But a bit dense especially if your thinking hamburg bun type... But delicious dinner rolls!!!!!!!

I just made these buns. I have 2 bread machines so made 2 batches and just threw them in the machine on the dough setting. I added the ingredients differently though.Warm water, yeast, warm milk, oil, then the dry ingredients. After the cycle was done I just made 12 rounded balls and egg washed them. 15-16 minutes in the oven. They were a little bland, maybe a little dense. Add butter to them and YUM. Next time I will try hand mixing and sub butter for oil. I will keep looking for the right bun recipe though

Awesome recipe!  I have no experience making buns but these still turned out great.  I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour (just to make myself feel that these are somewhat healthy) and they are still awesome.

Used food processor b/c I have dough function. I didn't follow directions exactly first time and dough heavy. Suggestions for fluffy (beat runny for a while) second time and added a lot of lightness. Also, cover with plastic or cloth when rising so dough tops are not to flakey (doesn't lead to enjoyable eating with it so messy). Was told by family that they were much better than store bought!

I loved the speed and ease of this recipe. The buns were pretty good, but on their own merit and without the quickness, I probably would do a 3 star.

They were a bit sweet - I'd probably cut the sugar a bit next time. But I will definitely be making these again. Easy when it is pretty speedy. I let them rise in the pan for about 45 min and that was enough.
Thanks!

I have never made buns or bread before (except in my bread maker) and these turned out fabulously!  Thank you for the recipe.  My adult son and his friends couldn't wait for dinner, however, and ate them all before the burgers came off the grill!  They enjoyed them with homemade crabapple jelly.

Really nice - I cooked them at altitude (mile high) and put in a bit less yeast and increased the milk (but not too much adjustment either way).  Next time I'll check them at 10 minutes as they were very brown at 12 minutes; they weren't burnt, but I like a lighter bun.  Very nice taste - went great with hamburgers.

These were very good. I had to sub the milk with Silk Soy Milk since we don't buy milk. I don't think they would make good hamburger buns, but they make yummy sandwich bread.

A great basic recipe.  I used whole wheat flour, and they were a bit dense.  I loved them but people who are more used to lighter rolls might want to use half all purpose flour or skip the whole wheat flour entirely.  I'm taking these to work tomorrow for a Thanksgiving pot luck.  I may end up being the only person that eats them, though.  That's ok.  That means left overs to freeze and take some other time.

These are fantastic and I can't seem to keep them around when I make them. Even my boyfriend's old world Italian grandmother loved these buns! I like adding a tablespoon and a half dried basil to the flour/yeast mixture.

These buns were great! I ran out of oil so i used half oil and half butter and they turned out wonderful. I did do what some others suggested and beat the mixture for a full 3 minutes and i used less sugar.

This was my first try at making buns.  These are good in a pinch but are a lot heavier than the store bought buns.  Served with whiskey hamburgers from this site.

very easy. I used 2 c whole wheat flour and 2 2/3 c  bread flour, used honey instead of sugar and butter 4 tbsp instead of the oil. Very soft and a little dense.My son had it for breakfast with egg. Going to make burgers with it tonight. thanks for the recipe.

Great buns, very easy to make, just be careful because they get quite large.

Fantastic!  These are so easy to make.  I am on a low-sodium diet, so I cut the salt in half and they were still excellent.  They make great mini-buns for pulled pork sliders.

These are very good-tasting and good-textured buns--perfect for homemade sandwich buns. I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I had to mix in quite a bit of extra flour (1-2 cups) just to get the dough dry enough to handle. It was too sticky to shape or hold a shape when I followed the recipe as written.

Their name describes them exactly - TASTY.  I found that they make an excellent dinner roll, but a little tender for a hamburger bun, although tasty.  I sliced them and toasted them for breakfast with butter and jam...yummy! I halved the recipe, but next time I'll use the full recipe, since they disappeared too quickly. So fast to make, you don't have to plan hours ahead to enjoy this great treat.

Slightly dense, good dinner roll, not necessarily a great hamburger bun. Was delicious for egg and sausage sandwich.

These buns are great!  Very versatile too.  I have made them twice, and I am giving the recipe 4 stars because they come out relatively flat.  I followed the instructions exactly, so I am not sure what to make of it.

The buns turned out very well and were easy to make but were a bit too sweet. Also the top of the buns didn't turn brown. I think the next time I'll make it, I'll decrease the sugar and coat the top of the buns with some egg wash.

Very easy to make...but just so so as far as flavor.  I made them to use with veggie burgers and I thought they were too dense.  The flavor of the veggie burger was lost in this dense bland bun.  I even tasted a warm bun out of the oven with a little butter and it was so bland.  I don't think I'll make this again.

As hamburger buns these are really fantastic and they hardly take any time at all.  They are a good 60-minute roll recipe as well, but much better as buns.  My husband decreed that we would never buy buns again.

Yes, they did smell wonderful and did turn out wonderfully soft... but I was a little disappointed as they were not all that tasty. So the second time i made them, I doubled the salt and they came out just right for us. It is a great recipe to play around with. Next time I'll make these with raisins and a little more sugar..mmmh:-).

I honestly have to give this recipe 5 stars.  Not only did I think these tasted great but so did my whole family.  They can be used as hamburger buns or sandwich buns.
I also liked how easy they were to make, I usually don´t have luck in making any kind of bread but these were no fail :)
Thanks for sharing.

Holy Moly!!  This turned out great! I used 1 TB of dry yeast and increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and mixed in my Kitchenaid for 10 min. Other than that I followed the recipe and eating my second bun. Going to use these as hamburger buns later this evening!

These are delicious!  I made them exactly as the recipe says... the first time I used them for some black bean burgers that I made.  They are a little crumbly and thick for burgers, but I liked them anyway.  The second time I made grilled cheese sandwiches out of them.  I also like to eat them plain as a dinner roll.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fantastic and very easy recipe for soft, delicious, beautiful rolls/buns. The fact that no kneading was necessary, and that rising time was minimal, was a huge bonus. I've tried a lot of roll recipes and none have come out as nicely as this one.

These buns turned out great!  My husband didn't really like making sandwiches with homemade bread, so I was looking for an easy buns recipe.  For me, they turned out light, fluffy and the tops weren't rock hard as sometimes happens with loaf bread.

These buns where wonderful.  They were really easy to make & held up well to the hamburger patty.  I was able to get 16 nice sized buns.  I think I just spoiled my family, they will want these instead of the store bought buns.

The bread turned out just right!  I've tried making bread a few times before, but it's never turned out so soft and perfect like this one.  I did make some changes:

- I used half the recipe
- I added an egg after adding the milk/oil/water mixture
- I used half whole wheat and half flour
- I let the dough rise twice
- Baked it for 10 minutes

I made these changes based on some of the reviews.  Next time I might try full whole wheat - hopefully it'll be just as soft!  I didn't have any problems with smells (it smells great), but it is a little bland - so I would consider this a basic recipe and maybe add some flavor to it next time.  Other than that, thanks for the recipe!

Oh my gosh - these are great.  I made this recipe because I didn't want to drive in the rain to the store to get buns for sandwiches.  I may never buy again.  I cut the recipe in half to make 6 big buns.  So fast and easy in the k-aid mixer.  Only mess was a little flour on my cutting board.  Wahoo!

These were good, but they turned out a little heavy. Next time, I will try and let them rise longer before putting them in oven. Maybe the yeast I was using wasn't good or something.

Fantastic!!  I just made these to go with sloppy joes. They were quick and easy. I only made a 1/2 recipe, and didn't notice any "yeast smell."  I also brushed the tops with melted butter while they were warm to make them super soft. Will definitely make often. Thanks!

These were so easy and my kids really liked them - I think though for next time I will make them smaller b/c they are very big and doughy - will definetly make these again - thanks so much for the recipe!

We love Tasty Buns!  They are so easy to make, so we can never again use store-bought buns.

FABULOUS!  I halved the recipe and took the advice from other reviewers by using butter instead of oil.  I think it really made a difference.  I also used quick yeast and had no problem at all with the buns being too yeasty(smelly).  Great recipe!

GREAT! I mixed the milk, old and water together, warmed it in the microwave to 120F, then added the yeast and sugar, let it bloom, then added it to the flour and salt. Be patient and let them rise... I is worth the wait. I used this recipe to make mini hamburger and hotdog buns for a party, everyone loved them.

I cut the recipe in half - used two cups of flour plus a little extra to reduce stickyness and to knead out - i used a package of quick acting yeast and followed the directions on the package to proof it - i mixed all dry ingredients together and added yeast mixture and remaining liquids - kneaded that for 4 minutes - let rise one hour - roll into 8 buns - let double in size - cooked at 400F for 10 minutes - they were perfect with no yeasty taste at all - the were not crusty at all and they were really good that way - ate them with chili

Oh my gosh, these came out so wonderful and talk about EASY!  I had so much flour left over from my Christmas baking, so when it came time to make hamburgers, I thought I'd try my hand at fresh buns.  This recipe was perfect.  I was in a hurry and didn't let them rise as much as I could have, but they still came out wonderfully.

I made these with sloppy joes and let me tell you, nothing went to waste,  they were the bomb.  My kids and husband loved them, will never buy hamburger buns again.
