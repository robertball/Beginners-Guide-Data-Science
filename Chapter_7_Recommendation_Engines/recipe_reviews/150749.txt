I had previously rated this 3 stars. After having it again with 1/2 the ketchup mixture the texture was more like meatloaf and we really enjoyed it. The flavor is really nice.

So Good!  Reading the reviews did help.  I used half of ketchup mixture in and half on top as suggested by someone and everyone in the family (3 year old included) loved it!  Thanks

I thought this was delicious and easy. I cooked the sweet potato in the microwave, then just scooped out the flesh and mashed it in. I left out the BBQ sauce altogether, and the meatloaf didn't come out mushy at all (as others mentioned). I will make this again.

OK! The texture is odd, but if you have cooked with ground turkey you know it is not like ground beef. I left out all the wet ingredient except maybe 3 tbs. of tomato sauce. I put a generous amount of ketchup on top along with shredded pepper jack cheese. I used 1 cup oats instead of bread and added half a green bell pepper chopped. I DID NOT whip the sweet potato, instead I cooled them down after boiling and just mushed everything together with my hands.It turned out great and my 2 year son and my husband both liked it. A great healthy alternative to beef meatloaf.

I really liked this recipe, but I did change it a bit (I know, I know.  Go ahead and curse silently at me.)  Anyway, I used a pound of turkey and a pound of ground chicken.  I used two eggs to make up for the extra meat, as well.  I, too, did the half and half with the sauce - half in the mixture and half on top (although I didn't really measure anything.)  I really liked it and it's even better the next day.  Plus, the sweet potatoes make it a pretty color.  I'll definitely make this again!

I thought I'd try this recipe out for my family as meatloaf isn't ao popular in the UK. I made 1 minor change and that was to use Wholegrain mustard instead of Dijon as that was all I had. 
The meatloaf went down well. My 2 oldest kids adored it and the adults all thought it was delicious. My youngest son wasn't too impressed but he doesn't like sweet potatoes so that wasn't a suprise. The cold leftovers went in seconds as a fantastic sandwich filler. 
I found that the leftovers stayed together better as it was very moist when first cooked. Good recipe!

This is a delicious meatloaf! My whole family loved it! I used 3 lbs of turkey because I have a big family so I needed to raise the temperature to 375. I only used one sweet potatoe and it gave just the right amount of flavor. I think that if I had gone by the recipe exactly and tripled everything it would have been way too much. I also left out the ketchup and put it on top instead, and I used Progresso breadcrumbs instead of slices of bread. I'm only giving this a 4 because I think the measurements need some revision. Will definitely make again!

Hmmm.  What did I do wrong?  The meatloaf came out more like a pate - slices would not hold together.  This made the children verrrrry suspicious!  Perhaps the size of the sweet potato makes a difference?  Admittedly I used a pretty big sweet potato, but I didn't expect the consistency of *gulp* raw ground meat.  All of this being said, the taste of the meatloaf was really quite good - even for those who don't love the taste of ground turkey.  Maybe the original contributor of this recipe (or someone who's had success) could suggest a measured amount of sweet potato?

I thought this recipe was an interesting spin on traditional meatloaf. I just used plain bread crumbs that you buy in the store and kept adding more until the meat didn't feel too moist. Great recipe!

Yummy and moist. I love sweet potato and love that I could sneak it into a food that my whole family could enjoy. Ground turkey is sometimes bland so this perked it up with sweetness, texture and moisture.  I'll make it again.

I have made several turkey meatloaves.  All were "ok", but I tried another recipe. 
I found this one and OMG it is delish!

  I doubled the recipe(that is the turkey amount I had) followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients,I put 1/2 of the sauce in and 1/2 on top and cooked my loaves in my cupcakes tin and 
  I love the crusty edges so I thought why not?  Well it was perfect. simple serving, portion control and easy.
  This is so moist and flavorful.  Really. Not one seasoning out shines the other.
 We them the 1st night out of the oven.  Next night I had sandwiches, cold. and the 3rd we had them warmed up and shared with some friends(pot luck kind of thing) and they were all begging me for the recipe.
  100% with this one.

This is an awesome recipe.  I'm always game for eating healthier.  I did microwave my sweet potato which was quicker and instead of using regular bread for the crumbs, I used 1/3 cup of Italian breadcrumbs which seemed to be a perfect amount.  I also used just 1 tsp. of salt and pepper since the ketchup and bbq sauce has plenty of flavor.  This recipe is a keeper in our house.  Thank U so much for sharing with us.

I honestly didn't think this would come out very good; considering I'm not very seasoned with meatloafs in general. Also I didn't have all the ingredients and had to subsitute and change a lot. I added one more egg, no BBQ sauce, no mustard, and instead of bread I used a cup of instant potatoes. I baked this for an hour and a half also, cause I like it well done. But OMG...melt in your mouth good! My baby just loved it...not to mention my husband who kept asking, "What is IN this?!" Must have recipe and very easily switched around depending on your ingredients!

This recipe was great!  My only variation was that I used corn meal in place of the bread crumbs.

A really tasty, healthy alternative to regular meatloaf! Will definitely make again. I didn't have honey bbq sauce so I used original and I used honey mustard (about 1 tbsp) instead of dijon mustard. Also, I did have to use more bread crumbs. I agree with others though and add a little ketchup to the mix but mainly to the top! It keeps it from getting too moist.

This is the only meatloaf I've ever had that I liked (I don't care for beef but I've tried other recipes for turkey meatloaf).  My beef-loving husband likes it and even my mom, who won't eat turkey burgers any more because "it's just too much meat", adores this recipe.  To save some time and dirtying a pot I just poke some holes in the sweet potato with a fork, microwave it and then scoop the cooked flesh out of the skin.

I changed this recipe and it came out AMAZINGLY well the first time.   I have a sensitivity (bad things happen) to garlic/onions, so left them out. I used 1 lb turkey, 1 med-lg sweet potato, one egg, one cup oats, 1/2 orange pepper, 2 stalks celery, 1 tsp ketchup, 1 tsp dijon mustard, 2 tsp bbq sauce with more on top prior to baking.   No added salt and a healthy amount of fresh ground pepper.      KEY moves here were to cook potato in microwave for 6-7 min, then scoop it out, combine it w/egg, oats, turkey, veggies...  brushed KC Masterpiece bbq sauce on top, then baked for 1 hr, 20 min at 350, let sit for 20 min in pan prior to slicing and it sliced perfectly...  Not wet like others here have mentioned.   Stayed together...  Taste and consistency were perfect!

Very tasty, but the texture was more like a crabcake. I used about 1/2c. bread crumbs, and next time I'll use more. I didn't use the barbecue sauce, and I only put a little ketchup and mustard in the loaf with some ketchup and honey mixed baked on the top. I also added some finely chopped green pepper with the onion. Really good, my husband and one year old loved it!

THis was very good! I also microwaved my potato and added about 1 to 1.5 cups italian brea crumbs. I like to make my meatloaf in 9x12 pan so all the side and top get browned. Less mushy. I added the sauce to the top to cook but it needed more. Next time I will add additional sauce to the loaf about 15 minutes before it is done. My DH and I  also added Franks Hot Wing sauce to our portions at the table and it was REALLY YUMMY! If you like a little kick, try it!

This is a favorite at my house. I have to be honest though, I use the baked potato button on the microwave to cook the sweet potato.  Then I just peel off the skin and mash it with a fork.  I really hate cutting sweet potatoes.  I also put half the ketchup mixture on top and half in the meat as others have mentioned.  And meatloaf sandwiches the next day are amazing !!

this is wonderful! i made it gluten free by using GF bread (3 slices since it is smaller), only 1/8 c. ketchup, 2 sweet potatoes (we are a veggie loving family) and 1/2 lb. turkey.  I will be sharing this recipe with my GF friends!

I made this recipe using canned yams that had been drained.  When I mixed it up it was so wet it wouldn't hold shape so I added additional bread.  It still would not hold shape but I decided to try baking it on a rack in the roast pan.  It was so sloppy it fell through the slats of the rack!  I put it in 4 small piles and baked it to see what would happen. The taste wasn't bad, but I suggest that you make sure you use fresh sweet potato not canned and that your ground turkey hasn't had water added to it which I think might must have had to be so wet even after cooking. We went out to dinner.

this recipe was just a little to sweet for my family's tastes so I used some regular potatoes as well and used a whole package of crushed saltines! This made it less sweet and little firmer.

Very good, will make it again.
only change was to use 1/3c total bbq+ketchup and 1/3cup breadcrumbs instead of actual bread.

I know that there are so many great reviews about this recipe, but my family and I did not care for it. The texture was off and the flavor too. It didn't taste a thing like meatloaf. We will never be trying this again.

the dish was delicious! the sweet potatoes were a great touch! but it turned out really mushy even when it was completely done.  It stayed together but didn't have the firmness that it should have. i'd cut the ingredients all except the ground turkey in half if i make it again...

This was wonderful! Made this last night and the fam loved it! I understand why some people say its more like pate...because it is so moist. Because of that I did add one xtra slice of wheat bread and a little under 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. But trust me-its great!

oh. my. gosh.  This recipe is so unbelievably delicious!  I don't like meatloaf, but I decided to try this for some reason and it was so favorful and moist.

The ONLY thing I did differently, based on the reveiws is I used half the ketchup and BBQ sauce that they called for in the meatloaf mix and half on the top before I baked it.

Seriously - make at least two.  You'll have one for dinner, some for leftovers for lunch the next day and then more for meatloaf sandwiches the next night (throw it on some toast).  

Perfect recipe.  I've already passed this on to everyone I know!

Thanks!

I've made this twice - with sweet potato once, and squash the next - very tasty.  It doesn't replace regular meatloaf, however.  Very different.  I only rate 3 stars, because it literally falls apart when serving and I dish it up with a large spoon.  Would never make for company because of this issue, but the flavor is good...

I found this recipe by using the 'ingredients' option and gave it a try last night. I did make a couple minor alterations to suit our tastes. I sauteed the onion and garlic gently until translucent before adding to the loaf mix (hubby dislikes finding semi-raw onion in his meatloaf), and I left much of the sweet potato in small chunks. The resulting slices, while soft due to the natural texture of turkey were lovely - studded with golden nuggets of sweet potato. Hubby, whose appetite has been difficult to entice due to health issues, ate every bite and congratulated me on finding such a delightful recipe ;-)  I served it with a simple side - canned green beans, mostly drained, added to sauteed garlic with Italian spice mix. The tang contrasted nicely with the sweetness of the loaf. A keeper!

I had huge success with this recipe!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used half the sauce mixture (ketchup, barbecue sauce, and mustard) in the loaf and saved the other half to put on top as well as using Progresso bread crumbs (plain).  I also used regular barbecue sauce and honey mustard instead of dijon.  I cooked the sweet potato in the microwave and I found that to be quick and easy.  I used a 9 x 9 baking pan and it worked great.  I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!

Split decision in our house. Husband said I should make this again, I'm on the fence, and the kids are 50/50. Everyone agreed it was better with some extra honey bbq sauce on the side.  I made mostly as directed, the only change was putting 1/4 of the ketchup/bbq sauce on top per other reviewers suggestions. It didn't seem wet when I put it into the oven, but fell apart when we served it. Not a big deal for just the family! If I make this again I'll probably skip the ketchup and mustard and just use the honey bbq sauce.

I really liked this recipe.  I was attracted by the sweet potato but a little put off by the ketchup and bbq sauce.  I took the other reviewers advice and only used half, I also didn't have any whole wheat bread so I subbed 2 thick slices of leftover Irish Soda bread that I had in the freezer and pulsed in the food processor. I'm thinking this yielded more crumbs than the 2 slices of wheat bread but did not have the "mushy" problem others seem to have.  I'm a big fan of sweet & savory together so after baking the meatloaf for an hour, pulled it out and brushed peach preserves on top and put back in the oven for the last ten minutes. The end result was a nice firm meatloaf and the taste of the sweet potato really came through.  The next afternoon I had leftovers (room temp) on crackers for a snack (delish!) and that's got me thinking about maybe making a small one for cocktail parties like a country pate. I will be making this again.

We loved this recipe.  I do agree that it was a little mushy, but some of that has to do with it being ground turkey instead of beef.  I did add a little oatmeal, though I'm not sure it helped, maybe another egg would do the trick? I did notice that the more it cooled, the easier it is to slice, but it is hard to have patience when it smells so good!  It was a nice, lighter version of regular meatloaf, and a good way to sneak in vegetables!  I will definitely make this again (and again, and again!).  Thanks for sharing.

Had smaller potato and added extra bread as my sister likes things on the dry side.  (Anything to get her to eat.)  Was still moist enough for me. Added cheese blend on top with a little inside too.

This was sooooooo yummy!  And the leftovers were awesome cold!  We got about 6 servings out of it because we served it with salad and other yummies...Next time I'm going to try cooking it in one of those meatloaf pans that allow the extra juices drain, because it was really juicy.

The best meatloaf ever (as a rule, I really do not like meatloaf) - it was hard to keep as a slice (but then again I forgot the egg), and very healthy.  Everyone liked it.

I thought the flavor with the sweet potato was very good but it was far too wet...it didn't hold together at all.  I didn't add onions as I don't find that I like them in meatloaf, so with them I imagine it would be even more mushy.  Perhaps next time it would be better to simply add the ketchup/bbqsauce/mustard on the top and not mixed in with the loaf.  And use half the sweet potato.  

However I give it 4 stars because I think this has the potential to be a very good meatloaf with a few changes.

Made this for dinner tonight. Looking for a nice change for regular meatloaf and something else to do with ground turkey other than burgers.  I did change the recipe, added 1/4 oats (since other reviews claimed it was dry), 1/4 bread crumbs, 2 slices of bread and halved all the wet ingredients. I threw everything in a bowl and mixed by hand. Put more BBQ sauce and ketchup on top.  Baked in a 13x9 dish and made a long log- again so it could crisp up.  Texture was much better than expected based on previous reviews and comments.  It was def on the bland side, but thats ok--it is a meatloaf.  Hubby found it to be a nice change, and we might have it again.  Don't skimp on the salt.

The ketchup, dijon mustard, bbq sauce I mixed in a separate bowl, adding half to the meat and half spread on top.  It worked well, although next time I might make more of it because I actually found the meatloaf itself kind of bland. I used oatmeal instead of wheat bread, which in my opinion doesn't cause it to have a weird consistency or cause it to easily fall apart.  If you don't have honey bbq sauce, which I didn't, you could mix plain bbq sauce and honey which works and tastes great.  I actually wish there had been extra of that bbq/ketchup/dijon mixture because it would have worked nicely on other meat dishes.  Thanks for this recipe.

Totally love this recipe!!! The only thing different I did was substitute reg bread crumbs in for the bread and took the other reviewers suggestion and put half the ketchup mixture on top and it was amazing! Even my three yr old, who is quite possibly the pickiest eater ever, liked it!  Thanks!!

this was very good, my husband and our 17 year old son LOVED it and he isn't big on turkey! I did take some of the other reviews into consideration. I used 2# of ground turkey, omitted the ketchup, used 4 slices of whole wheat bread and 1 sleeve of saltine crackers in mine, this was extremely moist...came out delicious!

One of the best meatloaf recipes I've ever had. My husband doesn't like ketchup, and even though there's a little in the recipe he still liked it. The sweet potatoes make it sweet enough that you don't need a lot of ketchup or bbq sauce to make it sweeter. It did come out a little mushy, so I recommend using extra bread.   This is a keeper and plan on making again and again!

It tastes REALLY GOOD!  The only problem I had was the same as everyone else...it's a little mushy.  I hadn't made meatloaf before, so I was a little nervous.  I would also add some of the ketchup to the top next time.  Good recipe :)

Great taste!  The texture came out more like a typical meatloaf because I reduced the amount of ketchup & mustard.  I used plain bread crumbs that are finely ground, about a cup.  Definitely don't need all that salt & pepper, only used a teaspoon of each.  Would make again :)

I usually try to follow a recipe as written the 1st time that I make it but since so many people had mushy issues, I followed their advice and used half of the BBQ sauce/ketchup/mustard in the meat mix and the other half on top. It turned out great for me. I liked it a lot and will be making it again. Great taste and held together very well.

Followed the recipe, it smelled good.  Taste was so so, but the look and texture was not good.  None of us ate it.

I have made this twice in the last week I loved it so much! The only change I made was that I did not add ANY salt and I took the advice to use half the sauce on top as a glaze. The result is very spicy (in a good way) due to the 1 T pepper, but the second time I made it I used 1/2 t pepper and added 1 more sweet potato to make it healthier. It was yummy both ways!

Taste was good but the consistency was super mushy, it was like stuffing.  I'm wondering how to get it more like meatloaf.  I added extra breadcrumbs and made sure it was firm before cooking it...hmmmmmm.  My husband wouldn't touch it but my 3 year old and I ate it and got through it......

i give it 4 because 3 1/2 is not allowed.. the flavor is great! i took advice and used only the BBQ sauce in the mix and put the ketchup on top. i also tried to "dry" it some by using ground up saltines. 1 1/2 cups of them. while it was not wet it was sticky. maybe letting it cool before cutting would help. next time i may try making it in the am and re heating it at night to see if that helps with the structure.

This was an awesome recipe! Like others, I put half of the ketchup mixture on top of the loaf and half inside. It turned out great, very healthy for those of us doing weight-watchers, my boyfriend loved it, and we have plenty of leftovers for another meal.

This was interesting, odd flavors. My daughter who loves sweet potatoes thought this was terrible and my sweet husband ate it, but I could tell this isn't a keeper. I think this is just too sweet to call a meatloaf. I really wanted to like this....but didn't.

This has a great flavor to it, but turned out much softer than I like my meatloaf to be. I added more crushed crackers until I got to the consistency I wanted.

This is a great recipe! However, I added less than half a teaspoon of salt, and with  the salt in the BBQ sauce, ketchup and mustard, that was plenty, especially if you are watching your sodium. This is a wonderful, healthy alternative to regular meatloaf--i will definitely make it again!

I've found a new meat loaf recipe and my husband loves it. Can't wait to share it with others. The flavor of this meat loaf is simple yet very tasty. I was expecting to taste the sweet potato, but I really didn't.

Like other reviewers, I added more breadcrumbs until the consistency was less mushy and also put 1/2 of the ketchup on top instead of in the mix. Next time I make this, I think I will put all of the ketchup in the mix because I would have liked a little more flavor. Then I'll just add a little bit of ketchup on top for the color.

Overall, this is a great recipe that I look forward to making again!

I liked it because it is healthy and fairly simple.  I liked the flavor, wasn't crazy about the texture, maybe I will use a smaller potato next time?

I thought it was great and the kids didn't know any better (they hate sweet potatoes).  I only had a 1/2 pound of turkey, so I used a 1/2 pound of extra lean ground beef in it.  And I didn't put the ketchup in it, just on it.  It wasn't runny, it was delicious.

I really liked this meatloaf! I really needed a new way to cook ground turkey,one of our staples and this is it! I loved the texture the potato provided although I had to use a regular instead of sweet, will fix that next time. It didn't slice well otherwise it would be a five star rating. It did slice much better the next day.

Well, for a turkey dish I'd have to rate it 5 stars. But relative to other dishes all I can say is - it was decent.... and while it does what it can with ground turkey, it's still... ground turkey....

As the contributor of this recipe recommended, to avoid mushy - I added two slices of bread - and as a commenter suggested, I reduced the ketchup just a smidge.... Still came out a little on the mushy sde....

Made for a friend with an allergy to onions.  Substituted chopped celery and green peppers, left out ketchup and found gourmet mustard and honey bbq sauce without onions. Just got word that it was great.

Like others, I cut the sauce mixture in half which was just right. This had great flavor and texture. I used a giant muffin pan (6) instead of a loaf pan and only cooked for about 45 min.  Perfect serving sizes

This was really good with TWO modifications - I left out the bbq sauce (as some people said it was too wet, and we didn't have any) and also cut the salt and pepper a lot - 1 tablespoon of each seemed like WAY too much, so I used 2/3 T of each and it was still overwhelming.

Love this.  Have made it many times.  Only change I make is instead of bread crumbs I use salt and pepper rice crackers ground up.  Gives a great flavor and texture.

The taste was good, but the texture was completely off-putting. I did half of the BBQ sauce & ketchup in the mix & half on top, but did not add more bread as suggested by previous reviews. Big mistake.

Really enjoyed this tonight. Of course some modifications, but I used her basic idea of the turkey meat, plus the sweet potato as part of the end result! Did not use a full T of pepper or salt! Added fresh basil & fresh parsley, had red & yellow peppers to use up, did not use a lot of ketchup or BBQ sauce inside of loaf. Baked it until about 1/2 way done, basted out the excess pan juices, added ketchup & brown sugar on top! Baked it about an hour total time, then broiled when done to caramelize the topping. Loved it! Sweet potato in it was great, I used a small one for 2 lbs turkey!

Delivers what you'd expect from the title--nothing relevatory, but not a disappointment either. I put half the mustard/ketchup/BBQ on top, at the advice of other reviewers, and substituted 3/4c bread crumbs for the whole wheat bread, which I didn't have.

I had to improvise: Skipped the onion and used bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread. Still loved it!

My 4 year old ate it and it is healthy!  I used Italian bread crumbs halved the ketchup sauce half in and half on top and cooked on 400 for 25 minutes using my cupcake pan! Husband was impressed. Has a crab cake consistency. Yum!

I took many suggestions from the other reviews and LOVED this recipe!  Half the ketchup/BBQ sauce mixture in the meatloaf, half on top.  3 pieces of whole what bread instead of 2.  Also added approx 1 TBS of dried rosemary (coincidentally homegrown).  Next time I want to try some chopped green pepper also.  Will definitely be making this again and suggesting this recipe to family and friends. Thanks Mrs. Mula-Howard!

This meatloaf was a little soft, but still held shape okay.  We baked the sweet potato before mashing and used part of the bbq/ketchup sauce on top, as well as mixed in.

It was really yummy.  I followed other reviewers advice and only added half the mustard/bbq sauce to the meat mixture, and put the other half on top.  It worked out perfectly. I also microwaved the potato instead of boiling and I think that helped with the "wetness" other reviewers mentioned.  Really good taste.  The sauce on top was sort of sweet which complimented the savory meat mixture.

Always looking for meatloaf recipe variations. Thanks for the base. I took a few short cuts, as I didn't have time to boil the sweet potato. I popped it the micro and then mashed to cool off for a bit. I also reduced the ketchup and didn't add bbq. I only had shallots, so didn't add as much, but also included some dried onions. Other than that...it was the same. Was great!

Sooo good! But I chopped my sweet potato into. Small cubes and panfried like hashbrowns with a little coconut oil and half of a large red onion also chopped fine. I also topped the meatloaf with a mixture of the honey barbecue, ketchup, Dijon mustard, and two large tablespoons of Chinese mustard for a kick.
Really good the next day lightly panfried and placed on 100 cal wheat bread round.

This was really good, very sweet and not the least bit greasy! I didn't have the honey bbq sauce or the dijon mustard, so I substituted with Stubbs Mesquite bbq sauce and Honey mustard, which may have made it too sweet. Personally, I think I would add more spices next time to even out the sweetness with a little bit of spice. But, I think it would be better with Dijon mustard, for sure.

The flavor of this recipe was amazing.  Although, the consistency was mushy.  I will make this again but not as much ketchup sauce (like the other reviews suggested) and maybe more bread.

The honey bbq sauce overwhelms the whole dish. Skip that and it might be more edible.

This recipe is really good!  I decided to cut down on the amount of sauce based on other reviews.  I just eyeballed it, but I think I used about half of what the recipe called for.  Additionally, I put a little extra garlic, along with some oregano and basil.  I made this on Tuesday, and had the leftovers last night, the texture really does improve overnight.

This was SO good, my husband LOVED it. Mine came out a little runny, I used 3 slices of bread and .5lbs more meat than the recipe listed. Next time I would add another 2 slices of bread. Even a bit runny, it was SO good!

Yum! I didn't have BBQ sauce, I used 1/8th of the ketchup in the mix & 1/8th on top and I upped the garlic by 2 cloves. I had a large (like, 7-8" long)sweet potato but only used 3/4 of it. Perfect! I am single and am trying not to eat half of the loaf tonight! Thanks!!!

This was a delicious twist on traditional meatloaf.  My 1 year-old loved it and my husband raved about it.  Definitely was good the next day in sandwiches!

Pretty good. I added brown sugar and cinnamon and halved the ketchup. I used FOUR slices of bread and it was still a lil' mushy for my tastes but the slices we fairly easy to cut. I used a can of candied yams which saved a TON of prep time. I served it with cinnamon apple sauce and almond green beans. The meatloaf was sweet and I look forward to frying it up tomorrow and having it on some wheat toast. All around good recipe. Like the other raters, the quantities of the ingredients need to be adjusted.

My boyfriend loved this and asked if I could make it a couple of times a month. I used a medium sized sweet potato and I added white bread and bread crumbs. For a little extra flavor I mixed ketchup, brown sugar and bbq sauce and topped it on top and than baked it.

We don't like ketchup, so we left that out, and I used spicy bbq sauce instead of honey bbq sauce, since that's what we had on hand and it turned out quite nice.
