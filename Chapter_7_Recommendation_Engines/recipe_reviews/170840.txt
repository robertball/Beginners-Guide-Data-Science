The recipe seemed great at first. After making it I thought it had a really strange taste. It would probably taste better if you put icecream in it and use fruit syrup instead of fruit with seeds.

This is a good recipe for a base smoothie. I made it just the way it reads, like Nicole, I also found a funny taste--it was the Cinn. I added a bit more sugar so that I wouldn't notice it. 
It needs something else but, not sure what yet. If I figure it out, I'll let you guys know.
