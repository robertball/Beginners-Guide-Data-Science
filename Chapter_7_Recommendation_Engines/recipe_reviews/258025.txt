I canâ€™t find Artichokes where I live, but by a stroke of luck  the grocery store had some in. There were only four and I bought them all. This is the first time in over 30 years that I had them, and this recipe did not disappoint. It is absolutely delicious and brought me right back to my childhood. Made as written, except I did not add cheese.
Thank you for the recipe.

Classic Sicilian way to make artichokes. I used the method in the notes not having a steamer handy. I added some white wine to the water and added some fresh hot chili peppers to the artichokes. Thank you for the recipe.
