This recipe was a hit at my daughter's baby shower.  I made a change by adding 2 pieces of toasted bread diced small.  It helped absorb some of the oils.  I also cooked the mushroom caps in a little olive oil before stuffing them so they were nice and tender when done.  Great tasting mushrooms!

These were very good . I might suggest that when a recipe calls for crumbled bacon, that it is much easier to slice the bacon into small pieces before you cook them .

Fantastic!  These were an AWESOME change from the recipe that I usually use.  My entire family loved these (excluding my non-"fungus" friendly brother).  I used real bacon bits & I skipped the oven step & microwaved them for 5 minutes...perfect!  I suggest using a melon baller to remove the stem, it makes it so much easier.  Thank you Krista, you're a "shroom" godess!

I am a college student, and it's always hard to find snacks that are quick and satisfying. I prepared these mushrooms for Valentine's dinner, and my boyfriend LOVED them. He's not an onion fan though, so I omitted them completely and they were still good! I added garlic powder to the sauteing mushrooms for extra flavor (my kitchen never smelled so good!) I used regular white button mushrooms (because college students need to get the best deals they can!) and used a melon baller to scoop out the insides, which made it soooo easy. Like many others, I used extra mushrooms instead of the stems, but since I was short on time and they were on sale, I used pre-sliced mushrooms for the filling, which cut down on my chopping time. I would also recommend using a mini chopper to chop up the bacon. My boyfriend cleaned up the mushrooms and made me make more a few hours after dinner! This is definitely a keeper and I'm going to go make some for myself right now! =) Thanks for the recipe!!

great recipe - I added a small container of cream cheese to the mixture before stuffing the mushrooms. I also used real bacon bits which saved time. They were a hit and the first appetizer finished off.

These mushrooms were outstanding.  I also chopped up mushrooms instead of the stems.  Instead of using the butter I just added the onion and mushroom mixture to the bacon pan  and I also added some fresh garlic and a little bit of parsley.  Everyone loved it.  Next time, I need to make a lot more.  Couldn't keep them on the plate!

Whenever I have company, they go nuts over these, and my husband says they are the best stuffed mushrooms he's ever had. I am so sick of mushrooms stuffed with cream cheese! Sometimes I add a bit of freshly ground black pepper to the filling; it goes well with the other ingredients. You may want to watch out for the juice- I burn my tongue every time! :)

These were out of this world, and I'm not even a bacon kind of girl!  I doubled(ish) the recipe to 21 pieces (I bought two packages and had a surplus of large caps) - used six slices of bacon, fried them up and drained them, then used a portion of the leftover bacon fat to fry up a small finely diced shallot (instead of onion).  Used part stems, but mostly chopped up caps for the filling. 

After I mixed it all up in a bowl with the cheddar cheese, it seemed (to be honest) kind of heavy and unappetizing - so I took three slices of bread, chopped them up into small (1/4") cubes, threw them on a baking sheet and toasted them in the oven until mostly dried out, then threw them all in with the mix.  Best idea ever!!  It extends the quantity of filling, plus soaks up all the extra oils.  Everyone who ate these loved them - I asked for opinions, and everyone was very shocked that the bread was an add-on on my part.  I just imagine they would have been incredibly heavy without it.  I'm definitely making these again...and again...and again!

Most excellent tasting stuffed mushrooms! I used the button mushrooms, that is what I had on hand. My family just loved these at Thanksgiving and I will be taking them to our family Christmas dinner.  Great recipe, none of the flavors "overtakes" the other, just blend together perfectly!

I used baby portobello stuffing size mushrooms and made these as a side dish. I cooked the bacon in the oven then chopped it. I chopped the onion and mushrooms and added them to the bacon before I realized I hadn't cooked them. So, the bacon was cooked twice and it was fine. I added a tbs of bread crumbs and a tsp of parsley. These were rich and savory. Great for people who love bacon, mushrooms and cheese.

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving. Even the kids, who "hate" mushrooms, inhaled them! I used a bit more bacon, added garlic powder, black pepper and parsley. Instead of the stems, I chopped up some small white button mushroom that needed to be used. Thanks so much for this great recipe, GRNSTR1PE!

I love these mushrooms!  The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly, and they were great.  Now, every time I make them I do something a little different.  Sometimes I add a little fresh chopped spinach or finely diced red bell pepper to the stuffing.  Most times I brush the mushroom caps with a little melted butter too.  Very yummy.

I have made these as appetizers for parties, and there are never any left! I substituted the cheddar cheese for monteray jalepeno pepper cheese one time, and that was delicious as well.

These were great. The only small problem is that the mushrooms weren't quite done. Next time, I'll bake the mushrooms for a few minutes, then stuff them. The taste was outstanding though.

Followed the recipe exactly and these are just okay, nothing special.  Tried it again, adding garlic, parsley, mozz and parm cheese with the  cheddar and they were a lot better, but still not great.  They were mostly passed by when served at a party and people who had one didn't have a second.

Turned out great! Used green onion instead of chopped onion. After initially stuffing them, if you have extra, be sure to pile it on! When the cheese melts it makes space. Will probably add a small dash of garlic salt or garlic powder next time around but overall very easy, quick and tasty! Thank you!

Served these at a recent party and they were devoured.  To save time, I used a food processor to chop up the stems (I was tripling the recipe) and also used real bacon bits instead of cooking and crumbling bacon.  Turned out great!

Great Flavor, easy to make, and enjoyed by all!  I ran out of the caps but then just layed a small amount on a mushroom and that worked out.

These mushrooms were ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I made them for a Tailgate party hoping they wouldn't be cooled off by the time we arrived however, all 57 large mushrooms were wiped out.   (purchased mushrooms from Costco) and I cannot tell you enough how much these were loved ... simply wiped out. People were coming up to me 3-4 hours later saying asking, "Really, what restaurant did you get those at" they loved em!!  I did add a large [minced] clove of fresh garlic, minced my onion, added Colby jack and sprayed butter across the mushroom caps prior to cooking.

In addition, I took the left over stuffing mix and stuffed my pork tenderloin's with it.  I sliced open both tenderloins laying one on the bottom, stuffing the center and placing the other over the top, then sprinkled a tad down the top center ...to die for!!! I bet chicken stuffed with this would be great too. (purchased tenderloins at Sam's)  THANKS  FOR THIS RECIPE!!

Delicious and easy!  I doubled the recipe and used half an onion, cooked low and long before adding the mushroom stems.  I also put the mushrooms in the oven to soften a bit before stuffing them.  Everyone liked them!

Oh YUM! per other reviewers tips, I did use a mellon baller to remove the stems, and baked on a bakers rack, so the mushrooms did not get mushy.  Turned out perfect. Thanks

Good.  My hubby liked them.  I did use 3 cheeses (parm, cheddar and mozzarella), everything else was the same.  I am absolutely in love with cheese but I felt I need to add something else to brighten up the flavors.  When I find what that is I could give this 5 stars....but then it wouldn't be the same recipe hehe.

This recipe is quick & easy, especially if you use precooked bacon or a pouch of real bacon pieces. I made a double recipe and they were gone in minutes! Everyone loved them, but next time I will add some salt to the filling.

These were eaten as fast as I could get them out of the oven!  I used real bacon bits and they were great.  About the greasy comment - I think it's more of the mushroom juice that gathers at the bottom of the pan.  As soon as they are on a serving platter, they don't seem greasy at all!

I've been wanting to make this recipe forever but I am the only person in my household that loves stuffed mushrooms, which means I would be the only person eating them if I made them!! Well, I made the exception tonight and pigged out! These were great...every one!  I added a dash of S&P to each.  Plus, they're very easy to make! This is a keeper! Thanks Krista!

I would definitely make these again. The first time around I added fresh garlic but I felt it was overpowering the other flavors so next time I would delete all together or just put in an extremely small amount. Also, I used ready cooked bacon and couldn't get the pieces small enough. Next time I will try bacon bits which I think would bind better with the flavors.  Also will try sharp chedder because I think it needs that little extra kick.

Yummy!  These were not at all what I was searching for but they were awesome.  I added a small amount of bread crumbs and I used plain old buttons.  All three of our little ones tried them.  The two year old ate about 4 of them.  We will definitely have these again!

Doubled the mushrooms but not the cheese. Next time I will salt and pepper the caps before stuffing.  Used cocnut oil for half the butter.  They were great!  Had them for dinner entree, made a very generous maindish for two.

These were pretty good, but need a little something extra like either cream cheese, or a spicy sausage.  They are also quite greasy.

These were delicious! The only things I did differently is, I added some fresh chopped baby spinach and sauteed that with the onion and chopped mushroom stem, and I also did about 1/2 cup cheddar and 1/2 cup smoke gouda. Still would have been delicious either way so I give it 5 Stars!

Made this dish for Christmas and was a huge hit!! I would bake it on an elevated rack next time to keep the shrooms from getting soggy.

These were good, but a bit oily (I took the recommendation to lube up the outside of the mushroom).

i fixed this recipe for super bowel while my husband made home made pizzas. every one loved what i made over the pizzas. I will make this again and I would reccomend this to every one. one thing that i did to make it perfection is i covered the mushrooms with foil after the time it tells you to cook them and cooked them for about 15 min longer. that way the mushrooms were fully cooked.

This is an easy and tasty recipe! I used white button mushrooms. Don't be afraid to add extra cheese and bacon if you want. I made 36 mushrooms and they disappeared withing 20 minutes of putting them out! Great recipe. Thank you!

We all loved these as a great change from the traditional bread crumbs/stuffing mushrooms.  My only change is to cook the caps in a little bacon grease before stuffing to get them to shrink before baking and to keep them moist during baking.  Next time I am going to play with different types of Cheddar.

I make these mushrooms for get-togethers and they are a BIG hit with my family!  I have a big family so I use white mushrooms and it makes more.  I usually double or triple the recipe and make them ahead of time so I have them ready to go in the oven and I can serve them hot.

These mushrooms were quite good.  I couldn't find crimini mushrooms so I substituted baby portabellas.  I made them for a Christmas eve buffet and everyone liked them.  The only problem I had with this recipe was that the mushrooms got somewhat dried and shriveled looking in the over.  Next time I think I'll drizzle a little olive oil over them first.

This is a very nice appetizer.  I couldn't find crimini's,  so I used the portabello mushrooms I had, and just cut them into 4 pieces with a pizza cutter.  It was very good.  Next time I will use the creminis though.  My stuffing kept trying to fall off of my portabellos.

This is a great snack! I made it today and they where great. I also added some garlic butter to the onions and stems which also gave it a nicer taste! Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmmmm.... scrumptious!  Do add a couple of tbsp. of cream cheese to the mix for some added texture (if you don't mind the calories).  Very nice though, will definitely add to the weekly regulars.

his recipe was excellent.  I used the small mushrooms because that is all we had...are those the portebellini's?  I dunno.  This recipe was also excellen for my mom and I because we are both doing the low carb diet.  Instead of regular bacon I used the real bacon bits because let's face it, it was easier lol.

This was fabulous.  I didn't have crimini's but needed to use the button mushrooms we had.  I had eaten 4 before I even realized it!  Hubby ate 2 and said they were very good.  Used shallots instead of onions, and packaged (real) bacon bits to save time.

I used small button mushrooms, and instead of chopping the stems, I just chopped up extra mushrooms, and these were great.  Next time I'll use less bacon, though, mine were a touch salty and greasy, but everyone still loved them!

I made one change to the recipe and that was adding all the cheese to mixture before stuffing the caps. Did not do it on purpose but they turned out great. 
I did cook a little longer than suggested to get the cheese to melt. 
I don't know what anyone else thinks about them because I ate them all myself.

So good!  I added a small about of Panko bread crumbs and I think that gave it a little texture. Also used precooked bacon pieces. They turned out great!  Especially tasty right out of the oven!

My daughter makes these all the time. Everyone LOVES them. Make sure to use crimini mushrooms. We tried to use  button mushrooms once and they were too watery. Thank you for a great recipe.

Wonderful!! Cannot make this often enough at our house. Have to buy mushrooms all the time for this and definitely an easy recipe if you're low on time.

AMAZING! The only thing I did differently was added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the sauteed mushroom stems and onions. Served as an appetizer but these would also make a nice main dish. Will double the recipe next time as I only got to eat two and my hubby and son scarfed down the rest!

this is really a tasty treat. i made a smaller batch for myself just to try it. i did make a few changes. instead of browning the bacon right away, i went ahead and made the mixture of cheese and mushroom stems first. if you want your mushrooms to have a more interesting texture, make your bacon at the end, and make it crispy. also, dont diced up the bacon into really tiny pieces. make them a bit larger. then, mix up the hot bacon with the cheese and mushrooms and bake. the cheese melts a little faster from the hot bacon, and it gives it a great texture. just be quitting the bacon mixed up and in the oven. sizzle away!

I was all ready to start preaching about plagerism and how this recipe was word-for-word like the recipe on the Giorgio Baby Bella (crimini) packaging.  Only then did I notice (in teeny tiny itty bitty print) at the bottom of the Giorgio recipe that it was "courtesy of allrecipes.com".  :o)  These were very good and enjoyed by all.

Wonderfully simple and tasty recipe for stuffed mushrooms.   The changes I made were to add 1/8 tsp. black pepper and 1 minced garlic clove to the onion/stem sauté before stuffing the mushroom caps.  I also used half cheddar cheese and half monterey jack cheese for a milder cheese flavor.

Well, I know this says "BACON and Cheddar Stuffed Mushrooms", but I omitted the bacon because I am a vegetarian. Instead, I used a green bell pepper which I sauteed with the onion, and a little bit of garlic.  I also added a little black pepper, cayenne pepper, and parsley to the mix. It turned out great even without the bacon!

Super easy and very tasty.  Next time I would add garlic, parsley, perhaps some cream cheese...the flavors were good but I felt like something was missing and I'm having a hard time putting my finger on it.  I had 10 mushrooms. I used half an onion and doubled the bacon. Sliced the bacon into smaller bits before cooking. Drained some of the grease but not all. Threw in the onion and chopped mushroom stems when the bacon was about half cooked.  Skipped the butter, but added black pepper. This cut down significantly on dirty dishes and time. Shredded the cheddar while the onions and mushroom stems were cooking and then mixed the cheese in after taking the cast iron pan off the heat. Topped with cheddar, popped in oven as stated. Fabulous.  I would have given five stars if that extra element of flavor was there. There is room for this recipe to grow into something even better. So four stars.

We hardly had any food in the house and when I found this recipe, I was trying to make a meal with what I had. Because of that, I made some significant changes, but used this recipe as the foundation.  My girlfriend and I loved them. We will be making these again.  Changes from the recipe: We had some red bell pepper laying around so we diced and sauteed them with the onion/mush stem mixture.  Once we had stuffed them, I brushed them with a little garlic teryaki sauce and wrapped them in more bacon before putting them in the oven.  We lowered the temp to 325 to accommodate the bacon, so I think it took about 30 mins.  They were sooooo good!

Made this to go along with a light dinner we were having because I had the ingredients.  I went to try one, and my husband ate them all!!!  But he said they were delicious, obviously.  Easy to make.  I used baby bella mushrooms, because that is wheat I had on hand and made about 14 of them.  They did smell very good and were very easy to make.  I will definately make them again, mostly so I can try one!

I used Hormel real bacon bits to cut a corner. Instead of butter I used olive oil. I added in some garlic and didn't really measure anything. I used baby bellas for the stuffing and they gave them a meatier taste. The only complaint I have is that they got kinda soggy from all of the liquid that came out. Next time I think I'm going to bake them on a cooling rack with a drip pan underneath. They were SO yummy!! :)

I made these for some guest from the UK for thanksgiving appetizers and they loved them.  Even my father, who never eats mushrooms, loved them.   After reading the preceeding reviews, I did the following: - Used turkey bacon -Added a clove of garlic with the onions. -Added some multigrain breadcrumbs to soak up some the liquid -Added the cheese and some plain nonfat yogurt to the mixture just to hold it together.

I made this with some leftover little mushrooms I had. They turned out really well and were super easy.  The one problem I had was that they were a bit salty but I think that was because I used bacon bits instead of cooking my own bacon strips

Scrumptious!  The second time I made them, I added a chopped harboiled egg, some chives and a pinch of paprika to the bacon and cheeses filling - even better.

Very good. I made a very basic italian casserole and was looking for a side dish that would make dinner more fun. I used I slice bacon per mushroom. I also added crumbled beef links, only becasue I had some in the fridge and didn't want them to go bad. I put lots of the mixture on each mushroom, kept them in the oven only long enough to melt the cheese, and when they came out the cheese was melted inside and down the sides too. It was soo good.

I used button mushrooms because it was all I had on hand, and these were great.  A nice change from a cream cheese stuffed mushroom.  Thank you for a keeper!

This was like Bacon/Cheddar Skins except mushrooms instead of potato.   THIS was an excellent recipe.  Followed the advice of several people adding onion powder and garlic powder....A pinch of parsley flakes.   Great for an appetizer!  And like a previous viewer said, The mix would be great to stuff chicken with.   Endless ideas.  Great recipe!

Honestly, I love stuffed mushrooms so I would probably rate a cream cheese stuffed mushrooms similarly.  I fried the bacon in a pan over low heat and then I drained the bacon on paper towels.  I omitted the butter and sautéed the onions and mushroom stems in the bacon grease.  Keep the temperature and time the same.  I really enjoyed this one!  Will make again…thanks.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made a few changes when I prepared it. I used Mozzarella instead of Cheddar and real bacon bits instead of fresh bacon, because it's what I had on hand. I also used about 10 regular white button mushrooms because the store didn't have any Crimini. To prevent the mushrooms from drying and shriveling while baking, I tossed the caps in melted butter before stuffing them. I poured the leftover butter in the bottom of the glass casserole dish I baked them in, but I'm sure it would be fine without the extra-decadence. The baking time was perfect. They were very juicy and gooey but not messy at all. We didn't have to use our napkins to wipe our hands much, even though the caps had soaked in butter. I would definitely at least double or triple this recipe for any social gathering because they would go fast I'm sure. It's super easy to prepare.

These were really good.  I added a little bit of fresh chopped chives because I had them on hand.  I served them with dinner, but I think I would prefer them better as an appetizer.  My cousin suggested I try adding some diced tomatoes next time & I think I will.  Thanks for sharing, I'll be making these again!

Wow!  These were a huge hit at a party I took them to.  The only complaint was that there weren't enough.  Next time I am going to make at least 4 times as much.  They are so easy!  I did want to make sure they were nice and done so after 15 min. I took them out and covered them with foil then turned the oven off and left them in there for another 15 min.  I also used a mini muffin tin to bake them in, each mushroom fit perfectly in the holes.

My family loved this recipe, definitely a keeper.  Made exactly as stated, but I do think I will try pre-cooked, crumpled, real bacon to save time.  Also, my husband requested the addition of chopped jalapeno next time.

Amazing stuffed mushrooms. I tripled the recipe, brought them to a pot luck this evening and they were all gone within 5 minutes. I used precooked bacon which saved on some time and tasted just as great. I also added fresh garlic, cracked pepper and roasted red pepper seasoning - delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic and easy...used bacon leftover from breakfast and red onions (all I had on hand).  Used 2% milk cheddar cheese to cut back on fat. Chopped the bacon and reheated in a skillet.  This produced grease again and allowed me to cut the butter in half and cook the diced onion with the bacon as it reheated. So easy and everyone of my guests raved about them!

Great recipe! I used 2 8-oz. boxes of small mushrooms instead of the ones called for, and the stuffing perfectly filled them. Just one thing wrong - they didn't last long enough! We loved 'em!

These are so delicious! I used a grapefruit spoon to scoop out the stems from the mushroom caps. My boyfriend is obsessed with these, when I am making them he is constantly "sampling" the filling.

I was expecting them to taste alot different from the ones that I make (mushrooms stuffed with cheese and herbs), but they didn't.  The water from the mushroom made them very messy and the oil from the cheese and bacon made them look not so tasty.  Everyone loved them and so did I but I didn't think they were anything special.

My husband & I make these together for parties and they are always the first appetizer gone!   We don't bother to saute the onions as they end up softening in the oven.  Skipping this step allows us to omit the butter; the bacon provides enough fatty flavor that you don't miss it.

In a word....FANTASTIC!  I used just regular mushrooms as that is what I had on hand, but the next time I will use the crimini...either way though, the stuffing was amazing.  Certainly a keeper!

Awesome recipe! So simple and delicious.  I took someone's suggestion and used sharp cheddar cheese.  It was a hit at the dinner party we attended.  Next time, I'll double the recipe.

I've tried this and Angie Zayac's "Mouth-Watering Stuffed Mushrooms", and it's a toss up. That one is very creamy, this one is more savory with the bacon and cheddar. I like them both. Really good.

Pretty good.  I liked them well enough, spouse LOVED them.  They taste like they need *something*...though I'm not sure.  Perhaps I just didn't bake them long enough.
Will likely make them again.

Incredibly easy and fast. My friends ate them up and asked for more! I just used button mushrooms and they turned out great!

Excellent and so easy!  My husband and I didn't even like mushrooms before we tried this recipe, but now we make it whenever we have guests over.  Everyone always loves them and there isn't enough left over for us!  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

These were very good. I used really big mushrooms, though, and they were dry. If you use big shrooms, try putting a little butter or red wine in the pan when you bake them.

These were delicious.  I could not find portobello mushrooms, so I used the small button ones.  It was a pain to "scoop out" the insides of the mushrooms, but other than that, it was very easy.  My family all loved them.  I added some fresh garlic and sauteed the bacon and garlic in with the onions and the mushrooms for a few minutes longer...YUMMY!

Wow!  I couldn't find my mom's recipe for stuffed mushrooms, so last minute, I looked this recipe up. Sure glad I did! I am taking these as appetizers to my husbands firestation for Thanksgiving lunch today.... I am excited to see if others enjoy them as much as I did!  Thanks!  Side note: I used garlic cheddar cheese in some and brie cheese in the others.  Both are GREAT - the brie is a much more mild flavor.

Had to use button mushrooms as any other type are very hard to find here. Also added some minced garlic to them for a little extra flavor. They were excellent, even my kids ate them....Great Recipe. Thanks.....

The only thing to do differently is to bake the mushrooms a bit first to get rid of the moisture in the cups so when you see the mushroom caps filled with water take out and dump out the moisture then fill

This was wonderful. I used 3 cheese blend with extra mozzarella. Cooked all ingredients together except mushroom caps. After stuffing mushrooms put extra stuffing on to of them. More stuffing than the tops can hold  I put it in a foil pack and popped it in the crock pot so it  wouldn't heat the house up.  I cooked in crock pot for about 1 and 1/2 hours.

Super easy and super good. I made them once without modifications and then I made them again and changed a whole bunch of stuff. The original recipe is good, but some people may find it a little bland. If so, try adding garlic, parsley, parmesan and oregano to the stuffing. If you're worried about it being greasy, you can add some bread crumbs, too. Either way, it's a great snack or side dish for a light entree.

In the process of making these now. If you follow the recipe it'll take longer than 30 minutes total to cook this. 15 min to cook bacon, 10 minutes to cook mushroom stems,  15 minutes to cook stuffed mushrooms, and that is not counting cleaning and chopping time.

They all went!  A sure sign of success.  But a word to the wise.  The ingredients as written was twice as much as needed to fill my mushrooms.  I bought medium to small for ease in eating as finger food.  Thankfully, I bought twice as many mushrooms and figured I would do something with the remainder.  So one recipe of the filling for me filled double the mushrooms.  They were great, however.  Everyone loved them!

They were pretty bland on taste. I will look for something with more spice and maybe some parmesan cheese. I like a lot of spice with my foods.

I added green chili and mozzarella cheese to the mix and they were absolutely delicious. My non mushrooms hating family members enjoyed these with no complaints. It was a little bit too oily so next time I will not use so much butter. Can't wait to try these again for a potluck event.

These were perfect ... especially because I had gluten sensitive friends attending.  I made exactly as written the first time but the second time I added minced garlic and a bit of spice to add additional ZING.

I have not actually made this yet, but have a question for anyone who has...can you make this ahead of time and refrigerate it? I want to make it for a baby shower but need to keep it cold for a 2 hour drive.   Any input would be really appreciated!

I used a cast iron skillet to sauté the stems them used the same pan for the filled mushrooms in the  oven. The recipe was delicious! The leftover filling made a great topping for baked potatoes.

I've made these multiple times, and they are always a big hit.  I do add bread to the stuffing, as suggested.  I dice two slices of good sandwich bread, then bake them in the oven until the are dry before adding them to the stuffing.  I love the different texture they add, and the mushrooms are less dense.

My husband loved this. The only changes I made was to make about 5 times the amount and used 6 large mushroom caps instead of the small ones and bought some already pre-sliced mushrooms to take place of the stems when I cooked them. He said this would be phenomenal if we were to add it in top of a burger (since we used the large ones.) I don't like mushrooms and I even thought this was pretty good.

I think I will probably use bigger mushrooms next time, just because the flavor of the stem mix was rather overwhelming compared to others. Otherwise, it was extremely tasty!

Personally, I don't like mushrooms, but I made this for my wife. We didn't have any cheddar, so I put in a mix of pepper jack and colby jack cheese instead. She absolutely loves it. According to her, they are the best she's ever had!

The dish was also incredibly easy to make. Well done!

These were awesome!  I also added a tbsp of panko bread crumbs and 1/2 clove of garlic.  I swapped out the cheddar cheese for 1/2 cup of blue cheese.  I am a big fan of using a kitchen scissors so when i cook bacon intended to be crumbled I start by peeling off how many strips I need in one chunk and then cut with the scissors into the pan before cooking.

If you have a food processor, use that to sauté and mix the stems, onions, and bacon together. Once this is done, really cram and press as much filling in the mushroom as possible.  You will be surprised how much you will be able to stuff in there.  Then sprinkle cheese over the mushroom/filling.

Very good, just a bit salty.  I'm going to try using reduced-fat cheddar next time.  Otherwise great texture.  Oh!  And check on them on the low end of the recommended cooking time.  They're not very forgiving with even the slightest overcook.  Tasty though and worth the effort.  Thank you!

This is a good flavor combination. I did add some onion roll breadcrumbs, and I made sure I drained the bacon very well on paper towels. After reading other reviews, I added some chopped fresh sage and a dash or two of Spike seasoning to kick things up a notch. My hubby liked them, which is unusual because he doesn't like new things.

I have made these a couple different ways. It's perfect without any changes. The first time I made it I did add a small amount of cream cheese to the filling for a creamier version. It's the perfect appetizer for any party. If your short on time, you can decrease prep time, and use real bacon bits, and skipped the onions. Perfect!

I made these for Thanksgiving this year and my husband asked me to make them again for Christmas. He LOVED them! I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because I did alter the recipe a bit. I wanted a little creamier stuffing than just melted cheddar would give so I added 4oz of cream cheese, I kept the same amount of shredded cheddar. I also added a little bit of garlic powder, about 1/8 tsp. Yummy!

Excellent recipe! Made 30 to take to a party. I baked a full pound of low sodium bacon for a consistent doneness then cut that up. As others did, I used the bacon grease to cook the mushrooms and onions. Since some mentioned that the finished mushrooms were greasy, I used 50% less fat cheddar. A handful of Gouda and Gorgonzola were then thrown in the cheese mixture. (About 3 cups cheese total as per the serving size calculator). No need for bread crumbs thankfully. I also added a teaspoon of thyme to the cheese mixture to give an herbier flavor. As someone else suggested, I brushed the mushrooms with olive oil using a garlic infused oil. Very tasty!

I make this often. My husband will bring home all ingreds with a "please" smile on his face. I also add small bits of bread to decrease the oil. So simple and easy to make, we all just love them at my house..

I made these exactly according to the recipe for a Thanksgiving appetizer (doubled the recipe) and they were gone within minutes.  Everyone loved them and several asked for the recipe. I have since made them for almost every family event on request and every time they disappear quickly. I can't show up without these things!

To me it's missing something, maybe another type of cheese.  My husband on the other hand loved it the way it is.

Very delicious.  I wish someone else was here to try them! I added some diced jalapeno, which added a nice crunch and a touch of flavor/color. The only downside is that I made a total mess of my kitchen.  Also, they turned out a little wet, but resting them on a paper towel after baking did the trick.

These are great and easy to make I made these with small porta bellas and the big porta bella caps I have also added crab meat to the mix for the big caps and that was a big hit this mix is good for 3 big caps. I also used green onions instead.

This recipe has won me two consecutive Christmas  appetizer contests at work. It is a fairly easy recipe to ramp up to 50-60 servings.  The biggest challenge was cutting off all of the stems.  My 60 mushrooms lasted less than 15 minutes each year.  Prior to cooking they refrigerate very well, so i could prep them the night before and just toss them in the oven right before the party.

I made these for a crowd of 14 last night and they were a big hit!  Who doesn't love cheese, bacon and mushrooms?!  I added some garlic powder, dried parsley flakes (for color) and some bread crumbs.  They were very good!

Easy, Tasty, WONDERFUL! I serve them at all our get together and they are always requested now. LOVE LOVE LOVE! I use bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon. Much more simple and just as good.

I've never had stuffed mushrooms before so I'm not sure what other stuffed mushrooms taste like but I thought these were really good. They did have a lot of juices inside of them that ran down my chin!! I don't think I cooked them for the whole 20 minutes more like 10-15 and they were really soft and tender.

I made these for a Christmas potluck at work and they were a real hit, also I have exchanged the bacon for spicy sausage and they turned out great. I now get asked to bring them to alot of pot lucks and different events.

These mushrooms are always a hit at parties and are there are never any leftovers.  I use regular mushrooms and cook about 6 slices of bacon because I peel the fatty part off before chopping it.  I sprinkle the tops with red pepper flakes before baking.

Great recipe! I didn't have bacon on hand, so I substituted the precooked bacon bits. They were still gobbled up. I did follow another's suggestion and brushed the mushrooms with melted butter before baking. They were SO moist!

These are wonderful! Just made these the other night, and my husband ate them up. I did what other viewers suggested and used real bacon pieces. I did add a bit of garlic powder while cooking the stems and onion.

These mushrooms are OUTSTANDING! I made them once and went shopping again the next day for the ingredients to make it again! ADDICTING. 
The only things I did differently was use green onions in place of regular onions(I'm not big on eating onions but do like the flavor), I also put the mushroom caps on a plate & nuked them till soft.....Just wonderful! Don't think about it, just make'em!

These mushrooms were delicious! I substituted real bacon pieces for the cooked bacon, green onion for onion, and 2% reduced fat cheddar for the cheese. It turned out perfectly! I will definitely make these again.

We loved these!  My family thought these were great!  I made a double batch for us on a Sunday afternoon watching football and they were gone in a hurry!  I did use real bacon bits instead of the bacon and they turned out really well!  I'll definitely make these again!

This recipe wasn't that impressive.  First of all, there was only enough stuffing to fill half of the caps.  Second, the filling wasn't that spectacular as far as flavor was concerned.  I think I won't be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving because a family member is on a no carb diet.  I wanted him to have something special too and he loved them!  Even my kids, who dislike mushrooms, loved these!  I will definately make them again.

These were great! I do agree with others that they were a little on the bland side. Next time I'm going to chop up some garlic and sautee it with the onion for more flavor. The crimini shrooms at my market were really small, so I just used large button mushrooms instead.

Made these as apps for a party.  They turned out okay (hence the 3 stars) but the taste was sort of bland and nothing exceptional.  Will not make again.

My whole family loved the stuffed mushrooms. Everyone thought it took me hours to make. The filling actually made 10 mushrooms in total. To cut a little calories, I used 1/4 cup of fat free cheddar cheese. 
Thank you!

These are so delicious and addictive! I love the recipe as is and I look forward to trying it with other cheeses. I added a bit more salt to the mixture before stuffing the mushrooms, but other than that followed the recipe to a T.

I followed the directions exactly and had some filling left over at the end. These aren't bad, but so fatty and greasy they lose their allure! I probably won't make them again, though everyone loved them.

FANTASTIC!  I made this to take to a "Hail and Farewell" (Navy) party last night.  Since it was rated 5 stars, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  For my tastes, though, I think I'd cut back on the amount of butter.  Otherwise, they were super YUM!  They were the first appetizer to disappear!  I had many good comments.  I made 40, and made sure I had my sample at home!  Thanks for the hit!  :)

Bacon, cheese, and mushrooms...could it really get any better?  Not really!!!  These were DELICIOUS!!!...although a little greasy.  Hmm...maybe a different type of cheese would help?

Excellent.  I have used this recipe with regular white mushrooms and baby bella mushrooms and it tasted great with both.  I used others suggestions and chopped up extra mushrooms instead of using the stems.  Thanks for sharing!

Used regular mushrooms, but big ones and doubled the bacon. It was great and it dissapeared really fast!

Amazing.  I prepared them as an appetizer for a dinner I had and they went really fast. I used large mushrooms instead of the ones called for and they still worked out really well!

I made these stuffed mushrooms for a side dish last night, and they were wonderful. I used turkey bacon instead of regular pork bacon, because I don't eat pork.  I also added parmesan and extra cheddar cheeses to the tops of them, (I really LOOOOOOVE cheese!) and some freshly ground pepper. My whole family liked them a lot too.  I will definately make these again.  Thanks Krista!

Great recipe! My guests loved these. I too used pre-cooked crumbled bacon (so my kitchen didn't smell like a greasy-spoon). Will definitely make again!

These were good, but not spectacular.  I added some minced garlic while sauteing the onion and chopped stems.  No complaints from anyone, but no one raved about them either.

We prepared these for our Christmas Eve dinner.  We decided not to add the stems as many others mentioned in their reviews.  Added some minced garlic to the mix and ENJOYED!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Wonderful and Easy! I brought these in for an office party, keeping them warm on a hot plate. They were gone in 5 min!! Three people asked me for the recipe! I used sharp cheddar and could not find any portabellini mushrooms so I used the white button mushrooms you can find in the grocery store. I also did not cut up the stems as sugguested in the recipe.  A big hit!!!

I am teaching Home Economics to 7th thru 11th grade girls at a private Christian school.  I used this recipe for the first of 6 dishes the girls will prepare.  The entire staff gave us rave reviews and even girls who didn't care for mushrooms like this one!

I was unable to find the porcini mushrooms in my supermarket, but I tried the recipe with plain white "button" mushrooms for a party, and they were a hit, and no-one even knew that I had used turkey bacon (which crumbles very easily once cooked) to reduce the fat content.  I will definitely make these again in the future.

This was a wonderful recipie - we had it as a  light lunch today and will make it again many times in the future.  It would be great to make for company.
