This was REALLY, REALLY good...the brandy and cream combine nicely for a rich flavorful, but not too heavy sauce.  The Granny Smith apples add the perfect tartness! My husband is a very talented chef in a fine dining restaurant, and I am not easily impressed! I will make it again. I served it over a balsamic rosotto and garnished with fresh thyme. Yum!

Thanks for the review, I'm glad you enjoyed my recipe! I love the flavor of the apple brandy, but for those who prefer a non-alcohol version, apple juice or cider can be substituted for the brandy with excellent results. Happy cooking and eating! Kaye Perry.

I cut back on the thyme and used apple juice with a splash of regular brandy. Turned out great - very succulent and flavorful. Sauce was delicious with  mashed potatoes. Thanks!

I found this dish awesome! I wsa hesitant to try it since it had so few ratings, but I am glad I did! I used the apple jack. I really loved this dish. Reminded me of a stroganoff but with pork and apple. YUM!

I prepared this recipe and used apple juice instead of brandy. I wasn't impressed with this recipe, although my boyfriend liked it. I found that the thyme taste was way too overpowering. If I was to do this recipe again, I would probably only put half the thyme.
Overall, I think this was just an 'ok' recipe.

The sauce seemed really overpowering, yet strangely didn't flavor the pork chops much. Good ingredients, but wrong proportions. Specifically, I'd recommend cutting down on the applejack. I thought I might get buzzed just eating one serving!

I never have been a big fan of pork chops.  They just didn't taste like much.  But I found this recipe after buying a bottle of Applejack Brandy and wanted some recipes for it.  All I can say is.. WOW!!!  I love pork chops now!!  They were delicious and the sauce is so flavorful.  Served them with steamed asparagus and backed potato.  It was a huge hit with my husband too!

My husband makes this for me for special meals.  Last month my mom and sister came to visit.  They were totally impressed.
You should try this recipe.

Delicious, and a crowd pleaser for my family of four.  The only issue I had is with the cooking time -- I used thicker pork chops (approximately 1.5" thick) and should have browned them longer initially as the chops were not up to temperature when I was ready to serve.  I will clearly adjust the cooking time if I use similar chops.  That aside, the dish was very good.
