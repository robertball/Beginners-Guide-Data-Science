I usually use quite a bit more conrstarch and instead of low heat stirring constantly, I've found that med-low heat and stirring occasionally thickens it up better. I always serve over pastry shells, I tried it once over rice and it just wasn't the same! Quick, easy and tasty, base recipe but even better with some spices. This is a staple for our household and now I finally use my leftover chicken instead of tossing it out 2 weeks later! Most recently, I used my leftover chicken from 'crumb-coated chicken thighs' (on this site) and the seasoning made it OUTSTANDING. I was a little leary at first that it would be too much, but it wasn't. Yum, yum, yum!! If you have plain leftover chicken, try 1/4 tsp each of ground cumin, paprika, chili powder and curry powder for starters. Stir the spices in when you add the chicken its really good stuff! Never any leftovers of this one.

I had high hopes for this one, and the flavor was really quite good.  However, I "stirred constantly" for 25 minutes and it never thickened.

I loved this recipe.  It was a nice warm meal on a cold day.  The only changes I made were to add a few more veggies.  I recommend and will make this again.

I gave this a 5 based on it's ease and use of leftovers. I made this with a few changes however. I'm sure as is, it's a tasty as can be but I don't like canned milk or cornstarch. Thusly, I started with a little over two cups of cut up left over roast chicken, into the big fry pan with that along with two cups of chicken broth, about a cup of last nights leftover wild rice and another 1/2 cup of leftover green beans and another cup of mixed frozen veggies, got that to simmerin like it says.  From there in another pot, I made a simple bechamel using 2 tbsp butter, 3 tbsp flour and 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of cream. That thickened up immediately and I added it to the chicken mixture. Served it with baking powder biscuits and it was a great warm yummy leftover dinner. Of note, I added absolutley zero seasoning but it could use some pepper. With the butter and cream this goes about 180 calories per serving not including the biscuits.

This was very easy and good.  Even my picky 8 year old loved it.  I used frozen corn rather than the mixed vegs that none of my kids will eat.  I also used a little over a tablespoon of cornstarch to make sure it thickened.  Thanks, Sandy, for a new and simple recipe!

This was ok, a little bland and I had to add 3 tsp. more cornstarch to make it thicker otherwise it would be way too runny. But it is a great recipe when you want a quick meal and don't feel like making a mess (only uses 1 saucepan and 1 small bowl)

Very good! I tend to eye rather than measure, so I may not have added the amounts exactly, but this was delicious! I served it over homemade buttermilk biscuts. I used a combination of chicken stock and white wine for the base and added about 1/3 cup of frozen onion seasoning mix and a pinch of garlic powder and red pepper.

One thing I notice is that there's no mention of bringing the mixture to a boil after adding the cornstarch.  This may be why some people haven't been able to get the gravy to thicken.

This recipe was good, but the sauce was too thin.  I added more corn starch. Also, I chopped the chicken too small with a chopper.  I think it would have been better with chunks of chicken.

This came out soooo good!! I had leftover pieces of KFC so I pulled and diced the meat. Then used frozen corn,canned diced potatoes and canned carrots. Also added a touch of nutmeg and sage. I had no problemwith the consistency, maybe due to using canned veges. Served over grands biscuits. Delish!!!!!

Good concept but way too thin, even when I doubled the cornstarch.  Next time I will go back to my old stand-by - making a roux first with 4 tablespoons butter, 4 tablespoons flour and 2 cups of mixed milk and chicken broth.  By the way, when you make anything with leftover chicken, it's good to add sage and parsley - just seems to fit really well.

Excellent! It definitely needs at least 1/2 tsp more of the cornstarch to thicken, I also added some parmesan cheese. My husband raved over it & it was so easy! Thanks!

I didn't like the evaporated milk in this.  It would have been much better had I gone with my insticts and made a white sauce with butter, flour and fresh milk which thickens well and tastes much better.

This was tasty, but very thin. I tried adding more cornstarch, still thin. I served it on biscuits. This would have bee very good if it thickened. I also think it could use some cooked onion.

very good.  Both my husband and I enjoyed this thoroughly. I needed a recipe that was quick and this fit bill very well. The veggies I used were peas and corn.   I had individual pie shells in the freezer which I baked and placed over each serving.

I'm actually rating this before eating it, but it sure looks good.  I doubled the receipe (since I had more than 1 cup of chicken left over) and only added about 2 teas. of extra cornstarch.  I made sure it came to a boil as someone had mentioned and then let it thicken as it sat on low.  Served it over the large buscuits.  Had plenty for left overs the next day!

Had lots of KFC chix left over and needed a quick filling supper for the family.  Adding the wine (actually didn't need much at all) gave the sauce a great flavor.  I also used quite a bit of corn with peas and carrots.  The corn added a crunchy texture to what would have been a  "mushy" meal when I mixed it with noodles.  Everyone liked the dish...I would make it again.

Very good!  A great way to use up my leftover chicken!  I added the curry, chili powder, paparika and ground cumin that someone else mentioned and it was really great!!  I did add 1 TBS of cornstarch instead of 2 TSP (it's only 1 TSP more) it seemed to help thicken it up better.  I served it over rice but I think it would be great over potatoes too!!

Thanks!!

This is a great recipe for leftovers.  The chicken broth gives it a nice flavor and it isn't heavy like the soup-based chicken ala king.  My family thought it was a hit.

I loved this, and surprisingly my husband did too. Since I had way more than the one cup of chicken and my cans of broth and evaporated milk were also larger then amount called for I doubled the recipe. Served over toast the first night - then the 2nd night I used what was left to make a pot pie. Used frozen pie crusts, peeled and diced a couple potatoes and boiled them until tender. After draining potatoes well,  put them in the bottom of the pie crust then poured a la king mixture on top, then put top crust on and sealed and baked for 30 min @ 400 degress F. It came out golden brown. I let this set for about 20 min before cutting into it. It sliced beautifully... not too runny, not too dry.
And just like that... We had a new favorite! 
Thanks for sharing!

Great way to use left-over chicken. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used some homo instead and it was fine. I also added some worcestershire sauce for flavouring.

I don't have much luck with corn starch, so judge this review accordingly.  This was a complete disaster - it burned before it thickened and was inedible.

This was really tasty!!  I have always made a roux and added milk for a white sauce in the past, but this was more flavorful with the chicken stock added.  Be careful not to over use the cornstarch thickening agent; if you do, you shoud start with a larger can of evaporated milk.  This was easy and fast, and my hubbie said to make this again!  Served over big biscuits.  YUM!

This is so easy to prepare. I love it! I followed someone elses idea of adding 1 tsp. of curry powder and a little extra corn starch for thickening. Thanks for the recipe.

Very bland. I used 1/2 c. dry sherry and 1c. broth. I also added 2T. of Adams Reserve White Wine Garlic spice, dash of cayenne, 1/2 t. garlic salt, 1/2 t. onion powder, 1t. smoked paprika, 1T. Worcestershire, and 3T. Parmesan. I served it over rice. I also had to use more corn starch and higher heat to thicken it. Next time I will add more chicken. With these changes it was quite good, but I changed the recipe quite a bit. That is why the low rating.

I was looking for something quick and easy to stretch a small amount of leftover chicken into another full meal and found this recipe. We enjoyed it served over pastry shells with a side salad. I suggest  thickening it up over med-low heat and a touch more cornstarch.

I used my leftover rotisserie chicken and made this tonight.  Used 1/2 can of corn and 1/2 can of green beans plus a few sliced baby carrots.  No cornstarch so I used flour.  Mine got thick and it tasted delicious.  I served it over rice.  It was a great way to use up my leftovers.

I actually haven't made this yet for my 40 senior citizens, but this used a slurry of four instead of cornstarch. Any comments? I'm  always leaning towards non-gmo flour. :)

We loved it! :) Added (as other reviewer suggested), 1/4 tsp. cumin, paprika, and curry - then threw in a packet of adobo. Family said it was "southwestern chicken a la king." Served over fresh open biscuits. Its a winner..

Very easy & tasty.  I did use fresh carrots, celery, and frozen corn as a substitute, which was very good. I like to use fresh if I have the time.  I ended up adding more cornstarch as well...just mixed a little with a small amount of cold water & added to mixture.  Would also work great as a chicken potpie filling.

Used the remains of my slow-cooker chicken (used in chicken noodle soup), and used a 12 oz can of evap milk (who has a 5 oz size on hand?!?) with about 2 TBSP cornstarch to accomodate the extra liquid. Even with that, it still seemed thin. Maybe I didn't let it cool long enough?? It was "thick" b/c of all the chicken/veggies I had in it. Tasted fine though.

I thought this went over very well!  I used 1 cup chicken broth, 1/4 cup white cooking wine and 1/4 cup water.  I used probably a TBSP of cornstarch, but at the very end, when it still wasn't thickening, I removed about 2 TBSP of the liquid and added a tiny bit of flour to make a paste.  When I added it back in it thickened up nicely.  I added various spices that we like, served it over rice, and everyone ate a bunch!  Thanks for the recipe!

Enjoyed the recipe very much.  Quick, easy and a great way to use a small amount of leftover chicken. I did use a little more cornstarch than called for to thicken it.  My husband asked for his over rice and cleaned his plate while I spooned mine over cresent rolls. Good on a cold evening!  Thanks again.

I just made this using leftover turkey roast and peas. We had it over rice. Everyone liked it, which is quite an accomplishment considering we are a family of eight! I did have to more than double the amount of cornstarch, but eventually it thickened. Thanks for a new "regular" for a large, fussy family.

Very good. I used extra cornstarch after reading some of the other reviews, but still had trouble getting it to thicken. I ended up using some flour and it did the trick.  I also used some different spices that I had on hand to give it more flavor.

This was OK, but I don't think the mix of frozen vegetables I used (carrots, peas, corn, green beans, and lima beans) was the best for this dish.  I missed having green peppers in it.  But I added a can of mushroom pieces and stems, and served it over wheat toast.  But it was quick, easy, and fairly good.  I also used more cornstarch than called for.

This wasn't very flavorful, in my opinion. The sauce never did thicken up. A good use for leftover chicken and easy, but I don't think I'll make this again.

Overall this was great. The taste was average, although my 2 year-old ate it up, but this was so easy to make and didn't require condensed soup (which one cannot find here in Germany).
