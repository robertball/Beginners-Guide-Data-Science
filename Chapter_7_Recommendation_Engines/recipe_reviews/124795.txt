I thought this was so good!!! i would actually give this a 4.5.  I made a few changes, instead of using green chilis and red pepper, I just used a green pepper.  I also served them on tortillas.  VERY GOOD!!!  My husband liked. :)  Thanks

We liked the chicken marinade on this one.  I was a little short on the lime so added some lemon juice.  I did cook my red peppers with my onion and add garlic to the pan also.  When I got started I found I did not have green chilies so I sub a little salsa verde.. very good.  I did not add the almonds because my son does not like them... the top off would have been if I did have an avacodo.  I will make this again and again..... thank you so much...

This salad was absolutely delicious! I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and we grilled everything, just a preference. I heated the marinade and served over the salad. I will definitely make this again!

I subbed garlic powder for the minced garlic, green bell peppers for the chilies and left out the almonds.  I also added season salt and sugar to the marinade.  I made a second batch of the marinade which I kept off the chicken to use as the dressing for this.  What a great summer weeknight meal!

This was really good. I used the full amount of marinade for only two servings of chicken, but I doubled the amount of garlic and I used fresh oregano. Next time I will leave the almonds out.

This was okay, but I had to make a few changes to make it good.  It definitely needed salt, plus I added some Mexican chili powder and a lot more cumin and oregano.  I didn't have any avocado, which I'm sure would have been a great addition to this dish.  I will make this again, but with the addition of more spices as well as making sure to have avocado to top it off.

I added guacamole, sour cream, corn salsa and shredded cheese. Never had almonds on one before but it is intereting.

chicken was a nice mild with a balance spice. I cooked up a few pounds of breast meat according to this recipe and used for a cob salad instead.

Really good salad, made a great lunch. I had a chicken breast left over from some other recipes so I marinated it while I cooked dinner then I cooked it with some diced red, yellow and orange bell peppers, red onion and mushrooms then put it in a seperate tupperware form the salad and tomato so I could warm it up and place it on the salad before eating it for lunch. I forgot to add the green chiles OOPS and I left out the almonds and the avacado because I didn't have them. Turned out great, I will make this again for lunch. I used some salsa on top and that was it for the dressing.

I used this recipe to make fajitas. Excellent flavor. A hit with the family as well as little preparation time.
