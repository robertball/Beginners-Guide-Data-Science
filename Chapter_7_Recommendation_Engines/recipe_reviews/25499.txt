I've made these several times, and they are always a big hit.  I modify the recipe as follows:
*For the onion I substitute green onions with tops.
*I've substituted portobello mushrooms.  (With so little stem, I chop up and add some white or crimini mushrooms and add to the saute.)
*I add a tablespoon or so of bread crumbs when I add the flour.
*I don't add parsley (because of the green onion tops.)
*I substitute gorgonzola for the swiss cheese!!!
Enjoy!

My husband said they were better than the ones they make in the restaurant!  12 were not enough!
I used portabella mushroom, because they have the most flavor.  I didn't have parsley, so I didn't add it and it still came out very nice.  I also took the advice from the other reviews and added 1 tbls bread crumbs and lots of garlic with the onion mixture.
Next time I am going to experiment with adding parmesan cheese to the onion mixture.

Thank you so much, this one is a definite keeper.

This was a wonderful recipe!!  I love it because you can customize (by adding more or less onion, breadcrumbs, or even lots of garlic).  I even added crab meat too and it was delicious!  Thanks so much!

I made this recipe just as it was written(I always do that the first time). I think the stuffing could be thicker- someone had said some bread crumbs maybe a good idea. But other than that it tasted fantastic!

I just loved this!  Used shallots instead of onions, and we didn't have swiss cheese so I put slices of Brie on top to melt over the mushrooms.  Amazing!

I agree with the other reviewers that there is just TOO much butter!  Also, the mixture was little runny, so bread crumbs would've helped.  Also garlic would've pepped this up a bit.  The flavor was good though.

I used about a third of the butter called for and probably could have used less. They turned out tasty, but nothing special. If I made this again I would definitely add garlic.

This was one of the best appetizers I have ever tasted!  We made these as a small compliment to our meal and they became somewhat of a main course!  They were more than delicious and everyone had three or four of them.  What was best was these had no seafood in them, So my mother, (who is allergic to seafood) could have these.  The swiss cheese was a perfect garnishment and I will for sure be making these again soon.

This recipe was fantastic.  I followed the advise of others and didn't use as much butter, omitted the parsley and added tons of fresh garlic.  They were a hit.  I doubled the recipe and they were gone in a matter of minutes.....YUM!

After reading some of the other reviews I agreed that it was WAY too much butter. I skipped the drizzle part and used probably 3 T. or less to saute stems, onion and two large garlic cloves, adding a bit of red wine as they softened. (Could have used even less butter or maybe part olive oil?) There seemed to be plenty of buttery goodness that overflowed while in the oven! I also tried both baby bella mushrooms and buttons. I found the portabellas held their shape better but both were delicious. I carved into the caps a bit more than just the stem to have more room for filling and more mushroom for stuffing. I then added some Italian bread crumbs to hold it all together. Excellent recipe, just cut down on the butter. Hunny LOVED them!

This review is strictly my husband's opinion because I do not eat mushrooms.  He enjoyed it very much and said "the cheese really made the whole thing come together."

Love this recipe but I always add a bit of minced garlic. I find it a bit runny so I add parmesan cheese and or bread crumbs as well. The mushroom mixture is also good as stuffing for stuffed chicken breasts and stuffing for philo pastry..

MmmMmmmMmmm - these were REALLY good! I made a partial recipe (3 mushrooms) because that is all I had leftover from another recipe (and my husband hates mushrooms,so they were just for me) so I think some of the amounts were off (too much butter) and they were STILL awsome! The one thing I would change is the salt and pepper - I felt it wasn't needed at all (but I'm not a salt person). I also used half and half because I had no cream, and it seemed to thicken just fine, but it was a very small batch. I can't wait to make the full recipe. Very easy to make, too!

WOW! These are amazing. I think they are even better than the ones I have had in many restaurants and not as heavy. I've made them several times and everyone goes crazy over them. I always end up with a little extra stuffing which I happily snack on while the mushrooms are cooking in the oven. Very nice recipe and will become a regular when I host!

Overall good recipe.  Good basis to tweek the ingrediants to customize your own mushrooms.  I added breadcrumbs, garlic, and a splash of white wine.  Recommend that you burn off the wine a little bit.

Defintely not the best mushrooms I've had, but they were still tasty, and I would try to make them again.  I did have to add a lot more seasonings and garlic though.

These were quite tasty and had a great flavor, but were really runny and watery. Not sure if I did something wrong. But won't be making these again.

Not as good as I was hoping...but good nonetheless. Then again, I'd just had a run of dishes that turned out exceptionally well, so maybe I'm judging this one's respectable but unspectacular turnout a little too harshly. I do think I'll try another recipe next time.

I agree that there is just a bit too much butter. Having said that I used 12 medium sized portobella mushrooms and had to use some bread crumbs and chop up about 10 baby bellas to have enough filling. With that said, I only used 4 tbsp. of butter. I liked them but weren't my favorite stuffed mushroom appetizers. The mushroom seemed to overwhelm the filling. Maybe I need to double all of the ingredients for 12 mushrooms. Just an idea! Problem is in a recipe sometimes the 'large fresh mushrooms' are a different size than the ones we use.

OH MY GOODNESS. These are heavenly! The only change I made was that I used slices of swiss cheese instead of shredded (which of course makes no difference in the flavor) because I had it on hand. WOW. Follow the recipe exactly. You won't be disappointed!

I cooked this for our Christmas dinner and everybody loved it. We didn't have any fresh parsley or heavy whipping cream. Instead we used dried parsley and regular 2% milk, just added an extra amount of flour for thickness. Turned out great!

This recipe is so great! The "stuffing" or creme you make to put inside the mushrooms, it tastes soo good! You could use that alone for mushroom soup! There is a little too much butter, maybe a little less?

I made this recipe for New Years Eve for a few  friends. It was well received. I did reduce the butter as previously suggested and only drizzled a couple of tablespoons over the caps prior to stuffing. I also added about 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs to the mixture to thicken the mixture. The results were wonderful. I will definitely make this again.
