Nice Italian twist on classic grilled cheese! These are perfect for a quick and easy lunch. I used a combination of salami and pepperoni. I left out the green pepper as I knew I wouldn't be fond of the "crunch" unless they were cooked separately. I used "Pasta/Pizza Sauce" from this site and kept that on the side for dipping vs. putting it directly on the sandwich. Overall, very good!

I made this as directed with the exception of keeping the pizza sauce on the side.  I was concerned that it might make the bread soggy.  This was just ok for us.  But, not something that we'll be repeating, I'm afraid.

This was a nice change from the typical grilled cheese. I made these with 
tomato sauce that I added italian seasoning and garlic powder to. I used
canadian bacon and sliced medium cheddar
because that's what I had on hand. I
found it easier to put the butter in
the pan rather than to butter the
sides of the bread after assembling.

The kids liked this change. I 
would like to try it with pepperoni.

My school cafeteria used to serve something like this, which they called Pizza Bobs. They used pepperoni and no peppers. Now I make them often with just sauce and cheese and maybe banana peppers. They are best on Italian but you can use white or wheat bread, too. A nice variation on grilled cheese.

What a cleaver idea!   I cook all of my grilled sandwiches over medium heat so it has time to get hot all the way through and the cheese can get nice â€˜n gooey.  I used a combination of hard and Genoa salami that was shaved, so I stacked it for a meatier layer.

These are really yummy.  The only change I made, is that I sauteed the green pepper, a bit.

Yum! I gave it a 4 because it did need some extra seasoning...I added italian seasoning and garlic powder...also everyone should modify the filling to the pizza you enjoy best. I used spicy salami and hot peppers and red onions. A great casual comforting meal - I served it with tomato soup. Thanks for the idea!!

Great twist on the tired old grilled cheese. Adding the salami and the pizza sauce added new zest and flavour! We enjoyed this very much.

Made a simplier version (due to lack of ingredients) with just mozzarella and pepperonies (i microwaved them for about 15 sec on a paper towel to get some of the grease out).  My hubby thought it was tasty!

I haven't actually made the sandwich like the recipe says, but my mama used to make similar sandwiches when I was little. We also had a sandwich maker.. but in college I just made them on the stove. Very simple.. just pizza sauce/cheesy spaghetti sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, and any other favorite pizza toppings!

Weird, but these really do have a pizza flavor. I don't know why I never thought to make a pizza grilled cheese? I seen this recipe on the recipe buzz and had to try it. Plus, it is with ingredients I typically have in the house. I did leave out the salami because I don't care for it and just used white American bread. I sliced the green peppers really thin, but definitely wouldn't end up using a whole pepper for four sandwiches. It did give the sandwich that characteristic pizza flavor though. For the cheese I used 2% milk shredded mozzarella cheese and it worked fine. I bet this would be good with a piece of pepperoni to for people who like that. I will make this again. TY

These are really easy and good!  I made them first following the recipe exactly and then again as open-faced pizza bagels w/ only diced peppers & oregeno.  Both were great!  I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I thought the bagels were a little better.

Opted for combination of hard salami and sandwich pepperoni, and used melted garlic butter.  This is really versatile, as you can add onion, black olives, spinach, whatever you like on pizza!

Awesome! These were fun and quick! I have 3 sons, all who play sports. So on sports nights I try to make something quick for dinner. They loved these! The only thing I did different was add pepperoni instead of salami! I've made these twice now. A new family favorite!

I really enjoyed this sandwich! I used pepperoni and just eyeballed everything to taste. I only had sliced white bread, so I used that. This would be great with just about any pizza toppings you like. I will be expierementing more... Thanks for sharing! :)

I was sooo bored with my usual salami and cheese sandwich, so this was a nice twist. The bread didn't toast very well, but maybe that was because I grilled it in a toaster oven instead of a skillet. I'll try that next time, but it was still delicious. Thanks!

I bought a loaf of italian bread and sliced thick slices at home. The bread was crisp and buttery. The kids and husband loved it! Great sandwiches to make on the weekend while everybody is home and hungry!!!

Obviously use what suits your taste for pizza type toppings but the pizza sauce adds a nice something different to it

It was okay.  As I always do when trying out new recipes, I make it exactly as written the first time, and that is what I'll base my rating on. To me, there's nothing special about it.  The second time, I toasted it in the oven rather than making it grill-cheese style.  I prefer this method, as everything is a little crisper.

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a way to use up some leftover pizza sauce. I used two mini orange and yellow bell peppers and a deli roll since it's what I had on hand. This is great for kids, I'll agree with that. For me, however, it definitely needs some additional spices. Maybe a pinch of oregano, Italian seasoning, or red peppers flakes would be a nice addition. This is a good base recipe, though. Thanks.

Great way to use up salami. I added some pepperoni and used sliced white bread. Turned out great.
