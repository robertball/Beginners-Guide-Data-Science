I was actually surprised how good this was! I have to admit tho, I didn't use the Campbell's soup, I used Herdez instead and although I wouldn't consider this anywhere near authentic Mexican food or chilaquiles, it was really good!

I will definitely make it again! I did add about 1/8-1/4 tsp of salt, which made it perfect for this family.
