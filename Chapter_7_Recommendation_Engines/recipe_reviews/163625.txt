Great guacamole! It's simple and delicious! I cut this back to 8 servings for 2 avocados. I used fresh lime juice vs. lemon juice and added just a bit of garlic and 1/4 tsp. of cumin. Perfect with warm tortilla chips!

One of the best guacamole recies we have found.  It's the way Mexican cooking should be -- quick, easy and delicious ! ! !  The recipe can also eaily be adjusted for personal preferences.

I'm the one who contributed this recipe. 
After reading all the reviews I should add what one of the reviewers said about the quality of the avocados. The should be HAAS. When you buy them at the store the skin shouldn't be too bumpy and soft to touch. Not too soft. Use them as soon as possible as avocados don't have a long shelf life at least the ones that are not hard as a rock. 
  
Adding lime instead of lemon for flavor. It's probably a good call. But otherwise is that SIMPLE!
Keep it that way for best results and if you don't like CILANTRO this is definitely not your recipe. What makes this recipe is the cilantro and green onions do not replace or exchange. 

This recipe is supposed to be simple and without garlic. Those who add cumin, garlic or tomatoes need a different recipe. So don't go by the reviews too much is my experience. Funny you learn that when you submit your own recipe.

Hubs didn't want me to make this and deviate from MY guacamole (which has cumin, jalapeno, garlic and chopped tomato).  I told him I wanted to make this recipe just as is, that you never know, you might just like something even tho' it's unfamiliar.  We tried it.  We liked it.  Hubs said, "It's not as good as yours, but this is pretty 'D' good."  This WAS pretty "D" good.  This "Simply Guacamole" recipe just may be on to something!  Like.....keep it simple.

I haven't made this recipe, but want to comment. The most important thing in good guac is the avacados. You really can't stress that enough. I use Haas. They have to be ripe.  I usually make my guac with some salsa and some lemon juice.  I'm not a big cilantro fan so I leave that out. Sometimes I add green onion if I have it and fresh tomatoes if they are in my garden. :)

This is sooo good. Stuck right to the recipe and it was so fresh & yummy.  Thanks for sharing it with us. I hate it when people add a dash of this or that and a can of this or that, etc. Then they tell you what they think of the recipe. You can't rate a recipe if you turn it into your own recipe and then give it the stars. Its not the same. If you have a good recipe - then submit it.  Not one that you have made over to suit you.

Awesome just as is.  I don't deviate from recipes when people take the time to post them.  I might as well just post my own if I change it.  The family loved it!

All I did was add a tomato (it was about to go bad and I needed to use it) and lime juice instead of lemon.  One word - YUM.  Delicious and simple are always nice words to associate with a recipe and this one is a keeper!

I was looking for a quick guacamole recipe that didn't have too many ingredients. This worked great. I only had 2 avocados and the rest of the ingredients on hand. I was shock how good it tasted. I played with the lemon juice and salt and pepper. I added a bit of garlic salt because I normally add garlic to guacamole. Play with the ingredients and have fun. this was very good.

It looks super and I am sure to try it soon but I knocked off one star for the incomplete listing of green onion.  I believe you meant 3/4 cup.  Please correct to clear any future confusion.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times and everyone gobbles it up. The only thing I do differently is I use limes instead of lemons. This is my go to guacamole recipe. Love it!

It's exactly as the title says, simple!  It's a nice quick version of my usual version, which requires more chopping, but for something fast, this works!

I only had 1 ripe avocado so I scaled this down.  Made as directed but added some hot sauce.  Next time I'm going to add diced tomatoes.  Almost too easy to make this great recipe.

This is an amazing recipe.  Don't be afraid to add salt if you're not a salt person.  I don't normally add salt, but it adds a lot to this recipe.  Don't be afraid to tweak it to your likings.  I cut back on the cilantro.

Quick and easy, quite tasty recipe that has become the "go to" for my huge homegrown Florida green skin avocados.  It does not have to be hass to be good!  Fresh cilantro and green onions from my patio garden and fresh squeezed lemon along with a touch of sea salt and pepper, and this dip is ready to rock the house. Very nice recipe, thanks for sharing!

Thanks for a wonderfully simple and tasty dip recipe! I used lime juice and didn't use any cilantro at all. I also added a clove of garlic and some paprika. We didn't have any leftovers!

Super Good and super simple to make. I found this to be great with chips, but got the super good thumbs up from the kids when I added to their ham and cheese sandwiches one day while making them and there friends a fast lunch. I also like to fold it into my omelets with a little spicy Monterrey Jack cheese

I used juice from a fresh lime instead of lemon and only 1/4 cup of minced onion. This was a dish for our homeschool co-op family event. Yes! It was gone quick and I was asked many times "what's the secret?" Thanks, I like my guacamole without tomato so this was perfect!

This was a great recipe. So simple. I added a couple of dashes of hot sauce and some lime salt from my Mexican grocery store and it was delightful.

Fast, easy and so good!  Keep to the recipe and you'll enjoy.****Made again.  I did do something a little different this time though.  Out of fresh lemons so I used a lime and again it was a success and so so easy! .

I use lime juice instead of lemon. I dislike cilantro so I leave it out. I add jalapeños instead, as I like a little kick.

Easy, fast, simple and good.  I added a bit of minced garlic from the jar.  This recipe has all my favorites in it, so I like it best.  Can use lemon or lime, whatever you have.

This Guacamole was GREAT!  I Do not like Guacamole but my husband love it so, I made this for him!  He was so happy with it I just had to give it a try, and I was in awwwww!   I cut the recipe down to 8 servings and the two of us ate it all so next time I will make more.  I love to try new recipes and I will say this one is a keeper!

This recipe is perfectly simple and I love it! No need for tomatoes or garlic, just the utter pleasure of tasting ripe creamy avocado, lime over lemon, green onion and delicious refreshing cilantro. It's my new favourite and a crowd pleaser for sure! Sometimes it really is best to pare down and enjoy the basic flavours the way they were meant to taste. Must use quality avocados for sure!

this is just the way i like mine too...forget the garlic..ruins it to me..and i love garlic in almost everything so i was surprised. sometimes i do like topping of with a lil hot chilli sauce and on occasion have added some salsa..but for me simple is the best like u have it and for some zing just a lil hot sauce on top.

Loved the simplicity of this recipe and the all fresh ingredients. Ripe avocado needs little more than salt to be good. Often people put too much "stuff" in guacamole and they mask the subtle flavor of the fruit. If you don't like avocado, don't make guacamole.

This is a very good recipe with lime instead of lemon plus I add a mince jalapeño pepper and some seeded and diced tomato to give some kick.
