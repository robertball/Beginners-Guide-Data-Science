Mrs Field's, Neiman Marcus', Urban Legend .. these cookies taste very good for a hoax recipe. First got it but unnamed, from a local aussie paper more than 10 years ago, then discovered it's got a name (1st or 2nd name above) last 4 years or so via the Net. Recently here (malaysia), it's making its rounds again but under yet another name - Famous Amos, lol. No matter what name it goes around with, this chocolate oatmeal chip cookie deserves a try; so go on, you might just come to love it, especially if you love oats, with nuts and chocolate. This makes a lot; I make them smaller and halve the recipe sometimes too. Thanks for sharing it here Holly, I now know the calories and fat content of these cookies.

It's okay, but not terrific. It's not buttery enough for me and something isn't quite right, although this is a lot nitpicking on my part. I like my chocolate chip cookies a particular way, I'm afraid. 

Just a note on a couple other reviews. I don't see anywhere in the recipe where the chocolate has to be chopped. 

Also, someone noted this was the Mrs. Field recipe. Mrs. Field's has stated they do not use oats/oat flour in their chocolate chip cookies and I cannot taste oats in those cookies. They have stated that their recipes use more butter and vanilla than the average home recipe, along with more sugar.

LOVED this cookie! Used 1 3/4 c of each of the sugars (that was plenty) and 1 1/2c of choc chips 'cause that was what I had.  Did not bother with the grating of extra choc.  Processed 1/2+ the oats to get fine powder and rest left as oatmeal (we like oatmeal). Next time will add a bit of cinnamon and maybe nutmeg. Took some to work - they disappeared in seconds.

If you make these right, they are outstanding.  Someone gave me this recipe 15 years ago and now I'm known for my chocolate chip cookies.  I know it's terrible, but I use margarine instead of butter which really help the texture.  I don't bother grating the chocolate.  I just throw some extra milk chocolate chips in the blender and mix that in (and I add more chocolate than it calls for).  In the end though, underbaking these cookies is really the key for me.  I bake them for 6 minutes and let them cool as short a time as possible on the cookie sheet.  People continually beg me to make them and I've sold a few batches.  By the way you can make these vegan and they are still fantastic!  The texture is different and you have to form them into a cookie (they don't spread out), but the taste is still incredible.  My vegan friends said they were the best cookie they had ever tasted.

These are good! I prefer to use pecans for the walnuts, and I use my cookie scoop for the dough, then I pat it down slightly.  My baking time is slightly less, though, closer to 7 or 8 minutes or when the edges are golden and the tops just ever so slightly starting to brown, otherwise they seem too dry.

I recommend you use Milk chocolate for both the bar and the chips. You will never go back to traditional cookies.

The key here is definitely BLEND THE OATS!!! It gives it the most amazing texture. And it's a part that most people miss, it really does alter the outcome of the cookies. These are my favorite cookies :)

An alteration I do for my mother is adding a cup or so of cranberries to the half recipe. Gives them a nice tangy kick. Just an idea ;)

Happy Baking!

Flavor was good, but we were expecting chocolate chip cookies, not oatmeal cookies, which is exactly what these are.

These cookies were a hit with my hubby's coworkers. He got several requests for the recipe and thank you e-mails for the delicious treat! I had to bake these for 12 min, don't know if I rolled them too large or what, but they still seemed a little undercooked when I took them out but cooled fine and tasted great!

I made a half recipe to take to a cookie exchange-everyone loved them.  I added these to my permanent cookie recipe collection.  The only suggestion I would make is to split the oatmeal before blending because it choked up my blender.

I really liked this version of oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. The oatmeal being ground to oat flour made the cookie more palatable for me. I did not add walnuts due to personal preference. Also, halved the recipe and made the cookies smaller and netted between three and four dozen cookies. I am sure that I will make these again.

The cookies were very good. Although I like a softer chocolate chip cookie myself. They were a little too much work also. Kind of tricky grating the chocolate, My family did like them though. I'll keep the recipe but am still gona search for that perfect Chocolate Chip cookie. You may want to cut this recipe in half. I did and it still made 50 or so cookies!!!
