I was a little skeptical about what the consistency would be, since there's no egg to hold it together, but these turned out DELICIOUS! I didn't have oats, so I subbed 1/4 cup extra fried onions. I think I would do the same in the future, too. We had a meatball bar at work and these were the first to disappear!

I had not seen a recipe for Buffalo Chicken Meatballs before, so decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly. This was my first time working with ground chicken, was quite sticky. My meatballs were a little flat on the bottom but no big deal. The recipe tells you to line the pan with foil. Do NOT skip this part. I had a good quality non stick pan and there was black goo all over it. I think this is from the French fried onions, caramelizing. Next time, I would be sure to line the pan. Ok, now for the meatballs themselves. They were very moist and did not fall apart. I am not sure about the cilantro. I like it but not sure that it worked well in this recipe. I would either cut the amount in half or leave it out all together. I believe minced celery or celery salt instead of garlic salt would be a nice addition. Also, was not a huge fan of the hot sauce mixed with the ranch dressing. I believe I would try mixing some hot sauce in with the meatballs and then dipping in blue cheese along with celery and carrot sticks. I would try this again with the mentioned changes. I do think this is a good base recipe that you can adjust to your own tastes. Thanks for the idea!

I give 5 stars to recipes that are healthy, tasty, easy and fast to cook! These meatballs are very tasty and moist. They held perfectly. I increased my cilantro to a 1/3 of a cup, and finely chopped the onion instead of grating.  1 tbsp of Worcesterhsire & I opted to add 1 tbsp Tamari. I added a dash of ginger powder since these balls will be in a oriental dish. I plan to use pad thai rice noodles with an asian sauce. They are perfect for it! Mine were cooked within 12 minutes, but I kept them smaller.

I followed this recipe fairly close to as written.  I did add a couple of teaspoons of fresh chives since I had them.  Also, my oven was not working so I cooked these in a slightly oiled cast iron skillet.  The meatballs turned out well!  For the sauce I added some crumbled blue cheese.  I like spicy, but the sauce was too spicy for me!  Even after I added more ranch dressing.  I would recommend tasting a small batch of the sauce before making the entire portion.  I had some celery on the side with a big drink of water to cool my lips.  I attached a picture.

I was skeptical about making these with no egg in the recipe and almost added one but I always try to make a recipe as written the first time as to give the person who posted the benefit of doubt.  Glad I stayed with the original recipe.  Very tasty.  Only different thing I did was cook them in my air fryer.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I've made a couple of different meatball recipes and this came out the best! I used a half pack of Lipton onion mix instead of the fresh veggies bc I'm not the best dicer and I have to say it actually comes out more flavorful and the meatballs more uniform that way in my opinion. I subbed panko bread crumbs for the oats.  I went very heavy on the seasoning bc I've found that otherwise meatballs tend to be bland. old bay was perfect with this recipe. I added only about half the hot sauce since we don't like it too hot and a quarter cup of sweet Chile sauce with the ranch.  I heated the sauce up over the stove quickly  and served it on top of the meatballs. The sauce came out a little thousand islandy but it was good. I left the meatballs in the oven a little longer,  about 20 mins and they were perfect! my boyfriend thought they were store bought!

Awesome recipe! I have made it several times my picky grandson loves them. I do not use the cilantro or green peppers. ..I add hot sauce into the mixture...They are sticky to work with I add approximately a tbls of flour and coat my hands with flour when making the balls...After I bake them 10 minutes I place them in a crock pot and add the dipping sauce into the chicken balls heat them 2-3 hrs...great after school snack for the grandkids..

These didn't really thrill me much.  I made according to recipe although I wasn't sure exactly how to "grate" my onion and bell pepper.
