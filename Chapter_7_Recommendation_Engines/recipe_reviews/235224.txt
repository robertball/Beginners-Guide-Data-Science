I didn't get much rise on this from the self-rising flour (which I rarely use) and if I make this again I'll probably add just a little bit of baking soda. The bread is very moist from the fruits and its texture is a little on the dense side. I had no canned crushed pineapple so I just used some fresh pineapple from the fridge chopped it very finely and I did add some chopped pecans. Made half a recipe and got two small loaves. Although a little sweet for us (personal taste) it is very tasty.

I made some changes. Instead of using self-rising flour I added 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder and 1/2 tsp. of salt per cup of flour. I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. It turned out great and I will make it again.

Mine too turned out dense and did not rise very well. Like Lultzflcat I didn't have the pineapple on hand and had to improvise which might have lead to the heaviness of the bread issue. I also added chopped pecans which I thought rather saved the recipe for me (added flavor). It tasted fine but like my husband said when he ate a piece..."it needs more bread texture". The picture is what motivated me to want to try this recipe. It's one of those recipes where I wasn't too disappointed but wasn't 100% pleased either. Would like to try it again sometime though.

The taste of this bread is very good although a little sweet for our tastes. I may not have drained the pineapple enough because the bread was soggy on the bottom after baking for 1 hour and 15 minutes. We liked the bread well enough that I will try it once more letting the pineapple drain longer and using a new package of self-rising flour in case that was part of the problem.

I like the other reviews didn't get much rise from the recipe. However I thought the taste and texture was excellent. I will make this again maybe add some chopped peacns. Yum!

I made a bunch of changes to the recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I put rice vinegar into 1/2 cup milk I added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds 1/2 cup chopped dried figs about 1 cup chopped almonds and substituted mandarin oranges for the pineapple and put in chopped cranberries. I made my own 'self rising flour' and the bread is DELICIOUS! I will definitely make it again.

Bread turned out perfect with the following adjustments. I omitted the applesauce and buttermilk. Used regular flour and added whole eggs and 1/4 cups of pineapple juice. Bread came out moist and delicious and rose beautifully

I will reduce flour next time if I make and add salt. I can taste the flour and needs salt. Very bland tasting bread and hubby said he doesn t like. And he s a huge fan of cherry bread. I can t taste pineapple at all. Tastes like banana cherry and flour. Followed recipe exactly except for 2 loaves not 1. That was an accident as this is first time using All Recipes and didn t realize you can change number of servings. First time with self rising flour also.
