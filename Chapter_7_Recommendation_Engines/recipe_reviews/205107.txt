This recipe, along with all the other recipes in the Kneadlessly Simple cookbook are winners! The cold rise method gives the bread a wonderful texture and flavor. The longer it rises in the frig, the better it is. Just the most wonderful taste too. Real bread, at last! Not as yeasty as warm rise method. My other favorites from this book are County Fair white bread, Peasant Style Pot bread and the oat bread shown here. Give this method a try, and you'll never go back to warm rise again!

YUMMY!!  As others said, cook time is shorter than stated.  I baked at 375 for 27 minutes, then covered with foil and baked another 10 minutes, then removed foil and baked for another 5 minutes.  Came out PERFECT!!  Probably my new favorite bread.  Plain enough to use for sandwiches, but a hint of sweetness that makes it good by itself too!

This bread was quite tasty and super-easy. I don't bake bread often, so thought this recipe would be a good one to try. I mixed it up before bed time and let it rise overnight- without pre-chilling in the fridge. I followed directions exactly. The only thing I noticed that seemed off was the baking time. I baked at 375 for 45 minutes total, covering with foil after 25 minutes. The crust turned out a little too dark and the edges were a bit overdone and dry all the way around. My oven is usually right on, so I'm not sure if it was baked too hot or I left it in too long?? It was still very good and I will definitely try this recipe again with some adjustments to baking time or temperature.

I loved this bread.  It has a nice flavor that is mellow enough to eat with just about anything, but is interesting enough by itself.  The first time I made it, I baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes and the crust burnt a bit.  It was still tasty, so I tried it again, this time on 325 and for 35 minutes and it was perfect.

This bread was AWESOME!  I was in a rush so I actually changed the rising steps.  I mixed all of the ingredients as directed but instead of putting it in the fridge I put it in the warm oven for a few hours until it had risen.  Then I cut the dough in two, added a little flour and a little kneading and let it rise again in the warm oven for about 45 minutes.  After, I baked it at 325 for 27minutes and it was absolutely perfect.  Wonderful tasting bread and so light.

Adjustments to ingredients:
-maple syrup instead of honey
-2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour

pretty good for a knead-less bread.
