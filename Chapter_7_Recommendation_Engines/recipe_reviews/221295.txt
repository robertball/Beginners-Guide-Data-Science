I'm delighted to be the inaugural reviewer (and, admittedly less than stellar) photo submitter for this recipe!  It is FANTASTIC!  Not only does it taste great, but it's super versatile and easily thrown together for a quick weeknight meal.  I had every intention of following the recipe, but I did have to make a few tweaks out of necessity.  I had some baby bellas that needed used or pitched, so I used them in place of the cremini (and, I imagine any shroom would be great, per your personal preference).  As I was mixing the cream cheese and goat cheese, I noticed mold/fuzz on the remaining cream cheese in tub.  Having just got over a nasty stomach bug, I elected to be safe rather than sorry and pitched it.  I had no cream cheese back up, so I subbed lite sour cream and goat.  At the last minute, I added a little fresh mozz to help add creaminess.  These were delicious.  Both Mr. LTH and I thoroughly enjoyed them (he even ate my second half!).  I paired them w/ "Best Black Beans" for a simply delicious nutrient dense quick meal.  THANK YOU, rudechack!

OMG, these are amazing! I changed a few things based on what I had on hand, I used regular button mushrooms, lite cream cheese and spinach tortillas from Trader Joe's. I also added a splash of red wine with the balsamic. I used both red and green onion, both were great. Thanks Soooooo much for the recipe, I've already made it 3 times in one week:)

Absolutely delicious!  I used a variety of mushrooms.  After cooking the mushrooms and onions I mixed everything but the mozzarella together.  This made for easier storing between mixing and making the hot quesadillas for my guests.

5 stars for being easy AND delicious! This really is a great recipe. my husband asked me to make it more often. I have made this a few times substituting things based on what I had at the time also. For instance, one time I made this w/o cream cheese,...used baby bella mushrooms instead of cremini and plain goat cheese instead of herbed.  I also find that red/purple onions are perfect for this recipe. Even my 2 yr old enjoys it with no complaints. It's simple, you cant go wrong.

I found a Rosemary crusted goat cheese at the market. It is a firm cheese like cheddar. WOW!! I was so blown away by this cheese, that I forgot about the mozzarella and didn't think it needed the cream cheese. I sauteed the shrooms, added some sliced onions, garlic salt, pepper and the Balsamic. Reduced it and assembled this wonderful creation!  Please forgive me, as a side note.  About this cheese, I liked it better cold then warmed but I am still trying to get used to the flavor of goat cheese. This was a delicious and very unusual quesadilla! ! Thank you Rudechack

good but slimy, I think maybe some chicken would give the mushrooms/cheese something to grab on to, will try that addition next time.

They needed a little more oomph, so I added some basil, crushed red pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes & they were quite yummy!

These were decent but I felt like the cheese became a little overpowering, only slightly balanced out by the sweetness of the onions. It felt like something was missing so eventually I added in some sun-dried tomatoes and that worked a treat!

We made the recipe as described. We found it to be  more bland tasting that we anticipated. I  may try it again but  would increase the goat cheese ratio to cream cheese so that it is tangy and would use stronger tasting  mushrooms.

I must confess, I didn't use goat cheese. We had a variety of shredded cheeses in the fridg. and that is what I used. Next time goat cheese. 
Very good, a big hit in our house.

Yummy in my tummy.  Added some mixed greens to the mushrooms mixture.  Used 6" tortillas so just put cream cheese on top tortilla and Goat cheese on bottom then sandwiched together.

Wow were these great!  I used low carb whole wheat tortillas to make them a little more healthy. Thanks for a great recipe! I look forward to making these again.

I was looking for a way to use a large amount of mushrooms I purchased and thought I would give this a try. It was very good. I didn't have goat cheese but I did have some homemade Boursin so I just spread some of this on 1/2 the tortilla in the pan. I put some mushroom\onion mixture on and then a bit of shredded mozza cheese. When it looked like it was getting warm I flipped the other half over and flipped the quesadilla. We like goat cheese so I'm looking forward to trying these with all the right ingredients. I think this is such a good recipe that you could mix it up a bit. Thanks for sharing rudechack.

Pretty good. I added a handful of spinach to make it a little more filling.
