LOVED this sandwich! Great combo of flavors, and the onions were a great addition. I did just eyeball the rosemary b/c I didn't want to use the whole tsp., as I thought it would be too much for me. No Italian bread in the house, so I used a butter bread that I had on hand. Really, really great....a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this tonight and it was a hit with my son! I had to make a slight alteration as I didn't use American cheese. I replaced it with Vermont white cheddar. It came out very creamy and delicious. For the second sandwich I added some sautéed mushrooms. That was a wonderful addition. Grilled cheese fun!!

Great sandwich to make for a quick meal or easy casual appetizer.  Adjust seasonings and cheeses to suit you.  I agree with a previous reviewer about the rosemary -- too much for our liking, so I scaled it down a bit. I also used white cheddar in place of American. Easy recipe to tweak according to your own tastes. Love the onions and the idea to add mushrooms. You could also add bits of chopped pepperoni, crumbles of Italian sausage,  or other "pizza" toppings. Let the sandwiches cool for a couple minutes so the cheese doesn't run out everywhere.  I quartered them. Serve with marinara sauce.  A big hit! Thanks for submitting the recipe. Great idea!

Delicious grilled cheese that's always a hit! I made these classic sandwiches for a group of women at my house yesterday and then another group at a friend's house today because I had leftover ingredients. I prettymuch followed the recipe the first time except used chopped dried onions (some friends will eat these but don't like fresh onion.)
Today, I used my Italian seasoning and sprinkled it on the butter I spread on the bread slices; then sprinkled the onion and garlic on the grilling bread slices before putting together to flip over. And I think I'll look for sliced mozzarella next time AND remember to put out the marinara which I forgot both times!

This was delicious! So much that my youngest came up and hugged and me and thanked me after tasting it! I couldn't find sharp American cheese, so substituted sharp cheddar.

Used what I had on hand, buttered the bread with butter, garlic powder, oregano mix. Use just mozzarella, provolone, and Havarti slices. 6 kids ate 15 sandwiches, hubby ate 3! Definitely will be making again and again! Thanks

Good but really just a 3-cheese grilled cheese sandwich.  Perhaps if it had some pepperoni mixed in?

Really tasty. We were a bit confused about the onions. They aren't ever mentioned again after they are sautéed.  I just put them on the side.

This rating really is with no changes because it was very good. But then I made some changes: used Italian blend shredded cheese so instead of adding the herbs to the bread I added them to the cheese and then just dusted the buttered bread with granulated garlic. Also omitted the onions.

This was the BEST grilled cheese I’ve ever had! The only SMALL changes I made was omitted the onions...and instead added sliced Roma tomatoes, replaced rosemary  seasoning with Italian seasoning,  and replaced American cheese with white cheddar cheese. With a side of tomato soup or marinara....it taste JUST like a cheese pizza!!

I made this delicious sandwich as written.  I served it with a cup of tomato basil soup and everyone agreed it was the best "grilled cheese" they ever had.

The onions gave it a weird texture, I ate it but my husband only ate half. Maybe making it like a patty melt with a hamburger patty or without the onions would have made it better

I thought it would taste like white pizza, but it just tasted like herbed grilled cheese. It was ok, but none of us ate a full sandwich.
