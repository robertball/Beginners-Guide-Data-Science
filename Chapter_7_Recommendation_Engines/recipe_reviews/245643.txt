The water wasn't necessary!  Next time I won't use it.  Also, no stevia, but it came out fine.

This was the consistency of regular chocolate syrup after I added just a tad more water. When I tried it plain, I could taste the agave nectar. However, once it was on the ice cream, I really couldn't tell a difference in taste. I'm not a fan of agave nectar, but I have a bottle that I need to use up, so this was perfect. Thanks!
