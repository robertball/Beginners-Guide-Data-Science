This is my new favorite waffle recipe! I would have taken a photo, but they were gobbled up before I could get out the camera. 

The only things I changed were: 1 Tbl of molasses instead of agave, coconut milk instead of soy, and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also made a couple of them by pouring the batter and setting sliced bananas on top before closing the waffle iron. Oh so good.

I have a go-to vegan waffle recipe and this one just blew it out of the park.  Our other one is pale, not terribly nutritious, and dense (though very yummy).  These were lighter, crisped up well, and were so wholesome.  I thought I had dome half whole wheat, half unbleached white flour but I didn't. Did all white accidentally.  Would prefer the whole wheat.  We use oat flour regularly so I knew that would be great. I did add cinnamon.  I also doubled it thinking, if this only made 6 waffles, I'd for sure need more for my family of 5 (well, 4 and a 1 year old who only ate 1.5 waffles).  I use a square waffle mater - two waffles side-by-side.  Doubled, this made about 24 waffles.  Wowee!  I'm sure they freeze well, as waffles do.  So, beware, for that size of waffles, it's making more than 6.

Fabulous flavor and fluffy crunchy texture without the use of so much oil, butter, or sugar. Yum!

I have never felt the need to write a review until I tried this recipe... Twice.  Both times were big time fails and I followed the directions to a T.  The waffles were crispy for sure since I had to add extra oil since it stuck.  But the insides were gummy and wet.  I couldn't even get it out of the waffle pan because it fell apart.  This happened both times.  The pieces I tasted were bland and tasteless.  This recipe didn't work for me.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It has a light texture with a crunchy outside.  I used soy milk instead of water, 1 part whole wheat to 3 parts white flour, sugar instead of agave and added cinnamon and nutmeg and added a tsp extra oil.   I served it with fresh blueberries and strawberries. I especially liked the toasty light brown color these waffles had compared to other vegan waffle recipes I've made that were always a light pale color.   This will be my go to vegan recipe  for waffles.

These were great - definitely enough for 6 persons.  I used 1 cup of white whole wheat flour instead of the combo, only 5 Tbs. of water (note to those who have not used the water/flax seed egg substitute before - use hot water and stir together - let sit about 10 minutes before adding to other ingredients).  Subbed maple syrup for the agave.

My wife and I LOVE this recipe! I grew eating my Mom's waffles every Saturday, and have been missing them since we became vegan. This more than makes up for it!
We haven't needed to change anything with the recipe. At first I thought that 4 tsp. Baking Powder was too much, but it's just perfect. I do throw in a few dashes of Cinnamon to enhance the flavor, but this recipe works just fine the way it is!

These were the bomb! I actually like these better than traditional waffles. They come out crisp and full of flavor! Plus they are so easy to make, just throwing it all in the blender. We don't use syrup, but sliced bananas on top was heavenly. My teens agree, this is our new go-to waffle recipe.

This makes excellent waffles. Other than the sweetener - which I don't use so I used maple syrup instead - there is no reason to change anything here. I will use this recipe from now on.

These were so awesome. My daughter is vegan and I wanted something special to make for her 18th birthday. They were perfect.  So much flavor and crunch, yummy! I will never make a normal waffle again.

My son and I absolutely LOVED these waffles!!  I didn't have agave nectar on hand, so I substituted pure, organic maple syrup (1Tbsp).  They turned out great, and we'll definitely be making them again!  Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe :)

Perfect, yummy and easy to make. They came out quite amazing looking with our MM shaped waffle griddle (my 3 yr old is obsessed with Mickey M). I'm new to waffle-making, so it was a joy to have these come out so beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm pretty impressed with this recipe. One of the things I love about waffles is the moist, almost-eggy interior, and I'd written that off here due to the lack of eggs, but I ended up quite surprised at how much the texture mimics a non-vegan waffle. They are heartier than other waffles I've made, but not too much heavier. I did have major problems with the waffles sticking to the iron, no matter how heavily I sprayed or brushed the iron with oil. I found that cooking these on a higher heat level than I use for non-vegan waffles helped them to pop out of the iron a little more easily, but they're still somewhat challenging to dislodge. I find that they freeze and reheat wonderfully, so devoting a little time to a big batch for the freezer isn't too much of a hassle. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious. I used oat flour rather than rolled oats. Otherwise I followed the recipe and they turned out perfect.

My waffle iron cooks this perfectly, just make sure to use canola-oil cooking spray on the iron so it doesn't stick to the grid! I added peanut butter on top to make this even more delicious.

These were very good. I did sub almond milk for the soy, also I used brown sugar instead of agave. I've made these twice-the first time I didn't follow directions, but the second time they were very good. Will be my go to recipe.

Love these waffles. 
I did make a couple changes though. 
I omitted the Canola Oil.
I used Coconut Almond milk in place of the soy.
I added Apple pie spice, to taste.
Came out Awesome

Fluffy with a good crunch. The oats add texture and depth. We will definitely be making again. I used regular milk in some, and they turned out well.

Great recipe. My hubby and I are following a whole foods, plant based diet that does not include oils, so I made a few changes.

I swapped the oil for a mashed banana. I doubled the vanilla, and swapped the agave for maple syrup.

The batter was not the right consistency with my substitutions, so I added about a 1/2 cup or more of water.

I started the recipe with hot water and allowed the water and flax meal to rest for about ten minutes before combining the mixture with the rest of the wet ingredients.

Let me say first I had to change this recipe a bit due to needing it gluten free. I really cannot say how I liked it as stated.  I gave it three stars because it gave me the basic recipe and I wanted to tell others that you can use a Gluten Free flour blend in place of both the wheat flour and the regular flour and have them come out great. Also used 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in place of the Agave. Made them for my grandson who must be egg free and gluten free and my grand daughter who must be dairy free!

Not bad!  My son is allergic to egg whites so we've been trying to find egg-free versions of our favorite breakfast foods.  This much lighter and fluffier than I anticipated.  These seem to brown faster on the outside than the cook on the inside, so I had to experiment with which heat level to cook these on.  Will definitely be making these agin

This recipe is close to perfect as is - we make these every Sunday! You can taste the whole grains, and the flax adds nice texture, too. Make sure to spray the waffle iron with Pam in between each waffle, or they'll stick. I usually use vanilla soy milk, but I've used regular in the past and that comes out great, too. There's no need to blend the mix at the last step, either - stirring with a rubber spatula or fork is just fine.

Loved these! I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so I subbed spelt flour. Also, I used almond milk instead of soy. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. My family gobbled these up so fast. To help keep the waffles from sticking, it seems best to brush canola or vegetable oil on the waffle iron instead of using a spray.
