My mom has been making this for years, so I took pieces of her version and added it to this one. I skipped the Thousand Island dressing and used 2 cups of mayo with 1 can of drained and rinsed sauerkraut, a pound of shredded corned beef, one pound of shredded Swiss, 8 oz. shredded cheddar and 8 oz. of mozzarella. I mixed it altogether and baked it in a greased 9x13 for 1/2 hour and it was out of this world. I served it with Triscuits and cocktail rye, which my guests really enjoyed.

A great appetizer, always a hit with everyone.  When I'm in a hurry I just put a dollup of dressing on party rye squares on a cookie sheet, top with meat, cheese, and kraut, and bake until hot an bubbly.  Also good with turkey and Swiss cheese.  YUMMAY!

Gets high marks for being easy, tasty and transportable.  I bring this to work and parties every chance I'm given and people are always screaming for the recipe.  They're always bowled over to learn its only 4 of them and you just chop, mush and bake!  Excellent!

I made this recipe in a very small amount, just in case.  I served it with German rye toast points, but wish I had used Dark Beefsteak Rye instead. Also, I think the recipe could benefit by a sprinkle of caraway seeds.
Overall, a very satisfying hot cheese dip with healthy ingredients. By the way, I ate it all, and plan to serve it at my next gathering.  If you don't like sauerkraut, don't bother!

Very good recipe!  I used a bottle of fat free dressing and it was great!  My husband loved it on top of warm sourdough bread.  We had it for dinner for two nights.  Might sautee some onions to add next time, but excellent recipe!

{GREAT RECIPE} I've made a few changes, but nothing off the mark. My proportions were different only because of the devise I used to bake it in. I did use deli sliced corn beef. I also cut sliced pumpernickel bread into square  pieces and with a light brushing of olive oil on both sides and baked them for 10 minutes on a cookie sheet. These were nice added touches. Thanks for a keeper!!!
