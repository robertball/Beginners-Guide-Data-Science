Believe it or not it wasn't as tangy as you'd think it would be.  Nice for a change but doesn't beat Mom's. 
I'd would try this one if you are on the fence.  The only change I made was subbing turkey bacon- it did crisp up real nice.

This was very soggy and fell apart and was just too sweet.  Will need to spice up the leftovers and turn them into sloppy joes or taco meat.
