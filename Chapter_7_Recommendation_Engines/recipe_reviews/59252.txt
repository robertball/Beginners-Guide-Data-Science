MMMMMMMM...YUM!  I have recently started to incorperate more zuccini into my diet(as it is not something that I really like).  My husband and my best friend are not zuccini fans either and they LOVED it.  This is definately a winner especially paired with two other recipes from this site, Korean BBQ Beef and Korean Cucumber Salad as well and some jasmine rice.  WOW, WHAT A MEAL!...Rachel

My mother and I were very disappointed in this dish.  She didn't like the vinegar taste and I thought the soy sauce was overpowering (I used a reduced sodium sauce sauce).  I think this would have been better if the onions and zucchini were stir fried and had a little bit of the liquid mixture added in for flavor.  I did not care for how the squash boiled in the liquid for 20 minutes.  I will not be making this again.

yummy!  I love Korean food, and this turned out very similar to things I've shared with Korean friends.  Yes, it's salty...I might use less soy sauce next time, but I'm pretty sure Koreans usually use this as a side to eat with the main course--and their sides are usually pretty salty.

It was different! 
Basically the vinegar "pickles" the squash, and the soy sauce and sesame and green onions give it a "Korean" flavor.
My Korean roommates made a similar recipe (without the vinegar) using fermented shrimp (not always available at the local Piggly Wiggly)

This looked a little scary when done, as the sauce got very dark (I'll admit I eyeballed the quantities, and I used tamarind instead of vinegar). I was afraid that the flavors were going to be too strong and salty. It was really nice though, and had a kind of "meaty" quality to it. The squash was not mushy and falling apart, and the sauce was almost steak sauce-y. Again, that may have been due to the tamarind.

This is absolutely delicious!  It had a sweeter flavor than I expected.  Word of warning that it does look rather ugly, but it does taste really good!

This was a very good way to make squash.  I would cut back on the soy sauce a litte next time.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a reduced sodium soy sauce. It would have been too salty if I used regular soy sauce.  Goes very well with the Korean beef recipe from this site.

OMG this was fabulous. Delicious, and very useful for dieters (the only fat or significant calories are in the sesame oil).  I used Mirin instead of sugar, and I suspect that is more authentic. Find it in your Asian grocer's.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I was hoping it would be the one the kids would like too, but they didn't.

I've made this a couple of times now and made one change the second time by adding xanthan gum to thicken the sauce and it was awesome! Definitely a keeper!

Yes, I actually followed this recipe,  and was very pleased with the results. The simple ingredients; made it easy to put together as most households have them readily available. It is a tangy sweet combination of flavor. I am typically not a fan of sweet however, this dish  is one I will be using to add variety to the home menu.

I can see why no one has added a picture yet as this may not look the most appealing. The only thing I changed was using a small amount of white onion instead of the green onions as I didn’t have any.  Taste wise, this was very good.  I will make it again but reduce the soy sauce by half as I don’t think that much is needed.

I did try it this way first. I was disappointed because I wanted a recipe for Korean pumpkin squash. I don't care for zucchini.

I am a Korean. We use green zucchini instead.
