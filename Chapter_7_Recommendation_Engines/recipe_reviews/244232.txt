These were a hit with the kids!  They loved decorating them and tasting them.  Perfect when you are craving a S'more but no campfire to be found.  The kids want to add a layer of peanut butter under the marshmallow next time.

These would be fun to decorate with kids.  They taste like s'mores, but I like more marshmallow and chocolate with mine.  Smush together two of them for a neater s'more sandwich and you get the marshmallow and chocolate you want. They're a super cute Halloween treat!
