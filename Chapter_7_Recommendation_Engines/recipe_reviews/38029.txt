I was a little nervous about the caraway seeds, but it turned out great!!  For a new twist try adding some goat cheese into the mix, it really compliments the caraway.  Good and very simple recipe, just what we come on here for.

very good...it had a sort of creamy texture and the flavour wasn't too overpowering as I thought it could be. I like the goat cheese suggestion, I'll try that next time.

This was very easy.  I wish I would have had some bacon to add though.

This was ok but nothing spectacular. I didn't bother steaming the cabbage - just shredded it ultra thin, and simmered it in the sour cream.

I don't like cooked cabbage, but you can't even taste the "cabbage" in this dish.  It was yummy!

Looked and smelled great.  But ended up a little bland.

It was okay, I used Greek yogurt.  Not a lot of flavor.

I loved this recipe because it was so easy to make. Also, the creaminess and taste of caraway seeds are great together. (The only thing I added was a quarter teaspoon of black pepper.)
