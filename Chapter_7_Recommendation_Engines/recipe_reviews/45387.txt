It was an ok recipe, but dont spend a lot on a good steak cause it ruins the true taste of the meat. Too sweet.

pretty good...maybe a bit sweet.  I didn't cook it quite to 145; i prefer my (good) beef mid rare (130-139)  Just for general info, rare is 120-129, med. rare 130-139, med. 140-149, med. well 150-159, and well 160-169.  These are industry standards, and used by most restaurants:)

This is a really good marinade.  I used New York strip steaks instead of Rib-eyes and they were really tender and juicy.  The vinegar based hot sauce leaves you a lot of room for personal preference as I found many sauces at the store with varying degrees of hotness.  I used a State Fair Salamida Spiedie Sauce.  I also had to use 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce because I only had 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce.  This one is definitely worth repeating!!!!!!

I tried this with a T-bone steak and was not as good as I thought it would be.  There are way better marinades on this site than this weak recipe.

a great way to marinade steaks. when you tell people what you did to the steaks before you cook them they roll their eyes but the proof is in a great taste.

Though the steak turned out nice and juicy I could've got the same taste from a bottled marinade. I prefer the marinade on this site for BBQ New York Strip (less time to marinate).

My boyfriend is eating this steak right now and he told me to get on the computer and give this 5-star rating right away!  He also mentioned that he wanted me to download the recipe in case the website ever went away!!  LOL.  I don't have any fears of that happening, but just in case....

This was really good.  The marinade made the steaks very tender and juicy. I had to modify it a bit (didn't use fresh garlic) but it was still good.  I think next time I might use a little less orange juice and a little more hotsauce (probably just a personal prefrence) to make the steak a little less sweet.  All in all my husband really enjoyed it and asked me to make it again sometime.  Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe was very successful and made a VERY juicy steak.  Next time I will make it with less Worchestire sauce, because it was a little too dominant.  Everyone loved it!

I was pleasently surprised by this one!  I was in a hurry and picked this marinade cause I had the ingredients on hand.  Our steaks turned out great.  This is a good alternative to the usual teriyaki type marinades.  Will definitely be using this many times again.  Thanks Willy!

I was a bit scared to try this one because of the unusual ingredients..i started reading the incredients to the family and they screamed...so one night i used it and didn't tell them till after we ate the steaks.  They loved them..i too used a smaller steak but very juicy it was... ::hats off to willy::

First class meal, the first time I made this it was a little spicy for my tast, so I cut back on the Worcestershire sauce and the vinegar-based hot pepper sauce, now delicious.

My husband and I really liked this marinade, used with a chuck eye steak and was fabulous. Next time will try more hot sauce for more of a kick, but was divine as is. Thanks, will definitely use again and already gave a copy to my supervisor at work.

Made this recipe last night for "Steak Night" at my brothers.  1/2'd it and used on skirt steak (husband hates ribeye).  Great tast, very juicy, super tender!  Will add to the rotation :)  Thanks Willy.  Also made a copy cat version of Outback's Sautedd Mushrooms.  Went great together.

I was really surprised at how much we enjoy this recipe. I only used 1 TBS of pepper sauce, however, my husband said he wouldn't have minded more. (I'm the wimp!)I wouldn't waste a good ribeye on this recipe, though. I use London broil and just cut it thinner. The sauce is so good so can be used with a less expensive piece of meat.

Simple and not overpowering.  I mixed it up at work and then took it home with me for a wonderful dinner.  Kept the meat very moist and flavorful!  I could only locate 1 inch steaks but they worked just fine.

This was great, and I was surprised.  I don't usually like a sweetness with my meats, but this was way good.

This marinade is delicious! I used it on the strip steaks that I BBQ'd and it was great!!

I loved the orange juice/ dressing mixture. But, not the W. sauce. I didn't think it tasted any different than just regular steak. Thank you for the recipe, though.
