This turned out to be a thick & hearty cream soup. Everyone loved it. (I saute`ed onion with the garlic for more flavor) 
I used the leftover soup  to pour over linguini for a quick supper the next night, it was delicious.

Quite easy and pretty quick, too!  Perfect for a wintery day.  I also cut up and used the broccoli stalks.  I would recommend using a low-sodium broth to reduce to salty taste.  A spoon of sour cream would also be nice to add on top when serving.

this was quick to make and turned out pretty yummy.i pretty much followed the recipe exactly except i added about 3 tbsp of parmesan cheese. the soup ended up being a little too thick so i added about a cup of milk while it was still in the food processor. i also set aside about 1/2 a cup of the cooked broccoli to add to stir in before serving.

Yum yum!! I love this recipe!! I added some salt to it and it's fantastic! I didn't blend the broccoli because I like it quite chunky. Also, I had no chicken broth so I replaced it with the same amount of vegetable stock and it's just great! A friend at work loved the smell, tried it and is making it for himself tonight! Thank you!

I liked this. I used leftover cooked rice and a few other random leftover veggies (onions, carrots, cauliflower)since I didn't have enough broccoli. Worked well. I just added the rice towards the end. You definitely need to add more broth and add spices if you don't want it to be too bland. I like that it doesn't call for velveeta or heavy cream. Blending the rice gave it a creamy consistency almost as if I added milk. I thought that was different. I will probably make it with leftover veggies and rice again to help clean out the fridge.

I added an onion and used brown rice. This was delicious. I only pureed half so I would have some texture. As with any recipe I added salt and pepper to taste. Will make again.

I'm always looking for good recipes that don't use milk, since my husband is lactose intolerant, and can't do straight milk in a recipe. This recipe hit the spot. I added a little extra cheese, and a dash of oregano, pepper, and cayenne pepper. I cut the green part off of the green onions and put it on top of the soup and put the white part in with the garlic. A nice thick soup!

Only OK.  Needs more seasoning and a LOT MORE BROTH because of the rice.  I added a total of 4 more cups after I had pureed the broccoli/rice.

Since the last review said that it would be a little bland I added Cayenne Pepper to it this made it great. The only other thing is that I don't think I would blend the broccoli and rice, maybe I was a little impatient but it just made the soup too thick. Other than that this was great!

My husband and I thought this soup was awful.  I even added more cheese to it and still didn't have any flavor.  Would not make this again.

This was delicious! On the recommendation of others I added an extra cup of chicken broth. When the soup was done cooking I took about 1/3 of the it  and blended it in my food processor, then  added it back to the pot. My father thought the texture and flavor was perfect. which is saying something!

Amazing soup and very easy to make! I am preparing this soup for a second time in less than two weeks! Tonight I doubled the recipe, adding only some yellow onion and I will use fresh Parmesan instead of cheddar just for fun. Thank you for this delicious soup!

I used brown rice in this, so I simmered for 30 minutes, which is what my brown rice directions stated.  Pureeing this makes it really thick, so add more broth if you aren't a fan of thick soups.  I like thick soups, though, so it worked pretty well for me.  I jazzed it up a little to make it less bland:  I used more garlic than called for, added some onion powder, seasoned salt, and a dash of hot sauce.  When I topped with the cheese I also topped with snipped chives.  Very good!  I made it just for myself (bf wasn't hungry at the time) but he took a bite and decided he wanted some.  This really doesn't make a huge amount, but that's just fine for me since it's just the two of us.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this meal! I added some onions, like some of the other people. It didn't make very much though, my husband and I ate the whole thing in one sitting. It could be doubled for guests. :) Yum!

I was looking for a simple soup as I wasn't feeling well.  1st time I made it with brown rice & veggie stock. 2nd time w/ jasmine rice & chix stock & 1 medium onion as I was out of garlic.  I make the rice (1/2-1cup uncooked) 1st in a rice cooker & use a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli.    I use about 1 box of stock for the soup as I puree it. Can use more stock if you want for cooking the rice separately.

my family loved this soup and I really wasnt sure if they would like it. I did add a little more salt and I did not puree 1 cup of the broccoli.  I will definitely make this again!

This was really tasty, even without the cheddar cheese (I forgot to put it on, and we all loved it, including my in-laws and my 1-year old).  I only pureed maybe half the soup to keep some chunks in there.  The rice wasn't done in the 20 minutes- it needs more time.
A couple days later, I made it again adding whole milk, chopped mushroom, and more broccoli and some spices (oregano, salt & pepper).  Even better!

It was easy to make, but the flavor was incredibly bland (could be fixed up with some spices)
