As other reviewers have pointed out, these have a really strong, rich flavour, but they're delicious. I don't really like coffee, but I love these... Followed the recipe exactly and they were great. Found the dough a little tough to handle, and if you want to end up with 30+ cookies then you're going to have to roll them thinner than 1/4 inch... At least, that is what I found. Anyway, they're awesome. I had fun putting designs on them with the chocolate. :]

First of all, I want to say that I am not a fan of coffee, but I loved these cookies! They are rich and buttery...the only problem I had with them is that the dough was REALLY sticky...I chilled it for two hours before I was able to roll it out. Even so, my first batch spread a lot and didn't look all that nice. The texture was a bit crisp, but still really delicious! I also had a problem with the white chocolate...it was so thick that it wouldn't pipe smoothly. I added about 2 tsp. of shortening and remelted it; that really helped to smooth the chocolate out! Thanks for sharing this recipe...it is a winner!

I came across this recipe over the summer while looking for a cookie recipe that didn't use eggs. What a nice surprise! They were fantastic! What a great flavor! My family really likes bittersweet chocolate so we dipped our heart shaped cookies in dark chocolate. I brought some to a party and every last one was eaten. I am reviewing the recipe now since I needed to print it out again so I can bring them with me to a fundraiser next weekend. This was really a great cookie and the recipe is going in my personal file. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am adding another comment in response to other reviews. I find the dough much easier to work with when it is at room temperature/warm. The coffee granules melt into the dough and changes the color of the dough to a darker brown. I work the crumbs into a ball and then roll it out. My family still loves the cookies and my friends still ask for them.

This recipe has become one of my signature cookies despite a love-hate realtionship with the recipe.  The flavor of this cookie is very good so I have continued to try different techniques with the dough.  I have found these cookies do-able as cut-outs, but do not like the dough getting darker each time it's rolled due to the coffee granules breaking down.  You end up with different colored cookies and that bugs me.  However, I have done star cut-outs drizzled with chocolate several times at Christmas and people go crazy for them.  Once a whim I allowed the dough to soften and popped it into the cookie press.  I experimented with the discs and found that I could successfullly use several of the discs that had larger openings.  Made teeny hearts for Valentine's Day one year and drizzled them with chocolate.  They were bite-sized, crispy, delicious, and just adorable.  Good tasing recipe worth working on to get the result you want.

I really liked these cookies. They are REALLY rich so instead of just drizzling the cookies a made a chocolat icing to make them a bit  more sweet. But all in all very good and they are great to have with coffee or tea. ( and i love cut out cookies)

I don't like coffee but I'm starting to sort of like coffee-flavored things.  It all started when I accidently bought some coffee flavored ice cream.  While these weren't the greatest for me (all though I did eat a couple) they went over really well at my husband's workplace.  I even got a thank you "note" (email actually), that's a first!

I can't decide on if I like these or not.  They aren't horrible but they aren't super yummy.   I made the recipe as it calls for but added 1 more Tablespoon of coffee just because I love coffee flavored things. I also already had my oven on 350 so I baked them for 12 minutes and I should have baked a minute or 2 less because they came out a little more crispy than I like.  instead of rolling out the dough and using cookie cutters I just rolled into balls then flattened with my fingers.

The cookie itself didn't have enough flavor for my taste so we ended up icing the cookies with melted chocolate and that helped but I don't know if I would try it again.

They taste alright, but they're extremely buttery. I'll keep looking for more worthy recipes for my instant coffee grounds.

I wasn't sure how I'd feel about these cookies since I don't drink coffee, but I'm glad I made these.  The coffee granules hadn't melted in the dough when I put them in the oven, so I was worried that I might end up tasting the individual granules, but I didn't.  The coffee flavor, despite being very strong, somehow blended very well into the rest of the flavor and didn't end up being overwhelming or unpleasant at all.  I like my cookies on the crispier side, so I put them on the top rack and baked for a few extra minutes and they came out just perfect!  I just rolled the dough into little balls and punched them flat, and they turned out fine.  I put chocolate on only half of them, and most everyone preferred the ones without chocolate.  HUGE hit with coffee lovers & non-coffee lovers alike.

5 stars for taste but 1 star for ease of use.  I followed the previous reviewer and made the instant coffee into a paste.  I also added an additional tbsp of butter.  The dough was very crumbly even after refrigeration.  I wound up pressing and shaping the cookies by hand.  But they were delicious! I enjoy black coffee so the strong flavor was perfect for me. My husband uses sugar in his coffee but he liked them as well.

Followed the recipe exactly. Not the prettiest cookies I have ever made. Texture too grainy for my taste (which if I would have thought about it ahead of time, its too be expected) also too crispy for what I like. Also I thought coffee would be a flavor not the ONLY flavor you could taste. Not my favorite, I would not make these again.

I think we can add little bit shortening to make the Coffee Shortbread more crumby
