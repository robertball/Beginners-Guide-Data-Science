I used fresh crab in this recipe. I omitted the olives and radishes, and used celery, whole grape tomatoes and green pepper. I also used green onion in place of the regular sweet or white onion. I made this for guests and it was a HUGE hit! I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty and easy to put together.  MUCH better the next day.  As a matter of fact, I thought it was tasteless the first day and nearly threw it in the garbage!  I was glad I didn't after pulling it out on day two and trying it again after the flavors had had a chance to blend.  I used a larger package of imitation crab meat, green onions instead of white, omitted the tomato, subbed red bell pepper for radishes, and as another reviewer suggested, I used rice vinegar in place of the vinegar/lemon juice combo.  I also added about a half tsp of sugar.  Yummy on day two!  Let it blend!

I took the suggestion of using rice vinegar instead of the lemon juice and white vinegar...red bell pepper instead of radishes and tomatoes...used helmans mayonaise... added some shrimp...used real crabmeat and sprinkled parmesean cheese on top it was a knock out at home and for the office gathering shared the recipe with four other people.....wonderful. I got one reply saying that she thought she was eating at a 5 star restaurant.  excellent recipe..

This crab salad is wonderful! I did leave out the radishes, green pepper and the olives and opted for green onions instead of regular onions and also used shredded carrots. I also used a pinch of sugar instead of the sugar substitute. This was a hit with my family and a definite keeper! Thanks so much!

All I can say is WOW, this is a fantastic recipe!  I did take some liberty; I omitted the radishes (seemed odd for this recipe) and added some chopped red pepper along with the green.  I also threw in some chopped cooked shrimp, and used old bay instead of dill, and sugar instead of artificial.  Don’t expect any leftovers if you take this to a picnic!

I think this is one of the best crab salads I have made, and my family agrees.  I substituted carrots for radishes and used low fat mayo.

I doubled the recipe but maybe shouldn't have doubled the spices. Was way too much dill weed. BF didn't like it at all. I had to try and fix it up the next day because it was too powerful. Next time I will not double to the recipe, and put less dill weed and hope it turns out better.

AMAZING! I didn’t have radish, celery, olives or dill weed and it STILL turned out great, so you can improvise if you don’t have everything at hand! As others said it was a great hit, and I'll definitely be doubling quantity next time! I halved the amount of onions though

This was the first recipe that my fiance and I cooked together and I'm glad I chose this one.  All the different flavors combined are so yummy!  I made a few changes as well.  I used orange peppers instead of radishes, used halved grape tomatoes instead of a chopped up whole one (big difference I think), didn't use the lemon juice, used Campanelle pasta, used dill seed instead of weed, and added a couple extra plops of mayo.  Oh - and used green onions instead of the sweet ones.  I'm sure I'll be using this recipe for years to come.  Happy eating!

How simple, and delicious! I enjoyed making this as much as I enjoyed eating it! -- Seriously though, I was looking for a crab salad recipie and this one turned out great. As with most others, I too made some substitutions, Shredded carrots instead of radishes (adds nice orange color), home grown PEELED cherry tomatmoes, and I also added some green onion for color. GREAT!

I made this about 11:00 p.m.Friday 1/28 in a 10 cup container and it was gone by Monday 1/31 with only three people eating it. Then when the last bite was taken I was asked when was I going to make it again.  I added 2 cans of tiny shrimp and imitation crab and 2 cups of penne pasta . I didn't use olives, tomatoes, radishes or green peppers. I will be making this again this weekend. Thanks Joyce

I changed this recipe just a little. I didn’t add the tomatoes (was out of them) or green bell pepper.  Instead I substituted with green onions. Instead of artifical sweetener, I doubled what it called for for the sweetener & used white sugar. This was absolutely tasty!! Made this for my mom for Thanksgiving, but I got a taste. I'm making it just for me next time. :)

This was very good, and one of those recipes that would benefit from fresh herbs, if you can find them (which of course I could not). I made this with a few subs/additions: I tsp sugar instead of sweetener, garlic salt instead of powder, 3 green onions instead of sweet, cherry tomatoes instead of chopped (so my husband could pick them out easier). I added in 1/8 tsp freshly ground pepper, & 1 carrot very thinly sliced (like I sliced the radishes). Lots of color and flavor. I'd say it made more like 4 or 5 side dish servings though, not eight. But I suppose that just depends on how much you like it. This would be a great take-along dish; a keeper for sure.

I wasn't crazy about this; it was very ok. To be fair, I should say that I omitted olives (we hate them), and I substitued Nasoya for the Miracle Whip. That could have been why this was so horribly bland -- it had no kick. We couldn't figure out what to add to help this poor recipe. If I try it again, I'll halve it, and use Miracle Whip (the good ol' full-fat kind, not Fat Free or Light). I'm glad I made this, though.

I took this salad to a BBQ where it had to compete with several other salads.  It was a hit with everyone!  I can't say it's the prettiest salad but nonetheless it was eaten more than any of the others there.  I substituted shredded carrots for the radishes and it was lovely.

I usually wouldn't take the time out to write this, but this salad was excellent- the best I have ever had.  I will pass it on to my husband so he can make it at the firehouse and share it with others.  Thank you...It was the best....

Five stars since my husband raved about this recipe about five times while eating it! Didn't change a thing (other than using a 12 oz. rather than an 8 oz. package of crab), but based on the reviews, it looks as though it is easy to modify this recipe to personal tastes.

Great recipe!  I omitted the olives and radish (personal preference) and the vinegar (didn't have any in stock); I added added cucumbers and carrots (clearing out my veggie drawer).  Instead of lemon juice I used lime juice and instead of mayonaise I used Light Miracle Whip(just because of what I had in stock).  I never would've thought to add lemon or lime juice or tomato to crab salad - but it's SO YUMMY!  I seasoned with dill, Italian Seasoning,season salt, pepper, & garlic.  I also used 1 lb of seashell macaroni, so I added more of the "dressing", more veggies, and I used (2) 8oz pkgs of chunck-style imitation crab (in the refrigerated section of the grocery store-I found mine by the pickles/lunchmeat/frozen shrimp).  This recipe is definitely a keeper and great to make on a hot summer day - since you don't have to turn on your oven!  Prep time wasn't too bad - while I waited for my water to boil, I started cutting up veggies, put my seashells in to boil, continued chopping and by the time my pasta was done I was done chopping.  While cold water was pooring over the pasta, I mixed up the "dressing".  Can't wait to make it again!

This was excellent.  The flavor overpowered the crab so much that I could barely even tell crab was in the recipe.  Next time I will double the crab.  But still a wonderful salad!

Big hit with family, friends and co-workers! I substituted sugar for sweetener, omitted radishes and tomatoes, used red bell pepper instead.  Next time I might try with shredded carrots and scallions.  I used everything else the recipe called for.  Preparation time consuming if chopping everything by hand, but well worth it so make lots.  Tastes good for days.  Thanks!!

I really like this salad, and I make a lot of pasta salads.  The dressing is really good.  I did not want to buy artifical sweetener just for this recipe, so I used about a tsp of sugar instead.  The vegetables can be changed to suit your taste, I think the radish is great in this recipe, gives it just a tiny bite to counter the sweetness.  Great recipe, Thank you!

Definately a keeper!  Next time I will cut down the amount of dill, though - a little too overpowering for my taste.  Also I think it would be good without the pasta as a sandwich filling.  Thanks!

I just came back to reprint this recipe.  It is fabulous.  Everyone loved it.  Goes great with the grilled chicken with herbs http://chicken.allrecipes.com/AZ/GrilledChickenwithHerbs.asp
Def a keeper in this salad-picky house. The black olives really made it interesting. (I have to leave out the radishes)

This is a great salad!  It is a little different than other crab salads, but in a very good way! (I did leave out the olives and radishes, as I had none-and used one reg onion)  My hubby even said this might be the best noodle salad ever, and he doesn't usually care for them!

Absolutely delivious.  I had bowtie pasta, and used real crab meat.  They now have lump crab meat in those thin silver packets in the canned-fish aisle.  This was perfect.  The combination of the herbs was perfect.

This was very good even leaving out the things that I didn't like (all the veggies except celery).

This crab salad is wonderful!  I used two 8 0z. pkgs. of seafood and added a carton of plain yogurt to make it more creamy.  Loved the dill weed in here - didn't have oregano or basil, so left them out.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really enjoyed this dish.I used green onion, black olives, celery and red pepper for the veggies and added some old bay to the dressing. Has a wonderful flavor and is much lighter than i thought it would be. thanks so much for the great recipe!

Very easy and very good.  Everyone that I have fed this too has asked for the recipe.  Not as good as left overs as the red onion over powers the food by the next day.  But fresh is awesome. A nice light lunch or dinner.

Took others' advice of spring onions instead of onion and red pepper instead of radishes. We omitted celery and used sugar instead of artificial sweetener. Awesome! It has become a regular dish in our house!

Yum! I never even liked any type of pasta salad until now! I found it needed a bit more dressing so I will double it next time.  It may be because I used the big sea shells.  Thanks!  It's easy and will be made often!

This is very good.  I found that substituting 1.5 tbsp of seasoned rice wine vinegar for the white vinegar allowed me to eliminate the lemon juice and sugar.  Also, I substituted a red bell pepper for the radish which adds to the sweetness and color.

Excellent!  Fast, easy & addicting!  Made for a party and EVERYONE loved it...even the ones who don't like imitation crab.  I only omitted the tomato (don't like how it makes salads runny) and the radishes...and used scallions & red pepper instead...will definitely make again!!

Quick and easy to make.  I generally leave out the radishes I don't care for them to much.  The kids like it so it is a keeper.  It will be used many times.

Used this recipe at a pot luck barbeque & it was a big hit! looks wonderful & was told it tasted great too (I don't like seafood, didn't eat it myself). The chopping takes some time - next time I will try chopping in the food processor.

I was searching (again) for a crab salad recipe for sandwiches and came upon this recipe. What I find absolutely fantastic is the dressing!  It is THE ONE for which I've been searching forever. I mixed the dressing ingredients and added it to my crab/celery/chive mixture and WOW!!!  Placed on white bread, this crab salad recipe is PERFECT!!!  Why white bread?  Crab salad DEMANDS it.  Save the whole grain breads for more assertive sandwich fillings. This will be my go-to dressing recipe for all future mayo-dressed salads.

VERY good! Didn't use all the ingredients. Left out the radish, onion, olives, sweetener. But this still came out fantastic. I also left out the pasta b/c I plan on using this in regular salads :) Awesome, I'll be making this all the time.  EDIT: I just made this again for the 2nd time. I omitted same stuff as before, but also the tomato, pepper & the vinegar because I'll be using this new batch in a salad that already has those things. The vinegar coming from the balsamic dressing I use. Next time I'll omit the celery as well just b/c I don't really like the taste of it in a salad. Still awesome. Definitely as others have said. It gains more flavor from the dry herbs the more time it has to sit.

Really good.  I made a few changes to fit my family's tastes, but even without those things it was still really yummy.  I left out: radishes, tomatoes, basil, and oregano. I used 1 Tbs sugar instead of artificial sweetner, and I added a tsp. of celery seeds instead of the sliced celery.  I didn't have any shell pasta so I used 1/2 cup of orzo.  We snafed this up!

I love this recipe, have made it several times according to the recipe.  The imitation crab meat only comes in a 16oz size at my local store so the whole thing gets added, but we like it that way.  Sounds like a lot of prep, but I can usually get all the chopping done while the pasta is cooking/cooling, so for me it's a quick recipe.

I made this a couple of times in the past couple months and shared it with my co-workers They all absolutely loved it and a few of them asked for the recipe! I used real crab meat instead of imitation and ommitted the tomato, I also doubled the dill. It' a great refreshing summer time salad! Thanks for sharing this great recipe Joyce!

Very good as written.  I made no major changes other than using fresh crabmeat and thought this was just a perfect recipe.  I did add a few pinches of kosher salt (I personally thought it needed a little, could have been because I didn't use imitation crab).  Anyhow, it was a hit with the whole family.

This earned me some rave reviews at the office pot luck!  I eliminated the radish for some red and orange bell pepper but otherwise made no major changes.  If you leave it in the refrigerator overnight before serving, the flavor just pops out!  Excellent!

This recipe was absolutely divine.  I also threw in a pack of salad shrimp.  I took the advice of others and used rice wine.  This was my first time using rice wine, and I enjoyed it better than the pungent taste of white vinegar.  I also omitted the celery and used celery seeds and omitted the tomatos, relish etc.  I have a confession, I didn't follow the measurments for the recipe; I just guesstimated and added ingredients to fit my tastebuds.  Thanks for sharing!

This salad was amazing.  My personal taste suggests adding another tomato and much less onion.  I've been testing pasta salads for a week to take to a party and this is the definitive TAKER.

My husband and I didn't really like this dish.  The strong flavors of onion, peppers and celery, and all of the herbs just didn't compliment the sweet taste of the crab.

Mmmmmm!  This salad is so good.  I made it with only the crab, pasta, radishs, olives, and used green onion instead of sweet onion.  The dressing is perfect you can actually eat it with the crab alone or even add whatever you please.  Pasta salads always taste the best after cooling for 8 hours or so. I'm definitely keeping this recipie!!  Thanks Joyce!

Excellent cold crab salad! The only thing I would add is a little salt and pepper.

Very tasty.  I'm not a big fan of olives or radishes so I left them out and just added red and yellow bell pepper for variety.

YUM! I couldn't wait to chill it,so I nibbled before it went into the fridge! I didn't add the radishes,olives,tomato or bell pepper,but I felt like it didn't need it! The taste is definitely in the dressing.I also used green onion as opposed to sweet onion,used garlic salt in place of garlic powder.Way tasty!!

This is a light, tasty salad - a wonderful side-dish for a cook-out.  I try to make it the day before - the flavors really blend well in the refrigerator overnight.

Very good. I also added chopped carrots for more crunch and color. I used big and small pasta shells for variety and 2 cans of real crabmeat.

I put less olives and only 3 radishes in the salad.  Also, I used much more the 1 1/2 cooked pasta.  Turned out well.

Sorry to say I did not care for this recipe and neither did my wife.  We usually love the recipes on this site and with the positive feedback I figured I would give it a shot.  To much onion for my personal liking and for some reason the crab did not go well with all of the other ingredients.

Very low calorie and really good. I didnt have olives or radishes. I used orange and yellow bell peppers instead of green. I also added canned corn to it. My husband liked it and he usually wont eat imitation crab meat. He added Sriachi sauce to it and really enjoyed it. I added extra dried basil to it and Old Bay seasoning.

Yummy I really liked this! I made it the night before for my lunch at work the next day and it was soooo good. I didn't do the celery or black olives but I did add carrots. I really liked the radishes in this. The red wine vinegar was the first in the cupboard so that's what I used. Very good will def. make again. Thank you!

This is going to taste excellent for Valentine`s Day. I used green onions,celery,shredded carrots,sliced grape tomatoes,Old Bay(in place of dill),Rice Wine Vinegar(in place of vinegar & lemon), real sugar.Salt & pepper to taste, and of course the garlic powder,basil,oregano.This recipe needs to be made a day before you serve it. All the flavors need to blend. I will taste test this again in a few hours to see if my taste buds is screaming for that squeeze of lemon. This will be my #1 salad choice to make for gatherings also. THANKS for the GREAT recipe.

This was good. I wanted to use real crabmeat but after seeing the price, I stuck with imitation. I ommited the olives, radishes, & tomato (didn't like/didn't have) & used 1 t sugar instead of artificial sweetener. I made this in the evening & we ate it for lunch the next day. I had to add more mayo because it seemed dry. Some of the changes I am going to make with this the next time I prepare it are: increase pasta to 2 C., lower crab to 8oz, increase mayo to 1 C. Also, some of the porportions seemed off to me- a whole onion would have been excessive, I only added about 1/4 & I didn't use a whole bell pepper, I put in about half. It would be better if there were measurements for the vegetables like there was for the celery. Thanks for the recipe.

By far the best crab salad I've ever tasted. I'm not a big fan of salads with mayo in them, but this was excellent. I followed the exactly except I used bow tie noodles.

I made this recipe and it was a little bland for my taste, so I increased the lemon, vinegar, olives, and seasoning, to my liking and it was a hit at our 4th of July picnic.  I doubled the recipe and both bowls were devoured, before the end of the party, and I gave out the recipe to 4 family members.  Everybody loved it.

I made this awesome salad on the spur of the moment last night, making a few changes, using grape tomatoes, and bowtie macaroni and just fresh lemon juice, no vinegar.  Hubby and I had some right away and then later in the evening, he ate the rest during the night, need I say more?

This is very good and colorful. I originally made this as a main summer lunch dish, but I think it would better as a side dish at a picnic or potluck. I added carrot. I left out the olives b/c I'm not a big fan, but will add them next time if I take this somewhere b/c it will look prettier. I will make this again.

This is the first recipe I tried that i didn't love on allrecipes.com!  I thought this recipe was marginal at best and it caused major tummy aches for my boyfriend and I.  I thought the other ratings were very misleading.  I will not make this recipe again.

I've been making this salad for years now..my family always requests it at all the family get togethers  I've always made the salad as written and find it to be the perfect balance of every ingredient..as a matter of fact my daughter asked me to make it tonight, so figured I should finally rate it...it's the best crab salad out there!!! You will not be disappointed....

This salad is pretty good, but a little bland.  Next time I make it, I will probably double the herbs and add some black pepper and cayenne to give it some kick.

I didn't have radishes and olives ... Tastes great without them. I made extra dressing so it wasn't dry.

It was delicious!!! I omitted some of the ingredients because I didn't have them at the time (and some of them I plain just don't like). I didn't put it over pasta however, and just refrigerated it so I can use it for different things later. In fact, I just made myself a sandwich and packed it for work later. Definitely 5 stars!

WAY TOO MUCH ONION....The first time i made this i followed the recipe to the T. I learned that the onion was too over powering so i cut it way down the second. Left out the lemon juice too. Other than the onion the salad was great.

Used 2 cups of pasta and added broccoli florets and grape tomatoes along with an extra 1/4 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Also added some shredded cheese.  Taste great now but will let it sit in fridge overnight...bet it will be even better once the flavors settle.

EXCELLENT!!! Made for a family bbq and everyone loved it. I tweaked the recipe a bit. Added red pepper instead of green, used an Italian seasoning blend, used IMO instead of sour cream, green onions, and used more crab. Left out the vinegar, tomatoes and lemon juice. Don't be afraid to play with it.

Terrific.  Seashell pasta for a crab salad, how cute!  Why didn't I think of that?  Anyway, I did not have celery but will use it next time.  I'm not sure how much of a diference 1/2 packet of sweetener does, I had some so I used it but I probably won't bother with it next time.  I'm glad to finaly find a pasta salad that isn't dreneched ith mayo.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit!  I used an orange pepper instead of a green one.  I also did not have any black olives so I omitted that. 2 heaping tsp. of fresh dill was substituted for the dried dill.  I looked at the other suggestions and used 1 tsp of sugar instead of the sugar substitute.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

My family and friends loved this recipe! It was well worth the time spent chopping the ingredients. I took it to a BBQ at a friend's house and everyone loved it. I left out the radishes and substituted julienned carrots. I also used sugar instead of the artificial sweetener. I placed a bowl of croutons on the table for an optional topping and they added even more crunch! This will be a regular in my house!

LOVE this recipe, just made it for the third time! I used imitation crab and also added a can of mini shrimp. I omitted the celery, Raddishes and peppers, but added cucumber. I also used Old Bay instead of Dill Weed. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great. Truly delcious.

Excellent recipe!!!  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of omitting the sugar.  Finaly found the perfect macoroni salad.  The sauce is perfect and could be used on other macaroni salads aswell.

Not all that pretty, but I think it's just too much dressing masking the colors. I subbed elbows for seashells, green onions for regular. No radishes, 2 roma tomatoes instead of 1.  Reduced garlic powder to 1/4t & dill to 1/2plus1/8 (whatever that is :D). Added 1/2t sugar instead of substitute. Oh, subbed almost a cup of cooked shrimp for the crab.  I'll give it a few days to improve, but even with the minor change I made, this is pretty boring. 'Glad pasta is cheap.  Day1: I wanted to have it today, but okay, I'll wait.  Day2:  Still waiting  Day3: I picked the shrimp out & threw the rest away.  Maybe it's the crab that makes it so good.  That could very well be it.

I did not have radishes or bell peppers, and I didn't use any substitutions for them. I did, however, add bacon bits and craisins, and I discovered that this salad was pretty darn good. Even so, I can't help but think it would be so much better if it were made with real crab meat rather than artificial...

Very tasty crab salad.  I omitted the olives, radishes and quartered the tomato to place alongside the salad.  I plated it on a bed of butter lettuce with the tomato and a quartered boiled egg.  I sprinkled extra fresh dill on top.  I'm sure I'll make this again.  Thanks Joycie for a great recipe.

Excellent dish. If radishes and celery were left out, it would still be good as the combination of spices blend well to make this dish very tasty. I can imagine it tasting even better the next day, but didn't get a chance to find out because it was all gone.

Perfect!  Also very flexible depending on the veggies you have in your fridge.  I've substituted red peppers instead of radishes, and also added carrots.

This was really yummy! As with anything that has dried herbs in it, the longer you can let it sit, the better. I used orange peppers instead of green (sweeter), and cucumbers instead of radishes. Very good (and filling), will make again!

Good base salad, used penne(I omitted olives & sugar sub.) added capers, cider vinegar & red peppers, it's what I had on hand.  Flavors were better after chilling for several hours.  Thanks!

I didn't care for this that much - it didn't have enough flavor for me, even though I added extra fresh dill.  Guess I'm just not a crab person.  It seemed a bit bland to me.  Will try adding some cayenne powder to see if that helps.

I only used 1/2 cup of mayo, and I still thought the mayo taste was overwhelming.  I added some fat free plain yogurt to thin out the flavor, and that seemed to help.  I didn't use radishes or olives, and I added fresh basil and lots of black pepper.  If I made this again, I wouldn't add the sweetener.  Between the crab and mayo, it was sweet enough.  Definitely make this ahead of time and allow the flavors to develop in the fridge for a few hours.  Makes a world of difference.

Pretty darn good!  I skipped dill and oregano, and toned down garlic, simply because i don't like them with seafood too much.  For added crunch and moisture i increased green pepper to a large.  Overall, a very nice basic crab salad.  Real people pleaser.

I thought this was very good, but rather dry.  I ended up using 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 of sour cream.  I did not use the tomatoes, and used real sugar instead.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. I do think next time I will doctor it up some though. I took the suggestion to use rice wine vinegar instead of lemon juice & vinegar but if I hadn't of been out of lemons, I still would have hit it w/ some lemon juice. I omitted the olives & radishes but added 2 banana peppers, seeded & chopped. I used celery salt for the celery (I was out) & low fat mayo & I used fresh herbs instead of dried. With a glass of white zin & some club crackers this made a very refreshing summer dinner....thanks!

This is a very yummy combo of flavors. I used an avocado, Dijon mustard & olive oil instead of the mayonnaise & it’s BOMB! :) i also used fresh herbs & added tomatoes. But everything else stayed the same and it’s refreshingly delicious!

Only had an 8-oz, package of imitation crab but was eager to make this recipe.  It was enough.   Turned out good; followed recipe with a few exceptions.  Used red bell pepper instead of green; 3 green onions in place of the sweet onion (which sounds like way too much),  1/2 teaspoon of white sugar instead of artificial sweetener, and reduced dried herbs to 1/4 tsp. each and garlic to 1/8 tsp.  Didn't want the seasonings to over-power the delicate taste of the crab.  Added 1/2 tsp. of old bay seasoning and 1 cup of frozen peas.  Sliced the olives, green onions, and sliced the red pepper into small slices because I didn't want to end up with chopped salad.  Good salad, but next time will reduce the mayo to 1/2 cup and add some small chunks of cheddar cheese, and maybe a pinch of some red pepper flakes or a 1/2 of a diced jalapeno pepper .  Makes 6 cups.

I have made this recipe for years and it never disappoints. I finally decided to write a review. This is an excellent recipe.

This recipe stands alone as a pasta salad. I don't like crab, but the rest of the family does. I remove a bowl of the salad before I add the crab and it tastes great.

Definitely cool it for 8-24 hours before serving. It allows the lemon, vinegar and mayo to blend flavors for the perfect mix.

This is a great base recipe if you're picky.  You can tweak it easily to fit your family's needs. Here are the changes I make :  1) I leave some veggies out and add cucumber. 2) I use more pasta. I use a 16 oz. bag. This way, the spice flavors aren't overbearing. As it cools, the mayo absorbs into the pasta and it seems "dried out. I add a bit more mayo before serving to loosen it up. With the whole bag of pasta, it makes 12-13 cups. Perfect for potluck.

Five stars with a few changes.  Use real crab meat, a red bell pepper, omit the olives, use fresh herbs, and real sugar.
