This was Excellent!! Right combination of salty, crunchy, cold, and sweet.  But I don't understand why the recipes suggests to chill overnight, the longer it sits, the soggier it gets.  I make it fresh and serve it right away

Had this at the ladies Bunco party. Everyone loved it, even those who don't like brocolli. Also added dried cranberries.  I'm  going to use the brocolli slaw mix next time.

This salad is wonderful and pretty easy to make. I used broccoli slaw instead of coleslaw, and red onion. The reviews at the church fellowship meal matched what my own tastebuds were telling me:)

I love this recipe!  It is easy to make and gets rave reviews. I have used cashews when I did not have peanuts; added more raisins and used regular coleslaw dressing.  I have also used broccoli slaw mix - pre shredded -- vsl shredded cabbage.  Yummy!

This one was a real hit at our Jenkins Family Weekend. I have made it several times and have passed it along to at least 5 friends.
