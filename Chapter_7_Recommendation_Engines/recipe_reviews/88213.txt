Summer 2007: This was really good and VERY easy! I did find that the stuffing was a bit "runnier" than I expected...next time I will add bread crumbs and more peppers to the mixture before stuffing the tomatoes to make it "stiffer". I probably used too much goat cheese. I added toasted pine nuts because I had some on hand and it was delicious! UPDATE 5/12/08: I made this again this weekend with vine-ripened tomatoes from the farmer's market...this time I did incorporate about 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs in with the goat cheese. We didn't have peppers on hand so I skipped those but again added toasted pine nuts. DELICIOUS!!!! The goat cheese consistency was PERFECT with the added bread crumbs. My boyfriend said it was the best meal he's ever had, we both LOVED these!!!! We used goat cheese that already had garlic and herb flavoring in it but if you have plain goat cheese you could add some yourself.

Good, but needs adjustments. The ratio of stuffing is not enough to fill the tomato (the recipe does not state the size of the tomato). I used a medium to large heirloom tomato. I would suggest after removing the seeds to rinse, sprinkle with salt and turn upside down to drain. I added a few tablespoons of panko bread crumbs in with the cheese. Next time I will add albacore tuna or grilled chopped chicken to up the protein.

This was so easy to make. I had rather large tomatoes so I used about 6 oz of goat cheese and about 3 tbsp of roasted red bell pepper that I roasted in the oven myself (brushed with olive oil and seasoned with just a wee bit of cracked pepper and kosher salt)
Everyone in my house loved them. Next time I might add a little bit of roasted garlic to the goat cheese mixture for extra flavor but this was wonderful as is. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were outstanding. I prepared them ahead of time, and then drizzled the olive oil on them right before putting them in the oven. I also added salt, pepper, garlic, and fresh basil to the goat cheese mixture to give it extra flavor, and it was delicious.

The amount of stuffing seemed quite insufficient--might have worked if I had just removed the seeds and left the membrane--will try that next time (the directions are unclear on this point). I mixed the cheese with some leftover rice to make enough, and baked it a bit instead of just browning the top, and it was delicious that way, too.

This recipe was so easy! I've tried this for a number of potlucks & everyone is always impressed on how 'gourmet' it looks & tastes. I topped it off with a bit of shredded asiago & it was always the first plate at the potluck to be finished. Thanks!
(BTW, the recipe amount was just right with the 'fresh tomatoes', the ones sold w/ the vine.

These were great! I used huge tomatoes and made this as our main course, but neither my husband nor I could finish them. I roasted my own red pepper and added some extra into the goat cheese mixture, as well as some torn basil.

This recipe is an excellent starter recipe.  I stuck to the letter of the recipe and my husband and I both liked it a lot. (my tomatoes were kind of small so the amount of stuffing was perfect)  We both felt that something was missing in the flavor of the stuffing... It was very tasty, but a little bland. I am thinking of chopping up some sundried tomatoes next time and adding it to the mixture along with a little extra salt and pepper.  I will definitely be making this one, again, though!

These are soooo good. They make a great "fancy" fancy party appetizer, but are so simple to make. I did add chopped basil leaves and a touch of garlic salt to the cheese mixture to give a bit of extra flavor. I also used small tomatoes off the vine.

This is my favorite appetizer.  For those who love goat cheese, this is an incredible treat - and easy to make!  I used my toaster oven and they came out beautifully.

This is FANTASIC!!!  One of my favorites.  The tomato itself tastes great in the over, anything tomato with basil is usually yummy.  I use Italian breadcrumbs and throw in some garlic as well.  What an awesome side!  Could drizzle with vinegar as well.

Four stars as written, five (at least) when one incorporates the suggestions posted to (1) add garlic, green onions, pine nuts; (2) mix the basil and some bread crumbs / olive oil in the stuffing; (3) match the amount of stuffing more closely to the volume needed to fill the tomatoes. I made this last night and from the first taste the recipe earned an honored place in my "keeper" recipes. Thanks for the original and all the suggestions, folks. This is definitely an outstanding dish, worthy of very high end restaurant.

I made these as written. However, althought the taste was quite good, the proportions were off as others have suggested. I didn't even have very large tomatoes, but the filling did not come close to filling them up. However, great flavors- would recommend getting more goat chese and making extra filling. Also, as someone else said, they don't reheat well, so only make as many as you need at a time. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Just delicous!! I did make these with roma tomatoes and the next time I will use a larger bread crumb. Maybe croutons a bit smashed. Also will try to serve these over a bed of arugula. The goat cheese is so creamy when they come out of the oven. Great recipe to prepare ahead of time and pop in the oven when needed. A smaller tomato would be a great bit size app too!

Very good! As others mentioned, the goat cheese amount is a little skimpy. I had 3 smallish tomatoes and 4oz filled them perfectly. I added most of the fresh basil to the goat cheese/pepper mixture and just sprinkled a little on top after baking. Thanks for the recipe!

5 star, all the way! I had leftover Goat Cheese from pizza's yesterday and wanted to use it up today. I used more roasted red peppers, and also seasoned the tomatoes with an italian seasoning mix...broiled about 8 minutes...YUM. I usually make tomatoes stuffed with risotto or cous cous, but this is wayyy better. Next time i might try a combo of risotto and goat cheese together. I also used PLUM tomatoes. They were cheapest, and I bought 7 of them...They're all gone now ;)

Good flavor, but I'm so used to stuffed tomato filling having more weight...this was very soft/runny. I think next time I'll do what others have suggested and add rice or couscous. It would also be good in cherry tomatoes, where the filling would be proportioned to the tomato better.

This was exceptionally spicey, even though I cut back on the roasted red pepper.  It seems an awful waste of a perfectly good garden-fresh tomato.  (The innerds are the best part--they aren't incorporated back into the filling??)  My husband couldn't eat more than 3 bites of his.  We seldom are disappointed with recipes from this site.  We will give something else a try.

This was wonderful!  I Served them on a bed of field greens drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Pretty presentation and very very easy and fast.  (Wait until they are done cooking before you add the basil.)

This was great!  I didn't follow exactly, as my tomatoes were small and I had limited ingredients.  I mixed herbed goat cheese with bread crumbs, jarred roasted peppers (diced), olive oil and some dried basil and stuffed the tomatoes.  Topped with some grated asiago, but I think parm would have been better.  Anyway, a delish basic recipe!  You could add protein as others have suggested and have an entire meal.  It is super quick and easy! I think fresh basil would have made it a knockout, I just didn't have any.

Good idea, but way too much cheese vs other filler.

The tomatoes were soggy. I would recommend peppers next time. Otherwise, it was awesome!

This recipe was very easy to make though I made a couple of changes based on what I had readily available. I used 5 medium beefsteak tomatoes, 4 oz. of feta and about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped red pepper. It turned out absolutely delicious! (It does NOT reheat well though for those of you cooking for 1.)

Absolutely fabulous & surprisingly light. I didn't have any red peppeter so used pimientos instead and it still tasted great.  While the instructions didn't say to combine the scooped our inside of the tomatoes with the cheese mixture, I did and added a tblspn of fine breadcrumbs to combine.  Don't leave out the fresh basil - it makes the dish.

Really good! As stated by others, no way it makes 4 large tomatoes - mine made 3 small ones. Served with some Rice A Roni whole grain Spanish rice, and I do think the rice would be good mixed and stuffed with the goat cheese. Also I would add some salt to the goat cheese next time as stated. I thought it would be salty enough by itself, but it needed a bit more.

Simply amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as specified. The end was result was tomatoes that had a soft flesh, a creamy, flavorful center. And the best part is it took MINUTES to assemble. This one will be added to the pages of my personal book of all time bests.

Flavor wise this was fine. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of goat cheese. Using the proportions listed, I had enough filling for 3 medium tomatoes packed full. Also, the bread crumbs started to burn after about 2 minutes under the broiler, so I had to switch the oven to bake for about 5 minutes instead.

Oh myyyyyyyyy...these were amazing! Super easy and fast, and totally delicious. I went to grab my garlic and herb bread crumbs and realized I only had spicy panko. Bring it on! The spicy was a nice addition, but it would be fab no matter the kind of bread crumbs used. The only reason I took it down a star was my topping scorched after about 2 1/2 minutes. And my rack was no where near the broiler. I realized I forgot the olive oil, so I scraped it off and did it with the olive oil, scorch again. Maybe it needs more? Or butter in the bread crumbs? Next time I'll probably bake them rather than broil, but all in all a fabulous find!

Yummy, but then what isn't with goat cheese?

I would echo the comments of others that the quantities as shown don't fill the tomatoes.  Need about 50% more.

I'd like to try stuffing cherry tomatoes with this using a pastry bag.  Seems like it'd be a great appetizer!

This tasted so good! Instead of using the red peppers I mixed the goat cheese with garlic. I also sliced up a quarter of a mushroom for each tomato and sliced it into fine pieces. Instead of basil I used Rosemary and it tasted lovely! I paired it with smoked oysters in olive oil and crackers and I can say this is one of the best lunches I had in a while.

This actually works perfectly as an appetizer/finger food (could even use cherry tomatoes)  I used Romas from the garden as a test and it came out wonderfully!  I can't imagine stuffing a full size tomato with goat cheese.  

I mixed basil paste into the goat cheese and added a small amount of garlic salt.  Rolled the tops in the bread crumbs and broiled for about 5 min.  

I forgot the peppers until after I filled them, but mixed it into the leftover goat cheese mix and decided it was good either way!

Agree that stuffing is insufficient so did not remove membrane only seeds. Also, mixed all ingredients together for stuffing and then sprinkle Panko crumbs on top. Delicious!

i modified this recipe slightly:  i mashed up goat feta cheese with green onion and a bit of olive oil and stuffed the tomatoes with that.  i sprinkled the bread crumbs on top and drizzled the oil and broiled them... they were delicious!!  thanks for this great recipe!

The idea is great but the recipe didn't quite work for me with the meaty summer tomatoes. After 7 min. bread crumbs started to burn but tomatoes weren't even heated through to the bottom. The flavor was great though (I also added basil, salt and pepper to the goat cheese mixture as others suggested) and I'll try these once again, maybe will just add bread crumbs later.
