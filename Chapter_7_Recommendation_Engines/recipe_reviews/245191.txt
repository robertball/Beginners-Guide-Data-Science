Made as written except that Camembert cheese was not available in my area. I did some research and found Brie to be the best substitute and so that is what I used. This was very different from any cheese dip I've had before and very good I might add. This one is a definite keeper!

The only change I made was to omit Caraway seeds........ not my decision I might add with a nudge and a wink to other men who love to cook and create.........;) Thanks for a tasty recipe with the right amount of garlic.
