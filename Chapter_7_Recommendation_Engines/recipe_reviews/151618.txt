This was a lot better tasting than I thought it would be (honestly, it was just as good as other, more time-intensive recipes for alfredo that I've made at home.) I used less chicken and used the breast of a rotisserie chicken just because that's what I had left over. This was pretty convenient, since using the already-cooked chicken cut the preparation time in half. I liked this dish with less chicken, and when I make it next time, I will add more broccoli, as I didn't think it had enough. The cook time for the broccoli was perfect - it was still nice and bright green with just a slight crunch to it. I personally thought this was fine with the cream of mushroom (I hate mushrooms, but I hardly noticed the tiny little pieces in there), but I think this dish could be done with just about any type of cream soup.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I made one small alteration by adding about 2 oz of cream cheese to the soup mixture.  Maybe not for the low-fat conscious, but the addition makes it ten times better!

I was really impressed with this dish! It had such a true alfredo flavor for something that was not a true high fat alfredo sauce.  It was quite simple and quick to make with very little mess.  I used frozen broccoli spears and to saute the chicken I used half butter half olive oil for a great burst of flavor! I increased the parmesan to 3/4 cup also. I will definately make this dish again.

What is up with people adding mushrooms to everything!  Mushrooms don't belong in alfredo.  Alfredo should be creamy and cheesy.

I'm a college student on a fixed food budget who is still getting the hang of cooking. This recipe was a good, quick meal that I had time to make while studying.

While I am not a fan of mushrooms, the Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom soup (I used the healthy request variety) proved to be a very handy ingredient. 

Overall the recipe made a delicious meal, but personally I would add 1/4 tbsp of garlic powder to the recipe to give it more of an Alfredo taste.

I made this tonight for dinner and made it with shrimp and scallops instead of the chicken.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with chilis and it was wonderful.  I think the chicken would be just as good.

Very good and very easy to make. I think next time I would use less cheese and a little more broccoli to make it lighter. We added french bread and white wine to make it an easy meal!

Excellent! I saw this recipe advertised in Martha Stewart magazine and it looked very easy and good. I offered to make dinner for my boyfriend and told him I wanted to try this. I used penne instead of the linguine at his request. The dish was great. I added extra parmesan, black pepper and red pepper flakes on top for the perfect spice. I also made the broccoli on the side. I definately will be making this again. It was easy and most of the ingredients are staples in your pantry.

Fantastic, fast supper!  We all loved it - even my daughter who is a very picky eater!  I substituted rotinit pasta for the linguine and it worked well too.

This is SO easy and quick! I agree with adding sour cream to kick it up a notch, while decreasing chicken and increasing the broccoli. Easy and versatile. UPDATE: Okay, I made it restaurant style with 1/2 bar of cream cheese, replaced the milk with half n' half, and folded in 1 cup of fresh grated mozzarella and parmesan right before serving. Wow. Got rave reviews. Tastes just as good as a restaurant, but at 1/5 the price! Don't forget garlic bread to finish it off. =)

Only thing that seemed to be missing was Garlic. That is what I will be adding while cooking next time around. Otherwise it was GREAT tasting and EZ to prepare.

I saw this on Campbell's website yesterday and decided to make a variation of it.  My husband and I don't like mushrooms and he also hates broccoli but I needed a quick, easy dinner.  I used Cream of Chicken Soup and peas instead.  I added a clove of garlic, red pepper flakes, and more salt, pepper, and parm cheese to give it more flavor.  Also, I used leftover chicken that I had from a Rotiserrie Chicken bought at the supermarket.  Dinner was very tasty....I will make this one again.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe at first because I didn't think Cream Of Mushroom soup sounded like something that would go in Alfredo but because of the great reviews I decided to give it a try. It is delicious! You really can't even tell that there is cream of mushroom soup in it. It truely tastes like Alfredo, very creamy and so quick and easy. I just added a little garlic powder and garlic salt because I like a little garlic flavor. This is a keeper!

Great and easy recipe, what makes it even easier is to use leftover chicken.  When I don't have leftover chicken I lightly bread the chicken with flour, once the chicken is cooked I remove it from the pan and throw a cut up tomato into the pan to cook while I chop the chicken into cubes.  Adding the tomatoes to the dish adds some nice color and taste.  I also use a bit less parmesan.

I made this with the ingredients available to me here in Bolivia, South America and made the necessary modifications for the lack of condensed soup. It turned out great! The kids gobbled it down and the wife said that this needs to be a repeat dish!

This was fantastic for being so quick. I altered all sorts of stuff (whole bag of frozen broccoli, whole 12oz box rotini noodles, the mushroom soup can-full of cheese and half and half, precooked chicken I had on hand). I made these changes to have dinner on the table without shopping and dirtying as few dishes as possible in under 20 minutes and it STILL tasted good. If you were to use the amounts and ingredients called for I wouldn't even blink to serve this to unexpected company. Thanks Campbells for submitting!

My family loved this cuz I added some love!! Try this: First cook and crumble 6 strips of bacon, then drain all but a tiny bit of fat in the pan. Add the 2 T butter and saute one shallot over medium-low heat. Add 2 cups cooked dark meat chicken and warm through. Add 1/2 teaspoon dried Thyme, 1/2 teaspoon Mrs. Dash, a pinch of red pepper flakes. Do NOT salt to taste now, because you will add in Bacon, Cambell's "Cream of Chicken with Mushroom," and Parmesan, which are all salty. Use a whole cup of whole milk, or the sauce will be thick and sticky. Low fat and non fat milk make very thick alfredo sauce. If you need to use non fat milk, add in some hot water from the pasta pot at the end to thin your sauce. This sauce can be made ahead of time, and then rewarmed for a very quick dinner prep. Next time I'll try artichoke hearts instead of broccoli!

Not a bad recipe. We had this for dinner tonight, and I just doctored it a little bit (added some garlic to the sauce, cooked the chicken with italian seasoning, added a touch more milk). There's another alfredo recipe on this site that we prefer, but for a night where I don't want to be stuck cooking a home made sauce this is perfect.

Pretty darn good. I used to work in an Italian restaurant and was basing my expectations on authentic Italian Alfredo sauce. This came very close. I took advice from others and sauted chicken in butter and olive oil. I also used cream of mushroom with garlic. I doubled the recipe so there were leftovers. This was so easy to make that I will definitely be making it again.

I made this dish last night for hubby and me. I followed the recipe. It was so delicious. Even though we used 1/2lb pasta, we had leftovers. Very creamy, and with black pepper and parmesan cheese, this was a very nice dinner. We will make this again. Would be great on a cold snowy night. Mmmm GOOD!

Not the best, not the worst. It came out tasting good for using a canned soup recipe however, it didn't really have that rich Alfredo taste.

It taste great and very simple to make. I made a few changes, I cooked the chicken with fresh garlic and used chicken and mushroom soup instead of just mushroom. I also used almond milk instead of cows. Its a good recipe and easy to personalize to your familys likings.

Great recipe! I made it tonight and it will definitely be back again.  I used the Heart Healthy Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup and it tasted wonderful.  Quick and easy!

I didn't have any broccoli so I substituted with green beans, which were great. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce though. I thought the parmesan cheese flavor was too much, even after using only about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2. But I'm not a fan of parmesan to begin with. The meal itself was very easy and quick to prepare but I will definitely tweak the sauce next time.

A poor man's alfredo, this recipe is so simple to make and it's really good!  My husband is picky and doesn't like pieces of mushroom in his food so I blend the mushroom soup before adding it.

I am a beginner when it comes to cooking.  I made this last night for dinner and it was excellent! The only thing i did different was add roasted garlic and lightly seasoned the chicken while it was cooking.  This was GREAT!

I was very nervous about feeding this to my husband he is a "true Alfredo" lover. And is very picky. I did alter it. I marrinated the chicken in italian dressing and added a bit of cream cheese and some italian season mix. plus loads of parm. cheese.Honestly just kept tasting till i felt it was right Next time Ill add more chicken (hubby likes lots) and I loved the broccoli. I had never thought of setting my broccoli in with my noodles at the very end.  In the end hubby loved it.

I made this last night for my husband and I and he loved it! He always likes what I make, but this he said was AMAZING. I made a few changes. Since I don't really like mushrooms, I changed the cream to cream of brocolli. Also, I added 1 can of table cream and about half a cup of milk. I sauteed the chicken with minced garlic and italian seasoning, which added that strong alfredo taste. A generous amount of cheese made it just perfect.

Some changes I made was to crisp six slices of bacon in the pan (instead of using butter), then fry chicken in bacon fat.  I crushed the bacon and added to sauce mix.  Also substituted cream for the milk portion and topped the finished dish with Romano cheese.  The changes added a “carbonara” like quality.

This definitely isn't an Alfredo recipe but it is fantastic!! Very easy to make and really yummy. If you have leftovers, just throw it in a pan and put a little water or milk in it and it turns into the same creamy pasta that you started out with. Definitely making it again, loved it.

We made this for dinner tonight and it was nice and creamy, very good! I could only give 4 stars because it lacked garlic! We added it to the chicken which we cubed to 1/2" and cooked in the wok with 2 tspns butter at 300f. One tspn minced garlic per breast worked well. I never would have thought to add mushroom soup to thicken an alfredo sauce! Overall, delicious so thank you for a great recipe!

This is okay, but just for fun I made it two ways.  The first way is according to the recipe.  The second way was with commerically prepared precooked cubed chicken and Paul Newman's Own Alfredo.  Truth be told...the Alfredo was better which made the whole dish better not to mention faster.  Just an experiment for what it's worth.

Excellent! Quick and Easy-
I made the recipe as it calls, only I added mushrooms and some garlic powder while browning the chicken and shrooms.

A quick and easy dinner that is fairly flavorful. I didn't care much about the way it looked and it could have used a little more spices. I used 1 1/2 cups of broccoli and could have even used more. Overall, a fair dish.

Great recipe! I did change some things. I did half cream of mushroom/cream of chicken and threw in a tbsp of garlic paste. I also threw in 3 large mushrooms (chopped) and 1/2 red pepper which I put in when the chicken was almost cooked. I added 1/2 parm chz and 1/2 mozza. Hope this helps :) Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and son thought this was delicious!  Perfect amount of sauce, chicken and noodles, only adjustment would be to add more broccoli and parm, just because we love both!  Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I didn't like it as much as my son.  He LOVED it!  The only thing I changed was I used Cream of Chicken {we don't like mushrooms} and I used fettuccini instead of linguine, {all I had on hand}  and I used left over baked chicken for the meat.

This one will def. be accompaning me to girls night this weekend. I will be making this dish for years to come

No one in my family cared for this.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  It was very bland, needed more broccoli.  Mostly the alfredo base was just lacking flavor.  The cream of mushroom soup wasn't cutting it.

This is very good, simple, and kid-friendly.  The only change I would make is triple the broccoli if you like it.  Our family loves broccoli and 1 cup just wasn't enough.  This is great served with a salad and garlic bread.

I was pretty disappointed with the lack of flavors in this dish.  I added saute mushrooms, salt, A LOT of pepper and more cheese and it still tasted like a can of mushroom soup.  I'm sorry but I will not be making this again.

Super easy and very tasty!  It tastes even better the next day when all the flavors have blended together.  I used rotini pasta as it does a better job of holding the sauce.

This was OKAY. I made it exactly as written, and I wasn't impressed. It's not BAD, just not good. The mushrooms didn't really bother me, they're pretty uch microscopic. The problem is it doesn't taste like alfredo at all, so I think naming it that really makes people expect something different. I, personally, won't bother making it again. Maybe if they re-named it, it'd get different perspective, because as an alfredo this just doesn't cut it.

I had been using the canned alfredo sauce to make my chicken and broccoli alfredo and this recipe does not even compare, it was so good!  I baked the chicken the night before in bread crumbs and refrigerated it overnight. I also substituted linguine with cellentani, added an extra cup of frozen broccoli, and a cup of mozzarella cheese to make it extra gooey! I am not a big fan of mushrooms so instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used a cream of broccoli soup and it came of great. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I thought this recipe was good, but I didn't think it tasted like alfredo. It wasn't as creamy as I would have liked, but I will try it again and add something to make it creamier.

I was hesitant with the cream of mushroom but it was delicious. I loved this recipe, I was looking for something good for lunch one day since I didn't have school. Honestly, this recipe is worth recreating!!

I made this for my wife and I after reading the great reviews.  I was looking for something that would be quick to make on a weeknight.  My wife is a big alfredo fan.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added a couple of cloves of garlic to the butter/chicken mixture.  We both loved it!  I was really surprised how alfredo tasting it was!  Very cheesy and very good.

I doubled the recipe and used fusilli instead of linguine. I also used bacon instead of chicken, I think next time I will add chicken along with the bacon. Terrific recipe!!

I made this following the recipe exactly. I personally think this was extremely bland. It lacked a lot. After dinner I read more of the reviews and wish I would have added the garlic and sour cream to the sauce and more broccoli or a mix of vegetables.  Side note: my 4 year old picky eater absolutely LOVED it! Go figure.

If you're looking for a truly authentic Alfredo meal.... this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a fast, tasty, creamy home-cooked meal, you've found a great recipe for it!  I used penne pasta, sauteed some garlic before cooking the chicken, and added a large dollop of cream cheese. I only used a few good sprinklings of parmesean cheese. It was really good, and really fast.

This came out great.  Normally I'm a little skeptical of the Campbell's recipes because if you do them how they are written they tend to be bland.  I used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic and seasoned my chicken with pepper, adobo, garlic powder and onion powder (I do this with chicken no matter what I'm doing with it).  I agree that it needs more broccoli...I used almost two cups and still think I should have used more.  Everything else was done just as the recipe called for and I was shocked how good it tasted.  Next time I'm going to try it with penne and probably add some shrimp to the mix.  All and all, a good recipe!

Ohhhh...my...goodness! I tried this recipe and when I got a whiff of the chicken and butter cooking in the pan plus the broccoli and linguini cooking at the same time...be still my heart!  However, when I sat down at my dinner table and took the first bite I was in heaven! This dish was simply delicious...which is an understatement! All I have left to conclude with is anyone within earshot and love pasta like I do, you will need to experience this exquisite delightful dish! I made too much and delighted in that thought alone!

This was a good, quick recipe for a weeknight meal! I didn't have frozen broccoli so I substituted a 1/2 bag of frozen peas/carrots/beans. I also had a large can of Tyson cooked chunk chicken that I added instead of cooking the chicken breasts which made this super quick! I was out of parmesan cheese so I substituted shredded mozzerella cheese which melted nicely and tasted great! I would make this again.

Very quick and good! I was looking for a recipe to stretch 1 chicken breast to feed 4 people and this was it!  I used about a 1/2 pound of chicken, added some garlic and took the suggestion of a top review to add 2 ounces of cream cheese.  You could not tell at all this was made from a can of soup as a base. Very tasty and versatile.  I could see this with seafood or even just different veggies.

This recipe is easy to make but the cream of mushroom soup was overwhelming even after adding more parmesan cheese.  Didn't taste like the traditional alfredo sauce at all.  I'm deleting this recipe from my box.

My little 5 year old picky eater ate this and said, " Mommy you're the best cooker ever, this is soooo good"   Also, my older son who hates mushrooms  ate this without even realizing that it was made with mushroom soup. When I asked him how he liked it , he said, he thought it was really good.

Very good but needs easily triple the amount of broccoli.  I reduced the butter to 1 tbsp and the milk fat free to try and lighten it up.  I will make again with much more brocolli.

I had some broccoli to use up and had all of the other ingredients on hand so I decided to try this. It's a good, reasonably quick meal. I suggest serving it with a garlic or cheese bread.

This was the first dish I've made here on AR.  I'm a college student majoring in Marketing and I just picked up a Minor in Health/Nutrition.  I thought this was excellent!  Loved it, and so did my family.  I think it needed just a little bit more milk and a hint of salt and it tasted perfect.

I sauted some onion, mushroom, and garlic with the chicken. I also put in about 11/2t of italion seasoning in the sauce. Everyone liked it. I felt that it was missing some zip. Next time I will add more seasoning to the sauce, and saute some jalipenos along with the chicken.

Yummy~! To the person that had a complaint about the mushrooms, so just use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup.

I used chicken tenders, didn't have broccoli so I added frozen peas. Added more milk till  I got the consistency I wanted for the sauce. Other than that left as is, this is a great quick fix and the sauce definatly taste better than store bought.

We loved this! But I had to make a few changes since my husband cannot have cream of mushroom soup -- long story, but suffice it to say that he's extremely sensitive to MSG and any free glutamate. So I had to make my own-- and since he hates mushrooms too, I just made cream of chicken soup. There's a few good recipes around to make cream of chicken soup, and I dare say it's better for us than the kind you buy in a can! ;) But over all, it was a great dish and we loved it!! Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful dish.  I love that it can be made quickly!  I do recommend that you add 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.

SO FAST. SO EASY. SO GOOD. I don't know if this is a true Alfredo taste, but it does taste great! I've made it a couple of times, with alterations the second time: I used Penne; I think it works much better. I used a whole small-medium sized broccoli worth of flowerets (approx 3 cups I think); seemed the perfect amount. I also used trim pork schnitzel strips the second time instead of chicken, and it worked great. DEFINITELY A KEEPER.

For being as simple as this was and using reduced fat soup - I think this is pretty good. I'd make it again. :)  Thanks! Added garlic powder, extra parmesan and red pepper flake.

Although hubby really enjoyed this, I found it to be pretty bland and didn't think much for the cream of mushroom alfredo sauce.  I even used garlic whole wheat linguini, sauteed the chicken with garlic and spices, and added sauteed fresh mushrooms.  I probably won't make this again.

Thought it was quite bland as is.  Definitely would recommend the garlic.  Used rotini b/c that's what I had on hand, but forgot how much more sauce it would absorb than just linguini, so mine was a little dry.

It was very good. The only I would like is a little more sauce. I did add a little bit of garlic powder to since my family loves garlic. This was a hit in my family, even my 2 1/2 year old ate 2 bowls of it.

Very good, easy dinner.  I used ziti and liked that better.  The sauce doesn't taste like cream of mushroom soup, but also not an alfredo sauce.  Still very good!

This was quite yummy. I doctored it a bit by sauteeing garlic in the butter and then adding chicken I'd seasoned very thoroughly (Adobo, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, cayenne, and black pepper) and then I added onion, and green and red pepper to the mix. Was a hit at our house!

i loved this recipe. I live by myself so this saves time during the week. I read through a lot of the reviews and i decided to try the basil oregano and garlic cloves, oh, and cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic...as you can tell i am a big garlic fan. i'll definitely make this again.

This was surprisingly good! My husband thought it was way too decadent to possibly be healthy. But I did make it using mostly low fat ingredients. I used whole wheat linguini, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, 1 cup fat free half-and-half, and about 2/3 cup reduced fat parmesean cheese. I also added Italian seasoning to the sauce. When I sauteed the chicken, I added in a healthy spoonful of chopped garlic. This is the best recipe I have made using cream of something soup.

I tried this recipe last night for dinner and my husband and daughters are very picky..  They loved it and I did too!!!!..  It was so simple and fast and soooo tasty..  I did do some changes for added flavor, I grilled the chicken and added smoke chips...Actually left over chicken from the grill would have probably worked out too..I did not have any broccoli so I used fresh green beans and baby portabellas and replaced the milk with condensed milk for more flavor.  Then I served it over baby greens and topped with sliced grape tomatoes toasted slivered almonds and a sprinkle of fresh ground cheese.  This is a great recipe!!!  Thank you

The first time I made this recipe exactly as written.  I enjoyed it but I felt like it needed a little more punch.  My boyfriend really, really liked it so I knew that I would make this again.  The next time I prepared this recipe I sprinkled a little garlic powder in the sauce and I added more parmesan cheese.  These changes gave the recipe the extra I needed.  I'm sure that I will continue to make this chicken and broccoli alfredo on a regular basis.  Its easy, doesn't take much time or ingredients and the sauce has a nice flavor even with it being made from a reduced fat cream of mushroom soup.

This is good but doesn't really taste like alfredo sauce. The kids thought it was okay but didn't love it.

Great!  Everyone loved it!  Wished there was more.  I will double the soup/milk/cheese next time and use a full box of pasta.

Really liked this a lot. I used the olive oil suggestion to saute the chicken and I added sun dried tomatoes and black olives. Yummy! I also used Penne pasta instead which makes it much easier to eat! I doubled the broccoli too! My kids favorite meal.

This was very good! I made blackened chicken instead of regular and was shocked at how good and easy this was to make. The blackened chicken recipe was found on this site also.

husband liked it, ate two whole plates.  me, not so much. i guess i'm used to a thinner sauce?  i'm 7 months pregnant, and find that if it doesn't taste like i think it's going to then it's not what i want.  that could be it.

For what this recipe has in it, it's pretty good!  Just a can of soup, some broccoli, a little cheese, and some chicken!?!  WOW, Super easy and tasted good too!  If you don't have the cheese it will still come out tasting good, it just wont be as thick or creamy of a sauce.  Oh, and the pickey little brother of the family liked it too.

I'm not a big mushroom fan, and the cream of mushroom soup was overpowering. If I make it again I will substitute cream of chicken or cream of celery. The picky 7-year-old, however, scarfed it down and asked for seconds. I call that a win!

I doubled the broccoli (and would add another cup next time) and used a little less chicken, which I grilled.  I also added 1 oz cream cheese and garlic but it was still bland.   My family seemed to like it and it is a good quick meal since you are likely to have all the ingredients in the house but it was just okay.

This was such an easy recipe to follow, and it was delicious! I do agree with some of the other reviews though about the Cream of a Mushroom Soup, so I only used about 3 tbspns of it as opposed to the whole can!  I used fettuccine noodles and added Philadelphia Cream cheese and a little bit of garlic.  Alfredo sauces usually dry out for me rather fast, so I doubled the butter, and doubled the whipping cream (instead of milk)! Great Recipe!

I'm a big fan of alfredo sauce and I absolutely loved this! I also added some garlic salt, sea salt, and some Knorr Aromat All Purpose Seasoning. Yum! And my hubby doesn't usually care for alfredo, but he actually liked this. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, considering the main ingredient is canned soup.  Our whole family liked it well enough that it'll be in our rotation, especially for nights when we need dinner fast.  Typically recipes take me longer to prepare than it states, but I had this one done and on the table in 29 minutes.

This recipe is very simple and tasty!! This can be modified to suit individual's tastes.. I used rotini pasta, one chicken breast (I tend to prefer more vegetables) and a family sized bag of frozen broccoli.  A few dashes of crushed red pepper gives it some kick.  For tender chicken I marinate it for a couple of hours, an Italian style marinade adds some flavor.

This was a big hit at dinner and very easy. I added a 1/4 cup more milk which coated the pasta a bit more thorough. And also added a variation of garlic/herb Boursin soft cheese, 1/2 container.  Great!

I altered this a bit but either way it would be delish!  I used wide curly noodles.  Sauteed a cup of sliced mushrooms in olive oil and deglazed with one-quarter cup sherry and added to chicken.  I also used one-half cup plain yogurt instead of milk, and a little water to thin out. Also seasoned with garlic powder.

Yummy....my family really enjoyed this dish.  I tweaked recipe by adding sour cream (2 tbs) and garlic powder (1/2 tsp) as suggested by one of the other readers.  I did not add brocolli to dish, instead served it as side dish.  If short on time, this is the recipe for you.  Quick and easy.  Delicious.

I made this for my best friend and her boyfriend and they loved it.  I did however add cream cheese and fresh mushrooms.  I usually make my own alfredo sauce, so I was suprised at how good and easy it was. This recipe is going into my recipe box here at allrecipes!

I found the recipe on the can and love it. I use as much cheese as possible and it doesn't make it too heavy. This is the perfect after work recipe. It comes together so quickly. Deni

Easy, great on a budget and best of all delicious! Cut time by using the pre cooked Perdue short cuts and went healthier with the low sodium soup and fresh broccoli - the kids and man in my house all went for seconds!!

This was an easy recipe.  I doubled the recipe but only added one can of soup. I also had some asiago cheese to use so I subbed it in for half the parm.  The whole family liked it from my dad who made a funny face when I told him what we were having to my daughter who more than once said it looked and smelled disgusting! Huge hit in the end with multiple thumbs up!

i loved this recipe,putting the cheese made it taste like alfredo instead of mushrooms. i gave it a four because my little brother didnt like it that much becausei put too much sauce in it and not enough noodles. next time i make this i will do that and put more broccoli (also i will cut the chicken in strips). But overall everyone minus one liked this recipe in my family, and i would make this again!

I made this version of "Chicken Alfredo" last night.  I wouldn't really call this Alfredo sauce, but this was really good and easy to make.  I wanted to make something quick when I got home from work, so here's what I did:

- I sauteed 1/2 of a small yellow onion with 1 clove of garlic and S&P, then set this aside
- I used chicken tenders because I didn't want to pound the chicken breasts to make them thin.  Plus the tenders cook faster!

- Seasoned chicken with garlic powder, basil, and a little of rotisserie seasoning.  Cooked until done and then removed the chicken from the pan.  Sliced chicken on cutting board

- added a little more butter to the pan, soup, milk, cheese, black pepper, and mixed well. Added the saute onion & garlic mixture, linguine & broccoli, then chicken.  Seasoned with a pinch of salt and more basil!  After it was done cooking, I left the burner on low while the garlic bread was in the oven.

Great with Texas Toast Garlic bread...yummy :) 

Oh one more thing, I sprinkled more cheese on top once I served it!

I sauteed 2 minced garlic cloves and 1/2 cup of button mushrooms with the chicken in 1 TBS of olive oil, I omitted the butter to make it healthier. I also added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp dried basil to soup mixture. This is just what the recipe needed to taste more like Alfredo sauce!

Loved this, made it for my boyfriend as a surprise and he says, "It's my new favorite meal." So simple and easy to make especially for me who barely has any cooking experience. Going to try it out again for my parents, see what they think.

This was really good and quick to make. Couldn't taste the mushrooms in the soup. 1/4 tsp of pepper is a lot so I only seasoned to taste. I have made this with regular cream of mushroom soup and reduced fat. The reduced fat tasted just as good so it is worth the switch!

Very Good! I wouldn't say that it tastes like authentic alfredo, it definitely has that 'cream of mushroom' taste, but it was easy and very satisfying! I will make again!

It was just okay... To me it taste like soup and chicken pasta.  Not a real alfredo taste at all... I will not make this again... I was expecting so much more in the taste but with the ingredients I should have not had such high hopes... If you like bland foods this is for you... This is sure not Olive Garden Alfredo or anything close.

This was incredibly easy and quick for my beginner-cook self. It came out GREAT and was way healthier than regular alfredo would be. I did season the chicken with some stuff from the cupboard, and I used olive oil instead of butter. I think next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will experiment with adding cream cheese or a little sour cream to give it that alfredo kick.

This was really good! I marinated my chicken in some lemon juice, lemon pepper, and garlic sauce, and then sauteed it in the pan with some butter before adding in the rest of the ingredients.  It was really much better than I expected it to be, and so quick and easy. Also, I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom because it is what I had on hand.  It turned out great, I'll definitely make this again when I'm looking for an easy and tasty recipe!

I am rating this only 4 stars cause I had to make some changes cause I thought it would be a little bland as is.  Really great basic recipe though! I doubled it cause I had 2 pounds of chicken breast.  I didn't double the amount of butter though, I still only used 2 tbsp.  I used around 2 1/2 cups of fresh broccoli, added a can of cream of chicken soup and used grated mozza cheese instead of parmesan cheese cause my husband isn't that fond of it.  I omitted the pepper but I added around 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp of club house lemon herb seasoning to the chicken while it was cooking.  After the chicken was browned I stirred in around 1/4 cup of chopped onion and 2 crushed garlic cloves and cooked it for a few minutes.  My whole family really liked it.  Will definitely make it again.

This dish was a hit with my family.  It was easy to prepare and is a great dish to make when you are pressed for time.  I did change it just a tad....I added fresh garlic and a red bell pepper chopped fine for color.  I also just happened to have low fat half and half, so I substituted that for the milk.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

YUM! One of my first real experiences cooking in the kitchen and one of my favorite recipes. The chicken prep definitely takes more time than the 20 mins., but maybe that's just me. Perfect for work lunches and leftover dinners!

This was a really a quick, easy, and delicious recipe. Just being a broken record, but I would definitely spice it up a little. I used onion powder, garlic powder, lemongrass powder, some dried red pepper, and a little seasoned salt. And it just gave it a small kick.

I didn't find anything redeeming about this dish. It has no flavor and I don't think the cream of mushroom soup makes for any kind of alfredo sauce.

Great recipe.  So easy and fast.  My family raved about it and said it needs to replace the chicken, broccoli, & ziti recipe I was using before I tried this.  Next time, I will change 2 things:  I'll use more broccoli, and I'll add some garlic powder or try the roasted garlic variety of the mushroom soup...just to add some extra flavor!

Loved this dish, who need's the cheese?!  My family liked it just as well without the parmesan.  I know...its not Alfredo without it, but we aren't big cheese eaters anyway.  We are not fans of meals made with soup either, but this one surprised us...it was tasty and very easy.  Our favorite is to use left-over rotissiere chicken.  Cooking the broccoli in with the noodles is the best idea ever.  Fast, easy..great for leftovers too.

Very quick and easy dinner.  I might try it with canned chicken next time since the sauteed chicken cubes didn't have much flavor.  Also, I will definitely add more milk since this was slightly too thick for our tastes.  Otherwise worth keeping in the rotation.  I liked another reviewer's suggestion about adding a can of diced tomatoes with chilis....that might add a fun kick.

This was wonderful, and so easy.  I used pre-cooked, seasoned chicken breasts to save time (left off the butter since they were already cooked).  I used an entire 1-lb. package of frozen broccoli (needed more veggies), and egg noodles instead of spaghetti (easier to eat).  I would suggest mixing the soup, milk, and pepper in a separate bowl before adding to the remaining ingredients (easier to incorporate the soup that way).  Thanks for the recipe!

Very quick, easy and delicious! I added 2 oz of cream cheese as others did and some fresh chopped garlic. I also did a version of half chicken and half shrimp and everybody loved it. Just to spice it up I added a few shakes of crushed red pepper.

I enjoyed this meal and it was very fast and easy. The only thing I wasn't fond of was my sauce was VERY thick. I know it's supposed to be thick, but mine was more than expected. It could be because I used whole wheat pasta which might have absorbed more liquid...(?) I just added extra milk and it was very delicious.

Thought this recipe was really good considering the ease of it and the ability to make it low fat. I added garlic and asparagus to the mix. It was really good! I also used the reduced calorie/fat cream soup and low fat milk. It hit the spot for something warm and creamy without a lot of extra calories.

IMO, not enough sauce to go with the amount of pasta that the recipe called for. It was also a bit bland. Next time I'm going to use some garlic, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and a cup of milk. It was good - just needs some tweeking. Thanks.

Good recipe, not great. It doesn't taste like alfredo, so calling it that is a little misleading. But a yummy chicken and pasta dish. Very easy to make.

This recipe was really good and the sauce was quite delightful despite so few ingredients!  I did put 2 1/2 cups broccoli though.  Also, I marinated the chicken in 2 Tbsp olive oil, 2 Tbsp vinegar, 1 minced garlic clove, 2 Tbsp Parmesan, and 1/4 tsp oregano.  Excellent!

This is a very simple recipe.   I wanted the sauce to be thicker/richer so I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup half and half as well as about 2 tablespoons cream cheese. I also added extra broccoli. Delicious and quite rich!

My husband and I both enjoyed this receipe a lot. I had some left over chicken I needed to do something with, and found this recipe which fit perfect. It was really easy and great when you can't find something to fix and are tired of the same old meals. The video was helpful also.

This recipe was good, or would've been if I had made it exactly right - I tried to use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  I dont recommend... but it was simple and a good main course!

This recipe really surprized me at how good it was.  I made a few changes like cooking the chicken with some fresh garlic and I used whole wheat spaghetti.This tasted like something I would order from a restaurant!!! Make sure you use REAL parmesan not the stuff in the green can.  I also added 2 TB of cream cheese and I used half and half instead of skim milk. Try this recipe!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!

I wanted leftovers so I doubled the recipe.  Recipe is good with a few changes.  We had grilled some chicken breasts (marinated in italian dressing and seasoned salt) the night  before so I used these and the taste was terrific. Per another review, I used the mushroom with roasted garlic soup. I also used fat free half and half instead of the milk. I still felt it needed more flavor so I added garlic salt, basil, and oregano.  I like this recipe because it is truly a one pot dish if you used precooked chicken and cook the broccoli with the pasta. Also, I was skeptical this would taste like alfredo but the end result was creamy and you could adjust the alfredo taste depending on the amount of parmesan cheese you use. I need more recipes like this!

This recipe was really easy and super good!  I added 2 cloves of garlic while I sauteed the chicken, and a can of peas and carrots when I combined all the ingredients.  It turned out great and I will definitely make this many many more times!

This recipe is so easy to make and tastes a lot better than I thought it would. I really didn't taste the mushrooms and it had a great Alfredo taste. The only complaint I have is that the recipe needed to be seasoned a little bit w/ garlic salt.

This was pretty good!  I sauteed the chicken with a light sprinkle of seasoned salt, onion powder and a couple cloves of fresh crushed garlic. I used whole wheat wide noodles because that's what I had. It doesn't taste exactly like chicken alfredo but I didn't make this thinking that it would taste just like it so I was not disappointed. I highly recommend adding the fresh garlic.  Next time I will do like someone else said and add some cream cheese. I didn't have any or I would have this time.

This was a good recipe, very yummy.  Based on other reviews, I made the following changes: I cut the amount of chicken by 1/3, and used about double the amount of broccoli.  I also think penne or bowtie pasta would make the dish a little easier to scoop and serve.  But overall, a good dish, tasty and quick . . perfect for a busy weeknight meal!

I made this tonight for supper. I used rigatoni, and cooked up the whole box, setting half aside for a meal later in the week. I put fresh broccoli in with the boiling pasta for the last four minutes. I used fresh parm. Everyone loved it. Good stuff, and easy.

This was very good and easy.I used fresh grated Pecorino Romano cheese because that is what I had on hand,and sauted 3 cloves garlic with chicken.Although I think It would be fine without the garlic Just my preference.

The recipe was a quick easy meal that tasted good so I gave it three stars.  It didn't taist like chicken alfredo though, so I was disapointed about that, but my kids liked it better that way.  I substituted cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.

I made this last night with a few tweaks.  I added 1/2 diced onion, one clove of garlic, minced, and some sliced fresh mushrooms to the saute of the chicken, as well as salt and pepper.  I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup. I also added 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella at the end, and some chopped fresh parsley.

It was awesome!  My family loved it.

Good recipe! Although I must admit I added a couple things.  In addition to the parmesan, I added 1/2 cup mozzerella, and doubled the amount of milk.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of ketchup, to give it a little tomato taste.  (Chopped or stewed tomatoes might also be good)  Overall, good, easy recipe.

Perfect for when you just need some quick comfort food. I love that all of the ingredients are things that I could easily have in my pantry or freezer at just about any given time, which makes it a great fallback option if the night’s original dinner plan doesn’t work out. And I was surprised by how good it tasted!

This was very easy and wasn’t bad tasting. But it also wasn’t great. The flavor kind of reminded me of tuna noodle casserole. I think next time I make it I will just do the old cream cheese and half n half recipe. I’ll probably also add some garlic too for a bit more flavor.

Fast, easy and pretty good. Im not a fan of cream of mushroom soup so I substituted Cream of celery.  I doubled the amount of broccoli and still felt it could have used more. Also added some garlic salt. My husband and son really enjoyed it but felt it needed more chicken.

This is definitely a winner! Instead of cooking frozen veggies with the pasta, I sauteed fresh veg with the chicken in the pan. They were not overcooked and worked perfectly. I diced 2 lg chicken breasts, seasoned well, and put into hot olive oil and butter mixed. Right away I cut up 1/2 an onion, 2 cloves garlic, and added to the chicken. Then chopped whatever veggies I had on hand, tonight it was cauliflower and zucchini.  And added to the partly cooked chicken, with more salt, pepper, herbs. The rest I did as written, except I used grated mozzarella and sprinkled the powdery type of parmesan at the end.  Used whole wheat pasta and this was very flavorful and easy to make. Success!!

I just made it for Dinner and it was really easy to make. I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushrooms. I did like it but feel like something was missing it needed a little bit more taste

Good but not exceptional. It was a little bland. Otherwise, I liked how quick it was to make. I may try it again but add sauteed onions and mushrooms to it.

My 17 year old daughter and her boyfriend made this together.  She tried to pick out a recipe that we had all the ingredients for but we ended up changing a few things as we didn't have them.  She used spaghetti noodles instead of linguine and frozen spinach instead of broccoli.  I ended up adding 1/2 cup more milk as it seemed very thick.  Next time we will add some pasta water to thin it out some and add in some garlic.  It was a hit with the boys, but I could have used more savory sauce.

The meal came out good. The family loved the meal. Due to me using more than usual noodles, the meal was dry. However; it was still good to the family.

It was very easy to make, but didn't have a lot of flavor. I think I'll experiment with spices in the future and add more broccoli.

I loved this recipe! Very easy to make in no time. I did add another cup of broccoli flowerets instead of 1 cup. My family loves broccoli. I highly recommend this meal to others! Also, my time spent in the supermarket was about 20 minutes to find these ingredients.

I added 1/4 c. chopped sauted onion and 2 t. minced garlic and used rotini pasta in place of linguine.  Everyone in my family had at least seconds - 2 people had thirds!  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Quick and easy!  Added 2 cloves of minced garlic, button mushrooms sliced and about 3/4 c more milk as I like my sauce "saucier".  May have been thicker as I used low fat cream of mushroom soup.

Really good taste for such a simple recipe! I will double, or at least 1.5x’s the sauce next time as I like it a little saucier.

This was a delicious and fulfilling meal. I've made some tweaks: I've used a small size of chicken breast and added more frozen broccoli. I also used store brand cream of mushroom soup instead of Campbell's. I'll make it again of course.

This was a really easy recipe! It doesn’t quite pass for Alfredo, but if you’re not a stickler (or if you just don’t have time), this is still a pretty good sauce and quick to the dinner table. 

I’ll admit it was slightly bland to me, but I might have used too much chicken and not enough butter...I put in what I had. I might add a bit more black pepper or Parmesan next time for more flavor. I will make it again!

I found this recipe a few years ago and it is something we’ve been eating at least once a week. The flavors are amazing and it’s filling and very savory. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to make a quick satisfying dinner!

I think it would be better with more parmesan and salt. It still mostly tastes like cream of mushroom, but it's pretty good.

Really tasty for being a quick method starting with soup. I cooked the chicken in the crock pot so didn’t use the butter. Just added the cooked chopped meat to the sauce.

Very easy way to make an alfredo pasta dish with chicken. Could also use cream of chicken soup. Adding the broccoli at the end made it easy to prep.

Very simple recipe.  I added about a ¼ cup of sour cream,  ¼ bar of cream cheese, 1 ½ tsp of garlic powder and/ increased the broccoli to 2 cups.   I also added 1 ¼ cup of fresh grated Mozzarella and a little extra Parmesan right before serving. So Yummy!  We loved it.  Oh and the garlic bread is a must to top it off.  I know I will be making this again... as well as continue experimenting with substitutions.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was DELICIOUS!!  My kids and the hubs all loved it and agreed that it can definitely be added to the rotation. Wasn’t very “saucy” and I’m certain that I’ll have to add a bit of milk or broth to the leftovers because it was a bit sticky to start. Otherwise, very tasty and a definite keeper!!

Used Cream of Chicken with herbs (because that's what I had on hand), added some havarti cheese I had in the fridge in addition to the Parmesan.  Quick, easy, and makes a lot!  Loved it for lunch the next day also!

First time I made an alfredo sauce so I had nothing to compare it to.  It was relatively quick and easy and the taste was pleasant but I think I was looking for more of a cheese flavor.  Next time I might just add more parmesan and see what happens.

Loved this! I hate the taste of jar alfredo, but am not the greatest cook either. This was a simple chicken alfredo dish that didn't require too many ingredients. I added some garlic powder to the chicken when it was browning, and an onion and extra broccoli. Next time might throw some bell peppers in too.

It did taste like alfredo, I must say! I was a bit surprised since it was Cream of Mushroom. I made it as given, but used a whole box of linguine. I added a bit more milk and parm but next time I will use two cans of soup. I had used a lot of rotisserie chicken, and threw in a half package of peas with my thawed broccoli. It had a very good flavor.

I agree with some comments, no mushrooms for me. Any kind of mushroom in fact. I cheated, haha I just used a alfredo sauce and added milk and the butter to make it creamy. Then everything else it mentioned.

Excellent!  We are vegetarians so I used Faux "chicken" from Trader Joe's, and I added sautéed fresh mushrooms, 3 cups fresh broccoli which I blanched, soy milk in place of cows milk, garlic powder.  It had wonderful flavor but it was a little dry, (possibly because I added ingredients?).  Pasta always soaks up the sauce in dishes, so, even though the flavor was great, I opened a jar of  alfredo sauce and added just enough to moisten it more.  This recipe still gets five stars in spite of my "doctoring" because to me there is nothing better than a good base recipe to play with.

Great dish.  Husband and three year old loved it.  I cooked the chicken breasts in my pressure cooker first then just added to the pasta mixture.  I also added a couple bell peppers.

I added garlic to the chicken when cooking and plenty of cracked pepper to give it a nice bite. I also doubled the broccoli amount to give it a better balance of chicken & broccoli. Its one of the easiest and yummiest recipes I've come across. Great for the whole family on weeknights.

The ingredients don't add up to a gourmet meal. Accepting that, it's best viewed as a guide to personalize it. My chicken turned out moist as heck, though I 'up seasoned' them prior to searing. Turn the temp down once they've done so. I found this a little salty what with seasoning the chicken...salting the pasta water...and using cream of whatever soup. It didn't help that I added a couple of diced bacon. Then I cooked the broc in bacon fat. Use your imagination...different soup...add other cheese or sour cream. Otherwise it's naturally a bit dull :).

I made this recipe in a pinch, although, it was quick and easy I was not impressed. I would definitely not call this alfredo but more of a skillet casserole. I used leftover roasted chicken, fresh broccoli and egg noodles instead of linguini and followed the recipe as written. I did add about a quarter cup of pasta water to thin out the sauce a bit. In the end it tasted like mushroom soup with pasta. Not sure if I will make this again but if I did I would add garlic and more parmigiana cheese.

I was influenced by the previous high reviews.  For me this was an easy recipe but I did not enjoy the flavor.  It does not taste like alfredo to me.  All I can taste is the mushroom soup.

It was pretty good, however; I would enjoyed cream of broccoli or cream of chicken soup so much more than the mushroom. 

Also I wouldn't call this an alfredo sauce per say, but just a creamy sauce

My 6 year old son loves this recipe and it was so quick and easy to make. I didn't cook my chicken in butter, but I did add butter to the sauce. I also used a steam bag of broccoli. It was delicious.

It was OK. I followed the recipe as is, I didn't make any tweaks. My family of 4  ate it, but weren't impressed.   I won't make it again.  I don't know why they call this Alfredo, it tastes too much like mushroom to be an Alfredo sauce. I thought I could sneak this by my husband who doesn't like mushrooms too much and he tasted it right away. I found the whole dish to be very bland in taste, even the chicken was boring. BUT it was quick to make, and edible. :)

It was OK.  If your husband buys too many cans of cream of mushroom soup. ..it's a nice way to get through them but as far as alfreado... IT IS NOT. It reminds me of how I make my tuna casserole with can soup.  For alfreado sauce  it's better to either  buy the pre-made or create for yourself with heavy cream, butter, Parmersan cheese, and spices to your own taste.

Absolutely loved this dish! I did make a few minor changes as I was cooking. I used 1 1/2 cans of the Cream of Mushroom Soup and also I doubled the amount of butter that the recipe called for. Also, to save yourself time, buy a already made rotisserie chicken, chop up the pieces that you need, and reheat with the sauce in the skillet.

Could not believe how delicious this was!  I rarely cook with canned soup products, but this is one recipe I'll be making over and over and over again.  I did jazz up the chicken a bit by marinating it in a little olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, salt & pepper for a good hour or so - but aside from that stayed true to recipe.  Will double the amount of broccoli next time (personal preference) ... didn't weigh our chicken, but used 1 large and 1 medium size breast so it was probably pretty close to a pound.  Served with romaine salad and garlic bread.  Hubs has already had 2 plates and is claiming the last portion for his lunch tomorrow.  Snap to make.  Oh - forgot - I didn't use Parmesan cheese - used freshly grated Pecorino Romano which was perfect.

I tried this Alfredo recipe because 1) I had all the ingredients, 2) I wanted something tasty, 3) I needed something fast. This recipe fit the bill on all 3 points. I read some of the reviewers suggestions and the idea of using cream cheese sounds like a great idea. I used some rotisserie chicken - mixed, not just breast. It was pretty easy and passed the family's test for keeping recipes. I will make it again.

Loved the sauce!!! I did add 3oz of cream cheese to the soup mix after reading reviews and it was delicious. The chicken was a little plain though so that's why I gave this recipe 4 stars

I`m a cooking dad and my wife and kids love it when I do. This recipe was great! I made it with tri-color penne and it was terrific. Rich creamy Alfredo sauce and the broccoli was perfect al dente. A keeper!

I don't think this tastes like alfredo, it reminded me of tuna noodle casserole.  not a bad recipe but gave it the 3 stars due to the non-alfredo taste!

This dish was very tasty and easy to make....very nice flavor with simple ingredients.  I doubled the recipe for the 4 of us and had approx. 2 servings left over.  I used a large non-stick wok for cooking the chicken which made adding all the ingredients at the end easier for mixing.  Also, adding the broccoli to the linguine during the last 4 min. of cooking was perfect and made for less clean up.  I try new receipes often, and although they can be hit or miss, both my boys gave this a thumbs up and said it was a keeper.  My husband and I agreed.

This was a hit last night! Cooking for two guys is hard enough, but they both ate it like there was no tomorrow! I made entirely way too much, but now we've got leftovers for the next few days! As much as we enjoyed this recipe, I ended up adding in a pinch of garlic salt, basil and parsely while the chicken was browning (and while the noodles were cooking). I also used actual alfredo sauce, we are not mushroom fans. I also gratted colby & sharp cheddar and added it with the parmsan. Overall great meal, with my own twist! Will be making this again!

I just finished eating this dish about ten minutes ago and it was FANTASTIC.  To be honest, I was skeptical about the recipe, but it was flavorful and filling.  I have tried 3 alfredo recipes from allrecipes.com in the last few weeks (in an attempt to find the perfect alfredo), and this was by far my favorite so far.  I used whole wheat pasta instead of regular pasta, and this recipe was still delicious.  I DID season the chicken slightly with garlic and italian seasoning while cooking it, which was my only change.  Fantastic.  Good job, Campbell's.  :-)

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit but like others, I did change it some. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 2oz of cream cheese and also some red pepper flakes. I thought it was very creamy and actually quite rich. I couldn't finish my whole plate. Also, I would probably do the entire box of linguine next time since it seemed like there wasn't quite enough pasta. I do love my pasta though! And it might have been a bit more than 1lb of chicken.

This was a great recipe to find. It's very easy to make, and perfect for when you want to avoid yet another tomato sauce. You can make it with different types of pasta just fine. I like to use lean ground turkey instead of chicken, and add quite a bit more black pepper.

Absolutely delicious!  I was going to make something else for dinner tonight, but I came across this recipe and happened to have all of the ingredients, except for the broccoli, that is.  I used frozen peas instead.  Also, while browning the chicken I added a teaspoon of garlic.  Yummy!  I will definitely make this again!

This was excellent. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it tasted like great alfredo. I used the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and it was a healthy and tasty meal. I will definitely be making this again. It was easy and delicious!

This was very good for a 'lower' fat alfredo. I only made it 4 stars because it was too sticky with the parmesan cheese. I will try to add more milk next time but as far as taste goes, it was great. I used ww linguini and 2 out of 3 kids loved it. That means keeper in my house!

My family loves this recipe...its easy and delicious...I've been making it for several years.  I substitute Cream of Chicken soup instead of mushroom soup and fettucine for the pasta.  I even use 2 cups of leftover cooked chicken and it's still good.

Okay.  Could have used a little more pizzazz.  Also, it didn't remind me much of true alfredo.  It was more or less just a creamy noodle sauce.

I doubled the recipe and pretty much made it as is, except for a few alterations.  I added some Mrs. Dash seasoning and garlic salt to the cubed chicken, as well as some fresh sliced mushrooms.  It was really good, my whole family loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

This was really bland and I added garlic powder and onion powder to it. I thought it tasted a lot like cream of mushroom soup and nothing like alfredo. My 18 month old son did like it though, but I think I'll stick with the other Chicken Alfredo recipe that I have.

Very Simple! Very Delicious!  Followed the recipe with a few minor changes:  I omitted the butter and used a bit of olive oil, used garlic for added flavor, and used moz cheese, since I did not have parmesan.  It was a little sticky, but the taste was great!!!! Best part: it took about 15 min from stove to table!

This recipe is only alright. I was not thoroughly impressed. My family and I prefer traditional alfredo sauce.

Easy, fast, and good. Made as directed except I used an entire pound of frozen broccoli.  Would make again. UPDATE: Made again, used a lb of fresh broccoli, cream of chicken soup and added cheddar cheese at end instead of parm and we really liked it.

This recipe tasted great! Next time I will not use so many noodles. It was a bit dry. My husband loved it though.

This was a quick recipe and delicious.  I made it for my family and for a neighors family.  They thought it looked and tasted amazing and like I'd spent all day.  I will definently continue making this.  I also think the pepper added a nice flavor.  I followed the advice of a few others, I added 2 oz of cream cheese and cooked the chicken in olive oil and butter.  Yum!!

I made this exactly as called for. It was ok, but nothing special. I did like how simple it was, but if I make it again I will definitely add mushrooms, more cheese, and more seasoning to the chicken. It was just really bland. Throwing the broccoli in with the noodles was perfect though. I let them cook a little longer than 4 minutes but they still turned out nice and firm (I hate soggy broccoli).

I have a large family (often 6 adults, one of whom is eating for 2 :)), so I make "Something Alfredo" (chicken, turkey, ham steak, shrimp, scallops, etc.) and "Something Tetrazzini" pretty often. I saw this recipe and thought I would try it -- as written -- if only to see how it stacked up to my own. And it was good (which is why I gave it a 4). But it was good in the way, for instance, that my daughter, a new cook and soon to be new Mom would appreciate better than I. I printed this recipe for her. I'm going to keep making "mine" my way.

loved this recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used half and half instead of milk.  I also used two ounces of cream cheese, and added 1 can of cream of broccoli soup along with 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup.  other then that, it is a great starter recipe.

I didnt care much for this recipe. I didnt find the mushroom flavor very alfredo tasting. My husband really liked it which caused me to give it 3 stars. However, not my taste.

I used spaghetti pasta instead of linguine because that's the only pasta at home. I don't have cream cheese but it turned out good for our taste. I will try next time with cream cheese because my husband loves it.

Mushrooms are a big part of many Italian dishes. To those that rate their own versions, this recipe rocked just the way it is. The only thing I might try different next time is using cream of chicken soup, but somehow I don't think it will be as good.
