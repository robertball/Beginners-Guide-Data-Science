The curd was very runny and messy and the dough was very hard to cut, but the strong lemony taste was wonderful.  I used Meyer lemons which are somewhat strong but sweet.   I will make it again with a few adjustments before I give up on it.

The curd filling did not set up thick enough to hold so it was a very messy dessert (even though I cooked the curd for about 15 mins to thicken) .  I thought this may happen so wrapped the base up the sides of the pie dish but it was still a very messy dessert. Even wrapping the base up the sides I found the crust much too thick and very hard to cut through.
The curd filling was tasty but a little overpowering - however my lemons were very juicy ( I wish they would give measurements of juice not quantities as lemons vary).  
I probably wonâ€™t be making this recipe again but if I did
1: make the crust much thinner
2: use only 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice so it is not so overpowering and leaves a hint of coconut
3: add some coarse ground toasted coconut to the crust

Tastes really nice. Not too over the top and I like the little crunch with the meringue.
