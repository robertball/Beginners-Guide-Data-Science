I substituted coconut MILK for the water and skipped the mint. My banana was also frozen. VERY tasty.

Super delicious smoothie!! Refreshing, filling and pretty to look at, I followed the recipe as written except I omitted the mint...I've made it 2 times in the last two days, make sure your fruit is ripe and you won't need any sweetener and if you can use freshly squeezed orange juice and slightly frozen fruit even better! Thanks  for sharing your recipe Francine!

I'm sorry I didn't have the mango to put in this, as I'm sure that would have been delicious too. Will try that next time. I also skipped the mint, but may try it sometime out of curiosity. Added some flake coconut for a pretty garnish. This certainly tasted fruity tropical and different. I added a little sweetener as submitter suggested.

Delish! I didnâ€™t have pineapple so I doubled the mango which was frozen. I just realized that I actually have mint (not chocolate though), so I just might make another!

This was a very delicious recipe. I was short on oj, so I had to use a can of Trader Joe's pineapple juice.  All my fruit was frozen, so I had to use the Vitamix to get this blended up really good.  I added a little flax seed which I do to all of my smoothies for added health benefits.  We really enjoyed the combination and will enjoy again soon with the flaked coconut on top.  I will be picking that up at the store as I didn't have any for this round.

So, so good. I didn't have a mango, so I used a little extra pineapple. Still delicious.
