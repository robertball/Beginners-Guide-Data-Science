Your idea for adding the clams is a great one!  I wrote the recipe as a sort of starting point, but you can add whatever seafood you like.  We've added some clams (and their juice for added flavor) and mussels.

This was really very good, worthy of a fine restaurant type food..husband loved it, but would consider adding clams and such to it.  We will be making this again!

We really liked this, and found it to be a very nice, quick meal.  Kids age 10, 7 and 4 all loved it.  We all agreed that we would like it to have more sauce next time, so I will double that part.  My pasta drank up all of the sauce, but it was so delicious, I don't blame that pasta!  I made it as written, and didn't add the salt and pepper.  I know many people will leave out the anchovies, but that is really the key to the flavor of this dish.  I don't tell my kids about it until they are loving it!

I give the recipe 5 stars because the submitter said this was a starting point and I believe she is right.  The scallops I had to work with weren't the highest quality but that isn't her fault.  The dish lacked that punch of flavor I thought it would have.  I felt if I hadn't followed the recipe to a T but had thrown in some more wine, garlic.  That some more something my taste buds were waiting for, it would have been really good.  It is a great starting point though.

Once again, all recipes saved the day!  This was easy and delicious. My children even ate seconds and thirds. I will make again.

This was ok. It was pretty bland. We had to add a lot of salt and pepper at the table. Won't make this again.

This is a delicious dish.  However, when you make it, oh the anchovies really smelled strong.  But once you get passed that, your good to go.  Everyone in the family loved it.  (p.s. I love anchovies)

I thought it was really good.  I added a little extra onion and garlic and sauted them together w/ the anchovies.  I also added a little extra wine and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  My husband suggested adding a diced fresh tomato next time around.  Excellent base seafood recipe.  Will make again.

Tasted good but the flavor was a bit lacking. Added 1/4 cup of chicken stock

Made this yesterday and really enjoyed it. I am rating it for the sauce, which was delicious. I doubled the sauce in accordance with other reviewers. The reason I am not rating the recipe as a whole is because of two significant changes. To my sorrow, we don't have scallops where I live, so I substituted squid rounds, which worked out very well. I also used tortellini, which may sound odd, but I didn't have linguine. The squid rounds were not much bigger than the tortellini, so it actually worked out better than I was expecting.

It is delicate in taste so if you are looking for an extreme flavor profile you won't get it here. This is perfect for scallops as nothing overpowers the scallops. It was also very quick to make, that I appreciate always. I made as the recipe states but added another measurement of wine and garlic, skipped the salt and pepper. Also, if you are not used to cooking with white wine, whatever you choose will absolutely alter the flavor. Pick something that you like to drink.
