I could not convince the drinker of this cocktail that there was beer in it!   A few subbed Sprite for the beer, and that was OK....but most preferred the beer over the lemon lime soda.  I garnished with cherries....because...hello!  Marashino cherries!  Next time I might soak the cherries in the rum for a few days before serving this drink.  That would take it over the top!  Thanks!
