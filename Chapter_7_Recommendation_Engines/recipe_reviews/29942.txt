Here's what you can do to prevent sogginess:  slice YOUNG eggplant crosswise 3/8" thick, place on rack and salt both sides.  Allow to sit for several hours, then dab off excess moisture w/a paper towel.  Eggplant is just like a sponge so to prevent more sogginess VERY LIGHTLY brush on olive oil; broil on a rack until very nicely browned on both sides. Young eggplant skin is more tender, so you won't have to peel it. Use fruits that are about 2 1/2" at their widest part. I needed 2-3 to make four sandwiches. This gives a really meaty texture without sogginess OR being overdone. To sweeten the loud garlic, after dicing it, I cooked it in a bit of olive oil until soft (do not brown or it will turn bitter), then mashed it before adding to the mayo.

Mmmmm! I really liked this recipe. I did change a few things though. First of all, I would peel the eggplant. The skin on mine got a little tough after it was cooked, and slice the eggplant into 1/2-inch slices. When they're too thin, they do come out crispy! Instead of brushing with oil, I sprayed the slices with cooking spray and dusted with salt and pepper. I used light mayo and reduced the amount to cut calories. I added 1/4-1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves because I was short on time. It was delicious!

Truly the most delicious sandwich ever.  I cut the eggplant about 1/2" thick and grilled it on a charcoal grill, and I used Portuguese rolls.  My husband and I couldn't stop raving about them.  This sandwich now has a place of honor in my repetoire.

These are the worst! The eggplant was so soggy, it reminded me of guacamole. You should try instead to microwave the eggplant for about 1 1/2 minutes, or until the centers are cooked, then melt margarine in a large skillet over medium heat and fry them until lightly toasted on each side. That's how it's done in the eggplant burger recipe on this site that's fantastic! They come out perfectly. If the eggplant hadn't been ruined, this recipe might've been good.

I make this almost every week! One of the best veggie meals.  Even my carnivore of a husband said that he liked it!  OMG!  Thank you for such a great recipe!  A few changes:  Soak in basalmic first....just grill.  I use goat cheese instead of feta.

I thought this was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had!  I followed the recipe.  I did peel the eggplant and I think I would slice it thicker next time - but delicious!!

ooooh this did not turn out for me! It was so disaterous that we have decided to enjoy eggplant when ordered out from now on. But for those of you who have more kitchen success, I'd suggest reducing the broiling time a bit, my eggplant was a bit... excessively crispy :)

Delicious!  The only change we made was to grill the eggplant rather than broiling it.  We'll definately be making this again and again.

You have to know how to handle eggplant. I placed slices on a cookie sheet and salted both sides and let them sit for at least 30 minutes. Then I took highly absorbent papertowel(youll need alot) and I pressed the eggplant between the paper towel with my palms. I wouldnt recommend over pressing because It does shrink the size of the eggplant alot and I preffer a little juiciness. But if you want them really meaty press itall out. I just salt them and eat them as a snack. I even chopped some the next morning and added it to some acrambled eggs covered in Mozzerella. You can pretty much use eggplant in place of meat in anything. In the summer I cut it in strips lengthwise and brush w/olive oil and chaopped garlic and grill it as a side dish. The possibility's are endless just dont forget to do the salt and sweat first. Good Basic Recipe.

YUM! I thought I had reviewed this already...I've made it twice in 2 weeks and it's delicious! The first time we just did eggplant with the garlic mayo on french rolls and the second time added the tomato and basil. I'm not a feta fan so I left that out and I wouldn't think it needs it. I did salt the eggplant and let it sit for about 15 minutes to get out excess moisture. I cut the eggplant into about 1/2 " slices and I started them out on the top rack under the broiler for the first 5 minutes, then moved them to the next rack for the next 5 minutes. Turned out great, no mushy or soggy eggplant!

I prefer this without the basil, it's just a little too overpowering.  I've tried the eggplant many different ways (grilled, baked, peeled, etc) and the best way I've found is to lightly coat in flour and fry.  It gives the eggplant more of a crisp instead of staying like a soggy mess on the bun.  The flavors of this come together nicely and this is one of our favorite meatless meals.

Excellent! Easy to make and wonderful flavors. The garlic mayo really made everything sing. I recommend turning the eggplant slices once so each side is under the broiler for 5 minutes.

EXCELLENT! Everything in this sandwich comes together so nicely and the flavors are just amazing together. I sweated the eggplant for a half hour or so, then sprayed with olive oil cooking spray and broiled. I didn't want raw garlic in the mayo and didn't want to take the time to roast or saute it, so I just used garlic powder instead. Also, 1/4 cup of mayo for 2 sandwiches seemed a bit excessive... I did about half of that. Absolutely fabulous.. I might make this again tomorrow! Thanks :)

It was simple and delicious! I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried and added it to the spread. I also used normal sliced bread and mozzarella instead of feta and it was still delish! It doesn't involve much clean up or much time :)

My husband and I loved this sandwich!  The tips for preparing the eggplant were very helpful.  We peeled, sliced and salted the eggplant and let it sit for about an hour.  Then we rinsed and patted it dry before lightly brushing the olive oil onto the slices and broiling them.  I added creamy goat cheese instead of feta to mine and it was amazing!  Also, one comment suggested briefly sauteing the garlic before adding it to the mayo.  I tried this and it was a great flavor!  Can't wait to make this again...maybe with fresh mozzarella!

WOW!!! This is GREAT! The flavors all go so well together! I would give the a + 15 if I could! To the negative reviews on this recipe... I am having a great deal of trouble imagining how your eggplant slices came out to the consistency of guacamole. This sandwich could not be easier to make and it is delicious!

This is about the best sandwich ever!  I am making it again tonight for the 2nd time (would have made it more often except for the heat from the oven! - this is the 105+ forever summer).  The only thing I did different the 1st time was I took the advice of others and peeled and sweated.  I was reviewing the reviews again tonight as I don't have any fresh basil so I am going to try the suggestion of dried in the mayo.  Expect it to be FANTASTIC as before - but I do think the fresh is always the best option.

OMGGGGG BEST EVERRRRRRR!  I am eating healthy, so I took the advice of other reviews and peeled the eggplant, sprayed it with cooking oil and lightly sprinkled with salt and pepper. I baked them and used a little mayo with fresh garlic, dried basil (didn't have fresh basil), tomato, and reduced fat feta cheese all on a 100 calorie wheat bun. Forget the french roll...unnecessary calories.   HEALTHY and DELICIOUS! although, I will smell like garlic and basil for the next 2 days, but I dont care because It was amazing!

I used whole grain bread instead of a french roll, and didn't have fresh basil on hand.  Instead of the basil, I put a little bit of pesto sauce on one side of the bread, and mayo on the other.  I was a bit nervous after taking the eggplant out of the oven, as it smelled a little strange.  But WOW!  These tasted absolutely amazing.  I was very pleasantly surprised, and will absolutely be making these again soon.  :)

I used cooking spray instead of olive oil and after a few minutes when I checked the status of the broiling eggplant, it looked dry so I sprayed some italian dressing on each slice. I also just sprinkled garlic salt on the rolls spread with mayo instead of mixing it together so I wouldn't have any wasted garlic mayo sitting around! I will make this again and again. We didn't even miss the meat!

Wonderful!  With a garden producing eggplant faster than I can use it, I'm always looking for recipes.  This is a keeper.  To prevent sogginess, I sliced the eggplant, layed it on a paper towel, lightly salted, and topped with another towel.  This pulls out the excess moisture.  Thirty minutes later, I just rinsed and dried the slices, then proceeded with the recipe.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a bit of spaghetti sauce and served on regular toasted bread.  My husband and teenage son both raved about this meal.

This was great. Very important to sweat the eggplant first. I grilled mine on a george foreman, added grilled red peppers and alfalfa sprouts! This is my new go to veggie sandwich, thank!

These were really really good. Very close to the UCI sandwiches they were modeled after. Easy too. Definitely worth a try.

I loved this!  I breaded and baked my eggplant though b/c I thought I would like it better that way.  I cut the eggplant into 1/4 inch slices and dipped them in a mix of 1 egg mixed with 1 T milk then dipped them in a mix of 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs mixed with 2 T graded parmesan.  Then baked them for about 25 minutes at 375.

I tried this with the recommended microwave and cooking in the skillet with olive oil. It was pretty good, but a still little soggy. I mixed the vegan mayonnaise with garlic and let those flavors blend for half an hour before serving. My husband loved it. We had it with the garlic mayo, tomatoes, red onion and leaf lettuce.

Great healthy sandwiches. I used the Kraft olive oil mayo with cracked pepper and since I didn't have any basil, I omitted that. We also used whole wheat rolls and reduced fat feta.

Made this for my vegetarian son who was home for the weekend.  It was great!  Even I liked it and I'm not a big eggplant fan.  We used small hamb buns so did not cut the eggplant slices in half. Made the eggplant just as the recipe said and it turned out great.

Me and my 12 year old daughter are crazy about this sandwiche . For those people who said the eggplant didn't turn out good. The key like the recipe says is to broil or grill it. The best meatless sandwich ever. Thank you:)

These were great! My meat loving husband really enjoyed them and told me to make them again and even my 3 year old liked them. I did peel, thinly slice, and grill the egg plant. I also grilled the bread just a bit too. The only thing I will do differently next time is a tad less garlic in the mayo. I doubled the recipe and I guess my cloves were really big b/c it had quite a garilc bite to it. My kids liked them as I said earlier, but did ask to not make it so spicy next time.

These were really good, I just wish I would have cooked the eggplant longer.  I was paranoid from the reviews that said it got to crisp/chewy, and it ended up not being cooked enough, but the flavor is wonderful.  I will make these agiain, for sure.

These were delicious!  I made homemade Vienna rolls (Joy of Cooking -- these are the best!) and used reduced fat feta and couldn't tell the difference at all.  I didn't want to bother mixing the mayo and garlic in case I got too much mayo so I just spread a little minced garlic right on the sandwich.  Unfortunately a recent bout of hail all but destroyed my basil, so we skipped it.  I typically try to keep things healthy -- you know, replace oil with applesauce, white flour with home-ground whole wheat, etc. etc., but I am still a southern girl so I have an admission to make:  I fried my eggplant.  (After dipping in egg and then in flour).  This was ONE GOOD SANDWICH!  Sadly, it was only after the fact that I remembered that I actually have baked eggplant as an alternative to frying (Eggplant Parmesan) and it was still delicious, so next time I will bake this and see how it is.

A fast, yummy, easy vegetarian sandwich, works for me! I did a striped peel on the eggplant, then lowered my broiler rack because I think it would have burned within the 10 minutes. I served it with provolone on wheat bread, that's what was on hand.

This recipe is amazing! These also make good appetizers if you use bruschetta-size toast or slice up a sourdough or french baguette! The fresher the ingredients, the better. Good on ciabatta rolls, too. The sandwich is good for lunch or for a lighter, refreshing dinner.

This was a delicious way to use up some of the eggplant that piles up at this time of year. I peeled the eggplant and sliced it about 1/2" thick. I did not need to salt it. It dried out just fine under the broiler.

WOW!  This open-faced sandwich was fantatic.  The only "tweak" I made to the ingredients was to use smoked mozzarella instead of feta.  The smokiness of the mozzarella lent a great depth of flavor to this sandwich.  Also added a pinch of salt & pepper to the olive oil soaked bread and tomatoes.  This was such a healthy meal, perfect for a summer evening dining on the porch!  **5-22-12 Update:  Just as good as the first time we had these.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jamie!  It's fantastic!

I have been making this all summer long, and I don't even like Egg Plant but this is delecious.  The garlic and the mayo is a wonderful combination and lots of blue or feta cheese make this so delecious on a nice crispy Italian bread.

This was a very tasty sandwich, but next time I make it I am going to use a little less garlic.  Also, I might try to cook the eggplant differently, perhaps  frying it instead of cooking it under the broiler.  It was really easy and quick to make.

Quite possibly the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I made these so often after I first discovered the recipe that my family begged me to stop after serving it three times in one week.  The eggplant should be salted, rested, and pressed as previously noted. Absolutely saute the garlic before placing it in the Mayo and let them sit for a few hours in the fridge so the flavors meld. The garlic Mayo makes this recipe. The added feta cheese is perfect. I add some coarsely chopped romaine before serving and always serve on a dark bun. This sandwich is really worthy of your attention!!! Yes, it's that good.

mmm, for people who don't really like eggplant these sandwiches are amazing! my husband even likes them! everytime i mention this is for dinner, he's like "eww, thats gross", but when we eat them he's always amazed that he forgot how good they are! i follow recipe exactly except i just use whatever bread i have on hand, and whatever cheese i have and still comes out amazing. i also sweat the eggplant for 30 mins before starting recipe (sprinkle salt on sliced eggplant, let sit, wipe off sweat). thanks so much!

This was an awesome recipe. It was quick to make and I was able to feed three in short time. Everyone inhaled it. The flavors combine so well. I didn't have french rolls so we used deli rye and whole wheat bread. I also substituted blue cheese for the feta and it was delicious.

Yum!  I don't do mayo as a condiment, so I put the garlic and basil on the eggplant itself.  I liked it that way, but I think next time I'd do butter instead of mayo and put on the bread before toasting.  Despite the changes, I still thought this was a great way to use eggplant.  I loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is becoming a house favorite even for our two year old and four year old. It is quick and easy. Just remember to cut a few hours before and put salt and remove excess moisture before broiling. This last time I was short on ingredients. So instead I used equal parts of mayo, sour cream and plain yogurt. I than mixed it with garlic powder, dry basil, and dried mint. It was delish! It is a great way to cut some meat in our diet and we get so full!

Delicious! I used ciabatta rolls because it was what I had on hand. For the garlic mayo, I used the pre-minced garlic you can get at the grocery store, and just mixed some of it with mayo. This sandwich is so easy to make and absolutely delicious!

Super simple, and easy to make, but the flavors are so powerful! We loved it. if you really want to make it pop, you really should make the french bread yourself. I found an excellent recipe here on allrecipes.com.

Phenomenal. I subbed out the tomatoes for roasted red peppers and it was great. I was also out of fresh basil, but I'm not sure I missed it in the final product. Easy to prepare and big flavor.

Excellent.  We used artisan Kalimata olive bread. We didn't have the fresh basil so we used the dried and wished we had the fresh.

Fantastic! I didn't have feta or fresh basil; instead I just added some dried basil to the mayonnaise and garlic, and also sprinkled some basil along with some sea salt on the eggplant before broiling it. I also flipped the eggplant over halfway through. One of the best sandwiches I've had.

Great and quick sandwich. I was a little hesitant about using not cooked garlic with the mayo,but it tasted wonderful. Something a little different to break up the monotony of my usual recipes. Also, I cut my eggplant in about 1/2" slices since the recipe didn't specify, and that seemed to work well. The eggplant slices were done perfectly in 10 minutes. The only downside of this would  be the garlic breath afterward. Not a good first date meal :)

This recipe is a keeper for my family, the kids both scarfed theirs down before I finished making the other 2 for hubby and I!  All the flavors mix very well.  We are overrun with eggplant in the garden so I'm thrilled to find yet another fantastic way to serve it.

I opted out of the mayo and spread the bread with Italian dressing, garlic and black pepper -- seemed healthier! Also added chopped onions, because I love onions. A tasty sandwich! It was my first time cooking eggplant, and these directions worked well for my meal. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  Served them sliced at a party and everyone asked for the recipe. The sogginess comes from the mayo, especially when spread on hot buns.  Either eat 'em fast, or just enjoy the flavours! (no one seemed to mind them being a smidge soft)

This would be great assembled as an appetizer as well. Next time I am going to cut up the Eggplant, tomato and basil into pieces because it kind of just falls all out when you take a bite.

This doesn't make them better, just easier. I used my Presto electric tabletop grill. Drizzled olive oil, grilled eggplant while slicing bread which then went on the same grill to brown.   After the bread came off, added a touch more olive oil and cooked the pressed garlic on the grill.  Then spread that garlic/oil mixture out and put the bread over it, cut side down, to brown some more. Meanwhile, still grilling eggplant.  All got done at the same time, less to watch, less to clean. I did use half the mayo and guess what - turned the heat way down and kept the completed sandwiches warm as long as needed.  Great recipe!

These were divine!  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I'm trying to get more involved in vegetarian cooking, so this will be a favorite from now on!

Made these for lunch with my daughter---we both love eggplant.  Instead of the fresh minced garlic I added some garlic I had roasted to the mayo, added great flavor to the mayo.  Wonderful lunch---we both really loved this sandwich.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.

This is WONDERFUL. If you love eggplant - this is it. But the way I made it is not something you serve at a tea.  Lots of paper towels for drips and gooey fingers.  I love the garlic but think some might find it a little strong.  I didn't have fresh basil (howl!) so added dried to the mayo - not bad but fresh would have been better. I used romaine for the green crunch.  I used the olive oil to brush on the slices of eggplant which I made fairly thick. Grilled 10min turned oiled, 5min and then accidently burnt them slightly - takes only maybe another 2 min. max. But they were amazing. Messy but amazing.

Awesome!  It's also good with Zuchini.  We're not vegans but would prefer this over a cheeseburger.  A real bonus that it's more nutritive.

This was really good.  Even better due to the quick prep time.  I brushed eggplant w/ Italian Dressing, instead of olive oil.  When I was finished, I sprinkled Italian Spices on top of the feta (I left out the fresh basil).  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good, even with dried basil.  I also used flatbread instead of French rolls and sliced the eggplant into 1/2" slices.

Delicious! Great flavors that work perfectly together. It’s a nice light (but not too light), refreshing meal that’s great for warm weather. I recommend peeling the eggplant, otherwise it’s tough and papery when you eat it. I broiled the eggplant for 7-8 minutes so it wasn’t overdone. Also, I added slices of white onion.

Excellent, made as written, did peel it first. Gave it to my husband w/o telling him what it was and he liked it too, despite not liking eggplant. The flavored mayo was perfect with this.

This was absolutely, outrageously delicious!  As I always do before roasting or frying eggplant  slices, I salted them, placed them between paper towels and weighted them down for about an hour to get out all the extra liquid. The slices came out caramelized, sweet and creamy - no sogginess at all.  

The only thing I did differently was the basil - didn't have any fresh and my local store was out, so I added dried basil to the olive oil I brushed on the slices and some more to the mayonnaise garlic mixture-it worked quite well in a pinch.

I chose to slice my eggplant and grill it. I just sprayed the grill with Pam.  The oil on eggplant makes it mushy in my opinion. I grilled it with a light coat of salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also did the same to thick onion slices.  I used a brioche bun (what I had in the pantry) that I also grilled for a moment.  I added also a tiny drizzle of balsamic to my tomato slices and let them chill with that while grilling.  

I also made this with bacon... it’sa BELT!  Amazing with and without bacon.

I ended up making a slider version (french dinner rolls) of this and they are EXCELLENT! Thanks.   I followed the directions with the exception of the eggplant prep. I did use salt to remove more water from it. For the basil I mixed it in with the feta cheese  I also added sauteed baby bellas.

I love these sandwiches and have been making this recipe for about 10 years with 3 modifications. The modifications are to:  add lemon juice and chopped basil to the aoli and refrigerate for about 30 minutes; cheat and use Trader Joe's frozen grilled eggplant and zucchini; and add roasted red peppers (which makes it almost too big to eat).

I dipped the eggplant slices in a beaten egg and then in Italian bread crumbs.  I baked them @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes on one side and flipped them over and baked them another 15 minutes.  This made a delicious sandwich.  With the leftover slices, I slathered on the garlic mayo, topped it with a tomato slice, the Feta and chopped basil which made a pretty and tasty appetizer.

Deviations: dried basil stead of fresh, more mayo, added a minced up salmon filet to the mayo mixture

This was delicious! I didnt feel like going vegetarian, so I pan fried a small salmon filet, put some seafood seasoning on it, minced it, and mixed it into the mayo/garlic (it looked like tuna salad). That gave the sandwiches a little bit of... how should i call it, umami oomph. A bit of protein. 

Next time, I might try a touch of lemon juice in the mayo garlic, the California grilled veggie sandwiches recipe on allrecipes uses it, and it's delish.

These were the bomb! I lightly coated the eggplant with oil, broiled for 10 minutes on high and it turned out beautifully. Followed the recipe to a T. My boyfriend wants this to be a staple in the house now! Thank you for sharing!

I followed another reviewers recommendation and fried the egglant in a small amount of butter instead of using the oven. Im on an oil free diet so instead of the mayo I made a Mustard and Siracha mixture with the minced garlic = delicious! I put this, sauteed spinach, tomato and some melted brie cheese on dark rye toast.....unbelievably good.

Whole family loved this! I made a few tweaks though. Instead of French bread I used bakery whole wheat burger buns, I subbed feta cheese out for a provolone slice, and I did not use any basil, instead I put some lettuce on it. I heard how some eggplant turned out soggy, so I grilled it on my little grill instead. The mayo really made this dish, as did the tomato slice. Over all really good recipe.

It was great!  I made some minor changes.  As suggested by another user, I peeled the eggplant.   I sauteed sliced onion in olive oil then cooked eggplant in same oil in iron skillet.  I didn't have feta cheese so I used Parmesan melted under broiler after sandwich was assembled.   I didn't add any garlic to the mayo.   
I'll be making this often!

Loved the sandwich. after i cut the eggplant i put the slices in a colander and put salt on them to get all the water out. this helps prevent soggyness. also used a fat free greek yoghurt aoli recipe instead of the garlic mayo. came out great!
eggplant nice and crispy.

Served with French Bread Rolls to Die For, Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce, and Creamy Kale Salad. I took the advice of a reviewer and sweated the eggplant slices for a few hours. Not soggy at all. My mostly vegetarian daughter loved it!

The sogginess was a problem. I was hoping for meaty texture but ....I didn't have hours to let it sit with salt before cooking as one reviewer suggested. The garlic was too strong and my daughter didn't like it. I'm looking for vegetarian lunches for her.  Next time I'll try to spice up the eggplant because a bit of it without the other ingredients is blech.

Lovely recipe! SUPER easy as well! Instead of garlic mayo I made pesto mayo (50/50 mixture of pesto and mayo, a little heavy handed on the pesto) and nixed the basil leafs. Also nixed the French baguette for sour dough bread because that's what I had.

Last time I had eggplant I was seriously dissapointed so this time around I tried this recipe.  I am trying to eat a little cleaner, so I brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic.  Instead of the mayonaise mixture I used wheat bread and put a little dijon on it.  Followed the broil instructions, threw some tomato slices on it and it was a quick and easy sandwich that was yummy!

Super good and easy to make.  I added a touch of hot sauce to the garlic mayo. My husband loved it! I also added roasted red peppers and raw red onion to give it a little crunch. Will make this again.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. My husband had one and liked it too - despite telling me no when I asked him if he wanted one before I made it.  The feta really tops it off great.

Great use for eggplant and not the same ol' eggplant/mozzarella combo.  My husband's allergic to eggs, so I replaced the mayo with garlic butter, spread on the bread and then put under the grill right at the end.  For the tang of mayo, I used a little squeeze of lemon over the eggplant.  Will definitely make again!

I microwaved the eggplant for a couple of minutes and them cooked them on an indoor grill because I didn't want to warm up my oven on a hot summer day. My eggplant was not young so I peeled stripes off like I've seen on online videos ... did not salt ahead of time, but it was not bitter. Delicious - will be making this often.

Hubby and I thought it was ok but definitely not great.  Upside: healthy, got to use eggplant picked last night!  Downside: Mayo & veggies oozed out with every bite, very messy; basil overwhelmed other flavors. Guide on thickness of eggplant slices would be helpful.  20 min of broiling  was not enough--maybe that's due to using a  toaster oven.  One reviewer said she grilled; that might improve flavor.  In the broiler, it was so-so.

I love it! I was wanting a sandwich with eggplant and tomatoes, and here it is. I used cilantro mayo because I already had that made up. I loved the idea of the feta cheese, which surprisingly, I already had in the fridge! The best part was that it didn't take like a veggie sandwich. I also used a whole wheat pita, so this was extremely healthy! I'll be eating this often.

Yum!!  As I am the only one who will eat eggplant (they don't know when I slip it into other meals), I am always looking for something new for just me.  This sandwich was SO good!  I used goat cheese as my grocery store had a special on it, fresh basil and tomato from my garden.  I will be making this again tomorrow.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

My fiance wrinkled his nose when I told him what was for dinner, but he ended up loving this sandwich as much as I did! Very tasty!

This is fanastic! I didn't use olive oil to save calories. I heavily sprayed the eggplant with cooking spray and followed the rest of the recipe.  By the 3rd bite my husband was raving about how good the sandwich was. Quick!   Easy!  Good to eat!  What else could you want! 

I would suggest to use a hearty roll so that the sandwich hols together.

Excellent as is, but I do suggest adding salt and pepper to the the eggplant prior to cooking it.  Select eggplant that is shiny, firm, and on the smaller side.  That might help some of the people that commented about tough skin or mushy texture.

Oh My! This is amazing.  I salted the egg plant to drain like previous reviewers have done.  My only other addition was I drizzled the sandwich with Chardonnay Vinegar - to die for! Wonderful!  I've never been an eggplant user but look out farmers market - I'll be buying lots in the future.  Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent. The fresh basil is a must. I didn't have fresh eggplant so I substituted Trader Joe's frozen and breaded eggplant, which cooks in minutes. I can't wait to try it with fresh eggplant.

This was the first time I have ever had eggplant (I was an extremely picky eater growing up and my parents never exposed us to vegetables that didn't come in a can).  Now that I have a family of my own, I am discovering how wonderful all kinds of veggies can be. My husband and I LOVED this sandwich; it was so flavorful that I was convinced I couldn't taste the eggplant and had to try a plain piece to make sure I really liked it! I followed the recipe except  I salted the eggplant as was recommended by another reviewer and added garlic powder to the mayo since I didn't have any fresh on hand.  We will definitely be making these again!

Fantastic Sandwich. Found this recipe while needing to use up an eggplant before it spoiled. WOW, what a surprise. My husband doesn't normally "go" for things like this, he asked we make it again and thought it was filling. My suggestions: Instead of brushing on the olive oil, I have a spray bottle of EVOO, and it keeps it light. I didn't have basil leaves, but I mixed it Italian seasons, salt, and pepper into the mayo mix. Loved it! Thanks

This recipe tastes awesome!! The only change I made was adding some dried basil to the mayo due to the lack of fresh basil.

This recipe was way good! I loved it. I added spinach to it as well and toasted everything together in the oven after I cooked the eggplant. Will definitely be making it again. Oh yeah and I just put garlic salt instead of real garlic. Still superb.

This is a great sandwich. I grill the eggplant versus broil. Sometimes I add grilled red pepper. Either way, it is fantastic.

This was very yummy.  Fresh basil really added a lot of flavor.  The eggplant turned out very good on the grill...some of it got soggy, but I think I used too much oil on those ones.  Thanks for the vegetarian sandwich idea :)

This was delicious! Make sure you are a garlic lover, because the garlic is strong. I used raw onion slices instead of tomatoes on the sandwich. Very fast and easy.

i really like eggplant so i was searching for easy and different ways to prepare it.  this sandwich is both!  i used a baby eggplant and it made just enough for one big sandwich for me.  had to test it out -the garlic, the broiling, everything was so good. i used roma tomato, just bc they aren't so juicy.  made it for my mom for lunch and she loved it too!! just beware, the garlic in the mayo is raw and you will definitely notice it for a few hours (and so will all around you).  regardless, soooooo delish, thanks for sharing!

This was very good, in spite of the fact that I didn't have good bread to put it on.  The sauce was very tasty.

Excellent. Loved it. I ended up overeating because I liked these so much. Had no basil so added cilantro as I had those fresh.And yes, whole wheat toast made it more wholesome:).

Best thing I've had in a long time. I can't get enough. I even made ingredients without the bread the day after. Also used gorgonzola cheese or mozzarella since my husband doesn't care for feta. Without the bread I added red wine vinegar and olive oil in place of garlic mayo, and added roasted red pepper. Thanks for this recipe! The eggplant is delicious.
