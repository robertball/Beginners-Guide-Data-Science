Tried it for something different and it was definitely that, DIFFERENT. The Chinese 5 star has a strong anise taste. My husband didn't like it at all. Would rather use olive oil and garlic.

This was not my thing. The Chinese five spice did not accentuate the beans properly... it actual made them taste rather rank. I ate three beans total and threw the rest in the trash.

I actually used walnuts (that's all I had), and this turned out great.  Thanks!

Used EVOO instead of canola and very thin French green beans. Very easy to prepare. I liked that this was something different to do with green beans.

I didn't have the 5 Spice, so I used some Italian Seasoning istead, and that went really well. Very tasty :)

This is awesome! I ate the whole pound of green beans myself! This is a great dish for when you are staring South Beach Phase 1.

I made this the other night and I thought it was delicious.  I couldn't find the Chinese 5 spice, so I substituted it with a Szechuan spice that I found which made it a little spicy, delicious!
