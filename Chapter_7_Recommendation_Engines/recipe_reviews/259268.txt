These were good. Simple but good. Something in the tzatziki sauce made these cook a little different than what I am used to. They puff up big once dropped in the oil and never really brown in the center. Still good flavor though. Next time I might try just stuffing the wontons with chicken and feta and then using the tzatziki as a dipping sauce.
