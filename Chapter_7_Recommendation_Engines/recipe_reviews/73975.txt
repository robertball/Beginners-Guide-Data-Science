A big party favorite! My first attempt at hosting a party for a few vegan friends turned me on to the vegan diet. This dish was definately a hit! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

Very tasty! I used red beans and black beans to make it more of a side dish than a dip.

This was really really good! I had to make some changes, just because of what I had on hand: -Used a can of garbanzo beans -Half of a medium onion -Can of fiesta corn -Fresh lime juice  I didn't measure out the chili powder, but it probably came to about 1 TBS, and just used a tiny bit of salt and no pepper. Definitely drain the salsa! I bet it's way better with black beans, if it's possible.  Next time I make it I will use a third avocado though.

Always great! Let sit for a few hours or a day for better flavor. Full recipe makes a lot. Your chili powder determines how spicy, or add fresh jalape√±o. Lime juice is good too, a touch of agave or honey, or garlic. Remember to taste test with your chips, which have salt.

This was excellent.  It was nice to have something so fresh tasting.  I was slightly worried about the avocado turning brown, so I mixed everything else together at let it chill in the fridge for about 8 hours and added the avocado just prior to serving.  But, as I found out the next day, the avacado does stay green (must be the lemon and salsa).  Thanks for sharing!!

Oh my gosh - this stuff is amazing.  We simplied by using diced tomatoes with added oregano and garlic, feta, green onion, avocado, and it is ready to eat immediately - can't stop once we begin :)

Just made this recipe and didn't add the cilantro at first because my husband doesn't particularly like that spice but in the end the recipe really needed it.  We ended up adding an extra tablespoon of cilantro and my husband tossed in a bit of garlic.  This gave it a bit more flavour because we were finding it a little bland.  I really like it but my husband isn't crazy about it.

Made this recipe for the first time at Christmas and it was a hit! Will use less onion and more avocado next time. The onion was too overpowering and I LOVE avocado. :) Thanks for the new family recipe!

Oh my. So easy and delicious. I did follow other recommendations and only used 1 tbsp. chili powder. I also used chunky salsa which made the dip less watery. This is a keeper.

Fantastic! I always think I don't like Avacado. But I know it's good for me. This is a great way to get some in. Will go in regular rotation for me.

This was very good, I think next time I will use red onion instead since its a little milder.

Made this last night; exactly as the recipe says. Wasn't accepted as much as I would have liked.  I think I know what may have happened. I made it and immediately took it to the party. Having some leftover I put that in the fridge and just had it with chips. The flavor was decidely different.  Should I have put it in the fridge overnight?   Also, I have read the responses and believe that fresh salsa and a bit less chili powder should do the trick.  Overall, a great dip for us vegans and a potential hit at any party.  One other wonderment...think it's better with  chips or tortilla skins?  Thanks for the recipe; I'll let you all know how 'take 2' works out.

This dish was very tasty.  I made it for a dinner party last night and everyone enjoyed it.  Only change was I used a can of mexicorn and only used one tablespoon of chili powder.  I added some garlic and a dash of cumin.

I followed this recipe exactly the first time I made it, but thought the chili powder was a bit overwhelming.  Since then, I halve the chili powder and it's perfect.  I often use this dip as a filling for vegetarian tacos.

Substituted black eyed peas for black beans, used taco seasoning instead of Cajun, used diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of salsa and chopped a couple mint leaves in there.  This recipe is fantastic, best fresh salsa I've ever had!  This recipe would be equally good without my substitutions, but I used what I had, and don't like using pre-made salsa in recipes.

I had it using mexicorn, a can of rotel tomatoes, and about 2 cups of quinoa mixed in and it was delicious.

This dip is amazing!  I made it for a family gathering because I thought that my meat eating kin would enjoy it. Well, they devoured it.  I didn't tell them it was a vegan dish until the bowl was empty!  This is also great on salads and wrapped in a tortilla. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good. The salsa made it a bit runny. I will just use canned tomatoes next time. Great thing is you can customize to your taste. Made for extended family and they loved it

This was a big hit at a family party.  I used fresh corn cut off the cob, fresh tomatoes and onions instead of salsa, and added some chopped red bell pepper.  Really good and will be making often for the summer BBQ's.

Fantastic! We used pinto beans and added some diced tomato, and mixed it with some quinoa. Very refreshing summer side!

This recipe is awesome!!!!!!!!! One thing I do recommend is to only make enough for what you want that day.  A few days in the fridge and doesn't taste as good as it originally did.  Other than that 5 stars!

Nice salsa...not sure it is really a dip. My veggie ratio was a little off from the recipe but it is a good mixture of flavors and textures.  I ate it with blue corn chips like recommended and it was solid. Needs something though, for more of a kick.  Maybe a pepper or something.

I have made this recipe on over three occasions now, and every time the bowl is empty before you know it.  It is a great dip. Very fresh and flavorful. Do  make sure you have a "thicker" tortilla chip for dipping because the dip is quite substantial. Definitely give this one a try!

Really easy and delicious!  Somehow I had all the ingredients but the onion so I left that out along with the cilantro which I just don't like.  But it was great!  Probably could have used a 3rd avocado.  We ate it with chips and also used it to put in a burrito.  I'll definitely make it again!

As a sometimes struggling new vegan (8 weeks!)...this is just the mexican delight I was looking for.  I was always a fan of taco dip, seven layer dip, salsa con queso... That was a tough void to fill until now.  I love this recipe...and it's even yummier on day 2.  I left out the extra onion (my salsa was pretty onion-y) and used a lime instead of lemon.  Thanks for this yummy invention!

This is really really good. I omitted the onion and cilantro, because I don't care for either. I also used a smaller amount of chili powder, so my 3yo can eat it. 
Even my boyfriend, who rarely likes beans, thinks it's really good!
