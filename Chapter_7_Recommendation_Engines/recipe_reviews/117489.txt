There is one word for these cookies: FANTASTIC!
We traded a quart of maple syrup for a quart of sorghum mollasses and I needed a recipe to use.  This was THE one.  Everyone loved them.  Thank you for posting.

These were really soft and chewy--just like a Molasses cookie should be. I did add extra nutmeg and cinnamon to give them a little spicier flavor.

These cookies are among the easiest I have made, and more importantly, they are delicious with a perfect texture: chewy with a thin crisp sugar surface.  I thought they were a little saltier than necessary so next time I'm putting in 1 tsp instead of 1.5.

I gave this a 2 because I didn't get the same results as everyone else! I am a rather good cook, if I do say so myself lol. With that being said, I have never had a recipe I couldn't master on the 1st try! I was excited to try something with molasses as I have never cooked with it before. So, I mixed it up as the directions said and when I pulled the cookies out they were HUGE, flat, and extremely thin. If someone can message me on what went wrong PLEASE do! I honestly don't have a clue!!

These were very tasty right out of the oven!  Even the discriminating tastes of my 3 and 5 year olds enjoyed them!

Every year I make dozens and dozens of cookies for friends and family, this one has been a favorite of mine to make for the past few years and the stains on my card prove just how often I use it.  It adds a nice spice to the tray, and they look beautiful.

I just made these cookies for the first time, and what can I say...they are fabulous. Soft and chewy with just a hint of spice and molasses flavoring. I can't wait to share them with my family.

I used blackstrap molasses!!! I bought it at an Amish store. My grandfather said they were the best cookies he had ever ate in his life and he is 85 yrs old !!!
