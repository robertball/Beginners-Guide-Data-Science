This is wonderful. Since I don't like Cherries or anything flavored in Cherry. I used STrawberry instead. Will defiantely make again and again and my family loved it. If you don't love to back probably not the recipe for you as it does take a little time, but it was perfect for me!

SPLIT THIS IN TWO UNLESS YOU WANT TWO LARGE COFFEE CAKES!!  You wouldn't notice that unless you read the recipe first.  I don't think you'll need two big cakes (large plate size) at once.  A nice sweet-bread type coffee cake with a light glaze and a small stripe of cherry in each piece.  My husband really likes this.  It's not what I traditionally think of as coffee cake (more bumpy with sugary bits, and a square instead of a circle, I guess - lol), but that's what makes it special.  It looks a little fancier, I think.  I used Bonne Maman Preserves (Cherry) from France b/c that's what they had at our Vons, and it was good.

This looked and sounded like it should  be greeat; however, it turned out to be so bland that I kept going over the recipe to see if I missed something. Not something we'll try again.

I have reviewed the recipe to be sure that I didn't so something wrong and I really don't think I made a mistake, but who knows.  My husband and I thought it was VERY bland.

I made this late at night and tasted it right away--at that point it was fantastic; practically melted in my mouth.  However, by the next morning it already tasted stale to me.  I would definitely recommend the recipe if you are baking it right before you serve it; however if I hadn't tasted it until the next morning I wouldn't be making it again.  I substituted raspberry jam for the cherry preserves because that is what I had on hand, and omitted the almonds.  The glaze is a must--it adds some needed sweetness.

I added a little almond paste to the swirl and some almond extract after reading a few reviews that it was bland. Used black cherry jam.

If dough is bland add a small amount (1/4 tsp?) of almond extract to it and the powdered sugar glaze.  That should help!

My husband and I thought the coffee cake was bland as well.  Disappointed, it looked so good.

375 for baking was definetly too high.   I should have gone with my instinct and baked it at 355.

Overdone at 35 minutes.  Try 30.  Maybe even lower the oven temp.  Cherry preserves were good, but it might be better with cherry pie filling.  Not sure cake pans is the best form.  Try it as a braid?
