Made 2 batches of this today and they turned out perfectly!! I substituted baby cereal (the dry flaky kind) for the potato flakes....the baby cereal is better nutrition-wise so thought I would try it since it has the same consistency as instant potatoes. The kolaches turned out light and wonderful! The dough was beautiful, and very easy to work with, too. Served them to 24 people and they were asking for seconds!!! No problem w/my filling running out -- with kolaches you need to make a deep indentation, and do not fill them completely full. Used apricot preserves as the filling, and made a struesel topping to sprinkle over the preserves. I think I will start using this recipe instead of my old kolache one. Great recipe!!

SO GOOD! My husbands absolute favorite. Instead of buying the pie filling I made my own: 2 cups of frozen blueberries 1/4 cup white sugar 1/2 cup water 1-2 tbls cornstarch bring to a boil and simmer until thick.......YUM!

These are my first Kolache and they turned out just like my grandmas from Czech Republic. I made poppyseed and apple filling. Just before I put the filling on the dough I brushed the edge with some egg yolk and oil mix. That made them golden brown and still soft.

Update: I have made this recipe so many times as dinner rolls this summer. My family absolutely loves them. We call them 'kolache' dinner rolls because originally the recipe was for kolaches, LOL. My bread machine broke in July and I even made them by hand the other day. Original review: I was a little disappointed in the actual kolaches that I made with this recipe---the dough had a weird consistency and I found it very hard to work with. My family wasn't too impressed with the kolaches and I had leftover dough. I let it rise some more, then I made it into dinner rolls. Now, those were GREAT!!! Even my husband, who is not a bread eater, thought they were great. So 4 stars for the kolaches and 5 stars for the surprise dinner rolls! Thanks for the great idea!

Excellent - we add a sausage & cheese rather than a filling before the final rise and they are incredible.

This is a very good, simple recipe.  I made a batch Saturday and they were gone before I knew it and on Sunday I had requests to make a 2nd batch.  I followed the dough recipe exactly, but I did not use the fruit filling.  I wrapped the dough around cocktail sausages and cheese.  I found that sliced chz works better than grated.  It melts better is much easier to work with.  I wrapped a third of a chz slice around the suausge and then wraped dough around it.  Make sure that you seal the dough well so that the chz does not melt out.  I think next weekend I will make them with the fruit filling.

These are a family favorite.  I have made them MANY times.  The key to consistency is to weigh the bread flour (and use King Arthur).  By weight, use 1 pound 4 ounces of bread flour.  Also, I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup to match the sweetness of the traditional ones served in Texas.  Lastly, to make sure your fruit filling does not spill over, press firmly to bottom of baking pan when making your indentions.  By pressing the dough to the pan, it will prevent the middle from rising.  Also, make sure you make an indention about 1 inch in diameter (i.e., several thumb prints).

MMMM! I made these and the menfolk devoured them in a day and half.  Used 1/2 can of cherry filling for the whole batch as I didn't want as much filling in the pastry.  I used 2 T. cream cheese and 1 Tbsp. oil instead of extra egg yolk.  Delicious! Drizzled with icing. Thankyou!!!!!

I've never had kolaches before so I didn't really know what to expect.  The dough was really amazing and I had no trouble with the filling spilling out.  My family thought they tasted like un-fried doughnuts.

These were wonderful and so easy. I followed the bread recipe exactly and they were even better than the kolaches that we go to the donut store for. I'm looking forward to making them again soon.

These are absolutely wonderful, tender, light, & flavorful.  But I don't know how to get the filling to stay on the dough while baking.  The indentation made also rises up w/the rest of the dough & then it ran all over my cookie sheet & made a mess.  But they were still superb!

I made these this morning and my husband was CRAZY about them!  The dough is sticky, but keep a bowl of flour handy for dusting your hands and it's a breeze to work with!!

Having no canned filling, I made 3 "sweet" versions: lemon curd, homemade blackberry jam, and strawberry preserves.  I sprinkled a little Sugar In The Raw on before baking.  I also made some with sausage and cheese as suggested by another reviewer.  We loved them all!

This recipe makes a LOT of dough, so I also made some dinner rolls (again, as suggested by another reviewer).  These will now be taking the place of my homemade yeast rolls that I serve on holidays!  Warm with a little honey butter- YUMMY!

I will definitely make these again, but will try halving the recipe- hubby says he'll double in weight if I make many more full-sized batches!!  :-)

OH!  7/8 of a cup is 1 cup MINUS 2 tablespoons!!  Took forever to find a reliable conversion chart!

It doesn't make sense to go to the trouble of making a delicious dough like this only to fill it with preservative-laden, funky tasting canned pie filling. It's very simple to just make your own by cooking frozen cherries with sugar to taste, then stirring in some cornstarch and water until it thickens. Takes 10 minutes at the most and is well worth it.

My grandmother used to make kolaches all the time, but we never got the recipe from her before she died.  I think this is very close to the taste of hers.  Pretty easy to make.  Couple notes: 1) Once the filling is put on and you cover to let rise for 30 minutes, note that your cover will get some filling on it, so don't use anything fancy.  2) Do not overbake these since the bottom will brown faster.  My grandmother also didn't overbake because they aren't meant to be brown...just fully baked.  3) These freeze well and I only need about 15-20 seconds in the microwave on 80% power to thaw and eat.  4) I like using poppyseed and raspberry filling in mine.  :)

I actually got this recipe when it came out in a baking magazine... they were amazing! Used 1/4 cup potato flour instead of the instant potatoes.
For filling I used:
Apple filling:
2 apples
1Tbl sugar
2 Tbl water 
3/4 tsp cinnamon
Cook slowly over medium heat, stirring continuously until soft.

Cherry Filling
1 cup pitted cherries (I used ranier)
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
1 Tbl cornstarch

Cook in water for 10 minutes. Stir sugar and cornstarch together; add to cherries. Cook until thickened.

These were my first attempt at kolaches.  We just moved to Texas and my fiance loves them here.  Anyway I filled mine with jalapeno, sausage, and cheddar and some with blueberry preserves and cream cheese and rolled them into balls.  Delicious.  The recipe is wonderful and the dough was amazinly perfect and easy to work with.  Will make again many times.  Thanks!

Here is the filling recipe I used. A 16 oz bag of frozen mixed berries, 1/4 C of sugar, a squeeze of lemon, and zested half a lemon. Brought to a boil for 5 minutes, drained the berries with a slotted spoon, returned the juices to a boil and added 1 1/2 TBLS of cornstarch dissolved in 3 TBLS of water. I had something come up so mine slightly over-rose, but were delicious. Can't wait to make again with a cream cheese filling!

Not someone who enjoys baking however these Kolaches are amazing.  Follow the instructions exactly and resist the urge to add more water if needed beyond the 1 or 2 tablespoons. It will make the dough hard to handle. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  Only problem I had was the dough raised so well, it went over the sides of the pan. I have a 2lb machine, so I thought it should have been large enough. I took these to work, and my boss thought they were almost as good as the ones his Grandmother used to make. I made my own filling, cream cheese with Posypka on top.  Yummy!

I read all the reviews before trying this; maybe I did something wrong, but I found the dough too sticky and difficult to work with.  I almost threw it all out, but I persevered to the end, wrapping the sticky blobs around little sausages.  The end result did taste more like dinner rolls, even after upping the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Not sure if I'll try it again.

Very easy to make and real tastey if you add an icing of powdered sugar and milk after they cool. I found the bread not sweet enough without the icing.

I served this to some guests after dinner and they all seemed to like it- it turned out a little puffy but it did taste great! I had some freezer peach preserves in the freezer that I served with this and it went well together. Did not put powered sugar on it- I didnt think it needed it. Maybe next time though.

Made these for the first time, making them again less than 48 h later. I was pleasantly surprized at the soft texture od the dough. As good as fried donuts.

Delicious!  Weighed dough with scale per kolache, for consistency.  Used the bottom of a juice glass to flatten the dough, and then the back of a tablespoon for the impression (also consistency).  As one rater suggested, I filled with pure fruit preserves; this did not work as the filling ran out and over the finished product, and stuck to the pan (did not affect the deliciousness:).  Next time I will try pie filling.  Can't wait!

bread part wasn't as sweet as I expected but it was pillow-y goodness. I used homemade strawberry jam on half and cream cheese filling in the other. Kids loved them as did the DH.

I made these pretty much as is, except I used all cherry pie filling and used some of my sons rice cereal for the potato flakes as a few other reviewers mentioned. I've never had a kolache before so I didn't know what to expect and I don't have anything to compare them too, but they looked/sounded delicious and the taste was okay but I don't think id make these again. I don't think they were worth the time and effort that went into making them and I think they would be better with jam or a thicker fruit filling rather than canned pie filling. Thanks anyways though. *EDIT* I just have to say that my husband loved these so maybe I'm just not a kolache person!

This was a great find! We had guests for dinner, and I used this recipe to make both bread rolls (as suggested by pp) and kolaches...drizzled a confectioner's sugar icing over the kolaches, which were filled with a mixed berry compote. The kolaches tasted great even when I overbaked them! (oops) :) My kids devoured them. Very versatile dough, great flavor, and very easy to make!

I made 2 batches of these this weekend and they turned out awesome!  Just like my grandma used to make.  I used poppyseed, cherry and apricot filling.  They were so good, I had to hurry and stick them in the freezer so the hubby wouldn't eat them all!  The only thing different i did was use regular milk instead of the powdered milk since I didn't have any.

Yummy. Used 1/2 cup milk and 3/4 cup warm water and no dry milk.  Used baby cereal instead of potato flakes.  1 large can cherry pie filling was exactly enough.

Wonderful!  I'm so glad to have found a traditional recipe that I can make in my bread machine (I don't have the time my grandmother did to do it all by hand!).  I made homemade poppyseed filling and they were to die for - just like Grandma's!

This a good in a pinch, don't have time recipe.  Actually makes too small of a batch and I ran the dough through twice to get it as soft as we like them.  Overall good helpful recipe.  Still do them by had mostly.

These were delicious!  I made pumpkin and lemon and both were soo good. I rolled them into the size ball in the recipe, and it make 42!  Next time I will put some colored sugar on the edges to give a little sweetness.

I have made these numerous times and they turn out perfect every time. I add a tablespoon more sugar than listed. I make my own cherry filling using tart cherries or I use apricot filling made from rehydrated dried apricots mixed with some sugar.  I also top them with a mixture of flour, sugar and butter called Posypka.  I live in Texas and that is what they use in the Czech bakeries around here.  Very yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly. Definately needs to have the salt adjusted and the texture of the dough just didnt match the kolaches from the bakeries. Guess I'll keep looking

These take longer than you expect but are very good. Bake on a shiny baking sheet to avoid over brown bottoms on dark metal. I made both cherry kolaches and sausage ones and plan to freeze half of each for weekdays.

These are great! The bread was not as soft as I was hoping it would be, but they were still delicious. Next time I will try proofing the yeast first. I used blueberry preserves, a cherry-blueberry fruit spread, and sweet orange marmalade because those were all I had on hand. I don't normally care for marmalade but those ended up being my favorite ones! Next time I will make some with sausage and cheese. Yum! =)

These are so easy and ridiculously good.  Only change I made was to add an extra 2 Tbsp of sugar and a tad more water to the dough.  Filled with homemade Apple Pie filling and drizzled with Vanilla Glaze (from  this site).  These will be made often!

yum! Super easy to handle dough, no problem with filling spillage and absolutly delish! I split half savory filled with a bacon/egg/cheese mixture, then the other half of dough I made a strawberry jam/creaam cheese mixture. YUM! Taste like "unfried" doughnuts, like other reviewer stated.

This is truely and wonderful recipe, I have starting making Kolaches from my husbands grandma's recipe and of course with a pinch of this and dab of that was never able to make it just like her's.  But this was wonderful, my family loves it.  I am sending one home to my husbands grandma to try which is 3 hours from home.  Grandma cant wait to try it.

Wow!! This recipe is perfect as is. I used a cream cheese filling that I found on this site also and my family gobbled them up. I had to make a second batch same day and so easy when using a bread machine!

These were more of a thick bread with filling on top, although the bread was good. They aren't like the kolaches I am used to buying here in WI. I subbed the mashed potato flakes with baby cereal because that was all I had. I won't use this recipe again.

I made these last weekend. I used apple pie filing as that was all I had. My family loved them, I couldn't keep them from eating it. Mine "puffed" up a lot. It seemed to me though to be a nice dinner roll with some type of fruit topping.  I will make again and flatten the dough more, maybe even wrap the dough around the filing. Thanks for sharing!!!

mine turned out heavy, but may not be the fault of the recipe, so many thing could have caused it, but it was disappointing nonetheless, and fairly bland.

I made these today and they turned out just wonderful! I used only one can of cherry pie filling (two cherries per roll)and am happy to have the second can for another batch. Thank you for this recipe!

My best friend is a Houston native and she introduced these to me when we visited there. These taste just like the best of what we tried there. I made two batches, the first was the sweet variety, the second was the meat kind (klobasnek). Both batches turned out amazing. 

I used 1/3 cup sugar both times, and did not have to add extra water. The dough came out perfectly. The first batch made 52 of the fruit kind, they were about 3 inches in diameter. Next time I'm going to try to make them a little bigger. I was able to make 24 of the meat version.

I ended up taking the first batch out early because they cooked so quickly. They were already brown. Each time after I watched a little closer, these pastries should be a barely golden color not brown.

Between the Superbowl & my family, they were gone in 3 days.

I was pleasantly surprised!  Instead of the water and dry milk, I used the same amount of scalded milk.  The dough had a bit of the yeast - dough  taste though.  I would add the lemon extract next time. Over all it was quick-er & easier to make than the usual way.  I live in an old house and have a heck of a time getting dough to rise. Making dough without the machine is such a drag.

These are simply devine! This was my very first time to make kolaches. I wanted the homemade kind just like my grandmother used to make. They didn’t turn out as pretty as hers but they had that same great taste. It is hard to do the toppings where they don’t spill over the top. I find it best to use thicker pie fillings. Next time, I may try to make my own toppings, especially poppyseed. I followed the directions exactly and I wouldn’t change a thing!  Thank you for the yummy recipe!

I added another ¼ to ½ cup of flour while the dough was mixing.  The dough was absolutely silky after the first rise.  I turned the dough out onto a lightly greased  mat and cut into one ounce portions, rolled into balls and let rise.  After filling they went right into the oven without another rise. I used cherry pie filling and apricot pastry filling.  They were so good I ate three immediately!  I ended up drizzling with an almond flavored glaze instead of brushing with butter. For Christmas I plan to make them in half ounce portions for a cookie platter. Absolutely wonderful recipe!

I have never made Kolaches so I followed the recipe as close as possible. The only change I made was to use apple pie filling for the center. They've only been out of the oven for 15 minutes and my family is already asking me to make them again. they came out perfect and taste amazing. they're sweet enough for a desert or simple enough for a quick breakfast on the go.

These are delicious!  Make you’re own toppings, why spend all the time hand-crafting these rolls and then dump canned pie filling on them?
I used the tip for added sugar to make the bun sweeter, next time  I’ll make the ball a little bigger and use an ice cream scoop coated in sugar to make the indentation for the toppings.  I couldn’t fit more than a level teaspoon in my thumb-sized dent!
My batch made 58 rolls!!  But they freeze beautifully, so we’ve got Sunday morning Kolaches for months!

My husband said"why haven't you made this before" as he was eating the second one. I said I don't know,I have been cooking for 50 years and never saw the recipe before.Wonderful soft dough.And I only left out dry milk and just used a tad more potato flakes.  Use whatever filling you want.

They turned out great. I used whole milk (3/4 cup) instead of powdered milk and cut water down to 3/4 cup.

Followed the recipe exactly. Although I am a skeptic regarding bread machines, it made the nicest dough imaginable!  Did not change a thing.  Made half cherry  pie filling, half poppyseed.  Biggest problem was what to do with them all! (On vacation, I loaded a plate and passed them out to the other guests!)  Just a clarification I found a bit unclear:  remove the dough fr om the bread machine once the mix cycle is complete.  Don't let it rise in the machine.

I have made this recipe for my family of eight many times. I never use the dry milk listed in the recipe; instead substitute 1/3 cup 2% milk and subtract 1/3 cup water from what is called for in the ingredient  list.  My family likes these with cherry pie filling and powdered sugar glaze.

The hubs2be is from TX and really misses kolaches and klobasneks (sausage kolaches) so I had the day off and made these for breakfast tomorrow.  We each had one as a snack while dinner was cooking though.  The thumbprint indents were done and filled right before they went into the oven and I didn't have any spillover but I did have to dip my thumb in flour before I put each imprint in the dough and other than the dough being REALLY sticky and still managing to stick to the oiled pan the end product was great.  We filled ours with blackberry preserves, strawberry preserves and cream cheese filling.  When I have the time I will be making these again.

We really enjoyed these little kolaches. We're from Calgary so had to modify ever so slightly by decreasing the flour by 1/8 cup (to 3 3/4c) and I always use instant yeast now so upped the yeast to 1 tbsp.  As per other suggestions, we gave it an egg wash before filling with cherry pie filling, then after baking we added a drizzle of almond-flavoured icing and topped them with toasted almonds. Very tasty.  You could very easily add a 1/2t of plain cream cheese to the bottom as the icing and pie fillings are both very sweet and the tanginess of unsweetened cream cheese would balance the flavours very well. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I have made this recipe so many times and it always turns out terrific! I've had these often in Texas and my husband has Czech grandparents, so I wanted to learn to make them when we moved away. This is the only recipe I use! I often use my homemade jam instead of the solo filling. Any kind of fruit filling or jam works great. I brush the kolaches with melted butter before filling them, then again after baking them, it helps them keep longer. Make sure you only let them rise a little the second time, or the filling might run off and they will get too puffy. 15-20 minutes is enough time, just while the oven is heating. I usually get at least 30-36 kolaches from this recipe.
You can use this dough to make sausage rolls, too. Use the little sausages, or Polish/Czech/German sausage that have been cut in small pieces. Wrap the dough completely around the sausage and let it rise until doubled, then bake. So, only one more rising of the dough for them. Depending on the size of the sausage, you can get at least 3 dozen sausage rolls from this recipe. Brush them with butter and store leftovers in the refrigerator. 
I've actually made a pan of fruit kolaches and a pan if sausage kolaches from this single recipe many times! Thanks Amysue1!

These were easy to make. I made a spicy prune-raisin filling and put on a glaze instead of using the fillings and buttering the finished buns.  Loved by those who like sweet breakfast treats!
