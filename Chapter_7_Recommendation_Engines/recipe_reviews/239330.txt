Delicious!  I added chorizo sausage and Monterey Jack cheese in the burrito.  Also dolloped with sour cream instead of goat cheese.  These are great to make large batches and freezing after rolling the burrito.  Heat in microwave and then add toppings.

I made it according to recipe, but scaled it down to two.  The burritos were OK, but didn't have any real personality since there was no meat (bacon, sausage or chorizo).  This time(2nd) I added bacon.  It was very good, but still lacking in pizazz.  I will try again adding green pepper.  Eventually we will get this one right.  I love the Hash Browns and the goat cheese.

I made a few changes - added bite size pieces of steak and bacon, put them in the oven after rolling for about 15 minutes for a warmer center and crispier tortillas. Still, very good and plenty of room for options on what you want on your burrito!

I have made many breakfast burritos, but I never thought to put goat cheese in them. Yum!  I used 6 eggs and green chilie along with the hash browns  and cheese. Very good.
