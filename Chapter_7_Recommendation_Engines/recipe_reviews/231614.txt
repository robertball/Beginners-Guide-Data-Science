I decided to make this for lunch as I had some goat cheese sitting around, and I am very glad that I did. I made the recipe the same, with the only change being that I used whole wheat bread instead of sourdough, which I didn't have. I imagine sourdough would be great too. What a nice lunch, I had this sandwich with a fresh fruit salad and I will definately make this again. I will deliberately buy goat cheese just for this. Soooooo good.

Two cups of goat cheese is way too much for four sandwiches, one bunch of dill is also way too much and overpowering. They were messy, and all you could taste was dill. This might be better with a quarter bunch of dill and half the cheese.

Fabulous! I was looking for a light lunch today, and I found this to be extremely refreshing! The flavors blend together very well, and it's unique compared to the usual sandwich fare. I had to change a few things based on what I had on hand. I used honey whole wheat, which was good, but I'm betting sour dough would've been a knockout. I used a regular onion rather than a shallot, and I had to use dried dill instead of fresh. I scaled down the recipe using only about 3/4 of a log of goat cheese and 1.5 tsp of dried dill, if anyone is curious. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I made these for a baby shower along with other sandwiches.  Everyone raved about the cucumber sandwiches.

This was awesome! The only thing is that it made about double what would fit on 4 sandwiches (So not complaining though) and I only used about 2/3 of the goat cheese called for (because it was sold in 11 oz packages at the store). 

Making this easier: Throw it all in the food processor.

I replaced the goat cheese for  cream cheese and used some regular white and wheat bread. I was a hit at a church tea event.

Everyone loved them!! I did shortcut the recipe though by using herb goat cheese with a little less oil to make it spreadable. But the recipe is very easy.

I really enjoyed these! I liked the use of goat cheese, rather than the cream cheese and/or mayo I've seen in other recipes. I cut the recipe way down and just made one sandwich for lunch, and I would definitely make this again. The only change I made was to omit the shallot, because I didn't have any on hand. Great for a light lunch, or as an appetizer.
