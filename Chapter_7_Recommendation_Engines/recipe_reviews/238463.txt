I must admit, I fully intended to "add some flavor" to this after preparing according to the recipe.  However, I was pleasantly surprised as it is delightful just as is!  Our grocery store didn't have spinach/ricotta tortellini, so I used a four cheese tortellini instead.  We also don't care for olives, so I omitted them, but I can certainly see how they'd make this even better (if you like olives ;) ).  I didn't measure the EVOO, just a drizzled a bit (and I'm sure I used well less than 1/2 C).  Like the submitter says in the tagline, TRY IT as written first, then adjust if you feel it needs it (and I'm a tweaker from way back, but I'm glad I listened to the tagline plea for this one).  THANKS for the recipe!

I  used the Wishbone Robusto Salad dressing that someone else suggested and wasn't thrilled with the results.  I left out the olives and used slivers of Asiago cheese instead of the Parmesan. Overall I enjoyed the salad but will use a different dressing next time.  Maybe add some roasted peppers also.
