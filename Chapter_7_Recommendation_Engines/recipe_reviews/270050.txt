Made it, loved it!  I used super thick pork chops (1 1/4 in. thick) so i put them in the oven to finish.  They were delicious.  I used  a little less chili powder because we are wimps.  Easy and yummy!

With thin cut chops, there is more surface area, so I used 1 tsp seasoned salt and 1/4 cup lime juice and doubled all the other spices. I put the spices and chops in a bag and shook them up to cover. I also subbed Padilla chili for the chili powder and I added about a half tsp cayenne. Terrific!

These were real good, quick and easy to make. The lime garlic sauce really brightened the meat nicely, turning a boring chop into a very tasty dish. The only thing I might do different is use a bit more chili powder for a just a little more pop!

These turned out great! I am picky about my chops and the ones I had were thick so I chose to grill them and just finish with the butter and lime. This rub would go great with chicken too.
