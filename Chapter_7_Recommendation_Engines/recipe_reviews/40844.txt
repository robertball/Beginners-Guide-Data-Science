We tried this on NY strips for something different and it was just OK.  It was pretty good.  I think it would actually work well on grilled potatoes.

I used this rub when I made beer can chicken. It worked well; simple, but delicious. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried.

Great rub! And your right Bob...it was particularly good on grilled rib-eyes.  ;o) Hubby made this for my Mother's Day dinner...he served  bruschetta, watermelon margaritas, grilled rib eyes w/ this great rub, grilled asparagus spears & s'mores by the firepit...it was a fabulous dinner w/out much effort!

This was very tasty. I used it on Ribeyes and my husband and son really enjoyed it. I ground the rosemary with a mortar and pestle to more evenly distribute the rosemary flavor. This worked very well to get the rosemary flavor into every bite. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe.

This rub didn't add much flavor to our steaks.  The recipe did not specify if you need to let the steaks steep in the herbs and spices, so we rubbed and grilled right away.  Maybe letting everything meld for a while would work better for us?

Easy and tastes great.  It will make your average store bought rib eye taste like you bought prime.

This is an Awesome rub.  The best seasoning for steak that I've ever had and it gets the attention of the taste buds as soon as you bite into the steak.  I did add dry chopped onions and grind all of the herbs prior to coating the steaks, then let the steaks sit for a couple of hours before putting them on the grill.  I was really Impressed, Thanks.

It was delicious. The blend of flavors were really good. I'm pretty sensitive to spicy but this was alright on the heat. It is definitely a keeper.

Fabulous! We almost didn't make it based on other reviews but I'm glad we did. We are generally very picky but this was outstanding. Simple and elegant flavor. Tasted like a steak from a fine restaurant. We used ribeye steaks and added a little extra salt just before grilling. I would highly recommend this for someone with a refined palate. (The only exception would be perhaps if someone doesn't like rosemary but I would think this would appeal to most people.)

I loved how simple this is.  The only difference I did was use fresh rosemary and garlic because that's what I had.  I used it on center pork chops and grilled them.  YUMMY

Yummy! We had this tonight on Rib-eyes as suggested and it worked out perfect. The rub was just enough to add a little flavor without taking away from the steak. We'll definetly be using this again!
