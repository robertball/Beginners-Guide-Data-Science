I thought this was pretty good - I always like trying new sauces and this was a change from the usual. You will get 12 servings (at 3/4 cup per serving) or 9 (1 cup) servings. I track my food, so I had to portion this out, which is how I got these amounts.   Secondly, this really is quite sweet. I halved the brown sugar (only change I made) and it was still plenty sweet for me, so you might want to start with a smaller amount.  I served this over zucchini noodles.  The mustard and celery salt really add some depth of flavor. Thanks for sharing grandma's recipe!
