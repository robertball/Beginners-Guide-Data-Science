This was a great tasting dish! However, I think it tasted better before I added all of the parmesan (even though I am a HUGE cheese fan). Next time, I'll try it with half the cheese. It seemed to dry it up and make it too salty. Other than that, it was great!!

This was delicious. I had never prepared chanterelles before, but they were in my organic delivery box, so I looked for recipes.  I only made half the amount stated, because there are only two of us, and because my chanterelles were less than two cups. But there was nothing left and we could have eaten more of this wonderfully creamy, yet al dente risotto.  You could use more chanterelles than stated here, or even add other mushrooms, I’m sure that would be very yummy. Also make sure you don’t use that hideous Parmesan powder stuff, it will ruin the experience, so who ever uses that should not give a bad review. ;)  I also put some freshly shredded Italian parsley on my portion. My man doesn’t like it much, but I think it tastes great.

This is a seabass with a butternut squash sauce (very easy recipe) atop the chanterelle risotto.  All the different flavors came together and complimented each other.  This will definitely be made again and again.

Yummy! Great base but I added a lot. I used chicken broth and needed 2 more cups of broth to fully cook the rice. I added thyme, and used 1 cup sliced baby bellas. To replicate our favorite risotto from a French diner, I added about a 1/2 cup corn right at the end, and about a quarter cup chopped walnuts! Topped with a little truffle oil...bon appetit!

It clearly says to stir the mushroom mixture into the rice then add the cheese and cook for another minute.  Plus I think that is obvious that you would mix the two together in the end.  Next time you should read a little more carefully before being so critical.

I used shiitake intead and it turned out perfect.  A lot of muscle work went into making it but the it was well worth the reward.  I think I only used about half the parmagiano reggiano.

Okay, so you've got a pan of sauteed mushrooms and a pan of cooked Arborio rice, then what?  Instructions seem to be missing something.

This recipe was delicious, and it is hearty enough to reheat leftovers for lunch the next day. If you are a cheese fan, this is right up your alley. The only change I would suggest would be to cook the mushrooms closer to when the rice is done cooking, as they dried out a little bit by the time I was ready to add them. Other than that, this was a huge crowd pleaser.

My favorite risotto is made with a dry white wine reduction, but it's easy enough to add to this recipe.  This looks like a wonderful recipe, Christine.  Thanks for sharing and I've saved it to my recipe box.

I add this review in case anyone else is using this recipe (like I did) for the first time making Risotto.  IT MUST BE ARBORIO RICE!   I realize that for an experienced cook, this is like, "duh," but I had never done this before and used Basmati.  After doing a bit more research I realized that Basmati will never work because there's not enough starch.  When I made the recipe again with Aborio, it was excellent - even without mushrooms or parm.  Thanks!

I have never had risotto before and was not 100% what the coutcome was to be. I followed the recipe with the exceptions of deleting the mushrooms and used dryed parmesan cheese(I used half of what was required for fresh cheese). This was good and I know would have been even better with fresh cheese. I beleive I could have cooked it a min. more.

Wow, this is delicious.  Chanterlle mushrooms, garlic, butter, makes for a scrumptious, luxurious risotto.  Kings should eat so well.

Excellent, as is! Also great with some additions: I recommend doubling the mushrooms. I also added onions when sautéing the mushrooms and garlic, cooking until onions were nearly caramelized and mushrooms were slightly browned. If you don't have arborio rice you can use sushi rice (do not rinse!) This came out great. Next time I will add asparagus and maybe some shredded chicken. Thanks!

Holy yum! I measured nothing, using what was likely more mushrooms and less rice. I sautéed the mushrooms in my cast iron dutch oven until they were nicely browned with some salt and pepper, adding the garlic in the last minute; then I scooped the mushrooms out and proceeded to make the risotto. I probably used 6 cups of chicken broth to get it to the perfect consistency. Also, I only used a wee bit of parmesan. Then I plated the risotto, sprinkling the mushroom over the top so their flavor wouldn't be diluted. Super yummy.

This was ok and the family ate it, but afterwards my husband asked me not to make it again.  I found I had to add a lot more stock than the recipe called for before my rice was cooked through, and I'm guessing the extra stock also made it salty.  I didn't add any salt to it either.  If I do make this again, I think I will switch to the reduced sodium chicken stock (unfortunately my supermarket doesn't stock low sodium vegetable stock) and also use some wine and/or water rather than all stock.  I did like the general taste of the risotto with the mushrooms and cheese (though I did cut this back quite a bit due to the already saltiness of the rice), so I haven't given up on this recipe.  Will have to experiment when the hubby isn't home.

Sorry but my family just did not like this.  We did not think there was a lot of flavor involved and the rice was to mushy per our taste.  Will keep looking.

Only substitution was using white mushrooms (since that was all I had) - tasted great; very creamy and delicious, with a strong flavor of garlic (which i enjoy).  Will definitely make again.

On a suggestion of someone else, I halvedthe cheese to one cup - but even that seemed to be too much and really changed the consistency of how risotto should be - made it pretty sticky. Next time, I'll try maybe just a qtr cup or even less. Plus, I added an extra cup of mushrooms, which seemed to make for a better ratio to the rice in the end than just 2 cups would have. It's tasty, just not as "risotto-like" as I would've wanted...

Delicious. I made this with about half the amount of chanterelles and subbed in some cubed butternut squash. So good.

Excellent! Used vegetarian 'better than bouillon' no chicken base, and almost twice the chanterelles. Ended up using about 1 additional cup broth: just kept adding and cooking until done.
