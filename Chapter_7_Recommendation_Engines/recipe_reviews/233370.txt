My review is for the glaze on the ham alone because I smoked my ham in a smoker instead of baking in the oven. With that being said, this glaze is excellent! I do think it could have used a little bit more mustard but that is the only change I'd make next time. Neither me or my husband like pineapple so this was a great way to get that fuity flavor that pairs nicely with ham. Again, I smoked my ham because that is how we prefer it but if weather does not allow I will most definitely make this in the oven as the recipe instructs. The "bark" this glaze made on the ham was amazing!

My family loved it! I will make this again. My son is not allowed to have pineapple due to anti-rejection medication and this was the prefect recipe to replace the typical pineapple and ham recipe.
