Wow!  These were so good and perfect for after dinner on a hot summer night.  Very refreshing and a very nice treat - I used low fat yogurt and as if you could make them any better, I topped the glasses off with a bit of whipped cream and a frozen strawberry on the side!

No mistaking that this is a berry smoothie!  Rich, creamy and smooth with full berry flavor.  Other than using cherry juice rather than  cranberry, I made no other substitutions or additions. I did make an unintended omission, however - I forgot to add the sugar but Hubs said it was just fine without.  And HIS review? - "This is exactly what a smoothie should be."

this was very tart....it twisted my face up!  But it was much better with a banana pureed into it.

Yum! I threw in one chunked frozen banana and I did not need the sugar. This was so good!

We skipped the rasberries and froze the yogurt and cran-apple(instead of just cranberry)and it was the best smoothie I've ever home made. oh and we used guava fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt.

Oh Yum! This is really, really good! We used fresh strawberries and raspberries and added a little ice. Also used 2 teaspoons of sugar. So refreshing and addicting, I couldn't put mine down. I will make sure to keep the ingredients on hand to enjoy this often. Thanks for sharing!!

Followed it to the tee (well, ok...I didn't use frozen strawberries, but rather: fresh... so I added a little bit of ice).  I generally do NOT like anything to drink with yogurt in it, but this was AWESOME!!  I didn't find it too tart at ALL, but would guess that more sugar could be added if someone thought it to be.  This rates right up there with the Strawberry Limeade by dancerathlete.  This has A PERFECT blend of ingredients so that you can actually taste each one without having any overpowering each other.

Very good smoothie.  I don't keep cranberry juice around, so I subbed orange but kept everything else the same.  I loved the flavor of the raspberries coming through.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Only change was to use vanilla yogurt instead of strawberry because it was all I had left in the fridge.  Kids loved it.  Put fresh whipped cream and a little cranberry sauce on the top.  I stirred my toppings into the smoothie and it was so good.

This was so refreshing! I used crystal light fruit punch instead of the cranberry juice and it gave it a really nice fruitiness to the the drink, aside from the strawberries and raspberries. I like this shake a lot!

Yum!  Have made this with vanilla and strawberry and strawberry banana yogurt.  I did sub Stevia for the sugar.  Very refreshing!  We did add some ice cubes to lighten up a bit.  Will be enjoying this all summer!
