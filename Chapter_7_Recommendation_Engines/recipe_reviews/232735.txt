These are really good if you like a really puffy batter, which we do.  Make sure that your oil is at at least 350 and do these in batches.  They hold well in a low oven while you finish the rest.  I knocked these down one star because they really need to be dusted with flour prior to going into the batter, so the batter will stick and the batter needs a little more seasoning - maybe a little cayenne.  I sliced the onions and let soak in cold water as directed, in a salad spinner - drained and spun dry, which worked great.   Very nice recipe that I would use again and again with just a few simple changes.  Thanks Elle.

Excellent!   I did end up using 2 large yellow onions instead of Bermudas, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.   I did find that the recipe barely was enough for my 2 onions using 1/2 inch slices, but perhaps that was because of the size of them.   I did use a deep fat fryer rather than a pan on the stove.  On the first batch I used the wire basket that came with my fryer.   Big mistake.   The batter oozed through the basket and made a large onion clump that wouldn't come out.    After that, I made small batches directly in the fryer and they came out perfect.

Great onion rings.  Exactly the style I was looking for!  As recommended, I dusted the onions with floor before the batter and it coated them perfectly.  The batter is a little bland but I’m cooking for kids and spicy doesn’t fly so I dusted mine with Cajun seasoning after cooking.  I will be making this again.

Loved it. Followed suggestions about using salad spinner to remove water, flour to dredge before batter and OldBay in the batter. Next time will season it even more. Also to get more onion taste, plan to keep onion thicker by not separating the rings as much.  Simple recipe to follow. Thanks!

I love onion rings and these did not disappoint. I dusted the rings with flour first as one viewer suggested, and used lactose free milk with some lemon juice in it to make buttermilk. I also put them through the lettuce spinner as was suggested.
These are excellent, thank you Ellie_NO!

The batter was good but too thick... I found it was better if I added a little extra buttermilk and cut the onions a little thicker... I prefer more onion to batter.

I have been trying to make fried onion rings but always failed. I found this recipe and tried exactly as the recipe and it was a huge success. My kids love them and goes nicely with baked chicken. I would love to make them again and maybe have some burger to go with it. Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted great. I made the mistake of trying to deep fry  them on the stove top and the batter got pretty mushy. Next time I will break out the deep fryer. I will definitely be making these again!

These come out light, puffy and golden.  You can add some extra seasoning of your choice to give them an extra kick if you'd like.  super yum!

Were good.  Based on the reviews here I added a pinch of baking soda and a bit of beer and the result was very good.

Delicious! A girl could really lose her figure with these onion rings. They turned out perfect and I would make them again should the occasion rise. (maybe I will make them tomorrow-LOL!)

They were tasty but not crunchy. The batter was more soft and puffy than crispy crunchy. Not sure why. My oil was the correct temp. I made it exactly according to recipe.

Added a little extra buttermilk and salt to the batter but that was just to soot my personal preference. Excellent recipe and onion rings stayed crisp and perfect after being fried.. in a low heat  oven for 20 minutes while I finished dinner

Delicious recipe.  I dredged the onions thru flour before dipping in batter.  Yummy
