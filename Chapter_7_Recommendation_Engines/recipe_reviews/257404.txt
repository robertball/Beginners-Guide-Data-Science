made for Thanksgiving 2018 and everyone wants a repeat for Christmas.  Made as called for.  ONLY thing was used fresh berries and 16oz.  Loved the jalapeno "kicker" made sure I tasted the heat of the jalapeno's and added some seeds/membrane to get the heat  (taste them before you use them so you can adjust  the heat for you/guests taste) we like.
