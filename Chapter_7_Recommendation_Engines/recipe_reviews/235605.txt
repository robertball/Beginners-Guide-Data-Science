I am not a fan of ribs - BBQ sauce and Ketchup? Yuck - but my husband likes to request them for special events. This is the fifth slow-cooker rib recipe I've tried, and my favorite so far. I couldn't find the Pace Picante sauce (and I don't know what flavour that's supposed to be...?) so I replaced it with an Indian cooking paste: Cumin and chili (so I didn't need to add the red pepper flakes on top of that - Yay for lazy cooking!). I also added a large can of peach slices, just for appearances' sake. These ribs were full of subtle, mature flavours and very, very good. I was getting phone calls days later asking for the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!
