All the people who said it was too soggy or too strong in the bourbon department should really get a clue! Seriously! use your common sense. If it looks a little soggy or you're having second thoughts about the alcohol, don't just brush it off and go on! Don't always trust the recipe completely. Always use your brain and test the recipe before a gathering! Thank you.

This is our new family favorite for Thanksgiving.  We did decrease the chicken stock down to about 2 cups of liquid from the original amount it called for.  Also the recipe is missing the part where you add the bacon back into the mix.  But we just tossed it in there when we were doing the mixing of all of the ingredients.  The flavors are excellent and we even used a little extra burbon in our gravy.

Awesome Awesome Recipe! Tested it out and am making it for Thanksgiving Supper, as for the comments stating too much liquid, THANK you for stating in the directions to add liquid to desired consistancy! That means one can play around to get the consistancy they prefer. I am going to try this time adding some peeled cut apples to this, and tip:If you aren't a drinker, as I am not, omit the Bourbon!! Thanks so much.

This was amazing stuffing!  Everyone loved it and I gave the recipe to three family members.  I don't know how the previous reviewer's turned out soggy.  I added the wet ingredients until it was "stuffing-like", I didn't add it all at once and I didn't use it all.  I did add more sage because I like a very sage-y flavour, but otherwise it was perfect.  This will be my recipe for years to come!

This was a good stuffing. The bourbon is noticeable but not too overbearing.  As for the conversation about sogginess: I agree that it pays to use commonsense when using a new recipe, but there was twice as much liquid as I needed in this recipe!

We only had white bread, so that's what I used.  Also, definitely follow the advice of other reviewers in regards to adding the liquid.  You do not need that much, and you need to add it only until it soaks into the bread.  Then stop adding!  I made a quarter of the recipe since we don't need 2 9x13 pans of stuffing, and I used 1 cup of chicken stock instead of 2.  I think bf would've liked this more without the bourbon--and I only added a a tablespoon or so of it.  Other than that, this was a nice stuffing.  I'd prefer the darker breads the recipe called for, but we have way too much bread right now for me to get something different.  Thanks for the recipe!

This stuffing is AWESOME. I live abroad and we made this for our "orphan American" Thanksgiving celebration and it was an enormous, heartwarming hit. I agree with everyone else that there is way too much liquid in the recipe but it's nothing you can't solve by just monitoring it as you mix as well as during the baking process. I ended up "feeding" the stuffing a little bourbon and stock as it baked so it didn't dry out. It was amazing. Thumbs way up.

The Best!! Tried this out last Thanksgiving and it was so popular, two 13X9s disappeared at work and two at home!  I've now made this recipe several times and will be breaking it out again for this Thanksgiving, it's becoming my signature dish--its the dark breads that really bring out the flavor.  I would be careful with the chicken stock, though, add as needed.

This recipe turned out to be some of the best stuffing I've ever had.  The fact that it's home made from scratch makes it even better.  In regards to the broth/bourbon, I only mixed together 1 Qt of broth and 1/2 cup bourbon and didn't use all of it and it turned out perfect.  I also didn't add back ALL of the bacon grease.  Delicious and highly recommend!

I made this for a thanksgiving potluck my friends and i (all students) had. It went over VERY well. I only used 4 cups of chicken stock for the full recipe, but I doubled the bacon, and made one pan turkey bacon one pan regular bacon as some of my friends are kosher. I fed the chicken stock into the stuffing as it was baking, and only mixed a little in with the bourbon. You do NOT want a full cup of bourbon. I could have definitely put more bourbon in, but I wanted less vs more. Overall it went very very well, and since my boyfriend didn't like rye bread I used italian bread and pumpernickel and it was great. GREAT RECIPE

Sorry I had high hopes for this stuffing but I used a less amount of chicken stock and it was mush when it came out.

I made 'half' a recipe.  No way do the cubes need a quart of stock.  I already put the bourbon in the bowl in anticipation of adding the quart or more of chicken stock.  Big mistake.  It was a bourbon overload.  Ruined everything.

This recipe has WAY TOO MUCH BOURBON in it!  I brought this to a party and it was the joke of the night; everyone laughed that we should do "stuffing shots!"   I initially was worried because the mixture was extremely soupy.  I even left out about 1/2 quart of chicken broth because it already had too much liquid.  Looking back, I should have cut the bourbon as well...probably a reason why it was too alcoholic.  However, after cooking through the stuffing was a great consistency.  Too bad the bourbon completely overshadowed all the other flavors and made the dish unbearable to take down.

I liked this but it isn't something I'd make again without a few tweaks. Others at the table liked it. To start off with, let me say I do not like bland stuffing and usually go for one with meat, fruit and/or nuts in it so this recipe appealed to me. If I made it again, I'd use sausage instead of bacon because the bacon flavor wasn't strong enough.  The sage was strong and I'd reduce that by 1TB. Lastly, I used too much chicken stock.  I went with 4 cups instead of leading up to 4 cups.  My fault. It was too moist.  Not a big deal as I just cooked it longer but I will go with 3 cups next time. I also didn't taste the bourbon.  The dominant flavor was sage and rye. That is fine, of course, but the rye and bourbon were what called out to me as unique so, just a heads up there.

For the review written about stuffing...Stuffing is prepared in the bird. If its prepared separately its called DRESSING.

I LOVE bourbon, bacon, and rye bread so this was perfect.  If you don't like one of those things, then don't even try this!  The flavors actually go really well together, and nothing overpowers anything else.

This was different. good, but different. One thing though, too much liquid. The rye was a little overbaring and i didn't taste the bacon at all.

The bourbon amount is a bit much unless you like heavy bourbon taste. I would put in 1/2 a cup next time.
