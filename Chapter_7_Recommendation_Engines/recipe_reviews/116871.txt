A good start, but authentic guac is never this pasty.  Skip processor and mash with a couple of forks....add a tablespoon each of chopped cilantro and sweet onion,

Very good-but I did change the recipe a little bit.  We prefer chunkier guacamole, so I finely minced the garlic with the salt, finely minced the onion and mashed it with the avacado and a couple squirts of lime juice.

Very good! I mashed with a fork, rather than using the food processor.  Added a small squeeze of lemon juice.  Will be making this often!  Thanks for sharing this recipe! I have been making this quite a bit lately and have been adding fresh lime juice.  This doubles and triples very well!  Fool proof!  VERY GOOD!

I have just tried this recipe. Very easy and so tasty. I added a dash of lime as per other reviews, and a dash of tabasco to give it a little bit of kick. Will do it again for sure. Thanks for the recipe. By the way, if you put the stone from the avocado in the dip it will keep it from turning brown! I've tried it and it works.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I added a little lime juice and salt though because I needed the extra kick.  I would use this again.

This is a quick, easy and quite tasty guacamole recipe. These are the changes I made: I add the juice of half a lime (use a teaspoon of lime juice if you like), I use garlic seasoning instead of a clove of garlic (makes it easier), about a tablespoon or so of chopped onion, and a little cilantro. I don't go to the trouble of chopping cilantro - I just buy the little tube in the produce section and add about a teaspoon. I also make it without the cilantro and it is still quite tasty. Since I like my guacamole a little chunky, I just use a fork or potato masher to chop up the avocados.

I'm not sure this took even 5 minutes! I juse used a fork to mash the avocado because I like mine a little chunkier. I used this in steak fajitas so it worked perfectly!

Very good base recipe, sorry ahead for all my changes; I added lime juice and 2T sour cream, garlic powder instead of whole cloves, probably doubled the salsa since I mixed some right in and poured a little on top for presentation!  Mashed with a fork; no need to bring out the big mixer!...  :)

Quick, easy and delicious. I love the tablespoon of salsa--it made it look like professional guac!  I mashed the avocado with a fork rather than using a food processor it it was great. I will definitely make this again.

I will never buy another packet of guac mix!  What a great recipe...I did add more salsa than called for and also added a dollop of sour cream and 1/4 cup of diced tomatoes.  Delicious!

Found this recipe when people were already over and was thanking my lucky stars that I had all the ingredients on hand.  For how few ingredients there are, this recipe turns out amazing.

Fantastic guac! I like it smooth and simple and this was perfect. The only change I made was adding some lime juice. This will be my go-to guac recipe from now on! Thanks!!! Tip: if you add a dollop of sour cream into the mix, it keeps it from going brown.

Love the ease of making it spicy or not by using different salsas. I don't like spicy food but my husband does. Each batch is small enough I can make two or just mix hotter salsa in his half.

This recipe delivers what it promises -- uber-quick guac -- which is nice when you don't have all the ingredients you need to make the real deal.  I also skipped the food processor.

The recipe as is wasn't salty enough for me. I added a dash or two of basalmic vinaigrette to add a salty taste. Adding salt, alone, made the guac very dry.

Great! Only change is to add a squirt of lemon juice and mash with a fork instead of the food processor (we like it chunky and I hate washing dishes).

Fabulous recipe! I wanted a quick snack and didn't feel like taking the time to make a traditional guacamole recipe, and this was perfect! I used a fork to mash the avacado so it would be chunkier. I also doubled the amount of salsa. (The type/quality of the salsa you choose will make a difference, so use a good chunky salsa with lots of tomato pieces, Green Mountain Gringo is especially good.) I took another short cut and used 1/4 tsp. garlic salt in place of regular salt, then I was able to omit the garlic clove. Tasted great and I was able to whip this up in no time! Thanks for this super quick recipe....it's a keeper!!!

This is a great recipe for when you don't have time or don't feel like making guacamole from scratch. As suggested by other reviewers, I used a fork instead of a food processor (I like my guacamole chunky too). Quite nice!

The first time I made this, it was AMAZING. The next couple times...not so much. No idea where I went wrong; I double-checked and I seem to have followed the recipe exactly each time. Tempted to try one more time because the first batch was so good!

I'm a cooking novice - this guacamole was so easy to make and very tasty.  I read the reviews and used a ripe avocado - no need to use the food processor.  Great flavor.  Thanks for sharing

It was a last minute decision to make guacamole, and the one ingredient I needed was lemon juice; which to my surprise, I didn't have! Since I was out of time, I clicked on the first recipe I saw, and gave it a shot. My husband was so pleased that he said the plate I made was restaurant quality! Thank you for such a simple recipe!

Avocado is a very delicate fruit and when it is ripe you don't need to use a food processor.  It will make the product unattractive.  When I make this I just mash the avocado and then add fresh salsa and crushed garlic, stir gently.  It is very pretty and more appetizing.  Give a squeeze of fresh lime to prevent browning and add more taste.  I live in CA so take my word for it.  Smile!

great and easy. I added more powdered sugar & graham crackers to it, I probably didnt need to but when I poured it in pan it seemed to runny. I also used reeses choc/peanut butter chips to melt for the topping. It is good my family will love it tonight.

YUM!  After reading other reviews and also being a huge fan of "chunky" guacamole - I just mashed the ingredients with a fork (after mincing the garlic of course).  I definitely recommend doubling/tripling this recipe!!  So good and sooo easy!

This guacamole is killer and incredibly easy.  I used 2 medium avocados, 2T pace picante sauce, 1/4 t (heaped) salt, then mashed with fork.  I nixed the garlic (only because I don't have a food processor).

No need to measure this out.  I use 2 avocados, mashed with a fork, 2 cloves of pressed garlic, way more salsa than this recipe calls for, salt and about a tablespoon of lime juice.  Quick, easy and yummy!

It's quick but needs to much doctoring to get the flavor right.  It's missing lime juice and cilantro.

This was good. I used minced garlic instead and just used a fork to mash the avocado and mix this together. I forgot to add the salt, but no one noticed. This was good, but not our favorite recipe. It is a really easy one to remember though.

My 17 yr old son used this as a guide but instead of salsa he used pico de gallo and also some fresh lime juice.  It is GREAT and even made a second batch to share with one of my best friends who LOVES guacamole but is a fast food junkie.  She called before I made it back home from delivering it to tell him how tasty it is.

Yum! I made a few changes - instead of adding salsa, I used a small chopped tomato. Like other reviewers, I mashed the avocado with a fork, and I added cilantro and green onion. I also added lime juice to preserve this for a little longer. Good base recipe to begin with - thanks!

Really quite good, but I have to admit I didn't add the salsa. Perhaps if I want that type of zest to guac next time I will use it. This is a perfect recipe for first-time guac makers like me. :)

One of those recipes where simple is best.  This brings out the flavor of the avocado nicely, without being overly complex.  Tastes great on tacos or with chips.

I also mashed with fork - very easy to do and cleanup was a breeze.  I followed recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS!  My salsa was a 'store bought fresh' one and it had cilantro in it.  Thanks

I use a tablespoon of red onion chopped fine, fresh lemon juice, fine chop on sliced pickled jalapeno peppers, about 6-8 of them. Sour cream, about a tablespoon, salt and pepper to taste and toss well. I leave it a little on the chunky side.

good and so quick! I prefer the quac. chunkier too so like others I mashed it by hand with a potato masher.  I also added lemon juice, onion powder, black pepper and a touch of hot sauce. Can't beat it for a quick healthy dip!

My husband made this tonight after we discovered we despise raw avocado (which I'd bought for another recipe). So he whipped this right up, mashing the sliced avocado with the other ingredients right into a bowl, using a fork. It's not as smooth and pretty as the picture, but hey, that's life right? I believe we used more salsa than this recipe calls for as the guacamole wound up being a rather disturbing shade of reddish-green. Thanks for the recipe, it really was just a 5 minute job :)

This is very good, however, it is too thick due to the lack of lemon juice. Add a little lemon (about 1 T.) and it would be great. I also like to add about 1 T. chopped onion. Love using the salsa though, so many recipes have too much tomato.

This was good. I mashed it with a fork instead of the food processor. I will make again but I will still try different ones for variety.

Nice and simple recipe.  I used fresh homemade salsa and added some lemon juice (would have done lime if I had it on hand). Also, used a fork to mash instead of a processor. Chunkier guac is nice for dipping, and the smooth guac is good as a spread!

Being that your guests may just breeze on by, its easier to have ready, in your fridge, some fresh minced garlic.  And, I didn't have the food processor down from the cabinet, so I mashed the avocado w/a potato masher, then, w/the curved side of a spoon against my mixing bowl.  I added a spray of fresh lime juice by using a half of a lime, and just squeezing it in, then mixing more and then adding a little more, all so that the consistency was right.  My guest LOVED it!

Pretty good guac for such a quick recipe. Unlike other reviewers, I like a smooth guac. I did add a little lime juice but made no other changes and I couldn't stop eating it. I think the salsa is what made it so good.

Had a pregnancy craving for some guacamole but no interest/intention of going out and getting some!  When I remembered I had an advocado, I hopped online to see if someone had an easy recipe and here it was!  This was perfect for as easy as it was!  I didn't puree it, but mashed it with a fork.  I didn't use a garlic clove (mostly because I didn't feel like mincing it), but substituted some garlic powder.  The only thing that was missing was a splash of lime juice!

So, I won't touch the stuff, but I made it for my friend's Super Bowl party. This is the first time I have ever tried, but I don't think it will be the last.

This is SO easy to make. From the folks that know how this stuff should taste: just add about 1/4 of a lime's worth of juice. I had cilantro on hand, but chose not to add it sheerly for the fact that I didn't know how much is too much. Good recipe from what I'm told. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and tasty.  I did not use the food processor for this as I agree that chunky is better in the case of guacamole.  The salsa was a nice touch although this recipe is not complete.  It needed a bit of lime juice and definitely some fresh cilantro.  Not a bad starter recipe though.

Nice recipe even though I'm not a fan of the creamy guacamole. I just used a fork to mash up the avocado, mixing it with finely chopped sweet onions and a clove of garlic, and about spoonful-and-a-half of Pace HOT salsa. My girlfriend claims she's never going to make her version again!

This was my first attempt at homemade guacamole. I will never do store bought again! I doubled this recipe except did 1 1/2 tsp. of salt (should have been 2 tsp. per double recipe). I think 1 tsp. would have been fine. I also added the juice of 1 lemon. I did not use a food processor, just my potato masher. Perfect consistency! This was awesome! I didn't have a drop left over. I will be making this again!

Very good base, here, but gotta go with Luv2cook on this.  Cilantro is a must for me, 'specially with lime/lemon juice.  For the salsa, I often switch it up with one of the many versions of Salsa Verde on the market (believe it or not Pace makes a great one) coupled with fresh tomatoes.  Very aesthetic for me.  Because It's in the blood, I like to throw in some green chile, too- but NOT the canned stuff for those of you without southwestern access.  Thanks for sharing!

Any guac is good and definitely use the fork method ONLY but, after living in SoCal for 30 years and multiple trips to Mexico I would invest a couple more minutes by adding a bit of lemon or lime, diced red onions and tomatoes, cilantro and maybe some diced bell pepper and, of course, salt 'n pepper.  Optional, diced jalepano's, hot sauce/red pepper, cumin, sour cream, get creative, mis amigo's!  ;-)

Definitely needed either a citrus juice or vinegar in it. I liked the simplicity.

Yum!  I also added a squeeze of lemon, for a little extra flavor.  No need to use the processor - just mash it all up with a fork and you're good to go!

This is an excellent guacamole.  I mashed the avocado with a fork, added the other ingredients and then I squeezed an eighth of a lime into the guacamole.  A friend who joined us for dinner said that he liked the green stuff.

When made with a good quality salsa, it tastes just like something you'd get at a fancy restaurant.
