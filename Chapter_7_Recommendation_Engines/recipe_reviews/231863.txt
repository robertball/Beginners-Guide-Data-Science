Not your traditional enchiladas but delicious nonetheless. Used 5, 10" flour tortillas rather than the smaller ones, and they fit perfectly in the 9" x 13" baking dish. One 10" enchilada is filling so this dish should serve 5 adult appetites. Made “Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce” from this site in lieu of using the recipe’s jar Alfredo sauce. Next time, I would go with an authentic Alfredo sauce that doesn't use cream cheese even if it takes a little more time (e.g., “Buttery Alfredo Sauce” from this site).

I used Garlic Alfredo sauce, skipped the mushrooms and added a can of artichoke hearts instead. I used corn tortillas and did not heat them in advance. I only used Monterrey Jack cheese. My family loved it and had no idea there was cottage cheese in the recipe. If they knew, they would have said they wouldn't eat it. A hit!

OMIT THE SALT. But overall Great recipe! I halved it and put it in an 8x8 and it was great. Cheese is salty enough and jarred Alfredo is salty too.

The flavor was wonderful although I made my own Alfredo sauce and added pesto. The enchiladas were a bit too soft and runny. Next time I will add some rice and shredded chicken

Great recipe using stuff you probably have in the pantry - we used frozen spinach & added zucchini instead of mushrooms, mexican shredded cheese blend, corn instead of flour tortillas, and added more garlic and cilantro - thanks for the recipe!

This is a very tasty meal, but I would omit the salt the next time.  My error was overdoing the alfredo sauce.

Hahaha, now I get to be one of those AllRecipes reviewers who makes the recipe, but changes it .  I basically added more spices, since it looked pretty bland.  I doubled the pepper, and added 1/4 tsp each of cumin and chili powder, and a sprinkles of red pepper flakes. I added the spices before the spinach.  I also used less alfredo sauce, but also poured salsa on the top as well.  It was good.  A bit soupy. I think more mushrooms would be good. ALSO, use frozen spinach-- cleaning and nipping the stems off 1.5 lbs of spinach was a big pain.

I cut this in half for our family and used "lite Alfredo sauce" less salt, and also used corn tortillas.  I added some deli chicken, it was very good. Thanks.

I loved this recipe!!! Hell everybody loved this recipe even my extremely picky Grandma and Mother loved it!!! I did add my shredded lime chicken, fresh clinatro and extra cheese. This is the first recipe that I've stuck close to the bones ever and everyone fought over who got the left overs. Definitely worth a try!!! Thank you for sharing!!!

Delicious! We will definitely have this again.  Based on what I had on hand and health preferences, I used frozen kale, non fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream, low fat cottage cheese and reduced the amount of shredded cheeses.  Even with these changes, it was good. My husband that doesn't like kale thought it was very good.
