Very easy, make ahead and tasty too!  This is one of those recipes where you can customize it to suit your taste - add onions or other meats & veggies if you want.  I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012.  Thanks for a good recipe to eat and photograph.

Wonderful basic  recipe, I increased it to serve 12, added green onion, green and red peppers chopped, and  some chopped tomato for color and extra taste---got all rave remarks.  Would be good with any meat or veggie additions. It baked in the time alloted, and I added 15 minutes "rest time" before slicing into servings.  LOOKED as  good as it tasted, another star:)

Not a bad egg and sausage casserole however I wish I had put some veggies like onion, garlic, and maybe spinach to give it more variety. I would also recommend using breakfast sausage with herb seasoning for better flavor. 
Also, if using a deep glass baking dish adjust cooking time accordingly. I added 30 more minutes. I might use a 7x11 next time.

This is a good casserole! I have made it twice. The first time I refrigerated it overnight before cooking. The second time, I let the egg, cheese, and milk mixture set while I fried the sausage. Then I added the sausage after I cooked it and popped it in the oven. Both ways turned out fine.

It was easy and delicious. I even cheated - I made it in the morning so it didn't get the night of soaking.  We still enjoyed it and cooked up great.

Great recipe! I've used this one for years. We messed up one year and bought maple sausage instead of plain and have been using maple since!

I added pieces of bread to cover the bottom of dish which soaked up the milk mixture. This added volume to the casserole.

I was really disappointed by this recipe. I followed it to the letter and it came out squishy with the nastiest spongy texture. The flavor was good but the texture ruined it. I would suggest using less bread or no bread at all because it seems that's where the gross texture came from.

I've been making this for about 30 years - found the recipe in a small (Betty Crocker maybe?) supermarket aisle Christmas recipe book. Anyway - my family loves it and this has become a Christmas breakfast tradition.  At Thanksgiving I pick up an extra bag of stuffing cubes (unseasoned) and toss it in the freezer.  I use the cubes for this recipe (saves time cutting bread into cubes).  I open the bag a few hours before assembling to dry it out a bit.  You can add any veggie or meat you like and switch up the cheese if desired.  Allows for a wide range of creativity. Really good, quick and easy to assemble and tastes really good the next day as leftovers (if there are any)!   Try this,  you'll like it and thank yourself on Christmas morning when you aren't standing in front of a stove!

I was asked to make a brunch featuring this casserole because my friends love this dish.  However, to help with calories, I use pre-cooked turkey sausage.  I also enjoy adding sautéed crimini mushrooms.  The absolute best part of this casserole is making it the night before and baking it in the morning so the entire house smells delicious.

Added half of a green pepper and a small yellow onion. Was delicious, made it the night before and cooked it in the morning. Would add more salt next time.

Love this recipe but you  tweak it to make your own. There are so many variations. I used  lb. of Bass Sausage ( my preference because of very little grease.(drain fat) which isn't much with this brand of sausage, brown it and added green onion, bell pepper,  sweet onion and leeks sauté  diced very thin, use as much and whatever veggies as you prefer.  I cut-up  potatoes bread (instead of using real potatoes to save time)into cubes and toasted in the oven with butter until golden brown (6-8 slices). Set it a side . I added the wet ingredients which consist of 2 cups of heavy cream and 6 eggs adding 8oz of Cabot Vermont Sharp white/Shred half and add to cream, season with salt and pepper a little garlic powder . Butter your casserole dish and place the toasted bread at the bottom of the pan,  ladle the sausage mixture over the bread evenly then pour the heavy cream/cheese mixture over that and shred the remaining cheese and add on top then place in the oven at 400 degrees for an hour  or until golden brown and bubbly. Let set for 10 min before cutting allowing your casserole to set.

Pretty darn good.  If you want to insure even cooking, use two smaller square cake pans; otherwise, the middle will take forever to set.  I added diced mushrooms (drained and straight from the can) and a sprinkle of baking powder per another reviewer.  Be careful of the salt levels if you add baking powder!!

Perfect comfort food! I didn't have ground mustard so I mixed spicy brown mustard in with the sausage. Turned out fluffy and yummy.

The mustard was a bit much. I used half the second time. To be a 5 you will have to put your own spin on it. But, this is a simple & tasty dish and great for a breakfast potluck.

I have made this dish for dinner twice.

I used Jimmy Dean Turkey Sausage and used sourdough bread (7 slices)...it came out perfect. I also used 3 sharp cheddar cheese sticks cut into small pieces.

I doubled this recipe for a baby dedication party.  I added half an onion, and several stems of green onion, finely chopped.  I also did half cheddar and half colby cheese.  It was delicious, and everyone raved!  
This is the 2nd time I've made it, and both times, even my 2 year old ate it!  Thanks!!

This recipe is amazing! I like to bake it on Sunday so my family can heat it up for a fast breakfast before school/work during the week.  The only changes I make are going for lower fat/healthier options (fat free cheese, spicy lean turkey sausage, etc), but of course, that is just my preference, and in all fairness the original recipe does taste better. Whichever you choose, you can't go wrong. It's delish.

Love this!!!  All my kids loved it as well.  We have 10 children, so next time I make it, I'll be doubling it, but keeping the sausage amount the same.  It made breakfast on Thanksgiving so easy!  I really enjoyed it!

This is our go to breakfast casserole. We add a little salt and pepper to the egg mix as well as 1/4 cup of buttermilk, baking powder (for a fuller texture) and mushrooms.

After all the wonderful reviews, I was surprised to find that I really didn't care for the overall dish.  All the flavors were certainly there, but the "crust" was a little funky.

I made this with turkey sausage for less fat, then added about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning for better flavor. It freezes well, but does not warm up well in the microwave (heats unevenly).

I've made this recipe twice, once without the cheese (had it sitting on the counter and just forgot to put it in). Interestingly, I didn't miss the cheese much in the second version, so for a lower fat option, you could leave the cheese out. One thing I did both times was whip the eggs and milk with a whisk which made it so light and fluffy. I also made it the morning of instead of the night before and it was fine, so don't shy away from making it if you don't have time to let it sit.

This was so bad I felt guilty not reviewing it.  I love flavor & texture.  This had neither.  It was completely tasteless & despite another review that said it was spongy I made it.  It's spongey.  There is a way to fix all of the problems this recipe is running into, but trust me, you do not want to do it on Christmas morning.

I covered it with foil for 3/4 of the baking time.  I made one with ham and one with sausage.  I also added 9 eggs and a little more bread.  I used 1/2 white bread and 1/2 whole wheat bread.  I would probably add peppers and onions next time like others have suggested.

I have made this breakfast casserole a few times, but instead of the white bread I use herb croutons and I also add mushrooms.  The cheese I use is Colby Jack and it turns out great every time.  My family loves it!

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have time to let it sit for hours so I took the advice of another reviewer and let the bread soak while I cooked the sausage. I added onion and some bell pepper to give it a little more flavor and color and baked it about 45 minutes. Hubby loved it and there's lots left over for breakfast and dinner tomorrow.

My family loved it. Served it for a brunch day after Thanksgiving. Took a little longer to cook than stated in recipe but all ovens vary so not a big deal.

Make sure to use a good size bowl for easy mixing. I used a stale baquette and it worked well.

Great base that you can change up by adding different meats and veggies. My family really enjoyed it. I did not make it the night before. I mixed the milk, eggs and bread let it rest while I chopped my veggies.

Subbed out bread for 6 ounce box of seasoned croutons. Worked like a charm!

This was really good. I also cheated and baked it as soon as I assembled it. I will probably let it sit over night next time, as it did turn out a little soggy in the middle even though I baked it for about an hour.I just microwaved those pieces... lol. It was still good though. I used lean sausage links, fried and cut into pieces.  I also did not have any bread, so I used 3 whole wheat bagels cut into cubes. I will definitely use the bagels again next time I make this!

Pretty good breakfast casserole.  Didn't change much, just used maple sausage and sourdough bread.  Maybe next time I'll add some sauteed spinach and mushrooms, or some other veggies.  I also halved the recipe (there's only the two of us), and baked in a glass 8x8 dish, and turned out great.

Great recipe for a crowd. I had 18 people staying over for Thanksgiving, and knew I would not want to be making breakfast on Thanksgiving morning while trying to get dinner ready. I doubled the recipe, put everything together the night before, baked the pans in the morning and had a tasty hot breakfast for everyone. 
I used what I had on hand, which were Hawaiian sweet rolls instead of bread slices, and regular yellow mustard. My grocery store only had sage sausage, but it was super yummy and a nice complement to the recipe.
You could also change this recipe up a lot depending on you and your family's preferences. Excellent as is or as a base for your creative breakfast ideas.
