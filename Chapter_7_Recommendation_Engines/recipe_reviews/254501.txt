This was by far the best cherry pie I've ever made or eaten.
I used sour cherries in a jar (2 jars) and followed the recipe.  I had a hard time getting the lattice to brown so I turned on the broiler for 2 minutes at the end.

I will make it again. It was delicious. I used fresh cherries that tasted wonderful in the pie.
