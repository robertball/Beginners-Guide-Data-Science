This is a great Friday night dish!  I picked up fresh mahi mahi on my way home from work, prepped the marinade, and enjoyed a glass of wine with dear hubby before he fired up the grill.
Lovely subtle taste and perfectly cooked fish made this one a keeper!
Sorry for the slightly blurry picture - we were hurrying to enjoy the meal!  ;)

We don't get mahi mahi in New Zealand so I used a local fish instead. It would have worked really well but for the fact the lemon juice seemed to overwhelm the flavours of the herbs. Next time I'll add the lemon juice carefully to the oil, mix and taste. But certainly it's potentially a lovely summery dish.
