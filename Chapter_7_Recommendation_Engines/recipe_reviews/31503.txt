When I first had this at Andrea's house last Thanksgiving I thought, "Mustard Beans?  Um...okay."  But let me tell you...YUM-MY!!!  I stole the recipe from her and made it several times myself.  If you make this dish, you will not be disappointed!

This was terrific.  I followed the recipe pretty much as directed except I ball-parked the roue and the milk so I wouldn't end up with too much, and instead of using processed cheese, I used 1/4 cup parm and a 1/4 cup old cheddar.  Wow, was it ever good.

As written, three stars as its bland. But you can easily get it to 4 stars by simply adding a little garlic powder and parsley (or other seasoning combos you enjoy). We also up the mustard and use cheddar cheese for more flavor. I use fresh beans and boil them for about 20 minutes before adding them to recipe and they seem to be cooked just right when they come out of the oven.
