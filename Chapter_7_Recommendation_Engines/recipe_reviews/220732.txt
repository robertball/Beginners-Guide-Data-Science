Very tasty. I had to double the breadcrumbs because the batter was too soft and was breaking apart in the pan.  I also added Italian Seasoning and Red Pepper Flakes because I like a kick.  After pan-frying I added to a whole wheat pita and topped with goat feta cheese, tzatziki sauce, lettuce, turkey bacon, and jalapenos.  My brother and boyfriend enjoyed them very much!
