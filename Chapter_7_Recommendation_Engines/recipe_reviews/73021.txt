What an amazing mixture of ingredients.  I did not have sun dried tomatoes, but I used all of the other ingredients.  I could really taste everything and it blended very well together. I felt like baking the chicken was not necessary and would heat up the house.  So I cooked it on the stove top.  I cooked the bacon first then I used the bacon grease to cook the chicken, (depending on how fatty your bacon is you might want to drain some of it off). Then while I chopped the chicken into small bite size pieces I cooked the zucchini and squash in the same pan.  After cut, I put the chicken back in the pan.  Once everything was cooked how I liked it, then I sprinkled evenly the parm cheese, nuts, and bacon on top, but did not stir in.  It gives it a very pretty presentation. I coated the pasta with the Alfredo Sauce.  I would put it on the plate, and put the chicken mixture on top. I rarely ever give something 5 stars, mostly because I ignore those reviews and look at the 2-4s, however this was too good to give a 4.

This was excellent!  We have an abundance of summer squash from the garden and are getting a little tired of it so decided to try this for a little variety.  I sauted the chopped garlic in oil for just a minute or two before adding the cubed the chicken and squashes.  Just before all were done I added about 1/2 cup slice mushrooms and the diced sun-dried tomatoes.  I then tossed in the cooked hot pasta and the Alfredo sauce with milk along with 1/4 cup real bacon bits (instead of cooking and crumbling bacon) and heated everything through.  I omitted the almonds and I added the Parmesan at the table because some don't like it.  We loved this and with the changes I didn't dirty all the dishes in the kitchen.  We'll definitely make again!  Thanks!

Yum.To do a true review,I used all ingredients.I did throw in the zucchini while the chicken cooked on the stove top so that it would not be mushy just tender.While the chicken was still partially frozen I cubed it. I must admit that this recipe rocks.Even the non zucchini eater in the family gobbled it up.Full of flavor,great way to get zucchin into the little ones diet.Thanks again for the yummy recipe.Also would have been fine w/o almonds.

Great dish!  I followed another reviewer suggestion and sauteed the chicken with the zucchini and squash, which was much easier than baking.  Didn't add any bacon, and it still tasted great!  Also, I think the almonds are a wonderful addition.  I don't know if I would have enjoyed it so much without the almonds, so don't skip them!

I made this tonight with the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site -- I don't care for the jarred stuff and find this one super easy.  This recipe was great!  Fab way to use up my football sized zucchini.  The only thing I did differently was using fresh tomatoes (got those coming out my ears) and omitting almonds.  Thanks for a nice twist!

A very good recipe. I added three bell peppers and used 12oz Roasted Pepper Alfredo.  I think a little more sauce would have been great, but I love sauce.  I thought it was quick and easy with minimal clean-up (two pots).

I'm not surprised we liked this so much...it has several of our favorite ingredients! I actually used turkey because the chicken selection at the store didn't look too good. I used an alfredo sauce with roasted red peppers and added a lot of black pepper to it--delicious. I used garlic-parmesan flavored almond slivers. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome. And it made terrific leftovers! Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! Hands down one of the best things I've made this summer.  Didn't change anything.  Used All Recipes "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" and together is was wonderful!

My husband loved this and even ate the veggies which he normally doesn't like.  It didn't fool my 2 year old though.  He still picked them out.  I adjusted this for 9 servings because it just didn't seem like it would make the 6 servings.  I was right.  We had enough for 6 for dinner and leftovers for lunch for 2 with it adjusted to 9 servings.

Okay, to be fair, maybe I just didn't like the brand of alfredo sauce I used but I didn't like this recipe at all.   I love all of the ingredients but didn't think the flavors blended well.  Plus, I had to dirty alot of different pans.  Won't make it again.

we loved it! it was a really nice change from the usual chicken dishes we have. not surprisingly, finding a recipe for alfredo sauce (the kind you make) was as easy as typing "alfredo sauce" in the search field on allrecipes.com. just required that i think a little outside the box. thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was fantastic! I used all fresh garden veggies. 1 lg zuchinni, 2 small straight neck squash, 1 lg tomato. I I pan fried the chicken in Italian dressing and sprinkled it with garlic powder while it was cooking. I sauted a whole diced  fresh tomato for 10 minutes to cook off some of the liquid and the added in the squash and let the veggies steam  while I cooked the pasta and cubed up the chicken. added the cubed chicken and  bertollis alfredo sauce and cream instead of milk and let it all simmer together for another 10 mins. My boyfreind and I ate the whole thing! I am already planning on making it again! Next time I think I will add shome fresh cheese with the alfredo to make the sauce  a little thicker, but it was still wonderful. I forgot all about the bacon and almonds but I bet they are good too!

Really tasty.  I just sauteed the chicken and veggies, then added the sauce.  Served it over whole wheat spiral pasta.  I've always struggled knowing how to use yellow summer squash and now I've got a somewhat healthy use for it.

Thank you CALLIEW for sharing your delightful recipe.  When I served it to my family it was declared a keeper and will be made again and again.  I made absolutely no changes to the ingredients what so ever; only your method by turning it into a 'skillet/one-pot' meal'.  Following is the method I used should you like to do the same sometime. •  I Skipped steps 1 and 2 in the recipe and pan fried the chicken in a little oil and butter instead of baking which IMO keeps the chicken tender and juicy as well as flavorful.  Removed from the pan, cooled and then chop into bite-size pieces. •  Step 5 option.  After frying the chopped bacon I reserved some of the drippings, added the oil and sauted the zucchini and yellow squash with some minced garlic (don't let it burn) until tender and lightly browned. •  Step 6.  I mixed the Alfredo sauce and milk as stated.  Poured it on top of the pasta along with the remainder of the ingredients, mixed and served.  Note:  For quick and easy a deli roasted chicken would work equally as well.

I was looking for a copy cat of a frozen dinner my parents used to buy, and this was it.  I made the "quick alfredo sauce" from this site and it was great, and can be scaled to the right amount.  This is really good with red peppers as well.  My only 2 negatives were the amount of dishes this uses and i added an extra 1/2 c of alfredo, and i honestly think it needed about another 1/4 c more.  This recipe made well over 6 servings for our family, around 10 serv at least.  I will def be keeping this recipe on hand this summer!

This was really good.  I sprinkled the chicken and veggies with Mrs. Dash Tomato, Herb, and Garlic seasoning, as well as garlic salt.  Then I grilled everything.  I mixed the pasta and chicken with the sauce and placed it in a casserole dish.  I placed the veggies and tomatoes down the center and sprinkled with the parm.  I baked it for about 15 minutes and then topped with the crumbled bacon.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

I think the recipe as written made this recipe more complicated than it needed to be, so I changed it up to simplify... first I cooked the bacon and set aside.  I drained off about half of the bacon grease and then I started browning the chicken in what remained.  I then added the garlic, after a few minutes, I added about half of the bacon along with the squash and cooked until slightly tender.  I then added the sun-dried tomatoes (re-hydrated in boiling water then drained) and alfredo sauce and gave it a good stir.  Seasoned as needed with salt and pepper, then just stirred the pasta into the sauce.  I used whole grain penne pasta instead of what was instructed and the milk wasn't needed because of the liquid the squash gave off.  Served it topped with parmesan, bacon and almonds.  The almonds did throw me off for a moment but then I enjoyed it because of the different texture in it.  Quite good!

This was amazing! I did make Alfredo Sauce from Allrecipes for this recipe and used double the amount for the sauce. Next time I would double the squash. Served with Roasted Green Beans and Dandelion Greens with a Kick.

This was pretty good.  I didnt add the almonds.  I did think that the sun dried tomatoes clashed a bit with the squash.  I think regular tomatoes would go better with this.  I didnt do all the steps is says to do, as far as baking etc.  After cooking the bacon, I just seared the chicken and squash in the same skillet and threw the remaining sauce ingredients all in together and topped it over the pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of our all time favorites! I have been making it for 2 years now. In the summer we have it one or two nights a week using veggies from our garden. Tonight I grilled the chicken breasts (it made it so much easier and more tasty). While they were on the grill I sauted the zucchini and squash with olive oil, garlic powder and salt and pepper. Also cooked the whole wheat linguini during that time. Mixed the milk and Alfredo sauce in a bowl and microwaved for 1 to 2 minutes. When everything was ready, divided the noodles in large bowls (rather than plates), topped with zucchini and squash, sprinkled on bacon bits, almonds, and Parmesan cheese (left out the tomatoes), put a grilled chicken breast on top of all that and poured the warm sauce over the whole thing. AWESOME!!!!!

I used this recipe with guests visiting for the first time.  We were all amazed at how good it is!  I did not bake the chicken; instead I grilled it on my George Foreman with just salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil.  I did not have the sundried tomatoes or almonds on hand, it was terrific, anyway.  Great use of my over-abundance of summer squash and zucchini from the garden!

I cooked the chicken, squash and garlic in a frying pan with coconut oil. I microwaved the bacon for a minute and then cut it up and finished it in the frying pan with the other ingredients. I used Rice-A-Roni noodles alfredo in the box (which I prepared in a sauce pan and then added to the frying pan). Then mixed in the softened sundried tomatoes, added the parmesan cheese and almonds on top. This was so delicious, better than an Italian restaurant! Yum!

I didn't bake the chicken. I cooked everything stove top. Other than that I followed this recipe exactly. Loved it! I made this for my mother's birthday dinner and everyone else loved it too! Thanks

Absolutely delicious and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. I prepared the meal the way cograndma4 suggested,  sautéing the chicken with garlic and adding squash etc. Because I am West Indian I felt like the chicken was missing flavour so I added salt and black pepper before adding the pasta and I also added Maggi Season-up (a seasoning salt we use in Trinidad). I topped with the parmesean only when serving serving. For the Alfredo sauce I used Mccormick's garlic alfredo mix. Making the sauce as directed on the pack. Everything combined was absolutely delicious!

I would have liked more flavor esp with the effort I put into it.  I cooked chicken cubes and squash together..mistake!  Squash too soft.  Note to self...cook separately using same pan.  Next time mix Alfredo sauce with pasta, and present at table with vegetables on top, garnished with almonds and bacon bits.  It needs more salt, pepper,garlic, and maybe red pepper flakes.

I've made this several times, and love it, but as written it needed a bit more zing, and it uses too many pans.  I dice up the chicken before cooking, and just saute it in the bacon fat (after pouring off most of the fat).  I then add the summer squash (I use more squash than the recipe calls for)and saute for a few minutes.  I use a full jar of alfredo sauce, but since those pre-made sauces don't have much taste, I add lots of fresh-grated parmesan cheese directly to the sauce.  I make this frequently during the summer.

Loved it! We used whole grain pasta, light Alfredo sauce, and turkey bacon for a lighter option.

Awesome dinner!!  I cooked the bacon on the stovetop, added the raw chicken to the same pan to cook, and then added the squash to cook it all together, I put the alfredo sauce in at the end and served with the parmesan cheese and almonds on top.  Yummy!  Every kid liked it in our house...I love a whine-free dinner :)

We loved it. Most ingredients were on hand. What wasn't was subbed and it was still an excellent dish. I did grill the chicken, no sun-dried tomatoes but chopped up a tomato out of our garden and sprinkled it over the top. No almonds so I subbed toasted walnuts. My gr.kids loved it, too. Easy dish to prepare; very inspiring! Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe and very easy to make.  I also added some basil to the chicken, which added a bit of taste and I did not have any sun-dried tomatoes so I got the pasta "sun dried tomato" dry mix and used 1/2 of the packet.
Will make again soon!

This was a nice dish.  Although it took me a long time to make.  Only because I made my own alfredo sauce and home made pesto.  So that added a lot of time.  But in the end worth it.  Next time I make it I will already have the pesto.  I followed the directions and it turned out good.  My kids liked it too.  I will make it again.

I rated it a 4 bcoz I can never find a reference in your recipes stating the number of people (approx) the recipe feeds.  My zucchini was bad so I substituted fresh broccoli & I also added fresh cherry tomatoes.  Those two items added so much color to the dish!  My family will taste tonight, but I am sure they will love it.  I can't wait to try it myself!

Very simple and easy recipe. The family enjoyed it. I will make it again and perhaps find a way to jazz it up a little bit. I like more complicated flavors, but there is nothing wrong with this as is.

Delicious. Just used a cup of Classico Alfredo sauce and added the other ingredients to it. I used roasted red bell peppers instead of tomatoes and left out the almonds. The squash overcooks easily, so just saute for a few minutes on high. I also used a 1/2 lb of chicken instead, and included the garlic in the sauce.

Very good. I cooked the chicken in the skillet after cooking the bacon, instead of baking it. I probably would have enjoyed the sun dried tomatoes if I chopped them smaller. But you could skip them and it would still be delicious. Loved the almonds, bacon, zucchini, and squash combination!

I needed to find something to make for dinner. My husband bought groceries this last time and I had chicken thighs and yellow squash left. I don't particularly like squash. I typed in chicken and squash in the search bar and this was the first recipe that came up. I am so glad I found it. I doubled the recipe and invited my extended family over for dinner. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes or almonds but I had two fresh tomatoes I cubed and threw in the last few minutes I sautéed the squash. I would definately make this again.

Very Good!  We had it for dinner and again for lunch the next day.  We love pasta so I already knew that I'd be adding/omitting some things.  I omitted the bacon and used turkey italian sausage that I browned in the casing, put in a bowl (with drippings) to cool, then sliced on a bias and browned the slices in a smaller pan.  I then used the larger pan used for the inital browning to saute onions, mushrooms, garlic and zucchini with the pan drippings and half of the oil.  I added a tablespoon of Badia Complete Seasoning with 2 pinches of red pepper flakes.  I would have liked to try it with the almonds but we were out.  Great base recipe.

I did not have zuchinni or sun dried tomatoes. But it still turned out great! I used half and half because I had no milk and even then, it still turned out great (very creamy though!). I added one red pepper, doubled the garlic, and used one small acorn and one small butternut squash. I did not have chicken breasts but did have pre-cooked chicken chunks and I used those. It was delicious. I also had it with couscous and it was great. Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic. Used the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe on this site. Didn't have almonds, and I substituted chopped fresh tomatoes for sun-dried because that's all I had, but the fresh tomatoes were actually a really nice and light counterpoint to the overall heaviness of the dish. Will definitely make again (and again).

Omitted the sun dried tomatoes (too tangy for my tastes) and cooked the squash in the bacon grease. Pretty awesome.

This was pretty good.  Not a combination I had ever thought of, but it totally worked.  I got carried away and ended up with too much zucchini and squash, not to mention the fresh mushrooms I added, so I ended up using a whole box of bowtie pasta and a whole jar of alfredo.  I also used canned tomatoes instead of sundried.  It made a ton.

A nice easy recipe and good way to use up some of the abundance of zucchini from the garden.  Used mushrooms instead of sundried tomatoes.  Also cooked the chicken on the stove top instead of in the oven.

This dish was fabulous! I added chopped onion when I sauted the chicken and squash and at the end I sprinkled on some chopped fresh rosemary. What a hit!

Love it!   I didn't use sundried tomatoes, only because I personally do not like them.  Everything else was done according to the recipe.  This was great!

Since the summer squash is in at the local farm I was happy to see this as a daily dish.  My whole family loved this -- even the picky eater!  I made a couple of changes -- sauteed the garlic in olive oil and cooked the chicken in it on the stovetop.  I also didn't use the sundried tomatoes -- thought they might be too  much flavor for a couple of my crew.  Everyone loved this!  Thank you.  Thank you.

Hi All, I made this tonight with a few changes because of what I had on hand.  It was awesome. I used shrimp in place of chicken and I sent a vegetarian version from here to my DD too.  I know she will love it as well.  I even have enough for lunch for hubby tomorrow.  Bev

This was an excellent basic recipe.  I did not have some of the ingredients - I doubled the summer squash instead of the zucchini and I put a real tomato cut up skipped the bacon and almonds because I did not have them and the recipe was great.  Something I will have again and maybe I will have the other ingredients.

This was REALLY good. I can't wait to make this again.  And there are no onions involved!  I did add some fresh garlic to the squash as it was cooking. With the bacon, the kids really liked it - but still picked out the squash.  I did not have sundried tomatoes, so I added half a can of drained petite diced tomatoes.  Perfect!

This was a hit with my family.  I have two toddlers who gave it the thumbs up, that means it has to be great!  I followed the recipe except that instead of tomatoes (we don't like them), we added roasted red peppers and we used a roasted red pepper alfredo.  We also didn't have the almonds, but it was still fantastic without them.

Even though it takes a while to prepare, it is well worth the wait. A dish you make to impress you friend or family foodies.

Delicious!! Made few changes. Had rotisserie chicken so I cut up about 2 cups of white meat for recipe. Deleted the sun dried tomatoes and sliced almonds for this particular recipe.  Used 3 nice size yellow squash cut in half longways then sliced into normal slices (not thick but not skinny either) and added 10 oz bag of baby spinach-longer stems removed.

Having made this yesterday, I must say this is one of my favorite recipes from this site (and I have many).  What a great blend of incorporated flavors.  Followed the ingredients pretty much to a T but changed the order and method of cooking.  Way too many pots to clean as written in the recipe.  First fry up the bacon in a large skillet, reserving a bit of the bacon grease.  Remove bacon then cook the chicken in same skillet using a bit of the bacon grease.  Remove chicken then cook squash and zucchini in same skillet using a little bacon grease as needed!  Then put all ingredients including the cooked pasta back into the skillet and mix it up!  This was excellent and I'll definitely make this again very soon!!

The meal was great. I add Kalamata Olives and Artichoke Hearts to the dish. I serve with my San Antonio Red Wine(Sweet Red Wine).

I wish that i had used three zucchinis instead of the two. I added mozzarella cheese on the top when i put it in the oven. I also used a 12" cast iron skillet to cook the veggies in and then baked the entire dish in it since it was already hot and oiled. I grilled the chicken instead of baking it to minimize the heat in the kitchen and it gives it a nice flavor.

Thank you so much for your recipe! My 10 year old literally said it was the best pasta dish. I enjoyed every step and although there was a lot of pans and dishes to be washed, I manage to keep up during cooking time. It is delicious and the flavors do all combined well together.
I used Hickory bacon, and Garlic Alfredo sauce. Everything else was as the recipe asked for. I didn’t change anything. Thank you. #Contreras house hold

I used all the same ingredients; however, I prepared the dish differently and for a larger crowd.  The flavors were excellent which is why I'm giving it five stars and not giving less because I altered the recipe.

I subbed roasted red peppers for the tomatoes. I used a Knorr packet of Alfredo sauce and it was alright but not the greatest. Of course the really unhealthy jars of sauce are way better, but I'm trying to cook healthier. My 7 yr old didn't like the zucchini.

We thought this was a good recipe. Had a package of chicken tenderloins, which I pulled the tendons out of them and basically baked chicken chunks with garlic on top on an oiled (Pam) pan for 30 min. Meanwhile I cut the squash and zucchini as directed and cooked it over medium in OLIVE OIL. I poured the Alfredo from the jar in the pot I strained the macaroni from. I put some heavy cream in the empty Alfredo jar, shook it and poured it sauce to continue warming up.  When the vegetables were pretty much cooked/ browned I added the chicken chunks to it and shredded some Romano cheese on it.  When I was ready to serve I poured the chicken vegetable cheese mixture over the pasta, and then mixed in the sauce.  I had no bacon or tomatoes but it was still very much enjoyed without it.

This was really delicious.  Olive Garden got nothin' on this recipe.  Changes:  I only had Conchiglie pasta instead of Rigatoni.  I made my own Alfredo sauce (which is the best), and I only used 6 strips of bacon because mine was big!  I also cooked the bacon first in my large non-stick wok.  After I drained off the grease, I wiped out the wok with a paper towel and put my chicken breast in it covered with the crushed garlic.  Once it was nearly done, I removed it to a bowl to sit, and added julienned sundried tomato strips, with the oil, to the pan and sautéed my organic zucchini and yellow squash.  I cut up the chicken and added it back in along with the cooked pasta.  Then I stirred in the sauce, mixing all together, then topped with the crumbled bacon and I stirred that in too.  When ready to serve, I topped with some extra parm and dry-toasted slivered unsalted almonds.  So very good, highly recommend this recipe!

I didn't cook the chicken in the oven. I just sautéed it in a frying pan on the stove. My kids don't like tomatoes, so I skipped those. I also just turned it into a casserole, and combined it all. Overall, it was good.

It was very good and easy to put together. I didn't bake it-it doesn't need it. I cooked the veggies with the chicken.

Thank you for the delicious recipe.  Like other viewers, I cooked it in one skillet.  I also added mushrooms and a little bit of red pepper flakes.  Yummy and easy!

Like others suggested, I cooked the chicken with garlic, onions and bacon, drained the pan and then added the zucchini, squash and red pepper (I didn't have sundried tomatoes on hand). I added a little bit of chardonnay to the alfredo sauce along with the milk. Added a little parsley and omitted the almonds (didn't have any on hand). Really tasty!

This was a good starting point for a low carb meal.  Instead of using rigatoni (high carb), I spiralized the yellow squash and zucchini , then tossed it in a skillet with a little EVOO, salt & pepper for a couple of minutes, and substituted it for the pasta.  Delicious, quick and easy, especially if you have cooked chicken (which I always do) on hand.

I sautéed the chicken and half of the  bacon  in the same skillet  thus keeping the oven heat out of the kitchen.  I used another skillet and while cooking 2 slices of bacon also added the squash.  I used fresh cherry tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes.  In addition, I used gluten-free pasta.  This was a fantastic dish.  I'm going to bring it to a picnic as a cold pasta salad.  We ate this dish hot.

My husband and I are starving college students and needed to use up some squash and zucchini. This came up on the Ingredient search, so I gave it a shot! I made lots of cheap substitutes (no almonds, garlic powder for minced garlic, just a bit of pepper jack cheese instead of the specified Parmesan, fresh tomatoes sautéed with other veggies instead of sun dried, and fettuccine noodles instead of the fancy pasta), and my husband and I LOVED the dish! I look forward to making it again in a triple batch when my parents come to visit, just so I can look forward to the leftovers!

Delicious! Used fresh tomatoes and squash from my garden. Bacon made it unique. Made my own sauce with milk, cheese, and cream cheese. Used chicken thighs instead of breasts.

This is one of the best chicken dishes I have made in a long time. I can't wait to make this again. I used only the yellow summer squash, and mixed chicken broth with the ready made fresh alfredo sauce located in the chilled section of the store. I want to add mushrooms to this dish the next time I make this.

I made this for supper last night. As others suggested I cut the breast into chunks first and pan fried in a lot of garlic. We love garlic so I always use extra. I pan fried the squash in a little bit of the bacon grease for extra flavor. This recipe was excellent and my husband requested that it please be put on rotation. I will definitely be making again and so easy!  I am having some ladies over for lunch and will be using this as the main dish

I like that this is a much healthier version of chicken alfredo with adding the skim milk to the alfredo and adding all the veggies.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  MMmmm.

WOW!!!  Just got finished making this.  Only changes I made was to omit the bacon and the almonds.  I cooked the chicken on the stovetop and added the garlic when it was just about done.  I did add red peppers and this was awesome. Will definitely fix again!!!

I really like this dish. I use homemade alfredo sauce instead of jarred. I do not like jarred alfredo sauce. I've also used sweet 101 tomatoes (halved) in this dish and they are good too. Great dish! Thank you!

This recipe is amazing. You could serve this for either an informal or formal meal depending on the presentation. I served this to adults and picky children alike and everyone loves it. For the church youth group I dumped it all in one pot and mixed it together. It's really filling and the aroma is great in the kitchen when you're cooking it. The leftovers are even better the next day.

This was really good, it takes a little while to make, but worth it. I used spaghetti instead of rigatoni, and didn't use the almonds, and it was great. The hard part is making sure everything is nice and hot when it is is served.

This was great and easy!  I didn't add the almonds because I didn't have them; didn't miss them.  This was so good we split the recipe up and had everyone contribute a little bit for a Saturday evening meal on a camping trip!
