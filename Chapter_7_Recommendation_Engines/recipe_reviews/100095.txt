If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would. I made some changes based on the advice I found here and the results were STELLAR: 1.) Use Garlic/Herb Feta. 2.) Doubled the amount of fresh garlic used (we love garlic at our house) 3.) Add a half cup of Parmesan to the mixture. 4.) Diced Roma tomatoes on top of the mixture after it's in the shells (but BEFORE baking) 5.) Shredded mozzarella on top of the tomatoes. These changes resulted in an absolutely delicious winner of a recipe that is on my permanent keep list.

This turned out really good!  I cut up about 5 strips of bacon into little tiny strips, minced 8 garlic cloves finely, minced 4 shallots finely and sautee it in a wok.  Then threw in 16 oz. spinach (squeezing the life out of it first).  Turn off the stove and added 5 oz. garlic & herb feta cheese and 1/2 of grated parmesan cheese.  While the oven is preheating, I filled 15 mini phyllo cups (one package) with the filling, added diced tomato on top, and topped it off with mozzerella cheese.  Baked it for about 8-9 mins. at 350 to melt the cheese and get the phyllo cups crisp!  OMG, can't tell you how delicious it was!  I made 30 cups in all but still have enough filling for another 15 cups which I'll be back in the store picking more up tomorrow!  Thanks for the sharing this great recipe!

Well, I decided to use this recipe to go with a pasta dish that we were having with dinner.  I thought that 30 to 40 of these little guys would be way to much but I figured we would eat them as left overs anyway.  Well they came out absolutely perfect.  I chop my garlic so that its in fairly large chunks and I basically doubled the amount because we love garlic so much.  These things had the perfect blend of flavors and we ended up eating all of them with the meal.  I give this recipe 5 stars for being quite simple, quick to make, and having wonderful flavor.  A great appetizer or even just a healthy snack on rainy afternoons.

A little bland as is....Add extra garlic and parm cheese as many have suggested OR try my really easy version: I buy 2 packages Stauffers Spinach Souffle. Let them defrost, add garlic salt for some zing and spoon into the phyllo cups. Bake about 12-15 minutes at 375. EASY, VERY TASTY, and CHEAPER!

As another user noted, these are an excellent starting point and I have had tremendous success with making them.  I've always added a bit of cream cheese and fresh garlic.  I've also done a version with artichoke hearts and parmesan.  They are soooo easy and are always a big hit.  I think next time I may try the sundried tomatoes another user mentioned - yum...

Absolutely delightful!  Made these for a birthday party last night and they were gone in no time.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  After reading reviews, I made the following changes:  added more garlic, used Garlic/Feta Herb (6 oz pkg), added 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese to mixture, topped with finely diced Roma tomatoes (used 2) and topped with shredded Moz. cheese.  Next time I will buy four boxes of the phyllo shells because three is not enough.  Will be making this recipe in the near future.

These were delicious; I served them with Francis Coppola Pinot Noir and it was a perfect combination. I used garlic & herb crumbled feta and still added the fresh garlic. Very tasty! I will make these again!

These were good but everyone thought they needed more sauce. I would add a little mayo to moisten them.

I personally loved these, but they didn't go fast at the shower I did.  So much easier than using phyllo dough!

I only gave this four stars b/c I did make some adjustments per the other reviews, however, after making the adjustments it was definately a 5 star recipe.  I added parmesan cheese and 3 cloves of garlic (although if you don't love garlic 2 cloves would be enough). When I removed them from the oven I topped half with diced tomoato and the other half with bacon.  My guests on NYE gobbled them up as soon as I put them down!

These were great, and super easy. I made them for a baby shower, and everyone loved them. I added extra minced garlic and about 1/2 cup shredded parmesan, and they were yummy!

After reading some of the other reviews, i decided to add a little extra flavor to this dish.  I added 2 eggs instead of 1, mixed in some parmesan and mozzerella cheese (just a small handful of each), upped the garlic, added some salt and pepper and finely chopped onion.  I also chopped a tomato and added to the top of each cup.  These were a HUGE hit at my NYE party!  I've had a ton of requests to make them again.  Very flavorful!

Easy to make! Modified recipe: 1 egg, 3 cloves of garlic minced, 8 oz crumbled feta cheese, 10oz thawed and dried chopped frozen spinach, 2 packages of phyllo cups, 3 tbsps of real bacon bits, dash of garlic powder, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and chopped roma tomatoes as other review suggested. Baked 10 mins at 400 degrees. Delish!

These are great. I'd give it 5 stars if the recipe was written as I prepared it. :) My grocery store didn't have phyllo cups so I had to make my own in mini muffin tins out of phyllo dough. Takes a bit more time and patience to prepare, but I predict they looked and tasted better this way. I also added chopped tomato and parm on top. Will be making again and tweaking again for fun new appetizers!

These were a hit at Easter Dinner.  I read some of the reviews and doctored the recipe slightly.  I added finely minced sun-dried tomatoes.  I used the ones packed in oil...about 8 pieces in all.  I also added an additional egg because it looked too dry.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were quick, easy and delicious! The only thing I changed was I added more garlic and I saute the spinach with some garlic, salt & pepper. Everyone raved about them! Definitely will be made again!

I tried this recipe for the first time. I did see some of the reviews on here, and changed some of the recipe. I only had 2 boxes of fillo cups, so I needed to adjust the recipe. I left out the egg, since I bought frozen creamed spinich (which ended up being a nice addition to the recipe!). Instead of cloves of garlic, I used garlic powder (as well as onion powder, which I think also really helped and was super easy). I also added chives (dry-freezed from the seasonings bottle; it was extra greens I had lying around to help make up for all the extra ingredients I was adding), breadcrumbs (some other spinich recipe I saw called for breadcrumbs, and I was looking for something extra to add to the mix), mozzarella cheese (the feta cheese I bought wasn't enough I felt, so I added extra mozzarella I had in the fridge), and a bit of mayo (someone suggested it to soften the filling). I was very impressed with how easy this recipe was, and how quick it was to prepare! I made these for an event later today, but I was so tempted to eat all of them last night after trying them! I even game some to my friend, who hates most vegetables. She really enjoyed them and said it is something she would actually eat again! Definitely will  make this again! The filling was chessy without overdoing it, the frozen cream worked very nicely witht he spinich and herbs I threw in the pot (I just heated everything on a low setting while mixing), and the breadcrumbs made everything more filling. 5 stars!!!

I was so disappointed with this. After all the amazing reviews, I was expecting a tasty outcome. Instead, I was overwhelmed with the spinach taste. Maybe I should try all the extras (tomatoes, etc.) if I ever try this again.

These were excellent and easy to make. I added a bit of johhny's garlic seasoning into some plain feta and mixed it together with some herbed feta. Will definitely make again.

This was a very easy recipe but I thought it was kind of bland.  I might add some other ingredients next time like philly cream cheese.

Great concept. Leave out the garlic and use the herbed feta cheese and 2 tbsp grated parm cheese.Also maybe brown some sausage and add to spinach mixture.Note to Brian... They sell the pre-baked tart shells in the freezer section at the grocery store.No fuss.

As is this recipe is just ok.  I added some smoked sun dried tomato which was a must for flavor.  I will add more cheese next time, maybe parmesan or monterey jack.

Very easy and tasty!  Used the garlic and herb feta, added a bit of cream cheese (didn't measure it but about 1/4 cup), a handful of parmesean and a bit of chopped sun dried tomatoes.  (Only used one 10 oz. package of spinach and 4 oz feta to make a smaller batch.  Used one egg and 2 large garlic cloves.  Topped with parm cheese and baked for 8 min.  Made approx 24 cups.  They were a hit!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I cook Spanakopita all the time (Greek Spinach Pie using Phyllo Pastry) and found this recipe and it is absolutely DELIGHTFUL. Made the cups by myself (cut the pastry and then set them in a cupcake tin), that is the only thing I altered.   I love it!

These are so good. I made them for a party and they were very well received. I added 3/4 teaspoon of salt and some chicken to the original ingredients. I stuffed the shells and sprinkled them with some diced tomatoes and an Italian 3 cheese blend before baking. Excellent!!

These were very good. I served them with the Spicy Seafood Shell Appetizers from this site and it made a pretty presentation. I made both fillings in the morning and filled the cups just before guests arrived. Next time I make them, I will add minced onion and a bit more garlic. So easy!

I just made these for a party tonight. Absolutely delicious! I added the bacon and shallots suggested by ChaChaChia and also used the tomato and basil feta.

I made these for a baby shower and they were great. I used Mediterranean herb flavored feta for a little extra flavor. Everyone loved them! Thanks!

Great, though they take time since phyllo dough is hard to work with!

Followed recipe exactly, the spinach had a raw taste to it, So I popped it back in the oven. It was very bland and boring. I so wanted to like this but  it  just didn't do it for me.

The taste was good and very easy to make.  I might add an extra egg next time but one thing I would suggest if you buy the frozen chopped spinach is to chop it up into finer pieces since it was a little stringy when I made it.  And what makes phyllo cups so expensive anyway?  Yikes.

I used 3 cloves of garlic and added parmasan cheese.  I made these 2 days in a row for different parties, everyone loved them.  The plate was empty in about 10 min.

More like 4.5 stars.  An excellent starting point.  I added some onion powder and Cavendar's Greek Seasoning to the spinach mixture--next time I will use the tomato and basil crumbled feta.  They tasted wonderful, reminded me of spanikopita from my fave Greek restaurant in town.  These are easy and quick to prepare and taste wonderful...a definite addition to my regular rotation of appetizers!

I've served this twice and it went over fairly well both times.  It's something different than the usual appetizer offerings, plus it's attractive and quick and easy to make.  I used only one box of spinach and two packages of the phyllo shells.
