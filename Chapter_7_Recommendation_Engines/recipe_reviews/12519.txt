Based on the previous review I baked this longer than the recipe suggested. May follow recipe exactly next time and based on how great this tastes there WILL be another pie!

This is very close to my mother in law's recipe but she uses 2 tablespoons of flour and also includes a teaspoon of cinnamon. We serve it with a creamy hard sauce and it is a favorite every Thanksgiving!
