Great recipe minus the walnuts and pineapples. I used rasberries, black berries, blue berries and a few strawberries on top. It was delicious!!! I like it best refrigerated overnight though. Thanks!

A quick, easy to make recipe that everyone loved. Drizzled Hershey's Chocolate syrup in the top.

Very easy to put together. I make this but use 1 large package of instant vanilla pudding & frozen fruit.  I use strawberries, blueberries, & peaches for the fruit mix.
