I used a box of Ghirardelli dark chocolate brownie mix and added the 9 raspberry chocolate squares in the middle of the batter. I baked the brownies according to box directions. I had to use a hand-held mixer on high speed to make the ganache. Using a whisk was not working. Add plenty of raspberries to balance out the ultra sweetness. Next time I think I will leave out the raspberry squares in the brownies as this was a very rich dessert.  Also thought this was a pricey dessert to make.  I served this in cut-glass double old fashion glasses so the presentation was very impressive.

I gave it three stars because all the dark chocolate was too bitter and gross. Tried it with a combination of milk and dark chocolate and it came out great. Only other thing I changed was used a box of browning mix instead of the one given, came out more moist.
