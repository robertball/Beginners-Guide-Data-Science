i would definitely do this again. i have never cooked a turkey before but i read up on it to cook for some friends. i brined my turkey almost 24 hours, which you shouldn't because that's a little too long. the turkey turned out tasting fine, but my gravy was definitely too salty. 

i used oranges instead of apples, i cut each orange in half and squeezed the juice over the turkey then stuffed it inside the cavity along with my vegetables, i didn't do the stuffing. 

i was almost worried that there wasn't going to be enough juice to make gravy but there is so much you'll have plenty. the only bad part was that my turkey stuck to the plastic a little bit and ripped some skin off. my turkey was honestly so tender the drumsticks were falling off when i tried to move the bird to my cutting board. i thought my breast was pretty dry but everyone else thought it was really moist. i would trust them because i don't eat very much roast turkey anyway.

I used this recipe to make my first turkey.  It was fabulous!  Very moist!  Now I'm afraid to stray from this recipe for my second turkey!

megaturkey indeed!  This was quite the turkey!  the stuffing was a bit wet for the bf, and he complained that there were no seasonings on the turkey itself, but otherwise he liked it.  It is a very moist turkey.  Mine took 5 hours to cook, but it was also an almost 20 lb turkey, so I am not surprised.  If not horrendously flavorful, it is nice and moist.  If I do this again I'll salt and pepper the bird itself and rub in some poultry seasoning as well.  Thanks for the recipe.  Spot on directions!

The stuffing was perfect. I diced one apple and left the second halved to cover the turkey ends. 
The apple juice made it moist and had a great flavor. I prefered this over adding wine.

This recipe already uses my basic stuffing recipe that I love, so I decided to try it and we LOVED it. We will definitely make it again, and again, and again. Ours was 13 lbs, and it was just right. Not so many left overs that they will go bad, but just right for a family of 4. The turkey was moist and wonderful and the apples (I used green) were a great touch.  I did use salt, pepper and garlic powder on outside of the turkey before putting it in the bag. The hardest part of the recipe was finding the oven bags the day before Thanksgiving, the first 2 stores were sold out! Thanks for sharing!!!

IF you want brown crispy skin you'll have to SLICE OPEN the bag so that the dry heat can reach the skin ... that may dry out the white meat IF it hasn't been brined. IDK about this .... think I'll stick to my brined and dry roasted and browned birds ... tyvm

Simple recipe for a great turkey. The apple juice and the roasting bag make sure that the bird comes out nice and juicy, and the apple adds a nice subtle flavor to the meat. I added a bit too much garlic to the stuffing but I liked the consistency of it (moist without being completely soggy) and can't fault the recipe, just how careful I was being. I will definitely make this recipe again soon.
