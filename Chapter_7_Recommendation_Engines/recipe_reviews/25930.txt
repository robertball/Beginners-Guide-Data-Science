I made this for lunch today, great recipe. Very easy and tasty! I used half a packet of taco seasoning (a whole packet just looked like too much), added some chopped green onion and some shredded cheddar cheese in with the mix. Spread some on tortillas and top with lettuce...mmm good!

I liked this recipe. It's fast and easy to make. I used green onions as well. I also added tumeric and paprika for color. It may sound strange, but I also put about 1tsp of lemon juice because it seemed like it was "missing something". The lemon juice blended well and brightened the flavor.

Very good, and very easy! I had something similar at an event I attended. I added some white corn, and some rice to the mixture with some beans. It was great! After adding the rice I did add the rest of the taco seasoning and it was yummy! I think next time I may add some green pepper and some onion. My daughter loved it which was a shock!

Good. Easy.  I added jalapenos and green onions and omitted the celery. This is a repeat recipe but may try a few different tweaks.

My daughter and I cooked a whole chicken the other night, wasn't sure what to do with the left overs...I ended up looking for a different chicken salad receipe and found this one...I didn't have taco seasoning but I did have chilie seasoning, I used fat free mayo and celery, my daughter wanted me to put a hard boiled egg in it too so we did...it was wonderful. Thank you for help.

Very good, although lacking something.  Definitely doesn't need a whole packet of taco seasoning.  Use lots of cilantro.  Also added frozen corn.  Yum!

Great use for leftover Salsa Chicken! I used homemade taco seasoning and threw in some chopped homemade pickled jalapenos. I made wraps out of this using tortillas, shredded lettuce and halved cherry tomatoes.

The seasoning is a little too strong.  Not something I would crave to eat, but it is ok.  Would be good for a potluck due to simplicity.

Very good.  I had all the ingredients so I made it for lunch.  I didn't have taco mix so I found a recipe on here of how to make taco mix.  Didn't use as much cilantro.  It was a little too creamy but overall was very tasty.

This was great. I Doubled the recipe and only add one package of taco seasoning mix. This was also great for the next day. I made this as wraps and it was great.  I will be passing this around.

I used half of a packet of taco seasoning like many others. Instead of only mayo I used some sour cream as well. I added corn and diced red peppers along with green onions and served it on flour tortilla's with cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was yummy and very easy.

Gving a 4* only because of the amount of chicken stated.  Breasts can be big or small which is why, I think, some reviewers have stated the seasoning overpowered the salad. We enjoyed it in a baked tortilla shell with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream and shredded cheese. Will definitely make again!

Not bad, but use only half the taco seasoning packet, add half a medium onion, chopped.  Also use mayo to your own taste and texture preference!

this was a great, alternative to the classic chicken salad... I modified the recipe to fit what I had laying around the house but it still turned out great. put it on a flour tortilla with lettuce, shredded cheese, and some mild taco sauce (my boyfriend prefers hot sauce so that's what he used)... we loved it!

This was delicious on some toasted bread.  I added about 2.5 Tbls of the taco seasoning (it was homemade off this site, so it didn't have a lot of salt) and I also added some green onions.  We loved this, it was perfect for our little picnic.

I tweaked this recipe a bit to my taste. I did not follow the exact measurements. I used 3 breasts, a handful of chopped cilantro and about 3 celery stalks.  I didn't have taco seasoning so I added salt, chili powder, cayenne pepper and paprika to taste to the mayo. I also added a dash of tapatio (hot sauce) and a squeeze of lime. It turned out excellent and is hard to stop eating. All the hot spices and tapatio can be adjusted to taste. I highly recommend the squeeze of lime juice. It adds a nice fresh flavor

I made this using Taco Seasoning I, for which I reduced the salt by half and left out the crushed red pepper. I made those changes because I know the chili powder I use is particularly salty and spicey. Plus, I boiled the chicken in water with bouillon cubes, which added salt.

I prepared the mixture and served it in Athens Mini Fillo Shells as an hors d'oeuvre. I received many compliments. I will make this again. It is a great make-ahead dish, because the shells are happy to stay in the refrigerator for a week and the "salad" is fine in the refrigerator for a day or two.

This is very good. I didn't have celery so I used green onions. I also omitted the cilantro only becuase I don't like it. 1 package of taco seasoning seems to much so I used 1/2.

This recipe is very good. However I think next time I will cut back to 1/2 as much taco seasoning as what is called for. I may have to adjust again, but as it is, it is still very tasty.

I liked this but do agree with a couple of the other reviews about using less seasoning. A whole packet is alittle too much. I also covered salad with shredded chedder. Would make again.

This is a good recipe but I did make some changes. I added extra chicken breast; a can of black beans; two diced tomatoes and cut the taco seasoning in half. I served it with tortilla chips, tortillas, lettuce, and sourcream for everyone to use. Everything was eaten and everyone thought it was a great salad. Thanks for sharing.

Made this for an easy dinner last night and everyone loved it--including my two-year old. I used three chicken breast halves and shredded them instead of cubing. Used just a tablespoon or so less than a full taco seasoning packet, along with low-fat mayo. Enjoyed the salad wrapped in flour tortillas with lettuce and a drizzle of ranch dressing. This is a keeper.

Incredibly yummy but to cut on fat I only used 1/2 cup of reduced fat mayo and 2 tablespoons of the taco seasoning.  I put it in a fat free flour tortilla with some lettcue.  AWESOME!

WOW!!!! Hubby & I love this.  Easy, too. Great lunch on wraps or for picnic lunch or appetizer w/celery or crackers.  We love to use fresh cilantro in this (I buy it at Super Walmart for 57 cents a bunch) I use precooked chicken strips in it for simplicity. McCormick HOT taco seasoning is good in this too, but be careful how much you add.

Really Good. I used 1/2 packet of taco seasoning from other reviews. I omitted cilantro because I didn't have any and added canned drained black beans and corn. Thank you!

This was THE best chicken salad sandwich that I have ever had!!!  I used the Taco Seasoning I from this site rather than packaged mix and I used leftover Spicy Grilled Chicken also from this site.  I am absolutely hooked - will make again and again and again!

I made this chicken salad with leftover chicken.  The chicken was also from this site and very well seasoned already with cumin and chili powder, so I only used a half of the taco seasoning.  The chicken recipe was "Super Simple Oven Barbequed Chicken".  My husband who is not a fan of chicken salad loved this.  Oh yeah, I added shredded cheddar cheese and green onions also to the mix.

A very tasty chicken salad.  We rolled it in a flour tortilla with lettuce leaves and a dallop of sour cream.  I only went with 4 stars because the flavors were not unique.  It was very familiar to a soutwestern dip flavor.  Tasty but not unique.

This was delicious! I cut back the mayo and used fat free. I added green onions, and used 1 T. of taco seasoning (homemade recipe from this site - Taco Seasoning I). I wrapped in a tortilla as suggested by others with lettuce and cheddar cheese. Delicious and healthy lunch! Thanks!

Very yummy - my husband requests this quite often. I used half the required taco seasoning, like others have suggested and it tastes just right. I have made this with and with out celery - no difference really, just more of a crunch with celery. I also added onions.

Yum! This was delicious. I altered the recipe quite a bit. I made it vegetarian by adding a can of Morningstar Farms 'Diced Chik', instead of chicken. I also added 3 chopped green onions, 1/2 a chopped green pepper, an entire chopped tomatoe, a can of kidney beans, a can of Peaches and Cream corn, about 1/2 c. of mild salsa, 1/4 c. extra mayo, a little bit of water to thin out the dressing (about 3 Tbsp.), decreased the taco seasoning to 1 1/2 Tbsp. (1 ounce=2 Tbsp.), and of course added lots and lots of cilantro because we are cilantro lovers in our household. Very tasty served as a wrap in a warmed whole wheat flour tortilla with some lettuce.

Tried this recipe tonight with hubby. We found great use for the pre-measured one lb., frozen (and thawed) bag of leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Divided it up, and, hubby stuck with his Miracle Whip, while I used 'real' mayo. Taco seasoning was McCormicks, which I got at Target SuperStore. They had a spicier version, I believe. Not into spices, but, next time will use the spicier version. Also, one stalk of celery way too much for this household. Instead went to the spice section and got Celery Seed, which did very well, smelling and tasting fresh. Ate on hoagie rolls. Hubby loves this and is a thumbs up recipe in our household. Also, I read the reviews earlier, and, we went easy with the taco seasoning, as several suggested. We used about half bag, and, might use it for a crockpot chuck roast.

This recipe was excellent and extremely easy. I used about half of the taco seasoning and less mayo than the recipe called for. I didn't have celery, so I tried a bit of finely chopped red onion. I served it in a flour tortilla with some chips and salsa on the side. Delicious.

Awesome flavor!  I used a LOT more chicken (4 Large breasts - and finely shredded in a food processor).  I like more crunch so I used 1/2 c. celery and 1/2 c. green pepper - both finely chopped in food processor.  Excellent as a filling for wraps or as a dip for tortilla chips or vegies.  Yummm!

This was good - my husband liked it, which is great. I added an extra chicken breast (like others suggested). I also added a can of black beans and some diced tomatoes. I used the same amount of mayo and taco seasoning, and there was plenty - I didn't need to add any more. In fact, I was thinking the taco seasoning was a little too much still. I think I'll use less next time (or add more beans). I used vegan mayo (because I'm allergic to eggs), and it still tasted great. We ate it with lettuce in tortillas & it was yummy.

Very, very easy to make.  Delicious.  Great as a wrap.  I used only a little over half of the taco seasoning packet and that was more than enough.  Also added Tabasco smoked chipotle sauce and was great.  Will try next time with either corn, cheese, beans, or chopped onions.

Decent, but not great.  I used a full package of taco seasoning and the texture of the mixture was a little grainy.  I did not have celery on hand, but the salad was fine.  It's a nice twist on the tried and true.

Very yummy!  I left out the celery and used half a package of taco seasoning.  I served it with all the fixings of the taco, minus the shell:  lettuce, diced tomatoes, salsa, sour cream and topped with cheddar cheese.

Sorry, but this is the first recipe I have tried off Allrecipes.com that I have been really disappointed with.  I will usually pick recipes that sound good to me with at least 4 stars.  This pretty much just tasted like the sum of its parts and the ingredients didn't taste good together.  I made the recipe as is, with the exception of halving the taco seasoning.  I give two stars based on the fact that I won't make this recipe again.  This is my rating system:
1 star - inedible
2 stars - edible, but not very good
3 stars - okay, may or may not make again
4 stars - good, will make again
5 stars - great, one of my favorites

Very good, I served it on wheat pita pockets.  One change I did do, I added the seasoning and a bit of oil to the raw chicken and then grilled it in my George Forman grill.  It was the best.

Very easy and tastes great!  My husband is not a fan of chicken, but loved this.  I only used half a packet of seasoning as others suggested.

I also use 1/2 package of the seasoning and add the lemon juice suggested by another reviewer. I have passed this recipe along to several friends.

This is a fantastic chicken salad. the only change I made was to make my own taco seasoning instead of the packaged mix to cut the sodium.

It was a great base to start with, but needed a little more contrast to the chicken and sauce. I didnt have celery so I substituted cucumber and will probably always do that now. It was great. I also added a can of Rotel. Served on a taco wrap with lettuce it was fabulous. This is a keeper for sure. Oh and per other suggestions I used 1/2 the seasoning and it was plenty.

It's missing something and I can't figure it out. Too much salt and needing a little touch of sweet. Otherwise, it is delicious! The grocery store was closed for New Years so we used can chicken and surprisingly, loved it.

OH MY!!! This was so easy!  I made it to taste with mayonnaise and taco seasoning (a whole package would have been too much for us) but I used about 3 tablespoons full and it was amazing.  I will follow other reviewers and serve on a flour tortilla with lettuce as a wrap.  Hope my hubby loves it as much as I do because this a winner!!!

This is so good!!  I used leftover grilled chicken and combined everything in my Kitchen-aid mixer.  I read somewhere that it would shred the chicken for you.  It did!!  So easy to make!

I simply loved it. I didn't have to buy any special ingrediants. I had everything on hand.I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and I cut the taco seasoning in half and I added an egg and green onions and a white onion.....it was delicious and my children who are as different as night and day...(ages 3 and 10) who never like anything that the other one likes both loved it. My fiancee said it was fire......lol meaning really good. Thanks for the recipe...I was able to come home and make it really fast and after a long day at work....this deserves 6 stars......it saved me time, money and energy.
