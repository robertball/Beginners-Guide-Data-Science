After reading most of the reviews I thought I'd share my experience in hopes that someone may be encouraged to try this truly delicious, easy and satisfying meal.  First of all, try to follow the directions as they are.  If you wander off the recipe you might get a stew, onion soup, or bland goulash.  I followed the recipe to the "T" except for         the frozen veggies; I used fresh.  I must say I was a bit hesitant about using onion soup mix along with 1 onion; I feared a tummy ache all night...oh no' I slept very cozy and satisfied.  I baked soft rolls to complete this dinner.  My husband did prefer it a little spicier as in "hot" but my son LOVED it.  Which is what many reviewers' children also say.  Do not fear the onion...and by the way, this IS a soup and a very hearty one at that.   Excellent recipe!

I have made this twice and both times it was great.  I use group sirloin and whole wheat pasta.  

I have read a lot of reviews that comments on using 1 package of onion soup mix, or it they have used 2 it was "too much".  I hope that everyone realizes that the recipe calls for 1 package (1 ounce).  When I purchase dry onion soup mix, it comes in 2-2 1/2 ounce packages.  So some people may be putting in 5 ounces versus 2 ounces.  Just wanted to make note of this.  Be sure to read the package.  Thanks Marge for an easy, filling and healthy recipe!

This soup is great.  However after trying it both ways, we prefer beef broth instead of the chicken broth.

Followed the recipe to a T, even though I was apprehensive about using chicken broth in a beef soup.  Glad I did as it had a pleasant taste.  As I was cooking this I thought it might have too much water until I added the macaroni and of course it used up some of the liquid (I like a thick soup).  Once the macaroni was cooked it was the perfect consistency.  Could perhaps use a touch more seasoning of some sort, but overall a good stick to your ribs soup.  Will make this again.  Update:  I adapted this recipe for the slow cooker...I used 4 cans of chicken broth and no water.  Added a can of niblet corn with the juice.  Added a small can of V8 and 2 packets of low salt beef bouillon.  Everything else was the same, except for I did not add the macaroni until the end (boiled separate and added to soup so it wouldn't take up all the liquid).  It tasted really good.  I still like the original recipe because it's quicker but if you want to use your slow cooker it works good for that too.  The only thing about my slow cooker method is that next time I think I will add some water as the macaroni still sucked up the broth even though I added it at the end.

I have made this a couple of times now, & find that we are increasing each batch as it just seems to get better & better.  We also add 5 or 6 garlic cloves to the ground beef before sauteeing & this has become a real "keeper" at our house!

I don't make reviews often but felt this recipe needed one. It's a perfect remedy for a sore throat.  I halved the recipe, added some fresh garlic(not for taste but for antibiotic properties)and used vegetarian meat crumbles...Fantastic! Follow the recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I took other reviewers' advice and only added one envelope of onion soup.  I ADDED a can of kidney beans, a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a few shakes of garlic powder. This recipe will feed a lot more than four people.  We have eaten it for dinner (twice) and now it's on my desk for lunch! This is a keeper!!

This was so delicious! I was a little weary at first with all the onions but the longer it simmers, the better it gets!
I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato soup and it was still yummy!

I always follow recipies to a T becaue nothing bothers me more than when people write a review on a recipe that they have completely changed.  This recipie if I could would have more than 5 stars as it is the best vegetable beef soup I have ever had.  Also, it seems like the leaftovers taste better and better each day.  I love this soup and it will be the only recipe I use from now on!!!! I must also say too that my 3 year old normally hates soup but he loved this one.  I used sea shell noodles in it and he went crazy over this recipe!!!

I make this regularly and always serve with Garlic Bread Fantastique from this site, which is not your typical garlic bread.  I use salted butter on the bread and leave out the salt because it's pretty salty already and I'm a salt lover.  Ok now about the soup.  It's fast, easy, delicious, and cheap.  I leave out the macaroni which got mushy the first time I made this, and in its place I use boil in bag minute rice, cooked right in the soup. I like to keep the rice outside of the soup and let people add it to their own bowls if they want it (I do!) Enjoy!

This was a good recipe.  I added egg noodles and a can of veg-all to it to make almost a minestrone.  There was too much onion in it for our liking and I only added one packet of dry soup mix. Otherwise my family loved it!

This was much better than I thought it would be, while it was cooking. All I could smell was the package of onion soup mix  (eh...) But after simmering, it took on the flavor of the mix of all the vegetables more. I did use potatoes instead of macaroni (not big fans) and I think that helped mellow the flavor out also. I started at 5:15 and we ate by 6:00. A big plus in my book. A great tasty recipe to use hamburger and get your veggies too.

This was a very good base but it did need to be "kicked up a notch".  I added 4 dashes of Worcestershire, a good amount of garlic, 2 shakes of Cayenne and several cranks of cracked black pepper.  I used a small bag of stew veggies and mixed veggies.  Served it with freshly baked 4 cheese biscuits.  Highly recommend, but be sure to season to your own taste.

Marge I can't tell you how happy I am to find this recipe.  I was making this over 35 years ago and unfortunately due to a flood lost the recipe several years ago.  This past winter I was thinking about this soup and how much my family loved it, but for the life of me couldn't remember how to make it.  Thought it was just passed down, and never thought to look for it on here and here it is!!!  It is so quick and easy and absolutely delicious.  I remember when I was first married and making this soup and money was tight.  Well, it's tight again in these times and this is just perfect.  Brought back a lot of very warm memories!!  Thank you again.

the perfect soup for a winter day. i was surprised at how this soup tastes so much like a cambells chunky soup but BETTER. Me and Hubby LOVED it! served it and mins later, the whole little pot was Gone! made a few times already, highly recommend it. however, i do change the pasta alot. the first time, i used minute rice, small amount, just enough for it to be swimming around in every ladle but not enough to make it Thick. i like my soups brothy. and i do season the beef when i m browning it, garlic powder, pepper, dash of salt, steak seasoning. does the trick every time :P  will keep on making this delicous soup

This is really good soup.  My whole family likes it and they don't agree on much when it comes to food.  The only thing I would suggest is that you keep your noodles seperate from the soup and only add them to the bowl before you are ready to eat.  The noodles will soak up all of the broth if you don't them they are just mooshy and gross.  This recipe makes a good amount of soup too.

Saw several comments about how much dry onion soup mix should be used. Now I'm 64 and wear glasses, but..... It says "2 (1 ounce) packages dry onion soup mix" That works out to a total of two packages weighing one ounce each - OR - TWO OUNCES TOTAL. Works for me.

This soup was extremely easy to make & very delicious! I had most of the ingredients on hand & the ones I didn't I was able to use substitutions without jeopardizing the flavor. I don't buy onion soup mix, but I do have Tastefully Simple Onion Onion & I used 4 tbsp to replace the soup mix. I also don't use or buy celery, so I substituted 2 tsp of celery seed. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. My husband also agreed that it very good. I definitely plan on making this often during the colder months.

I would give this five stars, but the macaroni almost ruined it.  I would add it 15 minutes before the end of cooking if at all.  I will try it again though

It was just okay.  I guess I like my vegetable soup to have more of a tomato flavor. This definately had too much onion. Probably 1 pkg. of onion soup mix would have been plenty. Probably will not make again.

For a low-carb version, I omitted the noodles ,I only used 3 cups of water, and only used 1 pack of the onion soup mix. I added 1 cup of frozen okra for more veggies. It was perfect.

I made this some time ago and just realized that I forgot to write a review. I remember that this was super good and very easy! However, it was better reheated. Next time I will use more noodles.

I have been looking for an easy soup that uses ground beef, this is it. Am making it for a 2nd time tomorrow for after trick or treating, but this time I am going to put it inside a cleaned out pumpkin and put it in the oven on low to serve when we get back.

Easy and delicious.  I used 8 c. water and 4 tsp. chicken bullion, used carrots instead of celery and frozen peas and canned corn instead of mixed veggies(all I had on hand.)  I also used those tiny bow tie noodles that you use in turkey noodle soup instead of elbows because that's all I had on hand.  I added about 2 TBSP of chopped garlic too.

My family said 4.5 stars but that wasn't an option so 5 stars it is. I used mini shell pasta and they loved it! I also didn't read the part that said to make the soup part first then add the pasta and then the hamburger just before serving. It simmered happily for about 45 minutes before I served it and everyone loved it!

Outstanding soup.  You would think it took hours to make.  Contrary to all the onion soup discussion, Lipton Onion soup is 2-1oz packages to a box.  I used both packages and it was spot on.  I didn't have celery, so I added some celery seed for flavor.  Next time I may sift out the dried onions though and just use real.  We will see if the dehydrated one soften up with time.

Thanks for a delicious, easy to make vegetable beef soup, Marge. My family really loves this! This recipe freezes well and tastes just as good, if not better when reheated.

Everyone liked this recipe. I didn't pay much attention to the onion soup quantity.  I used one package of Liptons Onion soup which was enough.  I also used 1 tablespoon of beef granules and only used 2 cups of water. I did use 4 cups also of the chicken broth. It looked runny at the beginning so I thought 2 cups of water would be enough.  I should have used all 4 cups of water.  I also used a can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce.  I was worried the soup would  have too much of an onion flavour but it didn't.  Even my picky 15 yr.old really liked it.  I browned the meat in a frying pan and then put everything in a slow cooker for 5 hours on high.  Added the macaroni the last hour.  Easy and cheap, served with dinner rolls.  Michele, Ontario, Canada

Very good-but the celery was still a bit too crunchy-sauteeing it first would make it perfect!  Also, instead of macaroni noodles use the small circular ones....!

Very good, followed the recipe and added some cubed potatoes and Italian seasoning. Also, did not add the macaroni to the soup, I don't like the noodles cooking in the soup, I cook them separately and add them in the bowl when I serve the soup.

Great, especially the next day.  I cut up sirloin in place of the hamburger.  I browned the sirloin and added the celery and onion with the steak while browning...then added the rest of the ingredients.

I did this in the crockpot and added my own personal touch but it is a good receipe and has endless possibilities. If you don't want to guess with the consistency then just use potatoes instead of the pasta and you know where you stand at all times. Thanks for a great way to use up some ground venison and in addition get a comfort food full of vitamins!

I made this last night made as is. And after the soup base simmered a short while I tasted it and to me it was bland. So I added more things. I  cooked the hamb with 3 cloves garlic, and the onion. I used beef broth not chicken. I added 4  dashes worcesterchire sauce a dash cayenne and a few dashes franks hot sauce and also  about a tbl chili sauce. Same as ketchup  but kicked up a  notch. I dont usually modify  first time making a recipe but it did need it. Great start base though can do many things with it. I also did not cook macaroni in  with soup, makes it to starchy in my opinion and this way  you can  add as much as you want, and when you reheat it mac wont be so soggy. And it soaks alot of liquid out of soup. I made  cornbread with this and it was good hearty meal. And leaving macaroni separate for left overs next day you can make rice to  add to  it. Thx for a good recipe

I added so many fresh vegetables to this - green beans, carrots, yellow squash, cabbage - that I  ended up using a can of beef broth AND a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce PLUS about a cup of water and had a much bigger pot of soup than I expected!  Cute little pipette pasta along with the beef made this a delicious and easy one-pot meal that I shared with the neighbors (my parents).  I thought the onion soup (1 pkg) just gave a nice subtle flavor to the broth, and some dried basil rounded out the seasoning without adding additional salt.  Save washing an extra skillet and brown the beef in a dutch oven, drain if necessary, then add all of the remaining ingredients and simmer at least 1 hour+ for the best flavor.

Tried this the other night.  The girls were not pleased with the appearance, but after they tasted it they decided that it will be one of their favorites.  I threw in a bag of frozen green beans, corn, carrots and peas.  What better way to sneak in those veggies!

I thought this recipie was excellent.  I altered it a tad and used 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cans of veggie broth, 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, 1/2 cup of pastina instead of the elbow mac and some Italian seansonings and followed the rest of the recipie as it was submitted.  I found this to be full of flavor and very filling. I will definitely be making this all winter.  It made about 8 servings.

Super easy and delicious!  My husband RAVED about this soup and told me to put it on the "rotation" which is his highest rating!  I didn't have mixed vegetables, so I added some frozen corn, frozen peas, and a can of butter beans.  This is a wonderful recipe!

Marc loved it. Instead of onion soup mix I made my own with 
8 teaspoons dried onion flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
This equals one ounce. Should be doubled for this recipe.

This soup was out of this world and so easy to make.  My grandmother always made this soup when I was young.  This tasted exactly like my grandmothers. Thank you very much.  I will make this again and again as the winter is approaching.

I thought it was pretty good, followed the recipe exactly until everything but the noodles were in the pot and realized I needed about 2 more cups broth so I added it and it came out really tasty!  Cook the noodles 'al dente' folks, they thicken up a ton after hanging out in the soup.  I will make this again on a cold evening.  ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Quick and easy and we really enjoyed this soup. I was a little leery with  2 packages of onion soup mix and onion but it came out wonderfully balanced. I served with homemade french bread and it was perfect! I definitely will make this again!

This soup is wonderful for several reasons - all ingredients were on hand plus it was fast and easy.  I substituted the chicken broth with beef broth and I cut the pasta down to 1/2 cup so it wouldn't absorb the entire broth.  I also only added 1/2 lb of minced meat as that was all I had.  Yummy!

Loved it it was easy to make. I did add garlic powder just because I put it in most things. I also put pepper in it after taste testing but not too much it has enough of a spice for the kids without adding very much. Will make again

Delicious soup!  I always add a bottle of V 8 juice instead of the tomato sauce.  Made a big batch yesterday for guests and everyone loved it!

This is a very good and hearty soup.  I followed instructions exactly.  Next time I will saute the onions with the ground beef to soften them up.  The onions still had a bit of a crunch even after cooking for 1/2 hour.

Delicious!  I added a can of mixed white/yellow corn, used ground turkey, left out the elbow macaroni and used 99% fat-free broth to make it a little lighter.  My daughter and I loved it!!!

I would use only 1 pkg. of onion soup next time as it was a bit too salty for me. Other than that it is a quick and easy soup!

very delicious especially with warm biscuits! I changed the recipe a bit to suit my tastes, and threw everything into the crockpot. Instead of 4 cups of water, I added 1 can of diced tomatoes and the leftover drippings from the browned ground beef. I also didn't have the extra package of dry onion soup mix, so I added some dry italian seasoning, beef bouillon cube (not an entire one necessarily, just to taste), onion powder, and olive oil, as well as about a teaspoon of tomato paste. It turned out great with lots of leftovers!

Great! Quick and easy to make. Good way to sneak veggies into my family. (Kinda heavy on sodium, but not sure how that can be helped.) I used ground turkey instead of beef and quinoa instead of pasta for diet reasons. Still a definite winner!

Mmmm...this was a really great, quick meal.  I didn't have onion soup, celery, or onions on hand, so I just threw in some fresh garlic and a can of stewed tomatoes along with the tomato sauce and frozen veggies.  I also added dried thyme, s & p, and a bay leaf.  It turned out fantastic!

pretty good basic recipe, but when i made it exactly by the recipe, it was a bit bland.  I added garlic salt and Italian seasonings to taste, and 1 tbsp of sugar and it was DELISH!!!!!! My 9 yr old dd loved it too!

Overall the recipe is okay, but I would definately make some modifications if I were to make again. We prefer a little thicker soup so I would reduce the water and add another can of tomato sauce or a can of diced or stewed tomatoes. Also, the broth is a little one dimensional  so I would add in some garlic and other seasoning when browning the beef.

The just made this recipe for the first time.  I made it almost exactly like the recipe, only using a few different herbs and spices that I had around the house and I doubled the recipe since it was for a potluck.  It thickened up just like some other commenters had said and had a great flavor.  I will make again, especially with the cold Wyoming winter approaching!

We live in Alaska and this has become a favorite during the winter. I substitute ground turkey for the hamburger and throw in whatever veggies we have on hand and the flavor is wonderful. Anything this good and easy that can make 3 kids and adults happy gets 5 stars!!

I so love this soup recipe!  I make it often and serve it with crusty buttered french rolls.  I throw in a couple of hearty dashes of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  Depending on what I have on hand, I sometimes use fresh veggies, sometime frozen.  If I don't have macaroni, I will dice up a potato to replace it.

I made the soup exactly as the recipe is written (except I used beef broth), and it was missing something.  It had a blandness, I experimented with several different ingredients in single serving bowls.  Garlic (esp fresh minced) does wonders, and so does (believe it or not) ketchup.  It must be the the sugar in the ketchup.  Next time I will add only 1/2 the onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the hamburger before it's browned.  I would not add any extra onion, and 2 pkgs of onion soup mix was fine- one would work though.  I think a can of kidney beans and or diced tomatoes would be a nice touch.  I did not care for the italian seasoning (made it taste like spaghetti sauce). The pasta does tend to overcook, I would add double the amount next time later on.  This recipe is a keeper!

We loved this soup- tasted even better the next day.  I used bow tie pasta and added canned tomatoes.  I also added garlic and some italian seasoning.  It really needs you to add your own seasoning to taste.  I also used canned vegetables- whatever your family will eat.

This is a very good, hearty soup!  My 2 yr old twins loved it!  What a great way to get them to eat their veggies.  I give it 4 stars because I did have to alter the recipe.  I agree with previous posts that the onion flavor is rather strong.  I added ketchup to tone it down.  

I used 1 envelope onion soup mix, 4 c water, 4 c chicken broth, 3/4 c noodles 1c fresh carrots, 2 celery stalks, 1 onion & 14.5 oz can stewed tomatoes, 1c frozen green beans & 1c frozen peas too.  I added 1/4 cup catsup to tone down onion flavor.  Cooked onion with beef, added 1/4 tsp pepper & garlic powder.

This soup is awesome! I used fresh veggies instead of frozen and didn't add the chopped onion. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes with spicy red pepper. I used a hand blender to get rid of the chunks and dumped it in! So good and it made it a little spicy.

This one wasn't a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly and checked the measurements of the onion soup twice.  I think that it reminded me of that diet cabbage soup that I ate too much of in high school, but with hamburger.

I have made this recipe a couple of times.  The first time it was a little too strong on the onion soup mix.  The second time, I doubled the recipe and used 3 packs instead of 4.  It was much better.  Great for freezing in bulk.  add the noodles to cook when you reheat it.  a keeper!!

I have to admit when i first read this, like others, i was a little leery of all the onions and the chicken broth, but after reading other reviews i stuck with the origional recipe. It is really good. The whole family liked it and there weren't any leftovers.  I think maybe next time i might try a few different spices, it seemed like it might need something to give it that little boost, but it is a great recipe and i will definately make many times again!

I was skeptical when I was cooking this, because the aroma was very onion-y (the soup mix powder has a strong aroma at first), but my worries were unfounded.  This soup was so incredibly good. I used little shell pasta and followed the recipe exactly.  This was so easy--so fast!  I couldn't believe how good it was for being such a quick, thrown-together soup.  This will be replacing my old veggie soup standby recipe, and we'll be eating it pretty regularly around here.  One note:  The recipe makes enough to feed an army, and I don't have an army in my house.  :)  I put the leftovers into freezer-safe plasticware and froze them.  A week later, I reheated some for lunch, and it was still delicious. It keeps in the freezer beautifully.

Quick, easy,inexpensive, and it tastes delicious! I used V-8 vegetable juice for my base intsead of tomato sauce-personal preference.

Very good and very fast.  The soup is healthy for you too.  I substituted hamburger for 93% lean ground sirlion.

This was pretty easy to make.  I only gave it 3 stars because my kids didn't like it. And I thought it was just ok.  I've had better vegetable soup.  My husband on the other hand had 3 bowls.   It did make alot more than 4 servings though.

Today was our first real cold snap here so I thought I'd make this at work for the guys who work in our maintenance shop. They loved it! Everyone had seconds! Plus the whole building smells wonderful! It was the perfect lunch for this cold & windy day.

I made a few changes and ended with a delicious soup. I always use ground turkey instead of beef in recipes. Instead of the tomato sauce I used seasoned diced tomatoes. I used 3 cups of water. I always start with less water than called for since one can always add more later if needed. One packet of onion soup mix is fine. Great recipe! May I recommend Minor's Soup Bases in place of broths. No waste. Minor's is used by restaurant chefs.

Yummy, wonderfully easy recipe, thank you!  However, after mixing all the ingredients in my stock pot, save for the ground beef, I brought it to a boil, let it simmer for around 30 minutes, added beef granules, thyme and chili powder to give it some backbone and thicken the soup.  I then added the beef and let it simmer another 45 minutes or so.  Really improved the consistency and flavor.  To say the least, there are more than four servings here but it's so tasty, that's a good thing.  Thanks again Marge!

We do put only a 1/2 of an onion in, and add some garlic and salt.  We use ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Anyone measured it to see how many cups?  I'm trying to get a calories per serving.

So good on a cold winter day. I did mine in the crockpot. Put in the onions, celery, used 3 red potatoes cubed and one sweet potato cubed, meat, onion soup mix, vegetables, tomato sauce, 2 cans of water and 2 cans of chicken broth. It was perfect after 8 hours on low. Made about 7 quarts. Served with Sister Shubert yeast rolls!! Perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly as given.  It wasn't disgusting but I didn't enjoy it.  The soup was lacking in flavor.  It needs extra spices of some kind.  It reminds me of canned soup.

I just realized this morning that I've never reviewed this recipe even though I've been making it for several years now. It's a fabulous recipe, a keeper, and one I make again and again. The first few times I made it, I used canned veggies instead of frozen (I'm not a big fan of 'frozen mixed veggies' - ick). But then I tried it with the frozen veggies and was surprised that they work just fine in this recipe! I do add fresh carrot though. I've tried other 'hamburger soups' on this website and this one is definitely my family's favorite.

I substituted spicy vegetable juice for water to give it more of a tomato flavor. I browned the beef with the onions and celery and seasoned the beef with Emerils essence and garlic before browning. The result was a delicious soup that my family loved. Served it with grilled cheese for a yummy winter supper.

This is a great recipe! My little one loves it. I use barley instead of pasta because I'm not really fond of pasta and use fresh veggies instead of frozen. I have made this recipe numerous times already and it is one of the few leftovers that my family seems to enjoy!!

I thought this was really good and so quick & easy that I'm giving it 5 stars! I changed it a bit because of what I had on hand . . . I chopped & sauteed onions, carrots, celery & frozen green beens in butter.  Then added the other soup ingredients.  I will definitely make this again and add corn, maybe also another type of bean.

This recipe was just okay. I didn't really dig having ground beef in a soup, it was kind of a weird texture to me. Quick and easy to throw together (and helped me get rid of some veggies and ground beef that I wanted to use up) but I wouldn't go out of my way to make this soup again.

I love several things about this recipe: 1. It's inexpensive and stretches very far. Maybe it's just me, but there are much more than four servings here. I have a large family, and there are always leftovers with this one. 2. It's healthy! This one's an easy way to get the kids to eat their vegetables. 3. It tastes great. I know it seems like too much onion when you first see the recipe, but I don't think it is--and I'm not much of an onion gal myself.

My family loved this soup! I changed the recipe some to accommodate our taste. I like a thicker soup so I added three cans of 8 oz. tomato sauce and two cans of diced tomatoes. instead of four cups of chicken broth/ and four cups water, I used a combo of 6: 2 as I didnt want it to be too watery. I also added three bay leaves and italian seasonings to the soup. I boiled the noodles separately and added them in the end with the meat sauteed with onions and green peppers. it was so good. will do again and again

This was so great! I agree with using beef brother instead of chicken.

I don't usually rate a recipe if I change something but I used a rather large onion so I only added 1 package of onion soup mix.  This was a very easy and good tasting soup.  Thanks Marge for the recipe.

Made this and we loved it. I used fresh carrots, string beans and onins which I sauteed first.  I then added the other ingredients and we all enjoyed it alot.  Make sure that you serve it right after the macaroni is cooked or it will get really soft.  Added basil to it and will add garlic for the next batch.  Have a little left over so I will add parmesan cheese to it to thicken it and put a swiss of gouda on top and bake it in the oven.  Why not.

I have been making this recipe for years and this is VERY good! Its great on crackers and shredded cheddar cheese is really good in the soup! I usually cook the onion with the hamburger and cook the frozen vegetables first before putting it in the pot. 

Thanks for sharing Marge! (:

this is a pretty good soup.  We prefer it with beef broth, not so much water and fresh veggies.  I have found that if I cook the pasta separately and just add some to each bowl it doesn't get mushy or thicken up the soup too much.  Just keep the leftover cooked pasta in a container in the fridge and reheat along with the soup.  Also added a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  Will make this again for sure

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and also substituted 98% fat free beef broth for the chicken broth. This was super easy and it's great to set on the heat while you wait for everybody to get home for dinner. I served with hot dinner rolls and it was a hit :)

wow can't say enough about this. super easy, really yummy and everyone loved it. I followed to a T. mostly. Next time, I may saute onions with meat, as I don't like them so crunchy. I did throw in a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I really like it and I am so picky. I had two bowls. Oh I added some garlic too.

This soup was pretty good, I only made it with 1 pack of onion soup mix, added some saute'd onion and garlic powder, and left out the macaroni all together because I don't like how soft and bloated macaroni can get in soup sometimes.  Served it to company, and everyone really liked it!

SUPER FAST! I have a sick family this week so was looking for something to warm their tummys and make them smile. Kids are 13 and 6 and they LOVED IT!! It was so fast, easy and just wonderful. Only thing I did different was season the meat with some stuff but everything else was the same. Its a keeper! Got it in my recipe box now. Thanks for Sharing!!

This soup is pretty tasty! I agree with those who commented that it needs some perking up, so next time I'll add some Italian seasonings. This is one of those recipes that tastes better and better after it sits for a few days and the flavors marinate.

Pretty good soup!  Especially on this cold, rainy day.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand:  I did not include an onion (although it would have been good with one).   I had no frozen veggies, just canned, so I put in a can of sliced carrots, a can of french cut green beans, and a can of corn.   I also added garlic, salt and pepper to the beef while browning and the soup itself while it was simmering.  I used 2 cups of macaroni instead of 3/4 cup.  It was good and easy to make and it was done so fast we were actually waiting on the biscuits to be able to eat.  :)

My husband was skeptical of how this would turn out and I was very wary of the the 2 packets of dry onion soup mix....however....it was very, very delicious!!  Don't be afraid to put them both in there! I followed the recipe except I did add potatoes (yum!) and since I didn't have anything frozen except corn I also added in fresh carrots and green beans that I had in the fridge along with the celery and onion the recipe calls for.

This is the easiest soup ever and taste great.  I followed it exactly.   My husband likes his soup like stew really thick and I don't - I like my soup like soup not stew so we are always bunting heads on this.  He looked in the pot and said what are you going to thicken this soup with I said nothing and he said I wont like it like that.  SO to appease the God in the house I cooked and added another 1 lb of hamburger because I refused to thicken it with starch.  It was great and he loved it.  I made biscuits with it and it was a meal for the 2 of us with lots leftover for the next day.

I made this for the first time and I have to say it was delicious.  I did add some wine and some herbs to give it a little bit of a kick but, other wise, I stuck to the recipe as is.  The entire family gobbled it up and asked for seconds.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful, EASY recipe :)

A good soup. I used alphabet noodles, frozen corn and frozen broccoli. It made so much that I froze half of it. I used a 2 oz. box of onion soup mix (2 1-oz. packages) and it was perfect.

An excellent hearty soup.  I concur with those who feel that one (1oz) pkg of onion soup mix is enough.  I made a few other adjustments based on what I had on hand: used fresh carrots, added about 1 cup of diced canned tomatoes, used diced potato rather than macaroni, used a handful each of frozen peas and corn towards the end, and finally, added a generous handful of freshly chopped parsley (and a spoon of dried basil) before serving.  Oh, yes, and a couple of minced garlic cloves when cooking the beef.  Makes a generous pot full (doesn't stop me from doubling it as it freezes well).

This was soooo easy and delicious. I even added a little more onion soup mix, as some suggested it was bland. I didn't add too much, but maybe another 2 tbsp. of onion soup mix. In my opinion this was great. I have had leftovers (rare for me) and it's still great. Totally, an easy lunch recipe or dinner and a sandwich. I've had it with a grilled cheese! Oh, and I also added some beans (I had leftover pintos and black beans so I added them, any would be a good addition)! Great addition if you are interested!

Really easy to make. Good flavor. My son loved it.  I must confess though I over cooked the noodles big time.  They were so soggy.  My bad.  Will do better next time.  Used a really lean ground beef too, so it's really a healthy meal.  I'm sure it'd be great with dear or turkey too.

Very good and very easy.  I used beef broth and 1/2 cup of barley instead of macaroni. (barley is high in fiber!).  I added some minced garlic, a bay leaf, thyme and pepper.  What a great soup.  I couldn't stop eating.

Just made this, and it smells and tastes AWESOME! If you are in Canada and can get some Epicure three onion soup mix, use it instead of the packages stuff (cuts down on salt).  I had never made hamburger soup before and this recipe is a keeper!  I added a can of diced tomatoes, juliened carrots, and a clove of garlic. And placed in slow cooker on warm for three hours before serving, oh YUM YUM YUM!!  Don't hesitate, MAKE THIS SOUP NOW!!!

Good and easy -- what could be better?  I think the recipe as is would have been just fine, but I used ground turkey instead of beef, added some frozen okra (it added an excellent flavor) and used some of my favored seasonings while browning the turkey.  A little bit of Crystal hot sauce was a nice finishing touch.  Great!

Definately better the second day.  Hubby and I both thought there was something missing.  I used generic label onion soup mix.  Maybe that was an issue.  When I make it again, I will use brand name soup mix, beef broth instead of chicken and I will add garlic.  All said, it's a keeper!

Very easy to make and my family really liked it. Perfect for a gray rainy day. I cooked the vegetables in the broth for about 10 minutes before adding the macaroni, and this was perfect for us. Served with excellent and healthy cornbread, also from this site, for a delicious and nutritu=ious Saturday night dinner. Thanks!

This was excellent!  I was worried that 4 servings wouldn't be enough for my family, but there was PLENTY (With lots of leftover)!!  I made the recipe to a T and it turned out fantastic.  (Actually, I did add a can of Kidney beans for some extra protein)  I will definatly serve this again! I served it with homemade Challah bread, applesauce and cottage cheese!!  Fantastic!

This was great! Just made it tonight. The kids didn't think they would like it when they looked at it, but once they tried it, they liked it! I only had one 1 oz. envelope of onion soup mix, but that seemed to be enough. Also, I didn't have tomato sauce, so I added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano. I used half of a large onion, and that was plenty. This is going in my "keeper" notebook.

I've made this at least twice a month since I found this recipe!  This is hands down my favorite recipe.  It's a quick tasty meal.  I make a big pot and eat off of it for a few days.   It's better than any fast food meal you can buy.  I struggle to eat food that doesn't come out of a bag, box or can, this helps a lot.  *** The only change I make:  add garlic and kidney beans ***

With a few modifications, I think this is a five star recipe.  First, I used half the amount of onion called for (which I thought was plenty) and about a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Also, I subbed beef broth for chicken and left out the celery (fiance doesn't like it).  And I just browned the beef with the onion and garlic, drained, and added the remaining ingredients to the same pot.

Sooooo gooood! I added a little extra macaroni since I only had a bit left in the bag and wanted to go ahead and use it. I cooked the onion and the celery in with the beef so it would be tender before adding it to the soup. My son thought this needed something for flavor but I thought it was okay. I only added a bit of cracked black pepper and some season all to the meat when browning it. This made a huge pot full and I was thinking it was for 4 but it made quite a bit more than that. Thanks, I'll use this recipe again, it was great.
UPDATE: I used dried celery flakes, a little dab of minced garlic, a 1/2 tsp of basil, 1 envelope of beefy onion and 1 of french onion, and a can of cream of tomato soup instead of sauce. My hubs raved over this version and gave it 10 stars!

The onion taste is too strong, but it comes from the fresh onion not the soup mix. Next time I will only use half an onion rather than a whole one. Other than that it's pretty good.

Made this in a crockpot. I added one entire package of onion mix but we like onion.   I put this on low for about 6 hrs, and added the noodles at the end.  This was was nice and hearty.  The recipe states that this is for 2 people.  Not the case at all.  I had enogh for an entire family of 5 - 6.  Well worth making again! Thanks for the recipe

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was very tasty, easy to make, and I had all the ingredients on hand. I did everything exactly as the recipe stated, except I always cook my noodles separately and store separately in the fridge.  This way, if there are leftovers, the noodles don't sit in the soup overnight and become mushy.

I was not too impressed with this soup.  Based on other reviews, I used beef broth instead of chicken.  Hunts tomato sauce with basil, garlic, oregano.  Sauteed 1 tsp minced garlic with the ground beef. Simmered the soup with the beef for 45 minutes before adding the macaroni and 1 can of kidney beans.  The soup was very salty (didn't add any additional salt) and flavor was just ok.  I much prefer the Hamburger Soup I from this site - I'll stick with that.

I made some revisions to this super yummy soup: instead of tomatoe sauce i used a 14.5 ounce can of stewed tomatoes, 1 can of tomatoe soup and only 2 cups of water. i used a 1.4 ounce pack of onion soup mix and about half an onion. I also only added 1 and a half stocks of celery, and i did not add my meat last thing i added it before i served to add flavour to the soup. I also added a little bit more meat.

This was awesome!  I doubled it thinking to feed my family of 6 + 2 extra kids the original 4 serving size wouldn't be enough but it would have been plenty..LOL We now can get another meal out of it though. Didn't have fresh veggies on hand so I used a can of corn, peas and green beans drained really well.

This was a great recipe.  I made a few changes just to fit my taste.  I followed the instuctions as given however I wanted a more tomatoe based stock.  I added a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of tomatoe paste.  I will certainly repeat this soup for my family.

This was a really versatile soup!  I doubled the recipe, used canned veggies and 1/2 cup more of the elbows.  I also used what I had on hand for the soup mix which was one box of onion and one box of beefy onion so I used both.  This is a fantastic soup for the cold winter ahead-I'll definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

To make this dish healthier, you could use ground turkey, ground chicken, or vegetable crumbles along with brown rice instead of any type of pasta, including whole wheat pasta.

We loved this! And everyone is right, it is even better as left overs. Next time I plan on making extra so I can freeze it for later. Yummy! Oh, and I didn't think the onion soup was too much at all. I wouldn't have even known it was in it.

Great starter recipe.  You can do so much with it and not mess it up!  I used ground turkey instead of hamburger.  My whole family really liked this recipe.

I really liked this soup-ALOT!  I had a pound of hamburger in the fridge and didnt know what I was going to do with it.  I was sick of the same ol same ol so..I ask for a suggestion and this recipe was the one that stood out.  This soup was SO easy, quick and delicious.  It reminded me of a soup my Mom makes which I never get to eat because I live to far away.  Anyways..the family loved it.  My son told me "That was Dang good Mom" so this will be added to the recipe box.  It is nice to try a soup that is a little lighter than the regular heavy, thicker soup (which I love on a cold winters day).  Next time I make it I am going to add some Summer Squash and maybe a little bit of Zucchini.  YUM!Definantly a keeper and worth a try for anyone who is questioning it.  TRY THE SOUP!

This soup was really good!  I sub'd veggie broth(all I had) and used canned whole tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I used fresh green beans and some frozen veggies.  This recipe can be made to anyones tastes!

This was good. Before I cooked, my wife complained she didn't want to eat it. By the time dinner was over,she ate 3 bowls! I added pepper and cajun seasoning, since we live in louisiana. We also ate this with corn bread as a side.

This recipe was so easy and quick.  It came out tasting like I have slaved over the stove all day making it.  I was tempted to use fresh veggies and add a can of diced tomatoes but I'm glad I followed the recipe to the tee.  Like some others have said I worried that the two packs of onion soup would be too much.  I will be making this again but in bigger batches cause there are no left overs.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Thank you so much for a easy and healthy meal.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't add the celery and onion because the mixed veggies I used included them ( it was a gumbo mix which was great ).  I also used alphabet noodles instead of elbow macaroni for my kids.  We all enjoyed it.  It wasn't a fancy gourmet meal, but it really hit the spot because we were all recovering from the flu.  I know we'll be making it often!

As my husband says, this soup is "Wicked Good." He's in the kitchen having seconds right now!

I added fresh carrot/potato, used a can of stewed tomatoes, a can of kidney beans, frozen peas/green beans and extra garlic while omitting the pasta.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can dress it up or down depending upon your tastes or what you have in the fridge. Very flexible and easy to make!

Really a great soup for a cold winter night, thanks so much for sharing it!

Excellent taste and very easy to make. It made a lot too. I did make some changes. I used 1.25 pounds of ground round which I browned with pepper and garlic powder. I added some frozen corn and a large diced redskin potato. Instead of macaroni, I used 3/4 of a cup of orzo noodles which worked out great. The soup was just a little salty. Next time, I am going to use 1 packet of low sodium onion soup mix and 1 packet of the regular onion soup mix.

This was soooo YUMMMY!!!!!  I did make a few changes only because I wanted more veggies.  I'm sure it would have been good without the changes, too.  I added cabbage, carrots, frozen peas, garden green beans, and a can of mixed veggies.  I would never have thought to try the onion soup mix.  It worked well.  I was a little afraid it would be too salty but it was perfect!  I would make one change.  I would omit the macaroni or make it separate and add to the bowls as we dish it up.  It was great the 1st day we ate it but the macaroni soaked up the soup and turned slimy.  I didn't care for that.  So, next time I will omit the macaroni would also allow me to freeze it for a busy day.  This is definitely going in my recipe box!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

This is a great basic soup recipe.  Love it and will definitely make again.  I did make a few changes... I omitted celery and onion (used just onion powder instead).  Also, used just one pouch of onion soup, and added 2 beef boullion (sp?) cubes.  Last, I added some garlic powder, worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper.

My husband's new favorite!  It makes a big pot and feeds my family of five for days.  It is very filling and tastes great with cornbread.  I used stir fry vegetables.  What a wonderful recipe.

I thought this was good with some changes. I doubled the recipe but did not double the liquid or the onion soup mix. I used 8 cups of beef broth instead of the chicken broth and water. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. We think it could have used a bit more seasoning also.

Like everyone else, I modified this to suit our tastes.  I used chicken stock in stead of broth, and also included the celery leaves.  I only used half an onion and (1) 2-oz. pkg. of onion soup mix.  Didn't have any frozen veggies on hand so I added a can each of corn, green beans, and rinsed kidney beans.  I also didn't have elbow macaroni, so I broke up some angel hair pasta.  In addition, I seasoned the beef with pepper, sea salt, and a bit of seasoned salt and did not drain it as there wasn't much fat.  I also added garlic powder and a bay leaf to the mixture as it boiled.

This is hearty and very quick and easy to make.  Tastes great with some buttered 7-grain bread.

Delicious! I used alphabet pasta instead of macaroni in an attempt to get the kids to eat it! It turned out great - the 1 year old loved it - but the 4 year old saw too many vegetables! This is a keeper!

I did not feel like hamburger in my soup and wanted only vegetables so I omitted the burger.  Added frozen and fresh veggies to my tasting.  Thanks for a great base of soup.  My only suggestion would be to add beef flavor instead of chicken if you plan on using the burger. I will try that next time.  This is a great comfort soup.

I made this for my husband when he had a cold and he loved it!  I really like it too.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used a bunch of onion powder and some italian seasonings.  It was great!

I gave this 3 stars because while it was pretty good, there was just something missing from it.  It was good for a quick dinner and I will probably make it again, but the next time I will follow some of the reviews. I would cut back on the amount of water, add some tomato paste and brown my beef with lots of garlic, maybe some herbs too.

Very good, easy soup. I went light on onion, using 1/2 fresh and only 1 oz soup mix.  Also, I only had frozen green beans to use but turned out great. Thanks.

Although I LOVE onions, my family is not as big a fan as I am, so I was a little leary to make this recipe as listed. Instead of 2 pkgs soup mix, I only added one. I only had beef broth so I used that instead. I browned the hamburger in half a chopped onion to cut down on the onion flavor. It turned out quite yummy, although I probably would season the hamburger a little in the future while browning.

Excellent recipe. I used 1 package of onion soup mix, added a cup of chicken broth (one less watter), changed to egg noodles, added red and green peppers (1 ea), Sauted the onions and added garlic with hamburger(added Worcestershire sauce too, just a splash).  Besides that, I didn't change a thing.  My wife loved it.

This soup was excellent.  Used 1 pkg onion soup mix-2 cans Swanson's veggie broth and a small spoonful of veggie "beef" broth.  Also used veggie crumbles in place of beef and added about 2 cups frozen hashbrown chunks.  My daughter loved it-said it was the best she ever had. My husband said it was a keeper.  Thanks!!!

I dont know how anyone could say this soup was bland! My kids loved it the adults loved it what more could you ask for? I tripled the recipe for a party. I did cut back a little on the onion soup mix and I only added half of the tomato sauce and added diced tomatoes and only half of the pasta.

I should have read the reviews before making this soup. Like stated 1 package of soup mix would have  been enough. My husband thought it was good. I'll not make it again.

What a great little soup recipe!  I followed the advice of past reviewers- used part beef broth and part chicken, used egg noodles instead of macaroni, omitted the onion, added worcestershire.  It was a little too salty for me, so next time I'll do potatoes instead of noodles.  I'll also use all beef broth.

Very good.  Makes more than 4 servings.  I left out the onions because it did not seem necessary with the soup mix.  Probably only needs one pkg of soup mix.  Yummy soup.  Husband loved it.

When I first discovered all recipes years and years ago. This was one of the very first recipes I tried. I absolutely love it! Still make it to this day! I also add in some cooked whole wheat rice and a couple potatoes as we like a thicker soup. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was awesome! It actually came out better than I had hoped. I had some vegetables to use and not a lot of time to cook so I through this all together, added the ground beef and then realized I did not have the macaroni noodles! I substituted fettuccini noodles cut into 1/3 pieces. I did not use too many as to not soak up too much water. I also could not get my second can of tomato sauce open, so I only used 8 ounces of sauce. It was delicious! My husband ate two bowls and my daughter had 3! There was enough for my lunch and it is wonderful! I will do this one again.

I made this tonight and planned on eating it the rest of the weekend and into the week, I tripled the recipe. I had  a house full of 17 year old boys all over for video game tournaments and within an hour the entire pot was gone, lol. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

SOOOO good and super easy!  I used very lean ground beef and it was a great healthy meal.  This will be one of my family favorites for winter!  I followed the recipe exactly but garnished with shredded cheddar and sour cream which made it fantastic!  Would be suitable for guests.

Easy and tasty. I only had one envelope of onion dip to use, used whatever frozen veggies I had and it tasted great. A good meal for a cool night when you don't have a clue what to make.

OMG!  This is totally awesome soup!  The flavor is just spot on for comfort food.  Goes perfect with a fresh garden salad and a glass of white wine.  I will definitely be making this one a new staple soup in my household!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I was looking for a different, very quick way to use up some ground beef in the crock pot, and came across this recipe. I always try to make a recipe as written the first time, and add to it the next try according to our tastes...this is such a simple recipe, but to my surprise, the hubs completely adored it just as written! He usually likes his food very spicy. I did double the recipe...so I had 8 servings. Hubs ate 3 servings by himself that night for supper...I had one. Packed the other 4 servings the next day for his lunch, thinking he would share with his co-workers...he sheepishly admitted to me he ate it all himself! And says it tasted even better the 2nd day! I had plans to make it again in a couple of weeks with beef broth instead chicken broth, and array of herbs and spices...but I have been asked to put it in our weekly rotation and not change a thing! Thanks do much for such a delicious, simple recipe!

It was good! Everyone, including the picky eaters in my family, liked it. I substituted potatoes for the pasta.  Personally, I would have preferred some spice in it, but I solved that by adding some siracha in my bowl.

So simple and yet so good!  To make it even easier, I used frozen onions.   If you don't have mixed vegetables on hand, use whatever vegetables you do have (I used equal parts frozen corn, frozen peas and canned green beans).  If you don't have celery or don't care for celery you won't miss it in this recipe.

It was worth 5 star's after spicing it up a little. First I used fresh veggies 2 potatoes, 1 onion, 2 stalks of celery, carrots, green beans, and some frozen peas. I also added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce, a tablespoon Natures Seasoning, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, dash of crushed red pepper, dash of cumin, a pinch of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of onion powder, some sea salt, a bay leaf, 2 chicken bullion cubes, and 4 more cups of water. Next time I think that I'll add a can of corn. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and simple to make on the stove or throw it all in the crockpot. Used ground beef and Italian sausage. I didn't have any macaroni so I used rotini noodles. I didn't have any tomato sauce so used V8. All in all this was good. A definite keeper!

I changed the recipe slightly based on earlier reviews.  I used 3 cups of beef broth with 3 cups of water, added a can of black beans, a bag of frozen green beans and only one envelope of the onion soup mix.  It was perfect and made six generous servings.

Great soup for a chilly night!  I used 1.5 lbs of ground turkey, browned with a little Worcestershire.  Used beef bouillon and water and 1 package of onion soup mix.  Used 1 bag frozen mire poix (celery, onions, carrots) and a half bag of frozen green beans.  Used 1 cup dry elbows, but would probably like a bit more, (with more water/broth).
Husband loved it, kids ate their veggies without complaint.  Plenty of leftovers after dinner for 4.

ONLY put 1 envelope of soup mix!  I made the mistake and put two and it was ton oniony!  Otherwise it was good.  I wanted a little thicker so added a can of tomato & basil soup.  Served with a little grated cheese on top.

I just made this and it is so yummy.  I sauted the onions and celery before adding to the broth.  I used fresh veggies instead of frozen.  I also added more noodles and water since I love a heartier soup.  Finally, instead of tomato paste, I added diced tomatoes with chili peppers.  Added a very nice zestiness to the soup.

Added beef broth instead of chicken broth. Added onion and garlic powder for more zing. Yummy......my family asked why I'd never made this before. Good easy recipe for a home cooked meal.

i did not use pasta, instead i used spaghetti squash.  i like my soup to have a beef base. so i sometimes use one pkg of onion soup mix and some beef bouillion. both are good.

I thought the recipe was great! I added a can of rotel to spice it up . Did not use the onion. On my second batch I added cream cheese which gave it a great flavor.

We tried it tonight and loved it!  I was out of some of the items so I changed it a little.  I used an 8 oz tomato sauce, 14 oz diced tomato can, one can of chicken broth, and one can of beef broth.  I had no celery so I added a can of corn, a can of Vegall, and I changed my noodles to colored spirals.  I used one dry onion soup mix and one dry onion mushroom soup, just because.  It was wonderful.  Next time I will add a cup and a half of noodles though.

added garlic granulated and salt and pepper while the hamburger cooked everyone liked it for its hearty simple flavors, thank you for sharing. 2nd time around I opted to not use water and used a large can of tomatoe juice. much better.

This was quick and easy.  I changed the amount of liquid to 3 cans of chicken broth and one can of V8 juice in place of the tomato sauce.  Also added a dash of tobasco and a tablespoonful of Better than Boullion chicken.  This made quite a lot and after adding the pasta it need a bit more liquid at the end.  Just added a little more water.

We really enjoyed this soup.  I did make it in the crock pot, and cooked the macaroni separate, and added to soup just before serving.  My frozen mixed vegatables came in 12 OZ packages, so I used 2 bags, which was perfect. Smelled very oniony when cooking, but did not taste overly oniony.  Will definately make again!!

I follow this recipe almost exactly. I use beef broth instead of chicken and i use more of it than the water. My husband and i like our soup on the onion side so i actually add 2 lipton onion soup packets. i also add some yukon potatoes. I sauté the onion and celery in the soup pot and i brown the beef with garlic. i throw everything in the pot at the same time except the pasta. i cook that on the side and add it to the soup the last 5 minutes of simmering. we absolutely love this soup. to make it extra awesome, add some grated parm cheese to the top of your bowl and mix it in. so good.

Very good comfort food. I used a couple of small red potatoes instead of pasta - Hearty enough for dinner. I also froze some in individual portion sizes for quick lunches.

This recipe is great! I add a couple of drops of Tabasco sauce to give it a little kick and trust me it makes a huge difference. This recipe is a fall/winter staple. It's inexpensive to make, quick and easy! My family loves this soup.

Delicious!  I didn't have macaroni on hand so I used barley as a substitute and it was delicious.  Reminded me of beef and barley.  I also threw in some frozen corn instead of the frozen mixed veggies.  Yum!

Family loved it! Used egg noodles, and a few more than it calls for to make a hearty meal.  Used ground venison instead of ground beef.  It was quick and easy, and a delicious way to clean out the freezer! I will definitely make it again.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I prefer chicken meals over beef.

I liked it!  But I did use the suggestions like garlic powder, Italian seasoning and one package of onion soup (might try both next time)... then I added two cans of stewed tomatoes a can of past and a can of sauce, because I only had a small can of sauce.  I also put 2lbs of hamburger in it and 3  cups of veggies (1  cup of each of corn, green beans and carrots). It was almost like a stew instead...

I was so excited to try this recipe especially since I read such positive reviews. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I guess I was expecting more of a tomato based flavor but that's not what I got at all. It wasn't nasty by no means but, it wasn't something to brag about. Maybe my expectations were too high. I won't be saving this recipe.

This soup was very very good. I did tweak it a bit, by using fresh veggies and a bit more spice..Overall it was great. It was also excellent the next day! My family was quite satisfied..definitely a keeper. I served it with a crusty Italian bread with sharp cheese slices.

Grapes of Wrath must have inspired this soup recipe.  Not a haunting flavor but still nice from time to time.  Needs a little more punch to make it a regular.

Quick and easy but way too bland. Four cups of broth and four cups of water is too much.

I never review anything but this is so good I had to take the time to say that this is soooo yummy!! I'm not a big fan of leftovers but this is great leftover!! Didn't make any changes at all. Like another reviewer said, don't stray from the recipe so it stays a soup. Yumm.

This was nothing special....a little bland and too much of a 'onion soup mix' taste in the background.  Probably will not make again.

While this was okay, it was way too tomato for my taste. I think I would like it better with just chopped tomatoes!

I have been making this soup for year and it has always been a comfort food. I learned it from my Mom. The only difference I make is using beef broth instead of chicken.

Yum! Yum! Yum! I think I'm addicted! 
My added fling- fried meat(ground pork) with garlic, onion and chili flakes. I used beef broth since I used ground pork. 
Next day left overs taste even better! I like the fact that since we add dry onion soup mix (low sodium), no extra salt was needed. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty. Very easy. I even screwed up the directions by adding the meat before cooking the noodles and this still turned out really well. I cut down the amount of water to maybe 3 cups and I ended up adding some salt and pepper.

This was great! But I did add a few extras. I used ground turkey. Browned with onions and garlic. 1 pkg of onion soup mix(from a box of 2- 1ounce pkts). Added a little italian seasoning and black pepper and a little bit of every kind of veggie in my freezer :) Mixed, green beans, corn and okra(yum!) The okra made it awesome-if you like it! :) Also, subbed one can of kidney beans(rinsed) for the macaroni. Turned out great!

This recipe is phenomenal.i did not have enough chicken broth so i used the one can that i did have 6 cups of water and 2 beef bouillon cubes. No frozen mixed veggies but did add a can of mixed veggies w/o the water and threw in some badly freezer burned frozen corn (with the ice that was stuck to it) ,some extra fresh baby carrots and followed the rest of the recipe pretty much as instructed. Will make over and over. Thanks.

Great recipe. I used a leek instead of an onion and orzo pasta instead of elbow mac, only because that's what I had in the house. Oh and I used fresh carrots as well. I will be making this again!

yummy...tried this with 2 x the frozen veg, no celery, and half an onion. Also, only used 1 pouch of onion soup mix to cut the salt.

Family loved this. I used beef broth instead of chicken. Added canned potatoes (diced). Spiced it up w/ Louisiana hot sauce & garlic. Next time I might go to the trouble of making noodles seperately & adding at the last minute because they did get slightly limp. I am sure this was due to me simmering the soup too long, but I felt it was necessary to "lock in" the flavor.

Made everything in one pot.  Sauteed onions and celery in a stock pot, browned ground beef and drained off fat.  Returned to pot, added one can green beans,one can diced tomatoes, one can mushrooms(all 15 oz.)  Added one pkg. onion soup mix and 2 cups beef broth.  I also brushed slices of french baguette with olive oil and parsely and broiled until golden.  Served soup with 2 slices of baguette on top. Very good.

I made it to a T except added in some cut up carrots too b/c I had some to get rid of and I added garbanzo beans too. I think next time I'll use less water b/c I ended up adding tomato paste to thicken it.

This is delicious, I tried it for the first time and am making again tonight. it is super easy to make and the family loves it. I omitted the onion as my daughter doesn't eat them and I thought the onion soup miss would be enough, and i could trick her with that. It was and i did :). I also used one pack of the onion soup mix instead of two and it was perfect. We do not like our foods overly seasoned. instead of elbow, i used cellantani - it made for a much more heartier soup. Again, easy to make and delicious.

Excellent!!!!!!! Quick and Easy to throw together when you get home from work.  I changed up and added chunks of cooked potatoes instead of pasta and the family loved it.

did not like at all. There is no way this is 4 servings. This makes a much, much larger batch. The taste was very salty. I was skeptical about using 2 pkgs of onion soup mix but, followed the recipe exactly.

This was excellent!  I had been searching for a new veg soup recipe since hubby didn't care for the one I'd been using.  He gobbled this one up!  It's SO easy, and the only thing I did differently was use 1 packet of the onion soup mix ( to cut down on salt), use 1 less cup of water, and use about a cup of barley instead of macaroni.  The tast of this soup is fabulous..it's a keeper for sure!

Well, I am sure this is very good after reading the reviews and by just looking at the photo. I made it yesterday and must have done something very wrong. It turned out the consistency of a very thick stew, not a soup. I will try again..... :)

Delicious. I sauteed the onion with the beef, added whatever fresh veggies I had (mushrooms, green beans, carrots), used two, 1oz envelopes of onion soup mix and a few splashes of worcestershire. I also grated fresh romano at the end 'cause I love the stuff. Instead of adding the pasta into the soup (reviewers called it mushy), I cooked it and will keep it separate, adding it to the soup each time it's reheated. A winner!

Hubby wanted veggie soup, which is how I stumbled across this recipe.  I don't think I would have noticed it otherwise as I am *NOT* a vegetable soup fan.  That said, I really liked this soup!!  Hubby liked it too, and we even got our toddler to eat some.  I usually make a recipe as stated the first time, but since we had some cabbage to use up, I tossed it in.  We will be making this recipe again!

I followed this one for the most part (only change is I used left over spag. sauce in place of reg. tom. sauce). After it was completed...I found it needed a little something so I threw in some seasonings....Now its more to my liking! Very good

Wonderful! My 15 yr olds new favorite dinner. Made as recipe stated the first time, very good. The second time I browned the onion with the hamburger & threw in some minced garlic. Used one packet Beefy Onion, & one packet Onion Mushroom dry soup. A new favorite, and so easy. Thanks so much!

Excellent basic recipe.  I did make several changes to use what I had on hand rather than run to the store.  I didn't have broth or onion soup mix, but I save any water that I used to steam veggies or drippings from roasting or sauting meat.  I pulled those out of the freezer and used them instead of broth.  I didn't have tomato sauce, but used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead.  I also added fresh carrots.  The only issue I had is that the celery and carrots were still pretty crunchy when the pasta was done.  Next time I'll add the pasta a little later so that the veggies can cook more.  Very tasty!  I'll try to make sure I have all the ingredients to make the recipe as it's written the next time.

I changed it a little but it turned out really good! I put fresh carrots, cauliflower, 1/2 jalapeno, 1 can of green beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 Lg can of whole tomatoes and chopped the tomatoes before adding, when cooking the (97/3) hamburger I added garlic salt and minced onion, omitted the noodles altogether and used more chicken broth low sodium than water.

Easy for sure. Made my own chicken broth and no onion soup mix as we are watching salt intake. Used tomato paste, italian seasoning & chili powder along with fresh carrots, cauliflower, onion and frozen veges. Very tasy.

4 stars for ease, but it was kind of salty. Followed recipe; maybe try less broth and more water... Made again w/ half the amount of broth called for and more water - much better

This soup is soo delicious and easy. I use ground turkey or chicken to cut the calories and it is still fantastic. My fiance is very picky and he usually finishes the entire pot the same night I cook it.

I am pleased with this soup. I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables that had corn, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, celery and lima beans, so I did not have to do any chopping :) I added a few dashes of worcheschire sauce and a pinch of sugar and increased the amt of noodles to 1 cup. The only negative was that it was a little bit salty, so I will use reduced sodium chicken broth next time. I also want to try adding a can of tomato soup for a little more sweetness next time. Overall, very good recipe that I would recommend!

I needed something quick and easy and hearty to eat for dinner last night, and this was perfect! I cleaned out my fridge, freezer and pantry by making this. It's a great thing to make when you haven't been to the store in awhile, and you can add nearly anything to it. Mine turned out as more of a stew or goulash because I didn't have broth. It was still delicious! I'm having it again today for lunch.

Good flavor, easy to make.  It more like a goulash the next day because of the pasta...could add some broth to make it more like soup, but still good.

A great sick meal!  this soup is really good. The only changes I made were out of necessity.  I used beef  broth, 1 onion soup mix, and no celery.  We both really liked it.  It's going in the recipe box! Thank you!

Very good soup, through together in a hurry. Didn't have celery or mixed vegetables so I cut up carrots and potatoes added part of can of corn and can of green beans and used rotini noodles. Thought it might be too much onion but comes out just right. Would definately make again.

This soup was good but seemed to be missing something for me.  As mentioned by other reviews, I would only use 1 pack of onion soup mix.  Also as others have stated that it lacked a tomato flavor, to help this, I used tomato juice instead of water and that seemed to help.

Really quite good.  I second everyone who said they were apprehensive about all of the onion because I was. After I had already done so, I realized I had added the two larger onion soup packs and worried.  But no worries -- NOT too onion-ly.  I did brown the chopped onion because my husband HATES to find crunchy onion in anything.  Other than that, the only change was that I added about a cup on quinoa to the soup to up the nutritional value.  It was really good, my kids liked it too.  I did find that after stored in the frige the broth got soaked up and the soup became more stewish, but still good.  My husband added some hot sauce to his, but I found it hearty and flavorful.  Great way to get the veggies in everyone!

This tasted really good for a family full of sickly people. Easy to prepare and didn't upset anyone's stomach. Served with "Toasted Garlic Bread" and romaine lettuce/spinach salad using "Batman's Best Caesar Dressing."

I wasn't a big fan.  It had an overpowering onion soup taste.  Also too salty.  Probably should have used low sodium broth.  It was ok, but I wouldn't make it again.

Good quick and easy soup.  My whole family enjoyed it.  A good way to get some veggies in.  I listened to other reviewers and only used 1 onion soup packet.  The only negative I have to mention is that the recipe should have included pepper.  It definitely lacks flavor without it.

This was excellent!  I doubled the macaroni, veggies, tomato sauce and then added a little bit of instant mashed potatoes and it turned out great!  A little more like stew than soup how the family prefers. Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks Marge! I had doubts but wanted to make something different. Nice surprise. I will make it exactly as stated next time but only had beef broth and fresh vegetables from the garden on hand. Pitched in potatoes, grn beans, carrots, zucchini, corn, peas,etc. Other than that I made it on the stove and followed directions.  My onion soup package was 2 1/2 ounces so thanks to the reviewers who mentioned the difference in package sizes.  I used only 2 ounces and added the a medium onion and the flavor was Hmmmm good. Not strong at all. Agree about cooking on the stove.   My cooking time was only about 20 or 25 minutes, so maybe pass on the slow cooker.    Also,try some homemade croutons on top.  Toss cubed sourdough bread(or other)in olive oil and parm. cheese.    Toast cubes in toaster oven.  My doubting husband ate 2 big bowls.   Looking forward to the leftovers.  It's a keeper and will make a double batch next time to freeze for a rainy day.

Ingredient changes: I added a diced potato, 1 package onion mix, no onion, green beans, corn, peas. Also added sliced sausage which gave a small kick.  Unfortunately I didn't have tomatoes sauce so I added a can of diced tomatoes and cornstarch too to thicken a bit.   I didn't add rice or pasta because of the carbs.

I thought this was really good, cheap, and easy, but I would cut down the onion soup mix to one packet.  The taste of onion really takes over, and I feel like the onion flavor should be more subtle.  Other than that it was great.  Also, it serves more than 4, which is always a relief when you've got a large family!

As it's written, I would give it no stars because the onion soup mix has MSG in it, which gives me a wicked migraine! So I had to modify it a bit, but my husband and I give the resulting soup 5 stars. My kids are insane and didn't like it, which is weird (they aren't that picky).  I doubled the recipe (6 of us), and used 2 lbs ground beef, 4 cups chicken and 4 cups beef broth, and 8 cups water, 2 T of dried minced onion and 2 tsp onion powder (which I mixed into the ground beef while it was browning), 4-8oz cans tomato sauce, 4 stalks celery, a bag of stir fry veggies (it's all I had), and tri-colored rotini pasta.   Once it was cooked, we added lots of shredded cheese. It has an excellent flavor! I have no doubt the original recipe tastes good too, but I'm not going to risk a migraine to find out. I'm going to use "normal" veggies next time and see if they kids like it better (I doubt it'll change the flavor much, just look more normal to them!).

My family enjoyed this a lot! But can anyone tell me how to save this so that the noodles don't soak up all the broth? That is my only prob. After sitting the soup turned into a goulash- with added vegetables. ?? suggestions

Very delicious and healthy soup!  I only changed a few things.  My family likes chunky soups, so I only added 2 cups of water.  Also, I added more veggies than the recipe calls for, about 5 cups frozen and double the celery.  Lastly, I added a can of drained chili beans. My three year old had seconds!

Mmm mmm mmm.  Just finished this meal and didn't want to stop!  My husband loved it too and our children (2 and 4 y/o) enjoyed it I think.  I only used one packet of onion soup mix and 1/2 onion since that is all that I had on hand, so I added a little bit more frozen peas/carrots, noodles, and a tablespoon or so of garlic powder.  Just delicious!

Indeed a quick recipe, but both my husband and I thought it tasted too "processed".  My husband commented that it tasted like it was made using Campbells veggie soup mix.  Although more time consuming, we're going to stick with fresh veggie recipes.

Really good flavor. I did let mine simmer for a few hours. I added a some minced garlic to the meat, and Italian seasoning, and a bay leaf to the soup. I then added my macaroni about a half hour before I ate it.  Also, please note that the recipe calls for 2 (1 oz)packages of onion soup, and are sold in 2 (2.5 oz) packages at least the ones I bought. As noted by another reviewer.

Excellent soup just a little to much salt. To solve that added only one pack of soup mix.

I made this while my husband was out of town since we don't exactly agree on ingredients for soups and stews (plus he doesn't like soup period!) and I figured what I didn't eat, I would freeze, but I ate all of it!! I used a frozen vegetable mix that had all the required ingredients plus lima beans and etc (it had the celery in it too). It was the best! The only thing I goofed up on was I slow cooked it (which was great) but I put the elbow macaroni in too soon and the noodles were very soggy (my fault), the next time I make it, I might just put rice in instead. Great recipe though!

My family really liked this soup. I only gave 4 stars though because I had to modify it a bit. Fresh and canned veggies instead of frozen. I substituted 1 cup of beef broth for 1 of the cups of chicken broth. I also seasoned the ground beef with fresh garlic and italian seasoning. I expect it to be even better tomorrow.

I'm giving this recipe a neutral rating since it's just beginning to simmer in my crockpot.  My question/concern is the quantity. This recipe serves four (4) ???  Because I'm bringing this to share at our "souper supper," I added another half recipe, so it should serve 6, right? My very large cooker is almost full to the brim and I have yet to add the beef. It will surely feed a crowd of 15 or 20!  Is there an error on the number of servings?  I will come back with a true rating after our "souper supper"--sure smells good, though!

Family loved this soup. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Added more pasta and added more veggies. I cooked the hamburger with garlic. I think it needed a little bit more flavor maybe will add some salt and pepper next time. Tasted great the next day. This is a great base recipe that you can do so much with. Loved how fast it was to put together. Great weekday meal when you are in a hurry.

I made this recipe just as it said. It turned out pretty good. My husband loved it. I thought it was pretty good. The flavors in the soup were delicious. My only problem was the beef had a funny texture and I think it is just because I bought the beef with the lowest fat.

Such an easy recipe and so delicious!!! I used beef broth and everybody I've gave the recipe to has just loved it. Even my picky grandkids loved it!!! Good way to get them to eat vegetables.

Very nice soup for a cold winter's night. Didn't change anything. Only problem was that my pot wasn't large enough for the soup - had to remove some of the liquid prior to serving. Great leftovers to take to work!

This is more of a hearty stew type meal!  I used frozen italian vegetables and added a can of diced tomatoes. 
Very tasty.

This was awesome stuff! It was a bit on the salty side but other than that, it was amazing! I added a few more macaroni noodles and a small can of tomato juice for some extra juice. The longer you let it simmer, the better it tastes.. can't wait to eat it for leftovers tonight!

This we a pretty good recipe that was quick but it was lacking a little flavor. I'm not sure what it's missing but something. Everyone enjoyed it though and we will make this again. I'll try fresh veggies next time. Thanks

I added 1/2 pkg of dry onion soup mix and 1 pkg of savory herb and garlic dry soup mix.  I added potatoes instead of pasta and used canned veggies instead of frozen.  I also used a left over roast, cut into cubes instead of hamburger.  After tasting while cooking, I added a little minced onion and garlic salt.  It still needed a little zip when I served it, so I'll add something extra next time.  But I will make this again. It makes quite a bit, so lunches will be ready for next week.

A good solid recipe, I did change/add a few (which I don't think impacted the recipe one way or another). Only used 1/2 an onion, added a good amount of Italian seasoning and some garlic. I think I would add more pasta (I used rotini) next time maybe. I'd make it again but I it could be better.

I made this last week for my husband and grandmother and both couldn't stop raving about it.  I did use canned vegetables instead of frozen and I added some cabbage.  A keeper for sure.

This soup was good.  I do believe the sodium could be lowered by using low sodium broth and less of the soup mix. The fat also could be lowered by using lean meats such as turkey or ground chicken. Overall, very tasty.

If I could I would give this 4 1/2 stars.  It is a very good basic recipe, but I did make some changes.  I used 4 cups beef broth, 3 cups water and a can of V8 juice. I also added a can of diced tomatoes along with the frozen mix.  I
cooked the onion and celery with the hamburger and didn't wait until the end to add,  I let it simmer with everything else.  I added some garlic powder, cajun seasoning, and cumin.  Left out the pasta.  Very good and it makes meals for days!  Oh and if you used 2 packets of dry onion soup you don't need to add salt!!

You have to really like the Lipton Onion Mix to make this.  I am not a big fan of the mix, but I like vegetable soups and this soup had great reviews.  This soup (using fresh, not frozen vegetables) tastes just like the Onion mix.  I guess there are people out there who love this, but not my family.  When my son came home he asked if it will taste like it smells which he thought was horrible.  If it wouldn't set such a bad example for the kids I would just throw it out.

This was hands down the best version of hamburger soup I've ever tasted! It was SOOO easy and quick to make. Love the part about adding frozen veggies. It's nice to not spend so much time preparing a meal. The flavors were a hit. The only thing I added was some onion powder, black pepper and along with the canned chicken broth I added 1 chicken boullion cube. To make it more rich. Wonderful! Thank you

This is a very quick and easy recipe.  My children, ages 11, 15 and 16, LOVE this soup.  I make extra and freeze a container for another night.  I normally am not a fan of frozen veggies (fresh is best) but they taste wonderful in this soup.  Try it, you won't be sorry  :-)

GREAT recipe. The only changes I made were to replace 2 cups of water with more beef broth.  I also sauteed the onions and celery first before adding to the pot and then cooked the beef in the same pan. FYI, recipe calls for 2oz of onion soup mix so check with your box to use the proper amount. At first, it seems to dominate the soup but after simmering for a while, the onion soup flavor mellows out and the soup is yum!!

This was ok to me, it still felt like it was missing something.  I don't like a whole lot of onion, so I only used a half pkg of onion soup mix and no onion. I think I'll add a bit more tomato sauce, maybe add some cabbage and potatoes and minus the macaroni, and let it simmer a bit longer and keep covered to keep all the flavor in the soup.  My boyfriend like it.  I still ate it and willing to give it another shot with the above additives.

This is soooo good.  I didn't think it was all that, but after I made it a first time and I started craving it, I knew it was good.  I've made it a few times, once I forgot to add the onion soup mix - it was still good, but it was missing something (hmmm, I wonder what it was :-).  I don't usually have tomato sauce on hand, but I always have cans of V8, so that's what I used.  It's kind of salty, so if you have low sodium broth that would help, but it's soooo tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was Ok, but nothing I'll be making again. My husband liked it better than I did. If I were to make it again, I would double the veggies and maybe add more macaroni, but I didn't care for the taste enough to even try it again.

Quick, tasty, and super easy recipe. I had everything on hand other than the frozen veggies. I added some cabbage, carrots, canned green beans, and some leftover asparagus. This was so good and the kids wolfed it down. Will keep this recipe on hand. THANKS

I found this recipe to be very simple, and therefore very quick to make! The soup tasted much better the day after, so this is perfect for leftovers. I did everything according to recipe, except I used ground turkey instead of beef, and boiled the ground turkey with everything else after browning it a little bit.

Even though I liked the idea, I didn't like the soup itself. I made some changes. Instead of ground beef, I used 1 lb. of stew beef cut into bite-sized pieces. Dredged in flour and browned on high heat for about 10 minutes, then added the onion and celery and cooked another 10 minutes. I omitted the onion soup mix and used a 26 oz. can of tomatoes with basil and garlic added. I replaced the water and chicken broth with with 4 cans of beef broth and it was plenty of liquid. Used the amount of frozen veggies in the recipe and simmered for about an hour to be sure the beef became tender. Salted and peppered to taste and it was great. The flour on the beef also created a better texture for the soup.

We really enjoyed this.  Note to self: Used fresh carrots and potatoes and left out macaroni, used a can of Goya mixed veggies instead of frozen and added about a tablespoon of beef better than bouillon paste.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Last night after it was made, it was a bit overpowering from the dry onion soup and I did not think it was great.  Edible, but probably wouldn't make often.  I am having it for lunch and it is so much better.  Maybe it just needed time for the hamburger and everything to just blend together.  This is a great lunch and I will definitly make this for freezed lunches again.

I love this recipe because I have finally found a delicious and quick way to use all my left-over vegies that I keep stored in an airtight container until full. My vegie mixture is not always the same, but regardless, it's delicious and my family loves it!

This turned out great! Although I changed up the veggies to suit what I had on hand (no onion & no celery) only frozen peas/carrots and a can of whole kernel corn, drained. I added a few spices and upped the pasta. We ate half and I froze the other half. It may have been a little bland without the additional spices. Thanks for a great recipe! Oh and if you have kids, I'm sure they will like this one.

This soup is quick and easy to make. I browned the meat & onions and set it aside to drain. I then used the same pot to cook the veggies & pasta in the broth.

Really good!  I made the soup the night before without the noodles or ground beef.  I was a bit worried b/c the soup tasted VERY oniony from the soup mix but after adding the ground beef and noodles, it all worked together.  Everyone really enjoyed this easy recipe.

This was pretty good; however, if I make it again, I'll reduce the amount of broth by a cup and add a large can of tomato sauce. It was just tooooo beefy tasting - not enough contrast in flavor I think.

Yummmm! My DH raved about this one (he even used the word "fabulous")! Alterations I made: Ground Chicken instead of beef, no tomato sauce, and diced red potatoes instead of elbow macaroni. Great paired with E-Z Drop Biscuits!

I gave this a 3 because I thought that it was rather blaa. I thought that it might have had a better taste in it because of the dry onion soup. I also was hoping that it would have been a good crock pot meal and it wasn't. The noodles became over cooked and stuck to the bottom. Othe then that I am planning on making it again this time stove top and adding some seasoning myself.

Awesome basic soup recipe.  I used condensed tomato soup in place of the tomato sauce and added a ton of vegetables (didn't really measure).  I also did a quick online search for onion soup mix and made a sodium-free version that tasted just as good, if not better.  Finally, I substituted potatoes for the noodles.  So perfect for a wintry day!

I don't usually write reviews. I had to on this soup. It is the best vegetable soup I have ever had. My Children all ate it and asked for more. It is going to be made on a regular basis in my home. I used fresh vegetables. It was so good and easy. I love it.

We thought that this was good. I did add a dash or two of worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. But next time I will try using a couple cloves of garlic and some cayenne instead. I agree with some that putting the pasta to the side would be better so that it doesn't soak up a lot of liquid and become mushy.

This soup was surprisingly good.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used vegetable soup mix and I omitted the celery.  I used spiral pasta which I think absorbed a little too much liquid.  I would definitely make this again a quick and easy kid friendly dish.

Very good soup. I doubled the recipe and didn't realize how much soup it makes. I made enough for an army !!! I was afraid it would be salty with all that onion soup mix but it was perfect. A LOT of sodium though so we can't have this to often but it is very tasty.

This soup was perfect for a rainy, cool autumn day.  It was super easy to make and very flavorful.  I added a can of white beans and they were a nice addition.  Next time I think I'll just use one packet of onion soup mix.  A keeper!!

This was ok.  Was more of a stew but it could be thinned down.  I subbed beef granules since chicken stock and ground beef didn't quite make sense to me.  I also added 1 tbsp of worchestershire sauce. May make again for a quick and healthy meal.

This recipe worked well for our family. We have three small children and they all liked it. I left the hamburger in the soup to cook and I didn't think it made a difference. I also used rotini pasta, it worked fine. Overall great recipe. We will make again.

this was so easy and good and satisfying as other reviewers said.  Only thing I did differently was to cook the onions (and next time i will cook the celery too) with the ground beef so it isn't crunchy.  But other than that it was a wonderful recipe and i already put it in my recipe box.  Thank you!

I made some changes to this recipe. I used beef broth instead of chicken. Used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce,thought it would to to thick with the tomato sauce. I also added 2 TBLS of tarragon for more flavor. and 4 yukon gold potatoes. This was very good with the changes!! Will make again soon. I served it with homemade french bread!!! YUMMY

The soup was great.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  I added the pasta during the last 15 to 20 minutes.  Just be careful about adding extra salt.

well i am not a vegetable soup lover so i was skeptible it was really easy to make but was missing something so i put chesse crackers in it it made a big difference but i think it needed some diced tomatoes and maybe some potatoes cause the celery and frozen vegetables did nothing for it i will probably not make again

I made this recipe, and it turned out excellent.  My family said it was the best soup that I have ever made.  I altered to recipe a little bit.  Instead of a whole diced onion, I used a half of an onion.  Also, when I browned the ground meat, I seasoned it with beef bullion, salt, pepper, and minced garlic.  This recipe turned out wonderful, thank you!

I'll admit the name of this recipe turned me off at first.  But since there were so many good reviews, I decided to try it.  Wow, am I glad I did.  This was a HUGE hit at my church luncheon today.  

I changed up a couple of things.  I didn't have onion soup mix on hand, so I used italian seasoning & garlic powder.  I also added a little bit of cumin and some red pepper flakes just to add a little kick.  It made a big difference--the soup went from really good to fantastic.  I also added a bit of corn, which was a nice addition.  Great soup.  Really surpassed my expectations!

This recipe was easy to make and somewhat tasty, I've had much better hamburger soup.  I think the onion soup mix gave it a weird flavor to me.

Great fast and easy recipe.  I browned the beef with garlic and added a few handfuls of baby spinach with the other vegetables.  I also put some parmesan cheese on top prior to serving.

This was pretty good for a quick and easy recipe. I am just not a fan of the onion soup mix for the sodium content and I prefer a beef broth or bouillion base. This was pretty liquidy as others said, but I think that some people like their soups that way, I am not one of them. I prefer a thicker, heartier soup. Having said all of that, I think that this is a great recipe for those that are pushed for time or learning to cook, etc. I can see this being a great recipe for a dorm room or novice cook.  Thanks!

Pretty good soup and easy to make. I read in the reviews that it was to soupy so I only used one cup of water. I should have used two especially if you like to use crackers in your soup. The one thing that you need to know about this recipe is that it makes a LOT more than four servings. I would guess that 8 or 9 servings would be closer.

Not bad. I think I need a little bit more flavor from a soup but nevertheless it was good. I used seashell pasta and didn't have mixed veggies so I just threw in some carrots and peas. My picky son liked it minus the veggies so that is a good thing.

Very easy, turned out great.  This made a ton of soup for my husband and I to enjoy as leftovers - it was great!  This is also an easy recipe to "fudge" - I used all the right ingredients the first time I made it, but the second time I didn't have frozen veggies, so I threw in drained, canned stuff...still delicious!

I love this recipe. I, however, added potatoes to it and beef boulion seasoning. It did cook down to more of a goo-losh kind of meal. My whole family liked it and liked even more when they had it for leftovers the next night. Thanks.

My recipe turned into more of a goulash than a soup. I altered the recipe by adding 1/4 tsp minced garlic, a few dashes of italian seasoning, and 1 tbl spn of chili powder. I also used 1 diced potato and an extra can of tomato sauce.  My children ate it all up! I liked it but know there was a reason to only use one can of tomato sauce :) I liked the general idea of the recipe because it gave me something else to do with hamburger.  It is a great throw together meal!

This was a great recipe but, out of necessity, I changed a couple of things.  I was out of tomato sauce, which is unusual, so I added a can of condensed tomato soup.  I also added some Italian seasonings and salt and used Ditalini macaroni instead of elbow.  It was Great!  Made a double batch and shared with my parents, who are elderly, and my son and his two roommates.  They all loved it! Thanks Marge.

This was super easy, fast and tasty! I omitted the frozen mixed veggies because my husband doesn't like them. I may try next time using less broth or water to make it more like a stew.

This was quite goood. It was more like a stew than soup though.  I really like soup and my husband doesn't, but he actually liked this and commented several times.  I think that next time I'll try it with some green chilis to give it a little bit more zip.

This recipe was a hit with my children. A bit of a strong onion taste though. I used canned vegetables instead of frozen. Fast and easy!! I will reduce the onion soup mix to 1 pkt next time.

This soup is fantastic! It has so much flavor and different textures and was a big hit with my kids.  I added a can of chopped tomatoes and a little more chicken broth. Great recipe!

I made this soup for my vegetarian wife.  I'm a meat-a-tarian so I didn't try it, but will forward her thoughts on this recipe to you.  She loved it!  I substituted ground beef for veggie crumbles and also vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.   I also left out the chopped onion as two packs of onion soup mix were more than enough.  I also added extra carrots and some cooked potato's.  It made way more than the servings it said it would make.  All in all, it was a success!

Really good for how easy  it was.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted pizza sauce, and only used 1 packet of onion soup mix, and used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Nice hearty hot meal.
