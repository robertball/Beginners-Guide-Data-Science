Absolutely delicious!  The first time I made this, I tried to invert the salad and it was a mess.  So now I use a pretty glass bowl and put the cream cheese mixture on top with the pecans.  Also, instead of measuring the liquid from the can of blueberries and pineapple to equal one cup, I just add the blueberries and pineapple straight from their cans into the prepared jello.  The amount of liquid in those cans equal one cup anyway, so why measure it out?  Turns out perfect everytime.

I liked the other recipe on this site, "Blueberry Salad".  It is a lot easier and calls for raspberry jello which is alwyas available.  Don't even think about inverting this salad - the topping is delicious but too thin to expect it to hold up the weight of the Jell-o layer.

Yummy!  Instead of digging out a mold, I put it in a glass 9x13 pan with the cheescake layer on the bottom.  Will make again and again!

I made this for years, but had difficulty finding blackberry jello---the only company that makes that flavor (I haven't liked any substitute flavors-like black cherry) can be contacted at 1-800-323-2592--the blackberry flavored jello really is the best!  Everyone always loves this recipe---especially men!

Delicious.  I "lightened" this recipe up a bit by
using sugar free jello, reduced fat cream cheese, fat free sour cream and I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.
It turned out excellent.

This is Fantastic!  My family usually does not like jello salad, but this was a hit. I will top with crushed pretzles in place of the nuts next time. I did not have any problems with the cream cheese layer not setting up. Easily came out of the mold.

The finished product was great.  Everyone loved it. Problem was, I didn't understand the bottom (?) layer, so I just inverted the jello mold and spread the cream cheese layer on top!  Worked for me!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. I used black cherry jello instead of blackberry flavor.  It was a real hit - practically all disappeared at a table where we had much too much food and too few people to eat it all.  My dad can be pretty choosy about what he eats, and I swear he ate half the bowl himself.  I didn't try to turn this out like a mold - left it in the original container instead.  Delicious and looks nice too!!

I made this over the holidays and everyone commented on how good it was (all in-laws)!  Even my husband who normally hates gelatin salads ate it between meals as a snack.  It's now my favorite gelatin salad.  However, I don't see how one could ever unmold it because the cream cheese doesn't harden up enough.  Just make it in the bowl/tupperware you'll serve it in.

The BEST jello desert I've ever made!! I used black cherry jello and it tasted absolutely perfect! 
(I didn't make a jello mold either)
When I make it next time I'm going to try using either a little more cream cheese or a little less sour cream just to make the topping a little thicker. Thanks so much for a new favorite recipe!

I have had problems with molded gelatin recipes in the past, but I must admit this was extremely easy and it set-up beautifully.  In addition, it was delicious!  I brought it to a barbeque at a friend's house and was promptly asked for the recipe-everyone loved it.  The cream cheese layer really made it!

There was no way I could invert this salad.  The cream cheese part was not solid and just would have stuck to the plate, so I had to scoop it out (which didn't make a pretty sight).  I picked this recipe for a party because it was different, but it was too different.  Also, I could not find blackberry jello anywhere.  Had to use grape flavor and I think it made it too sweet????????

Really good, I made it in a glass bowl and spread the cream cheese layer over the top of the set gelatin.  The two layers look very pretty through the glass and you don't have to  worry about the cream cheese layer setting.

Divine! a tasteful and elegant salad.
I would have to use a better jello mold next time because I had trouble inverting it.  However, even though it didn't come out in layers like it is supposed to - the taste was absolutely wonderful.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  It was a big hit.  I used the previous reviewers suggestion and didn't attempt a mold.  I put it in a bowl and it was attractive and delicous.  I used black cherry jello.

Splendid recipe! However, I used 1/2 cup yogurt in place of the sour cream. To avoid the time of cutting pecans for topping, try carob chips or chocolate chips.

From just reading the recipe, I wasn't sure if I would like the combination of ingredients or not, but I'm so glad I tried this, it's so good.  I agree that it's more like a dessert than a side dish.  I substituted grape jello for the blackberry and loved the way it turned out.

This was a hit at a neighborhood Memorial Day barbeque with recipe requests all around. I used frozen wild blueberries, light sour cr, and light cr cheese. It must be the vanilla in the topping that makes it taste so good.  Don't get fancy like I tried -- fresh pineapple doesn't allow gelatin to congeal!  Luckily I read that on the box and had a can at home.  I put the salad in a pie plate with the cream mixture and pecans on the top, made it just before the party and set it in the freezer to firm up quickly.  It was ready to go in about 1/2 hour.

I have made this salad twice and it has been wiped out both times.  I use sugar free jello without any problem.  I have also used Blackberries and raspberry jello working well too.  I also added a dash of banana extract to the cream cheese/sour cream with great results.

I thought this recipe was great!  It would be easy to use other gelatin & fruit combinations too, like strawberry, etc.  I didn't invert it - didn't have an appropriate dish and, like other reviewers, thought it may not invert real well anyway.  But the cream cheese / sour cream topping was great.  Thanks!

I love this recipe, I use Cherry gelatin instead and a can of cherry pie filling to replace the blueberries. In the end.. One of my favorite dessert type dishes because you can still serve it with dinner.

Excellent salad and easy to prepare! This recipe is always requested by my family and friends and has become a staple for all of our holiday dinners. In the past, I always prepared it in a 9x13 pan; however, this year, I decided to use a mold and it turned out fine; however, next time I will wait until the last minute to remove it from the mold, as the cream cheese layer "melted" somewhat.

Had lots of compliments on this and people asked for seconds to take home. It came out of the mold fairly easy, but the cream cheese layer didn't set as well as it should have even after a longer time than suggested. I may just put in a cake pan next time and put cream cheese layer and nuts on top. I used  1 cup of chopped nuts to get even coverage. I was able to find blackberry fusion Jello so that is what I used and blueberry pie filling.

This was good.  My husband really like it.  I made it in a square dish and put the cream cheese/sour cream mixture on top.

This recipe was fantastic. You might consider changing the name of it - I think the "congealed" should change to "Holiday" ~  Blueberry Holiday Salad. I was given dubious looks from my hostess when I told her what I brought, but everyone wanted the recipe afterwards. I used a jello mold - and served the cream cheese dip on the side. It was superb. I will be adding this to my holiday tradition :)
