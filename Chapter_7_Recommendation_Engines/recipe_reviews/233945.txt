I have made this twice.  My 94 year old dad complained the first time that the top was too crunchy, so when I made it the second time I added a little more melted butter to the remaining "crust" and then pressed it into the filling.  It came out soft and my dad was very pleased.

I followed the recipe including the directions in the notes about how to without a food processor.  I used homemade strawberry preserves because that's what I had on hand.  The bars didn't really hold together and are very soft.  I think I'll keep looking for a similar recipe that works out better.  Thanks.

I thought this was excellent. I only had quick oats--they worked but it was a tad crumbly. Delicious, nonetheless. Very easy and quick, as well.
