I really enjoyed how easy this recipe really was.  My husband is not a huge broccoli fan but since I love it, I though this would be a good way to get him to eat it..success!!  I think I would add just a touch more mustard, I could taste it if I really focused on it but thought a bit more would be even better.  carmelizing the onions gave a great flavour.  I will difinatley make this again..great cool weather meal.  After making this again....I do have to say the extra mustard was what was needed and a bit more spice...  I wish more people would try this recipe!!  It is awesome!!

As written, I didn't feel the spices in this soup "worked"; but when I melted in cheese, the flavors melded beautifully.  It's quite thick with the addition of the cheese, and a small cup can be used as a dip for breadsticks or eaten plain with crackers. I would probably use this as my first choice for a buffet or appetizer soup.  One note - I never use oregano, but always substitute its milder cousin, marjoram.  For a great supper soup, see Cream of Broccoli Soup I by Antooskin.  It's flavorful without being spicy and has a thinner consistency.

This soup has potential but as written it lacks flavor. I caramelized the onion and added another 1/2 tsp dry mustard. I used evaporated milk in place of the half & half as it imparts a creamy texture without the fat and calories. I added Parmesan cheese as a garnish which did help flavor the soup somewhat. I was out of my good Smoked Spanish Paprika which would have been a nice addition. I will use it next time. This would be a nice soup to serve with a panini type sandwich.

This is so good! And I've tried a couple of the other recipes on this site for broccoli soup. Great flavour!

I used skim milk instead of whole milk and it tasted so good.

It was definitely less fat/less sodium than some of the other recipes.

Very different.  I wouldn't really call it creamy though.  The mustard really changed the taste of the soup.  I probably won't make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I make a lot of dishes using broccoli florets, and I often have leftover stems, which I don't particularly like to eat steamed. This was a great way to get rid of them! I ended up tweaking the spices, and as a few other reviewers suggested, added a little bit of cheese. For anyone willing to give it a try, this is a good base that you can customize to your satisfaction.

I found it refreshing to find a broccoli soup recipe that did not use cheese as my family must watch cholesterol.

For best flavor it's necessary to increase all the spices- including the garlic. I also use additional water as necessary. Cheese can be added if desired.

This sounded good but it was extremely bland.
