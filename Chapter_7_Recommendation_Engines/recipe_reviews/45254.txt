This is a great variation of beef stew.  The walnuts add a little crunch, the flavor is fabulous and the meat was so tender.  I thought the amount of mushrooms and walnuts seemed like a lot, so I used less, but I'm sure it's great either way. I would also recommend at least a 1/2 tsp. of pepper.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  The peppers may disintegrate (I made it twice...red peppers pretty much  melted, green peppers held shape) but it doesn't change the great flavor of the recipe!

2lbs of chuck steak does not seem excessive to me (as noted by another reviewer) considering the recipe is for EIGHT servings.

Really great flavor.  That's a LOT of meat though in ratio to the other ingredients.  So, 8 servings or 2 servings... this is A LOT of meat -- really less like a stew that I would eat straight out, and more like an entree that should be served over rice or something (to level out the meat overdose!)

This was just okay.  It lacked flavor and the walnuts didn't really add anything; wasn't crazy about the texture either.  Definitely could have used more veggies to be considered a "stew" in our house.

We did not care for this.  Too many walnuts gave it an off flavor.

Great stew for a cold night.  I substituted canned stewed tomatoes for the tomato juice and cut the walnut pieces small after roasting them slightly.  After tucking into it, I realized that it would have been even more delicious if I had added a touch of red wine.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my kids.  I did not have tomato juice, but I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and added water.  I also served it over rice only because I thought my kids may enjoy it more.

Made as directed, adding other veggies and served over rice. We didn't care for it.

This did not go over as well as I'd hoped - my husband didn't care for it.  I didn't add mushrooms (we didn't have any), so that may have changed the dynamic a bit.  Also, the directions were slightly misleading, as I originally read the stew as simmering for 1 1/2 hours, which was way too long for the amount of liquid in the pot.  Fortunately I caught it before it scorched.  It's an interesting concept, walnuts in the stew, but it didn't taste exceptionally brilliant and didn't please the family as much as I'd hoped.
