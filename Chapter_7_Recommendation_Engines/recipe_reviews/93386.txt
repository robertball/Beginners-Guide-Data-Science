Great recipe for mashed potatoes! I lightened it up a bit by using Land O Lakes light butter and skim milk.  These turned out really good - there's just nothing like good old fashioned comfort food!

Ohhhh, don't add all this milk in at once! I have a feeling you'll be disappointed if you do.  Just dribble it into the potatoes until you get the thickness that appeals to you. And, while it's always a good idea to heat the milk before adding it to the potatoes, I'm not sure I understand the necessity of boiling it.  The reason I tried these potatoes had nothing to do with that however.  It was all about the nutmeg. I've enjoyed the slightest hint of it in other savory dishes, but never in potatoes, and I was curious.  While I won't make a habit of including nutmeg in my mashed potatoes, I did enjoy the subtle hint of it here as well and was pleased I tried it (but Hubs not so much).

Followed recipe to a "T" and they are hands down, the best I have ever tasted.  I initially thought the nutmeg was weird, but found it makes a cream of mushroom soup, so why not mashed potatoes?  I will use this every time I make mashed.  Hubby loves them even more than my normal "best ever" so this is a true hit.    Since making them the first time, he has requested them over and over.  Calls them "Moe's Mashed" says he has never tasted anything so delicious.  Morgan, thanks for posting.

Fabulous!  I was looking for a bit healthier version so I kept the skins on, used "Smart BalanceÂ® Butter Blend Stick", and used 2% milk.  I really think the Yukon Gold potatoes were the difference in the texture and taste.

Great recipe.  The nutmeg adds an interesting flavor that reminded me of Thanksgiving.  I would definitely make them again.

VERY creamy. I might even use a little less milk but they were very good. I also sprinkled with garlic powder and that tasted great!

Crowd pleaser!  These will be my go-to mashed potatoes.  But I wouldn't follow a previous reviewers suggestion to leave on the peel.  (I don't know what I was thinking doing that.)  It just got clumped up and I ended up picking it out.  I used 1% milk to lighten up and it still came out great.

Mmmmmm...delish!  These were fabulous.  I substituted cream for the whole milk, and only used about 1 T butter.  Did not use the nutmeg, but put about 1 1/2 t kosher salt in along with a generous sprinkling of white pepper.  I didn't peel the potatoes because I'm lazy and also like them that way.  They were the most delicious potatoes I've ever had!

These are DELICIOUS.  Absolutely LOVE the nutmeg...I never would have thought to add that in!  I've made these a few times, and they are now my go-to mashed potatoes.

Nice easy recipe. I thought it was going to be way too much liquid for the potatoes but they soaked it all up and it turned out just right. I added another couple of pinches of nutmeg for flavor.

I thought it was very good, but I would use a bit less milk next time to keep them a bit firmer.

This is a great basic mashed potatoes recipe.  I have added a quartered onion to the potatoes while cooking and eliminated the nutmeg but all else remains the same.  This turns out perfect every time.

These mashed potatoes were seriously awesome. And the recipe is easy enough for a novice! My husband made them and even though I'm no expert he *never* cooks and they came out great! Super creamy without having to add cream cheese. I did sub 1/4 of the milk with 1/4 whipping cream.

I used organic red potatoes and fat free evaporated milk that I warmed to almost scalding. This is about as basic as you can get for mashed potatoes but sometimes, the most basic foods are the best. When aren't mashed potatoes comforting? I served this with Mushroom Cube steaks and fresh corn.

I picked up Yukons by mistake, but really wanted to make mashers, so I used this recipe. Spot on with the Yukons! The texture is different, but we enjoyed it. I left out the nutmeg (just seemed odd to me), used skim milk, and added a little extra butter. Oh! I used my leftovers to make Tender Potato Biscuits from this site. These were great too.

Best mashed potatoes we ever had!! I made both the vegan version for myself and the regular version and they were both almost identical in taste and awesome! For the first time, my kids ate and loved the homemade mash. Usually, they insist on only eating the store-bought (unhealthy) stuff! Thank you for this recipe!

Creamy & comforting!  The hint of nutmeg is surprisingly good! I didn't have whole milk, so I used 1/4 cup 2% milk and 1/4 cup whipping cream.  These will definitely become a staple side dish.

These are very creamy and delicious. I used heavy cream instead of whole milk, because that's what I had. I will use heavy cream every time, though. I believe that's what made these so creamy. My entire family loved them.

These were very good! I didn't use the nutmeg as that just didn't sound good. my family requested a "simple" mashed potato recipe so this is the one I found. I used half & half in place of milk to make it creamier. Overall a great dish with gravy!

I made this for a friend and her husband (she had a baby - with a C-section cut) and they absolutely loved it! Using those Yukon Golds gave it a more rich and hearty taste than regular potaotes. Although they're a lil' more pricier, but they are worth it! Watch the kosher salt though I 'poured' a little too much and it made them salty - but good! lol!

This a great recipe, but too much milk made it a little too thin.  Next time I will use a tab less milk.

Great taste however, weird texture.  I think this is too much milk.

A great recipe for mashed potatoes! I added two tablespoons of sour cream and mashed instead of blended. They turned out great!

So simple and great flavors.  I made this twice in a week.  The second time I made it I used my kitchenaid mixer and it was so easy.

Wonderful mashed potatoes. I can't believe the difference in flavor using Yukon Golds vs Russets. I am making these for Easter dinner this year.

best mashed potatoes recipe! also added a few chives and some bacon I had leftover, and turned it into "loaded" mashed easily!
