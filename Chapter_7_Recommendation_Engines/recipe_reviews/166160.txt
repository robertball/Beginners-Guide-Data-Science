We used this recipe this Thanksgiving and the turkey came out EXCELLENT!  We marinaded the turkey in the champagne and broth for 24 hours before and rubbed the seasonings in the turkey cavity and under the skin and stuffed with carrots, onions, celery and orange as directed.  The result was a juicy turkey (even the white meat) that was full of flavor!!  Thanks so much!!!

I used this recipe last night and it was truly the most moist (perfect) turkey  I have ever done. I cooked a 20 pound Norbest turkey and I used a cooking bag, in which I put everything as this recipe says , including the whole bottle of champagne(Blanc Noir variety).It was perfect, Kirsten! 

Other notes:
I didn't add the carrots because I don't like carrots :-)
I rubbed the outside with Olive Oil and some salt and pepper after pouring in the champagne.

Although the included temperature gauge popped out at 3 hours, I cooked it another half hour. The white meat was delicious, and not dry at all.

Great recipe, It was very moist, but I did change up a couple things! The night before, I coated the turkey with Kosher salt and let it sit over night in the fridge in a pan of water. The next day I rinsed the turkey off and followed the recipe but I also coated the turkey with margerine and Instead of using foil, I used an oven bag! Everything I changed up also enhances how moist the turkey will be! It was so moist that the meat fell off the bone!! So good! mmmm

I've never made a turkey before, mostly because I never had to for Thanksgiving and I was always afraid to mess up something so big and expensive. Well, my husband brought a free turkey home from work for Christmas, and I found this recipe. Today, we both got together to make this 15lb. turkey.

I have to say, it's probably the best turkey I've ever had!!! We were a great team, (I prepared everything, but he got to clean out the turkey and stuff it). The turkey was in the oven about 3 hrs., then I opened the foil up for 30 mins. as directed. After it came out and sat for 15 minutes, the electric knife cut that turkey like it was meant for display; better than my Mom's on any Thanksgiving day. I called and told her we would make it this year.

Thankyou for a wonderful recipe even I can follow!

Well, seriously, I love to try new ways of doing turkey and this is, so far, the BEST!  It's hard to overcook this turkey because the meat is SO moist and FULL of proper flavor.  I mixed up all and lots of the herbs and rubbed the cavity AND 'under' the skin and over the skin.  In pouring the ginger ale or Champagne over the turkey be careful and don't pour much over because it washes the herbs off.  Maybe rubbing butter on first will help the herbs 'stick' so they won't wash off.  I think the champagne is better than the ginger ale only because we found the gravy ended up a 'bit' sweet from the pop and needed to be compensated by more salt and pepper.  Some people actually liked the slight sweet taste for a change.  No more brining the turkey.  No more turning turkey upside down.  This is simple, and the white meat is as moist as the dark and NOT dry.  We've cooked a lot of turkeys but this is a keeper.   That's not to say we won't try another recipe.  It's fun to experiment.  Enjoy.

I made this today. It was absolutely the best turkey I've ever done. The only thing I did differently was to cook it outside on my gas grill which has a temperature gauge, so it basically worked like an oven. Will definitely do this again. Everyone raved about the turkey.

I have a question.  I have never made this recipe.  My roaster has a little half inch rack that goes in it.  Do I use the rack or let everything sit in the foil?  BTW, super excited about trying this.

Ok, I'm a lil late on reviewing this recipe but better late than never right? As a Newlywed, Thanksgiving was the first family holiday meal I was put to the test to make (my mother in-law was so worried she sent us pre-cut turkey slices and all the fixings). Needless to say we didn't need the "emergency care package". I followed this recipe to a T and it came out AMAZING!! My husband and family are raving about it still! The only thing that could have made it better would be if my in-laws were in town to experience it also!!  :)

Absolutley the best oven baked turkey I have ever made. It was a perfect mix of spice and flavor... and the juice!!!...There wasn't a dry piece of meat in the bunch. Don't even think about needing gravy!!  Even warming it up the day after, the flavors and juices were there.  My relatives couldn't stop commenting on how good the turkey was.  Fantastic!! Thanks so much!

Thank you for the awesome turkey recipe!!  I normally make a ham as the fam love ham:) But decided to be traditional this year.  It was so juicy!!  The cooking time was longer for me, it actually took 5 hrs for a 13 lb bird {could be my oven)but not a dry piece of meat and the flavor was awesome!!  I don't even really care for turkey all that much and I can't stop eating the leftovers!!  I just had a cold turkey wrap with home made dill dip, lettuce and cheese! (I'm in love with home made dill dip and dip everything in it from veggies to ham!)  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, it made our thanksgiving dinner great!

This is a terrific recipe- I would add more step-
before cooking, I always brine the turkey -Frozen or not, it comes out really yummy-here's what I do-
in a bucket I put one can of orange juice concentrate, 1/3 cup of coarse pickling or kosher salt, 1/3 cup brown sugar and enough water to cover most of the turkey.If you have the space, put this into a cold  space, a fridge is best if it has room  for about 12 hours before cooking.
Then do the recipe as suggested adding 10  garlic cloves into the cavity.

This recipe is amazing! The turkey was the juiciest I've ever had. The only change I made was to take the dried herbs and mix them in one stick of butter. I then rubbed half the butter/herb mixture under the skin and the other half on top of the skin. The champagne and broth did not remove any of this mixture when I poured it on top. Thanks for this recipe!

I've been making turkeys for 20 years, and this one was the BEST! I've tried slow-roasting, the bags, basting every 1/2 hour... this was the easiest and moistest bird of the lot.  I followed the directions exactly.  I did prepare the bird the night before and put it in the fridge overnight. Pretty sure that didn't alter the results either way. The 17 lb. bird I cooked took a total of 5 hours, 15 mins, which was longer than I expected, but it was worth it. Golden brown skin, moist breast meat, and succulent dark meat were worth the wait. My family loved it so much, that they've requested it in place of the Christmas ham!

This was absolutely the best turkey I have ever had! It will definitely be my holiday turkey recipe from now on. My son loves it so much we make it once or twice a month. It it extremely easy and so tender. I didn't even need cranberry. I did make some adjustments to it though. I brined the turkey the night before (rub with salt and place in water overnight in the fridge). I also used pink champagne which gave it a wonderfully sweet taste. I didn't have oranges so I squirted the inside with lemon juice for the citrus taste and added chopped carrots and apples in the cavity. The apples absorbed the wonderful champagne flavor! So good! The gravy is fantastic! I also cooked it in the roaster oven (15-17 per pound) so that the house wouldn't get hot and left the oven free for other things. I would like to add that I do not like champagne as a drink because of the flavor and I still LOVED this!

This is by far the BEST turkey I have ever had - even more moist than a fried turkey.  The first time, however, I substituted sparkling cider for the champagne.  The 2nd time I used the champagne.  It was very moist and delicious, but next time I use the cider.  It added an extra layer of flavor.  There was no need for cranberry sauce because of the moist and flavorful meat!  Thanks for a recipe that allows me to be proud of the beautiful golden turkey that tastes as good as it looks!

Thank you so much for posting this Kirsten!  It was absolutely the best turkey I ever had and everyone agreed too.  It was my first year cooking, and since everyone liked it so much I am going to make it a part of my Thanksgiving tradition!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to cook a little longer for a 15 pound bird, but there are lots of leftovers and I am looking forward to them!

I only made the recipe up to the Salt (I stuffed my bird), but my husband and I really enjoyed this. I did modify this a bit though. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used a smoked pepper that we got from a Tea and Spice company instead. I mixed all this together first. Since I didn't want a dry rub, I took a stick of butter (softened) and 3 Tbsp of Lemon Juice and mixed everything together. It was easy to rub under the turkey's skin; and when it was done the skin (which I don't usually eat) was so crisp and flavorful. The aroma in my home was so seasonal and my neighbors came and asked me what smelled so good. When I let them try a piece the instantly wanted the recipe. I will absolutely use this again.

I have made this turkey for the past 2 Thanksgivings.  It is DELICIOUS.  Turns out moist and nicely-flavored.  Plus the champagne drippings make a wonderful gravy.  Highly recommend!

I just used this recipe in a test run for thanksgiving recipes and it was fantastic! I did brine the turkey overnight using water, champagne, apple cider vinegar and salt, and added apples to the cavity along with the carrot onion and celery. Absolutely delicious!

THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST TASTING TURKEY EVER!!! I changed a few things to it though. I melted half a cup of butter and mixed it in with the spices and then rubbed it all over the turkey, including the inner cavitey and under the skin. Then I put the turkey in an oven bag and let it sit over night. The next morning I injected melted salted butter into the turnkey (about 1 cup). I changed orange in the recipe to 1 can of pinapple chunks. I also changed the champagne for ginger ale as other people had tried. The turkey came out perfect and the skin browned beautifully. The meat was practicaly falling off the bone. I had so much turkey juice for the gravey. The gravey turned out great as well. It had a sort of a semi sweet taste but it went perfect with everything. I will be doing this recipe for years to come. Thanks Kirsten for sharing this with everyone. MY FAMILY LOVED THIS RECIPE : )

This recipe is outstanding! Not only did we use it for Thanksgiving, but we used the marinade to roast a whole chicken. Everytime I make a poultry dish with this marinade, I recieve rave reviews. Also, for the turkey, I couldn't convince my husband to part with the expensive bottle of champagne so I used 2 bottles of beer instead. :) I also prepped the Turkey the night before and let it sit in the marinade. Again, this was outstanding. I will never make a Turkey without this marinade ever again!

HANDS DOWN THE BEST!  I made this turkey for my company thanksgiving party.  everyone declared it was the best they've ever had.  Some tried it that don't even like turkey and also said the same.  Came out perfectly juicy and the meat didn't have that STRONG turkeyness to it.  Super delicious.  Don't change a thing!

This will lead to a dried out turkey. Turkey dries when the internal temperature reaches over 150 degrees. I would suggest taking it out at 145 degrees and letting it rest - otherwise, horribly dry turkey and the need for gravy. Let it rest for 20 minutes.

The BEST turkey I have ever made.  Juicy, and oh, my goodness, the gravy...so much flavor.  It's worth making just for the gravy!  After it finished cooking we added the veggies from inside the turkey to our stuffing, and made it the best stuffing, too!

My 1st turkey.  was beautiful. Very Moist.  only problem was my vegetables didn't roast well, so they weren't as tasty as I thought they would be & I ended up tossing them.  I used fresh herbs & about tripled but can't taste them (or anything else so much really... the flavoring was really subtle.  my turkey was 20 lbs though. so maybe that affected things)  I probably should have used dried or rubbed them under the skin.  (but I tend to like my food spicy or strongly flavored. not the recipe's fault)  plus I didn't follow it to a T.  the 5 stars were because it was SO easy, almost no maintenance and it was still really wonderful.  Prettiest one I've seen in person, like out of a magazine.

I have made this recipe three times now - the past two Thanksgivings and last Christmas. I'm a grad student, and until then I had never made a turkey by myself before. It has turned out perfectly every time - even when I lacked a couple of the ingredients at one point. My fiance, brothers, aunt, and even parents and friends said it was the juiciest and most flavorful turkey they had ever had! Thank you so much for sharing and making holidays less stressful with this delicious and easy turkey recipe!

My first turkey! Our 10 person Thanksgiving dinner loved it and agreed that it was in their top 3 turkeys ever. Was easy to prep the ingredients the night before and assemble once the oven was hot on the day.

Tried to find the perfect turkey recipe over a lot of years and finally I found it! This will be my go to every Thanksgiving. I used a turkey roasting bag and also rubbed some of the seasoning under the skin.  I used a dry champagne because I didn't want a sweet gravy. These drippings made a wonderful gravy.  The following is how I made my gravy if you are interested. 

I make my turkey the day before Thanksgiving. Take all the meat off the bone and place in a zip lock bag with enough drippings to keep the turkey moist and then refrigerate. Place the remaining drippings in a zip lock bag and refrigerate overnight.  The Next Day:  Warm the turkey in a crock pot with just enough added chicken stock to keep moist. The fat in the drippings bag will gel and come to the top of the bag.  I skim the fat off the top and warm the remaining drippings in a pan with 8 cups of chicken stock and a couple sprigs of rosemary. Meanwhile in a large pan make a roux by melting 4 tablespoons of butter and then sprinkle ½ cup of flour into butter. (I double this so I have extra roux if I need more thickener)   Cook on medium heat for 4 minutes.  Gradually add the warmed broth to roux stirring with a wisk. Heat on medium high heat until desired thickness. Salt and pepper to taste.  Pour through sifter to remove rosemary and any clumps of roux. Keep warm in pan or crockpot.

Twas the first time I baked a turkey, and my friends resembled vultures on the african sahara picking at any scrap they could find. BTW, I tried making gravy out of the champagne drippings and let's just say my whole digestive track went into reverse for about 5 seconds. Look up Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy for a easy and delicious gravy.

Even though I changed a few things, I am writing a review because I think the process in this recipe matters more than anything. I wanted to follow the recipe exactly, but I found it Thanksgiving morning, so I had to go with what was on hand. The turkey was perfect (super juicy) and the gravy was phenomenal. Part of that was by accident... and I sure hope I can repeat it in the future! I placed a few rings of oranges and apples on the bottom of a roasting pan, which I had drizzled with olive oil. I didn't do this for any other reason than to raise the turkey a bit off the bottom of the pan. Since the turkey was wrapped in foil so well for the first few hours, the fruit cooked (burned a bit) and then when I opened the foil to cook the turkey for the last hour, some of the juices went into the bottom and "merged" with the overcooked fruit. I had enough liquid from the pan to make a ton of gravy and it was AMAZING. It was very dark and flavorful. A couple other changes - I didn't have champagne on hand (though I will try that next time), so I used Martinelli's Sparkling Cider. It worked well... not too sweet, like you might think. Also, I didn't have all of the spices in the recipe, so I decided to use Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute. I'm sure the original recipe is also delicious, but the changes I had to make worked out really well (especially the accidental burning of the fruit in the pan!). Thank you for posting this -- I was getting bored the same turkey taste every year!

This turkey was phenomenal.  The only thing that I did differently was to substitue the champagne for Ginger Ale like another review suggested.  Really had a wonderful flavor, very juicy and the meat was so tender is was falling off the bone.  I did all the prep for the turkey the night before and let it sit, covered, in the fridge overnight and put in the oven first thing in the morning.  I made a 15 pound turkey and I actually had a hard time getting all the ingredients stuffed into the cavity so I just did about half.  I also used baby carrots rather than regular carrots but I don't think that mattered.  My whole family loved it and if you are looking for a traditional 'carve at the table' turkey then this is it.  It really looks as great as it tastes.

This turkey was the best turkey I have ever made.  And I have tried to roast turkeys for 30 years.  I tried numerous ways to cook it so that it would be moist: upside down, totally wrapped in foil, in an electric roaster,fried etc.  My search is over and I will always cook it this way.  Thank you so much.  Oh, by the way, I used ginger ale instead of champagne.

We used this recipe last night and it was amazing. The turkey came out delicious and moist. All our guests commented on this being the best turkey they have ever had. We did make a few modifications:We added 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon to the spices. We doubled the carrots and celery and added one lemon. Everything that didnt fit inside the turkey, we put around it. We also rubbed the outside of the turkey with butters and herbs in order to get the golden brown look. It was great. This will be our go to recipe from now on. =)

If you're using a baking bag, don"t forget to vent it (poke it, cut it, whatever) or your turkey might explode. This was SOOOO moist and juicy, my family raved and asked for the recipe!

I gave this recipe to my mom who ended up having to make the Thanksgiving turkey without me. We were both so worried (neither of us had tried this recipe and she was so used to cooking the turkey her own way for many years). But it turned out SOOOO juicy! It was also gorgeous! The leftovers also didn't last long as they stayed juicy. Great turkey -- will be making this again next Thanksgiving!

DELICIOUS!!  OMG...the best turkey I have ever made, no kidding.  I followed the directions exactly and the bird came out moist, tender and perfectly cooked.  The meat was literally dripping.  I just let the turkey cook for about 3 hours then uncovered and basted for about an hour...perfect.  (17lb. bird)  I don't know what it is, maybe the champagne?  But, a keeper recipe for sure!!

I have made this at least 3 times and it always gets rave reviews!  Never add the lemon pepper becasue I just never use and don't want to buy it for one dinner a year.  Makes excellent gravey and there is plenty of drippings to make it with.  Just be very careful when removing the foil!  It will let a lot of steam out and I have gotten a pretty good burn on my hands from it once or twice.

With the exceptions of ising a roasting bag instead of foil & using a cut lemon instead of lemon pepper, I have used this recipe for years. My turkey is not just moist, it is juicy & remains so for the duration of any leftovers.  I still use whatever is leftover in my turkey gumbo.

This was my first year cooking for thanksgiving.  I have to say this is probably the best Turkey I have ever had, and I am not a fan of turkey. I got so many compliments on it.  It is so moist, and everyone could taste the flavors!! Amazing! This recipe will be yearly tradition with my family!  My brother who always makes the turkey wants this recipe! Thank you! Loved it!

The turkey came out just ok, but the worst part was the gravy made from the turkey juices. Because of the champagne, the gravy was very sour and tart. So sour it gave me the "bitter beer face" every time I tasted it. The gravy completely ruined my entire thanksgiving dinner because I pour gravy over everything! Thank goodness it was only made for immediate family. If I had made this for more guests, I would have been embarrassed! I actually had to make my own homemade chicken gravy the day after thanksgiving so we could use that with leftovers. I think the turkey had great flavor from the spices but the gravy would be a million times better without the champagne. I will never make turkey this way again!

Made this turkey today for my first ever 10+ people family dinner!! It was also my very first turkey and let me just say that I am SO glad I used this recipe!!!!! Like everybody said, it was super juicy and I think it was really flavorful. I did the same as a lot of other reviewers and prepped the turkey the night before. Subbed the champagne for ginger ale, and used fresh herbs instead of dry ones (also rubbed them and butter on and under skin AFTER pouring the broth and ginger ale on the turkey).  My turkey was 14 Lbs and it took about 3.5 hours and it was delicious. Juice was literally running out everywhere when we were carving it. 
Please don't be scared to use this recipe, I was so nervous, but this really is fool proof and you will for sure be the star turkey maker in your family!!

An outstanding recipe.  I used a covered roaster instead of the foil.  The two chefs shared a glass of the champagne.  The herb mixture is great and all the better when slipped under the skin.  Suggest using only a very dry champagne so the gravy does not become sweet.  Thanks Kirsten for a great Thanksgiving.

Was really intrigued by this recipe and decided to risk a fresh turkey and fix it. All I had for a sparkling wine was an Asti spomonte that smelled very sweet when it was opened. Went for broke and used it anyway. It even didn't smell that great while it was cooking, so I was worried the whole time. I used a cooking bag and it was done In a little over two hours for a 14 pound turkey. The turkey had a pop up button it it was right on for the doneness. The results.....FABULOUS!!!!!!  The skin was perfectly browned(from the sugar in the wine I am sure), the meat was juicy and tender and the gravy from the juices was outstanding. What I would do differently next time is pour the sparkling wine over and in the bird, then rub with olive oil and then the spices. Pouring the wine over the bird after  rubbing with the spices just rinsed all the spices off the top. I think any sparkling white wine would do, tho would not use such a sweet wine the next time.

I make this turkey every Thanksgiving.  I use a bottle of cheap white wine instead of the Champagne.  It's always juicy and flavorful.  My family loves it.

I made this last year and I'm making it again this year.  It was the first time cooking a Thanksgiving dinner and this turkey was a hit.  I did change it just a little bit by injecting Tony Chachere's butter and rubbed the outside with olive oil and Goya seasoning.  I might have gone overboard but everyone had seconds and I had nothing left over.  This year I'm thinking about making two birds.

I was so excited after all the great comments here.  The gravy from the champagne was incredible, but the turkey wasn't to die for.  It wasn't as moist as I had hoped for, pretty ordinary.  It is possible that I did something wrong, or cooked it too long for the size.  I may try again sometime with a much larger turkey.

This was pretty good stuff. I used:  2 tbs dried parsley; 6 tbs poultry seasoning; 1 tbs salt; 1 tbs lemon pepper.  Veggies:   half an extra large onion; 2 stalks celery, 2 carrots, and the orange.  And lastly, used ginger ale, too, instead of champagne.  It really was the moistest, best turkey I've tasted thus far. My hubby really raved about it. I have a new turkey recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This is the BEST turkey recipe!! I've made 4 turkeys using this recipe (with a couple mods) and it always turns out wonderful! The flavor is great and its soo juicy! The mods I've made are: mixing the herbs with butter or olive oil and smothering the turkey under and over the skin as well as inside the cavity(the butter or oil helps the herbs stick to the bird), can of ginger ale instead of champagne, I also remove the legs and wings and bake separately. This reduces the cooktime to about 2 hours + broil time to make the skin golden brown and crunchy. I also pull it out when the internal temp is 165* because. I'm not cooking the dark meat. My turkeys are sooo tender cooking them thus way!!

This was my very first attempt in cooking turkey and it turned out so well! I did do some modification. I have a small chopper where I combined all of the herbs, salt, pepper, a whole lemon juice and rind with a cup of olive oil (depends on  how big your turkey, I had a 22lbs) I rubbed it all over the turkey and under the skin and coated the chopped veges before stuffing in the turkey. I poured a can of ginger ale (didn't have champagne) and chicken broth into the cavity and cooked it in a bag. It was very juicy and the herbs really shine through the turkey. After it was done, I used the stuffed veges as the gravy by fully processing it and cooking it with some drippings and a bit more broth from the turkey bag. It was easy and very delicious!

I used this recipe last thanksgiving and am excited to do it again this year.   My husband is a picky eater and it is the first thanksgiving I had to make the turkey; for 40 of my inlaws at that. Needless to say he went to work bragging about my turkey.  Thank you Kirsten for this recipe you made me look like a hero.

THis recipe was really good.  I had no lemon pepper, I don't believe we missed it at all.  I had no champagne, so I used ginger ale and wine mix.  The only other revision was I used less salt..
I had 12 people for this meal, and they all loved the turkey.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Last year I found this reciped as I panicked about cooking my first turkey ever, with little cooking experience.  It was WONDERFUL!  It gave me the confidence to become a decent cook and actually learn to enjoy it!  Highly recommended for "newbies" looking for a surefire turkey.

EASY and YUMMY!That was the best turkey I`ve ever ate or made. Thank you very much! It was  the easiest recipe ever. The turkey comes out juicy and beautiful! My turkey was huge so it took me much longer: about 3 hours covered in foil and 1.5 without it. Next year I will use half of recommended dose of champagne.

I added 2 tablespoons of garlic powder, and punctured the seasoning mix in the turkey.  Instead of using champagne, I used ginerale.  I seasoned, and marinaded it over night.  Cooking time was more like an 1 1/2 longer.  Turkey was, juicy and delicious.  Though it was my first time making turkey, it was not my fist time tasting it.  Mine was tastier than most. I will use this recipe next year.

Ummm, basically the best turkey recipe ever! I used ginger ale instead of champagne since I live in a dry county and you cant buy champagne.  I didnt use carrots or celery since I dont like either.  I stuffed with orange, apples, onion and all the seasonings then cooked in a baking bag.  It was a 24 pound turkey and was done in 3 and a half hours.  Super juicy and falling off the bone. The gravy made with the juice was awesome too! All around a great recipe that I will be using year after year! Thank ou for sharing!!

OMG!  I screwed up and didn't even screw it up!  :-)  I bet it would have been juicer if I hadn't accidentally turned off the oven when checking the bird temp.  :-)  Followed recipe exactly.  Awesome.

Yes!!!! My boyfriend & I used this recipe last yr for Thanksgiving. I must say it was amazing!!! I've never been a huge fan of eating turkey, but with this recipe, it kept me/ us coming back for more. That was my first time cooking a turkey actually. None of the meat, went to waste... It's almost that time again & I will be using this recipe this Nov 2014 Thanksgiving for him!!!!???? 
Excited & looking forward 
                                 Thanks

Fabulous recipe, but TIPS!  I made this last night, just as directed though I substituted sparkling cider for the champagne (trying to save a stop at the liquor store and it sounded good, shame on me).  I do NOT recommend this.  I will in the future go for a white wine or dry champagne, as I was not a fan of the sweetness from using the cider.  Also, the orange in the cavity sounded so fancy and like it would have this nice light aroma of oranges.  Nope, tastes like sweet orange turkey.  However, I can see where this recipe is going, and I am giving it 5 stars because never in my life have I had turkey this moist.  With the exception of my personal taste preferences, this is a fantastic recipe!  I'll still eat the turkey, just have to find the right recipes for the meat :)  As far as cooking the turkey, I used a roaster on 350 for about 2.5 hours (the turkey was in a bag), and this was for a 12# bird.

It has been five months since Thanksgiving and people are still talking about this turkey. I did brine this turkey and used cheap white wine insead of champagne. To those of you who complained about your turkey not being moist--my guess is you put stuffing in your turkey which dries it out. Will make this again!

This will be my second year making this recipe. I loved it last year and have it saved so I can use it whenever needed :) I see some questions on the champagne I bought Brut but any dry/extra dry will be great. Avoid any sweet/pink champagne for cooking. Also for parents using champagne its fine with cooking as it burns the alcohol and is used more for moisture and flavor :)

Had to give this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't prepare it exactly as written. My friend had already made her favorite stuffing (a very meaty stuffing with crasins). But, I believe it's the roasting process that is the key! We used 1/2 the amount of spices, stuffed the turkey, poured in the champagne and broth, and wrapped as directed. Done in 4 1/4 hours at 360 degrees  (high altitude). AWESOME!! Thank you!

I usually don't like turkey.  This turkey was nice and juicy.  I ate it and thought it was a great recipe.  I didn't get real champagne since it was too pricey so I got sparkling wine which was nice too.

This was only the second time I've made a turkey and I was a little nervous about it - what a mistake that was!  Having marinated it for 24 hours in the champagne and rubbing the seasoning under the skin and in the cavity, the turkey took care of itself!!  So delicious and tender, this will be my staple from now on!

This was my first turkey so I followed recipe exactly except I didn't use the champagne because we don't drink it and I had no clue what kind to get. I couldn't believe how juicy it was! I got so many compliments on this at our dinner! I am making it again at Christmas. THANKS!!

This was a great recipe.  Easy to follow and VERY tasty.  The only thing i changed was that I rubbed the turkey with salt the night before and soaked it in water overnight (in the fridge).  The next morning, I rinsed it off, rubbed it with butter, then followed the recipe.  I also put it in a bag.  When serving, I served it with orange slices and dribbling the orange juices over it only made it yummier.  Seriously, the flavor of this turkey was spectacular.  I didn't really find that it was super moist, not sure if I might have done something wrong.  Don't get me wrong, it was great, just not incredibly moist as I hoped after the rave reviews.  Still worth it though, I will certainly use this recipe again.  The leftovers were phenomenal.  The stuffing made with the juices was delicious--and I don't even like stuffing!

The turkey did turn out pretty juicy, but my family was not crazy about the flavor.  It had some sort of twang to it and I wish I had tried the recipe before using it on Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using an oven bag.

The turkey stock has never tasted so good... EVER. I don't know what it is about this recipe... but just like the title states - our turkey was juicy as ever!!! We made a 25 lb. turkey, so doubled all the spices that we rubbed inside, and added a can and 1/2 of chicken broth. Great!

Phenomenal recipe! I had a turkey that had been in the freezer for ages & decided I needed the space.  Even with a less than "fresh" bird, the flavor was delicious; the meat unbelievably moist.  Thanks for sharing!

The champagne is the kicker! I buy the cheapest brut. It gives a wonderful aroma and and amazing flavor to the gravy. (FYI: for the gravy, all you need to do is make a roux w 1/4 c flour and 1/4 c butter and 4 c of the juice. Its delicious!!) I made it as instructed but nixed the carrots and I peeled the orange first (I didn't the 1st time and the peelings made everything kind of bitter). I also added olive oil to the seasonings mixture to make it a paste consistency so it adhered to the cavity better and I smeared it under the skin as well. I used an oven bag and it worked great. No need to baste or anything. Baked at 350 for 2 1/2 to 3 hrs for about a 20 lb turkey.

I've been making this recipe since I found it 2 years ago! It is AMAZING. I've had nothing but compliments on my turkey since I started making it using this recipe. After making it the first time, I decided to start  injecting the turkey with the juices while cooking, as well as basting it regularly. I would do this every 15 minutes or so. I also added Coca-Cola/Butter (melted) mixture to basting/injecting process. As far as the herbs go, I used a lot more than what was suggested, but its all up to you. This is a GREAT recipe! A MUST ADD TO YOUR RECIPE BOX!

I have been brining my turkey for the last 8 years but it is such a hassle that on a whim on Tuesday, I decided to look for a new recipe. I lucked out, in that I had all of the ingredients for this one, including the champagne, so decided to go ahead and give it a try. The changes I made - mixed all the dry ingredients into a 1/2 cup of softened butter & rubbed all over, inside & out, then stuffed the bird with an onion & apples. Normally I cook the morning of thanksgiving but I always run behind because it ends taking an extra hour or 90 minutes to get the temp up to 180 so I also changed things up by cooking the bird on Wednesday. The house smelled so good on Wednesday that I was a little bummed that I had not waited. Even though I cooked on Wednesday, then refrigerated over night and reheated on Thursday, the bird was not at all dried out. I wish that the instructions for making gravy with the drippings would have been included. After searching the internet, I found a really good one (http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-quick-turkey-gravy-thanksgiving-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-161016). I thought the dippings made excellent gravy. When I brine, the drippings are way too salty. One other comment, my brine included 2 cups of bourbon and I loved the flavor it gave the turkey and was really hoping to find a recipe that used bourbon but no such luck when I searched by ingredients. I will use this recipe again next year unless I find one that has bourbon.

I tried to cook turkey previous years and was discouraged until I found this recipe. Although I didn't follow it to a T (I like commercial stuffing =p) I like to think the turkey turned out amazing because of your recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this! My family loved it and so did I!!

I just tried this recipe yesterday.  I was looking for a recipe that would make a "juicy" turkey.  I was at first worried about adding the alcohol - not sure if it would leave an after taste.  Well, I must say, this was the best turkey I've made yet!!!  There were no leftovers and the dark and white meat were so tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly - just needed to cook the 20 lbs longer than stated on the recipe.  I will definitely do this one again.  The bird looked beautiful for presentation also... What a wonderful way to prepare the turkey.  Thanks for sharing!

This was such an amazing recipe - very easy to follow, and all of my Thanksgiving guests were raving about how moist and delicious it was!  Be sure to leave a little bit of the dry spice mix to sprinkle over the top of the turkey, as it makes the skin extra flavorful.  Highly recommended!

This was my first time using champagne to cook a turkey.  It smelled wonderful while it was cooking and tasted moist and juicy 20 minutes out the oven.  However, I was surprised that a few hours later the legs were extremely dry and hard.  I am not a turkey fan so maybe it is just me.  The flavors were mild but good.  Unfortunately there are a lot of leftovers....so I will be making soups lol.

Unbelievable! Everyone said how juicy this turkey was. You have no idea. So good! I even messed up. In the stress of taking on Thanksgiving dinner and making my first turkey, I actually forgot to pour the broth and champagne over top. Two hours into baking I went ahead and did pour. Still turned out awesome. Who knows how good it would have tasted if I had done in correctly. I did use a baking bag instead of foil. Turkey fell off the bone and full of juice. Recommend highly. Will defintely make again.

I cut the dry ingredients in half and incorporate them well in a half block of butter and spread the entire mixture under the skin making sure to get under the breast and legs and neck and in the cavity and the turkey comes out excellent!! The butter really helps in making it extra moist. First time I made it I put all the herbs in the cavity like in the instructions but found it was too much herb. Mixing the herbs with butter is a much better idea and spreading it everywhere. I have made it several times now and every time someone mentions how it's the best turkey they've ever had! I don't use champagne but I do pour about half a litre of broth over the turkey and cook as mentioned. When cooking uncovered, I also like to  flip the turkey to brown the bottom as well, not just the top, that's where some of the best meat lies. I also roast all the giblets neck etc along with the turkey and save it to make a Jamie Oliver gravy which can be found on YouTube. Honestly watch his gravy videos to make along with this turkey you won't regret it and it's so easy. Give my suggestions a try and put some love into the turkey and everyone will rave about I promise!

This recipe was amazing!  I was a little leery of straying from my old family recipe, but I wanted to put my own stamp on our Easter dinner this year.  This recipe helped me achieve that.  I actually stuck to the cooking time of my old family recipe, which I think added to the flavor and juiciness!  I cooked it for 1 hr at 350 and then 8 hrs at 200.  I turned it back up to 350 the last 15 minutes to brown it.

In an attempt to lessen my effort cooking on Thanksgiving, I used this recipe in addition to my tried-and-true.  I followed this recipe as written only making adjustments to accommodate my 17lb turkey.  I gave it two stars for simplicity but couldn't go higher because it was neither "juicy" or "succulent".   For me, the bird was tasteless; I will be sticking with my labor intensive tried-and-true.  It did, however, inspire me to drink mimosas while cooking which is a tradition I will keep :)

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!!  I did make a few tweaks only because of what I had.  I used white wine and half thyme leaves half ground time.  I also rubbed butter all over the turkey...cause butter makes everything better...right? :) This is the best turkey recipe out there...I have been using it for a few  years now and I'm always asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe...I'm forever grateful

I make this Turkey every year. I don't see a difference in letting it sit for 24 hours I feel this is unnecessary as it is juicy regardless (but if that's what you want to do I fully support you)  I substitute Pinot Grigio instead of the champagne and I butter the turkey before pouring the liquids on but growing up I remember my mom having to base the turkey so it didn't dry out and this turkey recipe doesn't need any basting just follow the instructions and put it in ... unwrap.... bake .... and done... I get rave reviews that it is the most MOIST (and I HATE this word) turkey. I have never like whole turkey but this has me eating turkey for days!!! DELISH

This is a perfect and simple recipe. Used fresh herb instead of dried herbs, and use good white wine to replaced champagne. I give it a ten stars.

Made this for my turkey loving hubby but in my electric roaster.

Brined the turkey in salt and brown sugar (2 cups of each and 4 gals water) for 6 hours then let sit over night. 

did everything listed above minus celery, put small butter quarters (size of the smallest lego) under the skin also rubbed spices under the skin. and used gingerale instead of champagne. did not use tin foil either. 

I preheated my roaster to 450, then turned down to 250 and cooked the turkey for 3 hours. (used therm. to ensure right cooking temp.) 

Turned out super yummy! using it again tomorrow :)

I was reluctant because there were so many things this recipe called for, but I usually follow the recipe the first time. It was juicy as I expected, but it wasn't bone dry either. I placed it in a cooking bag and added all of the ingredients. There is really a need for someone to give me a really good recipe for a moist turkey. I'll make sandwiches this week and turkey salad until it's gone. I'm not sure if I will try this again or not. Next year I may go back to cornish hens. I'm tired of dry turkeys.

Has anyone made this recipe with stuffing inside the turkey - minus putting vegetables and champagne in the cavity?  If yes, I would like to know how it turned out.  I am forbidden to make a turkey w/out the stuffing inside!

It was my first turkey in years and came out very juicy as stated on the title. I replaced the condiments with Essence which worked out great. I also used an oven bag which sped up the cooking process.

I made my first turkey this Thanksgiving and followed this recipe.  The turkey was awesome and came out super juicy!  I have never tasted a turkey like it.  The meat was falling off of the bone so well we barely needed a knife to cut the turkey.  I marinated the turkey (with all spices the recipe calls for) in the champagne and chicken broth the day before and baked for about 6 hours on 250 degrees.  Then, reheated it an hour before Thanksgiving dinner on 350.  I'd recommend this recipe to anyone.  You won't be disappointed!

With all the rave reviews I was hoping this would be spectacular. I was very disappointed. These ingredients did not make this recipe better.  The champagne was a wasted ingredient. It added nothing to the flavor. The vegetables did nothing. Next time I will just use the simple method of salt, pepper, herbs and broth. This recipe called for too much to put in the cavity.

After 40 years of cooking turkeys, I will never use another recipe again! I rubbed in the spices as given, but then stuffed the turkey as I normally would. I then rubbed olive oil and kosher salt on the outside of the turkey before covering it with the chicken broth and champaign. I covered it with foil as directed, but let the 16.5 lb turkey bake for 4 hrs before uncovering it for the last hour. It was perfect and the white meat melted in your mouth!

I put it all together as indicated and stuck it in the fridge for 15 hrs to marinate.  This same recipe indicated for a 15 lb bird worked for the 21lb turkey I used it on.  I used Andre Cold Duck (champagne/burgundy).  While it was cooking it smelled like italian bread was baking not turkey and made my husband think I was baking bread :).  The turkey was delicious and so flavorful and moist (white and dark meat) even upon reheat of white/dark meat the next day!  Definitely a keeper recipe that I intent to try for chicken and use next time for turkey.  Thanks!

I used the spice rub from this recipe and stuffed the turkey with vegetables and an orange.  Then I used the buttered breast and broth recipe from the Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way from this site.  Together they made a great pairing.  The flavors were subtle and the turkey came out very moist.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was loved by all. Turkey was not dry this year. I cooked it in a electric roaster. Wonderful. The downside was, I didn't have any leftovers.

We used this recipe for last Thanksgiving and it was incredibly J-U-I-C-Y! I think this was the best & juiciest turkey I've ever had! I think we did forget to use the orange...which this Thanksgiving we will definitely remember to add. My bf was in charge of most of the turkey-related jobs, and he also added some of the white zinfandel that we were drinking, it tasted delish. We also bought a pre-mixed turkey spice from our local gourmet market and used that along with rosemary, sage, parsley & thyme-it added more of a seasoned flavor that we loved!

Simply Incredible!! I followed the recipe exactly! Only used an oven bag instead of foil. (14.5 lb bird cooked in 1/2 time!) Everyone noticed the champagne but couldnt identify what made it! It was just wonderful!

This turkey turned out just like its title....very JUICY!  It was very good.  The only thing that made me not give it 5 starts was that there was no other flavor.  Even though I followed the recipe I could not taste the other ingredients.  But the turkey was very juicy.

I would like to thank Kristen so much for putting this recipe here so everyone can share it!  It was my first time cooking a turkey and everyone loved it!! I will be making it again for X-mas.  Juicy is right when you wrote the title of this recipe.  I was really happy with the outcome and so were my guests.  Thank you so much for sharing.  It was easy and tasted awesome!! by: Sonia Miami,Florida 11/2009

This was great so moist and juicy even after 5 hours of cooking... we did substitute the champagne for ginger ale but was still so good... and the gravy from the drippings to DIE for! We will be making this again in the near future.

First, this was my very first attempt at making a turkey, and boy am I glad I found this recipe!! My husband and I both agreed it was the most flavorful, juiciest turkey either of us had ever had! We used a little bird, just a 5 pounder since it was the two of us. Stuffed it with the recommended veggies, orange, and some garlic. I doused the cavity with the broth/champagne mixture, and also soaked the veggies in the mixture. I applied the juice pretty liberally, and it was worth it! Not only was this turkey juicy, but the flavor of the juice was fantastic! We used cheap champagne, too, just a bottle we picked up at the grocery store that was under 5 bucks! We will definitely be making this more than once a year. I didn't even touch the turkey gravy - didn't need it. Fabulous. Thank you!!!

Delicious! Made for Thanksgiving 2018 and it was the most moist white meat I’ve ever eaten. The top of the turkey was brown and looked amazing. I subbed ginger ale for champagne as others had because I had it in the fridge. I also melted butter, added spices, and rubbed the cavity as well as separated the skin from the breast and rubbed the butter mixture there as well. I used apple in lieu of orange. I would use this recipe again.

I have used this recipe for many years, and I always forget to review it. First of all how could a turkey with an entire bottle of champagne be bad?!? It is always tasty, always flavorful, never make our turkey any other way!

I was a little concerned because all of the salt is in the cavity of the bird and usually salt/pepper the outside as well as the inside but the turkey came out moist and juicy and tasted fantastic (full disclosure: I used a Trader Joe's pre-brined turkey).  I agree with other reviews that the champagne made the drippings have a sour flavor but we dumped them in a pan with the onions and celery, cooked it down and made a sauce that my brother-in-law loved and ate over rice.  My mom, who is not a big fan of herbs, said it was the best turkey she's ever had.

This was amazing!!  Used this recipe to make my first turkey ever, and it came out incredibly juicy. 
Couple things I did differently from the recipe: dry brined it in a mixture of salt and baking powder (one cup salt, 2 tbsp BP and used less than half of this to brine) for over 15 hours. And basted the turkey every 35 minutes, plus near the end poured melted butter all over the skin. 

All the meat came out very moist and full of flavor.

This year was my first year hosting Thanksgiving, and I was a bit nervous about making my first turkey.  When I came across this recipe and read all the reviews, I felt that I could and should trust it.  I am so happy I did!  The turkey came out sooooo Juicy and flavorful!!!  Everyone complimented me on how delicious the turkey was.  I don't cook too much at home, so I think it impressed everyone even more.  I did marinate it for 24 hours with the chicken broth, champagne, and herbs.  I put the vegetables inside the turkey just before putting it into the oven.  My husband who doesn't like turkey much, really was impressed and loved it so much that he wants me to make the turkey from now on and use this recipe every year!

Definitely moist! I stuffed my bird with herbs and dressing, but the liquid and foil tent method was really effective. I used the leftover bottles of white wine from the fridge plus chicken stock. The white meat was so tender and moist it made the meal and leftovers a joy! Plus the gravy I made from the pan drippings was EPIC!

This is super easy to make, easy ingredients to find in your pantry/kitchen. The dry herbs are commonly used ones and the champagne (sparkling wine) was an inexpensive prosecco. The only change I made was added butter mixed with the dry ingredients under the turkey breast skin. I also added dry ingredient rub into the cavity and all over the turkey and poured champagne and chicken broth the evening before so it can marinate in frig. Prior to roasting, I added the veggies and orange wedges and the rest of bubbly & broth. Turkey came out perfect and not dry at all. I got rave reviews from family and I will use this same recipe on a roasted chicken next. This an easy delicious turkey recipe.

I will never make a turkey any other way.  This was by far the best turkey that's come out of my oven.  Made the seasoning rub and cavity mix the night before.  On turkey day, I put it together with the bouillon and wine  (I used Italian  Moscato) and cooked it. Wow!

This is my new go-to recipe!  We seasoned the turkey and let it marinade in the champagne and chicken broth overnight.  We added the vegetables just prior to cooking.  We used a 16.25 lb bird and initial baking time was approximately 3 hours and 15 minutes.  The thigh temp was about  160 when we removed the foil, and it got up to 180 in the last hour of baking.  Everyone raved about it.

Followed the recipe and we love it.  I've made it twice and two of my daughters have made it and my sister-in-law also.  The turkey is so tender and the broth makes the best gravy.  I've told several people about this recipe so I've lost track of who has all made it.  I highly recommend this recipe??????

Best turkey we've ever had!  We replaced the champagne with white wine (we didn't have champagne).   It was still outstanding.  We highly recommend this recipe.

I was nervous about finding a great recipe as I have only cooked a turkey a couple of times before. This recipe was delicious and easy! I did use the dry rub as the recipe calls for. Another reviewer was right when they said that the broth and champagne will take the seasoning off.  I used half of the seasoning, poured on the liquid, and then put the remaining seasoning on. I sauteed the onion.  I also cooked the turkey in a bag.  I cooked a 20 lb turkey for 3 hours without opening the bag.  The thermometer was at 183 degrees and 180 is the magic number for turkey. It browned beautifully in the bag.  Everyone loved the turkey and even the white meat was moist. The gravy turned out delicious.  I will make this one again for sure! Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe as written and it came out great. The meat fell off of the bone. I did have to double everything as I was making a 45 pounder.

The turkey certainly lived up to its name - "juicy" - but this is not a good recipe if you want to use the turkey drippings in typical savory gravy.  The champagne keeps the bird moist, but has an almost metallic taste.  I was glad to have had a Plan B.  Additionally, because of all of the vegetables placed in the cavity of the bird, I think the cooking time is a little short.   I would not use this recipe again.

Best turkey I've made. I started with a dry brine (3 parts salt, 1 part baking powder) overnight. I made a few small tweaks--omitted the salt due to dry brine; stuffed the bird with 1 big shallot, 2 celery stalks, 1 orange, 1 apple, 1 onion, whatever didn't fit inside went in roasting pan. Also used just shy of one bottle champagne, because the cook needed a drink.

I think this recipe has potential, but it didn't work out how I would have hoped.  We found that all the champagne and broth at the bottom of the pan burnt to black bits stuck to the pan, the liquid dried up so we had nothing to use for gravy and it was very difficult to clean afterwards.  What did we do wrong?  Does it make sense to replenish the liquid while cooking?

Turkey was so nice and moist and tasted delicious. I made this last year for both thanksgiving and Christmas and it was definitely a hit. I'm making it again this year for both Christmas and thanksgiving. I must say that I did twerk a little bit by adding my traditional Haitian seasonings to it, but overall followed to recipe.  Best turkey I've ever had.

The only thing I did different was to tent the aluminium foil over the turkey rather than completely wrap it.  I wrapped it once and, for some reason, all the juices dried up.  This is the BEST turkey recipe.  I use it every year.

i've been following this recipe for the last 4 years and it has not once failed me.  It's super easy and delicious, I substituted the champagne a couple times with gingerale and it  works amazing. I precook some of the carrots and celery and then stuff it because if you put it in raw the veggies it comes out undercooked. I put the rest of the carrots and celeries in the base pan so it soaks up all the juices and that ends up extremely flavorful and yummy, sometimes I add squash or potatoes its just divine.

I made the family turkey this Thanksgiving which was the first time  I had made one in years.  The last time I made one it came out 'just ok' and that was  using a somewhat elaborate recipe from a very well known female celebrity chef.   So, I do admit ,I had a lot of trepidation making one this year; I actually felt like I was about to embark upon an experiment.  But, this time around,  using  this recipe, my turkey BROWNED BEAUTIFULLY and tasted WONDERFUL! .  I My turkey was a fresh one and just over 15 lbs. It did have a timer and I was just about to remove the turkey  from the oven when the timer popped. The only changes I made was to use fresh parsley (since I had fresh), eliminate the rosemary since I am not a fan, place some butter beneath the turkey skin before cooking, and basting the turkey a few times after  removing the foil.   My family loved it and all they could say is that it was 'unbelievable' and it really was. So, thanks for this recipe and highly recommend it to others!  It will be used for all my future turkeys.

omg!!!!  This recipe is awesome...this was my first time making a turkey and I was so nervous.  But this is hands down the best turkey I've ever had!!!!  I followed the recipe directly with a little tweak and it was perfect...the only change I made was I shoved garlic in between the skin and meat about 4 cloves and after I poured the champagne and broth I rubbed it with more of the herb mixture that I used in the cavity.  Will definitely be using this recipe again!  Thank you for making it easy :)

We had 18 family members over for Thanksgiving and I had the privilege of making the turkey this year. It was unanimous that this was the best turkey our family has ever had, so I am now nominated to make it every year. So happy I chose this recipe, it could not have tasted better!

Great recipe and easy...you can prep the ingredients ahead of time and store them in the fridge for quick stuffing and cooking the day of.  Although I'm an experienced cook this was the first time I've ever had to fix the Thanksgiving turkey.  I was nervous but it came out perfectly moist and delicious!  I used an oven bag instead of  the foil. The only other changes I made were to double the dry ingredients for the seasoning rub and to add fresh parsley, rosemary, thyme and sage to the stuffing veggies.  I put the dry herbs on first, then covered the turkey in the champagne (I used prosecco) and broth, then gave the turkey a light coating of olive oil and finished it off with a sprinkling of the remaining dry seasonings.  My 18 lb bird was ready and perfect in about 3 hours, 20 minutes.

I followed the directions to a T.  When it said to pour the champagne and stock over the turkey, I was like what the heck? All the aromatics is gonna come off! And it sure did! Not only that, the amount of salt in the receipe is not enough to add flavor to the turkey, so it was bland!

I thought I would try a new twist from the same turkey in a bag I normally cook at Thanksgiving.  Can't say this was as awesome as others seem to think.  It was good but I will go back to my traditional recipe next Thanksgiving.

Rave reviews from everyone at our early Thanksgiving dinner!  I made it exactly as indicated in the recipe and it came out perfectly moist and well-flavored.  I had a 22-lb. turkey, and didn't need to change anything about the quantity of the other ingredients, just the cooking time.  I especially love this recipe because it has no added fat, and you would never know the difference.  This is the second year in a row I have made this recipe, and I doubt I will ever want to make it any other way.

I made this turkey for my very first time about 6 years ago and I haven't stopped making it since! This has been the juiciest turkey I have ever tasted! Marinating it over night is the absolute best! It stays moist and juicy for days!! Makes amazing sandwiches too!!

I have made this 3 years in a row now. Everyone now comes to our house because of the turkey! It has always came out perfect. Make sure you baste if you want it to be juicy! Use the drippings for good gravy all you need to do is add flower and the flavor is there.

We've made our turkey using this recipe two years in a row now. Both times the turkey came out amazing! The turkey was tender, juicy, and flavorful! Literally fall off the bone tender! The only thing we changed was we used an oven bag instead of covering with foil. We uncovered the turkey for the last 45 minutes or so to get a nice brown color. While we loved this turkey, the only negative was that we weren't able to use the turkey drippings since we drenched the turkey with champagne and chicken broth.

I left out the orange slices --I don't like fruit with meat--and have substituted white wine for the champagne...  With champagne is great, with white wine is great.  Makes fantastic herbed leftovers!

Love this recipe!  it's become our favorite recipe for turkey on Thanksgiving.  The only thing I do differently is that I cut back on the rosemary and sage as I find them to be a little strong for my personal taste (you will love it regardless).  I was thinking of using a roasting bag this year so I don't have to mess with the foil.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2014 and it was great!  Seems like there are so many ways to make a turkey and I have tried a lot of recipes, but now I have the turkey I am going to make every year! Can't wait to make again this year.

Great recipe.  I didn't have champagne, so I substituted 2 bottles ginger ale and 1 diet coke.  I know, coke is weird, except it's not.   It adds sweetness and flavor.  (I thin store-bought bbq sauce with it and it makes a great basting sauce for bbqued meat.)

The turkey was tender and moist and delicious.

I have made this turkey a few times because my wife has fallen in love with it. I follow the directions and it is fail safe. The turkey is always juicy and delicious. Use the juices for the gravy. It is a little bit sweet but amazing on the turkey.

This was my first turkey to cook.  I used Sprite instead of champagne.  It turned out great and was tender and juicy,  My family cleaned the bones!

Although I have been a member of this site for years and regularly use the recipes on it, this is my first review - because this recipe is AMAZING! I have cooked turkey before and it was good (nothing to write a review about), but last Thanksgiving I was entertaining for ten people and had to prepare the biggest turkey of my life (17lbs!) and I was scared. Coming across this recipe changed EVERYTHING. I followed the directions exactly - didn't change a thing. The turkey came out perfectly, was a gorgeous golden color, tasted absolutely delicious, and everyone at the table not only asked for seconds (sometimes thirds) but wanted the recipe. If you a have turkey to roast, look no further than this recipe!

This didn't work for me.  Fortunately, I made it a day in advance, so I have time to come up with a backup plan.

I used this recipe for its high regards in making my first Thanksgiving turkey!. It was delicious. I used a 20 pound turkey…cooked in a bag in a roaster…used butter to spread the herbs in the cavity and under the skin. The gravy from the dripping was AWESOME!

This was amazing and super simple! Hands down, the juiciest turkey with the least amount of effort. Make sure to use a DEEP baking/roasting dish as the liquid really bubbles up. Same goes for foil tent over the turkey, keep it crimped on the pan to avoid an in oven mess! I'm going to try a bag for this reason next time.

This was a great turkey. We had an 18 pounder, and we cooked it 4 hours, uncovered the lat hour. I suggest breast down for the first 2 hours, covered, then flip on its back, cover it, then last hour uncovered breast up. I did not have sage, used fresh parsley, and only used a quqrter orange.  But it was juicy!

Simply the best turkey I have made in the twenty years I have been making them!  I had a 16 pound turkey, followed the recipe exactly, but needed five hours total, with four covered and one foil pulled back. Perfect!

Wow!  Best, juiciest turkey I have ever had.  My guests were shocked at how moist the breast was.  I cooked in a brown bag (cause I'm lazy about cleanup) and added a bread stuffing, and it took me 3.5 hours to cook an 11 lbs bird.  This is my new go to turkey recipe!

This is the best turkey I have ever made.  I marinated the turkey in the champagne overnight.  The pan drippings made the best gravy!  My whole family loved it.  The only modification I made was to not add the rosemary because I don't like it.

This is the absolute best turkey I've ever eaten!  I followed the recipe except that I left out the champagne and used extra broth, but only because I forgot to buy the champagne.  I worried that all the ingredients stuffed inside would keep the turkey from getting done all the way through, but it actually roasted faster than it should have for it's weight.  Everyone loved it and I will be making it again and again, and not just for Thanksgiving.  I don't think we can wait a whole year!  I may try what one reviewer did and marinate the turkey in champagne and broth.  To the few reviewers who didn't give this five stars, you must have done something wrong.  Even my son, who has never liked turkey, gobbled it up!

I was so hesitant about using champagne on my Thanksgiving turkey, but I am so glad I did!  It was so juicy and flavorful.  I followed the directions exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you for sharing it.

I used this recipe to make a 24 lb. turkey on Thanksgiving.  I used a bag to roast and substituted ginger ale for the champagne as another cook suggested.   It turned out wonderful! ? Tender & juicy - falling off the bone...and the gravy was amazing (and plentiful)!

This turned out awesome for me! I used a roaster oven and had a 20 lb. turkey. I used a Tom Douglas Turkey Rub in place of the herbs - they had the same herbs pretty much. I buttered the turkey inside and out before putting the rub on then I used a can of chicken broth and the bottle of champagne. I don't usually care much for turkey but this was the best I have tasted - it was so, so moist.I plan on doing this next year - maybe throughout the year. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I seriously would have given this 10 stars if I could have. This is, hands down, the best turkey I have ever had/made. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out wonderfully. I am not a dark meat eater, I don't generally enjoy it, but this recipe made ALL the meat so flavorful it was AMAZING. The drippings/stock from the turkey make an amazing gravy too! Hello school lunch memories! The next day I had some shredded turkey along with the left over gravy, over mashed potatoes. I was 9 years old again. Thank you!

This was my first time cooking a turkey...and it was AWESOME!!! I used ginger-ale instead of champagne and I used an oven bag. I injected the turkey with some of the ginger-ale and chicken broth and allowed it to marinate over night. The turkey was so moist, the meat was literally falling off the bone!

Used on two turkey breast with good results in that the meat was moist.  As previously reviewed by someone else, I marinated it overnight in the broth and champagne.  However, honestly, I did not think all the spices and vegetables really was worth all the trouble as the amount of flavoring that was infused into the meat was minimal for all the work.  Likely could have had similar results by also just using the broth, keeping the bird covered during baking and not overbaking to have a moist meat in the end.

I used this recipe loosely..I usually don't comment if I don't follow the instructions as written. Had to make an exception this time.  When I went to the grocery store to get the last of the items I needed it was too early to buy the champagne.  I decided to use sparkling grape juice.  By the time I got home I decided that the juice may be too sweet so added some apple cider vinegar. Besides that I followed the recipe and this was the best turkey I have ever had.  I am sending this one to everyone.

The BEST juiciest turkey I ever made and ate!  The family absolutely LOVED it!  I didn't have oranges so I used several tangelo's instead.  Followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. New way to cook turkeys and I am gonna try the ingredients with a baked chicken.  Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious and very juicy, so much so, in fact, the turkey literally fell apart!  I rubbed some of the spice mix on the outside after pouring the champagne in the cavity and on the outside.  I added some salt as well!  Our turkey was 20 pounds and was done in 3 and 1/2 hours.   I will make this again!

Tried this recipe yesterday. This was really good! It's claim to be "juicy" far exceeded my expectation. My family wants a repeat for Christmas. I've recommended it already to several people.

I am so thankful to come across this recipe.  Since my Mother hasn't been feeling too well I volunteered to make the thanksgiving turkey this year, never have made one before and was oh so scared!  This turkey turned out amazing and was very juicy and tender.  I did use sparkling cider since I had that on hand and figured it would be pretty close.  I had a 22 lb turkey and I ended up cooking it 3 hours then removed foil for 30 minutes to brown, then covered again for another 1 1/2 hours for a total of 5 hours.  I'm already looking forward to Christmas just to make this again!

Awesome.  I just used the champagne, oranges, and salt and pepper because I forgot to review the recipe before I put it in a baking bag.  Made wonderful gravy. Moist turkey. Yummy.

Okay, I read it, and I bought the sparkling wine, and I did it!  I'm so glad I did-just like everyone said here-it was the moistest turkey ever with such great taste-I used the drippings to make a great gravy-even better than the usual gravy.  What a hit-thanks for the recipe-it's now a family favorite and I just love saying that's it's "Champagne Turkey!"

I usually brine my turkeys so had some second thoughts about 2 hours into cooking time but I needn't have worried.  This turkey was so juicy and flavorful that my dad couldn't carve it fast enough.  My entire family crowded around him and ate it off the plate and, after I shooed them all away, they picked the carcass clean.  I followed the directions exactly with an 18 lb. bird - needed a little extra cooking time for such a large bird but that is all.  This is now my go-to recipe.  I'll try it for a chicken next.

This is my first time ever making a turkey and I am 60years old...we always had potluck and someone always made turkey. So I was given a turkey and I found this fabulous recipe and I will always make it as it is so juicy and delicious. I saw a lady say she used ginger ale so I did also and I used a turkey baking bag dusted with flour inside 1 tablespoon to prevent bag bursting. Thank you to the one who gave this my first turkey recipe..I love it. God bless you. Trish.

I've only done Thanksgiving 3 times because my turkey hasn't ever turned out very good. This year I thought I'd give it 1 more try and with this super easy recipe, my turkey was awesome. Thank you so much Kristen for sharing this great recipe.

I have to admit, I have been trying to make a moist turkey for years. FINALLY this year I was extremely pleased with the final product. The champagne is what makes it. I didn't believe it at first but sure enough it is very true. I will continue to make all my turkeys following this recipe!

This is the third year that I made this turkey for Thanksgiving and the first year I made it in my roaster (I have uploaded a picture). I get rave reviews on this turkey every time.  The roaster worked out great.  Mine turkey came out fall off the bone juicy in the roaster even though I didn't cover it in foil or place it in a baking bag.  This is my go to turkey recipe for life!

The flavor & moisture were perfect, and the gravy I made from the drippings was amazing! I did make a few changes though: I cooked it in an oven bag as other reviewers had done, omitted parsley & used a tsp of black pepper instead of lemon pepper. We managed to forget to put celery on the shopping list, so I added a little celery salt to the herb mix as well. I rubbed the herbs under the skin as another reviewer suggested, and I brushed the skin with bacon grease. I also added an apple to the stuffing veggies. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks Kirsten!

Absolutely fantastic! The gravy was to die for and so abundant we'll be freezing lots for another time. The only thing I omitted was the orange due to claims of citrus taste in other reviews, but it was worth it. Juiciest turkey ever! This will be my Standard Recipe for years to come. Now if only I could find a good stuffing recipe....

LOVED this recipe. It IS the most moist turkey I've ever made and the seasons and taste are NOT overwhelming so it's a great dish when paired with heavier side dishes. Also I've had a great time making other recipes with the leftovers and I haven't had to worry about the taste changing the recipes.

All my family said that this was the best turkey they ever had!  It had so much flavor and even the white meat was juicy!  I also did a brine two days before and then a marinade the day before and I think that helped too.  FANTASTIC!

I made this turkey yesterday..  It was great! The only thing I changed was that we didn't have any champagne.. So in addition to the chicken broth, my husband decided to add a bottle of Mikes Light Hard Lemonade to it... This turkey was moist and very flavor-filled.  I did find thaqt it had to cook longer than 3 hours, and I upped the temperature after a while, but we were in no rush to eat do it was not an issue.  Thanks so much for this recipe, I will definitely make it again next year!

It turned out really moist and delicious. I rubbed the outside with olive oil and shot up the bird with a butter/tony chachere's injection. Since I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to turkey's I suggest that if you want to attempt this make sure that you buy a thermometer and check the turkey before you pull it out instead of following the recipe time. I goofed and pulled the turkey out before it was done. It didn't ruin it but I had to put it back in the oven and it turned out delicious anyways!

The recipe is good, but I think there should be a warning about the alcohol fumes that come off of it while it is cooking.  I think that the champagne in the recipe creates this intense fumes.  Granted, I always tear up when cutting onions but I had to leave the kitchen during a huge part of the cooking because of the fumes.

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! This was my first turkey and it came out succulent and flavorful. I followed the instructions pretty close except that I brined the turkey the night before and added fresh rosemary, thyme, and sage that I stuffed inside. Everyone loved it! My boyfriend is already asking when I can make him turkey again!

This turkey was fabulous... I have been hosting Thanksgiving for many years and this had to be the best turkey I have ever cooked. I cook my turkey breast down on top of extra vegetables... then flip it for the last 30 Minutes to brown. Can't wait for the turkey, cream cheese and cranberry sandwich today...

I chose this recipe for my first family Thanksgiving and it was perfect.  I added cheese cloth to the turkey to hold the herbs on the skin when pouring the broth and champagne over it.  I also added celery stalks under the bird to keep it off the direct heat of the pan.  I got rave reviews!  Thanks Kirsten!

This WAS THE BEST TURKEY EVER! I've made a lot of turkeys in the past but none have ever been as moist and juicy as this one. Looks like the secret is to cover the turkey and let it steam to keep it from drying out.

WOW! Never thought a turkey could be this moist and delicious. My nephew, (who never compliments anything,) actually said it was the best turkey he has ever had. It was the first dish to go! We did not do the veggies or seasonings, but instead filled it with dressing. We used the champagne and broth on the outside and followed the recipe on cooking it to the t. It was absolutely delicious and really moist. Will forever be using this recipe. Thank you Kirsten!

It was alright.  The Turkey  was falling apart tender but didn't brown well. Think I'll go back to the directions on the Turkey.

We did not care for this recipe at all. Something about the oranges made the flavors fight with each other.  It was better the 2nd day once the citrus wore off a bit. I am not a seasoned turkey cooker so im going to take some of the blame here. This was my third turkey ever. Im still learning. Next year i'm going deep fryer.

We were excited about this recipe and gave it a try. Unfortunately we were disappointed. The turkey had to cook more than an hour longer than it should have, the gravy was sweet from the champagne, and the meat was rather bland....no seasonings. We followed the directions exactly.

I too made this using Ginger-Ale.  I used a baking brown and serve bag and it was great. The turkey was falling apart  it was soo moist and didn’t look as pretty, but that’s probably my fault for using the bag instead of the foil. 
I kept the drippings after using some to make a big pan of gravy, and used those for soup (after skimming off the fat)- and it was great too!

This is a great Turkey recipe and it will always please you and your guests. I made it without sage or an orange just because I didn't feel like going back to the store to get these items. It is simple and fun and tastes great.

I need to invest in a better turkey rack for next time.  That way, the bird will brown more uniformly. The bird came out very juicy and delicious.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was wonderful! So juicy and moist and the stock made a fantastic gravy! My turkey was 20 lbs. so I increased the cooking time a little bit. I also used white moscato wine instead of champagne. I loved this recipe but had trouble finding it again on the website because I didn’t save it first! Finally found it and saved it and wrote it in my recipe journal as well. I will use this again and again!

This recipe is truly outstanding! The turkey cooks slowly in a delicious vapor so that the meat is so tender you don't need a knife to cut it. I first used this recipe in 2016 because I needed a gluten-free recipe and now it's the only one I use. Thank you so much for sharing!

We all loved this recipe.  
I added a spoon and half of salt instead of just 1, and I rubbed the turkey with butter in and out with the salt.  I cooked it in a bag.  The lemon pepper and the sparkling made the sauce taste out of this world and so so juicy.

Phenomenal recipe. The one change I made was I brined the turkey with salt, brown sugar and spices for 48 hours. Thanksgiving morning I followed the recipe as directed, slow cooked the turkey at 225 for about 3 hours, turned it up to 350 for about an hour and then finished it off at 450 for about 45 minutes. My best turkey yet.

Holy moly this was the BEST TURKEY EVER! Only problem I had was no champagne so I substituted 2 cups of apple cider.  Not the vinegar, just the kind you drink chilled.  I rubbed the spices all over and left it uncovered in the fridge overnight. Also used fresh rosemary in the cavity because I didn’t have dried. Everyone commented on how juicy it was and my picky stepson was shocked when he tasted it asked me what I used to make it taste so good because the other turkey he had over by his mom’s house was plain and dry.  This recipe will not disappoint and was super easy to make.

I followed this recipe to. The. Letter. No deviation, no substitution. First I made sure my oven cooks at 350 with a temperature gauge. It does. From there I followed every direction without question. My turkey cooked for a full hour more after pulling away the foil, I had a pop-out temperature plug inserted in the turkey, decided to blindly trust it  after checking the temperature with a digital reader, and boom. Perfection. The loveliest part of pouring the champagne was giving myself a glass and celebrating the beginning of the end of the struggle.  This will go in my rotation forever. Kids complimented me, My friend’s toddler who doesn’t like turkey ate it, and the men loved the moist meat with the crispy skin. Not a dry bite in the house!  I’m sure there are other great recipes out there, but I chose this one because I didn’t change the heat from 425 to 350, no babysitting, and I was intrigued by the champagne. So glad I did this. My guests loved the novelty of using champagne and it was a fun conversation.

Made it tonight for 2019 Thanksgiving after finding via The Google. I had to join this website to leave a review how crazy awesome this was. Hands down best turkey I’ve ever made, and same with my friends. Only thing I added was brine the night prior in a mix I got from Publix (essentially salt and the herb mix here). Then made gravy from juices. It was out of control good. Years of generations past making bone dry turkey is over.

My first roasted turkey came out amazing thanks to this recipe!! I cooked a 13.5lb turkey for 2.5 hr +30min and my breast was a little dry but the dark meat fell off the bone. The flavor is nice and herb-ey with a hint of sweetness from the oranges and champagne. I followed the instructions exactly except I added a little kosher salt onto the skin after I poured over with the broth and booze. Thank you for posting!!

Perfectly Succulent! Best turkey I’ve ever had! Followed to the tee, except I didn’t have the champagne. But even without that the flavor and juiciness was the BEST!! 5 star hands down! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful juicy recipe! The cooking method and juices made such a wonderful turkey. However, the herbs were very strong and next time would alter the spices a bit. Definitely one of the best turkeys I've had.

I didn't do the lemon pepper but changed out for a plain pepper.
This was the best turkey I've had and yes I've had a deep fried turkey.  This was a succulent tasting turkey and all my left overs were used for turkey quesadillas and turkey noodle soup.

I've tried many turkey recipes but this one caught my eye (any recipe that calls for wine or spirits sounds interesting).  I followed the directions exactly but put it on my grill for the cooking time specified.  It was beautifully brown, superbly moist (even my picky friend commented on the moistness), and the gravy was the delicious.  I gave the recipe to my sister and she's used it ever since, too.

Great recipe! I didnt have oranges, so I substituted a good splash of orange juice and only used half of the champagne. There were plenty of fluids, the Turkey still came out moist and tasting great!

This was by far the juiciest, best turkey I've ever made. I added fresh rosemary, sage and thyme to the cavity and mixed the rub with olive oil. It's our new favourite way to make turkey.

I was looking forward to this turkey because of all the great reviews, but I must say I was extremely disappointed. While it WAS very moist, it was very bland, without that familiar  WONDERFUL yummy Turkey taste. In addition, the drippings where awfull with a bitter taste  and I did not  get to make the gravy my family loves so much.  Glad I tried this ahead of time.  it was a waste of time. Never again.

Super quick and easy to prep! Was a little more sweet than I prefer for a turkey, but with some gravy or cranberry sauce is outstanding!

Juiciest turkey ever! I will be cooking my turkeys this way from now on. 
The only negative thing I can say is my family did not like the flavor of the gravy made from the broth with the champagne .

Juicy turkey? More like raw turkey.  There’s no way you can fully cook a turkey at 350 degrees. Your recipe is for a 15 lb and I have a 9lb. 3 hours and a half later, mine is still raw and dry!! What a waste. Been playing around with the heat now and keep cooking it and check on it. Not to mention everything is soggy as heck.

I make turkey every year 38 years, but this was truly my favorite recipe, moist, succulent, flavorful.  This is now my go to recipe, even my son was munching on the veggies inside, and the gravy the best gravy ever.  I used Prosecco instead of Champagne, thank you for this new tradition for my family.  Just popped another bird in the oven because there were no leftovers.  Nummy!

I hate making turkey because the meat is always dry. However, this recipe changed everything. I made this for thanksgiving and it was awesome. I did put the turkey in brine for about 3 hours first. It was the juices turkey I have ever made. We had 12 guests and everyone kept commenting on how juicy the turkey was.  Usually we have enough turkey leftover for two weeks of sandwiches, but this time  there was only enough left over to make 2 sandwiches.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Wasn't sure about changing my method of roasting a turkey after more than 50 years of doing it as I always have.  However, I guess I was bored or something so I tried this recipe.  Surprise, it was very nice, great flavor and very moist, family enjoyed it very much.  I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic flavor, juiciest turkey, easy recipe!  This is only the second time I’ve ever cooked a turkey and it was foolproof!  My mom and sister said I can be the official turkey cook for now on.  Lol.  Husband, son, daughter, mom, sister and I all thought it not only tasted fantastic but looked beautiful too.  I was apprehensive about the champagne but couldn’t even taste it nor in the gravy.  No marinating needed.  Thank you so much for the recipe my family can enjoy for years and pass on too!

I'm 50 years old and have never cooked a turkey for Thanksgiving.  There has never been a need to because I make an excellent ham and my husband usually deep fries a turkey but this year was different, my daughter cooked the ham and making the turkey fell on my list this year.  I chose this recipe because it said "Juicy" turkey.  I can't eat a dry turkey (which is probably why I never tried to cook one).  I followed the recipe to a "T" with just a few minor changes.  I added a pear (because I had one that was going to go bad), I rubbed the dry ingredients on the outside of the turkey, and I cooked it in an oven bag.  It was delicious and I gave Kirsten and her family all the credit!  My family told me to definitely keep the recipe.  Thanks for the video, it was a big help.

This was my first thanksgiving Turkey I made alone.  I made a 20 pound turkey and it came out amazing. It was the most moist turkey I’ve ever had. You can’t go wrong making this turkey. I cooked my turkey for six hours I think this will be the new yearly Recipe

Came out dry. Took longer than 3 hours plus the extra browning hour to cook. The legs were moist though. The gravy I made from the drippings was extremely salty. I didn’t add any salt to it either. Wouldn’t make again.

I cooked it in the bag and then took it out for the last 30’ and basted with juices. I used Prosecco instead of champagne.
The meat was savory and tender, even the breast.

I decided to try this recipe for this years Thanksgiving Dinner with my family. I was skeptical about the juiciness. I followed the exact recipe as listed, however, I did marinate the turkey in the chicken broth and champagne for 24 hours the day before cooking. The day of cooking I rubbed the seasoning inside the cavity, outside and under the skin. The end result was an juicy turkey cooked perfectly to touch. 

I would recommend this recipe with the modification in marinating the turkey the day night before and rubbing the seasoning inside the cavity, outside and under the skin. You won’t regret it!

Very easy and very moist.  I made it almost exactly as written.   I didn’t have a full 750 ml of white wine so I just added chicken stock to my bottle to fill it up.  Also, I would check to see if my lemon pepper seasoning contained salt and if it did I wouldn’t add the additional salt. I’m going to try a lemon next time just because I always have them on hand.

Every year we try a new turkey recipe to find the one that will produce the perfect turkey.  We found it!  Still juicy today as leftovers!  Notes to share: With a 26 pound turkey, it took nearly 7 hours to cook, with the heavy foil wrapped around it and the aromatics stuffed inside. Use a dry champagne - no sweetness, lots of juice to make for gravy. About two hours before being done, took out aromatics, stuffed turkey with dressing, smeared butter on skin and loosened the foil so the skin would brown up.  Beautiful presentation!  We did not need all of the herbs on the skin - this was too much for us.  But, everyone loved it and now we don't have to search for the perfect turkey recipe!

This was my first time making the Thanksgiving turkey and I am so glad I used this recipe!! It was so moist and flavorful. Everyone was complimenting me on it. I will remember this for future Thanksgivings. The only thing I wish I had made was a good stuffing. Thank you for sharing

OMG!  This recipe is fantastic. My turkey was so moist and tender. I added olive oil in the top mixed with the spices from the recipe and 15 mins before taking it out and  I added a glaze that I bought from William Sonoma. I made the gravy from the turkey juices-every thing was fabulous. Thank you for sharing.

Perfect recipe. Followed directions as written. Prepped turkey the night prior, 16lb turkey cooked covered for 3 hours uncovered 1 hour, perfect. Gravy was delicious. I boiled the neck, giblets etc with onion celery and spices all day, then strained the broth and used it for the gravy. I will always use this recipe!

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!! It was so moist and had great flavor. I also rubbed the herb seasoning on the skin.  Other than that I went exactly by the recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I made this yesterday and it turned out great, very moist! I had a 24 lb. turkey and so chose to use an oven bag.  First I slathered butter all over the beast, sprinkled on the seasonings and added the broth and champagne to the bag.  The spices adhered reasonably well.  Ended up roasting for about 4 hours.  As far as one reviewer saying the gravy was sweet, I can only surmise they used a sweet champagne.  Use a brut, or dry champagne and you should have no problem.  Even microwaving the left overs for lunch today, the meat was still moist.  This is a fail proof moist turkey recipe.

Hands down this was the most moist and flavorful turkey I have ever made.    I prepped the turkey the night before.   I mixed all the herbs with a softened stick of butter and rubbed it outside the skin, under the skin and in the cavity ( this helped the herbs stay in place when you pour the broth and champagne over it).  It stayed ready to go in the refrigerator over night and I just popped it in the over Thanksgiving mironing.  I put it in a 450 degree preheated oven, and immediately turn it down to 325 degrees for the duration.   I browned it first ( about 35/40 min) then tented for the remaining time ( 7 1/2 hours for a 30 pound turkey).  I basted maybe once and hour.   Amazing !

I made this as stated except I used a 4 cup box of Imagine low sodium veggie broth and no champagne. I also didn't have lemon pepper so I used some black pepper, maybe half a tap. It turned out super moist and good. Everyone thought it was excellent. Maybe next time I'll spring for the champagne.

So juicy, so delicious! I marinated the turkey for about 18-20 hours prior to cooking and ended up cooking it uncovered for 90 minutes instead of the 60 because it needed it. I was afraid it would come out dry but it was PERFECT! I will definitely make it again

I made the turkey following the recipe to a “T” and it was beyond delicious!!  The turkey breast was so moist must of us didn’t even put gravy on it!   Did someone say GRAVY?  OMG the gravy was out of this world!!!!

I usually brine my bird, but this year the bird I bought was pre-brined and I was very nervous about not brining it myself!  Turns out this turkey was 10x better than any turkey I’ve made over the last 25 years!  Thanks for sharing this scrumptious recipe!!!!!  (eating to the kitchen for a turkey sandwich right now!!0

I have to agree with everyone else--this turkey was delicious! The meat fell off the bone it was so tender and moist! I had an 11 pound turkey and cooked it in a brown in bag for 4 hours. Even in the brown in bag, it turned a beautiful golden brown.  Family members argued over who got to take some of the leftovers home! I didn't have time to make gravy from the drippings but saved them to try it tomorrow. Anyone have any ideas on how to do this? I used cheap champagne from the local big box store and it worked fine! Delicious, will be using this for potluck dinners!

Made this last year and usually there is leftover turkey but this 21 pounder was gobbled up. The white meat was juicy. I did this in a Oster Roaster cooker and it came out really good.

The was the most delicious, moist turkey!! I couldn’t get my husband to stop eating it has he was carving! I made a couple changes based on what I had - I used lemons instead of oranges, white whine instead of champagne, 3 stalks of celery and 2 carrots sliced for the inside. After I rubbed and filled the cavity, we used unsalted butter all under the skin, and used some of the herbs on the outside after covering with wine. It was AMAZING, thank you so much for this recipe!! Can’t wait to make again

I made this as my first Turkey 2 years ago and my mom is in town this weekend from Florida so weare having an early Thanksgiving dinner today and I could t wait to make it for her. I would t let her do anythi g because I wanted to do it all (well except get the stuff out if the butt...that's just gross) and have her taste it. She is the one who always has to cook when we are together for family events so this time it was my turn. Cant wait for her to taste it. Followed the recipe to a T except we are cooking an electric roaster oven. Last time it was delicious!!

This was my first time making a turkey (two actually) for Friendsgiving. I used this recipe with a few modifications and it turned out great!
Modifications: As a previous review said, I used 3 C. ginger ale instead of champaign. I also substituted lemons for the oranges and omitted the dried parsley. Really yummy and definitely not dry.

Wonderful recipe, and the title is true to the name!  I did brine the turkey overnight with another recipe I found (ingredients: salt, brown sugar, rosemary, thyme, garlic cloves).  I also used Chardonnay instead of champagne.  I had a 20 lb. turkey and baked it 3 hrs 30 min before removing foil and baked an additional, I'd say, 30 min.  So juicy!  You could see the juices when slicing into the breast!  Will make again!

Made this last night and my family and friends couldn’t stop raving about it.  Only change I made was to use pear cider instead of champagne.  It was perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The turkey turns out wonderfully moist with this recipe and the gravy is super tasty! I used a spicier rub on the turkey for 24 hours and then used this recipe for roasting. No champagne on hand so I used sparkling water instead.

It was juicy and good. I'm not sure if the veggies in the cavity added to the flavor, but the turkey was great.

Didn't make any changes and would make it again.  The video and recipe was easy to follow.  I had a difficult time checking the temperature so I had to check every 30 minutes after 3 hrs.  It took 4.5hours to make.  My turkey turned out great!  It was juicy and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

For all the time and money spent this had zero flavor in my 8lb turkey! 
The only positive was it was juicy but seriously it had NONE of the spices/citrus essence..... zero. So I am not sure I would do it again.

It was so good, a guy kissed me while we ate it. So yes. Highly recommended.
I made a 24 pound turkey with this recipe, and essentially doubled everything. I also rubbed butter on the inside, outside, and between the skin of the turkey. I added wedges of orange, the vegetables, peppercorns, and butter to the tray underneath (suspended in the champagne and chicken stock). It turned out fantastic!

Best turkey ever! All 21 guests raved about it. I also brined the bird for 12 hours in salt water and herbs. Very little juice for gravy though, but that’s my only complaint.

This was phenomenal!!! First thanksgiving I hosted alone & my first time cooking a bird at that! I use md bacon grease and a few other minor changes. Cooking the bird “upside down” played a key role in the juices being out of this world! I also added apples & pretty much doubled all veggies!!! Thanks so much for sharing !!

Made this without adding champagne, as I didn't have any on hand. I did not add the celery (as I highly destest it), nor the carrots. I used a Romertopf turkey roaster instead of a regular roasting pan with the aluminum foil, as per the directions. The meat fell off the bone. Tender, juicy, and flavorful, there was nothing left of a 20 pound turkey! Everyone raved about it, and this is now the go-to recipe for turkey. Hands down the best turkey I've ever made. Wonderful!!

Why are we so afraid to roast a whole turkey? Well aside from the extra effort and mess it is sometimes a gamble for a nice succulent, moist bird.  This recipe takes the fear away.   Yum, yum and everyone raved.  I may have even cooked a bit too long but you would never know it.  Only change is that I combined all the herbs with softened butter (about 1 cup) and gave the bird a good message inside and out and don't forget to get under that breast skin.  Used an inexpensive brut sparkling wine/champagne.  The gravy was the best I have ever made thanks to the champs!  May even do this off season cause the leftover meat was divine.

This is the best turkey I've ever had.  I didn't add the lemon pepper because i forgot it but it still tasted great!  I followed the directions to the "T" for my 13.5 lb turkey.  Next I'm trying it on a chicken!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving exactly as written. It was the first turkey I ever made and it came out delicious. However it could have been a little more moist, and after talking with a good chef friend he suggested definitely switching the champagne for ginger ale, as the alcohol can make it a little dry! Very easy and yummy though, thanks for the recipe :)

BEST EVER!!!  Some of my herbs were a quite a bit old but used them anyway, so with those out of date herbs and a $3.99 bottle of champagne.  OMG the flavor awesome.  Didn't make gravy but couldn't bring myself to throw away that broth.  Next day I made gumbo with the broth and another WINNER!  Best flavor ever!

I hosted Thanksgiving for the first time this year. I cooked a 24lb turkey and followed this recipe and it was a hit! I marinated it in champagne and chicken broth over night & cooked it for about 5hrs until the thickest part of the thigh was at 180 degrees F. It came out perfect! I was so nervous it wouldn’t be good. Reading the reviews on this recipe really helped! I highly recommend this recipe if you’re looking for one. My sister in law even said, “this may be the best turkey I’ve ever had!”

I usually just use butter and olive oil, salt, and pepper when making my turkey - it's always yummy, but the mix of herbs in this recipe looked interesting. Mostly I followed the recipe except for substituting sparkling cider for the champagne. The Turkey looked great and although I was afraid I may have overcooked it, it was juicy and delicious. I prepared it the night before and used another reviewer's tip to raise the turkey on slices of orange and apple. I blended the herbs with a softened stick of butter and rubbed them inside and outside of the turkey. Stuffed the turkey with chopped oranges, apples, celery, and carrots as the recipe suggested (and made a standard stuffing that I cooked in a separate dish). Instead of champagne I used about a 1/3 bottle of Martinelli's Apple-Cranberry sparkling cider, pouring it inside and over the herb-buttered turkey. When I checked my 19.5 pound turkey after about 3 hours, the herbs and butter were still clumped together (I thought the butter would have melted), so I used a paper towel to gently remove the clumps away from the breast so it would brown evenly. Also, I basted the turkey at that point and poured off some of the excess juices which I saved for gravy, and I removed the foil. I used two pop-up thermometers -- one in the thigh and one in the breast. The thigh thermometer popped up before the one in the breast did, and the turkey was really golden at that point, so I turned the temp down from 325 convection-bake to 285, and

This recipe had me pretty excited to be making the most moist turkey of my life. It slightly disappointed in that aspect, and I followed the instructions and cooking time to a T. I would have given this 3 stars, but the gravy that came from the pan drippings was out of this world & I feel the champagne and chicken broth combo had something to do with that! NOT a bad recipe at all, but next year I will probably experiment with a new one.

I did as some others & marinated the turkey overnight in the champagne/stock mixture. Then I used a turkey bag to cook it in--dumping the mixture into the bag. I also used a more basic stuffing--with the breadcrumbs etc.

It turned out perfect. So many compliments. Juicy and delicious. It was my second time ever making a turkey and so many compliments! Will def use again.

Very moist, easy to make,  and great taste. First time I have roasted a turkey  at this temp., normally I do it  275 and it take a couple more hours. Glad to see a delicious, moist bird can be completed quicker and also have  wonderful  juices to make gravy with. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this but added garlic cloves as well as onion powder and garlic powder to the dried ingredients. It took a bit longer to cook (15.7 lb turkey) but came out moist and delicious. My family was pleased. My husband usually fries the turkey and it was a nice change.

I changed it up a little. I added fresh herbs to butter and then put it under the skin and used Proseco. I did not use lemon pepper.  I didn't listen to my gut (beginner at turkeys) and didn't raise the bird out of the liquid in time so the legs were dry. How ironic that the dark meat was dry and the white meat ridiculously moist! If I had lifted the bird in the first place the entire turkey would have been ridiculous! But not to worry, there was plenty of super moist breast meat to go around.

This is definitely a repeat recipe.

Excellent turkey recipe, came out very tender and juicy! A few alterations to consider: cook until the thigh meat is 165 degrees, marinate the bird overnight in a bag with the champagne and chicken broth, and place ~4 pats of butter underneath the skin overlying the breast meat.

I used a frozen, $free.99 turkey. We didn't brine it. It was barely thawed....but this recipe SAVED the turkey. This is my second time using this recipe, and it's a winner. My only suggestion is to open up the foil for the last 20 minutes to get a nice brown, golden tone to your turkey. We've never had a moister turkey. #winner!

Yesterday I gave a try with this recipe. First of all, I have a LOT of turkey broth and I don't complain. Mine came out super juicy. I substituted champagne with sparkling apple cider and it worked. I also added dried dill weed to the herb mixture and barberries and apple to the stuffing and it came out pretty good. I also like that the stuffing is all veggies. So I'll definitely do this recipe again.

We didn't have the same experience as other reviewers. The bird was on the tender side, but certainly not falling off the bone. And it was quite flavorless. Certainly not bad, but  not one that we would repeat.

Best turkey I have ever made. Even my worst critics LOVED it. Thank-you! I will never make my turkey another way! It was moist and the gravy was delicious. I wish I made a bigger turkey, so I would have more leftovers.  I put it in the gravy overnight( one less thing to do the next day). but I stuffed it and put it in a bag  in the morning. I also put some butter with spices on the turkey as well as in it. Probably not need, could have drank that gravy. Enjoy and thanks again!

I just made this turkey yesterday for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly because, according to all the wonderful reviews, I didn't want to mess with 'perfection.' For all the flavorful ingredients: fragrant herb mixture, stuffed with celery, onions and oranges and bathed in champagne (!) one would think this turkey would be so flavorful and delicious; a real showstopper. No. It wasn't. We didn't taste anything spectacular. In fact, we didn't taste much of anything at all. I have to admit that while I can't say that it was terrible, because it wasn't, it was bland, which is almost worse. I won't roast another turkey using this recipe. What a disappointment.

I made my first Thanksgiving turkey using this recipe and it came out very good! I had to make some changes because I didn't have everything to hand (thought I had all the spices at home but I didn't, oops) but it still came out good! I used an oven bag instead of tinfoil during the cooking but I don't think it affected the final result too much. We all enjoyed the bird, at any rate!

My husband and I (both 27) and I have never made turkey before and we barely cook. This turkey came out SO juicy and perfect! Everyone loved it and there were no left overs. It was also very flavorful.   Our turkey was 12pounds and we cooked for 3 and 1/2 hours covered in foil and then 30 additional minutes.
Changes I made: 
1. We pastry brushed a half stick of butter on the outside and inside of the turkey 
2. We prepped the turkey at 4:20 am and cooked it 4:20pm so it had 12 hours of time in the fridge completely ready
3. Replaced champagne with ginger ale 
4. We added some of the spice mixture on the outside and inside

Slightly disappointed. Maybe I cooked it too long but for me it was on the drier side,  nothing to be excited about. Was my first time making turkey so I wish it had come out better.

There’s nothing extraordinary about this.  I marinated overnight and stuffed the skin.  Still rather dry and flavorless.   And we know how to cook a turkey.  Huge disappointment.

Easy! And great directions. I subbed sparkling grape juice for champagne to save on money, and it turned out great! As the other reviews have said, it was juicy and had great flavor! No complaints. My guests ate the whole thing.

If you know the basics of cooking, and can manage an oven, then this turkey recipe should be no problem. Not only is it super easy, but it is super tasty. By far the best turkey recipe I have found. The orange really gives it a unique flavor. Hands down the most juicy turkey I have ever had.

This is the best turkey recipe I have ever made.  It was simple and quick to prepare.  Turkey came out moist and delicious, breast was moist not dry.  I baked two turkeys the night before and warmed them up the next day Simply divine, I will definitely make again.

I made turkey last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas both using this recipe. Biggest mistake of my life. It was delicious, very tender and juicy. My mother-in-law asked me to pass on the recipe to her. And that started the tradition of holidays at our place instead of my mother-in-law’s place. 
I did make a few changes to the recipe. I used Welch’s white grape juice instead of champagne and a little less amount of spices than what is mentioned. Came out perfect. This is my favorite turkey recipe. Easy and fast. 3 hours and I’m done. Love it.

This was such an easy recipe to make. Make sure to watch the video for directions if it's ur first time making a turkey. I read through comments and took pointers from them. But through the video it was pretty clear. My turkey came out so juicy & delicious. Use the juices to make gravy which also came out amazing! Not sure if one champagne taste better than the next. But I used Verdi.

super jucy and very tasty. Wasn't like the typical Dry bird on Thanksgiving you've always had. I did this with bone/skin on Breast only, as my family has other meat options and mostly eat white meat. SO, we don't like throwing so much meat away. BUT, with breast only it usually is dry. Not so with this recipe. It was really really good.

This will be the second thanksgiving I've made this turkey and going on the 3rd Christmas. It is INCREDIBLE. I use the recipe to a T minus only 1 tbsp of sage cause I'm not crazy about it. So delicious, and sooooo juicy!! I am sooooooooo happy I found this recipe - it's part of our family traditions now! Thank you!!

This was delicious! There's a good chance this will be the ONLY turkey recipe I use from now on! It was juicy, perfectly seasoned, and simply delectable! My husband loved it so much, he just went on and on about how wonderful it was! I used an 11 lb. turkey.

Thank you, Kristen, for sharing your family recipe!

I was out of lemon-pepper and champagne, so I substituted black pepper in the seasonings, then stuffed lemon slices into the turkey along with the orange wedges and vegetables. For the champagne, I substituted 12 oz of white cooking wine and 12 oz of tonic water. It made lots of broth for yummy gravy!

I didn't have lemon pepper so I just threw in a lemon. We didn't have champagne either.
We It tasted good the next day. 


I didn't have a chance to eat it hot out of the oven. It was moist though when we deboned it the next day.

Super juicy and delicious turkey!!! I used an oven bag to cook the turkey and it browned the turkey perfectly and kept it nice and juicy while I focused on making other things. If you go the oven bag route I will say be careful it doesn't stick to top of skin on the turkey because it will pull it off when you take the oven bag off. I had a little bit of that happen but didn't mind. It really only changes appearance if that happens. Over all this is great and I will be making this for years to come!

You will not regret making this receipt! All of my guests raved about how moist and delicious the turkey was. I followed the recipe only substituting the champagne for ginger ale, still outstanding.

I really like this recipe. I did make some changes though. I used beer instead of champagne and I kept the lemon pepper out. Before I stuffed it with the oranges, celery, carrots, and onions, I lifted the skin from the breast and stuck some butter under the skin. Instead of covering it up with the foil, I just used the lid on my roasting pan and took the lid off when it came time to start browning the turkey.  Other than that, It is a great recipe and should be tried at least once. Once you try it, you will want to make all your turkey dinners like this and maybe even your chicken dinners too.

Turkey is not something I make often or even annually and have never found any recipe, except when putting it in the imu, that I decided worth saving until now.  I also don't normally use most of these spices so I needed to purchase them which is not cheap here so at first I hesitated but I figure with all the good reviews I really should give this one a try.  I did use butter because I just love butter and used two thirds of the champagne and drank the rest :).  When my finicky eating hubby asked how I made it and says "yes" when I asked if he would eat it again well...then that says it all.  This is a keeper to make again.

I'm from South Africa, and I tried this recipe for the Christmas Eve dinner for our whole family. I couldn't find oranges, so I replaced the orange with a couple of apricots, and I forgot to put the celery in. However, it was really good!

Two things I added to the process was to liberally brush some honey onto the bird before it went into the oven, and I sprinkled the same herbs and spices onto the outside as was used in the cavity of the bird. With about 45 minutes to go, I took the turkey out and repeated the honey and herbs on the outside.

Everybody loved the turkey!

The turkey was amazing!!  I modified the recipe a little by stuffing half-melted butter under the skin and adding some of the spice mix after pouring the champagne.  Thank you for the recipe!

Best turkey EVER - and was my first time making a turkey for Thxgiving!!  Read thru some of the tips of past attempts for suggestions.  Noted: Rub butter on outside of turkey before applying herbs (otherwise champagne will rinse off).  I used butter flavored Crisco and rubbed down inside and outside of bird; and then realized recipe only calls for herbs inside turkey.  I used turkey broth instead of chx - and poured both turkey broth and champagne inside & outside of turkey.  I prepped night before & left turkey sitting upside down in my fridge overnight, then flipped turkey upright (per recipe) for cooking.  Also cooked in a bag.  Addt'l note from past cooks: I opted for champagne over ginger ale alternative b/c I used drippings for gravy and read that the ginger ale gave gravy a sweet taste that was only preferred by few.  I really simmered and stirred gravy for a LONG time...just by accident.  Used gizzards from turkey as recommended by some "from scratch" recipe I googled on a whim.  Everyone said it was the best gravy they'd ever had!!  Final thought: Found a yummy leftover recipe on Pinterest for Thxgiving Leftover Sheppard's Pie --- YUM-MY!!!  (P.S. I think the champagne (ginger ale, if you prefer) is the trick!  My rationale is that the bubbles massage the meat.)

OMG! I have never had such a wonderful turkey before! I cooked for 20 people this year and I have a feeling I am going to be the official host from now on!
I really rubbed in the seasoning  under all of the skin and I put little pieces of butter under the skin as well. I basted offer and made sure to baste inside the cavity ... I might try next year to inject a mixture of the butter and seasoning once or twice into the thickest part of the breast.... but it was AMAZING!
Also the leftovers were sooooo flavorful and juicy they were gone in two days.
if I could give more than 5 stars I would

We used this recipe for Thanksgiving - it was PERFECT! Very flavorful and extremely moist, even the white meat! We soaked the turkey in the chicken broth with herbs for two hours then discarded the broth. We then rubbed the turkey with butter, re-applied herbs, added the onions, celery and quartered oranges in the cavity (didn't use carrots), added broth and champagne and baked in large Magnalite cast aluminum covered roaster. Thanks so much for sharing your family's delicious recipe!!!

Wow. I have only made Thanksgiving dinner one other time. And it turned out pretty good. But, this recipe made me look like a culinary master. I made no changes to this one and it came out perfect. The meat was moist and flavorful. My wife loved it so much that I will, most likely, be assigned the responsibility every year. And maybe it's the tryptophan-induced coma setting in, but I don't think I mind having that burden. It was just that good. One thing to note, I used a 12 lb turkey instead of 15. So, the cavity was smaller and I couldn't fit all of the ingredients into it. Next time, I will only cut up about half of what the recipe calls for as far as the onion, carrot and celery. Make sure you get all of that orange in there, though.

I used this recipe on a 22 lb turkey. Because the cooking time was so long with such a large bird, I cooked it with the breast side down (in the liquids) so it wouldn't dry out. I turned it when it was time to take the foil off  to brown it. The meat was very moist and flavorful.

I mixed this with another recipe where I added all the spices in with about  a stick of softened butter and rubbed underneath the skin, inside the cavity, and then on top of the bird too. My aunt said "this is the best turkey I've ever had" - and it was my first time ever roasting one in my life! I will definitely make this my tradition from now on!

Absolutely the BEST turkey I have ever made and quite possibly the best turkey I have ever tasted! Just a few tweeks- used ginger ale instead of champagne as someone else had mentioned and we could honestly poke a piece of meat after it had been sliced and could watch juice run out of it...Also, wasn't able to keep the foil from touching the turkey(but after the first hour, we basted it every 30-45 mins) and there was no sticking of the skin to the foil and it turned out perfectly. My fiance and I have 5 children so pleasing all of them and ourselves is hit and miss, but this recipe has been printed out and filed away in Nana's recipe box. This is a MUST try recipe!

Marinated in champagne and turkey broth over night. Combine the dried herbs and 3 sticks of melted butter. Inject the butter mixture under the skin. 15 lbs turkey cook On 350 for about 2 1/2 hrs in a roasting pan. Check temp. Falls off the bone!

I made this Turkey for a Thanksgiving meal in Madrid, Spain today, and it was an INCREDIBLE turnout! Everyone loved it, the juices were incredible, and the seasoning/rub perfect.

I made my first Thanksgiving turkey this year, using this recipe. I used a brined, 18 lb turkey from Trader Joe's, and followed the recipe to a T. It was flawless. Absolutely delicious. Meat was juicy and succulent. I don't know if it would be as good with a turkey that wasn't brined (that's all they had at Trader Joe's), but I'll definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

I give this recipe 5 stars because my bird came out perfectly. My mom even said it was as good as anything she's ever gotten at a restaurant. That having been said, I applied a dry brine (Williams Sonoma brand) about 48 hours before preparing and cooking this bird as instructed in the recipe. I had no need for the spices listed because of the brine. I stuffed it with the veggies and oranges, poured the champagne over top and cooked it exactly as directed. My 16 lb bird was cooked to perfection in 4 hours, 3 tented and one open. The skin was nice and crisp while the meat was tender and juicy.

This is the best I have ever had! I made this 3 times already! The first two times we used dry champagne and fresh herbs inside and the dry herbs on the outside and did a olive oil rub. This time we only had dry herbs and did the olive oil rub with EXTRA dry champagne. I believe that it made the turkey even more juicy. Everyone LOVED the turkey!! We covered it for the 2hr 10 and Uncovered it for the last 50 min and it was perfectly browned....I just wish I would have taken a picture!!

I LOVEDDDD this recipe!! I did by mistake put under the skin small pieces of  1/2 stick of unsalted butter . After 2 1/2 hours at 350 I increased the temperature to 385 F,  injected 2 syringes of MOJO into the breast and thighs and cooked uncovered for more 30 minutes.  ( sorry for the messy  but after searching for many recipes and got confused and add the butter and Mojo from other site. My mistake) . 
But it came out DELICIOUS and juicy !! My "pick" husband said was the best ever turkey he had!!
Thanks for sharing the recipe !!
P.S. Who is searching for a great recipe this is THE ONE!!;-)

This was my first time ever roasting a turkey. Talk about nerve racking! My family isn't crazy about turkey, and that's why we usually have ham on thanksgiving, but wow, this turkey was seriously good. It was juicy, flavorful, and tender. The gravy alone was absolutely amazing! I didn't have to add a thing to it aside from a thickening agent. I will be making this every year from now on. I may even use this recipe for a roasted chicken one night. I'll still buy the 750 ml champagne bottle. What we don't use for the chicken we can drink!

We did all the prep for this bird and let it sit in the poultry cooking bag overnight.   It was the most tender and delicious turkey we've all had!

The most AMAZING turkey.  I am not kidding, I will make this every year!  The only thing different I did was add some butter to the cavity and the out side and slightly, I mean slightly sprinkle some of the seasoning for the cavity on the outside of the bird as well.

Made this today for thanksgiving. I had a 24-pound turkey so I did 1.5 times this recipe. I also took a half a cup of butter and mixed it with 1/3 the dry rub and then massaged it under the skin. 

I bought gravy fearing that all the liquid would not be good for making gravy, but my brother in law insisted on trying. It came out amazing!!!!! 

Lastly, the turkey took an hour longer than expected. I thought it would cook as quickly as an unstuffed bird. Instead it took as long as a stuffed one even though I didn't consider it fully stuffed. Heads up!!

I followed this recipe today to help prepare my first ever Thanksgiving Day meal. I followed the recipe to the letter, and I was not disappointed! By far, the juiciest, tenderest turkey I've ever had in my life - and not hard to prepare at all. I will be making this every year for sure!

I used this recipe to make my first turkey and am a novice cook. The turkey came out great and the instructions easy to follow. I made some changes, I used a Reynolds oven bag instead of the foil. Also using the bag allows the skin to cook with the bird. 2 and 1/2 hours and an another 30 minutes to make sure the turkey is done. Awesome recipe and the meat is juicy, flavorful, and perfect color. I will add potatoes, and more celery next time to create more sides for the turkey. Awesome recipe especially since this is my first time cooking a turkey.  THANK YOU!!

I've been using this recipe for thanksgiving dinner for the past 5 years. Every year I get blown away by how delicious it is. Even family members who are not crazy about turkey always comment on how amazing this one is and gobble it up!  LOL. Will continue to use this for decades to come!  Thank you for sharing Kristen!

This is the turkey that my family wants every year. After filling the cavity I truss the turkey and place it upside down in a baking bag, I add the bubbly and broth then I leave it in the fridge for 1-2 nights ahead of time with the breasts at the bottom so they soak up all that wonderful flavor. The day of I bring it out in the morning so it has a chance to get to room temp and before cooking I flip it back up, I place it in a roaster on the counter. I had wonderful results. Leftovers go fast and pair very well in a variety of casseroles.  Thank you for this recipe!

I used a litre of chicken broth and never lined the  roaster or covered with foil.  I used fresh sage, rosemary, thyme and parsley. Cooked the 18 lb turkey on the Gas BBQ.
It was a Hugh hit.

I made this as directed except I didn't have champagne and tried the other suggestions of Ginger-Ale.  This Turkey was very moist and turned out perfect.  No complaints from anyone.  Used the left overs to  make a great soup.

The seasoning was perfect! This is my go to recipe.  My brother commented on the taste at first bite. I am used to smothering the turkey in gravy, however, the seasoning allowed for the bird to shine all on its own!

Having never made a turkey before I searched for an easy recipe that had good reviews and this is the one I decided to try and boy did it deliver. The turkey was juicy, flavorful and was super easy to make. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

I made this just a few months ago for Friends Giving and it was amazing!! Everyone was blown away and said they have never had such a juicy turkey! Only thing that I did differently was I only uncovered it for the last 30 minutes. My husband was freaked out because it was more white and not so crispy and dark but you as long as its not pink and cooked your fine! I also found a brine that matched this recipe and I let it sit in the fridge for three days! I will never use a different recipe.

I brined the turkey in just a salt water solution overnight before starting the recipe. The champagne and chicken broth really made the turkey turn out deliciously moist. It had such a good flavor with the great combo of herbs too. I definitely recommend this recipe and would make it again.

I was really nervous I would mess this up. Followed the directions to the letter with small changes to the rub. This has to be the juiciest turkey I've ever made. Big thumbs up from my Christmas dinner guests.

I did everything the recipe said, but i made sure I poured champagne (thats slightly citrusy) directly in the cavity and over the bird, same with the broth. I did not open it up to marinate it.. I don't think it's needed. Everything turned out amazing. Everything was juicy, including the white meat. I normally hate turkey.. LOVE this one.

Pairs well with home made italian stuffing (baked seperately).

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/180977/southern-italian-thanksgiving-stuffing/

That stuffing recipe. I changed some of the spices turkey flavoured - i did oregano & basil, instead of rosemary and poultry seasoning. Use at least 1 less cup of chicken broth..So it isn't sopping wet/soggy. 

It pairs AMAZING with this turkey.

I did not deviate from the recipe at all. It took 1.5 hours longer to cook than the recipe said. But, it was worth the wait. My whole family kept talking about how this was the juiciest turkey they had ever had. I did make some slits in the skin and add the seasonings so the champagne would not make them run off the turkey. I will definitely use this recipe next year.

This recipe makes a really juicy turkey! I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time for tips on using the butter to cause the herbs to stick to the bird when you pour the broth mixture over the turkey, but we just stuck to pouring the mixture inside and along the bottom of the turkey.

But, I browned the skin first at 425 for 1 hr ( 24.5 lb turkey) and then it cooked until internal temp reached 160 degrees. Then rested for a

This was the first turkey I made, and it was great.  It did not have the gamey taste and was juicy.  I brined the turkey overnight in the same spices with a whole lemon, cinnamon stick, bay leaves and peppercorns with half cup of sea salt and 1L of ginger ale and the rest was broth. I made this using ginger ale instead of champagne.  I added garlic, onion, black pepper, ginger and paprika to the spice mix and rubbed it all over the turkey, placed pats of butter under the skin all over and poured ginger ale into the cavity and all over the bird.  I followed the rest of the steps as directed.  My turkey took 6 hours to cook, and everyone was happy and they are normally do not like turkey.  Thanks!

My 16 yr old found this recipe and used it for her first attempt at a Thanksgiving  turkey, last year.  What a hit! Followed every step and it was the juiciest, best tasting turkey ever. She is now the designated turkey cooker and used it again this year. We looked forward to it for a whole year and it was worth the wait!! Try it!!!

As a vegetarian, I wanted to make a turkey that would WOW my family.  This turkey was hands-down the "Best" turkey that they have ever tasted.  I followed every step in the recipe and everyone was impressed (I increased baking time to almost 6 hours for a 14lb turkey).  Even I, as a non-meat eater for almost two years, was tempted to take a bite!!  It looked so Delicious, Golden Brown, and Juicy!  I made for this turkey for 10+ family members and it really gave me a sense of pride to see the satisfaction on their faces!!!

FYI... I used an $8 bottle of California brand champagne.

Thanks for sharing!

I have been making Thanksgiving dinners for more years than I'd like to admit, and this recipe won raves from my husband, a certified turkey lover.  Moist & juicy, it was our best turkey ever!  Thank you, Kristen, for sharing your grandmother and mother's recipe!  FYI, I also made Chef John's Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy & recommend it highly.

Turkey turned out delicious. It's very juicy and tasty. I read a recommendation to marinate turkey overnight (12hours) in the broth & champagne which I did. Other than that I followed recipe. Can't wait to make it again.

Best turkey I have ever made... Very moist, with EXCELLENT flavor!  The meat literally fell off the bone.  I cooked it for 3 hours, then 1 hour at 200 just to keep it warm while I was finishing up the rest of the thanksgiving meal.

It was the most delicious turkey ever! I kept pouring the broth over the turkey every 30 mins or hour and it was so perfect. The turkey was very juicy and it had so much flavor.

This was as good as any turkey I have ever eaten.  So moist and had a good flavor.  Made as directed, but left out the carrot.  Got done quicker than expected.   Next year may do the same thing and try it in an oven bag.

Excellent turkey and everyone loved it. I used the ginger ale method that someone suggested. Didn't have an orange so I added a splash of orange juice to the cavity. The turkey was a beautiful roasted brown on the outside and the meat was incredibly moist. I had to drape some foil over the breast after it cooked in the last hour as it was starting to get too dark for the amount of time left. Perfection!

I have only made a few turkeys in my life so far, and this was the best I have made.  I made one slight change and it was to let the turkey rest 6 hours (before cooking) in a bag with the champagne,  stock, one orange cut up, and the herbs rubbed on.  (I did melt 4 tablespoons of butter, let it cool and mixed it with the herbs so it was an easier paste to rub on.)  I think our oven is starting to get old as it was hard to maintain the same temp throughout the turkey, so that was a little tricky as it ended up having to cook and extra hour.  We were concerned the turkey would be dry in result, but to our suprise it was juicy and wonderful :-)  
In short, this will be my go-to from now on.  Loved it.

Note: just used Korbel champagne this year because we are on a budget...was still great.  I also added another chopped up orange with the celery and carrots before I stuck her in the oven.

I made my first turkey using this recipe and it was amazing!! Everyone loved it so much they want turkey instead of ham for Christmas. I didn't know what champagne to get so I asked the person at the liquor store which was the best to use and he said the extra dry. I still can't believe how awesome it was and how easy!!

This was the most amazing Turkey! It was so juicy and delicious!! The gravy I made from the pan drippings from this turkey was the most delicious gravy I have ever had! I had 20 guests, a 25lb turkey, and everyone absolutely loved this turkey and gravy!

Super juicy, moist, great flavor. Kept everything the same only dry brine before, then cut back on salt for rub. Best turkey dinner ever! I use a fresh turkey, not frozen, which I think helps make this a success

I made this turkey last year for Thanksgiving and it was Bangin!  I marinated the turkey all night in the champagne and broth after I  rubbed it inside and out with the spices. We even loved the vegetables and orange in the cavity. The flavor was great and it was the juiciest turkey I have had. I am using this recipe again this year. That was the first turkey I ever made and now I am the official turkey maker!

Very good recipe. I make a similar one but I use a bottle of bear. It does not affect the taste of the gravy. My recipe was given to me from Aunt many many years ago.

Awesome recipe! Thank you so much for sharing. I did change it up just a bit, I used melted butter to add to the dry rub. I also brined it for 48hrs before the butter rub and baking it!

I must say... For being a hard food critic this recipe was great! I used half bottle of cider and half bottle of white wine, plus I let the turkey marinate with the rub and liquids for a day. The turkey came out very flavorful and moist. Oh, I also added extra orange wedges and added orange zest underneath the turkey skin for extra zesty flavor! All-in-all, great flavorful turkey! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was my first time making Thanksgiving dinner...I was so nervous! Found this recipe and decided to try it. The only thing I did differently was marinate the turkey overnight with the chicken broth and champagne. It was delicious and juicy! Everyone loved it and now want me to make it for Xmas! :)

Giving this 5 stars even though mine came out a bit dry. This was do to my own mistake. I roasted in my Nesco roaster vs tenting and roasting in oven. The turkey tested done over 1 1/2 hours sooner then what roaster directions stated, and I was a bit worried my meat themometer was not reading correct temp of meat. So I decided to cook it an additional hour. Should not have done that. The tase was great, through! Made wonderful gravy from drippings. Will definitely make this again and not cook as long.

The reviews don't lie! This was my first turkey and I pretty much did as directed. Marinaded in broth overnight, threw the rub on in the cavity and under the skin the morning of and cooked. It was perfect and got comments like "best turkey I've ever had". Thanks!

I found this recipe last year and thought I'd give it a go, although I'd never heard of using champagne in cooking a turkey.  It came out absolutely delicious, and I've since used it three more times because it was so popular with my family.  The only change I make is to use half the bottle of champagne because between that and the chicken broth, there's a TON of juice in the bottom of the pan.  Since I make turkey for Christmas, too, I just use half of the bottle for Turkey Day and the other half a month later for Christmas.  Works out perfectly!

I used this a guide to make my little 8 lb. stuffed bird, it was divine!! I brined the turkey overnight in salt water. The veggies I put under the turkey instead of in the cavity and my spices I rubbed all over the turkey and under the skin. I rubbed butter all over including under the skin as well. I had no champagne, just used chicken broth. I will use this recipe whenever I make turkey!!!! The mix of spices was perfect and the turkey was amazing!!! :):)

It was my first time making a turkey ever and it turned out as a success! Since it was a last minute preparation, I couldn't get any rubbed dried sage from any store. I used fresh sage (chopped about 1/3 cup). My turkey was only 11 pounds so it took me a little less than 3 hours. I bought an unfrozen turkey that was processed on the same day I bought it, which might have been part of reason why the turkey tasted so good! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

20 years of Thanksgiving cooking.....this has been the BEST yet, and will be for the next 20!  I use a 25 lb bird since I want all the leftovers I can invent. And just as the recipe asks, all the spices on the inside walls of the turkey and veggies and oranges stuffed inside.  I use an oven bag so I omitted the broth and champagne.  The oven bag captured 3-4 cups of liquid as it was! Rubbed the bird with vegetable oil before securing the bag then cooking @ 350* for 3:45 - 4 hrs.  Golden brown, juicy, flavorful.  Delicious!  Then with all the spices, veggies and oranges still inside, the carcass went into the stock pot and simmered for my best ever turkey soup! 5 plus!

This is the best recipe I've found to date. Thank you! This will become a staple recipe for all thanksgiving turkeys to follow. No one could believe how tender and juicy the bird was throughout. Unbelievable! A definite must try. The only thing I did that wasn't shown. I sliced oranges as well and used toothpicks to the place them on the skin of the bird. This not only helps keep the foil off the bird but made the skin taste phenomenal. Remove them when you open the foil to finish cooking for the last hour to an hour and a half.

I have hosted 30 Thanksgiving meals, and this is by far the best recipe for moist, juicy, flavorful, fall-off-the bone turkey.  The gravy is AMAZING.  I didn't want to send leftovers home with guests!  Like other reviewers, I  mixed the herbs with 1/2 cups butter so the herbs would stick to the skin and I also lifted the skin and rubbed the herb directly on the meat.  This recipe is now my standard.  Will never go back to other roasting techniques.  And the mimosas at 6 am were delicious, too!

I thought it was moist but not flavorful at all. Again, could be that I'm just not used to these spices, but my honest opinion it's that it was very bland.

Made this today for the first time.  It was by far the juiciest turkey I have ever made.  I didn't use all the spices as I am not a fan of rosemary, so not all that flavorful.  I will experiment some more on that.  My turkey was almost 23 pounds.  I cooked under the foil until it was an hour of being done.  (used the rule of thumb 15 minutes per pound).  I finished the last 30-45 minutes with the foil open.  EXCELLENT!

This was delicious super duper moist i loved it to death! I would give it 5 stars but i only give it four because i feel like maybe the recipe should have included cutting off the fat i would do this is feature otherwise so so so so yummy what we did was that we went ahead and used half of the dry seasoning on the inside then smothered the turkey in butter and rubbed the other half on the skin for flavored skin super yummy we will do this again and again

With this recipe I made my very first turkey! I did not have dried parsley and sage, but I substituted with fresh parsley and oregano. I was afraid it would not have any flavor and just very cautious about cooking the turkey in general. I am having a friend's giving and I'm not sure if they're going to like it, but my bf and I really love it! It's so moist and the flavor is so refreshing! Thank you for this recipe. I am definitely going to make this again next year, but this time for my gigantic family!

This was the best turkey I've ever made. My husband and kids even ate it, and they don't like turkey. They even suggested that I make pot pie from the leftovers!!! Definately doing it again. May try same ingredients on a roast chicken.

OMG, I made this with a 4 lb. chicken on Monday and it was THE BEST chicken I have ever made.  I DO NOT eat white meat, I think it's too dry and I just don't like it.  I tried it on this chicken, and I ate the white meat first!!!!!!!!!!  It was so moist and tender, I just couldn't believe it.  I have a 9 lb. turkey in the freezer that I'm going to make over the Christmas/New Years holiday and you can BET I'll be making it like this.  The only thing I did different was I used White Zin (because that's what I had) and I didn't use Tyme, because I don't like it, so I substituted poultry seasoning and sage.  I also didn't add anything in the cavity mainly because I forgot!!!!  Again, OMG was it good!!!!!!!!!

Perfect turkey, every single time.  It is so moist and delicious.  The juices make the BEST gravy.  I am the only one allowed to cook the turkey for holidays now. The only thing extra I do is brine the turkey a day before and adjust cooking times depending on the bird's weight.  I am so grateful for this recipe.  It's the one I used for my first Thanksgiving I cooked and will use it until my last.

I have to agree with everybody else, this is the best turkey I've ever made. I marinated the turkey the night before and stuffed it before cooking. Everybody loved it. My sister came back  on Friday for the left overs. I even posted it in my fb..that's how proud I was about it...Thank you for sharing this recipe..

First timer, yet best turkey I ever tasted, most moist, and so tender I carved half with just my bare hands.

No champagne, used red wine.
Added 1 quart of drippings, shredded meat, juices, and skin from a pork roast a few days earlier.
Skipped the skin crisping stage and kept it in the foil.
Substituted salt with seasoning salt.

This was the first turkey I've ever made.  I was terrified by all the nay-sayers out there saying that turkey was so difficult to get right and that even a perfectly made turkey was not moist or flavorful.  Not being a terribly seasoned chef, I followed the recipe to the letter, and let me tell you...  This recipe proves them all wrong!!!  My husband even begrudgingly said that it was better than his father's!  He thought something was wrong because he'd never seen so much juice when he cut into it.  I believe it was as close to perfect as a turkey can get!  Thank you so much for this gift!

Didn't add chicken broth; 15 lb turkey cooked almost 5 hours. Broth was great for noodles and gravy.

I've NEVER tasted white meat so juicy and flavorful before!! I love cranberry sauce and/or gravy, but neither were needed with this bird! BEST TURKEY EVER. We will be using this recipe every year now.

Very juicy and tasty. Everyone commented on how moist the white meat was. I cooked it at 325 degrees because I was scared it would dry out at the higher temp, but I think it would have been fine. I mixed the herbs in butter and rubbed it into the cavity and rubbed some butter under the skin. Only bad thing was how little is left over because people couldn't get enough of it. :)

There is not enough stars to rate this recipe!!!! I searched for years for that ultimate moist and juicy turkey and here it is!!!! This recipe is out if this world!!! Thank you for sharing. I used a brine mixture containing most of the herbs listed above along with salt garlic pepper corns and brown sugar and left the turkey soak over night.

I made this and it was so juicy and flavorful.  I used a cooking bag instead of the foil.  The drippings made great gravy.  Very easy to make.  Thank you for the great recipe.

It was my first time making a turkey last night as an early thanksgiving just for DH and myself, and the turkey came out so moist - we loved the recipe and will use it again! However the only issue was that our 15lb Turkey was not ready at the recipes' estimated 3 hr at 350 degrees. In fact it took  8hr total for it to reach 175 degrees and for the juices to run clear. What did I do wrong? I put it near the bottom rack of our oven (did that effect it?). Any input would help.

Made this turkey EXACTLY per the recipe (except had to increase the covered cooking time but did the uncovered per directions). My guests couldn't stop raving about the amazing turkey and gravy! It was so juicy, not dried out at all. They said they never had such moist turkey before. It was the first turkey I ever made!

This was very good - everyone loved it.  I thought the gravy was a little too tangy, so I added Club House turkey gravy mix - it was wonderful.

This is a really good recipe.  Juicy and moist!  I used wine instead of champagne cause it is what I had on hand.  Next time I will use champagne to see if it makes a difference.  Great recipe!!!

I have tried it...although without the champagne and it was TRULY delicious and indeed very juicy. I imagine that the champagne will make the bird extra juicy. I will redo it for the New Year's Eve table.

I made this turkey for Christmas and it was lovely!  We don't like stuffing, so I did not mind that this did not have the normal stuffing.  What was wonderful also, is that we ended up having an excellent gravy - not necessary to add anything!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

This was an awesome recipe!  I would not change a thing.  Not only was the turkey moist and flavorful, but the drippings made a wonderful base for the gravy.  I never would have thought to use champagne and I'm really glad I came upon this recipe.  Oh, and it was so easy!  Thank You.

I cooked a 20 # bird and the legs were falling off in 4 hours, but the breast was still moist.  I didn't do the whole line the pan with foil and wrap it up around, I simply covered the pan tightly with foil.  It would probably work with one of the old fashioned granite roasters too!  Will definitely be cooking all my turkeys this way now!

I tried this as my very first turkey and it came out great! It was juicy and tender.  I received lots of compliments.  I did change it alittle. I used all fresh seasonings and added ginger ale instead of champagne.  Was a great turkey receipt!

I have cooked the thanksgiving meal for a huge family for years and this year I tried this recipe. Everyone said it was the moistest and most delicious turkey I have ever cooked. Thank you so much for the recipe. This will be the way I cook turkey from now on!
One suggestion for serving - if you take the cooked mixture that was in the bird and sprinkle it on top of a slice of turkey, it is even more amazing.

Great turkey!  I screwed up and depended on the pop-up timer which didn't work.  The turkey ended up staying the oven almost an hour longer than it should have and the bird was still moist and juicy.  The herbs were perfect. I think I found my favorite turkey recipe!

This really is the most delicious and super moist turkey recipe. The only things I did differently were to purchase a brined turkey and cover the bird in bacon slices - for the entire cooking time. The juices made the most delicious gravy. This was my first time roasting a turkey and it was such a success thanks to this recipe.

DELICIOUS! It was a huge hit! This was the first time I cooked almost everything and had Thanksgiving dinner at my house so my whole family was surprised, including my grandmother who is the "head chef" in the family! Will definitely use this again!
