OMG! This was awsome! I hate coffee, but give it to me cold or in a cocktail and I just LOVE it! I used cold coffee vs. espresso and line the chilled martini glass with some chocolate syrup to make it a little fancier.

Tasty.  Made with strong, brewed coffee that had been chilled instead of espresso.  Even my non-coffe-drinking husband likes it.

I don't really care for "real" coffee.  I'll drink the Starbuck steamers- mostly mike and vanilla flavor is all I really want- freeze it and add whip cream and I"m in heaven.  THIS HOWEVER, was GREAT!  Hit the spot and I'm tempted to play with it and dress it up.  Thanks for sharing.
