This really is delicious and it tastes just like a caramel apple!  I used Granny Smith apples and the peel gave the salad some color.  I think next time I will use a combination of Granny Smith and Gala to get more color.  There definitely will be a next time.  This got rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This salad was pretty good.  I used walnuts instead of peanuts and next time I won't add the egg yolk.

This is a delicious, light salad that can be served with the meal or as a dessert. Every time I make it I get lots of compliments! Some compare it to a Waldorf salad.

I took this to a lamaze class reunion . . it was
very good.  It tastes a lot like a carmel apple.
The nuts really make a nice addition.

We all enjoyed this salad!  You can also have it as a desert.  It was perfect for our 4th of July BBQ.  I used three kinds of apples, granny smith, fuji & red delicious.  I also used lite cool whip and it was absolutely delicious!  But be sure to make this only a few hours ahead because it does get a bit watery.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks Julie!

Although this salad tasted pretty good hardly anyone at it at the party.  The presentation isn't really good so not many wanted to try it.  I wouldn't make it again.  Maybe for a smaller group at home.

My recipe that I have used for years is a little different, but just the same this is great for a party. For presentation sometimes I drizzle melted caramel over the too with nuts on top.

I followed exactly as written using fat-free cool whip and it was EXCELLENT.  I had absolutely no problem with any separation or it being runny.  It retained it's creamy sauce quite well and it tasted just as yummy when I ate leftovers the next day.  This tastes JUST like a caramel apple - I love it!!

I've made this salad several times already and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  The only thing I changed was using half of the amount of peanuts.

This was yummy!  I added a 20 ounce can of pineapple instead of 8 because I didn't want the leftovers in the fridge.  This was the best apple salad I have had.  The only bad thing I can say is the sauce is not that creamy-it kind of separates, which doesn't make the prettiest salad-but I don't care--it tastes like a carmel apple!

This was good, and it really did taste like a caramel apple. I think it would be better to use in the fall rather than as a summer salad. Worth a try.

Was apprehensive to use vinegar in this recipe, but somehow it worked. Put a dash of cinnamon and salt in the sauce, which made it better in my opinion. Only used about 4 oz of whipped topping. This was a fun recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  I used Gala apples - they’re my favorite for flavor, but don’t have the color that’s needed for this dish.  I used quartered Maraschino cherries for color, just a half cup or so.  It gave the salad a slightly pink hue and added a little flavor twist.  To solve the “separation” issue that others mentioned, I made the sauce and refrigerated it.  Then I combined the fruits in a large zipper bag, taking care to force out as much air as possible and refrigerated it separately.  Just before serving, I folded in the chilled whipped topping.  It got rave reviews.

I love this Taffy Apple salad.  I substituted corn starch for the flour to make it gluten-free, and it worked perfectly.  I also used two red delicious apples and two granny smith apples for a little extra color.

This recipe was awesome!  However I found I didn't have crushed pineapple so I just used the juice of can of pineapple chuck and omitted the pineapple.  I also noticed too late the sauce was suppose to be done the night before -so I made it and popped in the freezer for about 30-45 min to cool it down.  I turned out great using only the pineapple juice off 20oz can and freezing the sauce and serving the same day after mixing it up (no separation of the sauce either)

I am not a big fan of taffy apple salad, but my mom is and asked me to print out a recipe for it. It same out really well and i didnt have any problems with seperating. I would also consider straining the egg and pineapple mixture after chilling it overnight and before adding it to the fruit and nut mixture. We normally add marshmallow and i didnt realize this recipe didnt include those until after i started. I just ended up folding them in after the cool whip. Overall, I would make this again.

I make a similar recipe. I use chunk pineapples. I think crushed would make for a weird texture. I also use spanish peanuts. And always use red delicious apples. Have made it with other apples and always go back to red delicious. It is supper yummy this way! Give it a shot!!

LOVE this recipe. Though I substitute the peanuts for chopped pecans and I am considering adding mini marshmallows the next time I make it! Hmmm... Either way good stuff!

Taste just like what you get a your local deli counter.  My son would have ate the entire bowl tonight if I let him.  This is a definite keeper for a twist for a salad with some BBQ's.

I have made this salad MANY times for picnics and summer meals over the past 4 years.  EVERYONE always raves and wants the recipe.  I usually do not mix it all up until shortly before serving and have never had problems with separation.  THANK YOU for such a family and friend favorite!

This was just what I was looking for. My aunt makes a similar salad without the nuts and adds bananas, marshmallows and whipping cream instead of cool whip. I wanted a lower fat version, and used fat free cool whip. The nuts made a great addition. I went ahead and added marshmallows and bananas at the end. Will make agian!!! I loved it!!

This was wonderful, co-workers loved it.  After reading the reviews I tried to make it look a little more appealing by coring an extra apple, I used red, just for the color and cutting it into wedges drizzled them with a little lemon juice so they wouldn't turn brown and made a flower like design on top starting in the middle of the salad.  I also bought a small can of cored whole pineapple, you get about four to a can and cut them in half and sprialed them around the rim of the bowl as an extra garnishment. It did make it look prettier but once they started eating it they could have cared less.  Thanks for a great post.

I love this salad!  As prior reviewers have pointed out; it doesn't lend to the best presentation, but it sure does taste great.  It doesn't hold well as leftovers, either, so plan to make and eat on the same day.

I do not particularly care for apple salad.  I prefer my apples sliced thin with a glob (and I mean a GLOB) of caramel dip on them.  That fact aside, I decided to fix this for a family reunion and it was delicious.  I used red delicious, because I doubled the recipe and they were on sale.  I could see using both a sweet and tart apple for different flavor.  I'm also not sure what the tapioca does for the recipe, as what I used didn't soften in the recipe.  I may leave it out next time.  I also used dry roasted peanuts and think I will use regular salted next time.  Otherwise, it was a light summer dish, transported well, and was a huge hit!

A few things to note. Like others here, I also used a 20oz can of the pineapple. Be aware when purchasing your canned crushed pineapple that some come in heavy syrup and some come in pineapple juice. I used pineapple juice. I also used two Honeycrisp apples and two Granny Smith. In the future, I'd use three Granny Smiths as their tartness complements the sweeter ingredients, and use one red skinned FIRM apple to help with color presentation. As for peanuts, I used salted spanish peanuts and only about 1 cup. (I think the papery red skins helped with the color presentation that others have reported). As a last presentation related idea. I spread the completed salad in a large flat serving dish (mine was square but I think a 9x13 would work). I had only incorporated half of the cool whip in with the salad and spread the remainder of the cool whip over the top. I then pulsed about  1/4 cup of the peanuts in a blender and spread that over the top along with a drizzle of caramel sauce used for ice cream topping. Looked great! And the caramel and nuts tells people what they can expect from the flavor of the salad. UPDATE: The next day, there was quite a bit of liquid at the bottom of the dish. This may be the separation that people are referring to. Doesn't affect the taste at all but I think if you are making this to bring somewhere the trick is assembling it and letting it chill for just the hour or so like the recipe dictates. Don't try and make it too far ahead of time.

Absolutely perfect just as it is! I used granny smith apples and lightly salted peanuts and the kids ate it all up as soon as it was chilled! I decided to try this recipe because our local grocery store sells this for over $5 a pound and I'm so glad I did! Not only is it much cheaper, it also tastes a lot better and fresher! Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's definitely a keeper! ;)

I made this according to directions.  It doesn't have a ton of flavor, so I can see why people are adding snickers which would have made it great.  But considering this 'salad' already has such little nutritional value, I didn't want to make it worse with candy.    

I made the salad as the instructions stated and found it to be little too runny to serve to a group.   So I added half a packet of sugar free vanilla pudding, which seems to really thicken it up.   The one exception was that I used salted peanuts, which I think was a good call. 

Overall, this is a very fine salad.  Without the snickers I don't think it is blowing anyone away.  But I do think it would get happily eaten at a party.

I've made this for years, but I never use the egg yolk and very little pineapple. It is always a big hit and adding snickers makes it even better! Yumm yumm!

A really great apple salad!!  I liked this twist on the old Cool Whip version. The cooked "pudding" really made the difference: a not-too-sweet richness that plays nicely off the crisp apples and salty peanuts, yummmmm!!

I made this on the spur of the moment. Defrosted Cool Whip by microwaving 45 seconds at 50%, stir, repeat until completely thawed -- usually after 2-3 cycles.Cooled the pineapple juice mixture in an ice bath while I chopped the apples. Tasted good right away, but tastes great if you have an hour or even overnight to let the flavors mix.

This is simple to put together. I made it as instructed. I think it is awfully sweet. Next time I make this I will use half the sugar.  I just think it's a little too sweet. It's a nice addition to a buffet, especially when you are short on time.

I made this for a desert for a bridesmaid luncheon. I was very well pleased! And yes it taste like a caramel apple. I will make it again. I might crush my peanuts up the next time.

I consider myself a pretty good cook and baker. All I could taste was the cider vinegar. I will never use this recipe again.

I was not too impressed with this and neither were my guests. The flavor was good, but the presentation was just wasn't. I made it the same day like others suggested, but it was still watery after sitting out for an hour or so. There was too much whipped topping and you couldn't even tell what was in it. Plus, people were turned off by the peanuts. I won't be making this again.

Good recipe.  I made this for a bonfire we had and everybody loved it.  I did use 20oz of pineapple like the other post--I didn't want left over pineapple in the fridge.  I also added chopped up snicker bars, because that is what my mom always does--only this was better (but we won't tell her that)
