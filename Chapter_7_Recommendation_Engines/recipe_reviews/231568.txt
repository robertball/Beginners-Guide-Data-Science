These are excellent!  I halved the recipe.  I only had ground Oregano so I only used about a teaspoon, maybe a tad more, but a whole tablespoon would have been way too much...otherwise I made it exactly as written. Oh, except my local Kroger didn't have Cremini mushrooms so I just used extra buttons. The flavor is very good, both my husband and I couldn't believe there was no meat.  Next time I will make a full batch and freeze them for lunches.  This recipe is a keeper!  Oh, beware, these were a tad too spicy for my husband, so if you have a wimpy palette go easy on the crushed red pepper (half it, don't omit it)...and use fresh basil, it really makes the flavors pop.

i made a few changes to the recipe,i didnt use any mushrooms(they aren't really my thing) and instead i used grape tomatoes and sundried tomatoes with parmesan and mozarella cheese on top,put it in my toaster oven for about 2 minutes until the cheese was melted and took it back out,topped it with spinach,colby jack cheese,cheddar cheese and more parmesan and mozarella and put a few more tomatoes and about 5 black olives on top and it was delicious!I haad it with chips and salsa and the whole meal by itself had 27 grams of protien,and i know it is hard to get protien with a vegetarian diet!

This is a good base vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe, where you can add or remove whatever suites you. I used brown rice and quartered the recipe since there are two of us. To speed up baking time I boil my peppers before stuffing them. Because they were already cooked, rather than a soup base in the tray I surrounded the peppers with the extra stuffing. Great Flavours, love the balsamic flavour in the mushrooms and kudos for not being afraid of garlic. We love garlic!

My family enjoyed this recipe and that includes my husband who is a big meat eater!  I did use orange peppers as they were cheaper and I used white rice vs orzo because I had it on hand.

Very good, even my picky 5 year old ate them up.
Will be making them again, but may add a little bit more spice, I had left out the crushed peppers the first time.
This one would be good for a crowd because you can make large batches.

Took more than twice as long than the recipe stated so kids ended up eating subway.  Results were just okay and for as long as it took to make them it simply wasn't worth it.  I definitely didn't think they were as good as the reviews suggested and my family didn't like them either.  Kids ended up having it for dinner the next night.  They aren't picky eaters and they were not amused and frankly I didn't blame them.   I made them just as directed.

Made this recipe but cut it in half. Added a lb of ground turkey, used Parnassians cheese instead of Mozzarella and didn't add any salt or veg stock..  Came out great... Best stuffed peppers yet!!!

These taste great! The recipe is easy to follow and you don't need too many ingredients either.
