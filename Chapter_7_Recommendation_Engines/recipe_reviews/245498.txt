Made this with farm tilapia and served it over white rice. I thought the amount of seasoning looked wimpy, but I stuck close to the recipe and was pleased with the light fresh taste.  The cooking time seemed excessive, so I only simmered about 30-35 minutes total and it was fine. I topped it with pan fried asparagus and fresh parsley, but wished I had had cilantro instead. Will definitely make this again.
