The final product tasted good and was a better-for-you option for breakfast that I was looking for, but the assembly was challenging.  When pouring the egg on top of the CAULIPOWER Margherita Pizza, it immediately poured off and got all over the place. I had to creatively adjust toppings to make an area for it to not pour over the sides. Next time I may precook the eggs and put on top to avoids spillage.  Once it was done it tasted really good and I enjoyed the cheesy flavor and crispy crust.

This tasted fine, but was a lot of work and time consuming to achieve the end product. I will try the CAULIPOWER products on their own so I can actually rate them fairly. I probably would not make this again-or if I did, I would scramble the egg white and sprinkle it along with the other toppings on the pizza. TIP: Do not use the egg white in the carton from the store. It runs off like water. I remade it with egg whites that I separated.

I think this was a great recipe. I used real bacon, so no oil was needed. I used 2 large eggs instead of just egg whites, and the mixture stayed on pretty well with no real spills. The only thing is each time, I didn't need to cook it as long as stated--I cut a couple minutes off each step, otherwise it would have burned in my oven. My only real issues were with the CAULIPOWER pizza itself. When I first baked it, I put it directly on the rack like I always do with frozen pizzas (and the box directions said it could be done that way)--it left a big mess. I used a pan once I put the egg mixture on. Also, the crust was just okay; I'm sure if I had to be gluten free, I would get used to it. Overall, I don't think I would have liked the CAULIPOWER Margherita pizza by itself, but with this recipe, it helped it to taste good.

This CAULIPOWER  breakfast pizza was great, like a quiche but you eat it with your hands!!  The crust is crispy and the pizza was delicious-tasting!!!  I want to say it was easy to make, but you be the judge.  I mixed the egg whites with a fork to make sure they they flowed easily and I did use a ladle to slowly pour the egg white/ veggie mixture on the pizza  and that helped, I also laid down parchment paper to catch any runoff.  This would be a terrific brunch item as well!!!
