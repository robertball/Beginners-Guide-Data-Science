I have this exact recipe in another book and I was surprised to see it rated so low on AR.  When I compared the two, this recipe skips a step in the cooking process.  After you dissolve the sugar, you need to continue cooking it over medium heat (without stirring) until it reaches 270 degrees.  Then, with your mixer turned on low, gradually pour it into the gelatin mixture until incorporated.  Turn mixer up to med/high speed and continue beating for at least 10 - 15 minutes. Hope this helps those who want to try their hand at homemade marshmallows.

the directions didn't make sense to me initally - I have always have used hot water to activate the gelatin before, so I halved the recipe, cooked the simple syrup over medium instead of low, and poured that over the gelatin/water combination. Before I added the hot syrup, I added 1/2 teaspoon orange extract & some orange food color to the gelatin/water mix. It whipped up beautifully, and I let it set in the refrigerator. They were great! I will make these in many flavors and dip them in chocolate for company.

This recipe is perfect (with just a touch of change to the instructions)... I put the water and gelatin to sit like in the original directions. Then I cooked the sugar and water till soft-ball stage (about 230 degrees) about 5-6 minutes.  I added the sugar water HOT to the gelatin in my kitchenaid mixer and started to whip on medium until it was foamy(about 1 minute).  Then switched to high for 12 minutes.  The mix doubles in size and when ready looks like marshmallow fluff (marshmallow in a jar). Poured mine into a baking pan sprinkled with a one to one ratio of corn starch and powdered sugar.  All was perfect.  thanks to those who wrote comments in their reviews....

I didn't have any unflavored gelatin, so I used a package of sugar free strawberry banana jello and halved the sugar and water in the syrup.  The first time I tried this, the gelatin sunk to the bottom like the other reviewers mentioned.  I decided to try it again.  I only whipped the jello for about three minutes the first time, and I suspected that was the problem.  The second time I tried this, I whipped it for ten minutes.  The mixture began to set up immediately.  I poured the hot syrup into the gelatin (like another reviewer did), and by the time I finished whipping the entire mixture was already cool.  I can't wait to try this with unflavored gelatin!  This is a good recipe, but the instructions were unclear.

I'm not sure if I made them right, they were sticky and foamy/fluffy after they set, but I cut them out with cookie cutters and did the sugar thing, only I used colored granulated as well as powdered and they came out like peeps. Taste better though, I hate peeps!Look at the pic

My mom first found this recipe on Martha Stewart's website- she had made them on a show.  She makes them all of the time and now I am addicted. I love these things!  When they are cooled, pull em out of the pan, cut them into desired size- I do about an inch...toss them with powdered sugar...Once you make homemade- you will never want to buy them again!  YUM!

To the pastry chef who reviewed...try it before reviewing!

This recipe is really amazing.  It works!  You don't need hot water to make the gelatin set, do it according to the recipe.  

To ensure success, you have to beat the mixture for 10 minutes, at least.  I do it in my stand mixer.  Also, it makes a huge amount, so I cut it in half.  To improve the flavor, I add a pinch of salt and 1 tsp vanilla (for a half-recipe).

Thanks for a great corn-free, egg-free recipe for my food-senstive family.

I've used this exact recipe for years and it works wonderfully. MARSHMALLOWS are NOT meringue , therefor do not need any egg whites. I also put vanilla extract or maple extract or whichever one I have on hand to add a twist. You can also coat them in chocolate, this has been my christmas treat/gift for the past 2-3 years and everyone is amazed. I make lumps with a spoon on waxed paper.

This seemed so easy, but they didn't turn out right.  They remained sticky and not as firm as i think they are supposed to be.  I'm not sure what to expect- I wasn't sure how close to commercial marshmellows they are of it they're totally different. HELP!

These turned pretty good! I was sceptical too because it only used gelatin, water and sugar but this was super easy. I do have a few pointers if it will help: one reveiwer noted that her syrup and gelatin separated, that could be because she didnt let the gelatin set completely. When whipping, it will turn white and foamy fairly fast but it is not done yet, you'll need to whip until it becomes thick, sticky and stringy, about 3-4 minutes. As with another reviewer said you don't need to let the syrup cool down completely either and it helps to break down the solidified mass of gelatin when it is still warm. For flavouring I added the seeds of a small vanilla bean, makes for a decadent taste. The 9x13 baking dish the recipe uses make the marshmallow rather thin, next time I'd use an 8x8 or even a loaf pan to make them thicker and I can cut them into cubes.

This is a good recipe especially if your favorite boys are allergic to corn and gluten.  The ingredient list does not list a flavor though and if you do not add a flavor to these they retain the stink and flavor of geletain.  After reading some of the reviews also I decided to make certain to bring my sugar up to the soft candy stage about 240 degrees and begin whipping it while the sugar was hot.  After about 3 minutes when the syrup became cloudy I added the gelatin mixture and whipped on the highest setting of my kitchenaid (I've had run ins with gelatin and whipping speed before) until the mixture was cool, white and held peaks.  After they came down to room temp I put it in the fridge like another member said until it set.  These were fabulous.  I can now make gluten free "rice krispie" treats yay!

I don't know what i did wrong, but the gelatine all sunk on the bottom of the pan... I'll make them again, because i liked the taste and the texture would have been right if it didn't separate. I haded red food coloring to a 1/4 of the mixture and poored over making a marbeled effect, they were pretty.

Worked perfectly for me. I did dust my pan with 1:1 corn starch/powdered sugar. Also, i cooked the sugar to 240 degrees, the soft ball stage. Did not let the syrup cool, just poured it hot into the gelatin. Whipped it with my little hand mixer for about 12 minutes, 8 of which were on high. Dusted the top with the corn starch mix. The next day, i toasted coconut and rolled the marshmallows in it. Pretty awesome.

The first time I did this recipe they turned out fine and tasted OK. It would have been better if I had dipped every peice in powdered sugar but that would have been too sweet and a bit too expensive. But I'm going to keep the recipe and whenever I make rice krispies I'll use this instead of storebought marshmallows. Just whip it up and pour in the cereal... it should be easy. For a tightwad like me, it was great!

I'm sure this would work and taste great if followed properly. That said, I tried making them with Splenda. NOT a success. The marshmallows did not set up properly. Follow the recipe right and they'll be great.

These are good, but a little foamy and not as fluffy as you might want.  They stay very moist.  However, very quick and easy, and still with the marshmallow taste.

I tried this...  It turned out pretty bad...   Usually marshmallow needs corn syrup...   It got runny, so I'm not sure, how the photo's marshmallow is holding up!??   Also, sugar must be heated up to 120C/240F...  Direction is unclear...   Somebody said you need white egg, but you don't need to add egg white, and still tawtes pretty good....

Always on the look out for candy recipes that work at my altitude. I made some big changes to recipe too ensure it didn't recrystallize. Added 1 cup light corn syrup to sugar mixture and an extra packet of gelatin. Added 1/4 tsp of vanilla after i pulled the sugar off the heat.

I was looking for a homemade marshmallow recipe. I got one out of my newspaper and got one of Martha stewarts. I was looking on here for one and came across this. The ingredients didn't seem right. After checking the other recipes..they only call for 2 1/2 Tbsp. of unf. gelatin and 1 cup of lt. corn syrup..plus pure vanilla extract. That could be why these are turning out.

This recipe did not work!  What you get is runny,  sugary jello with a foamy layer on top.  Bleah.  The recipe I found which did work also used corn syrup (I used brown rice syrup,  actually),  a lot more gelatin,  and egg whites.

I am an apprentice baker and I make marshmallows regularly in my bakery. This recipe is not complete. The key to the texture of marshmallws is the temperature of the syrup. The syrup must be brought to just below the softball stage on a candy thermometer. There are also a couple of ingredients missing, namely cornsyrup and salt.

I made this to use in a rice crispy treat recipe, followed the directions & the tip to add vanilla extract. I used the recipe just after beating (about 12 minutes, until it looked like marshmallow fluff) and mixed with my cereal. The taste is amazing! Puts store bought mallows to shame! I will be making this again and if that turns out well I will make these for gifts (dipped in chocolate, rolled in  coconut flakes). I will probably use two spoons and attempt to make little balls and put a wooden skewer in them to make it easier to gift. Omit the coconut & this presentation would probably make a convenient stirrer for hot chocolate. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I gave this four stars because I didn't make it according to the actual directions, I followed other reviewers instructions instead. I love this recipe as I am allergic to raw/undercooked eggs.

great marshmallows, we make them every year at christmas to go on top of our hot coco. I even brought them to work  with a big crock pot full of hot chocolate for a potluck. everyone loved then and raved about how good they are. they do not dissolve into nothing in your hot drink, they melt but make this yummy thick cap of marshmellow goodness that you have to eat with a spoon.

Mine came out perfectly, were great! I added vanilla extract and two pinches of salt, as recommended in another review for flavor. And after I cut them, I coated them in powdered sugar.

I don't have a candy thermometer, so maybe it was a fluke that I stopped heating the sugar syrup at the right time haha. If it helps anyone else, I kept dropping a small amount in ice water and stopped heating it (immediately poured into gelatin mixture) when it stopped sinking as threads and instead formed a teardrop shape that smushed upon landing at the bottom of the cup. I was able to scoop it out and manipulate it with my fingers without it falling apart.

My first attempt was with the recipe in half.  Don't do that!  The gelatin set up too much and then caused lumps.  I also did not get the sugar mixture hot enough, second mistake.  So, my second attempt, I made full recipe and used a new candy thermometer. Followed directions much more closely, with vanilla added. Turned out great! I put mine in a 8x8 pan and have "jumbo" (tall) mallows. I'm anxious to keep playing with this recipe; different flavors, add color, use cookie cutters, etc!

These marshmallows are delicious!  Thank you DIZ for sharing the extra cooking step!  I followed those directions and they came out perfectly.  The kids love them and I've been told to never buy storebought again!  I also added 2 t vanilla to the gelatin just before I added the syrup.  Will definitely make again!

First, the recipe is simple, BUT the results are terrible.    I had these, because I was going to make home made rice crispy treats.  Yeah call me crazy.  I followed the directions as written.  Stored my 9x13 baking dish in my microwave oven overnight (to prevent my kitties from tossing them on the floor).  In the morning, there were a thick crispy crust on the marshmallows, this was a foreshadow to what my treat turned out like, hard, not chewy and a waste.  I will not be making this recipe ever again.  In reviewing other recipes, maybe using a recipe with some corn syrup would yield a better results... So everyone, this was my results...

I make these all of the time. But instead of the 1/2 cup of water added to the gelatin, I add a 1/2 cup of cooked fruit puree or jam instead. It’s better to use fruit because you are already adding 2c of sugar. It doesn’t need to be any sweeter. Depending on the fruit, you may have a denser marshmallow because of the pectin in the fruit. But they are so much better than just plain. I have done berry, mango, passion fruit, yuzu. So easy and so yummy.
