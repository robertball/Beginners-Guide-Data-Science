Great variation from the typical grilled cheese sandwich. Saute the leeks to cut down on the "onion" flavor of the leek and it's a great sandwich!

This is a super rich sandwich! All that yummy cheese, the buttered bread... wow! I love leeks, I love cheese, I love butter, I love bread. Bring them all together and it's almost TOO rich! Next time I'll add more tomato as a balancing agent, but this is a great sandwich.

Much too rich, decrease the cheese and use less leaks for sure, sauteing the leaks in butter first helps soften them but it makes for an even richer sandwich with the addition of even more butter.  I dont think ill make this again.  My boyfriend liked it ok.  We added turkey lunch meat.

I used fresh mozzarella instead of cheddar. The sandwich was rich and tasty. I shared the recipe with some of my co-workers that are observing lent and not eating meat on fridays. They love it!

So rich and yummy!  This will be just a once and a while sandwich for me but it is delicious and better be for all those calories! Did not find the leeks overpowering AT ALL!   I used a wheat berry bread but that was my only change.  Thanks!

Fantastic update to the standard grilled cheese. Made this for lunch today, put on a little Tony Bennett Duets and was loving life! I sauteed the leeks as another reviewer suggested and this made a huge difference! I also used mozzerella instead of white cheddar and was very happy with the results. I will be sharing this one with my girlfriends.

I tried this recipe to use up leftover ingredients, I had a leek, tomatoes, yellow cheddar cheese and 1 piece of chicken.  It seemed the right fit and it turned out to be a delicious sandwich.  I followed the directions but added cut up cooked chicken and diced the tomatoes then tossed it all together with Hellman's Mayo before spreading it on whole wheat bread because that's what we had.  Added the cheese and grilled.  We did not find this to be too rich but just right.  I did not need to saut√© the leeks like other reviewers since they were all mixed in with the chicken, tomatoes and mayo.  Just make sure you cut them small enough and they won't bother you raw.  A unique, but worth a try recipe.
