This was a simple and straightforward recipe without the 'hundred and two ingredient' list often associated with GF baking.  We were able to mix it up and be eating within minutes of looking up the recipe!  Thanks for the great pancakes!!!

A good GF recipe. The pancakes were light and fluffy, and a little crispy.

Good pancakes! We are not dairy free, so we used a regular yogurt and milk. Thanks for a good recipe!

I made these and was excited that there weren't too many ingredients.  They burned very easily.  By the time they were solid enough to flip, they were almost black.  I added blueberries to them and maybe that increased the water too much. If adding something tame like blueberries messes with a recipe that much though, it should be mentioned.  I gave them two stars because they did actually taste pretty good.

It was a great recipe and will become a breakfast staple. I had to change it due to my child's allergies and what I had on hand. I used 1/2 cup brown rice flour and 1/2 cup sorghum flour.  I used 1 1/4 cup apple sauce instead of soy yogurt. I left out the cinnamon and the vegetable oil.

I love the ratings and have been looking for a good pancake recipe. I cannot have soy or dairy. What could I use instead of the soy yogurt?

I haven't tried this recipe yet ,but have been trying different recipes gluten and dairy free. I have had great success and great failures cooking and baking gluten free. To answer the person about the pancakes and hoe she can replace the soy, for fluffy pancakes. Use almond milk and a table spoon of vinegar if can tolerate vinegar. The vinegar will curdle the almond milk like buttermilk and will give light and fluffy pancakes.

Excellent recipe! Just made those, so delicious and easy to make. I used brown rice flour instead of white, vanilla coconut yoghurt instead of soya, coconut oil instead of vegetable, and added a couple of table spoons of ground flax seeds. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is an excellent and versatile alternative to traditional buttermilk pancakes. We used coconut milk and coconut milk yogurt, and also added gf vegan chocolate chips when the pancakes were on the griddle. I would recommend cooking these at a lower temperature for a longer period to cook thoroughly and avoid burning. Ours were a delicious golden color and cooked perfectly. We set the griddle for 275 degrees (medium-low heat) and let the griddle heat up for 10 mins, then sprayed with cooking spray. We cooked each batch for 2 1/2 mins per side.

These were light and fluffy.. I used coconut oil, Almond milk and added fresh blueberries..  They were perfect.  Great basic recipe to make your own version of perfection.   Also, I didn't have yoghurt, so used a little dairy free sour cream..it worked fine.  I think this recipe can be adjusted to what you have on hand and still come out just fine.  I gave 4 stars for flexibility...

Not sure what happened, but like another reviewer I couldn't get these to "cook".  The outsides were way too dark and the inside just remained goopey.  I tried cooking on really low heat for longer as well and no luck.

I loved these and so did my husband and 7 year old son. They are light and a good texture. I used white rice flour as I had no sweet rice flour, and added about 1/8 tsp xanthan gum (to hopefully make up for the sweet rice flour). I also added about 1 tbsp Zero sweetener (erythritol) and used regular dairy whole milk yogurt.

A great gluten free recipe! My husband even prefers these to regular pancakes!  I substituted the rice milk for almond milk and the vegetable oil for coconut oil.  These pancakes are delicious!

The salt was too much. They turned out, but next time I will skip the salt.

Great and simple recipe! I love it when I can find a recipe, make it and be enjoying the meal in under 20 minutes. I added fresh blueberries, super tasty!
