good sauce, very tasty! added an onion and clove of garlic for extra flavor, and doubled the amount of sweet peppers and tomato.

I made this recipe and loved it.  It was easy, flavorful and I could eat as much as I wanted without feeling guilty.  I served it with multigrain noodles and my kids topped it with parmesaen.  I used 1 can chicken broth, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 yellow pepper diced, 2 full tablespoons of frozen apple juice concentrate, and 5 chicken breasts.  I ended up cooking everything except the chicken earlier in the day.  Once I had the chicken done on both sides in the pan I threw everything in a baking dish into the oven 350 until it was slightly thickened (20-30 min).  I will double the sauce next time.

this was really good, and super easy! I made mine with a medly of sweet peppers (red, yellow and orange). It adds sweetness and color.

Just adding to the peanut gallery --very easy and tasty to make!  I was going to make fajitas again but I'm glad I found this recipe instead - basically the same ingredients.  I had a jalapeno and a serrano pepper on hand, so I made a spicy sauce instead of a sweet sauce.  Added more flavor during the dredge - chili powder, cumin, ground cayenne, garlic powder.  Also threw in the tomatoes before the reduction and not after.

Loved this!  I had a lot of yellow yummy peppers to use up and this was a great way to use them.  The broth and wine made a great buttery sauce, served over israeli couscous.  I will definitely make this again.

My boyfriend made this for me last week... His first time ever following a recipe.  However, since I am gluten intolerant, he substituted the flour for two parts corn starch and 1 part gluten free corn "bread" crumbs.  Delicious!  Certainly a new favorite.

I am not usually a fan of entrees based on peppers, but this one is great. It's not a meal you put in your weekly rotation, but definitely one to pull out every once in awhile.

I made the dish without cilantro to see how it would be and the taste was a little bland BUT after I added a tablespoon of sofrito (a popular Latin American puree that blends red bell peppers, garlic, onions, cilantro depending on what recipe you use and is the basis for many dishes) in place of the plain cilanto the flavor was improved.  I think you could saute the sofrito along with the wine, red pepper mix for the best flavor rather than adding it at the end like I did.  Served this on a bed of whole wheat pasta, garlic bread and stuffed mushrooms.  Will definitely make again!

This was so easy to make and very tasty!  Also re-heats really well for leftover night.

We truly thought this dish was great -- followed the directions, but just added a few minor touches to make it my own. I first cooked up a little onion and garlic, and used that for my base. I aslo used almost a whole can of chicken broth, and a touch more white wine, and a pinch of red pepper flakes once everything was in the pool. I added garlic powder to the flour before I seasoned the chicken, and lots of cilantro at the end! I served it over linguine and almost wish I had a little more liquid for the leftovers (someone left a review indicating that this dish didn't keep well for leftovers, but that was not the case) -- it was so yummy!

Signed up just to write a review here :) This was a great way to use up some of the tomatoes and peppers we keep getting in our CSA! I cut up the chicken in kid bite size pieces before breading, added onion and garlic with the chicken in the pan, used twice the amount of tomatoes and peppers, and used additional chicken broth instead of wine.  We ate it over mashed honey gold potatoes.  The kids loved it so much they asked for me to fix it every night and say it's "even better than mac n cheese".  Winner!  Thanks so much!

I made this last night with some forced omissions/substitutions...we're on vacation and the local grocery store doesn't carry exotic delicacies like cilantro;-).  It was delicious, even with the incomplete recipe, and I'm sure it'll be even better then next time I make it with all of the correct ingredients!  
**I wasn't sure how long to cook the dish after adding the tomatoes, but I ended up cooking it for quite a bit longer (thick chicken). The tomatoes boiled down to make the sauce much thicker...and it was fantastic!

So I changed it a little ... I mixed the flower with garlic salt, kosher salt and pepper. Used olive oil instead of butter. After the chicken was cooked until golden I added two cloves of minced garlic, the bell pepper, and balsamic vinegar and let it get caramelized. Then I added the wine and broth. I ommitted the cilantro and used saffron instead. Mmmm Mmmm!!!!! Served it over a bed of whole wheat spaghetti!

Thought we had nothing in the house... Entered what we had and this came up... So very glad it did! I made it for the wife and I, surprised her with it, cooked oven chips and green beans with it, we both thoroughly enjoyed it and I have added it to the recipe book! Oh and accidenlty used beef stock which I found out later, but tasted great!

i didn't have cilantro so i added a dash or two of italian seasoning.  tastes like chicken cacciatori in a skillet (vs the oven ~ too hot to turn it on!).  It's good.  thank you for a supper idea.

I made this using a mix of colored peppers, sliced grape tomatoes and added some mushrooms to the mix that needed to be used.  I got this started early in the afternoon by first sautéing my mushrooms and removing them from the pan.  I then sautéed the peppers for a few minutes and added the broth and wine and let it reduce.  I did end up thickening this with a little cornstarch/water slurry – just enough to give it some body.  I let it cool somewhat before adding the mushrooms and tomatoes.  When it was time for dinner I gently reheated my sauce while sautéing the chicken.  Worked out great!  This does not produce a lot of sauce so if you’re serving it over rice or pasta, you may want to double the broth and wine.

Honestly I thought this was going to be pretty bland but I tried it out.  I added a lot more cilantro because I love it.  I have to say, that this is REALLY good.  I am taking the recipe to a friend tonight!!

I really liked this recipe.  The chicken comes out very tender.  I used garlic pepper instead, which always add a tastier kick.  Easy to prepare and excellent overall.  Thank you!

The chicken turned out fantastic, but the sweetvpepper sauce was underwhelming.  All in all pretty good meal I will make when I find myself with an abundance of sweet peppers.

Absolutely phenomenal. I used Moscato wine and canned (fired roasted) diced tomatoes. The chicken was just about the juiciest I'd ever had. Preparation was simple and straight forward. I served with rice, but there wasn't much juice left in the pan to pour over it. Perhaps I'll add a bit more broth and wine next time.

We loved this!  I cooked in a skillet instead of the oven but other than that followed the recipe.  I will make this again.

I added sauteed garlic to give the sauce/chicken a flavor boost, I used a little less wine and a little more chicken broth,and I used deboned leg/meat.  The flavor was very good, but I did not like the presentation after cooking the chick in the sauce.  Next time I will saute the meat until cooked through, remove the chick, make the sauce, then plate the chicken and serve the sauce on top. 
This is really easy and quick and I will make it again.
