I'm not being totally fair to this recipe, as I baked these in the oven.  The bacon was delicious.  My strawberries were very ripe, I think too ripe for this recipe-they were extremely sweet after baking, too sweet for the bacon.  If I were to make it again I would use medium-ripe strawberries and cook the bacon to a flexible state, then stuff each strawberry with a partially cooked piece of bacon to avoid overcooking the strawberries.  Then I would proceed with grilling or baking the strawberries.  This was a fun project on a rainy afternoon while I baked bacon for the freezer.  I used a small paring knife to make a hole completely through the strawberries, but a straw would work great if one was available.

Tried this out over the weekend and they were delicious.  I used a potato peeler to dig out the stem which leaves a good hole to put a lot of bacon.  I used about 9 strips of bacon for 25 strawberries but next time I would use more.
Also finished the strawberries with melted chocolate.

Because of limited grill space I cooked these at a low temperature on a grate.  Next time I would go with a higher heat to get some grill marks and take off before the strawberries get soft.
