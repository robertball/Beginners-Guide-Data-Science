This is a great recipe. It's got the right amount of flavor, my husband and I love it. My daughter grew fresh basil so that made it taste even better.

For ease, this recipe deserves a 5 or more.  Taste was probably a 3 for me. I was tempted to add onions but decided to make it as written. The colors were pretty and the taste was good but the flavor had no depth. I think it would be good with onions and a splash of white wine.  Maybe even mushrooms. It is 104 degrees here today so I really appreciated a recipe that could be done in the microwave. Thanks!

I had to use dried basil due to the season but it was still very good ... and so so easy!
