Honestly, this doesn't even deserve one star.  Let me tell you why.  So, after reading other reviews I decided to cut back on the sugar too.  But I only added 2 1/2 cups of sugar to 5 heaping cups of rhubard.  Just so I could add more sugar as I wanted.  Once it was all cooked down, I tasted it to see it to see if I wanted more sugar.  It was so sweet I couldn't even eat it, it made my teeth hurt.  And it still called for mooorrreee sugar.  So I went to the store and got five more stalks of rhubarb, added that, and added the zest of a lemon and lemon juice. I didn't even add the jello for fear of how much sweeter it would be. It is still so sweet no one will eat it.  If you actually made the recipe like it called for, I can't even imagine.  I am going to try and use all the 'jam' I made as a glaze on meat.  Move on, do not make this unless you like your jam pure sugar with no rhubarb flavor!

I love the flavor and ease of this jam, but it was way too sweet for me.  I cut the sugar in half and only used 1 3oz. pkg. of strawberry jello and 1 envelope of Knox unflavored gelatin.  I also added 1 quart cut fresh strawberries and cooked it just a few minutes longer (for the berries).  With added fruit it yeilded 8 - 8oz jars.

The first batch I made - came out very sugary.  Checked the reviews and found out that the volume of chopped rhubarb changed from 1 cup to 5 cups.  So, made it again.  What a difference!  Turned out great.  Used crushed raspberries instead of pineapple.  Worked great.  Let it set - since it doesn't have pectin, it takes longer to gel.  But, very tasty!

I MAKE MANY JARS FOR MY FAMILY. FOR A CHANGE TRY USING RASPBERRY GELATIN AND INSTEAD OF THE PINEAPPLE USE FRESH OR FROZEN THAWED RASPBERRIES. ALSO CAN DO THE SAME WITH BLACKBERRIES

I used two packages of knox gelatin (be sure to soften in water before adding to hot mixture)and one of strawberry jello.  This is by far the best recipe for Rhubarb Jam, yet so simple to make.  Try adding some walnuts too! Ohhhh so good.

I love this recipe!! This was the first time I've ever made jam and it came out perfect. I had to use strawberries instead of pineapple though. Also, I used two tsp. of gelatin and the consistency turned out great! A new favorite in my house! Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe for a quick jam.  I've always known this as "Sunshine Jam" when my mom made it when I was growing up.  I love this on toast.

I'm sorry to say this, but this is no rhubarb jam! Wayyyy TOO sweet. I officially made my own recipe, and will be posting it online soon. Rhubarb is sour, so the jam is suppose to be partly sour. I used only 1.5 cups of sugar and non-flavored gelatin (only about 14g). I gave one star, but it doesn't deserve one or more star, unless you are looking for a too sweet jam that has no taste of rhubarb whatsoever.

I doubled this recipe to use up a large amount of Grandma's frozen rhubarb from last summer. I tried to follow the recipe as close as I could as well as using what I had on hand. I only had one 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks so I whirred it in the blender and just went with the one can. (I was going to add another can of something else but in the end, I didn't.) I also used sugar free Jello--as that was all I had on hand. Even cutting back the sugar by half was way too sweet. It'll work because it used what I had on hand but it really is too sweet. Using the one can of pineapple for a double recipe gave me the perfect thickness so I'm glad I went that route. Next time, I might add a little lemon juice for a little more tartness.

This jam was quick, easy and turned out great.  Be sure to note that it takes two 3oz. regular packages or one 6oz. package of jello.

If I wanted to spread jello on my toast I would just do that instead of ruining in season, expensive rhubarb.  Why did I go to all of the trouble to make something homemade just to use something full of artificial flavours and colours? It is also so sweet it makes me cringe and I am embarrassed to even give it away.  Oh well.

I agree with it being a little too sweet, but I made mine with 11 cups of Rhubarb, 4 cups of sugar, 1 (20)oz crushed pineapple, 4 Tbs pectin and 1 (3oz) pk of strawberry gelatin and it turned out great!

I have been making this recipe for at least 15 years with a few twists!   Like, let it sit with the ingredients except for the jello for 30 minutes and boil for 12 minutes then add the jello and jar. Place it in the jars and when cool I have just kept it in the frig and I have frozen it.  Either seemed to work ok.  Lois

SO EASY!! Even if you've never made jam or done any canning before, you can do this recipe! I was a little worried that it would be too sweet since a couple other reviewers said it was but it is PERFECT!! My son, who loves strawberry rhubarb jam ever since someone gave us a jar as a gift, thinks I am the greatest since I can now make his favorite jam!! I will be making this jam all summer! Thank You!

Five stars because family loved it.  Got about 6 regular jars worth, as recipe says.  Froze three container's worth in plastic containers and filled 3 (unsterilized, but washed by hand) jars with the hot jam liquid and stored the jars in fridge.  Jars seal themselves if mixture is hot enough, I did not know that, so don't let it cool down too much before you put it in the jars.  The jam gets quite thick in the fridge, almost a solid hunk, but you can spread it.  One complaint - I would like more rhubarb flavour from a rhubarb jam, it's quite sweet and tastes more of the jello or the pineapple...but it does taste GOOD.  Maybe reduce sugar or try a less sweet jello flavour?  Add more rhubarb?  I'll mess around.  So much rhubarb to use, anyways...

I have never cooked with rhubarb before but I didn't want to see my rhubarb plants go to waste. I tried this recipe and it was so easy and the jam came out perfect and my husband can't seem to get enough of it.

This jam is an old family favorite! My mom always made it with rhubarb from the garden. It is sweet, but I was expecting it to be because I had it so many times before. VERY easy and yummy! You can substitute different flavors of jello and add different fruits too for variety (for example I might cut back on the rhubarb and add strawberries or raspberries).

I substituted frozen strawberries for the pineapple and it has a nice flavor.  I also reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups.  Good, fast recipe.

We love this recipe - I made this last year for family, friends, gifts, and for us.  Received great comments from all and requests for the recipe.  My dad and nephew are continually wanting to trade their empty jelly jars for a new full one.

I too have substituted 1 cup frozen, unsweetened fruit (to match whatever jello I'm using) for pineapple for variations.

Thank you - I'll be using this as my standard rhubarb & fruit recipe.

Thanks

Vile. Real rhubarb jam and jelly doesn't involve crushed pineapple and strawberry jello to mar the taste of the rhubarb. A friend of mine made this and we tossed it. Made a real jam from scratch the next day.

I thought this was pretty good jam and liked the combination of fruit.  I did cut back on the sugar some and still found it too sweet for my taste.  Will add more rhubarb and less sugar next time.  Jars sealed properly and the texture was good.

This was my first attempt at rhubarb jam.  I followed the recipe and added some Certo since some of the feedback said it was too runny.  Even with that, I would have preferred it to be more solid.  I'm sure it won't be wasted but the recipe needs to be adjusted somewhat.

I found this recipe way too sweet and very runny. I added another two cups of rhubarb and a couple of tablespoons of jello powder. It turned out great.

I made the recipe using the ingredients listed.  It didn't make 6 pints.  Did I do something wrong or are the ingredient amounts wrong?

This recipe should call for 10 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of sugars.  Even 2 cups is too sweet for us.  I would start with 1 cup and work my way up if you don't like that real sweet taste.  As written I would not give it any stars.  There is another recipe on this site.

Holy Cow can you say sweet.  Following this recipe the jam is honestly too sweet to eat.  I think it's using the strawberry gelatin because people that used Knox instead of flavored gelatin seemed to like the recipe.

This is the jam that one of my grandmothers used to make when I was little.  She called it Rhubarb-Pineapple jam but it was the same as this.  I was so happy to find this recipe.  I've never made jam before so this was my first try.  So far it tastes great, but it doesn't seem to be as good as my Grandma's...might just be in my head though.  Anyway, I didn't use as much sugar as was called for and I switched most of it for Splenda.

This is the best Rhubarb jam I have ever tasted. We can't stop eating it. It is also so simple to make it's unbelievable. I will be planting more rhubarb next year!

I made this recipe last year (my first time making anything with rhubarb) and my family went through 12 jars in under 2 months, even my mother in law was impressed. It is the best recipe that I have ever found for jam or jelly.

My batch turned out great!  Everyone loves it. I cut the sugar back by about 1/4 cup so that there's a little tartness.  I'm now going to try a batch with a different jello flavour.

This was the first time I ever attempted to make jam or jelly and the result was WONDERFUL!  I didn't have any jelly jars so I used small tupperware containers and after they cooled to around room temperature I refrigerated overnight.  After refrigeration the jam was a perfect consistency.  Rave reviews from all the folks who benefited from "gifts" of jam!

Just great and sooo simple to make!  I used 8 cups of rhubarb and used cranberry jello instead of the strawberry.  Rave reviews from hubby!

I first tried this recipe 3 years ago when I moved into a house with 7 giant rhubarb plants. It is my absolute favorite of any jams I make - it’s tart and sweet and flavorful. It’s nust delicious.

Made twice the recipe because we have way too much rhubarb growing in our yard.  My girlfriend loved it.  

Personally I found that the other ingredients entirely overpowered the taste of the rhubarb.  Too sweet for my liking, and the strawberry jello gave it a very artificial taste.  I guess it's just personal preference, but definitely not for me.
