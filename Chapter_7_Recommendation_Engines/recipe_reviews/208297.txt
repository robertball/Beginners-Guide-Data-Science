This was delicious, quick, and healthy.  I made it as written except that I added a bit of dried wakame (seaweed) after the mushrooms.  Used half a "brick" of tofu.

This was quick and easy. I add some seaweed instead of tofu and worked like a charm. Will definitely make this again.

My husband and son both have a fish allergy so this is a great alternative to using dashi stock.  We love it!

GREAT and easy recipe for my first time making miso soup.  Tastes much like the soup at our favorite Japanese restaurant.  Thanks for sharing it!

I am not familiar with Japanese cuisine, so I can say nothing about the authencity of this soup. Overall, we liked the taste, but we didn`t enjoyed it so much. Maybe the main reason for it is that we didn`t like the taste of the miso paste so much. I think the soup was lacking something, but I don`t know what I want to see here at this point. I added more shiitake mushrooms than the recipe calls for.

This was just an ok soup. It was lacking... something. I'm not an expert about miso soup. It was edible, not bad, some of the crowd I made it for enjoyed it but I could tell it was basically a half-assed attempt.

I replaced the Shitake mushrooms with Chantrelle mushrooms and then poured it over a well cooked yam in my soup bowl.  It was wonderful but I think pumpkin or another squash would work just as well.

We used vegetable boullion instead of broth and that made it come out much too salty. The recipe should specify unsalted broth. Otherwise, I was happy to see a miso recipe without the dashi granuals, because I couldn't find those, and I've been wanting to make miso soup. I'll try it again.

Pretty good for being so simple and you have to reeaally love cooked mushrooms (which I do).  No wow factor but light and comforting at the same time.
I added a little wakame and served it with a wedge salad with carrots and pea shoot and ginger dressing. I feel megahealthy!

This was delicious, but perhaps because of the miso I used, I had to add 1.5 cups of water to the 2 serving portion I made because it was too salty. I might try adding seaweed, daikon, enoki, and other ingredients next time to make it a little more interesting.

Great recipe.  I made it once with the soy sauce, but it was too salty.  I left it out the second and the family loved it.  I also added pieces of seaweed with the green onions.

I made the soup as written. I'm no expert on Miso soup, but I thought the taste was very good. I actually made it for my daughter, the vegetarian. She said it was a keeper but to put less soy sauce in it next time.

I really like this recipe, quick, easy and delicious.  I am not a big fan of dashi stock so I really like that it uses veg stock for this recipe.

So good and so quick! I've made it twice so far. The first time, I accidentally put way too much soya sauce so it was good but a little too salty. I also didn't have Miso paste. The second time though, I had Miso paste and I didn't overdo the soya sauce. It was DELICIOUS! I made several additions to the recipe though. I don't like tofu so I replaced it with thin pieces of beef. I also added udon and every vegetable I could find in my fridge/freezer. What a hearty, healthy and tasty soup it made! Definitely a meal on it's own if you make it the way I did.  Even with all that, it didn't take me more than about 25-30 min to make (including boiling/simmering time). I highly recommend this for people with little time on their hands. I doubled the recipe and froze half for days where there's just no time to cook.

I have just recently started trying to cook healthy. This was easy and delicious! I could not find miso paste but I did find a dry miso powder mix and my grocery store. It still came out really good! I accidentally made the mistake of buying soft tofu which i regret. So buy the firm tofu!

For my first miso soup attempt, I liked this recipe. It was easy, quick, and fun to try something new. I did add sea weed. The soup was salty, which is normal for miso, but I think next time I'll at least use low-sodium soy sauce and less BTB veggie base for the same amount of water (I just used as recommended on the jar).

It's a great miso base recipe! You can customized this soup to your liking..I've been looking for a good miso broth and this one is perfect! I added veggies to mine. I used bokchoy, watercress, potato, 3 types of mushrooms (I love it in my soup) enoki,portabello and white and I used udon noodles! Season to your liking, if it needs more salt, then do so! Topped it with green onions then served piping hot!
