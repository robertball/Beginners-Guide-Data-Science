**EVERYONE SHOULD MAKE THIS RECIPE** Every single one of my 35 guests raved about this fantastic dinner. It melted in your mouth. I marinated for 10 hrs in the fridge, then cooked on LOW in a crock pot/slow cooker for alsmot 12 hours. Then added the bbq sauce mixture (made a double batch so it was sloppy & juicy-hubby likes it that way!)& put it back in the slow cooker for another 1 or 2 hours. Served on soft rolls. I will make this again & again. (to serve 35 people I made 3 9 pd briskets) along with a bunch of other sides. THANK YOU!!!

Believe it or not, I thought this tasted better WITHOUT the last step of adding the BBQ sauce/cooking for the extra hour--here's why; After being cooked at 275 degrees for 1 hr per lb., the meat sliced beautifully and tasted moist and flavorful. After adding the BBQ sauce and cooking for another hour, the meat was more like pulled pork, which tasted ordinary--even my picky 5 year old daughter preferred it w/o the sauce!. Note: I rubbed in 2 1/2 Tbsp of Wright's liquid smoke into the meat; my dry rub was 2 1/2 teasp Kosher salt, 1/2 teasp freshly ground pepper, 2 teasp onion POWDER, and 1 1/2 teasp garlic POWDER--combined in a small bowl then rubbed into the meat. I will use this recipe again for sandwiches, or any other use requiring cooked meat--really tasty!!

Great stuff, am making again.  Reccomendations: Don't worry about the celery salt.  Also after cooking take out of the oven and let sit for an 45 minutes to re-absorb the juices before cutting and adding sauce.  Also when initial slicing, slice across the grain of the meat.

This is our favorite oven-baked brisket recipe. The meat is moist and tender and the flavor goes well with the sauce...which is now my favorite BBQ sauce. We've used this recipe several times and have two ways of finishing the brisket. If my husband is home (he's the grill-man) I use less liquid smoke and have him throw the brisket on the grill with either hickory or mesquite chunks during the last 1/3 of the cooking time. This gives the meat a nice brown grilled texture and flavor and adds a bit of smoke flavor to the meat. If he's not home I double the liquid smoke and remove the foil during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking after slicing and adding sauce to caramelize the sauce a bit...makes it richer on top of the meat. We always double or triple the sauce and serve the extra on the side. I find that the sauce has better flavor if made the day before the brisket and left to sit in the refrigerator overnight...lets the flavors mingle.

I made this in a crock pot for Super Bowl XLI.  I used the modified instructions that were listed by member "TLQUICK".  It was a delight before adding the barbecue sauce and made better after the addition of the sauce.  It has a zesty, smoky, buttery taste.  I served it on petite Kaiser rolls.  It tasted like I put a lot of work into it but the recipe was low maintenance.

UPDATE:  I made it a second time and tried cutting the recipe in half.  It didn't work out very well.  Don't scale it down.

This has become our favorite family dinner.  By preparing the meat the night before and cooking all day in the slow cooker, it makes a great weekday dinner.  I always make enough for leftovers.  Note - I use garlic powder rather than garlic salt in preparing the meat.  The first time I made it with both onion and garlic salt, it came out too salty for our taste.

Hey Cathy...those of us from West Texas know a good brisket recipe when we see it...and no one knows how to prepare them any better.  My favorite food is brisket sandwiches with mustard and cheese..(may sound odd, but it's sooo good.)  Definitely marinate this overnight so the flavors are absorbed by the meat. I cook mine in a reynold's turkey bag. What a great recipes.  Thanks so much!!

This is very good. I made it in my crock-pot, I seasoned the brisket for 2-days in frig then just placed the meat along with the sauce in my cp and cooked on low for about 14hrs. My family enjoyed the flavor and the leftovers were wonderful. Thnx for the quick & easy recipe.

My whole family loved this meal.  I followed others suggestions and doubled the sauce.  This was a good suggestion, I used the leftover sauce to make bbq chicken and it was a hit also.  I did spice up the sauce somewhat.  We like things spicy...I added fresh garlic and some red pepper flakes.  I also doubled the liquid smoke.  The only other change I made was to use fresh garlic and onion for the marinade.  TRY THIS ONE.  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!

Like Amye Baker, I'm a novice at briskets and have never made one before so I was nervous but I'm willing to try anything once and this recipe sounded sooo good! Glad I tried it. Like others, doubled the sauce and everything was wonderful. My boyfriend is thrilled to be taking the leftover sandwiches to work with him tomorrow! (I'm taking some too)! Moist, flavorful, juicy sum this recipe up! I can't wait to be the hit of the party with this recipe at this summer's BBQ!

I have cooked brisket many times and this is by far one of my favorite recipes! I took the advice of other reviewers and put it in the slow cooker after marinating over night. I cooked it for about 10 hours on low (I think 12 hours would have been too long) and then I added the sauce and cooked for another 2 hours. I also took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce...that's a must! The brisket was so tender it just fell apart and was packed with flavor! My family gobbled this up and there were hardly any leftovers! Will certainly be making this again and again! I served it with potato salad, corn on the cob and baked beans! Thank you soooooo much for this recipe! This Texan is mighty impressed!

Bought a HUGE brisket from Sam's Club so cut it in half and put spices and liquid smoke over both pieces. Baked one piece using the sauce and one without and have to say I prefer the meat without the sauce as I felt it overpowered the flavor of the meat. Meat on its own was tender, moist, and tasty. If I make the sauce again I'd add less to the meat that final hour and serve remainder on the side to people can add according to preference.

I am rating this a 5 because it sounds like if I make it I will, but I have question.  After marinading the brisket in the foil, did you remove brisket from foil and put in large roaster and cover?  Directions do not state and you know what assume can do.

Absolutely the best brisket recipe I've ever had, seen or heard of!  My husband couldn't get enough.  First I used 1 tbsp each onion powder and garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste along with the liquid smoke.  I only marinated it for 3 hours, then I cooked it in 300* oven for 5 hours.  I let it cool for 25 minutes, then sliced it.  The brisket tasted amazing as it was, so I didn't bother cooking it with the sauce for the extra hour, really was good at that point.  I did double the bbq sauce, and this was a real winner too!  I served the sauce on the side.  I will use only this recipe for brisket from now on!!!

I don't know that this one can be improved upon.  I followed the recipe to the "T," and was very happy with the results, as were my wife and mother-in-law.  I suppose it's common sense, but be sure to watch the size of your brisket.  Mine was smaller than the recipe called for and finished up in two hours.  The next time I make this recipe, I may lower the oven temp and cook longer, though I don't think the meat could have been much more tender than it was.  The sauce was superb, just the right combination of smoke flavor and sweetness.  I prepared the sauce after I put the meat in the oven, then refrigerated it--thinking this would allow more time for the flavors to mesh.  It worked great.  I couldn't be more happy with the results.  Smashing!

I found this recipe to be great. It is time consuming but easy and very tasty. I had never made brisket before, I guess a bit intimidated by it, but since finding this recipe it has become a monthly meal. We do like a bit spicier BBQ sauce so I add red pepper flakes to the recipe, otherwise I make no changes, it is good without the tweaking.

The highlight of this recipe is its tasty, easy sauce. It requires few ingredients and was a breeze to "heat up" with some shakes of Tabasco sauce. I "cut the fat" by using only 1 Tblspoon of butter for a doubled recipe. Be sure to double the recipe for the sauce.

I followed the advice of several reviewers to cut back the amount of salt in the rub. By using onion and garlic powders, I was easily able to control the salt amount.

My beef cut was over 6 lbs, so the recommended baking time of an initial 6 hours was exactly right.

This recipe is a definite keeper. I will make it again.

I had never cooked a brisket before so was a little nervous......this recipe made it so easy!  I followed it to the letter and it really turned out great.  Made it for a family dinner and everyone raved.  I did double the sauce as previously suggested......made great leftovers as well.  I prepared both the sauce and brisket two days ahead....just warmed it in the oven when it came time to serve.  Thanks so much, I'll never be scared of preparing brisket again!

Awesome!!! I've made this a few times and my husband loves it. I serve the sauce on the side because my youngest son doesn't care for sauces. I like to add 1/2 tsp. of cayenne or chipotle powder. I found that cooking 4 lbs. for 4 1/2 hours turns out just perfect.

I grew up in Texas and Colorado and always loved the BBQ.  Moving to the east coast I discovered that everyone here eats Carolina BBQ. This recipe made me feel like I was home again.  I didn't put the sauce on it the last hour.  I just let everyone decide if and how much to put on.  This is truly one of the best recipes I have come across in years.

Wow. This was fantastic. My husband and I loved it. I used garlic & onion powders like other suggested. My piece of brisket was 3 lbs - I cooked it 3 hours, took out of the oven and let it cool for 30-45 min, sliced it and covered with sauce, and then baked for another 45 min. It was so tender and tasty. The BBQ sauce was wonderful and I made a little extra for dipping.

I cooked a four pound brisket using this rub. I used the slowcooker( 9 hours on low, turning once) and finished it off in the oven.  Rather than make my own sauce, I used Stubb's, a favorite of my friend from Texas.  It was great accompanied by a green salad, tater salad and texas toast. Take it easy on your day off, was my feeling.

I have made this twice now. The first time without the BBQ sauce which turned out wonderful, and the second with it and it was incredible. Marinated it in fridge overnight and took it to my daughters the next morning and put it in their slow cooker. She said her husband and son ate 3 sandwiches each. I will be stocking up on brisket since it's on sale right now because I can see this recipe being used over and over again.

We loved it.  I didn't add the BBQ sauce as we were having a house full of people, and we weren't sure if they all would want the BBQ sauce.  I served the sauce on he side, along with horseradish sauce and the natural juices from cooking it, and let everyone pick which way they wanted it.  It was tender and not salty at all. I will certainly make this again.

This was MY first time at making brisket. I had 10 people coming for dinner so I bought an 11 lb. brisket. I followed the recipe exactly plus took the advice of others to double to barbeque sauce.  This brisket was phenomenal!!! Fork tender, flavorful and juicy. Everyone raved about it and made comparisions to some of our favorite bbq places in town.  Try this recipe. IT wont disappoint you!!!

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!! This was a FABULOUS recipe I'm so glad I gave it a try. I doubled the BBQ sauce and it was perfect. I used the Crock Pot and cooked on high for about 5 hours trimmed off the fat then added the BBQ sauce and cooked on MED for another 3 1/2 hours then shredded up and cooked on low for an hour. Everyone LOVED this recipe I don't think I will ever use a store bought BBQ sauce again I LOVED the BBQ Sauce it was PERFECT! Thank you soo much!

I am from Ohio and married a man that was born and raised in Kansas City. I had never even heard of brisket and didn't have a clue how to make it for our first Christmas 7 years ago. I found this recipe and my hubby said it was the best brisket he has ever eaten and he has been eating it all his life. I had no prior brisket experience to compare it to, but I love it very much(especially the next day on a bun) It's been 7 years and about 20 briskets later but I use this recipe every time. I don't change anything except doubling the recipe to feed more.

Absolutely wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cut the liquid smoke down quite a bit, because I was afraid it would be a bit overpowering.  I am glad I did.    The last hour of cooking, my husband took over because I was away.  He put some baby carrots and peeled potatoes in with the sliced meat (after adding the bbq sauce).  They came out yummy and gave a good harty flavor to the beef.  I think we liked this recipe best because of the bbq sauce.  We are not big fans of bottled bbq sauce, and this was full of flavor without being so icky sweet.  Thanks sooooo much.  This is definately a keeper and a great one for company!

Great taste! Very moist with that smokey flavor. I cooked it in th oven at 300 for 3.5hr then took it out, slathered it with the sauce for another 1.5hrs...all the time wrapped in tin foil. the one thing i would change is reduce the "salt" spices. if you like your brisket a little on the salty side then keep it. i will use this again...

I have lived in Texas for almost 20 years, so I've had some incredible barbecued brisket, I've made a few good ones too, but this recipe is out of this world, and incredibly easy.  We absolutely loved it and this is the one I will use for my brisket from now on, thanks so much for posting it!!!!

Great recipe - It's a keeper.  Only thing I did differently was for the first part of cooking - used the crock pot on low for 8 hours then finished up in the oven when I got home from work.

I did not care for this at all, it had a vinegar taste (even though there is none in it) Maybe I did something wrong, I doubled the recipe and kept tasting it and ended up throwing it away. Living in Kansas City we have numerous kinds of BBQ sauce here, it is interesting how many differnet types of sauces there are depending on the region you live in. It depends on everyones different tastes, I guess Texas BBQ sauce is not for me. But according to the reviews lots of people did like it, thanks for the post anyway!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!!  The meat turns out so tender and delicious.  I double the sauce recipe.  My husband and I like to shred the brisket with a fork, put it in a warm tortilla shell with white rice and mexican blended cheese...add a little extra sauce and roll it up.  Everyone asks for seconds and thirds!  I just made an 8 pound brisket this weekend and it's already gone.  This is a MUST try recipe!  THANK YOU CATHY!

Excellent recipe. The brisket came out perfectly cooked and moist. The bbq sauce is not spicy enough to be Texas style, it's sweet like bbq from the midwest. Still a great recipe, and very easy.

This recipe is outstanding!!!!  I doubled the sauce as recommended and omitted the celery salt.  I made 2 briskets for 12 people and had plenty left over.  Several people requested the recipe and claimed it was the best brisket they ever had.  I wouldn't change a thing!!

Wow, this was good!  I baked it in my stoneware with a stoneware lid and the brisket was so tender that it was hard to cut. I made it twice within a week.  The second time however, I added more smoke flavor to the meat and sauce, and I also added a little more brown sugar to the sauce. This was so easy to make and the whole family loved it.  My mom said this is a whole lot better than my aunt's recipe, and she is known for her brisket.  I can't wait for my aunt to try this!

I made some adjustments to the sauce (accounting for taste) but it was really good just as written. The meat came out perfectly and the fat just rubbed right off, then I sliced it. I chose to reduce the sauce and serve this on sandwiches rather than put the slices in the sauce back in the oven. My favorite BBQ joint does it the way I did it, so that's why I chose that way. (Plus then I could use the sauce on my the leftover smoked pork bbq I brought out of the freezer.) I'll definitely use this recipe again -- thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I have made this many, many times.  I skip making the BBQ sauce and just use my favorite brand - sometimes I skip altogether.  I usually add a can of beef broth before cooking the brisket to make sure it stays juicy.

We loved it!  Of course with a couple of changes: did not marinate overnight (or at all!), Used a slow cooker instead of oven. and used onion & garlic powder instead of salt (as recommended by other reviewers.)  Cooked for 8 hours in slow cooker.  Made double the sauce (maybe could have used even more) and pulled the brisket apart (rather than slicing.)  Served on warm potato rolls with optional dill pickle slices.  OMGosh - excellent!

I made this in my crock pot - about 11 hours on low - and it was delicious.  When I took it out and sliced it up I snuck a taste and it was so good I decided to serve it as is and then everyone could add as much or as little sauce as they wanted.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.

Excellent!  Reduced salt by using garlic and onion powders (but added Tbs of kosher salt) and cooked in slow cooker.  For sandwiches, we put a layer of avocado slices and it was absolutely delicious!!  Somehow the avocado and barbecue flavor go really well together.

Totally easy and awesome! Buy a good cut of brisket from your butcher for the best result. I didn't have onion salt, so I substituted onion powder. I wrapped in foil, marinated overnight, and cooked it in the foil. I added a little more sugar to the sauce and more pepper. Yum!!!

This is the most fantastic recipe!  I discovered it a few years ago and it has become a favorite.  I make it often -- exactly as written and it can't be beat!  I take it to potlucks and it is the first dish that disappears and I always get requests for the recipe.  I grew up in Texas and this is like the barbecue I grew up with.  Easy and incredibly delicious!

The sauce was great, not too sweet.

I changed the brisket recipe just slightly.  I didn't use liquid smoke, substituted onion powder and garlic powder for the salts, and put on about a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.
I roasted, covered for four hours at 275 then uncovered for two more.  Let the brisket rest for half an hour then sliced and served.

It came out beautifully.  Thank you!

I had some left over homemade bbq sauce to use up so I'm rating this on the cooking method only.  This turned out really great for me.  I cut a 5 lb. brisket (from Costco) in half and froze the other half.  I was feeding 5 people and this was enough for us.  I scaled the liquid smoke and seasonings in half.  My house smelled incredible while I cooked it for about 3 1/2 hours.  At this point it was ready to slice.  It's important to slice brisket against the grain to insure you get a nice tender slice.  I placed the slices back into the pan juices and spread my homemade sauce over and baked for about another 30 minutes.  Perfect on it's own with mashed potatoes or served on sandwich rolls with cole slaw or potato salad.  Yum!

Man, was this awesome.  The only thing I did differently was cook the brisket in the slow cooker.  When I made the sauce, I added to the juices in the crock pot and soaked the meat in the sauce for about an hour.  However, I didn't change any of the ingredients-great recipe :)

I have had my share of great brisket as I lived in Tx. for 3 years. I had not made it since living there which was 23 years ago. Very easy to make. I made the bbq sauce in this recipe but did not care for it so I used the Original KC Masterpiece bbq. sauce instead, it was absolutely wonderful! Lots of "ooohs" & "Ahhhs" from the family! Great Recipe, Thanks!

We are from Minnesota and had NEVER had brisket.  We had all wanted to try it so I made the leap on the 4th with this one.  It smelled soooooo good cooking.  I had a hard time slicing it so I shredded it instead.  While shredding everyone kept coming up and picking at it, yum was all they would say.  Then I poured on that ever so wonderful sauce and baked it longer...double yum.  I think I will start making this sauce from now on.  It was very good, I was asked for the recipe several times.  Did I say yum?  YUM!

Great brisket recipe.  I baked for 5 hours and added about 1/2 cup water the last hour to keep from burning on the bottom (before adding sauce and baking for another hour).

Absolutely wonderful!
I had a 2 pound brisket, so I cooked it for 2.5 hours, let it rest and then cut. It fell apart so I ended up shredding. Then added sauce. No need to cook again.

Twice I have made this for family and friends and I have received nothing but rave reviews over this recipe!!  It's tender and absolutely fills the house with the wonderful taste of BBQ! As far as some of the local BBQ joints, I'd rather eat this version of brisket sandwiches than theirs!  Will make again and again!

Meat basically fell apart and ended up looking shredded.  Maybe the 6-7 total hours of cooking time was too long(?)  But the sauce was yummy and the meat made great sandwiches.

Delicious!  My husband, who doesn't even like BBQ, said this was excellent.  I only baked for 4 1/2 hours, plus 45 min with the sauce and it was perfect.  Doubled the sauce as others recommended and there was just enough.

So "smoky sweet" flavorful, just like BBQ should taste!  This has become such a family and friends favorite that you can never go wrong!  It's perfect for the outdoor BBQ as well as Superbowl Sundays.  Add creamy coleslaw as a side dish or as a sandwich topping for the perfect accompaniment. Enjoy!

This is so good! I have always stayed away from cooking brisket. I was told how tough it could be if not made right. Well, this is so easy to do, and it turned out very tender. I did double the sauce, but omited the butter. I will be making it again for our Forth of July celebration! YUMMY!!

I tried the recipe because I was "dying" for some good brisket.  I used to live in the South (while in the military) and was married at one time to a guy from Oklahoma (where they LOVE their brisket).  My ex had an EXCELLENT brisket recipe in a cookbook that belonged to him, so I didn't take it when we got divorced.  I've been trying to duplicate it ever since.  I thought this recipe sounded fairly close and would give it a try.  There isn't enough seasoning in the recipe (and I even increased the liquid smoke to the full 4T recommended and increased the seasonings.)  I added some hickory barbecue sauce, seasoned salt & hot sauce in an attempt to jazz it up.  I must say that the meat was very tender, though.  Thanks anyway!

I was looking for something easy that I could serve when entertaining a large number of people.  I didn't want to be in the kitchen during the entire party, but I wanted something with lots of flavor.  This recipe was perfect.  I did double the sauce, but ended up using only half of it during cooking, so I put the other half in a serving bowl on the table for those who like extra.  Everybody raved about this--I especially like the leftovers (if you're lucky) on buns with coleslaw.  Tender and tasty.

WOW!!!! Fantastic, y'all should try this one! I used garlic and onion powders, salt and liquid smoke. My brisket was nearly ten pounds, so I started it at 5:30 a.m.  I was worried when I woke at nine because the cnt of the liquid smoke was overpowerin; I was worried I had ruined it. When I did eventually take it out of theboven, I had a fantastically tender, good-flavored brisket. I opted not to bake it a second time with the bbq sauce, rather I served it along side. I recommend this highly!

The liquid smoke flavor was... disconcerting. My wife made me take the leftovers in my lunch for a week. Each day I put it in the fridge with a "please do not eat" sign and it was gone by noon. These people give new meaning to the phrase "cow-orkers."

Came out a bit too salty for us (had to add a bit of extra brown sugar to compensate) - next time I will use garlic and onion powders for the meat rub, not  salts. I made one and a half times the amount of bbq sauce because we like it juicy/sloppy. Omitted the celery salt since I didn't have any.  Used a 4 pound chuck (not brisket) and made it in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours.

WOWWWW! really good and tender! I wrapped mine in foil, baked for 5 hrs. Then took out, shredded and poured my own recipe BBQ sauce over it. Wrapped up again in foil and baked for another 40 mins. SO good. Be sure to watch the last hour w/BBQ sauce on, so it doesn't dry out! I toasted rolls with butter and a bit of garlic salt and topped with the meat..yum!

I'm not a red meat girl.  The brisket volunteers for our block party had to back out.  So, I chose this recipe.  I agree with another reviewer that said it was good without adding the sauce and cooking an additional hour.  Cooked the 11 pound brisket at 300 for 6 hours.  I trimmed off the fat and sliced it and put some sauce over it anyway (with some on the side for dipping).  It's perfectly done right now, so I'm hoping the sauce will only enhance it.  I was a bit worried about all the salt, but it's not too salty - just right.  I just double the sauce recipe (tripled the wet/dry marinade).  I've got a lot of "au jus".  So I'm off to find a way to use it, too.  This is my first brisket.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll let you know if my Texas friends approve.  UPDATE:  Didn't use the au jus, just the ketchup-y sauce of this recipe.  Not a speck left over and got a high compliment from a neighbor saying it tasted like "Dickey's BBQ" - a local chain.

I made this in the crockpot, but followed the directions otherwise. I think I would double the sauce recipe next time, since we like extra sauce to dip our sandwiches in. The flavor was great, though!

GREAT!  I have made this several times now and it is always so delicious!  I also use the BBQ sauce recipe anytime I need BBQ sauce...it is so flavorful and I always get tons of compliments on it.
Simple ingredients, simple recipe.  All it takes is time, which is sometimes torture when you are smelling the brisket in the oven all day!!

I made this for Sunday dinner when the kids and spouses come for dinner.  Like a previous review, they ate it and didn't say anything.  The sauce wasn't anything to write home about.  However, it was my first time cooking a brisket and the cooking method was great: tender and flavorful.  I halved the onion salt and made up the difference with Pappy's seasoning.  My husband loved the taste before the sauce.  After letting it cool about half an hour he cut thick slices with and electric knife and didn't have any problems.  I will try it again with a different sauce or maybe even gravy.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It's very very good however when I went to slice the meat it just fell apart in shreds, is that how it's supposed to be or did I bake it too long? Fortunately I used it for sandwiches on garlic buttered french rolls so the pieces worked out fine and everyone loved it.

DELICIOUS! I've made this several times.  I think it's better if you remove the pan
drippings before adding the bbq sauce. I know that doesn't sound right, you'd think the
drippings give more flavour, but with the drippings the sauce is too thin and not as intense flavoured.

Wow!  My family loved this!  My husband and 14 year old son gave this recipe 2 thumbs up.  Since we only have 3 people at home I cut it the 4 pound brisket in half (lengthwise) and put the other half in the freezer. I used garlic and onion powder instead of salts to rub the meat.  I did not cut the barb-b-q recipe in half.  My family is asking me to make the other half really soon!

I initially thought the brisket would be too salty after seeing the list of salts required in the recipe.  Not true.  The brisket was very flavorful, with just the right amount of tang. The meat was also extremely tender.  In fact, it fell apart as I placed it on our dinner plates.  I'll be making this again soon.

I have tried many brisket recipes and this is the only one I will ever make again.  It is perfect. My kids, who don't normally like beef, ate this up without hesitation.  It will become a regular at our house.

This was a big hit.  I made an 8lb brisket in my 51/2 qt Crockpot and quadrupled the sauce recipe.  I took the leftovers to work the next day and served it on french rolls with watermelon cups.  True barbecue flavor without the hassle!  Everyone raved!

This was my first attempt at a brisket.  It is good but didn't knock my socks off.  It definitely becomes more tender the longer you let it simmer in the sauce.  Be sure to double the sauce.

I have made prepared this recipe for guests several times, and it is always a big hit.
I would recommend doubling the sauce and decreasing cooking time by 1 hour.  It is also really great with out the sauce.  You may consider just serving it on the side, or half on the side.   Great Recipe!!!

I used this recipe for the 4th of July picnic. I doubled the BBQ sauce and I couldn't believe it. There wasn't any left. But we sure did have leftover hotdogs and brats. This is the best BBQ I've had in a long time.

I tried this recipe twice. The first time I made it according to the recipe the second time I changed a few things. Before I slow cooked the brisket I cooked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes to brown it. Then I doused it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, pepper and seasoning salt and wrapped it in tin foil. I cooked mine at 225 degrees for about 8 hours then chilled it. I made the sauce using enough juices and water to make 2 cups of liquid, 1 cup ketchup, 1/3 Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. Brought it to a boil then poured over the sliced brisket. Cooking the brisket at a lower temperature wrapped in tin foil made it VERY tender..it just fell apart.

I put the brisket in my crock pot on high for 6 hours.  Very moist.  Because I ran out of time, I ended up shredding the meat and using good ole Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce.  Next time, I will plan better and try the sauce everyone is raving about!!!

I made a 14lb brisket and cooked it for about 8 hours and it was falling apart when we cut it. It was delicious, and the bbq sauce was a great hit too. Thanks for sharing!

This is a must have recipe.  I actually use the rub amounts and cooking time as suggested by reviewer LIZALOUISE and absolutely love this brisket.  It's become a popular request from my family.  I am totally not a BBQ sauce fan but this sauce is perfect.  I almost cant make enough for my family.  I have no need to look further for a brisket recipe.

This is an excellent recipe for brisket. I usually have a 3 pound brisket - so I cook it for about 3-4 hours and it is perfect. Keep it covered and let it rest for at least 30 minutes after taking it out of the oven. 
I prefer this brisket without any bbq sauce. It really doesn't need it. Delish!!

Very good! I did mine in the crock pot, sliced it and put the sauce on the side. Also, I only used half the amount of liquid smoke called for, and it was perfect.

A very good basic sauce recipe.  I used crushed celery seed since I didnt have the celery salt.  There are so many options to make this sauce into what you want.  My wife loved it and its much easier to make then my own private sauce.

Worth the try.

Holy smokes this is fantastic!!!  I doubled the sauce (as suggested by other reviewers) and added a couple tablespoons more of brown sugar and a few splashes of tabasco.  I cooked it overnight in the slow cooker on low for about 10 hours, (discarded all liquid extracted from the meat) and then for the last 2 hours I added the bbq sauce mixture.  Before serving I shredded it with two forks and served on a bun.  This was to die for, will def be a staple in my house!  This is truly set it and forget it!!

I have made this numerous times for guests and it is always a hit.  I use garlic and onion powder, not salt.  I shred leftover beef with additional sauce for the best BBQ beef sandwiches ever.  I serve the sandwiches every year at our Super Bowl party and it is everyone's favorite.

Our house smelled so delicious as this was cooking!  The recipe was not clear as to whether to remove the aluminum foil wrapping before placing in the roaster and cooking, so I left it on and am glad I did (the exposed ends were a bit dried out as opposed to the part wrapped in foil).  I just added our favorite bottled sauce after slicing and heated briefly in the microwave since some previous reviewers mentioned it got dried out in the last cooking step. I did let the meat rest (wrapped in foil) for about 20-30 min. before slicing, to let it re-absorb the juices.  When I have more time available, I may try the sauce recipe here.  The meat itself had a great flavor from the liquid smoke and the dry rub!

i've been making this recipe for a couple years now. only i use a SLOW COOKER. one hour high then 5-6 hours low, til tender. never needed to marinate overnight to get the great marinated flavor. usually makes about a cup or so of its own broth which i add to the sauce. per family demand, i double the sauce, subtracting the 1/4 cup water (as i add the broth instead.) tomorrow's leftovers are texas-style baked potatoes slathered with the shredded brisket/sauce, butter, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. my family can't get enough!! i must make some soon

Yummy! This was so good. I used extra liquid smoke to overnight with garlic powder and onion powder, not salt. Cooked all day on low in the slow cooker, drained the liquid, sliced the meat, and added the sauce for an hour and it was fantastic. I will make the sauce again next week for pulled pork, I am sure it will be FAB!

I was just thinking that I hadn't made brisket in eons and was going to hunt down my old worn newspaper recipe. This came up on the Allrecipes "daily recipes" and it's the one! Brisket is a funny piece of meat, fairly expensive, but really a tough and stringy cut. Very flavorful meat due to its fatty striations though. You have to treat it low and slow. But when done right, like this recipe, (yes you have to let it sit overnight and bake it 7 hours or so!) it is well worth the trouble. Melts in your mouth. Liquid smoke is the secret ingredient though! I do like brisket for a change because you can actually slice it unlike pot roast that just falls apart in chunks. Thanks I'll be using this one from now on.

Fabulous brisket and turns out better looking than the picture.  The brisket is perfect without pouring the sauce on and cooking for another hour.  The barbecue sauce however is excellent! I decrease the amount of liquid smoke in the sauce and only add a dash.  Otherwise it seems to over power. We use the sauce to top with after serving.              Everyone has raved about this when i have prepared it.

Wow!  This was so tender!  I loved the sweetness of the BBQ sauce over top of the brisket.  I omitted the celery salt because I didn't have any, but it was delicious!  I wanted my husband and I to try it first so i cut the recipe in half, so I cut the cooking time in half as well.  I would recommend this to ANYONE!

I Love This Recipe! This is the first time I ever made a brisket & it was so easy! I really like the sauce. The only change I made was to omitt the liquid smoke. My family does'nt like the taste.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I'm a Texan misplaced in Virginia and every time I make this brisket, I'm taken on a trip back home!  This is an awesome main dish if you have to feed several people.  I've NEVER had anyone complain, and definitely never have any leftovers.  ENJOY!!!

Very good and I am someone who is not usually nuts about barbeque. Next time, however, I will buy a bigger cut of meat or cook for a shorter time. I cooked my 4 lb. brisket for 5 hours and it was VERY well done. Sauce was very yummy.

I didn't have a Brisket so I used a Pork roast I had on hand. Its was two pounds so I cooked it for appoximately 3-1/2 hrs. Followed the rest of the recipe,and made the sauce. I did use the amount of sauce as indicated in the recipe for the 4lb. Brisket. (We personally like a good amount of sauce.) Based on this when I make this again I will always double the sauce. The sauce was really great!! Very tasty!!!!! This one is a definte keeper!!!!

My family really enjoys eating this brisket, especially my picky eater, who request this recipe every time she home from college.  She really likes the sauce.  I put the sauce on my warming zone, after letting it come to a boil and let it cook until the brisket is ready, makes it nice and thick and sticks to the brisket better too!

I have made this recipe 3 times now and it has pleased every time. Quick, easy, and beats tending to a smoker all day. The only change I have made is not marinating the meat overnight. 1-2 hours is time enough to give the meat that smoky flavor that brisket needs. Kudos to Cathy for sharing but the Hill Country is where BBQ is best in Texas, LOL.

My husband, who is from West Texas, thinks longingly of home when I make this.  I make the brisket in the crockpot (on low, all day long) and I halved the liquid smoke in the sauce recipe.  You have to make the sauce! It's the best BBQ sauce I have ever had.  My family will no longer eat the bottled sauce.  I've spoiled them all!

This came out really good! I used garlic and onion powders instead of the salt versions like other reviewers recommended to cut back on the sodium levels and doubled the sauce amount. I rubbed the marinade on it the night before, cooked it the next day and refridgerated it overnight for easier slicing(It was so tender I was afraid that if I sliced it while the meat was still too warm it would shred instead of slice). I then poured the BBQ sauce over the slices and reheated it at 350 degrees for approx. 45 min. Very tender and delicious!

I can't believe how good this recipe it.  I followed the directions exactly.  It was absolutely delicious.  I'm thinking of making it again tomorrow!  The first one just disappeared too fast.  I will definitely make it next time I have company over.  Thanks so much Cathy for sharing this great recipe with all of us!

I followed instructions completely. My husband said it was great! I accidentally let it overcook after slicing it and putting it back in the oven. You must not let it go over the 1 hour...next time I will turn the oven down from 300 to maybe 200, or only cook it for 30 minutes instead of an hour. Great flavor and good leftovers!

My first brisket, and certainly not my last.  I just made this for a Christmas Party tonight and I am tempted to leave it at home for later eating.  It's delicious.  I followed the recipe, cooked for about 5 hours 15 minutes.  So tender when you slice it the meat falls apart.  I, too, doubled the sauce recipe and was liberal with the liquid smoke.  A real keeper in my kitchen repertiore.

I made this for a big family get together.  There wasn't much left on the plate after my crew dug in.  Got alot of complements on how tender the meat was.  I cut the temperature back to about 275 and cooked the meat for about 8-10 hours.  I will be making this again.  This is probably one of the best brisket recipes I have ever tried

I have been looking for the perfect "fork tender" brisket recipe and this is it. I was hesitate to serve this to teenage girls - they loved it and I ran out.  This will become one of my family's favorite.

The liquid smoke flavoring adds so much, don't leave it out.

This was very good, however after applying the sauce and putting the sliced meat back in the oven it became so tender that the slices just fell apart and it ended up being more like chopped beef.  Next time I will reduce the cooking time just a little before slicing.  The sauce was very tasty and well liked by the whole family.

I have been longing for Texas BBQ since we moved from Austin and this recipe fits the bill really well.  
I did change the onion and garlic to powder instead of salt and added salt separately. But no others changes.  This is a very tasty BBQ.

Absolutely outstanding!  I don't much care for brisket, but hubby insisted on making it for a party.  It was such a hit-- even I really liked it.  By far the best brisket I've ever had.

Good taste overall but be careful not to overcook the meat like I did.  A 4.5 lb brisket in the oven at 300 degrees  covered for 5 hours was too long!  The outside of the brisket got burnt and hard.  Next time I will either cut back an hour or so on the cook time or put it in the crockpot like so many others did.  However the taste of the sauce was very yummy and the tender portions of the brisket were good.

I made this for my daughter's high school graduation party.  I just doubled everything because I had a lot of people.  It was perfect!  Not your typical barbecue up here in MA.  Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was delicious & easy for a girl making her first brisket!  Followed recipe as written, but the only brisket available to me was 2.73#.  I adjusted the cook time, but I still think it cooked too long.  I'll get em next time!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for switching onion salt and garlic salt for onion powder and garlic powder; however, I think it would have been just fine with the salt.  I only baked for 4 hours before letting it rest for 45 minutes.  I then cooked it for another hour in the sauce.  Came out perfect!  I think it would have been too dry if I would have baked 5 hours before the sauce.  I doubled the sauce as others have suggested but we would have been ok without doubling it.  My family loved this recipe!!  The sauce was truly delicious!  Can definitely taste the celery salt.  By the way, this was my first brisket!

WOW!!!! So easy, so delicious. Followed direx exactly. Only difference is that I added a clove of garlic to the sauce. I also put a little beer and beef broth in the pan after the first 2 hours. I made two 2.5 pound briskets, put them in a pan, and covered tightly with foil. About three hours total.

This was fabulous! Served it at a get together, and someone asked my husband if we'd had it catered. Only had an hour to let the meat sit with the rub, so I can only imagine how fantastic it would taste if it sat overnight as the recipe calls for.

Before a couple of weeks ago I had never cooked a brisket.  Then I found myself needing to cook brisket for 150 people. I read the reviews and gave this recipe a trial run and all I can say is WOW! I read some reviews that said to cook it in a turkey roasting bag which was a great idea and made clean up super easy!  But the BBQ sauce was the big winner!  Rave reviews!  My husband really just would rather me make the sauce from now on rather buy in a bottle!  Great recipe all the way around!

I cooked my 3 1/2 lb brisket on low in the crock pot for about 10 hours, then sliced the meat and added the BBQ Sauce ingredients (followed exact measurements). I continued cooking it on low for another few hours then served it on whole wheat soft rolls.  It was delicious!  The meat was moist and falling apart.  It was a tad salty, but the roll helped.  Next time I think I might rub Onion & Garlic Powder on the brisket, instead of the Salt to see how that turns out.  Also, my toddler's didn't care for it.  I think I'll save a couple slices for them prior to adding the sauce and see what that think.

This is a great recipe. Meat is very tender and sauce is tasty. I am wondering though if you are supposed to remove the pan juices before adding the barbecue sauce and baking for another hour. I have been taking the pan juices and degreasing and returning to the pan which makes the barbecue sauce tasty but a little thin.

So, so good!  I used onion and garlic powder instead of salt and it still tasted great.  We're going low carb, so for the sauce I used low carb ketchup and Splenda brown sugar and tasted amazing.  Thanks for the recipe -- so much easier than cranking up the smoker!

This was delicious! I cooked my brisket in the crock pot on low for about 10 hours and it was so tender it just fell apart. I thought the BBQ sauce was the best ever! I just couldn't get over how good the sauce turned out and it was so easy to make.I will definately make this again soon and I'll be using this BBQ sauce recipe the next time I make chicken.

I love cooking things my family loves, and this is one of those things. I bought a huge brisket that was discounted due to Easter over abundance. I thought I'd give it a try. This recipe was perfect. I doubled it and added a Tablespoon of molasses. It was a hit.

Wonderful!!  Made this for a family picnic and everyone loved it!  As one of my guest said "It just melts in your mouth".  It was so tender and the smokey BBQ flavor was spot on.  I ran out of mustard powder so, I substituted prepared Dijon.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.    Will definately make again.

I rarely, if ever make a brisket. But this one is full proof. I didn't have liquid smoke so used smoke salt and then garlic and onion "powder." Still tasted great. This is a total winner

Oh my, this was the best BBQ beef ever!!!! Better than restaurant. I didn't measure, just eyeballed and it turned out excellent. I will definitely make again with two,  so next time there's leftovers for garlic bread sandwiches or one plain for use in chili or something. Oh this is heaven. I'm in love with this meat.

Awesome recipe.  I started using this recipe a few years ago and now everyone who eats it, is now using it.   I am especially a big fan of the barbeque sauce.  I go a little light on the liquid smoke, as it can be overpowering.  I do not add the liquid smoke to the marinade when my husband cooks this in his smoker, because it gets that flavor from the smoker instead.  Definately try this, you won't be sorry!!

Fabulous!!! The hubby loved this and wants to make sure we add it to the recipe rotation. Added a few more items to the original rub (added paprika) and the sauce (minced garlic and chili powder). Discovered at the last minute that I didn't have any brown sugar or celery salt. So I substituted the brown sugar with molasses, honey, and granulated sugar. After five hours in the oven at 275, I scraped off the layer of fat then attempted to slice it. It was so tender that it became shredded brisket. It's OK cause it was still great. I had a small brisket so maybe that's why it was fully cooked at this point. Then I added the sauce and let it cook for 20 more minutes- mainly to give the meat time to absorb the sauce.

I have been a vegetarian for 13 years and have never cooked meat in my life. We had a bbq so I decided to make this so I could put it in the oven and not worry about it. I did try the bbq sauce and it was the best I ever had. And when the brisket was done people said it was the best brisket they ever had. People said I should bottle the sauce and the brisket was gone in minutes. I made a 10 pound roast and cooked it for 6 hours then added the sauce without cutting it. I took the foil off the last 30 minutes of cooking. People are demanding this is made every bbq and as easy as it was to make, I think they'll get thier wish!

Great!   I had a big piece of brisket, so I cut in in three long, 2" wide strips, along the grain.  I marinated overnight per recipe, then dropped the strips in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  Before adding the sauce, I drained the slow cooker, scraped off the fat, then cut against the grain.  I multiplied the sauce by 1 and 1/2.  (2 times was a little too saucy, 1 time was not quite enough).

I made some modifications (out of pure laziness on my part), but this was still a huge hit.  First, I used onion & garlic powder instead of onion/garlic salt, and just added a little bit of table salt.  I didn't marinate ahead of time, but threw the brisket in the slow cooker on low for about 10 hours.  (I had a bigger crock pot and a smaller brisket, so I had to add a little water, too.)  About an hour before serving, I shredded the meat, dumped a bottle of "Lip Lickin'" Barbeque sauce (something I found in the grocery - one of the few without corn syrup) into the mix and threw it back into the crock pot to heat.  Served it on rolls and everyone raved!

i made this brisket for a bunch of grown men - and it got rave reviews!  i will be making this again and again.  i was a little worried that the "sauce" was going to be too "ketcupy"...but after cooking it with that brisket an hr..it wasn't AT ALL!  mm...it was delicious!  and went just perfectly with my side of mac-n-cheese from this site and salad and baked potatos!

AMAZING BBQ sauce!! I made this recipe tonight and everyone loved it! But the meat was too salty, so next time we will use garlic powder and onion powder. I wasn't sure if I was to pour off the juice before adding the BBQ sauce so I left some of it in and removed most of it. This was good but still a little runny. I also added 1/2 t. fresh ground pepper to each the meat and sauce. We like more spice so this was perfect for us. This is a new favorite!

First time making brisket and it turned out fabulous!! I added some kick to the sauce with red pepper chilli flakes and I marinated the meat two nights, and used onion/garlic powder, not salts, so I could control it. I put in at 275 degrees for four hours (used a 5 lb. roast) and then the last hour I did not slice or pour sauce over (we like to dip it) and it browned beautifully!! Whole family loved it! Thanks for such a easy and delicious recipe!! Oh and I also waited 25 minutes before I siced it and it held up perfect!!

NEVER have I had a brisket turn out so tender!!!  This was so very yummy.  My entire family loved this.  I made the sauce as well, I did not pour it over the brisket because I wanted to use some left over brisket for salads, great with ranch dressing.  Thanks so much for the recipe

This was absolutely the BEST brisket I have ever had that wasn't bought from a restaurant!  I had so many compliments on it.  I made an extra batch of bbq sauce to serve on the side also!  I loved cutting it and then cooking it for another hour, because when everyone came over all I had to do was take it out of the oven and serve:)

I used a smaller brisket and ,therefore, cooked it for less time.  I used my own sauce but otherwise followed the recipe.  The meat turned out moist and flavorful.  Thanks!

This was WONDERFUL!!  I out-cooked my mother-in-law, for once!  I didn't marinate it overnight, I prepared same as directed except cooked immediately.  I also did not cut up the brisket, I poured the sauce over  and cooked the additional hour.  It was fantastic, best I've ever tasted.  Can't wait to cook again.  Thanks!!!

This is a definate family favorite at out house!  I've made it 5 or 6 times for family events, dinner parties, or summer get-togethers.  Kids love it and adults fo nuts over it.  On rare occasions when there are leftovers, it's great reheated or even cold on a sandwich.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe was a big hit at our house.  I used a 5# brisket and cooked 5 hours to tender, juicy perfection.  After 5 hours, I let the meat cool a bit before slicing and saucing.  I was not a big fan of the ketchupy sauce (just personal preference), but DH loved it.  I left half the meat unsauced and it was delicious!  The kids ate it plain and I used my favorite bottled brand.  I never thought I could make brisket as good as can be purchased in a restaurant, but now I can!  As a side note--I was scared of the liquid smoke, but it turned out to be delicious in this marinade.

I used a 2.5 lb “tri-tip” and cooked at 300 for 2.5 hrs and but still made the entire BBQ sauce recipe.  For the final step, I baked at 300 for about 20 min just to warm it up (my meat was fully cooked after the first bake) 

If making a 4 lb. brisket, I’d double the sauce – but we love sauce! 

I sliced against the grain and my meat didn't crumble like other reviewers talked about.  But, it has happened with other briskets I've made and it doesn't really matter b/c hopefully you are cutting into bite size pieces before eating it! 

This is such a good recipe - so easy and so tasty.  Believe the reviews, it's a solid recipe.

I made the sauce only and it was terrific. Followed the recipe to the letter only I didn’t measure anything, just eyeballed it. We put this sauce on pork ribs and the result was great.

This was good. It smells amazing while it cooks. The BBQ sauce was really good, but I had to double the recipe because it wouldn't have been enough. This tasted almost exactly like the BBQ brisket at a certian popular BBQ resturaunt in San Antonio, TX I used to frequent.. But I don't live there anymore! Excellent with homeade baked beans!

This is so easy and tender!  The flavor was really great.  I found that I liked the sauce a bit sweeter so I added more brown sugar, but it is really easy to customize the sauce to your liking.  I will definitely be making this again in the winter when I seem to miss bbq the most.  Also, since I'm a stay at home mom and my husband works, this is pretty cheap to make and entertain with as well.  I would highly recommend anyone trying this recipe.

I knew that this recipe was good even before I tasted it!  When I took it out of the oven the first time to slice it, it fell apart because it was soooo tender.  I just left it whole and put the sauce over all of it.  I also saved sauce on the side for anyone who wanted more.  This was a great brisket and I will make it again and again!

I made this for the in-laws and now they can't stop talking about what a good cook I am.  The brisket turns out very tender.  The BBQ sauce is delicious - the best I have ever tried.  I use the sauce recipe in all of my BBQ cooking now.  You really should try this!!!

Used a 2 1/2# London broil, 1/2 recipe of rub (overnight) and full recipe of sauce, baked 2 1/4 hours at 300F.  Meat was kind of dry, too lean I think, but the sauce is excellent and saved the day.

Excellent!!  To anwer Millie's question (which I questioned as well), I didn't have any foil so I wrapped it in plastic wrap.  Therefore, I did remove it before placing it in the roasting pan.  But I too wonder if the foil should be used for baking purposes as well.  After cooking it for 6 hours, the tips of the meat were very dark and slightly hard but nonetheless it was still very, very good.  I wonder if that could have been avoided by baking it in the foil.  The meat didn't really slice either - it just fell apart, which is fine.  My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that it's a tad too salty.  I would use a little less garlic/onion salt next time.  And I agree about doubling the sauce - half to use for dipping.  Thanks Cathy!

This is the best brisket I've ever made, and everyone that came to dinner commented on how good it was. The only change I made was decreasing the cooking time. I cook the meat 4 hrs then another 1.5 with the sauce. This recipe is a keeper.Thanks Cathy!

WOW!!!! This is incredible!  My husband and I both agreed that it tastes like true TX bbq.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I do have to say I was a bit worried about all the liquid smoke, BUT it does not overpower the brisket at all and I think you could use more to suit your own tastes.

The meat itself is great with the rub..I think I should have put a little more kick in the sauce, but the kids and hubby love it! Great recipe!

This was the first time I have ever cooked a brisket and after making it for my husband and family for Father's Day, he said it was his new favorite dish of all time! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out delicious! Thank you! I will use this recipe over and over again!

I have never ever ever been able to cook beef....but this one worked for me! The beef was tender and my husband loved it(me too!). Just don't cook it for 6 hours if you start with a smaller cut.

The overnight prep worked well, but I also added a dry rub and 1/4 cup yellow mustard to the meat.  The sauce was good, but, let the meat rest about 10 min before you slice it to avoid much of the juice to run. After that I just put it under the broiler and "carmelized" the sauce for about 5 min.

I made this sauce tonight and it was excellent. I had already cooked my brisket before finding this so I just made the sauce on top of the stove and served it with my brisket. It was not to sweet just sweet enough to please my husband. I added hot sauce to mine ( only ) because I like it spicier than my husband does. Definitely a sauce I will make again and be pleased to serve to family and other guests!

I made this just last night and put it in the oven when I went to bed. The awesome smell kept waking me up! This morning I sliced it, although it was tender enough to just break apart. The BBQ sauce is sooooo wonderful, and Im 100% sure my family is going to think this is one of the best dishes I've ever made!! I thank you!!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE.  One of the best briskets I've ever had.  I made it yesterday for company and everyone (including picky husband) loved it.  To add a little zest to the sauce, I added some crushed red pepper.  This is officially my brisket recipe from now on.  I will definitely double the sauce recipe, as previous reviews suggested.  Thanks for sharing, Cathy G.!!!

This was the first time I have tried making brisket and it turned out great.  Very moist!  I cooked a 3 1/2 lb. brisket at 275 degrees for 4 hours.  Will definitely make again.

This disappeared fast at our SB party.  We had to make a few changes though.  Had no liq. smoke, so we marinated it in olive oil, chopped onion, wine and balsalmic vinegar, and fresh rosemary.  Cooked for 6 hrs, saved 2c of the fat drippings and made an awesome sauce/gravy with added brown mustard, hot sauce, minced garlic, and cornstarch.  We made 10# and all was eaten.  Our first time at brisket, and will do again!

We love brisket, and this was wonderful!!  We actually cooked it in the crockpot and the only other thing is that I didn't add the liquid smoke before letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  The barbecue sauce is excellent and we ate every single bite of this brisket!!

This recipe is so yummy! I marinated mine overnight in a soy marinade (Moore's) until I could get to the store to get the liquid smoke in the morning. I then added the liquid smoke, marinated for more hours and put it in the oven. My husband's friend just asked for the recipe because he said I've outdone myself this time. Try it!

This recipe was divine!!  I don't even like BBQ
but this brisket was excellent.  No leftovers and 
I actually got complaints about not having any more.  Even my picky husband was scarfing it down.  I will make this recipe again and probably have to double it so everyone gets their fair share.  Thanx!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not be afraid to try this recipe.  I had never cooked a brisket before, and did not follow the recipe very closely and it still came out great!  My family enjoyed it so much that they want me to cook it again this weekend.

I would stay with 5 hours of cooking. Next time I'll double the amount of barbeque sauce that is poured over the brisket for the final hour. It was too dry but very tasty.

All my friends rave over this one, Everyone wants to know how I made it so tender. I was invited to a July 4th party and used a store bought pre-cooked brisket with the sauce which had been jazzed up with half a cup of Jack Daniels and a dash of red pepper flakes.

This brisket is awesome.  My husband uses a little more brown sugar and doubled the sauce.  This is awesome.  And great the next day for sandwiches!

Family and friends demanded this recipe.  It is SO good. I used celery salt but changed the garlic salt to garlic powder and used half the amount.  I also doubled the sauce because it's so tangy and delicious everyone wanted lots of sauce.

barbeque sauce is really good--you can adjust the tanginess and sweetness to your preference.  however, i usually make an 8-10 lb brisket when i cook and i find that i need to triple the sauce amount to have enough.

Found this recipe years ago in a San Antonio cook book. Made many times. The barbecue sauce is great with it as well. I don’t put it in the sliced beef but put it Bowl as a side. Let your beef set out so juices get back in meat before slicing.

I did 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup chili sauce.   Family loved it.  I would even serve this for guests.  Everything can be done ahead of time.  Just the final hour in oven while guests arrive.

I made this recipe about a month ago and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly except i didn't put it back in the oven with the sauce. It turned out so moist and delicious. I did make the sauce but my family preferred it without it. I am making it again tonight. Thanks for such an amazing recipe

This was my first time making brisket, so I was a bit nervous.. but it came out amazing!!! I had a 7.5lb brisket, which I cooked at 250 for an hour a pound. My guests gobbled it all up--I wanted a second helping, but there was not a scrap left of it! Like other reviewers, I doubled the BBQ sauce and served it on the side. Seriously soooo good!!! I am totally making this again

We were skeptical the combination of ketchup and mustard was more reminiscent of a ball park frank than a savory brisket. We went ahead and tried it, and it was fantastic! We made it again for the whole family at Christmas!

This is my go to recipe when I want to have sliced brisket instead of shredded beef.  The trick is to let it cool for at least an hour if not more before you try to slice it.  I do not bother putting it back into the oven with the BBQ sauce, I think it would fall apart.  Maybe if I made this a day ahead I would do the last step, but this is great.

This is really a great recipe.  The meat is so tender. I followed the recipe exactly,  although I did cook it a little longer than written. The BBQ sauce is excellent and I will be using it often, on more than just brisket.
Try this recipe, you'll love it

Made this recipe today along with baked beans, corn on the cob, and coleslaw. I did not think about it until after the meat was done to cook it fatty side up. That along with cooking it the recommended six hours made the brisket just a tad bit dry. I did not give it five stars because with all of the five star ratings I just thought this brisket would be to die for. I'm not saying that it's not good and not worthy I just thought it would be a lot better. I also made the barbecue sauce and doubled the recipe like most other comments recommended.

All I can say is WOW!! This is just amazing. I used Onion Salt and Garlic Powder since I didn't have Garlic salt and it still turned out great, I also used 3 TBPS of the liquid smoke which gave it a nice smoky flavor but not too much! This is a keeper for sure. I didn't make the sauce with it this time but I will the next time I make this, which will be very soon!!

My brisket weighed 3.7 lbs. - so I cooked it at 300 degrees in the oven for 4 hours.  Another reviewer wondered whether to leave the foil on the brisket, after marinating it overnight - I wondered also!  I left the foil on, and put it in a covered casserole dish.  It came out fine - very tender. After the 4 hours in the oven, I removed the foil, and drained the fat and let it cool for about 45 minutes before slicing it up and returning to the oven for an hour  with the sauce.  I had no celery salt, but used about 1/2 teaspoon of celery seeds to the sauce.   It was delicious served by itself, or on rolls as a sandwich.  Looking forward to the leftovers!

Outstanding recipe that made my entire family rave! I read all the reviews and was convinced to give it a try.  After marinating it all night, I put it in the crock pot rather than the oven and it literally fell apart - it was so tender.  Sauce is incredible and I served it on the side and did not add it during the last hour.  I followed the recipe (Minus the celery salt because I didn't have any). You will love it!

This might have been the best barbecue brisket I ever had. I'm so glad I thought to cut my piece of brisket in half because now I can make this again. It was fantastic.

I rubbed the brisket with some barbecue rub and refrigerated it overnight. Then, I put it with all the ingredients listed and cooked it in the crockpot for seven hours. Sliced it and cooked for another 30 minutes. The whole family enjoyed this one! There wasn't a scrap left!

This was so good, my family just loved it! I did make it a little easier for my life by cooking it in the crock pot and just skipped the refrigerator part. Even with the changes this is a new favorite addition to our family!

After reading all of the rave reviews, I decided I would make this recipe for my 16 guests. I wasn't disappointed! It was absolutely delicious and even better the next day. I cooked 11lbs in my oven for 6 hours. After I took it out of the oven, I scrapped off the extra fat and shredded the meat. I would also recommend cutting the meat into bite-sized pieces with scissors if you are going to be using buns. I added the delicious BBQ sauce and cooked for another hour. I also cooked a 3lb brisket in my crockpot. I wasn't sure if everyone would like the BBQ sauce so I cooked this brisket in beef broth and added sliced onion and a few garlic cloves. In the end, everyone raved about the BBQ. The oven was easier and didn't have to cook as long. Don't pass up this recipe! It is definitely a keeper and super easy for a large crowd.

Cooked this for a large group and it was gone within the first hour.  People loved it.  I made a couple revisions like using fresh garlic, cooked it in a turkey bag (that was key) and shredded it and put the juices and the meat in a crock pot to keep warm.  Kept the sauce on the side for people to add on their own.

I can't believe how EASY this recipe is!  So delicious.  My family prefers it without bbq sauce.  Mine always cooks quicker than the 5-6 hour time, only taking about 4 hours.  Very tender and the best brisket I've had!

This dish is amazing! I cooked mine in the slow cooker, and it came out perfect. Sadly, we had no left overs. Next timeI will get a bigger piece of meat. The only changes were to the sauce - I left out the celery salt and added onion powder and garlic powder. It cooked on low in the slow cooker for about 5 hours, then I cut it, put it back in the cooker and cooked it in the sauce for another hour. DEE-LICOUS! I dare say that it was better than the brisket at our favorite barbeque resturant. Thanks Cathy G!

The brisket itself is great, but I didn't care for the sauce. As another person said, it had a very vinegar-ish taste. I added a couple extra tablespoons of brown sugar and it helped quite a bit.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I was looking for a cooking method for cooking brisket in the oven and this was perfect!  Super moist and very tasty.  The extra step of slicing the brisket and pouring the sauce over it in the final cooking hour was what really made this recipe a winner.  I used a bottled texas-style bbq sauce and mixed it with the beef juices and poured on top of the sliced brisket.  Perfection!

I live in Central Texas and we have so many brisket places here. I would never think I was going to cook such a great brisket. This was so easy and the BBQ sauce was amazing. I will never buy it in the store again. Very simple to make, there is no need to change the recipe at all. I have shared it with all my friends. Thank you for sharing.

Unbelievable!!!  I have never had good luck with brisket until I tried this recipe.  It was so tender and delicious.  The only thing I would caution is the salt content.  I think I will use the onion or garlic powder instead of the salts.  Winner, winner...brisket dinner!!!

FANTASTIC! Not normal for me but, I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out excellent.  Other reviewers were unsure whether they were supposed to cook the brisket still wrapped in the foil.  I took it out of the foil before putting it in the pan and just covered the pan with foil and it turned out perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Its so easy and extremely tender and delicious! Everyone loved it.

This was lovely. The only thing I wished I could change was the smoke flavoring. I cant get any here in the UK, or if there is some I dont know where I can buy it. I think that would have made it perfect!!! I added a bit of honey to mine as well as I just fancied a honey BBQ sauce for my Pork Shoulder. Great job. This is the second time I've used this. And I cant see me wanting to use any other recipe again. Its a huge hit! Thank you for the great recipe!

So Yummy! I didn't use the liquid smoke because I don't really like smoked flavors. Without it, it was still perfect. Tender, juicy, so yummy. I did it in the crock pot. My husband wants me to cook it every week. I served it with asparagus and sweet potatoes. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this recipe this weekend.  Brisket was tender and good.  Pretty average.  The sauce however we really liked.  That is what set this recipe apart for us.  It reminded us of a sweet and sour bbq sauce.  If you like a sweet bbq sauce with a gentle smoke flavor you will like this one.  We really enjoyed it, but only because of the sauce. We realized after though that we used cups on the brown sugar.  We really liked it that way... It was sweet, but good.

This was pretty good.  I only had a few hours to marinate and wish I would have had longer.  Also, I wrapped this in foil and grilled outside for about an 1.5 hours instead of baking.  Probably would have been more tender if I had baked it, but I was craving some grilled brisket!  Good flavor though!

This might have been better if it had been cooked in the crock pot...the meat came out tough and the sauce totally overpowered the taste of the brisket... was too "katsupy"... we paired this with the Southwestern Pasta Salad, roasted corn and a bottle of Allagash Curieux so the meal was still good but could have been better with a better meat dish.

I first made this recipe three years ago for my mother's birthday party. I read many of the reviews and followed the suggestions to double the sauce. Since 50 people were attending the party, I did a dry run of the recipe the weekend before. It was fantastic - everyone raved about how great it was. I am making it this weekend for my Memorial Day party and everyone that tried it three years ago, is very excited about having it again.

Great recipe...altered it a little to suit our tastes, but it was VERY easy to do so and still turned out WONDERFUL!!!!  I've used the sauce part of the recipe with other things like bbq roast beef, bbq chicken, etc...never fails to elicit great rounds of compliments!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I used this recipe with a chuck roast in my slow cooker-it was delicious! It didn't even need barbeque sauce, maybe just a little more liquid smoke. I will try it with a brisket next time.

This was a a great recipe. I did triple the sauce recipe and I changed it a little because it was kind of ketchup-y tasting. To the sauce I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, a 1/2 cup vinegar, a half a cup of Worcestershire (total), and I added 1/2 an onion that was softened first by boiling in 1/2 cup of water. Even though I made these changes I still give the recipe a five star because the basic recipe was good, just not tangy enough for my family's taste.

I made this exactly by the recipe and I have to question cooking this at 300 degrees for such a long time. When I took my brisket out 5 1/2 hours into cooking, it looked burned. I completed the recipe and in the end it was either tough or burned to a black crisp.  I did not care for this recipe.

My husband was convinced that he was not going to eat brisket. LOL.  I needed something easy to make for the day since I was working all day.  I doubled the sauce and only added half of the mustard.   It was gobbled down!!  I will serve this to all the hungry men in the house from now on!!  I'd like more recipes like this one!

Great flavor. We cook brisket in the smoker during the summer and this was just as good. Added water to the bottom of the pan to keep the meat from drying out.

I took the advice of several of the other posters and our brisket turned out to be amazing!  I had never made one before and I was a little apprehensive but it was so easy and good - my fiance actually gave this an A+ and it's on the dinner list!

My brisket turned out AMAZING!  I did use garlic powder rather than garlic salt and am glad that I did.  I was also a little pinched on time and didn't make the BBQ sauce listed and served it with one of our favorite sauces also allowing people to control how much or how little sauce they had.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  WOW!

I didn't look at the packaging for the brisket and finally realized after cooking it that it was packaged in salt brine. Needless to say, the brisket tasted like a salt lick. Next time I would either have to omit all salts or buy a different kind of brisket.

I was skeptical because of the simplicity of the recipe, but this was delicious! The only thing I did differently was double the sauce, but that is just a preference because the meat tasted great without it!

If six stars were available, we'd rate it that. This was amazing. We turned these into BBQ Beef sandwiches. We have a food chain down here called Dickey's BBQ and the sandwiches taste identical. 

We used Eye of Round and we put ours in the crock pot. I added maybe about a 1/4 cup of beef broth at the bottom of the crock so the moisture would tenderize the beef and it wouldn't burn down. 

After it was done cooking, we removed the liquid and discarded it and shredded the beef, put back in the crockpot and then added the sauce to the beef. We let it go for about 30 more minutes. I accidentally forgot to put the mustard in the sauce and it was great without it. We also substituted garlic salt for celery salt. 

My husband couldn't even wait to get to the table to start to eat his. This is going on our permanent recipe rotation. YUM!

This was good.  It was a 5 star before the sauce was put on it though.  My husband I both liked it sooooo much better without the suace.  I will definitly make it again, just with no sauce!!  :)

This was extremely delicious and easy.  I doubled the sauce recipe and kicked it up a bit with some Frank's Red Hot sauce and garlic powder.  I also removed all the remaining fat before slicing.

Excellent brisket! I slow cooked it in the oven according to the recipe. The last hour with the BBQ sauce on the beef slices made this one a winner.

I just made the sauce for this recipe, added a few touches of my own (extra liquid smoke, hot sauce instead of water, celery seeds instead of celery salt, crushed black peppers, italian herbs) and it's amazing!  My friends all love it and I've been named the BBQ king of Manhattan by them, haha.

WOW, this was great!  Made this for dinner on Sunday and my family couldn't get enough.  Husband said it was the best sauce he's ever tasted.  The second time I made it he asked me to double the sauce so he could use some on his potato wedges.  This is definitely a keeper!

I had this recently at a Christmas party and it was delicious.  I'm making it for our family get-together for Christmas Eve and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.

Excellent!  I think next time I will cook at 200-250 degrees. 300 for that length of time, was a little to much. The sauce is great but could be "kicked up" maybe with a jalapeno while cooking then taken out? Husband agreed this is our new BBQ sauce recipe and brisket recipe!

At first glimpse I thought this would be very salty. Regardless, I did follow this recipe and I was pleasantly surprised it was not salty. I too, doubled the sauce recipe.  I did not re-use the existing pan once it came out of the oven after 5 hours. I couldn't imagine mixing all the fat with the sauce and was fearful about a salty favor so I dumped it out and began anew. I had a 5lb brisket and 5 hours for me was bit long but the meat did come out tender.  I didn't think the sauce was that great either.  I will suggest offering some Chiptole sauce to husband. I would not serve this to guests as is that's for sure. I think a recipe should be rated as submitted and not have to rely on others suggestions.

I was working on the 4th so I decided to prepare something "BBQ" that would be ready when I got home. I used a pot roast because I couldn't get brisket, and browned it first before putting it in the slow cooker with 2 slices of sweet onion for a "rack" and a little pineapple juice for liquid - for 9 hrs. During the last hour I removed the onion and cooking liquid, then added the BBQ sauce while breaking up the meat into chunks. The meat was fantastic, but the sauce - made exactly per recipe - was just okay. Nothing to write home about. I would use a bottled BBQ sauce next time - simpler and more flavorful.

I was a bad girl, I didn't follow the directions.  I can tell though that if I would have this would have been great. I poured the liquid smoke over the meat in a baking dish and let it marinate and then cooked it in the same dish. Then I added the BBQ sauce to meat.  Then the liquid smoke that was poured over the meat mixed with the sauce and made for a salty concoction. The meat by itself and the BBQ sauce by itself was great so next time I will follow directions to a T.

I used a 2.5lb brisket, threw it in the crock pot, poured 2x the sauce on it, and cooked on low for 8 hrs.  Then I cut it into slices and cooked another 1 hr.  It was yummy but I might try with a different sauce because I've found better bbq sauces on this site.

The Barbeque sauce in this recipe just lacks the kick I expect from a quality sauce. The brisket was wonderfully tender though. Maybe just make your own favorite barbecue or store bought sauce and this recipe greatly improves.

I've never had brisket, and so had no idea what to expect. My oven cooks hot, so mine was a little too done on the bottom. Inspite of that - the meat was very tender and tasty (minus the bottom part, which I removed, lol). I'll definitely be making this again with some minor adjustment to cook time/temp. Don't skip the sauce!!

This recipe took a little time and was good.  Just didn't wow us.  Again, really enjoyed but for the work-no wow factor.  Barbq is definately an individual taste preference-my husband and I like different tastes-mine more sweet and his more spicey.  So, just my opinion and an idea of my taste.  Give it a try and see what you think!

I love this recipe and I have made it many times now.  It makes a wonderful sandwich on french bread the next day, if you have any left overs at all.  I do use less onion salt and garlic salt, often just use onion and garlic powder instead.  That way you can control the amount of salt you are adding.  I also use less butter in the sauce.  

I like to use my slow cooker and throu everything in there and cover with foil and forget about it for several hours.  (Well, to be honest, it is hard to forget it because of a wonderful smell!)  
Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

I made a brisket for the very first time on Christmas Eve 2005 for family and friends. I chose this recipe because I liked the ingredients for the marinade. It came out with wonderful flavor and the guys even asked me to make some more of the sauce to poor over the leftovers it was so tasty.

This is very good and is a 4.5. We didn't use liquid smoke because we put the brisket in our smoker that had mesquite wood chips. Delicious! Thanks!

Great sauce.  Much better than store bought.  The brisket was very tender & tasty.  I would use the sauce for ribs or any other recipe that calls for BBQ sauce.

The BBQ sauce was a bigger hit than the beef but still enjoyed by everyone.  I'll make the sauce again to serve with other fare.

I made this brisket for my New Year's Eve party, and it was a great success. I received many compliments. I made it a day in advance and reheated in the crock pot the day of the party. I, too, doubled the sauce which gave me plenty leftover to use for another meal. I played with the seasoning in the sauce a little to suit my personal tastes. This is defintely a keeper. Thanks Cathy!

I tried this recipe to bring to a work potluck and it was a huge hit; at least 6 people asked for the recipe. I did alter the recipe ever slightly. I added a half cup of Makers Mark Bourbon to the BBQ sauce.

This is a terrific recipe.  I'm from Texas, and it sure is good to get a taste of home.  I used a brisket rub from the grocery (Fiesta or Adams) and the Mesquite flavored liquid smoke.  I'm converting these midwesterners one by one.

Excellent.  I did change alittle.  I couldn't find a brisket at the store so I used a 3 pound London Broil.  I put it in the crock pot for 3 hours on low then switched it to high for 3 hours.  Then followed the recipe as indicated.  This turned out very good.  Everyone loved it and I will definately make it again.  Thank You for such a delicious recipe!!

I thought the sauce was delicious, and agree that it is way better than the store-bought stuff. I just wish it was a little thicker in consistency. I made this with a 1.5 pound brisket, and it took well over 3 hours before it was tender. Good recipe. Thanks, Cathy!

I made this for guests and they didn't have seconds or say a word.  The brisket took longer to cook than the recipe said and still were not fork tender.  The sauce was good, but I had to make some revisions to kick it up.  I would not make this recipe again.

My husband also spent many years living in West Texas. I made this for his birthday dinner and he LOVED it as well as the rest of our family. I made extra sauce for the side. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really delicious! The only thing I will do differently next time is to make extra sauce to mop bread into!

EASY EASY EASY!! the meat is wonderful and just melts in your mouth and the sauce is superb. followed the recipe to the T, but you can add whatever you want to the sauce and it would still turn out well. not for those who cook on the fly, as you need to prep the brisket the day before. even my FIL, who is from southwest beef country approved!!!

Any recipe that my 11 year old LOVES gets a five star rating from me....actually, we all loved it.  With the exception of cooking in my crockpot, I followed the recipe exactly.  Will make again for sure.

I have never made brisket before, but this turned out great both times I made it!  I sliced it across the grain so it wouldn't be stringy, and it made beautiful slices.  The sauce is wonderful.

Not sure why the hype, I made this, yes it was tender, but the bbq sauce was average at best.  This was an average dish, my husband said it was "okay" my 4 year old only ate it with steak sauce on it and my 2 year old that eats everything wouldn't touch it.  I wouldn't waste my money again.

I have made this atleast 4 times and it turned out great each time.  It was a big hit at the last pool party and several people asked for the recipe.  I think the BBQ sauce is the best part.

This recipes is sooo good and sooo easy.  My whole family loved it!  We used it to make sandwiches but next time I think that I will not combine the BBQ sauce with the meat and just let everyone add as much as they want.  The brisket was great even without it but the sauce is never the less delicious.

This was my first brisket and I was very impressed and I'm not impressed with my cooking very often.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the time down a little since I only had  a 3lb brikset.  The smell was so incredible I could barely wait until it was done.

Excellent recipe!  We use this BBQ sauce for all our BBQ meats, right now I am cooking pork ribs and will be using this sauce.  My kids (who are 5 yrs old and 20 months old) love it as well.  Can adjust spices as needed.

Yum!  Thank you, Cathy!  I usually cook my brisket then slice it and put it in a crockpot all day with KC Masterpiece.  I thought I'd search here before I did that just to see if I could get any different ideas and I found your recipe and used it for the sauce.  It was delicious!  I still love KC Masterpiece, but I'll be using your recipe for brisket from now on!

This was very good! I have never attempted to make Brisket(I'm in Tx), but I read all the other reviews and heard that it was easy. It was simple and a big hit with the family.  I'm definitely going to make this over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!!

This brisket fell apart it was so tender!!  I marinated it all day, then put it in the oven all night (8 hours).  I fixed it for our neighborhood co-op and served it with rice.  The leftovers were great on a bun!  This is one of the best brisket recipes I've tried.
