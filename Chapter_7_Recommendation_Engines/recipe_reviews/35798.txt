A 5 STAR RECIPE BUT COULD ONLY GIVE IT 4 BECAUSE OF THE TROUBLE OF BREAKING THE RECIPE DOWN FOR ONE FAMILY INSTEAD OF AN ARMY. SORRY!

My mother was from southern IL and we had bbq (smoked pulled pork with a spicy vinegar based sauce) at least 2x a year when we went to visit my grandparents. This is the closest I have found to that sauce I remember as a kid.

"Loose" is putting it lightly. This is basically pure liquid. Good flavor but if you are looking for a "sauce" than this is not the recipe for you. This recipe is great but it is what we call a mopping sauce where I come. It is a spicy vinegar-Y juice that is awesome on pulled pork. Taste great as written and I can only imagine it will get better with time.
