Biscuits are super easy and very tasty.  I do not roll these out.  After kneading I pinch, hand roll and press onto pan.  So quick and easy.  I've made the recipe for years and always get rave reviews.  Much better than some of the ones that take more time and ingredients.

I was looking online for "Quick Buttermilk Biscuits" because I had never made homemade biscuits before. These were very quick and VERY easy. I used cold butter and that left the biscuits VERY flaky. Yum!

This is a review of just the biscuits.    I used self-rising cake flour.  Don't expect these to rise  - but they were excellent!  I cut very large squares - and they were the perfect shape to put sliced ham or eggs in between two of them.
I made these to go with the Sausage Gravy I on this site. Yummy combo!! I will try the ham part of this recipe at Easter time.

The biscuits were quick to make and tasted good. They didn't rise as much as I'd like and weren't very flaky, but for quick biscuits that taste good this is a good recipe.

Sorry, just another biscuit-only review.  These biscuits are everything we love: light, flaky, moist and EASY.  Cut (very cold) butter into flour (all-purpose, with 1.5t baking powder and 1/2t salt added per cup) in food processor, stirred in buttermilk until evenly moist, then just pinched off handfuls of dough and rolled into a flattened ball before putting in a buttered round cake pan, flpping each to have butter top and bottom with the sides of the biscuits touching.  Baked up tall and fluffy, but probably took about 20 minutes to get that little bit of golden brown.  Would like to try the ham one day, but those type are hard to find by us.
