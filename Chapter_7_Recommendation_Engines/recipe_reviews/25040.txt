I tried the other recipe with the award winning chocolate chip cookies.  It also used pudding, but this recipe was so much better.The others were too cakey.  These are the perfect consistency.  Chewey and moist.  No one can believe I made them myself.  

I used instant vanilla pudding instead of the white chocolate, for a ligher cookie.  They are so awesome.  The guys at work all proposed to me!!

These cookies are great.  I made way too many of them, so i sent some of them to work with my husband, and everybody loved them.  They stay soft long after they are baked, and they're just great.  This is easily one of my favorite cookie recipes.

This recipe yields flat cookies with a crispy outside and soft/chewy middle. I used vanilla pudding mix and I really liked the strong vanilla taste.

Excellent cookie. however, because of a previous review, I decreased the salt by 1/4 teaspoon. I also substituted 1/4 cup of the flour for 1/4 cup fo quaker oats. Overall these cookies are not only delicous but they look great too. They look store bought but taste homemade.

These turned out terrific. I did make some alterations to make it healthier. I decreased each sugar by half, used 1 package of Vanilla pudding mix, and substituted a whole cup of white flour for wheat. Next time I will try subbing a quarter of the butter for apple sauce and use more wheat flour.  PS - For those who said your batter was runny...you probably actually made the pudding. You just use the mix as it comes in the box!

great recipe.  I've made this several times.  Big hit with my husband's co-workers.  But I have been asked how to make them thicker.

Very, very good chocolate chip cookie.  Because of the sugar in the pudding, I reduced the white and brown by about 1/3 and reduced the salt by 1/2 at suggestions of other reviewers.    I would also grease the cookie sheets with a thin layer of spray.  My cookies stuck about after cooling for the allotted time.  Cookies were definately a success though.   Chocolatey, soft in the middle and a little bit crispy on the outside.  A keeper!

Very good. I used M&Ms instead of chocolate chips and they still turned out good. If you do the same, use mini m&ms though.

These cookies were delicious and simple to make.  I put the dough in the fridge for a few minutes before i rolled it into balls and it was so much easier to roll.  The final product was a little flatter than i like but they were still chewy.  Overall great cookie i will make again!

This recipe is amazing, I make them all the time and people ask me for the recipe. But I make them peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. I use vanilla pudding instead of white chocolate, omit the salt, add 1/2 cup peanut butter, add a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil, and use milk chocolate chips. I make them gooey, so I only  cook them about 6-8 minutes. Amazing!

I used Mexican vanilla and vanilla pudding, which gave it a stronger taste. I also made a giant cookie in a 15x10 jelly roll pan and baked it for about 18 minutes.

I have made these cookies 3 times now and have never had flat cookies, in fact I wish I could get them to be flatter, they are very fluffy and moist. The only negative comment I have is they were kind of salty and I wont use quite as much salt from now on. I also tried using butterscotch pudding because that was the only thing I had at the time and they turned out better then the white chocolate and vanilla. The butterscotch added a unique but not over powering flavor.

Wonderful. Everyone raved: children, husband, grandparents. Crispy on the outside, chewy on this inside. I followed another reviewer's tip and sub'ed out 1/4 cup of flour for oats. I also used the pudding mix I had in the house: vanilla.  Wonderful recipe! Totally "look store-bought, taste homemade!"

I think these were my favorite chocolate chip cookies EVER.  I used vanilla pudding and increased the flour to 2.5 cups, otherwise made according to recipe.  Only baked for 8 minutes.  Completely fabulous.

I followed the recipe exactly as given.  The cookies turned out moist and chewy with a great flavor.  I baked the first pan for 10 minutes, subsequent pans were baked for 12 minutes.  This yielded sturdier cookies that were still moist, chewy and flavorful.  The only thing that kept me from giving this recipe 5 stars is that they cookies were a little flatter (once cooled) than I was looking for.  The cookies turned out excellent.  I will be making this recipe again, but may experiment with the chips, adding nuts, etc.

These were great!  I finally found a recipe that yeilds the flat cookie I wanted and they're so moist.  I used a 3.3 oz package of vanilla pudding as that is what I had on hand.

I always have a problem with chocolate chip cookies ending up too flat or crispy.  These turned out really soft and slightly puffy.  The only change I made to the recipe is to use sugar free vanilla pudding.  Yum!!

I didn't feel like searching for the White Chocolate pudding mix, so I used French Vanilla, they still turned out great!  Very soft and chewy, even the ones I thought I overbaked are moist, so don't be afraid to let them brown up a bit, especially if you want a better "traveling" cookie.

These were very good.  I did find that I had to refidgerate the dough in-between baking due to the amount of butter in the recipe.  If I didn't, the cookies came out completely flat.

Not good at all. The only reason I but two stars is that a cookie did come out. Way to much salt, and the cookie taste like flour.

Excellent cookie recipe.  The pudding mix makes them very soft and chewy.  My fiance requests these regularly, as do my coworkers!

This was a really great recipe, and I made it with white chocolate, minty chocolate, nuts, etc. Here's the catch: I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of a full cup....Not on purpose....I made the recipe several times using the same mistake! The batter was so hard to mix, but it was worth it. Once I realized my mistake, I had to keep adding flour to get thicker cookies...I think next time I'll try the recipe with 3/4 cup of butter so that I get dense delicious cookies that are still soft and scrumptious! This is a very nice recipe!

These were pretty good but I found them a little salty. This probably was because I halved the recipe but kept the same amout of pudding mix. Other than that, they were really tasty.

These were sooooo! good that I ate six of them right out of the oven (and that isn't good for my already expanding waist line)! Much better than the standard toll house cookies I've been making.

The pudding is definately the key to these soft yummy cookies.  They never last long around our house.  I even hide a few from the kids so I have my own personal stash.  Very Good!

FABULOUS chocolate chip cookies!!!  I did need to cook them just a little bit longer, so just keep an eye on them.  They are delicious, soft, moist cookies and they were a big hit.  Took some to neighbors and they loved them too!  I plan on making these again very soon and trying different flavors of pudding mix.  I'm already getting "orders" from coworkers that haven't even tasted them yet, but heard me talking about them.  These may even go on the permanent yearly Christmas cookie list, too!

They were so GOOD and soft. This was just the recipe I was looking for. I made a lot of them so I gave some to my piano teacher. She thought they were AMAZING!!!! She was so surprised how good they turned out then my whole family devoured them for dinner. My first batch came out a little bit doughy so we put it in for a little bit longer and then they tasted amazing as I said. I would highly recommend this recipe. They are great for for a bake sale or for the holidays. I feel like a pro cook when I make this delicious recipe. I REALLY want to make them again and I'm sure I will!!!!

Best Cookies! My cookies were not flat or crispy like other reviews, perfect, soft, moist, chewy!!! I've made the Award Winning Chocolate chip recipe for at least 3 years...this one is better. My cookies were not "cake" like, just perfectly moist. I think the trick is following the recipe and adding the dry pudding mix into the flour and making "BIG" cookies. I was skeptical of using an ice cream scoop or heaping tablespoon but I think the size is important, maybe that's why people said theirs were crispy? The size of the cookies only allowed me to bake 6 - 9 at a time rather then the dozen I'm used to. I did not line my cookie sheets with foil or parchment paper like I normally do, I wanted to follow this recipe exact and see what results I got.... results = PERFECT!!! I just dropped these off for my girlfriend that just had a baby and before I got home she was calling me for the recipe! She had a household full of guests from all different states and they agreed, hands down, best cookies any of them have ever tasted!

This recipe was not only easy, it was super-delicious! I made them as part of a housewarming gift and now I want to share them with the world. They are lightly crunchy on the outside (not too crunchy where they fall apart), and chewy and soft on the middle. They didn't burn at all (I baked them for 8 minutes on a lighter cookie sheet, ungreased as the recipe says) and they are just outstanding! I will never use a different recipe for chocolate chip cookies.

Seriously, the best home made chocolate chip cookies I have had in a long time.  They were so moist and super easy to make.  I also used vanilla instant pudding mix and substituted dark chocolate chips instead and added walnuts.  Yummy!

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe. The taste wasn't that great and the cookies were drier than I expected. I even added 1/4 cup less flour than it listed. I would not make these again.

These were by far, some of the best cookies I've made. I've never recieved so many great comments! Kind of crispy on the edges, and so moist and chewy in the middle! The only thing I did different was to use half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips (they actually sell them in the same bag.) Be prepared...these will not stay around the house, office or party long. :)

These cookies are fantastic!  We use whatever pudding we have on hand and it always turns out great.  The cookies stay moist for days (or until they are gone).

I have been looking for a chocolate chip recipe with pudding for a long time. I made these cookies many years ago and lost my recipe after moving so many time. I could not beleive my eyes when I came across this recipe!  This recipe is just like the one I used to make.

This recipe is awesome!  I used 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup semisweet chips.  And the store didn't have white choclate pudding mix, so I used vanilla instead.  Still great! :)

Absolutely delicious! Required about 13 minutes in my oven, but I really scooped the dough out big. I substituted white whole wheat flour which I think helped keep them a little thicker than some of the other reviews. I will definitely make these again!

My husband's favorite type of cookie is chocolate chip. Didn't want to do the same ole Nestle recipe.  Baked a batch of these cookie.  Only changes I made was cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, used french vanilla pudding & cut the vanilla down to 1 tsp. They were delicious. Best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. The cookies come out puffy then fall slightly.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, but not doughy. Husband just tasted them and said they are wonderful! This is a keeper!

These cookies are delicious. They taste and look like the soft version of Trader Joe's High Brow Chocolate Chip Cookies. I've used a 5.3 oz of pudding before and nothing went wrong.  They still tasted great.

I've made this one twice.  The first time I followed the recipe except I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  The cookies came out all right, good flavor and chewy and all that, but you could definitely detect something was a little off.  The WWF resulted in a kind of graininess that was unpleasant.

The second time, I made these cookies exactly per the recipe and they were delicious with excellent texture.  Viva all-purpose flour!

I craved a little bit more vanilla flavor so I might use vanilla pudding next time rather than the white chocolate.

This is YUMMY! I wasn't sure about the 3.3 oz pudding, so I used half of my 170g pkg. of Chocolate pudding. Also, I added about 1 Tbsp of milk and reduced the white sugar to 3/4 c as someone else suggested. However, I think even without the changes they'd have been perfect!

I just made this and it is great. I just used a little bit less chocolate chips, used Dr.Oetker vanilla dry mix.

This is my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Around Christmas, I add some pecans and chopped maraschino cherries and call them polka dot cookies :). I always tell people there is a secret ingredient - the pudding!

This was a great recipe but I substitued some things based on what I had in the house.  I used cranberries instead of chocolate chips and almond extract instead of vanilla extract.  YUM!!!

This is a great choc-chip cookies recipe.  I used white choc chips and dried cranberries. They taste great.  Also I made some the large size the recipe indicates and some a dropped by rounded teaspoons. I liked the smaller ones the best because there was more of  them and they were a healthier serving than the large one.

I used a vanilla pudding mix.  I baked them for 13 minutes (I think that you need to know your oven for this part and pay attention to the first sheet of cookies, a little brown on the edges seemed perfect to me)  I will be using this one many times over as I love chewy cookies and this was perfect.

Reduce the sugars. 
Use chunk chocolate. 
Flatten them with the bottom of a glass before baking them.
May take longer than 10 min.

I love this recipe. Whenever I make cookies I use this recipe. I switch the amount of white and brown sugar to make it a little softer. Whenever I want to change these up and try something different I use a different flavored pudding. My favorite is butterscotch pudding with butterscotch and chocolate chips.

It was everything I expected a good cookie to be it was nice soft and chewy. Since I don't like chocolate too much I left out the chocolate chips but I really like the white chocolate pudding flavor which I never thought of adding to a sugar cookie. It kinda reminded me of a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie without the nuts.

I made this with what I had on hand, so I used instant butterscotch pudding mix instead of white chocolate, and I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips. at least in this configuration, there was too much salt... everything else was great. next time I would cut the salt to just a mere dash.

I use Belgium chocolate bars and chop it into chips. I also use vanilla pudding and the best vanilla you can find.  Homemade vanilla it is easy to make but takes time.  The secret is weigh each cookie and refrigerate at least overnight. I freeze the cookie balls I don't bake and bring them out when you have a craving for an amazing mouth watering treat.  I always double the recipe and give some away. These are the cookies I take for the monthly dog rescue bake sale. The funds go for vet care for shelter dogs   I was told that there is a following for these cookies. The extra steps will make you a star.

I think this is my new cookie recipe. I made other pudding chocolate chip recipes, but they always turned out cakey. Like other reviews have said, i used vanilla pudding and i threw in some powder chai tea. They cookies turned out delicious, I am now going to use this as a cookie recipe. I have also made cookies with chocolate pudding and banana pudding with some coconut mixed in-these were delicious too.

I loved this recipe as well as my roommates. I accidentally used chocolate chocolate pudding inside of white chocolate but it was still good. I plan on trying it with other pudding flavors to see how it tastes. If you use a teaspoon for the cookie size you'll get about 92 cookies from one batch

I've  used the cookie base of this recipe to make both white chocolate macadamia nut and chocolate chip cookies, both turned out wonderfully. Thank you so much for sharing!  I will be sharing this recipe with friends and family.

These cookies are AMAZING!  Everyone loves them. I changed it based on what I had on hand. I didn't add salt because I only had salted butter and I used vanilla pudding instead of white chocolate. They are delicious and chewy even when cool. I will be making them again.

By far the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made! I use vanilla pudding mix! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it needs extra flour otherwise they're super flat and hard! and extra 1/4 cup will do the trick!!! Amazing!

Great cookies, I just had to use the sugar free pudding.  That's all I could find.  My family devoured them in a day.

Great recipe! Did not change a thing. Cookies came out perfect. Crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle. My new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Did I mention that they are a hit with my family. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Great recipe for a stay-soft chocolate chip cookie!  I used French vanilla flavored pudding mix and since we were making these for Santa, we used half chocolate chips and half red & green M&M's.  I chilled the dough and dropped the batter using a cookie scoop.  No issues with too flat or thin cookies, and they baked up beautifully.  I wasn't crazy about the other recipe that called for pudding mix on this site, so I did not expect to like these as much as I do.

Oh Yummmm!!!
This recipe takes chocolate chip cookies to another level. I did add a 1/4 tsp of ground clove by accident (was confusing it for another recipe when I started), but it gave a little extra flavor, I'm going to say ;)
As I'm making them my husband (The Cookie Monster) dips his finger in the batter once, then demands I tell him what I did differently. "These have something else! What is it?" I wouldn't tell him (heehee). Eventually, I had to kick him out of the kitchen so I could have enough dough to make another batch. My son gets the beater to lick, though ;)
As soon as the first batch is done here come my boys begging for a cookie. Well, the husband comes and takes...my son asks with his ever-so-adorable puppy dog pleading face. 
I now have 39 cookies to share (left from the 5 that were eaten right away). Over-all, they're a hit. Thank you for sharing. Now to separate & distribute as gifts :D

Amazing.  Don't know if it's my oven, but did need to bake for longer than directed and cookies were still very light.  I did use vanilla pudding mix.

I love this recipe.  I only use 1 tbsp of white sugar though.  I like a saltier cookie. The first time I made this recipe using the full cup of sugar, they spread out more, but they were too sweet.  1 tbsp white sugar, and sometimes a little extra brown sugar - and they are perfect.  For me and the air insulated pans I use, I bake them for slightly longer...apprx 15 minutes.  Someone already said it but for the pudding mix - you add the dry mix to the dry ingredients.  Don't actually make it into pudding.

I was looking for a cookie recipe that would make perfectly flat round cookies for ice cream sandwiches.  This turned out to be it!   My only criticism is that they are too thin for our liking.  The second time I made them, I exchanged 1/4 cup of butter for 1/4 cup of shortening and added an additional 1/2 cup of flour.  I made larger than normal ball and flattened them, cooking them for 11 minutes.  They came out perfectly!  And they tasted just as decadent as they looked!  We made ice cream sandwiches for the entire football team.  They were a hit!  Thank you!

I made these and they turned out perfect! I did use a little less chocolate chips because of previous experience. They tasted amazing with crisp on the outside and soft, gooey dough in the middle.

This recipe was pretty good. I really liked the use of the pudding packet to make them so moist. The use of so much vanilla had a pleasing effect too. I think that the dough was kind of runny though and caused to cookies to spread a little more than I would have liked. I might try it again and tweak it a little to see if I get different results.

They're pretty good. I didn't have the chocolate pudding but I did have French vanilla. Also I didn't have enough chocolate chips so added some peanut butter chips to make the one cup. I don't recommend the peanut butter chips but a different kind would probably be better. Other than my personal issues this is an awesome recipe.

Umm yeah, I made these with chocolate pudding mix this evening and my husband ate one and a half trays before I got done baking the rest. And this is coming from a guy who usually doesn't like chocolate... I baked them at 350°F for 15 minutes and decreased the salt by half a teaspoon. I used a standard cookie scoop and they came out perfect! I'm going to try vanilla pudding next time.

This recipe was awesome!  I don't understand the runny comments. I used a french vanilla pudding mix, and only 1/2 the chocolate chips. It is a funny story how mixed up all the directions, and I had to add water until it looked like a cookie dough.  Still, a great looking and great tasting cookie.
