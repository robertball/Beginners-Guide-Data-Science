These were wonderful!  Instead of using individual toothpicks I put about 10 on skewers.  It made it much easier to turn.

We added a pack of ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese before stuffing the peppers and it tasted even better than before!!

These are very good.  The suggestion of 2 teaspoons of cream cheese is a bit off...it's more like 1 teaspoon. Also, for some reason mine took forever to cook....an additional 20 minutes.  I finally turned the over up to 375.

I started out making these with my mom when I was 10 years old. At first we did them the same way the recipe says and they turn out great but through the years I have come up with some other ways and additions to the recipe. One thing you have to make sure you do correctly is get all of the seed and stems out of the jalapeno. If not they will most likely be too hot to eat comfortaby. I also cook my bacon first and crumble it and add it to the cream cheese mix. I also cook a chopped onion in the grease and add that to the mix too. I add garlic powder and tonys and stuff the jalps with the mix and cook on 350 for about 30-45 minutes. I usually make stuffed mushrooms the same time I make the jalps and I stuff them with the same mix and cook the same time. They are both always a huge hit! I make them for every party we have.

I have made jalapeno pepper appetizers dozens of times and they are not always the same. Some have been very mild and others were so smoking hot that I could not eat them. The heat really depends on the peppers. I LOVE hot food but OUCH! One suggestion I have is, use green or red bell peppers instead of jalapeno peppers. You would probably have to use less cream cheese, or maybe substitute with a chunk of string cheese??? Then wrap in bacon and bake like the recipe suggests. I have used green peppers instead of jalapeno in the chicken stuffed peppers and it worked really well. Also, we serve ours with ranch dip/dressing or blue cheese. YUM!!!

Wonderful, I have been making theses for many years always a big hit!  I make a double recipe because they go so fast.  One hint; they take a little longer to prepare than listed.  I prep the night before then cover with foil.  I donâ€™t put them in the oven they are much better on the grill!!!

ok before I made these myself I read the reviews first and every review said that these things aren't hot.  WELL I dont know what I did different but these things were SCREAMING hot.  I had smoke comin out of my ears, I couldn't even swallow one...all I could think was "If I swallow I'm dead". LOL.  And I am no stranger to hot food.  BUT if you can handle the heat they really are quite delicious and it's killing me that I cant handle the heat because I want them!!  But good luck to all who venture there.

Fabulous! I cooked on the grill in a fish basket which added a great outdoor flavor just keep a close eye as the bacon fat drippings will cause the flames to rise and sear. I substituted Neufschatel for cream chees on half on the peppers for a lower calorie choice and you could not tell the difference. I removed ALL seeds and ribs which took out the HOT so I would include a little more ribbing next time to make a bit spicier. Everyone loved this dish! Easy to make the night before too.

I make a recipe similar to this, but I use 1 and 1/2 packages of cream cheese to 10-16 peppers depending on size.  I add 1 tbsp mccormicks cajun seasoning and 2tsp garlic powder to the cream cheese and I use peppered bacon.  They are great for grilling at tailgates and are always gone in a flash!  For more kick sprinkle with cayenne pepper after wrapped and before grilling.

I just went to a Babyshower a few weeks ago where they served these.  OMG, they were sooo delicious!!!  The gal that made them thought she picked the wrong thing to make because she thought people wouldn't care for spicy foods...they were a hit!  Everyone raved about them.  I can't wait to make them!!!

I make these a lot. I try to get the largest jalapenos available--they're easier to stuff and aren't too hot. Use a spoon to remove the seeds and ribs, and most importantly, WEAR GLOVES. On the really large chiles, I use a whole slice of bacon. A couple of those big boys is about like a full meal! Make sure you have more than 4 oz. cream cheese available, as the recipe amounts are really dependant on the size of the chiles. I also bake mine @ 425 for about 20 minutes.

I have made these twice now, once following the instructions and once with another user's recommendation to blanch the jalapenos in boiling water first.  This is a great recipe, but I use a only a half slice of bacon for each pepper and I broil on a wire rack in a half sheet pan until the bacon is nice and crisp.  I strongly recommend preparing this way and NOT blanching the peppers first.  I was trying to be sensitive to those who don't like spicy food and ended up with rubbery, bland peppers when I boiled them.  I may as well have used cooked green peppers for all the flavor they had.  People like jalapeno poppers because of the little bit of heat.  Don't make my mistake and ruin a good thing.

We have been making these for years. We season the cream cheese with garlic & chives. It adds a lot to the flavor. After filling the peppers with cream cheese we put them in the freezer for about an hour or so. It takes out some of the heat from the peppers. It also makes wrapping the bacon around them easier. I bet using the flavored cream cheese in the tub would good also.  Be sure to se thin sliced bacon. Thick just curls off.

I've made these a couple of times now and they're always gone first. I added some taco seasoning to the cream cheese before stuffing the peppers, That added a lot of flavor. Then I baked them at 400 for about 40 minutes, which made the bacon nice and crisp.

I really enjoyed these.  I did boil the jalapenos for about 2 minutes and then cooled them and filled with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes then broiled for a couple to really crisp up the top.  Delicious!!!

To keep the peppers from being too "flaming hot to eat" rinse them in cold water after thouroughly de-veining them. (wear gloves) and then fill each pepper with sugar.  Let the pepper set with the sugar while preparing for the filling. Shake out the majority of the sugar before filling with cream cheese.  If you dont get it all out, dont worry it will not affect the taste, only makes the pepper a little milder.

I have been making these for almost 20 years, I usually grill them, if you use a smoker you get an amazing flavor. I usually cook them on my indoor grill. When we make them we have to make between 10 and 20lbs of peppers! They are loved that much... even love them cold for breakfast the next day!

I love these and they are always a hit at parties.  My only change to the recipe is I use Hormel real bacon bits and mix it into the cream cheese and then I don't have the hassle of wrapping the bacon around the pepper.  Works well and tastes great.

They were just great! But do keep in mind that they are meant to be appetizers so more than two may upset your stomach or won't taste that great to you afterwards. But yes nice little treats they are.

Made these for the New Year and my family LOVED them. I had to bake them for a little longer than the suggested time maybe 10 more minutes but they were worth it. Definitely would make these again-they were gone within minutes.

I made a few changes to the original recipe instead of cream cheese i did mozzerela cheese and added just a tiny bit of chopped garlic and a sprinkle of thyme and mexican oregano. I left it extra time in the oven so the bacon got really crisp and WHOA they were the BOMB in my family gathering  =)

These are good. We did use peppered bacon instead of regular. They are not that spicy at all, I was expecting more heat but they are very tasty. We did have some issues getting the bacon done before the cream cheese ended up all over the pan but most of that was just how we wrapped it. Very tasty recipe.

Pretty good.  I can see the potential in these.  What lacked in flavour was the cream cheese filling.  Next time I'm going to add some herbs or spices to the cream cheese.  Will make again.  And we love spicy food and after cleaning out the seeds and "white spines" I didn't find it all that hot, but had a nice kick.

Recipe was ok. Next time i will make one change and that is to precook bacon first to eliminate some of the grease. Peppers were a little spicy kids couldnt really eat them.  But other than that i will definately make them again.

we love these and have tried several different ways to make them, the jalapeno peppers for us are just to hot...so we have found anaheim peppers to be an awsome change. there just slightly warm to the mouth and we use about 6 peppers to 1-8oz cream cheese i also add 2 tablespoons whorchestersire and some onion and garlic powder and baking is the way to go, 350 for about 45-50 minutes and then broil for 5-10 min. perfect!!!!

These are SOOO good!  I used the idea of one of the reviews and added a packet of ranch dip seasoning to the cream cheese.  I also cooked the bacon in a skillet partially before wrapping peppers to cut back on the grease.  Everyone loved them!

These were wonderful!!!!   Not too hot at all.  I took some of the suggestions others gave about adding some Ranch Dressing Mix to the cream cheese.  I was so happy I did, it gave such a great flavor.  My husband & I are vegetarian so I omitted real bacon.  I used Morning Star Farms Bacon Strips instead.  In the remaining 10 mins of cooking time I wrapped the jalapenos with the defrosted "bacon" strips and sprayed them with a bit of oil so they wouldn't dry out.  The result was a success!  Thanks for the recipe.  I WILL be making these again.

As per various reviews of this recipe, I added a packet of ranch dip mix; I thought the flavor result was a little overpowering. Also, the peppers were not hot at all--I was nervous because so many reviewers mentioned it was TOO hot. Next time, I'll leave a bit of spine and seeds before I stuff the peppers, maybe I'll even mix in some seeds and cajun seasoning with the cream cheese. I used applewood smoked bacon to wrap around the peppers, and it tasted absolutely divine.

I doubled the amount of cream cheese and added fiesta ranch dip, a pinch of chili powder, and about 1 cup of mexican blend cheeses. I wrapped with thick cut bacon and baked at 350 for 1 hour.

I have made these on several occasions and they are always a hit.  The cream cheese really takes the heat of the peppers to a more mellow level.

Make these often, but since the size of jalapenos
vary, instead of measuring the cream cheese teaspoon by teaspoon, I just use how ever much it takes to fill each one.  I use regular, not whipped cream cheese as it is firmer.  Normally, I cut, prepare the jalapenos and stuff them one day, then refrigerate overnight and bacon wrap on the following day.  I do a large batch each time,  layer them on foil and freeze.  After they are frozen, I package them in plastic bags until needed.  Allow to defrost slightly before placing in 350 degree oven on a wire rack so grease will drain off.

I made these Saturday for an appetizer. I used Cheddar Cheese Spread instead of Cream Cheese. I had to cook them longer than listed to get the bacon really crispy. They were excellent!!! Husband asked me the next day if I was going to make more. :)

The guests loved them!  Used a little ranch as others suggested.  I also precooked the bacon for a few minutes so I could blot up some of the grease.

These are fantabulous! I was concerned they would be too spicy, but, as long as you clean out ALL the seeds and membranes from the inside of the jalapeno the spice is not at all overwhelming. Really great! Thanks!

Just outstanding. I added a packet of Ranch dressing mix as another reviewer mentioned and used thick bacon slices that would add more flavor. I baked for  1/2 hour at 350 and the bacon came out nice and crispy and there was just a hint of hotness. Will definitely make again and can easily double or triple the recipe for parties.

What to do with an overabundance of jalapenos from the garden? Why, make these appetizers.  The pepper's heat gets toned down by the cream cheese.  So easy!  So tasty!  My kids love 'em!

Delicious! I used precooked bacon, and at 400 for 10 minutes. These had a mild kick, but not so much kick that I was turned off. Tastes great with ranch dip. It's a new favorite!

This was awesome.  I agree that it is better than jalapeno poppers.  I did add a ranch dressing packet to the cream cheese and it added a lot of flavor.  I also think these would be better on the grill.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is better than poppers, and easier to make. They are not hot, even the children liked them. It did take 35 minutes to cook the thin sliced bacon. Next time I'll add some spice to the cream cheese.

I made a buffet of appetizers for company and tried these out. They were the first to be eaten and well received by everyone. They are easy to prepare and throw in the oven when your ready. They do need extra cooking time but well worth it. I prepared them as the recipe recommended but next time will leave a little more in the peppers for more flavor as we did not find them hot at all - Thanks again.

I've been making these for years and they are always a big hit.  2 things I do differently thorough is that I use turkey bacon and I smoke them for 60 to 90 minutes at 250 degrees.

I made these for 16 people....I didn't have enough!  I did not worry about the measurements of cream cheese as I just scooped it into the jalapenos after I seeded them.  Also I added the breakfast weenies after the cream cheese, then wrapped them in bacon that I dragged through some honey (on a plate).  They were gone within 10 minutes after serving, I had about 40 on the platter.  One note, they are done when the bacon is to your desired done-ness. About 20-30 min. in the oven.

After reading the reviews, we skipped wrapping the bacon and instead crumbled it into the cream cheese mixture along with finely sliced green onions, a little garlic powder & onion powder and put them on the grill when they were almost done cooking. Oh, I cooked the peppers for about 15 minutes at 350 first before stuffing them with the mixture because one of the reviews mentioned the cheese filling spilling out. I found the mixture stayed together perfectly w/the bacon & onions in the mixture to help hold it together. Topped each one with a sliced black olive. Will definitely make this again!

I liked it after tweaking. Added shredded cheddar & Hidden Valley Southwestern Ranch mix in the cream cheese. I also decided to sneak in turkey bacon to wrap the jalapenos in and nobody noticed the difference.

These are awesome! I made 40 of them for a party that ended up having 12 people and they were ALL gone!  I did have to cook them 30 mins. and bump up the oven to 425 for an extra 5 mins to crisp them up! Thank You!

My sister brought this recipe home about 10 years ago and they have been served at family gatherings ever since. Everyone always asks if I will be making "Armadillo Eggs" (that's what my family calls them). I noticed that the cook time in the directions is off, they will take at least 35 minutes to bake at about 375 degrees. If you like bacon as much as we do you can wrap each pepper half in a FULL strip of bacon but increase the cook time and drop the oven temp back to 350 so the bacon cooks all the way through. If you wrap them so that the loose end of the bacon sits under the pepper they stay together fine, no toothpick needed. Enjoy!

After securing with toothpick, I toss in freezer for about 10 minutes.  This helps cook the bacon more without losing the cream cheese out the sides.  Loved the recipe, Be sure to clean all the seeds and filament, otherwise it may be too hot for some tastebuds.

These are so yummy!  I changed a few things, first, I used light cream cheese.  I also put a small amount of honey in the bottom of the halved jalapeno.  I let the cream cheese soften and piped it on top of the honey. (Just grab a ziploc, snip off the corner and squeeze.)  Makes it much easier to fill! I then layed a 1/3 of a piece of bacon across the top instead of tediously wrapping them. Cooked them on 375 for about 15 minutes. (Grill works too!) Took about 30 of them to a party and they didn't last five minutes.  Thanks so much!

These were excellent and everyone raved!!  Next time I may try cooking the bacon for a short time in the microwave before wrapping the jalapenos, just to give it a head start and to help it cook faster.  It did take quite a bit longer (almost double) than the time listed for the bacon to get crisp.  I also may try adding garlic (2t) and cajun (1T) to the cream cheese (or NeufchÃ¢tel for lower calories) and may even serve them with ranch dressing for dipping.  Definitely a keeper though!

These were great!  We soaked the jalapenos over night in water so that they were not as hot.  They were really easy and really good.  I will have to work on getting the bacon wrapped around better.

This was a delicious dish.  I used jalapenos from a jar, the whole ones.  The downsize is that they are much smaller than fresh ones, as shown in the photo.  However, they cook much faster, and you can do more with less.  I cut the bacon strips in half lengthwise and widthwise, and put maybe a teaspoon of cheese in.  Turned out great as a poker party snack!

My review is on the original recipe first time made as it, it was good but lacking taste.  Second time I mixed the cream cheese with diced jalapenos, added addl jalapeno juice. Mixed with my hand mixer and added shredded pepper jack cheese.  took these to a potluck and they were devoured! Its has 4 star potential

What a great recipe! I used center cut bacon and precooked it in the oven for about 10 minutes to lower the fat a bit. Added a bit of ranch dressing mix, like the other reviewers suggested but followed the rest of the recipe and they turned out great! I never saw an appetizer disappear so quickly!! Getting the jalapenos ready took a bit of time but can easily be done ahead of time. Definitely a keeper!!

These are SO GOOD! I made them for a Mexican-themed dinner party and got rave reviews. The only change I made was to mix in 1/2 cup of Mexican cheese (pre-shredded blend). I highly reccomend this recipe!

These are a hit at my house, I have also made them on the grill.  I sprinkled some ranch dressing seasoning on the cream cheese before wrapping with bacon.  I recently tried the oscar mayer pre-cooked bacon and it really worked great, I won't go back to the other bacon.  These cooked up beautifully and so much less grease with the pre-cooked bacon.  My family requested them a bit spicier so I left a few of the seeds in them and that seemed to work.

This is so easy and delicious. I substituted neufchatel for cream cheese and  turkey bacon for bacon and got rave reviews. Less fatty without sacrificing taste.

I used a piping bag without the tip to pipe the room temperature cream cheese into the peppers. These turned out great! (the cooking time could be a bit longer.)

These are wonderful! I add some cheddar cheese and ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese and it gives them a little extra flavor.

These were very good, but my bacon didn't crisp up that much. I think next time I'll try adding some roasted garlic cloves to the cream cheese and broil the bacon for 30 second or so.

We tried these on a "Mexican" theme day party with friends, they went over so well so we have made them about 3 more times and this has been within the last 2 weeks. They are a big hit with us and the bacon is what really makes these great.

This was a great recipe, the whole family loved it and it was easy to make. We like things on the spicy side, so next time I will leave a bit more of the seeds and spine for more kick.
