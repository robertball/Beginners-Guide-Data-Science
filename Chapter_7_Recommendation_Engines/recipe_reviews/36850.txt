I used fusilli pasta, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, zucchini and a small eggplant. I grilled the eggplant (with oil, salt and pepper) until there were grill marks (but it was still not soggy). I added it to my veggies (which were sauteing). Then I added a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, most of the spices and the parmesan. I baked with with tons of crumbled feta... It was amazing! My tip for the eggplant is to cut it in big chunks so it's the highlight of the dish along with the feta.

Very very yummy. The cinnamon seemed like an odd ingredient to me until I tried it.. now I think it wouldn't have tasted as good without it.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. It was a little dry though. My daughters wouldn't touch it and they aren't always this picky.

My husband and I thought it was great! The kids weren't huge fans of the eggplant. I broiled it in the oven instead of grilling.

I'm reviewing this recipe as I'm stuffing myself with the pasta dish - i'm about to burst. I used leftover grilled eggplant and zucchini and also leftover fusili pasta. I baked it covered for 15 minutes and uncovered for 5 minutes. The baked pasta was delicious!

First time using eggplant and I really enjoyed it! Great flavor (even without the mint, which I didn't have)...but not saucy enough. I will add some tomato sauce next time...probably about 3/4 cup.
Thanks though!

Very plain. I was very disappointed. I thought that the eggplant would come thru stronger, but even tho i used 2 eggplants, no one would have ever guessed that it was a main ingredient. The feta made it have a very good taste, but even with extra sauce it was dry. I might make this again because i have nuthing else to do with farfalle pasta, but it is unlikely. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

Until i saw all the extra steps in the recipe's preparation i was going to rate this higher.  I find this recipe comparable to the way i have always had it by my italian aunties.

There was no eggplant at the grocery store (which was weird...) but I got zucchini instead and it worked out well. Really good recipe, thanks  :)

This dish was exceptional!  Would enjoy it with a mixture of grilled vegetables in it as well.

I really enjoyed this.  My BBQ ran out of propane half way through so I ended up broiling it in my oven.  Unfortunately I didn't cook it quite long enough.  However, the flavour of this dish was wonderful and I'll definitely be making it again.

This was just okay. It was quite dry, as mentioned in an earlier review. I ended up adding some spag sauce to help moisten it up and it was better. Still not WOW!

We added an extra cup of tomato sauce,  baked it covered for 15 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes.  Next time we'll add some extra eggplant and maybe some mushrooms,  olives,  or artichoke hearts.

I''ve made this twice, and it got rave reviews. (Would have used 5 stars, but I did make substitutions.) I used quinoa instead of the pasta to make it gluten free, and had to skip the grilling step on the eggplant and just sauteed it (along with zucchini and yellow squash--did all in nice chunky pieces since another reviewer said the eggplant, if cut small, doesn't come out being the star of the show.) Gorgonzola crumbles were on sale, so used those. Will make again and again. Thanks!
