Very nice little cake, except for one thing. It really lacked a rich flavor. It was very sweet with all the sugar and it supprised me that the carmel ends up on the bottom so I inverted it for serving. Next time I am going to add some nutmeg to the batter and maybe some alspice to give it some wow. Enjoyed it for breakfast the next morning warmed in the micro.

This was O.K. but it was pretty difficult to serve because the caramel got really hard.

Luckily I read the reviews before trying this, so I added extra cinnamon and some allspice, and  Hershey's cinnamon chips on top. We thought the cake was awesome, but it is much better warmed up than cold.

I found this recipe about one month ago and have made it 5 times since.  Everyone loves it.  I brought a double batch into my husbands work and they all fought over the last piece.  It is wonderful warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream

tasted okay. Carmel sauce had too much cinnamon and the cake lacked flavor. Personally i think it tasted best cold. Will probably not make again.

This was ok. The caramel gets too hard on the bottom. IT's also difficult to serve. It wasn't the greatest... it was just ok.
