I did not have oat bran on hand, I used wheat germ in it's place. I also folded in three packets of Truvia with the other ingredients and used pecans instead of walnuts. This is tasty though it seems to me like it's missing something. I think other reviewers might be on to something about using a little orange juice instead of milk. EDITED: I made this a second time and used orange juice instead of milk. That was exactly what it needed.

I forgot to write that you should also add about 1 T or orange juice to the muesli. It tastes excellent!

i had high hopes for this recipe because the reviews were so good but my husband and I could not eat it. My husband said it was like eating a lemon. I really like the idea but it was way to tart. If I ever get brave enough to try this again I will use vanilla yogurt instead of plain and drizzle with honey like the other reviewer suggested.

I love this recipe for breakfast.  I've been making it everyday for a week and a half.  I originally ate the Swiss Oatmeal at Corner Bakery and wanted to see if I could make it at home.  Corner Bakery's Swiss Oatmeal is fabulous!! This isn't AS good but is comparable and very healthy. The recipe is good as-is.  I only change it up when I have fresh fruit in the house.  Sometimes I chop up a peach, 1/2 banana, strawberries or blueberries versus the dry fruit.  This recipe keeps me full well into the afternoon. Highly recommended for a healthy, fulfilling breakfast.

This is the best quick breakfast around!  I've been making this same type of recipe for several years now, and heartily recommend everyone should try it.  The only difference between mine and this recipe is that I use dried blueberries and apricots, and slivered almonds, and I don't usually add milk. (I like it thick, but that's just me.) It's perfect for weekdays, since you make it the night before, and it's ready to go the next morning.  Everyone in my family loves it, and it's sooo healthy!

Very good idea of soaking oats in yogurt instead of milk. I used strawberry-flavored yogurt and added dried blueberries and assorted nuts. Healthy and yummy. Thanks =)

Really good. I was expecting to have to add sweetener but none was needed. Very creamy and filling. I added in dried blueberries and apples rather than the raisins and apricots. The fruit really adds a lot of flavor and sweetness. I also used home made 2% yogurt and 1% milk but the preparation method makes this creamy enough that it had a whole milk quality to it. I will make this often, especially since it's so convenient and quick to make.

3.5 stars, without changes. Five stars for health, without changes. :) I added the orange juice like the recipe submitter suggested, but it didn't take away the tang of the yogurt, so I added about 2 tsp. honey and it is perfect. As another reviewer suggested, vanilla yogurt would work well, but to keep the sugar content down a little, I would use half vanilla yogurt and half plain yogurt. This recipe works really well with any fruit, dried or fresh.

Yum, yum, yum! This was my first time trying muesli, and I am impressed. Tomorrow morning will be the fourth morning in a row I have muesli. I altered the recipe based on the grains, nuts, and fruit I have on hand. This is truly spectacular. I love the yogurt!

My rating is for the recipe as written, because it's a sound recipe that produces good results, but as a muesli lover, this recipe and I have some differences. The oats lend a milky richness to the liquid in which they're soaked; using milk actually makes this too rich for my tastes, and that's even before adding the yogurt. I go the traditional route instead: soak the oats and nuts (almonds for me, no cinnamon) in orange juice - even using water with a tablespoon of honey is delicious - and serve with fresh fruit and a dollop of yogurt. Dried fruit certainly adds to the convenience factor, but using fresh fruit instead REALLY makes this something special.

This is super easy.  I did not use oat bran, just 2/3 cup oats and 8oz of vanilla yogurt, with some cinnamon and raisins.  Next time, I may add a little vanilla or brown sugar.  I let it sit overnight, then added milk in the morning until I got the consistency I wanted, and topped with walnuts.  Very tasty and filling.

I've been making cold meusli like this for many years and find this recipe a nice variation with the apricots though personally didn't like the oat bran.  I usually use apples, pecans and regular raisins (and no oat bran) and drizzle honey over to taste.  Will make it both ways now.  Enjoy the freedom of this recipe -- and enjoy!

We make this ALL the time.  Any dried fruit works well, and it's good with or without the milk.  So great to have breakfast already made when you get up in the morning.  I also throw in a spoon of oat bran, wheat bran, and wheat germ, and sometimes sweeten with a bit of honey.  Great recipe; thanks for sharing it!

I have been looking for ways to take my protein powder, and got stuck putting it in oatmeal every morning. I added some to this recipe and am very impressed! I've never tried muesli, but will put it into my breakfast rotation for sure. This recipe was surprisingly sweet enough as is. I think another dash of cinnamon in the morning couldn't hurt, though.

I just recently went to Brooylyn, NY and gave meusli a try at a cafe. I immediatly fell in love with this breakfast.  When I came home I seached AR and found tried this one. I use whatever dried fruit I have on hand and add whatever fresh fruit I have on hand in the morning.  So good and is a better option for hot oatmeal here in the Phoenix summers!

What a yummy change for breakfast!  I now make these every so often the night before in tupperware, leave them in the fridge and they are perfect to just add the milk to in the morning.  Experiment with this recipe too...very yummy with different types of fruit, different types of yogurt, etc.  Lots of options for this one.  Thanks for the breakfast suggestion...it's nice to start the day off with a change.

As others have already stated, you can add whatever combination of fruits, or nuts or both. I use vanilla yogurt as I don't care for the plain but regardless, you can play with this to make it truly yours. Thank you Linda for such a great recipe!

If you use Greek yogurt like I did, you may need to use a bit more than the recipe calls for as it is pastier than regular yogurt.  My batch was REALLY thick!

This is a delicious and healthy way to start your day. I omitted the dried fruits and nuts and added fresh peaches instead, just a preference. I also added splenda.

Really really good! And filling.  I didn't have oat bran, so I threw in some flax seeds.  Skipped the milk and walnuts - topped with some sliced banana and honey.    Will definately make again and again!

This is very similar to my favorite breakfast diner's version. I did not include oat bran, raisins, or milk, and I added a little honey. Very good.

Boy I wanted to love this!  I took it out of the fridge this morning and it was ROCK HARD.  If I had chosen not to add liquid I don't think I could have stirred it.  I used an almond/coconut milk blend on mine.  The flavor was OK but it was so dense that it was difficult to finish.  I didn't have oat bran.  Could that have made a difference?  I used 2 Tbsp of ground flax instead.

I run marathons and this is my favorite race day breakfast. I mix up several containers of the dry ingredients and then just add the yogurt the night before.  And very flexible as well.  I also had  1/4 C ground flaxseed.

This was okay. The kids ate it, but I didn't like it very much. Maybe if I attuned my taste buds to better accept less sugar. I'll save this recipe for when I'm a bit older.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while now and this one is perfect!  Only made a couple of modifications - used dried cranberries instead of raisins and added about a teaspoon of slivered almonds along with the walnuts.  Delicious!

It's delicious, and as a matter of fact I'm eating it right now! I love raisins and dried apricots and stuff, so I've made lots of combinations. It's also good with dried bananas and sunflower seeds (only the inside ofcourse, not salty).

Good!  Works with any kind of fruit.  I usually use more yogurt/milk for thinner consistency.

Try the recipe with soy milk. It makes it sweeter and gives the cereal more flavor. I've posted my recipe of meusli. Thanks for your version.

I love this healthy breakfast! I used 1 cup of yogurt and 1/2 cup of oats and finely chopped prunes, and put it in refrigerator overnight. Then I added toasted nuts on top when I ate it. YUM!! I didn't add milk as mine was bit more "liquid-er" since I added more yogurt than what was in recipe.
