I love the "No bake granola bars" recipe on this site but I wanted to try a baked version. I picked this one because there's no added sugar oils or butter. It's pretty good I like how they're not as sweet and sticky after they're baked and don't have to be stored in the fridge. Definitely use GROUND flax seed though. I didn't have the oat bran wheat germ protein powder almonds or sunflower seeds but I used more ground flax and they turned out fine. Next time will try chocolate chips.:-)
