This was not good at all!! The salsa and grape jelly makes a really foul taste, no BBQ here! I hadn't put the meatballs in the slow cooker yet, so I put them in the oven for 15mins, then added to slow cooker with a jar of pasta sauce instead. I browned the sausage in a pan and added to slowcooker, cooked on HIGH for 60mins. I was really hoping to salvage this and make a meal, but NO! The meatballs were very DRY...I don't think it had anything to do with me popping them in the oven either. When I'm in a hurry I use a Parm Meatball recipe that you bake, and they always turn out great. I would advise to just skip this recipe all together.

Not good. Instead of using the jar of salsa, substitute it for bottle of Hunt's chili sauce, and mix with the grape jelly (don't use jam!). I make my meatballs differently, breadcrumbs, parmesan, parsley, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce and milk.
