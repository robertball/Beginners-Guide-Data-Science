This recipe is delicious~ I am wheat, gluten, and cow dairy sensitive so I made a few modifications.  1.  Substituted rice flour for AP 2.  Substituted 1 1/8 C coconut milk for cow milk 3.  Substituted 1/2 C applesauce for the butter 4.  Added 1/4 cup dried fruit (blueberries and cranberries) 5.  Subtstituted 1/4 C Agave nectar for the sugar I cooked it for 30 minutes and it came out perfect.  It retained the cakelike texture and was moist and absolutely scrumptious. Yum!

AMAZING. Simply AMAZING. Please note that I did not use blue cornmeal because I only had yellow on hand. ALSO I ran out of baking powder 1 tsp shy of 5 (didn't matter). AND (because capital letters tell you important things) I was also out of milk and had to substitute 1/2 c sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 c water instead (I went a light on the sugar to even it out). And the sifting 3 times, melting the butter in the oven in the dish and then pouring it in seemed so strange to me. But I did as instructed anyhow. And the result was.... The bread cooked for 30 minutes, came out perfect. It's perfection. Clearly with all the substitutions I had to make, and it still tastes wonderful, you just can't screw this bread up. This is my permanent recipe now. I will never go back.

This recipe is fantastic! The blue cornmeal definitely adds a subtle, natural sweetness to the bread. The ingredients, proportions, and cooking directions are seamless- the cornbread turned out amazing. This recipe has since become my permanent cornbread recipe.

Fantastic! I used gluten free yellow cornmeal and gluten free AP Blend to make this gluten free. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Only adding a splash more milk to compensate for the gluten free flour. Great!

I just took this out of the oven and I could eat the whole thing!  Not too sweet like other cornbreads.  I have never felt the need to rate a recipe, but this one is too good!

Fantastic recipe. I made two batches and decreased the sugar in the second batch by 1/4 and enjoyed it a bit more. Otherwise very good with gumbo.

Simply delicious.  I've made it three times and the cornbread was excellent each time.  I did have problems pouring the butter out of the baking dish into the cornbread mixture, but was more careful the next time.

Living in Central Texas, this blue corn cornbread recipe really appeals to me.  It will go well with a Southwest soup.

Fantastic recipe!! My family loved this cornbread. Perfect texture---not too dense, not too soft. Our local organic market carries Arrowhead Mills blue cornmeal, so I didn't have to order it by mail. My son, who didn't think that there was actually any "naturally-blue food"  in existence, was delighted! I didn't have a 9-inch baking pan, so I used an 8-inch pan and made a jumbo muffin with the extra batter. I'm tossing all my other cornbread recipes---this is now #1!

I made these because I bought some Bob's Red Mill Blue Cornmeal and then didn't know what to do with it.  I found this recipe and gave it a whirl.  This had just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Wonderful!

Moist, fluffy, and again moist this was what I was looking for in a corn bread.  Only thing I substituted was a can of evaporated milk because I didn't have any fresh milk.

This cornbread, made with non GMO organic cornmeal is the best cornbread ever.  The bread would complement any dish from vegan chili to beans and rice to Thanksgiving dinner.  Yummmm.

So yummy! I mixed the dry ingredients but didn't sift, still turned out great. I didn't have butter so I used approx 3/8 cup canola oil.

The 5 teaspoons of baking soda made it inedible.....way too much.   I would try it again but only use 2 at most.

Used Vegan butter and coconut milk with a splash of vinegar to make the milk ‘buttermilk’ and doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. 35 minutes on convection. It turned out so good! My husband and son loved it. I only sifted once due to laziness and it still came out delicious.

Followed the recipe and it was dry. I did not allow the eggs to come up to room temp so that may make a difference.

Made it with coconut flour. needed double to all the wet to keep it from clumping up. the Blue Cornmeal flavor was kinda gone. More coconut but stull good. Find a better egg and milk sub and everyone can eat.

I have made this recipe a couple of times (I recently fell in love with blue cornmeal) and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times.  Made it without any modifications first.  Second time, as it is just my husband and I, I halved the recipe.  I made one slight modification which was to add a tablespoon of grated fresh onion.  Then I baked it in a small (6 muffin) muffin tin.  Reduced baking time to about 15 minutes and they were delicious.  Great recipe!!  Thanks!

OMG we will NEVER have cornbread any other way again.  This cornbread is exactly what it says it is.  We did take the advise of some others and replaced the 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup applesauce and it is AMAZING!

Very beautiful and blue! To make it vegan, simply replace the egg with flax eggs (mix 1 tbsp. ground flax with 2-3 tbs. water per egg replaced), the butter with oil, and the milk with coconut/almond milk. I omitted the baking powder on accident and loved the dense cake-like result!! will definitely be making this recipe again!!

Tastes delicious. I added 8oz of frozen blueberries and it came out almost like blueberry muffin bread. The original photo is definitely yellow cornbread with blue food coloring; blue cornmeal will come out more of a blue-grey.

this was excellent!  Best cornbread I have ever made.  I used soy milk. It was light and fluffy and raised beautifully.  The blue color was great with chili.

This bread came out so light and fluffy. Such a nice change from the regularly dense corn bread of the norm. However, I used demerara sugar in stead of white sugar and came out super delicious. Thanks.

the cornbread does not come out exactly like in the picture, which looks like food coloring was added. Blue cornmeal does not turn that color. more like a brownish color. Mine didnt seem sweet sweet but i am assuming thats how cornbread should taste...? I may add more sugar the next time.
