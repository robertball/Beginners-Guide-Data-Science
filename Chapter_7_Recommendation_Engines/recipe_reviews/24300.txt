This was very easy to make and tasted great too.  I didn't have dates so I used dried cranberries instead and it worked well.  I agree with the other reviewer that it only yields 2 dozen (mine were about 1-inch).  It isn't much like a traditional cookie in consistency, instead it feels more like a no-bake cookie.  Try it out if you need a dairy-free treat!

I will admit that I am a follower when I am trying new recipes.  This is the first time I have tried one that had no ratings, but these turned out great.  I was a little suspect about them and how they would turn out.  They weren't as hard to roll as I thought and they really stuck together as they cooled.  I have no idea how the orginal recipe yielded five dozen...I got maybe two dozen; I'm sure I made them too big!  They smelled heavenly in the oven and my four year old loved them.  Thanks!

My family has made casserole cookies since forever. Now that so many family & friends are gluten-free, this makes a great way to make something special for the holidays.

Although  I did not get 60 cookies, I am so glad to find a milk and gluten free desert that tastes great

I made these cookies for a Christmas cookie exchange and doubled the recipe to have enough. it doubles very easily.
 I did make a few changes, just to suit my taste. I used pecans instead of walnuts, added the zest of one orange and dusted them with powdered sugar instead of rolling in granulated sugar. they are very soft, more like a candy than a cookie. but really delicious.

This brings me back to my childhood. My mother made cookies similar to these, except she would cook the dates on the stove with sugar and pecans (or walnuts) then she would fold in rice krispies, and then roll them into balls, and then roll them over coconut flakes. Thanks for reminding me! :)

My kids fell in love with this recipe. It was so easy to make. I have never had dates before but this recipe made me go out and buy more. Thanks so much for sharing we will be keeping this recipe for years to come.

Easy and tasty. My husband finished them in two days. Making these for a cookie exchange. Will need to make extra for home.
I only wish I knew if I can freeze these cookies.
