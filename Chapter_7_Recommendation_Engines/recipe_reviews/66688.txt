Mmmmm - my husband and I really enjoyed this.  We followed the recipe exactly with exception of adding a bit of table cream at the end to finish it off (we also used double chocolate truffle hot chocolate mix).  This was delicious and will become a regular occurrence in our house.

I didn't have hot cocoa mix (I haven't made my homemade mix yet this year) so I used my homemade sugar free chocolate syrup to make a chocolate-y cocoa. Pretty good, though next time I'll skip the Kahlua and double the peppermint schnapps.

This was a great drink for our chilly weather. The first time I made it as written with regular hot chocolate (which I usually don't have) and it was great. I have a whole box of Candy Cane Cocoa (which is what I usually keep around or mint cocoa) so I figured that would be perfect for this. I did about 1/2 a shot of the peppermint schnapps, since the cocoa was already minty and 1 1/2 oz of Kahlua and it was GREAT! I couldn't taste the liquor in it at all! This is going to be a regular winter drink for me! Thanks!

Delicious!  I used chocolate almond milk with some extra hershey's syrup (I'm lactose intolerant).  The coffee liqueur helps cut down on the sweetness of the peppermint and the cocoa.  Fabulous!  Thanks!
