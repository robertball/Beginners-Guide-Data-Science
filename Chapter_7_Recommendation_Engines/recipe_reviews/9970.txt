Aside from the fact that these cookies were difficult to shape (no fault of the recipe), they are fantastic - they taste great and look good. A few tips: 1. Cut a round mold into the top of a plastic container, then spread the batter with a long metal spreader; this will give the cookies a smoother surface and make the shaping easier because the cookies will cook more evenly. 2. I cut down on the amount of sugar by almost half a cup - it made them better for my taste buds but didn't adversely affect the baking process. 3. Wear a pair of thin non-wool gloves (you don't want little fibres getting all over your cookies) when shaping the cookies - they are hot!

Wonderful flavor and texture to the cookies.  Like any cookie in this genre, they are best made on low humidity days. When I was in pastry classes I picked up a few tips for shaped cookies.

1.  Cotton gloves protect the fingers from burns
2.  Place the cookie sheet on a thick towel once removed from the oven.  It helps retain a bit of heat.
3.  I was really slow in my forming so my teacher had me work directly from the oven.  That way the resting cookies are kept hot while you work the other one.  You have to be very careful not to bang appendages and only have the 1 rack in the oven to minimize the chance of burning arms, etc.

I made 200 fortune cookies as wedding favors.  Everybody loved them.  They were easy to make and went fast.

I loved this recipe!  It is a MUST to have the rack in the oven level, as the dough is extrememly thin and will "run".  I also put the slips of paper in as I shaped them hot from the oven - no problem.  Instead of fortunes, I put my favorite memories with my boyfriend and gave them to him for Valentine's Day.  He loved them!

Don't underbake the cookies or they will tear during shaping.  To shape: Wear cotton gloves. Using a wide spatula, remove one cookie at a time from the oven and flip into your gloved hand. Place and hold one fortune paper in the center of the cookie and quickly fold the cookie in half. Grasp the ends of the cookie and draw it gently down over the edge of the straight-sided pan or bowl to get that "fortune-cookie" curve. (The slit in the cookie will be facing up as you shape the cookie over the pan.) Place the cookie, ends down, in one of the muffin pan cups to cool. This will help them hold their shape while cooling.  If the cookie hardens too fast, return it to the oven for about 1 minute to make it more bendable. Repeat for remaining batter, using a cold, well-greased baking sheet for each batch.

It was reallie kewl. It came out perfect. Then I had and idea after making so many after 2 months. I tried them in different colors! It was so kewl! I used foodcoloring! I shared some with mi 5th grade class and it was such a success!!! It was so fun getting all the compliments! And you should try to put colors too! try different colors each time you wanna bake. To make them all mostly folded, just put like 1-6 at a time. That's what I did. And when I do the colors, fill a little container with little batter, then put food coloring. Mix well. All of the above. I hope you love muah idea!!! I'm outie!!!

Great!  After they come out of the oven you can flip a glass over with a 2" bottom, lay the hot cookie over the glass and you will come up with a cute little "tulip" bowl that you can serve ice cream or sorbet in!  Sweet!

I gave this 3 stars because it does have a very good flavor, but I was unable to fold the cookie into the fortune cookie shape. It was incredibly frustrating because I had tried 3 other recipes for fortune cookies and had the same problem. I was excited to see others here give this a great review so I was very optimistic.
I tried so many different things to get these cookies to "fold", i.e., adjusting my oven temp from 300 to 400, taking the cookies out sooner, letting them bake longer, adding more dough to the circles, using less dough, after trying for two days, I gave up.
Can anyone here post how they were able to shape these cookies without them breaking or cracking? They ALWAYS cracked and drove me insane.

***For shaping***  I used a big Crayola marker to help me for the first fold, press, wait a few seconds and remove marker, and bring corners in.  Easy!  As one user suggested, place cookie in a muffin tin for cooling to keep it's shape.  Very yummy too.  I used this for a girls slumber party.  Each girl wrote a nice message and exchanged the cookies.  Nice recipe.

They tasted really good, but I couldn't get them to turn out right.  They lost their shape and either burned quickly or wouldn't harden.  After messing with them for an hour I gave up.  I'm not sure where I went wrong.  Any suggestions?

I felt that the recipe tasted very good for a fortune cookie.  On the other hand, it was very discouraging for me to fold the cookie the correct way.  It would cool to quickly and I wouldn't have enough time to fold it.  Overall, fortune cookies are extremely difficult to make, and make well.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because the cookies turned out so well...they tasted yummy. However, I didn't have much luck threading the fortunes thru after baking, or during the folding process.  They were quite a bit of work, but I expected that.  I would make them again, I think practice would make perfect with this recipe.

This recipe was terrific, but I have one suggestion for easier cookie manipulation.  Instead of using a greased cookie sheet, use parchment paper OR that wonderful new "Release" stuff (aluminum foil).  Once out of the oven, slide the cookie with paper off the cookie sheet, and then you can use pot holders to handle it.

I made very large cookies and manipulated them into bowl shapes, rather than cookie shapes.  A very elegant way to serve dessert (white chocolate mousse, in my case).  The taste is great, too.

These were terrific and versatile. The taste, while not identical to a commercial fortune cookie, was perfect for serving solo.  I also served them as an accompaniment to pineapple sorbet and peach-orange sorbet.  I tried cooking them on parchment and flipped the paper and cooked cookie onto the bottom of custard cups to make dessert bowls for sorbets, but the parchment caused wrinkles so the "bowls" ended up with cracks and the cookies didn't harden the way they did when baked directly on the sheet.  Baking directly on the sheet makes a big difference both in the texture and the consistency after cooling. I've also rolled them into tubes and tucked one in with each scoop of sorbet which made for a great, tasty presentation.  They would also be good rolled in tubes with the ends dipped in chocolate for an elegant finish to a meal with coffee or hot tea.  Haven't shaped the fortune cookies yet but will definately continue using this recipe!  Thanks Sherry!

I have made fortune cookies before, and they always taste better than those you get in the restaurant.  This recipe was very good.  Since I didn't have cream on hand, I substituted buttermilk with no adverse effect on the flavor.  I found it easier to laminate the fortunes (or cover them with clear contact) and then wrap them inside the cookies rather than trying to thread them through afterward.  It also helps to have an empty egg carton available to hold the fortunes after folding so they don't lose their shape while cooling.

I made these for my son's kindergarten class for international week & put kid jokes inside.  They were such a big hit that I decided to also make them for teacher appreciation with an encouraging quote for the teachers.  Yes, it is time-consuming & yes it will take you 1-3 cookies to figure it how to get the cookie just right.  That said - This is a great recipe.  My husband said they were the best fortune cookies he had ever eaten.  I completely agree with previous reviewers about using cotton gloves to shape the cookies.  I suggest reading some previous reviews for other helpful hints.  I used the 'draping the cookie over a bowl' to maintain the bend in the cookie & found it very useful.  One last thing - i suggest putting the paper in while you fold the cookie.  The other way is just too frustrating.

These were fun to make and great! I made a few too thick and they were like actual cookie consistency... fat and fluffy. You have to make them very thin.  Also, some were soft in the middle and well done on the edge.... not sure how to fix this. Overall, they were great!  A keeper.

Requires experience to handle, but that's true of all fortune cookie recipes. 

Used half almond & half orange extracts.

Trim for smooth edges with kitchen shears before cool.

These are not easy. I always say I'm not going to do it again, but I do. I can't figure out how to thread the fortune through after it's cool, so I add them before I fold. The cookie batter gets stuck on the fortune, but I hope people will get over it.
Of course the charm is in the fortune itself. I've used the Monday's Child poem and baby quotes for baby showers, and Spanish quotes with the translation on the back for a bilingual friend's BDay.

I have made fortune cookies in the past, no problem, but don't have the recipe I used.

My oven got too hot for 400 so i placed it on 350, but the cookies were great.  I made them for New Years Eve.  Very good taste.  Simple to make, although time consuming.

My first batch I made very thin and pulled out 1 minute before time was up - afraid of burning.  I couldn't get them shaped in time.  But they taste delish!  The second batch I made slightly thicker and baked for 8 min at 375.  They formed nicely but probably won't be crispy.  Got to get the third batch now...Great recipe.  Definitely use the tip to place the cookies in a muffin tin to hold their shape.  You will soon get into a rhythm when doing these.

Took me about 15 cookies to get the hang of folding them, but then they turned out great (and the broken scraps provided good snacks for my household to keep them away from the folded ones). I found I folded slowly and it was easier to do batches of 3 cookies at once, rotating on two pans.

The flavor was good but I felt their was to much almond extract. The shape was very hard to make and after two hours of labor, only a handful of good fortune cookies were produced. The baking of the fortune cookies was also very exhausting and slow. Overall I would not recommend or attempt recipe ever again.

I will make it again. But the one bad thing about it is when you have to fold the cookies to their shape, you burn your hands because the cookies are so hot.

My family and I really liked the flavor and while they may not be simple to shape, it is doable. I used to have a great fortune cookie stovetop recipe and tried making these on the stove- nope! They turn out like pancakes. So my tips would be that you need a very hot oven, make sure your baking sheet has some oil or pam because these things are so thin, they will STICK. Also, keep a close eye while baking because they can turn from just done to dark brown/black in a second. When smoothing in the pan before baking, make sure they are almost see-through thin and try to make them as perfectly round as possible and that will help you when shaping the cookie after baking. My reason for not giving 5 stars is the color. They never turn out a nice, even golden color. They are either dark brown OR pale in the center w/ dark brown  edges. I know ovens can be to blame, but most any other recipe turns out perfectly in mine, so I wanna say something is lacking in the original recipe. It is a tricky recipe, mostly the shaping part. And yes, work with maximum 3 at a time because they set fast. If the cookies are coming out bad enough to be a Pinterest Fail, I recommend rolling them up like little taquitos, they can still hold the fortune paper well and still look nice.

I made these for my son's 4th grade Mandarin class to celebrate Chinese New Year.  Everyone loved them. The taste is really good, though they got super crispy the next day.  Could be due to how I stored them though.  I learned quickly how to shape them and made three at a time.  Quick and easy, and I'd make them again.
