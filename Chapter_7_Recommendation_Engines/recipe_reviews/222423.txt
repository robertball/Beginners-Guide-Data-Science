I didn’t want to make a full 9x13 pan of this dessert so I halved the amount and baked it in a 8” round cake pan.  I don’t have a scale so I simply generously covered the bottom of the cake pan with rhubarb that I had sliced ½ inch thick, resulting in 2 cups of chopped rhubarb.  In addition, only ½ cup of sugar was needed to coat the rhubarb.  The baking time for me was 45 minutes.  What I loved about this dessert was how pretty the cake appeared when inverted.  The top looked like little jewels.  The cake is delicious on its own, but I loved it served with whipped cream.

i followed one reviewers note and made it in a pie pan with a small reduction in ingredients I Loved it tasted to me just like my Grandmother's rice pudding maybe because I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg it was yummy I served it warm.

I very carefully weighed out 4pounds of rhubarb and that measured out to 12 cups of rhubarb! I was pretty sure that this was too much fruit so divided it in half ( I had already spent too much time going from neighbour to neighbour to scrounge fruit) and doubled the batter and made 2 cakes out of it. Cake was good but maybe after all the effort I couldn't help but be let down. I wish someone else would measure out 4 pounds. The reviewer who covered an 8" cake pan didn't come close. I probably won't make this again.
