yum yum yum!!!!! this pie is so refreshing!!! i love the fact that it wasn't a jelly type glaze, rather just more peaches..(pureed) i think this pie beats marie calendar's fresh peach pie! i also think that substituting strawberries would also be very nice. i did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and in my opinion this dessert did not lack sweetness.i also recommend adding a tablespoon or so of vanilla and the same of cinnamon.  very very good!!!

I had this once as a small child  - from my grandmothers neighbor - and have been trying to re-create since. No dice!

This is EXCELLENT. Add vanilla for the super sweet tooth!

Very fresh tasting & very easy.  I added 1 t vanilla and 2 t cinnamon - total comfort food.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This stuff didn't last long at my house.

My pie never got firm, despite double checking the ingredients, boiling the cooked portion an extra 5 minutes and chilling overnight.  It tasted good, but was more like "Peach Soup in a Crust" than pie.  Perhaps my peaches were extra juicy -  a word to the wise if you too get really juicy peaches.

I think the ripeness of the peaches are key. Mine were ripe, but hard; making the pie very unappealing. No matter how long i pureed, there was still very small chunks of peaches. Try it at home before you plan to take it anywhere.

I followed the exact instructions and it came out perfect! Although if i didn't make it with freshly picked peaches it wouldn't have had that same amazing taste. It was a hot day and a cool treat. My guests loved the flavorand asked for the recipe! Will be making this again soon!

August 21, 2010 Wonderful pie! Substituted 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for nutmeg and used finely chopped peaches in place of pureed peaches!  It's a keeper!!
