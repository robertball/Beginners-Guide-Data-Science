Yum!!  I made the dressing exactly as written but improvised on the vegetables. I suggest adjusting method a bit though. I would mix half the dressing with the noodles. Then, I would toss the vegetables with the other half of the dressing. As written, the noodles soak up the dressing and it's difficult to get an evenly distributed salad. I think the flavor is wonderful and I don't like orange.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy. I think I used a little too much miso because it was a bit salty. I will definitely make it again, maybe today.
