These muffins were very yummy and moist, and surprisingly fat free. Many people said their muffins came out a little dry so I added an extra banana and 1/4 cup of skim milk. Also, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white and added some cinnamon and vanilla. I replaced white sugar with brown sugar and I found that 3/4 cups of sugar was too sweet for my taste so I would reduce it to 1/2 cup next time. Overall, the muffins were delicious and I would definitely make them again.

I've made banana muffins many times, and I must say that these are the ultimate!  They were moist and delicious!  I added a few more bananas and had to cook them for a little longer, but it was worth the wait!  I was impressed by the way they puffed up so well!  I also made muffin tops with this recipe, simply by plopping the dough in cirles on a baking sheet!  Scrumptious!

I was so impressed that there is no oil or margarine in these!  They are really good.  I substituted 1/2 C oats and 1/2 C whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour.

Pretty good muffin, but the batter was very thick and I thought it needed modifying. Which, I did ;) Yielded 12 muffins.

My modifications:

4 bananas instead of 3
added 1/4 c ff milk to thin the batter
3 egg whites instead of whole eggs
splenda instead of sugar

For the flour, I went ahead and used 1 c white, 1 c whole wheat, because I usually do that, but it does give a heavier flavor.

I also added some nutmeg, and when the muffins were prepped in the tin I sprinkled a bit of additional splenda with some cinammon or nutmeg over the tops.

I found these muffins to be a little dry, but very tasty.  Next time I would add some unsweetened applesauce or maybe an additional banana.  I also added some vanilla and cinnamon to mine, but I'd probably go with a dash of nutmeg next time instead.

I am glad that I tried these muffins. While they are a bit chewy due to the lack of oil, the trade off is worth it. Knowing that they are low fat makes you feel better about eating them. I am tired of oil and sugar saturated muffins, so these are great. I added half a teaspoon of cinnamon and used four bananas because that is what I had, also added three eggs by mistake so that shows you they are fool proof.

They tasted quite good, especially because they were fat-free. They were easy to make, but the texture of the muffins turned out to be different from ordinary muffins. I suggest to add 1/2~1 more banana in chunks to make the muffins more moist and improve the texture.

Was it me? I must of done something wrong. My muffins came out dry and chewy even though I followed the recipe to a T . I'll give this another try again, maybe it was just one of them days for me.

I love this recipe! It's a good foundation to make great and light banana muffins. It *DOES* need applesauce for moisture though! And even if you do not enough bananas? you can just add more apple sauce! (3.5 oz. more instead of one banana) Want it with a richer flavor? Add cinnamon and vanilla! The muffins are great and you won't feel too bad giving it to your family because you know they have no fat. Just make sure the bananas are overripe (if they are almost all black it's better) and just mash them with a fork (it's important to not over beat!) just mix it all with a fork to incorporate all the ingredients. I use this recipe all the time!

This recipe is SOOOOO easy!  I did make a few adaptions ... I used whole wheat flour and 5 small bananas. As other reviewers, I added 1 tsp. each cinnamon and vanilla and 1/4 C skim milk. They are MOIST and YUMMY!  My partner ate 4 muffins before they had even cooled! Will make again and again.

Delicious!  We had no butter and a lot of over-ripe bananas, so this recipe fit the bill.    I doubled the recipe - two egg whites and two whole eggs, one extra banana, one tsp ea. baking powder and baking soda.  Poured most of the dough into an 8x8 pyrex sprayed w/cooking spray.  The rest was put in 4 custard cups sprayed w/cooking spray to  make oversized muffins.    Everyone in the family agreed these are delicious and very filling!

This was a great recipe but I did tweak it based on previous suggestions and added 4 oz of cinammon appleasauce, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. I noticed that when the muffins were warm, they stuck to the paper wrapper but when they were completely cooled, this wasn't an issue. I also topped each muffin with a little bit of brown sugar. they taste GREAT!

These muffins are excellent! I did add an extra banana and 1/4 cup of skim milk as others had suggested. I also used walnuts and added some on top prior to putting them in the oven, which made for an excellent appearance. They did take close to 30 minutes to cook though. I will make these again!

these were great! one thing I did that really helped moisten them up was to substitute 1/2 cup of yogurt for the two eggs. The substitution made them really moist, fluffy and also really low in fat =)

Not bad, but came out a little dry. Next time I will add apple sauce like other reviews suggest. I found myself warming these up and adding a little butter (MELT IN YOUR MOUTH YUMMY) but it completely ruined the whole point of the butter free recipe!

Very good lightened version of banana muffins.  I followed the advice of others and added 4 oz applesauce, 2 bananas, 1 tsp vanilla and cinnamon, and used 1/4 c each white and brown sugar.  I used 2 whole eggs and white flour.  This made six extra large muffins.  Next time I will add chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe!

hey all, this isnt the first time i've made these but tonight i forgot to add what i thought was an esential ingredient : the eggs! and guess what - i still cant understand how these still actually rose and turned out great! lol. i also replaced about 3/4 cup of the flour with unsweetened cocoa powder and threw in some choc chips for good measure. will definately make them this way again, especially the no eggs bit. am curious to see if it was just a one time stoke of baking luck or if the recipe can really do without the eggs.

Small changes, otherwise, a great recipe...bottom line, these were so yummy! My Mom-in-Law taught me the applesauce vs oil trick, but I also added 1 tsp baking powder, which makes them rise a little more, creating a lighter muffin.
My southern roots, however, couldn't resist melted butter & brown sugar with dry oats for the topping. I put just a tsp on top and I get rave reviews from our friends...always a hit!

I don't know how fair it is for me to rate this recipe because I did change quite a bit, so I just want to make that disclaimer.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose, cut back to 1/2 teaspoon of salt and added an additional 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon just because I like cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the same reason.  The flavor is wonderful, the calorie count is the best thing about them and I do agree with other reviewers that they stick to the muffin papers, so I used some papers and some of the aluminum liners, they come out perfect with the aluminum liners so use those or just spray your muffin tin with no papers.  With the added applesauce I did not think the muffins were dry at all.

I was a little unsure about these because the batter seemed really thick, but I was pleasantly surprised!  These were very delicious and easy, and I was glad there was no oil!  :) Thanks for a great recipe!

I really like this recipe!!! Its way heavy on flavor and not so much on fat, I used HEATHERALAPEACH recipe remix and the sticking to papers made me sad cause I hate wasting goodness, I consulted my mother and she advised me that since the muffin was so dense, use a foil wrapper and that will help with the sticking... SO the next round I will be doing just that!!!

very tasty. I used brown sugar (1/2cup) instead of white and prior to baking topped with brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers. Added an extra banana, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Great quick breakfast for the kidlets.  with the changes it still made 10 muffins

This was delicious! I made the adjustments others recommended: I added an extra banana, cinnamon, applesauce, and vanilla. These were super banana flavored. I also substituted glueten free all purpose flour for the regular. AWESOME!

AWESOME with some tweaks....
I used whole wheat flour and added 3 generous TBSP of ground flaxseed, substituted 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white, added 2 single serving cups of unsweetened blueberry applesauce, used 5 small bananas, added cinnamon and chopped up some fresh strawberries that I had on hand.....YUM!!! Super moist and full of goodness!

I made these muffins using a few others suggestions.. the applesauce made them extra moist! Also instead of brown sugar (I was out) I used just a dab of powdered sugar.. They turned out fantastic. The pan I used made 6 large muffins and they were all gone in a matter of a few hours! Thanks for the great recipie I will definitely make these again!!

Definitely add more bananas. Otherwise, this recipe is pretty good for something that has no oil.

This muffin is a bit dry, even after adding skim milk.  The flavor is also a bit off - I added an extra banana, vanilla and choc chips as some reviewers suggested, but I can tell it is low-fat.  Probably will not make again.

FANTASTIC. After reading reviews added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup of walnuts, used 4 bananas that were not ripe, wholewheat flour and brown sugar in the measurements in recipe, baked for 20 mins. So moist and delicious, couldn't believe something so simple could taste so good and that I actually made it!!! Thank you for submitting this recipe. I will make it regularly, Thank you also other reviewers.

These were alright, following other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1 extra banana, and 1 extra egg (I didn't have any applesauce). They turned out fine, a lighter muffin, although they did stick to the paper a bit, I was still able to remove papers without difficulty/ripping. I was just disappointed in the lack of flavor. Don't get me wrong- it tasted like bananas, I guess after trying this recipe I've learned that in baked goods, I prefer to couple bananas with complimentary spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. From now on when I want banana muffins, I'll just take my favorite banana bread recipe and divide it into a muffin pan- it turns out great & the flavor is the comforting, delicious taste I anticipate.

I didn't care for these muffins. Mine were very dry and they stuck to the muffin papers. I won't try to make these again. Very plain.

These muffins are quite tasty. Kids loved them! I did add about 1/2 cup of yogurt (strawb/banana is what I had on hand), extra banana and some cinnamon. Not as light and airy as I would like but still great!

These are fantastic! I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup apple sauce, another banana, and 1 tsp vanilla. Will probably try some other variations as well. Easy to make. This is marked as a favourite now.

Much better than I expected!  I added a little cinnamon and vanilla, but other than that I followed the recipe.  The muffin is slightly denser than other banana bread recipes that I have, but considering this has 0 fat it is pretty impressive!

I had to scale the amount back as I only had 2 bananas.  I also added some 1% milk (maybe 2 T) and light sour cream (also 2 T), which added moisture.   Sprinkled some chopped nuts on top during the last half of baking.

They just came out of the oven!  I added a 1/4c of unsweetened apple sauce, used Splenda and Egg Beaters instead of sugar and eggs.  Added a splash of vanilla and cinnamon. The calorie savings from the Splenda and Egg Beaters allowed me to throw in a 1/4 of nuts :)

I made these yesterday. I made a double batch. I used 4 bananas per batch, unsweetened apple sauce, cinnimon and vanilla like HEATHERALAPEACH did. They were good but a little on the chewy side.

These are excellent considering that they are fat-free.  They baked up nicely, rose perfectly in the muffin pan and yielded 12 good sized muffins.  Next time I might try a little whole wheat flour instead of all white.

I really liked these muffins.  They tasted great and had a nice texture to them.  I did make a few changes to the recipe though... I used 4 bananas mashed and added 4 ounces of unsweetened applesauce.  I also used one whole egg and one egg white instead of the 2 called for.  I used 1/4 c. sugar and 1/2 c. splenda.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla and 3 TBL. benefiber.  I also used 1 c. ap flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour.  I didn't bake them in muffin cups either.  I just sprayed the tins with a little pam.  They baked up nicely.  I got 12 nice sided muffins from this recipe.  I topped each with a little brown sugar sprinkled on top to add a little crunch.  Very good.

I thought this was one of the better low-fat muffin recipes I have tried.  Next time I make these muffins I will add another 1/2 of a banana.  I had to add a little skim milk to thin the batter the first time.  I also substituted sweet-n-low for sugar and they turned out great.

I love these! i made them even more healthy by using half whole wheat flour instead of all white flour.  and also i noticed that the other reviewer had said that they could taste the eggs in them, so i added one egg and 3 tbsp of applesauce instead of the two eggs.  and i added the walnuts too. so the only thing that is bad is all the sugar.  i will have to try even more stuff with these next time.  =) these are excellent! thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good for a close to fat free muffin. I used white whole wheat flour and also added 1 cup of apple sauce to the batter. I topped it with an oat-crumble topping. Will make these again.

Great recipe!  I used 4 bananas and folded in about a 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Took about 25 minutes to bake, but texture is great and taste is even better!  Thanks for sharing!

These muffins are really good, they tend to be a bit chewy as they contain no fat, but a great muffin all the same. I did as others suggested and added a snack size container of applesauce as well as an extra banana along with vanilla and cinnamon. I sprinkled the tops with brown sugar and only added 1/2 cup sugar to the recipe and they are sweet enough. A great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I used 4 bananas too and 1/4 cup of applesauce only 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamin and vanilla, little br. sugar on top. Also used Do You Care going green paper muffin cups and nothing stuck...they were perfect moist and very tasty.

My kids love these muffins but add the cinnamon and vanilla for extra flavor. And use extra bananas as well as the applesauce. They will stick to the papers. Just spray(grease) the muffin tin and they will come out.

I liked this recipe because it had simple ingredients. I made half because I only had 2 bananas. I also used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and added a dash of nutmeg. It was so thick I couldn't even stir in all the flour, so I added almost 1/2 cup of milk to get it to the right consistency. I used a greased muffin pan (no wasteful paper liners) and cooked for 18 minutes-it made 6 large muffins and they popped right out! The taste was good, but for some reason they had a strange smell...maybe it was the nutmeg. I will definitely make this again!

These were really good and really tasty!  I followed other reviewrs' suggestions and added in applesauce and mine weren't dry at all.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 brown sugar.  You could cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and tye would still be as good.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

I made the recipe as written but divided it into 24 mini muffins and baked for 10-12 minutes. Perfectly moist and delicious!

I really liked this recipe. Very quick, easy and delicious. Based on the reviews, I made the following changes: 1)Replaced white sugar for brown sugar; 2) added 4 oz of apple sauce; 3)added tsp vanilla extract; 4) added 2 tsp cinnamon; 5) added 1 banana; 6) added brown sugar as a topping. Will definetely make it again... many times!!!

Kiddos loved these so much, they were picking off the bits that stuck to the muffin wrapper!  : )  I followed most of the recommended changes:  used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, decreased sugar to 1/2 a cup (and used brown sugar instead of white), used four bananas, added in a 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe and suggested changes.

We really loved these!  I was looking for something quick and easy to do with some over-ripe bananas, and these were perfect.  I had 4 bananas, so I used them all - they tasted delicious, with no trace of an 'egg' flavour at all.  The recipe made 12 muffins.

These turned out pretty good! As others said, the texture is a little on the chewy side and stick pretty badly to the paper, but given that they're almost fat free I'd say that's all right! They taste great! I followed others advice and added about 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup applesauce, cinnamon and vanilla. Next time I'll add some ground flax for that nutty flavor and fiber. They're dense and hearty and taste great. Good choice for more health-conscious bakers!

I had 1.5 REALLY ripe bananas and didn't know what to do with them until I found this recipe. I halved it and ended up with 9 small muffins (actually, they were the standard size that muffins used to be...).
I used silicone muffin cups and they came out with ease. The muffins were a bit chewy but had a good flavor.

OMG!!  These were awesome!!  I can't believe they were fat free.  I only had 2 large bananas so I added a small 4 oz cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  I also added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  The only 'problem' I had was that the muffin stuck to the paper liners.  I had to scrape it off and eat it because I could not waste that goodness.

Perfect! Will use as my standard banana muffin recipe. Took the advice of others and used 4 smaller bananas, 1 tsp of vanilla, some cinnamon, and 1/4 c milk. I didn't cut back on sugar and I think it was perfect.  LOVE not having to have oil or butter on hand to bake something fabulous!

I've made this recipe several times now and made a few adjustments each time.  I think I finally have it down to just where I (and my kids!) think the muffins are perfect!  I use brown sugar instead of white, 4 bananas, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and a few T of my homemade applesauce.  YUM!  They come out great and it's nice to know that they are a quick, healthy snack for the kids!

These were my first banana muffins to make...and these are sooo goood!!  I had to eat one right after I took them out of the oven because they smelled HEAVENLY!! I did make a couple changes tho, I used whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup sugar and added lots of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also I made a topping out of crushed peanut butter granola bars by crushing them in a sturdy zipbloc bag with a rolling pin and sprinkling it all over the tops of each muffin before popping them in the oven.  The muffin itself was amazing but toasted peanut butter granola with it made it even better!! Thanks so much for sharing this butter and oil free recipe ^^

Great no fat recipe.

I think the trick to these muffins is mash the bananas really well until they are very liquid. That way there is no need for extra liquid such as milk. This greatly improves the texture.

It is a very sweet recipe (Which I love!) but by reducing the sugar to 1/2c they remain sweet but the muffins end up less sticky.

These muffins were wonderful!  I made them with 6 very ripe bananas instead of 3.  Before I baked them I sprinkled a little brown sugar on the top for a little extra sweetness!  My fiance and I loved them!  We shared them with all of our friends, and they loved them as well!  No one complained about them not being to dry at all.  This recipe was great!!!  I would defenitly make it again!!!

i added a drained 8oz can of crushed pineapple to the banana mix and used Bisquick instead of all-purpose flour. also sprinkled the tops with brown sugar and cinammon before putting them into the oven, and they came out with gorgeous golden tops and the best banana flavor i've ever tasted in a muffin. this is my default banana muffin recipe from now on!

A great recipe that taste like muffins and not cupcakes! I couldn't believe there 
wasn't any oils. I shortened the time by five minutes baking and made mini
muffins instead.

These were so good!    What I did was use 2 very brown bananas, 2 eggs, almost a cup of applesauce, a splash of vanilla, and 1/4 cup of milk.  1/2 cup splenda instead of sugar.  Normal salt, flour, soda.  I also put a little brown sugar on top before baking.  this made 12.  I also used Pam Baking and sprayed the pan well.  They slid right out!  My kids love them!

I followed the recipe exactly and the muffins were good for a lighter option but definitely needed something.  The nuts were a huge plus!  Next time I will try some of the other suggestions given by other users.

Really good! A little chewy but that is to be expected with no oils. Great flavor! I took the below advice and added applesauce, cinnamon, vanilla and an extra banana. I sprayed the paper liners with pam so they didn't stick, and filled them to the top.  Baked for 23 mins and Ended up with 11 perfectly risen muffins, yum!

Great Muffins! I've made these about 4 times now, and they are a big hit in my house. I followed some of the suggestions here:   1/2 cup skim milk, top with brown sugar (sift and sprinkle or you'll get big dimples) and add 1 more Ripe banana.   I've also added dried cranberries. I thought they were very good, and some just thought they were a good addition to "mix it up" a bit. All in all a new favorite in my house!   Thank You Shelby M. and those who commented with improvements!

I make muffins for our school and we have 3 young boys who are allergic to milk, & nuts so this recipe is great for them.  Also one of the boys is allergic to eggs so I substitute another banana and 2 tbsp of cornstarch for the eggs and the boys really seem to enjoy them.

Wow these muffins were great.  I used artificial sugar and 1 teas of vanilla and 1 teas of cinnimon. Got the calorie count down to 145 cal per muffin, but I used 4 banana's about 7" long that were really, really ripe...really filling, o and I didn't use the nuts, but I bet that would really make them extra good.  But was trying to keep the cal count low.

I listened to others and used: -1/2 cup of brown sugar -1/4 cup skim milk -some vanilla extract -4 bananas I made mini muffins  and baked them for 10 minutes! They were a bit plain for my liking, so i would recomend adding walnuts or chocolate chips (dark chocolate to be healthier!)

Great muffins!  I did as others suggested and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the white, and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and sprinkled some oats and a little brown sugar on top.  I wanted to use whole wheat flower (hubby came home from store with white, oh well) but I will definitely try it next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were the best banana muffins I've ever had/made! Since many reviewers had said that they were a little dry, i added 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 c milk, and an extra banana. Also, I added a tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg for some extra flavor.

These muffins were so easy to make using just one bowl. I used my electric mixer, first I added the bananas and eggs and then all of the other ingredients. Use this recipe as the starting point for terrific banana muffins. I read all of the reviews and decided to make a few changes too (I wanted to use up some pastry flour). These are my recipe changes: 4 bananas, 1 1/2 cups all purpose white flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour, added 1/4 cup of milk and only 1/2 cup of sugar. Also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. And 1 cup chopped walnuts. (The nuts are really optional.) Bake time 18 minutes for 12 regular size muffins.  I froze half of the muffins and they are still moist and delicious after 20 seconds on high from the microwave without defrosting first. I'm definitely making this recipe again.

Excellent and I love that they're low fat.  I added 1/3C of applesauce since I too thought the dough was sticky and used a bit under 1/2C sugar and then added a couple of heaping tablespoons of honey to make up for it.  Instead of walnuts, I folded in some cinnamon chips (but just a few since I wanted to keep the cals low).  Great straight out of the oven and great the next day.  Thanks, I will use this one a lot!

I added an extra banana and a touch of vanilla.  I'll tell you, these were delish!  A must try if you have some ripe bananas you need to do something with.

Very good base but I too added my own spin on these. Used 1 cup whole wheat flour, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup milk and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I used 4 egg whites and mixed the sugar, bananas, milk & vanilla with 2 of them, mixed in the dry ingredients, then whipped the other egg whites until stiff and folded them in. I sprinkled the tops with a few finely chopped pecans before baking at 375. If you put them in a zip lock bag before they are completely cool it will help them to loose that rubbery feeling. I did the math and on Weight Watchers these are worth about 2 points each!

These are really great, especially considering how little fat they have. I modified them a little bit per my tastes: added walnuts, 2 tbls. margarine, 4 oz applesauce, and substituted 2/3 cup whole wheat flour for 2/3 cup of the white flour. Awesome recipe, thanks!

Very edible for a low fat muffin. I used some of the reviewer suggestions and added the apple sauce, an extra banana, cinnamon, and walnuts. Would have been very bland without the add-ins but this turned out pretty good.

We used 4 very ripe bananas, 1/2 c. applesauce and 1 tsp. vanilla & 1/4 c. finely ground walnuts as previously suggested.  I also omitted the salt, added 1 tsp. baking powder and dissolved (somewhat) my baking soda in 1 TBS water (adding this to the wet mixture instead of the dry)and used Oat flour.  They were light and delicious! (my kids didn't care for the cinnamon I added and asked that next time I don't add it).

I have been looking for a good banana muffin recipe for a long time and this one is perfect. I did add one container of unsweetened apple sauce (the lunch box size) and some chocolate chips instead of the walnuts because we were looking for a dessert/snacky muffin but these would have been great as is for breakfast. I ended up with 2 dozen muffins though (I have smaller muffin pans) so make sure to take that into account if you are not using the large muffin tins.

These were very good!!  I made them into muffin tops as one reviewer suggested so it's like a big cakey cookie.  I added a couple tablespoons of mini chocolate chips and used 2/3 Splenda and 1/3 sugar.  Next time I will use egg beaters to lower the calories even more and maybe reduce the flour.  Very tasty.  I individually wrapped and froze some so they'll last.

All right, I guess. kinda lacking in taste. If I made this again I would add vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I'd also sprinkle some cocoa on top.
NOTE to those who like this because it's low fat - don't forget it still has 200 calories from the carbs in each muffin.

My Daughter and niece were fighting over these.  I only had 1 super ripe banana, and 3 small ones that were just ripening, so I lowered the recipe.  Thank good I had read everyones reviews.  To help me out I first converted the recipe to 6 muffins.  It then called for 1 1/4 egg.  So i used 1 egg, a glop (2 tbps?) of applesauce, the wheat and all pourpose flour, sprinkle of nutmeg, cinnimon, and a dash of vanilla.  My mother thought they would taste horrible because I also used Spenda (my father is diabetic, I wanted to see if they would be good).  They rocked, and I got 9 out of the recipe, and they were gone in 3 hours.  I will definately use this often.

My batter was just right, but I did add the sugar to the egg and banana mixture then added the rest of the dry ingredients. Also, I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 baking powder, and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top of each muffin. This reciped made about a dozen and a half, but one of my muffin pans is not as high as the other. For a low-fat recipe, this was really good!

An excellent recipe, low in fat, fills you up, and quick and easy to make. The only shortcoming for me was that they are quite heavy and you can taste the egg quite obviously.
I would definitely recommend this as a lunch-box filler!

I followed the recipe, and added 4 bananas instead, just because I had one more and many reviews said it was too dry. I also added chocolate chips in the batter, then raisins and cinnamon powder as topping. Batter was the right consistency. Turned out just right after 45 minutes of baking. So I believe the recipe is one banana too few.

These are very good, although I changed up the recipe a little after reading reviews. Instead of 2 cups flour, I used 1.5 cups flour and .5 cup of oats. I lowered sugar to .5 cup. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 cup milk. Oh, and I reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon. The muffins turned out delightfully chewy with a strong banana flavor. I love the texture - I think it's better than typical banana bread. I will definitely be using this as my go-to recipe from here on out.

Simply delicious. Loved that they weren't greasy but they retained moisture.  I added 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 c peach nectar juice (thought I had applesauce).. and some sliced almonds. They've been out of the oven for 15 minutes and 3 are already gone :] A keeper!

These are amazing for being pretty much guilt free! I added an extra banana per other reviews, a tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup skim milk, and pulsed in my Ninja. Combined with 1 1/2 cup organic flour, and 1/2 cup wheat, replaced the white sugar with 1/4 cup brown sugar (honestly I could reduce that amount, they're plenty sweet with the bananas) and 1/4 cup mini dark choc chips. Oh my goodness. YUM.

I really like these, they are just so easy to make! I added an individual-portion container of Motts applesauce to the bananas when I pureed them in the blender, then spiced them with a dash of cinnamon and grated in some nutmeg. Instead of using white, I subbed whole wheat flour and brown sugar because that's what I had on hand. This recipe yielded 12 good sized muffins - yummy.

Good recipe. It does make beautiful crowns. I added cinnamon and milk like the others, but also some chocolate chips.

I liked that this was a healthier recipe than most :) The texture was a little off but then again I'm still trying to figure out my new oven (a very old tempermental gas oven).... Will make again and work with some different ingredients to make it even better. Used an extra banana and added some cinnamon.

Very good! Although I modified the recipe a bit based on other reviews.. I used 4 bananas, 4 oz of unsweetened apple sauce, I cut out the white sugar all together and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead. I used 1.5 cup of wheat flour and 3 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg! Very moist! I made 6 large muffins instead of 12 small ones.

These were good but not as great as I hoped.  Perhaps some of my modifications didn't work.  I added one more banana and 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla.  I used splenda instead of sugar.  I think that next time I will try to use 1/2 cup of spenda and 1/4 cup sugar.

I was really impressed that this muffin was moist since it had no fat in it.  I used 1/2 c oats and 1/2 c unbleached wheat flour with the 1 c white as per another reviewer, also I used 4 bananas and 1/4 c lowfat buttermilk. I also used 1/2 Diabetasweet brown sugar subt.  This was a muffin one can feel good about eating.  I added nuts to mine but when I make them again I will use mini chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I am so glad I tried this recipe! I have made this recipe in a variety of ways in the last 2 days! (overloaded on bananas...freezing them for easy breakfast later) I tried the straight recipe and they were like others said a little chewy but not bad, we like them. Then tried what some others said by adding an extra banana, this was much better. They turned out less chewy and more bread like. Some I have added different amounts of cinnamon, but my favorite by far are the banana with chocolate chips! Can't go wrong with these muffins. I like to play around so I am going to try adding Craisins in the next batch.

I thought these were delicious for not having any butter/oil in them. However I did add some vanilla, cinnamon and 1/4 cup if skim milk because before adding the milk the 'batter' to this was more dough-like than anything. They weren't dry, but they were more dense than regular banana bread/muffins. Ill continue to use this recipe, with the changes I made, whenever I have extra bananas... it was very easy to make. Thanks for sharing

I had two very ripe bananas that I didn't want to waste and so only made half the recipe.  I added vanilla and about a tablespoon of half and half.  With the extra amount of banana, vanilla, and cream, this made 7 nice size muffins.  I was really careful and tested these so as not to overbake, and I wouldn't say that they were dry, but the texture is significantly different than banana bread made with oil and/or butter.  This would probably not be my first pick for a banana muffin, but I might make them again, especially if I'm looking for a way to use a couple of ripe bananas.

this is a very good recipe. I only give it four stars cause I had to follow some of the modifications other people used. I cut the sugar back to half a cup, added cinnamon and vanilla, used four bananas and added a couple tablespoons of milk. It baked for 20 minutes. I would make this again :)

AMAZING!! I used 4 bananas instead of 3 and a 1/4 cup of milk for added moisture. I also added some vanilla and cinnamon. This tastes just like a really great banana bread, but in delicious muffin form! And I LOOOVVVEE how healthy they are!

I've made these twice now.  I halve the recipe but use 2 full bananas.  Very moist and tasty.  Only complaint is that the texture is a little chewy compared to other muffins.

I was looking for an easy recipe that would use up 2 1/2 ripe bananas and this fit the bill.  The muffins turned out good, but definitely not banana-y enough.  I would recommend using 4 or 5 ripe bananas to get the flavoring.  In addition to adding 1 c. chopped walnuts, I also added 1/4 c. milk.   I needed the milk to cut the batter which was really thick.  As per others recommendations, I added a tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.  And I'm so glad I did as I think the muffins would have been incredibly bland without it.  To cut the calories and carbs a bit more, I used a brown sugar/splenda blend (1/4 c. + 2 Tbs) in lieu of the sugar.  The muffins turned out just sweet enough.  Next time, I think I will use 1/2 wheat + 1/2 white flour to make it a bit healthier.  And I will probably add applesauce to up the moistness in the muffins.  Note - I was worried these would stick to the paper muffin wrappers so I sprayed each of them lightly with Olive Oil spray before filling with the muffin batter (3/4 full).  I was able to get 12 full muffins out of this recipe and they didn't stick to the paper!

Honestly, these turned out just...terrible. I followed the recipe exactly, but even with 1/4 cup of milk added to help lighten up the mixture they still tasted like giant dough balls!

Yum, these turn out great every time.  Definitely didn't find them dry.  Only used 1/3 of the sugar called for in the recipe, and it was still very sweet, probably don't even need any added sugar with all of the bananas.  The banana taste was quite strong (which I love!).  And no fat!  Can't ask for more!

These are very good.  I usually don't put oil and lots of sugar in my muffins anyway, so this is a great recipe.  It is very strongly banana tasting!  I added some vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, and a tsp of baking powder because I wanted them as puffy as possible.  I also only put 1/4 cup brown sugar (instead of white), and they're still really sweet, I think you could even not bother with the sugar, the bananas make them nice and sweet.  I made mini muffins, got 24 mini muffins plus 6 mini muffin tops out of this.  Yumyum. Good texture too, not dry or chewy at all.  I'll be making these again.

I have made these many, many times and these muffins rise amazingly...so beautiful. Per other reviews, I add one extra banana, 1/4 cup skim milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also add just a very slight drizzle of oil and mini-chocolate chips to half the recipe. 

These muffins, however, are not as moist as other reviewers claim, especially when compared to store-bought muffins or boxed recipes. They are not dry, but they are not extremely moist either. The muffins are also heavy and filling, and as another reviewer said, get tougher once cooled. Just warm them, however, if this bothers you. 

All in all, these are great muffins if you want a more natural and healthy one, which is why I make them all the time. They are great for snacks and for breakfast. Plus, the kiddos love 'em!

I am always looking for low fat/fat free recipes!  This is really quick, easy and YUMMY!  Both times I have used this recipe for muffins then made a banana bread!  (Bread-bake for 50-60 minutes).  I have also used 1 cup of wholewheat flour/1 cup whilte flour.  Very moist and loved by all.

These Muffins are absolutely fantastic! I don't know how they could have gotten bad reviews, maybe some people didn't use ripe enough bananas.
I'm normally a stickler to the recipe, but I only had 2 large ripe bananas so I added some different ingredients, to make up for it.
I added a dash of skinny milk to strech the banana mix, and added some vanilla and cinnamon and nutmeg too. I diced at apple finely and added that too, and chucked in a handful of rolled oats. I also reduced the sugar a bit, because the fruit was really sweet.
I'm so pleased I've found such a versatile muffin recipe that is so low fat. My mum didn't belive they were only 600kl each! (I also made 12 muffins, not 10, but I'm in Australia so perhaps we have different sized tins.)
This is definately a keeper, thank you so much!

These muffins are delish! I would have rated it 5 stars but they wouldn't have been half as good without the vanilla, applesauce, cinnamin, and nutmeg.  I also threw in some walnuts.  I'll be making these again.

Wow- these are incredible!! I used 4 bananas as suggested and added 4 oz. unsweetened applesauce, 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon and some chopped walnuts. I filled the muffin tins up halfway and got 23 small muffins. I just ate 2 fresh out of the oven and they taste just as good as bakery muffins. I can't wait to make these again!!

I made this as a bread. I added 1/4 cup apple sauce, 2 tablespoons of fat free plain yogurt, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. I also sprinkled some cinnamon and brown sugar on top before putting it in the oven. I just ate two pieces of it warm out of the oven. (with a thin layer of butter spread on it!) It is definitely yummy, the middle is moist and I like the topping of brown sugar and cinnamon. The only thing I could say against it: the texture of the crust on the bottom was a tiny bit chewy. But really people, that is a small complaint considering this is a no butter, no oil, no shortening recipe. I will make this again for sure, perhaps throwing some walnuts and cherries into the batter. I baked it for an hour, covering it with tin foil for the last 15 minutes or so.

Yum!  I couldn't believe how well this recipe turned out with no oil or butter!  I actually baked it as a loaf instead of muffins.  It took about 50 minutes, and I covered the top with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes to keep it from getting too brown.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and made the following modifications: I added 1/2 cup apple sauce, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It was deicious!  Next time I may add mini chocolate chips.  I will definitely make this again.

I made a few changes to this recipe and I think they are delicious!  I used Splenda for baking instead of sugar and I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon.  I baked them for 13 minutes in a mini muffin tin and put 1 blueberry in the middle of each mini muffin before baking.  According to my calculations, each mini muffin is only 53 calories with the adjustments I made!

So,I bought a bunch of bananas last week, and as usual I only ate two of them before they got too ripe for my taste. The three that remained were too ripe for anything but baking, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I'm glad I did. I made a couple of modifications: I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 teaspoon each nutmeg and cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and thinned the batter with just a little vanilla soymilk (maybe a tablespoon or so). I also folded in 1/2 cup walnuts. Thought about using 1/2 whole wheat flour, but I think that would have made the muffins a bit too heavy. The batch I made turned out quite tasty and still very wholesome. The recipe made 12 good-sized muffins, and three of them have already been eaten in the hour since I baked them. Both my mom and my dad thought they were good, and my dad's fairly picky about food, so that's high praise. Since I always buy too many bananas, I think I'll be using this recipe a lot. Thanks!

I used 4 bananas instead of 3 and added in the nutmeg/cin and vanilla.  Also, added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  Made 12 muffins.  Very moist and delicious.  A definite keeper!

Not bad for low fat, although the taste lets you know that the butter is missing.  I actually got 12 muffins as well, not 10.  A bit dry perhaps some more liquid next time (more bananas, or maybe some applesauce)  Definitely a muffin I can enjoy on a diet though without feeling guilty!

I would of given this  3 stars but my step daughter insisted on given it 4.  I followed the recipe exactly and they lacked some flavor.  They werent too bad though and all were eaten.   Made them again adding 2 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon. And a third a cup of applesauce and those changes helped alot. With the changes I would rate this 5 stars.

Wow-for no oil & almost fat free...this is incredible!!
I did use only 1/4 c sugar & 2 tbsp honey plus I added vanilla extract and cinnamon to up the flavour. The batter was very thick so i added a spoonful of sour cream. Amazing!! Tasted like regular banana bread and wasn't dry (best eaten the day of or day after so it doesn't dry out) My dad-who hates fat free, low fat or healthy anything LOVED it (i didnt even tell him it was low fat) Making it again right now! Great base recipe to experiment with :)

I added 1/2 cup applesauce and cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, vanilla and butter flavoring. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and added a Tbsp of rice bran oil. I used Stevia instead of sugar. They turned out pretty good; although a little chewy.

Nice w/tea or coffee. Converted recipe for 1/2 doz, followed it & added 1/3c walnuts. Used pastel baking cups; the very bottom stuck a bit but using a butter knife to help you remove the muffin from the cup will keep the muffin intact. Defintely make these again, may add chocolate chips & or applesauce next time. Excluding the walnuts, 1 muffin is 5 WW P+.

Used 5 (small) bananas instead of 3 and they were tasty if very dense. Oh, and instead of all-purpose flour and baking soda I had to use self-raising flour as it's all I had!! Also added a little vanilla and cinnamon...yum! My girlfriend loved them but I found them a bit too chewy so I'm not sure if I'd make them again.

A little dry but still really good.  Made for the first time exactly to the recipe. Modifications for next time:  *whole wheat flour instead of white  *brown sugar instead of white  Will add:  *1/2 c unsweetened applesauce  *1/2 cup oats  *1/4 cup milk  The batter was quite think and I worried as I put them into my muffin pans that they would ne heavy little lumps but they came out just fine.

These muffins were excellent!  I followed the recipe pretty close, but used whole wheat flour and brown sugar as that was what I had.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of skim milk to thin the dough.  The recipe made 12 good-sized muffins.  I definately will make these again!

These turned out really well. I find them a tiny bit bland, but my kids really love them and to me that's more important!  I added applesauce and used 1/2 brown sugar instead of white. I added a bunch of cinnamon too. My boys love them and they make a great quick healthy snack! I make them often!

I made these for my 9 month old son- and he loved them! I followed a lot of the other recommendations in the reviews; I used 1/2c. brown sugar instead of 3/4c. white, 1c. whole wheat flour and 1c. all-purpose, 1 1/2tsp. of cinnamon, and 4 bananas. Very easy and so moist! They do stick to the paper liners a lot- I think next time I'll try spraying the liners with a little bit of oil. We'll definitely be making these a lot!

These are awesome although I deviated from the original recipe as I don't like white flour.  I added 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup bran flakes cereal and 1/3 cup bran.  I also did as others and added 1/2 c. applesauce.  Lots of banana flavor with a swee walnut crunch.

I've had the misfortune of trying some bad banana muffin recipes. I can assure you this recipe is very very good. It is a hearty muffin that along with a good cup of java or glass of milk will fill you up but not drag you down. I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1/8 tsp of vanilla just to give them a little bit more kick. If you want to be super decadent add a bit of whipped cream when serving. They

I never thought about leaving out the margarine or oil when making these, so when I first saw this I was a little wary. Then I realized I had an extra banana to work with that might prevent the possibility of the muffins coming out dry. They were PERFECT! An extra banana makes all the difference. Thanks.

This is my favorite new recipe!!!  For a lowfat snack for kids, you can't beat it.  I use whole what flour and they are terrific.  I do recommend following others advice and adding some applesauce, maybe 1/4C to original recipe, it makes them a bit moister.  Don't over stir or overbake!  Also, try subing in one 15oz can pumpkin for the bananas.  Today I made with 1 banana, about 1C pumpkin and 1/2C applesauce.  Also added chopped nuts, dates and cranberries.  The possibilities are endless.  I may try sweet potato next.  Great recipe!!

Recipe yielded 30 mini muffins. Followed recipe with addition of 1/2 cup of 2% reduced fat milk.  Muffins were yummy!!  Will definitely make again.

Really good, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the batter was really thick without any oil in it.  To solve that problem I added 2 of the snack cups of strawberry applesauce.  Everyone loves them.

These were pretty good!  I'm on a low fat diet, and this recipe worked great.  I took the rest of that fat out by subsituting "Egg Beaters" for the eggs.  I also added the applesauce, skim milk, vanilla, and cinnamon as other users suggested.  They did stick ALOT to the muffin tins, so I may use pam to spray my muffin tins, and try that next time.  Overall Great Recipe!  Thanks!

Great activity for my two year old and I. I freeze bananas that are past their 'prime' (we'll only actually eat them still partially green), and he does the 'mashing' part and loves dumping the dry goods. Easy measurements make it easy to scale up as well. The batter is incredibly yummy too! ;)

Just know they're very puffy, so don't overfill your muffin cups!

These are great! I added a banana (4) and used 1/2 cup splenda instead of white sugar. I think the problem between the recipes is that maybe some ppl are using small eggs vs. large (which I used) Remember muffins aren't suppose to be runny. I found they were perfect texture, density, and taste! Thanks! 

- I did use 1 cup of whole wheat flour as well... but I think it doesn't make a difference either way just more fibre.

Like the other reviews suggested I added a few things to this recipe. I added 1/2c. skim milk, 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon,1/2c. Splenda Brown Sugar in place of the white sugar and I also left out the flour, salt and baking powder and used a whole wheat baking mix similar to bisquik in their place. They were very moist and yummy. I have already made them twice this week and the kids are just gobbling them up. Iam only giving this recipe 4 stars because I think without the add ins it would have been pretty bland.

Great!  I made 'em this morning, and had two!  The banana didn't cook fully since I didn't mash it up completely, and I think it tasted great!  Since some family members cannot eat nuts, I substituted the nuts with the chocolate chips, and tasted better!

i'm giving it fours stars because i followed everyone else's suggestions. it was a very good base recipe though. i used whole wheat flour instead, added cinnamon and vanilla, and sprinkled brown sugar on top. i definitely knew something was up with the batter...it just seemed way too sticky and dry, so i added some soy milk. that solved the problem. i only used three bananas because i thought that they were big enough, but i will definitely use four next time. it's very good and most of all  i know i'm not consuming a million calories. my dad loves muffins for breakfast but all the store bought ones are so high in fat. these are perfect for him. i will definitely make these again.

I was not happy with the way these muffins turned out.  I cook a lot and know what muffin batter looks like but this was sticky. I knew when I was baking them that they would not turn out.  Well, I was right.  They were chewy and gluey.  The flavor is there but next time I will add some apple sauce or some oil.

Yum!  A great recipe for those bananas I have been keeping in the freezer.  I also added a bit of skim milk & 4 bananas.  Just sweet enough, even my Husband agrees.

These turned out surprisingly good, but of course not the same as glorious fatty muffins :0)  I would add another banana (i used three, next time will do four) and I added the nutmeg and cinnamon as one user suggested.  I also added walnuts but next time will be sure to chop them as the whole nuts were a bit overpowering.  Instead of sugar I substituted honey, which ended up working out well because it kept everything nice and moist.

Thanks for the recipe! It's great for me to make for health conscious people

Compared to full-fat muffins, these are only ok at best (so, 3 stars). But, for fat-free baked goods, these are great! If I make these again, I will add some applesauce as suggested by helpful reviewers here. The changes that I made were adding 1 tsp. vanilla, sub. Splenda Blend for sugar, sub. 1/3 cup whole wheat flour for part of the all-purpose, plus I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg. They're tasty and satisfy my craving for baked goods. They are quite spongey rather than moist, so applesauce would really improve these.

Delicious...i added a few walnuts for a crunch like it said and oh my gosh was it good! To make it a bit more healthy, instead of white sugar, i used brown sugar and it is still quite delicious! Even healthier...small change but it will not change the great taste!

These were excellent right out of the oven but not as good the next day.  The tops of mine got sort of gooey.  Not sure it's from all the banana.  I did add vanilla and walnuts, and used 4 bananas instead of 3.  Will definitely make again when I have more mouths to feed.

Awesome muffins! I added 1/2 cup applesauce, a teaspoon of vanilla, pecans and substituted 1/2 cup regular Splenda & 1/4 cup of brown sugar Splenda for the sugar. Made 12 muffins with perfect crowns. Will make again & again.

I couldn't wait- I ate them hot and could not tell that they were lowfat.  I followed all of the recommendations and used: 1/4 c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla, plus I added an individual-sized applesauce (the batter was too dry to even stir without it!).  I hope they are as good when they have cooled off!  ps  They were pretty tough the next day.

Followed the original recipe with these changes:
 1.  4 bananas (instead of 3) smashed with 4oz of applesauce and 1 tsp vanilla (along with the eggs required for recipe)
2.  1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour 
3.  No white sugar, use 1/2 cup brown sugar 
4.  Add 1 tsp cinnamon 
Try sticking a toothpick in the muffins after 20 minutes in the oven, mine are fully cooked at this point and super moist.

I did what others suggested, and used 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla.  I only had 3 bananas though-came out perfectly! I left the muffins overnight in a covered container-must do this!! I woke up and they were SUPER moist!! Highly recommend this recipe.

I used a couple ideas from people that had modified it before me. I used 4 bananas, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup oats. In addition to that, I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Delicious!

In all fairness, we made a few modifications based on the reviews of others.  I used equal parts of oats, whole wheat flour and white flour instead of straight white flour.  I added an extra banana.  I used 1/3 c of brown sugar and 1/3 c of white sugar instead of 3/4 c white sugar. I also added 1/4 c of low fat milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  They were soo yummy!

I really liked these.  Used the mods that others suggested (extra banana, vanilla, cinnamon) added walnuts.  Made twelve plus four muffin tops.  Easy to make and I just used some 0 calorie "butter" to make it a real treat while still warm out of the oven.  I don't know about you but my bananas seem to turn brown very quickly these days, so this will be a recipe I use often so they don't go to waste.

My kids really like these I just got done making them. They are a little bit rubber like but still good. Didn't have applesauce but did add a splash of apple juice. Will add walnuts next time though. Pretty good though.

I had two very ripe bananas that I wanted to use and found this recipe.  I thought the muffins were really good...and really moist!  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and a couple shakes of cinnamon and they turned out great.

Yum! I halved this recpie and mixed these up with my 4 year old daughter and it was a lot of fun. We added strawberries too, and a little extra banana and milk like the other reviews reccomended. Tasty, although next time I think I'll try it with brown sugar. The halved recpie made 10 small muffins for us.

I gave this recipe 4 stars as written with the help of pp's was 5 star.  although my version These are hands-down the best banana muffins I have tasted.  I did add the 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, 1 t vanilla and 1 t cinnamon and 1 extra banana as suggested by pp's.  I also added 1 cup chocolate chips, at my kids insistence.  My kids don't care for banana bread but they gobbled down these muffins warm out of the oven.  I only baked them for 20 min but they should have baked 5-10 more min.

After reading the reviews, I added 4 oz. applesauce, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon and tossed in 1/2 cup pecan pieces.  This made 16 sm/med sized muffins that baked in 19 minutes.  These were very moist (not dry at all) and delicious!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Followed some other suggestions: added 4 oz applesauce, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and sprinkled a tiny bit of brown sugar on top. My husband liked them better than the unhealthy ones I was making! Since my son is addicted to banana muffins, these will probably be made once a week. Thanks for a healthier alternative!!!

I halved this recipe, since I only had two bananas. It was pretty good. I was expecting them to be dry, but they were not. In fact, they were soft and just slightly springy.   I added 1/4 cup of milk and used brown sugar, like others suggested. I also added cinammon and vanilla. I didn't have applesauce, so I drizzed in some honey and it was good. I topped it off with a bit of coconut and oatmeal. A great breakfast item. :)

Good Tasting Muffin. I like a recipe that is simple so I can personalize them. I just added a little cake spice this time but I think I'll add some raisons, strawberries or blueberries to moisten them up.

I never read reviews before trying the original recipe. These were a lot better than I expected. I made them with my daughter and she loved all the mashing. They were a bit rubbery the first time we made them I think we may have overcooked them a bit. The second time we added an extra banana and a sprinkle of brown sugar on top before baking. For LOW FAT they are a WINNER! All though we love the ones made with sour cream and butter, these are a much better choice. Thanks for the recipe.

These were a bit rubbery in texture. They're good for a healthier muffin but don't expect it to taste as good as a regular banana nut muffin.   The one big disappointment I did have about this muffin is that the tops were not crispy right out of the oven.

Thanks for all of the suggestions! I added applesauce & milk as suggested by others & used 4 bananas instead of 3, also as suggested.  I also added vanilla. My babies love them! The texture is chewy & not a "traditional" muffin texture, but totally worth it to cut out all the fat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

very, very good considering there was no fat.  i was fine with 3 bananas but did add 1/2 cup of applesauce.  moist and flavorful, "crowned" beautifully and didn't stick to the pan.

This is a great recipe!  I only had 2 small bananas on hand, so I halved the recipe, and needed to add a little milk because the batter was a touch dry.  I also added a little vanilla and sprinkled the tops of the muffins with sugar and the muffins had a nice crispy top.  YUM!!

At first when i saw this recipe, i was thinking "hmmm.... can a banana muffin with no butter, oil, or apple sauce be all that good?". When I took a bite out of one of these, I knew the answer was "Yes, and better". These are so yummy, and feel good to eat to!

I was really surprised how mosit these muffins turned out to be.  Add 1/4 cup of applesauce,1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and some walnuts. They were all gone in one hour.  Instead of white sugar I used sweet n low brown sugar.  My husband who has diabetes really enjoyed these as did the kids.

These were soooo good!  Thank you for the recipe.  I'm all about making things low fat.  I added 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce to these, that is why I didn't give it a 5.  A very good recipe!

MMMMmmm, I make these all the time.  They sure don't last long in our house.  I use an extra banana, a little bit of skim milk (1/4 cup maybe) and lil bit of vanilla.  I also substitute 2 eggs for 3 egg whites and splenda for the sugar.  My husband hates all my healthy cooking, so I didn't tell him to after he ate lots of them and he was very pleasantly suprised.  Oh yah, don't forgot the nutmeg and cinamon!

YUMMY!!! I used the tips from previous reviewers and used 1/4 cup of applesauce and 4 bananas...also a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon.  The tops on these muffins look great..filled to the top of the muffin tin worked out great and I didn't use the papers, just greased the tins.  I quickly added this to my recipe box!!

What can I say that's any different...it's really good!  I added an extra banana for moistness like the others said, and considering that there is no oil and no butter, I'm surprised that they taste this good and are moist.  Awesome find!

I followed some other reviews and added 1/4 cup milk and also added chocolate chips to some, walnuts to others and topped the rest with brown sugar.  These muffins were great and I loved the fact that the ingrediants were all items I keep in my pantry.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe for regular use!

Quite delicious!  I took others' advice and mashed up 4 bananas and then realized I didn't have enough flour. I used 3/4 of the dry ingredients with the full the 2 eggs/4 bananas and they could have used just a bit more baking time. However, they looked beautiful...golden brown outside, wondering looking inside and only a few undercooked spots. I'll definitely keep this recipe and use over and over.

These are DELICIOUS and I'm not even a huge banana fan.  I did modify the recipe a bit.  I used 1/2 whole-wheat flour and 1/2 regular.  I used 4 bananas, and added about 1/4-1/2 cup homemade, slightly sweetened applesauce.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 2 tablespoons of milk.  I also added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, and a sprinkling of flax seeds.  It made 12 huge muffins with beautiful crowns.  I just baked in muffin tin sprayed with cooking spray and they didn't stick. (Remember, too much stirring of muffin batter can affect quality.  Just stir until moistened.)  Enjoy!

Made this for a work gathering.  I followed the recipie to a T (only had those ingredients), but I felt they turned out really chewy.  Not bad flavor, just really chewy.  If I make them again, I would add one more banana and follow other's reviews (i.e. adding applesauce).

I thought these were pretty good, for low-fat (remember folks, if you use the whole egg, they're not entirely fat-free). Only had two bananas, so I halved the recipe. Added 1/4 cup natural (no sugar added) applesauce, 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla (following suggestions by others), and substituted Splenda Baking Blend for sugar. These are moist and rise nicely. Next time, I'll try baking them directly in the muffin pan sprayed with cooking spray, to avoid the sticking-to-the-paper-cup problem. **UPDATE** Made full recipe, adding 1/2 cup natural applesauce and 1 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla (or sub light vanilla yogurt for applesauce and omit vanilla extract). Substituted in 2 eggs minus one yolk, Splenda Baking Blend, and 1 cup wheat bread flour. Made mini muffins without liners using cooking spray w/flour. Wonderful. Just like banana bread, these are always better the next day.

Fantastic to find a low-fat favorite!  I also added 1/4 C. milk and used about 3 Tbsp. of vanilla (fat-free) pudding mix.  Brought them back to the texture we all love and moistened them up a bit.  It was a complete fake-out for all who tried them...they had NO IDEA they were fat-free.  Definitely making these again!!!

Very good muffins! =) I made a few changes to make it a little healthier. I added 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, added about 2 tsp flaxseed and 2 tsp wheat germ, I didn't use all the suger so I added just a few drops of honey to the wet liquids. I also added a little vanilla for taste and about 2 tsp of applesauce and an extra banana because my batter was a little too thick. This made them perfect texture though. I suggest freezing them so you can leave one out the night before if you want one for breakfast or if you want one for lunch you can grab it from the freezer and it will thaw out by lunch! Plan on making lots more of these.

i just finished pulling the last batch out of the oven! i was pleasantly surprised with how great these tasted! although there isn't much flavor at first, it finishes up with a nice kick to it! however, i did have to make several modifications. first, instead of 2 bananas, i used 4(i may even use 5 the next time i make these,) and i used 3 eggs instead of 2. Also, i only used 1/2 a cup of sugar, but sprinkled about a tablespoon over the recipe before putting them in the oven. I also added a teaspoon  of vanilla and some cinnamon. i eyeballed the cinnamon, but i think it amounted to about a teaspoon and a half. also, i didn't have any muffin tins on hand, so i simply plopped the dough on a cookie sheet using table spoons(the big kind you put on the table,) and baked the muffin tops for 10-11 minutes at 375 degrees. This was a great recipe, it was extremely easy, and even the pickiest of my younger siblings enjoy them!

These were great! The only problem was I mixed the liquids with the dry stuff the day ahead. It came out with a wet look, when I findally baked it, in the next morning. Very delious, and tasteful. I didn't have nutmeg, so I substituded a pumkin spice. I also used vanilla yogurt for lotos-intorent reasons, instead of milk, which also could've gave it that wet look.

I followed this recipe as written and have to say they were very good. I used a pan that makes only 8 muffins and I sprinkled the tops with some sugar.  They had huge tops and looked liked gourmet store-bought muffins. But,I couldn't eat a whole one at one time. 

I have tried many banana muffin recipes and although these were not the most moist, they were a nice change.  I will make them again and I will try adding an additional banana and make them as bite-size muffins.

I really enjoy reading the comments that you all make and learning about your revisions and suggestions.

Good recipe for a healthier treat! I also added 1 tbs vanilla, 1/4 tbs nutmeg, 3 tbs applesauce, and 2 tbs rice dream.  The inside stayed moist while outside was firmer, but this gave it a unique texture. If this wasnt a lower fat recipe i would still rate it 4 stars.

I'm not much of a baker at all and I managed to make these muffins easily. They're simple and delicious. I added chocolate chips because I had some on hand and you can never go wrong with chocolate. I may add more banana next time though, because you can never have enough banana flavor.

I added strawberries to the mix and they turned out well. Made 12 muffins. They stuck to the paper cups quite a bit but otherwise delicious.

They didn't rise at all and were very chewy. I really want this recipe to work, but somehow it just didn't. I might try again just because I'm stubborn.

I too really enjoyed this recipe!  They actually cooked in about 18 minutes for me.  I too added vanilla extract.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar (halfed the amount) and threw in some cinnamon sugar.  I also used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup spelt flour.  Delicious - this is a great base to add your own "flavors."

Not sure what some were talking about when they said the muffins were dense. I followed this version with the exception of 3 things. I added 1 more banana, 1/4 1% milk, and 1/2 walnuts. It yielded 18 muffins which made my muffins 150 calories and 3.8 grams a fat. Not to bad! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the lack of oil made the muffins "look" dry altough they weren't at all.

I made many of the same changes that others have: I added one more banana, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I also used half whole wheat flour and egg substitute to make these muffins even healthier.  They were a little overdone at 20 minutes, probably because of the lower fat content, so next time I'll check them at 17 or 18 minutes.  We all loved them for breakfast this morning; they were very tasty!

i give these 5 stars for texture, versatility, and easyness (easiness?...) but only 3 stars for taste. i added cinnamon, milk, used egg sub, etc. and really listened to about all of the other reviewers tips and made a dozen changes but these still were bland. i know taking away the nuts reduces the fat, but nuts are good fat and i think are what these nuts need for extra taste. these needed an extra something, so next time i will up the extracts, spices, and maybe add some nuts, fruit, or oats or something.   I made this again with 1/2 cup pumpkin and 2 bananas, and added a ton of pumpkin pie spice, then made the crumb topping from one of the top-rated banana muffin recipes from this site (1/3 cup brwn sugar, some oats, and 1 T butter. i used the low-fat kind and it was still so freaking delicious!) the muffins didnt taste anything like pumpkin but tasted like a better version of the ones i had previously made, especially with the toppping. even though it only uses one T of butter, it makes it taste so moist and melts in your mouth! if you use the low-fat Smart Balance butter it still remains low-fat but once again this recipe wasn't absolutely amazing. i think it needs like tablespoons of spices, some applesauce, and definitely the topping. next time i think i will layer the crumb topping so there is some in the middle and on top. definitely add nuts. i forgot again this batch.

I used all the sugested modfications namely - one extra banana, only a half a cup of sugar (mixture of brown sugar and slenda), one cup of whole wheat flour, add 1/4 cup of skim milk and an addition of vinila, cinnimon, and nutmeg. 

The resulting muffin was delicious and fluffy. It was very light and moist, with a very good flavor. I made one pan of 12 muffins and had enough batter for some mini muffins too.

I was surprised how well these muffins turned out for having no butter or oil. They are not flat but they puffed up perfectly. I added cinnamon, walnuts and some oatmeal. I will definetly make these again.

These muffins are great! for something that's so healthy and doesn't call for any butter/oil/margarine :) I thought they tasted a little chewy  though. so next time when i make this i will add 1 more banana and some milk.

These turned out really awesome! The recipe looked a bit dry so i actually added about 3 Tbsp of  sour cream and i cut down on the flour by about 1/4 c. I also used half slenda half sugar to make them even more healthy! I will make them again for sure!!

Better than my mother-in-law's!  Throw in some raisins or chocolate chips!  So good.  For loaf instead of muffins bake 60 minutes at 350.

I just tried one of these muffins and they are great! After reading the reviews I did make a few alterations, which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. I used 4 bananas instead of 3, 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp imitation butter flavoring, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 oz unsweetened applesauce, and 1/4 tsp ginger. This made 12 beautiful muffins for me. I will be making these again and I may increase the cinnamon, butter flavoring, and ginger just a little to get a more spicey flavor. Although these came out perfect and moist! Thanks for sharing a great starter recipe!

What could be simpler!  This recipe was easy to make and delicious. I substituted Spelt Flour and Sugar in the Raw in the same measure and it worked out perfectly.  What a boon for my family's special dietary needs!

Easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed them and they went quickly.  I did add 1/2 cup applesauce, 1tsp of vanilla, and 1tsp cinnamon.  Definately will make again.

Sort of stiff...was it the wheat flour? (used 1c wheat, 1c all purpose) I like the wheat flour because it gives it a nuttier taste...will try again following exactly. Hopefully it turns out--I enjoy lighter versions of yummy food.

I liked that this recipe didn't call for butter or oil but the muffins turned out a little drier than I would have preferred.  They stuck to the paper liners a little.  I would make this recipe again but I would plan on using some applesauce to make it a little moister without adding any fat.

I also had to add some things to make the batter wetter, 1/2 cup applesauce also the cinnamon someone mentioned. My applesauce is not sugar free my husband picked the wrong one in grocery store and I use Splenda in everything so after they cool land I can taste one I can see just how sweet they are. I love a good easy muffin recipe as I always have bananas getting too ripe I hope this one passes the taste test.

These turned out moist with great texture, however, I think it's because I followed adaptations from other reviews.  I used an extra banana, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, about 1 tsp cinnamon and about 1 tsp vanilla.  I also added about 1/3 cup chocolate chips. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar and reduced it to 1/2 cup and finally replaced one cup of white flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  Then baked for 25 minutes.  I will make this a go to recipe for a healthier banana muffin.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used three egg whites, four bananas, 1/4 cup skim milk, and a dash of vanilla in the wet ingredients.  For the dry I used 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and dash nutmeg (along the with salt and baking soda the recipe calls for.)  Once I filled 12 muffin liners, I sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top before baking.  I will probably make these again, though I will up the sugar slightly.

I've tried other low fat recipes and this one came out excellent! Folding the mixture slowly instead of mixing is the key.  Enjoy!

I really like these!  I followed others suggestions and made some changes. I doubled the recipe, used 7 bananas, added 2 snack sized Granny Smith applesauce cups, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. Penzeys baking spice, used half white and half brown sugar and used 2 cups white whole wheat flour since that is all I have and used 2 cups oats. Just ate one warm, yummmmmmm!!

I followed the tips and used a fourth banana (if anyone is wondering, the total weight of bananas used was 480 grams), 2 cups of whole wheat flour (instead of all purpose flour), and 1/3 cup of skim milk. In addition, I added 2 tbs of dark cocoa powder, 1 tbs of cinnamon, and replaced the 3/4 cup sugar with 1/3 cup stevia. They were tasted amazing, and - more importantly - were macro friendly.

They were great. I didn't think they were dry at all. I put macadamia nuts in them instead as I had them in the cupboard. A little cinnamon was nice too.

I made these per the posted recipe and they are very moist,sweet and light.  None of the heaviness that you sometimes get with Banana Bread.  I will turn to this recipe anytime I have over-ripe bananas!

Even lighter: I substituted 4 egg white for the 2 eggs, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, used 1 1/2 cup flour (I lowered this due to the added protein powder. If you don't used protein powder then use the full 2 cups), 2 scoops vanilla protein powder (like MRM), added 6 oz unsweetened applesauce, 1 small box raisins, 1/2 cup chopped nuts, and I used 1/4 cup xylitol instead of the sugar. This made 12 muffins if you fill them all to the max. I used paper liners and sprayed each with nonstick spray. (I think a few extra calories are worth the easy clean-up and for the liners to come off easy. ) I sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar and placed a slice of banana on top of each muffin. I had to cook for the full 25 mins. These little muffins are moist, dense, and have extra protein. This makes them great for a mid-morning snack.  (Extra healthy: You could also use oat flour. Just throw quick oats in a blender. I would only swap 1/2 of the AP flour for oat flour.  Oat flour contains more protein, dietary fiber and calcium, making it another healthy ingredient substitution.) Enjoy!

I tried this recipe using Quick cooking Mother's oats grinded down to flour texture (using Bella rocket blender),  adding 1t. cornstarch as a binder and 1/4 c. Pure maple syrup as sugar substitute.  Very tasty and moist, almost similar to a bran muffin...but better!

I've made these at least a dozen times and they are great! They are great as is, but even better with vanilla, dash of cinnamon and some chocolate chips. I also add 1 T of coconut oil which makes them a little less "rubbery." However, it's not really necessary if you don't want the fat. If you want to take things even further, top each muffin with a sprinkle of walnut, cinnamon and cocoa powder. Excellent! Thanks for a great recipe.

Definately recommend the added banana and applesauce, I also added vanilla, they stick something awful to the liners, I will not do that again, not trying to re-write your delicious recipe, just tried some things for my taste, love it, just shouldn't have used liners on the half that I tried it with....thank you!!!

I liked this recipe because it was quite easy to make. I did add 1 tsp vanilla and an extra banana. The kids loved them and I liked the flavour. I did find them a bit rubbery though. All in all I will likely make them again.

Made these for a preschool snack and they were a hit with the picky four year olds! Did modify recipe as suggested...used 4 bananas, 1/2 cup unsweeted applesause, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Made 36 in "mini" muffin tins for 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees.  Turned out terrific!

These were pretty good. I read the reviews that if made as is, they were a little dry. I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for the sugar, and added about 1/4 cup skim milk. They turned out delicious!!! They made 6 large muffins (which is how my family prefers them). All in all, very tasty!!!

As I made them they were 3 stars, but to be fair I think one of my changes changed the flavor.  I made them with my 2 year old.  We used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat.  The whole wheat flavor was not well covered in this recipe.  I also added vanilla & pumpkin pie spices,and a big spoonful of apple sauce. Wanted to do 1/2 a cup, but a spoonful was all that was left.  The texture is good, and they rose well, but they are a little too sweet.  I'd reduce the sugar, use all white flour, and add another banana next time.  They worked well for a toddler, as they were not crumbly.  Might make a good banana bread, too.

even though these are light they dont sacrifice taste, they are good muffins except if you follow the recipe exactly the batter is really stiff almost like a dough and the muffin turns out good but a tad rubbery

Yummy muffins!  I followed other people's suggestions and added cinnamon.  Bad idea.  I felt that this took away from the banana flavour.  I have made this before without the cinnamon and will continue to do so.

This is a very good recipe!  First time I used paper cups and the muffins really stuck. But I liked the taste. So next time I just poured the butter into a 8 X 8 cake pan and baked 20-25 minutes. After I cooled it and cut it into 16 pieces, they disappeared pretty quickly. We loved it chilled too! Will definitelly make these again and again and again. Variation: use 1/2 c of brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times and I absolutely love it.  I usually use some helf whole-wheat and half all-purpose flour and they turn out just as delicious! Make these, they're easy and yummy!

These were really good. Made a couple of adjustments: used 4 very ripe bananas, used half whole wheat flour/half all-purpose, added 1 tsp cinnamon, and about half a cup of nonfat banana yogurt. They came out great! They were a little chewy, but full of yummy banana bread flavor. They rose nicely, and I used paper muffin cups and did not have a problem with them sticking once cooled slightly. I will definitely make these again!

Awesome recipe! My batch turned out moist and delicious! I made some adjustments based on previous reviews. Added 1tsp vanilla, cinnamon and pumpkin spice (had it on hand, thought I'd give it a try). I also added 1/2cup of sweetened applesauce and cut back on the white sugar to 1/2cup. The batch yielded 21 small muffins. Would have added some walnuts or pecans but I was out of them!

I am a baking ditz, this recipes was super easy to make!!! I added an extra banana and 1/4 cup of skim milk. They came out moist, soft and sweet. Also, I made sure the bananas were super ripe.    Also, I am extremely picky with the taste of things, especially if things are deemed "lighter or low fat". You seriously wont know the difference between "regular" banana muffins and these!!! ENJOY

This recipe was very quick and easy. I used whole wheat flour instead of white and made sure my bananas were "very" ripe. I also added 3/4 cup of Spiced Pecan cereal from Costo. It added more fiber, while giving it a spicy kick without adding any trans fat.

Great Muffins! I did however change it slightly. Instead of sugar I used 1/2cup of honey, not overly sweet so next time I will use 3/4cups and I also added choc chips to help with that craving!  SO easy and simple to make. Will use this as my permanent muffin recipe!!!

Really great recipe. I used one mashed banana and about a cup of banana chips and it turned out delicious! A bit chewy in texture, but it tastes great still and is a good alternative to the regular banana muffins.

Big Hit with the kids - easy to make.  I also added a 1/4 of applesauce.  I had an extra banana and just threw it in.  My son requested I put Cinnamon in the recipe (1 tsp) and to my surprise, it was very good.  Moist and tasty.

Made the basic mods suggested by other reviewers (flour, sugar, spices, applesauce) but still not a big fan -- good flavour, but dreadful texture. Won't be making this recipe again.

These muffins are really good!  I substituted egg beaters for the eggs, I also used half the sugar and added 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg, 1tsp vanilla, and 1tsp cinnamon!  I will definetly make these again and I recommend them to anyone!  My kids enjoyed them as well.

Like many others I found this to be a great base recipe.  I followed other's example and added a banana, some apple sauce and milk.  I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  For half of the batch I also added about 1/2 cup of crushed up cherry vanilla granola.  And made them into muffin tops instead (half big, half small) these were a huge hit!  The cherry vanilla granola ones were the bomb!  I think thee next time I made the regular ones I'll add a little brown sugar there was a layer of flavor that was missing.

Mine turned out bad as well.  Flat tops.  Burned outsides.  Undercooked insides.  Ugh.  Sadly, I'm out of bananas now and just dying for a muffin.

Excellent!  I only had 2 bananas, so I added a small container of apple sauce, along with a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I made mini-muffins and they came out super moist.  My 7 year old gobbled them up even though he doesn't like banana bread.

I liked the recommendations from Flooeyblue, so I followed her additions/ modifications to the recipe. I really like these! I was trying to find some breakfast receipes for my banana-loving 16 month old and these are perfect. I give four stars because of all of the changes to the recipe, but I since I am not an adventurous baker/ cook, I love seeing how others modify recipes.

I used a little more banana than the recipe called for just because that's how many bananas I happened to pull out of the freezer & thaw--they turned out delicious! They tasted just like my grandma's (much more fattening) banana cupcakes but were a bit more dense.

These were good, but I changed them quite a bit. I used cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice for flavoring.  Some sourcream and applesauce for extra moisture.  Brown sugar and whole wheat flour.  They were still a little dry, I think because my bananas weren't over ripe.  But very yummy for being made with whole wheat.

Great recipe. For some reason I didn't read the reviews ahead of making these. Had I done that, I would have added cinnamon and vanilla. I did, however, cut the sugar in half and my family LOVES these. I also subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour. YUM, YUM, YUMMY!!!

I LOVED IT!!!
I used 4 very ripe bananas (just because that's what I had)and then followed the directions (I did use whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose).  I put in 1/2 cup of walnuts and my daughter was snacking on some Ocean Spray Crasins so we threw in 1/2 Cup of them too!  They came out EXCELLENT!!  They weren't dry or chewy.  Very good!  I am always looking for healthy, portable breakfast ideas for my 5 year old.  She gets on the school bus at 7am and eats breakfast on the bus, so these are great!!

I put about 1/4 cup into each baking cup and I got 12 good-sized muffins.

Thanks!!

I usually make a recipe according to it's directions first, then make changes the next time.  However, this time I followed some of the suggestions other raters talked about, and they turned out great!  I enjoyed this recipe, and love it's versatility.  

I added the applesauce, and omitted one egg.  I added thecinnamon, oatmeal, wheat flour, vanilla, and applesauce.  I forgot to add nuts, so I sprinkled them on top, along with brown sugar and oatmeal.  I used brown sugar in the recipe, only 1/2 cup.  I think next time I'll boost that back up to 3/4 cup.  I like my muffins a bit sweeter.  

Great recipe!

These were great! I used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour + 1/2 AP flour, added 1/2 cup apple sauce, 1/2 tsp. almond and vanilla extract, used 4 bananas, and used splenda instead of sugar. Also dropped dough by the spoonful onto a greased cookie sheet, so I got muffin tops. YUM!

Really yummy! Mine were a tad bit on the dry side, so next time I'll be sure to add another banana to the batter, and probably some walnuts. A great, healthy recipe!

These look so pretty, but were too heavy and chewy for my taste.  I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1 tsp vanilla since other reviewers said they came out dry, so maybe I added too much liquid, but their consistency was really dense, and they stuck to the papers really badly.

I also used splenda and sub. wheat flour for super healthy
my kids love these
one note-don't use paper liners they stick to the muffin if they are cold, if warmed first paper comes off

My family absolutely loved these muffins. I added a 1/4 cup of milk because the batter was kind of thick, I also mixed a little bit of oats and brown sugar and put it on the top of the muffins before putting them in the oven. Thanks for the great low fat recipe.

These are wonderful muffins and they are very moist.  I substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat, 1/4 cup of skim milk, and used only a 1/2 cup of sugar.

The batter was so thick that I, too added some skim milk. I found the muffins rather dense and chewy. But they are guilt free with no fat.

They came out great, added some cinnamon, otherwise followed the recipe.  Very tasty, nice for a low fat snack.  The only problem I had was that they stuck a little to the muffin papers.

These muffins were easy to prepare.  I don't think I'd make them again.  They are a bit gummy for my taste. After reading a few reviews I decided to add an extra banana and beat the eggs til light. I also topped the batter with cinamon and sugar, which gave them a little more punch.

I'm  rating these 5 stars because if you bake them according to the suggestions of several reviewers-including myself-they are quite nice! I, actually, enjoy the texture of low fat muffins as they  are not so "cupcake" like.  It feels like a healthy breakfast and not a dessert, you know? If you enjoy the cakey texture of a high fat muffin, I don't think these muffins will suit your liking.  They taste perfect for a low fat muffin.  Believe me, I know a low fat muffin disaster and these are FAR from that.  They have all the redeeming qualities of a good low fat muffin.  They rose beautifully, taste great, have a hearty but not dry texture, and they look pretty.  Just don't omit the extra banana or milk and you're good to go!

Good, quick, healthy recipe. Needs an extra banana and 1/4 cup of milk, as others suggested - otherwise, there is not enough liquid (thus the 4 stars). I added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips, which made them extra good. Will make again!

i just keep buying bananas because my boyfriend cant eat these fast enough! My tip for bananas is that they dont need to be really really ripe- just squeeze some ripe ones before you peel them. I always use 4 for this recipe and the 1/4 cup milk

These are great for being so lowfat and low cal. I added the 1/4 c. milk and cinnamon per other reviewers...used 4 egg whites instead of 2 eggs. VERY good for what you get and not dry at all! Thank you Thank you Thank you - I love banana bread and muffins and now I have something to enjoy while getting back to goal. Wonder if I could convert this to banana bread?

Good recipe... to make it moist I added a 1/2 a cup applesauce and 1/4 cup skim milk. I also exchanged half of the flour for whole wheat flour, cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and added vanilla and cinnamon. Yum! :) You can also add dark chocolate chips for a sweet treat as well!

This was so easy.  I was home because of the fires in San Diego and needed to do something.  I had the banannas in the freezer from a few weeks. Defrosted them overnite and began the process.  I made a few more subsitures. I subs. 1/2 cup of wheat flour.  I also substituted splenda for sugar.  I didn;t have any baking soda so I used baking powder and it was just fine.  This was awesome.

These muffins are fantastic. They were so moist and tender even after a week, not crumbly like some muffins get. I sprinkled a few walnuts on top before baking, but that and adding another 1/2 banana I had on hand were the only changes I made. I also baked a batch of gluten free, using GF baking mix and a teaspoon of xantham gum, and they came out great too! Very nice texture. Will definitely become a permanent part of my recipe repertoire.

Definitely a healthy muffin..but a delicious one! I made these adjustments: 2 cups wheat flour (instead of white), 4 ripe bananas (instead of 3), I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp vanilla, replaced the white sugar with brown and after I spooned the batter into the muffin cups I placed about 1 tbsp of sliced almonds on top of each. They turned out great! Made about 11 good-sized muffins. I will make this again.

I joined just to rate this it was that great. I am addicted to these. I did about 1/4 tsp salt instead of 1, and added 1/4 tsp vanilla, and 2 tsp flax oil, and a bit of heavy whipping cream to the egg mix, they turned out delicious, moist and light. Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT!  Again, following the other reviewers, I added half a cup of brown sugar/splenda (more brown sugar than sweetner), overdid the milk a bit and added 1/3 cup.  I think it's imparative to add nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla or they wouldn't have much flavour.  I added a tsp of each and also added a 4th banana. Finally I figured that since the rest of the muffin was relatively low fat, I added a crumble to the top from the banana crumb muffins recipe.  My boyfriend is having thirds!!

Delicious, quick and easy to make. I substituted whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the flour and I added 1/2 cup applesauce and some allspice. They didn't stick to the muffin pan and they are very good warm.

These were good.  There wasn't necessarily anything overly exciting happening in the flavor department, but they were a good, basic banana muffin.  They also slid right out of the muffin cups.

Moist, but chewy. Stuck to the muffin liners pretty badly... I even added milk, as advised.

I make ALOT of muffins and these were by far the BEST ever banana muffins.  I used 4 very ripe bananas, 1/2 cup sugar and added choc chips and walnuts.  I also used my silicone muffin cups so the muffins came out REALLY easy.

Yummy! To make the muffins healthier, I used 1 cup all-purpose and 1 cup whole wheat flour; 2 egg whites instead of regular eggs to lower cholesterol content; and a 1/2 cup  applesauce to makeup for the absent yolks.  Made them for Mother's Day (Mom said they were a bit dry), but after a day, I think they taste fantastic!

The "batter" was more like dough, I could have kneaded it. I added milk and cinnamon and they turned out pretty dense, but very tasty for a light muffin. Also, they had to be in the oven a few minutes longer to get cooked through, but that made the outside nice and crispy. Thanks!

I only tried this once but I made a double batch. Something might have gone wrong because the batter was so dry I had to add some milk to even be able to stir it and soak up all the dry ingredients.  The muffins were very dense (though not bad tasting) and I tossed many of them.  I wouldn't make it again although I applaud the effort.

I changed the recipe a bit - 2 bananas and about 5 oz. of prune puree (baby food) - these muffins were surprisingly moist, none of that weird non-fat rubbery texture. My only complaint - I would have liked some spices - maybe cinnamon and nutmeg...Considering how low-fat and low-calorie these muffins are, I will definately keep this recipe.

For a lower fat/calorie muffin, these were pretty good.  I added a dash of vanilla to the batter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The muffins rose nicely in the oven and didn't sink upon cooling.  A decent texture with a great banana flavor, too.  Thanks!

Very tasty recipe!  I read the earlier reviews before making and added the apple sauce, vanilla, cinnamon and topped with brown sugar as recommended.  They did stick to the paper muffin cups, but other then that, very tasty!  My husband, 2 year old daughter and 10 month old son LOVE them!  Will make again!

Very, very good.  I did take the suggestions of some previous reviewers and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 4 oz applesauce. Also topped each muffin prior to baking with brown sugar.  Next time I may add 1/4 cup margarine although the muffins are just wonderful.

Beautiful! I too used four bananas, and added vanilla and cinnamon. Oh yes, and I dusted the tops with brown sugar, yum! I actually got sixteen muffins, but I think my muffin tins might be a bit small. Can't wait to make these again!

Great recipe.  The first time I made this I found it to be too sweet and a little dry so I substituted 1/2 cup of splenda for the sugar and added 2 tsp of pumpkin butter for moisture.  Also, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  It turned out perfect.  I will definitely make it again and try adding chopped walnuts.

Great, healthy and delicious. I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, 0.5 cups sugar, a tablespoon of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon. I also pureed the bananas and eggs with a food processor, I think that helped keep the muffins moist. YUMMY!

VERY GOOD RECIPE ** Okay -- So I added 4 tbsps of sour cream for added moisture, I also added a handful of chopped pecans and substituted splenda for sugar. These variations add protein and cut some of those carbs out. This recipe is also salicylate free when you dont add cinnamon and nutmeg.

These really turned out good...I'm impressed.  For a recipe with no added fat, these really tasted good.  I did alter the recipe a little bit: I used 1/2 C. egg subsitute instead of 2 eggs, 1 C. wheat flour and 1 C. white flour, and I used splenda instead of sugar.  I found that the batter was a little too thick, so I added a few tablespoons of fat free vanilla yogurt and maybe 1/4 C. soy milk.  Finally, a muffin that I can eat two of without feeling guilty!

Admittedly I'm a bit of a muffin addict but I really did like these muffins. They do come out quite dense so I think next time I might try beating the eggs and folding in the rest of the ingredients but there's nothing wrong with the muffins the way they are.  Cut them open and add a topping or just eat them as they are.

If you're finding the batter too stiff or dry try adding some sour cream (3 tablespoons) or for extra flavour try adding vanilla or banana extract (1 1/4 teaspoons) and/or ground cinnamon (2 teaspoons).

These muffins were amazing!  The only modifications I made were I added two more bananas because mine were the tiny ones, dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and I added about 14 cup of water.  (The batter looked like it was too dry)  I also added a mixture of  oats lightly sprayed with margarine and about 1 tsp of brown sugar to the tops of these muffins, it made them look store-bought.  The kids thought they were the best.

Very good.  I only had two small bananas on hand, so I added about 3/4 cup canned pumpkin and some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Adding walnuts would have made it perfect, but I was out of those too.  Not too dense or too low-fat tasting at all.

Great low fat recipe!  The muffins are not greasy like traditional banana muffins.  When I first started to mix the flour with the banana mixture I thought the muffins would be dry but they turned out quite moist.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and some walnuts as others had suggested.  I think this recipe would be a little on the bland side without adding them.  This recipe is a keeper (especially after comparing the nutritional information for other banana muffin recipes)!

For a "lighter" banana muffin these were very tasty. My husband, who usually won't eat anything that's low-fat, actually ate these and enjoyed them. I will definitely be making them again.

I was surprised by how well these turned out.  They were moist and very tasty.  Like other reviewers, I added cinnamon and nutmeg - as well as a pinch of ground cardomom.  And I also substituted Splenda for sugar to make a lower calorie muffin.  Since I made a half recipe, I used my convection toaster oven to bake them and it took only 10 minutes.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

There was not enough moisture in this recipe by itself. I added 1 cup of mashed blueberries and 1 tablespoon of honey and they came out perfect!

So I made two batches and for both batches, I added an extra banana based on other reviews.  My first batch turned out ok but the muffin completely stuck to the cupcake liner so there was less muffin to eat.  My second batch (where I added walnuts) turned out worse.  The muffin was denser and was glued to the liner. 

Overall the flavor was light but the overall results were not what I hoped for.  Unfortunately this won't be going to my favorites.

these were great!  I always have bananas that need to be used up, and this recipe was simple and will be my go-to next time I need to use overripe bananas.

Made as directed except I used white whole wheat flour and trivia in place of the sugar. Batter was very dry so I added a snack size apple sauce, like suggested in other reviews and the batter was much creamier. They came out tasty, filling, but a bit dry. Maybe I will add some milk next time. 
Will make again!

I did 1/4 c sugar 2/4 cup brown sugar. added vanilla, 1/4 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 c applesauce and did 3 egg whites in place of the 2 eggs. Thanks for the recipe to get a basic idea! I feel they would have been too dry without the added ingredients!

Once I adapted the recipe, they were GREAT and I plan to use the recipe again! Having taken into account suggestions from previous reviews, I made the following changes : added 1/4 of 2% milk, 1/2 cup of 0% fat Greek yoghurt (I had no apple sauce) only brown sugar, 1/2 cup of walnut pieces (quantity hadn’t been specified) and 2.5 tsp of pumpkin spice. Muffins were awesome -nice and moist!

I halved the recipe as I only had 4 medium sized banana. I also added half a teaspoon of baking powder, to which I'm glad because my 6 muffins rose beautifully. I filled about 2/3 of each silicon muffin cups, which I did not grease. Mine came out like flavorful banana bread instead of the usual muffins that I made, probably because I overmixed the batter, which I could have avoided if I added milk or applesauce, as there were bits of flour that were unmixed (but once the batter were clear of flour bits, it was just nice - not too thick or runny). 

I was worried this would come out dry/burnt but it didn't, I think the key is OVERRIPE bananas - the ones I used were too soft to peel and eat, but were still good/edible enough for baking. I imagine if I used firm bananas these would turn out dense and dry like some other reviewers noted. I will make these again only if I have overripe bananas on hand (and next time I'll sprinkle some brown sugar on top because I like a good crust, and these came out too light/yellow for me)

Had to modify out of necessity:  Used 4 ripe bananas, 2 c. plus 2 TBSP self-rising flour, no salt , no baking soda, Added  1/2 c. applesauce, used 1/2 c. brown sugar (plus a little for the top with the spice), added  2 tsp Penzey's  Pie Spice ( a blend of cinnamon,mace, ginger, nutmeg, anise seed and clove). 1/2 tsp vanilla. Sprinkle top with a shake of spice and  a dab brown sugar.   Made  12 full muffins, in a greased tin, they rise nicely. They are excellent. IF  I could have nuts  they'd have been better yet.  Great recipe, thanks!

I made the recipe exactly as written but added nuts and after reading what others have said, I added one of those kids lunch size applesauce.  The muffins were so moist and delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Awesome, light recipe! I only had two over ripe bananas so I added 5oz of unsweetened apple sauce and about a teaspoon of cinnamon. Totally yummy, thanks for the inspiration.

I think this was a great recipe because it was good and versatile.  I used this as a base recipe and then made several minor changes and it still came out great, without difficulty.

I put in 1C white flour and 1C oat flour. I added 1/2 tsp cinn. and 1 tsp vanilla.  I used previously frozen bananas and only 1/2 C sugar. (The taste test at that point was fine.) Then, I added 5T of a blueberry/plum sauce I made a few days earlier (blueberries, plums, water, sugar and lemon juice).  

Don't feel you have to do all that, I just had them on hand and felt like experimenting.  I like the contrasting taste, since it was a bit tart.

Because I used previously frozen bananas and the berry sauce, I didn't have any problems with the batter being too dry.  It wasn't overly sweet, and at the end of the day, only 3 of the 14 remain.  (Our landlord, who traditionally refuses sweets, not only ate two, but readily took two to go.)  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I took all of the advice from Heather's review below except the additional banana. I added 4oz applesauce, 1tsp vanilla, and 1tsp cinnamon. Also topped with some granola mixed with almond slivers and last was brown sugar. Turned out positively delicious, no sticking.

I just made this recipe and the muffins are delicious.  I followed the advice of other's here  and added 4oz unsweetened applesauce, 4 bananas, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon, used less sugar (a little more than 1/2 cup) but changed up the flour (I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup spelt flour) and added sliced almonds to the top with a little sprinkling of brown sugar.   My only dislike was that the outside of the muffin stuck to the paper .....so I am thinking next time I will just eliminate the paper muffin cups and spray the tin.

i read many reviews here and had some skim milk ready...  turned out that i didnt need even a drop!!  perhaps my 2 bananas are big enough!  i halved the recipe and used 2 bananas (instead of 1.5).  i mashed the bananas really well and obtained much "fluid" needed.  i cut sugar and salt as suggested, add 1/2 tsp baking powder, otherwise sticked to the recipe. the batter was so "liquid" that i even thought about throwing in more flour.  finally i didnt, instead i let them stayed in oven for 30+ mins in total.  my 6 muffins are so moist inside, to my surprise!!  just that it really sticked to the muffin paper cups...  i think i will throw away my original recipe with veggie oil and stick to this one from now on!!

** this morning, i popped one into the microwave for 10 seconds... it becomes warm and nice again, and one more plus -- it doesn't stick to the muffin paper cup that badly anymore!

Just made these for breakfast because I didn't have butter for other recipes. Stuck to the recipe but added 4oz unsweetened apple sauce, 1 tsp vanilla to my eggs and bananas. Also added some cinnamon and ground cloves to the dry ingredients. Perfectly moist! Going to make these more often

Very simple to make and taste delicious. I followed advice from others; added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla flavoring., 4 ripe bananas.  I was able to make 12 large muffins, the crowns were beautiful. Thanks for the recipe.

The batter was heavy, and the muffins came out sort of gummy and they stuck to the bottom. They were also pretty lacking in flavor... nevertheless, they were still quite tasty! Next time I make these I'll modify the recipe a bit to try and make them lighter and more flavorful.

They just came out of the oven and I've already eaten two! (Don't be mis-guided by  my 4 star rating instead of 5). They look and taste great although they are more dense than traditional muffin recipes..    I substituted 1/2 c. vanilla greek yogurt for the eggs, as suggested by another reviewer , added 1 t. vanilla. and a few dashes of cinnamon  They will certainly make a great snack or a healthy alternative to dessert.  Although I really liked them I  think I will try a few other  adjustments to see if I can get  the texture a bit lighter.  Even if i don't, I will definitely make them this way again!

It stuck to the paper liners, it tasted like nothing, but texture was good. I used 4 bananas, 3 eggs, 1c white flour, 1 c wheat, a tbsp vanilla extract and some cinnamon. It could definitely use some brown sugar to improve the taste.

Delicious muffins! don't make the mistake and add the brown sugar to the muffin mix - that is meant for the crumb topping.  Because of that, my muffins were too sweet.  Other than that, they were divine.  Followed the advice of adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, loved that fall flavor.  Also want to try with applesauce for lower calories.

I followed advice as well: I added 4 oz of unsweetened applesauce, an extra banana, and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I substituted 1/2 cup oatmeal for a 1/2 cup of the flour. I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4--1/4 of brown and 1/4 of white.

Great recipe! I followed the original recipe and added a few things... I used 5 bananas (instead of 3), added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the flour/sugar mixture, and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup cinnamon apple sauce to the banana/egg mixture. I also sprinkled on light brown sugar to the tops of the muffin halfway during baking!! So delicious!!! YUM YUM! I will be making again!! :)

I adjusted as for 1 1/2dozen by changing servings to 15, so I could have a few more muffins. I substituted 2c whole wheat flour and 1 c all purpose white flour, 1 c  agave syrup for sugar and used 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda.  Added 1/3 c apple sauce, 1 tsp each vanilla and cinnamon, used 5 bananas.  These were yummy and still not too heavy.

I have made these several times and with each batch I have tried different variations to find the perfect recipe my whole family loves.  The changes I made, used 3 ripe bananas plus one grated apple.  1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of oats.  1/2 cup light brown sugar (can go a bit less also). Added 1 ts. cinnamon and 1 ts vanilla extract, also added a handful of mini choc chips.  My family absolutely loves these and they are usually gone in 2 days.

This recipe is amazing. I was afraid it was going to be dry and it was so moist and delicious! I think it taste the best warm! I used four small bananas instead of three and added a cup of finely copped walnuts. I would make this again anytime! Also I only had to cool for 20 minutes and filled the cupcake tins to the top.

Wanted to use up the last of my bananas and walnuts and this was the perfect recipe. I followed the advice of others by adding 4oz unsweetened applesauce, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and sprinkled a few on top. My home smelled wonderful and it was a perfect afternoon snack.

I just made these for my wife and young children and WE ALL AGREE THAT THESE ARE DELICIOUS!  I used ALL ORGANIC INGREDIENTS & also added about 1/4 teaspoon Cinnamon, a dash of Nutmeg, 1-2 drops of: Lemon oil, Almond oil, Vanilla & 3 extra tablespoons of Sugar.  8 might try some applesauce, extra bananas or some almond milk next time to produce a more moist muffin.  

Thank You, Thank You, Thank You for Sharing your FANTASTIC RECIPE!

This recipe was quite good! Like other reviewers, I found the batter too dry at first, so I added an extra banana, which seemed to help. A 1/2 cup of chocolate chips somehow found their way into the batter as well--oops. ;) My family definitely likes this recipe! Though the muffins came out a little chewy, they definitely taste good and are probably something I would make again.

Good idea starter for when you are out of butter. I was feeling adventurous and changed it up a bit. The reviews mentioned dryness, so I added vanilla protein shake and almond milk, plus one extra banana and (this will sound crazy, but it was delicious) goat cheese. 

I had looked at some other banana bread recipes and decided to add 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp. baking soda, cinnamon, hemp powder (for added protein) and chocolate chips.

Perhaps I changed this enough to post my own recipe. But thank you for the basic starter idea. The result of my muffin experiment was tasty, moist and wonderful.

I loved this recipe, and so did my little siblings. I made a few changes to the recipe though. I added 1/4 cup almond milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon, and an extra banana. I also reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup, part white and brown sugar. I sprinkle a tiny bit more brown sugar on top. It made 12 muffins, and took a little longer to bake. Theywere really fluffy and good without butter. For a little extra, I made some maple glaze.

A little dry so I added the following:
I added an extra banana and vanilla extract and cinnamon. I also used baking powder not baking soda. I added 1/2 cup pecans.


I also added banana slices on top of some and chocolate chips on top.
I tried to put the chocolate chips inside but they are so moist already it didn't work out so i just put them on top.

This recipe is so simple and gives brilliant muffin results. I added the quarter cup of skimmed milk recommended by another as I like a runny batter. I added cinnamon as well for a little spice. This is a good base recipe to build on :-)

Just made these and had to substitute 1 tsp baking soda with 3 tsp baking powder so I was a little nervous. and then added only about a half teaspoon of salt and added 1/4 cup fat free milk, 4 bananas, and cinnamon on the top before baking. They turned out very yummy. I can't wait until my friend wakes up to eat one!! :) I wanted to surprise him and I love that there was no oil or butter in the recipe but I'm sure he'll slather them with butter anyway haha.

I had a lot of fun making these! I was looking for an easy healthy muffin recipe for breakfast on-the-go and these were definitely winners. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added another banana, half a cup of applesauce, a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla, used whole wheat flower, and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  I think the next time I may omit the vanilla.  The best part was how amazing they made my kitchen smell while they were baking.

These were so yummy! I made them in a mini muffin pan and it made just about 4 dozen. I used 4 bananas rather then 3 but other then that kept everything the same. Very good and healthy.

My 8 year old helped me make these muffins and we both loved them.  We did modify the recipe some based on the previous reviews.  We added 1/2 cup of applesauce, used 4 bananas instead of 3, and we added a litle cinnamon and some pecans.  We will definately be making more of these.

I cut the recipe in half because I only had 2 bananas. After reading other reviews that said they turned out a little dry, I took other reviewers advice and added 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1 tsp vanilla. I also added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts; and topped the muffins with a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon. The muffins tasted very good and were actually pretty moist. It made 8 muffins. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first recipe that caught my eye regarding making banana muffins, and especially since they were so healthy! I added some soymilk instead of the skim milk that the others mentioned about. And my husband, who loves a healthy taste, took them to work so he could snack on them. I am definitely going to make these more often in the future, and will try to use some brown sugar, as the others suggested for next time. Thanks for the great recipe! It is something I am looking forward to making again and again!

I love this recipe, we always have ripe bananas in the house and this is a great way to use them up - I do however think that the muffins come out slightly dry, but that doesn't stop us from eating them!

Very good recipe - I like the low fat content.  The only thing is they come out a little different each time - but not a big problem - they are eaten all up anyway.

I made this recipe and added the vanilla and milk as others suggested. I thought they were great. I have lost 70 pounds in the last year but still like to have a treat every now and then, so this is great!  I did not have Splenda, but next time I will use Splenda to take out more calories.

This light banana muffin recipe is great!
I took the advise of other and added some milk to prevent dryness.  My approach was the muffin tops.  My co-workers will the a true test.

Too dense and not as much banana flavor as we like. Needs some milk to moisten it up and more leavening to lighten them up.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I used four bananas instead of three along with 4oz. of unsweetened applesauce. This gave the muffins the extra moisture that my family and I like. What I also liked about this recipe is that there is no butter, oil or milk. This is great not only for the fat value but also because I am allergic the cow's milk and soy. Will be making this regularly for my family and friends!!! Thank you!

I made this recipe exactly as it's written, and the muffins turned out a little dry.  If I try them again, I'll add applesauce to moisten them up a bit as some of the other reviews suggest.

They turned out moist and a little dense. We will make these again. Very good for breakfast.

Perfect! Perfectly simple, perfectly easy and not so much guilt as regualr muffins. All I did different was add a good teaspoon+ of vanilla, and I DID add the optional walnuts. They are gone already.

I made a fe wmodifications and they still turned out great. I used half whole wheat bread flour and half regular white flour. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on the top (looked great, though made them sticky to handle). Very yummy lowfat recipe!

These are not as flavourful as those yummy fat-filled muffins, but are much healthier. They are tasty and best of all---3 points if you make them into 11 or 12 muffins. I followed some previous suggestions and used 1/2 brown sugar as well as vanilla, cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. I will definately be making them again. Thanks for the recipe.

It's fast, easy and they taste great!  It's also great that they don't have a lot of "extras added".
