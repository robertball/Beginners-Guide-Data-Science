This was the best hushpuppy recipe I've ever tried!  I added chopped jalapenos for an extra kick; next time I think I'll add some corn.  They were so light and fluffy--not heavy or doughy at all.   No need to keep them warm in the oven--we were eating them as soon as they came out of the fryer!

I love hush puppies and I thought these were great.   I added a little cayenne pepper,extra salt and paprika.  I liked this recipe because I don't keep self-rising flour on hand and I didn't want to have to think about the conversion with salt & baking soda because it was already taken care of in the recipe.  Also, I used plain milk and added a little vinegar to make buttermilk.  Even with the substitutions, they came out delicious.

I ended up having to add about 2/3 cup more of flour and cornmeal (mixed with equal amounts of each)because the batter was very thin and the hushpuppies ended up resembling funnel cakes instead of hushpuppies! I liked the flavor, especially with the corn, which is something I've never done before. I cut back the sugar by half (I used 2 tablespoons) because I don't like them that sweet and it was just enough to enhance the corn. I wish I had added a little more salt, though, because I thought it really needed it.

My husband's from Louisiana, and swears that these hush puppies are the very best he's ever eaten!  Followed directions to a T, and will never make another recipe!

These tasted nice and light. Not like the average hush puppy that's all dense and cakey. We liked them, but they are ONLY good the day you make them. So you might want to half the recipe if you're only feeding a few people because they made a TON. I didn't add the green onion (I didn't have any).

WARNING: These cook VERY fast. I'm talking seconds. Keep them small so the insides cook without burning the outside. Also, cut back the sugar to about 1 tablespoon. Double the corn meal and flour. And allow the batter to sit while your oil heats up. It will thicken to more usable texture. The final taste was pretty good, what few that were not incinerated. That and the sweetness kept this from being a five star recipe.

My husband and I are both from North Carolina and these are like the ones we would get in seafood restaurants. I was really craving these because we now live in Oklahoma so we don't have hushpuppies here like we do in the south. I'm glad that I came across this recipe it reminds me of home. Thank you Mama Smith for this quick and easy recipe ( these were great with honey butter).

Making these hush puppies right now. They are fantastic!  Had to sample with the honey butter I made. Just added some fresh chives otherwise made them exactly as written. Thanks for the great recipe.

Speaking as someone who loves hush puppies, but had never tried to make them until just a couple hours ago, I thought this recipe was great! The fritters turned out perfectly light and fluffy! I also thought the ratio of salt to sugar was right for the average person's taste. So, this was my take on it: I minced the onion and green onion together with a stick of celery (keep in mind I made a double batch) for a little extra homey, rich flavor and about a third of a poblano pepper. I'm not all that into spicy things, but it added a little somethin' to the recipe. I also folded in frozen corn. Last, unless you're a deep frying pro, I would suggest using an icecream scoop to release and drop the batter quickly into the oil. Using a spoon didn't work well because it just kinda dribbled in little by little, cooking unevenly and making my hush puppies look a mess!

Awesome!  I will be making these again and again.  They could use a little more salt.  My husband tried adding a pinch of garlic salt, and thought they were excellent!  A must try!

This recipe has a great flavor---but don't put the sugar in it. It makes the batter so easy to burn. Knowing that going in, I halved the amount of sugar--but I still ended up with burning puppies in the pan. I lowered the heat of the oil, but at that point it was too late and every batch burned or didn't cook through. I tried frying smaller sizes of batter, but at that point I was just "done" and gave up. The batter itself is nice, and were it not for the issue with the sugar, I'd give it a five.

These were really great. They were light yet flavorful with a great texture.The green onion added a really tasty punch to them. I used a deep fryer & they came out perfectly round. I am a fan of the recipe as it is and my family loved them with our dinner of spare ribs, coleslaw & potato salad.

I'm a Northern girl who moved to Louisiana.   I've had some good hush puppies down here but this recipe is fan-freaking-tastic.  My husband gobbles them right up.  These aren't quite as dense as the ones I've had at some local restaurants but I love that.  I do decrease the sugar to a tablespoon and add some sweet frozen corn.  These are to die for.  One of my favorite finds on this site.  Thank you!

I made this recipe to compliment fried fish, gumbo, potato salad, etc. it was a big hit. The batter was very wet, so I did increase the flour and corn meal. I probably added another 1/4 to 1/2 cup each. Then they dropped beautifully into the hot oil and fried up delicious! Also, I made the buttermilk by putting 1 TBSP vinegar into the measuring cup, then adding the milk up to a cup. Then wait five minutes and you have a buttermilk substitute.

I don't have a deep fryer so I pan fried them into little pancakes.  They were Delicious.  I did add some creole seasoning.  I ate with the catfish recipe by the same cook.  Thanks.  Next time I will add corn and cheese.

Tonight I made this recipe and quickly discovered, after making it, that it was the most delicious I had ever tried. This was not just a glop fried in oil but the flavors of corn came through wonderfully. I did make one change which was to use Himalayan Pink salt instead of using regular table salt. Outside of that I followed the recipe to a tee.

Thank you,
Christopher

Heaven, I'm in Heaven.....Need I say more?  These are exquisite.  Like others wrote, light and crunchy.  I added a jalapeno pepper and can't really taste it, so next time, I think I'll stick with cayenne pepper to really kick it up a notch.  Just a note, though.  At 365 degrees they brown very quickly (and I didn't add sugar).  I found that they didn't need to go the whole 6 minutes.  If you cut into them to see if they're done, they may not be totally, but they continue to cook after being removed from the grease so don't wory too much about that.  These are absolutely amazing.

Flavor and texture were good.  I added some ground cayenne, garlic powder, pepper, and additional salt.  Next time I'll try with jalapeño.

These were absolutely delicious and moist! I added a half can of corn because we like it that way but the batter is yummy as is. Trust the teaspoon drop measure, they really do puff up in the oil!!

OMG!  These were AHHH-MAAAA-ZING!!!  This was my first attempt at making Hush Puppies and it was a success and I will look no further for a recipe!  This is it!  These were perfect!  We couldn't stop eating them!  The first batch that came out of the fryer were a little dark, so we turned the heat down a bit and the rest were all perfection!  And even the dark ones were good.  We didn't leave in for 6-10 minutes, were done way faster then that.  After they came out of the fryer we sprinkled with salt and that is all they needed!  It does make a ton even with all of us pigging out on them we still had some left, had to save room for the Crab Legs too!  I did add some Tony's Creole Seasoning to the dry mix before adding the wet mix, but I don't know if it really made that big of a difference.  They only thing that I changed at all, was I only used abut a quarter of an onion chopped up really small because I was a little leery of using that much onion, I don't like raw onion and I wasn't sure if it would get cooked, I feel like the amount I used worked perfect for us.  This is definitely going in the book!  Try these, you won't be disappointed!!!  We are already planning our next meal with these!

I thought these were fantastic! Only gave 4 stars because the batter was really thin and couldn't hold their shape. All I did was add an additional 1/2 cup each of flour and cornmeal. I also added one finely chopped jalapeño, and since I didn't have any onion I added 1.5 tsp of onion powder to the dry part of the mix. I used a cookie dough scoop and they came out perfectly, just like the restaurants I remember in Maryland.

These were light and airy. I have never had a homemade hush puppy. My kitchen smelled like the State Fair. The smell even lingered the next day until I opened both doors. I opted to use the large saucepan technique, but really had to keep adjusting the temperature according to my thermometer. I just dont have a deep fryer. I did slightly less than 1" of oil, as I wasn't going to toss a quart of it. So, I am probably partially to blaim. I suggest a deep fryer, as these quite honestly soaked up way too much oil by the saucepan technique. After reading all the reviews, I made a half a recipe and got about 20~22 and used only 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar. It seemed like the right amount. Note, if making these, and as another reviewer suggested, they do not reheat well. So, eat hot.

According to my fiancée (born and raised in Louisiana) these are the hush puppies that all others must be judged by. I use plain2% milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk. Make sure to use enough salt or they will be a tiny hi bland. I sprinkle in about a teaspoon of Don's seasoning (you can buy it online-Dons is in Scott Louisiana and i use the seasoning in almost everything! These hush puppies are addictive!!!

I just made these hushpuppies and they are WONDERFUL! I didnt have any buttermilk on hand so I used regular milk and I made a small mistake (added baking powder then added baking soda) but these came out fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside!!! I love hush puppies (im from Southeast TX) and I have tried several recipes but this one is the one I am going to keep!!  YUMM-O! Thank You for the recipe!

I decided to half the recipe. I used a medium cookie dough scoop which is about 2 tbsp. Half the recipe made 23 hushpuppies that were about 2” diameter balls. It took about 3-4 mins at 360 oil.

That being said, I opted to add a 11 oz can of Mexicorn to the half batch. It was perhaps a bit much so would recommend only doing a whole can for a whole batch. I didn't add onion, but I did add about a tbsp. of onion powder.  The batter does thicken up quite a bit if you let it sit while the oil heats but I still added another tbsp of corn meal to it to hold it together as I scooped. 

These hush puppies are fantastic! They are so pillowy and soft and are not sweet even with the sugar. I will definitely be making these again and again!!

I didn't feel like wasting the oil to fry, when we were baking the fish, so I mixed this up and put it in mini muffin pans. Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes. Nigh unto perfection!

This was my first attempt at making hush puppies so I wasn't sure what to expect. I made them as a side dish because I looked up traditional "fish fry foods" & this was on every list. My husband's friends LOVED them! I told them I wasn't sure what hush puppies were supposed to taste like & they said I nailed it! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I am from Louisiana too, and these were as good as the ones I eat in my favorite restaurant.  They are light and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  One note, The recipe does not specify, but I used white cornmeal instead of the usual yellow cornmeal.

I made these hush puppies as written except I added to many onions by mistake. They were still good; light, good flavor and texture. Will make again.

This was perfect.  Thank you so much, Mama Smith, for a recipe the family will love and look forward to again and again.  Only change I made was use 100% whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose.  Perfect texture and taste.  All of us loved these.

This was my first attempt at hush puppies. I made them to serve as a side dish at a crab fest, and I thought they came out pretty well. I fried them in a deep fryer so the grease wouldn't get all over my kitchen, and that worked out well.

I enjoyed the texture of the hushpuppies but it didn't have enough salt or flavor.  I used 1 Tablespoon of sugar, no green onions, and added one jalapeno.  Next time, I will add at least 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 jalapenos,  3/4 cup onion,  and the 1/4 cup corn. Thank you for the recipe!

I made it exactly as listed and couldn't have more pleased. I have never fried before so this was out of my wheelhouse but I really wanted restaurant tasting hush puppies. They were fabulous! I froze the leftovers and hope they'll be good reheated.

These hush puppies are wonderful - light & fluffy, not heavy like some.  I made these exactly by the recipe.  Maybe added more onion, but that's it.  We loved them!  Will be making again soon.  Thank you!

I didn't add the corn because I thought I would not like that.  I had to add an extra 1/2c of flour and 1/2c of cornmeal and also added extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder. 

These ended up light and fluffy next time I will add more salt because I found they didn't have a ton of flavor.

These were really good, good consistency and fried up nice.  But they need salt.  I added Some shakes of Lowry’s  seasoning salt to the last half of the batch, and they were much better.

Delicious! I’ve made these several times now and get huge compliments every time. I’ve followed the base recipe exactly each time, only adding things like corn and jalapeño. Like the recipe says, you have to keep an eye on the oil temp for sure, but if you keep it in the 365 degree range and keep them to ping pong ball size, they won’t burn on you like some of the reviews say. Serve with honey butter and you won’t have leftovers! Great recipe!

I took these to a chili cook-off competition and they vanished in no time. I think I got one.  Good thing I sneaked  a couple beforehand.  The only change I will make next time is to add an additional 1/4 tsp. of salt.

Basic recipe was ok, made a second batch using 50/50 mix of fine and course ground corn meal. Hush puppies were very light in the center but  I prefer a little more corn flavor so plan on using 1/2 cup of frozen corn next time.

These are the best ever.  I did not have buttermilk so I used 3/4 cup yogurt and 1/4 c 2% milk.  I did not have cornmeal so I used jiffy cornbread mix and omitted the sugar.  Instead of onions I used frozen corn drained on paper towel and for the last 1/2 I added  sweetened pickled jalapeno.    I was surprised how many the recipe made but 5 adults and a four year old gobbled them down.  I will definitely make this recipe again as written or with my substitutes.  Thank you

I decided to try to bake these to salvage a few calories. So I made them exactly as recipe but put them in mini muffin tin and cooked at 450 in oven for 15 minutes.  Worked great.  Sure, it’s not the same...but tasty and good with breaded shrimp!

Cut back on the sugar by 1/2.  Mixed in some chopped jalapenos to some at cook time for those who like a little heat.

Delicious! I am always looking for ways to use up leftover buttermilk, and this is a great one...Nice, light and crisp! I did use the optional Cajun seasoning and corn, but did not have the green onions, so I had to omit those. My family gobbled these up...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought a there was more cornmeal than needed but that's just my preference. Tastes great and easy to make.

Great recipe all on it's own!  I did go back and do two things: I added a little more sugar and a tiny bit of chicken bullion for added flavor, and I cut the recipe in half.  My family of 4, who LOVED them, couldn't even come close to finishing the amount this recipe made, even when they tried to eat them as leftovers.  We had to dispose of some and that was such a waste of a great food!

I also added a few spoon fulls of diced jalapeño which balanced the sweetness next time I'll use less sugar & maybe a little shredded cheddar cheese, they cook super fast in seconds so I wouldn't scoop bigger than an ice cream scoop they were awesome & stayed crispy like corn bread should

I'm sorry, but these were just bland! Maybe I did something wrong, maybe made them too large or the oil's temp was off. Was so disappointed by the first two sets that I ended up abandoning the rest of the batter.

My family and friends Loved them!  I couldn't make enough of them!  I didn't have any buttermilk so i used regular milk and added 4 teaspoons of vinegar to the milk.  I also added garlic powder, green peppers and jalapenos.

These were great, though I left out the green onions. I pan fried them like little pancakes, as I'm not a fan of deep frying. 
Will definitely make these again!

This is the best. I had a similar recipe years ago that I misplaced. I was so happy to find this one that used butter instead of oil. I added 1 tsp of vanilla when making it.

These were delicious . I didn't change a thing but I did add some chopped deseeded Jalapeno pepper to half of the recipe for myself , my hubby doesn't like hot pepper so I fried part of the recipe for him first.. These are so light and fluffy.. Simply fabulous with pan fried catfish and a side of coleslaw and a spoon of Pinto beans.. Delish !!!!

Needed a bit more seasoning. We added Cavendar's greek seasoning to the second batch, and they were much more flavorful.

Good overall taste but bland.  I tasted that familiar hush puppy taste but it was far in the background.  I also think most hush puppies I have eaten in restaurants have more corn meal.  These were lighter and fluffier.  Pleasant.

Followed recipe exactly as written.: Tasted ok to me, but Hubby and 13 year old son refused to eat more than one each.The puppies came out black(not brown)- though not burnt and very very oilyyyyy. Will try these again, but in the oven as a sort of cornbread/cake.

Awesome recipe! Just finished making them. I added leftover corn from last night's corn on the cob (3 ears worth of corn). Didn't change any of the other ingredient amounts. Exceptional recipe, very light in texture....my kids loved them!
