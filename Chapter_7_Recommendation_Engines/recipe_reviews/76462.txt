These are not for a diet, but I made them for a New Years party and everyone wanted the recipe!  One of the boys even wanted them for breakfast the next morning with his eggs!  How awesome is that!  They almost will outshine your main dish - you can't miss with these!

I GIVE IT ONLY 4 STARS BUT I DONT THINK ITS THE FAULT OF THE RECIPE.  I COULD TELL IT HAD VERY GOOD FLAVORS.BUT, I USED SOME LEFT OVER MASHED POTATOES THAT KIND OF THREW OFF THE TASTE BUT i WOULD DEFF. MAKE AGAIN WITH FRESH MASHED POTATOES AND THEN WILL PROBLY CHANGE TO 5 STARS

This is a simple yet great alternative to the usual mashed potatoes.
Reading the reviews, how can one say it didn't wow them when they changed the recipe?  Try it as it states then judge.  people.

This was pretty good.  I give it 4.5/5 stars, since I really liked it, but it didn't "wow" me.  I used left over frozen garlic mashed potatoes, but that didn't seem to make much of a difference in flavor or consistency.  I also used a lot more cheddar cheese, which melted right in to potatoes.  You can really use as much cheese as you want.  I will probably make this again.

These potatoes are soooo good. I used goat's milk mozzarella because that's all I had. My dinner guests were quite pleased and I had many requests for the recipe.

I made this for christmas dinner and my family loved it.  I followed the recipe but forgot to buy cheddar cheese.  So I substituted it with milk and a little mayyonaise.  I was absolutely delicious.

Made these for dinner the other night. I did have to substitute a few things and use what I had on hand..cream cheese for the cottage cheese and I had to leave out the green onions and I used yukon gold potatoes. We all loved them even my husband who isnt a big fan of potatoes.

I didn't have bacon, but I used bacon fat, and the flavor came through just fine.  To cut down on the number of pans (!) I sauted the onions in one Tablespoon of bacon fat in my dutch oven. (yay! another chance to use it!)  I boiled the potatoes in another pan, drained, mashed mixed right in it.  Then put it all into the dutch oven (already greased!) I only had one small bunch of green onions (about 3/4 cup chopped) but it was still very good. I cut out the extra 2 T butter and didn't add salt, thinking it would be salty enough with the bacon fat and cheese.  It did need just a little, though. I think that the cottage cheese may be the important ingredient here -- the flavor was really special. Thanks for the great recipe!

Not diet friendly but packs a great punch for your tastebuds. This is very similiar to Paula deen's cottage potatoes. I didn't have any real bacon so I used real bacon bits & sautueed with my onion. Make sure you season well...

Made this as a side dish for dinner.  It was delicious!  I used real bacon bits saut√©ed with onions.  Didn't have green onion so used a little fresh parsley.. Husband and sister loved it   Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you LAGIRL for a delicious recipe!

Fantastic!! I followed the recipe for the most part, but didn't have cottage cheese, so I substituted cream of chicken condensed soup... I will definitely make this again, and might add a lil garlic. SO DELICIOUS and the house smelled great while it cooked!

I would have used a potato suitable for boiling as russets are a baking potato and went watery.    Other than that.  A great recipe.  I will be taking this to the next family pot luck.

This is a very good dish.  I made it as instructed.  It is good comfort food.  Not terribly complex so I couldn't give it 5 stars.   I LOVE onions but I think the scallions should be cut back by about a third.  I think if you're a garlic nut this may benefit  from that as well.  We had it again for breakfast with our eggs and bacon. Someone called this unhealthy.  I would disagree.  I eat VERY healthy.  This dish alone is almost a complete meal because of the protein in cottage cheese.

Good flavor but just mashed potatoes. What doesn't
taste great with bacon and cheese.  Would be much better in scallop potatoes perhaps. Not for the healthy eater.

These  are fantastic, my family loves them.we're not a big fan of cottage cheese, so I used french onion dip instead.
