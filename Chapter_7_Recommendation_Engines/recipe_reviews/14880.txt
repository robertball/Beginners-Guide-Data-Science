Since there were so many good reviews of this recipe, I thought that I would try it. We were very disappointed however as the garlic and onion were so overwhelming that it actually stung our tongues. I would try it again but would omit both the garlic and the onion (or, at least, cut them down in half). This is funny as we are HUGE garlic and onion fans and usually add a lot more than is required after we test a new recipe.

Very good, with some changes.  Replaced 1/2 cup of mayonnaise with 1/2 cream cheese - I can't stand too mayonnais-y!  Use onion powder (1 tsp) and garlic powder (1/2 tsp) so it wouldn't taste too "raw".  Increased blue cheese to 1/2 cup.  Used white wine vinegar instead of plain white, and 1 tsp chili powder for spice and color.  Then instead of salt and pepper, I garnished with toasted pecans and served with chips, carrots, and celery.  Perfect!

Great salad dressing, however I lightened it up a bit by using Hellman's light mayo, reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat blue cheese.  I also cut way back on the onion and garlic using just a pinch of onion powder and a 1/4 tsp. of minced garlic. I used white wine vinegar which is milder, subbed light buttermilk for the lemon juice, reduced the parsley and added a pinch of sugar.  I blended everything together and let it set for an hour before using.

This recipe is fantastic and perhaps the best one I've ever used. I skipped the lemon juice because I didn't have any, used 1 tsp of onion powder instead of chopped onion and kept the fresh garlic. You can really taste each individual flavor in the end and letting it sit for at least an hour is a must. It became a completely different dressing after it was sitting for a while. Very, very good and we will definitely be making it again to accompany wing night.

I am a big fan of blue cheese dressing and this really is a good dressing. I only made one change and that was to leave off lemon juice. I have used it in other blue cheese dressings and I believe that is what messes them up.  
I will be keeping this recipe for future use as I found it to be most excellent. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I recently got some blue cheese from a cheese of the month that we could not stand to eat.  However we used it in this recipe and it was awesome!  Thanks for giving us a wonderful use for our blue cheese!  We didn't change a thing and will definitely make this again!

Great! So much better than anything you can buy in the store already made. I did add more blue cheese than the recipe called for but that is because I love the blue cheese. Recipe was very easy and I will definitely make it again.

I replaced half of the mayo with cream cheese but left the rest as is (not a huge mayo fan and wanted it a bit thicker).  Served it to family with buffalo wings and as a vegetable dip on New Year's eve and it was a hit. I have been looking for a good blue cheese dressing recipe for a while and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Thanks for sharing it!!

Delicious, my husband loves blue cheese salad dressing. I've always bought the bottled stuff but after trying this recipe I will no longer be buying it.
The only thing I changed was I used half of the mayo and doubled the sour cream

This dressing is so delicious.  I use it as a salad dressing and dipping sauce.  I think the trick is to mince the onion and garlic really fine so you won't get a big chunk of either when you taste it.  I don't use the lemon juice.  I used balsamic vinegar and it really added a nice touch. I also use a lot more blue cheese than the recipe calls for.

This recipe if Fabulous! I changed a few things around for "my" taste buds though (fresh chopped red onion, a little extra freshly chopped garlic, and doubled the vinegar/lemon juice). Thank you for sharing.  I will definately use it again.

I don’t like most blue cheese dressing, so I decided to make my own. This was so good: very delicate in flavor with a hint of the blue cheese taste, instead of the liquid version of a bit of bleu cheese (which is what I don’t like about the commercial stuff). If you like just a *taste* of the bleu cheese instead of overwhelming flavor of it, try this recipe and tweak it as you like!  I used 2/3 of a cup of sour cream but no mayo (didn’t have any—oops). Because of not having mayo, I cut the sour cream with buttermilk (maybe ¼ cup?). I have just realized that I completely spaced on the onion, but after tasting it I can see how some onion powder would be better than actual onion. Dried parsley worked fine. I used only vinegar (red wine) as suggested by others. I used more like 1/3 cup of cheese. I did use the garlic as instructed!

I rated another Blue Cheese dressing on this site as delish, but I have to say this recipe is 100 times better.  I added twice the garlic which I pounded to a paste with some sea salt in my mortar and pestle.  I didn't want to me biting into little chunks of raw garlic and I shredded the onion with my cheese grater for the same reason.  I couldn't stand the thought of using that much mayo so I subbed extra sour cream and buttermilk for half the mayo until I had a consistency that I liked.  I used part of the dressing in a Buffalo Chicken Dip and I know it helped make the dip even better than it would have been with lousy storebought!

Used half as much garlic but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Wonderful. Very fresh tasting. So easy to make and heads above anything you buy in the store. This one has been added to my favorites.

Loved this dressing!  I made it the night before and added double blue cheese to increase the flavor based on the reviews I read.  The second day the garlic did get very hot and spicy but I like hot and spicy!

very nice dressing - I swapped out the mayo and sour cream with equal parts whole-milk organic yogurt to keep it healthy - also added about a tsp of Chipotle Cholula - delicious!

My husband adored this dressing w/his hot wings!  I even took some as a dip for a veggie tray.  Lots of requests for the recipe!

This is my family's favorite blue cheese dressing, and most of them don't like blue cheese!  If you let it sit in the refrigerator for a day or so, the sharpness of the cheese gets absorbed by the mayo and sour cream for a taste th at is amazingly pleasant!  Definitely recommended.

I've made this as is, and I've also made it substituting the sour cream for yogurt.  Either way, it's delish!

This is the BEST dressing!  It certainly does have the bite of fresh garlic, so if you dislike that, skip it.  I used dried parsley, dehydrated onion, a bit of onion powder - and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Without the blue cheese, it is an excellent ranch dressing.  With the blue cheese, even better!  Reminds me very much of the "House Dressing" at the Broiler Steakhouse in Redwood Valley, California.

This is awesome! I added some feta to mine as well.  Next time I am going to add goat cheese.  I also added some half and half to mine to make it creamier.  The original recipe was a little chunky for our taste.  This recipe is a staple now!

This was an AWESOME recipe. I didn't really follow ingredient list just added things to taste and eyeballed certain things like the celery and onions.   Didn't have sour cream so I subbed it for Yogurt. And used lime juice instead of lemon. It was STILL amazing! Definitely a keeper!

I agree with the other reviewers that there is too much garlic and onion so I used just  1 tsb onion powder and 1/2 tsb garlic powder , I added 2 TBS of grated parmesan cheese and 1 cup crumbled blue cheese.

This is Blue Cheese Dressing as it is meant to be - creamy and delightful.  My only addition was a couple of squirts of Worchestershire, but I doubled the blue cheese, and I added an extra 1/2 cup of sour cream so that mayo/sour cream were in even amounts.  Delish!

I live in the UK and I had a hard time finding sour cream so I substituted it for Cream Cheese.  The combination worked wonders and I thought it tasted better than any store bought blue cheese.

UPDATE: I re-rated this because I made it again with half the garlic and onion and it really was very good. FIRST REVEW: I followed this to the "T" - I should have scrutinized the reviews better but had several recipes to make yesterday. I love anything blue cheese and I love garlic but this has waaaaay too much garlic/onion! I am so bummed because I made a huge batch to go with the Buffalo wings at our Superbowl party this Sunday. I hoped it would meld & mellow overnight - no such luck. I thought about adding more mayo and sour cream but I'm afraid to waste more ingredients - I should have known to try it first but it sounded so good.

Excellent! The only deviation we did was to use dried minced onion and dried parsley.
I’m not sure what the reviewer Michelle did wrong but, there were no burning tongues here. Maybe the type of onion she used, and me using dried minced onion made the difference.
I got a huge kick out of LAMB2LOVE’s review. Reminds me of my aunt whose end results resemble the recipe in name only. (Great cook though)
Excellent homemade blue cheese dressing, highly recommended.

This recipe is fabulous. I won't use any other blue chees now. Do though, give it the hour it calls for to allow the flavors to mix. Makes a huge difference.

Fantastic, just what I was looking for. 
I love blue cheese so I added extra, and kind of mooshed some of it into the mayo. The second time I made it I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried, and instead of white onion I used a Bermuda onion, and it turned out great. I chop the onion very, very fine so they aren't so chunky. 
Thanks!!

EXACTLY what I was looking for. I find too many blue cheese recipes have too much mayo, this was perfect.  My aunt used something similar for a recipes years ago, it has taken me a long time to find anything that came close.  The onion is a great addition.  I personally love Danish Blue Cheese so I used that and it came out great. Thank you!

I made this dip for a party to serve with chicken wings and vegetables.  It was definitely the most popular dip at the party!  Even my friends who don't like blue cheese enjoyed the dip.  (However, if you know your crowd likes blue cheese, you might want to add extra.)  I had no problem with the garlic or onion.  I did, however, use green onion--- that's what was in the house!  This will be my come-to blue cheese dressing recipe!

This dressing is incredible! I made it last night, and it was so good! I did leave out the onion, but everything else was as written. I tried it again this morning to see if it was still as good as it was last night, and it got better after sitting in the frig overnight! I will be making this instead of buying it from now on. I can't believe how much better this tasted over store bought!

Have been making this for years, now's my chance to say thank you!! I always make the recipe as is. Ingredients are in perfect proportion. Everybody loves it! The vinegar and lemon juice is what really makes a difference. I know because one time I almost forgot both.  I've tried other blue cheese dressings/dips before, and something always seems to be missing. This recipe just satisfies the taste buds. Superb!

Will definitely make this again.  I used Gorgonzola since that is what I had.  Much better than any  bleu cheese dressing from a jar or bottle.   Cost wise, it's cheaper than the grocery store.  May not keep as long, but we like salads so it won't last long anyway.

Makes a really nice blue cheese dressing. We enjoyed it very much. I believe it is important to make this ahead, preferably a day or so if possible. The onion and garlic melds beautifully with the other ingredients that way.

Wow this is amazing! But only if you're a garlic lover just like me :).  I also added more blue cheese crumbles because i wanted a more strong blue cheesey taste.  Thanks for the great recipe, i'll never the pre-made stuff again!

This is the best....according to my husband and sons.  I'm afraid I'm still not a fan of blue cheese.  But I'll tell you what, leave out the blue cheese, and this recipe doubles for an awesome Ranch, which I love!  This has been a huge blessing because it works super well with the ketogenic diet my son is on for epilepsy.  Lots of great fat, low carbs!  Thank you so much for sharing!  Don't be afraid to put in the lemon juice and vinegar.  It will thin it out some and enhance the flavors.  I use dried parsely- works just fine.

Very good Bleu Cheese dressing!  The only thing I added was Hungarian paprika (about 1/2 tsp, but add to taste).  Regular paprika is good, too.

Made this recipe exactly as written. It was delicious. The best blue cheese dressing I ever eaten. Will never buy Marie's Blue Cheese dressing again. My entire adult family loved this dressing. Very easy to prepare.

This is DELICIOUS!!! I made it and couldn't stop licking the spoon. Super-easy to make - only took a few minutes (less than 15 minutes). Really good. I would definitely make this again.

I used this recipe to make the sauce layer for Buffalo Chicken Lasagna.  Oh my!  Soooo good!  I did use 1/2 mayo-1/2 cream cheese as well as plain yogurt in place of sour cream .  Upped the blue cheese to 1/2 cup.  Used onion and garlic powder but ended up needing the fresh garlic flavor.  It didn't taste right to me without the lemon juice.   So when I made the lasagna, I skipped the ricotta and added 2 eggs to this dressing and it was PERFECT!

The mayonnaise was a bit heavy but I cut it with some buttermilk and this was a great recipe.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I left it out.  Next time I will use it. Like any recipe everyone should tweek it to their taste but overall this is a good recipe.

Used about 3/4 C mayo and 3/4 C sour cream. Used about 1T of Lighthouse brand salad herb blend. This was so good that I don't believe I will buy bottled blue cheese dressing ever again.

This is for me to remember what I did - 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup plain yogurt, 1/2 cup buttermilk/kefir, dehydrated onion and garlic instead of fresh, dried parsley, no lemon, and more blue cheese.  Great consistency and taste, even before sitting.

Delicious... Never want to buy dressing again!  This is a very forgiving recipe for substitutions. We didn't have sour cream or plain yogurt, so we used all mayo.

Best blue cheese dressing ever!!!   Based on reviews from other users, I use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup cream cheese instead of that full cup of mayo because I'm also not a huge mayo fan.  Also, I use garlic and onion powder versus minced because it seems to blend better and I don't get huge spots of really potent flavor.

Great recipe! I used Best Foods/Hellmans full-fat mayo and 0% Fage plain yogurt. Added a bit of sugar to balance out the tartness. Used apple cider vinegar and at least half a cup of blue cheese or more. Next time, I will try the onion and garlic powder as suggested because the raw onion/garlic is a bit sharp. Still VERY tasty!

Really good - hubby did want more blue cheese next time despite adding even more than called for in recipe.  I don't care for blue cheese so I made half without and that was delicious as well.  Subbed half of the mayo for lite cream cheese with good results.  Our new "go to" dip for chicken wings.

I won't buy commercial blue cheese dressing again. I doubled the recipe and used non fat yogurt along with the mayo and sour cream. Also added a tsp worcheshire and a pinch of cayenne. I make ours really chunky.

I didn't measure anything, but went with pretty much the same ingredients, except I used celery seed instead of parsley and powdered garlic and onion instead of minced.  I also added a packet of splenda.  It was really good, I don't think I will buy bottled again, this is so easy and I like knowing (and being able to pronounce!) exactly what's going into my tummy.

This is the "Best Blue Dressing" I've ever had. And I'm 67, eaten in Four Seasons, etc. I used dry parsley and didn't have any sour cream. Added a couple dashes of worchester sauce, and tabasco. Used lime juice instead of lemon. Very Good!! Making another batch tonite. Thanks

Use one pearl onion rather than a yellow one. I find yellow onions are to harsh, also try using white whine vinegar and a half a lemon. Perfect for the big game.

Great recipe!! Chunky, thick, full of flavor. Salads, wings, appetizers, sandwiches all call out for this kind of dressing - the kind that doesn't run down to a milky puddle at the bottom of your plate (or on your hand when eating wings?). I love onions and garlic, but cut back on those for this recipe, and still had more than enough flavor. My favorite use for this dressing is on a classic wedge, and then topped with a good Italian dressing. The combination is amazing. :-D

We have this recipe routinely; I am getting ready to prepare it once again for our Christmas Eve meal. As a "go to" dressing for a special meal, this is top shelf.

Absolutely delicioso!  This is the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had.  My husband doesn't like blue cheese and he gave it 5 stars. You can taste all the ingredients. Thank you!
