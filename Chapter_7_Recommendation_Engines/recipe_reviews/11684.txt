I gave this 5 stars even though hubby didn't really care for it.  I think you need to be a real lover of blue cheese to love it.  I did make a few modifications.  I mixed 1 tbs of flour with 1/4 cup of chicken broth, then added the remainder of the can to the garlic and walnuts.  Then I stirred in the flour and broth and ooked until it made a nice sauce.  I'm a sauce junkie.  I used it over Ronzoni wheat pasta and the sauce really holds it's own even with the wheat pasta.

Excellent recipe, especially if you love blue cheese!  Added some tomatoes and diced chicken to make it a little heartier and a little extra oil and cheese to compensate for the extra ingredients.  Also substituted bowtie pasta for spaghetti so that the sauce would stick to the pasta better.  Tried this sauce on ravioli as well and loved it!  Will definitely make this again.

The recipe as written is really good, but if you want to make it excellent and really "wow" your dinner party, do this: up the garlic and add sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. Once you toss it with the noodles and blue cheese, taste it and salt and pepper accordingly. It tastes amazing and has a real restaurant quality to it. Try it!!!

Mmmm... My buddy, Ennis, shared this recipe with me and it was awesome!  He's pretty much full-blown granola, so I wasn't sure if I would like it.  I used whole wheat pasta to make it extra wholesome.  It definitely needed salt and pepper.  Also, a pinch of nutmeg was a nice addition.

I thought this recipe tasted great and it was quite easy to put together.  After having it at a restaurant, I wanted to try and make it on my own.  The bleu cheese gave the pasta just the right tang.  I used stilton bleu cheese and it was GREAT!  I also used an organic wheat pasta and this made it really tasty, too. Thanks!

More extra virgin olive oil is needed in this recipe for a smoother consistency. I used approximately 1/4 c. I also substituted the walnuts for soy nuts as they contain more protein. Puree the mixture, including the blue cheese, in a mini food processor until smooth and pastey. Rather than using this on top of spaghetti, I laid a thick layer in a soft burrito and placed scrambled eggs on top for an "egg burrito". It was absolutely delicious! The mixture may also be delicious on a toasted baguette or as a dip for vegetables. I believe there are many ways to enjoy this recipe - thank you Nancy!

This recipe is amazing! I added chopped chicken, a bell pepper and some extra blue cheese to comepnsate for the new ingredients. It gave the recipe some variety and people love it wherever I go!

I thought this was excellent.  So very simple.  I had something sort of like this in a restaurant and said to myself I wish I could make this recipe at home.  Thanks for helping me find new ways to serve pasta without all that meat...

Nice idea but a bit bland in taste... which surprised me considering the use of blue cheese in this recipe. Maybe I'll try it again but with 1 or 2 more cloves of garlic and a different type of pasta for better texture (perhaps farfalle/bowtie?)

The only thing I changed was to add some tomato. I was surprised by this recipe. I thought blue cheese and walnuts would taste weird together, but it really was delicious.

Excellent idea for pasta!  I thought it was a bit pungent, so I added some dried cranberries and some mango chutney.  The sweetness balanced the dish perfectly.  I will definitely make this again!

I absolutely LOVED this pasta but I made a lot of substitutions. I used bowtie pasta which was recommended in another post. I didn't have walnuts so i omitted those, I sauteed a ton of elephant garlic in a little extra olive oil, added sun dried tomatoes and blue cheese at the end. It became this amazing sauce. I also roasted some grape tomatoes in the oven until they burst and smashed with a potato masher with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil and tossed that into the pasta as well. this is seriously one of the best comfort foods. yummy and interesting.

This recipe did not work for us at all.  The blue cheese was way too overpowering for the pasta.  Not an experiment I'll be repeating.

Pretty good, but I did make a few changes.  I added salt and I mixed a little of the blue cheese and the walnut mixture in with the pasta so it melted a little and coated the pasta a bit.  Then I served and sprinkled some blue cheese on top.

Made this for dinner last night! Yummy but had to add a bit more olive oil. I used a strong blue cheese...a bit overpowering but delicious! Thanks!

Added some sauted onion and defrosted frozen chopped spinach and it was lovely. The juice from the spinach turned the cheese (I used a French Gorgonzola style cheese) into a coating sauce so was not dry. It was initially a bit bland until I seasoned it with a little salt and some black pepper. Easy to make providing I can keep the cheese away from the crackers long enough!

This a great "nothing in the pantry" recipe.  Added 1/4 c chicken broth, juice of 1/2 lemon...handful of peas & a 1/4 c of fresh parsley.  Of course garlic and a tablespoon of butter + one turn of evoo.  Decadent.

Very good and easy - I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese which was very tasty, and a bit more garlic.

This was surprisingly tasty for so few ingredients. I didn't use all the bleu cheese - it would have overpowered it completely. I gave it a 4 because while it was tasty, there seemed to be something missing - it was a bit dry - maybe the bleu cheese could've been combined with some cream to make a sauce. Then again, that would defeat it being so wonderfully simple! All that being said, my husband told me I should open my own restaurant so it will go into my rotation! (no way on the restaurant though!)

I added a few tsps of:  chopped bell peppers, sundried tomatoes, arugula, bacon bits & a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes. Also added a fourth-cup of pasta water to make it creamier. 
My mistake: I used cheese-filled tortellini.  I think it would be better with a plain pasta, probably bow ties.

5 star Pasta. 

I made this tonight and added bacon and kalamata olives Hold off on the salt even with rinsed Kalamata olives. I like this better than traditional spaghetti. I love it and plan on having this once a week. This is a keeper
