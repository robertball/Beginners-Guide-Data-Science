Very tasty, but as another reviewer noted, the Bellini was quite thick.  My suggestion would be to add more champagne (never a bad thing) to balance the fruit.  Thank you Helen for a nice twist from a true Bellini.

Made this for my wife for mother's day. I took the advice of several reviews and added more bubbly. I also substituted rum for the brandy. The rum gave It a more summer feel. It is very refreshing!

Perfect for a hot, summer night.  I took others' advice and added more Prosseco.  Delightful!
