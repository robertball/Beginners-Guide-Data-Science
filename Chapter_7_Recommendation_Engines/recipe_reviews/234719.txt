I used 20 ounces chicken and 3 medium-sized apples.  I diced the chicken and cooked it in oil on the stove top.  My mistake was to use 2 tbs olive oil.  WAY too greasy.  1 tsp, as the recipe suggests, would have been better.  Overall, the flavor was good.

EVAUGHN69, I think you should put your photo up with this recipe!  I do think I would use this next time as a base for something a little different.  I was thinking about saut√©ing lightly the apple with a little shallot and something to add some color to it.  I did use my friend ~Lissa~'s Chai Tea Jelly to top my baked rollup for a little moisture.  Also, mine did take a little longer than 25 minutes to bake---maybe 10-15 minutes more.  I love the idea of this dish, and I'll use it again.  Thanks!

Really good. My guest ate two whole chicken breasts! I used jazz apples and just cut them length wise and stuffed them in. I didn't use bacon like other people did and it was still really good.

I made it almost as the recipe stated but added salt, pepper and garlic to the chicken before rolling it.  I also added more cheese on top.  I thought it was ok, but a little bland, which I realize would have been more so had I not added seasonings.  The chicken was a little dry as well, almost like it needed a sauce of some sort with it.  Perhaps with applesauce even.  I liked the flavor of apples and chicken together, so good to know in the future I can experiment more with  those together.  My husband seemed to enjoy it the most, my teenage daughter ate it as well.  I may make it again but will add/adjust things probably.  I had to cook it an additional 15 minutes or so to be fully cooked.
