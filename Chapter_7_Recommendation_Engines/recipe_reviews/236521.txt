The tangy creaminess of the goat cheese, the sweetness of the mango chutney, and the texture of the pecans make these deviled eggs really special.  Totally outside the box delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing, this one's going into my Favorites folder.

Loved this recipe!  Texture was fantastic... Same thick creaminess of a deviled egg with the crunchiness of the pecans.  I used organic goat cheese which is a little more "gamey" than I like but that was just a poor choice on my part and I'm the only one who seemed to mind anyway.  Thanks for sharing!
