This was really good.  Make sure it is thoroughly cooled and set before you try to slice other wise it is a sticky mess, but it is a wonderful tasting mess!

Very Good...just like my mother's recipe. I let the marshmellows get a little too soft, so when I poured the frosting on top, it all mixed together...oh, well, still tasted GREAT!!

Very rich and moist but sooooo good. The buttercrean frosting WILL melt into the marshmallows but thats ok, for it doesn't hurt the taste at all. A keeper for sure.

I was disappointed with this one.  The topping was too sweet (and I love sweet stuff), and the bottom part wasn't thick enough.  A good idea, but not quite right.

I finally found the recipe from my childhood and it's better than I remember.  This is similar to sheet cake, something your grandma made when you were a kid and you haven't had in many years.

Very VERY rich. Extremely rich. Found it difficult to spread the icing onto the melted marshmellows, so I just blended in the icing with the marshmellows and threw some extra pecans on top. Pretty.

I thought the cake layer itself was just a teeny bit dry, but altogether, mixed with the gooey marshamallow creme and the fudge-like frosting, it was absolutely delicious.  One of my friends commented that it was "the best cake ever!"  I definietly will make it again.

What can I say other than fabulous? I made this for a youth swim party and they practically devoured it. The gooey marshmallow and icing topping is great for any kid or kid at heart. I will definitely make this again!

the cake seems a little dry, but I used pecan meal, not chopped pecans.
