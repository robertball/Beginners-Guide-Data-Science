So frickin easy! I made mine with chocolate bark instead of white chocolate and it turned out great :) Doesn't taste quite like traditional fudge, but it's real close!

I tried this recipe with chocolate bark, and didn't care for it. I don't think it tasyes anything like fudge. It was actually kinda waxy tasting. I personally don't like white chocolate so I didn't even consider that. If you like chocolate candy you might like it.

I can not wait to try this recipe. I know I am giving it 5 stars already and I havnen't even tried  it yet. But I guess it kinda makes up for the one star someone gave for saying they tried the recipe and din't even use the ingredients they were supposed to. and called this a white chocolate fudge when it is not. it is a PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE!!! not WHITE COCOLATE. and they call themselves a COOK!! lol

This fudge was awesome.  I will never make it any other way again.  Next time I am going to try chocolate and then I am going to try not mixing the PB in completely so you can have a taste of the white chocolate as well as PB not completely mixed.  The wait time is just on the settling of the mixture to harden up. Its not a solid fudge, it is soft, but not so soft it squeezes in your hands, so keep it in the fridge when not being eaten.     EASY EASY EASY  LOVE IT

This won't replace my regular fudge recipe, but if you have a craving it's a quick way to hit the spot :)  Next time I might try swirling some milk chocolate chips.  Or maybe just melt some on top.  Thanks for a quick and easy one :)

This was a fantastic and quick recipe , if I ever crossed one easy enough! I've made this at least 5x in one week for the family and for friends. I also did this with crunchy peanut butter as well. Such a quick and easy recipe. Will be on my holiday goodie table for sure. I just might add this...do NOT skimp out on amount of ounces in this recipe. You thoroughly need the 18 ounces of peanut butter, don't settle for a smaller jar, you won't have the same results.

This was also my first time making fudge and it was great except I couldn't find the white almond bark so I used vanilla candy wavers (the kind you would use to make lollipops and find in AC Moore) and the fudge was marvelous!!!!! Next time I want to make it with chocolate chips and peanut butter.

I had excellent results substituting Nestle's Premier White Morsels for the white almond bark.  I also prefer using chunky peanut butter.

This was really good!! I did make some changes based off of what I had on hand. I melted everything on the stove at low/med heat (#4). Also I used butterscotch flavored almond bark, the entire 20oz package. I did use JIFF, natural peanut butter. I added in some halved pecans and it really set it off! If you are a nut lover I highly recommend adding them in. Excellent simple recipe!

I made this for my grandson's birthday request and included ingredients so he could make it as well.  Easy and for what it is, it is pretty good.  I still prefer a more traditional fudge recipe.

This is the ONLY kind of fudge I've ever tasted that I absolutely loved.  It's completely smooth with none of the sugaryness typical of even high-dollar fudge.  Everyone who tastes it loves it, too.  
I ended up making lots, and refrigerated the leftover to harden them enough to use in the center of homemade chocolates.  Kind of like homemade Reese's, but way better than the homemade Reese's recipe.
Tip:  Due to my friend's urging and completely against my better judgment, I swirled the peanut butter and white chocolate for a pretty effect.  
Don't do this.  :D
Some pieces were too soft to handle due to the instability of the peanut butter not sufficiently mixed with the harder white chocolate.

I loved this and made it according to the recipe 2x.  I have noticed it us sort of melty though:  I have to keep it refrigerated and even then can only let it sit out about 45 minutes before it gets real slippery.  any suggestions?

Made this for my mom's birthday. I used regular chocolate almond bark rather than white. Tasted like a giant Reese's PB Cup. I am now the Golden Child :)

It was simple, only two ingredients, and no cooking. I used it to use up the rest of my almond bark and adjusted measurements. Great!

Easy, quick and a hit with my friend's 14 yr old daughter.  She keeps asking, I'd like some more,please!  I tried it with crunchy peanut butter and it worked well.  I will be making this again.

CREAMY and RICH!   I used Nestles white chocolate morsels as I didn't have almond bark.  This was so easy to do.  I put it in the freezer for 1/2 hour to speed up the process.  I will make this again.  Thank you knasels.babygirl  for sharing your recipe!
