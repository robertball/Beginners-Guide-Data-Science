Delicious. I used all fresh herbs (including 1/2 c. chopped fresh parsley) and I think it makes a big difference in taste. Anytime a recipe calls for shrimp, I cook the shrimp in boiling water for 3 minutes, then rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. At the last minute, I add the shrimp to the sauce and heat just long enough to warm the shrimp. In my opinion, slow cooked shrimp turns out "spongy" and "mushy". Some reviewers said this recipe was a little bland, so I added 4-5 tablespoons of cayenne pepper to the boiling water before cooking the shrimp. YUM! Thanks, will definitely make this again.

I couldn't believe how quick and delicious this recipe was. We used half & half instead of heavy cream and still found it plenty rich. Also used precooked/cleaned, frozen medium shrimp and they worked just great...that's a huge timesaver. The fresh herbs really add great taste, and mincing the garlic instead of using a press gave the dish a definite garlic zing without being too strong. I'll be making this many more times!

This was a really easy and delicious recipe. I used fat free sour cream instead of the whipping cream and it turned out well.

Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this was so yummy. DH and I could not stop eating it. I did not have shrimp, had artificial crab, so I used that. Now let me tell you it was yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy. I did make some changes. I did not have 12 tablespoons (I was doubling) of butter on hand, so I used 6 tablespoons butter and 6 tablespoons of margarine, I also added about 1/2-1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, and about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt (did not measure these just poured into hand LOL), and then the last change I did was I did not add the sauce to the pasta I let everyone put their own sauce on, so what I did with the cheese I put oh about 3/4 cup of cheese (did not double) to the sauce (to thicken the sauce) when I added the crab then I put the cheese on the table so people could add more if they wanted it, and everyone said that the amount of cheese was just right. Will make this again and again, next time I think I will try it with a mix of crab and shrimp, and some green onions.  Thanks for posting this yummy recipe.

This recipe was delicious!!!  I stuck to the recipe as much as I could using the ingredients on hand.  I substituted 1 c. 1% milk for the heavy whipping cream (and thickened the sauce with a couple tbs of flour), 2 tbs dried basil instead of 3 tbs fresh, and left out the parsley.  I also added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it a kick, although I wish I had either used a little less of that or just omitted the black pepper instead, as it was a tad spicy.  The sauce turned out super creamy and delicious, not too thick but not too thin.  We poured it over whole wheat thin spaghetti and steamed broccoli florets.  My fiance and I both loved it and can't wait to make it again!

This was okay as written, it was just a little too bland for us. However, it is a GREAT base recipe. I added a lot of different spices (essence, cajun seasoning, garlic salt, crushed red pepper, to name a few), and that made it delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

My favorite dish at Red Lobster is the Shrimp Pasta.  I've been searching for a recipe that would come close to theirs and this one more than met my expectations!  It tastes just like it!  Just be careful how long you cook the shrimp.  There is a fine line between done and rubber!

This was a fantastic dish! My 6 year old didn't like the shrimp, but loved the pasta. I did make a few changes out of necessity. Instead of garlic cloves, I used garlic powder & onions. I also added some chopped bell pepper. Instead of 6 tablespoons of butter, I used 1/4c of butter & 2 T of vegetable oil. (would have preferred olive oil -but was out.) Instead of heavy cream, I followed two suggestions & used 1c of 2% milk with 2t of corn starch & some sour cream for flavor. I will definitely make this again. I'm going to try it with chicken tenderloins & mushrooms. Thanks so much for the restaurant quality dish. With a tossed salad & garlic bread this is a great dish to serve guests.

Pretty good! I did some minor adjustments though. Instead of heavy whipping cream I substituted 1 c liquid nonfat milk plus 2 tsps cornstarch, 3 Tbsps of butter instead of 6 and used 1 1/2 tsp fresh thyme instead of dried.  Then I doubled the sauce, used only 1 lb of shrimp and poured the whole thing over cooked spaghetti squash instead of linguine!  I will make this many times I'm sure!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I scaled to 4 servings (got 5) and used fresh herbs from my garden.  The fresh herbs are a must for best flavor.  I had jumbo shrimp so I boiled them for about 2 minutes then put in cold water while preparing the sauce.  I used leftover grilled chicken for 2 servings and shrimp for the other 3 servings.  I did follow the recipe as stated but will try half and half next time to cut down on the calories.

Since shrimp can be overcooked very easily, and since raw shrimp cooks so quickly (just a few minutes) I chose to use raw. I reduced the cream with a good splash of chicken broth until it somewhat thickened before tossing in the garlic, herbs (I used all fresh and included some chives) and shrimp.  Don't think for a minute that the cream makes this a heavy dish with a thick sauce.  It is deceptively light, fresh and delicious.

This was very good. I used ff half & half instead of cream, and 5 cloves of garlic. It was zippy and light, unlike reports from some other reviewers. I have to wonder if reports of "bland" in recipes like this are due to the parmesan cheese used. It is really worth it to use good, real parmesan cheese for recipes.

So I made this tonight and I'm not allowed to make it again. This meal was delicious but so not healthy. My husband loved it but every time he would get up to do something he would walk over to the kitchen and eat more. We both rate it 5 stars because it's awesome but it's one of those meals you can only eat once in a while unless you want to gain a lot of weight. :)

I made this last night and it was a huge hit.  I added 6 oz of immitation crab meat, used fat free half and half, substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme for dried and grated my own parmigiano reggiano (1 cup).  I also used thin spaghetti. I only had raw shrimp, so I sauteed them in 4 tablspoons of butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic. 

Next time I plan on making double the sauce for a saucier dish.  I plan on making this many times.  My husband had seconds and at 11pm went for a third helping, which he only does with exeptional meals.  Make your own garlic bread and this is a dinner your family and friends will rave about.

How many ways can I say "yuck!" This was too rich and too bland for me, however the hubby and 7 year old scarfed it down. Go figure. They told me to make this again and perhaps I will, only next time I won't eat it.

This recipe is a great base, but as many reviews stated as it stands right now it is a bit bland. I added 3 times as much garlic and some green onions and it came out pretty good.  I also heated the cream to near boiling, then removed from heat and added my cheese stirring until melted to make a thick creamy sauce. I also used seasoned frozen shrimp, cooked them on the stove top and then just added them to the sauce at the end. Finally tossing with linguine. The seasoned shrimp also helped add some good flavor.

I tweaked this recipe a bit to make it less fattening but it was absolutely delicious. Used half shrimp, half scallops. Coated pan with a small amount of extra virgin olive oil, sauteed the shrimp and garlic till barely cooked then removed from pan. Added sliced mushrooms and browned them. Then I added 1/2 container of light herb and garlic cream cheese and 3/4 cup of the pasta water plus fresh basil, thyme, Italian parsley.  Simmered until thickened then added the shrimp and garlic.  Served over pasta - with freshly grated parmigiano - fabulous!

So easy and good, used 1/2 and 1/2 and added the seasonings and parm cheese before the shrimp.  We will be making this again!

I've made this a couple of times, adding peas.  It was a quick way to use frozen cooked shrimp. I did find it to be a tad on the bland side.  Next time, I will follow the recommendations of others and use a really good quality cheese and blend it with the cream in the pan.

Very good recipe.  I used half and half instead of whipping cream and added diced cherry tomatoes.  I also used dry basil.  It was a keeper!

i personally think that the 3 tablespoons of basil gives it too much of an herby taste and i dont like it but other than that its a pretty good dish i will definitely be trying it again with a few changes =]

The flavors are good, and it's certainly easy to make. My one quibble is the sauce is a little thin, and tended to roll off the noodles rather than sticking. I think the next time I'll cook a little flour in the butter before I add the garlic.

I made double the sauce as suggested.  It tasted great.  I substituted the heavy cream with half-and-half and thickened the sauce using some cornstarch to "save" some fat.  Great recipe, will make again!

This one is definitely a keeper. I doubled the recipe. I used 5 tablespoons of garlic instead of 2. I did not have fresh parsley on hand so I used dry parsley. Fresh Basil is way too expensive, and most of the time our SuperStore doesn't have any, so I had Classico Basil Pesto in my cupboard. I ended up using the whole 270 ml. I also boiled my shrimp in 6 tablespoons of cayenne pepper for 3 minutes and then rinsed in cold water. I read this from a previous reviewer, and what a wonderful idea.I am going to try this recipe with chicken breast next time. This was wonderful and thank you K.Gerretsen for a   
recipe that I will use for a long time to come.

This is very flavorful.  I used half butter/half olive oil and half and half instead of heavy cream.  My herbs haven't grown enough yet, so I had to use half fresh and half dried...fresh are definitely the way to go though!  I only used half the amount of pasta and there was just enough sauce, I can't imagine there being enough sauce for a full 16 oz. of pasta.

Quick, easy, yummy. What else is there? Followed the recipe exactly. I found a guy who markets his own pasta and I bought a package of Habinero Linguini to serve this over. It was over the top! Thank you for a great recipe.

My husband and my girls LOVED it! I read the reviews and then added 1/4 tsp crushed Red Pepper (my girls do not like it super spicy) and one 1/2 tsp (heaping) salt to sauce. It was perfect! Restaurant quality!!!

This was great, but I also added a package of organic broccoli florets, and a package of organic spinach (both frozen and then microwaved which was totally easy).  This made the dish a complete meal.... and my guests loved this and wanted the recipe!

This rivaled any shrimp linguine that I have ever had in a restaurant.  My husband even said it was the best he ever had.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  I had a package of frozen jumbo shrimp in the freezer, so used that. Didn’t have any whipping cream, so blended some cottage cheese and used that.  BTW, that is a good low fat substitute for sour cream in dip recipes.  I used the dried parsley, basil and thyme that I had in my spice cabinet, though I will use fresh if possible.  Added half a chopped onion (only because we love onions) and crushed red pepper with the minced garlic.  Also put half the parmesan cheese in with the cottage cheese cream mixture to thicken it up a little.  I only had whole wheat spaghetti pasta in my pantry, but that was fine.  If I’m out shopping for this recipe, I will get linguine, but it was Sat. evening and I didn’t feel like running to the store.  Next time I may try 4 tablespoons of butter to try and reduce a little fat but hey…it is supposed to be buttery.  Can’t wait to serve this to guests.  This is definitely a keeper!

I thought this was a very good recipe!  I followed the true recipe, with the exception that I added the shrimp and herbs before the cream.  I let the shrimp saute in the butter until it turned slightly pink then added the cream letting it come to a boil.  Very good!

This turned out way better than I thought it would! After reading some of the other reviews saying that it was "bland," I got a little concerned, but I tried it anyway and it was DELICIOUS! I used half & half instead of the heavy cream, which is probably why it turned out so thin... next time I'll use a bit of flour or cornstarch and that ought to help! I think it'd be good with chicken too! 

I loved it and so did the picky one I cook for... success! lol

Very good and really easy.  Instead of using pre-cooked shrimp which can turn rubbery, I used fresh shrimp and cooked them in the butter.  This lets them absorb all the wonderful flavor of the sauce.  Serve this immediately, otherwise the sauce can congeal and get nasty.

Wow, was this good.  I kept a lemon on the table for us to squeeze on top of the pasta for some extra flavor.  But I made it exactly according to the directions.  The sauce seemed runny in the pan before I added the pasta and parmesan, but it all incorporated into the perfect consistency.

Great recipe! I had to alter a few ingredients and I added some but loved this recipe base.  I didnt have whipping cream so I used 1% milk thickened with a few tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also added 1/3 cup of white wine (flavored with mango and pineapple flavors) and diced up an onion to throw in with a whole stick of butter instead of 6 tbsp. I included basil in my seasoning choices as well.

This was sooooooooo good! I tweaked it just a lil bit. Added some red pepper flakes and montreal seasoning to the shrimp before I tossed them into the cream sauce. Then I topped it off with a squeeze of lemon. Thank You!

Yummy!! I made this dish a few weeks ago to satisfy my hankering for a cream sauce dish (my husband despises cheese and alfredo-type dishes so I rarely make them). Let me tell you that this was fantastic! I did make some minor adjustments to suite my tastes and ingredient availability. First I cooked the shrimp about half-way in the butter & garlic then added the cream, I also added about 3/4 c. whole milk because it didn't seem saucy enough. I subbed dried herbs instead of fresh which kind of overpowered everything so next time I will be sure to use fresh herbs and omit the thyme. I also threw in about 1/2 tsp. of ground red pepper to spice it up. Oh and I added the cheese to the sauce to thicken it then tossed in the linguine. Served with sliced garlic bread...and guess what the husband LOVED it. I am making it again tonight but this time with rotini!

Have made twice now. Husband's favorite thing I make! First time I made, I followed exactly. 2nd time I made...I did half 1/2 & 1/2 and Heavy cream, sauteed mushrooms and onions and added  sundried tomatoes. I added less parsley and basil considering I used dry instead of fresh. Turned out better the 2nd time.

This dish had a very nice flavor.  I must admit, I made some changes.  I sautéed the shrimp in two cloves of garlic and about 4 tablespoons of butter.  I also added a dash of salt to the mix.  Once the shrimp were done, I removed them and added the cream.  Once it boiled, I added only about 1 teaspoon of dried basil (I have yet to use fresh).  I also added the parmesan cheese to the sauce.  I let this cook for about 15 minutes on medium low.  My husband and I enjoyed the meal, but thought that it could have been a bit smoother. Thanks for a great tasting meal!

This was a good and simple recipe, although I did change it up a bit. I used frozen cooked salad shrimp. Also I doubled the sauce, which i definately recommend. I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups light cream. Also used dried parsley 1 1/2 tbsp., and no basil (had none). Still came out very tasty. Definately needs salt and pepper. if you want a real thick sauce you will need to use all heavy cream. Will make again.

I like to dredge the shrimp in a mix of flour, a little salt /pepper and oregano and then fry them in some olive oil and butter. Remove them from the pan, and then make the sauce. Add the shrimp back to the sauce before serving.  Using white wine and fresh mushrooms is always a plus too!

We made this last night and it was one of the best pasta dishes to date.  We used fresh herds from our garden which helped as well as adding additional veggies.  Started off by sauteing some onions, mushrooms, red and green peppers and flash boiled broccoli for 90 sec.  Setting these to the side, we focused on the  butter/garlic/herb/cream/cheese sauce, adding extra garlic, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes.  For the pasta we used bow tie since I think they do a better job of picking up the sauce over linguini.  All of this was combined in a big pot to heat back up being careful to not over cook the shrimp.  Served with some home made garlic bread.  It was orgasmic!  Will be added to the usual rotation, although I'm confident it was we above the stated 517 calories per serving...

Delicious! This really does only make enough sauce for 1/2 lb. Pasta though, so next time I'll make more sauce, and there will be a next time. I only had half n half, but it was still good. I can't imagine how yummy it would taste with heavy cream. I love the fresh herb taste. Thanks for posting!

My teenage son announced that he would like pasta with shrimp. So glad to find this recipe! It was great! It was even good heated up which surprised me. Ended up having to add some salt after everything was on the plate because I didn't' taste the sauce first. Maybe didn't get enough salt in the pasta?? For anyone who likes shrimp and pasta, give this one a go.

This was o.k. at best!  I was originally very intrigued by the ingredient list and great reviews but it was definately dissapointing.  There wasn't near enough sauce to cover the pasta.  It was really bland.  My family is a pasta loving one but they were not thrilled.  Maybe I did something wrong as it seems I am the only one with this opinion....

I was kind of disappointed.  It was way runny and lacked in flavor.  Using all of the ingredients, I thought it would be FULL of flavor, but it just wasn't.

I have made this recipe several times and it is FANTASTIC!  It tastes like a pasta dish I used to get from a famous chain steakhouse.  My only advice - do not bother to try and make a low fat version of this recipe.  I tried to make it healthier (so I could eat more of it!) and it wasn't very good at all.  I don't eat this dish very often but, when I do, I splurge and use the full fat ingredients.

This was better than restaurant pasta...I actually used 2 different recipes and combined them together. The difference I made with this one was: 1)I sautéed the shrimp with minced garlic, 1tsp of basil and 1 tsp of oregano,approx 1 tsp of crushed red peppers and sliced white mushrooms.  I removed the shrimp after a couple of minutes (so they would not get rubbery). 2) I added 3 chopped roma tomatoes dices and sautéed that to the mixture of butter,mushrooms and spices. 3)I used 2 cups of heavy cream and parmesan grated cheese...I added shredded cheddar cheese (about 1.5 cups-to help thicken up). 4) At this point the sauce was not as thick as I would have liked it, so I whip an egg and added it to the mixture!!! That did the trick!! I added the shrimp to the sauce about 3 minutes before serving on rotini!!! Wonderful for Valentines dinner.  My husband really liked it!!  Yummy!!!!!

3 as is, 5 with alterations.  Quite bland without additions, great base though.  Need to add white wine with simmering garlic (5 cloves is best :)).  Also added salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and old bay seasoning to shrimp.  Used pre-cooked shrimp.  Tossed in a handful of good parm cheese (read: not the kind from the green container)with sauce. We enjoyed this for valentines day with a spinach salad and garlic bread.  Good thing we both indulged in garlic so we didn't scare each other away with stinky breath!!

Good recipe.  I don't usually have green onions on hand so I used regular onions, chopped.  Next time I make this recipe I'll use chopped onion again but I'll put it in the pan to cook for a couple of few minutes to soften, then add the chopped tomato.  
Fresh Roma tomatoes were not available so I diced and seeded a regular tomato.
I used cheddar as I didn't have Monterey Jack on hand.  
With these adaptations this dish was still a good one!   It's certainly easy and quick to prepare - I'd say just about foolproof.
I will make it again.

DELICIOUS! Tasted very similar to an entree at the Olive Garden. I did make some slight changes though which is why I only gave it 4 stars. The sauce definitely needed to be doubled and I substituted the heavy cream with hald & half. I used half the amount of parsley and completely omitted the thyme. I used frozen peeled and deveined shrimp. It's much faster and easier and tasted great! I sauteed them in butter and garlic instead of cooking them in the sauce. I will definitely be making this again! Next time, I think I may add some asparagus, yum!

This recipe was a nice change from tuna helper and tuna casserole on Fridays. However, when I made it, it seemed as though it needed more liquid...next time I will either try to add more whipping cream or add about a 1/2 cup of milk. Also, I cut the parsley and basil down by half, and added more garlic, which improved the taste.

This is a great recipe ... a little bland though, needs a "kick".  I may try the old bay suggestion from an earlier review.  I didn't have any parsley at home, so I used a store bought "Italian Seasoning" mix in place of all the herbs.  I started to do the 1/2 cup that is called for in the recipe (for parsley) but realized that was way too much so I ended up using maybe half of that or less (about 1/4 cup).  Came out great, will make again ... will try the lower fat options though next time.

Absouletly delicious.  People think I am a gourmet chef and ask for this for dinner everytime they come over.  Definite keeper.  I have also made with pre-cooked chicken (in the bag) since I am allergic to seafood.  This dish is also very, very good with no meat.  You must make this.  It is so easy and the pay off is wonderful.  Thanks.

Awesome! Make sure you put plenty of salt and pepper in it, otherwise it's rather bland. But with a good amount of salt and pepper..... Yum! Not to mention very quick and easy. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I'm glad I picked it.

Very, very good recipe! I used fresh parsley, as well as fresh basil. I also used 1lb. medium shrimp, and not quite a full(13.25 oz) box of whole wheat linguine. Those were my only changes and it turned out great!

Didn't use parsley or Parmesan cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe here and it turned out pretty good! Also, use regular cream instead of heavy cream. It still coated the noodles and stuck to them just fine. It was met with approval by my designated guinea pigs for these recipes, so I will give it a thumbs up!

I really loved this recipe.  I received compliments from my boyfriend on this dish.  I made the recipe similar to that stated, except I added some old bay seasoning to the dish when I added the shrimp.  I also added my cheese to the dish while the shrimp was cooking.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Great recipe. I cooked the shrimp first in butter, garlic and a bit of white wine, them removed the shrimp before adding the cream for the sauce. I only had dried herbs, and used a bit of salt, garlic powder and crushed red pepper along with the herbs in the recipe. The sauce wasn't as thick as I wanted, probably because of the wine, so I added a bit of corn starch and some sour cream at the last minute (that's what happens when I read the reviews while cooking!). I added the shrimp back to the sauce for a minute or two, sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top, then mixed in some gluten-free penne. A squirt of lemon after dishing it up added a little extra flavour. Yummy!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I added steamed veggies and cherry tomatoes, and was worried that would stretch the sauce a bit thin, but no, it was perfect. Will make again!

This got mixed reviews in my house. Since it's October, my garden is done for the year and I had no fresh basil or parsley so I had to substitute dried. I also used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 low fat milk and it was plenty creamy for me. This was simple and easy and I thought it was delicious topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. However, my husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy and told me he would have preferred the shrimp in one pile and the pasta in another so his review doesn't count ;) He wasn't a fan. Geez! I loved it!

Way to bland, not creamy enough, noone in my family would eat it, I started to throw it out and order a pizza until i found a jar of alfredo sauce and poured it in. That made it edible, but barely. I made the full 8 servings for the four of us, because we love pasta, but I still threw about 4 servings out and still ordered a pizza.

This was a very easy dish to fix and to my suprise it was very tasty.  I like a bit more cream so I doubled up on the ingredients for the cream exept the shrimp.  I will definitely make this recipe often.  Next time I plan on using chicken breast instead of shrimp.

These were alright, I was trying to find a recipe that tastes like Red Lobster's linguini, it's not quite like it, but still good. I did some changes however, half a cup of parsley was a bit too much for me, so I just added 1 tablespoon of that stuff. As for the parmesan, I mixed it with the cream instead of adding it in the end. Overall, pretty tastey.

This dish is fabulous!  I wouldn't hesitate to serve it at a dinner party.  I wasn't sure if I was going to have enough sauce but it was just enough to coat the pasta and shrimp without being too heavy.  I also used fresh thyme because I happened to have some in the fridge.  I'll definitely do that every time!  Delish!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has to be one of the best and easiest receipes I have ever used.  It is perfect for company and you can use crab or a combo of seafood.  Very versitle.

I made this recipe following the recipe as presented.  It was enjoyed by everyone and was very flavoursome.  However, when I added the shrimps, the sauce became very liquid so I had to thicken it with cornflour.  Still quite delicious though. Will definitely make it again.

A nice solid base recipe. I modified it slightly to suit my tastes, but not significantly. Thanks for the other reviewer hints on how to make the shrimp turn out well. I boiled briefly in water with a mixture of paprika and chili powder, then rinsed the shrimp immediately in ice cold water.

I thought this dish was really good.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because the shrimp did not taste as seasoned as it could have been.  I did alter the recipe slightly per a couple of other viewers recommendations.  I cooked the shrimp in garlic and butter first but then also used 1/2 and 1/2 and corn starch to thicken the sauce.  My 12 year old thought it was good. I could tell she didn't think it was a 5 based upon the fact she did not ask for a secoond plate!!! (LOL).  But on the next go round, I will see what I can do to make the shrimp a little more tasty so I can get it to a 5.

It was so good and quick & easy to make.  I took Lil Mermaids advice and put in red pepper flakes.  My shrimp was not thawed and so I put it in frozen and it made the sauce a bit runny.  I could have thickened it up but we were hungry and it tasted just fine.  Will make again!

I cooked this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Next time I will cut back on the parsley and thyme... to me the spices really overpowered it. I'll probably double up on the sauce too to make it creamier. These changes would make this a 5-star dish in my book.

Wonderful Recipe.  I made some changes that enhanced the flavor greatly.  Instead of using a whole cup of heavy cream I usted 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup whole milk.  I also substituted the parsely and used cilantro instead.  Then I drizzled olive oil on top and then the cheese.  This recipe is WONDERFUL.  I will be cooking this often.

Added one can of crab meat (6 oz) for more seafood flavor  and 1/2 cup of finely grated parmesan to the cream (use the quality stuff - not the one in the green plastic container) and it's 5 stars.  Heat the cream gently or it will curdle.  I left out the thyme, which doesn't compliment this dish.  The basil and parsley were enough. (4 stars for original recipe, 5 for slight changes.) Quick weekday meal and very delicious.

After I put the 1/2 cup of parsley in that the recipe calls for, I assumed there had been a typo....That was way too much parsley. I would make this again but would only put in a tablespoon or so of parsley.

This was an excellent recipe.  I took it to my husband's work and everybody loved it.  My four year old couldn't stop eating it.  I added mushrooms to give it a little bit of a twist and used Farfalle pasta (didn't have linguini in my pantry).

Fixed this for Christmas Eve.  Was a huge hit, and took almost no time to make.  Extremely rich, though, so not something you want to make too often.  Will keep it for another special occasion.

This was delicious.  I kept the sauce amount the same but halved the pasta for just the 2 of us and it was perfect.   I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and added some spinach in at the end for color.

Excellent. thought the sauce was to thin, but it thickens up when the parmesan is added . Definitely will make again.

Used the tip by someone else regarding boiling the shrimp first for 3 minutes then putting them in ice cold water to stop the cooking. It made the shrimp much better. Like everyone else, I tweaked the recipe to my liking. However, this recipe was a great base!

The Good: Can't wrong with butter and heavy cream!  The Bad: very oily/greasy because of all  the butter.  Also, I followed advice of others and added red pepper, about a teaspoon.  I also doubled the garlic.  I'd make it again but cut back on butter and maybe thin the sauce with a little of the pasta water or maybe some chicken broth.  Also this does create a good base to sub the shrimp with chicken.

As written, it’s pretty boring, not a lot of flavor. Needed a lot more seasoning, even after I pumped up the volume on herbs and added some sautéed mushrooms and onions. I’ll try a different recipe next time.

Agree this is great base. Added garlic powder, onion powder and a bit more whipping cream and cooked on med stirring often until cream thickened. Then added shrimp after cream was thicker. Will even use this as just a cream sauce fir pasta without tye shrimp. Very yummy.

My family loved it, but I did think it fell on the "bland" side a bit, even though I increased the garlic, added white wine, and offered lemon wedges and red pepper flakes on the table.  As previously stated, it's a good base recipe, but needs tweaking (such as not so much parsley and uncooked shrimp).  I would cook it again, though.  Chicken could be really good with it instead of shrimp.

I made this with the Argentinian frozen shrimp from Trader Joe’s, which has a nice sweetness.  I followed the recipe exactly other than a little less parsley since the bag of shrimp was only 1 lb.  I served it with sauteed Brussels sprouts.  Delicious and easy!

I did make some changes but think it would be excellent, if extremely rich and perhaps a tiny bit bland, as written. My main complaint is that it does not make enough sauce for that amount of pasta — the amount of shrimp is fine but it needs more liquid.  My changes:  2% milk plus cornstarch, 1/3 the butter (plus a generous spoonful of light sour cream at the end). I doubled the garlic, used dried basil and subbed a small amount of green onion for the parsley (my parsley was a little sad looking), plus I added a few generous pinches of Cajun seasoning. People put their own Parmesan on. Oh yes, and I added some sliced sautéed mushrooms; I bet asparagus would also be great.

I followed the recipe, however, I missed where it stated "cooked" shrimp. I didn't notice it until the next day when I was reading the recipe again. 
I used fresh shrimp and cooked them in the cream for about 3 to 4 minutes. I then added the basil, parsley and thyme and finished the recipe  as stated. The shrimp was tender and delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed this delicious meal.
I will definitely make this recipe again and I will try it with the chicken also.

I made this last night for supper and it's delicious!  I actually forgot to put in the parmesan cheese but honestly it doesn't need it.  Served it with a simple salad and garlic bread, so good!

This was very tasty and easy as well. I wanted to incorporate veggies into the meal so I cut up onions and red peppers and mushrooms to cook with the garlic. Other than that I followed the recipe. Served it over linguine with parmesan cheese.

It was great.   Will make again.  Looked up recipe since I had shrimp that had to be used up.  Only had 1/2 & 1/2  and dried basil & angel hair pasta.  Probably used a bit more cheese.  Used a sprinkle of red pepper as some said it was bland .  Nice and easy and quick.   Can easily make your own substitutions from this basic recipie or use as is.

it was easy enough to make. I made only half the recipe, since there are only two of us left at home. There are also spaghetti noodles, because I am the gluten word ??. After finishing it, I noticed it was missing a little flavor, so I added some German spices and a little gravy binder, because it was a little to runny for my dinosaur tastebuds. Will try it again though, with the whole gang here in the next few months.

All star recipe. I too used half & half and found it plenty rich.  Mincing the garlic brings out more of a kick.  Precooked shrimp were tricky as I wanted them to be hoy but not overlooked. Make sure they are at room temperature and only go for 60-90 s condos.  
Rule #512?? One can never use too much Parmesan cheese

I absolutely loved it! I didn't use any fresh ingredients, all my ingredients were dry flakes (basil, thyme, parsley etc.) However i used about 2-3 tbsp worth of dry basil and parsley flakes. I kept the measure for the thyme the same. I added about 1 tbsp of salt and half tbsp of pepper and it came out fabulous. At first i was wondering why the sauce was thin, but after you add the Parmesan it will thicken to an alfredo. Tasted like red lobster!

Excellent and fast!  Mine looked much different than the photo; more fresh, less creamy.  I followed Valerie's recommendation and cooked my shrimp separately with a couple of strong shakes of chili powder, just 3 minutes.  I also used fresh basil and parsley.  There was a tablespoon of butter on the bottom of the pot, so I might lighten the butter a bit next time.

The only changes I made to this delicious and very easy recipe was I used quite a bit more fresh garlic than the recipe called for and I used bow tie pasta. The other reviews stating the recipe was bland were not accurate in my opinion. The thyme and basil were perfect. My 5 year old granddaughter loved it. Will make this again.

Delightfully quick and easy.  I'm not sure why some are saying this is bland. I'm guessing they didn't add enough salt and pepper. I subbed dry herbs instead of fresh and added them earlier to all cook together. I even forgot the thyme and it was still delicious. I used whole milk instead of cream because it was what I had. I imagine this is decadent made with cream! I'm saving this recipe to make again, next time with thyme too.

Quick and easy.  I used frozen (thawed) shrimp because I had it on hand.  I also didn't have the fresh herbs.. but I made do with what I had on hand.  I added some fresh spinach because I wanted to use it up.

This is fantastic and super easy! I went by the recipe 99%, only changing the type of pasta to bowtie. I used cooked frozen shrimp from the grocery store, fresh basil and real garlic. After tasting, I added a little crushed red pepper, I will add this to the seasonings next time in the cooking process. My wife loved it as well and wants it to be put in the regular rotation for weeknight dinners.

I used fresh herbs, added some garlic salt, minced onions and some red pepper flakes. I also boiled my linguine with a Knor's chicken bullion cube and boiled my shrimp for 3 minutes in it too. It was very good.

I used radiatore pasta for this. Flavor was very nice. I wish that there had been more sauce, especially for leftovers. But, my hubby said he liked it just the way it is and asked me to make it again.

I love this recipe! I don't find it bland at all. I think reviewers who find it bland probably aren't using quality parmesean or fresh ingredients. If it wasn't so fattening I'd make it all the time! Worthy of 5 stars!

This recipe has a great taste, but I found that there was not enough sauce for the amount of pasta. I think 12 oz of pasta instead of 16 oz would be just right. For those who found this bland, I'm guessing they don't like fettuccini alfredo. The taste is very similar but with the addition of garlic and herbs. Also, don't forget the importance of salt in any pasta recipe. Your pasta water should be salty like sea water to make sure the pasta is properly seasoned during cooking. Check food network if you don't believe me, that is how professional chefs cook pasta.

I used two pounds of shrimp and 1 1/2 cup of heavy cream. I also use fettuccine instead of linguini. Family loved it!

I tried this recipe for Supper tonight, and used Ricotta cheese rather than the cream, and it turned out fantastic! My husband was quite happy with it, too! :D

Great easy recipe. I suggest adding the cheese to the sauce before the pasta. Helps thicken the sauce up quick.

I wanted to save calories, so I used whole milk and the  corn starch that was suggested. Of course, it didn't thicken as much as I would have liked.The 1/2 cup of Chardonnay was a good suggestion, as well as the increase in garlic, basil, and parsley. It didn't need pepper. We enjoyed it, I'll make it again!

Delicious but with a little twist of mine. Instead of whipping cream I used a can of cream of mushroom and added 1% of milk ( I don't really measure I added half of the can with milk) I also added some Spanish sausage in the sauce to add more flavor as well as extra garlic, parsley, thyme and basil. Added some cream cheese and some corn starch to thicken the sauce. I sprinkle the cheese on top and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Oh and just a bit of red pepper flake. Loved it

Excellent recipe.  I added extra garlic, Cajun seasoning, and made extra sauce.  Husband and son ate it all.  I was out of Basil and Thyme, and only used parsley.  So good.

Very quick and easy to make and very tasty.  I had concerns that the sauce wouldn't be thick enough when i poured it from the pan, it was awfully runny, but it thickened right up once it was mixed with the cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very tasty!  Was cooking at the end of the week so I had to sub a bit.  Didn't have the heavy cream but used low-fat sour cream and a bit of mayonnaise and this worked well.  I actually think the mayo gave it a nice zing.  Also, I added a bit of red pepper as other reviewers suggested.  Easy and delicious!  Even the kids liked it.

This was a really good recipe, and it was not too difficult. I just used the tiny salad shrimp and that made it pretty cost effective. My husband said he would like if I made it again, and he does not usually like cream sauce.

Better to add cheese in the sauce too.  Otherwise, can be a bit on the bland side.

Yummy. Had some left-over coconut milk so mixed that with 1/2 & 1/2 to make 1 cup, instead of the cream. Also only had 1lb. of shrimp, so cut it into bite-sized pieces so it went further. Very, very good, didn't have much leftover!

This is a perfect recipe. My kids love it when I make the spaghetti with the white sauce... LOL. I didn't change anything at all.

This is an easy to prepare and tasty recipe. I made as directed, except used 2% milk and thickened with flour (as another reviewer suggested). I added additional basil and thyme and had lots for leftovers the next day.

I followed this recipe to the T and it came out delicious. My husband said, it was yummy, better than at the Italian restaurant we frequent :)
Next time I'll try to substitute the heavy whipping cream just to make it less fattening. I will definitely make this again and for the record, it is super fast to make.

As many others I had to substitute the whipping cream.  I used fat free cream cheese.  This was wonderful! I loved how fast it was to fix.  Thank you!

This was a really good dish but I like a thicker sauce. I whisked 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour into the cream and that made a great difference.

I used a lb of shrimp because it was all I had and all fresh on the herbs.  I substituted the whole cup of heavy whipping cream for a half cup of heavy whipping cream, half cup of almond milk, and added flour to thicken it up until it had a good texture.  The flavor did end up being bland so I added seasoning till it had good flavor, I ended up using chili powder to kick it up a bit.

This recipe was really good and it was super easy. This is a recipe I could make on a weeknight when I have no time.  I used all dry herbs and it still tasted great. Thanks for sharing it.

Great recipe!  Great taste!  My family enjoyed it.  I did double the sauce, and used 1/2 and 1/2.  I would thicken it a bit next time.  Will definitely make it again!

This dish was excellent and my family enjoyed it.  I did make slight changes.  I sauteed the srhimp and garlic and added 1 tablespoon of tomatoe paste then added the rest of the ingredients.  Prior to pouring over the pasta, I mixed the parmesean cheese into the cream mixture then poured it over the pasta.

We love seafood pasta at Shells in Florida. I'm always asking for the recipe, of course they keep mum. My husband had this Shrimp Linguine today and said it was better than Shells. That is the highest rating in this house. Shells serves it with fresh bread and butter to mop up all the yummy sauce.We don't eat like that at home. We are adding all the other seafood they add at Shells next time-clams,scallops,steamers clams..can't wait. I did add more butter to the sauce because Shells has it floating in butter. How can it not be good? Maybe once a year I'll serve it with fresh bread and more butter!!!Paula Deen would be proud of me..butter and cream!!

Very good!  Needs more sauce though so next time I will probably double the amount of sauce.  I only used about 1 lb shrimp and that was more than enough.
