These are excellent, and rather quick to make!  I flip them once I see the chicken turning white on the edges of the top side (about 3-4 minutes), then another 3-4 minutes.  They come out crispy, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  The reason this doesn't get 5* from me is that seasonings get lost when mixed with breadcrumbs.  If you want truly delicious chicken, season it directly.  I season both sides of the pounded breasts, rub with a sprinkle of flour, then dip in egg, and finally plain panko.  Trust me, this method makes a difference.

Made Mazola's Crispy Panko Chicken Breasts last night. I thought the recipe was interesting because I actually make something extremely similar all the time -- Tonkatsu, which is a Japanese pork cutlet dish. I gave the recipe 5 stars mostly because someone reviewed the recipe unfairly and gave it one star. Yes, the chicken cooked up nicely in 2-3 minutes per side. Caveat - you have to pound thin. I actually cut the breasts in half lengthwise so they were thinner to start with. Also, what I did what I do with my Japanese dish...I dipped first in milk, then in flour, then in egg, and then in the panko, and pressed the crumbs into the chicken. I don't usually add spices to the panko, though -- that's the major difference...the spices gave the crispy crust a bit of a salty taste, but I can see how that would appeal to some people. We had an epiphany during dinner, though...this is perfect ON TOP of the salad we had for dinner. And my other teenager dipped it into a sauce similar to chik-fil-a sauce. Very good, and I'll be making it again, especially with salad. Thanks, Mazola!!

Delicious chicken! Plenty crispy, and the spices were perfect. I wasn't able to get them quite as thin as the recipe wanted, so I cooked them a little lower and slower. We all really enjoyed this, and I made extra to have for lunch the next day (they did get soggy but still tasted great in a wrap).

Excellent! This was very easy and perfect for a weeknight meal. I'm not big on frying but I wanted to give this a try and I'm glad I did. To save time I bought thin sliced chicken breasts. I did add a little milk to the egg mixture and a little grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley to the panko bread crumb mixture. This was done in no time at all and came out very crispy, moist and tender! Definitely a recipe I'd make again.

I used chicken thighs but other than that followed the recipe. The chicken refused to cook all the way in the oil so I threw the rest into the oven and then the middles cooked but not the outside.

Loved it! I'm timid when it comes to cooking any kind of meat, but even a newbie like me couldn't mess this up. :) I cheated a little and used some chicken breasts that were already individually prepackaged with italian seasonings, and they came out perfectly savory and crispy. Will be making this again.

I've been making this for years, and I always use panko. My daughter used to say "I HATE this chicken!" and then ate every bite. So, I called it "The Chicken You Hate." The only thing I add is lemon wedges to squeeze over the chicken breasts. The lemon juice adds another dimension.

I liked this recipe, it was simple and quick. 
I dipped my chicken in flour first, then egg and panko. Even though I pounded flat, these cooked about 3-4 mins per side. The chicken came out crispy and perfectly browned.

Turned out great heated olive oil in a skillet and brown the Panko coating a little bit and this made it very crispy and then I cooked at 400 degrees in the oven for 15 min. Delicious

Excellent chicken.  I had very thick chicken breasts so cut them into 3 thin layers.  2 breasts made 6 nice little chicken pieces.  I followed this Mazola recipe to a T and they were perfect.  Such a quick weeknight meal, I'll be making this again for sure.   I had some leftover honey mustard sauce that went perfectly with our rice and chicken.

This was really tasty even baked.    I don't like to fry, so I baked it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Pounding the chicken made it so tender too.

Very good!  I used my own spices. I used some garlic pepper and ranch seasoning mix and they turned out great! Paired with some steamed carrots and cheesy potatoes and it was a hit.

This is the best recipe for fried chicken I have ever had! It’s not heavy and has a really clean texture and taste. I understand what people are saying about it not being loaded with spices so it might be a bit bland. If you’re looking for a fried chicken recipe this is it! Season salt etc. can be added to taste after it’s cooked. You could also increase the amounts of the spices in the Panko. My family is picky eaters and they love this!??

Excellent! I like the suggestion someone made about dusting the chicken in flour, then egg bath, then bread crumbs... made all the difference in the world. I was afraid I had over seasoned these, but quite the contrary. So much of it comes off in the frying. I look forward to trying this again.

I made this with tenders and it turned out great. I used a bit more oil because the pan I used was quite large, but it did not make the chicken oily at all.  We would have liked a little more flavor, so next time I will follow some reviewers' suggestions and season the chicken,  not the breadcrumbs. Overall, nice quick dinner suitable for parents and kids alike!

BEST BREADED CHICKEN I’VE EVER HAD. We had chicken (breasts) strips with rice one nice and made extra to cut up and use the next night for chicken Caesar salads. TO DIE FOR.  Will definitely be using this a lot in the future.

Great recipe! I looked up how to flatten chicken breasts and used the method of placing them in a plastic bag and then pounding them with a rolling pin. It worked great. This recipe is easy and delicious. My husband commented on how good it was before I even had time to take my first bite. I will definitely make this again.

Great receipe. I substituted Lawrys seasoned salt and applied all seasonings to the chicken breast before dredging in flour, egg and panko. I didn’t have corn oil so I substituted veg. oil. Turned out great.

My kids loved this and they are super picky.  Just make sure to get the chicken really thin or the outer crispy layer can burn as you wait for the chicken to cook!

Great basic recipe.  I used chicken tenders.  Next time I'll flatten a bit as recommended.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for dinner last night, and I wasn't surprised that our 3 young daughters loved it! Who doesn't love fried chicken breasts? I was in a hurry and only seasoned the egg with Onion Powder, Garlic Powder and Seasoning Salt. It's a keeper for sure. Also, side note...these 3 seasonings are great alone on a sautéed chicken breast as well!

We loved this chicken recipe. I rubbed some spices on the chicken prior to breading it. It fried up a beautiful golden brown, and was nice and juicy inside. The key is to make sure to pound your chicken out thin.

Great meal! I took the advice of the other poster(s) and seasoned the chicken with the spices & sprinkled with flour BEFORE dipping in egg and breading. I made twice the amount of spices as called for in recipe as I wanted to have a lot of spices for both sides. In hindsight, it ended up being a little too salty so next time I will cut the salt but still make double amount of other spices. It was very flavorful and every one of my family loved the dish, even my picky kids (which, literally, NEVER HAPPENS) I cooked on the skillet for a little longer as we liked the breading extra crispy. I paired this with the roasted potatoes & Rosemary (also on this site) and steamed broccoli. A easy weekday meal that made every one happy :) I will be saving this recipe for future use

Made exactly as directed and came out awesome. No changes except for the cooking time, needed more time as I didn't pound down the chicken enough otherwise will make this again.

So nice I've made them twice! And will make them again and again. Easy preparation and nice and crispy. The Mazola Corn Oil cooked the Panko up light and crispy with a great taste and the chicken stays juicy. Great Great recipe!

These are and were a huge hit at our house.  The cooking process is perfect and it provides a juicy but crunchy piece of chicken.  We have been using this recipe to make various other dishes, such as chicken farm, chicken dijon wraps, and just to eat plain.

Really delicious weeknight meal choice.  I didn't pound the breasts as thin as directed,so I just cooked them a little longer.  I also seasoned the chicken with the spices (didn't measure) before dipping into the egg and left the panko unseasoned and plain.

Very Important Disclaimer - I cannot fry!! I like to stir, and I like to bake/roast/broil/grill... but oil in a pan is not my thing.
That said, I decided to give this a try anyway! And it actually turned out ok. This is a very simple recipe, but it is important to pound the breasts as directed, or cook a little longer.
Teen boy-child went back for more, so I'm calling this a success!

Coating all falls off the first time you try flipping it, makes a big mess and the end product is just a plain old dry chicken breast like any other with a pile of burnt coating for garnish, would not recommend.

If anyone has trouble with this recipe, as in the chicken wasn’t cooking properly, it’s due to your oil not being up to temp before cooking.

What a horrible mess this made.  I couldn't get the breadcrumbs to stick at all and ended up with a pan full of breadcrumbs and naked chicken.  Yes, I used the egg.  Something is missing from this recipe.

Overall, i found it to be bland. Next time I would add more seasonings, and maybe flavored panko crumbs. It was pretty simple and easy to make though.  Did follow it to the letter.

I didn’t have any Panko so I used bread crumbs instead. I seasoned the chicken before dipping them into the egg and bread crumb mix. I also added grated Parmesan to the crumb mix as well. After browning the chicken, I put them in the oven for 375 for 10 mins just to be sure it cooks all the way. Family loved it!

These were so yummy! Even great the next day :) I used almond flour instead also make sure that your slices of chicken are super thin! I would use pre sliced smaller pieces next time cause it was hard to cut. Will definitely make again. Fiancé loved it!

My Wife and my mother in law loved it but I may not be a fan of Panko Crumbs with chicken. On the other hand, the next day I used it for two sandwhiches. One with mustard and one pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese. That's when I realized it was missing some type of  wet topping.

It was a hit! I used regular breadcrumbs with Parmesan chees. Easier!
I made two versions, one with my home made sauce and on e without any sauce. Both delicious, but the favorite in this home was with the tomato sauce!

It was good and I think the chicken breast  I used were too thick. It took longer to cook but I used my meat thermometer to be sure they were cooked long enough. The spices were good. I will make this again.

Not sure if I managed to get them as flat as is directed, so I cooked them a min or two longer on each side, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  My husband said it was "cooked perfectly"  Next time I might play around with the seasonings some more, but it's really good as is.

This was awesome!! 

Substitute some Gluten Free Bread Crumbs (I personally used Kroger's Italian Style) in the place of  Panko, and you get a delicious and quick chicken recipe!

really easy recipe and it turned out delicious! I found the inside to not be cooked completely so I had to put it back on the stove  to cook. I added a little cayenne for a bit of kick. I plan on making this again!

Great! Used regular breadcrumbs because I didn’t have Panko. I always over do it with chicken because I’m afraid it’s not done enough, so these were a little extra crispy, but they were good! Used garlic powder instead of onion powder. Again, because that’s what I had.

I did make a big change instead of dipping in egg I used Ranch salad dressing, then the panko it was delicious & moist, alimanting the spices, cause the ranch has it...I think I will try creamy Italian next time.

Great recipe, I think I could have had better results if I managed the temperature better. I fried a few breasts at a time and by the third batch (I doubled it) there was a lot of fried debris in my oil. I don't fry much so my inexperience showed with how oily they were. I'll get better and will use it again.

I made it as written (except not the brand names) and the whole family loved it!  We decided to have this regularly.  My grocery store (Safeway) has some boneless, skinless, thin-sliced chicken breasts which I used and very little pounding was needed.  I also cut each breast into thirds to have smaller pieces that would cook evenly.  A favorite!

Very happy customers in my household! Like others said, I seasoned the chicken with a little salt and pepper before breaking and I did flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs and it came out amazing! :) I paired it with kidney beans and rice (I was craving kidney beans lol) I will definitely make again!

Very easy to cook and easy to pair with.  I actually used smooshed rice chex, and the results were delicious!  The tip I give will only be useful if you are a chex user, but after bathing the chicken in egg, do the smother technique with the breading.  Don't just flip and flip again, sit the chicken in there, and pile on the breading while pressing it in.  I did need to make a double batch of breading as a result, but it was worth it.  Great spice combo, thanks!
