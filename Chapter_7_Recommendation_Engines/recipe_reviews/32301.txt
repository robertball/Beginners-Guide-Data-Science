I did have problems getting this to burn correctly, so I finally just made the drink.  It was tasty, although quite sweet.  I'd probably really like it more if it were a little more rum or a little less schnapps.  But don't you just LOVE the name?  It reminds me of Wyoming, one of my favorite places!
