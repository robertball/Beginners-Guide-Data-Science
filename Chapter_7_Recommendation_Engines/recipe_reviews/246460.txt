I can't attest to how the Knorr's side comes out with this as I can't have it and made Best Spanish Rice (from this site). Otherwise, made recipe as written and it was perfect--easy to make and delicious! Love the flavors here! I also used this recipe to stuff some bell peppers (make ahead freezer meal) and added canned black beans (drained, rinsed) to the mixture. Thanks for the recipe bd.weld!

The rice mix was mostly noodles not rice. So it got mushy. The chipotle overpowered any other flavor. This was mushy goo. Won't do this again.

Chili is now my favorite food because of this recipe! Such a quixotic and tenacious dish! My teen even approved!
