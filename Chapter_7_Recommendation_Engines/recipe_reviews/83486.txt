Tried this recipe - it wasn't as spectacular as I was hoping for (I still prefer the traditional eggs), but certainly still good!

I always use Marzetti Slaw Dressing-it eliminates the more mustard, no more mayo. Think they are just great every time.

This has been *my* deviled egg recipe for over 20 years. I love the taste and not having to mess with measuring out vinegar,  etc. as other recipes call for. These have a lot of "zing" to them. Glad to see the post here!

This recipe adds a nice zip to the eggs.  This is the only one I now use.
