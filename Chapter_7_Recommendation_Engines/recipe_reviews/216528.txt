One of my husband's favorites (a bit on the heavy side for me though).  He always uses Guinness and changes out the lager according to how he feels, but often uses Eye of the Hawk.  There is a cute little gadget on the market for making these called a Black & Tan Turtle, it sits on the rim of the glass and you simply pour the stout over it.  Unnecessary when you can use a spoon, but it's cute nonetheless.

I use an absinthe spoon.  More manageable. Smithwick's is better.  I use Extra Stout; more robust.

One of my most favorite bar drinks! I never knew how to make this at home so for me it was always one of those "order when I'm out" kind of drinks. Now, I know how. You're a rockstar! Thanks, Christina!

This is one of my favorite drinks besides a Guinness draught poured correctly.  A great variation on this is the Black and Blue -- Guinness and a good blueberry ale. The flavors really work well together.  It's like Ireland and Maine in a glass!

the drink is called a black and tan or a halve and halve.  A black and tan in the Irish civil war was an English supporter.  It is a fantastic way to lighten the bite of a straight guiness

I love Black and Tans.  My wife isn't a big fan of these so she prefers something a bit sweeter, like Snakebites or Dogbites, which use the same concept but consist of a dry apple cider (like Woodchuck) and either Newcastle (Dogbite) or Guinness beer (snakebite).

The drink is fine but it should be noted that the name "Black and Tan" refers to British paramilitary forces that did a lot of harm in Ireland during "the troubles" and so may offend some Irish folks, especially on St. Patrick's day. The drink can less offensively be called a half and half. Less colorful name, I know, but still a good drink.

The tool worked well for me using Guiness Stout on top of Land Shark, which gives a very light colored bottom layer for contrast.  Insterestingly, a small 2.25 inch diameter glass worked perfectly while a larger 2.75 inch diameter mug did not work using the very same beers and technique.  This happened twice so it was not by accident.  Evidently, a smaller lower level diameter (or small diameter overall) glass helps prevent interface mixing.  Also, it helps to pour the top as slowly as possible.
