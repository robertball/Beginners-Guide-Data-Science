The ingredients are great, but I have suggestions for the preparation.  First, chop the broccoli and cauliflower into small pieces (1/2 - 3/4 inches).  Second, don't serve immediately; give the vegetables a little time to marinate (maybe a few hours).

Nice summer salad.  I was looking for something different to use up some cauliflower and broccoflower we'd bought.  Substituted pecans for the almonds, as it is what we had on hand.  Would definitely make again.

We used all broccoli as we had no cauliflower and bottled vinaigrette. We had the almonds on the side as some members of our family don't like nuts.  A great way to enjoy broccoli. Definitely will make again.

Looking for a way to use up broccoli and cauliflower I came across this recipe.  I made the 'Red Raspberry Vinaigrette' dressing from this site to go with the vegetables.  We liked the salad, but didn't love it.  I used all the requested ingredients, but thought a balsamic vinaigrette would have been a better choice.  All in all - still glad we tried the recipe.

Used a bit more vinaigrette - was delicious and even those who hate broccoli/cauliflower (especially raw) loved it.

This is delicious!  Thanks for sharing.  I have made this several times now.  I like to use purple cauliflour.  It looks nice and doesn't discolor from the dressing.  I use Kraft Light Raspberry Vinaigrette.

Very good as written.  However, I didn't have raspberry vinaigrette dressing, so made one from this site.  The salad is good immediately, and better as leftovers later.  Note:  add the strawberries just before serving.

Although we made this a few times, no one in our family seemed to like this recipe, sorry.  We eat lots of salads.

Tried this and really liked it. If you're not a fan of eating raw vegetables, you might not  like it.  I loved it the next day too. I dont think you need to serve unmediately, good when flavors meld.  I Used pecans instead of almonds.
