Thanks for this oldtime recipe.  My cousin had given it to me years ago and I made it several years at Thanksgiving, then lost it.  The grated cheese on top does sound weird, but it really makes this a unique congealed salad. This is my favorite recipe.  Thanks again.

This was an excellent recipe.  The taste was great, and I didn't think it was that sweet.  I didn't add any cheese to it, but topped the custard sauce with a little cinnamon.  The only that I didn't like is guessing how long you needed to let the custard set to the proper chill.  There were also some other things that didn't have a time limit set.  I think for a first time cook or beginner, it would be a good idea to do this.

Very refreshing gelatin  salad.  I made this with sugar-free gelatin.  Cut nicely and held it's shape to serve individual servings.  Would be a nice salad to mix up the jell-o flavors and the fruits.  The topping has a very nice taste to it.  Will be making this one again.
