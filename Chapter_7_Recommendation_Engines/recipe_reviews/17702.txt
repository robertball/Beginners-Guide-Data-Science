WOW! this was a huge hit at my house. I took the advice of others and watched the amount of liquid I used so it wouldn't come out too runny. I made a full batch and used only 1/2 c. of chicken broth instead of 3/4 and it turned out perfect. I used the same amount of cayenne as the recipe called for because I can handle spice, but for those who are sensitive I suggest cutting the spice in half or less. I doubled the garlic, added some chopped onions in while sauteeing the peppers, and a couple pinches of dried oregano and basil and it turned out AMAZING! I'll definitely be making this on a regular basis

This is a very nice recipe.
 
The concerns regarding the watery consistency can be remidied by cooking down (and finishing) the sauce to taste including the cheese, BEFORE you add the sour cream. 

Sour cream does not like to be cooked nor does it reheat well...any sauce that you have added it to, will loose most of it's flavor. What was once yummy becomes flat...It is best used and eaten at once.

Great recipe.  It's delicious and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding chicken and little more cayenne.  It reminded me of the Penne Rosa you can get at Noodles restaurant.  Next time I'll make it more like the penne rosa by adding some fresh tomatoes, spinach, and mushrooms.

I just got done eating this dish.  i added the Cayenne pepper, after saute'ing the peppers garlic and onion, it toned down the kick alot, i also used only a 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and 1/2 cup of broth, as for the thickness debate on this recipe, its all in the simmering =), My GF said it was still too spicy for her, so i think i'll use 1/4 tsp of cayenne, best thing ive noticed about this dish is its cheap to make, cost me less than $10, and took only 20 mins to make. this dish is at least worth a try if you like cayenne pepper, red peppers and garlic =)

I also added onions with the peppers and served with grilled chicken. Both added a lot.  I also used a tomato basil fettuccine and this was a great compliment to the pasta.  Don't use a parmeson and romano blend - I tried that and it did not melt well in the sauce.  The parmeson worked great. I will make again.

Really good. I loved how quick and easy this was. I followed the recipe as is with the exception of reducing the amount of cayenne (have small kids). I think next time I will add italian sausage or shrimp. As for the runniness of the sauce - if you let it cool for a bit it thickens right up.

This is an awesome recipe.  I had no idea something this simple would be this flavorful.  It is definetly spicey, I reduced the cayene pepper to 1/2 tsp and it is still spicey but everyone in the family eats it, even my 2 year old

We loved this!  I added chicken and cooked it before I cooked the peppers.  Was so easy and quick. Great for summer because you don't have to heat the kitchen up with the oven!  Will definitely be making again very soon!

This is an awesome base recipe!  I read a number of reviews and incorporated some of the things that others suggested.  I doubled the garlic, used one red pepper and one green pepper and added a diced onion and some escarole to the vegetable mixture.  I also added some hot poultry Italian sausage that had been browned and crumbled first.  Instead of fettucine, I used linguine because it's a little lighter.  I didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted plain Greek yogurt.  I love spicy so I used closer to 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  This is a keeper!!

Enjoyable.

A few notes however.

1. I think onions were needed. I added a medium onion, cut in half and thin sliced (maybe just a bit less of medium); but, I think it needed the flavor. I sauteed that with the red pepper.

2. I did use olive oil vs a spray, it needed that little bit of fat.

3. Garlic, I did add more; the recipe WAS FINE as is; just a personal taste, I love garlic. NOT necessary to add more.

4. THE SAUCE IS NOT RUNNY, it is just fine

5. I do NOT add the sour cream with the broth to simmer. Sour Cream should NOT be cooked. Add the broth, reduce the heat to low, and simmer 5 minutes until it reduces slightly. Remove from the heat, then add in the sour cream and mix to combine. The heat will warm it right up.

6. Toss with the pasta, however; it does need something green. I added plenty of fresh parsley and fresh basil.

7. Tasty good as is. But, I added chicken to make it a complete meal. I had grilled some chicken before, and thin sliced. It was excellent tossed with the pasta.

The second time I made it, I didn't add chicken, but added 1 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms which I sauteed with the peppers and onions. Both were very good. The recipe is very good

I'm choosy about anything I give five stars to. I believe it needs to be really special in some way. While this recipe probably isn't the best cream sauce I've ever had, it's certainly very very good. To be sure, it's not alfredo sauce - it doesn't claim to be.  But it's superb for what it is. What I really appreciate about this recipe is the variety of ways in which it can be prepared and served.  It can be prepared as written and served as a side dish or an appetizer.  It can be a foundation for a chicken breast, steak or hearty fish.  It can also be prepared with additional veggies and sautéed chicken or shrimp and served as a main course.  I run across very few recipes that are truly as versatile as this wonderful little pasta dish is.  It's a hidden little gem that can be tweaked as much as the cook wants or not touched at all - and it will turn out perfect almost every time.

This recipe was awesome. Quick & easy.  I added turkey bacon while sauteing garlic, red peppers & cayenne pepper. I used Farfalle since I didn't have fettuccine on hand. Spices were just right as posted for me. After the pasta is added, the cayenne pepper isn't quite as strong as while it is simmering on the stove. Definitely a keeper recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This was very good.  Took previous advice on using just 1/2 c stock and added sour cream at END of cooking.  I also roasted the pappers which made them even sweeter and went well with the cayenne.  Served with tilapia dusted in a mixture of shredded parm, minced garlic, and breadcrumbs and baked at 425 for 10 min.  I think I would use penne or cavatappi next time.

It's a nice recipe for how easy it is to make.

I cooked some cut up  chunks of chicken in the pan before and along with the garlic and peppers. I think this dish wouldn't be as good without the chicken.  It really is almost a requirement to me.

The amount of liquid, cheese and sour cream should be adjusted by the cook to get the consistency desired (boiling off more liquid as needed) since it can be too runny or too pasty if you're not careful about it.

I made half portions of this recipe and probably put in as much or more cayenne than the recipe said (I didn't measure, but put in a good amount). It wasn't over-spicy by any means because the sour cream and cheese counteract the hotness some.

Certainly it's smart to put in the cayenne gradually and to taste, especially if you're a spiciness wimp, though.

GREAT PASTA!! I added some sliced chicken breasts while sauting the bell peppers.  I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp so that my daughter could eat it but also added a dash of cajun seasoning and a dash of onion powder. Call the health experts on me but I used regular sour cream (instead of low fat) and penne noodles instead of fettucini. Very good - I could have used a little more heat but my family thought it was perfect for them. Would make this simple but tasty dish again!!

Great way to use up leftover sour cream.  I read other reviews that said they had a runny mess. I had zero problems with that.  Instead of using 3/4 of a box of pasta, go ahead and use the whole 16 oz.  The more pasta, the more to soak up the sauce.  Also, I read a review that suggested not to cook the sour cream, so I didn't.  I cooked the bell pepper with some onion until it was softened and added garic at the end so it cooks up but not burns. I drained any juices.  Then I took it off the burner and added the sour cream so it starts to warm up slightly while I add the rest of the ingredients, including 1/2 cup of broth, not 3/4.  I kept mixing it, noticed it still had chunks of sour cream so I put it on simmer until the sauce was creamy which took seconds. Poured it over the pound of pasta and there was no sauce at all left in the pot or running on our plates.  I also put in 1/4 cayenne, but might have been too little. Oh and I just used 1 large bell pepper. I ended up chopping instead of julienning out of sheer habit, doesn't really matter anyway hehe. I served this w/ some flavored grilled chicken breast on top.  Delish! Update 10/22/09: I served up leftovers with 2 cut up chicken breasts, let them marinate a few min with lemon juice, salt, pepper and basil, plopped them in the oven for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. My husband loved this with the pasta.  Try if you like, its super easy and very tasty :)

I thought this recipe tasted great.  I added some diced chicken that I had pre-cooked and frozen, and also added a little white wine (maybe 1/4 cup).  The consistency of the sauce seemed very thin even after adding the cheese, but it thickened after I added it to the pasta and let it sit for a few minutes.  If I had reduced it down to the thickness I expected it be, I would have ended up with pasty pasta.  I only used 1/4 tsp cayenne, which was just enough spice for my taste, but next time I'll omit it completely (my picky 2-year-old liked it, but I didn't want to give him too much because of the cayenne).  I will definitely make this again.

I love this dish.  The one thing I change is I saute cut up chicken breast in oil with seasonings and then add the other ingredients, without draining the oil.  It adds more calories, but well worth it.  It is good to splurge once in a while.

I am a pretty utilitarian cook...my family likes my food, but it's not too fancy.  This recipe tasted like it was made by a professional, and they were so impressed with it! I cooked just as the recipe directed and they raved about how perfect it was.

This was NOT appreciated by my family. There was way too much parmesan and it was too runny. Not good tasting at all.

This dish is delicious.  Very easy to make.  I find that it's better to add the cayenne pepper with the sour cream, otherwise it causes me to sneeze.  The sauce may seem a little runny, but once you add the pasta and let it sit a few minutes, it gets absorbed.  A favorite in my house!

I substituted vegtable broth for chicken broth and added store bought grilled vegetarian "chicken" cut up into cubes into my portion, and actual grilled chicken to my boyfriends portion, and we both really enjoyed it. Really flavourful, I can't stand bland dishes so this was fantastic.  I used less spice originally, then added a bit more to my portion when I separated it into 2 pans with the different types of chicken, because I like more spice than my bf.

I really liked the flavor from the bell peppers. Into the saute I added about 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes and an extra clove of garlic. I used fat free sour cream so the sauce was a little thinner. Based on others' suggestions I used 1/2 cup of broth, added a pinch of oregano & basil, and cut the cayenne to 1/2tsp. Your sauce will be thin at first until you put the parmesan cheese in it. I would also recommend not rinsing your pasta--the extra starch serves as a great thickener.

I was not expecting to be that impressed but my entire house LOVES IT.  We cooked it just like the recipe states the first time... then liked it so much we made some additions. We chopped up a 1/2 lb of bacon, fried it and put it to the side. We sauteed the red/orange peppers, garlic and ONIONS in the bacon grease (i know. healthy. but we love bacon). In addition to the cayenne we also added basil and oregano.  Let the sauce simmer while the noodles were cooking, added the bacon, then the sour cream and cheese and POOF. PERFECT dinner. Its super fast and fun to play around with.

It only gets a 4 stars because my husband loved it and had two helpings. I didn't care for this at all and pushed it a side and ate something else for dinner instead, but of course I'm pregnant so maybe my tastes will change next time. I added chicken and a few red pepper flakes along with a tiny bit of cayenne. I do not like cayenne pepper much. So, it will stay in my recipe box and I'll make it another time after the baby is born.

We really enjoyed this and plan on keeping it in our regular rotation. It was an excellent meatless dish. I only made a couple of additions but nothing that changed the recipe. An extra clove of garlic, 1/2 an onion . I found for us 1/ 2 tsp cayenne is enough. Very nice light dinner. I also followed the advice of other reviewers, I tossed the sour cream in at the end. I often use jarred red pepper . Thank you for sharing. 9 WW plus.

Surprisingly flavorful considering the ingredients sound a little plain. I added a little extra cayenne pepper as well as diced chicken. Delicious!

YUM!!! Too good to be healthy, but it is! I used whole wheat angel hair pasta, 5 cloves of garlic, 1 red & 1 yellow bell pepper & 8oz pkg of sliced mushrooms. Used butter flavored & olive oil flavored Pam as well as little bit of real butter to sauté peppers, mushrooms & garlic. Added some garlic salt, onion powder & used about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Simmered the chicken broth & Parmesan cheese together, then removed from heat and stirred in sour cream. Tossed it all together & drizzeled some balsamic vinegar over each plate of pasta...wow...amazing! The balsamic vinegar really brings the flavor to a whole different level!!

I made this a couple days ago, and it was a hit. I only used 1/3 tsp cayenne, added crushed red pepper,onions ,and more garlic. I also used mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and I only had one red pepper, so used one orange, one red. next time I will add more peppers. The flavor was exceptional, very restaurant quality. would definitely make again.

I made this last night and we really enjoyed it.. It was much better than I had anticipated!  On most nights I don't get home until 6:15 or 6:30 so it doesn't allow much time for cooking a good meal but this one only took me about 15 minutes!  I decreased the amount of chicken broth & sour cream by just a little bit and added a dash of oregano and basil as one review mentioned.  I also had some leftover grilled chicken from two nights before so I heated and cut that up and then added it to the peppers and spices in the skillet right before I mixed them in with the pasta.  This is definitely not just a "make once" meal - I will be having it many times in the future!

This dish was amazing!  The flavor hits your mouth the moment you put a bite in.  I cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp and there was still enough spice to make it lively.  I used 16 oz regular spaghetti and should have doubled the sauce.  The recommendation to use more Parmesan is right on.  Plus I used two heaping tbs of pre-minced garlic.  I added diced chicken and shrimp to make it more hearty.  Will definitely be making this again!

I LOVE this recipe!  The first time I made it, I didn't think it was turning out right because the sauce is thin, but once you add the pasta and the cheese, it's perfect.  I usually only use 1/4 tsp cayenne and a I saute a chicken breast in cajun seasoning before I saute the peppers.  I also sometimes add zucchini and/or mushrooms and use linguine noodles.  One of my favorites!

It was a little on the spicy side, but I love spicy food! If you don't like things mouth-watering hot or if you are serving children, then you might want to cut the cayenne pepper in half. Overall, very good!

Wow, this was soo good!  I  didn't have fettuccine, so used penne instead.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly and it was a knockout.  Will be even better with grilled chicken, which I'll add next time around.  If you don't like much heat, you may want to lessen the cayenne, but we loved it as is.  Will definitely make this again... soon!

A quick easy side dish. Not your normal rice or potatoes. However I found the sauce to not be moist enough. So I took the sauce ingredients and up it to one and a half times the amount shown. Worked out perfect

I'm taking summer classes in my college and don't have a meal plan so I was interested in some quick easy foods I can make my self.

I have literally made and eaten this dish happily for lunch EVERYDAY starting May 13th (it's June 10th) and don't plan on stopping. Very quick and I love spicy food so it's a perfect combo for me.

I added a bit, at the beginning of the week I prepare some kitchen on a flat stove with sesame oil (any oil will work, sesame was all I had access to and it tastes great) and recently have been adding a bit of Tiger Sauce seasoning to the chicken. I store it in tupperware in the the fridge and pull it out every lunch and toss some already cooked sliced chicken breasts in the sauce at the very end, then add a bit more tiger sauce seasoning. Tastes great, gets you some meat in the dish if the peppers and pasta aren't filling you up.

This was a very good basic recipe. To bump it up a bit, I substituted some of the broth with a 1/4 cup white wine. After simmering with the sour cream, I added about 3/4 cup chopped fresh basil and 1/2 pound of cooked shrimp and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. It turned out very well, but could be improved by perhaps adding a 1/2 cup of the pasta water to keep the pasta from sticking together. I will be making this again.

Definitely something I'll make again. And it took so little time, it might become a staple for nights I get home late.
I didn't have any sour cream (because I dislike it), so I used cream cheese. I also used vegetable bouillon/stock instead of chicken broth and added spinach and ham to the pepper (which was green and diced, not red and julienned). I let it cook down a little longer than the five minutes, and then kept it on very low flame as I added the cheese, right up until I dished it out.
It turned out absolutely delicious. A little zestier than I was expecting (the cayenne took me a bit by surprise). Very rich and muchmuchmuch better than something I'd get at a restaurant. The sauce itself was incredible.
Next time, I might use butter instead of cooking spray.

My rating is based on my changes.  After reading several reviews, I made the following changes:  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves and used roasted garlic.  I used 1/4 t. of cayenne and wished I would have used a bit more.  I could only detect a very slight amount of heat.  I added only the chicken broth and simmered for 5 min., turned off the heat and stirred in the sour cream and parm. cheese.  I also added grilled chicken.  I thought the flavor was fairly good and the consistency was tolerble to me (I experienced only slight graininess from the parm. cheese).  I would probably make this again using my modifications.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Julieliz!

I try to have at least one meatless meal a week, so I chose to make this pasta dish. The taste of this was wonderful! I used orange bell peppers because it's what I had, and I added diced onions. As others said, the sauce was thin. I tried to lower the calories/fat by subbing plain yogurt for the sour cream. The yogurt curdled and then the parmesan cheese just melted into one big clump.  I have no idea what went wrong because other reviewers didn't mention this. So it must have been a problem on my end. Next time I might just top the plated dish with the parmesan. I did reduce the cayenne to about half and was glad I did. I liked the taste of this so much that I will try it again.

This was delicious, but I made several modifications.  I used a 16 oz package of pasta and added baked chicken, 1/2 an onion and mushrooms, and then doubled the sauce.  I used a lot less cayenne pepper than the recipe called for.  First, in a saute pan, I melted butter in a little olive oil.  Then, I sauteed the peppers and onions until very tender (longer than 5 minutes).  I removed them from the pan and put them in a blender, along with some of the chicken broth.  I pureed this until it was smooth and added a couple of tbsp of cream.  Meanwhile, I added sliced mushrooms to the pan with the garlic.  Then, I returned the sauce to the pan, added the sour cream, cayenne pepper, and Parmesan cheese.  Because of other reviews saying that the sauce was runny, I added the broth slowly but wound up using all of it.  I added the cooked pasta to the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes to soak up some of the sauce.  The result was a creamy, delicious dish!

WOW!  This is FANTASTIC.  BOTH Mr. LTH & I thoroughly enjoyed this for dinner this evening (I had to make myself stop eating so I could have some leftovers to enjoy for lunch tomorrow)!  The tweaks I made to the recipe were to up the garlic since I was using jarred and I decreased the cayenne to 1/2 tsp cause Mr. LTH is kind of a sissy when it comes to spice (I would have enjoyed the full 3/4 tsp).  I was concerned it would be a bit warm for him (it has a nice heat, even w/the 1/2 tsp), but he really enjoyed it (and he's rarely a fan of pasta entrees).  As all of the ingredients are staple at our house and this is ridiculously easy to throw together, I foresee this becoming a weeknight staple at the LTH house.  THANK YOU so much, Julieliz, for submitting this recipe!

Pretty good!  I added baked chicken, used 1/2 the red pepper, and opted for rotini pasta instead.  The sauce definitely had a KICK with the cayenne, but it was nice.  I'm not huge into spicey foods, but the parmasean and sour cream balanced it out well.  Will make this again, I think.

Very tasty. I made the mistake of adding more cayenne pepper than the recipe called for. that was a mistake. Would make it just as it is for best flavor. Maybe just a little more salt.

Sooo delicious. I think next time I may add some broccoli for a little more variety. I love the heat. It's not too much but definitely sneaks up on you. I will make this a lot more.

This is very good and very easy, but also VERY spicy as written.  My husband is a huge spice fan and even he said it needs to be toned down.  I would use 1/4tsp instead of the 3/4 next time.

Turned out great. I used basil and oregano and subbed angel hair. It turned out great. I also added onions to the sautee and white wine. Chicken is a total must for me since my boyfriend must have meat with every dinner. The broth and sour cream amounts are fine as long as you take your time and let simmer. I may double the sauce recipe next time. GREAT MEAL. super great with a nice warm baugette

This was an excellent recipe and we loved the base flavor. We like spicy food so I added some red pepper flakes and more garlic. With just those minor substitutions it had a great kick to it and was a hit!

i LOVED this recipe! I took the advice to lessen the amount of chicken broth and in order to cut on the calories, I only added about 1/2 cup of light sour cream and 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese. Honestly it still tasted creamy and delicious! I also added grilled chicken (marinated over night) mushrooms and chopped onion. My family compared it to a dish of restaurant quality! This recipe is a keeper and so simple too!

My family loved this dish! We added grilled chicken to the mix and let the bell pepper mixture simmer longer in order to cook off some of the excess chicken broth - perfect amount of spice as well!

I followed the recipe to the tee, and then added grilled chicken.
1) it was painfully spicy--and i like spicy food.  The recipe name should just be "pepper-cayenne fettucine" and "sweet" should be omitted from describing even its ingredients.  
2) the sauce is way too watery and soupy. There is no harmony between the pasta and sauce.
3) the chicken I added was the best part, absorbing the extra cayenne.
I will now be faced with the challenge of having to correct this dish so it can be eaten as leftovers.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of others and cut down on cayenne so it wasn't too spicy, and I think the key was to reduce the sauce before adding the sour cream as another suggested. Thanks for the easy, yummy recipe!

Can only give it four stars because of my goofup.When I went to the store, I didn't get any sour cream because I thought there was some in the frig. at home, and also was low on parmesan cheese.So what I wound up doing was use two 6-oz. containers of Yoplait Key Lime flavored Yogurt in place of the sour cream, but only had about 1/3 cup of parmesan. Used what I had, and it came out pretty good. Wife really liked it.

This is an excellent recipe with   restaurant quality- we loved it. I did slice up some  chicken breast tenders , mushrooms, and onion. I also added 2 T cream cheese to the sauce with the sour cream and added only  1/2 cup broth( but will use more broth next time) - My husband  said he could smell it when he came home today and  he had 3rds..so I wil be making this again. Its very pretty with the red peppers too.  I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne and it was  hot enough for us - thanks for sharing your recipe!

Added some fresh spinach, and I only had 2/3 c. sour cream left, so I subbed in cream cheese.  Sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley.  The vegetable-hating boyfriend and brother loved it... will make again and again... probably with some asparagus next time.

We made this a couple nights ago and it was delicious!  DH and my sister both loved it as well.  We did thinly slice a chicken breast (1/2 lb) and cooked it with the peppers.  Next time I will probably try adding shrimp.  Our 6 thumbs up!

Quick to make.  I had to stir it a lot after I added the cheese to smooth the sauce out.  But the taste was great.  I cut the recipe in half, and the servings were huge!!  Which is okay, 'cause now we have tomorrow's lunch.

This wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it was great.  I didn't find the dish spicy enough, which I suppose makes me an oddity  compared to most of the other reviewers.  It's a matter of preference, I guess.  I think I might try this recipe again, but I will increase the amount of garlic and cayenne.  I will also reduce the simmering time and the amount of cheese I add at the end;  I had a problem with the sauce thickening too much and turning into a paste.

This meal was awesome!  It had a nice bite to it & was very flavorful.  We also added chicken pieces to the sauce.  Penne Pasta went well with this meal too!

I was disappointed with this recipe...it didn't turn out as well as I thought it would.  The sauce was runny and the cayenne pepper was overpowering the other flavors.  Thanks anyways.

I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne and this was too hot! I would start with 1/4 tsp, then add more after you have tasted it. I used bowtie pasta which seemed to work well. I would also use a little less broth so the sauce would be thicker. Other than that, it is a pretty good recipe.

This was okay, but i wouldn't make it again. Because the recipe didn't specify fresh or ground cayenne pepper, i cut it to a 1/4 tsp of ground, and it gave it a good flavor, but it wasn't very spicy. If I were to make it again, I'd up it to 1/2 tsp. Mainly, i didn't like that the sauce ended up being more of a paste once the pasta sucked it up, which was probably a result of the reduced fat sour cream.

I will definitely serve this again, since my 2-year-old loves both red peppers and sour cream. However, I had trouble using freshly grated parmesan cheese. It all melted and clumped together when I added it to the sauce. Next time I'll use the canned variety and add some of the fresh stuff on top.

This recipe was delicious.  I liked the heat on my tongue and it seems to be just the right amount of heat.  This description makes a good sauce for the entire meal.  I added sausage coins.
I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was tasty and spicy. I only used a 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I don't think we could have handled more.  I had second thoughts about adding the parm to the sauce. It gets clumpy instead of smooth. Next time I'll add a bit of cream cheese and keep the parm for the topping. I liked the flavors. (The sauce goes really well with zucchini noodles too).

I've made this recipe many times and have adjusted it a bit to suit my preferences.....I stir-fry the peppers in a bit of oil instead of cooking spray, and use garlic powder instead of fresh just to save time. Once the peppers are starting to brown a bit I add some chicken broth (I never measure it), just enough to cover the peppers, and let it simmer. If it starts to go dry, I add a bit more broth, and keep simmering until peppers are done. I make sure there's about a half inch of liquid in the pan when they're done, and remove from heat and sprinkle a layer of grated parmesan on top, whisk it in with a fork till smooth.  Then add 3 large spoonfuls of sour cream and stir in.  Add the drained linguine to the pan and stir to coat the noodles.  Best eaten right away but I sometimes have leftovers and they're fine.  
I use the cheap brand of 100% grated parmesan, but the one time I had Kraft brand and used it, the cheese went into strings instead of blending in with the sauce.  It was awful.

I don't know how "healthy" this dish is, but it's very good, easy and quick.  Although calories were reduced by using the low fat sour cream (I used fat free), I believe the parmesan cheese and sour cream still hold their fair share of calories!  I ate a small helping, coupled with a large salad and staying within my eating plan for weight reduction.

Excellent! I did get a bit nervous that the sauce wasn't thickening up even after adding the parmesan cheese, so I made a roux (1 tblsp. butter and 1 tbls. flour mixed over heat to a paste) and added that to the sauce, which then thickened things up very nicely.  I also added broccoli for some more nutrition cook.  

Over all excellent recipe and definitely recommend.

Made this recipe last week and I followed it exactly. Definitely going to make again and tweak it just a little. Less cayenne (boyfriend thought it was too spicy) and either a little less parm or same amount but using parm that is fresh. I used linguine because that is what I had. Also plan on adding shrimp and a little onion next time :) overall it was a decent meal, and even better the day after!!

Amazing! My husband LOVED this recipe and so did I. After making it a few times I finally decided to change it up. NOTE: This recipe is good AS IS. 

My Changes: marinate the chicken in sweet chili sauce found in the Asian aisles, add onions and mushrooms for substance and variety. Pairs very well a salad or baked cauliflower.

WOW. I made this as a side tonight and I wish I'd made enough to make it the main dish. Admittedly did not make it exactly per recipe... My family is wimpy when it comes to spice, so I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp. That gave it just enough heat to be noticeable without actually being spicy. I also used full-fat sour cream and forgot to add the parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper (though we didn't seem to miss them). Such a flavorful, simple dish! Definitely a new favorite. 7/19/16 edit: I prefer this without the cheese and I think next time I'll replace the sour cream with coconut milk and add broth till I get the consistency I want. Edit 4/9/19: Severely disappointing with coconut milk. Tried to salvage it with extra garlic and it was still incredibly bland. Back to the original for me!

I played with this. I added in a white onion and doubled garlic.  Sauteed the onion, garlic, and peppers then added the chicken broth and simmered a bit. Dumped that in the blender with the parm cheese.  Back in the pan to add sour cream to heat thru.  Served with leftovers from this..Grilled Chipotle Chorizo Chicken Sausage & Shrimp Kabobs.

Not impressed with this recipe. The Parmesan cheese seemed to make the sauce gritty. We ended up pouring jar sauce over the pasta. Won't be making this again.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I halved the recipe, except for the garlic (you garlic lovers will understand, LOL).  The only addition I made was some Italian sausage I had cooked earlier in the day.  For those of you cooking this the first time and who might have some concerns about it being runny, keep in mind that the simmer stage will take care of that.  In fact you need to keep a close eye on it as it can quickly go from runny to too dry.  Also remember that the parmesan cheese added at the end will thicken the sauce up some.  As I was eating it, I thought to myself that some broccoli florets would be a nice addition and in reading other reviews I see that some other people have done just that.  This is worth fixing again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was wonderful, even though I had only one red pepper on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe. I made it more or less as printed.  It's a nice change from marinara-type sauces.

Made this for our Meatless Monday...fantastic!  I just added my touch: some frozen peas, scallions, fresh nutmeg, 2 wedges of Light Laughing Cow swiss cheese, shredded Pecorino Romano, only 1/4 tsp cayenne (hubby!); mixed lite sour cream w/1 tsp flour (so no curdling) and fresh linguine.  I can't wait to make it again for Fish Friday, adding shrimp!  Hubby and I both said KEEPER!!!!

This was pretty tasty, but I was disappointed in the consistancy of the sauce...it was VERY watery (I couldn't thicken it up for anything, and pretty much all of it was left in the bottom of the pot), so we really couldn't taste the sour cream. Also, the parm. cheese ended up clumping all throughout the pasta for some reason (maybe b/c the sauce was so watery???) I do have to say that this had good flavor (I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.), but it wasn't the way I hoping it was gonna be. I was hoping for it to be creamier. I also added in sauteed mushrooms and onions, which added some extra flavor. Hubby was more forgiving about the sauce than I was...he rated this a 4 and I rated it a 3, so I would give it a 3.5. I would definitely play around w/ the sauce more, but I will try it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I cut down the sour cream and used some heavy cream to make up. I am not a big sour cream fan, and next time I may omit it altogether. Also used one yellow and one red pepper for color and a few strips of grilled chicken left from lunch. My kids want to use green fetticini next time too.

This was very tasty, I changed it a bit for individual preference but only in the spices. This was a great recipe overall. I am doing weight watchers and so I look for healthy points plus friendly meals that I can eat and that I can get my two young children to eat. This was great. They liked it as well as I did. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  Fast and easy...however, we like our pasta dishes a little more saucy, so I think next time I will stick with the 1 cup sour cream, but try increasing the chicken broth to 1 cup.  I did also decrease the amount of cayenne pepper by half, and I might try doing even less next time, since it was still a touch too spicy for my little ones!  Thanks for the super recipe!!

I made this as-written.  It was all right, but would have been better with the red peppers halved and something else added in.  It just had an odd texture with so many red peppers and nothing else in it . . .

DELICIOUS!  I used whole wheat pasta and added grilled chicken and fresh spinach.  I doubled the red pepper and added extra garlic  My husband loved it.  I served it with garlic bread sticks.  You could add any veggies in with this and it would be good.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I made modifications because it is a great base recipe. After reading other reviews I also added portabello mushrooms and spinach. I rarely measure so as I was making the sauce I used the whole container of sour cream and probably a little more than 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also used a generous amount of cayenne and ancho chile powder. Through in some pre-cooked shrimp and the parmesan and it was amazing! I will defenitely be making this again but will probably use a different pasta because my fettucine was sticking together badly and had to toss it a lot with olive oil to get it apart. But YUM!

Very good!  Even great the next day.
I only used 1/2 the spice and added chicken.
The hubby and kids thought it was okay to pretty good.  But I really liked it a lot.
This can definitely be a base recipe that can be changed around to taste and for variety.
Thanks for a great, simple recipe.

This dish was delightful!  I used regular sour cream instead of the low fat, and penne pasta instead of fettuchini.  next time I want to add some dried basil and oregano as per another reviewer.

I used bell peppers instead of cayenne, my boyfriend can't handle the spice. This was a really good dinner, but should all be eaten and not saved for leftovers. I made it for my boyfriend and I and we had a ton left over, but it wasn't nearly as good reheated.

My husband pronounced this, "Absoultely delicious!" I agree. Used 5 cloves of garlic, 5 ounces sliced crimini mushrooms, 1 thinly sliced red onion, and as others recommend 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 tsp cayenne, as husband doesn't like the hot. So Good! I let in simmer on low after mixing in parmesan and sour cream and had no problem with the sour cream not blending. It was perfect and easy. A definite keeper!

I found that I had to keep adding to it to make it flavorful, so it turned out to be not so healthy.  The cayenne was overpowering, although I love spicy.  I think with a few tweaks this could be a good one.

As delicious as it is SPICY!!  As per other reviewers, I put the sour cream in just before pouring over the pasta.  Italian crusty bread went great with the sauce... Will be making again very soon.

This was quick and easy for sure.  I was out of fettuccine so I used penne instead.  I read some of the prior reviews and added some white wine for flavor and included some peas for extra color and veg factor.

Very good, I even customized it by adding Johnsonville Three Cheese Italian Sausage, whole mushrooms, also I only sprinkled cayenne on it during cooking since my daughter can't handle the heat!  I will make this again it is simple and fast.  Good dish!

I've made this recipe a few times with mixed results, depending on what cheese I've used.  I try to cook with low-fat or nonfat whenever possible, but I've found that using a low fat Parmesan cheese usually makes the sauce come out sort of chunky rather than creamy.  I also use vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth since my girlfriend and I are vegetarians.

This was terrific!!  I love cheese!  I followed the suggestion of another poster and reduced by low-sodium chicken broth by 1/4 cup and it was not right!  Mixed pasta and sauce turned out dry on the top and no one likes dry pasta!  That was my fault though....I will try it again with the full 3/4 cups of chicken broth, I think it'll be perfect!  I also omitted the cayenne sauce because my 8-year old nephew was eating it.  He loved it!  Delicious sauce!  I used low-fat sour cream, so yummy!

I really liked this recipe. It was quick and easy. It defied all my expectations! I did reduce the chicken broth to a half a cup. I also waited until the end to add the sour cream and cayenne pepper. I have a three year old that couldn't handle the heat. Yummy!

I'm sorry but I didn't like this recipe. It's quick and easy, but I don't like the sour cream base.  I cut way back on the cayenne because I like just a little kick.

AMAZING! The sauce tastes just like my favorite restaurants (that is 2 hours away) Bacon Spezie! Now that I know I will add grilled chicken, shrimp, small bits of bacon and top it all with some melted cheese.  Its going to be a meal we eat often in our house.

I've made this a few times and really like it. Too spicy for my three year old, but he's ok with butter noodles instead ;)

This was excellent! I followed others' advice and used only 1/2 cup chicken broth, and mixed the sour cream in last. I added basil and crushed red pepper flakes, and substituted fat free sour cream to make it a little healthier.  Overall, it turned out to be fantastic and we'll definitely be making this again!

A Giant YUM! I doctored this a bit....followed other reviewers suggestions. 1/4 tsp. of cayenne was plenty for zing - but not bite. I used a whole can of fat free chicken broth and slow simmered 1/2 of a large sliced sweet onion with 1 red pepper, 3 cloves of minced garlic, artichoke hearts quartered and drained (canned in water) and simmered until soft. Actually had to add some water towards the end - my veggie cooking had become more like broth. I added Paprika, dried Basil, Parsley, and used cut up cooked chicken from Costco in the sauce at the very end. This was amazing! Used it over Rotini noodles.

Cannot wait to try this again. Hubby LOVED it - said it tasted like something he would order in a restaurant. I want to add broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, summer squash, more garlic, more onions, carrots and serve it under BBQ'd chicken breasts or grilled salmon. 
10 stars! Gonna be a new staple at my house!

We loved this!  Added diced chicken breast, onion, wine and paprika as others had suggested.  Thought we had cayenne but didn't; used red pepper flakes and chili powder.  It was wonderful!  Would be great for entertaining!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I wish I would've followed this recipe instead of reviews. I don't see where the broth should have been cut. In fact, next time I might even use alittle more. Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this! I used one pepper, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 t of cayenne, 1/2 cup broth and 1/2 cup cheese. It turned out great and the consistency was awesome.  I did taste a lot like the Noodles restaurant.  Next time, I'll add chicken.

Absolutely delicious!! Everyone in the family loved it so much that we will definitely be adding this recipe to our favorites. Can't wait to make it again-it was super easy and super quick, too. Very tasty with just the right amount of heat/spice.

I tried this even though, admittedly, I was not sure if we were going to like it.  It was awesome.  The only alteration that I made was I added some hot paprika to add more flavor to the 'heat'.  No leftovers (and that never happens).

EXCELLENT, easy recipe!! Fast preparation - even for me, where it normally takes me about double the listed time to prep...very spicy dish though, so for those with sensitive tastes, decrease cayenne by 1/2 or more.

This was my first review 2 years ago:
This was OK.  I liked it, but my husband found the cream sauce to lack appeal.  I don't know how to really add to this recipe and I don't think I will make it again.

I decided to make it again and it is now a 5 star recipe!  I sautéed peppers and onions until translucent, added a bag of fresh spinach and then added the garlic (add garlic to soon and you scorch it).  I then added the 3/4 chicken broth plus a can of diced tomatoes drained and the full amount of cayenne.  Simmered it on high until a lot of the liquid was gone.  Added sour cream and parmesan after taking the pan off the stove.  Had to add a little more chicken broth because I simmered the sauce too much!  I recommend others to keep the full liquid and simmer it down because the sauce this time was fantastic!  Added salt at the end and my husband and I polished off the entire dish!  He loved it too.  My only word of caution is the dish is quite spicy if you use the full amount of cayenne.  I was sweating by the time I finished.

Delicious recipe, will definitely make again! Love the flavour of the bell peppers and it's got the perfect amount of kick to it. The only thing I changed is I used Balkan-Style Yogurt instead of sour cream, and it turned out just fine.   As the author suggested, I expect this will taste awesome with grilled chicken-- so adding that next time!

YUM!  Been wanting to try this out and finally did last night!  I usually do not enjoy spicy foods but this has a nice kick to it.  It does not hit you at first, but it will!  Also, after reading the other reviews about the sauce being too runny I only put in 1/2 cup of the chicken broth and it turned out PERFECT!  Thanks!

The sauce looked too soupy at first but after adding the parmesan cheese it was perfect. Very delicious and satisfying. I'd recommend going light on the spice if you're not a fan of spicy. Otherwise, make it just like she says!

I made this last night and we both enjoyed it. Under the advice of other reviewers, I used only a 1/2 cup of broth, let it reduce a bit, and then added the sour cream and cheese.  It was delicious with the sweetness of the red bell peppers and the spice of the ground cayenne pepper.  Will definitely make this sauce again!

I made this pretty much as is and it was YUMMYI was worried as I was makingit, didn't seem right until the ckn broth and sour cream- then it all came together. I made it with less cayenne so my daughter could have some but I think I need to give it more kick to give it more the the 3.5 star rating. I did add some lemon garlic rotsierre chicken I had in the fridge- I will absolutley make this one again!!!!

Not too many dishes are easy, fast, low-fat and delicious, but this one delivers! I followed one reviewers suggestion and waited until the way end to add the sour cream and it was perfect -- not runny at all! Next time I am going to add grilled chicken...yum!

Great recipe. I don't like red peppers so I always make it without them and it still tastes great. I've made it with shrimp many times and it's absolutely delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and used a little less chicken broth and it turned out great. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

I read the other reviews about reducing the broth but I did not reduce it and I am glad.  I also did not reduce the cayenne as we like the heat.  I can see where it might be a bit much for some though.  I followed the recipe for the sauce as written and everyone enjoyed it for dinner last night.  The only change was that I served the sauce over the pasta rather than mixing it all together.  Also sprinkled a little Italian seasoning over the top, adding an extra touch of color for a prettier presentation.  I like the fact that this is a simple recipe that comes together quickly.  That said, the flavor is good but not very complex.  Served with a house salad and rosemary bread for dipping in the sauce.

I made something very similar (used this as an idea/jumping-off point)- I only used a couple of spoons of Greek Yogurt in place of the sour cream and used about 3/4 cup (estimate) of almond milk rather than broth (it's what was open in the fridge).  I also added a handful of fresh basil and a tomato from my garden that needed to be picked and used.  I put it all in the blender and pureed it together with some salt and extra red pepper flakes (in addition to the cayenne)- just warmed it a little in a pan and then added to the hot pasta to keep it as raw as possible.  I actually ended up eating quite a bit of it as "soup" (just another taste.. and another) while prepping it!  I love dishes like this that let you use lots of veggies in a whole new way.

I took the suggestions of other reviewer's and only used 1/2 cup chicken broth, and this still came out super runny. Also, this did not have much flavor, it was very spicy, but had no depth to it.

This is a dish I make almost weekly. It is delicious. The only thing I have a problem with is the parmesan. When it melts it globs together and doesn't melt smoothly (I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or what?). It still tastes great. The sauce is very thin. I use a little cornstarch & water mixture to thicken the sauce at the last minute (it only needs just a little!). This helps it form a "sauce" that sticks to the noodles. I serve it with chicken breast sauteed in a small amount of olive oil.

Very good taste but I ended up with a sticky ball of cheese.  It clumped together so was not evenly distributed over the pasta.

Update:  made again and added cheese slowly this time.  I always use shredded parmesan, so I think the problem was adding it all at once.  Such a good flavor.  Used 8 oz. of pasta and there was plenty of sauce.  Yum!

I only cook occasionally and the results are often mixed.  However this recipe made me look like a gourmet chef!  It is simple, quick, and delicious.  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and switched the order of the cheese and sour cream.  (Sour cream added after removal from heat).  I also added chicken, which I feel is a must for this recipe.  Using  a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I marinated them in 3 tsp. of Pampered Chef Jamaican Jerk Rub (brushed on with olive oil) in the fridge for about a half hour, and then baked them in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes.  My lady (the real chef) raved about this dish all night.  5 stars!

Great recipe, wonderful flavor.  I'm rating it 4 stars because it needed a couple of changes to make it 5.  As per other recommendations, I doubled the garlic and did not add the sour cream until the end when the cheese is added.  I also did not julienne the peppers, but rather diced them medium.  One final touch with really helped this dish...after I had mixed in all the ingredients, I spooned about half of the mixture into a blender and pureed it, adding it back to the pan.  Not only did this greatly improve the color of the dish, but it also spread the flavor of the red peppers all throughout the sauce, instead of staying concenentrated in the chunks of pepper.  I boiled 2 chicken breasts as well, which I tossed in at the end.  Wonderful recipe, definately a keeper!

OMG!!!! This was restaurant quality good. You will definitely get rave reviews with this recipe. It is rich in flavor and not that spicy. My family just loved it and couldn't get enough. We will definitely be making this again and again and again!!! :-) Note: Extra parmesan cheese is recommended, but not necessary.

Very flavorful and easy recipe.  I added some chicken but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was QUITE spicy, but we like heat.  I like the combination of chicken broth and low fat sour cream for the pasta sauce.  A nice change from red pasta sauces, and definitely healthier and more flavorful than traditional alfredo sauces.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this tonight, and I loved it. My boyfriend thought it was yummy as well, and he can be really picky when it comes to pasta sauces. Think I may have been a  little too liberal with the cayenne so I'll use less next time. I also added diced grilled chicken. This recipe is fantastic!!!

This is excellent!!!!  A note for everyone who thinks it is too runny, cook the pasta el dente and it will soak up all the juice and it will be perfect consistency.  I did have to cut down the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and added a small can of sliced mushrooms.  Next time I'll try adding different veggies.  Will certainly make again, I would give it 6 stars if I could!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I got this recipe in my email today from allrecipes and needing something for dinner, decided to try it.  I did make a few changes like others did. I only used 1/2 t. cayenne pepper. And it was plenty hot!  I added two small cans of sliced mushrooms when I simmered the peppers and garlic and I grilled 2 chicken breasts on the George Foreman with greek seasoning on them and then cut them up and tossed them in the veggie mix.  

This made a ton of food for 4 people and everyone loved it!  I think next time I will try it with shrimp!  We will definately be making this again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This turned out fantastic even though I had to make some substitutions.  I had no cayenne pepper, so I used hot sauce instead.  I only had 2 cloves of garlic, and had to make up the difference with garlic powder.  I didn't have fettuccine, and used rotini pasta instead.  I sauteed an onion in with the peppers as some others suggested.  I used low sodium broth to cut the salt down.  I had some leftover roast chicken that I cut up and added.  It was a huge hit!  I will definitely be making this again.  I suspect it would also be a great way to use up leftover turkey.

This was pretty good. I liked the idea of chicken so I cubed the chicken, dredged it in flour and cooked it up in butter. When I added the chicken to the finished sauce, the flour on chicken thickened it up. Also, adding the hot pasta to the sauce and letting it simmer for a min. or two helps thicken it up. Thank you!

Not bad.  I didn't use the cayenne b/c I usually don't like it and being pregnant, I didn't want to take the chance.  I added the grilled chicken as well. I had no problem with the consistency, but I used regular fat sour cream.  I will make again, but use more spice, without the cayenne it needed a little something to zip it up.

I really enjoyed this meal!  A great spicy kick.  If you don't like spicy, cut back on the cayenne pepper.  I made it for some friends and they kept saying, "Boy, this sure is spicy."  I'm not sure the enjoyed it as much.  I like to add some grilled chicken pieces as suggested by another reviewer.

This was o-k. I added marinated artichoke hearts, but it still needed something. I didn't make it too hot. I'd rather have more flavor than just hot. Any sugestions? I'm willing to give it another shot.

This is a delicious dish, and pretty.  It is somewhat low in fat also, but it doesn't taste it!  It is a little spicy, but just right.  One of my favorites!  It is not as good as leftovers, but if you add a little additional low-fat sour cream and cheese, it perks up a bit.

I really liked this recipe but be warned it is spicy!  Also as another reviewer commented, to avoid water sauce, cook the broth down before you add the sour cream.  Taking time to reduce and finish the sauce is the most important step.  Also -  I hate buying an entire can of chicken broth just to dump half of it down the drain, so instead i just use some pasta water and chicken bullion cubes to make my own broth and it works out just as well -  plus i can control how strong of a chicken flavor i want to impart on the dish.

Easy, quick and tasty pasta sauce. Definitely start with half the cayenne. That was plenty for this spicy-loving couple. Also, per the reviews, I changed the order of cooking -- first broth only, then add sour cream and blend till smooth, then cheese. Fresh julienned basil was a good addition for color, contrast and flavor.

This was very, very good. I used regular sour cream rather than low fat, only because it's all I had. I also included some chicken breast and sauteed mushrooms. I will certainly make this again.

I just made this and it was delicious! I doubled everything except for the cayenne of which I put 1 tsp and that was a good amount of spice. I might use the original 3/4 tsp next time.  I chopped the red pepper and garlic into fairly small pieces and sautéed with chicken and turkey bacon in olive oil. The bacon gave a nice carbonara flavor and the chicken made it hearty. I had no problem with consistency or curdling of the sour cream i just kept simmering until smooth and i used a full pound of pasta. I also used regular sour cream. I figure as long as im eating pasta....


I love this as a base and will probably vary with other ingredients like tomato and basil. Super flavorful and filling!

This was great. My husband loved it, I don't like spicy food as much as him. Maybe I'll use a little less cayenne for me but he can add some more to his. Made with a salad and some garlic bread. I will definitely make again.

So, just a word of warning: you can't substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream. It's all I had, so I tried it, and it curddled. I managed to salvage it by straining the curddled yogurt and red peppers from the rest of the liquid, then rinsing the peppers off and adding ricotta to the mix. The flavor was great so I'll try it again with the right ingredients.

We found this too overpowering with the cayenne. Will reduce the amount in future and add some grilled chicken to it.

Delicious - Great if you want pasta but something other than tomato or alfredo sauce. Very easy, quick. I followed the suggestions of some other reveiwers: I started off with adding half a small onion in with the peppers and garlic, and then only added the sour cream after taking it off the heat and adding the cheese.

This was so easy to make.  I used (green) spinach fettuccini, both red and yellow pepper, and used cooking cream instead of Sour Cream (didn't have any).  For real flavor, grate your own Parmesan Cheese and don't add any salt.  I included 2 shakes of cayenne pepper which added to the mildly spicy kick.   Mmmmm.   I didn't add any meat, but may add mushrooms the next time I make this.

I followed the recipe, but thought it needed some more color.  I put two large handfuls of fresh spinach for the needed color and nutrition.  I thought it was surprisingly good considering how few ingredients and the time to prepare.  I will definitely make this again, and will be sure to add more vegies for more variety.  Thanks for passing along a simple and fast recipe that is so tasty.

This was good, but it can't compete against my favorite, white clam sauce. :) anyway, no real complaints, just a little plain. It thickened up nice with the parmesan and a little cream, and I love parmesan so I was a happy camper to pile it on.

I cant believe how delicious this turned out! Took advice of other reviewers and cut cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp, broth to 1/2 cup, and added sour cream and cheese after I took the peppers and broth off the heat. I used Penne pasta because thats what I had and used one red, one orange and one yellow pepper. YUMMY!!

Loved this. It is NOT too runny--it reminded of sauces I have eaten in Italy and in authentic Italian restaurants here. The starch in the pasta thickens and the pasta absorbs--maybe the thin sauce people rinsed their pasta? Just a thought. I sued whole wheat penne because that's what I had--perhaps the sauce sticks better to penne? Another thought!

 I used one jumbo bell pepper, fresh mushrooms sautéed in a little olive oil and wine and a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach. I did it this way because my store went from $1 each to $2  for a red bell pepper and thought, "no way, that's outrageous, I'll stretch it another way," and in fact, I am glad I did because there was plenty of bell pepper flavor in the dish with the added bonus of other textures/flavors and it took no more time really. Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!

Great flavor but, like others, I found the sauce way too watery. I'm going to try it again though, and maybe use half cream cheese and half sour cream, reduce the broth to 1/2 cup.

Remember to simmer off all the broth first to make it not runny.  Then, mix in cheese, then sour cream, then pasta.  Made this with lemon pepper salmon in about 20 minutes - yummy!

Quick and tasty!  Used mixed red/orange/yellow mini peppers, mushrooms & onions.  Reduced broth to 1/2 cup, and cayenne to rounded 1/4 tsp.  Sauteed mild Italian sausage separately, and added on top of pasta & sauce.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was just kind of eh to me. The only change I made was reducing the cayenne by 1/4 tsp. I am glad I did that, because it still was hot. The sauce didn't really come together. The sour cream curdled, the liquid was the consistency of milk, and the cheese clumped. I like a thinner noodle, but followed the directions. I think I would have liked an angel hair pasta better. At least it used what I had in the house, anyway.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I did put all the cayenne pepper in and while my husband, one child and I loved it.  The other child complained it was too spicy.  Next time I will try just a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I did do chicken on top which makes this dish even better.

Delicious! The only change I made was to cut back on the cayenne, started with 1/4 tsp and that was plenty for my delicate tastebuds. I also made half the amount of pasta and the full amount of sauce, because we prefer saucy over dry.

I sauteed some onion with the pepper and garlic and then also added some dried oregeno and basil. So my kids couldn't pick out the veggies, I put everything in the blender except the sour cream. Blended it to make it creamy and then put it back in the pan and added SC.  delish! the little ones ate it right up!

Mmmm this was super yummy. I made as-is and added some fresh broccoli in with the peppers. My sauce was runny, but a tablespoon of flour whisked in towards the end of cooking the sauce made it perfect :) This was quick and easy and very, very tasty!!

This might be a good recipe, BUT...the first few photos I saw totally put me off. Shouldn't the cook have any say on what pics are to be printed? I have seen so many good meals butchered by bad pics, this was the worst. Thanks for the recipe Julieliz. I did enjoy it.

I made this as directed except using whole wheat penne, only 1/2 C broth and adding grilled chicken as suggested by the author. Served on a bed of fresh, chopped spinach. The sauce still would not thicken with less broth and simmering it longer only served to increase that grainy texture while leaving it thin with the cheese not really incorporating fully (I used fresh grated parm). It did thicken upon cooling but really not creamy just thick and grainy. I would reduce the broth and add the sour cream at the end next time. The full amount of cayenne makes it spicy to the "burn your lips" stage which is still good but I would use less next time, especially if making for others. I tasted just the sauce, pasta and peppers without the chicken and spinach and if you don't actually get a bite of pepper the only real flavor that really comes through is the cayenne. This is a good base but I think it needs changes to the technique/amounts for the sauce. I would not make as directed again.

This was so, soooooo good.  I cleaned out my fridge and used 1 red pepper, 1/2 each of yellow and orange peppers, asparagus, red onion, and mushrooms, along with some thin sliced chicken.  The cayenne bottle and I had a difference of opinion on how much should come out on the first shake and I think I put about a 1/4 cup in there (!), so it was really spicy, but all the extra ingredients and sour cream toned it down.  Really good base recipe that's super easy to jazz up.  Thank you for posting this!

Five stars for sure, as written. But of course I had to add my own twist anyway. I also added some onions while sauteing the red bell peppers and garlic, then I added diced tomatoes right at the end, just to warm them, then threw in some parsley, oregano, basil and ground black pepper to taste, then proceeded with the dish as written. I love vegetarian meals, but this would also be great if you added some grilled chicken - yum!!

I just served this for lunch for my ship's crew of 22 and it outsold my very popular "beef fajitas". I took note of the issue of this being watery, so I added 2tbsp. of flour directly into each c. of sour cream before adding. Thickens it up nicely.

This was quite good. The cayenne lent a nice little kick to the pasta. Probably not something I'll make all the time, but a good use for leftover red bell peppers for sure. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  My family prefers heartier pastas - i.e., with meat - so I started by browning a pound of mild Italian sausage, then continued with the peppers, garlic, etc.  The flavors worked together perfectly.

This recipe was wonderful! I worried about the cheese clumping together because that is what happened the last time I tried to make a white sauce, and it was such a disaster. But no clumping up here! Great taste, although a little on the spicy side, which is no surprise since it calls for 3/4t cayenne pepper. The texture of the sauce was pretty good, maybe a little grainy from the sour cream, but I would definitely make again. Thank you for this recipe, Julieliz!

Excellent!  I didnt think there was too much liquid like others said...once you add the cheese and pasta (i used quinoa pasta) it made the sauce thick and creamy.  It was extremely good.  My family hasnt had a creamy - Gluten Free - dish in a while, so it was really great!  I did saute chicken before cooking the peppers to give the dish a little more heartyness.  I will make this again for sure!

This is a great creamy white sauce! Probably one of my favorites! I slow cooked 4 pieces of chicken in chicken broth in the crockpot and later used the same broth for the sauce. I sauteed some green onions in with the red bell peppers and red pepper flakes and garlic. I also sauteed fresh spinach and layered on top of the pasta before adding the sauce and chicken. Fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!

I can't say enough how fantastic this dish is.  I have made it twice now and the second time I added asparagus and chicken to it.  Make sure to take the sauce off the heat for a couple minutes before adding the parmesan cheese or you'll end up with a gooey mess.

We enjoyed this recipe, however my family did not find it to be spicy enough. Next time I will add more cayenne and possibly some mushrooms. I did add chicken which worked out well.

I didn't have any parmesan, so I used cheddar, it turned out fine. I will make this again, but I will cook my chicken and let it sit in the sauce for a while. This was a good recipe but I'm not sure it was a favorite.

KEEPER! After reading the ingredients I wasn't so sure about this recipe. But it had such good reviews I had to try. It was incredible... like favorite thing to order at a restaurant incredible! My only modifications were that I doubled the low fat sour cream and sprinkled some red pepper flakes. Do easy and so good!

I really enjoyed this, very easy to make and very flavorful. I personally would add more cayenne as this is not that spicy to me and my husband. I used 1/2 cup chicken broth as recommended by other posters and sauteed the peppers with some sliced mushrooms. I will make this again, thanks for sharing :O)

I made this last night and it is VERY GOOD - I will DEFINITELY make it again 100%... BUT: when made according to the directions the cayenne is just too much.  It overpowers the great flavor of the dish with just too much HOT.  And this is coming from someone that uses Cayenne in LITERALLY every meal I make from Top Ramen to a gourmet meal, I looove HOT but this was too overpowering.

Also I used less chicken broth (1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup,) per some of the reviews, but next time I will use the full 3/4, it wasn't too watery at all, I did the sauce 1st before even boiling the water to cook the noodles so that it would have time to settle.  After the noodles were done and ready to serve, THEN I added the sour cream (which disolved no problem,) and then I added the cheese after the sour cream disolved and poured it right over the Fettuccine and served it fresh.

Excellent! I cheated and sauteed in a little butter/evoo. Then sauteed shrimp on the side to place just over the noodles and under the sauce. Hubby wants it next time with both shrimp and chicken, because there will be a next time. Wonderful, and easy to make sauce. Yum!

This is a great quick cooking recipe with just enough of a kick from the cayenne. As others suggested, I added some vegetables that I had in refrigerator and 1/4 cup of white wine.

Just tried this recipe, and it was delicious and easy to make.  Got a solid let's make this again approval from the husband.  I added canned chicken since that's what i had on hand, worked nicely.

We cut down a bit on the cayenne and loved it just the same.  I was looking for something new and different and we'll definitely be adding this to our rotation!

Wonderful! Substituted Cajon seasoning for the cayenne pepper (heaping 1/4 tsp for a toddler) and put al dente noodles into sauce (3/4 cup). The noodles absorbed the sauce after only a few minutes. I was scared this would be bland, but it's delicious! Thanks!

This tasted quite good. However I found it to be, as others have mentioned, quite watery.

I'm a spice lover and so I kind of shrugged off other reviews about the cayenne pepper being too much. I was pleasantly surprised by how much of a kick this packed. It was too much for my mom who tends to like her spice at more average levels.

I was left feeling that this recipe needed something more. Being a novice cook, I'm not entirely certain what this would be. Adding meat would add some texture to the dish; chicken and/or shrimp come to mind for me. I'll have to try it next time that way.

All in all, it's a pretty good dish, but nothing truly spectacular.

Just made this for dinner tonight--delicious! And so quick and easy! 
The only modifications I made were adding about 7 sliced chicken nuggets (don't judge...it was the only chicken I had) and using only 1 red pepper instead of 2 and chopping it very small (I'm not really a fan of peppers). Next time I may use even less pepper. Still a tad overwhelming for me. :)

My family thought this was amazing! It had just the right amount of sauce and spice without being overbearing. I added some grilled chicken to it for a nice hearty meal. I will definately be making this on a regular basis.

This was excellent. I ran the peppers thru the food processor to make it more sauce like in consistency. A nice change to a tomato red sauce. Thank you.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating based on the couple of changes I made.  The recipe would probably have been fine with more broth, but I did take the advice of others and used only 1/2 tsp. cayenne and 1/2 cup broth.  Loved the recipe with those tweaks.  Think it would be great with other veggies too (particularly onions and mushrooms), as some other reviewers suggested.

Quick and easy, this recipe is a keeper.  As recommended by other reviewers, I used 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper instead of 3/4 tsp; added sour cream right before mixing with pasta;   Important to let peppers, garlic and chicken broth simmer to a glaze.  Next time i will make more sauce for the pasta.  Family gave this dish 2 thumbs up!

Does have a kick, which I like, but was extremely soupy, even after cutting back to only 1/2 cup of broth. I added mushrooms and half an onion for more veggies. Not much flavor here.

Delicious, easy, fast. What more can you ask for?! Added half an onion and sauteed with peppers, only did 1/4 tsp cayenne (as I was feeding to toddlers), added a bit of fine herbs, and used a bit less broth than directed. Served with some souvlaki chicken. Absolutely great, perfect week night dinner when you have limited time to cook.

Red pepper with Cayenne! A great combination.

Instead of sour cream, I used natural yogurt, which turned out great. I also added some onions. I probably added twice amount of the cayenne pepper, because I just love cayenne pepper. 

The great thing about this dish is that it is very simple to make. You mostly likely have all the ingredients at home already. 

It could be slight bland for some people, but after the first time, I plan to customize it in the future. Maybe some tomatoes...

This was easy and quick - a good comfort food dish. I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne and that was enough for me. 
Next time I'll follow others' suggestions and add shrimp, a bit of white wine, and paprika.
If I'm really feeling keen, I think it would be great with roasted red peppers (i.e. done in the oven and peeled). I think that would add a lot to the taste.

I should start off with saying I'm not a huge fan of sour cream unless it's just another ingredient being blended into a recipe.  Unfortunately, I found the sour cream to be too strong in this recipe, making it very bland.  Next time I would use normal cream instead, reduce the chicken broth a bit and add some white wine while the veggies are simmering.  The key is that everything need to simmer for a while to get all the flavours to blend properly - that wasn't possible when I was worried the sour cream would turn out horrible if I cooked this for too long (as per some reviews).

This was a great noodle dish.  Took me a bit longer than 15 minutes, but it was still quick.  I would definitely recommend adding chicken.  I would also use more parmesan, maybe a full cup.  Aside from that, great!

I didn't purposely alter the recipe because I wanted to, but I accidentally used the sour cream in another recipe and didn't have any on hand. So, I substituted a little less than half of an 8 oz block of cream cheese (cause that is all I had, lol).  I also may have added more Parmesan cheese, cause we really like it, plus it helped me thicken the sauce. We really LOVED this recipe. I did add a touch of white wine too. I had some around and not much left so I thought what the heck. lol

This is so easy and quick with a few adjustments this could very well be one of my top go to meals. I halved the amount of cayenne (my husband is not very heat tolerant) and it had just the right amount of pep. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the chicken broth back to 1/2 cup, sliced up a medium onion to add to the mix and used three very large cloves of garlic. Over all the flavor was good but for our taste lacked little something..but its def. worth experimenting with to get just right for us! Thank you for a wonderful base recipe :)

Looked and tasted good. Followed recipe exactly first time through. Not as much of a kick from the cayenne as I was expecting. Would add more cayenne and/or chili powder and/or red pepper flakes next time. Also, as other reviewers suggested, would use less chicken broth; sauce was fairly runny. Good recipe overall though. Thanks!

Yummy, favorful and quick & easy. The only tweak was cutting down the broth to half a cup & adding a bit of chorizo sausage which gave it a slightly smokey flavor complimenting the peppers. As we like our food spicy, we did not cut down on the cayenne at all. For the faint of heart, follow the advice of some of the others and cut down or omit

The whole family ate it, but felt it tasted too much of sour cream.  Might try mixing fat free half & half with the sour cream next time?  Mediocre at best.

This is a great recipe.  Simple and quick.  I added grilled chicken, mushrooms and broccoli for some variety.  Might cut down on the cayenne pepper next time though.  My boyfriend could barely handle the spice :)

This was tasty- a bit spicy with 1/2 t cayenne I will try a little less next time. Needs some onions as well and liked the sour cream consistency though you could probably use some light cream for same result. Chicken could be added too- this made plenty of sauce which was good.

This is very good! It tastes like something from a restuarant! I just made it tonight. I followed the directions of another reviewer and added JUST the broth and parmesan cheese to the sauteed peppers and garlic. I cooked it down for about 5 minutes, then added the sour cream. All I did was stir in the sour cream, I didnt cook it any longer. I made a few modifications...I added chopped onion, more garlic, and more parmesan cheese at the end. I also added a significant amount of sea salt at the end. As for the cayenne pepper, it's all what you can handle. My kids and I are not huge spicy fans, so I cut the amount in half. But my husband loves spicy so I would leave the amount as is if I was making it for him. Enjoy!

Very Yummy! I used vegetable broth (I am a vegetarian), and it turned out very good! I also added 1/3 cup of tomato sauce to it for extra flavor.   Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews about how runny it gets until I have already started. I just added a little corn starch/water mixture, and it thickened right up!

This has a wonderful flavor; very rich. I was a bit apprehensive about the red peppers but they tasted great. I served this sauce over spaghetti squash and it was a BIG hit.

Very good!  I love pasta and spice.  I did add chicken breast and as far as it being runny, I didn't have a problem because I didn't boil the noodles completely.  I added them to the sauce and let it sit for about five minutes and they soaked up the liquid.  I did make it too spicy with was my fault.  I unscrewed the lid to the cayenne pepper instead of flipping it and dumped in a whole lot of pepper instead of just sprinkling a little more in.  I added some more cheese to cut down the spice.

Very tasty, realised didn't have any cayenne pepper so used paprika instead so probably not as spicy as should have been but still nice.  Also sauce appeared too thin so had to thicken with a bit of cornflour.  Very nice though.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe-needed to use up some low fat sour cream from the holidays-added sauteed mushrooms and onions-seemed to need something more so added a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes at the last minute-used vege broth in place of chicken-cant wait to try other variations-add some shrimp or bay scallops-maybe some spinach-or even try with non fat greek yogurt in place of sour cream-will cut back on cayenne next time to 1/2 tsp as personal preference but love this recipe!

Quick and tasty. I halved the recipe for the 2 of us and added 8 prawns. No problem with the sauce, the parmesan thickened it nicely. Used regular sour cream because that is what I had on hand. Also increased the cayenne pepper.

This was really a great "quick and fabulous" dinner. Loved the spice. I followed the advice of some others and only added 1/2 cup of broth, and added the sour cream after simmering the rest a few minutes. Added grilled chicken, was amazing! Next time I'm going to throw some mushrooms in with it. Loved this one.

Good, but not fantastic - definitely not something I would "wow" over like the other reviewers.  If you want the red peppers well-cooked, cook as is.  If you want them a little firmer, cut the simmering time down - but don't add as much chicken broth.  I added the sour cream at the end, with the Parmesan.  And - make sure you use fresh-grated Parmesan, it will make a big difference.  And seasoning with salt & fresh-ground pepper at the end is crucial as well.  I did add some grilled, sliced chicken breast to this, to make it a main-dish meal for us (tossed it in at the end) and I also doubled the sauce so I could use the whole 1 lb. package of pasta and would have enough to coat pasta & chicken.  The flavor is good, but just not something outstanding enough that I would "wow" over it.  I'll add it to my recipe book and I'm sure I'll make it again, though.

I enjoyed this dish very much.  my husband thought it a bit spicy - that's why only 4 stars.  i served with rotisserie chicken and salad.  i will make again scaling down the cayenne.  thought of adding mushrooms next time.  bacon would be delightful but would shoot out the low cal status.

This was really good. As with most, I tweaked it a tiny tiny bit...though I will say that had I made it exactly as it's written (with the exception of the amount of cayenne) it still would have been a really big with my family!!!  If I used 3/4 tsp. of cayenne, I think my family's mouths would have been on fire.  I added 3 large chicken breasts - cut in chunks and boiled. I also added a chopped onion and tomato and sauteed along with the peppers.   I cut the amount of cayenne down to about 1/4 tsp. and added it when I added the sour cream (as opposed to adding along with the veggies).  You can always add more, but you can't take it away once it has been added (and 3/4 of a tsp. would kill my family...though I would enjoy it!).   I used 1 1/4 lb. of fettuccini to feed a family of 5.   Next time I will double the sauce (to accommodate the increased amount of fettuccini).   This was a wonderful easy meal and my family gave it a big thumbs up!  It tasted like chicken alfredo with a kick!  Thanks Julieliz!

Just made a few modifications: used millet instead of fettuccini (a great texture for the excess sauce!), used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and added spinach at the end, after taking the mixture off the heat. I loved the heat/cream combination. The flavor was fun. A definite repeater!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot. The second time I simplified it using 8 oz "Wild Veggie" brand Red Bell. I used dried spice garlic and did all the rest the same. Super simple and delicious!

This is really good. I added chicken breast to mine, and I used about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. While I like it, my husband LOVES it and is asking me to make "that thing with the peppers" again. :)

very yummy but felt is was missing something. hubby andI think some chicken would be just the ticket. I cut back the broth a tad as some have said and the consistancy was fine. I also cut back the cayenne just a tad as well and still has alot of kick. will make again but may get braver and add some other things..

Easy and yummy recipe. I added strips of chicken, doubled the amount of parmesean, only used one (huge) red bell pepper, and added some garlic salt and pepper. Yum!

Quite good, but tasted a bit like pasta with queso dip.  I had no problem with sauce thickness, and I used 1/2 cup of broth.  I also used vegetable bouillon instead of broth (vegetarian) and that worked well.

Very good recipe, and definitely easy to make.  I started with only 1/2 cup of chicken broth, as others had suggested... This caused mine to be too thick, so I ended up adding the other 1/4 cup of the chicken broth.  I added chicken when adding the green peppers and it was very good!

Loved it! Definitely reduce the veggies and chicken broth before adding sour cream. The 3/4 tsp. cayenne was just the right amount of spice for us (even my 1-year-old loves it!), but if you are sensitive to it, you should cut it back to 1/4 tsp. We also added 4 chopped mushrooms and an onion while sauteing the red pepper - yummy! This has become one of our faves.

It was definitely interesting. I've made this twice and the first time it didn't turn out very well because the sauce was too loose. I let the broth reduce quite a bit before adding the sour cream the second time and it was much better.

Yes!  Finally a creamy pasta without all the calories!  This was perfect leftover smoked chicken.  I used all the liquid the recipe called for, let it cook down and added a tad more.  It was perfect!  Thank you!  I think next time I might try this with tilapia and top it with fresh diced tomatoes.

This was a quick dish to prepare and has great potential, but man is it HOT!!! Too hot, in my oppinion. Only one out of 3 were able to actually eat a whole portion. I will try again with half the amount of cayenne.

Help! Loved the flavor, but I must've done something wrong. I am an experienced cook. Did everything as in recipe, but did add onions and doubled the garlic. Somehow I went wrong with the parmesan cheese! When I added it (did remove from heat for a moment), rather than melting in nicely, it kinda got clumpy and goopy....the cheese didn't blend in well. Would like to try it again!

I gave this 5 stars because it is really good easy and inexpensive. I put the whole amount of cayenne pepper and it was good but it lacked flavor, I think next time I will double the amount of the pepper and maybe add onion or eggplant. But thanks! I would have never thought to combine these ingredients if I didnt read this.

Although very good on its own, the thing I changed was to roast one of the two peppers, puree it, and then add it to the mix. I also added onion to the sauteed red pepper. I followed the advice of one and added the sour cream last, after the mixture reduced a bit. It was pretty darn good and went great with a glass of cabernet.

So good!  We slightly modified by using linguine for the pasta, and regular sour cream instead of fat free.  It was so flavorful - actually found it to be a perfect "medium" spicy dish, although I could see how those who don't like spice would take the cayenne down a bit.  Can't wait to cook this again and serve it to friends!

Absolute hit, and the sauce was literally done in the time that it took to boil the pasta. EASY, quick, and even my pickiest ate it with flourish. We sauted so yummy prawns that we caught up in Brinnon (WA) with butter garlic and cayenne. All I can say is YUM!

We didn't have cayenne pepper, but it still turned out wonderfully.  We took the suggestion of one reviewer who recommended waiting a bit until the broth was reduced to add the sour cream.  We added chicken and fresh basil to the final dish - delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  I added some paprika and used penne noodles.  I mixed up all the ingredients for the sauce then poured in over the pasta into a casserole dish. Topped with sun-dried tomatoes. I baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  It was wonderful!

This was good but not great for me.  I enjoyed how simple and fast it was to make, but would consider this more of a base for a good pasta dish than the complete version.  The taste is good but a bit too simple for our taste.  I realize there are very few ingredients, so what was I to expect, nevetheless, it was missing something.  I will try it again but will add fresh basil, maybe pine nuts and definitely shrimp.  That will probably be a more satisfying meal.

I used 1 red pepper and 1 green, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I actually liked it even more the next day.  My husband commented that it tasted like gourmet nachos... perhaps you could use a thicker version of the sauce as a dip!  :)

Great recipe!  This was so easy to make and so good!  I followed others suggestions and blended half of the sauce.  I also added grilled chicken. I will definitely make this again.

I give this recipe 4 stars. I added chicken to it, and next time I make this I'll use less chicken and more peppers. The spicy-ness was just right. It didn't leave my mouth flaming but added a good kick to the dish. My brother loved it and my mom (who is an extremely picky eater) said it was good. This is a definate repeat!  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe! I was a little apprehensive about the amount of cayenne, so I used less and it was hot! But will make again.

YUMMY! This was very popular at my house last night! I added a pound of shrimp that I marinated in a little white wine, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic powder and cayenne for about 1 hour. I added this to the pan after cooking the peppers with garlic and cayenne but before the broth and sour cream. It was delicious! I also used just 1/2 t. of cayenne and it was the perfect amount of heat for us. Thank you so much!

The only thing I would do differently would be to pour the sauce on top of the noodles instead of mixing together. It seemed pretty dry when I mixed them together, the noodles soaked up the sauce.
I added chunks of turkey breast that I made before hand and also added in some onion, GREAT flavor. 
My hubby said it was good, I added more cayenne to my plate because I love spicy food.

There were no leftovers at our house tonight! I added sliced mushrooms and sweet onion to the red peppers. As other reviewers suggested, I only used 1/2 cup chicken broth. Since it was still a little more runny than I usually like, I sprinkled a little cornstarch while stirring to thicken it up a bit. With that said, this was a fabulous meal. We loved the spicy flavor and look forward to trying it with chicken sometime. Simple, quick, and, most importantly, delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly. I did cook chicken first and added at the end. It was very good.  Served it with french bread and roasted garlic  (which I am about to write a review on now)I reheated it today for lunch and added a drops of milk to cook on stove and tasted great. Fiance' said it was delicious.

This was great! Made a few changes. Didn't have red pepper so i used green, yellow and orange. Added chicken, onion, extra garlic, oregano & basil. I only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and it was perfect. Served it over basmati rice.
Oh and I used the whole amount of broth. As long as you let it sit after you add the sour creme and cheese it thickens perfectly. My husband LOVED it! This is going to become a regular for us.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated. It was VERY spicy. If I ever make this again I will cut the cayenne pepper down a little. My mouth was on fire. I added chicken and a vegetable for a complete meal. The sauce was thin and didn't look very good. It was very flavorful though.


*After reading the reveiews I knew that this was going to be too spicy for my children. I didn't want to have to make something else for them. Since I was already cooking the fettucine I decided to just put alfredo sauce on the kids' pasta (and they also had the chicken and vegetable).

This is tasty, and incredibly easy!  I added mushrooms and pre-cooked grilled chicken to ours, and used the full amount of cayenne - spicy, yes, but it didn't make my eyes water.  I also used the full amount of chicken broth; I don't think this recipe is intended to coat each piece of pasta like an alfredo would - the flavor still comes through - but I agree that it could have been a little thicker.  We'll have this again!  EDIT:  If you feel the sauce is too thin, pull your pasta a bit early, add it to the sauce, and let it finish cooking in the sauce.  The pasta will absorb some of the sauce, so you'll lose the liquid but not the flavor.

Was great. I added shrimp and used the water that I boiled them in instead of the chicken broth. Only because I didn't have chicken broth. I loved it and so did the Boys. I didn't have a problem with it losing its flavor after reheating.

Excellent pasta dish!  Very tasty and creamy!  Other than the fact that I doubled the amount of Parmesan cheese, I followed the instructions as is and it turned out great.  May I suggest the addition of 1 cup of sun-dried tomatoes for a serving to 4 people when you the Parmesan cheese at the very end.

This is a great simple recipe.  The spice gives it a nice subtle kick that pulls it off.  I would definitely recommend adding in some grilled chicken.

Delicious! Very tasty for such an easy recipe. I added sweet onion and a splash of white wine to the sauce, and topped off with crumbled bacon and a little more parmesan cheese.  Served with warm Rosemary bread. Will be a regular in our home.  Thanks.

Great! I put in the broth without the sour cream (that I put in at the end) and simmered 5 minutes like the recipe says. But after that, I put in the blender for just 2 seconds.  Then put it back into the pan, added half the sour cream and only 1/2 cup cheese... stirred then on the table.  Blending the sauce into chunks (not pured) gave a better texture and looked much better then if it wasn't.  Gets a 5 star since my whole family loved it AND I would serve it at a dinner party.  Oh yeah, I put in 2 tomatoes as well.  UPDATE:  My husband has just informed me he doesn't like the skins on the sweet pepper even if it is blended...

This is a tasty new way to serve pasta.  I found it a tad too hot though.  Next time, I'll use 1/2 t. cayenne instead of the 3/4 t.  Also, I'll definitely try adding grilled chicken. But, there definitely will be a next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

My dish turned out pretty good. I did make a few changes. Instead of cloves of garlic, I used chicken broth with garlic. Also, I added some garlic salt and 3 pieces of baked chicken breasts, chopped. For more moisture, mix some of the chicken broth with half and half like someone suggested. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!!  As other reviewers suggested, I added an onion and chicken breast to the pepper mixture sautee.  I also cut back on the chicken broth a bit.  If you love spicey, DON'T cut back on the cayenne pepper--it makes the dish!  

As for the leftovers not being as good, I can't speak to that, we ate it ALL!!!

Thanks for a great recipe!!

Loved this recipe - I changed it a bit, I used 1 sm jar of red peppers and after sauteeing, I pureed them and then cooked 1 real red pepper and added back the puree.  I did about 1/2 cup of broth based on suggestions and it was fine, 3/4 would have been fine too long as you let it reduce down.  I only "sprinkled" cayenee and it had enough of a kick for both my husband and I, I couldn't imagine using the amount indicated.  Was great, will so make again!

My boyfriend says this is one of the best new things I've made. We both really enjoyed it but I agree that if you're not a real spice lover, cut back on the cayenne. I made as directed but I did add chicken which I agree made it perfect. I lightly floured & fried chicken chunks & then added the sauce to it. I also used plain spaghetti & it was still very good.

This was fantastic!!!  I only used 1/4 t of cayenne - because while I love the spice - my husband likes it milder.  It still had some kick with 1/4 t.  I also took heed of people's comments about less broth and only added 1/2 c.  Finally, I sauteed some scallops and served on top of the pasta.  Perfect!

I added 1/2 a slivered red onion when I sauteed the  peppers, and then some chopped precooked chicken breast, and 1/4 pint of halved grape tomatoes.  When it was finished I added about a teaspoon of pesto, and served it over roasted garlic fetuccine.  Mmm..... delicious!  I didn't add quite as much cayenne because my little boys were eating dinner with us, but they too loved it.  Easy and delicious!

I also reduced the Cayenne to 1/4 tsp. and it was perfect.
I loved this recipe!

I added a bit of chicken for some protein. The recipe was nice but not spectacular.

We changed this a bit by using penne pasta and adding chicken. While eating the leftovers my husband added bacon bits and said it was even better then the first time.

SO GOOD!  I rarely make recipes twice as I enjoy a lot of variety, but I've made this one twice in two months.  The sauce is rich & creamy without being fatty, and it is just spicy enough for me.  I use fat-free sour cream instead of low fat & thickened it up w/ a little cornstarch.

Perfect recipe for anyone who works out a lot and needs those carbs. Also very healthy. I used the colored rotini since that's all I had around the house. I also used red and green peppers since that was in the fridge. It was very colorful and satisfied my appetite for spices as well with the cayenne pepper. And it was creamy without being too rich. Excellent.

Very quick and easy.  Wasn't sure if the cayenne pepper was supposed to be an actual chopped up pepper or cayenne powder.  Used powder and it was way too hot.  We still ate it, of course, because the flavor was excellent.  Will definitely make again, just with less cayenne.

My secret ingredient to sub out from cayenne is jarred/pickled jalapenos.....a couple of slices diced and a bit of the liquid adds heat/flavor but it's not as 'bang' as cayenne. 

Definitely add the chicken for a complete dinner.

I did follow some of the advice of others, I added 1 1/2 onion (chopped)  with the peppers garlic and cayenne. I increased the cayenne to 1 teaspoon. Once those had sweated down, I cooked 1 full kielbasa (diced)  with the veggies and added 2 cooked shredded chicken breast that I had handy. I then poured in 1 full cup of chicken broth and a block of softened cream cheese along with 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of  fresh shaved Parmesan cheese. I then added my noodles and stirred well. Pulled from the heat and added sour cream, stir and let sit to thicken. I'm sure the calories are outrageous, but the taste was amazing! Not to toot my own horn. :)  P.S. I have 4 children still at home so I always cook enough for an army. Hence, why I added so much stuff to it.

I didn't have low-fat sour cream so I used regular, but for whatever reason, it didn't dissolve completely even after I added the parmesan. Also, even though I love spicy food, I found this one WAY too hot. This dish just didn't do it for us and I won't be trying it again.

Used 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/2 cup broth, onion and fat free sour cream. The consistency of the sauce was perfect. Found it a bit too spicy and otherwise boring. It would be ok as a side dish but doesn't hold its own as a pasta meal.

This is good stuff.   I think a person should probably add some hot broth to the sour cream gradually before putting the cream into the hot pan though.  My cream started to curdle before I remembered that little trick.

Easy & has flavor. It was spicy from the cayenne pepper, but when added to the fettuccine & the cream sauce all together it wasn't to bad. For personal preference I'll either leave amount as is or reduce a little depending on what we're having with this. Very similar to another red pepper sauce I have from this website.

This recipe was pretty good although I modified it quite a bit. I added steak (cubed), mushrooms and onions. I used yellow and orange peppers instead of red. I added another 1/2 cup of parmesan. We love cheese in our house. I also added some chili powder. It was still a little bland for our tastes but it was delicious.

This is delicious. I agree with another reviewer, reduce the broth and cheese before adding sour cream.  This could be a wonderful main dish by adding a light protein. Thank you

A word of warning, this recipe as written makes a LOT of product, so if you’re cooking for 2, and using this as a side, you will want to cut down to half scale. Otherwise, you’ll be eating leftover fettuccine for a few days.
I saw the overage coming fortunately and cut the recipe in half... except for the cayenne. That was an accident, and since I like spicy, it didn’t bother me but it was a tad warm for my girlfriend (not so much that it stopped her eating it though!) and if you are feeding someone with a lower heat tolerance, you probably don’t want to make that mistake.

As a side dish, this was the perfect foil for a sweet-ish entree like this salmon recipe
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/166624/tomato-basil-salmon/
And it has the advantage of being quick, simple and mostly composed of things we would be likely  to have on hand (the bell pepper being the exception, since we tend to buy produce as needed). This is a definite keeper (in fact we’ll probably be doing it again tonight to use up the remainder of the bell pepper).

I have made this twice.  The first time just as it appears.  Yesterday I used diced roasted red peppers and added peas and chunks of grilled rosemary chicken breast.  Very tasty.  The comment about adding the sour cream last was very helpful. I removed my pan from the heat stirred it in at the end.  Great consistency.

I added onion and garlic and rotisserie chicken cut into pieces. It needs a thickner as the sauce is too liquid for my taste. Next time I'll reduce liquid and add a tsp. of corn starch or flour mixed with sauce and added to the pot.

Pretty good, but probably too many red peppers. Slice them really thin and maybe only one pepper instead of two.

I made this and served it with garlic bread on the side.  I had to reduce the amount of cayenne pepper since, one of my residents cannot handle spicy foods.  Everyone else including the picky ones in the house, my son and husband loved it.

This was just OK for me.  I added the sour cream after removing from heat and just before adding pasta to the skillet.  Also, parmesan just never melts for me.  Also, I think I'll try with some other noodle shape next time.  And I'll dice the peppers. I did love the cayenne pepper and the sweet red peppers!

Oh my, this was ridiculously good!  I can't believe I waited so long to make it!  It was a great side dish that wasn't too heavy but was full of flavor.  It would compliment chicken, pork, or steak as a nice premium side or its great all by itself.  I pretty much went exactly by the recipe except added an extra clove or two of garlic, sauteed a little chopped onion with the peppers, and added about a tsp. of dried basil.  I halved the recipe and it made plenty for the two of us as a side dish.  I served this with the Pork Chops Italiano recipe here on Allrecipes and they paired so well together.  I can't wait to make this to go with chicken as well!  It was so yummy and best of all super easy!  I have had this recipe saved for so many years and so glad I finally made it!  Excellent!  Thank you for the recipe!  UPDATE: I made this as a main dish and added in shrimp!  YUM!  It was delish!  I added in the additions as before along with some parsley and more freshly grated parmesan on top, along with crushed chile flakes this time instead of the cayenne since I was out.  I think it would also be great to use half white wine in place of the chicken broth.  Can't wait to try it with chicken!

I would definitely make this again, but if I'm making it for my boyfriends family again (his parents aren't big on spicy)...I would probably cut the amount of  Cayanne pepper in half. It was definitely delicious! Along with the garlic and bell peppers, I also sautéed some red onion for a little extra flavor!

Enjoyed by everyone in my family. I served it over gluten-free lentil penne pasta. I had fresh jalapeños that I used instead of cayenne. I think I could have still added the cayenne to bring up the heat—we like spicy food. I also replaced the sour cream with plain greek yogurt. Because I used yogurt I did have some curdling. I think I would add that at the same step with the parmesan next time.

Easy. Fast. Cheap.

This is a favorite in our house. When we have a week that we want to save money on groceries this is a go to meal. It can be spicy for the little kids so I have been adding less cayenne pepper than I would if it was just my husband and me. I have made this for a few years every few months.

Delish. Seriously, so easy and so delicious. Tastes delicious and not runny at all if you simmer long enough and add the right portion of chicken broth and sour cream.  Too much chicken broth or not simmering long enough will be runny. You simmer to evaporate some of the liquid. Will make over and over. A new permanant is our regular menu.

Delicious!  Wonderful and easy!  I made extra sauce (since I love a saucy pasta) and added whipping cream, spinach & shrimp, and some black pepper.  OMG it was amazing.  Highly recommend!  I also watched my liquids (that's something I always do though)... so for me, the sauce was thick and luxurious.  Definitely staying on the roster!

Wonderful and easy!  On hand pantry items in my house.  I added half an onion, doubled the garlic and used only 1/2 t. of the cayenne pepper.  I also served seasoned baked chicken breast and garnished w/basil leaves and shredded fresh parmesan cheese.  Total time 35 minutes.  It was so delicious that my family thought I scored a secret recipe from the Olive Garden.  I will definitely serve this again.

My husband said this is a keeper.  I was looking for something to make for dinner, uto using ingredients I already had.  Since I only had one red pepper, I added chopped sweet onions, fresh spinach and some fresh basil.  I also had a package of precooked chicken breast from Fresh and Easy that I added for heartiness. I was worried about the consistency of the sauce, but it wasn't a problem.  The little kick from the cayenne was just right. Next time I may add some toasted pine nuts on top.

Delicious and fairly light, so a keeper for sure.  Even though the instructions missed when to add the Parmesan, I added it along with the light sour cream after reducing the broth. I added mushrooms in the saute.  Next time, I'll reduce the cayenne to 1/2 tsp as it was a wee bit overpowering and will definitely saute onion with the peppers. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the suggestions of a previous reviewer and added fresh mushrooms, cut-up grape tomatoes, and fresh spinach. Also substituted Greek yogurt for low-fat sour cream because that's what I had.  This recipe was a great hit. Highly recommend.

We make this recipe with slices of our favourite sausage added! I will also add whatever veggies I have going: asparagus, mushrooms, zuchinni, etc. Love this recipe and we also will change up the pasta to ravioli, tortellini, and other short pastas. delicious!

I tried this recipe and it was very good. The only objection I had was to limit the cayenne pepper.

This was great! As other reviewers suggested, I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 teaspoon (it still had a large kick!) and the chicken broth was cut down to 1/2 cup. I also added some onion with the bell pepper and garlic and I only used one bell pepper.

Good but spicy! I added sweet Italian chicken sausage which complimented nicely. I followed everything as is except added the sour cream after the broth simmered as others suggested and that worked great. It was too spicy for me with 3/4 tsp of cayenne...I'll make again but use less pepper!

This was wonderful. I wasn't sure about the sour cream, but it turned out creamy and yummy...even when reheated the next day. We added the sour cream at the very end, letting the broth mixture cook down before adding. This takes much longer than the recipe states. We let our sauce cook down for 10+ minutes before adding to the noodles. 

I added pan seared chicken. It was good, but I will not add chicken in the future. The dish is good enough with no meat!

This is a keeper! I only gave it 4 stars because, like others, I found the sauce too thin. I ended up adding about 3 oz. of Neufchatel. The only other change I made was to add some chopped shallot to the red peppers in the pan. Also, to save time, I chopped up a jar of roasted red peppers (in water)in place of the fresh red peppers since they are pretty expensive and iffy to find in the winter here in the Northeast USA.

Very good! Hubby said it was a keeper. It was spicy which we liked, but if you don't you may want to use less cayenne.

Super easy, cheap and delish!  I halved the recipe since it was just myself and my husband. On accident, I used the same amount of cayenne, so it was spicy! I used less broth and added white wine. The key to thicken the sauce is to simmer.  Once it reduced by half, I added the sour cream and YES you can cook sour cream. I added shrimp to have a protein. This was so delish. I would serve to guest with a salad and crusty bread.

I usually always read the reviews but this time I didn't and went for the full load of cayenne pepper as the recipe called. I nearly died, but kept eating it since I did love the flavour, but it was way too much. I'll probably cut it off by more than a half next time - other than that slight mishap, it was delicious. I added mushrooms and it made it really yummy.

LOVE it! I added extra Cayenne because I love spice, and I cooked some chicken and added it right before the sour cream and chicken broth. This would be great with shrimp or crawfish as well. toss the cheese last after the pasta and the sauce will thicken a bit.

I would actually give this recipe five stars with the adjustments I've made over several times making it.  I definitely don't use the full amount of cayenne, and I add 1/2 an onion.  I like to add fresh parsley and don't always use the same amount of vegetable broth (I'm vegetarian).  I've always used fat free sour cream, which I add at the end, after it's off the heat.  I also tend to cut back the amount of parmesean.  I will sometimes add some Field Roast vegetarian chicken apple sausage or vegetarian chicken strips.  With these adjustments, it's a favorite, quick, relatively healthy recipe in our house!

Just came back from Italy and wanted to duplicate some of the food we had there.  This came very close!  I used less red pepper, added sausage and substituded greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Big hit with the family and very easy to make!!!  I will be making this again!

This was very good. I used linguine, and added shrimp to the pepper saute. Added the sour cream after removing the pan from heat, as others suggested. Tossed fresh basil and parsley with the pasta. A nice change from typical marinara sauce.

Changed quite a bit here. Used oil and butter to sauté the peppers and added onions which are just indispensible.  You can't really sauté without oil of some kind and there's no reason to dispense with olive oil at the very least. I did find that the sour cream melted down to liquid that made the pasta too runny even though I turned off the induction burner before adding it -- which is as good as removing the pan from the heat.  I remedied this by adding a lot more parmesan cheese -- which made the dish taste better anyway.  I served this Sicilian sausage. I'll likely make this again but I might use other veggies and make it like a primavera.

Loved it! Only a couple changes: Only put in 1/4 t cayenne. I used an onion instead of the bell pepper because that's all I had. I can't wait to add bell pepper next time, but I'm keeping the onion! Also, the sauce seemed really thin, so I dissolved 1 T flour in a little bit of water and whisked it in. Perfect! I am adding it to my recipe collection right now!

I made this recipe and it was delicious. I did not have red peppers so I used banana peppers instead. I used 3/4 tsp of cajun seasoning in place of the cayenne pepper and used only a dash of cayenne pepper. I also only used 1 tsp of minced garlic to suit my personal preferenced, but boy was this delicious! I will be making it again and my picky boyfriend loved it!!

Made this for dinner tonight and I really enjoyed it!  I did make adjustments based on what I had (and what needed to be used up in the fridge).  A nice take on pasta & sauce that lends itself to endless variations--this is a keeper!

came out a bit spicier then I expected. I'd cut back on the cayenne pepper next time to 1/2 a tsp

This was a great starting point recipe. I added shrimp and spinach to make it more of a complete meal. To make it a bit healthier and to my taste I also: used roasted red peppers in place of fresh, fat free Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, used only 6 oz of wheat pasta and decreased the cayenne to 1/4 a tsp and the parmesan to 1/4 cup with a bit more sprinkled on each plate. It turned out fantastic! It had the benefit of having lots of protein and being very filling.

I was looking for something quick and this recipe came up under 'dinner in an instant' - the 15 minute category so I decided to try it.  For what it is, it's a fine little recipe.  Once I got started I realized I didn't have peppers or linguine, so ended up using mushrooms and mafalda instead.  Because of the mushrooms I used beef stock instead of chicken stock.  As I tasted the sauce I did find it to be pretty runny and a also a bit too sour for our tastes.  I simply added in about a quarter cup of cream before adding in the shredded parm and the consistency was perfect after that.  It makes a quick and easy side that could be tweaked in any number of ways to suit individual taste and pantry items.

I recently started to cook more often.  My whole family usually are very hesitant when they try the food I make, but this recipe is really good!  My sister complimented it saying it's very creamy and has a great taste!  So thank you to whoever that submitted this recipe.  Continue to cook more! :D

Easy and delicious.  Better as time passes.  One night as a side to fish, then mix in poached chicken the next 2 nights.  It makes a ton and can serve 2 people for 3 nights, easy.

I thought this was really really great and very simple. I ended up pureeing some of the red peppers into the sauce to infuse the flavors. Scrumptious!

I really enjoyed this. I did have to change the recipe a bit. I used roasted jarred red bell peppers since it is what I had on hand. I also added a bit of cream cheese and basil. My guys didn't really like it but I'll make it for lunches for myself. Thanks!

LOVE this! This has become a beloved stand by at my house. The change I made was to use roasted red peppers, makes this recipe even better. Also like may others, lessened the amount of cayenne pepper.

AWESOME DISH!!!!  For those of you who commented on the sauce being runny... yes, that is true.  But we just added a tad more sour cream and a little more cheese and that fixed that problem.  For those who commented on the cheese or sour cream curdling... that is the nature of parmesan cheese.  Parmesan cheese is a cheese that does not get creamy, so that's that.  The sour cream curdling?  well that's a user error, maybe your heat wasn't up high enough, we did not find this to be a problem.  I did make one small change, we added a little more cayenne, but we LOVE spicy... add less if you don't like spicy, this is a spicy dish.  The flavor was perfect.  We only used one bell pepper, one was plenty for us.  And we like our pepper less crunchy, so we sauteed the pepper a little longer with some olive oil.  I added the cheese to the pan sauce and let it get melty in the pan, it blended well and it made the sauce thicker.  This is a very easy and delicious dish!  We added grilled chicken hot off the grill... mouth watering and much more filling with the added chicken!  I cannot wait to make this again!!!  i'm ready for our leftovers ;)

Well, this sounded delicious.......but was dissapointing. I tried it twice, and both times the Greek yoghurt I used in place of sour cream curdled. I substitute this regularly with great results, however this time for this recipe it failed, horribly.

I didn't have red peppers so I made this with some jarred sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. My husband and I really liked the flavors, but the cheap grated Parmesan cheese I used made the sauce gritty, a little too salty, and not creamy. I think if I make this again I will definitely use real Parmesan but half it and make up the rest with Mozzarella or another cheese.

I wanted to cook this because I love pasta, and was excited to go to the store to pick up ingredients that I didn't have on hand. I found this to be to spicy and it wasn't creamy. So, I will not be cooking this again.

I liked it but thought using fettucini made it heavy.  My family didn't care for it but more because it didn't have meat in it and it had a strong pepper taste which they're not really a fan of.

The sour cream worked great to make a delicous sauce that seemed much unhealthy.  Added the sour cream at the very end so the sauce didn't break.

My husband and I were both disappointed - it smelled delicious while cooking, but came out very bland. I took many of the suggestions below - added chopped onions to the saute mix, didn't stir in the sour cream until right at the end, added cooked chicken, etc. - not bad, but not a favorite. We ended up adding more cayenne, salt and pepper as we ate, and that helped.

Very tasty.  I added a chopped chipotle pepper to kick it up a notch.  Easy to cook & tasty.  It seemed a little runny so I cooked it longer than specified.  It thickened up when it cooled.

amazing! i first tried this recipe early this year...i love cream sauces and consistently come back to this one. so easy and so tasty. i used low-fat sour cream once though and it totally curdled. i still ate because it tasted the same, but of course the appearance was slightly off-putting...so i just stick to regular sour cream now. great recipe!! and lots of room to add in your own

It was alright, but didn't have as much flavour as I hoped.  The flavour seemed to get stronger as it cooled down, so it might taste better as leftovers.

This was an amazing dish and a definite keeper! I modified it slightly based on previous reviews and suggestions. I cut up slices of chicken breasts and cooked them in a pan with EVOO, and then I sprinkled cajun spice, chili powder, and crushed red pepper to lightly cover the chicken. I flipped the pieces of chicken and repeated the process and let it cook in all the juices for about 10-15 minutes. It turned out to be a wonderful addition! I added a little more spice to this recipe than it calls for, but if you're not one for spicy foods, then use it to your taste or eliminate it all together.

I knew I'd like this recipe, but it was even better than I thought it would be.  I too added some chicken it to, but this is definitely something I will make again.

Delicious! We are not big red pepper fans (unless we are having fajitas) so I used zucchini instead. Followed the recipe exactly as written.

YUMMMMMM!  I skimmed over some other reviews to get an idea of how to tweak this and it came out almost perfectly.  I added fresh, diced tomatoes to the saute, along with basil and oregano, minced a little extra garlic and waited until the end to add the cayenne, which I cut down to 1/2 TSP and which was still too spicy for me (and I like spice!).  I also used vegetable broth (I'm vegetarian) and cut it down to 1/2 cup.  It was totally amazing.  Kudos to the creator for throwing together such a solid foundation of ingredients.

This was a very tasty dish. A bit too spicy though. I would recommend a fourth of a tsp. of cayeene pepper. As for the broth, be carefull with the measurement. I started with only a half of a cup and went from there. It turned out perfect! I ate some for lunch the next day too. Will definetly make it again. Yumm!

Goes against my thinking once again.   Sometimes simple is better!  This is a quick and easy recipe that tastes like it was labor intensive.  I followed the recipe for the most part but used regular sour cream not low fat and a little extra garlic.  Its easy,  and flavorful.  This recipe could stand alone as a meal, or be used as a base to add some extra items to.  So the next run I added a few extras.  I added cut up blackened grilled chicken, and mushrooms, and a little white wine.  The chicken made it much more filling but the mushrooms were hardly noticable.  Will continue to make this since the family enjoys it but change up my additions according to what we are in the mood for.  The next time I am planning on using the recipe as a base again but mix in sauted shrimp with sauted minced bacon, and tossing in some shredded spinach in the end.

I made this with penne & LOVE the flavor - my 21month old loved it, as did my husband, who added grilled chicken to it.  I, too, wasn't prepared for the watery consistency of the sauce, but it still tasted awesome (and thickened up after a while).  I'll consider some of the suggestions for thickening next time.  Thanks for an easy, yummy recipe!

Made according to the recipe, it was a bit watery and very mild in flavor. OK as change from a tomato based sauce. nothing to write home about.

My husband and I love this recipe. This time when I made it I added Cooked Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. I used some of the liquid from the Sun-Dried Tomatoes to cook the Chicken. I doubled the sour cream to help with the consistency. We love spicy food so I doubled the amount of Cayenne Pepper. It was AMAZING!

Taste was okay, but if you use whole wheat pasta it looks unappealing.  Presentation is part of eating.  Will not make again.

This recipe was simply excellent.  My entire family loved it, including all 3 kids.  There were no left-overs, and the kids asked I make it again ASAP.

Yes, the sauce is a bit runny, as some reviewers mention, but we liked that-it was like a restaurant sauce, that isn't too thick or creamy.

I made it with broccoli, as I had no red peppers, and it was divine.  Looking forward to making it with peppers next time!

Thanks for sharing it!!!  It will become a regular at our house.

Terrific recipe. I enjoy spice but I did find that ¾ teaspoon of cayenne  (my was fresh and probably very potent) was too much.
ùVery, very tasty though

This is so easy and tastes good. Ok for the family, but not for a dinner party. Someone reviewed it as having no flavor, but it was plenty spicy. I added 1/2 small can of diced tomatoes and some of the juice and cut the chicken broth to 1/2 cup. Little extra cheese (love it) and it was delish!

I made this for dinner substituting vermicelli for the Fettuccine, and using orange peppers and fat free sour cream.  My son (6 yrs old) and I love it!  He loved it so much he got up to dance and say he wants it for dinner every Tuesday.

Really liked this dish!  However, I typically read reviews first and this time I was in a rush, whoops!  Definitely a bit thin, but even so, it was great, not overwhelmingly spicy!

Good.  Not enough sauce though.  Burnt the  out of my sinuses when i threw the cayanne pepper in the pan.  Definitely not a meal.  Will try with some chicken & more sauce next time.

Awesome recipe!  I loved cook fettuccine alfredo a different way, this seems easier, faster, and healthier (for what it is).  I love the heat, my husband doesn't so much so I did less cayenne and he loved it as well!  We threw some grilled chicken in the mix too

Super fast and easy and my boys and Husband loved it! My oldest son is 4 and extremely picky and he even loved it! I did not add as much cayenne as it said because I do not want it as spicy for the boys. Can not wait to make it again and add chicken!

This was pretty tasty! I'm not sure I quite julienned my peppers since I'm not a pro, but I did have fairly thin strips of peppers. I used 1 red and 1 orange since I had them on hand. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion of not adding the sour cream until the very end and it was nice and creamy! I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne since my SO can't handle the fire, but it was still very yummy! Next time I will add some tomato and onion for a little extra flavor.

My boyfriend is a picky eater and he loved this. I added grilled chicken for some protein. This one went into the recipe box. Also, I needed all ingredients other than the bell pepper and parm cheese and my bill at the store was under 8 dollars (including chicken). Super quick also!

I made this exactly as the recipe indicated and it was a bit too spicy and way to liquidy to cover the pasta nicely.  The flavor wasn't good enough for me to try making it again with the revisions that it would take to make it taste okay, so I won't be trying this again.  Glad that it worked for others.

If this is 4 servings, then they must be for VERY hungry people!! Made this last night, even weighed out the pasta to make sure I only used 12oz dry  pasta, and this was much more like 6 or 7 servings.  I did add about 3/4lb of chicken, which I precooked and then just added at the end when I mixed the pasta and sauce.  Also used only about 1/2cup of broth and consistancy was fine.  Added a bit more cayenne at the end,wasnt spicy enough for our taste.  Overall, very good, its a keeper!

We really liked this. I made a spicy breaded chicken to go over the top...did add a little cream cheese in place of some of the sour cream. Added chicken broth as needed & used about 1/4 of the pasta called for. There still was not a lot of sauce. I can't imagine if I used all the pasta the recipe called for.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe, but I added a few more cloves of garlic, a sweet onion, 3 or 4 ounces of cream cheese, chicken, and I used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne. As the sauce was cooking, I would add more water and sprinkle bouillon if needed. Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely love this.  It's got quite a kick, so ease up on the cayenne if you don't like too much heat.

Very good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it could be a little saucier. I added some cooked chicken to it, although it would have been just as good without it.  Hubby ate 3 bowls, and my 11 yr old daughter ate 2 bowls!! So, it was definitely a hit in our house.  Plus, it was super easy!! Also, I practically pulverized the red pepper in the chopper instead of julienned so the child couldn't pick out the only vegetable in the recipe. Worked like a charm!

Kinda bland and too hot (although I could have easily cut back the amount of cayenne).  It could benefit from more vegetables.  I added mushrooms.  Onions would be a good addition also. I would also use only 1 bell pepper instead of two.

I was a bit apprehensive to make this because I thought it would be bland.  It wasn't as bland as I had expected, but it still needs more; of what I don't know.  I wouldn't make it again, but it wasn't horrible.

This is an amazingly easy and tasty recipe.  I added a small onion and sauteed it with the peppers, and following the advice of others, I reduced the broth to 1/2 cup.  I used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and found that to be just the right amount for a medium spiciness.  My family loved this!  I will make it again and again; it is that good, and that easy!

A little too spicy for me. Next time, I will use only 1/2 tsp cayanne pepper. Also, I followed the advice of others and used only 1/2 cup of chicken broth so the sauce wouldn't be too liquidy. It turned out too thick. I will stick to the recipe's measurements next time.

Yum! Super easy and delicious.
Be sure to start cooking the pasta before you begin making the sauce because the sauce takes no time. I added a bit of creole seasoning and Red Hot to my sauce and also added some sweet corn to the final product. Quick and cheap...A from me.

The cayenne pepper was too much.  it would have been tolerable but when it was first put in the pan my entire house seemed like it was pepper sprayed.  we were all coughing so much that my husband and i took our three week old upstairs for the night and considered leaving.  the meal would have been okay if we could breathe.
maybe add less cayenne and add at the same time as chicken broth?

Yummy.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and it was the perfect amount of spiciness with a little bit of kick, but not too hot.  Added chicken.

We loved this! This recipe is super easy and very tasty! I added onions  at the suggestion of some other reviewers. For the sauce, I added the sour cream to the pan and added the broth little by little until it reach a consistency that pleased me so it wasn't runny at all. I will definitely be making this again!

This was a really good recipe as is. I followed a suggestion of another reviewer and only put 1/2 cup of broth in the pasta but next time I'll put at least 3/4 cup.

Loved this recipe! However, I did use less cayenne pepper than the recipe called for. It still had a kick but was mild enough that I could eat it. (I don't like spicy food). Served with grilled chicken breasts. My husband loved it, too! We even ate every bite of the leftovers the next day for lunch.

We are a large family of 7.  We have 4 sons all teens!  Sometimes its tough finding a meal that satisfies their huge appetites, but this fit the bill!  It's affordable and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and it was just right. This will be a regular on our menu!

I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out really well. I used farfalle instead of fettuccine and like some others I added chicken, onions, and mushrooms. I also only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and it was spicy enough for me, but my husband added more after it was done. I used a little more than 1/2 cup of broth, but less than 3/4 because I hate when sauce is too runny. Anyway I was still worried that it was going to be runny, but once I added the parm it was fine.  Overall this was a good recipe, and pretty quick and easy. We're definitely going to have it again soon!

Excellent and easy. My family isn't for spicy, so I left out the Cayenne and added a few chopped dried tomatos. Big hit!

This was good for a quick meal, and I would make it again if I had sour cream in the fridge that I need to use up. I added some red onion, grape tomatoes and chicken. Instead of chicken broth, I used 1/2 cup water and 3 tsp of knorr chicken buillon. My 2 year old ate about 5 times as much as usual when I fed him this! Which surprised me considering the heat from the cayenne pepper!

Excellent flavor! I used closer to a teaspoon of cayenne and it was just right for the tastebuds in our house.  I did not have any issue with the final dish being too liquid-y.  I think next time I will add some chicken breast for a bit of protein.

Followed the directions but added basil, diced onions and grilled chicken.  It was still a little bland for me.  The Cayenne added heat but not a lot of flavor.  I didn't think it was too hot like many reviewers but I love spicy food.  I will make this again but I think I am going to play around with adding additional spices or a different cheese.  I don't know, something to add some more flavor besides hot.  TY for the recipe!  It is def going in rotation maybe just with a few changes.  FYI I was the only one that wasn't in love with this dish, everyone else in my family went back for seconds so still a winner

I knew my husband wouldn't be a fan of this if it was meatless, so I sauteed strips of chicken breast sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic/onion powder and served them on top.  I also cut up a very small onion into strips and cooked it with the peppers/garlic/cayenne.  I had to add more sour cream to the sauce and cook it longer so that it wasn't so runny.  I shouldn't have ignored the "salt and pepper to taste" because we did have to add it after it was served up.  We also thought this was good with shredded parmesan on top.  Overall, it was a good new thing that we both enjoyed.

I'm not brave enough to do 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper... changed that to a little sprinkle.  Very delicious and so fast.

This sounded good and it really was.  I did do a FEW alterations according to other reviewers.  Since my fettuccine comes in a 16 oz box I did all the pasta, but ended up not using quite all of it, but nearly.  I did 1 red bell pepper, but I think it would have been better with 2.  I decreased the cayenne to 1/2 tsp and added it after adding the broth since my 3 year old was eating with us and it still had a hint of spice but no enough where she made a comment.  I also added half a Portobella mushroom cap and some grilled chicken chopped - delish.  I increased the sour cream (reg, not reduced fat) to 1 1/3 C and the cheese to 1 C, leaving the broth the same since some reviews said it was runny.  It was the perfect consistency BUT I wish I just had made more of it since we like our pasta saucy, plus leftovers are better if it there is more sauce rather than just enough.  Husband (great chef and food snob) went back for seconds even though he's on a diet, which means it was too good to pass up.  Picky 3 year old cleaned her plate.  It was fast to make too!  This one is def. going on the dinner rotation list.

I have made this many times, sometimes adding sauteed chicken breast, sometimes adding more veggies, but my husband and I always love it! I often use the sour cream/chicken broth as an alternative to heavy cream sauces now, as I've found light and fat free sour cream to work just as well. Love it!!

This was delicious and easy to make! I took the advice of another review and added more garlic, onions, and grilled chicken which turned out great.  One thing I should have done was cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half! My husband and I love spicy food and always make our meals spicy, so I didn't take that advice from the other reviews thinking it wouldn't be that spicy, but it definitely was too spicy!  I would recommend cutting the amount of cayenne in half, then you will actually be able to finish your plate!

This was delicious. I used roasted red peppers (all I had on hand and the store was out of fresh red bells) and added chicken. Definitely going in the regular rotation!

This was excellent!  I read some other reviews and I added slightly less chicken broth than the recipe called for, just to keep the sauce from being too runny.  Also, I added diced chicken and diced onions.  I sauteed them with the bellpeppers and garlic in the beginning.    This is a very easy meal to prepare and it's fairly quick.  The most time consuming aspect is the chopping - once all the veggies (and chicken if you like) are chopped, the rest takes no time at all.  So far everyone who has eaten this has loved it...

This dish was alright. I followed the directions exactly and added chicken and onions. I felt that the cayenne and red pepper overpowered the entire dish and there wasn't much depth to it. I added some crumbled bacon to try to balance the sweetness of the red pepper which did help but still didn't quite do it for me. The idea was there, just needs a little tweaking.

Excellent meal. Very easy to cook even for a person who doesn't cook a lot! The sauce was a little runny so I added more cheese and it thickened up. Delicious!

This was super easy to make and it was good!  I added adobo pepper instead of cayenne and mexican cream instead of sour cream (less tang).  I would definitely make it again, but I might throw in a bit of cayenne for spice (since the cream takes it away) and no cheese (it just didn't add anything for me).

My boyfriend and son hate peppers but i love them so i put them in so that i could at least eat them. I barley got any ofter those two dug in they ate more then their share. I was scared of the heat so i only added a third the cayenne and i couldnt even taste it, i think if you put the cayenne in the pan before the peppers that might help it not to stick to the peppers.  AMAZING dish. this one is going into the must make again folder!

This recipe was excellent! I took the suggestions of some of the other reviews and used only 1/2 cup of broth. I used penne pasta instead of fettuccine and added 1 diced zucchini, sauteed onion and both chopped and roasted garlic. In addition I added a little more cayenne pepper for an extra bite. It was delicious....this has definitely been added to recipe book!

Excellent flavor!  Found this via the AR app for meals under 20 mins...and took my chances.  Glad I did.  Only changes I made was to add ground pork & mushhrooms while eliminating salt and using dried minced garlic.  I would also do as others have suggested and reduce amount broth.  Thanks for sharing!

Used about 1/2 tsp cayenne and is was perfect for us. I followed the suggestion for 1/2 c broth instead of 3/4 c, which worked well. I also substituted green bell peppers (WAY cheaper) and it came out great. Added chicken and it was very filling. Delicious - loved the kick.

This recipe saved my night, I was starving and had an odd assortment of ingredients in the refrigerator.  I ended up without the bell pepper and had to use macaroni noodles instead of the fettuccine, but the sauce was excellent.  It was very flavorful and so easy.  I will definitely try this recipe again, especially when I have all of the ingredients, but even without, five stars.

I can barely express how much I love this.  It is the perfect comfort food.  Definitely in my top four favorite recipes of all time on here, maybe even number one.

This was fantastic! My boyfriend is "traumatized" by the thought of spagetti (a dish I crave!) and this was perfect for both of us! I didn't have the broh or the parmesan but a buillion cube and a 1/2 cup of water fixed that part just fine. As for the cheese, I went without (mine was way past the 'use by' date) and it was still delicious! I also added onion and grilled chicken as others had suggested and it really gave it some oomph! Loved it!

Yum!!!! I really enjoyed this dinner! My husband made it for me as part of my mother's day dinner, and it was scrumptious! I threw in some of the green bean and mushroom medley (also from this site) and it just made a great dish even better. I think next time I make this (and it will be soon!) I'll add some shrimp.

Delicious! I added mushrooms and onions and served over multi-grain penne instead. I didn't have as much grated parmeson as it called for (about 1/2 that) but it was still very good. Served with a side of rotissiere chicken.

Quick, easy, tasty!  After draining the pasta (I like whole wheat penne), I transfer it back to the saucepan.  Once the sour cream and broth have simmered for 5 minutes, I pour that mixture over the pasta in the saucepan and THEN add the Parmesan.  I have never had problems with too much broth.  To reheat, because it tends to dry out in the microwave, I cover it with a damp paper towel while nuking.

We really liked this recipe but it was missing something. I think that the sauce is great but red peppers aren't a "main" part of a dish and it really needed a meat or more vegetables. Also I would cut down on the parmesean cheese to a half a cup because even after a good amount of time and mixing the cheese still didn't mix in thoroughly enough to keep it from being kind of grainy.

WOW!!! What a great recipe. My whole family just LOVES this. I only use half of the cayenne, because some members just can't take the heat, but don't let the name fool you. No one ever knew it had cayenne until I told them. I choose to use 1 each, red, orange, and yellow bell peppers. Gives a great look and the different tastes of each pepper really compliment each other. I also add grilled chicken strips for a really good and complete meal. Thanks for sharing.

I have been making this recipe for about 8 years.  I follow the recipe exactly and just add chicken with cajun seasoning.  I have also added mushrooms and/or zucchini from time to time.  One of my family's favorites.  Don't worry if the sauce looks a little thin at first - it thickens well when you add the Parmesan.

Yummy!  I used one red pepper and about a cup full of julienned carrots and it was really good, but next time I make this I think I'll add even more vegetables (julienned zucchini maybe?).  I also added a little dried basil which worked well.  The amount of cayenne pepper was just enough to give it a little kick, but if you like things really spicy you will need to add more.  I added the 3/4 cup of chicken broth but my sauce was not runny at all.  I actually had to add a little more liquid at the end because the 12oz of pasta absorbed the sauce very quickly.

Very good recipe.  This resembled my favorite dish at a local restaurant.  To get closer to the restaurant dish, I used 1 red pepper, 2 jalapenos and 1 carrot  (instead of 2 peppers), all finely julienned.  It was quite spicy, but the spice didn't "build", and it tasted perfect to me.

This was really tasty and spicy, but that's most likely because I added lots more cayenne pepper to the peppers than the recipe.  Even still, my husband said it could have been spicier.  I sauted the peppers probably more than the recipe calls for, since I like them softer.  Good stuff!

I like that this was quick and cheap to make, but it was lacking a little flavour.  The amount of cayenne was perfect for us, but it needed something else, maybe a little sweetness.

Even with the cayenne, it was still a bland recipe.  I prefer more flavor.  I knew it wouldn't be a thick sauce, but it was still much more watery than I expected.  I added shrimp to my recipe.

I LOVE this dish!  I added 1 Onion chopped, Parsley & Oregano.  It was SO flavorful, I am so glad I found this.  The other ingredients I followed exact and I had no Problem. Next time though, I will double the sauce recipe, I would highly recommend doing that with this recipe.  YUMMY

This has become one of our 'standard' dinners during the week...SO easy, fast and delicious.  The pasta actually takes longer to cook than it does to make the sauce so get the water boiling first thing.  We decrease the cayenne and now we add some cooked chicken.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

I thought this reccipe was great. I added onions to the sauce and a little cornstarch to thicken. I also added chicken which was great. I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used half sour cream and half cream cheese.

This is delicious and easy to make, and reheats as tasty as it was straight from the skillet. Like others I found it necessary to use less broth (but I used a stock cube to get the same amount of flavor with less water) and more sour cream to get the texture just right. I agree with other reviewers that it has the extra virtue of being very cheap; I got 4 meals out of one batch for under $20, and that includes adding ham (though chicken would've been better in retrospect). A lot of reward for very little effort!

This was quick and easy recipe for a week night or any busy day when you are in a jam to make something tasty and fast for supper. I used full fat sour cream  and 1/2 cup chicken broth but I could've used the full 3/4 cup since I had to reduce my sauce more then the 5min mentioned to get the proper thickness.I used riccia pasta which look like skinny lasagna noodles and used a yellow and red pepper with onions.It was delish!

This was awesome!  I added some chicken to it for some protein.  My husband and I both loved this. I brought some leftovers for lunch the next day and all of my coworkers demanded I give them the recipe. It is quick and easy to make. This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

I'm giving this a 5 star because it is so incredibly easy, and is so good. We love cayenne, red pepper and garlic in this house. It was perfect. I sauteed the peppers a little longer, and added a half of a chopped onion. I will be making this often.

This was pretty good, although I added chicken and sliced mushrooms and served with whole wheat penne pasta instead of fettuccine.

Yummy!  I never really measure anything, but I used everything this recipe calls for.  I did add some spinach & italian seasoning.  This was very good, I will make it again.  I did add the broth to the peppers and garlic and let it cook down before adding the spinach then the sour cream.  Thanks so much for the post!

This is a great dish. Very easy to prepare and similar to another dish on this website that calls for a sour cream sauce.  I added onions to the bell peppers, about two cups of chopped chicken, and some corn starch to the sour cream to make the sauce thicker.  Turned out great.

This pasta is delicious even without the parmesan cheese. I forgot to add it and didn't even realize it until much later b/c it tasted so good.

Very delicious and easy to make!  I like spicy food, so I actually put in more cayenne pepper than the recipe called for and it's great.  I also had one sad little uncooked chicken breast sitting in the fridge, so I cubed it and cooked it with the peppers.

This was very bland.  It was simply noodles in warm sour cream.  I wouldn't make this one again.

I read the previous reviews before making this but was in a rush and forgot to use less cayenne pepper.  WOW!!!!  (And not in a good way!). It was too hot to even eat!  My 9, 7, and 5 year olds wouldn't have any more than the required first bite - and, for once, I didn't question it!  Way too much heat as written!!!!!  (I even tried to dilute it with more chicken broth.  Irrepairably spicy!!

REALLY good but rather spicy.  I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and it still had a good kick.  But the flavor was fantastic!

really good! i actually had the opposite result from other reviewers -- too dry. also, this was my first try at using cayenne pepper EVER! and i think i added an extra dash that didn't have to be there. definitely will make this again, it's so easy!

Didn't follow the recipe but rather the idea. Used a can of chopped tomatoes in place of broth as I was trying to pack as much nutritious goodness as possible into the dish. Added a jar of mushrooms (drained) as well. Also used two spoonfuls of creme fraiche (available in Europe but not in the States as far as I know, is like sour cream but is smoother to cook with). Basically, the formula garlic+red pepper+cayenne+liquid and cream of any sort=really tasty. My boyfriend thought it was great, so we'll be using this idea again in the future. I look forward to a day when I'm out of chopped tomatoes, so I can try the recipe as written. Thanks for this.

Great recipe. I used fat-free sour cream for a healthier alternative, and it did not take away from the taste at all. Also added chicken breast, and like the other reviewers I used 1/2 cup chicken broth. I made this recipe for my kids eliminating the cayenne pepper and they loved it.

I followed the advice of others and cut down on the amount of broth that was used, and mine turned out too dry!  We like our pasta to have a bit more sauce.  Otherwise, this was GREAT!  I added some chopped onions with the bell peppers, along with oregano and basil.  I will definitely try this again, only using the given amount of broth.

I have made this recipe several times, but instead of the sour cream, the recipe I use calls for 1 cup whipping cream. (Obviously not as healthy, but it's delicious!)  Last weekend instead of the peas and red peppers, I added quartered marinated artichoke hearts, quartered fresh mushrooms, chicken breast cut into chunks, and roasted red pepper cut into strips from Trader Joe's.  It was fantastic!

I rough chopped my peppers into bite sized cubes and used penne...I think next time I'll dice the peppers, the penne is great, hold the sauce really well. The sauce is amazing, I added fresh ground black pepper and an all seasoning blend to the peppers (which I softened in olive oil)

This was so easy and very good. I only used about an 1/8 of a cup of cayenne and it was plenty hot enough for my husband. I have also added boneless skinless chicken breast. WONDERFUL!!

This is a pretty good recipe.  It was too spicy for my kids but my husband and I loved it.  My husband suggested that maybe adding some peas to it would be just enough to tone it down for the kids. Next time I'm going to try this. I also added some grilled chicken.

The whole family really liked this! We added chicken, sauted mushrooms and shrimp (very yummy!), plus a little sprinkle of oregano. I think the oregano definitely added something. Other than that, pretty much followed everything else to a tee. Tasted like something from a fancy restaurant. Definitely something we would serve to guests and will add to our menu rotation. Great with a green salad and bread. Next time may add a bit more cayenne pepper, but we like spicy at our house.

Very versatile and tasty dish! I think every recipe should have some reflection of the chef and I made a few changes to suit my tastes. 

1 lb. Grilled chicken breast
1 cup Chicken Broth
3/4 Tsp Chili powder (Instead of Cayenne)
1 Red Pepper
1 Green Bell Pepper

Cooked sauce to the instructions but made the substitutions above. When the sauce was just about ready, I placed the cooked Fettuccine into the (large) saute pan and tossed it on medium heat for a minute or two. Sliced the chicken breast and placed it on a bed of the pasta.

a solid choice for a quick meal. I REALLY did not want to cook and had nothing in mind. I glanced at the quick and easy recipes and saw I had most of the ingredients, I substituted a water with veggie boullion for the chicken broth and it worked very well. My son, who was bitterly complaining about eating a meatless meal said: "When did you learn to make things taste good without meat!" Thanks for the recipe: it is a good one to have in my back pocket.

Great recipe! I used just under 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and added it after I sauteed the peppers and garlic. I used 1.5 large red peppers, 1 cup light sour cream, 1/2 chicken stock and I added in some grilled chicken breast from last night. A wonderful meal. It still has a bit of bite with the slightly under 1/2 tsp added to the recipe. We had it with noodles and a garden salad, delicious! A keeper recipe for me and my family. Very easy and very tasty. We will make it again :o)

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. My husband, who is kitchen-challenged, made most of it with a little guidance from me - and it turned out perfectly! The sauce was not runny at all like some other reviewers commented, and we enjoyed the heat from the cayenne pepper. I will definitely make this again!

Really yummy! This is a surprising pasta that is rich in flavor and seems like it took all day to make. I added oregano and basil and some chicken. I also did the 1/2 tsp cayenne and it was just right. I added a little corn starch and warm water to thicken the sauce and it turned out just right for me. My husband would probably like it just as the recipe says because he likes his pasta with wet sauce. I will be making this again!

I followed the suggestions in the comments and did 1/2 cup broth and 1/2 tsp cayenne.  It was fantastic!  I would eat again!!!  I want to try it with onions next time.

This is a great recipe in every way a recipe can be great!  It was easy, quick, and tasted like something you would have to pay $12 a plate for at Olive Garden!  My husband couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

This was not a favorite of mine but everyone else in my family really enjoyed.  I used whole wheat fettuccine and doubled the sauce.  We did not think that the sauce was runny at all but then again I cooked on a low heat and added the cheese while it was simmering.  I also grilled some chicken and added it to the dish.

Delicious!  First off I used about a quarter of the Cayenne and it was still very spicy.  I reduced the chicken broth to 1/2 cup and the sauce was perfect.  Also a recommendation on the parmesan, I like to use shredded it melts better then grated.  I added it at the very end but for me the trick is to keep it over low heat and add a little at a time stirring continuously that way it will melt rather then clump.

I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and added basil - that was nice.  I also used lemon pepper and red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.  I did not care for the red pepper skins and the sauce seemed a little thin to me.  If I make this again I'll use roasted red pepper.

this was absolutely delicious - with the chicken broth, sour cream and parmesan cheese sauce, it was to die for. If you like cream sauces I would reccomend this recipe with a nice side salad and it's the perfect dinner!

I enjoyed this recipe and it was amazingly simple and quick to put together. I used bow tie pasta with red and yellow peppers, added some chicken strips, and used fat free sour cream. I took the advice of other members by waiting to add the sour cream and chicken broth at last minute. Sauce was flavorful and creamy. Thanks for the tip! I also did only use half the cayenne the recipe asked for and I found that plenty spicy for me. This re-heated great for lunches. Would make again.

I followed the instructions completely. And  found the sauce to runny. So we added some cheddar cheese, it turned it into more of a mac and cheese, but tasted better than the original.

This was great...  My whole family loved it!  I took the advice of some reviewers and only used 1/2 c. chicken broth and it was nice and creamy.  I used a little less than 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper and it was hot enough for us.

Super yum! The kids don't do super spicy so I did 1/4 tsp. each cayenne, chili powder and paprika. We added cooked chicken strips and it was a one dish meal. Made way more than 4 servings, more like 6.

I eat this on a regular basis.  I use fat free vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  The sweet yogurt goes well with the spicy cayenne.

This has been added to the rotation at my house! The only changes I made were to chop the peppers into medium-size pieces rather than julienne. That way you get more bites with pepper in them. Also added a little more cayenne pepper, as we like it spicy, and I usually end up using a good bit more cheese than called for. I also took another user's advice last time and added the sour cream at the last minute and used a little less chicken broth. This did seem to give the sauce a creamier taste and texture, so I'll do that from now on. Thanks for a great recipe!

We ate this last night with oven baked tilapia.  I used half the cayenne pepper called for and it was still plenty spicy.  Everyone, including the 2 1/2- year-old cleaned theier plates.  My husband suggested having it again with chicken.  Next time I will take the advice of others and add the sour cream at the last minute.

tried this twice now.  The cayenne taste is good with the bites with bell pepper.  But really the sour cream needs to be added at the last minute as another reviewer suggested, b/c I think the sauce was bland/flat by simmering with sc.  I had to add a few spoonfuls of cornstarch to thicken the sauce the second time I made it, and there was too much parmesan taste and richness the first time I made it.  So I reduced the amount the second time.

I should have listened to other reviewers.  This was waaaaay to hot for me to eat.  I'm still giving it four stars because the rest of my family liked it even though it was pretty spicy.  I probably would have liked it if my mouth wasn't on fire.  I'll try it again with much less cayenne next time.  I also added onions which everyone liked.

The taste rates 5-stars, but for the modifications to the recipe, as many reviewers have noted. In summary:
1. I added chicken. I marinaded chopped up boneless breasts in olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, and lemon pepper for ~30mins.
2. I doubled the amount of garlic, and added onions both to the red pepper/cayenne and to the chicken (prepared separately)
3. I also added half a carton of finely chopped button mushrooms
4. I used approx. 3tbsp of sour cream (all I had on hand), but used all of the chicken broth. The sauce's consistency and taste were subtle and flavorful.

Best of all, it's a pretty bachelor friendly meal.

I liked this recipe but my boyfriend didn't, so i gave it 4 stars. It was much spicier than i imagined, but still tasted good. We both like spice but he complained it was too spicy. I used the full amount of broth and let it cook down so it wasn't too thin. Since I liked it so much, I will try to revamp it to suit both our tastes next time. Will definitely make again!

This is a very quick and easy pasta dish to make.  I thought it tasted a little too much like sour cream but it was still very good.

I don't like red peppers. So, why did I try this recipe?  I don't know! But it was AMAZING! I cut the spice down to 1/2 teas. and only used 1 pepper. Will probably use a little less spice next time. Added walnuts, basil, and oregano. It was like a creamy red pepper pesto. We loved the creamy texture, with the bite of spice!  Thanks!

Great recipe!  My husband and I both like spicy so it was a good heat for us.  We added grilled chicken and it was a good dinner.  May try some additional veggies mixed in, maybe artichoke hearts, next time.  It is a thin sauce, but not too bad.

This was good. Very simple and tasty. I added chicken. The only problem is that it didn't look very appetizing--it was all pinkish and runny. But if you can get past the appearance, the taste is pretty good. I would make this again and maybe add something green (spinach?) to help with the color.

This dish was AMAZING.  I've made it twice now, once straight from the recipe and once  using onions in addition to peppers, and with penne instead of fettuccine.  The second attempt was definitely better.  I love that I can adjust the spiciness of the dish just by changing the amount of cayenne, which I can't do with restaurant pasta.

Easy and very good. I added minced jalepeno to give it even better flavor - and still not that spicy at all.

This was great!  I added diced chicken and used fat-free Breakstone sour cream, which worked perfectly.  It was a very nice change from the usual pasta sauces.

This was really good. Definately a nice change. Followed some suggestions and added chicken, a pinch of oregeno, basil, chopped onions    and cut down the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. This is a keeper!

A frequent request from my daughter, the picky eater. Like others, I cut down on cayenne pepper (1/2 of recommended) and add chicken.  Great recipe!

This was very good. I chopped the pepper and added some onion and lots of garlic to sautee first, as well as basil and some black pepper. I cut cayanne pepper in half, and we are a family who likes our spice. No midwest bland tastebuds here. But the cayanne does give it great flavor. I thought the sauce as is was smooth and tasty. Next time I will try it with chicken. Eveyone asked me to make it again.

This recipe is awesome!  I normally love spicy foods but found this amount of cayenne to be a bit overpowering.  My husband loved it but next time I'll cut the cayenne in half.  I did not have a problem with runniness or with the sour cream.  I added all ingredients to the sauce except the cheese, cooked over medium for a short bit and then removed from heat.  I added the cheese and let it sit to thicken, and it was perfect!!! Defintely try this one, my husband who is NOT a fan of white sauce actually liked this one.

Loved it! Hubby gave it a 9 out of 10! Instead of using 1 c of sour cream, I mixed sour cream 50/50 with light plain yogurt. I added chicken to mix too. Served over penne pasta. yum, yum!!! Also added a splash of hot sauce...hubby likes it hot!

Yum!  I followed the advice of mcs091004 and sauted chicken with the pepper.  Following all the other instructions, it turned out perfect (I let it sit for 10 minutes for the sauce to thicken more).  This recipe will be added to my collection!

Excellent sauce.  Followed recipe as writen.  However I did split in half before I added the sour cream and had the other half another day. I let the noodles sit in the sauce for a time and the flavor was awesome.  Next time I will add either chiken or shrimp.  Thank you

Nice change of pace, and simple because it requires so few ingredients. I love spicy, but have to admit that I sniffled a lot and will reduce the cayenne to "a dash or two" next time.  I also added chicken. Great recipe!

We just got done eating this dish.. it was pretty good. My husband liked it more than I did...all I could taste was the cayenne.  It definately needs some "goodies" added to it. I added red onions and some cajun seasoning. 5 stars on ease and simplicity though!

Absolutely delicious!  I've never written a review before but this recipe compelled me to.  I made the recipe as is the first time, with the exception of the addition of some shrimp.  I'm going to make it again this week, using small ziti instead of fettucine, and with the addition of some green peas along with the shrimp.  Wonderfully simple yet tasty, we both enjoyed this thoroughly.

I added shrimp and sweet onions to the mix. Sub the cayenne pepper for chili powder and some crushed red... still very effective. Quick and easy and very good!

Made this last night. I was just ok. Next time I will definitely add more spice,maybe cut up a jalapeno pepper. Also, I will add more vegetables, maybe some tomatoes, zucchini, and asparagus. It needs some help. A good, basic recipe, but play around with it to make it yours. The sauce was quickly absorbed by the pasta. I think more sauce is needed. I did use a whole wheat and flax seed pasta, so maybe that's the difference. I'd make again, but with some changes.

What a delicious dish...quick and easy, too.  I knew once I read the recipe, I was going to add grilled chicken.  For our taste, I did cut back to 1/2 ts. cayenne.  This is definately a "repeat recipe".  Thanks for sharing!!

I made this the other night and thought it was fantastic!  I added some chopped onion, a little nutmeg and cut the cayenne in half for my taste.  It was perfect!  Leftovers were just as good if not better the next day.  I will definately be making this one again!

We loved this recipe.  I added the chicken drenched in flour with salt and pepper. and a can of mushrooms.  Next time I'll use the full amt of cayenne pepper I only used 1/2 tsp. Maybe even a change of pasta.

My husband loved this dish because he loves spicy food. I liked it okay... I only used 1/2 tsp. of cayenne, and that was plenty for me--my mouth was hot. I added shrimp for a little something more, and re-heated the next day with a little chicken broth and half & half to re-create the creamy texture from the night before. For those of us who don't love the hot spice, I think this dish would be awesome with something in place of the cayenne. Not sure what that would be... italian seasoning, basil, rosemary, etc. but overall was a crowd pleaser, which makes me happy :)

The sauce has a very nice flavor, and it was so easy to make.  I also added some crushed red pepper.

Made it by adding onion / chicken / cajun instead of cayenne . . . like was posted earlier . . . was wonderful.  For us it was not spice at all, we would definitely add more of the seasoning next time.

I probably should have read the reviews first. This was REALLY spicy.  My husband liked it okay, but I was definitely sweating! Also, I forgot to add the cheese before mixing with the noodles, so we just put it on top.  The sauce was pretty runny, also.  I added some mushrooms with the peppers, so that could have been why.  Anyways, it was okay, but if I make it again I will definitely do some tweaking.

Ok, I love spicy food, and this was definitely spicy!  I recommend adding some grilled chicken (after cooking it separately), and possibly just a tad less cayenne pepper.  I was sweating!! Very good though.

This recipe was very flavorful and easy to make. Everyone at my office has tried it and loves it. If you add chicken or shrimp it's good too. I'll make it very often.
