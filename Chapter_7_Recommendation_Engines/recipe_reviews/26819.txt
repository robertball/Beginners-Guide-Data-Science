I've tried a few Spinach and Artichoke dips from this site and I've loved them all but this is BY FAR my favorite! It is just perfect, and delicious! I used Sour Cream instead of mayo and it was PERFECT!! YUM!!! I used 2 cloves of garlic, did without the basil. I also used Whipped Cream Cheese, it is so much easier to work with. I mixed the shredded cheese into the mixture, much better that way than on top! I thought it got yucky if you put it on top. A hard layer and impossible to dip in. I serve with tortilla chips and baguette. I even mix it all together the day before and put it in a pan in the fridge and then when I'm ready to bake it I throw it in the oven! I make this and bring it whenever I'm going to someone's house and EVERYONE loves it. I can't even tell you how many times I've been asked for this recipe, EVERY time I make it! LOVE IT!

This is another fabulous version of the spinach/artichoke dip.  However, I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise - much better! We use a bag of frozen spinach (rather than the boxes or fresh) and just squeeze it dry - the spinach quality is better.  You can really add a little of whatever you'd like, and it is ALL good! I added chives to add some more green to it. I also have added a few dashes of Frank's hot sauce (which does not overwhelm the other flavors - just enchances them!). You can toss in bacon bits, chopped garlic, chopped red peppers (not green - ew!), etc. Be sure to really chop up the spinach and artichokes - no big chunks for this dip please.  You could toss in regular onions too, but I think it is great without them.  It does take a little longer to bake with the sour cream - and I use a 9x13 glass pan, so you can see the edges getting golden!  I buttered the edges of the pan last tmie - OGM - the dip was gone in under two hours!  This is a keeper, and has been a request since we first made it . YUM!!!!  (We use Ritz crackers,but this is good on Ritz, tortilla chips - almost anything!)  If you have any left over, it is just as good warmed up in the microwave the next day.  (I think we've had leftovers ONCE!)  Rich, so you don't want to eat it all the time, but if you want a great dip - go for the best!  (No cartons of liquidly sour cream junk when this is so easy to make!)

LOVE IT! I used light cream cheese (16oz instead of just 8oz), jarred minced garlic instead of wasting my time mincing it myself and I used more spinach than called for to ensure this was actual spinach dip and not just a cream cheese dip (I posted a picture). I also mixed the mozzarella in with everything else instead of just putting it on the top. I paired this with the "Pita Chips" recipe on this site submitted by Dawn. The two are match made in heaven! I cannot speak highly enough about this recipe. Thanks a bunch!

This is the best Artichoke and Spinach Dip in the world! Once we discovered how great the recipe was, I made it two more times that week! My mother came over and we made double the amount and ate it with water crackers while drinking pina coladas and playing scrabble. We hardly played at all, though. We couldn't stop eating that dip! I think this is a fantastic recipe, but for our tastes I added a tsp. of cayenne pepper and a little more garlic. Wonderful dip!

I love artichokes and cheese, but hate spinach. I have to admit, I could not stop eating this dip. I made it for a New Year's party and thank goodness I doubled the recipe. I served it with parmesan-garlic toast rounds and Triscut crackers. It was a H-I-T. A bit on the expensive side, but well worth it when the compliments start pouring in. One hint: Mix most of the mozarella into the dip, and sprinkle just enough on the top to brown and present nicely. This makes the taste great, and when it cools you have no hard layer to fight with to get to the dip.

I fixed this as an appetizer for our Labor Day cookout and it was amazingly good. One of my teenagers, that hasn't eaten anything green in years, was actually eating the bread bowl when the dip was finished. I did take other reviewers advice and made a few changes: substitute sour cream for mayo, increase garlic to 3 cloves, mix mozzarella in before baking, and serve in a bread bowl. Everyone just raved about this dip and it disappeared quicK!

Wow.  Made this for my mother in law who loves this stuff.   She went for a second helping and that is unusual for her.  This is by far the best recipe I have found for this.  The only change I made was to use fresh mozzarella instead of shredded...melts creamier.  Thank you for the post.

Omigod this is FANTASTIC!  I've made it over 5 times, and every single time the serving bowl is wiped clean!  You'll need about 3 baguettes per recipe, sliced about 1" thick, if that's how you want to serve it.  I also normally make double batches since the package of frozen spinach at the store is enough for 2 recipes (I hate to waste it), and always add a little more of the cheese, spices, & garlic.  Also, if you use the artichoke hearts from Costco, they have an irresistable flavor and are marinated in olive oil & herbs (which helps enhance the flavor of the dip)--plus, you can steal pieces and still have enough in the jar for your recipe!  Just FYI, a double batch fits perfectly in a 9x9 pyrex dish, so you can just bake it, throw the plastic lid on & it's easy to transport to your next party!

this was soooooo good! i will not order artichoke & spinach dip in a restaurant when i can make this at home.  i followed the recipe except that i didn't have garlic salt---just garlic powder---and it turned out well.  i also added more mozarella---i like it extra cheesy.  great recipe...will definitely make this again :)

Awesome awesome awesome!!  Made this for my sister's bachlorette party and got great reviews!!  I actually flipped things around, and mixed the mozzerella in with the recipe, then sprinkled a little more parmesan on top for a little crunch.  Came out great, served it with sliced sourdough baguette and bagel chips.  Will totally make again!!

I know.. I know.. everyone complains when we modify recipes, but this one definitely deserved something more - but not much.  I put a large clove of garlic, and drained artichokes in a food processor and pulsed a few times to break up.  Then I added the drained spinach.  I removed the mix from the processor and set aside in a bowl and added the cream cheese, parmigianna reggiano and about 1/2 cup of the mozzerella.  I gave that a nice couple of pulses to mix and then threw the artichoke mix back in - this time with a short squeeze of a half lemon and some salt and pepper.  I left out the basil thinking it seemed odd to be in there.  I topped the dish with 1/2 cup finely shredded mozzerella and baked for 25 minutes at 375.  It was absolute heaven.. total perfection.  My guys and family ate it like there was no tomorrow.  This recipe is definitely the best I've ever had.  Thank you for sharing!!

This dip is AWESOME. I've made it a few times now, and it always gets rave reviews. It's creamy and flavorful and just really delicious. I only make a few changes - I, like a bunch of other people have said, use sour cream instead of mayo, and I use twice the amount of spinach and of garlic. I also stir mozzerella cheese right into the dip before baking, as well as sprinking it on top. I've served it with pita chips and with crackers, but I think it's best with tortilla chips. Thank you Tiffany for the great recipe! This is one of my favorite things to make for parties.

I took this to a Christmas party and it was a hit!  It was super easy to make and really delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and used whipped cream cheese, subbed sour cream for the mayo, & i just used bagged Italian shredded chese rather than buying the three different cheeses.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and omitted the garlic salt, and just used regular Kosher salt instead.  I will make this again and again!

AWESOME. whoever said to use sour cream instead of mayo that was a good call, def use sour cream instead. I doubled the recipe, left out basil, and used whole box of spinach & extra parm/mozz/garlic. It filled a 9x9 pan, and tastes just like dip from a restaurant. Def going to make this again

First time making a spinach artichoke dip and it was awesome! Brought as an appetizer to Thanksgiving and served with cubes of french bread I tossed in a touch of olive oil & seasonings plus triscuits and tortilla chips. Everyone raved about it, I doubled the recipe, and it still went too fast. I knew that it was a real winner when my roommate's grandmother asked for the recipe!

Taking the suggestion of other reviewers, I made a few changes. I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one, I added 1/3 cup diced onion, a few pinches of Cayenne and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also, I used half mayo and half sour cream, using a little more of these than the recipe called for. I sauteed spinach, garlic, and onion in olive oil first, then mixed in with everything else. I thought the mixture was a little too thick and wanted it to turn out really creamy, so before I transferred to the baking dish I stirred in some milk (maybe a 1/3 a cup).

This was a huge hit, I will make it again soon. Next time, I will probably increase the spinach a bit and add more whole milk hoping it turns out just a little less thick. Also I will be baking this in the dutch oven, or a bakeable crock pot dish. You definitely want to bake to brown the cheese on top, but I feel you need to keep it hot for serving too. If you are browsing for a great, hearty appetizer this is definitely worth a try!

I made this dish not even knowing what an artichoke was!!!  Took it to a get together with friends tonight and it went over great (I think my hubby ate the most!). Made a few alterations as follows:  used 1/4 cup sour cream and a 1/4 mayo.  Found an Italian blend of shredded cheeses at Safeway (Lucerne brand) which included mozza, parmesan, provolone and fontina and just used 3/4 cups of this and mixed/stirred it into the rest.  Baked it for about 1/2 when it started to bubble, took it out an sprinkled some more of the cheese blend on top and broiled for about 6/7 minutes until it got lightly browned.  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks so much!!!

This was fabulous!  I too went with the sour cream route.

And now I'm going to make it again!  Does anyone know if this recipe could be baked (as stated) and then put in a crock pot to keep it warm?  I need some way to keep it warm for hours!  I have a fondue pot too, if that would work better.

I made this and it was really quite good. I added a tiny bit less mayo and used fontina cheese instead the mozzarella  because I love the flavor and it's so creamy and melts so well. I also added  some chopped green chilies and squeezed half a lemon into the mixture. I blended all of the cheese into the dip because I was worried about a crust forming on the top. One more minor change- I stirred in a bit of sour cream because it seemed a bit thick. Thank you, we enjoyed it.

Terrific as is, but add 1/2 c. of sour cream, up the mozzarella to 1/2 c. (mixed in, not on top) and sub a full package of frozen spincah:  TO DIE FOR!  (Don't leave out the mayo - it really enhances the creaminess!)

Absolutely the most amazing, phenomenal spinach-artichoke dip on planet earth. I'm getting ready to make it for the Super Bowl because EVERY party we go to this is the #1 request. Like others we use sour cream instead of mayo. When you make the dip, before baking, it is pretty thick. But as it bakes all the cheeses just melt together and you are left with a creamy concoction of gooey goodness. I plan on posting this recipe to my blog  to spread the love! I urge you to try this recipe. You will NOT regret it.

GREAT recipe!!!  Although I left out the garlic salt (because artichoke hearts usually come in brine) and also used fresh spinach.  I wilted about 90g (because some juice comes out), then chopped and threw that in.  PERFECT!!! Definitely a staple for my dip recipes. Thanks :)

Definately the best A&S dip! I was asked for the recipe by most of the girls I had over for my most recent party. I added a dash of tobasco and used only parm and mozzarella cheeses.

this is not the best ive ever made, this is the best ive ever HAD! don't even think twice about switching out the mayo for sour creme, it makes it a million times better. this is one of my new favorite recipes ever. my mouth is watering just thinking about it! don't forget the buttery toasted thick-sliced bread (add in oven 5-10 minutes before dip is finished depending on your oven..add a little parsely on top for extra flavor and look).

Fabulous recipe without any changes (five stars worth!), and even better once you start tailoring it to your own tastes.  I rarely measure the cheese so don't be worried if you have to fudge it a bit, and have substituted havarti for the romano twice now.  It gives it a creamier consistency and a more mellow flavor.  I usually double the artichokes and have added variation such as roasted red peppers, bacon, sauteed garlic and onions, 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo, canned crab meat, salad shrimp, clams, olives, scallions on top...mmm.  My favorite chip to serve with it are the Simply Naked Pita Chips from costco.

This was a big hit at a potluck.  The only change I made was to use fresh baby spinach, blanched for 30 seconds, instead of frozen spinach.  I will definitely keep this dish in my arsenal of things to serve at parties!

This recipe rivals most restaurants--great for parties!  I like to serve it with toast points, more so than chips. :)
My adjustments are as follows: I usually just buy the italian mix shredded cheese (to top it as well), 1/3 fat cream cheese, light mayo, 1 whole package of green giant froz spinach(easy to thaw), a little more garlic.

This was fabulous!!  I am actually dieting right now and I was looking for some healthier options for appetizers.  I made this recipe with reduced fat cream cheese and instead of the mayo I used Fat Free Sour cream.  I omitted the layer of mozzarella cheese on the top and just stirred in about 1/8 of a cup of it.  I also decreased the rest of the cheese by a little bit and increased the spinach a little bit.  I made sure that I drained the spinach REALLY well, I think that if you didn't the dip wouldn't have as creamy of a texture.  I also added an extra clove of garlic.  I served this with a chunks of french bread, crackers, and pretzels and it was wonderful!!  I had several people tell me this was the best spinach artichoke dip they have ever had, everyone asked me for the recipe, and no one could believe that it was low-fat and low-calorie.  This is definitely going to become a regular when I entertain.

I made this for a dinner party tonight, and everyone absolutely loved it! The only things I did differently were that I stirred in the mozzarella cheese rather than top the dip with it and I used a little less artichokes than what the recipe calls for, as a whole can seemed to be a bit too much. I also added a little more garlic than what the recipe calls for (and I'm glad I did). The dip was a little too thick (but still very good), so the next time I make it, I might add a little more mayonnaise or a splash of milk (?). Also - I found that the romano cheese really added great flavor. I think it may have been a bit bland without it. I also used whipped cream cheese, which made the mixture much easier to stir. I will most definitely make this again!

This dip is so friggin good :) We had a pot luck last nite with WAYYYY too much food so as we were sending food home with people they were fighting over who got to take the last of the dip home! 

I put the dip together in the morning and just kept it in the fridge. About a half hr before I assumed people would show up, I popped it in the oven . But, as always, most were late so I just kept it in the oven with the oven turned off and once people began to arrive i just turned on the broiler for about 5-10 mins. Perfect!!! Definately keeping this recipe! Oh, and the only thing I changed was using 1/2 c of parmesean instead of 1/4 c of parm and 1/4 c of romano.

I've been making this recipe for about 2 years now (since I found it)! It's amazing exactly as written. The one thing that I was unsure of when I first started making it was the kind of artichokes. This is the key to this recipe! I have tried it with the artichokes in the plain water and the artichokes flavored in the oil with seasoning. It's amazing with the flavored artichokes and not so with them in just water. I'm making it again in a few days and I always get rave reviews! Enjoy!!

This recipe is 4 stars with a couple of changes. sour cream instead of mayo, whipped cream cheese, onion and garlic powder, a bit of hot sauce, and mix the mozz in the dip. 6 people and it was gone in a half an hour. room temp by the end but still tasty.

Something is off with this dip! Too "dry"...more like a cracker spread and tasted more like hot cream cheese. There must be an ingredient missing from the original recipe. I'm moving onto the next...this wasn't even close!

I made this recipes slightly differently than called for and it was delicious.  Instead of mayo, I used sour cream.  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes and the juice of half a lemon.  Very good recipe, will be making again.

I love this recipe!!! I have taken it to work and to holiday family parties. This is always requested over and over! The only thing I do, adding to it, is instead of just adding Parmesan and Romano separately I buy the cheese blend of Parmesan, Romano, and Asagio mixed blend. It makes it easier and the Asagio cheese gives it a smoky flavor. I do add one extra clove of garlic and use garlic powder instead. I also use fresh basil instead of dried. Lastly, I let this mixture sit in the fridge overnight! This is key to really lock in all of the flavor. It is soooo good!

Great recipe. I used low fat cheeses and it still turned out well. I also took other people's suggestions and did this: added two green onions, a dash of Tobasco, 1/2 lemon juice, and used 3 cloves of garlic, mixed the mozerella into the dip and sprinkled the top with a little more mozerella and parmesan. Did not use romano cheese. I'd definitely make it again. I rate the recipe as is with 4 stars but if you modify it to your own taste (like I did), it's a 5.

Tonight will be my third time in a 5 weeks of making this dip. You have to try a recipe as written the first to know what you want to tweak to your tastes the second time. First time I dis as the recipes was written EXCEPT I knew the garlic lovers here would need an extra clove. It was amazing and was gone before withing a half hour of it hitting the table. Second time was the same, only I halved the recipe  since there wasn't but two of us and we ate it for dinner, haha, it was delicious. Tonight it my third time and the only thing I wanted to try was adding a couple of Peppadew peppers into the mix, just because we love them. It's in the oven, so we'll know soon!

This is much much better if you omit the mayo. I add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and serve it on bread toasted in olive oil using a frying pan then cut toast into fours.

This is very good! Next time I will add just a little bit more cream cheese to make it a bit thicker. I also baked them in individual sized ramekins and it was fun giving everybody their own dish. I served it with Carrot sticks, celery, raw broccoli, and tortilla chips and my husband loved it.

"This is by far the best artichoke and spinach dip I've ever had! Definately resturant quality! I did however follow the advise of others and replaced the mayo with sour cream, and I mixed the mozzarella cheese in with all the ingredients. I hollow out a loaf of sour dough bread and bake it in the bread bowl. Serve it with pita chips.....DELICIOUS"!!!!!

I have been making my own stock version of  hot spinach and artichoke dip over the last ten years and decided to try something new! I am so glad I did! This was fantastic! I think it's the blend of different cheeses that makes it so tasty. I cheated, I used the "Italian Cheese" which is a blend of 6 cheeses, Asiago, Parmesan, Romano, Fontina, low moisture Mozzarella and Provalone. It made it so much easier to make and added the different shades of flavors to the dip. I also mixed in the regular Mozzarella and on a whim, added a little extra to the top for appearance. I added an extra clove of garlic because I am all about garlic. I was a little leary of the basil but it added a nice flavor to it! Throw out your usual recipe for today and try this one, you will not be sorry!

SO SO SO good! I typically add 50% more garlic and only 3/4 of the spinach and artichokes the recipe calls for (using 100% of both is just too much for me).... this is so good that each time I make it for a party it's gone within 20 min.. I've started doubling the recipe and those are gone in a flash too. I have to make a separate batch for me to have at home if I want to get any and I wind up eating it for breakfast! Perfection.

I fixed this appetizer for my boyfriends birthday party. It was a HUGE hit! Was gone in minutes.  Like the other reviews, I used sour cream instead of mayo and added 1/2 white onion. I also used the 1 tsp. of jarred minced garlic instead of mincing one myself. Will totally  make this dish again!

I loved this dip! I've been trying to find the perfect spinach/artichoke dip and this is it. Definitely going to be my go-to recipe from now on. I took some suggestions from other reviews and used sour cream instead of mayo and also mixed the mozzarella in with everything, then sprinkled a little on top. I also used low-fat cream cheese, mozzarella & sour cream and it still tasted amazing. I can't wait to try it with full fat ingredients!

The best dip ever. I saute the artichokes and spinach with garlic for a little. Then mix everything together.

Made this tonight for a house full of teenagers.  Very well received.  I did leave out the basil, salt and garlic salt since there was ample garlic.  The cheese provided salt too.. very good and easy since I had everyting on hand.  I use the marinated artichoke in a jar which add additional flavor.

I've never had so many raves on a dish that's this easy to make.  I used a blender to chop the artichokes and it took all of 5 seconds.  For the grated cheese, I found a blend of Parm, Romano, and Asiago that I used and worked great.  I accidentally tripled the garlic and I was afraid I over did it until I tasted it and realized it was going to work out, so definitely add more garlic and skip the garlic salt.  I used mayo, but will try sour cream next time as others have suggested to taste the difference.  One final note, I used light cream cheese and light mayo and thought the result was fantastic.

This is a very good dip.  I would even leave out the artichoke next time because you can barely taste them. My only tip is to chop/process the spinach as finely as possible so that the dip isn't so stringy.

Though another glowing review of this wonderful recipe really isn't necessary, I will offer my modifications. I use reduced fat mayo, and use 50/50 regular and light cream cheese. I find it a bit thick and so I add a half cup of 1% milk. I also double the amount of chopped (frozen and thawed but not drained)spinach. Not squeezing the water out adds additional needed moisture, and reduces prep time and mess. I do splurge though, and use monterey jack cheese, which I mix throughout. I don't add additional salt, since the parm and romano add all the salt needed.  I also double (at least) the garlic, and add a pinch of cheyenne. I make this for every holiday, and it is scrumptious!

Awesome recipe-- made this twice over the past 2 days. The second time I made it I only used Parmesan cheese since I couldn't find the rest of the Romano cheese--actually liked it better. Added the whole 10oz. block of frozen spinach, added a little bit of garlic powder, used sour cream, mixed some mozzarella in with the dip and a little extra on top and it was absolutely addicting! My whole family loved this :)

This recipe is amazing!  Very similar to the dips you find in restaurants.  I only added a little bit of milk right before baking and it came out extremely creamy and luscious!!  Would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone in love with artichokes and spinach!!

Throw out all your other artichoke/spinach dip recipes.  This recipe is absolute perfection -- must be the cream cheese, it's the only spinach artichoke dip recipe on this site that uses it rather than sour cream. Very rich, cheesy,  luscious and a nice mellow tang from the artichokes, this one is a heavyweight and needs a substantial cracker or firm sourdough to pile it on.


Like many other posters recommended, I mixed the mozzarella in rather than plop it on top. I also mixed in 2 TBS of sour cream just to give it slightly better stirability (don't ruin it with tons of sour cream--honestly, nearly all recipes on the site call for sour cream as a major ingredient and once you have a cream cheese-ruled dip like this you won't wanna go back to bland ol' sour cream!)


I'm done searching for the magic disappearing dip -- I've found it. My only suggestion -- if you have more than six people or so, DOUBLE THE RECIPE. We had seven guests and this dip was inhaled in minutes.  Gone. Wild! We made it several hours before a party and put it in fridge, covered, so the ingredients (esp. garlic) could really blend and fuse. The pre-packaged romano and parmesan blends in most grocery stores make this extremely easy to make!

Great dip! Instead of cream cheese I used a 15oz can of great northern white beans and blended it all in the food processor.

This dip has become a family favorite at every holiday dinner. It beats every other artichoke/spinach dip I've tried because of the cream cheese and mayo base. Others have too much mayo and seem overly greasy. This one is simply creamy, decadent and delicious! Perfect blend of flavors!

I made this for my family and they just loved it, including my super picky 2 year old! I'd like to add a tip when mixing all of the ingredients, make sure that the cream cheese is well blended and that there are no chunks or else when you dip your pita chip, you'll get a blob of cream cheese! You want everything to be mixed well.

Tasted just as delicious as any restaurant artichoke and spinach dip! However, we used a little bit less of the artichokes than the recipe called for.

I make this dip all the time! company always loves it, and so do I.  I use sour cream instead of mayo and I mix the mozza into the dip rather than on top.  Also increase garlic to 3-4 cloves and skip the garlic salt.  AMAZING!

This was very tasty.. I did however try and find a good "artichoke heart" and what I ended up with was more of the actual artichoke leaf than the heart. I don't like chewing the leaf even if they are soft and marinated. Therefore next time I would buy more than one jar in order to sift through the leafs! Otherwise this was a good recipe.

Made this recipe to spec, and it was incredible. Very rich in flavor, and much thicker than the soupy type you get at a restaurant. You could make changes to suit, but I found it to be delicious as is. If anything I'd recommend using light cream cheese just to make it a bit healthier, also, you can double the amount of cream cheese to make it a little less chunky.

I made this last Thanksgiving (a double batch) and ended up having to make a second double batch because it was gone 30 minutes after the guests arrived. I also acclaimated this to a pasta dish by adding a little cream and chicken stock to it to have a runnier consistancy and some roasted chicken and it was incredible!

This was out of this world. I brought it to a Christmas party and everyone kept asking who brought it and how to make it. I basically made it as is, except I used the entire box of frozen spinach and also mixed the mozzarella in with the dip instead of on top. It's better to get the cheese throughout and not globbed on top. Oh, and I'm pretty sure I may have added an extra clove of garlic....garlic lover here. YUM.

This ended up being delicious and not too strong on the mayo taste (as a lot of restaurants tend to be), but I found it too dry in texture. I didn't overbake and I just do not think it was creamy/dip-like enough. Next time, I'll try a touch more milk, but regardless, I will be making again! :)

Love, love, loved this!  I used a container of plain chobani (greek yogurt) in place of the mayo. Added some more protein & less fat.  I also used only parmesan cheese & an entire box of frozen chopped spinach (squeezed & drained).  It was so incredibly good!!!  I agree with the reviewer who suggested mixing the mozarella in.  I didn't and it was a little awkwardly distributed once we started dipping.  I'm making this again for a party next week & I'm going to try it that way.

To. Die. For. This is THE best Artichoke Spinach dip I have ever tasted. I made it as directed, all the way down to the garlic salt--but I did add about 1/8 cup additional parmesan cheese (wanted to empty the remaining smidge out of one container). SO good!  Look no further--this is the recipe to beat!  A keeper!

I think this was the best spinach artichoke dip I have ever had!  I used light mayo, and a little extra spinach, garlic, and mozzarella.  Great served with tortilla chips and mini pitas.

OMG!  My only suggestion is DOUBLE or TRIPLE the recipe because people are going to want to sit down with a spoon!  I made this for 5 Adults and doubled the recipe.  I wanted the leftover but it was such a rave that I split the remaining in two and sent some chips home.  Next time, I'll make triple and send more with my guests.  THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS IS!

With a few tweaks, this recipe was great! I used two cloves of garlic (omitted the garlic salt) and substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, as suggested by other reviewers. I also doubled the amount of spinach. Made it for some friends and the four of us finished almost the entire dish!

The dip would be perfect for my family IF if I leave out the basil next time! I love basil, but just didn't like it in this particular dip. Also, hot sauce added would be very nice!

Used real garlic and used several cloves. Then again middle easterners love lots of garlic so it depends on your family's/friend's preference. Still craving this dip a week later! It was truly amazing.

This came out fantastic with a few modifications I added roasted garlic and the made it into a paste that gave it a little extra garlic flavor.  Other than that the receipe was delicious, no more ordering spinach dip from that local restaurant for double the price and half the size!!

This was really good.  I used mayo and it was pretty oily, I think next time I will use Sour cream.  I also used fresh sauteed spinach, instead of frozen, and it turned out well.

This dip is awesome. We have made it for several parties and after the first bite, I always see people take another spoonful. We normally serve with sliced french bread and sometimes assorted crackers. It is still wonderful the next day too, if you happen to have leftovers (which is rare).  The last time I made it I substituted Asiago for Romano and Monterey Jack for Mozzarella and it was great. I plan to do some more cheese experiments!

I had a dinner party last night and this was a great hit! I used whipped cream cheese in a tub instead of a cheese block. I used 1/8c mayo + 1/8c sour cream vs all mayo...the mix of the two made it creamier but not quite creamy enough...next time I will try doing the 1/4c of mayo and 1/8c sour cream...definitely use both though. I bought the bagged shredded parm/romano cheese mix vs separate cheeses. I added extra garlic...about 2-3 cloves total (used the minced jar kind) as I LOVE garlic and used the 1/4 tsp garlic salt. I used a 10oz frozen spinach package and was not too much spinach...be sure it is dry though...if you want more artichoke taste just cut it down a bit. Also did a pinch of cayenne...could have added a little more. I cooked it in a brownie size pyrex dish and then transferred it to a serving bowl and served it with tortilla chips. (As someone mentioned earlier, it is better to bake it in a shallow type pan vs a bowl...it seemed to cook better). Next time I will try adding scallions and lemon juice as others have done....but even without these last two ingredients this dish was awesome! Oh, I almost forgot...put all of the ingredients in a food processor (I used my mini-chopper) after all together...this really marinates the flavors and makes it nice and chopped. Also, I made it the night before and then took it out of the fridge about an hour before baking. Fantastic!

This was just okay.  I added a little extra mozzarella (I like a very cheesey dip) and an 1/8 tsp. cayenne for a little heat.  I was not pleased with the consistency of this dip.  I was hoping for something a lot creamier.  I had 3 dips out at the same time, and although people said they liked this one, it did not go.  The next day I doctored it up with 1/4 C. sour cream and 1 C. monterey jack cheese, reheated it, and it tasted better and had the creaminess I was looking for, but I still ended up throwing almost the entire thing away.  I'm very glad I didn't double it.

WOW i dont think I will ever taste a better spinach and artichoke dip. This belongs in a restaraunt!! I am so proud of myself! Used fresh mozzerella & more then recommended, no basil, sour cream instead of mayo, and extra spinach b/c it didn't seem like enough, and a 1/4 cup milk added in...so perfect words can't even describe!!

I prepared this dip this Easter for the hors d'oeuvre table.  My family descended on it like a colony of vultures.  Some of the comments I heard during the disapearing act were "this is the best dip I have ever tasted," "you have to give me this recipe," "what's in this stuff?" and my favorite "get me a chair so that I can sit closer to the bowl."  I am one of those who likes to modify recipes.  In this one, I doubled the garlic.  Other than that, I followed the directions to a T.  A++++++++++++++++++

Yum! I will definately be making this one again! I served it with toasted pita triangles, and it went really well. Like some other said, I substituted some of the mayo for sour cream. I also  added some roasted red peppers to it and it added a great flavor.

This was a easy and delicious recipe!  I had two parties to attend and I made this both times, and everyone raved. I substituted the mayo with sour cream and I bought an Italian 4 cheese fresh shredded mixture, containing romano, parmesean, asiago and provolone cheeses. I mixed the cheese mixture with the cream cheese, sour cream, minced garlic and basil. I gently stirred in the spinach and artichokes and then sprinkled more of the cheese mix on top for baking.  I already have requests to bring it as an appetizer for our family Christmas Eve party.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this for a get together with friends and none of us could eat it.  It was dry and tasteless.  I even added hot sauce to spice it up but it was horrible.  I followed the recipe perfectly except for the hot sauce, but even that couldn't give it life.

This was so fun & easy to make! We have a group that comes over every Friday night & I always try to WOW them with something new...They LOVED this. I got a text from one of the gals yesterday when she was eating at Olive Garden - it said "Your spinach & artichoke dip is SOOO much better than Olive Gardens". Great recipe just how it is!

This recipe was ok, but as with many others, I found it dry and difficult to scoop with tortilla chips. The mayo made it too tangy with a weird after taste and dominated much of the flavor. I took away the mayo, added about 4 oz of goat cheese, a couple dashes of crushed red pepper, 2 more garlic cloves, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and another 1/4 c of Parmesan cheese and the consistency and taste improved quite a bit. I also add about a cup and a half of spinach because I like a thicker, more veggie-filled dip. I'll use this as a base recipe again, but with my own modifications.

THIS IS AWESOME!  Best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had and very easy to make.  I think it took me all of five min. to put together.  I didn't have any romano cheese so I used all parmesan.  I baked it in a glass pie dish. No other changes need to be made.  Perfect!

I've been searching for a great spinach/artichoke dip, and finally found a winner! I made a few moderations to mine. I used two cloves of garlic instead of one, by mistake.(my 12 year old daughter was reading me the recipe from upstairs.. not sure what happened!) I also added 1/4 cup of sour cream to it.. I was serving it the next day, and was afraid it would go dry. The next day, after sitting in the fridge all day, and having already been previously baked the day before.. it needed a bit of milk.. I added just enough to moisten it, threw it in my mother in laws warming oven.. and it was scrumptious.. This is coming from a family of picky eaters.. Everyone hovered over the dip, served in a french round loaf, until it was scraped clean off the bread! My little nephew ate it instead of his Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! As far as using two cloves of garlic instead of one, take caution if anyone does that like myself.. It would definitely be for garlic lovers only!

This was awesome! I took the advice of others and actually mixed in the mozzarella cheese instead of putting it on top. Also, when I first took it out of the oven, I noticed it had a little bit of a runny consistency (although still very good!), so I let it cool down for a little bit, and put it back in the oven for about 10-15 more minutes, which made it really thick and extremely delicious!!!  It tastes just like, or better, than the hot artichoke spinach dip from Olive GardeN!

This dip is delicious. I sauteed fresh spinach in butter and garlic, adding the artichoke hearts as the spinach was wilting. I also used sour cream instead of mayonnaise, and swiss cheese instead of romano. I followed the advice of another comment and mixed half the mozzarella into the mixture before putting it in the baking dish, and then sprinkling the rest on top with a little bit of grated asiago. I served it with tortilla chips and with slices of toasted ciabatta (brushed with garlic olive oil before baking at 350 F for 10 minutes), and it was gone very quickly. Thank you for sharing such a fabulous recipe! :)

I thought it was a good recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and I added 3/4 cup  half and half to make it less dry.
It was to much next time maybe I'll use 1/3 cup.  otherwise it is a great recipe.

Excellent!!  I used both reduced fat cream cheese and mayo, added an entire 10 oz box of chopped spinach, 3 cloves of diced fresh garlic, used 3/4 cup of an italian cheese blend, and halved the basil...it was INCREDIBLE.  Great served with fresh diced roma tomatoes on top.

I made this for a "girls night out" one evening and everyone loved it.  The mozzarella on top was a bit hard to get through once the dish cooled off, so I warmed it back up and mixed the mozzarella up into the rest of the dish.  It worked great and made it even more cheesy.

This is a fantastic recipe as written.  However, as you adapt it to your own tastes, some suggestions that I have are to 1) not be afraid of fresh garlic!  I use FAR more than a clove (more like half a head or more, depending on the size of the head) b/c I LOVE garlic and it makes this dish divine.  Also, I like to mix in a handful of the powder Parmesan for flavor along with shredded (and cheese is good).  I prefer the spinach and artichokes to be chopped small rather than roughly chopped (I use my food processor for this, as well as to chop the garlic).  Make sure they are very dry!  A ricer works well, or your hands to squeeze out the liquid before chopping.  I use half of a box 10 oz box of frozen spinach and that's the perfect amount.  Add a dash of red pepper flakes if you like it spicy.  Top it with some diced tomatoes, serve on garlic bread and you have a delicious meal.

This dip was the best hot spinach and artichoke I've had- I actually prefer it over any I've had from restaurants. I did fell that it needed a little something, so I just added garlic powder, onion powder, and extra parmesan cheese. So delicious:)

Oh how I loooove spinach artichoke dip and this is the only recipe I use to make it! I haven't even tried any other recipes because I like this one so well. However, I gave it 4 stars because I think it needs a little "finesse" to really come out super. Some reviewers complained of a "fishy" or weird taste - this is probably from the spinach. Frozen boxed spinach can have a weird fishy taste. Try frozen in a bag or fresh. Many found the dip too thick - and indeed it does come out thick if prepared as written. I add a lot more creamy white stuff, usually some combination of plain yogurt and sour cream with just a few squirts of mayo - to total up to a cup. You could also reduce the cream cheese if its still too thick. Also more cheese - and mix the mozzarella in instead of sprinkling on top. Given these additions, I also use a good bit more spinach and always the full can of artichokes, both diced up quite fine. Always turns out delicious and even the leftovers heat up well.

Ridiculous! This was by far the best spinach and artichoke dip I've had.  I followed the others recommendations and used sour cream and I also doubled the fresh garlic. I used the best artichoke hearts (grilled and in olive oil with some vinegar) which has ruined me ;) this dip went in under 45 min being consumed by 8 people. It was a huge hit. I made it the night before and put in a dish mad baked it just before I served it!!! Thank you for this great recipe.

So grateful this is the recipe I decided to go with.  This is stupendous with minor modifications.  As the rest say, substitute the mayo with sour cream.  I also used fresh spinach that I cooked in some heavy cream.  I added a dash of paprika and cayenne pepper.  Do the rest as it and the bowl will be gone in under 1 minute.

I made this spinach artichoke dip for a New Year's party, and it was a big hit. The flavor was perfect, and only took a few minutes to make. I did double the recipe because of the number of people that were attending, and I am excited because there are now leftovers to eat for lunch today! The only thing that I changed was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I figured with the cheeses there was enough salt in it so I wanted to cut back a little. I will definitely be making this again sometime! Thank you for sharing the recipe, Tiffany.

Delicious!  I ran short on time, so literally tossed all ingredients into the bowl, put it in the oven, stirred it when it became soft and then ate it with chips once it was cooked through.  Still to-die-for delicious!

I make this all the time, its my "go-to" when I am going to a party/dinner party. It get rave reviews every time. I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt as I think the garlic salt makes it too salty.

This is my go to recipe when company is over. So easy to make and the reviews are always the same..."This is the best Spinach Artichoke Dip Ever!!!" Which of course is then followed up with "Can I have the recipe." I think my family wishes we had company more often just so that they could indulge in this scrumptious dip more often. Simply can't give it enough stars to do it justice!

This is a classic in my recipe list. On a christmas edition of my favorite cooking magazine I saw a similar recipe and tried it, it was good but not raving good. I then saw this recipe, it's so good I get asked to bring it to all dinner parties.

I made this for a work potluck and it absolutely stole the show.  It was gone within 10 minutes, and at least a dozen of my coworkers personally complimented me or asked for the recipe. However, I agree with other reviewers that the original recipe makes for a very thick, heavy dip, so my only modification was to add some chicken stock (about 1/2 cup) to thin it out a bit.  Still, this dish is really flavorful and delicious.  I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe to take to a Christmas party and served it with tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it.  I saved a little for my family to try, but, as I was making dinner I thought, "this would be really good spooned over tilapia".  So, I put the chips away and after sauteeing the tilapia, I spooned the sauce on it and covered the pan for a few minutes so the sauce would warm up and melt a little.  My family thought it was fantastic!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Really good and huge hit with the roommies.  I didn't have much artichoke so I add more spinach, still great!  I will probably use the same recipe to make just a straight hot spinach dip.

This recipe was a hit at our last party! Next time I'm gonna have to make two batches because it got devoured. The only change I made was adding a packet of dry onion soup mix and it was absolutely amazing. This will be a regular at our house now without a doubt.

This was a big hit when I made it for friends and family. I also used sour cream instead of mayonnaise to make it a little less greasy. I mixed the mozzarella cheese into the mixture and topped with some shredded Asiago cheese. Instead of putting the dip into one baking dish I used mini pie tins so everyone had there own individual dish.
I lightly buttered some pita bread and then fried them gently until golden brown and crisp. I cut the pita into triangle wedges and placed onto a serving platter and watched it all disappear! Everyone will be asking you for this recipe :)

This is the BEST dip I've ever tasted and/or made.  We made it for Thanksgiving & it was devoured.  Then I made it for a Christmas party with Moms. It was enjoyed.  Then again for New Year's Eve where I discovered everyone loving it and raving over it. It's surely one that I will make over and over and keep it in my Holiday recipes.  AWESOME!  I didn't change anything but perhaps added more garlic.  I also did sliced mozzarella on top instead of shredded.

Very good but does not make a very large quantity as is.  I wanted enough for an oval baking dish so I did double everything and used 1 box of frozen spinach. Served with toasted baguette slices and the 
dish came home empty. Great party food.

I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  Many people asked for the recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used sour cream instead of mayo, an entire box of frozen spinach (just over 1 cup), 2 t of minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and mixed the mozzarella in with all the other cheeses instead of sprinkling it on top.  I will make this again!

I followed some of the changes that were listed--I used sour cream instead of mayo (texture was great), used 3-4 cloves of garlic, used only grated paremesan cheese (all I had on hand) and used shredded swiss cheese instead of the mozzarella.  I also mixed the swiss in the dip as well as on the top---it was great.   I mixed this the night before and stuck it in the fridge--then when I needed it, I popped it in the microwave for a couple minutes---perfect!!!!!  Next time I will make a double batch as I only got two bites---the dip went extremely fast!!!  My boys loved it!  Highly recommended.

Loved the recipe...I would put more mozzarella than parm and romano cheeses next time, but that is only because I would like the dip to be more creamy and the cheese stretch when dipped out of the container.

AWESOME dip! I substituted mascarpone for the cream cheese and wow! Absolutely amazing. Better then TGIFridays. With the leftovers, I made a terrific turkey sandwich on honey wheat bread with the hot artichoke/spinach spread.

This is by far the best Spinach Artichoke Dip I have ever made! Made it exactly as written and it was perfect. I dont know why people were having a problem with it being dry mine was very creamy and yummy. My boyfriend adores this and all of his co workers are very jealous when he brings it in for dinner.lol. Looks like he will be bringing it to the next potluck! Served with toasted french bread that was drizzled with olive oil and a tiny bit of garlic salt and it was wonderful! Thanks for the amazing recipe Tiffany!

WOW. Would give more than 5 stars if I could. This is better than almost any restaurant. Would be good with pita chips, bread bowl or tortillas. I am currently on a low carb diet, so this worked out well for me. I had to get creative for dipping though, so I've used pork rinds, veggies, and stuffed mushrooms with it.  Didn't really make any changes, but I did kind of throw everything in without measuring.

This is my staple when it comes to appetizers! I will mix mine all in my Crockpot, along with the mozzarella cheese. I usually purchase the parmesan and romano mix of cheeses and use garlic from a can found in the produce section. I do not thaw my spinach but break it up in to my Crockpot. Just have to watch it to make sure it doesn't get to over cooked!

I used Jack cheese instead of the mozzarella. This was very good, everyone enjoyed it. Using whipped cream cheese might make it easier to mix up, but I didn't read the reviews before getting the ingredients. I mixed mine with my hands because it was too difficult with the spoon, even though I left the cream cheese out to soften for a few hours.

This recipe worked very well for me and it's super delicious! The best thing I loved about this recipe is how flexible you can be with the measurements, no measuring cups required =) Also I just realized that I used dried oregano instead of basil, but it still tasted great! I think one full can of artichoke is too much, so I used half the can approx. 3 hearts. I also tried this dip with pita chips (stacys twice baked pita chips), and again it was pure deliciousness. Good for any occasion! Plus, you can mix everything a day ahead, and bake when ready. I LOVE THIS DIP!!!!

We love Applebee's spinach & artichoke dip and wanted to make it at home.  So I searched and was excited to find this recipe with over 1,000 positive reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was not as good as I expected.  It was thick and all I could taste was the cream cheese but not the other cheeses.  I had some leftover so to thin it out, I added some milk.  It helped but still all I taste is the cream cheese.  I will look for another recipe that is close to the restaurant quality dip that we love.

I originally rated this 3 stars but after reheating it and trying some a few hours after it baked, I have to adjust that rating. I made it as stated, and it's just not good. It's got a weird taste. Definitely read the reviews on this one. It seems like a lot of the people who gave it 5 stars were rating their own version of the recipe. The Spinach & Artichoke Dip Restaurant Style recipe on this site is much better.

I mixed in the shredded cheese as other reviewers did and it took FOREVER to brown.  It was really good though with french bread slices.  Definitely a repeat!

This was an excellent recipe!  Chop the spinach and artichokes into tiny little pieces, makes it a nicer texture.  I would add a little more spinach and I would make it in a bread bowl.  MMMGood

First I'll start by saying I love artichoke/spinach/parmesan dips... I order them in restaurants all the time.  LOVE them. So I was excited to make this one.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made it exactly as stated.  Then I did it again, replacing 1/8 c of the mayo with sour cream.  I thought both of them were horrible.  And my guests must have agreed - they each tried it and left it on their plate.

Very delicious.  I make it ahead and then bake just before guests arrived.  Found I could use freshly chopped spinach in place of the frozen - it did, however, give a light green tint to the dip.   Added a chopped jalepeno to add more zest to the taste of it.  Served with Ritz crackers.

I JUST made this for a potluck @ work.  MAJOR hit!!! I sub mayo with sour cream, doubled everything and add a couple shakes of cayenne pepper for a little "kick" at the end. I had it going in a crockpot in my cube and everytime I opened the lid to stir, my coworkers were moaning. LOL!!!

This is a fantstic recipe. The only thing I did differently is I used real artichokes instead of canned. I steamed the artichokes and then scraped some of the meat off the leaves and cut the artichoke heart into chunks. I wasn't sure if it was going to make a difference but it really did! The artichoke itself was so rich and really added to the dip. Yummmm, I will defnitely be making this one again!

So yummy! Definitely restaurant quality! I have tried many spinach artichoke dip recipes and this one is definitely a keeper! One of the better recipes. Served with crackers and corn tortilla chips.

AMAZING!! I have been making this recipe for over 4 years and it is always a favorite. I have had many friends and family request this appetizer for gatherings and there is usually a crowd around this dip. I have never had a dip at any restaurant that even comes close to tasting as good!

This was a good dip, but definitely needs to be served in a crockpot to keep it warm.  I simply placed the casserole on the table straight out of the oven.  It was good then.  But as the night and dip wore on, it became inedible.  I would try it again, but I will be sure to keep it warm.  As for changes, I 1) used sour cream instead of mayo, 2) 1 cup fresh spinach instead of frozen, 3) about 4 cloves of roasted garlic and 4) 1/2 cup of parmesan instead of the parm/romano mix and 5) mixed most of the mozzarella in with the dip and only sprinkled a little bit on top.

Its the most requested recipe i have ever made. I use sour cream instead of mayo and use my stand mixer for everything. Even throw in the spinach & artichoke once everything is blended. I have made it the night before and cooked the day of and it still turns out great. Super easy and delicious recipe!

I didn't realize how easy it was to make this dip!  The only thing was that it was a little too salty for my taste, but that may be due to the fact that I had marinated artichokes and didn't account for the amount of salt in those puppies.  Overall, thanks for the great recipe and I will be making this again soon!

This dip was a hit at our BBQ! I stirred the mozzerella cheese into the mixture instead of putting it on top, and baked it in a sourdough bread bowl. (I also cooked a 10-oz. package of fresh spinach instead of using the frozen, just because I like fresh spinach better.) Everyone loved it, and both my father-in-law and husband said it was the best they have ever had. I am sure this will be requested again soon!

I made this the day before I planned to serve it as an appetizer on Easter Sunday and put it in the fridge.  Then, right before I was putting it in the oven, I realized I had forgotten to add the Mozzerella cheese which some reviewers said should be mixed in instead of sprinkling on top.  Well, I mixed the cheese in quickly and popped it in the oven.  Wow!  It was terrific!  My mother-in-law tried it before she knew what was in it and said, "Gee, I didn't think I liked artichokes!"  Plus I got a rquest for the recipe.  Very very good. Thanks!

I started making this dip a couple of years ago and taking it to parties for an appetizer.  Everywhere I have taken it, I have gotten many rave reviews and people asking for the recipe.  I have even been asked to bring it again (but to double the recipe next time).

Quick tip that I do: I use fat free cream cheese and mayonaise instead of the full fat stuff.  Also, I get low fat tortilla chips and low fat cheeses if I can find it.  You would think that would change the flavor...but it still gets great reviews.  When I tell the girls that it's calorie friendly, they all love it even more!!!  It's worth trying and healthier.

What a hit!! I made this as one of my New Years Eve appitizers and it was great! I just have one small time and money saving tip! Where it asks for 1/3 cup of each Romano and Parmesan cheese, I actually use 2/3 cups of Kraft Shredded Parmesan, Romano and Asiago Natural Cheese (in the canister)! It saved time and $!! What an excellent recipe!! Im adding it to my recipe box for sure!! Check out my recipe for Eazy Breezy Chicken Cheezy Dip for your next party or get together!! YUM!

I tried this even though I have another dip I like a lot and people always ask me for that one- mostly based on the reviews.  This one is way more stiff and dry.  I recommend the Restaurant Style Spinach and Artichoke Dip from this site, increasing the amt of cream cheese in that one to a whole package.  That one is creamy and you can dip chips in it easily.

This was a great appetizer.  I served it at a recent Christmas party for colleagues and it was the first thing to disappear amidst raves and requests for the recipe!  I did do a few things differently because I couldn't find everything in Poland, where I'm currently living: I used only parmesan cheese (3/4 cup fresh shredded), I replaced the mayonnaise with sour cream (12%) as recommended by some other reviews, I used fresh spinach that I chopped and put directly in the dip instead of frozen, and I used a standard sized package of fresh mozzarella which I chopped into very small blocks and mixed in with the dip instead of on top (I was surprised that it didn't make the dip too watery, either) and I omitted the basil.  I served it with tortilla chips and toasted baguette, although the tortilla chips seemed more popular.  It was very good, even with all my changes!

I made this for a girls get together--went over well.  Four stars as I modified the recipe based on other's advice.  Used sour cream instead of mayo, used fresh moz. instead of shredded, used all parm, no romano; used three cloves of garlic, no garlic salt, no additional salt (enough salt in the artichoke hearts and cheeses).  Also, I softened the hunks of moz w/the cream cheese by placing in a metal bowl and setting in warm water for a few minutes.  It turned out great--people definitely ask for the recipe on this one!  This is a very thick dip--tortilla chips do not stand a chance.  I served with a spoon and had some toasted cocktail breads and pita chips to serve with it.

Exactly what I was looking for (with a few changes suggested by other reviewers). I doubled the recipe for 12 people and it was just the right amount. Doubled, I increased the spinach to 16 oz, added 1/2 cup of sour cream, added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, added 8 oz of sliced water chestnuts (chopped), added one small onion (chopped) and split the mozzarella up - mixing half into the mixture and leaving half on top. Excellent!

This was pretty durned good. I'd give 5 stars, but I ended up using sour cream instead of mayo, mixing 1/2 mozzarella in with the other stuffs, and adding garlic powder. It was delicious that way. Great base for a yummy dip! My 2 and 4 year olds loved it too.

We made this version for Thanksgiving and it was a hit-just the right amount of cheese and artichoke/spinach mixture.  I also added one fresh minced garlic clove for added flavor.  We served ours with slices of bagette bread and seasoned crackers.  This will definately be frequented appetizer in our household :)

This is delicious!  I made it without trying it for a baby shower at work and it was a huge hit.  I even had some store bought ranch dip next to it in case it wasn't that great and no one even touched the store bought stuff.  One thing I did notice is that it seemed rather thick, the 2nd time I made this (all for myself) I added just enough milk to loosen the mixture, I would say just under 1/4 c.  Perfecto!

We doubled the recipe and used sour cream instead of mayo.  We thought this had excellent flavor but my husband said it was too thick and asked I find a creamier version.  Perhaps I will take another reviewers suggestion of adding a little milk or more sour cream.  No extra salt needed.  If there is any leftovers it makes a great spinich artichoke omlette!!

You can not go wrong w/ this recipe. I took the advice of other reviews & substituted 1/2 the mayo for sour cream, played w/ other cheeses, & squeezed 1/2 a lemon in...it tastes just like restaurant style dip. Perfect for potlucks! I've been recieving multiple requests to make oven ready batches for people. Thinking of charging them a small fee. =)

This dip is amazing! i didn't have any ramano and couldn't find any at the store so i just doubled the parmesan and it still tasted great! I used garlic powder instead of minced (doubled the amount, yum!) and sour cream instead of mayo like suggested by another reviewer. I made it a day ahead of time and put it in the oven about 35 min before the party was to start. Served with pita chips and tortilla chips.

I made this using 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese because I didn't have any romano cheese.  Followed a suggestion here to use a clove of fresh garlic rather than garlic salt.  And mixed the mozzarella into the dip.  It was fabulous.  I served it with naan bread, but I think next time I might try baguette, as another reviewer did.  Yum!

Awesome dip!  Definitely need to mix the mozzarella in.  I experimented both ways and it is much better mixed instead of on top.  I also added 1/4 cup sour cream...I definitely needed it for my taste.

Holy !  I am just saying--fabulous.  Probably my new favorite appetizer, and I've never been an spinach/artichoke dip fan.  Made the recipe exactly as stated expect I did add a handful of the shredded Mozzarella in the mix.  Can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving and hear the raves . . .

I made this for a party I had and I didn't even get to taste it.  It was gone before I could get the rest of the appetizers on the table.  It was a big hit.  I will make this again and hopefully I will get to taste it!  I did add a few more cloves of garlic because I love garlic and added a little bit of sour cream to make it creamier.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this recipe!  I changed it a little though and there was an empty dish at the end of the night!  I used 1/2 c. of mayo., 8oz. sour cream, 8oz. cream cheese, 1c. of the grated romano/parmesan cheese, 1tsp. minced garlic, 1c. shredded moz. cheese along with the spinach and artichokes.  I mixed it all together and baked it with about 1/2c. of moz. cheese on top.  Excellent!!!!

I have to admit, I am surprised that none of the reviewers found this recipe to be very very salty. Perhaps it was the cheese I used. I would not add additional salt, I would also leave out the  garlic salt and add more fresh garlic. Also, served it with nacho chips, which also added to the salt. However, even by the spoon, it was salty.

Taste great but the texture is off. Not sure if the cream cheese is the cause of the thick like texture but i would maybe half the cream cheese next time to see if that helps, maybe add a dash of milk to thin it out. Idk but the taste is fine. I recommend leaving out the basil, not really needed. I used minced garlic, garlic powder, a dash of garlic salt, and salt & pepper. Once finished in the oven i top with diced tomatoes

Made this dip.. Used a few suggestions -  used 2-3 garlic cloves and sour cream in place of mayo ( I just don't like mayo)  no garlic salt. Didn't need it with 3 cloves.. It was excellent!!!  Everyone loved it  for me - it was fool proof!! I would highly recommend

Yum!!  Thought I had chopped spinach, but alas, I did not.  So I used frozen broccoli florets - thawed and chopped - instead.  Also added a small can of drained green chilis and a tablespoon of chopped sundried tomatoes (it was for a Christmas gathering, and I needed red!)  This is such a big hit at pot lucks.  Can't go wrong!

Big hit!  I doubled everything except for the artichoke hearts because I only had 1 can.  I also added a little ranch seasoning. I placed all in a slow cooker and warmed it up on low. Will make again!

Fantastic recipe. I brought this to a potluck and it was a huge success. It was gone faster than anything else on the table, and many people asked for the recipe. I followed other suggestions and changed the mayo to sour cream. Added more mozzarella in the mixture, as well as on top. I also turned the oven on broil for 5 extra minutes to brown the cheese on top. Wow yum. Will be making many more times.

Love this recipe.  I've been using it for years.  I usually double the recipe, use 1 batch and freeze the other.  Ideal for Christmas when you have company dropping in.

I actually combined a little bit of the two most popular artichoke spinach dip recipes on this site. But most of it came from this one, all I substituted was alfredo sauce for mayo, and i cut out the romano cheese simply because I didn't have it. I also I put a lot more spinach, probably 3 times as much. It tasted great!

This was perfect and so easy to make! Use an 8x8 or 9x9 glass baking dish. Also, trader joes has a great Parmesan & Romano grated cheese blend which is what I used. Also didn't have fresh garlic so just used garlic powder.  Also omitted the mozzarella as I didn't have it on hand and honestly you don't even need it. I served with sliced baguette drizzled with olive oil and baked at 350 for 5 mins. Sooooo good!!

This was a HIT! I did use whipped cream cheese, a few dashes of hot sauce and some cayenne pepper. I followed the suggestions of others and mixed the mozzarella in and added some on top and used some extra spinach as well.

This  was so good!  I used low-fat mayo, low-fat cream cheese, and low-fat mozzarella...and it was great!  Since everyone was raving about using sour cream I will try it that way next time- looking forward to it.  My daughters will not touch spinach with a 10-foot pole but gobbled this down!

SOOOOOOOO good. I made a half batch and the cream cheese ingredient serving size was confusing, so I put in double the recommended cream cheese by accident, only realized now, but still out of this world good.

I love this recipe! I made a few alterations, mostly just using fresh ingredients instead of frozen (fresh mozzarella, spinach,--make sure to pat this try after cooking!--and garlic cloves), but used a jar of artichoke hearts and it tasted just fine. I subbed sour cream for mayonnaise as other comments suggested, and used about half a cup of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, as I didn't have any Romano. Make sure to mix in the mozzarella with other ingredients, and grate some parmesan on top to give you a nice golden-brown crust.

Mine ended up a bit on the dry side, probably because I let it bake for too long, but it was very very good and great as a leftover!

Very minor changes: Use entire box of frozen spinach (thawed/drained)a little more of all the cheeses, NO BASIL, and half sour cream half mayo, and a small can of diced water chestnuts! Delicious!! I'm licking the bowl now and it was a huge hit at bookclub last night. My new go to for spinach artichoke dip!

This dip was amazing! I only had about 4-6oz of cream cheese, so I just made up the difference with sour cream. And although I love basil, I didn't have any today and I didn't find that I missed it at all. Plus, there's enough mayo in it that you can skip greasing the pan. 
In short, this dip is creamy and cheesy without being too thick or too runny. Just perfect!

This dip is FABULOUS!!!  I made it for a dinner party I was hosting and the guests couldn't stop raving about it. Its truly an awesome dip and definitely an appetizer staple from now on.  I followed the advice of others and used sour cream instead of mayo, put the mozzarella in the mixture instead of on top, and doubled the garlic. The best part....because its a cream cheese base I used the cold leftovers as a bagel spread the next morning and it was just as fabulous!

UPDATE: I have made this at every party Ive hosted & pot lucks attended and its ALWAYS gotten rave reviews.

I make this recipe all the time and love it! It's always a hit. I have made some changes, though which make it suit my taste a bit more. I always use fresh spinach, not frozen, and two cloves of garlic. I use low-fat cream cheese and sour cream (in place of mayonnaise), and don't use basil or garlic salt--sometimes a dash of garlic powder, or a few dashes of crushed red pepper. Additionally, to make prep a lot quicker I just use a reduced fat italian cheese blend rather than all of the individual cheeses--1/2C or so in the mix and another 1/4 on top. Turns out great EVERY TIME--this is a very forgiving recipe!

The flavor was good but I was really expecting a cheesy, gooey artichoke dip (like Ruby Tuesdays). This is more of a cream cheese dip. I guess it just depends on which type of dip you prefer. Maybe if I added extra cheeses...not making this one again.

This Is Great With Greek/Fage Yogurt Instead Of Mayo And Sour Cream. I Added Sml diced Water chesrnuts And Serrano Chili. Sauting FresH Spinach With Garlic Gave It A Richer Taste. Also Only Cheese I Used Was Parmasean-Pecorino.Delicious!

I love spinach & artichoke dip and this one was AWESOME! I've been disappointed before but wow. At first I thought it was a bit too garlicy but I seemed to like it after a few more bites.

I added a pound of chorizo and doubled the recipe and it was amazing!  I also didn't have mayonnaise so I used ranch dressing and it was great!

Hands down, the best dip ever! I followed the recipe to a "t", there's no need for any changes. Actually, I did use a bit more cheese than called for, but M's a cheese-a-holic so.... that's that! Keeping this for sure, thanks Tiffany!

The taste on this was wonderful. I did some of the things others recommended, like subbing sour cream for some of the mayo, adding more spinach, and mixing in the Italian mix cheese instead of putting on top. The only thing that keeps it from being 5-star, in my opinion, is that it comes out pretty crumbly and not really like a dip. I will work on making it creamier -- maybe using fresh mozzarella and adding more sour cream as others did -- but I will definitely make again. Everyone loved it as it was for the taste.

It tastes better when mayo is increased to 1/2 cup and garlic to 2 cloves. Also add 1/2 cup sour cream and fold in the mozzarella cheese so it doesn't for a tough crust at the top. With the changes suggested, it is awesome!

I've made this dip many times now, and it usually ends up being the star of the show because everyone gathers around the dip saying that they can't stop eating it. 

I substitute light sour cream for the mayonnaise and also light cream cheese (can't tell the difference). What really makes this dip incredible is if you use FRESH mozzarella cut into small cubes and mixed into the dip for baking so that you get small chunks of melted cheese as you dip. I also add extra garlic and extra herbs (italian seasoning works fine). 

Soooo good. It gets completely devoured every time!

Very yummy! I made some slight modifications on this recipe.  I substituted sour cream for the mayo, omitted the basil and garlic powder and doubled the spinach and mozzarella.  Then, after reading some negative reviews that said it was "too thick" I added a few tablespoons of heavy cream to ensure it was nice and creamy.  Tossed it all in a loaf pan and baked for a half hour.  It was superb.  I served it with tortilla chips and crispy baguette slices. Would highly recommend serving for a party.  I will definitely be making this again! :)

This is very good.  I added sour cream the last 1/2 hour of cooking. I mixed it all up and threw it in the crock pot and cooked on high for 2 hours then kept on warm for the few hours it lasted at my summer party.  Don't substitute the mayo for sour cream, you lose out on creaminess...add sour cream if you want but don't skip the mayo.

I thought it was good, not great. Subbed sour cream for the mayo, added another clove of garlic and omitted the basil. I don't think it was bad by any means, but probably won't try this recipe again.

This dip was very easy and absolutely DELICIOUS!! I served these with a pita chip recipe I found on allrecipes - Perfect Pita Chips by Taryn and they paired perfectly.  Everyone said it was better than any restaurants they've tried.  This one is going in my recipe box :D

Four stars following the recipe. 

Five stars when I replaced the mayo with sour cream and mixed the cheese into the dip before baking - absolutely delicious!

I made this exactly as directed for a New Year's Eve party.  Everyone, including myself, LOVED it and decided it was even better than any of the many restaurant versions we've had.  It also reheats beautifully in the microwave - even several days later.  I even stirred some up with macaroni as a side dish the next night instead of macaroni & cheese... Awesome!

THIS is it!! My husband and I sometimes enjoy spinach and artichoke dip at different restaurants when we go on our dates. Even though I've made it several times at home, it never tasted as good or creamy as the ones in the restaurants. This recipe changed that! This one is as good as any we've had! It is going directly into my favorite recipes and I will be making it more often! I followed the recipe ingredients but used my own homemade mayo from this site, stirred in the mozzarella as someone suggested and bought fresh spinach so I cooked it before adding it to the dip. I mixed everything with my hand mixer and then transferred to my mini slow cooker dip crock which warmed it and kept it warm for our New Years eve guests. Sooooo yummy! I'd give it more stars if I could! Thanks Tiffany!

There were a number of appetizers Christmas night but this was by far the best. It was gone almost as fast as I put it out.  If I made it for a group again, I'd probably do a double batch.

This is AMAZING dip! It was all gone within 30 minutes. However, I changed up the original recipe a little bit. I first put the artichoke hearts, spinach and a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic into the blender and blended it until it was blended but not completely ground. Then I mixed all the ingredients into a bowl. BUT, I added extra cheese and a little asiago cheese, I also added 2 tsp of minced garlic and 1/4 cup of half & half, mixed in most of the mozzarella in with the dip and it turned out incredible. I will continue to make this recipe, it's SO GOOD! P.S (also didn't use mayo, sub sour cream)

Very good but I would add a 1/4 c. of sour cream AND reduce the cream cheese to 6 ounces.  Also, like others stated, mix the cheese IN with the other ingredients so it doesn't get hard on top.  Right before serving, I sprinkled a little extra parm on top.  Excellent!

I made this for my daughters baby shower and it was a huge hit!  This is a great basic recipe because you can add pretty much whatever you like and it will still be amazing.  You can sub mayo for sour cream, add bacon or peppers....oh the possibilities are endless.....

Did not turn out well for me, but maybe it was my mistake since so many ppl loved this recipe. I like the creamy texture that many restaurants have, but when I made this mine had a very stiff texture that was hard to dip in. Maybe i had too much spinach, I did have to change up some ingredients bc of what I had on hand but I stuck pretty close to the original recipe. The taste was good, but not creamy and delicious like i expected. I threw it all out, all those expensive ingredients!!

I put in three cloves of garlic instead of the one (I'm a garlic fiend, what can I say?). It was delicious. I served this with carrot and celery sticks as well as some white tortilla chips.

It went so quickly! Make double because it's THAT good.

Look no further for a spinach and artichoke dip recipe. This. Is. Phenomenal. It tastes like something you would get at a restaurant, only better. The only changes I have ever made were to add more garlic (my husband and I are big garlic fans), and to mix the mozzarella in instead of putting it on top (so it doesn't make those unsightly cheese puddles at the top after baking).

It's this good: the last time I took it to a party, though it's always a hit, people liked it so much that the host's food was ignored until my dish was completely clean of any dip. The only problem? You'll never have any leftovers for yourself!

Delicious! I used asiago instead of parmesan because I bought it by mistake, but it was still amazing!  I served it with small slices of French bread, but my husband lost all inhibitions and went with Fritos.  Will definitely be making again!

This was pretty good.  I had no Romano so ended up using probably about a cup of parm, plus used more mozzarella - about a cup of that as well..   I left out the basil, added some cayenne and more mayo.  Also used marinated artichoke hearts because I like the flavor better.  All in all,  pretty good, but I'll keep looking for a recipe that just blows me away.

This dip is AMAZING! I also added 1/4C sour cream as well. The creamier the better! Best spinach and artichoke dip I've made so far!

This was so great! I always order this at restaurants and now I can make it at home whenever I want! My family loved it and it was gone in less than 30 minutes. Next time I will definately double the recipe. The only thing that I changed was that I put more garlic (we love garlic) and I wasn't able to use garlic salt because I didn't have any so I just used garlic powder and a little extra salt. Also, wasn't able to find Romana cheese so I just bought the Italian blend cheese which had it in it. I also mixed the mozzarella in with the dip and just sprinkled the good Parmesan on top before baking. This was awesome and I will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a gathering and everyone loved it! I did add a clove of real garlic rather than garlic salt and I replaced the mayo with sour cream like others suggested. I will admit I was a little disappointed with the lack of creaminess, as I thought it would be more creamy. I'm thinking that's because I used sour cream rather than mayo. Either way, that's just me being a little picky, as the taste was phenomenal! Also, I didn't have the separate cheeses listed so I used an Italian Cheese blend which had both the parm and romano cheesed in it. It was a great, fairly easy recipe to make and I'll definitely be making it again!

Really good recipe.  Really easy to make.  Thought it a bit heavy on the artichoke though, which is why I only gave it four stars.  I'd suggest a smaller can/jar, if possible.

What I love about this recipe is you can add pretty much anything.  We added a bit of leftover roasted eggplant and some soft tofu - the tofu really added a great, creamy consistency!

I was so pleased to read a review that had actually made the original recipe.  Looks to me that everyone preferred REBC's recipe.  We like this one just fine.  As is---anyone having it asks for recipe.

This is so good, i made it for my sisters baby shower and it was a huge hit with all the pregnant women! the only change i made was i put it in a bread bowl, i purchased a medium size round loaf of bread and cut a round top out of it and took all the insides out, then i  placed them on a pan and toasted them and used it for dipping! it was GREAT!

Made as directed - was yummy. Will make again but add a bit more garlic, may try with sour cream instead of mayo. Had a bit left over so we pounded some chicken breasts- added a tbsp of the dip to the center of the chicken and rolled it up- was amazing! Thank you for the sharing the recipe

This dip is AMAZING....so good!!! I followed the recipe exactly but also used some information from other reviewers about combining most of the Mozzarella Cheese into the mixture and just sprinkling a little bit on top. This made it easy to scoop the dip out. I will definitely be making this dip again and again!

i looove this dip. i honestly think it is better than anything you get at a restaurant. i have made this multiple times, i normally add some alfredo sauce which the artichoke & spinach dip restaurant style from this site uses. it is super easy and makes enough for a small party. so glad i found this recipe!!!

I'm not a big fan of plain spinach dips, but love artichoke dip. My husband wanted to try this one and I was a bit skeptical but once I tried it I could hardly stop eating it! I was so creamy and cheesy, just the right amount of seasonings, it's definitely a keeper in my recipe box. Will be making anytime we do an appy night.

Made this for company last night, it was a big hit and I was asked for the recipe.  I mixed mozzarella cheese in the mix and put on top. I added some bell pepper seasonings, fresh ground pepper and extra garlic.  Served with tortilla chips and thin sliced french bread....Mmmm

Super yummy... used a clove of garlic strained through a garlic press, however it was a little too much garlic flavoring for my family despite our love for garlic! Still very delicious. Next time just going to stick with the garlic salt. Loved the Romano.

Can I say that this recipe made me look like a master chef to my friends!! I love this dip when we eat out, but had never tried making it at home. I made this last night to serve along with the demonstrators dishes for a Pampered Chef party. Awesome! The only way I could find romano cheese at two stores was in a fresh grated mix with parmesan cheese (not the green can) so I went with that. Also, I roasted 4 cloves of garlic and mixed those in instead of garlic salt. Other than that I followed the recipe. I got so many compliments on this recipe!! Thanks for making me look so competent to my friends!!

It is a good recipe, but I think you do not need to add that much artichoke or garlic salt. It ruined the dip..

Very disappointing. followed exactly as recipe stated and very thick and is lacking something...not sure what it is. or maybe the basil is throwing the taste off. Still on the quest to find the TGI friday-like dip.

Loved this!  I used sour cream instead of mayo, cut the cream cheese slightly, and used garlic powder.  I left out the artichoke hearts just b/c I was too lazy to chop them up, but would put them in next time.  I just dumped all the ingredients into my crock pot and cooked on low for 2 hours while we were at Christmas Eve church service.  It just needed to be stirred when I got home and it was perfect with town house crackers.

Five Stars!! This was a BIG hit at Thanksgiving. It was super easy to make, and tasted delicious!!! I also liked the fact that I was able to prepare it in advance, and then pop it in the oven when I was ready. The last couple minutes, I put the broiler on low for that crispy cheese top. I did modify this recipe a little bit, though...I didn't have Parmesan and Romano cheese by themselves, so used the Italian Blend shredded cheese instead. I also used jarred minced garlic instead of a fresh clove, and didn't have any basil so did without. Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

This is fabulous! A bit garlicky and just the right consistency. I may try sour cream as others have suggested but this recipe is just fine the way it is. My family certainly approves!

AWESOME DIP!  I was looking for a recipe because my son always would get this an an appetizer when he went out to dinner.  We were having a 80th birthday party for my husbands Aunt that was here from California.  I tripled the recipe for about 35 people.  My brother-in-law said I should market the dip.  My sister-in-law said that when we have family gatherings not even to ask what I could bring just bring this dip. Gave the recipe to my sister in Virginia that she made for a neighborhood picnic.  She said she went out to try it and the whole thing was gone.  Made no modifications to this recipe followed it as written.  You won't be disappointed. Thanks for the recipe Tiffany!

Overall, I liked this recipe.  I made it exactly as directed.  It wasn't bad, but it was very slightly gritty, because of the cheeses used.  I like mine a little creamier.  Next time, I might try double the cream cheese and using a tad more spinach.  I also might try the worcestershire sauce in place of the seasonings, as other reviewers suggested.  Definitely a good start, though!

Excellent. I used reduced fat cream cheese, light Miracle Whip, double the mozzarella cheese, and more garlic. Even my kids loved it-and they are picky if it doesn't look like the "restaurant".

This dip was really great! I didn't have dried basil on hand so I used fresh....I think it was a little over powering so next time I'm going to try the dip without adding basil. I also used some healthier options, low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream (used the sour cream as some other reviewers suggested) and a tablespoon of low fat mayo. Thanks for the great recipe!

very good!   i thought it was very yummy!  i was a little nervous, but it's a keeper.  i had doubled the recipe for a party & wanted to make it ahead, so i mixed together all of the ingredients minus the spinach & artichokes the day before.  i thawed the spinach in the microwave & places it in a small collander over a bowl uncovered in the fridge so it could continue to drain overnite & maybe dry out a little.  this worked very well!  it was still  pretty wet when i went to use it but it worked just fine. ( i also used as someone else suggested 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo, no salt at all-replaces with a dash of garlic powder, added 1/2 cup moz. cheese into the mixture & another 1/2 on top and i only used 1 1/2 cans artichokes).  the day of the party all i had to do was fold in the spinach & artichokes & top with moz. & bake.  i baked it for 30-35 mins. since i had doubled the recipe, was perfect!  give it a try!  i served it w/tortilla scooping chips!

I have made this several times and it is asked for time and time again! Just a few changes as suggested by other people - Usually use whipped cream cheese; 1/8 cup mayo and 1/8 cup sour cream instead of all mayo; I always use creamed spinach instead of plain chopped; and I seem to end up adding more garlic (Love Garlic Garlic by Tastefully Simple!) :) I have made it in the crock pot, and baked - both are great!

I can't make enough of this! I have doubled and tripled the recipe and still there is never enough. The ingredients are perfect and blend well together. I made it in the crock pot not the oven and it works just fine although it may take a little longer for the cream cheese to melt. I was getting frustrated trying to find an artichoke dip that I could make at home that would equal what we can get when eating out.  I'm so glad I tried one more time. This is by far the BEST Artichoke Spinach Dip EVER! Thank you!

This is a favorite in our house and it always gets rave reviews when we make it for others.  I don't always have the romano cheese so I just substitute extra parmesan cheese.  This is even good with the cheap grated parmesan - no need to splurge on the expensive kind.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it!  They said its better than a restaurant!  I substituted sour cream for the mayo and mixed the mozzarella into the mixture instead of on top.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!

Very, very delicious! Took other reviewers suggestions to use sour cream instead of mayo and used fresh mozzarella. Mixed some of the mozzarella in with the mixture and sprinkled a little on top. Was a huge hit and something I will definitely make again.

This recipe is perfect AS IS.  The first time I made it, I made some modifications that I won't mention because they didn't add to the YUM factor.  This time I did everything as written (except I do it in the crock pot) and it was fantastic!  A keeper, for sure.

I followed some advice of others: used sour cream instead of mayo, added 1/8tsp cayenne, and mixed all the cheese together. I did use the basil plus 2 minced garlic cloves, and used about 1 cup fresh spinach chopped, a bar of the reduced fat cream cheese, and buttered the 8x8 glass baking dish before putting dip into it. I let the cream cheese come to room temp before mixing and it mixed just fine. Used 1/2 cup shredded Italian cheese instead of 1/4 cup parm. + 1/4 cup mozz. Lastly, I sprinkled a pinch or two of the Italian cheese on top before putting it in the oven. Pretty tasty! Definitely party worthy.

This is my go-to recipe for parties and potlucks. Everyone loves it and it always disappears quickly. I have tried many spinach/artichoke recipes and I feel that this is the best. A couple recommendations--make sure you remember to defrost the spinach ahead of time. This makes it easier to drain and work with. I have also tried putting in some fresh chopped spinach, which gives an interesting texture. I also like cooking and serving it in a pyrex pie plate--it makes it just the right depth for scooping! yummy served with frito scoops or torn up pumpernickel bread.

everyone raves when I make this!! I'm a college student and buying all the cheeses can be a bit pricey so what I usually do is get the Kraft parmesean/romano cheese blends in a shaker, they're cheaper than buying the cheese by the lb, and it tatse great too! love love love this recipe!

I made this for game night and an office party and it was a total success!  Everyone raved about how great the dip was.  Then, about a week later one of co-workers told me that she went out to dinner, ordered the spinach artichoke dip, and said it didn't compare to the one I made. It beat restaurant style dip!

This recipe turned out very good!  I did it kind of differently though.  I mixed the artichokes, cream cheese, parmesean, and romano cheses into a food processor until very well mixed. Then I mixed in the shredded spinach leaves.  I found it easier to dip when it was less chunky!  I also added 3 cloves of garlic (I love garlic).

The changes I made: I used 1/8 c. sour cream and 1/8 c. mayo. I  used 1/2 c. Parmesan rather than Parmesan and Romano. I also used a hand blender to thoroughly chop the spinach, and I mixed the mozarella in with the other cheeses as well as putting a little on top. It came out absolutely delicious! I served it with toasted pita bread which worked well.

My whole family loves this dip. The amount of spinach is perfect. I've always thought the usual addition of 10 ounces of frozen spinach in other recipes was too much and tended to dry out the dish. This is a keeper for my crew!

If im going to attend a party, everyone says I can't come through the door without this! I follow the recipe exactly except for I use sour cream instead of mayo, and a little extra minced garlic. Kids usually don't like this. I serve it with lime flavored tortilla chips, and french baguettes that are toasted and sliced.

This was so awesome!!  I did mix the mozzerella in instead of putting it on top.  However I think I should have put some on top to let the dip brown.  As it was it did not get brown on top at all.  That did not change the taste, it still was yummy.

I made it just like the recipe, cut out a round loaf of bread and scooped the dip inside after it was done cooking.  It looked wonderful and turned out great!

This is really, really good. I took the advice of other reviewers and used sour cream instead of the mayo and used 2 garlic cloves. I baked a loaf of french bread, thinly sliced it, and baked it. After about 10 min., I brushed the bread slices with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt and baked for another 10-12 minutes. I served the artichoke and spinach dip with the bread, hot from the oven and it was gobbled up in no time flat!

I've made this recipe several times now and it always gets rave reviews. I use more spinach (a 10 oz package of frozen, thawed)and more garlic instead of the garlic salt. It's great with crackers or  thin slices of french bread .

This is a great recipe, even if you don't use expensive cheeses found in delis. I subbed sour cream for mayo, lengthened the cook time by 10 minutes and made a double batch for a group of 30 people, putting it all in a 9x13 inch pyrex dish. It turned out beautiful and there were lots of compliments. About three quarters was eaten, but that's ok because the leftovers were delicious too! Thanks for a great recipe.

So yummy!!  I also used sour cream instead of mayo.  I stir the all of the cheese into the mixture instead of having a layer on top because it became a barrier to the dip beneath once it started to harden

Spinach Artichoke Dip has to be my favorite of the dips. I've been looking for a recipe that could become "my" recipe -- one that I would use again and again. In trying to do this, I've used several recipes on this site, and some that are not on this site, but I really do think that I've found it in this one, with some, minor changes to the recipe (thus giving it 4 stars instead of five).

I read through the comments and noticed that quite a few people used a quarter cup of sour cream instead of mayo in the recipe. I've made this twice -- once with full fat sour cream and once with Hellman's Light Mayonnaise and I honestly didn't taste a difference. I'll probably wind up using whatever I happen to have on hand in the mayo/sour cream department next time I make the recipe.

What I did do was I put an entire bag (4 cups?) of mozzarella in (primarly because I use a large baking dish for the recipe and it filled up better that way). 

The end result was delicious, and it was incredibly easy to make. I've also found that it reheats well.

This is my go-to recipe when I need to bring an appetizer to a party.  Super easy and SO good!  Better than what you would get at restaurants!

I am known as a ShortCutCook, and I ALWAYS substitute canned spinach for the fresh or frozen.  The recipe is very forgiving; you can use mayo or sour cream or half of both, dump cheeses in like crazy, and, if short, I also use jarred cheese sauces.  It just makes it creamier.  I also do a garlic overload.  This recipe is so easy and you can customize it continually.

All I have to say is AMAZING!!! I love this dip and like many others, it is definitely better than the kinds in restaurants. I did use sour cream instead of mayo and I omitted the basil. It is very rich and creamy and full of flavor. I made pita chips to dip in it. It doesn't get better than this! For a cheese lover, this is a dream come true! You must try it! Thanks so much for the post!!!

I followed several user suggestions to get this perfect. I used four cloves of garlic and made sure to mix in the mozzarella cheese rather than put it on top. I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mixture too because I used a full (frozen) box of spinach.

The absolute best spinach dip I have ever had.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and mixed the mozzarella throughout.  I added some additional mozzarella on top.  Fantastic!

I made this for my husband and my in-laws last night...They loved it! It is sooo much better than anything you can get in a restaurant! It's really inexpensive to make, too....I have enough cheese to make this a couple more times before the end of the month, and definitely plan to! 
If you follow the recipe it does make a LOT of dip, which would be great for parties. If you plan to serve it as an appetizer though I would scale it down a few servings.
I will be keeping this recipe for a very, very long time.

This dip was DELICIOUS!! I served it at a party and it vanished way too fast and everyone kept asking if there was more.  I used fat free cream cheese and fat free mayo, extra cheese, and fresh spinach (which I microwaved and squeezed dry first).  We served it sliced french bread.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Years later I've switched to reduce fat cream cheese and mayo, and frozen spinach. I also add water chestnuts!

Awesome!  I, like some other reviewers added some finely chopped red peppers and another clove of garlic.  ( we are garlic lovers!).  I also substituted half of the mayo with sour cream and mixed the cheese in w the cream cheese mixture.  It was incredible.

Wow! Just make sure you fully drain the artichokes so that it doesn't get runny or the juices don't separate. This was sooooo good!

I've been making this for years, always tweaking the recipe a little. I thought I would try this version (although I usually add some sour cream and thought it might not be as good without it) for Thanksgiving. 

Made it basically as listed (I am not a fan of measuring, so I just freehand) except I was too lazy to peel/chop the garlic and just used powder. 

I first mashed the can of artichokes in a bowl with the cream cheese and mayo. Then added the cheeses and seasonings (I did leave out the basil and added some "house seasoning" from The Columbia restaurant... our family lives near St. Augustine, FL and uses this seasoning in EVERYTHING) and then the drained spinach. 

Everything got stirred together and put into a mini crockpot. It stayed warm for several hours, and it was FANTASTIC. By far the best spin/art recipe I've ever made, and this will be my standard from now on. 

My mom LOVES this dip, and I had to sneak the leftovers back home (although she did ask me today where they were!!). When reviewing our "top three" dishes of the day last night, this one came up several times! 

Thanks Tiffany!!

FANTASTIC!! I just made this as a prelude to our Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and added a little more salt. I chopped the artichokes pretty fine (we have picky eaters and I wanted to "hide" the chokes so they would eat it). I used freshly shredded parmasan and ramano cheeses. I also added a little bit of grated parmasan on top. It turned out creamy and delicious! People gobbled it up and I was really proud of it. It's a certain keeper in my recipe box. THANKS!

BEST artichoke dip I've ever made. I doubled the batch to a 2-qt. casserole for Thanksgiving and it disppeared in 30 minutes. You can switch out the cheeses too. I used Romano, Parmesan and Asiago and six cloves of garlic, then just regular sea salt. My guests were weak in the knees. Thank you!

PHENOMINAL!!!  This is, by far, the best spin/artichoke dip I have ever tasted, and I get it at restaurants whenever I see it on the menu.  It is rich, creamy and very flavorful.  I was not stingy with the garlic, and added some fresh ground black pepper as well.  I also added about 1/4 cup of sour cream to make it super smooth and creamy.  At the last minute I threw in some of the shredded monteray jack cheese as well (I used that instead of mozzarella), and I think that helped to hold the dip together a little after it was heated.  I also threw in some diced red bell pepper for some color.  I heated it and served it in a large sour dough bread bowl.  It was a hit!!!  I will be making this recipe A LOT more often.  This one's a classic.

I make this dip whenever I have big family dinners! It is so rich and creamy. I usually make it a day before and cook it the next day. Gives me more time to cook, and helps keep my family occupied.

Not sure what I did wrong, I followed this recipe to a T.  but it didn't taste right to me or my guest.  It almost had a "fishy" taste.  Maybe the cheese or spinach wasn't the right type???

This is wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled it) and just melted everything together in a slow cooker on low for 2 hours.  It was delicious!  I'll definitely make this again.  I served with Jewish Rye cocktail bread slices and tortilla chips.

Too dry and not enough flavor for my taste.  Had to add a couple garlic cloves, and make a roux of 2 Tbsp. butter, 2 Tbsp. flour, and 1 cup milk with extra 1/2 c. mozzarella to add to it, otherwise I would have thrown it away.

I used an Italian blend of grated cheeses rather than individually buying the cheeses in the recipe.  I didn't have any room in my oven so I kept it on low in the crockpot for a couple hours and then put it in a serving dish.  This recipe is easy and unbelievably good.  No way to mess this up.

I substituted the mayonnaise for sour cream as suggested by some of the other reviewers and it was awesome. Also, instead of using regular canned artichokes, I used a jar of Harry and David Merlot Laced artichokes. Yum!

I haven't ever had any use for artichokes ever before making this recipe so I am not an expert on them. 

This recipe come together very easily. It's essentially a casserole. Per a previous reviewer I mixed the mozzerella cheese in with everything else and was happy with the result. The taste was good but reminded me of greek food (something I'm not a big fan of). It had a brininess to it. Perhaps this was from the type of artichokes I used. They were Albertson's store brand in a glass jar and smelled strongly.  

My husband loved it though and insisted on taking the leftovers with him to work to share with his buddy. He didn't come home with any leftovers that day

Very good dip- I've had many requests for it.  I use two packages of cream cheese and one entire box of chopped frozen spinach. The extra cream cheese makes it easier to dip into without too much nacho breakage. Stilll very flavorful.

Finally! A spinach/artichoke dip that doesn't rely on preservative-laden onion soup mix cop-outs! This needs no adjusting whatsoever, other than my using three-cheese pre-grated cheese rather than buying all the hard cheese separately. Good job, and great eating!

This deserves more than just 5 stars! It is out-of-this-world delicious!!! I try to lighten it up a bit by using reduced fat mayo and reduced fat cream cheese. But it still tastes rich and sinful anyway! Make this for your next party and watch it disappear! Just be sure to have lots of tortilla chips on hand! It's also great with pumpernickel bread or cocktail rye toasts. THANKS for such a great recipe!!!

This was very good.  It needed something to give it a little more zing, but wasn't sure what.  After reading some of the other reviews, next time I will use sour cream instead of mayo and will add more cayenne pepper.  I may also add a splash of lemon juice and minced onion.

OMG..this stuff is awesome - I am literally munching on some I just made for the first time, on a Club Cracker as it's all I had available.  Tastes great on the cracker by the way.  I made this for my teenager who loves a similar recipe at a nearby restaurant.  This is as good or better if you ask me!  

I did a couple things different...as it was just my preference.  I mixed the mozz in with the entire mixture as someone said it's hard to eat with it all on top..(which I would agree), I also added double the amount of mozz as we love it..didn't come out as too cheezy.  I also omitted the garlic salt (thank goodness as I think it would have been too salty with the Parm/Romano cheeses (which are salty anyway).  Instead of the garlic salt as I love garlic, I added 2 gloves minced - perfect!  

Again..this is yum yum yum...I will be making it for my daughter's graduation party this summer...but in larger amounts!  Enjoy everyone!

Perfect and by far the best dip of its kind I have ever had! Better than any restaurant's recipe! I added extra artichokes, spinach, and cheese to make the dish go further and to be a little chunkier... even better! Great for parties or a meal in itself, especially with plain toasted Italian bread.

YUM!  The only thing I changed was to use 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt.  REALLY tasty.  A hint - you can just break off a handful of spinach from that frozen square.  Just snap it off and freeze the remainder .

I've tried a couple of these and this dish is the ONE.  Fantastic.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Added a clove of minced garlic.  I also followed another reviewer and added sour creme instead of mayo.  I've been looking for a similar recipe to the one that they serve in this restaurant Milestone's (in the Toronto area).  If you are familiar with this restaurant's dip this one is even better!

I took this to a Super Bowl party and it disappeared. Thanks to Summer821, I added the mozzarella during the last 5 minutes of cooking and it did not get too hard during transporting but was still perfectly melted.

This was a good base to start with but I thought it was a little bland after I put it all together.  So I added 2 TBSP. lemon juice and 1 TBSP. Worcestershire and a teaspoon garlic powder.  Letting it sit for a while made a big difference also.  I'll definately make this combo again with my additions.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This stuff is amazing! Cheesy and delicious. It stays together and is very creamy, unlike most warm artichoke dishes. Next time I think I will try adding chopped waterchestnuts for a little crunch. I also think it would be fun to play with the cheese and herb combinations. A greek inspired dip with feta might be fun for the adventurous tastebuds.

best spinach/artichoke dip I have ever had! This recipe is really easy and it tastes wonderful.  I took the advice about mixing the mozz. cheese into the mixture rather than putting it on top and it was a good move.  The cheese on top would have been to hard to put a chip through.  I recommend eating this with the organic blue tortilla chips..mmmm......

Very tasty dip.  I find it very hard to 'mix' softened cream cheese, so I put the cream cheese, mayo and an equal part sour cream in food processor to make it nice and creamy.  Then folded in the rest of ingredients.  Beacause a lot of previous reviews warned of the mozz on top becoming too hard as it cooled, I folded it into the dip.  Also, for color, I sprinkled paprika over top and for texture, sprinkled crushed butter crackers mixed with a little olive oil over top as well.  There wasn't a scoop to left!  All gone!  Presentation is best in a shallow baking dish, if you have one.

I made this for a Superbowl party over the weekend and it received rave reviews.  I even lightened it up by using low fat cream cheese and light Miracle Whip.  I added two cloves of garlic rather than 1 and left out the garlic salt.  The only thing I would do differently would be to mix the mozzarella in next time rather than leave it on top.  As the cheese cools it makes it more difficult to dip.  I served with bagel chips.

Truly delicious. You can make it ahead of time, and rewarm in the microwave (or oven to ensure a crispy, bubbly crust.) I edged the casserole dish with grape tomatoes, which were a great compliment to the rich dip. Sprinkled toasted pine nuts on top.

Although I have 2-3 great spinach-artichoke recipes, I'll always give a new recipe a shot.  Unfortunately, this one is a miss.  Too much cheese, little flavor, will stick with my tried and true ones.

This is truly an awesome recipe and what makes it even better is that it is easy too...I agree with some of the other reviews, mixing in the mozzarella. It does leave a hard top making it hard to dip a chip, unless you use a spoon.  Also used whole grain crackers as a dipper...Everyone loved it and had requests for the recipe!!  Thanks for a keeper!!

This is an awesome recipe! However, I modified just a couple of things because I felt it was a bit too "salty"; I substituted the 1/4 cup romano cheese for 1/4 mozzarella and next time I will use the artichoke hearts packed in water instead of oil (as the oil gives a very strong taste that over powers the rest)

If you're looking for better than resturant quality spinach & artichoke dip this recipe is for you.  I've tried some others but this is the winner!  I get requests on potluck invites to please bring this dip!!  I use fresh spinach (usually one bunch with the stems cut off and then chopped) and steam it before mixing it in.

This was awesome.  As others said it was actually better as it cooled a bit.  I served this with crackers and bought a baguette and cut it into slices.  I also suggest not topping it with mozarella because it forms a hard layer on the top.  I would mix it in next time.  I used fresh basil and extra garlic (as I love garlic).  Would DEFINITELY make this again.  My guests couldn't get enough of this.

Enjoyed this appetizer very much. Very quick and easy to put together. Topped with shredded parmesan instead of mozz. Parm. doesn't get hard as the dish cools. Served this with baked pita chips brushed with olive oil, garlic salt and parmesan. May try marinated artichokes next time for bolder flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

This dip was awesome!  I've made it four times in the last two weeks and we're not tired of it yet.  I tweaked it just a little; I used 1 tsp. crushed garlic for flavor, and added one half cup of sour cream.  Delicious!

My boyfriend loved this but I found it to be slightly on the dry side.  I noticed after the fact that other reviewers found it dry as well.  Take the advice of others and add some cream or something.

I took this dip to a party and cooked it there.  It was a total hit!  Very cheezy and rich with flavour... better than some dips I've had in restaurants!  I served it with tortilla chips rather than bread.  They should be thick tortilla chips so that you can scoop without the chip breaking!

This dip was GREAT!!!  My husband begged me not to use "light" mayo, but i did anyway, and he couldn't even tell!!  I also put the mozzarella in the mixture, as some other people recommended, and it was delicious (i sprinkled a little more on top before baking)!  I don't even like spinach or artichokes, but loved this dip!   I recently doubled the recipe for a dinner party, and it was a big hit!  So creamy and yummy!!!!!

This dip is great. I put in more cheese to make it more chessey. Also after baking it I put on diced tomatoes. My family and friends love this dip.

Very very good. Got rave reviews and was asked to make it again. My 10 year old daughter said "This isn't good; it's delicious! and the best I've ever had" and she would know becuase everytime we go to a resturant she asks for artichoke and spinach dip.

THE FIRST TIME I MADE THIS DIP IT WAS A HUGE HIT!  EVERYONE AT MY HOUSE LOVED IT INCLUDING MY CHILDREN  (5 + 7).  I BOUGHT A PRE-MIXED CHEESE BLEND OF PARMESAN, ROMANO, AND MOZZARELLA AND MIXED IT IN TO THE DISH.  THIS SAVED A LOT OF MONEY!!  GREAT RECIPE!!

This was a wonderful recipe, actually the first I've ever tried from allrecipes!  I varied it a little and used fresh artichoke hearts and fresh spinach, which gave it a very "vegetable-green" color and good flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe as a cheesy, flavorful appetizer (or meal!).

I've tried a few Spinach and Artichoke dips from this site and I've loved them all but this is BY FAR my favorite! Especially if you are looking for the restaurant dip recipe. It is just perfect and delicious! I used lite sour cream instead of mayo and it was PERFECT!! I used a box a spinach versus 1/2 cup and chopped again in my food processor with 2 cloves of garlic adding the cream cheese but I omitted the basil and garlic salt. I stirred in the shredded cheese, it is much better that way than on top! I thought it got gooey if you put it on top. A hard layer and impossible to dip in. I serve with tortilla chips . I mix it all together the day or two before and put it in a glass baking pan in the fridge and then when I'm ready to bake it I throw it in my toaster oven! If you want, add mozzarella and broil for a few minutes at the end. Definitely my favorite hot spinach dip.

Oh my gosh! I made this for the last several family get togethers and every one who tried it couldn't get over how ridiculously good this dip was!!! They kept coming back for more. Some even put it as a side on their dinner plate! I definitely found my go to dip and it's so easy to make. Low in carbs too!! What more can you ask for?

This recipe is the BEST atichoke and spinach dip!! This is definitely a crowd pleaser! And it's so easy to make! 
Side note-when I make this dip I usually make it the night before and then cook it before my event. Since doing this I've noticed that the flavors is even better. Plus it stays together beautiful over night too!

WOW!!  Loved this recipe the first time and even MORE the second! Definitely use sour cream instead of mayo, mix in the mozzarella cheese instead of putting it on top, add a couple dashes if hot sauce (don't worry, it doesn't make it spicy), and microwave it for a 1.5 min BEFORE sticking it in the oven(for 10minutes) so the top doesn't get hard.  Tastes great if you garnish it with diced tomatoes!  I used a loaf of Italian bread for dipping.  Just make slices about 1/3in thick and throw it in the oven at the same time as the spin dip.  They take 10 min too AND are hard enough for dipping!

I have tried this recipe twice - once with whipped cream cheese and another time with the standard cream cheese- and I definitely agree that the whipped cream cheese handles better. I also prefer sour cream as opposed to mayo. This is a keeper!

Great recipe. Maybe You could use  yogurt There many ways you alter this to be able to make using many substitutes. I added pukka sauce ,1-T . I did not have jalapenos. Oooops, forgot the lemon juice!

I thought this recipe was decent. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and didn't have Romano, so I substituted Mozz. cheese mix with the Parm in the dip. Make sure you bake in a smaller baking dish so the dip fills up the dish.  I put mine in a larger one and I believe overcooked it (it was spread too thin).  It came out a little rubbery instead of creamy and soft.

I substituted sour cream for cream cheese, but my husband & I both felt it was a little bland.  I wish I would have followed recipe!

It was pretty good.We used two cloves of garlic and no garlic salt, smoked grated cheese instead and added even more spinach and topped it with some cayenne pepper! Yum!

Made this to take to the family christmas dinner. Everyone liked it. We ended up eating it cold as I had cooked it earlier in the day and didn't get a chance to reheat it. It was still awesome. Cold or hot either way. I did rinse the artichokes extremely well to get the vinegar juice/taste off. Perfect! Will make this again and try it hot. Def a keeper.

This is a hit every time!  Like some other reviewers, I use sour cream instead of mayonnaise, sometimes leave out the basil, and I stir the mozzarella into the mixture before baking, rather than putting it on top.  I do put a little bit of extra parmesan on top prior to baking, perhaps 1/4 cup or so at most, and that works well.  It goes quickly and there is never any left over, so make enough!

This is a decent starting point but needs work. First, ditch the basil, it just tastes odd. You can use a decent Italian seasoning blend but go lightly, or just use marinated artichoke hearts and drain really well. Second, no garlic salt, just use fresh chopped garlic, and pump it up to about 3 cloves worth. Saute the garlic plus about 2Tbsp shallots in a good, dry white wine until very soft. Yes, it needs to be wine. The alcohol will burn off for the paranoid out there, but the flavor will remain.  Next, dump all the cheese except a sprinkling of the Parmesan into the pan with the shallots and garlic and let it all melt together (very low heat please) and combine. It is REALLY thick so I use both mayo AND sour cream to loosen it up. 1/4c each, add the green stuff next and stir to incorporate and THEN dump it into your baking dish. sprinkle with the little bit of Parmesan you kept back and bake till bubbly. If you're into that sort of thing you can add stuff to this base also. I like some sliced black olives sometimes, or a bit of diced roasted red pepper. I've even added lump crab meat and crawfish tails a few times. Granted, it's not really "spinach artichoke dip" if you do that, but it still tastes yummy!

YUM!!! I've made this 4 or 5 times now and my kids and I love it to death! The last couple of times I added a little bit of sour cream to it and it gives it a creamier texture. Soooo good with tortilla strips or sour dough!

This recipe was great, although if there is one thing that I would change is the salt content. I found it to be a little on the salty side. Other than that, great recipe!

Delicious! I used a 6oz jar of artichoke hearts, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 cup of frozen spinach and added the mozzarella on top. This recipe is spot on! Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe and thought that it was only OK. My guest didn't comment on it all. I though it was rather ... flat .. or bland. It needed more of a bite. sour cream, instead of mayo, would probably be better as the other reviewers commented, but I would also try another recipe with no cream cheese.

Good stuff! Tweaked this recipe a bit. I only had a 7.5 jar of artichokes, & it seemed to do the trick. Omitted the mayo for sour cream. Bumped the garlic up to 2 cloves, & roasted them over the flame on my stove with the peelings. (removed them after) I used fresh spinach, & made it 3/4 of a cup. Cut stems off and sliced the spinach leaves into ribbon strips. Mozzarella got bumped up to 1/3rd of a cup, & most of the cheese was mixed in like others recommended. I saved a little bit for a loosely sprinkled layer to cover the top, but made sure there was spacing between the shreds of cheese. Chip accessible, yet covered. Served it with warmed in the oven tortilla rounds. It was only 3 of us, and we cleaned the bowl! :d...

Best spinach and Artichoke dip recipe Ive found to date This is fairly easy. The hardest part is gathering all the ingredients .  Its  absoluely tworth the trouble for sure. Its so awesome even spinach haters love it, just tell them the green stuff is parsley  or something else, This is one of those, all to rare recipes that don't need to be  tweeked. If your making this for 4 or more people, you will wish you doubled the recipe. Don't serve it to hungry peeps just before dinner, they won't be able to stop eating it. I seve with either Ritz , HiHo, or Club House crackers.  But am sure it would be awesome even on tree bark!!!    
NOTE: Further down the recipe it talks about sour cream, Ive made this recipe several times, todayis the first time we are going to substitute half the mayo with sour cream. In the back of my mind I am thinking " don't mess with a good thing" My curiosity  always wins over my commonsense.  Also I have no fresh garlic, I'm substituting the one clove of fresh garlic with 1/4 tsp. Garlic powder, and the all the grated cheese called for with:  "Lacotelli grated cheese "( "pecorino romano"),  I add the mozzarella  during the last few minutes of baking. I will update if any of these changes,  change  the recipe's awesomeness.

Really good dip. I did as some of the other reviews suggested and used sour cream and omitted the mayo. I also used more spinach (3/4 cup) and less artichokes (6 ounce jar), and I'm glad I did or else there would have been too many artichokes for my liking. I also use more garlic (3 cloves)as some reviews suggest and the garlic flavor was too much. Next time I will stick to the 1 clove called for in the recipe.

This is my first time trying to make a spinach and artichoke dip and it was super EASY to make. My husband loves hot spinach and artichoke dip with pita chips so I decided to make it for him for Christmas. He LOVED it!!! I did substitute the mayo for sour cream cuz of the calories, and fresh basil, it came out great!!!his friends that came over for Christmas dinner couldn't get enough!!! I am definitely making this appetizer again!!!

I make this for parties all the time and it is a huge hit! I always do it in the crock pot, which is nice because I can throw everything in ahead of time ( even the night before) and then turn it on before the party. Perfect! If I'm not makin this, I may as well not throw a party!

I made this for a work Christmas party and it was a HUGE hit!  I doubled the recipe due to the amount of people at the party and I also did some more tweaks.  I used 2 8oz containers of non dairy cream cheese (lactose intolerant), 1/4 cup mayo, 1/2 cup non dairy sour cream, 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, 4 large cloves garlic, no garlic salt, 1 full 10oz box frozen chopped spinach, and 1 full cup shredded mozzarella cheese.  I cooked it in my crockpot on high for 2 hours and kept on warm for the party.  It was gobbled up and raved over....the recipe was asked for by multiple people.  I will definitely make this one over and over!

I LOVE this recipe!! I only tweaked it a little, sorry but we do not like the Romano cheese so I left it out and I used the whole container of spinach and used more mozzarella. It turned out GREAT everyone that has tasted it loves it they say it taste like the restaurant style, but better. We make it all the time now thank you sooo much.

Too much garlic. If your not a big garlic fan then i reccomend not using the garlic. Next time i make this im going to use water chestnuts too. I think it would be yummy.

This is my new favorite spinach dip recipe. I substituted all parmesan for the parmesan romano blend, and topped the finished dish with pico de gallo. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this sooo many times, and each time, someone asks me for the recipe. It is absolutely delicious!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe! I only made a couple changes (reduced the artichoke, added more garlic, and a couple others).

So I wanted to make spinach and artichoke alfredo but wanted something a bit creamier. What I ended up doing was getting four cheese ravioli (frozen) and boiled it until half done. Lightly sprayed a casserole dish, and put them in a single layer. Put the dip on top and baked it according to instructions... Rich as all get out but AMAZING! The whole family LOVED it! Definitely making it again!

Amazing, amazing, amazing!! I've had this recipe for years and I make it at least once a month.  Its the most requested dish at family and friend gatherings. Just for kicks I add a sprinkle of old cheddar cheese on top with the mozzarella but with or without this can't be beat. Did I mention this dip is amazing?

easy and delicious! i used 1/2 c mayo, 1/2 c romano cheese, dash of garlic powder in place of garlic salt. i also used 8 oz of mozzarella and mixed some into the dip and sprinkled the rest over the top. i used a small square glass pan and it took about 40 mins for the cheese to brown on top. served with crackers. very tasty!

This turned out really good for my first time making this kind of dip. I decided to substitute a Kraft Italian cheese blend (pizza mozzarella, parmesan, provolone and emmental) because the grocery store did not have romano...it worked out very well. I also took other reviewers advice to chop the artichokes very small so they didn't stand  out too much, and also substituted sour cream for mayo. I also wouldn't top the dip with cheese before baking since it does create a hard annoying surface to dip through. Used melba toast, triscuit, and multi-grain Breton rounds (my favorite) for crackers. Would definitely make again!

Delicious! I have tried this exactly as written, other than using fresh spinach, fresh basil, and more garlic (2 cloves) in lieu of the garlic salt, and I have tried it with minor variations (cilantro).  It's a great recipe either way, and it's quick and easy to make.

This recipe is delicious!  All of my friends love it and it's always the first thing to go.  My changes: I use only fresh grated mozzarella and no romano at all, I also don't don't top the mixture with mozz before baking, just mix it all together.  I add extra freshly minced garlic and use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Bake as instructed and serve with tortilla chips.  So bomb!

Yum!  As others suggested, I used sour cream instead of mayo because I *hate* mayonnaise.  I also had to substitute a round of Babybel for the mozzarella because I didn't have any.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I served it with crostini.  Delicious, delicious.  The only bad part was that I didn't get to eat any leftovers because it disappeared at the dinner party I made it for!

Loved it. Had to sub ricotta cheese fat free for 1/2 of cream cheese pkg. and had to up to 1 cup Parmesan since did not have Romano. Also used fresh spinach. Had to use combination of cheddar and mozzarella as it was on hand. Results superb.

This is the best! I've made it numerous times for all sorts of occasions and it's always the first to go, even when doubling the recipe! I don't change a thing about the recipe. I keep it ooey gooey hot in a mini crock pot and serve it with crostinis. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Very tasty. It is a tad bit chunky, I wonder if you could blend the mixture and then put it in the casserole dish. Otherwise great! I used neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese, doubled the parmesan (no Romano), and garlic powder instead of cloves.

This dip is amazing! I did make a few changes also. I used sour cream as others had suggested and used more mozarella cheese. This is my new favorite recipe!!!!!!! Everyone loves it when i make it!

I have to say this was awesome!I didn't have mozzarella, so I substituted Monterrey Jack cheese. I served to a group of friends and they loved it.

You'll want to swim in the heaven that is this dish!  Best right out of the oven, but good even microwaved the next day (the crust is just not the same however) when I had to take it to a work function.  Served it with both tortilla and pita chips.  I could not find reasonably priced Romano, so I just split the difference between the Parm & Mozzarella and upped those.  This will be a party go to for years to come!

Came out very salty and cream cheese was the main taste in it. I will make again with less cream cheese and more spinach.

I made this for a new years party and it was a hit.  I made the following changes:  Added 1/4 c sour cream, a dash of chili powder and cayenne.  I also used fresh spinach and chopped that up with the artichokes in my mini chopper.  I also mixed in the mozzarella as per the other reviews.

I made this for my new years party and it went over fantastically. I kinda regret not doubling it because it was gone so quickly. I made a couple of small changes. I didn't use garlic salt and I put the mozzarella cheese in the mix. I sprinkled a little extra mozzarella over the top to brown. This recipe is definitely going in my recipe box for future use.

The taste was good but I too thought the consistency was a little off.  I was hoping for a creamier dip. I did everything called for except for the quarter of a cup of mayo I made it half and half (sour cream & Mayo) but that was the only difference so that would not have changed the consistency.  I have had a creamier artichoke & spinach dip before and my husband and I like it creamier.

I loved this dip! I doubled it and it was gone by the end of the night at my new year's eve party and it wasn't even a large crowd. I thought the consistency was a little off, but it might have been something I did. Anyways, I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this!  Replaced the mayo with sour cream and did everything else as the recipe states.  Delicious and a huge hit with guests!  Perfect in a mini crock pot to keep it warm too.

I have made this twice! Both times for large groups. It's gone in a few minutes. Changes: I purée the artichokes (I don't like the chunks) and I use KRAFT Italiano cheese in an on top. Very good Tiffany, thanks!

Awesome Dip. Everyone loves it and one of my signature recipes for party's etc.  My friend made it over 10 years ago and got sick of asking for the recipe after loosing it.  This is the recipe closest to that first dip that i fell in love with.  Now make it on special occasions so I don't feel so guilty eating it.

I haven't met a single person who hasn't LOVED this. I bring it to nearly every get-together because it's so yummy, cheap and easy to make! People always ask for the recipe, and often can't believe that something they "hate" is in there (mayo, artichoke, spinach etc.) Once I found this recipe I couldn't bring myself to order this at a restaurant - why do so when I can make a MUCH yummier, and much cheaper version at home? I would recommend doubling the recipe - believe me, it goes fast! Serve with anything from fancy crackers, pita or tortilla chips, or veggies (carrots, celery etc).

Even my picky Dutch husband enjoyed this dip. Only two changes made, fresh garlic as I love the stuff and no mayo as I find the mayo's abroad to differnt from what we have back home in the states. Still very tasty.

I added 1/2 the may and 1/2 sour cream. The other changes I made were to add extra cheddar cheese (our family loves cheese).  This is fabulous and I will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best recipe that I have found.  It is cheesy and delicous.  I make it with and without the artichokes, it's good either way. GREAT!!!!

I've now made this 4 years in a row. I only make it for Thanksgiving as my appetizer. For 11 months out of the year I have people asking me for this dish. 

This is a great recipe. I usually double it because I rarely have enough. 

Suggestions to take it to the next level, I have begun to add grilled chicken breast which I cube and toss into the mix. It adds some more heartiness to the dish but without the chicken its amazing too.

Delicious!  Next time I'll do a little less of the artichokes though, as it seemed like more artichoke than dip.

I have made my artichoke dip this same way for years. I pretty much follow the directions, but i do mix the shredded cheese in with it, but then just top it with a light dusting of it. I also chop green onions and tomatoes and throw it on top for the last few minutes. Always a crowd pleaser. I serve with baguette and/or tortilla chips

Tasty! I added more Parmesan since I didn't have any Romano cheese. I used fresh spinach, and more then it calls for. I also mixed the mozzarella into the dip before heating in the oven. I served it with warm Flatbread (pita bread). Next time I will add more Phili ... mine turned out alittle thick since i added more spinach. Oh ... I also added some chili paste to give it some pep!

This recipe is amazing! I changed it up a little. I did sour cream instead of mayo, and I put Feta cheese on top along with the Mozzarella. This is a real crowd pleaser, and an easy fix! I can't wait to make it again!
God Bless:)

I did as others suggested and used sour cream instead of mayo. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was good, my only complaint being that it was too thick. Next time, I would make the recipe the same way, but add a few tablespoons of milk to the mixture to see if that thins it out a bit. Otherwise, the flavor is wonderful!

10 stars and everyone loved it!!! Used low fat cream cheese and mayo, 2 large cloves of garlic minced, garlic powder instead of salt and omitted any other salt to taste because I think the grated cheeses are salty enough. I also used a full (10 oz) frozen pk of spinach. Served with tortilla chips. A winner!

Thanks for a great recipe. I served this at a baby shower this weekend and it was delicious! Followed the recipe pretty closely, but didn't have Romano cheese so doubled the Parmesan. It was pretty thick, even when warm, so I might add extra mayo or some sour cream next time.  Otherwise, this was very good.  Thanks again!

I have no  words to describe how good this is. i can tell you that my very Italian family that generally only sticks to very authentic Italian food enjoyed it very much. Substituted mayo wih sour ream and used fresh baby spinach insead of frozen.

Wow! This is soooooo good and I make it almost every Sunday night! Sometimes I don't have artichoke so I just skip it and this dip still tastes super. I tried using sour cream as well as mayo and they both taste great although I like it with low fat sour cream as a healthy choice! We eat this with sour dough bread chips, totilla chips, crackers or bagels...All are great!

Incredible and incredibly easy to make!  We've made it several times now.  I've taken it to parties and it is always a hit.  I've shared this recipe on Facebook and it has gotten rave reviews.  We're making it tonight to watch Butler in the Final Four!

Chloe's Father doesn't like most of the ingredients in the recipe but raved about it for days.  My company raved about it and it got MY mom's two thumbs up.  Excellent recipe, Tiffany!

Mmm Mmm Mmmmm, this was delicious. I subbed sour cream for the mayo since I don't like the mayo taste and tossed some shredded Italian blend cheese in with the mix. I think I used more than 1/4 c mozzarella on top, I didn't measure, just covered it til it looked scrumptious. I used fresh spinach, all I did to it was wash, dry, chop, and sprinkled lightly with garlic salt and pop into the microwave for 30 sec to wilt it a little. Great dip, this made my family happy. Thanks!

I made this to take to my granddaughter's birthday party. Doubled the Parm as I had no Romano and left out the garlic salt. Served it with pita chips. It was gone in a flash! My son asked for the recipe (and he's a much better cook than his mother). Thanks for another winning recipe.

Amazing! I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise as many suggested. I substituted fat free items where I could and you couldn't tell. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a glass pie dish for 1 hour. I didn't double the artichokes as I feel that would have been too much. So delicious!

This wasn't as great as I expected it to be. The spinach taste was still overpowering and my family did not enjoy it. Perhaps next time I will use less spinach or substitute with kale. That is, if I decide to try this again...

Amazing!! If you don't like artichokes, trust me you can't taste it. The flavor of the cheeses mixed with the garlic and basil makes it so flavorfull. I changed a couple things that you might like it even more. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also switched the mayo for sour cream. Less calories and makes it have more of a creamy flavor. Great for entertaining! : )

This was really good! The only thing I changed was upped the garlic to 2 cloves and used 1/8 c. sour cream & 1/8 c. mayo. I served it with tortilla chips.

This dip came out sooo good. There is one restaruant that has my favorite spinach dip and this came out just like it, I was so excited. Didn't use the artichokes because I don't like them. Also didn't have Ramano cheese. Added about 1/4 cup of milk to make it more creamy. I will deafinately be making this over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was skeptical because I have made other spinach dips that I thought would be great and were total flops, I thought this recipe would go that way too.  I was wrong.  This recipe looked and tasted restaurant quality.  I served it with baguette bread and it was delicious.  The only changed I made, because of how expensive romano cheese is, is I used a ramano/parmesan blend out of a shaker and did a 1/2 cup of it as opposed to a 1/4 cup of each of them.  Also I followed other recommendations and just added the mozzarella right in with it before it cooked.  Because I used cheese out of a shaker, it didn't all combine into a very spreadable dip, it was a little clumpy, but it was so delicious nobody cared.

I made this for a party but changed some things.  I didn't use mayonnaise at all.  Instead of using all the cheeses, I used Italian shredded cheese and mixed it all together so the cheese wasn't just sitting on top.  Everyone ate this up and it was gone in 10 minutes!

This was absolutely amazing.  I saw that most of the worst reviews said it was too thick so I did half cream cheese and half sour cream to make it creamier.  If you are making for a party of 15 or more, I would triple or quadruple the recipe as the single recipe just doesn't go very far.  Overall.....PHENOMENAL!!!

Amazing!  This is better than any artichoke dip I've had in a restaurant.  Perfect with some toasted sourdough drizzled with olive oil.  I made a few changes and followed other's recommendations.  I skipped the mayo and used sour cream, upped the cheese to about 1/3 cup.  I didn't have any romano so I substituted more parmesan.  I didn't have any mozzarella but had a delicious Spanish cow's milk chees which worked wonderfully.  I mixed in all the cheese rather than a layer on top.  Also, I used 5 oz. of fresh, wilted spinach drained, much better than frozen. We are garlic lovers, so I used 3 cloves of garlic. If your guests don't love garlic, I would stick to the recommended amount or perhaps 2 cloves.  My husband loved this dip! I think it would be great with a bit of hot peppers as well to kick it up a notch!

This was wonderful. And I don't even particularly care for artichokes.  I used sour cream instead of Mayo per other reviews, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, left out the basil and Romano (didn't have any), used about a cup of spinach and mixed the mozzarella right into the dip mixture before baking.  We ate this with tortilla chips - next time I will definitely make a bread bowl out of some artisan bread. Yum.

**ADD ALFREDO SAUCE** that's it! It's an excellent recipe, As-Is but a 1/4C Alfredo Sauce (warmed for blendability) will give the base a little boost and blend well with the basil & garlic.  **For Extra Presentation: Add a handful of fresh Diced Red Pepper and mix in!  Happy Dipping :)

This was good! We couldn't find artichoke hearts in water, so used jarred ones that were marinated (in an italian sort of liquid) and then tried to rinse some of it out. I also didn't use romano cheese, since I couldn't find that here either...just used extra mozzarella. Served with toasted slices from a French baguette. I'm not big on artichokes or mayo, but I'd make it again for a celebration or big get together. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome Dip!! Made for all my holiday parties and the bowls went home empty. I do like a cheesy dip so added a little more than called for, a bit less spinach, and added some chopped red bell pepper for some color and taste/texture variety. Will continue making for a very long time. Thanks for sharing!!!

I would like to rate this 4 1/2 stars. This was very good but I was really hoping for something closer to a certain chain restaurant's dip. I followed exactly but used fresh artichoke hearts. This was VERY heavy and filling.

Very, very good! It was a big hit on Thanksgiving. I added only 1/2 the cream cheese and used some extra mozzarella instead.

Used this as a base recipe and it was fabulous! Used sour cream instead of mayo, as suggested by others. Added some cayenne and used marinated artichoke hearts. Didn't measure out my cheeses so I'm sure I used more than the recipe called for and mixed in the mozzarella as well as sprinkled it on top. Love this recipe because it gives you room to tweak it without going so far off the original. Thank you! :)

This is one of my favourite things to order in a restaurant and I was hoping this would be the same.  If I make this again I will try sour cream instead of mayo like suggested.

I made this for my graduation party. I used pickled artichoke hearts because we had a lot of those, but it still turned out awesome. Everyone was digging in to it and the leftovers were gone in a day.

I LOVED this!  It makes quite a bit and is better 2 or 3 days down the road.  I made no changes in recipe but I did mix everything together in the food processor.  It made everything a consistent size which made for easier spreading on crackers!

Love this recipe!  I've made it 4 times already and everyone always raves about it.  The 1st few times I followed the recipe exactly, the last two, I added 1 tablespoon of sour cream to add a little more of a smoother texture.  I doubled the amount of mozzarella cheese it calls for.  I also serve it with a side of sour cream and salsa.  Gives it a little zing!  Very simple and easy to make.

OH MY GOSH!!!!!!  I hate artichokes, spinach, parm and romano cheese. As you can tell I am a picky eater. My Daughter (whom also is picky) made this as part of my Mother's Day Dinner. Told her I did not like the items in it, and she said "Mother try it, you will LOVE it! She was right and could not get enough of it. Even the Grandkids LOVE it and eat it...that should tell you something. Gonna make it for Memorial Day Picnic and take a warming tray to keep it hot and fresh!!

I followed the recipe to a T, only I subbed ff mayo and ff cream cheese, and guess that might have been my problem. Next time I'll double the cheese, as someone else suggested and use sour cream instead of mayo. I definitely won't be using ff. I love spinach and artichoke dip enough to try it again.

Yum! I have made this 3 or 4 times now, and it is delicious. Everyone always loves it. I have yet to to be able to find Romano cheese, but that might just be me or where I live. Does anyone know? It would be nice to try it. I usually just use extra parmesan and mozzerella (I put the mozzarella into the dip, not on top). I've tried making this with fresh and frozen spinach, and both are equally good. Thanks so much for a recipe that I will use over and over!

This was really good! I did make some changes, so part of me feels like I shouldn't review it, but I did like the basic recipe. I subbed sour cream and stirred in the mozzarella like others suggested. I also left out the basil and added some cayenne pepper along with using fresh spinach instead of frozen. I will definitely continue playing with this one-still needs a little extra something but it's a great place to start!

I've been making this recipe, just a litte diffently.  I use a handful of fresh baby spinach, chopped and sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.  I chop my spinach and artichokes in my Tupperware chopper and that has made this so fun to make.  We think this beats anything we've ever had in a restaurant.  People seem to think I am a good cook when I make this!!!!

Was a big hit at the Super Bowl party!  I doubled the recipe for the crowd and added a tsp of minced garlic.  Next time I'd like to try with 1 tsp minced garlic and half mayo & half Miracle Whip, just to add a lil "kick" to it.  Very good recipe!  The GRATED (not KRAFT powered) cheeses made a difference!  Will make again.

This was exceptional.  I'm sure there are ways to make this 'lite' or even fat free, but why would you want to do that?!  Because it's so incredibly rich, this is definitely a 'make once a year for the holidays' splurge....enjoy it for what it is, then start your new year's resolutions AFTERWARDS.

This recipe tastes great.  I made no modifications and even used fat free cream cheese and fat free mayo for a lower calorie version and the taste was still great.

YUM! Didn't have Romano so I omitted it and then accidentally left out the mozzarella -- didn't miss either one.   **Tip**  Defrost frozen spinach in the microwave, wring out the excess liquid over the sink using a clean, thin kitchen towel or cheesecloth.  Makes the chopping much easier.  I used 1 heaping cup frozen spinach and it reduced to exactly 1/2 cup.

Easy and great... nothing to it at all. If you need to impress a girl's mom, this is what you bring to their house. 15 min prep max, 15 dollars worth of ingredients tops.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was okay. I don't understand why the description says that you wouldn't even taste the artichokes because when I was through with it, we had probably twice as much artichokes as spinach. I tried following the recipe but since I was having guests over, I had to change some things. I added in some extra spinach.. and it was a bit dry so I also put in some alfredo sauce.

Great recipe! A tiny bit too salty, so I might substitute Garlic Powder for the Garlic Salt. Other wise, it was awesome! I will be making it again! It tastes really good with tortilla chips too!

Good but not the best I've had. Not sure what was off... seemed that there could be more spice or salt or something... also seemed to be a lot of artichokes in proportion to cream cheese and spinach. All in all worth a try but I think I'll keep looking or tweaking this.

This was delicious! As someone else suggested, I mixed the mozzarella into the dip rather than melting on top so that it was easier to dip. I also had to add a little extra mayo because I neglected to compensate for the saltiness of the paremesan and romano cheeses, and it needed a little more bulk to make it less salty. It ended up being perfect!

I made this for new years and it was a huge hit. It goes fast so you may want to double it. I kept it in a mini crockpot so it stayed hot all night. Modified according to other reviewers, added more spinach, served with bagel chips and tortilla chips.

Tiffany, you should put a warning on this dip that after making that if it doesn't go immediately to the table it will get devoured in the kitchen!  This is an excellent recipe and thanks for sharing.  Seriously, it needs a warning not to even taste it before you serve it!  It has incredible taste and the aroma is so yummy!

Best artichoke dip recipe I've tried on this site. My friend is allergic to basil so I replaced it w/oregano and it worked just fine. And instead of the romano cheese, I added more parmesan. Turning the broiler on for a couple of minutes after the cooking time browns the top very nicely. Enjoy!

This was very good (one of the best I have had).  I doubled the parmesan since I didn't have Romano.  I also added about 1/2 cup of mozzarella to the dip mixture itself with the other cheeses and topped with the 1/4 cup mozzarella.  Mine was not dry, it turned out creamy.  I think the quality of ingredients do make a difference so use premium artichokes and cheeses. I would recommend using as mall clove of garlic, I used a large clove and it was garlicky.

This was wonderful.  I had read the previous reviews and worried it would be bland so I added a finely chopped shallot, hot sauce, and a heaping spoonful of sour cream to the recipe.  It was outstanding!

I was a bit disapointed in the flavor.  Served it to friends and the consensus was that it was very bland.  If I made it again, I would have to add LOTS more seasoning.

Delicious dip! I really could eat this with a spoon, well, actually I did have a few spoonfuls. I made as written except I didn't realize I didn't have any mozzarella, so I had to top this with sharp provolone, which worked just fine. Next time I will be sure to use the mozzarella though. This is the closest I have had to what's served in a restaurant. I served this with tortilla chips and garnished with diced roasted red peppers. They really complimented the flavors in the dip very well. I will use this recipe often, thanks for sharing :)

This is the real deal! Look no further.  So fresh it is better than restaurant dip! Great served with tortilla chips but even better served with Rosemary and Olive Oil Triscuits!!!

So Good! Great recipe. I used other reviewers suggestions and used sour cream instead of mayo, also added the mozz to the mixture! Doubled for a party.

I have made this twice, both times, I used sour cream instead of mayonaise, both times I made a double batch.  The 1st time, it came out good, but too thick. The 2nd time, I added about 1/4 cup more sour cream and the consistency came out much better! All in all, this is a wonderful recipe!!

This was so easy to make and was a hit at the party.  I was worried that it seemed a little too thick before I baked it, but it was a crowd pleaser for sure.

OMG!  This is a favorite at my house.  I make it exactly like the recipe calls, except I add a bit of extra garlic. If you have a hard time finding the right cheeses you can try any of these: italian cheese blend, mozarella, and parmesan.  The wal-mart I shop at never has a good selection of cheese, and I usually end up with a variation of those three.  YUMMY, YUMMY! Watch out, because you can easily eat this in one sitting!

Delicious!! This dip went the fastest out of all the appetisers I offered at my recent party. The only change I made was to use sharp cheddar cheese in place of the mozzarella.

Dip was excellent!  I made a few changes... sour cream instead of mayo, and a small amount of finely diced onion instead of onion flakes.  I also added a little extra cheese on top and broiled it the last few minutes to brown nicely.  It was gobbled up at a football party last night! I gave it a four just because I made so many changes...

This is a great recipe, hands down one of the best Spinach Artichoke dips I ever ate. I made some adjustments along the way: I used mayo and sour cream (about a cup and a quarter of the combo...more mayo than sour cream), extra cheese within the recipe (I only added a little bit on top), I used a heavy hand when adding the garlic powder, and I only used a small amount of minced garlic. I used an entire 10oz frozen package of spinach.  I did not use any other spices, not even salt. It comes out creamy and delicious!

This was an awesome recipe. I doubled the recipe with these changes. I used 8oz. Pepper Jack shredded cheese instead of doubling the cream cheese. I used more like 1 1/2 cans of arthichoke hearts, but honestly one is still a great amount. This was made for a potluck, and everyone LOVED IT! I even passed out the recipe. Thanks!

this is my favorite recipe that i have cooked so far and everyone always tells me to make this for parties.  I use sour cream instead of mayo. I also use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream and it really does not taste different than using full fat condiments.  I also up the garlic to about 2-3 cloves since I do not have garlic salt.  To replace the garlic salt I use either onion powder or onion salt and it adds amazing flavor to this dish.  I add a little bit more cheese  -hence the reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream :)  I agree with the other reviewers to mix the cheese in the mix but I also reserve a bit just to sprinkle on the top.  I love this dip with triscuts annd pita chips!

Very good! I changed the recipe a little bit, but not too much. I used low fat versions of everything, like the cream cheese and the mayo. I also used minced garlic instead of a fresh clove, and unfortunately I put a little too much minced garlic in. Otherwise, the dip probably would have been perfect! I also added a little more cheese than the recipe called for, and I added some hot wing sauce "to taste" in the end (I used Texas Pete's sauce, but of course any hot wing sauce will work!), which really gave it an extra zip. :)

This dip was amazing! Everyone loved it. I didn't really like the mozzarella sprinkled on top, it made it really hard to dip that first chip in. I'll probably omit next time, or mix it in. This was perfect though!

Loved this! I made with canned spinach because (for some reason) that is what I had. It didn't make a difference, it was still delicious! It is creamy and nothing overpowers another. I served with slices of toasted french bread.

Yum! I really enjoyed this. I used fresh spinach, all paremsan cheese, and took another reviewers suggestion to use sour cream instead of mayo and mixed thoroughly instead of adding the layer of cheese on top. This was soooooo good!

This is great. I made it for the second time last weekend and prepared it the day before.  I do add all the cheese into the mix.  Last time I also left out the spinach as I was making it ahead of time.  I do find that I have to stir it a few times while it's baking.

This was VERY good. I felt like maybe it was lacking something however, some kind of spice, maybe a little heat? I used a couple of splashes Frank's Red Hot Sauce per another reviewer's suggestion, I think I would use more next time. Or maybe a small can of green ortega chilis. Also, I used sour cream instead of mayo (per many reviewers), next time I will try as written.

I absolutely love this recipe. I’ve made it for a dinner party and brought it to work and EVERYONE really enjoyed it.  The only change I made is to top it with a three cheese blend instead of just mozzarella. I’ve also made it once with the spinach and once without and it was great either way.  This recipe has definitely made its way into my recipe box.

I've made this hot dip 3 times now and it is absolutely delicious! Simple ingredients, no fail recipe. The only adjustment I made was to double the amount of garlic the last 2 times I made this. I make homemade pita chips to accompany this dip and always get RAVE reviews.

This was VERY good.  I made some minor adjustments to lighten the recipe.  I used a lowfat cream cheese and low fat mayo.  It still tasted decadent to me.  wanted to also use a lowfat mozzarella but didn't have any on hand.  I had no Romano cheese handy so I just doubled the Parmigiano Reggiano.  Soooo yummy, especially when it is nice and warm.  Would definitely make again.

I have to say that I discovered this recipe on allrecipes years ago.  I made it for a party and enjoyed it.  Since then, I have made it for many parties and it is always a huge hit.  I don't make any changes - I do it as is - and it is so popular!  I am thankful I found this so many years ago and am thrilled that it is still as popular as it was then!

Very good and super easy!   I added a couple shots of Worcestershire Sauce and 1/2 a small onion finely diced and more garlic. Also I bought the bagged cheese (Italian blend- put in 1 1/2 cups)that included all 3 cheeses to help the cost. I also topped it off with diced tomatoes for extra color and flavor.  It was a BIG hit at my Christmas Party! Highly recommend this easy recipe!

It was ok.  Kind of dry and once it cooled down a bit it was hard to eat at all.

Every time I make this for parties, everyone raves about it!!!!  I use a pizza cutter to easily chop up the artichokes.  I leave out the basil.  The garlic really adds the extra flavor.  Awesome dip!!!!!

This was wonderful!!  I'm a big spinach artichoke dip fan but have never made it myself.  It was soo easy!  I did cheat and used an Italian blend cheese instead of buying all of the individual cheeses.  My only other change was to add most all of the spinach in the bag (I did not have an immediate use for it and did not want to waste it) and I added about a 1/2 cup more cheese.  I took others suggestions and mixed all of the cheese in vs putting some on top.  My fater-in-law bypassed the chips and was eating it with a fork.  He told me it was a great spinach casserole.  I'm keeping this one for life.

Perfect!  I didn't change a thing except added a tad more cheese on top before cooking and it was great.  It was even great reheated the next day, thanks for sharing!

LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! If you are looking for a great artichoke and spinach dip then look no further.  I've tried other recipes but they were either too salty or were very bland. This one was absolutely fantastic and so easy to make. I only made two changes, similiar to what most others did that reviewed this recipe: 1) switched out the mayo for sour cream and 2) increased the amount of mozzerella cheese and used the majority of it to blend in with the rest of the dip and sprinkled a small amount to bake on top.  I made this for my New Year's Eve party and it was a hit.  To keep it hot and yummy and prevent the top from getting too hard, I simply used a plate warmer underneath and kept it covered with a lid - not that the lid stayed on it much since everyone couldn't stop eating it!  Another great recipe on this site that is worth sharing - thanks!

Served this at a New year's brunch.  It got rave reviews.  I doubled the recipe except used just one can of quartered artichoke hearts.  I used my hands to break up the hearts into smaller pieces instead of chopping them while they were draining in the colander.  I also used a full bag of mozzerella.  I put most of it in  the mix and just a little on top but I would definitely do the whole bag within the mix next time as I didn't like the hard layer on top.  Next time I might top with bread crumbs.

Tried this recipe today for the football games...it is awesome, everyone loves it.
I followed the advice of others and placed the spinach garlic and basil in food processor.  I also used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/8 cup of sour cream for a creamier taste.

WOW.  Absolutely delicious.  I made it on Christmas and it was a huge hit.  Everyone kept going back for more.  My boyfriend said he wants me to make it every Sunday for watching football games with his friends.  My one complaint is that it was a little too thick, though that may have been my own fault because I added a little more spinach than called for.  I also mixed the mozzarella cheese in the dip and then sprinkled more on top before baking.  It came out better than many restaurants I've tried.  I served it with pita chips and carrot sticks.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This wasn't a favorite, but it was still good. Used sour cream instead of mayo, but everything else was the same. It had a thick consistency, not really creamy and gooey.

I made this dip for a Christmas party I had this weekend and wow , what a hit! I got numerous compliments. My fiance and I were disappointed that there was none left over! Very Yummy. I added more mozzarella on the top but that was the only change.

Followed the directions almost exactly, using light Philadelphia brand cream cheese, and swiss instead of shredded mozzarella- I had to up the amount of Parm and Mozz because I didn't have any Romano. The recipe was requested by everyone at the gathering.

Awesome!!!  Better than your fave restaurant can make it!  This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  There was none left and everyone wanted the recipe.  I am making it again tonight.  Just plain awesome.  
The only thing I had to do different was omit the Romano cheese because I never have that around.  I just added more parmesan and then I added monterey jack on top of the dip instead of mozzerella cheese.   OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD.

This is the best!  Two things that I think are important is to make sure you get the spinach really dry and also I spread the dip in a very shallow dish.  I think the shallower the dish the better the dip...it seems to be very googey which is good!

This is a great dip and well liked by everyone.  I left out the basil and garlic salt. I also used all light ingredients...light cream cheee, light mayo, light sour cream (used 1/8 c. sour cream and 1/8 c. mayo), light cheese.  I too mixed the mozzarella cheese in with the dip and then also added a layer on top.  I recommend cooking for 25 minutes and then putting on broil for about 5 minutes.  Will definitely make again :)

Good flavor but it was so thick. Especially after it cooled it was hard to scoop up into a tortilla chip. I followed the recipe except I added a little siracha (hot chili sauce). I will definatley make again but will most likely add some sour cream to kind of thin it down some.

Made for a birthday party and everyone loved it. Used garlic powder, instead of garlic salt and mixed the mozz cheese into dip instead of putting on top, like others suggested. Served with baquette bread that I sliced, brushed with olive oil and baked...Wonderful...

I have tried so many different recipes for spinach artichoke dip and this one was one of the best I have tried.  I have a very long and involved recipe where you start with a rue base and build it from there that I reserve for special occasions.  But this one was so simple and easy I can make it during the week!  I did sub sour cream for the mayo and used montery jack cheese in place of the motzerella and it turned out really nice.  I even had leftovers to spread on my bagel this morning!

I've been looking for a recipe as good as a restaurant I've had it at, and this recipe is right on. Best spinach artichoke dip I've had. Used whipped cream cheese for convenience, and didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder. I also had to bake it about 35 minutes instead of 25, and it came out perfect. Served with toasted garlic bread and tortilla chips. Excellent!

I made this for a BBQ and it was gone in no time with tons of compliments!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and mixed the mozzarella in with everything else, and then sprinkled just a little extra mozzarella on top.  I also used a little more mozzarella and parmesan than called for.  I doubled the recipe but only used one can of artichokes and thought that was plenty.  Be sure to make a lot because this recipe is sure to go fast...creamy and delicious!

Delicious.  I like to make the night before.  I think it is more flavorful if it sits.

I have made this recipe for the last several years.  I go ahead and take a little creative license with the spices, and everyone is always asking for the recipe.  I never go home with any leftovers when I make this for gatherings.  This is the best artichoke spinach dip ever!

I like to serve mine in a hollowed out sourdough bowl - it looks so pretty!

If I could, I would give this recipe 10 stars!  This is the most delicious artichoke dip recipe that I have made/tasted.  I took it to a friend's luncheon, and every person wanted the recipe.  Sometimes, I add crumbled bacon on top when the cheese is starting to melt, but the recipe as-is is sensational!

YUM!!!!!!!! This is as good or better than any spin/artichoke dip I've ever had....it got the thumbs up from everyone who ate it. You can't go wrong with this dip. I did omit the basil bc I'm not a fan of it personally, and like other posters mentioned, putting the cheese on top makes it a little harder to dig your chip in, but mmmmmm, so good!! This is definitely a keeper--thanks!

This is the best artichoke and spinach dip EVER! I've been making it all summer for BBQ's and it gets polished off every time! My brothers were practically licking the dish clean the last time I brought it to a BBQ. I usually add a little extra garlic and mozzarella cheese on top, but otherwise this is a great recipe.

This was really wonderful! I brought this to a party and everyone asked for the recipe.
I used 1/2 cup Kraft Italian Cheese Blend which included Romano and Mozzarella (instead of the two seperately)- which was cost effective and turned out great!
I think next time I will try adding scallions. Wonderful as is!

This is my "go-to" recipe for whenever I need something that I know is delicious!!!  It is very good, and is also very easy to make.  I have a couple of suggestions... First, make sure to thoroughly drain the artichokes and spinach.  I even take the spinach and squeeze it to wring it out.  This keeps the dip from being runny.  Also, I double the mozzarella cheese, and I add it in the dip rather than putting it on top.  If you put it on top, it has a tendency to dry quickly and create a thick coat.  It is much better to add it in the rest of the mixture.  This is all I would change - overall, it is great dip!

Very good. I brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it. For those that think it's missing something you might want to add an acid ingredient like a squeeze of lemon juice or, as another reviewer added, tabasco, as that has vinegar in it. I also mixed all the cheeses in before baking. Lastly, depending how much you drain (in my case squeeze) the liquid from the spinach, you may need to add some milk or other liquid to loosen the dip prior to baking. Enjoy!

This is the BEST spin & art dip I've ever had!  And, since it doesn't contain any butter, it's healthier than most.

Ok, I am still very new to this idea of cooking so my rating may very well be due to this.  My only problem with this recipe was that is was soooo salty and I did not add any additional salt.  I am assuming that the saltiness was due to the fact that the artichokes were canned.  I will rinse them off the next time but I do plan on keeping this recipe until I get it correct.  Thanks for a great one and I'll make it better next time!

This was very good but not my favorite version that I have tried.  I made it twice - once as the recipe dictated and another time adding more mozzarella cheese and some diced jalapenos.  The basil was a nice element of the dip.  I would probably increase the artichokes by 50% also to add more texture if/when I make it again, but I'll probably try a different recipe first.

Made this for a party and it was a big hit. Everyone wanted the recipe and I had to make it again for my mother and sister. 
I used sour cream instead of mayo like many reviews suggested and used a package of pre shredded itialian cheese mix. It was better than some I have had in restaraunts but feel like it was missing just a little something. Next time I may try it with the mayonnaise or try the restaraunt style recipe.

All in all great recipe and easy to alter.

By far the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had, let alone made myself.  The only thing I will do differently the next time is chop the spinach into even smaller pieces...I also added another clove of garlic (we love garlic at my house)!

Great! I made some changes,though: 1 pound of spinach and 2 cans of artichoke hearts, with 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of the mayo. I forgot the garlic powder and it was not missed. My guests clustered around it and quickly made it disappear!

STOP ME FROM EATING IT ALL.  It's so good.  The next time I make it, I need to figure of how to lower the sodium/salt. It was a bit on the salty side. It might have been the cheese, I used mozzeralla and colby and montrey jack.  I like it cheesy but, WOW.  Thanks

This was great!  I put all the ingredients in my food processor which made it really easy.  I also sprinkled cayenne pepper on 1/2 the dish to add a little heat.  Next time I'll add cayenne to the mixture before baking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very very good.  I'm a huge fan of this dish and this recipe was very close to what you order at a restaurant.  I thought the artichoke level was a bit high so I added more spinach and took away some of the artichoke. Yummy!

This stuff ended up costing more than I had anticipated, but I made it for a bunch a women's meeting and it was devoured.  I served with pita chips and vegs.

OHHHHH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!  YUMMMMMMM! 
This was SOO good!  I also added mostly sour cream.  And I mixed the cheese right in (With a littel on top for decoration.) And by accident used dill weed instead of basil.. but it worked really well!!  
The only complaint i have, is the cloved of garlic i used were really big.  I wish i had not used the big ones.  But next time I will be more selective on the size. It was still wonderful, but a tiny bit heavy on the garlic.  (But that was my fault not this recipes!)
I made it the day before and heated it in the oven for about 30 minutes.  I added a splash extra of milk so it wouldnt get dry.  I will definatly make this again!!  Wonderful!!

This is absolutely de-lish, but I too substituted sour cream for the mayo. (I would never be able to get hubby to even TRY it if it had mayo in it!)  We love this and have even taken it to social functions where it was wiped clean!!

Best spinach dip ever! Followed recipe except for using 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo instead of all mayo, putting half the mozz cheese into the mix instead of on top (other half on top), and using 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Make this for parties all the time and get lots of compliments.

Oooohh, this dip is so good!! I've made this a few times and each time, there are no leftovers! Try to make this dip as spanakopita by separating sheets of phyllo dough on a surface. Brush melted butter on the phyllo, add another phyllo sheet, butter and repeat for about 4 or 5 layers. Cut in strips, then squares, spoon this dip in the center. Fold over to make a little triangle, seal and bake on 350 until golden brown. Yumm!

This recipe was not bad, but it just didn't taste like anything special. The only thing I did different was subsitute sour cream for the mayo (as suggested by other reviewers). If you are looking for a rich, creamy, and cheesy dip then I'm sorry to say that this one isn't it.

Tasted great with some crackers and bread cubes. It did have a thicker consistency than what you'd get at a restaurant, especially after it started to cool. I used a crockpot instead of baking it and that helped to keep it warm and creamier. I'm planning to use the leftovers in a grilled cheese sandwich with some sourdough bread. Mmmmmm...

this recipe was out of this world. i added 1/4 cup shredded Irish Dubliner cheese (gives it a great taste)and the mozarella cheese together with the main ingredients instead of sprinking on top, as it tastes and looks much better when done. highly recommend if you want a fabulous dip for your first time making this! even the kids will love it.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using only 1/8 cup mayo and 1/8 cup sour cream in place of 1/4 cup mayo.  Tried with 1/4 cup sour cream initially but was too strong.  Im making this again tomorrow for the superbowl and cant wait!

This recipe was a big hit at a recent family party. The aroma, while mixing all the ingredients, made my mouth water!! And although I was expecting a creamier, thinner consistency, like the Spinach Artichoke Dips served at Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's, I thought it was very tasty. It's definately a keeper. I think I'll play with it a bit to see if I can get a thinner consistency.

Wow!  This dip is fantastic just as is.  Sometimes for variation I use pepperjack cheese to spice it up, but it isn't necessary.  If you want to have leftovers, make two batches and hide one, because this will disappear in a hurry.

This was good, but I think I prefer a Spinach Artichoke Dip with alfredo... I felt something was slightly missing.

Overall very good though.

I made this dip for the first time a few months ago. Since then, for every gathering we throw at our house (BBQ, cocktail hour, party, potluck), I have numerous requests to make it again! Its the first thing gone & I could almost get away with NOT washing the dish because its nearly wiped clean! I took some recommendations from some of the other reviews & made these changes: used sour cream instead of mayo, use 2 packages of cream cheese instead of just 1, added the mozzarella to the mixture instead of on top, use fresh garlic gloves AND minced garlic, add finely chopped sweet onions (about 1/3 cup), add a few shakes of hot sauce. It turns out BETTER everytime I make it I think. I've passed this recipe on to a few friends who had the same results as me. A++++++ recipe ;)

Wasn't bad, but didn't care for the mozzarella sprinkled on top.  Would have worked out better if it had been mixed in with everything else, it gave it an "ugly hard shell" and didn't look very appetizing.

Took to a New Years Eve party and got rave reviews! It was thick and I left my chunky, less of a dip and more of a spread. Served with bagel chips. Delicious!

I thought this was very easy to make and the ingredients were cheap.  I did not have Romano cheese so I used more parmesan.  I also made mine creamier with more cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo.  I mixed in my mozzarella instead of sprinkling it on top because I didn't want the hard top everyone was referring too.  I also let mine bake and extra ten minutes.  This was good.  Would make again and add more garlic and salt and maybe even some carmelized onions for more of a kick because of the additional use of the cream and cheeses.

Really good.  I read the reviews about it being thick, so I added 3 heaping spoonfuls of sour cream and it had a great consistancy for tortilla chips.  I also didn't have fresh garlic, so I omitted the garlic salt (added just a couple shakes of reg. salt) and 1/8 tsp of dried garlic = 1 clove.  We like garlic so I added 1/2 tsp total and it wasn't overpowering.  Also had no romano cheese, so added 1/2 cup parmesan & mixed in some mozzarella (some used to cover top). Brought it to a game night and it was DEVOURED...my boyfriend keeps talking about it.  It's similar to restaurant dip. It's a keeper! Thanks!

I'm only comparing this to the one you get at Costco that is so fabulous that it makes your knees weak.  To start with, I think I put too much pepper in this but, it is definitley good and I know without a doubt that guests would enjoy this, but it's definitley not Costco's dip.  It comes out very nice and bubbly.  But, I had to bake mine for more than 25 minutes (about 35 min) in order for the entire top to be lightly browned.

Awesome!  I put all of the ingredients into a food processor and mixed it up that way.  Then I put it in a small crockpot and heat it for a couple of hours.  It was great for a New Year's Eve get together.

GREAT!!!  I made this at a small gathering for New Years Eve and it was gone with in 15 min of me taking it out of the oven.  I took some of the other suggestions and used a 1/2 cup of a 3 cheese mix made up of parm, romano, and asiago.  I did have to bake it for about 10 min longer then the recipe stated and it still only got browned around the edges not all over.  Still, this is a new FAV that I will be making again and again!!

Everyone loves this dip!  I like the idea of mixing in the mozzarella cheese instead of spreading it on top.  That would make it easier to dip -- no crusty cheese layer to get through.  This is definitely a keeper -- I have to share the recipe every time I use it.

A friend made this for a get together and it's SO good!  The reviews are correct that this isn't a dip-like quality -- it is much thicker and we used a knife to spread it on crackers, but the taste is oh so good!  I will definitely continue to make this.

The flavor of this dip was really great.  It would have preferred something creamier though.  I think next time I'll add in some sour cream and put the mozzarella cheese in the dip, rather than on top of it.  Instead of using Parmesan and Romano cheese, I used a blend of Parm, Romano and Asiago.  It was really good.

This is absolutely a delicious dip!! I've made it three times for different company and everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe. I did mix the mozzarella cheese in with the other ingredients instead of leaving it on top just because that seemed to be a call out many others made. I also used sour cream instead of mayonnaise. Great dip.

Outstanding!! Made it with sour cream instead of mayo and think next time I will increase it to 1/2 cup as it never did get bubbly BUT the flavor definitely made up for that one small detail. Everyone LOVED it and said it was the best one they had ever had! I agree!!

the flavor was great, but it definitely wasn't ready in 25 minutes.  i left it in the oven for 45 minutes and it still wasn't bubbly, but i had to leave to take it to a party.  it would have been better if it was hotter.

I made this recipe based on REBEC1120's suggestions.  This is definitely for garlic lovers.  I think next time I'll try just one clove and use mayonaise like the original recipe recommended.  I ended up having a lot of leftovers.  Thanks for the suggestions though.

[[UPDATE - 2/7/08 - I made this for superbowl, but DOUBLED. It was a hit, even with the 20-something guys, that I didn't think liked spinach OR artichokes. It's just so yummy! There was JUST enough left over so that I could snack on it for lunch the next day. also, I omitted the mayo, and folded some light sour cream in instead.]]
holy cow. ever since my cousin made spin-art dip for thanksgiving i've been searching for a recipe to match his. THIS, my friends, is bout 100x better than my cousin's recipe. i practically just ate the dip for dinner tonight. i, as well, added the mozz. cheese w/everything else rather than adding it on top.

Very good recipe.  I halved it and used swiss cheese (what I had on hand.)  I made baked wonton cups and placed this in those to serve as an appetizer.  Thanks for the good recipe.  Will be put in favs.

Delicious and easy! Even my husband who thought he didn't like artichokes liked this. Served with sesame bagel chips, which are strong enough not to break when you're scooping. It is very rich and filling, so a little goes a long way.

Served this dip for the 5th time tonight for guests and there never is a bite left! Absolutely delicious! I do half mayo and half sour cream, no basil and no mozzerella. I either sprinkle a little more parmesan on top or maynbe a little monterey jack. Yum. I always serve with pita chips too. They hold up to the thick dip. Definitely try this recipe!

This is a great recipe! Served it and people felt it was much better than going out to eat and ordering it as an appetizer.  Eating the homemade version was much better!  Only recommendation is to add about 4 oz. of cream cheese and 1/4 - 1/2 cup of mayo.  Highly recommended!

This was yummy! I made it for a party and we ate on it all night long, it is better though if you try and keep it warm , it tends to be a liitle thick and hard to dip when it gets cool.

This recipe truly is the best! I made this for a holiday appetizer and many people said it was their favorite dish all night. I put a little extra sour cream and parmesan in it, and used 10oz. frozen spinach. I mixed the mozzarella in instead of putting it on top. I baked it in a glass dish then transferred to a bread bowl and stuck it in a toaster oven to brown the bread. Perfect.

Excellent!  I followed the advice of some of the earlier reviewers and added the mozzarella to the mixture rather than as a topping.  I also skipped the basil since no one in my family is a big fan of it.  It was delicious, and everyone loved it!

I made this recipe for the Ohio State/Michigan game where we had a big potluck. Everyone loved it!

I made it the night before in my crockpots inner pan and put that pan in the fridge overnight. The next morning I put it in my crockpot on keep warm for a few hours before the party. It worked perfectly! You have to be careful that your crockpot doesn't get too hot though because the edges did start to brown a little bit. Other than that - it was perfect!

I doubled the recipe and since I had about 3/4 cup of sour cream left over from my cheesy potatos that I made I went ahead and threw that in too. 

It was great, easy to make and I'm getting ready to make it again right now!

This is really good, but only with some changes.  It was way too dry.  I had to add some cream (about 1/3 cup) to thin it out a bit.  I also used sour cream instead of mayo, skipped the garlic salt and just doubled the fresh garlic, used monterey jack instead of mozzarella and italian seasoning instead of dried basil.  After all the changes it deserves 5 stars!

This was fantastic! I did make a few changes: I used one 10 oz block of frozen spinach and one 10 oz package of frozen creamed spinach, and added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the mayo and cheese. I also used a mix of Romano, Parm, and Asiago cheese, about a 1/2 cup. I used 3 cloves of minced garlic (this was pretty garlicky, which we like, but you might scale it back if you're not as big a fan), some cayenne pepper.Also, I used two 6 oz jars of marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped, and reserved about 2 tbsp of the liquid for this recipe.I originally planned to make the recipe that calls for alfredo sauce, but I didn't have any- so I added some nutmeg to this recipe, about 1/4 tsp, for the alfredo taste. This turned out so well I don't think I'll bother with it now! Delicious!

Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and everyone just loved it! Our friend who is rather picky just kept raving and raving about it. We served it with pieces of parmesan french bread and crackers. Great recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe and felt it was very creamy.  The party I was at tonight had 3 different spinach and artichoke dips and this one was almost gone while the others were barely touched.  I did whip the cream cheese with all the ingredients except the spinach and artichoke and added extra minced garlic from the jar, no garlic salt.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  Delicious!

Very Good.  I doubled this recipe for a baby shower and it went over very well.  People were surprised by how good it was because usually the homemade dip is not even close to the type you get in restaurants. I followed other reviewers suggestions and substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise and mixed in the mozzarella cheese.

This recipe was a hit!  I recently took it to a party and came home with no leftovers.  I added about 1/2 cup of red onions which gave the dip a little kick.  I almost forgot to add the basil and I think it would've been ok without it, so I only added a couple of dashes.  I served with pita chips (another great allrecipes dish).  I will definitely make this again!

This is one of my go-to recipes for parties.  Everyone loves it.  I usually double it because it goes fast.  It's great served with pita chips or tortilla chips.  Like others mentioned, I find no need to add salt to this recipe.

I always double this recipe, and it's a huge hit.  I never use the mayo, I use sour cream instead.  We only ever have pecorino romano on hand so that's what we use.  I mix the mozzarella throughout instead of adding it to the top.  This is a great recipe to make the morning of and then pop it in the fridge until you need to bake it.  I stopped looking for artichoke dips after I found this one.

Awesome recipe!  I also used lite cream cheese.  I used Miracle Whip since I didn't have real mayo.  That seemed a little strong, but adding additional cream cheese mellowed it out.  I mixed everything but the spinach and artichokes in the food processor, which made it very creamy.  This will be the centerpiece of our next party!

This recipe makes about 2 cups of dip...so a pie pan or larger dish makes a shallow dip ready container, or choose a smaller dish for a deeper dip.  I did substitute Neuf. cheese and light mayonaise, plus I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic.  The garlic and other spices added a nice depth to the flavor of the spinach and artichoke.  It was a hit at the party!

The flavor of this dip was delecious, but it was not creamy enough.

If I made it again, I would use less artichoke, and chop it much smaller.

If my family is getting together, they always beg me to make this dip.  My siblings, who hate vegetables, eat thiswith a spoon out of the baking dish.  I use minced garlic instead and always add extra cheese.  So good with tortilla chips.  Better than anything I eat at restaraunts!!

Very good! After reading other reviews, for the 1/4 cup mayo I used half mayo and half sour cream, and all Parmesan because I didn't have Romano. I also mixed the mozzarella instead of putting it on top. I served with tortilla chips and mixed cut veggies.

Awesome! We kind of did a flipflop on the artichokes and spinach (used 6 oz. jar of artichoke hearts and 16 oz. bag of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained).  We are just more a spinach family :-). But the flavor was outrageously delicious.  This was gone in minutes. Definitely a repeat to try at our next get-together.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a delicious recipe for spinach dip! Like the other reviewers I mixed in the mozzerella cheese instead of topping it and it was perfect! I highly recommend, 5 stars!

I think that this dip was too rich for my taste.  For those of you that do not enjoy the taste of mayo, I would only use 1/2 a cup and I would use 1 whole cup of spinach to cut the richness.  However, if you are a big fan of the tast of mayo and cheese this is the dip for you.  Also, I would increase the time you heat this dip to 40 mins.

This is great! I did not have any Ramano cheese so I used 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and I also added another clove of garlic and kept everything else the same.  I will be making this again and again:)  Thanks for sharing your recipe:)

I made this to take to easter dinner at my mothers house. It was good and everyone liked it, although it got a little dry after a while. I would suggest using slightly more garlic and adding water chestnuts. I also had to add a little milk to make mixing easier. Pretty good recipe though!

I brought this to an Easter get together and it was a big hit.  I only added a little more romano and parm cheese because my family loves cheese. It turned out GREAT. I served them with tortilla chips. Thanks so much for sharing. I will definitely make this again.

I give this 3 stars for my error (not the recipe itself). I think I added the wrong amount of spinach and it was over kill.  I think this would have been perfect if I would have paid more attention to the amounts in the recipe.

This is the best artichoke  and spinach dip I have ever made. It is so rich and creamy. When I use this recipe for entertaining it is gone in no time. I did substitute a shredded italian cheese blend (asiago, romano, mozzarella) instead of just the mozz. and it made it even better. I use whole grain flour tortillas brushed with olive oil and garlic, sliced into triangles and baked- great with this dip.

This was great. I thought it tasted much better than Applebee's, although I made a few revisions. Upon the advice of other reviewers, I exchanged the mayo for 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also used a whole box, 10 oz, of frozen spinach. I squeezed all of the water out of the spinach and chopped off the ends of the artichoke hearts. I squeezed the excess water out of them as well and then chopped them up into small pieces. When I was mixing things together, my cream cheese wasn't completely room temperature. So, I added a few tablespoons of milk and that helped with the mixing. All in all, very, very tasty. Even my boyfriend, who hates spinach and artichoke dip, said it tasted good. He ate half a bowl full!

dee-lish!  Mix the mozz in, because otherwise the top gets crusty when the dip cools and it's not too appealing.

Very good, even better than restaurant quality.  I also substituted sour cream for the mayo, and I suggest adding a 1/4 cup of milk to thin it out some. Also, stick to the recipe for the amount of cheese, spinach and artichokes. A quarter cup of mozz doesn't sound like much, but if you add more, it makes the dip too rich. I also stirred it in to the mix instead of sprinkling it on top. Very very good, definitely a keeper.

This recipe was AWESOME!!  It had great flavor and texture and my friends and family loved it!  It was truly a hit on Superbowl Sunday.  I will use this again and again!  One change I did make was to only use one can of artichokes instead of two.  Other than that I followed it to the letter - GREAT RECIPE!

This dip was amazing!  After reading other reviewers' comments I substituted 1/4 c. sour cream for the mayo, and added extra garlic and a few dashes of crushed red pepper flakes.  I also added about 1/4 C. of milk to make it more creamy and dippable.  My friends said it was better than TGIFriday's or Applebee's dip because it was creamier and cheesier!!

I brought this dish to Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone loved it. My only problem was that I probably shouldn't have baked the mozzarella on top. By the time we got there the cheese was hard on top and it was hard to get a chip through. Next time I'll save that for when I get there. Excellent recipe and very easy to make!

This was the best spinach/artichoke dip! Instead of plain artichoke hearts, I used a commercial artichoke tapenade, which also had chopped capers and green olives. Also used all 10 oz of spinach. YUM!

Very good! I made several changes after reading reviews: I skipped cream cheese in favor of sour cream, increased the amount of garlic, and I doubled the spinach.  I'm glad I doubled the spinach because otherwise I would imagine it would be too rich for our tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was good. Took the advice of some reviews: added more garlic (about 3 cloves), a little milk to make it less dry, and put some of the mozzarella into the dip. Still think it is missing a little something. Next time I will try less garlic (maybe it overpowered other flavors?), and maybe some sour cream as suggested by others.

This had a good flavor but it was really hard to get on the chips or crackers. I have had creamier versions that were better. Maybe I did something wrong?

This was okay but I probably won't make again.  I was hoping for a result similar to the California Pizza Kitchen appetizer but this was not it.  I prefer basic artichoke dip or spinach dip over this recipe.

Whether you use frozen spinach or canned it doesn't matter. I even use a italian parmesan blend cheese and use a bit more garlic and it still turns out great. Everyone in my family loves this dip!

WOW...Absolutely heavenly! The only thing I did different was add extra spinach (10 oz. box.) Lots of oohs & ahhs from the entire family. So quick & easy to make. Perfect recipe! I can't hardly wait to make it again!  And YES it is great right out of the dish with a spoon! Thanks!

Great easy resipe.  Was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I did use course salt, and used a papertowel to squeeze all the water out of the spinach.

i made a few of the said changes and i wish that i had stuck with the original recipe.  i sub'ed the mayo with sour cream, and, fearing a dry dip, i didnt squeeze the spinach completely dry.  as a result, it turned out very loose, but with great flavor.  the next day, it was better "set" and it tasted divine.  add a healthy dose of cayenne and real garlic.

this dip blows the lid off anything else.  I doubled the recipe, added in a little sour cream and monterrey jack instead of doubling the cream cheese... and ended up with stuff that is ultra addictive.  cooking time and temp is perfect.  A buzz is already generating in anticipation for the Super Bowl batch I'm going to make.  A new favorite has been born.

Ive made this for 2 different occasions and it has been a total hit!! Everyone loves it! I use tastefully Simples garlic garlic instead of the fresh and its delicious! I do omit the mozz cheese after first time making it because it sort of just sits on top and forms a hard top surface, hard to break your chip through it! Don't need it!

We have an annual tradition of eating an appetizer dinner on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve.  Last Christmas Eve I made another artichoke dip, didn't like it, so I tried this one on New Years Eve.  My husband doesn't eat artichokes.  Which was good, cause I wasn't sharing this dip with him...it was too good!!!  I think I finishd it myself by the end of New Years Day!  I've been looking fwd to this all year, already planning to make it Christmas Eve this year and can hardly wait!!!

Made this for my parents and my grandma - both who were really weary as they hadn't even had any type of spinach artichoke dip... and they loved it!! I couldn't get my dad away from it, and my grandma kept on eating it even though she said she wasn't hungry!! YUM!

I always take this dish to parties. Substituting EVERYTHING for their lite versions doesnt take away from the taste either. Everyone always loves it. Its very versatile. Ive added jalepenos, grilled red pepper (diced), sun dried tomatoes... and it turns out great every time.

This recipe was GREAT! I made this for about 20 guests and there was none left. I did follow other's advice and stir in the mozerella instead of adding it to the top. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Wow, I hate to buck the trend of 5 star ratings, but I followed this recipe to the letter, and the dip turned out dry and crumbly, instead of rich and creamy as I would have expected.  Not sure why, but I'll look for another recipe next time.

This is a great recipe.  I make it so often I started keeping all of the ingredients on hand so I can whip it up when guests stop by.  I like to serve it with french bread cooked in those pampered chef bread tubes.  It looks impressive with little effort.

This dip was fantastic!!! I live in the country where most people are no-nonsense meat and potatoes kinds of people and they don't like to try new things. I just made this dip and it was the hit of the New Year's party!!! I had many people asking for the recipe. I will definately make it again!

Really rich and creamy.  Omitted the garlic.  A bit too much of a cream cheese taste, would maybe reduce it a bit next time, but all my guests loved it.  Served with thin Triscuits.  Would def make again!

I made this dip for my party this weekend. Just as it was out of the oven, it was gone! I only got one bite of it. I made it with a whole package of spinach and a little more cheese to balance the recipe. It was a hit!

Used low fat cream cheese and low fat mozz cheese - always, rave reviews!!!  I did mix the mozzarela in instead of just putting it on top.

quite good....I used this as a base and added some crushed red pepper and a can of jalapenos, drained, for a kick.  Also, I made is earlier in the day and reheated it when ready to serve.  It increased the flavor drastically.  Lastly I added some smoked gouda cheese for added flavor.

The best dip ever!  Make this one exactly as listed and you will not be let down.  I made it for the first time for a party with 70+ people and it was a huge hit.  I'm just upset that there was none left for me to take home.  It is garlicy, so ease up if you're not a fan and the mozzarella on the top made it a bit difficult to use it as a dip; my bread slice couldn't break through the cheese without some help from a spoon. Next time I will use much less on top.

I really loved this recipe, the only thing I did different is blend the spinach, artichokes, mayo and garlic together so the dip would be smoother, and then added everything else to it.  I thought it was great!! It didn't go over very well with my family though, I think it was too rich for them, but I was in heaven with this creamy dip and toasted baguettes.

I had a long time searching for a good spinach dip recipe and I FINALLY found one that I REALLY liked. I just added a little bit of milk to make it creamier and it was EXCELLENT!!! Amazingly Fabulous!!!!!!

Really great tasting appetizer. I used reduced fat cream cheese, added an extra 1/4 cup of spinach, and stirred in the mozzarella cheese instead of putting it on top. Served with Baked Tostitos. Will definitely be using this one again, very easy and delicious. Thanks!

Everyone always loves this dip.  I use all parmesan instead of  half Romano, leave out the garlic salt and for some reason I made it 4 times using 1.5 cups of spinach before I realised I'd been misreading the amount however I'll probably keep making it that way.  As suggested by other reviewers I stir the mozzarella into the dip and, again, I read the amount wrong and added half a cup instead of one quarter.  If I don't have mayonnaise in the house I'll use sour cream with equally good results.  I mix this up several hours in advance and keep it in the fridge until guests arrive then pop it in the oven, which is convenient for me and allows the flavors to blend nicely.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have romano, so i doubled up on the parmesan, and I, too, mixed in the mozzeralla based on others' advice.  There seemed to be something "missing," but when i heated the leftovers the next day, the flavor really came out; I guess it needed to sit for the flavors to meld.   Would defiantely make this again!

I LOVE artichokes.  I love spinach.  I love garlic.  I love cheese.  I LOVE flavor.  Why didn't I ever make this before!?!?!  This is the best Spinach Artichoke dip I have ever had.  It beats every restaurant dish I've ever tried...hands down!  I did not have any Romano cheese on hand, so I subbed with mozzarella.  This was an excellent idea, because as I pulled my nacho out of the dip, beautiful cheese stretched from the chip to the plate.  It was fantastic!  Also, I broiled it for the last minute to give the top mozzarella a pretty golden brown color.  You can't beat this recipe!

This is the first time I attempted to make a dip like this and it was very easy to make and didn't take much time at all.  

Everyone really enjoyed it and said how good it was.  I did alter the recipe slightly based on other suggestions.  I used 1/2 cup mayo (lowfat and no one noticed), I added more spinach, and I mixed the mozzerella in with everything else and only sprinkled a little on top.  Next time I won't sprinkle any mozzerella on top since it did get hard as others mentioned.  Also, I used marinated artichokes and minced garlic to be sure it was as tasty as possible.  

I plan to make this again soon and feel as though I have found "my dish" to take to parties.

This recipe tasted almost exactly like some I had once at a Greek restaurant!  I did make a few money saving modifications.  First, I halfed the recipe since I was making it for the first time and there were only 4 of us to try it. Second,  since Romano cheese is not exactly cheap, I substituted Monterey Jack cheese instead.  And last I used minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh.  It turned out awesome!  Everyone really liked it.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts, which gave it extra flavor.  I can't wait to make it again.

Being me, I put a small bulb of garlic instead of a clove in and it made it really garlicky. But we love garlic so it was delish! I listened to another reviewer and placed parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella on top and it turned out fine. I just threw in the whole package of frozen spinach and compensated by putting more mayo, parmsan cheese, romano cheese, and salt. I also used reduced fat cream cheese to cut down the calories. It was a hit, my friend kept the leftovers and heated it up in the microwave for breakfast! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This provided a great base I could work with to achieve my favorite dip at a local restaurant!

I made several changes - used different cheeses, fresh spinach (and used a little more), added a bit of olive oil, onion powder and garlic powder, parsley, and, on the advice of many reviewers, added some half and half.

I had a similiar dip at a wedding shower this weekend and was looking here for the recipe, it was the same except the cook did not use romano cheese or spinach and she also added a small container of sour cream.  It was amazing.  You can add crab meat as well, for another spin on it. YUM!!  This was a big hit at the shower.

This was pretty good although the spinach flavor was somewhat overwhelming.  Good texture and color. (I added cheese and paprika on the top before baking).  I did not use heavy cream.  I added a big glop of mayo which made it creamier.  This was an accident because I didn't have any cream!  I would make this again and thanks for sharing!  Happy New Year!

Have made this many times and even used reduced fat cream cheese & mayo and it's fantastic. I serve it with baby carrots and pita bread chips(cut pita into wedges and lay on baking sheet and spray w/olive oil pam and sprinkle garlic salt and pepper and bake them!)-- always get raves on this one- thanks for sharing!!

WOW...  What a dip...  I added one can of diced green chilies to the recipe.  It is also much easier to use a pre-mix of shredded Italian cheeses.  Goes great with tortilla chips.

This dip is so good!! I was unsure about the artichokes but you don't even taste them! Taste like garlic and cream cheese.  I had made this and it was gone within an hour.

This is a very good dip.  A suggestion though, regular Parmesan, and Romano both have a high sodium content.  Better to use Parmesan reggiano, much lower sodium.  I used Parmesan reggiano and left out the Romano .  Using both parm and Romano would be far too salty with artichoke hearts which are pretty high in sodium.

Not sure why, but this wasn’t my favorite dip.  I followed the directions and ingredients and can’t quite put my finger on why I didn’t  care for it.  I will look for another recipe next time.

This is the best spinach dip I've ever made!!! I followed almost exactly, swapped mayo for sour cream, but that was the only change. It makes a decent amount, but if you're having a large party, I would probably double it. I no longer have to look for the perfect hot spinach dip - this is it!

I usually use gorgonzola or blue cheese instead of the Romano.  I also haven't tried the dried basil in it yet.  Regardless this recipe is the only one I use.  I've used it for literally 14 years now.  Or atleast I started with the first version but it's still pretty much the same.  Thanks!

Turned out awesome. Doubled the cream cheese, sour cream (used instead of mayo), and cheeses. Bought quartered artichoke hearts and diced them for a smoother texture. Make sure that if you double the wet items that you also double the spices otherwise it can end up a little bland. Texture: 10:10, Flavor: 8:10 (just because I didn’t double the seasoning, so more on me then the recipe.)

This was super quick and easy. I actually had all but the Romano in the fridge. I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. It was a big hit for our LSU Peach Bowl party! Next time I think I'll try putting in a bread bowl..

i added chopped jalapenos for spice. i used fresh spinach and found i had to cook it longer, like 20-30 minutes, to cook the spinach. but that could be just my old oven.

I topped with cheese  because I like adding that layer, I also added chopped water chestnuts. Again, I know they would make a great addition...I toasted ripped up Italian bread this time to eat it with, but I have tried it with so many dippers, I don’t really have a favorite, they all work, including other crunchy vegetables....This warms really well in the microwave also for days.....Really good!

Made as written with two exceptions: I used 2 cloves of garlic, mixed in the 1/4 c. motzerella, and put 1/4 c. on top. My thinking is that 1/4 c. is not enough to create a hard cruse for dipping, plus I love cheese! I'll report back as soon as we have this with Christmas dinner.

Excellent! I switched the Mayo for sour cream (upped it to 1/3 cup), added lemon juice, and doubled the garlic. It was great!

Perfect method, and the Mayo really steps it up a notch. I’ve made it and forgot the mayo, not near as good. Add a little cream cheese if you have some, like a tablespoon or two and it makes it even richer.

I’ve made this recipe many times and it always turns out FANTASTIC.  I recommend following the recipe and don’t make any changes.  You’ll be pleased.  Just beware that this dip is addicting!  Me and the hubby had to use a lot of will power to not eat the whole thing in one sitting.
I saw another reviewer mention this is dry.  It’s not dry but it’s not super creamy like the restaurant stuff.  I personally have never liked the restaurant creamy stuff.   The flavors of this dip is just so much better than anything I’ve ever had in a restaurant.

GREAT recipe, though I did make some adjustments based on the comments, my preferences, and ingredients available in my house.  Recommend doubling it for a party and serving with baguette slices, pita chips, carrots and celery sticks.  It was enjoyed by all!  Will definitely make again. 
Here are the adjustments;
- Doubled the Parmesan and skipped the Romano (or could do vice versa)
- Instead of all mayo, did half mayo/half sour cream
- Dropped the basil entirely
- Added half a packet of Knorr dried leek soup
- Mixed in most of the mozzarella, leaving just a third of it sprinkled on top (commenters said if you put it all on top, it creates a crust that is hard to break through when dipping).
Notes: If you double the recipe, you'll use up one box of frozen spinach.  Diced water chestnuts might be another good addition to this recipe.

It was decent.  My fault that I over chopped the artichokes and spinach - but it was ok.  
I didn't much care for the mozzarella and would omit it next time.

I made it once and that's all it took.  Everyone loved it.
The recipe is easy and delicious exactly as written.
Next time, instead of crackers, I'm going to make or buy toasted garlic butter baguette chips . I think that would be a great combo with the dip.

We loved this recipe! Instead of using this as a dip, we used it as an alfredo sauce. We put all of the ingredients into a sauce pan and cooked it on med/low heat stirring regularly. My boyfriend added a splash of moscato and it was a perfect addition! We added chopped grilled chicken and ate it on top of zoodles and it was INCREDIBLE! This is one of the best low carb dishes I've ever made. It can be difficult to have sauces stick to zoodles but this clung to every zoodle. 10/5 stars!

I made this exactly to the recipe and got rave reviews! It was delicious.  One of our guests said it was better than any restaurant that serves this.  I was recently on a Sunset Cocktail cruise and they had served this appetizer  I think I ate only this appetizer, it was so good I went back 3 times.  So, I needed to find a recipe and this fits the bill even better than the one on the cruise.  I think the garlic really gives it a great flavor.

I actually mixed everything together and put in the pan. I increased the garlic to 2 cloves & the mozzarella to 3/4 cup in the mixture & then scattered even a little more over the top before I put it in the oven. I used a whole package of frozen spinach. Once I squeezed the water out, it was about a little less than a cup. I also substituted sour cream like other suggested. Maybe next time I will stick with the mayo to see if it will make it a little creamer than the sour cream.

This was a hit! My gaming night crew loved this dip. I made two changes to this recipe. I added another clove of garlic because you can never have too much garlic and I replaced that mayo with plain greek yogurt. It was creamy and delicious and I will be making it again!

This was a great and tasty recipe. Followed other reviewers’ directions to sub sour cream for mayo and also added bacon bits .  I made a double batch for a family gathering and it was a big hit! An easy to assemble recipe.

I made this with homemade mayo I made the same day. It was wonderful! No leftovers from the party. I made mine in advance, baked 30 minutes before party for about 20 minutes. Make sure to mix cheese in. Thank you!

We made this dip and it was absolutely, amazingly delicious. We used plain yogurt instead of mayo! We will definitely be making this dip again. We also cooked 2 pieces of turkey bacon and crumbled it up and added to the mixture before we baked it!

I used a couple of pieces of turkey bacon. Fried them real crispy and crumbled them in the mixutre. Also, I used plain yogurt instead of mayo.

I’ve made a recipe with all the same ingredients except the basil for years.. .. saw this & decided to try it .... I think the basil makes it quite yummier !!  Family members- used to my previous dip,  agree...
My suggestion- save the artichoke liquid to stir in for a creamier dip!!

This was a easy and impossible to mess up dip. The only real changes I made was adding more cheese to the dip and on top, and using more garlic. Garlic salt is completely pointless; just use garlic, salt, and pepper to taste.

This is very thick not at all like chain restaurant dips. My chips kept braking trying to scoop a little. I made this recipe exactly as  instructed. No substitutions. THE flavor is good but tangy

I've made this twice now. It's a huge hit at cookouts and holiday shinanigans!!! The only thing I changed is I added a little more cheese of course! I mixed the mozzarella cheese in with the the cream cheese mixture! I topped it off with shredded pepper jack cheese and O M G!!! Fantastic recipe! Thanks!

I have made this several times , always to rave reviews. I sometimes add feta cheese or goat cheese , but it is wonderful as is . I just put it in a crockpot and once it’s all yummy and mixed in good , put on warm and then just give it a stir every once in awhile , it never stays long enough for me to have to worry about it burning or drying out . Thank you for a great recipe .

Really delicious an quick to make! It's great when hot, but is nice to add as a spread on some toast for breakfast. I also opted for using whipped cream cheese and sour cream instead. I paired these with some cracker and it was so good! If you're short on time whip this up and warm it up at your place or the host's house.

This was good. I simplified it by not adding the Romano, garlic salt, or mozerella. I added some chopped onion and whipping cream which made it super creamy. I also had some cotja cheese on hand so I added that as well. Finally, I seasoned it with white pepper and a seasoning I have called “savory.”

I was a little hesitant to make this because of some negative reviews but wow, LOVE it!! I made it exactly per the recipe and it was delicious! Took it to a party and got asked who made it because they liked it so well. I thought this recipe was perfect and am putting it in my recipe book for sure. Only super yummy recipes make it there:)

I have made this so many times & have it bookmarked with ?? So I never lose it ! About 15 years ago I started really loving spinach dip from restaurants, so I set out to make my own . But this particular one stands out & is now the only one I make . A girl my sons was dating came for thanksgiving  one year & she said it is better than restaurants she has had . I make this with a drizzle of Olive Oil on top after it comes out of the oven & I sometimes do not have the same cheese it calls for , but still perfect . If we want spicy I can add pepper flakes or maybe a splash of hot sauce on top . But don't get me wrong I made it exactly the way recipe calls for many times and it is perfect .

Cook book cooking is not my thing, I add what I have on hand!  I "m not a fan of frozen spinach so I used pre-washed spinach and cooked in butter along with crushed garlic. I would have added chopped onions if I had them. For the cheese I used Belgioioso Shaved Blend (Asiago, Parm, Romano. (Sam's club) For spices I followed the recipe but added Holy Smoke Smoked Black Pepper, and Trader Joes Mushroom & company Seasoning blend! I also used the whole large jar of artichokes from Sam's club!Even though it called for half the amount! I'm so excited to try it cooked!  It's currently making in my oven!! I licked the spoon and it tasted amazing so far!

Delicious! I make a double batch in a 9x13” glass baking dish and add a few more minutes baking time, until it’s lightly browned and bubbling in the middle. Serve with salsa and sour cream on the side, with hot baguette slices, bagel crisps and/or heated tortilla chips as dippers. Always a crowd pleaser.

There were just 4 of us, a loaf of warm, thinly sliced ciabatta, and some white wine.  When we were done, there wasn't much left of the dip (or the wine :) ).  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and see no reason to do so the next time I make it (other than doubling it).  This one is a definite keeper.  Easy to make and absolutely delicious!  Outstanding!

It was amazing. I doubled the recipe for a large group. Substitute minced garlic in a jar instead of the fresh garlic. Also my store did not have plain Ramona cheese so instead I used an Italian mix of shredded cheese that had it in it. Turned out amazing and so flavorful.

I made this for two different parties recently and it was very well received at both.  I used fresh spinach both times, but otherwise followed the recipe as written (except that I used 1/2 cup of a mixed Parmesan/Romano grated cheese).  Even picky eaters enjoyed it and it paired nicely with some Pepperidge Farms  Trio crackers (the fancy box).  Both times it took longer for the cheese to melt and brown than the cooking time on this recipe, it needs about 10 minutes more in both ovens I used.

Really good.  I just used it as a cold dip and omitted the cheese for dairy intolerances and it was great!

I made this recipes in a large crockpot and it was super delicious!  The recipe calls for mayo but I used about 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I made this dip for a party and it was the most loved.

I made this recipe for the first time and it turned out SO good. I made 0 changes to it. It's honestly perfect how it's written. I've tried other warm spinach artichoke dips and this is by far my favorite. Even my husband who doesn't like spinach enjoyed this dip. I made homemade pita chips to go with it and it was a perfect match. I highly recommend it!

This recipe was great! It was missing just a little something from the taste I was looking for, but still great! Made it for New Years Eve & everyone seemed to really enjoy it. You do want to make sure & chop your artichoke & spinach into smaller bite sizes so you get more of everything in one bite.

This version, although delicious, was a little too bland. Add a lot more Penzey's granulated garlic powder, half a jalapeño, (seeded) a lot of dried dill (didn't have any fresh dill, which would be much better). This  is a great place to start!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times! I use frozen artichokes and chop them thaw them and drain them kinda like the spinach. And I'm extra generous with the cheese, especially the topper, I like to add some Romano and parmesan to the top! Highly recommend you try this recipe!

Sooo good! I made his for an appetizer on Christmas Day and everyone absolutely loved it! The only thing I changed was I used sour cream instead of mayo and mixed the mozzarella into the dip itself (the dish looks much more appetizing when you can see what it is rather than having it covered by cheese). I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly into my 8x8 baking dish. You really can’t go wrong with this- it’s so easy and quick. Just make sure your cream cheese is very soft (room temp) or you’re gonna have a hard time with it.

I made this dish for a family holiday party. The only change I made was subbing sour cream for the mayo. It was the breakout hit of the party. I had more requests for the recipe than anything I've ever made. Thanks for a great recipe.

Omg this was amazing!!!! I took the advice of others and substituted the mayo with sour cream. As well I also used grated parmesan and then the Italian blend cheese from Safeway someone suggested. So glad I did!!! I also added more garlic (I have the already minced stuff feom costco) i doubled it. I cooked mine for 35 mins as at 25 was not yet melted enough and that was perfect. My kids nearly ate the whole entire thing hahaha. Amazing recipe.

WOW, this is better than the restaurant!!  I couldn't find Romano cheese, so I used the ''dry'' romano/parmesan cheese I use on spaghetti & Sour Cream instead of mayo...That was the only changes I made... Served it right out of the oven with Tortilla Chips... One guest said she had to go outside to keep from eating the entire bowl herself..LOL!  This is a ''KEEPER'' & I'll be making it over the Holidays too... My husband loved it as well..

This dip was very tasty. I served it for a baby shower, and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe, and there was none left. I used sour cream instead of the mayo just because that's our personal preference, and I left out the basil and put in two cloves of garlic. Also mixed in the mozzarella and then sprinkled a little on top. The best part is you can make it ahead and keep it in the refrigerator until it's time to bake it. Would definitely make this again for a party, would be great for watching football too. Super easy to put together which I really appreciate. I served it with tortilla chips, but it would be wonderful with pita chips or toasted sourdough or French bread too.

love it, but it's missing some pizzazz.. I think it needs a little bit more creamy cheese like Gouda or Asiago, Provolone, Mozzarella...
PS: I added 1 spoon of cream milk to make it smoother

Made it exactly as the directions say except I used an Italian cheese blend in place of all the cheese. It was very good! Another reviewer suggested not sprinkling cheese on top, they said it became hard. I ended up doing as the directions said and did sprinkle on top and I am glad that I did. The cheese on top looked pretty and was soft and yum. I made it for a Halloween party and I am glad I jumped in line to get a little because it was the first thing gone. I served mine with sliced french bread and one loaf was the perfect amount of bread to go with it.

Great flavor!  I used a reduced fat cream cheese and the dip was very thick and more of a spread than a dip.  May have been from the swap but the recipe was a hit!

This was so good. I did make with with sour cream instead of mayo, I did not use any herbs, and only used 1 clove of garlic, but wished I had used two. I cooked mine in a deep dish pie plate and had to cook a 5-8 min longer. Next time I will just put it in a glass 9x13 dish, I think it would cook faster, be easier to dip out.  I served it with lightly toasted baguettes slices & tortilla chips. This will go in my recipe box!

More garlic & spinach, used sour cream and mayo. Very thick so mayo thinned it out a bit.  Also added the mozzarella to the other ingredients. Not sure I would make it again, but was very good.

Amazing recipe!!! My family loved it! I followed the recipe as best I could (didn’t have the proper measuring cup sizes) but it still came out great. 

 I made this as a starter but it ended up being the main course after my main course failed.

I took this to two different gatherings in a week and everyone LOVED it. Best spinach and artichoke dip ever. I took the advice of other reviews and substituted mayo with sour-cream, and then the first time I made this I was working on another recipe at the same time so I accidentally added about 1/2 tsp of Oregano to the dish and we loved it so much that we just made it a part of the recipe! I would recommend this to anyone!

This turned out perfect. I meant to use sour cream instead of mayo but totally forgot and it was still amazing. The only real changes I made were to mix in the mozzarella before baking, and as soon as I took it out of the oven I immediately topped it with shaved parmesan. Absolutely making again!

My kids always order this appy when we go out for dinner so I thought I would try to make it at home. This recipes met with rave reviews. I made it exactly as written except I did add a little extra shredded nacho cheese mix on top.
I will make this again and try substituting the mayo with sour cream as others have recommended but it is excellent as is.

I had company and wanted to make an appetizer with things I had on hand..... So, I made this appetizer "pie" without the spinach. I also used only parmesan cheese. My ingredients were;  1 block of cream cheese, 1/3 c. mayo, 1/4 c. sour cream, garlic, 1 cup of parmesan cheese, (real, not the stuff in the green tube), a few drops of Tx Pete, and Panko crumbs on top. I baked it in a 350 oven 'til bubbly, about 35 min. It was devoured by all!!!

Great addition to our appetizer collection. My only change was mixing the mozzarella in with everything else vs sprinkling on top.

My kids loved this. Used artichokes in oils and chopped fresh spinach sautéed. I added chopped water chestnuts coz I like the crunch. I also added lemon to spinach and artichokes. This would be good with bacon too. Made in my magic cast iron pan.

12/25/17:  I used sour cream instead of mayo, and I mixed the cheese in with the dip instead of putting it on top.  This was a yummy and thick dip.

Delicious!  Doubled the recipe and did half the mayo and subbed the half with sour cream like others suggested. Prepped it the night before (stuck it in the fridge) and cooked the next day for Christmas as an appetizer. Served with baguette bread and tortilla chips.

I threw everything into the slow cooker on low for a few hours. Delicious! I used the mayo, but also added 1/4 cup sour cream. Used the full package of spinach, and didn't have Romano cheese so added more Parmesan. Would absolutely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

just a small amount of mayo, and I put yogurt instead: healthier and no harm done. Also, a bit more pecorino that stated, a thin layer on top, and it gave it a kick. When reheated is a bit dry, but it's still good

This was a big hit at my son's birthday party.  Easily the most popular appetizer.  I substituted the mayo for sour cream and increased the garlic to 2 cloves.  I mostly eye-balled the cheese and probably ended up doubling each.  I used one 10oz package of spinach along with about half of a small sour cream container.  I served with pita chips and also bread.  It was great!

My family loves this. I make it every time we get together. They rave and have asked for the recipe. I love that it is more artichoke forward and less spinach-y. We enjoy the artichoke flavor. I will always use this recipe going forward.

It was delicious and disappeared quickly. Like others I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and mixed in the mozzarella cheese and sprinkled a little extra on top. Served it with veggies and pita chips. Will make it again.

Oh my.  Eating this is what I imagine what eating the nectar of the gods must be like!  Utterly delicious.  We have three Afghanis young male refugees and they ate it all up -- even though they had never encountered anything like it before!  Believe me, that is quite a compliment!  The only change I made was to use canned artichoke bottoms.  I really would have been happy to eat it all by myself, but my boys enjoyment gave me so much pleasure.  Thanks so very much for this recipe.

I decided to used fresh spinach that I blanched instead of frozen....mostly because I had it already and needed to use it asap. Also I used the artichoke heart that comes in a jar marinated so it was full of flavor!  And I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and the olive oil mayo instead of regular mayo. Anyway it came out super delicious !!!!

Swapped sour cream for mayo, and blanched fresh spinach instead of using frozen.

Have made this twice now and it's a hit! Super delicious and everyone is always begging for the recipe.

Took advice from other reviews and substituted the mayo for sour cream and I'm not a fan of the mayo taste in dips either so it was a win-win substitution. I didn't have Romano so I doubled the parmesan. I then put it into my Little Dipper crockpot for an hour and it was perfect! We had leftovers the next day and it was even better so I think I would probably make it a day in advance to let the flavors really meld. The mozzarella really added that cheesey gooey feeling i love in spinach dip! Definitely get the marinated artichokes, adds so much flavor!!

Very good but I would eliminate all of the salt.  I used the marinated artichoke hearts so it was tasty enough with that & the 4 different cheeses.

Super easy and a huge hit. I added a bit more garlic than the recipe called for.  Now going to be a family event staple.

This recipe was SO easy, and SO good!  Made it for the first time last night, with only one substitution (I forgot the mozzarella cheese).  I put in queso freso (a Hispanic type of whole milk cheese) instead of the mozzarella.  Everything else was according to the recipe.

My friends gobbled it up, and said repeatedly how much they liked it!  I will definitely be making this again.  One note:  instead of serving traditional corn tortilla  chips, I will serve this next time with pita chips or something a bit sturdier/thicker.  The dip is heavy, and needs a heavy scooping type of chip.  

Make this--you won't be disappointed!

I followed a few other reviewers swapping sour cream for the mayo, added lemon juice and extra garlic.  Very good and I will make it again.

Everyone loved this dip.  I did read a few reviews and used the sour cream in place of the mayo.  I also mixed in all the cheese as was suggested.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and omitted the basil.  I did make one error and all I had were fresh frozen artichoke hearts but it came out perfectly!  We had it for Easter brunch after church and everyone loved it.

Like others, I used sour cream instead of mayo and added extra spinach (around another 1/2 cup). It was perfect for a potluck!

I chose to make this for a family get together.  I put all the ingredients in my crockpot.  Although I personally thought it could be creamier by using more sour cream/ mayonnaise/plain Greek yogurt and gave it only 4 stars; I will be trying this recipe again.

Perfect! Mayo sceeves me out but its necessary in this recipe. I also never used chopped artichoke hearts. I don't like the leave texture so I ONLY use artichoke bottoms. Simply perfect! Thank you!

I've been waiting for a get-together to make this and I finally got to for the Super Bowl. It went great and for a first time making it, it went over much better than I could have expected. This recipe is better than Applebee's! I'll definitely be making this again!

12/18-  Made this recipe for Christmas and not many people liked it.  I think I'll look for a different recipe.

I took the advice of others- I used whipped cream cheese, sour cream instead of mayo, a romano/parm blend, omitted the basil and garlic salt and mixed the mozz in with the rest of the ingredients.  I doubled the recipe, baked it and put it inside a bread bowl.  Served with homemade pita chips and a baguette.  Doubled the recipe for a super bowl party!  YUMMY!

I had fresh baby spinach (used about 3 cups chopped) but otherwise followed the recipe. Home run. Might have topped it with a little extra mozz, too. Huge hit for NYE w wife and kids.

This is a great recipe!  I mixed it together (substituted sour cream for the mayo and left out the mozz) and put it in a 1.5 qt crock pot.  Perfect amount of dip for that size.  I only wish it was thinned down maybe a little but it was very good regardless!

Excellent recipe.  I made this for Christmas and it was a hit.  Very good with crackers or vegetables.  It did take a little longer to bake.  Thanks for a keeper recipe

Outstanding recipe!! Doubled the recipe and used more parmesean and omitted the garlic salt.  Dinner paled in comparison...a unanimous feeling by the dinner crowd.

Super simple, each time I make it there is none left.   I now add a small can of diced green chilies for a little extra flavor.

I've made this twice. Once with mayo and once with sour cream per other recommendations.  I didn't really notice a difference but it was a major hit both times. I also added extra mozzarella to the mixture.

This recipe reminds me of the spinach artichoke dip they make at a very nice steakhouse/restaurant here in town, it tastes exactly like it. I made it without basil and garlic salt, And left some chunks in bc that's how I like it. Mixed the shredded mozzarella, baked it, then added extra on top and let it get brown and bubbly on the broiler for 2 mins. I served it with light tortilla chips, sour cream and salsa (that's how the restaurant serves it here)- omg!
Delicious! My bf and family couldn't stop raving about it all night. Keeper. Thank you for the great recipe.

No idea what happened but followed the recipe to the T and it was extremely dry. Major bummer cause the flavor was good but way to dry.

instead of mayo, I used sour cream. I also mixed in the mozzarella and sprinkled a bit on top. Next time I won't sprinkle the mozzarella on top as it hardens when it cools and makes it hard for dipping. However,  it turned out amazing and was a hit at my christmas potluck!

It was a really easy recipe to follow. I did take the other reviewer's advice and used sour cream instead of mayonaise. Never could stand that stuff. And it turn out great. Unmade it as a trial run for a Christmas potluck coming up in December.

This is the best spinach artichoke dip by far! I've made this recipe many many times and  it's always so delicious. I get requests to bring it to parties and get asked for the recipe. I often double the recipe because it goes fast and everyone LOVES it! The recipe as is, is delicious and the only time I change anything is when I use whatever cheese I have on hand.

This was great and very easy to pull together.  As other reviewers suggested, I folded the mozzarella into the dip rather than putting it on top.

This recipe is by far the best.  I especially love the addition of basil, gives it another flavor element that is complementary to the entire dish.

Have made this several times for gatherings. Its always a big hit. Also I always put some in a small container in the freezer for myself for another time. Comes out of the freezer, into the microwave & tastes like it was just made.

I accidentally put the whole bag of frozen chopped spinach in without looking at the recipe.  When I realized it, I just added 1/4 more mayonnaise and it came out perfect! Everyone loved it!

I made this today for company, and I must say it was pretty hard to maneuver. I followed the recipe as instructed, not so great, it's not creamy at all, so it breaks the chips. 
The taste is good, next time I'll add sour cream to make it creamier.

I've made this many times. It is very good, but a bit bland to my taste as written. I add an extra clove of garlic and 1/3 cup of feta crumbles. Then it is so yummy that my family and friends keep asking me to make it.

Made it a day ahead without the mozzarella.  20 minutes in the oven.  Next day the mozzarella went in (not on) and I put in the oven to warm up.  A big hit thank you.

My family can't get enough of this dip (Actually I don't like to put it in the same category as dip because it's so much more than a simple dip).  Easy, quick, delicious; and because my family is often so impatient to wait until it is baked, I've also heated in the microwave with wonderful results.  (I did add about 1/4 cup of sour cream -- not sure it made a difference, but I had it on hand).

I've made this so many times now I don't even need to look at the recipe! I make it mostly for parties and everyone loves it! The only changes I make are that I add more garlic. I saute onions and mushrooms to give it more bulk and add that in and I mix the cheese right in instead of on top. So good and easy to make!

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit.  I have made it exactly to recipe and it is great.  I have made it with various cheeses depending on what I have on hand, and it's still great.  I've used fresh spinach instead of frozen--amazing and my preferred options.  I have even added a little lemon zest which isn't super obvious but seems to liven up the flavors.  Basically, this is a great recipe to use as is or just as a base depending on what ingredients you have on hand.  It's great with both chips or your favorite bread side.

Tip: use the smallest artichokes you can find or don't be afraid to cut up whatever you have.  When they are too big, it can be hard to easily get a scoop with your chip.  The smaller the artichoke, the easier for potluck sharing when you may not have individual spoons on hand to help you out.

This is one of my favorite hot dips.  I have made it at least three times if not more, and the dish is always scraped clean.

I think it's better when there's a larger variety of cheeses incorporated into the recipe. I used Gruyere, Manchego, Parmesan,  and Mozzarella and it's amazing. Also added 1/4c. sour cream

I've made this dip at least 25 times if not more, and everyone always loves it.  People ask me to bring it to their parties all the time.  I always add more spinach because I rationalize that I'm getting my veggies in :)  The first time I made the recipe exactly as written and loved it.  The following times I followed many reviews and switched the mayo with sour cream.   I also use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and sour cream to make it a little less fattening and even still everyone raves.  I mix most of the cheese in the dip and leave just a little on top. Give this a try, I haven't met anyone that didn't love it.

I make this all the time for parties and it's always a huge hit!! Over the years I've just loosely followed the recipe using whatever cheeses I've got handy, replacing the mayo with sour cream, doubling the spinach, using marinated artichoke hearts, etc. It's a very flexible recipe that lends well to experimentation, and I rarely have leftovers. Serve with chips or a sliced baguette (my fave!) and your friends will love you!

So good. Switched out the mayo for sour cream and stirred in the mozzarella as other reviewers suggested. Wasn't sure what side pan to use but used a 8x8 and it worked out perfectly.

This dip is delicious! I took this to my moms for Sunday dinner and my family was raving about it. I followed the recipe mostly as written except I used marinated artichoke heart instead of can artichokes because that was all I had on hand.  I only used a 6oz jar because I did not want them to over power the dip. Perfect flavor combinations! I drained the artichokes first then minced as small as I could before adding them to the dip. I also, added about a 1/4 cup of mozzarella to the dip, mixed everything together then baked it for 25 minutes, then I topped the dip with more mozzarella to cover the top and baked it until the cheese was melted & bubbly (about 10 more minutes). Definitely will be making this again. It was extremely quick to put together and delicious!

This was a huge hit and I will absolutely make it again.  I mixed it all together  earlier in the afternoon, covered it with foil and put it in the fridge.  Then I put it in the oven about 20 minutes before my guests arrived.  The kitchen smelled great and everyone started enjoying it while I finished dinner. 
Perfect.

I didn't have romano, so just used fresh parmesan and also substituted provolone on the top for the mozzarella, but was delicious!  Also, I always have fresh spinach on hand and just fried it up in a little olive oil and used that.    Wonderful recipe!

I've made this dip dozens of times for parties and just something to have in the fridge. I've probably shared this one more than any of my other's and everyone LOVES it. I tend to add a little onion powder & Italian seasoning as well as a little more garlic, basil, and cheese ?? Sometimes I will also add capers, roasted propped, and/or kalamata olives just to give it a little more depth. It really is delicious!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was very good and easy to make. I substituted sour cream for the mayo but I think I should have used both, as the dip was a little dry. I WILL be making this again.

Delicious! Great place to sneak in low-fat cream cheese without being able to tell! I omitted the garlic salt because this recipe needs no added salt. I reduced the dried basil to 1/4 tsp, so as not to cover the taste of the spinach completely. Lastly, I added 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this exactly as written yesterday and made another batch today with adjustments to suit our particular tastes. They are both great! Big thanks for sharing!
To our personalized batch, I made the following adjustments: 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, juice and zest of 1/4 large lemon, an 1/8 cup more spinach, 1 T additional mayo, and 1/2 tsp more basil. The lemon juice/zest was a particularly good addition for us. This will be a Super Bowl standard.

I made this today for the Super Bowl, tastes amazing!! What I did different... I used a blend of Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano cheese, and added the mozzarella in this mixture. I also used mayo and sour cream because I couldn't decide which to use after reading all the reviews! Lol Oh, and I used whipped cream cheese for ease of use.  I love it!!

This was delicious and a big hit this afternoon with family. The only thing I changed was using two garlic cloves instead of one and eliminating the garlic salt and mozzarella. Oh boy, I can't wait to make this again.

First, I would like to say that I had given up on spinach artichoke dip recipes, because they would never turn out like the restaurant quality ones that we like.  A few years later, I decided to try again with this recipe and it didn't disappoint!  This recipe is delicious and so much better than any other recipe that I have tried in the past!  I did use sour cream in place of the mayo and used the marinated artichokes that come in a glass jar to improve flavor, which is maybe a couple oz's less than stated in the recipe.  My husband really liked it but wanted it to be a bit more creamy, which would be easy to tweak.  This had a great flavor and even though it may not be better than our favorite restaurant version, it came pretty darn close to it for an at home recipe.  Thank you for sharing your recipe and bringing the hope back that I can make a good restaurant quality spinach artichoke dip at home now!  UPDATE:  I made this again with a few tweaks.  To make it creamier, I added in an extra half  of a block of cream cheese, only used half the amount of artichokes, and did a 50/50 mixture of mayo and sour cream.  I also topped with swiss cheese along with the mozzarella.  THIS way came out absolutely perfect for us and is the combo I will use in the future.  Thank you again for the recipe!  It is the best spinach artichoke dip ever!!

This was WONDERFUL! The only thing I skipped, was the basil, because I did not have any. And it made no difference. This was the perfect amount of creamy, and perfect amount of artichoke. I also used the entire package of spinach. 1/2 cup was barely anything... It does make a difference in (better) consistency using more greens. I will definitely be making this again, it was a huge hit & gone before everything else!

Made it according to the recipe, and the parmesan/romano flavors overpowered the dip.  Plus, it was very thick.  I won't be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe, though.

I made this in my little crock pot and it was quite good.  It isn't quite as good as other artichoke and spinach dips I've had, so I will continue to test different recipes. Still, we all enjoyed it quite a bit!

Took the suggestions of others and used sour cream instead of mayo.

This dip was wonderful.  I made it in a crock pot and set it on the appetizer table--it was all gone in a short time.

Yum!! This was SO good! After reading a few reviews, I did substitute sour cream for the mayo, mixed the mozzarella in instead of putting it on top, and omitted the herbs. It was delicious and will become one of my staples I make regularly!!

This was great!  I did as many other reviewers suggested.  I used whipped cream cheese, sour cream rather than mayo, extra garlic (minced), and very little mozzarella on top.  We served it with thinly sliced baguettes.  It really was better than any other spinach artichoke dip we've had, including restaurants.

Very Good! Everyone loved this dip.  Mixed up everything together baked in oven for 15 minutes then put in crockpot on Low. Served with sliced thin french bread and tortilla chips.   As most others, I used sour cream instead of mayo and used whipped cream cheese.  Followed recipe except for items I didn't have:  For romano used mix of shredded parm and mozzarella to make up the 1/4 cup, 1 and 1/2 cups chopped fresh spinach (just chopped out of bag, stems and all), 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder instead of garlic salt, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper,  1/4 teaspoon salt.  Skipped the basil. Yum!!!

Tried out this recipe for the first time yesterday for our annual Christmas Eve dinner and it was a great hit! Everyone kept going for more! I took others advice and replaced the mayo for sour cream. I also only used spinach as I have never worked with artichokes before and was a little worried. Lastly, I added a couple of splashes of Frank's red hot sauce into the mixture for that extra kick, as my family loves heat/spice. Served this with toasted bread triangles. Will definitely be making this again!

You can tweak it a little, but this is great.

It was really delicious - had many compliments.  I would have liked it to be more creamy.  As it cools, it started to thicken very quickly.  Will definitely make again but next time will add a bit of cream to it.

I've made this recipe about a dozen times now and it has consistently delicious results! I took other reviewers suggestions and use sour cream instead of mayo. I also buy the pre-shredded "Italian blend" cheese instead of buying three different blocks. I always make a double or triple batch so I have to cook it much longer. For parties, I have made it in a small slow cooker, taken the ceramic insert out of the slowcooker and baked it in the oven, and then put the insert back into the slow cooker and set it to low and it has been fine sitting on the table for a few hours! It's always a hit and has become my "go to" appetizer!

It was great!  The only change I made was to increase the amount of spinach and decrease the amount of artichoke.

Wow, wow. Never going to buy again as I will make my own and you have cheeses and ingredients leftover (except cream cheese and the artichokes) to make more. Also for the Romano I bought a parmesan, Romano cheese blend in the aisle where you find the containers of parmesan cheese. The blend comes in the same type of container. I did what the others suggested and used the sour cream instead of mayo. This was sooooo good and yummy! Def now a family favorite. My fiancé and daughter wouldn't stop raving over it. Goes great on Ritz crackers and ate it while waiting on pizza to arrive. Would also go well with pita bread or even a homemade pizza.

This was good,  but I thought it was a little dry. I like it a little creamier so next time I will use 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream and follow the rest of recipe.  I like my spinach dip with a side of salsa and tortilla chips!

Not bad, it just didn't stretch. I think my husband wanted it more creamier or soupier. The flavor was good. I think adding sour cream may can stretch it more. But not a bad recipe at all!!

Like others, I substituted sour cream for the mayo.  I also used all Parm instead of the Parm and Romano combo.  I wanted to use up the full 10 oz package of frozen chopped spinach, so I upped the amounts of sour cream, Parm, and Mozzarella to compensate (I added the Mozz in the mix and didn't put it on top).  The addition of the basil was intriguing.  I like this one more than other similar recipes from this site.

It was good, as any recipe with these ingredients will be but I must admit I wasn't blown away. I'll probably try a different recipe next time... or maybe just add some spice to this one.

Very tasty.  I always sneak in more spinach and cut back on the garlic salt.  I do, however, add garlic powder; I find that the cheeses add enough saltiness to the dish, as do the tortilla chips that I serve it with.

Just made it today, in fact, I'm eating it as I write this. It's creamy and hot, and I love it. I took some advice by other comments about using sour cream instead of mayo (no brainer from me because I hate mayonnaise). I also took advice on using more garlic, (someone said three cloves--I used two) and that was a mistake. Use only one!

I am an artichoke lover (I eat it alone with just melted butter), but I hate the canned artichokes that are marinated...It makes it taste weird. So I cooked three artichokes and cut up the hearts for this recipe. I love the taste when I bite into a peice of the heart in the dip, just delicious!

Oh, and I also would use less garlic salt. And don't go crazy with the regular salt with the dish. I couldn't find romano cheese, so I used more mozzarella (fresh and grated it myself). 

Enjoy this lovely dip!

This was sooooooooo goooood! Restaurant quality, even though I substituted italian seasoning for the basil and garlic powerder for the garlic salt, I also used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese. The only thing I would do different is mix the mozzeralla cheese in the mixture instead of putting on top. Wanted to try it out before I made it for Easter this weekend. GREAT RECIPE!

This dip was excellent!  As other reviewers suggested I mixed the mozzarella in with everything else which was much better.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 glass dish.  Used part sour cream and part mayonnaise but I think next time I will just use mayonnaise as I could taste the sour cream a bit too much.  I love sour cream, just not in my spinach artichoke dip, I guess.  I also used jarred minced garlic and jarred marinated artichoke hearts for a bit more flavor.  Cut the artichoke hearts up even further with kitchen scissors to make them more dip friendly.  Baked at 375 instead of 350 for the same amount of time (it was pretty thick in the 8x8 pan).  Served it for lunch with tortilla chips and parmesan garlic herb pita chips--the flavor of the pita chips complimented the dip VERY well.  I will definitely make this again!

Just made this and I LOVE IT! Very easy to make and it tasted awesome. I'm a huge fan of garlic, so I added 3 cloves instead of one. Also, I skipped out on the basil since I didn't have any on hand. Definitely will make it again! Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!! I too used sour cream instead of mayo, only because I read so many others did. My grocery store only sells the marinated artichokes and my dip was still delicious. I also added the mozz chopped up into the mix instead of only on top, but then added a little more on top. I would say tops 6. Excellent!! easy!

Brought this dip to a superbowl party so I doubled the recipe. I did what everyone else did and used sour cream instead of mayo and also used fresh spinach since I always have some in the house. I also added a tsp of cayenne pepper to it---probably won't be doing that again though. A couple people said it was too spicy, although others liked the spice. Served with Triscuits and Ritz crackers, I think the Ritz crackers went better with it.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday along with 4 or 5 other things.  Honestly I did this one just as an easy addition.  Sure enough this was the dish that got the most positive comments.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was to put it in a bread bowl and bake it the last 10 minutes or so to crisp up the bread and melt the cheese.  People love bread bowls.

This is SOOO easy to make and has become a requested favorite at family gatherings. I stray from the recipe only in that I use 3/4 cups of a prepackaged italian cheese blend instead of the parmesan, romano, and mozarella cheeses.

good flavor but a little dry and hard. On second try, I didn't drain the veggies completely dry and added more garlic for more umph. Also tried sour cream plus the mayo, which helped a lot.

I liked this, but I found it a bit too salty and a tad too rich. That being said, I still ate it and enjoyed it, but I couldn't eat much of it before it got to be a bit too much for me.

For those who like a thick and rich dip, this is for you. I prefer creamier dip that is a bit less rich. I guess it's just a preference.

I seldom alter a new recipe the first time I use it; this one needs no alterations.  I did have to cook it a few minutes longer than directed and I browned the cheese under the broiler (watch very closely).  The family loved it!!

My guests loved this but I just thought it was ok.  I think that I can find a better recipe with more "zip".  Though I did substitute sour cream for mayonnaise as some suggested and perhaps I shouldn't have?

Meh, is really all I want to say about this. It's a little too thick for dipping tortilla chips into, but really tasty. I added some red pepper flakes to it to add some spice and it gave it just enough pop.

Very good! Doubled the recipe and used artichoke heart bottoms and regular artichoke hears with fresh spinach.

This turned out great, and was very easy! My only criticism would be that it is a little on the salty side (however, I am very sensitive to salt, unlike most people, so it could be that it is just me). Next time, I'll probably rinse the artichoke hearts first to eliminate some of the saltiness. I didn't add any table salt at all, and used a lot of black pepper because I love it. I also diced a roma tomato and mixed it in the dip, and as a garnish on top. I baked mine in a loaf pan, which was very easy and convenient to bring to the holiday party I was making it for. The 25 minutes was perfect. I couldn't find Ricotta cheese, so I just bought a Parmesan-Asiago blend, and used 1/2 c. total of that. I also just mixed the Mozz in with the dip, instead of as a garnish on top. Lastly, I garnished with more black pepper. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

It was good.  I substituted sour cream for the mayonaise, but then my kids said it tasted too "sour creamy".  We like it, though.  Tasted just as good the next day.  Ate it the first night with corn chips, the second night with baguette bread.

Amazing recipe! I used a mix of cheeses since I couldn't find the exact ones. The day before I needed it, I just combined everything in a bowl and refrigerated it. The next day I just microwaved it and spooned it into a hollowed out bread loaf I baked earlier. I baked it for a little while, but it would have been just as good if I had served it as it was.

This dip is sooooo good!  I made it twice this weekend.  My teenage daughters and thier friends totally obliterated the dip with tortilla chips and Ritz crackers.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is really easy to prepare and has a great presentation and texture.  A true keeper!

Been making this for years, and another great use for this is to use it on sandwiches!  It's great on dark rye by itself or with turkey or ham.

Pretty good with the suggestions of sour cream instead of Mayo and to mix the mozzarella cheese put into the dip instead of on top!

I made the serving size as 20 the quantity was not as much as I thought 20 servings would be. But boy was this dip AMAZING! Best one I had yet! I cut the artichoke hearts in very tiny pieces since I am not a fan of the big ones it was great! We used fresh cheese for it all and it tasted even better!

Of all the hot artichoke spinach dips from All Recipe, this is by far a favorite in our house.  I doubled the recipe for a football gathering last weekend, and it was the first thing to disappear!  Thanks for sharing this classic hot dip!

Absolutely the best spinach & artichoke dip I've ever had! I made it first for Thanksgiving years ago, and ever since then it has been requested for each family gathering! Now I make it for work pot-lucks, and it's gone before some people even get a chance to try it! My husband and I love garlic, so I actually add some extra garlic to the recipe, but it's good either way!  You definitely have to try this recipe!!!

My husband and I love spinach artichoke dip but this one was missing some much needed flavor. I upped the garlic since we love garlic but it still was lacking. Maybe sharper cheese?

This Artichoke dip was really good. I took the advice of another user and used 2 cloves a garlic. It was a little much. Next time i'll just use one. I also used sour cream instead of mayonnaise. I also mixed some of the Mozzarella cheese into the mixture. Overall it was a really good recipe. Next time I just need to try it with less garlic.

absolutely wonderful. hardly used any of artichoke hearts because they were so disgusting looking and smelling (never used in anything before ever) that I will omit them completely next time. this dip was still spectacular with just spinach.

This is wonderful as is!  Everybody loved it.  If more than 4 people eating it I would double it, it tastes awesome leftover anyway.  I added 3 cloves chopped garlic.  Easy to tweak to your liking, such as adding jalapenos, onions, Tabasco, or whatever.  I made it the night before and threw in the oven and it turned out perfect!

Made this for hubber's footie match and found that I love this version of the dip!!!  Sour cream is way better than using mayo!! I just added in a bit of garlic salt, salt & pepper to taste plus a pinch of basil.  And i gave the spinach a spin in the microwave and chopped them up abit before adding the sour cream, heavy cream and mozzarella just so that they're cooked through. It tasted so yummy that i had to stop myself before i finish the whole dish!!

Delicious!
In place of the garlic salt, I added in 1/2 a diced onion and a tablespoon of fresh garlic that were sauteed.  Also increased the parmesan cheese 1/2 cup (I like cheese!). Yummy! Will definitely make again.

YUM! The only thing we changed was omitting Romano cheese (didn't have any at home). Loved it. Mom thought it was too cheesy and creamy for her taste but still good. We love too cheesy and creamy so we wiped it clean in 2 days! Great with a glass of wine or beer for an afternoon snack while watching your favorite movie!
Thanks for sharing!

Tasty and easy. I think that I will use slightly more spinach and slightly less cream cheese if/when I make it again. Definitely would recommend.

Holy Moley, this is sooo good! Made this for Super Bowl Sunday and made it again two days later.  I too substituted the mayo for sour cream.  I would not change a single thing about this recipe.  This is seriously the best spinach artichoke dip I've had.

The only modification I make to this recipe is using fresh minced garlic (LOTS of it) and adding a dash or two of regular salt. I've also used a variety of cheeses, and while I usually stick to the recipe, if all you have is mozzarella, just use 3/4 cup of that and you'll still end up with a great dip. I always, always, ALWAYS serve with corn tortilla chips (for people with gluten allergies) as well as Dawn's pita chip recipe from this site.

Easy & yummy! We up the garlic (no vampires possible in this house).  If the mozzarella isn't quite browned, you can set the broiler for a minute or two to finish it off....tastes better than dip from Costco or restaurants.

This is an absolutely perfect base recipe to make any kind of artichoke dip! Last Thanksgiving, finding ourselves at a lack of spinach, my mom and I used napa cabbage instead--it turned out absolutely delicious! When using this recipe, I did the same (substitute cabbage for spinach) and used a little less cream cheese to take away some of the fat content. I also added red peppers & some hot sauce, as suggested by KittyFanatic. It was DELICIOUS! I had to cook it a little longer to get the moisture out--about 35 minutes instead of 25.
Because this was a gift for my mom, I threw in some finely chopped sundried tomatoes and dried cranberries because she loves both those, and the cranberries were sweet against the cheese. Good flavor combination. Awesome recipe to experiment with!

I love spinach dip, but had never had spinach artichoke dip. My sister-in-law raved about the spinach artichoke dip at a local restaurant, so I found this recipe when they were coming for dinner one night. She and her boyfriend both loved it, as did I! Great!

The hit of a party I attended. I also mixed all cheeses in at once, I used sour cream instead of mayo and I skipped the garlic salt (was out). I only used a small 6oz jar of art. hearts. Last of all, I thought it was a tad dry after baking so I added about a 1/2 cup of heated whipping cream to it at the end to moisten it up. DELICIOUS!

Absolutely delicious! I added extra garlic, but I add extra garlic to everything, so that's more a matter of taste. It got rave reviews when I took it to a potluck, and I found that it was delicious served warm or cold.

This is an awesome dip! I have made at least 3 similar recipes and this is by far the best spinach artichoke dip recipe yet. I added 1 leaf of fresh basil, a little more mayo and about 20 ounces of artichoke.

I have made this twice in the past week. Made as directed and paired it with goat cheese and fire-roasted tomatoes served over a bruschetta-type bread

This dip is very good. I used fat free cream cheese, mayo and skim mozzerella. I put it in a party crock pot and let the good times roll. Yum

This recipe was very good, but only because i read a lot of reviews, and fallowed them. I used no mayo, and half the cream cheese recomended. I also put 1/3cup milk in to thin it out befor i even baked it. I baked covered for 20min and uncover the rest of the way.. very good

Love it. With my own twist of course.  I doubled the recipe for a gathering. Therfore, all my suggestions apply to a doubled recipe.  I used 2 cups of tightly packed and well drained spinach. I  sub the mayo for sour cream as others did plus a few more dallops. For goat cheese lovers only, I added 4oz of "four peppers" goat cheese.  I used a total of 4 garlic cloves. Did not add extra salt. I also didn't add the artichoke because I forgot to buy it.  Following other suggestions, I added a dash of cayanne and a dash of nutmeg. I thought it still needed something so I added a dash of chicken boulion powder, lightly. I cooked mine in a slow cooker so I could adjust as needed.  I wound up having to add 1/2 cup of water. I guess I drained the spinach a little too well. Then, I took it to a friends house, topped it with bread crumbs and tomatoes and tossed in the oven for a few. I also served them with Pita Chips from this site. Perfection for me!

This recipe is delicious! I made one small change and substituted sour cream for the mayo as suggested. I took some to work the next day and it tasted great reheated.

Delicious! Just like the kind I get at restuarants.  I didn't put in the basil and didn't have garlic salt so just used garlic powder instead.  Reheats well also.  Serve with french bread or chips. YUM!

I love this recipe.  It is sooo yummy!  The only thing is I felt like it was a little heavy on the artichoke side (but I am not a big artichoke lover) so the subsequent times I have made it I used about half the recommended amount.  I tried making it as written the first time and it was awesome.  The next time I made it I tried to make it lower calorie and used low fat cream cheese, mozzarella cheese and mayo.  It still came out great tasting.

This was really good just as stated.  I think the only thing I did differently was I used a little garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  And, didn't add any additional salt to the recipe. It was a big hit. I would suggest doubling for a large crowd. And, make sure you really press the water out of the spinach.

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us, and wished I hadn't!  I have made several spinach artichoke dips from this site and this one was the tastiest.  I may have over cooked it, because it was a bit dry (not creamy) but definitely worth the 5 stars.  Thank you!

I've made this dip many times and it's always a hit!  The last time I made it I had to double it.  I only had one can of artichokes so I added a small jar of marinated artichokes. (chopped)  I also added some crumbled bacon for a bit of savory.  It too was a hit!

I really enjoyed this as well, however found it a bit too salty, I think next time I will just use garlic powder instead of salt and omit any salt addition! otherwise for my first time making spinach dip it was good, I followed the recipe exact, except added more spinach and less artichoke

Best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had, and that includes those I've had in restaurants!  I took some others suggestions and substituted sour cream (actually low-fat) for the mayo and it still tasted wonderful and I'm sure saved many calories from the dish. The basil and garlic I think add the extra kick to this dip that most spinach/artichoke dishes are missing.  Will be making this again for sure.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

Overall,  a pretty tasty recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it is far too rich.  I think I'll try it next time with sour cream instead of mayonnaise and I'll cut back on the cheeses.

Had company this weekend.  They really enjoyed this.  I read the other reviews and decided to mix the mozzarella into the rest.  I also didn't have romano cheese so I doubled the parmesan.  I will definitely make this again but will try with the romano  cheese next time.

The best dip ever!! I used sour cream  instead of mayo. I mixed the cheese in with the dip before baking to avoid a hard layer of cheese once cooled. My family,friends, and small kids love it.

I doubled all three cheeses and added one bunch of chopped chives for stronger flavor. Increase sour cream and cream cheese as necessary.

This is a great recipe!  I did make some alterations: I use sour cream instead of mayo, and also use 1/3 fat cream cheese.  I alos put it into a small crock pot instead of baking, this is easier for serving as well.  When using the crockpot, it usually take about 1 1/2 hours on high, I add the shredded mozzerrella bout 10-15 minutes before serving, cover the lid and let melt.

Definately not "haute cuisine", but oh so yummy!  Much tastier than any restaurant version.  My only modification was that I used an entire box of chopped spinach, rather than the specific amount called for in the recipe.  It tasted just as good the next day when I reheated the small amount of leftovers in the microwave at 50% power.      Delish!!

Delicous!  Added red bell pepper, replaced mayo (don't like it) w/ sour cream as per others' suggestions and mixed in mozzerella b/c I didn't want the crunchy topping.  It was a winner!  Thanks for sharing!

I added 1/4 cup sour cream, used 12 oz. of chopped spinach and Lawry's Season salt instead of regular salt.   I thought it was very good, as did my daughter.  Definitely will make this again.

I added a third a cup of mozzarella to the mix as well as a pinch of nutmeg and cayenne-it was delish! Also had to cook longer (more like 30 minutes) and eventually broil to get it browned on top. Will definitely keep this recipe.

This was my first time making a spinach dip.  I thought it turned out pretty good.  I didn't make it exactly and pretty much eyeballed it.  I also added a diced jalapeno to give it a little kick.

This is awesome!  I took it to a party over the holidays and everyone raved about it!  I am making again for Superbowl.  My 13 year old daughter loves it..don't think she knows it has spinach and artichokes in it!  I did substitute sour cream for the mayo and also added 4 cloves of garlic!  Delicious!

I used this recipe in a few events and so far it's a big hit. I used all Parmesan cheese and mixed in the mozzarella so it doesn't make the thick top layer.

I made this at Christmas, substituting sour cream for the mayo and completely forgot the dried basil but didn't miss it.  I baked and added two crab cakes to this mix to give it a little more oomph.  In-SANE!!

This is the best artichoke and spinach dip that I have made!  I have tried a few, but never was happy until now.  I followed the recipes except I didn't have Romano cheese.  I just put in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  It was perfect.  Thanks!

Followed other reviewers' changes -- used a heaping 1/4 c sour cream instead of mayo, used a bit more of the spinach (3/4 c) and it was perfect!

I love this recipe. This is the first time I have ever made Spinach Dip and I tweeked it a little...I added the mozz cheese in with the mix and on top and used sour cream instead of mayo like the other reviewer suggested. I would probably use less sour cream next time, but other than that it was delicious!! Yummy!!

This is really easy to make and tastes delicious!  I lightly toasted thinly sliced and buttered french bread for dipping... wouldn't eat it any other way!  It was perfect!  Even great the next day, too.  Will definitely make again.

Made this to take to a friend’s New Years Party and everyone there loved it!!! I used Italian Blend Shredded Cheese instead of the ones listed and subbed sour cream and minced garlic in place of the mayo and garlic clove. I’m too lazy to buy cloves of garlic. =).   I can’t wait to find a reason to make it again!!!

Wonderful recipe.  I mixed in the mozzarella instead of putting on top, and I put no salt.  For me there is enough salt in the cheeses.  Excellent!

This was definitly tasty! I'm not much on spinach or artichokes, but I enjoyed this. The cheese and sour cream gave it a diiferent taste. I didn't use mayo like the recipe calls for or yogurt like another review recommended. I just omitted it. It was still great!!

Fantastic! I use only parm, a bit of fat free sour cream instead of some of the mayo, and reduced fat cream cheese. Made a mistake once by using lower quality parmesan and realized that I love this dip because usually i use a high quality parm and that's what it tastes like!

This is the best artichoke spinach dip ever!!  I used sour cream in place of the mayonnaise and added a few cloves of garlic.  The last time I made it I was a little short on time so, I put everything in my food processor and it turned out great that way too.

This is the best Spinach and Artichoke dip we've found.  When we don't have romano, we just add more mozzarella and it still tastes great! Double the batch and it's enough to fill 4 mini loaf pans to take to neighbors and friends as a "ready to heat-n-eat" gift!

I made this dip for a friends baby shower and everyone enjoyed it. I never had fresh grated parmesan cheese or Romano so I just used the reg kraft parmesan and mozzrella cheese. I think it would have been fabulous had I had the proper ingredients. Will try again. Thanx

Rich rich rich (and easy)!  I used light cream cheese, fat free mayo, fresh spinach, fresh basil, some cayenne pepper, and a whole lot of fresh garlic.  Perfect for parties.

Delicious!  I used parmessan (didn't have romano on hand) and sprinkled a little Mexican shredded instead of mozarella (again, didn't have any). I also used minced garlic from a jar. This was yummy.

Very good and very easy.  Didn't change a thing, although I would bet you could use a low fat cream cheese and it would be just as good.

This was pretty good, but not fantastic, a little dry to me.  I like my spinach dips more soupy and this was very dry and chunky.  It tasted much better with bread than with tortilla chips.

Awesome recipe!!! So quick and easy! The only changes I made were that I used Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan because that's what I had on hand. Very similar flavors and turned out wonderfully. I also used light mayo and light cream cheese to cut down on the fat. I highly recommend this recipe. Even better than the previous spinach artichoke dip recipe I made from this site. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my wife because it is her favorite appetizer at Applebees. She said this was the best she has ever had. I used the dry grated cheese but next time I think I will use fresh grated cheese instead.

I haven't made this exact recipe but do make one very similar. I just wanted to give a suggestion of something I do when I make this dip. I saute mushrooms and put them on the top for say the last 10 minutes of cooking. We love mushroom and this dip so it is a perfect combination. I alwasy wish I had a second dish to pop into the oven - It's always gone before I get any!

I made this, as others suggested, using sour cream in lieu of mayonnaise, the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. It's good, I suppose, but I don't like it enough to make it again. It feels like its missing some flavour (maybe because of the sour cream?) and the texture was a little thicker than I normally like.

I always have to at least double this recipe when I make it goes so quickly!  I put mine in a crock pot for about 2 hours on high.  Once everything is all melted together i turn it to low and serve!  I also use shredded parmesan instead of the grated that is recommended.  It's always a winner!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and my boyfriend's Grandpa stood at the table and ate pretty much the entire batch.  I substituted plain fat free yogurt for the mayo and mixed the mozzarella cheese in with the rest of the ingredients.  I put it all in a small crock pot and let it cook until hot and bubbly.  I've baked it in the oven as well, but much prefer it in the crock pot because it stays nice and gooey the whole time.  I serve this with pretzel crisps instead of chips or crackers, I think it gives it a nice balance of flavor that way.  I have also used Wheat Thins and they are just as tasty.

I liked this dip a lot and it was a hit at the party that I took it to.  This was my first time making it and I decided to put the whole package of spinach in.  Next time I think I will follow the recipe and only put in a 1/2 cup because it was too thick and hard to scoop with chips with that much spinach in there.  All in all, a keeper.  This one will go in my recipe box!

I have made this recipe for many parties and everyone always loves it.  However, it is very garlicky with the cloves and the garlic salt, so I usually reduce one or the other.  I also always double the recipe because it goes fast!!

This dip is amazing! Enough said try it and not only will you love it your guests will too! The only thing I did different is use sour cream instead of mayo and I mixed the mozzarella cheese in with everything instead of putting it on top. So delicious I can't get enough!

I've made this type dip often and this has to be one of the easiest and best tasting of the bunch.I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Just saute about 2 cups fresh spinach with a litte minced garlic and oil for about 3-4 minutes on med heat. I followed everything else in the recipe.Great flavor!I wanted to serve it with pita bread triangles but forgot to pick some up. Tortilla chips did the job just fine.

This recipe is delicious, especially if you add a few key ingredients:  1. 1/2 diced white onion 2. 1 4 oz can green chiles 3. 2 dollops sour cream 4. 3 garlic cloves (instead of garlic salt)  The dip didn't quite brown the way I wanted it after 30 minutes so I put it under the broiler for 1-2 minutes. It came out perfect, and everyone thought it was absolutely delicious!

Very good recipe, although I found it to be a little too "chunky" and would have preferred a smoother/saucier texture.  Also, Romano cheese was difficult for me to find and a little on the expensive side.

Very good.  I used sour cream instead of mayo since so many people suggested it.  Other than that, I kept the recipe as is.  Simple, quick and tasty.

I too added sour cream to my version. I also sauted sweet onion, the garlic cloves and baby bella mushrooms in olive oil and mixed the rest of the ingredients into the saute pan and then put it into individual baking pans and covered with Kraft Italian 5 cheese shreded mix. It was spectacular!!

Amazing dip, made it at home, altered the recipe for creative innovations. used olive oil mayo, and topped with 1/4 cup of breadcrumb/mozzarella mix. A must for any party or appetizer choice! :]

This recipe, if you buy pretty good ingredients, will turn out just fine.  I used frozen spinach and frozen artichoke hearts.  I drained them really well.  If you want to add some kick... you could put paprika, chili sauce and some red pepper.  I like chopped red pepper and green onions on my hot dips. Overall it's a good recipe to start with.

Great recipe.  I shred my own cheeses but have used the powdery cheese stuff in the green shaker can, was fine. When I make this my family dips and tops everything with it, like baked chicken.  A touch of good alfredo sauce makes it extra sinful.

If there were 10 stars, I would give 11!  The dip was absolutely amazing.  I hadn't ever made a spinach artichoke dip before and I will never make a different one than this one.  Everything about it was perfect!  I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup mayo and a 1/4 cup sour cream, I used fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen, and used a 5 cheese mixture (provolone, mozzarella, romano, asiago, and parmesan).  Then for dipping I cut up a sour dough baguette and brushed it with garlic butter and toasted it in the oven.  Everyone loved it and most passed on the main course!  Thank you for a delicious recipe!

This recipe deserves 6 stars! I have made this artichoke and spinach dip several times, always to rave reviews. I do not change anything about this recipe when I make it. It's just as good or better than any dip of this type you can get in a restaurant. Beware! You won't be able to stop eating it!

So good! I took others' advice and used sour cream instead of mayo, and I mixed the mozzarella in with everything else. To go with the dip, I cut a loaf of French bread into slices, brushed them with melted butter, and toasted them in the oven until golden brown and crunchy. Perfect!

Truly a delicious dip.  The only changes I made was to add more garlic because I LOVE garlic, I used fresh spinach, which I cooked first and squeeze the water out of, and I added more mozzarella cheese because I like my dip gooey and not just creamy.  It was a big hit!  Thanks!

WOW!! Awesome! Huge hit! Could have easily doubled recipe and it still would have been gone! Everyone loved it! I did change a few things after reading reviews I added a bit of sour cream as well as mayo and just used garlic powder instead of chopped garlic bc that's all I had...turned out delicious!! Will def make again!

This was awesome.Very rich and flavorful. I substituted sour cream for the mayo as other users had recommended and it was great. I added more spinach because I like spinach but that is a personal preference. I also added 1/2 TSP of crushed red pepper flakes and it was a perfect "spice" without being spicy. I served with Bagel Crisps and it was a big hit! I will make this again, thank you so much for sharing it. I apologize that I changed the original recipe.

This is a great recipe...straight from the Olive Garden. I love copy kat recipes. So I would recommend this one if you like descent restaurants like the Olive Garden. The only thing I would change is to not add the garlic salt but maybe even roast the fresh garlic prior to adding to the dip.

Quick and easy.  My boyfriend asked for this dish on a Saturday morning.  By Saturday afternoon we were enjoying it.  I used the recipe exactly as written.  He has already asked for it again!

I used fat free cream cheese and 1/2 c Parmesan cheese since I didn't have any Romano cheese.  I made this for game night and everyone raved about it.  I'll be making this again.

I agree with some of the other reviews, I mixed the mozzarella in with everything else. I also added a little more garlic and pepper. It gave it a little more zest. I didn't have enough light mayonnaise so I substituted some light sour cream, and it was wonderful. Very similar to that in a restaurant, and really easy. Thanks for a sure fire recipe.

Yummy!!  I brought this to 2 events this week and both times it disappeared.  I had fresh spinach on hand so I steamed and drained it.  I Forgot to chop it but I think it added flavor that way.  Everyone thought it was great the way it was. I served it with pita chips which worked well.  This is a keeper.

I was hoping for this to taste more like dip you'd get in a restaurant, but it didn't.  It was really thick and had a different taste.  I think I will use something besides the alfredo sauce next time.

A good start -- however, I felt the dip needed a lot more spinach than the recipe called for.  Otherwise it's mostly just hot cheese with a few pieces of spinach and artichoke mixed in (which some people prefer, I know!).  I used 1 1/2 cups fresh baby spinach and still felt it could have used more.  Doubling the garlic is also a good idea!

MMM! This tasted just like it does in the Restaurants! I used mayonaise and it was terrific, but I am curious about the sour cream and will try it with that instead next time. Served with blue corn chips.. yummy!

This dip was pretty good, although it was very thick.  I added a bit of milk before baking to thin it out a little bit and it still was thick, almost more like a spread. Next time I would add more milk for sure to make it a thinner creamier dip texture. Flavor was good.

This is definitely a keeper. Don't look any further... I had an artichoke dip at a friends baby shower about 5 years ago. It was fabulous. When I got home, I searched and searched for the perfect recipe.. THIS IS IT! I've been making this dip for 5 years and I've followed the exact recipe, I've omitted mayo or basil or both, added red bell pepper more garlic etc. It still turns out wonderful every time. I do mix the mozzarella in and sprinkle a mixture of both parmesan and mozzarella on top.  The only problem with this dip is I can't stop eating it.

OMG! BEST dip ever! Nobody in my family likes spinach or artichokes but we like spinach artichoke dip. I was never gutsy enough to try making my own until I was asked to bring this to a Bunco party. I hunted for what seemed like the most liked recipe and came across this one. I used sour cream instead of mayo since most of the reviewers did this as well, and I added 4 cloves instead of 1 of garlic. (we are extreme garlic lovers!) I also mixed the mozzarella cheese in with the rest of the ingredients. It came out SOOOO good! My 9 and 12 yr old would eat this all the time if I'd make it (and if it was healthier I would!) This dip tasted yummy with everything we dipped in there: veggies, tortilla chips, crackers, etc. I almost wish it wasn't so tasty because I couldn't stop nibbling before I even left the house. This was a definite winner and will be a regular appetizer at gatherings...or just for a treat!

Sooo delicious!  My husband and I decided to make dinner at home for Valentine's Day, and I added this dip to the menu at the last minute.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and skipped the basil.  It came out tasting fantastic.  My husband even said it was better than what you get at the restaurant! We will definitely make this more often.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!  This is the best hot artichoke and spinach dip I've ever eaten, hand's down.  Followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Very easy to put together, very rich and creamy.  Served it with crackers.  Will definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing this with us!

I would give this 10 stars if I could! Everyone said it was the best spinach artichoke dip they have ever had. Even heard  it was better than restaurant quality. This is a must try! The only thing I added was a handful of mozzerella in the dip as well as extra on top. But other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!

This was very tasty and a hit at my Super Bowl party, served with tortilla chips - but I felt like it was missing something - maybe next time I'll try adding chili powder like another reviewer suggested. I used vegan cream cheese to cut down on the dairy, and it worked great; I think next time I'll try it with extra garlic and artichokes as I LOVE artichokes! Oh, should point out that like others, I also used sour cream instead of mayo.

I tried this recipe and love it!  I changed it up a bit by adding about 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce, 3 gloves of garlic, extra mozzarella cheese mixed in and a bag of sun dried tomatoes.  So delicious!

This recipe is great!  An instant party favorite!  Instead of putting the mozzarella on top, I mix it in for a creamier blend of cheeses.

This was really good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and mixed most of the cheese in the dip, left out the basil, and substituted sour cream for the mayo. Everyone on New Years Eve loved it.

Great recipe! I mixed the mozzarella cheese in w/the rest of the ingredients since I didn't want to have to try breaking through the cheesy layer once it cooled.  Also, I used sour cream instead of mayo. Only thing I have to really comment on is I would have like it to be a bit thinner.  My chips kept breaking in the dip while I was trying to scoop it up.  Had to use a spoon. But that's more of a personal preference I guess. Next I'll use more sour cream or add the water the artichokes were packed in to loosen it up a bit.

This is a must for my family. I make it for every occassion and holiday. It is always gone before the end of the night. I add a cup of sour cream for added cheesiness and a little bit more salt. This recipe does not compare to store bought and restaurant dips.

I made this last Sunday and got nothing but compliments.  I read other reviews and made these changes- 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and mixed the mozzarella in the dip instead of layering on top.  So good!

Mmmmm.  Very good, though very garlicy!!  Made it for New Year's Eve, and it was a hit.  It is very creamy and cheesy, if that's how you like it.

OMG...this is sooo good. I always get requests to serve this whenever I have a get-together. I took some other reviewers recommendations and use 1/8 cup mayo and 1/8 cup sour cream (instead of 1/4 cup mayo). I use 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1. To make it extra special, I serve it in a pumpernickle bread bowl, using the bread cubes for dipping. Yum, yum, yum!

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I used marinated artichoke hearts but rinsed and drained them well. I didn't have any left overs since everyone couldn't stop eating it. This is a keeper.

I make this dip exactly as it appears here and it is terrific! (although I do like spinach so I usually add some more). I take this to parties all the time and people love it so much - they always ask for the recipe.

This was pretty yummy, but not quite the taste I was hoping for. Definitely needs more garlic. Maybe a bit less artichoke for my preference. Definitely good, none-the-less. Will be making again with some changes.

This is the best Artichoke and Spinach Dip recipe that I've ever come across.  I took the advice of Rebec1120 and tossed the cheese in with the rest of the ingredients instead of putting in on top. Thanks for sharing this recipe Tiffany!

I found this recipe on Allrecipes and have been making this for years.  I usually skip the mozzerlla cheese and the garlic salt, add in a few frozen garlic cubes instead.  I have received more compliments on this recipe than any other.  It's a winner!

Awesome!  I added 1/2 C of Tomatoes (diced, drained) and used 12oz. of Cream Cheese.  Also, I was forced to get Marinated Artichoke Hearts, since the store was out regular.  It was a big hit at the party!

This recipe is wonderful.  I did add a couple extra garlic cloves(there can never be enough garlic) and I also added a half jar of diced sun-dried tomatos.  With the green spinach and the red tomatos it looked very festive.  The tomatos also gave it a wonderful extra flavor.  

Love it!  Will make it again and again for our Christmas spread.

Very, very good - I too stirred the shredded cheese into the whole mixture.  I also cooked this in my little Crockpot - took a little more than an hour to heat all the way through.  It does have a garlic punch, so if you would prefer less, I'd either omit it or scale it back.

This is hands down the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever tasted! Completely addictive!  Mixing in most of the mozzarella cheese and just sprinkling a little on the top makes dipping much easier (otherwise the cheese forms a hard layer on the top).

I took some of the suggestions of other reviewers: I substituted sour creme for the mayo, mixed in the mozerella and put extra parmesan and romano on top, and used about 3/4 cup of spinach rather than 1/2 cup.  I will definitely make this again, but I think in the future I will increase the spinach to 1 1/2 cup, because the cheese taste seems strong enough to handle it.

Yummy!  Needs a little more garlic and some hot sauce to add a wee bit more zing when it first comes out of the oven.  Also I didn't care for the mozzerella on top.

This recipe is awesome!  I loved how creamy and rich it was without being overbearing.  TIP - Substitute Dean's French Onion Dip for mayo.  Gives it a wonderful flavor, and everybody commented on the uniqueness and deliciousness of the dip!

Excellent. I used frozen spinach as it's already cut and easier. I agree with another reviewer to mix in the mozzarella cheese but still on top. I served with New York Style Pita Chips - Sea Salt flavor - YUM!!!!!! This one is hard coded to my recipe box.

This turned out great! I made it for x-mas eve dinner for my family, and it was a hit! I couldn't find Romano cheese in the store, so I just added extra Parmesan instead... Thanks!

Whenever I whip this up, people are making those “mmmmm”, “omg”, and “yummy” noises. The dish is always licked clean. 
NOTE: double the spinach amount or else its all cheese. Plop some cherry tomatoes on top after its cooked, they warm up become little explosions in your mouth! I also like to add mozzarella into the dip itself as well as on top. ENJOY!

I miscalculated how many people would be at the party and made way too much. THEY FINISHED IT! Everyone loved it. The only changes were no garlic salt, no romano (instead I added some feta) and I used 1 leaf of fresh basil and mixed the mozzarella in with the mix. Delicious and dangerous for anyone on a diet.

I made this for a Superbowl party, and have been making it for every occasion and holiday since!  EVERYONE loves it, at work it is requested for every function!  I did use sour cream in place on mayo.  And in general, I use low fat sour cream-cream cheese-and mozzerella.  And it still tastes great, with a smidge less fat!!

Oh my gosh!!! This dip was amazing! I made it for my sister-in-law's baby shower and everyone loved it! It was served with cubed beer bread. I doubled the recipe and put it in a one quart baking dish. The only thing that I changed was that I only used 1 can of artichokes in the doubled recipe. It did take a little while longer to heat up, but that was because it was in a smaller dish so it was very deep. I'll definitely make this for future parties! And it was even better the next day with tortilla chips!

Perfect! Easy to make and really creamy and delicious. My husband and I just loved it. Also a big succes with friends when they come over to watch the game! Try it with a little less cheese to make it less fattening.

This has become my go-to appetizer to bring for parties.  I throw the frozen spinach and artichoke hearts in the food processor to chop them up, which saves time and works well.  I've had many requests for this recipe!  It is a crowd pleaser.

i can't even believe i can make food that tastes so good! everyone said it tasted exactly like restaurant dip.

i, like others, also used sour cream instead of mayo. i also added a couple cloves of garlic in. i also covered it with cheese and baked it in the oven so it came out browned. my friends loved it and i had no leftovers. i'll definitely be making this again!

I have to give this five stars because each time I've made it, my party guests inhale it!  And so many people ask for the recipe.  I am not an expert on this dip, but family members who are say this is some of the best they've tasted.  It is very yummy and super easy to make.

GREAT...I went through two 8x8 pans of this in a week! BY MYSELF! I  subbed canned garlic for fresh garlic, added a dash of Worcestershire and a dash of hot sauce, gave it the perfect kick! New regular snack! And may I add it was a breeze to make!

I made this time exactly as stated. This dip was pretty good, but next time I would use only 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and leave out the Romano (or vice versa). The cheese taste was slightly overpowering and I thought that it could have used more mozzarella cheese mixed throughout.

Super easy and delicious.  It was the only thing at my party which was COMPLETELY eatten up.  I made it with 1/2 cup parm cheese and no Romano (didn't have it on hand) and it was still great.

Great recipe  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it but I may just use frozen next time.  I also didn't use the entire can of artichokes because it just seemed like a lot.  Definitely tasted just like in the restaurants!  A big hit!!

I made this dip for Thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE success!  I did substitute light sour cream for the mayo and it turned out excellent!  I've tried other artichoke/spinach dip recipes from this site, but I have to say that this one turned out the best.  I'll definitely be making again!  THANKS!

I highly recommend this dip.  I didn't have garlic salt, so I used Season-All seasoned salt.  I also bought a bag of pre-grated "Italian blend" mozarella, provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses - tasted great and saved time.  The guests at our party consumed this dip quickly, so you may want to consider doubling up!

Delicious!  I added some scallions and used sour cream instead of mayo, as others suggested. So good! Everyone love it.  Don't forget to squeeze the water out of the spinach.

I served this to guests one of which is a spinach artichoke dip fanatic, it got reave reviews including a request for the recipe from multiple guests. I added a little extra garlic and pepper for a little more seasoning.

This is the only one I've tried but it was really good. I wanted to recreate the hot spinach and artichoke dip from Ruby Tuesday, and I realize it is impossible to copy it exactly, I am happy with this. I made it a few months ago but I remember putting more cheese in it. I also didn't have romano cheese

This was pretty good.  It was easy to make, instead of chopping up the spinach and artichoke hearts, i put everything but the mozzarella in the food processor. I mixed the mozzarella into the mix instead of putting it on top, it would probably have been too hard to get dip out of if it had a crusty layer of cheese on top.  My only complaint is that the dip is super thick, a little too thick.  That may be because I mixed the cheese into it, though.  But it tastes really good.  I think the next time, I will add something to thin it out because I liked the cheese mixed in.

This was so good!  Just a tip though...  I doubled the recipe for a party and put it in too small of a pan.  It took forever to cook.  I should have used a bigger pan.  My fault!

This was really good. Even my 8 year old ate it after I told him what it was...normally he would stop in his tracks and run the other way. I didn't change anything and don't think it needs any changes. Although, I did not have any garlic or garlic salt, so I just used garlic powder. Still delicious.

ALWAYS a hit. I know it's not healthy... but it's amazing! Great for parties! Make sure to not skimp on the mayo and cream cheese. I think I made it once with light cream cheese and it was a bit drier than I wanted. This is one of those recipes where you have to commit to the fat.

I used light sour cream because I do not like mayo and I also added more cheese but this was delicious. The dip was gone before all of the guests arrived. I'll have to at least double it next time. I'll use this recipe for my spinach artichoke dip from now on.

This was a huge hit with my family. By the time I set out all the snacks and went to have a taste it was gone! I am making it again and this time I am going to double the recipe! The only change I made is I was a bit more generous with the cheeses.

This wasn't REALLY good, but it wasn't bad either.  I guess with all the reviews I was expecting to be blown away.
I served this at a party last night and no one mentioned anything about this dish either.
I think I'm going to keep looking for that spinach dip that really blows everyone away, this just wasn't it for me.

If there were more then five stars to rate this recipe, this would receive them.  Wonderful as is, but after using it a few times you can get more creative ... like more cheese, sour cream instead of mayo.  I have tried it both ways and it's wonderful either way.
Love it!!!!

This is the best artichoke and spinach dip i have ever made.  I usually have to double the recipe because it never lasts at my parties and even doubling the recipe isnt enough.  I get so many compliments and any time i go to a party this is the dish they always request me to bring :)  Definately worth a try, you wont be sorry.

Amazing!  I brought this to a Fouth of July party last night & it was hit!  Perfect just how it is written!  I did make two changes...I added another jar of artichoke hearts (because I LOVE them!!) and I added about 2 tsp of a garlic herb mixture called Garlic Spread that I bought in the spice aisle from Costco!  Trust me!  The crowd was around MY dish all night!

Very good flavor-- much better texture than some of the too-thick varieties served in restaurant chains.  I omitted the mozarella and served it with thin baguette slices.  I will definitely make it again--  several people at the party asked for the recipe.

This was really great. I liked the way it had both parmesan and romano. That being said, it was a little hard and not exactly creamy. The chips kept breaking off in it! I would suggest adding a little chicken broth into the mix so it is easier to dip/spread. The flavors are amazing though! Thank you

This reciped is awesome! I got sooo many compliments on the spinach dip when I took it to a friend's party on Friday. I didn't use artichokes, only spinach though. I used about 3/4 of a frozen bag of spinach (I believe 12 oz bag), and I should have probably only used half the bag. I added 1/8 cup milk and skipped the mayo because I didn't have any on hand, and it still came out really good! I will definetly be making this again especially because my bf was so amazed that "I can cook". Everyone I know loves Jay Alexander's con queso spinach dip and this comes very very close to it!!

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit. It's requested so much by family and friends I find myself making large batches and handing them out. 

Anyone who changed this recipe and didn't like it shouldn't be reviewing it. As all recipes on this site. I read one reviewer that used sour cream instead of mayo and gave it one star. That's not right.

I would lessen the basil because I like a more cheesy and more spinachy taste but this is by far THE BEST.
I WOULD NOT SPEND moNEY To EAT THIS IN RESTAURANTS ANYMORE.
it is better than the ones at restos.

This was really good but really heavy and could have used a bit more flavor. Following the other reviews, I used sour cream instead of mayo, but I did use full fat cream cheese (although I used a little less than recipe called for). I did not have basil, so I skipped it (possibly why flavor was not excellent). I also added a little milk per some of the reviews to loosen it up, and mixed in the mozzarella (part-skim). Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried a lot of spinach/artichoke recipes and this is definitely the best ever.  It is as good as if not better than any restaurant recipe.  This is going into my recipe hall of fame!

This recipe was awesome! I used the sour cream instead of mayonnaise and actually used one of those pre-shredded packages of Italian Cheese instead of buying all three types and it still turned out fantastic. We dipped the Simply Nakes Stacy's Chips in it and it was perfect. My boyfriend even put some on his steak! I definitley recommend this recipe to anyone.... and leave the artichokes...they add a nice salty takes to creamy cheeses!.

WOW--this was an excellent recipe.  The only thing I changed, in order to make it lighter, was to use 4oz fat free cream cheese and 4oz of 1/3 cream cheese.  I mixed the 2 together; I also used 'light' sour cream vs. the mayo as others suggested and since I didn't have garlic salt, I used 1 tsp of garlic.  yum!!!!  My husband and I used baked tortilla chips and enjoyed it.  thank you!

Very simple and the best art/spic dip ever!! Very delicious.  Mix in all of the cheeses and sprinkly a little of each on top.  I used half artichoke and half crab the second time I made it to stupendous success.  I also substituted sour cream for the mayo, as per other reviewers suggestions, with great results.  If you want some heat, add some red pepper flakes.

Suprisingly I did not enjoy this at all (I love dips). I think it was the cream cheese, I'm just not a fan of it! I followed the recipe as is except for using low fat sour cream instead of mayo. My family wasn't overall impressed either, I have had better.

Very good dip!!  I used sour cream instead of mayo as other reviewers suggested and used minced garlic.  I left out the garlic salt and doubled the mozzarella by mixing 1/4 cup in the dip and topping with another 1/4 cup prior to baking.  Wonderful!

My husband and I ADORE this dip.  I've served it three times to different groups of people and everyone always loves it.  I personally think adding the garlic salt on top of the fresh garlic is a bit much so I omit that part.  The first time I made it, I just used extra garlic but I thought that made the whole thing taste like garlic only (which some people love but not me).  I like some mozzarella mixed in the dip and some melted on top.  I also substitute sour cream for the mayo and add quite a bit of milk (about 3/4 cup) to thin it out a bit.  Because of all the modifications I make, I give the original 4 stars but it is a great recipe.

Made this for a march madness party and it was going by the heaping spoonfulls. We didn't have many people there, so I was left with one perfect serving to indulge in later.  I didn't have dried basil, but other than that I made this recipe as is.  So gooooood!!!!  And you can make it a bit healthier.

It is a great recipe however is a bit salty.  Parmesan and Romano cheese are salty enough for the recipe. If you like garlic, add another 1/2 clove of it instead of garlic salt.  I also recommend  1/2 the amount of mayo the recipe calls for.  It is an overall a great tasting spread rather than a dip.  I served it with butter crackers (keep in mind that crackers usually have salt on them).  It is creamy and has an over-powering spinach flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

It was just alright. It was too thick as others mentioned and it also didn't have a lot of flavor. Don't think I'll make it again.

Great!  I made this for a party and everyone loved it!  It makes quite a bit of dip, so you will have leftovers if you are only having a couple people over.

The best artichoke and spinach dip yet! Truley restaurant style. I also switched the mayo with sour cream and it didn't end up so oily after sitting out for a while.  I ran out of parm cheese so I doubled up on romano and it came out YUMMY!  I also doubled up on garlick for more kick. This was all gone in a matter of 20 minutes! Next time I will double the recipe so it will last longer. Thanks!

I mixed most of the mozerella in the dip and only sprinkled a little on top.  (I also used a lot more mozerella than called for!)  I also added a couple big spoonfuls of sour cream to make the mixture a little more moist.  I also rinsed the artichokes to get some of the marinated flavor off.  This is my new "go to" spinach and artichoke dip!  It was great!

Great taste! But I messed it up and after it was done cooking I left it in the oven and it came out rather dry. It was still good but less like a dip. I should have cooked it right before we needed it but I wanted to get it out of the way a little early. Maybe if I had taken it out and wrapped it with tin foil or something. Will try again!

This is the hit of the party.  I add extra garlic and extra spinach and this was spot on with a bag of tortilla chips.

To really make it perfect throw a layer of tortilla chips (scoops work best) into the toaster oven.  Warm chips + warm dip = perfect with beer for football on a Sunday.

Thanks, this was a good recipe to keep in my file.  After draining the spinach, I chopped it to make sure I didn't have stringy parts.  I used all Parmesan and also used smoked mozzarella which I mixed in before baking, and everyone really liked the taste.  It definitely made it more interesting!

This dip was the best artichoke and spinach dip I have ever tasted.  I used sour cream in place of the mayo.  Absolutey fantastic.  I didn't think anyone would eat it and that I would have some left over for a snack for another day and they were in there nearly licking the bowl clean!

I made this dip for a holiday party, and it was a huge hit! I have been getting request left and right for me to make this dip for every function you can imagine. I did substitute sour cream for the mayonaise. I liked it much better that way.

I made this for a New Years Eve party and it was a hit.  Tons of people asked me for the recipe.  Deeeelicious!  I used marinated (drained) artichoke hearts and sour cream instead or mayo (since this is what I had on hand) and mixed the mozzarella in with the dip.  I will be making this again and again until Richard Simmons comes knocking at my door...
Thanks for the great recipe!

While this recipe was good, I felt like it was a little dry and could use a little more ... something.  I think it was mozzarella.

Fabulous! Every time my friends come over to my house for movies, etc, the first thing they do is look for this.  I use real garlic and sour cream by preference, but I've made it according the recipe and it's out of this world. I also bought one of those 'Italian' cheese packages to make it easier. For those who've wondered: you can't make a low-fat version of this.  It was dreadful.  I used fat-free cream cheese, canola mayo, and a few tablespoons of sour cream.  It didn't turn out at all.  I just went running the next time I wanted this dip instead of wasting money.

Absolutely amazing!!!!  I took this to a New Years party and my husband ate half the pan as soon as we got there.  He said it was better than the restaraunts.  If you like spinach/artichoke dip, you'll love this.

I've been making a different version of spinach artichoke cheese dip for years, but this one is much simplier!  No more steaming the spinach first and making a white sauce.  Thanks!

very tasty, but just a little too cream-cheesy for our tastes.  i've used recipes with more sour cream and/or mayo - perhaps we would prefer a slightly different ratio for a creamier texture.  that being said, flavor was very good.

This recipe was delicious. I chopped the artichokes up a little before adding them. I still think that the spinach and artichoke should be chopped possibly even smaller. Other then that this recipe tasted very good.

Very easy to make and so delicious!  I was so sick of buying the Friday's frozen version when I had a taste for it.  The only thing I changed was adding more garlic and roasting the garlic first before adding it to the recipe.

My husband and I love the dip you get at the restaruants but they can get awfully pricey.  This dip tasted even MORE delicious than the others we've had.  The only susbstitutes I made were more spinach and using light chive cream cheese instead of plain.  Absolutely amazing!!

This was a huge hit at New Years party. Made as stated, but used food processor to "chop" artichokes and spinach to a fine texture before adding other ingredients. Thanks for this "keeper" recipe!

Was a huge hit with the family! Added a little extra fresh garlic for our tasting. Will be making this recipe for a long time. Thank you. I found this recipe in the Easy Everyday Favorites cookbook. What a great find!

Dip was good! I also would not add the mozzarella to the top, just makes for a very hard shell which was hard to break with a chip! Next time I will add it to the mixture. I also doubled the recommended cheese amount. You can not have enough cheese!!!

This recipe was a big hit! I also made some changes and took it to a family gathering and everyone loved it :) I used the following ingredients: (1) 8oz package cream cheese, (1/4) cup mayo, (1/2) cup sour cream, (1) 2 cup bag italian 5-cheese blend (2) cloves minced garlic, (1) tsp italian seasoning, (1/4) tsp garlic salt, salt and pepper to taste, (1) 14oz can artichokes, (1) 1lb bag frozen spinach. I mixed the cream cheese, sour cream, mayo, cheeses, and salts/spices until smooth, then i added the chopped spinach and artichokes. I then cooked it on high in my crock pot for 1.5 hours. I added more creams and cheese than the recipe called for but it made it very creamy and smooth and less chunky. I also added more garlic and spinach than called for. It was yummy and the crock pot kept the dip warm all night. There was none left!

Awesome dip!  Everyone loved it!  I grated my own fresh Romano and Parmesan cheese and it really made for a tasty dip.  I also finely chopped the artichoke hearts and increased the spinach to 1 cup because it seemed like there was way too much artichoke bits and not enough spinach.  This worked out perfectly!  Other than those slight adjustments, I made the recipe as shown. 

You can definitely make this dip ahead of time and heat it up when ready.  I decided to separate the mixture into two smaller oven-safe glass dishes so that I could serve it on two different occasions.  I stored one in the fridge, covered in plastic wrap and without the mozzarella, so it wouldn’t dry out overnight.  The next day, I put on the mozzarella and heated it up for my guests and it was just as good as the one I served the first night!  Very easy and super tasty!!

Delicious. I used others suggestions of using low fat sour cream instead of mayo and it turned out great. Maybe I will try creamed spinach next time for a little different flavor.

Very yummy dip!! I didn't have the artichokes on hand and it still came out wonderful. Gonna add them next time. I mixed in little chucks of mozzarella instead of adding the shredded on top and added more minced garlic. Delicious!!

I made this for an appetizer on New Years and my friends adored it.  I substituted sour cream, instead of the mayonnaise, and mixed in some chopped up bacon for a little extra flavor.  This is an amazing recipe.  Thanks so much!!

This recipe needs another review like I need another 10 pounds on my thighs!  Oh well.  I thought this was good; I added an entire 10 ounce package of chopped frozen spinach, which was approximately double the amount called for.  I understand people saying that it's "dry;" it's not as gooey as the stuff you get in chain restaurants. It was, however, very like the spinach dips that everybody's mom made when I was growing up.  I might try a different recipe next time just for comparison's sake, but then again, I might stick with this one!

This is pretty good, but could be creamier in my opinion.  Served it in a bread bowl and it was hard to scoop with the bread pieces.

Made this for our New Years Eve party.  One of my guests brought the store bought version of this dish - the TGIFriday's frozen type.  Needless to say the homemade version was much better and we ended up throwing the frozen kind away at the end of the night.  I used sour cream rather than the mayo as other reviewers had suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  Very yummy - but gave it 4 stars as it got pretty dry!

This is one of the best A&S dip recipes I have found. I didn't have romano cheese in the house so I used the parmesan and mozzarella in the dip. I also did away with basil and instead of the garlic salt, I just used more fresh garlic. 
I read the other reviews and did as many suggested; using sour cream instead of the mayo. I recommend the sour cream also.
I added a small amount of mozzarella on top before baking and it got nice and brown and bubbly, not hard and crusty as someone mentioned. 
I served mine with pita chips, fresh veggies and thinly sliced crusty french bread ~ I like to give guests options! It was so good, you could have eaten it with a spoon!

I made this for a dinner and got recipe requests.  My husband loves it and doesn't even like artichokes.

I didn't have basil on hand so omitted and it was fine.  I also added a couple of drops of jalapeno tabasco sauce for a bit of kick.

Yum - can't wait to make it again.

This was outstanding!!  My store was out of artichokes so I just used a whole pkg (12oz) of spinach and it turned out great.  We served it with Ritz and tortilla chip wedges.

This was good...but not GREAT. I was really hoping for FANTASTIC.  I split the mayo 50/50 with sour cream.  I did not have a hard crusty top either.  I used finely shredded cheese, don't know if that made the difference.  I think I prefer regular old spinach tip to this.  Maybe next time I make that...I will toss in some artichoke hearts! :)
Happy New Year...

Made this for my husband for New Year's Eve.  Needless to say he practically fought me for each bite, and he doesn't even really like artichokes.  I decided to split the difference and used 2 TB light mayo plus light sour cream to make 1/4 cup, and kept to the original recipe by adding good quality finely shredded mozzarella on top.  I did not end up with a hard crusty top as another reviewer mentioned.  Top was perfectly done.  I do agree with the reviewer who said to chop the spinach and artichoke very finely.  This dip was delicious, and we served it with sun-dried tomato Triscuits.  I have already emailed family and friends this recipe, as it is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was SO delicious! I used Tofutti faux cream cheese and light sour cream, and it tasted amazing. No one guessed there was anything weird about it, and it cut down on the cream amounts for those with issues. I will definitely make this again!

I agree with everyone else. I made it exactly as directed and it was a major hit at our family Christmas dinner.  Tastes very similar to what you get at many restaurants, but not as salty (in a good way).

I doubled this recipe because I was making it for a large gathering. My husband does not like a lot of garlic, so I added 1/2 tsp. of regular salt rather than garlic salt;  I did include  one clove of garlic minced as called for in the recipe.  I think the dip was a little too salty -- the parmesan and romano cheese are salty enough without any additional salt being added.  I will try this again without the garlic without additional salt.

Well, I followed some of the other reviewers advice and changed the mayo out for sour cream and added slightly more garlic. Tasty! I think I should have passed on sprinkling extra cheese on the top as it formed a hard "crust". Overall, pretty good - would make again, minus cheesy topping.

This was very good. We are not the biggest fans of artichokes so next time may just leave them out all together and just make this a spinach dip. I will definitely use this recipe again. Also used sour cream instead of mayo.

Made this only because it was the featured recipe, and I am so glad I did!  I only had 1 can of artichokes, but wanted to double the recipe, so I just doubled the spinach to make up for the missing artichoke hearts.  It is SOOOOO GOOD!  My sister and brother in law will be here in about 15 minutes and will enjoy it with us.

Thought this was great, I substituted Sour Cream for Mayo, but next time I will add a little more. I think the dip should have been slightly creamier, but it was a huge hit. I also omitted the garlic because we are not huge garlic lovers and just put a dash of garlic powder in.

This was really good. The only change I made was to mix in the mozzarella instead of just using it as a topping. Served with tortilla chips.

Just took this out of the oven and it turned out really well especially considering I only had 6 oz of artichokes.  I threw in more spinach, a dash of horseradish and some paprika for kick.  It turned out really well and very creamy.

While I can't complain about the flavor, the dip was heavy and too thick.  It never did bubble and I ended up adding some cream to make to more of a creamy dip.  Probably won't make again.  I was looking for more of the type you would get in a restaurant.  Thanks anyway, at least I know what to look for now when researching other recipes for this type of dip.

I must have done something wrong.  This dip had GREAT flavor, but it was "stiff", hard to dip chips into. The chips kept breaking, there were 30 people here for a party and this dip was hardly touched.

Absolutely delicious!  This was my first time making a home made artichoke dip and everybody loved it!  I mixed the mozarella cheese in with everything so it wouldn't make a crust on top.  Served it with sliced baguette....Mmmmm...mmm. I loooved it! This will be in my recipe book for a long time.

I love spinach and artichoke dip and I am always looking for a good recipe.  This one was great and easy. I made it for my husbands poker night and the guys ate the whole thing and wouldn't stop talking about it!

I give this recipe a 5 star rating because I followed the directions exactly and it was fantastic. I made it on Thanksgiving while everyone was waiting for dinner to be ready and it was gone in minutes. I served it on a soft baugette.

We had this on Christmas Eve.  It was so good, and it was the first time my 15 yr old son has eaten spinach in a ages.  Maybe I'll try throwing shrimp in there next time.

Pretty tasty, but I used sour cream instead of mayo because I find the taste of mayo to be somewhat overwhelming.

Perfect Blend! A new twist on 2 old dips. Everyone raved about it at my x-mas party. Had no leftovers. I will have to make again so I can get more than one chip.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It tasted just like what you would find at a restaurant.  I made this for a party attended by about 50 people, and this dish didn't even last the night!  The only thing I did differently was add extra cheese, but I am of the school of thought that you can never have enough cheese.

We loved this! I made it as an appetizer, and halfway through finishing it I mentioned dinner. At that point my husband replied, "Dinner? Can't we just have this?" 
Needless to say, this recipe is a keeper. Try it with blue corn and sesame tortilla chips for a nice flavor balance.

I made this for my sister's bridal shower and it was a huge hit! My only regret was that I didn't double or triple the recipe.  The only modification I made was to use all parmesan instead of parmesan and romano.  I think it would be delicious either way.

Delicious!  I substituted sour cream for the mayo and mixed in the mozzarella, as suggested by other reviewers. I doubled it and brought it to a party of about 30 people.  No leftovers and several compliments!

I enjoyed this, but ultimately had to add more cream cheese to get it to a smoother consistancy.  It didn't seem to bother my guests, who gobbled it up.  It went especially well with the salsa I laid out with it!

Delicious!  I, too, added the mozzarella in the dip rather on top.  It was very easy and really good!  I served it with tortilla chips as well as Triscuit chips.

This dip tasted great before baking but afterwards, it lost flavor.  I think next time I make it, I will add more garlic salt and more parmesan cheese.  I also added water chestnuts!! Yummy

Very good.  I teaked it a little, added some sour cream and used provolone instead.  I cooked it in a slow cooker and it was gone at the pot luck before it even started!

This tasted great, but ended up a little dry.  I even added milk to the mixture after reading other reviews warning of the same problem, but I didn't thin it out enough.  I also used extra garlic and black olives, which worked out well.

This recipe was tasty, but I found it to be a bit dry overall.  I like a dip that clings to food, however this one almost had to be cut into little pieces and placed on the food.  It was very cheesy and yummy, but I don't think I will make it again.

Overall this was a great dip - but next time I make it I'm going to exchange the garlic salt for garlic powder or just put in a clove of real garlic b/c we thought the dip was way too salty.

The flavor of this was great, but I thought it was a little dry. I made if for a party and everyone liked it, but for me I think I will add some sour cream. Apart from being a little dry it was wonderful and I will make it again.

Huge hit at a football party. Took a bit to get everything together, but it was all worth it.  I served with store bought pita chips, they were perfect.

This was good, but I like the "restaurant style" recipe from this site a little better.  To both recipes, try adding a pinch of cayenne & a dash of hot sauce for a little kick.

This is so easy to make and very impressive when people first taste it. I added extra garlic. I used pita chips to serve with it. I think it needs something thick and crunchy to eat it with. Better the next day heated up!!

Absolutely delicious!! The cream cheese base has so much flavor that you could also use it as a standalone cheese ball. I forgot to put on the mozz cheese until about 20 min left to bake, and it still came out great (maybe I had to extend the cooking time by ~5 min).

id you dont like artichokes, do worry, because this is packed with them!  i like 'em fortunately, but i also like my dip to be more creamy than this recipe - that is why i am giving it 4 stars. it is definitely a solid dip.   maybe next time i will use less artichokes...but it is still very tasty!!  thank you.

This is the best! I am not the biggest cooked spinach fan- went on a limb to try this for a party-- the whole dish was licked clean before the end. Kudos to the inventor- this is a recipe that I will be sharing- by request and will make again!

Who wouldn't love this? I've made it several times and everyone who tries it begs for the recipe. Try it with the Garlic Cheese Flatbread from this site and it's a hit. Also good with plain tortilla chips, but do try the flatbread, it's perfect together.

Delicious.  I used sour cream instead of mayo.  I think next time I would use half the spinach and more artichoke - personal preference.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it!  I usually skip the basil and use whatever cheese I have on hand.  Sometimes I'll use all parmesan and yesterday I used smoked mozarella for the topping and it was still delicious!  This dish also reheats well for leftovers, though there usually aren't any :P

I made this recipe as directed except for mixing in some of the mozzarella.  While tasty, the cream cheese overpowered everything else and it wasn't quite as creamy as the restaurant versions.  Next time I'll play around with the proportions and maybe substitute sour cream for the mayo as others have suggested.

Wonderful.  I used sour cream as sugested, but may actually use mayo next time just to see the difference.  I doubled the recipe and served with sliced bread and celery.  There was none left after the party.  My toddler loved it too.

Great dip! I also mixed in the mozzarella cheese. I baked it in a round, hollowed-out loaf of crusty bread, and served crackers and pieces of the bread   with it. Delicious-- there was nothing left to take home!

Very Delish - I would definately omit any added salt - salty enough with the canned artichokes and cheeses.

Creamy, yummy...just great!  We add a few dashes of hot sauce just to give it a bit of a kick, but it's not hot by any means.  Definitely give this one a try!

This dip is wonderful!  I made one batch and didn't think it was enough so I made another batch and mixed the two together and baked for 40 minutes.  I mixed the mozzarella in, added some extra garlic cloves and a couple teaspoons of crushed red pepper flakes.  I sprinkeled a bit of extra cheese on top.  I served it with tiny pumpernikel triangle and tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I won't add any additional salt to taste.  Will definetly make again.

I hate to say it, but after all of the hype, I was a little disappointed.  There seemed to be a ratio issue with the product.  The cream cheese comes off way to strong, so I would suggest using less.  It wasn't terrible, but I would not make it again.

I was so disappointed in this recipe.  I followed it word for word, baked it etc.  Everything seemed to stick together, it wasn't a nice gooey dip like i had imagined it.  Will not make again.

This was the recipe I have been looking for. I doubled the recipe and it was still gobbled up in no time. Everyone asked for the recipe and mentioned that they too were looking for a spinach and artichoke dip recipe like this. The only things I did differently were-omitted the dried basil and added the mozzarella cheese to the dip mixture and mixed that and did not put it on top.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! I made this appetizer as a surprise for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loved it. I didn't use any meyo (used sourcream instead!), I also used a little bit more mozarella chesse, + red bell pepper...turned out GREAT!:)

I have tried many Spinach Artichoke dips and this is by far my favorite combo.  I think it is the creamy cream cheese and the garlic/basil that set it in apart from the rest.

Took it to a BBQ with some friends and it was a hit! Added 2 cloves crushed garlic; used kosher salt instead of garlic salt; and an already mixed shredded cheese bag that had all of the cheese in it. How simple and delicious. I've already had requests to make it again.

A great dip!  I used more fresh garlic and less of the garlic salt.  Delicious~

This was an awesome dip. I did skip the basil and instead of garlic salt, I added fresh garlic(several cloves). I also mixed the cheese in with the dip. I am glad everyone in the house helped eat it- We ALL had garlic breath, but agreed that it was awesome.

This was really good and easy to make.  I've made this for two different occasions and have gotten many praises each time. I add a little extra garlic powder and mozzarella cheese to the mix. I also always double the recipe.

This recipe is easy for a novice cook and VERY YUMMY.  I had dips like this at restaurants but this far surpasses all of them!  I would highly suggested serving with lightly toasted french bread!  I have served this several times and everytime, I am asked for the recipe.  You can not go wrong with this one!

This recipe is awesome!  I brought it to a get together this weekend and it was a hit.  My husband, who usually doesn't like to eat anything that is green, ie vegetables, couldn't stop "testing" it before I left. I would definitely recomend this to anyone who's looking for an easy and yummy appetizer!

Excellent, Quick and Delish!!! I literally threw this together in just a few minutes and it was gobbled up nearly as fast! I did alter it a bit, by omitting the garlic salt, and just using 2-3 small cloves of fresh garlic instead, Plus I didnt measure the spinach. I just used a few big handfuls off the brick. (I have small hands) Even my husband who hates spinach and cream cheese gobbled this treat up!!

Oh, my gosh!  This is heavenly!  I put in a couple of extra cloves of fresh, crushed garlic, substituted sour cream for the mayo, and used regular salt instead of garlic salt.  I kept it warm in a mini slow-cooker and omitted the mozzarella.  I served it at a poker party with corn chips and everyone loved it!  I can't wait to make it again.  Absolutely delicious.

I did alter it a bit myself using 3/4 cup Italian cheese mix instead of the mozz, parm and ramono.  I also used 1/8 cup sour cream and 1/8 cup mayo. I think the texture is great for toasted sour dough but I would suggest adding a few teaspoons of milk if you will be dipping chips.  EVERY ONE loved this dip!

Wow...this is incredible! I put this in a slo-cooker/crockpot and it kept warm for hours. I did occasionally add a tablespoon of milk to keep it from getting too thick. This is a really rich appetizer but it is so divine that you can toss those other recipes, this is the only one you'll ever need!

This was pretty good- mine was a little dry though. I used sour cream instead of mayo- next time I think I will add a little mayo to make this creamier!  The fresh motz cheese grated on top turned golden brown and bubbly!  YUM.  I served this dip with crostini- just slice french bread thinly, brush a combo of melted butter and olive oil, and bake for 5-7 minutes at 450.  Will try this again with the added mayo.  Great recipe!

This was great - lots of compliments. Sour cream instead of mayo, definitely, and adding milk or something would prob help as it is very thick. Imixed more of the mozz in than placing it on top and it was great!

This was very good--I would just caution against adding the extra garlic salt until you taste it. It was a little too salty for me with the extra garlic salt.

I made this for a Super Bowl party last night, and it was gone within 15 minutes!   I used less spinach then the recipe called for.

This dip went over GREAT with my mother-in-law, who is a great cook. I used sour cream instead of mayo,1 cup more spinach and added the mozz. cheese at the last 10 min of cooking. I ran out of chips before the dip was gone and still there was no dip left!

i seriously ate half of this by myself!  i used 2 cups of drained spinach and didn't use mayonnaise, but instead added the same amount of sour cream.  i added the entire amount of mozzarella INTO the dip.  i doubled it and it made enough for our dinner group (16 or so) and i had leftovers.  the kids LOVED it!

I made this and I was a little disappointed. My guests loved it, but I was looking for something a little creamier. The parm/romano cheeses were a little strong for my taste, a little bit of a bite.

This was very good, although I overcooked it a bit so the top layer was too gummy. But it was so good that I'll make a double recipe next time! Thanks!! Oh, and I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise. Much healthier, given the awful oils they use in mayo.

Brought this to a "girls night" and it was the first app gone!  I used the sour cream instead of the mayo, but "pretty much" follwed the rest of the recipe.  Served it with french bread... so good!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I did think it was better than others I've tried but not as good as my favorite restaurant.  It was thicker than I prefer and more cream cheese taste than I usually like for this dip.  I am trying new things for an upcoming party and this one didn't make the cut for me.  I would have given it 3 stars but since my husband liked it, I gave it 4.

This is amazing.  It was a tremendous hit and didn't take that long to prepare.  My guests loved it.  Just make sure that your main course is as delicious as this dip, or else you'll let your guests down.

Fantastic!! I substituted sour cream for mayo & added more minced garlic. We were literally fighting for the last bite!  Franks hot sauce is a wonderful addition as well!

I made this dip for a holiday party and it was a hit!  Everyone really enjoyed this dip and it got better as I reheated it throughout the evening.  I used extra cheese and baked it about 10 minutes longer.

Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used low-fat cream cheese and Swiss instead of mozzarella. Tastes even better reheated. I like my dip a little thinner, so I think next time I will add some milk and/or sour cream.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  The cream cheese really adds flavor.
I pretty much followed this exactly as written except I used double parmesian instead of romano.  I also probably only used a 1/4 cup spinach as I've pretty sick of it lately.
I will definetely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic!  I used it as a guideline because I wanted more than the recipe made.  I used two packages of frozen spinach, 1/3 cup of light mayo, 1/3 cup of sour cream, doubled the parmesean/romano, used three cloves of garlic, and subbed pepper jack for the mozzarella.  It was wonderful!  It tasted great as a cold dip as well.

I think this recipe was decent but if seemed as if something was missing. It seemed kind of dry,if that makes sense.It wasnt as creamy as I would have preferred it to be. BUT...my dad who hates artichokes AND spinach tried it and liked it so go figure! Maybe my taste buds were just having an off day. I would probably try and make it again,just maybe add more mayo or something,and maybe cut down the cooking time a bit.

I hate to admit it, but it only took two days for my husband and me to eat every drop of this green goodness. Wasn't it supposed to serve 12??? LOL We ate it with tortilla chips the first time, but today we shall have it with a nice crusty loaf of bread. My husband is not an artichoke fan, but he ADORES this stuff. Great recipe!

This is DELICIOUS and easy.  It made a big hit with my family for Christmas Eve.  I eliminated the basil (because I do not like basil) and mixed the mozzarella cheese into the other ingredients. It was wonderful.  You could eliminate the the dippers and just eat the dip with a spoon, it is that good.  Will make this one again and again.

I brought this to a potluck with 2 baguettes, sliced up. It all disappeared fast! You can't have too much of this, though-- it's SO rich!  I used a full 10-ounce package of frozen, chopped spinach because I wouldn't know what to do with the remainder if I only used half a cup.  It worked out fine!

I recently made this for an office party & got great reviews, everyone loved it. I did make a couple of small changes though. I used 2 cloves of galic instead of adding garlic salt, mixed the mozzarella into the dip instead of putting it on top & added about 1/2 cup of crabmeat as well. This was an excellent recipe, I will definately be making this one again & again!

The flavor was excellent - I didn't know how moist I should leave the spinach and squeezed a lot of the water out.  So it was a bit dry - next time I'll keep the spinach moist, and see if the results are better.

Great reviews from guests of all ages. Only problem is it took 10 minutes longer than called for (35 minutes) to get sufficiently brown. I baked it in two different ovens and had to cook 10 minutes longer in both. Aside from that - no complaints.

I made this as written and it was SO good!!  It was the favorite appetizer I put out and went quickly.  Tastes like the dips you get in restaurants but this is better (I think) because it's chunkier with the artichoke pieces.

We're not a fan of artichokes....but we LOVED it. I Substituted Mozzarella cheese for the Romano cheese and it was fabulous. Also make sure that you buy artichokes packed in water....less fat. Great DIP. Will make again.

This is heaven! I loved it and I am not a big spinach/artichoke lover. However, it is so creamy and rich. I have made this twice in a month for family get togethers and heard nothing but praises--some said it is their new favorite! A real winner!

Although this was a good dip and my husband and I enjoyed it.  I thought it was a little dry and was missing something.  I'll have to tweak it a little next time to fit my taste.

This was a great recipe.  I cut off the top of a round sourdough bread loaf, cut it into bite-sized pieces for dipping, took the bread out of the middle then filled it with the hot cheesy goodness. :)  A crowd pleaser, indeed.

This was a good dip.  I added a little bit more mayo because I wasn't sure that it was creamy enough.  It turned out perfectly.  Even better the next day when reheated.

I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 1 and instead of 1/4c romano and 1/4c paremson, I used 1/2c of a shredded parmesan blend: parmesan, fontina, asiago and romano.  This was the best spinach dip I've ever had.

If I could give this more stars, I would!  This was SOOOO delish!  We made it for a dinner party appetizer, and it was gone....and that is during the e-coli spinach scare! hahaha  So that says a lot!  My 2 year old kept snatching the spoon and eating it scooping up huge amounts into his mouth! Thanks so much for this recipe, it is a keeper!

LOVE IT!! I made this for a bridal shower and everyone thought it was great. I will be making this for a birthday party next month. I did mix the mozzarella cheese and I sprinkled some on top. I also sprinkled the top with paprika for looks. This one is definitely in my recipe box.

Really great dip. Next time I think I'll cut down on the spinach, blend in the mozzarella before baking and maybe add small salad shrimp sauteed with a bit of garlic/butter/wine, but that's just preference. Thanks for sharing!

This is wonderful! I also tried the "Best Ever Spinach Dip" on this website. Way too sour. Stick with this recipe. I put in a little less Parmesan/Romano, and added more mozza (directly into dip). This was soooo good!

I've made this several times and it's always a winner. I do leave out the garlic salt and add more fresh garlic.  My husband also likes it when I add a finely chopped jalapeno.  Thanks for the recipe.

As good as Fridays or Olive Garden. I wanted to test the recipe before taking it to a Super Bowl party. I don't think I'll be taking home leftovers.

It's very creamy right out of the oven but does dry out a bit as it cools. I followed the recipe as is except used sour cream instead of mayo. I think I'll try some heavy cream next time and maybe one more clove of garlic.

Was equally tasty on toasted bread rounds and tortilla chips.

This one is definitly a keeper.

It is a great dip. I add some cayenne pepper to add more spice. Definitely one of my favourite recipes.

This was fantastic!!!
I only had parmesan and I put 1/2 cup of it and used cheddar instead of mozzarella, brought it to a new years eve party and it did not have time to touch the table before it was devoured.

This was the best Spinach and Artichoke dip i have ever had. I added extra garlic and instead of basil i used dried oregano. Simply out of this world! Everyone who tried it was equally pleased! I will DEFINETLY make this again.

This is the best artichoke dip I've ever had. I like to add extra garlic cloves and put extra cheeses on top before I bake it. I'm always asked for this recipe when I bring it to potlucks.

This is an AMAZING recipe ... I dont order spinach dip in restaurants anymore ... because they are never as good as this ! I usually add a bit more garlic ... but other than that ... it's perfect. I usually double it, because it disappears so fast !

I used non-fat sour cream instead of mayonnaise, maybe that changed the taste. I wasn't too thrilled with the results. It wasn't as gooey as I had expected. My husband loved it though. Maybe next time I will try adding some milk to make it creamy.

HUGE HIT at end of the year party for teachers!  I've made this three of four times recently and everyone loves this recipe, including my kids.  Only change I've made is to mix the mozzerella cheese in the recipe rather than having it on top.  If you use a lot of cheese on top, it makes it hard to dip.  Thanks for this recipe Tiffany!

This is dish is so good I have made it so many times before, but I have altered it a bit to make it a little more cheesier...if that is even possible.  I only put in a 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheesse, I add in one cup of monteray jack cheese and instead of putting the mozzarella on top I add it in the dish and bake it all together and oh boy does this dish come out finger licking good...thanks for the wonderful dish.

It came out very very yummy.  I made toast points from pita bread, and it was a great combination.  I've tried other recipies that were good, but this is the one I will be making from now on.

This recipe was very delicious but I agree with some of the other reviewers, next time I will get my artichokes in water. It does make a difference. It was so good though otherwise. This will become a regular!

This is the best recipe for spinach-artichoke dip ever!  Everytime I make it I come home with an empty dish because everyone gobbles it up!  It's not overly spinachy like some dips.

This dip was very good and the entire bowl was gone in a matter of minutes.  I served with small pita bread rounds and everyone loved the combination.  I couldn't find romano cheese so I substituted that for some extra mozzarella cheese.  I have made artichoke dip before and this dip is much less greasy and is just lighter in general, will definitely make again, thanks.

This dip is so delicious that even though it makes a large amount, I could eat it all myself!  (Actually, I usually do, because my children are too finicky to try it).  It also gets rave reviews when I take it to parties.

I made this for Christmas Eve. and for New Years.  It was fabulous!  Several people asked for the recipe and one even admitted it was better than her recipe.  Thanks for the advice from others to mix the mozzarella in rather then put it on top. Awesome dip!

This recipe was great! I added 1/3 cup of Monterey Jack cheese and mixed the mozzarella in with the dip instead of on top. I doubled the recipe because I wanted to have plenty left over for myself!! I will definitely be making again and again.

Made this recipe for New Years Eve Dinner and it was awesome. I served it with mini hard french bread slices and white corn tortilla chips. I also placed the dip next to the salsa and the two made a good combination together on the same chip. Reminds me of the restaurant Cooker spinach and artichoke dip.DELICIOUS!

I made this for my Christmas party. We served it with cubed rye bread and it was a big hit. I made it the night before, and just put it in the oven during the party.

Excellent!  It was a huge hit at the party we attended.  My preschooler and toddler were devouring it just like everyone else.  I didn't have any Romano cheese, so I just doubled up on the Parmesan.  I would have loved to use fresh-grated, but I couldn't justify the expense at this time, so I used Kraft shredded (not the powdery kind) and it actually turned out great.  I'm sure it would be out of this world with the freshly grated Parmesan and Romano.

I also had a hankering to put some Tabasco in it, but we didn't have any.  Someone told me they loved how spicy it was, but I didn't think it was spicy at all!  (I guess she was tasting the garlic??)

Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe is very tasty.  I wish I would have read the reviews prior to making it though because my dip did get hard from the mozzy as indicated in some of the other reviews.  Overall though - the taste is delicious and it is extremely easy to make.

This was delicious, and a little less fattening - no alfredo sauce. I used low fat cream cheese and low fat mayo. Delicious staple for a party.

This recipe is awesome.  I served it at a family function & got rave reviews.  My mother-in-law, who is an incredible cook (not to mention hard to please), absolutely loved this dip.  She was eating it by the spoonfuls.  I've never seen her so excited about food.   Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Defintely good... but not the best.  I was looking more for something that didn't have such a strong cheese taste, like applebee's.

NO, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH EATING IT RIGHT OUT OF THE DISH WITH A LARGE SPOON!  Absolutely wonderful.  I did substitute chopped broccoli for the spinach and added some FINELY chopped red onion.

The recipe was fabulous! A big hit at the party I went to. I added extra garlic and I didn't use fresh I used minced garlic. I also used a can and a half of artichoke hearts and added a little extra of all 3 cheeses. I would recommend this recipe to all!!!  I will definitely be making this again!

Extremely good! My picky 17 year old son (who doesn't like anything green) really liked it! I was surprised! Made it for a birthday party and the family loved it.  Added about 1/4 cup half-&-half to cut back on dryness and it worked well. Also bought the Italien Cheese blend and used a little more cheese than the recipe called for cuz we love cheese! Also topped with a diced roma tomato. Served with torilla chips. Next time I make it I'll probably also serve with dark pumpernickel bread cubes and celery. Scrumptious and tastes like a restaurant appetizer!

I tried this over the weekend and have to say it was the best dip I have ever had. I added just a bit more spinach. My husband hates this kind of food and even he said, "This is awesome"!
Thanks!!!

Wonderful with tortilla chips & crackers. It is creamy, cheesy, yet has texture.  All of my family and guests love this dip and always ask me for the recipe.  You will love it too.!

This dip is fantastic. It tastes just like a dip in a restaurant locally. My daughter always orders it when we go out for lunch so it was fun to make it for her over Christmas. We all enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe Tiffany.

I made this for company and everyone loved it.  I made it again for just my daughter and BF and we ate about half in one sitting-almost ashamed to say I ate the rest with bread for dinner the next day!

I have made this several times and everyone loves it.  I do add extra cloves of garlic, but otherwise I stick to the recipe.

My guests really enjoyed this.  But by the time I got around to sampling it, the little bit that was left, was cold.  I thought it seemed a little thick and dry ... likely because it was cold.  I even added more mozza than called for, and rather than putting it on top I mixed it right in.   Will try again, but this time I'll try it right out of the oven.

I loved this recipe! I made it twice over the holidays and everyone loved it. I followed the suggestions and used a package of 3-cheese italian blend grated cheese and put less cheese on top and more mixed into the dip. Some cayenne pepper would also be good for a little more zip.

Very nice dip!  Mixed the mozzarella cheese right in as suggested in a few reviews.  Served in a hollowed out round loaf of bread with bread for dipping.  Everyone ate and ate and ate!
