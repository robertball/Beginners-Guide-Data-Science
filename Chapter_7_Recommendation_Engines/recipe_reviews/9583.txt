This is a great Linzer Torte recipe! I tweaked the recipe and instructions a bit. I didn't have any almonds or cloves on hand, so I substituted with more flour, just a little more of cinnamon, and a splash of vanilla extract. The lemon zest is a MUST for this recipe! The lemon flavor comes out beautifully and makes the cookie stand out. I opted for the cut-out method and used star cutters. I had to tweak the flour content to get the consistency to where it wasn't sticky and/or falling apart. I also chilled the dough for about half an hour before rolling and cutting out the shapes. I raised the temperature to 375 as well since my first batch seemed to puff up and ruin the star shape. Spreading the raspberry jam was very simple. Remember to spread a very thin layer and use a quality jam. Top with a bit of powdered sugar, and they're the perfect gift.

This is a great recipe. I am from Eastern Europe so we made these growing up, but this recipe is actually much better than the one we had. The cookies are supposed to be dry when they come out of the oven, but they soften with time. That's why we always made these a couple of weeks before Christmas. The dough was very easy to work with and the cookies came out looking great. They didn't puff up at all. They are very tasty as well. The trick to get them soft faster after they are assembled is to put them in an air-tight container with a few apple pieces overnight.  Thank you for a great recipe.

These cookies turned out very very tasty, and only lasted a day in my house.  My only problem was the whole rolling out of the ropes thing - it just wasn't happening with my dough.  I did end up getting the ropes made though, but there's was no way I could roll them without the dough falling apart.  They were thus a bit time consuming to make, but in the end, the taste was worth it.  I think I may make these again soon.

These are almost exactly as I remember them!  I'm Hungarian and find myself longing for these exceptionally hard to find "goodies".

These are just great---and NO, they're not meant to be chewy or moist--they are exacttly the way they're supposed to be!

I just finished making a double batch of these cookies and I must say that I am very proud of my efforts.  The cookies are beautiful, and the taste is exceptional.  I didn't blanch the almonds, but I did toast them in a dry iron skillet before grinding them in a recently purchased coffee grinder.  The dough was flattened into a disk and wrapped in plastic wrap before chilling over-night.  I used parchment paper on my baking sheets and had no trouble removing them after they finished baking.  The cookies were fairly labor intensive, but then I think any rolled cookie is work!  I will be proud to include them on my Christmas cookie trays this year.

I thought this recipe sounded interesting but have to say I was VERY disappointed.  An avid baker, perhaps my taste is too picky, but I found this cookie very dry (following the recipe exactly).  The flavors were great but the thick crust, using half of the dough, really distracted from the result.  Perhaps a thinner crust, altering the amounts to make it more moist, or something else.  As I said, the flavor of the dough was GREAT, it was just too dry.  (Perhaps that is the way it is supposed to be...)  Thanks for taking the time to share your recipe.

These taste great! You just have to be patient and let the cookies soften. Many "European" Christmas cookies are quite hard after baking, but they're supposed to last longer, and usually get better, the longer they're stored! The dough was hard to roll out, but then I used foil to roll them and it worked. I used red currant jam - as in the real Linzer Torte. Give them a try!

This is perfectly delicious!  Everyone loves when I make this, and it is not hard.  I toast my almonds before I grind them for an even nuttier flavor!

This was a good linzer torte recipe.  I didn't think the dough was very hard to work with; I think it depends on how finely you grind your almonds.  I blanched whole almonds and ground them a handful at a time in a blender.  When I filled the blender past the top part of the blade, I got larger pieces of almonds.  This technique also seemed to work better with perfectly dry (after blanching and peeling) almonds.  As another reviewer suggested, rolling out the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap worked really well, too.  I made a small tart and about eight filled cookies with this recipe.  The tart took longer than 40 minutes to bake; 50 minutes with an egg wash was more like it, but it came out really well.    A note about the jam:  go ahead and spread it almost to the edge; it doesn't "spread out" like I thought it might during baking.    Overall, these cookies were a lot of work, but for me that is part of the fun.

Great cookie, a little more love needs to be put into these than most cookies as there is layering involved - Not that difficult to do though - Make sure to use a HIGH QUALITY FRUIT PRESERVE as that will make or brake them! Also would suggest taking the time to make cookie SHAPES instead of the cookie BAR variation, it looks much better and the edges won't get DRIED OUT or BURNT.

I had the best Linzer cookies at the Java Hut in Vancouver, Canada, when we lived there last year.  I was hoping these would be a good replacement for them now we're home - and they do come close.  They were very tasty.  The lemon, cloves and almond made a real impact and stood them apart from other normal cookies.
I have to admit that there was a lot of work involved.  Not in the making of the dough (which is a breeze if you have a dough-hook on your food processor), but in the cutting out of the cookie shapes (I was trying to go for the Vancouver format), the spreading of jam, topping with the cut out layer and glazing with icing.  I think for that reason I will probably not make them again, but will savour the memory of my Canadian Linzer cookie experiences.

I am in Kathmandu with limited ingredients and machines, but this recipe worked perfectly. I made it as a free-standing torte on a baking sheet since the dough could stand up at the sides and stay up through baking. I made the base by pressing it, and rolled out the other half and cut strips for a lattice. Sticky and breaking but doable.

I ground whole almonds with their skins in the blender; some were still in small bits and some were pulverized. I used semi-whole wheat flour since that's what I had; and omitted cloves since I don't like them. I didn't have exact measurements but the recipe came out delicious. I used our homemade apricot jam, which is tart, so one batch I mixed in extra sugar, but actually we liked the one with tart jam much better. A local Nepali lady asked me eagerly for the recipe.

These cookies are amazing! I substituted toasted hazelnuts for the blanched almonds and used whole wheat flour. The dough is tricky to roll out, but managable and it's worth the work! When making the cookie version, have a little bowl of water handy to make repairs to the crumbling cookies before going in the oven. The mending works and the cookies turn out nice and crisp.

1 of the best cookies I've made.  Delicious and look great. I substituted 1/2 the butter with equal amount of canola oil. At first cookies were too soft and smudging or crumbling as I tried to lift after rolling to put onto cookie sheet and bake.  Took advice of a few folks her and chilled for 15 min's or so, and that made all the difference.  Was then able to lift off and retain the perfect shape

Sprinkle with sugar and put in a cookie tin... makes an elegant cookie to take to a party... and they won't last long!

I love these bars.  I did not do the cut out cookies but made them in a pan and cut them into bars and they were so good.  They froze well too.  I can't wait to make them again.

After making the first sheet of cookies, working with the dough was so difficult that I swore I would never do it again.  HOWEVER after tasting one, I changed my thinking completely.  These are incredibly buttery and flaky.  Very subtle flavor.  I used homemade Austrian apricot preserves for the filling.  The contrast of the slightly sweet cookie with the tart preserves makes a perfect cookie.  It's all about the finished look and the taste.  Get over the fact that the dough is a bear to work with!

This cookie smells much better than it tastes. The dough is rich with aromas of the cloves and lemon and cinnamon. But when the cookies have been baked they come out bland and clunky. 

Also had a problem in making the individual cookie cutter shapes - without baking the jam this became a very messy and sticky dessert. 

I finished all the cookies I made, but won't use this recipe again.

I didn't find this hard to make at all, and I was very impressed with the dough!  I just pressed it into the pan, and for the top I rolled it flat and cut strips.  It was much better than the crumbly linzer torte doughs I've dealt with in the past.  The smell + taste are great too!

I make these every year at Christmas time for gifts and for my family.  I decided to try a new recipe this past Christmas, and this is by far the best one ever!  To make things easier, I used almond flour (or meal) by Red Mill.  Also, to make cutting out the cookies easier, I rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper, then stuck that in the fridge for about a half hour.  Cutting and transferring to cookies sheets lined with parchment was easy peasy after that!  They came out perfect, and had such a great flavor.  I used raspberry jam for the filling, first laying down a very thin layer of semi-sweet chocolate before putting jam over it, then topping with the cutout cookie.  I always sprinkle powdered sugar on the top cookies only before assembling.  This recipe is a total keeper!!!

They were excellent! My whole family loved the flavour. I cut them a bit large though, next time I will use a smaller cutter and roll the dough a little thinner.

Great flavour and easy to bake. My son keeps asking if I can bake some more for him to take to school. Teachers love them too.!

These cookies were great! I made them in star shapes with a smaller star cut out of the top cookie. I let them sit over night and served them the next day and they were even better because the cookie absorbed the jam. They were so good!

Very labor intensive; however, the results are the best ever.  They are best around the Holidays.  Have a best friend give you a hand.

For some reason, didn't work out for me, maybe because of my margarine substitution.

These make very pretty cookies, however the flavor was not as profound as I would have liked.  I expected more of a lemon flavor which did not come through despite the extra lemon zest that I used.  Also, the dough was very sticky and difficult to roll.  Overall, they look better than they taste.  I won't be adding this to my regular Christmas cookie list.

I had to modify this a little due to last minute ingredient shopping.  No almonds to be had so I used cashews instead; I also didn't have cloves so I added extra cinnamon. I had a very difficult time with this dough, maybe I should have chilled it. Like some other reviewers, I ended up with some very tasty thumbprint cookies sprinkled w/ some powdered sugar. My husband was a little iffy on taste, but I made them as a gift and the they were well received.

These cookies are one of our family's favorites. They are a lot of work, so I have to dole them out one by one so they aren't inhaled in one sitting.

I find most importantly, once the cookies are assembled, let them sit covered in an airtight container for three days. This allows them to soften and the flavors to mellow. They won't taste that great immediately, but in 3 days check back. Yum!

Excellent recipe, dough was easy to work with, baked results are perfect.  The almond and spices in the cookies have the authentic taste I was hoping for.  I have tried several variations on this recipe and this one is my favorite.  It has the taste of your favorite Austrian bakery.  This one goes into my permanent, make it every year,  file.
