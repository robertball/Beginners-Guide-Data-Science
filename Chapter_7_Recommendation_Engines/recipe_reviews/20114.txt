This recipe was so easy and delicious! The sole pieces that I purchased were small so I didn't make roll ups, but rather lined the pan with one layer, added the stuffing and then topped it with another layer...it worked well.

This was really good!  I used green onion, and threw in some minced celery and fresh garlic in at the same time as the onion.  Because of the fresh garlic, I omitted the garlic powder.  I used half crab, half shrimp (the tiny shrimp in a can) - a great combo!  I used tilapia because I couldn't get sole, and it was delish.  I think any flat white mild fish would be fine.  I actually did not sprinkle with lemon or parm because instead I used the lemon-butter-garlic sauce from the "Sole in Butter Sauce" on this website - I poured a thin layer of the sauce into the baking dish, put the fish roll-ups on top, and then drizzled with more sauce.  It tasted heavenly, but I found that the stuffing was a little mushy in the middle.  Next time I might try laying the fish in the pan FLAT, and then spreading the stuffing on top instead of rolling it up.  I will make this again.

I live in Maine so I made the recipe with haddock. I have had recipes similar to this one but this is the best I have ever had.  It is a little work but it is well worth it.  Serve it to company they will be very much impressed. Delicious and mouth watering.  You have got to try it.  Sally

I stuck the fish in the pan and topped with the cracker mixture rather than rolling up, since I'm lazy, but they were super yummy.   I omitted the cheese, used dill instead of parsley, and butter and garlic ritz crackers to give it a bit more flavor.   Even my six year old who who is a professed fish hater told me, "Well, maybe this is the one kind of fish I do like"   That's good enough for me!

World's Pickiest Eater (aka my husband) loves this stuff!!  Quite easy to assemble, but a tad messy.  In a pinch, I've also used ground stuffing mix (Stove Top) and that speeds things up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is easy to put together. I like tghe fact that it is so easy to pull together. It takes no time at all. My husband and I enjoy the variation on the standard fish recipe. The recipe modifies well, instead of onion, I used celery. It may not sound very exciting, but onion is a make or break issue in our house. The celery provide just enough crunch, and delicate flavor, to be added to my recipe book.

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: I substituted shrimp for crabmeat and water crackers for butter crackers. I put the raw onion, cooked shrimp, crackers, and spices in a food processor and pur√©ed.  I added about 1/2 cup white wine to make it moister and layered the stuffing on the filets.  I poured about 1/2 cup of melted butter on top and baked. I don't suggest doing this unless you like a strong onion flavor.  If not, better stick to recipe and precook the onions.

SSSOOO GOOD! this recipes is my boyfriends most requested dinner. The stuffing melts in your mouth. I used minced shrimp instead of crab, water crackers instead of ritz and since I live in New England I used Cod instead of sole. The cod is a thincker cut than sole so I layered the stuffing and then fish on top. This is a great special occation dinner.

I asked my husband and guests to rate this recipe and it was unanimously a 5.  Some of my fillets were smaller than six ounces, but did not overcook despite the fact that I added 7 minutes to the cooking time because some of the larger fillets needed more time.  Fish was moist and wonderfully flavorful.  I added a touch of cooking sherry to the crabmeat when I sauteed it, otherwise recipe was followed exactly.  Very good recipe.

I cooked dinner all week for my wife's b'day present.  This was outstanding.  I used all crab, I think next time I'll use half crab and half salad shrimp.  Made 6 rolls, recipe worked just great.  I used Dover sole, but it's obvious any white fillet would work.   I recommend taking the foil off for the last 2 mins or so, turning it up to broil, putting the cheese on then and letting it brown and crisp up just a tad.  This is a really easy recipe, not expensive, and really tasty.  Skip

Very delicious. I used red onions. I also added paprika, lemon juice, thyme, and white wine to the crab. I forgot to add crackers to the crab mixture, so I ended up sprinkling on top of fish. It still tasted delicious. I used very little butter and used olive oil to saute the stuffing. I served it with wild rice pilaf. Quick and easy. I will definitely make it again.

Wow-loved it! Super easy & great flavor! Used green onions & minced garlic & decreased the lemon juice by just lightly sprinkling a little over the top(just not a big lemon fan). I divided the parmesan & put some right in w/the crab stuffing & sprinkled some over the rolls before baking. I'll def be making this again!

Wow!  I expected this dish to take a while, but it didn't!  

Cut it in 1/2 for just the 2 of us.  I couldn't get Sole, so I subbed tilapia.  They seemed rather thick, so I decided to go the casserole route.  Placed 1/2 the fish on the bottom of a small casserole, layered stuffing on top, sprinkled with lemon/parm, placed remaining fish on top.  Baked covered for 20 min (figured it would take longer with everything in a layer rather than freestanding) then uncovered and sprinkled with crushed ritz/butter/parm topping seasoned with garlic powder/salt/pepper/parsley. (topping was out of this world, and I couldn't stop pinching from the bowl before I used it!) Baked 10-15 more minutes until browned - SUPER GOOD!  Hubby & 1.5 year old both had huge helpings, and it was approved for the menu rotation!

Prepared everything at lunchtime (keep in fridge), then baked for dinner.  Made dinnertime quick and easy with no cleanup!

A very rich dish.  I might try using saltines next time to cut a few calories, I think it would be a quite healthy dish that way!

I thought this was really, really good.  I used 1/2 lump crab meat and 1/2 shrimp.  Didn't roll the fish, just placed the filets (talapia) in the dish and put the "stuffing" in top. Tasted wonderful.  I'm betting that the stuffing be great as a stuffing for mushrooms.  I'm going to try that at the next family get together  This one's a keeper. Thanks!

This recipe was pretty tasty.  I tried to lighten it up by sauteeing my onions in less butter, using reduced fat crackers, and a small amount of butter on the fish.  I rolled them and like previous reviewers found that it was a bit time consuming and messy.  That being said however my husband liked it and my kids ate it as well.  I think next time I will experiment with a few different spices to kick it up a notch.

I used Butter Fish Fillet.  I seasoned them with black pepper, salt, garlic powder and put aside for about 30 minutes. I had no crab meat so I decided like a previous reviewer, not to roll the fillets but leave flat.  Used cream crackers, crushed, & dried parsley as I did not have any fresh parsley. I used the Parmesan Cheese in the cannister. Followed the receipe otherwise.   When the fish was done (about 15 mins.), I removed the foil to allowed the top to brown some more.  Got a nice brown top and crust around the edge of the dish.  The fillets were delicious.  My husband is not crazy about fillet, prefers whole fish, but my son's comment was try it.  It is really good.  He did, and also asked for another fillet!    I would definitely try it again, with the crabmeat .  I did not plan before for this receipe so I did not have all the ingredients  Just looked for a receipe, found this one and decided to try it.  I was definitely pleased with the results

Followed some other reviewers advice and sprinkled the fish with Cajun seasoning, used cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder and spread them flat with the filling on top.  Put under the broiler til lightly browned, and Wha la!  Delightful!

Very good and easy.  I used a can of crab meat and that was perfect for the 3 large sole fillets used.  Also used green onions for flavor and color and fresh lemon juice.  The fish did not seem quite finished after 17 minutes so I took the foil off and finished it under the broiler to ensure it was done -- and it turned out perfectly. I left out the butter as there was enough that melted out from the cooked stuffing mixture.

This recipe was fast, easy and superb! I cut it down to 2 servings. My sole was a bit small so I used two pieces with the stuffing between, and it was heavenly. I also used fake crabmeat and it was fine. This one's a keeper, and with frozen sole and crabmeat in your freezer would make a fast, elegant dish for unexpected company.

I thought that this would taste like fish that I often eat in restaurants.  Unfortunately, it did not.  Perhaps my sole was not as fresh as it should have been.  But the whole thing was just bland.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

This is still excellent even if you halve the butter (cutting down the fat content).  Adding celery or herbs is also a great idea, although we didn't and it was still awesome.  We definitely want to make this again soon!

I used Haddock instead of Sole, and it was absolutely delicious. Best fish dish I've ever eaten.

Substituted bread crumbs for the crackers and used pollock fillets. Spread filling on top and baked, did not roll. Excellent texture and taste!

This was very good.  They didn't roll very well, and it took a little longer to cook then the time on the recipe, but overall it was very good and I will make it again.

This was DELICIOUS.  We eat fish weekly and this is now one of my favorite ways to prepare it.  Our grocery store didnt have sole so I used haddock.  I used margarine instead of butter and instead of rolling my fish I just sprinkled the crumb topping on the fish fillets and then baked it uncovered for about 25 minutes. It was so tasty.  I served it with brown rice and steamed brocolli.

This recipe was truly yummy!!! I took the advice of the other reviews and decided to not do the "roll up" but lay all the fish on the bottom with the stuffing on top.  I did use all the butter recommended in the recipe.  This is perfect for company.

I obviously did something wrong. After reading previous reviews, I was really excited about making these.  I had to use flounder, because we couldn't find sole.  I followed the directions exactly, but they looked horrible and the stuffing tasted only like crackers.   I really hate to write a negative review, and like I said... I probably did something wrong.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I used flounder fillets and canned crab and it was fine.  Even my teenaged son who claims not to like crab was pleasantly surprised!

I had to layer this as my butcher talked me into trying some swai (sp?) fish.  Don't use that fish, it will not work!  The toppings are wonderful and woth trying again, with sole (sole is just so hard for me to find!)

I thought this was really good and will use the stuffing recipe for other meats as well. The only thing different I did was added some minced green bell pepper and garlic instead of the powder. My fillets were too small to roll up so I did as others suggested and put 4 fillets in the bottom of the dish then the stuffing then another layer of fish.

Just finished eating this for dinner & it was fantastic!!! I decided to do this last minute with some fresh haddock & cod my husband caught so I didn't have any crab meat. I was worried it wouldn't be good without it but it was great, will have to make it again with it next time I'm sure it will be even better!! I didn't measure anything just did what looked to be enough & it was awesome :-)

This was so delicious!  I had to use tilapia because I couldn't find sole, but everything else was as written.  I could have eaten the crab and cracker mixture up alone because it was so good.  I was asked to make this for Thanksgiving in addition to the turkey and ham this year.

My husband who is very picky liked this alot so I will make it again.  I used very fresh Tiliapia and instead of rolling it up I spread it on top of each fish. I thought it would be too much since I only had 3 Tilapia fillets but it worked out.  I had some left over but I am glad I made the full recipe. I also used shredded Parmasan instead of grated.

These were wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half as I didn't think I needed 12 servings.  I will not make that mistake again.  It was such a hit I will definitely make the whole thing next time.  The only changes I made was to use tilapia (because that is what I had on hand) and canned lump crab meat (I like it better).

This was amazingly good. I used shrimp and 4 tbs of fresh minced onion. I made the whole batch of filling, but only used 6 fillets and it seemed like the perfect amount. I salted & peppered both sides of the fish before filling since sole is kind of bland. I used shredded Parmesan rather than grated because I like it better. After it finished baking I removed the foil and put it under the broiler for about 5 mins. My family (even my very picky teenage daughter) could not get enough and asked me to make it again tonight!!

This was a huge success!   I did add diced celery to the stuffing, used fake crab, since that was what I had on hand, and made 1-1/2 a recipe of the stuffing to the same amount of fish.  I also used reduced fat crackers and a 50/50 blend of butter with healthy spread.  This will be made often!!

I made this recipe using what I had on hand, tilapia and shrimp. Rather than rolling it up, I put the filling on top with the shredded parmesan over it. Very quick and easy. Delicious! Definitely a family keeper.

I had only a 1/2 cup crab meat so I added a 9 oz bag of tiny cooked salad shrimp and I didn't have the butter crackers so I substituted soda cracker crumbs.  I also sprinkled some seafood seasoning on top of the fish since some reviewers thought the fish needed some extra flavorings.  Everyone thought it was delicious but my son suggested adding less cracker crumbs and more crab and I will do that next time.

We loved it! Had 4 sole fillets,Town House crackers  and a container of lump crab from the fresh seafood area of the supermarket.My only addition to the recipe was a generous sprinkling of Cajun seafood seasoning.  Divided the mixture between the 4 fillets easily rolled them and secured with toothpicks.I uncovered the dish, basted the fish with the pan juices and put it under the broiler as suggested by others for the last 5 min. Will make again but may use another type of fish. My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.

Delish!  I made slight variations...I made this more of a "fish bake" since I skipped the "roll up" part.  Placed the crumb mixture in bottom of 9x13, and put fish (I used cod) on top.  Bake 20 min covered with foil, then removed foil, squeezed a 1/2 lemon over top, & baked for 5 more minutes. I also chopped up a package of imitationn crab meat & used the whole thing. I will make this again.

I made this for dinner last night...I only had canned shrimp, so I minced that instead of using crab.  My kids hate onions, so I used onion powder instead.  This was yummy!  We usually eat haddock, but Dover Sole was on sale!  I only gave this 4 stars because we weren't big fans of the texture of sole, but the stuffing was 5+ stars!

I made this for dinner tonight and it is delicious.  I used flounder instead of sole and seasoned the fish with old bay seasoning.  I did not roll the fish and topped the stuffing with thin lemon slices.  I served it with roasted asparagus and rice pilaf.  My husband and 4 year old son both had seconds.

What an impressive entree!  I used haddock instead of sole, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.  OMGosh, this is wonderful.  I thought I would have trouble rolling the fish up, but it worked beautifully; I "patted" the stuffing on so that it would stay in place a little better while rolling.  I could eat the stuffing plain, it's so good!  I served this with "parmesan mushrooms" on top (also from this site), but wasn't in love with that recipe and think next time, I'll use another type of sauce.  Looked like a gourmet meal once plated.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

This tasted very good, but I hate using that much butter in a dish, especially fish, since we try to eat fish as a "healthy" alternative to other things. I used half the amount of butter called for in this recipe, and it still seemed like too much to me. The fish tasted great, though!

I have to give this a 5 star as my youngest son raved about this. I've been trying to find a dish to make him like fish. He said to the whole table "wow fish is really yummy" and proceeded to ask for more. I did do a half crab and half salad shrimp combo for the stuffing to tempt him. It was a little to buttery for my taste so next time I might cut that back or find something less heavy to keep it moist like veggie broth. I used green onion instead of regular as i couldn't see cutting into a whole onion to only use that much.

Easy recipe! We used orange roughy and, like a few others, we didn't roll up the fish. We just placed the stuffing on top of the fish. We removed the foil for the last few minutes to let the stuffing crisp up a bit. Delicious!

Awesome!  Fixed it almost identical to the receipe.  Used cod, instead of wrapping it, I just layered it.  Added panko crust on top then added the butter.
Let it broil uncovered for a moment when finished baking.

Very good!  I'm not a big fish lover (but love crab) and this was delicious! My husband and son both loved it as well and are always asking me to make fish for dinner. This is a definite keeper! I used Flounder instead of Sole, and that was the only thing I changed.  Thanks for such a great recipe! =O)

I used panko crumbs instead of the crackers and added more seasonings. I felt this needed something, so I made a nice white sauce to go over the fish. Very delicious and thanks!

Very good, I used it with flounder. Moist and good tasting, of course I used lump crabmeat, makes a difference.

Okay so it is not the healthiest way to make fish but if you are trying to get more fish into the families diet this is a good one to start with. You do need to cut down on the butter and you don't have to roll the fish up just put the stuffing on top of the fish and bake. Very very good. Even got my daughter to eat some.

Love it, love it, love it. So tasty and not that difficult to prepare. Have made this one many times over and will make it many more times! I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried parsley instead and it didn't lack any flavour.

I have to agree with the post concerning Maine and haddock..this is a wonderful stuffing to be laid on top of a fillet of fish...excellent stuffing but did omit, with haddock at least, the dots of butter on the stuffing....scaled it to four and used a little over 1 lb of haddock..also used 8 oz. fresh Maine crabmeat and can tell this would make a difference....

I used imitation crab meat (Louis Kemp I think) and got RAVE reviews for this recipe. I also served it over precooked parmesian rice  (I used Rice A Roni b/c it's easy!)

Someone suggested Talapia, so I tried it instead of the Sole and was not thrilled with it.  The stuffing is INCREADABLE I loved it and will make it with Sole next time.  I gave the recipe 5 stars because I am positive if I made it with Sole it would have been perfect!!!

Great recipe!  My grocery store doesn't carry Sole so I substituted with Tilapia and had a great meal that everyone raved about.  This will be a standard fish recipe in our house now.

Wonderful flavor...I added one finely chopped sweet red pepper and I used one can crabmeat and a half pound chopped cooked shrimp to the stuffing mix.  After reading other reviews, I also put the fillets in the bottom of the casserole and put the stuffing on top. The colors from the parsley and the red pepper made a wonderful presentation, I will definitely make this again.

Just finished this and it was terrific!  We used flounder fillets.  I love stuffed flounder and have never made it so I looked for a recipe that seemed right.  Like many folks, I just put the fish on the bottom, stuffing on top, then the lemon and cheese.  After it was done I stuck it under the broiler for a minute or two to crisp it up.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 olive oil and half butter, trying to get less of the "bad fat", used "crab delights" instead of real crab meat ($) and instead of any salt and pepper I used a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.  Will definitely make this again.  The only problem is that it's so good I never stopped to look at the servings amount.  So I put all of it on 4 fillets!  Kind of ruins the "healthy" factor when you eat 3x the amount you are supposed to.  LOL

Because of our small pieces of fish (tilapia), I had to layer this also, but it worked like a charm and was delicious. I also used the sauce from the Sole in Butter Sauce on this site and my husband said the dish "was money". (I love hearing that!!) Thanks for posting the recipe - we'll definitely have it again.

The whole family enjoyed this. I took the advise of others and layered instead of rolling. Also, used garlic and sprinkled a mediterranean blend of spices on top of fish too

This was awesome - and has become something the whole family gets excited we are making...although we do things a bit different - we dont roll the fish up - we simply do a layer of fillets, add half the topping or so and layer of fillets and finish with the topping on top - like a delicious Fish and Ritz cracker lasagna!  We also skip the parsley because I find parsley flavor to overpowering in a fish dish.  We do add different veggies to the saute - celery most typically, like others have suggested.

I made these for a dinner party and they were awesome!!! I cut down the butter to one stick and that was plenty. I also forgot the parmesan and it didnt matter. I used a cloved of fresh garlic and added a small can of chopped clams, and a dash of old bay over the roll ups before baking. They came out awesome!

Ok my husband made this dish for me for mothers day and since he has no idea how to cook this recipe is really bad for beginners. it asked for butter twice but didnt specify which amount at what point and left him confused and I having to step in to help! which kinda defeats the point of being cooked for! lol but it was surprisely a delish dish but if you are a person that loves bold flavor or a lot of flavor season the fish itself to taste. I used tilapia because its juicy but not fatty with a mild flavor which is best for someone that isnt big on fish like my husband and I. I give the dish 3 stars because it was delish even if you just stick to the recipe exact and I could really use this to entertain or a happy reoccurance on our dinner table. the reason it did not get 5 stars is because its not beginner friendly.

Edible but very bland.  We ate it but will not be having it again unless I come up with some really good modifications.  The presentation was pretty good - hence 2 stars

I used imitation crab and substituted italian bread crumbs for the crackers. It turned out great. I do think it could use a little more seasoning but can't figure out what is missing. Will definitely make again.

This was absolutely amazing.  I followed the recipe with very few alterations.  Used scallions for the onions and I forgot to buy the parsley so I used dried parsley.  Also used fresh garlic instead of powder.  This was definitely a restaurant quality fish dinner.  I wanted to practice it before making for company.  It passed with flying colors and will definitely be making it for them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband bought some flounder and I had no idea what I wanted to do with it.  I fell upon this recipe and "tada", he loved it.  The only difference was I substituted the crab for minced clams and he absolutely loved! It was a big hit and he wants me to make it again!

It was an ok recipe.  The crabmeat/ cracker filling seemed a little off, didn't really seem to go that well with the fish.  Still, it was edible, and it was fun making hubby guess what was inside.

I made this for my family last night and we all loved it.  This was my first experience with "stuffing" fish and I was pleased with the way it turned out.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used shrimp, cilantro & mozzarella rather than crab, parsley & parmesan.

Great recipe.  I have made this more than once now.  Mostly, I substitute shrimp for the crab meat as I usually have it in the freezer.  Good enough for an impromptu dinner party because it is so fast and easy.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe, I've made it a few times now w/ freshly caught flounder, and the one time I tried a different stuffed flounder recipe for company (Brian's Easy Stuffed Flounder), it wasn't nearly as good, and both my hubby and I wished I made this! Oh well, we know for future reference, this is THE ONE!

This was a very easy and quick recipe.  I used tilapia instead and it took about 20 minutes to cook.  I didnt roll the fish, but instead put the crab mixture on top of each fillet.  I think next time I will season the fish before adding the topping.  Very good recipe!

The sole baked with this mixture is a great combination which brings out the buttery and fresh taste of the sole. Great recipe.

This is an easy way to make some nice stuffed fish. I used chive, parsley, garlic, sage, majoram, salt and pepper to boost the flavors. The butter crackers add a great flavor.

Tasty & easy to make. Used fresh chopped onion, celery & parsley. A splash of white wine & butter on top with fresh squeezed lemon. Omitted the cheese. Have also mixed a crab cake with crackers when I couldn't find crab. Fantastic! Will add to go to recipes for any white fish, great with cod! As many others recommended layered mixture on top of fish and baked.

Used imitation crab along with flounder and ritz crackers.  This was easier than I thought it would be.  The flounder was thin so I could roll it.  It melted in your mouth.

Can we talk about how easy and impressive this recipe is?! It's great even if you don't have crab meat on hand.

Very flavorful and yummy!! I used Tilapia instead of flounder; other than that this recipe is added to my favorites! I had so much fun making them!

Excellent recipe!! My husband and I both loved it. The recipe was very easy and  fast to make with big taste. I substituted panko breadcrumbs for the cracker because I did not have them. It was delicious. A must make again!!!

Pull this one out when you have guests - this is an impressive dish to serve!  Everyone will love it, down to the pickiest eater.  I followed the recipe for the most part except I doubled the garlic and after rolling the sole and dabbing butter I also sprinkled lemon pepper across the tops.  I saw someone else say they added a dash of white wine when sauteing the stuffing - I think I will try that next time as well.  Definitely uncover the last 2 minutes or so and broil it to brown the top.  Scrumptious!  Thank you for making me look like a star chef!

This was delicious. My family loved it, including my six year old. The only slight modification that I made was that I lightly seasoned my fish prior to topping it with the crab meat mixture.

Extremely simple to make and tastes like gourmet. The lemon juice is so important and brings out the flavors sooo well. I added to the crab mixture though; some worcestershire sauce and tabasco sauce. I've tried it with sauteed peppers and onions and it was amazing. I will say that I didn't do the 2/3 cup of butter that the recipe asked for..I did maybe 3 tablespoons which works fine.

These were wonderful! 

Great seasoning and quite easy to make.

I used Fritos instead of round crackers because I had some left over that I wanted to finish up and they were a great call. My husband loved the crunchiness and flavor.

My oven's a little slow/light so I cranked these up to 400 degrees instead towards the end, added 5 minutes to cooking time and removed the foil for the last 5-10 mins to give them a little push.

Really just OK.  Needed a little fussiness to prepare, then the result did not wow me.

My casserole dish was watery after 15 minutes so I took the foil off and cooked it another 5 minutes uncovered. Very tasty. I think I might add mushrooms next time to balance the tartness of the salt and lemon.

Good, but I felt it needed more flavor. I even sprinkled Old Bay on the fish. I will make again and tweak it a bit.

Delicious! I couldn't find fresh Sole, so I used Tilapia instead and doubled the stuffing. I paired it with asparagus and a garden salad. Definitely a keeper.
