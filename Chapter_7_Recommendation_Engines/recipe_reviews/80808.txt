It's reasonably good, but why call it Pimento (pimiento?) Cheese when it doesn't contain any pimiento at all?

Wow! what a recipe. Soooooooo good and low carb too! I finely chopped 2 jalapenos (less seeds) to kick it up. Great on crackers or as a sandwich. Thanks

The recipe itself is good but it has two major problems.  It is NOT pimento cheese or at least nothing that I've ever recognized as pimento cheese.  That however is not why I docked the star.  I didn't drain my Rotel tomatoes (because the recipe didn't say anything about draining) and the end result is more of a dip than a cheese spread.  You should put "drained" after the tomatoes in the ingredient list.  I made the recipe as is mixing in a food processor.  We will enjoy this dip that is not pimento cheese.  I will probably make it again and will be sure to drain the tomatoes.

The fact many questioned this recipe does not actually call for pimento is moot, it tastes just like traditional pimento cheese only pumped up a bit (there are peppers in the Rotel, and it is a pepper after all!). It is DELICIOUS! I highly recommend making it 1-2 days ahead of time. I did not grate the onion but chopped it very fine. Thank you! I will definitely make this again!!

The first batch I made with the white onion and thought it was way too strong.  The second batch, I added a bunch of green onions, chopped.  This recipe goes together in about 5 minutes and it is absolutely delicious.  I took it to a work function and it received many raves and requests for the recipe.

I wouldn't call this Pimento Cheese but it sure is good!!  I used fat-free and low-fat ingredients when I made it.  Made it initially to stuff into mini peppers for Super Bowl but also stuffed celery with it.  Then decided to spread some on flour tortillas, fill them with veggies(peppers, cukes, grape tomatoes, sprouts, olives etc), roll them up and slice them for another appetizer.  They were a huge hit!  Will definitely make again!

This was an excellent and tasty recipe. I noticed that other reviews asked why there was no pimento in this recipe, and all you had to do was read what was in the recipe to figure that out. It was very good anyway.

07.22.17 ~ A delicious pimento cheese spread without any pimentos.  I laughed when I read this recipe, but made it anyways.  It is wonderful - try it!  The one sub I did make was to use plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I drained the RO*TEL® tomato mixture for about an hour before putting the dish together.  We liked the heat from the jalapeños in the RO*TEL®.  I made this for a road trip to KY for the birth of our first grandchild.  It traveled well in the cooler and keep for about a week, in the fridge.  Used the last of it in jalapeño poppers.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this again - in fact I'm making it for our first day of school 'snack' as the first day is kinda rough.  I will add some extra chopped jalapeños, because we all like the kick they provide.  A great dip served with fresh veggies, crackers, pita chips and stuffed in a popper.

This turned out delish !  I used a jar of Newman's Own Pineapple Salsa and doubled the grated cheese.   If you omitted the grated cheese it would make a really good salad dressing (ask me how I know.... we tried it).  Pineapple salsa has a sweet tang so be aware of that.
