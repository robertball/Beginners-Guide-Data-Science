Yum! This was fast, easy and very good.  My hubby kept raving. Didn't have fresh jalapenos on hand so I subbed 1 can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis drained and 1 large fresh tomato. It would be even better with all fresh ingredients. Served with cilantro brown rice, white corn and a southwestern salad.

I modified it for the grill, and it was really really good!! I also added in more vegetables that I like.  It was very spicy also, so I wouldn't necessarily feed this to kids.

My family did not like this dish at all.  Followed the recipe exactly.  They love the broiled parmesan tilapia recipe from here so guess I will stick with it!

My husband "mmmm'd" through the whole meal, ending with, "This recipe is a new family favorite."  Because he doesn't handle the jalepeno heat as well as I, I put the slices in the pan, but not on the fish. That gave enough heat for the spark without being too much for his pallet. Excellent!

I normally find tilapia pretty bland, but it really shines in this recipe.  Very much enjoyed!

Very light and refreshing. I kept the jalapenos in large pieces so they were easy to pick out, and they still lent their spiciness to the dish.

Rather bland for our tastes.  But don't let this stop you from trying it.  We just like more muscular recipes.

I made this last night.  It was pretty good although it was a bit too hot for my tastes.  I think next time, I'll just use one pepper.  Anyhow, overall, it was really good.

We did these like tacos. We breaded the Tilapia lightly, fried them in olive oil with tomatos, peppers, etc. Then made a mayo/taco sauce. We wrapped the talipia and other cooked ingredients in the wrap with sauce, lettace, olives, tomatos, and jalepenos. Yum!

Preparing tilapia this way kept it really moist. I'm experimenting now with other herbs and flavors on the stove top.

I didn't really care for this at all.  The fish just tasted like A LOT of lime and thats it.  The stuff on top tasted all right with it...I don't know why I didn't like it honestly...I just didn't.

Delicious use of tilapia!! Spicy, but very flavorful. Added extra lime juice during cooking and less olive oil to keep it low calorie.

Super quick and super wonderful. I have made this dish many times and my family continues to ask for it. I tone it down for the kids by omitting the jalapenos and sometimes adding mangos and avocados to the pan when I sear theirs. But as for the husband and I, sometimes we heat it up a little with a few extra jalapenos and tomatos. Don't pass it up, you'll be impressed.

Very simple and Delicious.  My sister, a "non-fish eater" gobbled this delicious tilapia up.  :D  On the other hand my father thought it had too much lime for his taste.  I loved the lime.  I was only able to marinate it for about 30 minutes and can't wait for another lent Friday to try it again.  Next I will probably also up the jalapeños and/or add some cayenne as it was not nearly spicy enough for us.

Family loved it.  My kid's don't like heat so I used cubanelle peppers instead of jalps.  I also added chili power.

I LOVED this fish. Only change I did was use a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the tomatoes, jalepeno peppers, and cilantro leaves. Served with Spanish rice on this site. This fish is so yummy!!

I may have put too much jalapeno for my own taste but my finance loved the spiciness. This was really easy and quick to make.

This was AMAZING!  The only thing I did different was add a whole can of Rotel tomatoes w/ green chiles (drained), and chopped the cilantro.   I added the cilantro after I flipped the fish once so that it wouldn't wilt too much in the pan.  Awesome recipe!  I will be making this again!!  Thank you for sharing!

This was so GOOD! Nice and healthy. I cooked it a little faster on Med-High to get a little better char. I used some dried cilantro I had recently dried and it was wonderful. since I'm not a jalapeno fan left it out and it was still great! served it with a fresh cucumber salad.

This was pretty good.  Not nearly as spicy as I would have liked though I did add some cayenne pepper to my second batch which helped tremendously.

My taste buds are screaming! I think fish is normally kind of eh, but I could eat this every day! The only thing I did was add a little green pepper and a little greens off the green onions. It was a huge success, thank you!! Oh, and 4 min. on each side... PERFECT!

This was good - similar to Tilapia Portugaise.  Easy.  A little soupy, I think I used too much olive oil and lime juice.

I agree with the other person who reviewed this recipe that this fish is some what bland but fixing it this way proved to be very good.   I'm also going to use it for catfish.

Really "picks up" an otherwise bland fish.

Yummy! Easy meal and pretty healthy! Both my husband and I loved it. It was a fun way to spice up tilapia during lent. I made one change I used a can of rotfl instead of diced tomatoes. It added a fun kick

My family loves this recipe. It is fresh and very enjoyful. We are a Mexican family and we love spicy food. If the jalapenos arent spicy enough we even have too add a spicier pepper(similar to habanero). This recipe is always a hit!
