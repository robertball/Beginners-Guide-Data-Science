Nice but a cooked pudding would be so much better and not all that much trouble to make. Try adding an egg yolk to the pudding to make it a little richer, and let it cool before filling!

Pretty tasty!  I forgot to put the whipped cream in the cream part, though, so it was more like pudding crisps.

These were nothing fabulous. I think a melted chocolate mixture of semi sweet choc chips and oil would have been a better chocolate taste than the hot fudge. The pastry toughened a bit after being in the fridge. I would opt for another dessert before making this again.

These were delicious and a big hit with my whole family!  I recommend baking the pastry shortly before serving.  I pre-made them earlier in the day for my first batch and they were a bit too tough.  For my next attempt, I only pre-made the banana pudding and saved everything else for serving time.

Great recipe really enjoyed making it and also my wife and I enjoyed eating them. I wasn't able to find the Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Shells so I substituted them for VIP Pastry Shells. We would certainly make them again especially when we have company coming over. It's great that you can prepare the pastry shells and the pudding mixture in advance.
