This recipe sounded soo good, still does. However, 2 ingredients over powered this dish to where it should have been 5 star rating. I questioned myself first and then should have listened and gone with my instinct, but there is way to much black pepper and dried thyme in the recipe. And it's all we could taste above everything else. They both were totally overwhelming. The thyme sat on the tongue above the flavors while the black pepper did a party in the back of the throat and wasn't fun. My youngest had the most difficulties with this issue and this momma felt horribly bad. I'd ONLY try this again with taking my instinct like I should have done and reduce the black pepper to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp verses 1 1/2tsp total as well as the same with the thyme. I did top the recipe with 1/2cup shredded cheese mixed with 1/4 cup of shredded parm and a sprinkling of home grown dried basil before placing in the oven.

I think I may just have to try this recipe out as there are days when I really want a lasagna but can't be asked to spend ages preparing it. 

A recipe which I did use last was this Beef & Bacon lasagna from Great British Chefs which turned out pretty well but does take 90 minutes   =( It is worth it though especially as I doubled the creamy sauce

This is one of my go-to recipes on busy nights when I don't have time to make a traditional lasagna. This works just as well with ground turkey/chicken/sausage and I use mozzerella instead of feta. This is an excellent substitute for families who love Hamburger Helper but want to think "outside the box". I like to serve this with garlic bread and a tossed salad for a complete meal.

Super simple recipe; exactly what I was looking for. The flavor wasn't out of this world and it had a bit too much pepper for my taste, but it was a healthier version of a typical boxed dinner. I will be making this again, just cutting the pepper to 1tsp.
