Finally!  These are the Halcyon Days of Yore sugar cookies.  Made exact recipe.  Shortening is kinda gross these days but important for soft crunch, all butter will create harder crunch if baked longer & will darken and soft cookie if baked on time.   I drizzled cream cheese frosting w orange juice, rind & almond extract dang!  I will make these my Christmas cookie this year, thank you Grandma!!!!!!

Thanks for sharing your Muz's recipe!  Just took the first sheet out of the oven, and my GF said they are the best sugar cookies, EVER! I made a couple adjustments, based on necessity and other reviewers comments. I didn't have shortening, so I substituted margarine (I often use half butter/half margarine in cookie recipes; makes them softer).  I also increased vanilla to 1 and 3/4 tsp, just because I always increase the vanilla, based on the size of the recipe (I've been known to go as high as a TBL!). And, finally, the temperature ~ I set the oven at 325, and baked the cookies for 20 minutes.  It makes for a softer cookie, and over time, it's become a habit.  I used half and half, 3 TBL, because I was out of milk. I may try sour cream or yogurt next time I make them, just to see what happens, since my GF's formerly favorite sugar cookies were made with sour cream. I rolled them into a roughly walnut-size and -shape, dipped a glass in a little water, then sugar, then pressed just until they were flat. Again, just delicious!

I was a little worried when my wet/dry mixture was not "creamy" but they cooked up perfectly.  My husband said they were close to his grandmother's cookies!

It was fun to make and I'll definitely make it again. I didn't use the shortening, only butter. I also added a little bit of hot cocoa powder and mint and voil√†. Delicious cookies that taste like the holidays lol. Hope this encourages people to make this cookie! :)

Our college kids loved them. I cooked for the allotted time but on a light colored aluminum sheet. When I used the dark cookie sheet they burnt.

These are great - at 10 minutes they were light brown on top and had a good crunch. If you're going to add frosting, I'd reduce the sugar by the 1/2 cup that the poster added to his grandmother's recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe and the memory.  I have a sugar cookie recipe of my grandmother's that's very dear to me, too, but these are a nice and easier change :)

I thought these were great - even better the next day.    I didn't change much except adding an addtl 1/2 t of vanilla (why? just because :))  I used water instead of the milk - really its just a way to get the dough to come together so I'm pretty sure it made zero diff with the taste.  I wasn't sure why to flatten the cookie . 
So I flattened some (with the bottom of a fluted glass) and others I just dropped on the pan.  The flattened ones were so much prettier so will def do that going forward.   Also, I did use the temp at 400 as written, but I think that was a bit high (prolly just my oven) so will knock it down to 375 next time.  Again, these are great - when craving a sugar cookie, this will be my go to recipe.   (will try the recipe with lemon to see what the result is...)  To the reviewer that  said t 'Omg so hard to make!"  I can only assume they were NOT using  a mixer.  These are so easy to put together its the only thing I can come up with :)

This recipe is delicious, and easy to make. The sweet and buttery taste makes a perfect sugar cookie. I sprinkled mine with some powdered sugar before serving to my 7 year old. He said they are the best cookies he's ever had! Thanks to another grandma for passing on a tasty treat, and thanks for sharing. I saved this one to my favorites

I followed recipe exactly.  I will not rate it below 4 stars simply because I didn't like them.  The cookies are bland which is normal for sugar cookies but seemed to be even more so imo.  They're more like a crunchy tea cake.  Tastes vary so some may love these.

My family loves these! I sometimes substitute coconut oil for shortening as a personal preference, but the recipe works great with either shortening or coconut oil. (I always use butter though.) I make the first tray as drop cookies, as directed, and then take extra dough and roll/refrigerate it to slice and bake the next day. The texture is a little different the second day, but the taste is awesome either way. Thank you to the recipe submitter!

These cookies are quick, easy and delicious.  I rolled the dough, which was very easy to handle and not sticky, into balls and flattened half of them with the bottom of a glass dipped into green colored sugar.  I did the same with the second half but used crushed peppermints mixed with sugar.   The cookies were round and looked like bakery cookies.
Thanks for the great recipe, twardyyy!

I'd never been a fan of  sugar cookies myself, but I made these at the request of my son. I have to say I thought I screwed up when I added the 2 T of milk at the end- it was a very crumbly dough, so I added another 2 T of milk. I did have to squeeze the dough together to be able to roll and flatten,  but they baked perfectly! I was surprised how much difference using both shortening and butter made! I sprinkled some pumpkin pie spice on some of them that I preferred, my son liked them plain.
After a couple days I found I could taste the salt-and I only used 1/2 teas rather than written 3/4 teas. I would use only 1/4 teas

I used all butter instead of shortening, and added 2 tablespoons of Frangelica for a hazelnut flavor. I also split the recipe and added chocolate chips. This recipe is great and flexible. I did not sprinkle the sugar on top before baking. I will use less salt next time. Everyone loved the cookies.

A few ppl mentioned they always prefer butter over margarine, but it‚Äôs detrimental to the recipe that you actually follow it. Firstly bc changing things makes a new Recipe and thus makes your review void. Secondly because the butter/ margarine in a cookie recipe determines how hard or soft they come out. The ppl using all butter in this recipe, likely aren‚Äôt enjoying their hockey-pucks as much as they claim to be. Nonetheless this is one of the only sugar cookie recipes I‚Äôve seen calling for milk, and also the only one that produced actual chewy cookies afterward, which is a huge deal! I love my cookies chewy but they are not easy to make properly. Good job Grandma!

Meh... typical bakery quality sugar cookie calls for both vanilla & almond extract. I too am grossed out but shortening & used all unsalted butter. I‚Äôll go back to my ‚ÄúLittle Bakery‚Äù recipe from channel baring the same name from YT. I use that one for my rolled sugar cookies-best dough EVER & so is her royal icing recipe!! Can not go wrong with her recipes!!!

These cookies were alright.  I even added the additional changes listed in the footnote for a better batch, but even still they were nothing spectacular.  The cookies got really crunchy around the edges even undercooking them, but the middle was soft.  Let covered overnight and they became stale in less than 24 hours.  You could just taste every single ingredient in the cookie as if nothing was mixed well.  There was just nothing great about this recipe.

These cookies are scrumptious! I added another 1/4 t. of vanilla but think I should have stuck with Muz's recipe. Anyway they were still delicious. Will make them again and again. Thanks for sharing your great grandmother's recipes. Sweet memories!

These are very good, what a great way to honor the memory of your dear Muz! I only added the half cup extra of sugar . They are crunchy and delish as is. My only complaint is I made them way too big! My fault. bigger is better, right? Yummy. Thanks for sharing this.

I was looking for a recipe to use as a base for my fruit pizza, made this dough and used half for the pizza and cooked up the other half.  Very good and versatile.  Cookies had just th right amount of sweetness without being overpowering.

These were bangin‚Äô and easy to do. And I don‚Äôt really like sugar cookies but I can eat these all day. I did the extra sugar and milk, they were perfect. I pressed them with my hand because they stuck to the glass and it worked fine.

Excellent recipe!  I made these today to make individual fruit pizza cookies.  These are great as cookies and wonderful with cream cheese frosting and fruit/berries on top.
