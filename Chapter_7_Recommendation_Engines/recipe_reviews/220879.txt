Delicious, but lots more curry puts it over the top and just for a little jolt, a sprinkle or two of red pepper and a dash of onion salt...

Quick, tasty and easy to prep. You can cut the cholesterol level by substituting soy-based mayonnaise (and less of it) for the mayo and sour cream. Great on toast.

This has great potential but needs more curry powder and either some finely chopped onion or onion powder.  (or both)  I used a bag of frozen artichoke hearts that I steamed and cooled.  Some finely chopped chives or green onions would add a lot and be a very nice garnish to brighten up this dish.

I discovered I only had marinated artichokes on hand so I cut back on the curry and skipped the salt entirely. Used just enough mayo to hold it together (forgot the sour cream) and served with tortilla chips. A hit with everyone; no leftovers!

I put 2 tsps of curry powder and 1 tsp of  Raselhanout seasoning from Whole Foods: coriander, turmeric, cardamom, sea salt, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.  I put in only 1/4 cup of sour cream because the consistency looked too fluid after putting in the mayonnaise.  So delicious! I made this 10 serving size for my husband and I and thought we would have to freeze leftovers.... no leftovers!

Loved this, but did subtract and added a bit more ingredients. Subtracted mayonnaise and sour cream. Substituted only 1/2 c roasted red pepper hummus instead. Added 1/4 c chopped green olives, 1/4 c EVOO (or use artichokes in olive oil), 1/4 c white wine vinegar, 1/2 squeezed lemon juice, 1 1/2 t curry powder, 3 chopped green onions, 4 hard boiled eggs, extra salt and pepper. Spread on sprouted grain bread or stalks of celery.

I just tried this, and loved it!  I added an extra egg, a little more curry powder and just a dash of onion powder, and let it chill in the fridge for several hours.  Definitely a change-up on my egg salad that I will make again!
