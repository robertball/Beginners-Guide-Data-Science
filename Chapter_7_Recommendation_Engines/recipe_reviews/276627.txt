2.13.20  The best way I would describe this is Asian coleslaw.  Of course, a “small head napa cabbage” is subjective, so maybe I just didn’t have enough napa cabbage, but this was way too much dressing.  If I’d used all of the dressing I’d mixed up, the cabbage would have been swimming in it.   Honestly, I’m not sure that the more expensive napa cabbage rather than regular cabbage makes much difference in this recipe.  The two dominating  flavors  were the peanut butter and the ginger.  Also, kind of a minor thing, but the brown color of the peanut butter was a bit off-putting in eye appeal.  Not concerned about the leftover dressing which I put in the fridge because I’ll find a use for it, it was pretty good.  One other thing, I made this mid-afternoon, and by the time dinner time arrived, it was pretty watery, so I wouldn’t expect it to last there days.  This was OK, but doubtful I’ll make it again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
