It had a very chunky batter, and I had to mix for 10 minutes. Even though I followed the directions to a T. They were also very bland and not chocolate tasting at all. Although the frosting was very good.

These cupcakes were amazing! I made them with my friend and we took them to a small party. They took a little longer than expected and we were really late to the party. That was mainly our fault though. my only complaint is that the frosting was way to thick, it broke our hand mixer and we had to add some milk to thin it down a bunch. I just recommend adding some milk to the frosting to thin it down a litte

This recipe was a hit with my family. The frosting seemed like a lot of sugar, but it was fantastic. The cakes were delicious. Better than most chocolate cakes I have made.  I am not too much of a fan of raspberry (I made them because they were pink! :) but this definitely changed my mind. I am astounded by the outcome! Thank you!
