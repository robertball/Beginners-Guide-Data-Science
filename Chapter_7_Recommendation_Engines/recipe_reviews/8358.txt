This is wonderful recipe...I cannot believe I tried all the other apple cake recipes didnt try this one!! It has a wonderful texture and flavour. Unlike the German Apple cake it does not get too moist to handle properly. Unlike Apple CakeV it doesnt need a topping that sometimes makes it soggy.Is much moister than the Jewish apple cakes. I have made it 3times in the past two days (once by scaling down the recipe to half and baking in a 8x8 pan) and its turned out perfect each time. Of course I did make a few changes based on what previous reviewers said. I used only 1-3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup oil and cut the 4tsps of cinnamon to 2tsp. The best part is its easy and quick. While the kids hold the hand mixie and whip up the eggs and sugar....the apples are peeled and sliced..and doesnt take too long after that.
Thanks, Ann.....this is a winner!!

This cake was easy and delicious. After reading all the reviews I was certainly torn; sweet apple vs tart apple, nuts vs no nuts, 2 cups sugar vs less sugar, frosting vs no frosting. What's a girl to do? Well, this is so unlike me, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was just right. I used 5 large Granny Smith apples. I think a tart apple is the way to go. If you leave out the nuts, the cake is going to taste sweeter so you might want to adjust the sugar. And I can't imagine adding frosting to this cake, but to each his own. I served mine with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and got rave reviews from everyone. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I LOVED this recipe!!!  It was so good, better than I had imagined.  I used more apples and mixed most into the batter, but then saved a lot to place neatly on top of the batter, completely covering the cake and then sprinking the sugar and cinnamon on top of that.  It looked very nice and tasted amazing!

Great apple cake recipe! I added 1 cup of raisins and also decreased the sugar to less than 1.5 cups. I sprinkled the top generously w/cinnamon and sugar and tossed the apples w/cinnamon before adding to mixture. I have made other apple cakes and this one didn't get moist and gooey on top the day after I baked it. This recipe is perfect without being too rich or sweet.

This is a delicious apple cake recipe!  I loved the juicy slices of apples in the cake and it was packed full!  At first I was concerned there was not enough batter, but it rises a lot so do not worry!

I loved this recipe as is.  My family enjoyed it and I will definitely make this again.  I did dice the apples up into small pieces and that made a lot of pieces but it made it so you got apple in every bite.  I also doubled the topping to make it cover more of a 9X13 pan.  You could do it either way, but I love sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I will make this one many times over, and after one time I made a second the same day for company.  Loved this one!

A fairly good cake to serve with coffee in the morning, but not memorable. I chose the recipe since it calls for more apples than most, and I have five apple trees which are now producing like crazy.

I made this recipe as written, and was somewhat disappointed with the finished result. Next time I'm going to either chop the apples into smaller pieces, use a less firm apple...I used Granny Smith...or slice the apples, but instead of mixing them into the batter I'd like to try arranging the slices on top, and then sprinkle them with the cinnamon/sugar mixture. Also, next time I'll cut down a bit on the amount of cinnamon that the recipe calls for. We felt that the cake itself was overpowered by the apple slices and the cinnamon. My son enjoyed this warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but after the first day no one seemed too interested in eating anymore of it. Thanks for sharing this recipe, and I will try it again with the above modifications.

Loved this cake.  Of course changed a little-- 3/4 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup applesauce, lots of cinnamon and some nutmeg as well (unmeasured)... had 7 small getting-soft Pink Lady apples, but ended up just coring, slicing and roughly chopping... the peels didn't make a difference.  Also I think the directions to beat eggs and sugar *FIFTEEN* minutes had to be wrong-- I had it in the stand mixer for maybe a minute and it turned out great.  Baked 50 min.  This cake was widely praised as being not overly sweet, very moist, and having great texture.  Thank you Ann!

Very good. Subbed yoghurt for the 1 c. of oil as i didn't have any. Surprised that it turned out as well as it did! Still moist. I also added 2 t. of gr. ginger and half a t. of allspice. Will make again. Thanks

I was very glad to find this as I was searching for a recipe using apple pieces rather than applesauce, which I was not sure if I could find where I stay. I added 1/2 cup of raisins and placed slices of apple on top like a previous reviewer. Would probably omit or cut back on the sugar and cinnamon dusting in the future. Thanks

Deee-lish!  I made this recipe yesterday afternoon with my friends and I and it turned out just perfect!  We followed the recipe exactly with splendid results.  There was just enough cinnamon in the batter and on the apples to make your taste buds scream.  We halved the recipe so we used 1 organic fujii, 2 small granny smiths, and 1 unknown red apple (gala?), and boy oh boy.. I could have eaten the whole thing.  (I think I did have 4 slices.. Teehee, and I'm on a diet!  Bad girl!)  We cooked the cake for a little over an hour and it turned out perfect.  At first we thought it to be a bit gooey, but after a quick knife-in-through-the-middle check, it turned out that a thin layer of batter around each apple was moist, but definitely cooked.  Mmm!  Loved this recipe.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves apples and cinnamon.  Will make this recipe again!  (Maybe as cupcakes this time, as to help eat better proportions, haha[;  )

Oh my gosh, this recipe is absolutely awesome! I made the cake as written with no changes. I did although change the topping a bit.  Brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and a little white sugar.  This cake just like a good apple pie.  I would highly recommend this one to everyone. Thanks Ann...

I only used 3 tsp of cinnamon. I also used maple/sugar/cinnamon for the topping. Good with caramel on top and ice cream. Perfect fall cake!

I only beat the mixture for about 9 minutes.  It was very fluffy so I figured that was the point.  The cake was delicious and very moist.  I did have to cook it for much more time than indicated.  Probably a good 20 minutes more.

This is a wonderful recipe--moist and bursting with apples. Some reviewers felt the need for frosting--I disagree.  The cake is rich and flavorful as it is.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a big hit when I made it for a friend's birthday. I used three golden delicious apples instead of five, though, and I didn't beat the egg mixture for fifteen minutes (I probably did about five). I will definitely keep it in my "repertoir."

This was a fantastic cake recipe.  I was a little surprised that I had to beat the eggs so long, but it made a huge difference.  My husband ate half the cake in one day.  A definite winner!

Very good cake to snack on.  I used red delicious apples that were getting a little soft.  I added raisins & pecans to the apples and mixed them with a little sugar & cinnamon mixture before adding to the batter.  Would definitely make this cake again.

Ok, I made this recipe like 5 times already and everyone who has tried it loved it.  The only thing different I did was make a cream cheese icing for it.  It was delicious, I know I will continue to make it.  Thanks!!!

Excellent recipe!  I took others' advice; cut down on the sugar and oil.  I also changed the spices since using cinnamon only seemed one note to me. I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, I teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice & 1/2 nutmeg. 
Everyone who has tried the cake has raved.  It is a keeper!

Loved this cake, easy, quick and great texture, and it's great to find a dairy-free recipe that tastes so wonderfully moist and creamy.
After following the recipe faithfully the first time, I made a couple of small changes; I don't know if it was the apples I used (very ripe) or the sugar, but it came out way too sweet for my tastes, so i cut the sugar to 1 cup and continue to use very ripe & sweet apples and it works wonderfully for my family! I also cut the oil to a half cup as i found that it was more than enough. 
Thanks for sharing this.

this recipe is awesome, my husband (who doesn't like cake) actually really enjoyed this cake, although I did make a few tweaks to it.  I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to it, 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugars, and replaced the 1 cup of oil with 1 cup of applesauce, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, after I greased up my pan I dusted it with cinnamon sugar baked it for 55 minutes and it turned out amazingly moist and not too sweet and very flavorful. thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be for sure making this recipe over and over

I made this cake according to the directions except for shredding the apples and adding slightly less oil.  It turned out very moist and light.  I personally would have liked a little more spice to the cake, so next time I will probably add some nutmeg and extra cinnamon.  Very good recipe though!

Lovely and easy-to-make cake! Like some others suggested, I held back on the oil a bit (used a scant 3/4 cup) and the cake didn't seem to suffer. I was also generous with the cinnamon and even added some allspice and ground ginger to give it more of a spice cake taste. Delicious - would definitely make again!

Pretty good, but overcooked a little.  Next time I would reduce sugar and cooking time by 10 minutes.

Really great texture in this cake, but the flavor could be better. I took the recommendations of other reviewers: reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also changed the sugar to light brown (to give it a darker flavor) and added two tbsp of cider to give it more apple flavor. It would be better with some nutmeg and a bit of cloves. To get more apple flavor, coat your apple chunks in lemon, and then sprinkle them with extra cinnamon before mixing them in. Also, I mixed in half my apples, and layered the other half on top, and they sank nicely.

My first trial was also my first cake ever, turned out so well until I impressed myself! lol.. my husband and his colleague looked enjoy it too. Because the oven is small, I adjusted the recipe by using 1/4 of each ingredients, plus pour about 80 ml of milk. So far I tried 3 times already. Satisfied!

This was my first ever attempt at baking something, and considering I was working in metric without a kitchen scale, it came out great. The apples were very juicy, and everyone enjoyed this cake. I followed the recipe except for not using vanilla and cinnamon, both of which are hard to come by where I live...

Great recipe! The original recipe is a bit too sweet for my taste, so I cut it down by 1/3 cup. Since I don't have a cake mixer, I had to use my hand blender instead, and only blended for 5 minutes. It might not be as fluffy, but the slightly dense texture was nice too. 
I tried this recipe for both a brunch party and a dinner party. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again.

very good. moist, appley, cinnamony. beating the eggs & sugar for 15 minutes is necessary to keep this cake light & fluffy, otherwise it will be dense.  if you will be adding a frosting, i suggest you cut down the sugar. without frosting, it is delicious the way the recipe is written. i cut the recipe in half, baked in a 9X9 baking pan for 35 minutes. excellent.

This cake is absolutely wonderful. Everyone that has tried it says they can't believe how moist it is. We have already made it three times and will make more, One of the cakes my four year old did all the work, with the exception of slicing the apples.

Made this as was looking for a recipe to make use of some Granny Smiths that needed using.  The only things I did different were cut back a bit on sugar by1/4 of a cup.  I didn't have walnuts but had some flaked almonds that needed using and I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract.  I used Demerara sugar with the cinnamon for the topping.  It looked distinctly unpromising as I mixed it up but when cooked was absolutely delicious.  It does make quite a big cake so I ended up taking some to work where it went down very well.  It's nice cold or warmed up and served with cream or ice cream as a dessert.  Would definitely bake this again and would probably stick with the almonds as not a massive fan of walnuts.

I gave this 5 stars because it has a great flavor and was very simple.. 
I do have a question for any pro-bakers out there - First of all, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar because I didn't realize I didn't have any white until I had everything all ready to go. so I went ahead and attempted to use the brown sugar in place of it..The cake unfortunately turned out very dry... My question is this: Could it have been the brown sugar that made it turn out so dry? Or is there something else I could have done wrong?  Thanks in adance for any responses!

This was pretty good. I guess this kind of cake is an old standard, but I don't think I'd ever had it before. I made it exactly as written, using Granny Smith apples, unbleached flour, sea salt, and sunflower oil. What was unusual was that it tested "done" with a toothpick at only 50 minutes. I live at a high elevation, and baked goods recipes often take longer than written. This cake was pretty moist, and had good amounts of apples, cinnamon and chopped walnuts. Nothing fancy, but a nice dessert, especially when warmed a little in the microwave.

Wow!!! This cake is amazing, I make it all the time. It's one son's favorite cake on earth; light, fluffy, flavorful - everything you'd want in a cake. I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and replaced 1/2 the oil for applesauce. You can also replace some of the flour with whole wheat. Chop the apples finely and don't skimp on the beating time. You'll get a winner.

I was sure surprised about the huge amount of apples and very little batter but this cake baked just perfect. Very delicious even without the nuts and cinnamon (personal preference - don't care for either). It got a bit soggy on the bottom on the second day - any suggestions?
Unfortunately I don't know what kind of apples I used (they were very big and red-green :) ) and I liked the sweetness of the cake just fine, but some of my guests mentioned it would be too sweet. I assume I used sweet tasting apples and would cut the sugar down next time I bake it. If I use tart apples I'll stay with the suggested 2 cups.
However – thanks for this really tasty recipe, it is sure a keeper (for me and my guests). By the way – it served 18 people as dessert with vanilla ice cream.

This actually was the first cake I've ever made and it turned out awesome!  Living in VT in the fall it is hard not to pick up some apples but how many can you eat.  This made for a great dessert with friends for game night.  I used macintosh & granny smith apples and covered the top with walnuts.

This recipe is delicious. I picked it because of the 5 star rating and the rave reviews. It turned out pefect and very rustic looking with the sugar/cinnamon topping. I used my stand mixer to beat the eggs and sugar, 15 minutes on high is just perfect for drowning out the kids. It was also perfect for me to peel and slice my apples. I used 4 very large Jonagolds. I used the full amount of sugar but cut the oil in half and used 1/2 cup of applesauce. The cake was perfectly moist without being too heavy. I do have to agree with another reviewer to be sure to test the center with a toothpick. I started with 50 minutes and ended up baking it the full 60 minutes. I definately will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake today. Since I'm not a big fan of cinnamon I decided not to put it on the batter, but I did make the cinnamon sprinkle. It came out wonderfull, but next time I'll reduce the sugar to 1 3/4 cups.

This recipe is foolproof! I only beat the eggs & sugar about 12 min, didn't quite have enough vanilla, skipped the walnuts, and used regular red delicious apples and this STILL turned out great! Very light and delicious.

My husband LOVES this cake!  I like to use Granny Smith apples because of that slightly sour, tangy flavor which tastes great when baked!  I've made this cake so many times that I'm sick of it LOL!  Thanks for a great recipe. . .

This is an outstanding recipe.  It comes out very moist, yet the walnuts make it crunchy.  No alterations need to be made.   The first time I made it, it came out just perfect!  Highly recommended.

Very moist cake. Next time I make it, I plan to leave off the cinnamon and sugar topping. Cake got too brown, but the taste was very good without tasting sweet.

Delicious!  I have 3 apple trees, all producing like crazy and I've been hunting for apple recipes.  The apples I have are small, so I didn't use 5 apples as stated in the recipe but instead peeled and chunked 6 cups of apples.  I didn't mix the eggs and sugar for 15 minutes because it seemed like overkill--3 minutes sufficed.  Used 1 1/2 cups sugar because my apples are pretty sweet.  Added about 4 cups of apples to the batter and sprinkled the remaining 2 cups on top of the cake, then cinnamon/sugar combo.  This cake is very moist, with the perfect amount of sweetness, apple-ness, and cinnamon-ness to it.  I will make it many times, I'm sure!

No nuts due to nut allergy and it was fine, chopped the apples and put sliced apples on top, under a crumb topping made with 2T butter, 2T flour 2T sugar and  2tsp cinnamon. It was great, will make again

I found this recipe to use some left over apples...WOW! Great flavor and the walnuts are perfect with the sweetness. Someone commented on less sugar if not using them. I’d definitely follow that advice if you don’t want them for any allergy or taste preference reasons. Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent recipe! I also reduced the sugar and oil to 3/4 cup.  I added half a cup of applesauce to the batter as well. In stead of 4 tsp. cinnamon, I used 1 and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (didn't have any apple pie spice!) Delicious! Rave reviews from friends & family! Do not skip beating the eggs and sugar for 15 full minutes. Have already made it again!

Wonderful recipe....but have to admit I changed it up a bit.  Was looking for a recipe for an apple cake my mom used to make....and it's been a looooong time.  Only used half the vanilla and added a tsp. of maple extract.  Also sprinkled the nuts on top of cake before baking...along with cinnamon, sugar and brown sugar.  Then sprinkled with chocolate chips just before taking out of oven.  The topping turned out just like my moms cake and the cake itself was plain luschious so I am a happy girl!  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice & both times it came out beautifully! My boyfriend doesn't eat much sweet stuff, but when I made this, he couldn't get enough. Infact, he just asked me if I'd make it again. I didn't change anything. It's perfect as is! I would highly recommend this recipe!

Super easy to make and delicious.  I made it for a church coffee house event.  Left off the cinnamon sugar topping and used cream cheese frosting instead.  This is simply personal preference.  Also, caution others who may want to reduce the sugar! Check your apples to see how sweet/tart they are.  Tart apples (some granny smith or cortland) may warrant the 2 cups sugar. Mine did. and after all, it's cake!

So delicious.  I don't care for nuts in my baked goods, so I added some chocolate chips, I had an old apple chip recipe that gave me this idea, I also added a little brown sugar to the topping and cut the apples into smaller pieces. 
I am sure I will use this recipe over and over.

It turned out great. I didn't mix eggs and sugar for 15 minutes. That's seems too long. I used 3/4 cup of oil and 3 cups of sugar and 3 teaspoons of cinnamon. I will definitely make it again.

The people I served it to liked this cake. I gave out the recipe 5 times but with my changes. I subbed applesauce for half the oil(to cut the fat content down), cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups(2 cups is too much), the apples to 4 , and the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons. with these changes its a 5 star. I personally did not care for this cake.

Great! Delicious, easy, and uses a bunch of apples. My family couldn't seem to leave this alone. I used all whole wheat flour and it turned out terrific.  I hope you enjoy it too!

I made this yesterday.  My husband doesn't usually eat sweet stuff.  He came back for seconds!!  If I make it again, I will cut the recipe in half -- there's only the 2 of us and a whole big cake is too much.

This was just OK.  4 eggs is a bit much and you can def taste them, (which I didn't like).  And what's with beating the eggs and sugar for 15 minutes?  I did do it, but I'm really not sure why...All in all it wasn't a total waste because my family will still eat it.

This was great!  The apples I used were really small so doubled them and I am glad I did.  It was just enough.  This cake taste even better the second day.  I read a review someone wrote that said they used a brown sugar crumb mixture for the topping, I think I will use that next time.  As for this time - my husband requested powdered sugar.

This is a very good apple cake recipe. I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut back the sugar to 1 c. white and 3/4 cup brown. I also cut back the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup applesauce. I bakes it at 350 degrees, but my cake was ready in 40 minutes, so you will need to watch it closely. I will make this one again!

This cake was very easy to make. It came out great. My only complaint is for me it was a little bit too sweet. I think next time I would use a little bit less sugar and maybe tarter apples or soak them in lemon juice first. Other than that, the cake was a hit and it went fast.  Also I made much more topping than called for in the recipe.

This was an easy, delicious, moist, and somewhat healthy "cake," though I did make some adjustments per other reviewers and my own tastes. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan. I used 2 apples, white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, and no nuts. If you eat this for breakfast, as we did, you can cut the sugar even more to 1/2 cup and I'm sure it will still taste great.

Fantastic cake!  Loved it, and will make again and again.  The only thing I did differently was reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup in lieu of the missing oil.  Worked out fine.  I used Cameo apples-- a sweet apple-- cut small from the local farmers market as well, which worked nicely.

this is a wonderful breakfast treat with a cup of coffee. took some advise and cut back on the oil to 1/2 cup and 1 cup of sugar. and then added 1/2 cup apple sauce the 2nd time i made it. it didnt change a thing but may have saved me a few calories. Great recipe.

Great cake.  Made some modifications: 4 apples instead of 5, subbed apple sauce for half the oil, and used 1/4 less sugar (100g less).  Served with vanilla ice cream for dessert, or some greek yogurt on the side for breakfast.  Used granny smiths, and came out perfect.  Also used just a handful of walnuts, which i mixed with sugar/cinnamon topping (as opposed to mixing in batter). Will def be making this again.

This is awesome! I thought it was wierd beating eggs and sugar for 15 min, but I did and it got so fluffy that I figured it would make the cake full and fluffy. I chopped the apples and there was one in every bite. I also used 1 cup melted butter instead of the oil. Incredibly yummy!! :) This should get 10 stars~~~

This was great!  I made for Thanksgiving, but added a caramel topping (just by using caramel candies and half and half.  I drizzled it on top of cake, everyone went crazy and wanted more of this cake.  Thank you for sharing!!!

This was good, but not fantastic. I cubed the apples instead of slicing. I did enjoy the apple taste, but I halved the cinnamon (my husband doesn't like cinnamon), and it was still pretty over powering. If I make this again, I'll cut the cinnamon even more.

This cake was so delicious and simple to make! I followed the recipe perfectly, except I sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of white sugar. It's great with a hot cup of tea or coffee.

This cake was addictive. It was so moist and delicious. I had very big yellow apples, and two was enough for this cake. With the exception of using brown sugar and cinnamon to sprinkle on top instead of white sugar, I followed the recipe to a "t" and it was a huge hit. I will definitely make this again.

I only had four apples, so that's what I used, but it came out great.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the sugar to 1 3/4 c, and also reduced the oil to 3/4 c.  It's VERY moist, and it was absolutely SPECTACULAR with French Vanilla Ice Cream.  YUMMY!

great cake. One thing though, I felt using a mixer for 15 minutes on eggs,would make meringue. so I only beat the eggs and sugar for about 7 minutes.

My sweety, an infrequent cook, made this with ease. It was a very delicious apple cake. I would call it apple cinnamon cake though b/c the cinnamon is a major player in this recipe. You could even cut back on the cinnamon by a tsp. or so and it would still be sufficient. It is very moist and becomes soggy after a day so I think it's best served to a group the same day. Makes the house smell great while baking. Thanks!

I came on looking for an apple recipe that didn't require a crust and found this.  I was NOT disappointed:)  I took it to a church fellowship this evening and everyone had good things to say!  The only thing I changed was leaving out the nuts and adding nutmeg.  (I always add nutmeg when a recipe calls for cinnamon).  The cake was moist and the sweetness and tartness was very well balanced.  I'll be making this again for sure!

Note: I used a little less cinnamon and sugar.

Good cake. Too sweet even with GS apples. And it might have had something to do with what I did, but it crumbled and was hard to cut (probably because apples were sliced instead of cubed). Not too many second helpings with this one though. Maybe I'll try tweeking it a little next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I agree that this is a 5 star cake.  I made some alterations (which don't always work) but did with this recipie  :)  (I just wonder if mixing the eggs & sugar for 15 minutes is really necessary, rather than a shorter period of time.  I plan to experiment that in the future.)

Everyone absolutely loved this recipe!!! I made it for my brother-in-laws birthday and  it was a huge hit.  My sister-in-law said she thought it was the best cake she had ever eaten.  I made a frosting with creamcheese, powdered sugar, and cinnamon that complemented the cake very well. Will make again. Thanks

This came out delicious while my whole house smelled great. The only change I made was to leave out the nuts because I don't like nuts. I added 3/4 cup extra flour. I was nervous because of what others wrote about too much sugar, but I tasted the batter and felt that I needed to add even. I added about 4 tablespoons and it really came out perfect. I did use granny smith (sour) apples, though, so perhaps that's why it needed the extra sugar.

Every fall I love to make a recipe with apples.  I usually opt for my grandmother's apple crisp recipe.  This year I wanted to try something new.  I thought this apple cake recipe was delicious.  I did cut down on the sugar a by 1/4 of a cup and thought it was great.  I love cream cheese frosting but thought that it was too much for the cake.  Next time I will leave off the cream cheese frosting and just do a streusal topping.  The cake itself was excellent though!

This is so easy to make and tastes wonderful. The only thing I changed was I made a cream cheese frosting for the top instead of cinnamon & sugar. I took this to school for the teachers and it was gone before lunch time.  :)

Great recipe... I took the cake to work and I made all sorts of friends. The kind that I didn't know I had. Even those who professed that they didn't like sweets or cakes, raved about it. Definately, filing it away for further use. Great one.

Very delicious recipe and easy. I used 5 honeycrisp apples.  I thought that sounded like too many for a 13X9 inch cake but it wasn't. I made one small change and that was to omit the nuts (don't like nuts) and I replaced them with a big handful of raisins. That was a good decision because the raisins added wonderful flavor and texture. Be sure to use the toothpick method when testing for doneness.  My caked appeared to be done when it actually was still raw batter in the middle - so I left it in the oven till that toothpick came out clean! I figured that even if you were to slightly overbake this cake, the apples would provide so much moisture that it would still be fabulous. I topped it off with a delicious cream cheese icing. This cake kind of reminds me of carrot cake so the cream cheese icing was a perfect compliment. This cake received so many raves in my office.  I've tried many apple cake recipes and this is the only one I will make again. Many people who have posted a review said they cut down on the sugar.  I'm not sure why because my cake was not that sweet.  It was just sweet enough.  Maybe it depends upon the type of apple you use.  Some apples are naturally sweeter than others. This recipe is a good way to use those extra apples sitting on your counter that are a little too ripe for eating out of hand.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I wouldn't change a thing!
My whole family loved it.

What a moist cake and perfect for the fall when apples are around. I would use slightly less sugar next time. I baked it in a round cake pan for a party... like coffee cake

This was very good.  My husband loved it and I used egg substitute instead of "real" eggs.  When I try it again I am going to try applesauce to replace the oil.

I first made this cake for my daughter's 1st birthday and turned it into a castle. Everyone absolutely loved it and it smells so good. I have made it again since then, and it was very yummy again. The second time I made it for 12 serves instead of 24, it still turned out great.

I made this cake for my daughter's third bithday party (she requested an apple cake).  It had a lot of apples!  I was skeptical when I mixed in the apples and even reserved 1/4 cup because it seemed like too much.  It baked up beautifully, though, and tasted pretty good.  Cream cheese frosting was a nice addition.

This is a very delicious cake. Very light and moist. It's a little heavy on the cinnamon, so next time I'll try substituting 1 teaspoon of cloves and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg for two of the teaspoon of cinnamon. I used Stayman apples. I will also try baking it in a tube pan next time.

Great Recipe - made it last night and am  enjoying it in my lunch today!  Made a slight modification because I didn't have any baking powder.   Used 1 Teaspoon baking soda and a little less than 1/4 cup lemon juice in the recipe and it tastes great and rose up wonderful!  Thanks!

I've been searching for a recipe for Apple Cake that is just like Grandma's....this was close but not quite "it".  It baked up nice and light (probably that 15 minute beating time!) and moist, but Grandma's was much more dense and a bit sweeter.  Thanks for sharing though!

This cake is extremely light and delicious.  I only used 1.5 cups of sugar (next time i will only use 1 cup)and i added an extra apple. I even cut back the oil!  I would also omitt the sugar/cinnamon on top. I love this cake!

This turned out great. I baked it in a mini loaf pan for about 25 minutes. The loafs are very moist and freeze well for later.

I had to adjust the recipe for allergies. Instead of all purpose flour, I used 2 cups of Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Biscuit & Baking Mix, (it has baking powder and salt in it) I added 2 tsp of baking powder and didn't add more salt. I followed the recipe accurately other than that. I baked it at given temp for 55 minutes. It was delicious and light. I will repeat this recipe again!

This is a great cake!  I used Cortland apples (just because they were extras), but will use more tasty apples next time.  It’s still really tasty and moist!  I diced the apples in small pieces so they are in every bite.  I made a few small changes.  Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1-1/2 cups white.  I thought 4 tsp. of cinnamon sounded like so much, so I cut it to 3 tsp., but I really think it would be fine with 4, so I’ll do that next time.  I cut the oil to 3/4 cup just to save a few calories and added 1/4 cup of light sour cream.  I beat the eggs and sugar for 5 minutes, thinking 15 was a mistake.  Lastly, I used a little over a 1/2 cup of pecans because I didn’t have walnuts.  When it was baking, I couldn’t believe how much it raised in the pan!  The sugar and cinnamon topping is a nice touch.  The topping is hard when it comes out of the oven but softens later.  I’ll be making this cake again and again!

A good recipe thatI made caramel apple cupcakes using this recipe.  To counter the sweetness of the caramel, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and used Granny Smith apples for the tartness.  I also aded a teaspoon each of nutmeg and ground cloves.

My family went apple picking today and I wanted to use some of the many, many apples we brought home, so I actually doubled the recipe and made 2 pans (one for us, one for my husband to take to work. Risky, right?).  I coarsely chopped the apples (I used Macouns) into approximately 1/2" chunks (some chunks were bigger than others, which I think was a good thing) rather than using slices, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. (Wait, not completely true - I used grape seed oil because I was out of vegetable oil.) I personally hate when people rate and write reviews for recipes when they've made a bunch of changes to it, so I like to follow the actual recipe as closely as possible to see if it actually needs all the changes that the reviewers mention in their reviews that aren't actually for the recipe as written. The changes are not necessary, folks.  My husband, 12 year old daughter, 3 year old son, and I all agree that the cake is delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

We are loaded with apples thanks to one tree.  I spent the better part of a day prepping apples and bagging them with my Food Saver  but the freezer is full.  Time to use them.  This recipe looked great  BUT all that sugar.....  We discussed it and decided to try subbing the sugar for Monk Fruit Sweetener - zero calories (from the sugar).   We both tried it and declared it a success.  It tastes great!  Monk Fruit does not work for jams and jellies since it crystallizes with liquid but it seems fine in baked goods.

Excellent. Made it as written. Except I added about 3/4 cup cranberries sliced in half. Very quick and easy. This is a favorite!

Delicious and moist! I had a hard time telling if it was done or not inside because it was so moist. I used the full 2 cups of sugar, and I feel it could have used less. (My kids thought it was great, as is)

Super good! I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cups.
I layered additional apple slices on top to decorate and then put sugar/cinnamon on top. Awesome!

Unlike most reviewers, I made this just as the recipe is written. This is delicious just as written. Probably the best apple cake I have ever had. Will make again as it is written.

So good my husband - who hates chunks in food- had seconds! So easy my toddlers made most of it! (Other than cutting the apples) we used half brown and half white sugar, going a bit scant on the measurements. We also went a bit shy on the oil as well and used grape seed oil.  We left out the nuts. We used 2 large Fuji apples and 4 small Granny Smith sour apples,  dicing them into small pieces.. Baked it ten minutes longer than recommended and it was perfect!!!

Yum!  I scaled it for 6 servings and made it in two mini loaf pans.  Baked at 365 for 30 minutes.  I used two granny smith apples (instead of 1.25) and whole wheat flour.  And I only whipped the egg for about 5 minutes.  Served with whipped cream.  It was very yummy in a homey kind of way!  Going to freeze the other loaf and see how that works. ;-)

I tried this for the first time! Very easy to make, used my kitchen and apple peeler/slicer device to help with the apples, quartered apple slices and mixed into prepared batter. Everyone loved it. I didn't put walnuts into it this time as my wife doesn't like them.  I will try to add them at another time to see if it changes the texture.

I made this for a group and everyone raved!  I used three different kinds of apples, all from my freezer.  I added a bit of allspice as recommended by others.  I also threw in a few raisins.  This is so moist and serves well cold from the refrigerator with a dollop of whip cream.

I made this delicious Apple Cake IV last night, and loved it. Simple to make, moist, plenty of Apple (I used 7 as they were medium to small)  Added 1/4 cup light brown sugar and 1 3/4 white also 1 tsp brown sugar with the 4 tsp white and cinnamon on top. Just my preference. Great Cake can't wait to make over the holidays.

Came out very good, a little on the moist side but that's to be expected with the apples.  Made the house smell wonderful.

I did not whip the eggs and sugar for the full 15 minutes.  Maybe 10 minutes or so, came out fine.

Pretty good. I like that it used so many apples. I needed to use a bit more flour than stated, but taste was decent. Since I was using "cardboard" red delicious apples from my Mom-in-law's tree, I added some apple cider vinegar to deepen the flavor profile a bit. That was a good choice.

This is a fantastic apple cake - moist and full of flavor. I followed the recipe as it was my first time to bake it but next time I’ll play with substituting some of the oil with apple sauce.

This. Is. Awesome. It tastes like if apple pie turned into a cake. I did make a couple modifications -- I diced the apples instead of slciing and I reserved a small amount of the flour mixture to toss the apples in before mixing them into the batter (this helped the apples stay suspended in the cake) and I dropped the sugar to 1.5 cups because my family doesn't prefer very sweet desserts.

Good recipe and I will make it again. I personally don’t like cooked apples, so I didn’t eat it myself, but everyone else loved it. 
A few minor changes I did are:
1. because of allergies, I didn’t add nuts. 
2. Used 3/4 cup oil instead of 1 cup and it was fine. 
3. Cut a 1/4 cup of sugar out, but my husband said to add it back next time. If I was serving it with ice cream, I’d cut it again, but otherwise keep as the recipe says. 
4. Used 3 tsp of cinnamon in batter instead of 4 and added extra apple. 
Served it with just a touch of drizzled caramel sauce. Everyone said that the recipe was a keeper. Thank you!

What can I say that hasn't been said about this recipe. I'm truly speechless. Let me tell you this I hate apples and I anything made with apples but this cake was so devine that it is unbelievable. The flavors and the texture was out of this world. I did make these 2 changes: 1. I reduced the sugar amount to 1.5 cup as other reviewers have suggested. Which was absolutely necessary otherwise the cake would have been way too sweet specially since my apples were very sweet.  2. I reduced the cinnamon to 2 tsp instead of 4. I don't like too  cinnomany desserts. 2 tsp will give you enough cinnamon flavor without being too overpowering. A suggestion i have that i think is very important make sure your apple pieces are very small otherwise they wont coook through and you will be feeling like eating fresh apples that are crunchy and no one will like a cake like that. Anyways listen just make it and you tell me how it taste I guarantee you that you won't regret it.

This cake was just okay, in my estimation.  Never thought I’d say a cake was too moist, but this one is.  Odd, sort of mushy texture and not a lot of flavor.  I used five Granny Smith apples and followed the directions exactly.

I made it exactly as suggested and everyone loved it.  I took it to church for our luncheon after and came back with 4 small pieces for family at home.  I personally think I baked it about 5 min too long as 50 min wasn’t enough.  Went to 57 min.  Delicious still.

Fantastic recipe. Having made it for family the first time I made it, I now get asked to make it for every family event. This is definitely one to go in the recipe book. It is now my go-to if I need to take a dish anywhere.

Loved the cake (the whole family)!  Reduced sugar some. Frosted with cream cheese frosting instead of cinnamon sugar topping. No need for other changes. Will definitely make again.

Very good moist apple cake.  I used 1 cup No Calorie Sweetener,  and 3/4 cup brown sugar; 2 t cinnamon, 1 t cardamom, 1/2 t allspice,  1/2 t nutmeg; 3/4 cup oil,  1/2 cup applesauce; 1 cup raisins instead of nuts.  Used this combination after reading many reviews.  I had to bake an extra 10 minutes probably because my five apples which I chopped were large.  I topped with oatmeal, butter, cinnamon combo. Including this info so I can recall what i used when I make again!

This was delicious-- the top was really crispy from the sugar topping. Usually the apple cakes I make get really soggy. I only used a heaping 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups, and used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup oil. I was worried it would be too dry or not sweet enough, but it had a subtle sweetness, and was moist without being overly soggy. I only used 2 tsp of cinnamon, and added nutmeg and cardamom. Only beat the eggs and sugar for around 7 minutes. For the sugary topping, used cardamom instead of cinnamon (I love cardamom!) I served it with a chai caramel sauce I made, and it was perfect. If I wasn't going to serve it with the sauce, I would probably add another 1/4th cup of sugar.

This is a very delicious recipe for apple cake.  I used it at a family dinner for 14 people, and it was a big hit.  I made the recipe as given except my golden delicious apples were huge (picked off the tree that day).  Four apples yielded five cups of peeled, cored, and sliced pieces that seemed plenty enough for the batter

I’ve made this several times, following the recipe exactly, except for using pecans when I don’t have walnuts. It’s delicious. I like to use honeycrisp apples, and the cake is not too sweet.

I made the mistake of following others advice. I cut back on the sugar and cinnamon. It turned out bland. It had great texture, nice and moist. I jazzed it up with maple and cinnamon cream cheese icing. Next time I will add the full amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg.

I've change a bit... 50% white sugar n  50% brown sugar. Instead of chopped walnuts, I've used ground almond, and drizzle lemon juice over the apples too.  They're moist and delicious. Will definitely make it again.

Like another reviewer, mine was crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Ended up throwing most away. Cooked longer than suggested to try and firm it up, to no avail.

Delicious! I used six huge and juicy apples, 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and substituted 1/2 cup of oil with apple sauce. Came out perfect. Moist but not damp or soggy, not overly sweet, very apple-y. Even my extremely fussy seven-year-old nephew, who refuses to eat anything, loved it!

What an awesome cake.  At first I thought there was way too much sugar, cinnamon, and apples. But it worked out perfectly. I might reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup the next time I make it.

For God's sake, SLICE THE APPLES THINLY! This will give your cake a beautiful appearance. I didn't bother with the cinnamon and sugar on top, I didn't mix the eggs for 15 minutes, and I reduced the sugar and oil by about a third. The cake came out amazing! The time for baking was spot-on for my oven.

Way too much baking soda! It might make a lighter cake but the taste masks the flavor.

I didn't care for the texture, it was to dense.  The batter was quite runny and wondered if it needed a little more flour.  Guess it did.  We ate it, but no one wants me to make it again.

I have now made this twice and absolutely love the recipe.  It is so very good.  The only adaption I make is to use Splenda instead of sugar, since my husband is diabetic.  I will say I am probably not as accomplished a cook as some other reviewers, but it takes me a minimum of 45 minutes to prepare this, even with an apple corer, food processor and stand up heavy duty mixer.  Don't get me wrong, it is totally worth it, but "easy"is a relative term.  I should also mention that I used Fuji apples.  I am sure it's also good with a tart apple, but we love the juicy sweetness of Fuji.

I used about half a cup less sugar and substituted applesauce  for half the oil. I skipped the cinnamon and sugar on top, which was a mistake and I overcooked it. Oops! Still really good with all of the modifications. It used up all the apples we had that were about to go bad. Will definitely make this again. May sub some wheat flour  though.

I work in a nursing home and my residents ask for this bread every day. Super moist. I tried it with pears and they didn't have enough flavor. I also tried it with two cans of cherry pie mix and it was to heavy  and wet.

I did tweek it a little. One time I added another skinned, cut up apple to the topping. Very good & moist. Some other times, I made a streusel topping by adding a few table spoons of butter & equal amount of flour or oats to the cinnamon & sugar topping. Family liked that one the best. Tried the others, but this one tasted the closest to my Grandmother's recipe (altho she made it by heart- never wrote it down or measured ingredients).

I first baked this cake in the fall of 2015, and it was a hit with my family. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out very well even at 5300 feet. I have subsequently made a few changes (what baker doesn't?) that fit my style and family's tastes: I do use the tart Granny Smith apples, and use the amount of sugar in the recipe. I leave the peel on, and chop the apples. I use 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I use the 4 teaspoons of cinnamon, and also add a teaspoon of ginger, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. This cake freezes well, and is wonderful briefly heated in the microwave before serving. My adult son likes this for breakfast, will be coming for Christmas, and I have just finished baking two of these cakes to be sure there is enough. Thanks, Ann, for this wonderful and adaptable recipe.

I will absolutely make this again! I did improvise a bit: I left the nuts out, left the skins on the apples and cut them kind of chunky instead of thin slices, then because I only had 4 apples, I added some frozen blueberries. Since the fruit goes in at the very end and the blueberries were frozen, they didn't stain the batter. Awesome!

Moist and tasty. Baked this in 2 8X8" pans. 
Like some, I added 1 C raisins, cut sugar to 1 1/2 C, and subbed applesauce for half the oil.
Easy Peasy!

Very good.  Love the chunks of apples and the cake was very moist.  Did not add nuts and next time I will reduce the cinnamon just a tad and may add raisins as suggested.

I used less oil and no salt. I also boiled my apples ahead of time with sugar and cinnamon and walnut extract, I added vanilla to the egg mixture and folded in my apples  and walnuts last. Tastes great !!

Very good! I would definitely make this recipe again. After reading the reviews, I did make a few minor modifications. I cut the sugar back to 1 and 3/4 cups, used 1/2 oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce, and omitted the nuts (I loathe nuts). I used Granny Smith apples sliced thin and then chunked. After 50 minutes in the oven, the cake was baked perfectly. It was very moist and flavorful. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and hubby loved it.

The ONLY additional change I might make next time (and there will be a next time) is to cut down on the cinnamon just a wee bit and use maybe 3 tsp instead of 4. The taste was almost but not quite overpowering. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I'm not much of a baker and I appreciated that it was simple. I used 3 gala apples and it was more than enough, no nuts. After reading reviews I was afraid 2 cups of sugar would be too much so I cut back to 1.5 cups, it was still much sweeter than I would've hoped. Loved the recipe otherwise, will just cut back on sugar next time.

Excellent and really easy to make.  I took another person's review advice and cut the white sugar down and then substituted brown sugar and white in equal proportions.  I also substituted one stick of butter for half a cup of oil and cut the oil down to half a cup.  I also used a bundt pan instead of a 13" by 9" and cooked for 50 minutes.  It's super delicious and would definitely make again.

This cake got raves from around the table this evening.  Moist cake, lovely topping, wonderful aroma filling the house.  Great served warm with ice cream.  I increased the cinnamon by a teaspoon, added 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 1/2 tsp ginger.  I increased the apples, too.  Next time I wouldn't slice them but would cut them into  chunks.  Instead of a 13x8 pan, I used 2 - 8" round cake pans. Perfect.  It's a lot of batter and filled the pans.

Easy and tasty.  I switched out the sugar for Splenda (with the exception of the sugar that went on top). Turned out wonderfully, my husband loves it. Goes great with a cup of coffee!

Thanks for this recipe! I'm an American in China and showed my Wife how to make this. We actually added some extra apples and topped with more walnuts. Was very delicious although a little sweet on the top. She has another in the oven right now....

The recipe was easy to follow and the cake was delicious. I left out the walnuts as I didn't have any on hand, and I substituted walnut extract for the vanilla for the same reason.

I really loved this cake-it makes a large cake, so I took some in to work, and it went over well. My husband and I are knocking out the rest of it. Very moist and a good flavor.

The only thing I did differently was instead of using 1 cup of oil, I used 3/4 cup of plain whole milk yogurt and 1/4 cup of oil, and it worked perfectly. I was actually going to use 1/2 cup of each, but I accidentally used the cup measure and had to think fast! 

It came out amazing anyway. :)

What delicious cake!! I made this for a dinner party, and 7 people demolished the whole thing. I cut the cinnamon by half, added a tsp of nutmeg, and a sixth apple (all Granny Smith)! Will definitely be making this again.

This is a good recipe, still after reading a few reviews I decided to adjust some of the ingredients. 
I used 1 cup of  whole wheat and 1 cup of all-purpose flour.
I used 4 apples and grated 2.5 of them.
I used half of the sugar.
I used half a cup of walnuts  and pecan each.
I am going to substitute half of the oil with apple source next time I make it.

This recipe was a big hit in our home.  It's nice and moist and, a great way to use up apples that have been sitting in the fridge.  I didn't have walnuts so, I used raisins and also, I used less sugar (about 1-2/3 cups) with a pinch of nutmeg.   Will definitely make again.

Absolutely loved this cake! My adult kids raved over it. I did cut back on the sugar to less than 1-1/2 cups. Will be making it often. My apples are sweet/tart, braeburn tasting.

Yummy. Would have given 5 stars but too much cinnamon.  I'll use less next time. Did not have time to mix eggs/sugar for 15 mins with 2 babies! It was more like 8-10 mins.  Decr oil to 3/4 and sugar to 1.5 per other suggestions. Could probably use even less. It was light texture but heavy cinnamon flavor. Ate it warm. Used 2 golden delicious, 1 gala, 2 honey crisp. It was done in 45 mins.  I may have been able to pull it sooner but got busy while it was baking.  Delicious though.

We love this!  The last time I made it, I substituted gluten-free flour (and 1/2 tsp xanthum.  Plus 1/2 of the sugar I substituted with brown sugar.  We also like this with cream cheese frosting!  One of the few cakes my 5yo doesn't just eat the frosting!

I loved this cake! Very moist and tasty. Just a tad to sweet but overall excellent.  Yes I will make it again already saved the recipe! I've really never made a cake from scratch which this is basically is. I did chop my apples up instead of slices. Thank you for having it on this site. I'd recommend it quite highly as you should really love or like it.

This is amazing, i used a Granny smith apples and a  little less sugar because i ran out (oops) also, i omitted the topping because of the lack of sugar and used pecans because i had a bunch on hand... but holy cow- this is an amazing cake.   I also wanted to share the cake so I baked it in two 8x8 tin pans and only cooked it for just under 30 minutes and it was moist and amazing.  Can't say it enough! Next time I will try and chop my apples in smaller pieces just to make the cake easier to cut :)

It smells like Fall! Rave reviews from the family! Made two last night, one in 9x13 and one in springform. I did not include nuts on this first try. Beat egg/sugar for about 4 min. I chopped most of the apples and mixed in, and then did the pretty slices on the top, and it looks beautiful! Served it warm with a scoop of creme brûlée ice cream! YUM

Changes I made:
-scant cup of applesauce instead of oil (yay healthy recipe!)
-can of apple pie filling chopped, rinsed and dried thoroughly, then soaked in a bit of lemon juice
-less cinnamon, plus nutmeg and ginger to taste
- 1/4 cup chopped walnuts
-scant cup of brown sugar instead of white
-no topping
-8x8 glass pan-->lower temp and less time, later realized I should have halved the recipe.

Turned out delicious!

Made this for our local VFW fish fry and it was a big hit.  Definitely believe the 15 minutes of beating the sugar and eggs is essential to prevent the batter from being heavy. To be time efficient, start the beating of the eggs and sugar before chopping the apples. Made a second time in two 9" round layers and iced with cream cheese icing for my Momma's birthday cake.  The two round layers allowed me to put nuts in just one of the layers since some guests cannot eat nuts. Making again now in the late fall with the abundance of extra apples and fresh walnuts!

I followed the recipe to the letter and even though I had to extend the bake time  to 70 min. it still turned out too moist.  Tasted almost like a cobbler and very sweet.  Looked nothing like the picture.  I won't try it again.

LOVE this recipe!!!  I was just curious about the nutrition information. It says the recipe makes 24 serving and the calorie count is 248. Is that 248 per piece? Also can you use a spring foam pan to make this instead of standard rectangle pan? 

One last question, can this also be made into muffins?

It was very moist and fluffy-good, not great.  Beat for 5 minutes-15 minutes is over the top. Used 1 3/4 C of sugar because I was using sweet apples. Cooked in 45 minutes in my oven.

When I first read this recipe, I had my doubts-5 SLICED apples, 4 teaspoons of baking powder and 4 of ground cinnamon!  Boy was I wrong.  Somehow it all came together beautifully.  Moist, just enough spice and it really tastes like an apple cake. Put it together just as directed.  Just added vanilla, caramel gelato on the side. Yum! I used pink lady apples which I pealed and sliced as the eggs and sugar were beating for 15 minutes.  Perfect dessert for the fall season.

I made this cake just last night. I used seven fancy gala apples and they were quite small. I followed the recipe exactly but backed off on the sugar by 1/2 a cup, and used three teaspoons cinnamon instead of four. If I'd been using a tart apple, like Granny Smith's, I probably would have used the whole two cups of sugar. This took sixty minutes to bake, and came out light and moist with a slightly crispy top. It's really good, hubby and I love it! Thanks for the recipe!

Yes! Great way to use up apples. I halved it and made it in a 8x8 like some one suggested. Also added ginger, allspice, ground cloves, and nutmeg. Next time, I'll cut the sugar and sub half applesauce for the oil. And it can take a ton of apples no matter the size! Very dense and moist, just how I like my cake...DELISH!!!

Made a couple adjustments based on preference and altitude.  I reduced the sugar, using 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup brown and added a couple extra Tbsp of flour.  I also grated some fresh nutmeg into the batter.  I refuse to use veg oil so I subbed 1 cup full fat yogurt and threw in a couple Tbsp on softened butter.  This cake was very tasty and moist.  I left half a cake on the counter when I left for work this morning and when I came home I found that my husband and toddler had eaten it all :)

I made it today, but I changed/added a few things. What I ended up with was simply scrumptious!  I had 8 apples that were on their way to apple heaven and I used them all.  I also dredged those slices in the cinnamon sugar mix that was supposed be sprinkled on top.  When I folded them into the batter, along with some golden raisins and chopped toasted pecans, the batter became a lovely brown. I made a second cinnamon sugar mix, added some finely crushed pecans and sprinkled that over the top. I will be making this again, for sure!  I was wondering if there is a typo in the instructions:  surely we are not supposed to beat the eggs and sugar for 15 minutes!!! I would have tried adding a photo but I had to freeze the remainders immediately because I could not stop eating it!

I love this cake. I made one substitution, since it's fall, and used 3/4 cup of pumpkin puree in place of half of the oil. This cake is more airy than Apple Cake V, and was just as well recieved by the family. Will make again!

This is our favorite Apple Cake!! So moist!! I never change anything in the cake recipe. It's perfect the way it's written. I do add more cinnamon and sugar on the top. Making 2 of these today and I am thinking of drizzling a little cream cheese glaze over the top just for a nicer presentation!!

Nice texture and flavor.  Best served warm..  Used tart Stayman apples.  Don't like things too sweet so cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup and left off the topping. Substituted 3/4 cup white whole wheat flour for part of the all-purpose.  Next time might chop the apples because the sliced apples were still firm so it was a little hard to cut through and get clean slices of cake.

Very delicious. I made a few changes. Per other reviewers, I decreased oil and sugar to 1.5 cups. Also, I substituted almonds for the walnuts. I also scattered more apple slices on top, which provided a visual improvement. Next time, I will substitute almond extract for vanilla. I am enjoying a piece now with a cup of coffee and a good book. A keeper.

Best apple cake recipe ever. No need for icing. Beating the eggs and sugar for 20 minutes created a meringue like crust on top when baked, with a very moist cake underneath. Lots of great cinnamon and apple flavor. Best on the first day when the crust is crunchy but still delicious 3 days later, if it lasts that long!

This cake was so much better than I thought it would be.  Maybe the secret is in the beating the eggs for so long?  I don't know, but it was delicious and I think would be good served at breakfast like a coffeecake.

I've been looking for an apple recipe because I just bought a bushel of apples from a local farm. This was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again. I cut this recipe in half, made an 8 inch round cake, and 5 cupcakes. This recipe does not need any frosting. Though I do suggest eating this white it is still warm fresh out of the oven. A touch of vanilla ice cream makes it perfect :) If you are looking for an apple recipe, definitely try this out. It can be made into a round cake, square cake, bundt cake, or even muffins/ cupcakes.

Whew best dang apple cake ever! That is not just my opinion but my co-workers and family as well. I did add 1 tsp allspice to punch it up a notch but even without that it would receive the highest ratings. I've made two so far and have had request for this cake over and over.

I absolutely loved this cake.  I soaked the apples in part of the sugar and cinnamon mixture.  It was delicious!

At first I thought that the recipe should have said beat the eggs and sugar for 15 seconds, not minutes; but I did minutes anyway.  So glad I did.  The cake was light and fluffy.  The only change I made was to use 1/4c of applesauce and only 3/4c of oil.  I love the cinnamon being distributed throughout the cake, instead of just a layer of it.  I baked them in 5 each 7 cup pyrex glass bakeware with a little leftover for a 4 cup bakeware.  Changed the temp to 330.  The 4 cup cooked 15 minutes earlier than the others, but the all turned out great.  I plan to freeze 1 cake to see if it defrosts well or not.  Will update with results.  I made 1 cake without the cinnamon topping just to see what it would be like. The cake is great, with or without the topping.  It's also good with a layer of powdered sugar icing.   My cake was not as dense as the pictures showed, but I think that's primarily because I used 7 small apples and not 5 large ones (that's all I had on hand).  The apples fell to the bottom during cooking.  So I had a layer of crusty cinnamon, fluffy cake and then moist apples.  I love this recipe.

My family loves this recipe. It raises nicely and is moist. I choose to add a little more cinnamon and nutmeg and don't beat for the full 15 minutes as stated and it still turns out fine. Sometimes I make a crumb topping or a glaze instead of the cinnamon and sugar on top.

Super yummy apple cake and really easy to make. I had tons of apples left over from a trip to go apple picking and this was a great way to use them up. Definitely a cake that you don't want to eat warm though--it tastes ok, but can be kind of dry straight out of the oven. If you're going to make this for a group, make it the night before and it tastes unbelievable after it cools completely overnight. The only additional thing I did was let the cut up apples sit in some sugar and cinnamon to give some extra flavor and draw out the juice from the apples. Will definitely be repeating this recipe soon and with pics--it went away to fast the first time!

Loved this recipe. Made a few modifications: sub butter for oil, reduced cin to 3 tsp, added allspice and ground cloves (tsp each), used two pears and three apples that were tossed with lemon juice, reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, split the sugar equally brown and white. Baked in bundt pan and drizzled with carmel sauce. Dang good.

Made this last night with McIntosh apples and finely chopped walnuts and it was delicious! Definitely does not need any icing as it is sweet enough and the cinnamon sugar topping it perfect.

Loved this cake! Tried others on this site that were too soggy. This one had a nice moist texture.  The only thing I changed was cut back by 1/4 c on the sugar since my apples were pretty sweet. We served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Yum!

Like a previous reviewer I cut the sugar amount down to 1 3/4 cups and the oil to 3/4 of a cup.  My apples were very juicy so it worked for me.  I used a combination of mcintosh apples and granny smith.  Since my husband does not like walnuts I omitted them and added pepitas.  Since it's fall I figured they would add the crunch and stay in the spirit of the season.  They worked great, may try substituting them in other things like banana bread now.

This is an excellent recipe that I have made many times. I have, however, modified it slightly: I replace a half cup of the white sugar with brown sugar, and replace a half cup of the oil with butter. Other than that, I follow the instructions exactly.

Cake was very good, love the simple topping and it was so moist.  I would have liked to have a little more spice to the cake however.  I only made half to just try and will have to try some spices to add some fall flavor.

Made per recipe, but used large apples, so it really had a lot!  Sent this to my husband's work and he came back telling me that several had asked for the recipe and some of the guys went back for seconds!  I have to agree.  We "taste tested" it last night and hubby had a second helping "just to make sure it was good." Thanks for the excellent recipe!!!

Super amazing...made this in the morning for a family dinner that day because it contained all the ingredients I had on hand and it turned out amazing..everyone loved it and are still talking about how good it was..I only made one change and that was to cut the sugar to 1 cup, it is sweet enough...and I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any.

i used 5 small granny apples, 2.5 t cinnamon, 1 c sugar, and substituted 1 heaping cup of applesauce for the oil. it tastes too healthy. maybe next time 1.5 c sugar (or use fuji apples), .5 cup applesauce, .5 cup oil.

This cake was delicious and made the house smell wonderful!  I added a little nutmeg and cardamom to the batter and did not sprinkle extra cinnamon and sugar on top.  The level of sweetness was perfect.

Great recipe, very moist and rich! Reminds me that of my retired co-worker's infamous Apple Cake.  I made a few changes one was dicing the apples, I used butter instead of oil and lastly, I only used 3 Granny Smith Apples, as they were rather larger than usual.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  In the future, I think I would make a few subtle changes; I would only use 1 1/4 cups of sugar and no more than 3 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I also skipped the cinnamon sugar at the final step.

This cake was very moist and delicious. I used apples from my tree that I usually throw out every year because they are so tart. It tasted great even though it's not the best looking cake, a little on the dark side for me.

Excellent recipe! It was the first thing gobbled up at a party. I used 1 1/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar, slivered almonds instead of walnuts and stirred the wet ingredients by hand. Will make again and again to use up less than fresh apples.

Extra apples????  Had to go out and buy more just to make this fantastic cake again!  Doubled the cinnamon, and diced the apples, peels and all.  We can't get enough of it.

I made it as stated, just omitted the nuts (cause of other kids at school with allergies) and it turned out FAB!!! I had to pick all the apples from our trees so I have a ton. This is a perfect easy recipe to use for them. THanks for posting this.

This cake was very good.  It was so moist and loaded with apples. Even my husband loved it and he doesn't like anything that isn't chocolate.  I will definately make this cake again.

Pretty good cake.  A bit dry, maybe next time I will use applesauce instead of oil.  I drizzled with a cream cheese glaze for a little treat.

I made this with golden delicious apples from our local orchard for my son's 7th birthday.  My first thought was "Beat for 15min?  Is she crazy?" But I let my Kitchenaid do all the work while I cut up the apples.  We are sugar-aholics so I used the full amount, but will definately cut back as suggested the next time we make it.  Fortunately, a sprinkling of powdered sugar was all it needed to finish it off. Also, perhaps it was because our apples were so large, I will have to either find a larger pan than 9x13 or will need to divide the batter because it did overflow my pan. Overall, I gave it 5 stars because it is such a great recipe!

Not bad, but 40-45 min. would have been plenty long enough.  Did as other reviewers suggested, decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups and oil (canola) to 1/2 cup.
Diced up the apples too.  Still looking for a really good apple cake.

I love it!  It's moist and very tasty.  Everyone who has tasted it has begged for the recipe or for me to make it for them again.  It takes a little time to make but is still really easy!
