I found this by accident. I was intrigued by the ingredients it sounded like a pie that I get from a bake and broil place here in town. I didn't have any lemons and have a lime tree in my backyard( Sorry Mandy) so I decided to use them. I added 3 drops of green food color as well as the zest from the limes. I was very confused about the pan size I started it out in a 9 in. spring form pan then switched the crumb mixture to an 8x8 pan. This worked much better! The taste was Sensational! OMG!! I understand I took liberty with the lemon/lime thing but I figured they are interchangeable. Thank You so much Mandy!! I will make this again and again!

I made this for our Employee Christmas potluck and it was a HUGE HIT! I used Tapioca Flour in place of the corn starch. The Tapioca flour gave the lemony part a much lighter not starchy texture. I could SMELL the vinegar in the lemony filling part which worried me but it must have dissipated over night. Plus I covered the whole lot with whipped topping. The vinegar left no taste behind. The pan was empty at the potluck so it was a real crowd pleaser. The crust is simple and tasty. I will make this again for sure!
