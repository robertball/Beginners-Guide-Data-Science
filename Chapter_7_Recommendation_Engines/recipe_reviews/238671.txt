This recipe saved my life! I was making a bridal shower cake and ran out of granulated sugar for my blackberry filling and all I had was powdered sugar. Well, I never made it with powdered sugar before and it turned out PERFECTLY! So thankful I found this recipe. The only changes I made was I lengthened the cooking time because it took a little longer to thicken, but it might  have just been my stove.

This was delicious, easy, and the texture was perfect.  Next time I'll drain the seeds from the berries.

I couldn't find the cornstarch and used rice flour instead, adding a little extra because I also added the juice of half a lemon.  I also added a good pinch of salt.  I think both were good additions and the results were spectacular for filling a butter pecan cake made from BC's mix.  It's a good mix and not overly sweet like many.
