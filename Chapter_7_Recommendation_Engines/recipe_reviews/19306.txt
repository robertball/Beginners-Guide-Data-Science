Great recipe. Did mine with chicken. If you really are into authenticity, do not leave out the tamarind and substitute fish sauce for soy sauce. Leave out the white vinegar (what's that all about?), instead put 2 TBS lime. Instead of Paprika use 1 TSP (TEASPOON) chili powder (make sure you read TEASPOON correctly or else it will become EXTRA spicy). Definitely substitute PEANUT OIL (or canola) for the vegetable oil. Make sure the peanuts are unsalted, dry roasted. Chop the peanuts instead of grinding. For the tamarind, use tamarind concentrate, about 2 TBS mixed with 1/4 cup water (making tamarind juice). Substitute FISH SAUCE (I use the THAI brand) for SOY SAUCE. Soy sauce should be used for the tofu while it's frying. And it should be used as coloring for the noodles while they are in the pan/wok. Use pickled oriental radish (about 1/2 cup) this adds a great taste to the noodles. These changes were all from researching over 10 pad thai recipes. Tried these changes and it was stunning. Also, if you have shrimp paste lying around somewhere, it would be nice to add a teaspoon of it to the mix. It's great but optional.

The first time I tried it, I found this dish to be quite good, though not 100% authentic. On my second attempt I substituted rice vinegar for white vinegar, peanut oil for the vegetable oil, fish sauce for the soy sauce, and added a dash of sesame oil. I also omitted the paprika and added a quarter cup of coarse chopped cilantro along with the lime wedges and sprouts. The type of noodles used is also very important. I've found that the wide rice sticks give the best results (avoid the "angel hair" type noodles). In my opinion these changes improved the dish.

I used this recipe only for the phad thai sauce based on BES review. Then I combined it with the peanut sauce from the "vegetarian phad thai" submitted by Sarah Kai. Anyway, from trials and errors, this is how I make the really good authentic phad thai. Phad thai sauce: 1/2C white sugar, 2 TBSP lemon/lime juice, 1/4C fish sauce, 2 TBSP tamarind pulp soaked in 1/4C water. (stir all and cook in the stove) Peanut sauce for phad thai: Mix together 2 Tbsp peanut oil/sesame oil, 1 1/2C peanut butter, 1/3C water, 1/3C soy sauce, 1C coconut milk, 1 1/4C brown sugar, 1/3C lemon/lime jice. Season with 2 Tbsp garlic powder, 1 Tbsp pprika powder, and cayenne pepper to taste. (when you make the phad thai, just put in as much as you need, which depends on how much noodles you make and store the rest on the fridge/freezer). How to: Stir fry chopped garlic and chopped shallots on  the wok/skillet until slightly browned, put in minced dried shrimp, chopped salted radish/turnip, and finely chopped thai chilli peppers. Then, just put in your choice of meat, combined all. Put in the noodles, and then the phad thai sauce until all mixed, then the peanut sauce. After this point, you just set it aside, and make room to fry the eggs. Put the noodles mixture on top of the eggs until it's slightly cooked, and combined. Throw in the chopped unsalted peanuts, garlic chives, bean sprouts and julienned carrots. Garnish with beansprouts and lime wedges.

This recipe is awesome!!!Id give it more stars if I could.Ive been going to a Thai restaurant that is almost 1 hour away from my house just to get some pad thai,but I dont think ill be going there again!!This recipe is very easy to make.I only have 2 suggestions on this dish.Here they are:                                                            1-When you decide to buy the ingredients for this dish keep in mind that there are many varities of rice noodles because of the diversity of every country in Asia(meaning all noodles are not the same over there!).Asian markets sell pad thai noodles which are intended for use in pad thai,you may ask for them as Mekong Rice Stick or by their Thai name-> BANH PHO MEKONG.                                                         2-I have realized that you dont have to use the tofu in strips like the recipe suggested,I dont like tofu on a regular basis but my boyfriend does.I solved this issue by just cutting the tofu in cubes and by the time I blended it with the eggs you cant really tell which is egg or which is tofu.This is a good dilemma solution for children or adults because they wont be able to notice the difference and you wont have to give up on the tofu.

i'm giving 4 stars because this was really good, and i'll definetly make it again, but i also followed a lot of suggestions made by others, so i feel the original recipe is lacking. changes i made: 1/4 c rice vinegar instead of white, lime instead of tamarind (but i will use tamarind as soon as i can find it!), 1/4 c seasame oil instead of 1/2 c vegetable, didn't add the salt or sugar at the end, added 2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter to the sauce, used fish sauce instead of soy sauce (although i added a splash of soy sauce to both the sauce and tofu/egg mix), didn't use radish but did add some red pepper flakes, didn't use paprika at all, and added some cilantro at the end. phew. i agree it was just a bit too sweet in the end, even without adding the sugar in the third step; i think rice wine vinegar would be ideal. i also used chinese noodles, personal preference more than anything. next time, i would use a bit less sugar and add some green onions, also as suggested. thanks, nan - it was still great!

This is a very good recipe. Much better than some of the others listed here, at least. I did make a couple changes to make my phad thai super tasty: first, soy sauce is not right here- it's WAY too overbearing - Thai cooking is about delicate flavors and bright notes, soy is just too earthy. Instead, I used it to darken up the sauce - it adds a nice "cooked" color. I also prefer fish sauce in my Thai cooking, so for the quantity listed for the soy, I used fish. I'm still searching for my favorite brand, the one I used this time was Caravelle - it had a subtle fish flavor and wasn't nearly as salty as other brands I have tried. I also disagree with the amount of sugar used - I used less than half the amount and it tasted great! The last missing ingredient was real HEAT! Not that radish stuff! I used dried chili flakes as well as chili paste. Have fun!

For those who want to cook proper and authentic Pad Thai, please read advice from Bes (reviewed on Apr. 29, 2006). The changes she mentioned are absolutely correct. I'm Thai and I've eaten Pad Thai a thousand times since I was little. The dish should be quite sweet, a bit tangy, and salty. For fully authentic way of serving this, sprinkle it with dried shrimp, chopped roasted peanuts, a bunch of fresh chive, a pile of fresh bean sprouts and a lime wedge on the side. If you google the images, you'll know what I mean.

This was the first Thai dish that I have ever made that came even close to tasting authentic.  I used tamarind concentrate that I found at an asian market.  I couldn't find any ground oriental radish (daikon) so I used 1 1/2 tsp of Thai seasoning (from the grocery store) instead.  I used a pound of tofu and omitted the eggs and used turbinado sugar to vegan-ize this recipe.  Even with all of the substitutions, the dish turned out very well.  It was even great the next day for lunch!  ** NOTE: I've found that cooking the noodles according to package directions, and then adding the cooked noodles to the pan works best. Next time, I think I'll add some mushrooms, broccoli and carrots just to give it a bit more flavor and texture (without eggs it lacks some variety).  I highly recommend this easy and versatile recipe!  Be sure to use a BIG wok or skillet!!

This is a delicious recipe.  I made it last week for my boyfriend (first real thai food I've ever attempted) and it was fantastic!  If you want to do a vegan version, you can add a bit more tofu and some more peanut and radish and take out the egg.  Also, I had some trouble finding tamarind pulp even at the asian grocery store, so if you can't find it try a tablespoon of crushed fresh lime, or even lime juice.

I love this recipe. I love shrimp Pad Thai, but my sister is a vegetarian so sometimes it's hard to accomadate her, especially with dishes such as this, but this is a great vegetarian version. I use rice vinegar instead of white vinegar and green onions instead of chives because I like them better. I also add a tiny bit of sesame oil and hoisin sauce to the sauce and I don't use the tamarind or oriental radish.

this greatly pleased chopsy's chops. however chopsy did change the soy to fish sauce.

indeed it is now confirmed by chopsy that "fish sauce is indeed where it is at with pad thai".

highly recommended, chopsy is quoted as saying this is "yummy and flavorful". i too was very pleased

I used a lot of Bes' suggestions. But, the first time I stuck to the recipe, so the rating is based on that. But - I do have to say 1 1/2 cups of peanuts was WAY overwhelming for me. And then on top of that, to use peanut oil? Holy cow. It tasted SOOO good before smothering it in peanuts. I thought it looked like quite a bit of peanuts and was going to cut down, but saw another users review saying she wished for even more peanuts and so, I just kept pouring them in. I have to disagree, there were just way too many, they drowned out the flavor of the other ingredients. Also - if you take Bes' suggestion to use fish sauce - BE PREPARED. This stuff STINKS! The smell cooks out once mixed with the Pad Thai, but the whole family just wouldn't stop complaining about how smelly it was while I first heated it. Save the cooking of the fish sauce for last, or just mix it in when mixing the noodles, tofu, chives, etc. But well worth it! Must be good, my mother-in-law said, "D*mn, Sonya! This is GOOD!"

I'm giving this recipe five stars because I think it *can* be the best one outside of an authentic Thai restaurant.  I was looking at the other Pad Thai recipes on this site, and they seem like they're for people who have never had the real thing.  The REAL thing, made from scratch at a great Thai place (and not the pre-packed Pad Thai from a chain restaurant), is amazing, and this one tastes almost as good.  A few changes (1) of course fish sauce instead of the soya, (2) two limes instead of the vinegar, (3) 1/2 the amount of sugar, (4) Asian chili sauce instead of paprika added the the sauce.  I'd never used or really seen tamarind pulp before, so when I was at the asian market I found tamarind fruit and bought those instead.  After reading the recipe and reviews again, I attempted to peel and seed the tamarind, and essentially make my own pulp.   It wasn't as bad as I thought, the tricky part was getting the seed out.  I processed 6 peeled and seeded fruits with a bit of water in the food processor.  Homemade tamarind pulp.   Those were my only changes but the end result was great!

Only rating this 4 stars because it needs work.  That said, it's the closest thing I've found to the real deal online.  Here's what you need to do to make this authentic:  sub fish sauce for soy sauce (however, throw in a little soy sauce with the egg & tofu for color), sub lime juice for vinegar, MUST use tamarind pulp (if you can't find, you might be able to find tamarind chutney which will work just fine), use canola or peanut oil, add extra garlic, use extra firm tofu (water completely squeezed out), use unsalted dry-roasted peanuts and only use half of what is called for here -- that was way too much, skip the radish if you can't find it, add 1/4 cup chopped greed onions with the chives, sub chili powder for the paprika, and add dried red pepper flakes for heat.  It's really, really easy to make and you will honestly think it's on par with your favorite local Thai joint.  Enjoy!

Well, either the recipie was fixed, or it was read wrong - it says 1/2 cup vinegar.  That's also why it says "adjust the pad thai sauce ingredients to taste."  

A good, tasty, easy recipe, _if you have the ingredients on hand._   If you don't, and don't care about authenticity, there are other, simpler versions that would be better.

This was super good and really easy to make, but woah!  Talk about sugar high!!  We all thought this was waaaaayyy too sweet!!  I tried adding some extra soy sauce, but that didn't help much.  Next time I will most definitely cut the sugar in half, or even less than half.  Like some other people, I subbed shrimp for the tofu.  I also changed the cooking method a little bit.  I scrambled the egg and garlic together, then removed from the pan and set them aside.  I added a little more oil, then cooked the shrimp separately until just barely done, and transferred them to another dish and set them aside.  I then threw the noodles and sauce into the pan, and added the shrimp and eggs, and the scallions.  I don't like my eggs adhering to everything else, so I liked this method better.  I also added some cilantro as a garnish.  To me, Pad Thai just isn't the same without it!  I will most definitely be making this again, but am scaling the sugar back a LOT next time!!

With Bes' changes this is a 5-star recipe.  Tastes just like the real thing.  I suggest using Golden Boy fish sauce, which you can find at an Asian grocery store.  Most regular grocery stores won't carry it and it's the most authentic Thai fish sauces out there.  There was too much sauce, which I had to drain off and added some cornstarch to reduce to a glaze.

Great stuff! I made the sauce as written, but without the sugar added at the end. I toasted some raw peanuts and ground some of them using a mortar and pestle to have different crunchiness. I used shrimp, chicken, and tofu. Added scallion and cilantro to garnish, but mint and lemongrass would be good garnishes too.

Quite good, though the leftovers were definitely worse.  I altered the
recipe following other reviewers' suggestions and what I had on hand: (i)
replaced most soy sauce with fish sauce, (ii) used slightly less vinegar
than called for (80% of real amount), (iii) replaced tamarind pulp with
lime pulp, (iv) left out the oriental radish, (v) used thick
(fettuccine-style) rice noodles.  In addition, I went at whole peanuts
with a mallet and ended with a lot of ground peanut and larger pieces of
various sizes -- this diversity was great!  Also, I replaced the tofu with
chicken that I cooked beforehand (personal preference). Finally, although
I didn't have cilantro at hand, I could see the appeal of another
reviewer's suggestion to add some at the end and will try it next time.
 Note that, as another reviewer observed, the sauce smells and tastes
funny before adding to the noodles, but it still comes out well.  The 
peanuts really make the dish.

There is a typo in this recipe.  2 cups of vinegar?  We made it and our mouths are still puckered!  You should do a better job of proofreading your recipes.  Thanks for ruining a very special dinner party.

I am very picky about my pad thai, so was hesitant to try this recipe. Only made a few changes. Could not find the dried radish, so left that out. Could only find tamarind paste, so used that. Used half lime juice, half rice vinegar. Used fish sauce & only added soy to taste. Cut down the sugar by a 3rd. Really enjoyed this! Better than most Thai restaurants! Will make this often!

Sooo authentic! I made mine with shrimp.  Took another reviews advice and made sauce with lime juice instead of vinegar, fish sauce instead of soy sauce.  I used red pepper flakes instead of chili powder and green onion instead of chives. I also added cilantro.

Substituted fish oil for soy sauce, used peanut oil, and substituted vinegar with 2 tbsp lime juice. Would probably use less lime and a little more salt. Otherwise turned out pretty well.

I, too, substituted rice vinegar for the white vinegar and fish sauce for the soy sauce.  We also substituted asian chile pepper sauce for the paprika.  We will definitely make this again.

The sauce is not correct to my taste, but it is a good place to start.  It's too potent of a sweet/sour sauce so I leave some of the vinegar out and add water or stock to thin it out a bit.  Taste it before you pour it into the wok and make adjustments if necessary.

hmm, this was kind of strange to me.  i took some suggestions and used fish sauce instead of soy, rice vinegar instead of regular, lime juice instead of tamarind, cayenne instead of paprika, peanut butter instead of peanuts and cut back on the sugar.  also all i had on hand was vermacielli (sp) rice noodles.  maybe i should have stayed with the original.  either way i did not really care for this - it tasted too salty and not like pad thai from a restaurant.  i may try it again by tweaking the ingredients further.  i do like a coconut-style sauce so maybe i will try adding that?

The recipe is quite tasty, but the suggestions to change out vegetable oil for sesame oil, paprika for chili powder, etc. are really important.  Definitely good.

Absolutely fabulous!  We loved this recipe.  Of course I could not find the tamarind pulp or the oriental radish.  Subbed tamarind pulp with lime pulp and just left out the radish.  Oh yeah, as others have said you have to soak the noodles in very hot water.  Mine were still not completely soft after 25 or 30 minutes.  So I turned the temp to medium like the recipe said and gradually added about 1 1/2 cups of water while stirring occasionally.  Well it worked, the noodles soaked up the water and were perfect.  I would just add a little water at a time.  I am wondering if I could have added the sauce sooner and not used as much water because I had to let the sauce cook down a little.  Anyway I was worried about all those peanuts too, but they were awesome!  I think I could have actually added more!  This recipe went well with Thai Chicken Curry with Pineapple & Fresh Spring Rolls with Thai Dipping Sauce from this site.  TRY THIS RECIPE!!! AWESOME!

I made this last night, with chicken, and it tasted like what you'd get in a restaurant.  So said my boyfriend and his roommate, anyway.  I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, and did not use the tamarind pulp because I couldn't find it at Safeway.  (The Asian + Hispanic foods aisle failed me!)  Instead, I used lime pulp.  Nor could I find chives, oddly enough, so I used green onions instead.  I chopped the peanuts in a food processor, and added a little extra (1.75 cups instead of 1.5).

If you're a meat eater, I seriously advise the addition of chicken and/or shrimp.  You can add these in the beginning stages (with the oil + garlic), and they'll make it a more filling dish.  Remember to soften your noodles in SUPER HOT water for 25-30 minutes.  Oh, and I think 1/2 cup is way too much oil.  I love oil as much as the next person, but if you use enough to cover the bottom of the wok (1/4 cup or so), that should be plenty.

This was really good, pretty authentic taste. However, that said, I had no tamarind, so I left it out and used some lime juice. I also left out the radish(didn't have it), and added some chili paste, I added a couple of tablesppons of fish sauce and 2 tbsp of natural peanut butter. This tasted just like the pad thai I had    the previous night at a restaurant!

This was delicious! ALMOST as good as from my favorite restaurant :)  I followed several suggestions from others, (adding cilantro, gr onions, omitting radish and substituting tamarind) I also did not put in chicken or tofu and it was great without them. I also prefer a less oily pad thai so reduced the oil by half. Definitely worth giving a try!!

I was suprised by the authentic flavor of this dish. I substituted rice vinegar for the white vinegar, and next time I will use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. Overall my husband and I were very impressed. I'll be making this one again.

wow - even not having everything (missing radish/bean sprouts/peanuts) this was outstanding; based on the recommendations from Bes's review dated 4/29/06.  per my rice noodle pkg, they are to be boiled for 8 minutes which is what i did. made with chicken, not tofu.  cannot wait to make it again when i have everything on hand.   it was so good i forgt to take a picture, we ate it right up!  :-)
thanks for the post Nan.

I took the advice from Bes : Apr. 28, 2006, and My family thought it was like the restaurants.  We like it a bit sweet & spicy and Bes knew what to do.  I also added shrimp in with the chicken.  Wonderful addition to the recipe box!

Good flavor. I love soy sauce so I kept the soy in the sauce minus about 2 tbs worth which I substituted with fish sauce. My only problem? Way too much sugar.

I have made this recipes several times now. I use the mods from the comments (lime juice instead of vinegar, fish sauce instead of soy) and add chicken. It is BETTER than the local thai restaurants that have that ketchupy weird pad thai that I don't like. My husband has been requesting this on a weekly basis now. It will be a staple recipe in my cooking from here on out. Thanks for such a yummy and authentic tasting pad thai!

I used a lot less vinegar then is recommended, but other than that I stay with the recipe as stated. I always get request for this meal, especially from my mother. One of her Thai friend even asked for the recipe stating it is the closest to what she have that remind her of her homeland.

I made this last night and it was delicious!!!  Very easy and tasted just like i had gotten it from a thai restaurant!!!  I like others used fish sauce instead of soy, and used half of the sugar it called for.  I also threw in some chili peppers for spice.  I also used chicken and shrimp instead of tofu.  Overall very impressed with it and will make it again for sure!!

We couldn't find tamarind or dried oriental radish, so made the recipe as directed without it and it tasted delicious! I'm sure it would be even better had we included it, but alas those are tough ingredients to find.

Delicious delicious delicious! I absolutely love Pad Thai, if it's on the menu, I order it. I spent a month in Thailand and this is the closest recipe I've found to being authentic. As most of the reviewers suggested, I used fish sauce instead of soy sauce and lime juice instead of tamarind pulp. I don't like peanuts so I left those out. And it will indeed feed 8 people!

This recipe is a good starting point but definetly needs some sprucing up:  I made my own tamarind paste from raw tamarind as another user suggested. It is a bit of work but definetly worth it. I can't believe there is no SPICE in the original recipe! So when I made my sauce, I added a few tablespoons of hot chili garlic sauce,a tablespoon or so of fish sauce, and also added in a tablespoon of peanut butter and cut WAY back on the sugar (used not even half of what was called for). Since we like our food HOT HOT HOT, I also added in some siracha when I scrambled my eggs. With the changes I made we REALLY enjoyed this recipe!

This recipe was good but next time I will make a few changes. Things that would have made this dish 5 stars....Spice: 1/2 tbsp of red pepper flakes. Garlic: add about 2 more cloves of garlic. Cook tofu with garlic for several minutes..... giving tofu more flavor. 1/2 tsp more of salt. Cook everything in the sauce for several minutes before adding noodles. Also, before placing noodles in water, add 1/2 tsp. of salt to the water.

I used some of the suggestions on the site for my first attempt ever at making Pad Thai. I used rice vinegar instead of white, peanut oil for vegetable, chilli powder for paprika, pickled radish for dried radish, fish sauce for soy but used a little soy when cooking the tofu. I didn't grind the peanuts, just chopped them. I was unable to find tamarind pulp or concentrate but I did find a powdered tamarind soup mix that I added water to and used 2 T of that. I also chopped up some Cilantro to toss in at the end. It turned out EXCELLENT, almost as good as my favorite thai place.

Yummy!  I didn't even have the bean sprouts, and it was still good (though the sprouts would have been a good addition)  
For the noodles,  we boiled them for about 2 minutes, turned off the stove, and then they sat for about 2 minutes.  When you stir fry the noodles, they cook more and absorb the sauce.  You do not want to overcook the noodles or they will turn to paste.

I can't believe that I made this.  I followed a combination of other reviewers suggestions, boiling noodles, adding chili powder.  I was a little skeptical about the fish sauce (i tried it and I'm going to need to air out my kitchen) but  this was good!

OK!!! This one works! I've made pad thai a number of times with disappointing results. This recipe was redemption. I did a few things differently, mostly because of others' suggestions (below). Used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter (added to sauce while it cooked). Didn't have oriental radish so used red pepper flakes. Didn't have tamarind pulp so used 3tsp. worstershire and 2tsp lime juice. Was out of peanuts so left off. I cooked eggs and set aside while I sauteed some chopped veggies: onions, red pepper, carrots. Added snow peas at end. Then mixed sauce and eggs with noodles, threw in veggies at the end and served. You don't need two cups of bean sprouts, either. Maybe a cup.... according to preference. It really was great!

I wasn't sure whether to give this a 4 or a 5 because the taste was 5+, but I did make some reviewer suggested changes. Like using rice vinegar and using lemon juice in place of tamarind.  I used 1/8 cup spicy oyster sauce & 1/8 cup soy sauce and cut WAY BACK on the oil. Since I was serving this with chicken satay I didn't add tofu. I had extra Peanut Sauce I from this site and drizzled that in with the pad thai sauce. My husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven, and so did I. It was unbelievably delicious.

This recipe was great! It tasted wonderful. I cut the amount in half and substituted 1/2 a chicken breast, cubed, and ketchup instead of the tamarind pulp. I also omitted the paprika and the radish, but that's only because I dislike spicy foods. My mistake was that I didn't leave the noodles to soak long enough - I will Definitely fix that next time!

Wow!  This was one of my first attempts at Asian cooking.  I was looking to make something a little different for dinner.  I was also VERY scared of serving my husband and three kids between 7 - 12 TOFU and bean sprouts.

I cannot tell you how much we ENJOYED this DELICIOUS entree!!  Wow!  The TOFU was awesome b/c it took the other flavors into it.  My only problem was that I bought too large a package of rice noodles.  Make sure you stick with the 12 oz. size.  Oh, and I did double the sauce as per the recommendations of others. 

If you're not sure b/c you aren't familiar with Asian foods...please try this recipe first!  You won't be dissapointed!

There was absolutely NONE left when we were finished!!

Thank you SO MUCH for providing this recipe!  Now I have a new culinary direction to get into!!  Superb!

Great recipe!  I used rice vinegar instead of white, worchestershire sauce and fresh lemon juice in place of the tamarind pulp,(tamarind is a main ingredient in worchestershire)I used peanut oil instead of veg oil, cashews instead of peanuts, green onions, snow peas some sriacha sauce and a splash of fish sauce and peanut butter to make the sauce thicker and more nutty.  When its all you have you make due, great recipe thanks again!

Excellent pad thai, although maybe pushing a little far onto the sweet side.  I used mostly fish sauce in place of the soy (I was almost out of soy sauce anyway) and no radishes, and lime in place of the tamarind.  Overall, delicious, and I'd be happy to make it again.

If you follow the suggestions that were given by other reviewers i.e. changing the soy sauce to fish sauce, using less vinegar and adding about 2 tbs. peanut butter, you cannot go wrong!! This is a great Pad Thai recipe and have already given the recipe out twofold. Thanks!!

This recipe is just what I wanted for dinner!  It tasted great and wasn't ruined by my "use what I have" meathod.  I ended up using white wine vinegar, a squeeze of lime where I needed tamarind, thinly sliced sugar snap peas instead of chives, all natural peanut butter instead of crushed peanuts, and less oil (sesame).  So I suppose I just used this recipe as a base and got creative.  Everything still tasted fabulous and I am looking forward to left overs.  Oh, and I added thinly sliced red pepper and shrimp instead of tofu.  A keeper for sure!!!

Tastes amazing. I made this recipe following Bes's Apr. 28, 2006 recommendations. I also cooked this with chicken instead of tofu - I marinated thinly sliced chicken breast with 1 tsp light soy sauce, 1 tsp dark soy sauce, pinch of salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp corn starch and stir fried it before adding it to the eggs as in part 2 of the instructions.

Made this for my girlfriend and she loved it.  I didn't have any tamarind on hand, but at her suggestion (she's a way better cook than I am) I re-hydrated some raisins, mashed them with a garlic press and added some lime juice and it made a fairly good substitution.

This was delicious.  I used peanut butter in the sauce instead of adding peanuts at the end and I couldn't find tamarind at my local grocery store so I did it without.  I also didn't add any meat or tofu.  It still tasted awesome though. I will definitely be making this again.

Very good recipe!  I followed it almost exactly.  I omitted the 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar because the sauce was sweet enough to my liking.  Make sure you soak the noodles until it's flexible but not too soft.  I didn't soft my noodles long enough and had to keep adding water to the pan to cook it.  Consequently, my veggies (I had extra asparagus on hand) were slightly overcooked.  I will definitely use this recipe again for yummy goodness!

We've been making this version for a couple years and love it.  I use lime pulp instead of tamarind (which I can never find). We like chicken instead of tofu, and chop it up into *tiny* bits. We prefer this dish spicy, so I add 2-3 tsp chili paste to the sauce.  I sub rice vinegar for the white, cook the chicken in pure sesame oil, and use 1/8 cup fish sauce and 1/8 cup soy.  The last time I made it, I used these new "5-alarm chili" flavored dry-roasted Planters peanuts at my husband's request. They worked great if you like to kick things up a notch!

Made the dish with most of Bes's suggestions, and it was delicious.  I couldn't find either pickled or dried oriental radish, so had to leave that out, but it was great anyway.

I've tried this recipe twice now, only because I forgot that I didn't enjoy it the first time. I tried implementing Bes' suggestions, but my husband n' I still didn't care for it at all. Maybe it's just us, because this does seem to be a very popular recipe.

This was good but WAY too sweet.  Underneath all the sugar was a good, authentic flavor.  I will try this again and decrease the sugar and increase the acid.  I had cut the vinegar back to half a cup plus the juice of a lime, which totaled about 3/4 c.  Next time, I will use a full cup of vinegar/juice.  More tamarind too.  Definitely worth another try though.

I tried this yesterday and it's awesome!  I took the advice of others and instead of vinegar used three parts lime juice and one part rice vinegar; instead of soy sauce used fish sauce and a splash of soy sauce; I boiled water on the stove put the rice noodles in and took off the heat - done in 5 mins or less; I also toped with honey roasted peanuts - so no need for extra sugar and salt, also used red pepper flakes, will add more spices the next time - this recipe can be easily adapted according to your taste - thanks for sharing!

Gave it 4 stars because it needed "tweaking" just a tad; I put chicken and shrimp instead of tofu and eggs; also jazze up the sauce with chili powder as one person had suggested; omitted the extra sugar and salt at the end...

Oh this was fantastic! Though I made a few adjustments. The sauce in the recipe was WAY too strong! I also only used 8 oz of noodles as that is what comes in the package I buy, so I halved the sauce recipe, added shrimp with the tofu and upped the Garlic to 1 tablespoon. Oh and used Chili Powder instead of paprika.  After those adjustments it was better than our local Thai restaurant!

We liked this a lot...I was unable to find the radishes, so we just left those off...everything else we did according to the recipe. My daughter, who eats Thai food a lot in her college town, said it was almost as good as her favorite Pad Thai there. I'm making it again this week...thanks for a great recipe!

amazing recipe.  This was our first time using rice noodles though.  Maybe we bought the wrong one but it was hard to know when they were "soft" in the cold water and we had to try to rescue them later on when discovering they were way too hard.  Didn't use the pickles and the paprika seemed a little unnecessary but otherwise fantastic recipe!  surprisingly easy.

Pad Thai is one of my favorite dishes so I'm venturing out with new recipes. My fiance liked this one better than the one I  have been using but I would probably cut down on the vinegar or add more sugar. Ours was pretty tangy (which he liked but I didn't so much). I also didn't have so many noodles so my batch had a LOT of sauce. I had to cook it a little longer just to cook out some of the sauce.

I just wasn't super impressed with this! It seemed like there wasn't enough flavor... made for a really "meh" kind of dish.. maybe next time I'll double the sauce?

The recipe was very good, but I feel it could have been made better with the addition of more garlic chili paste, more lime, and a dash of fish sauce.

This was okay but not restaurant style good.  I am not sure what it needed though.  I did replace the soy with fish sauce as everyone had suggested and that improved the flavor.  Perhaps if we try it again add something to make it spicy and possibly switch rice vinegar for the white?

I made this dish tonight for my family. I am a very big fan of Pad Thai, finding it only exceptionally good from one restaurant in San Diego. I must say that this has been a 9 compared to the 10 of that restaurant. I followed Bes instructions, except the peanut oil, used safflower instead. Didnt add additional sugar and since i didnt have fish sauce on hand used regular soy sauce. I made it with chicken. My children and boyfriend loved it and so did I. Although next time, to make it a ten. I will add maybe one more egg. A bit less than peanuts, try the fish sauce and use more chili powder. And also add more lime juice. Maybe even cilantro.  Great recipe, fairly easy, adjust to your taste.

I made adjustments according to Bes's review and my own and it tasted just like my fav restaurant!  Here are the adjustments I made: Double the sauce, use fish sauce instead of vinegar, omit the soy sauce, cut the sugar in half (it was way too sweet as is), and use 2 tbs tamarind concentrate  in 1/4 cup water.  Definitely doesn't need any salt or paprika.  If it's too sweet, just add more fish sauce as you cook.  I didn't think it needed the additional peanuts but don't skip the peanut butter.  Added shrimp and it was delicious!

Really quite good, with the suggested modifications. I wish there were a recipe with the suggested modifications that I could make instead.  This has become my primary Phad Thai recipe. It's a hit, even with people who don't normally like Phad Thai.

It was very good! Tasted like something I'd get from Noodle & Co. I did skip the sugar at the end since I thought it would be sweet enough. I also did not use chives, but used cilantro instead. It was delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I have tried this with and without vinegar and I'd have to say I like it much better without it. Sometimes I replace the rice noodles with soba noodles and boil those 3 minutes with shredded cabbage instead of tofu for more crunch. Dark brown sugar instead of white works better too for our taste.

Needs more sauce.  Paprika is not very zippy.  Recommend zip lovers add more chili.

I didn't soak the noodles long enough, next time I will use half boiling water, half warm water and let it sit longer.  Replaced tamarind sauce with hoisin.  Will try again next time with softer noodles.

Scaled this recipe to yield 2 servings. Did the following... INGREDIENTS: (1) used fresh lime juice vs distilled vinegar (2) used fish sauce vs soy sauce (3) used shelled, dried tamarind (boiled it in very little water to soften then strained it to get the pulp) (4) added shrimps to the tofu (5) used "unsalted, dry roasted" peanuts (6) used pickled oriental radish (can't find "ground, dried" type in the asian store) (7) used green onions vs chives (8) used red pepper flakes vs paprika STEPS: (A) Combined Step Nos. 1 & 3, leaving out the green onions. (B) For Step No. 2, I separately cooked the rice noodles with soy sauce (for color and taste) & small amount of water to soften them. DO NOT OVERCOOK. (C) Combined the pad thai sauce & the pad thai, then added the green onions and stir-fried bean sprouts (cuz my hubby, who stepped in the kitchen, mistakenly assumed that they're supposed to be mixed in. though i was thinking of serving them on the side since he's not much of a veggie fan). NEXT TIME I will... (1) Double the pad thai sauce (2) Add more shrimps/chicken/pork (3) Use paprika or chili powder vs red pepper flakes (4) Use 1/8 cup pickled radish.
Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

Felt this dish was pretty good...almost restaurant quality. Will need to tweak it more to get it there. I only found thin angle hair rice noodles at the store and would definitely change that to thicker noodles. Maybe thicker noodles wouldn't be so dry? I found the dish to be a little dry and the noodles didnt integrate with the other ingredients well. Next time I will change the noodles and see if it is better. Apart from that, I followed a few of the changes as the other reviewers suggested. Would like to see what real tamarind pulp would do to the recipe. Will be on the search for that ingredient for next time I make this.

I liked this alot, I doubled the batch for company and it didnt have enough sauce (probably my fault) but it tasted like a restaraunt, not exactly, but pretty close. It was my first try, next time ai think it will be better. I could not find dried raddish anywhere so taht got left out. I added a little thai peanut sauce and added cilantro from other recipes.

Flavor was  pretty sweet. I'm naive when it comes to rice noodles, so this might be operator error; however, although I let my noodles soak for an hour (used Caravelle per another review), they never softened in the pan. They were chewy, like rubber bands instead of noodles.

YUM - and I love the recipe flexibility. Following other reviews, I replaced the vinegar with fresh lime juice.  I didn't have time to go to an Asian grocery store for tamarind, so instead I just used tamarind nectar (comes in a soda pop style can) that was available at my local Safeway in the Hispanic foods section.  I forgot to buy peanuts, so I just added a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter to the sauce. Everything tasted fantastic, will definitely be making again.

My friends came over just to make this! Adjustments made: skip the tamarind, use rice vinegar + soy sauce instead of white vinegar, use fish sauce instead of soy sauce, use udon noodles instead of rice noodles (couldn't find them in town). Next time, I won't use as much salt.

Prepared the sauce and noodles/veggies/egg/tofu separately for easy freezing (rescaled recipe to 4 servings). Sauce: Combined all sauce ingredients including brown sugar (instead of white), rice vinegar (instead of white), fish & soy sauce (instead of just soy), tamarind soup base paste (could not find pulp), garlic, salt, peanut butter (about 1-1/2  tbsp), fresh daikon (about 1-1/2 tbsp), fresh red chili finely chopped (instead of paprika), and juice of 1/2 lime in a sauce pan. Brought to a boil and simmered until sauce was homogeneous. Divided sauce into ice cube tray and froze. Noodles/veggies: Cooked noodles according to package directions and divided into individual portions and put in freezer bags. Cooked egg and tofu, added to divided noodles. Added portions of sliced carrot, strips of red bell pepper, and bean sprouts to the freezer bags. Added one sauce cube to each bag. To serve: ground peanuts, fresh cilantro leaves (instead of chives), fresh chopped daikon, lime wedge. Next time: Will use fried tofu and make 1.5 times more sauce. Yummy!

Great recipe - very tasty.  One important change I made though is instead of dried radish I used chili pickled radish and just chopped up a few tablespoons of it.  It adds some more spice.  Other than that, I thought this was a great recipe.

This was a very good recipe.   The only thing was that I soaked the noodles as directed but didn't know for how long.  I had prepped all the other ingredients but the noodles were still hard after an hour.  So I put them in hot water and waited just until boiling and that made the noodles really soften up.  I left out the radish, wasn't sure where to find it but kept everything else the same.  My husband said it was great and that we would like it if I made it again (sometimes there are one's to not do again).  Also, I did add about 2 cups of the bean sprouts when I added the noodles too.  They were good in with the noodles and that way they cooked some also.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll be using this again.

1. Presoak rice stick noodles for about 30 minutes in cold water.
2. Skip daikon, it's hard to find and adds almost no flavor.
3. Reduce sugar used to be more authentic and also more palatable.
4. Use raw sugar.
5. Use a mini food processor to chop the nuts.
6. Substitute chicken for soy.

I made this almost exactly according to the recipe and was really disappointed. Way too vinegary, but also kinda too sweet -- and you can't just throw a couple tablespoons of tamarind paste in a dish, it's supposed to be soaked in water and you only use the water. I used peanut oil and added chicken, no tofu. It was edible but I wasn't proud. I don't know how it could be improved and wouldn't make this recipe again.

This comes out just as good as the Thai restaurants. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe (except for omitting the tamarind pulp because I couldn't find any). It came out pretty well. The second time around, I added a tablespoon of peanut butter to chicken and extra peanuts, and followed the suggestions in Bes's review for substitutions. It was amazing!

I liked this recipe and I'll make it again, but I used several of the adjustments mentioned by previous posters. I used: half the sugar in the sauce, rice vinegar instead of distilled, fish sauce instead of soy, extra lime juice in the sauce (I did use the tamarind pulp - wasn't hard to use after I heated it in the microwave with some water for 20 seconds), very hot water to soften the noodles, red pepper flakes instead of the radish, and I omitted the sugar at the end of the recipe. I also added 2 cups of raw snow peas while cooking the tofu to add in some veggies. I did think it was rather dry so next time I'll double the sauce recipe. I definitely liked it, but I don't think I would have if I'd stuck with the original recipe. Also, the recipe as posted says it serves 8 but it's really more like 6. 12 ounces of noodles is just not enough for 8 decent portions.

Finding some of the ingredients were a challenge (I had to hit the Korean market and find an English-speaking worker to help me, and I'm Korean myself!!). However, the pad thai turned out great and tasted pretty authentic! I might leave the noodles in the water a little longer next time, though. They were slightly al dente. Still, 5 stars.

I made this according to the suggestions of "Bes" in the reviews.  It turned out very well.  I omitted the chilly powder and spiced it mildly with chili sauce, and I couldn't find the oriental radish, so omitted that too... didn't seem to miss it.  the tofu really fell apart... next time I would try an extra firm.  Over-all, turned out great.  Tamarind and fish sauce should not be omitted if you want an authentic flavor.

This is sooo good and esay to make.  Pad thai is one of my favorite things to eat and this is just great.  My store didn't have pad thai noodles so I sub'd refridgerated stir fry noodles and it was still great.  Also, couldn't find tamarind pulp, so used the Mexican tamarind juice in a can and tastes fine.  I followed others and put 2 T of super crunchy peanut butter into the pad thai sauce.  The peanuts i bought were salted so I just didn't add any salt in at the end.  But this dish came out perfectly.  The amt of noodles I used was a 17 oz package and it worked well.  Recommend highly!!!

Outstanding recipe - very close to going out. Followed recipe very close but made changes that others suggested. Big ones are reduce oil to about half, add red pepper flakes and hot chili sauce to taste, and the biggest give rice noodles plenty of time to soak before begining to cook. Ours were still tough when placed in wok. Fixed this by adding about 1.5 cups of water and a lid and steamed noodles soft but I think they would've been better if they'd just soaked longer.

I made this for my parents and sister one evening because I love pad thai, but they had never tried it (and are not very adventurous with new flavors).  They made fun of me while I was making it, because it smelled really bad (I used fish sauce and soy sauce), but when it came time to serve it, they ate it all up!  I used shrimp instead of tofu and I used lime juice instead of tamarind.

I love Pad Thai Noodles, this recipe was okay--there were quite a few adjustments made.  I cut back the 1/2 cup oil to 2 tsps, added chicken instead of tofu, didn't add the 1 1/2 T of sugar or the additional salt, and I added about 2 T of peanut butter......now we have good Pad Thai.

Rated as 4 because you have to change recipe to get to perfection but it's a great base. I like it best with chicken. Like other reviewers say, throw in a few tablespoons of peanut butter, little extra lime juice, tamarind, sub fish sauce for soy. Really, you don't have to be too worried about getting everything just right. Just throw it in there. It's a fantastic recipe.

This was delicious! Followed the directions exactly, except without tofu. I was able to find tamarind curry in the Indian section of my local grocery store - and I'm glad I did, because it will be good to use in other recipes as well.

With modifications as suggested. Used peanut oil, added 2 finely diced shallots and minced garlic to oil, cooked a little, then eggs and scrambled, then added noodles and one can of bean sprouts. Cooked until done. For sauce, used fish sauce instead of soy, and lime juice instead of tamarind, and added 2 tbls of peanut butter. Mixed with noodles. Added chives and peanuts, some salt (no extra sugar), some chili pepper as well. garnished with cilantro. Amazing!

This is good, but only with the changes suggested by Bes. I did use rice vinegar (not lime juice) to substitute for the white vinegar, and it still turned out fine. Next time I will use palm sugar instead of the white sugar. I used a couple of chicken thighs plus 12 oz tofu, and there was plenty of sauce to coat all ingredients amply.

Like most everybody who reviewed, I followed Bes' suggestions. I still thought it lacked colour and used some thick soy sauce to give it the dark brown color of pad Thai.

the recipe was easy to make but I felt that the sauce for the pad thai had too much of a vinegar taste. I decided to modify the sauce a bit to tame the vinegar down. my modifications helped make the meal edible. I will use this recipe but will use an alternative sauce next time.

Thought this was a pretty good alternative to very sweet somewhat authentic pad thai.      
Second go 
reduced sugar by 1/2, 
used peanut oil not veg, 
2TBSP rice vinegar and 2TBSP fresh lime with pinch of zest, 
cut the soya to half & added 2 TBSP fish sauce and 
tamarind sauce (couldn't find pulp, used 2TBSP as called for) 
included some shredded cabbage slaw and onions to the garlic, 
fresh cilantro and 
lastly sweet chili sauce instead of paprika. 
This made it a 4.5*

Perfect! First, I only made 1/2 the sauce and it was plenty for one package of noodles-but I guess extra couldn't hurt. I just suggest not dumping whole amount in, add to taste. Followed Bes's review suggestions- so glad I did. Palm sugar, fish sauce, peanut oil, etc made for an incredibly rich flavor! I did use rice wine vinegar for white vinegar though. And squeezed lime over at the end instead of subbing it for the vin. And I used bright red ground red pimento pepper I get at the Asian market. It has virtually no heat and the brilliant red color you want for the sauce- which seams to be missing in photos on here. You can add srirachi or jalepeno to dial up the heat as desired. I used fresh rice noodles and they were delightfully chewy- better than dried. I also used hot pepper-pickled radish. It really added something special! Aside from onion and radish I suggest tossing fresh veg with the hot noodles at the end- that way the veg stays Slightly crunchy. It was perfect. Highly recommend!

I followed the recipe as is except I forgot to add the paprika, plus I couldn't get my hands on ground peanuts or oriental radish. All in all it was a good recipe. Although from reading other reviews regarding authenticity, I still liked it. Now I know the trick to avoiding overly stir-fried noodles: soaking them in water first. (I'm a novice trekking my way to expert cook!) My husband looooved it!

Delicious!  Very forgiving, easy recipe.  For the sauce, I mixed sugar, vinegar, and hoisin sauce.  It tasted gorgeous!

Excellent with the changes that were suggested - fish sauce, no vinegar, soy sauce with the tofu and noodles. Couldn't find tamarind, but subbed lime juice. Couldn't find pickled radish, but used 1 tsp. chili powder. Didn't add the sugar and salt at the end - didn't need it with the extra soy sauce. Also I fried the tofu in LOTS of soy sauce and the oil, then pulled it out with a slotted spoon and added it to the noodles. I doubled the tofu since I don't do egg and don't like bean sprouts.

Came out pretty dry, so I would increase the sauce next time, and add some red thai chiles or more red pepper flakes to give it some heat. Be sure to soak the noodles for at least 45 minutes to become soft enough to eat!

Everything is cheap to buy and easy to find in the store except the tamarind pulp and oriental radish. So, I just left it out and it was awesome! Seriously, this is my signature meal now. The only other thing I changed was substituted lime juice for vinegar. The second time I made this, I added a little water (prob 1/4 cup) to the sauce to make it saucier. That's it! Sooooo good. My dad is super picky and he loved it!

i never knew pad thai could taste this good.  We added some chili for a little heat, and we substituted regular asian radish due to availability.  This was so good!  There is no disappointment here - blows delivery Thai out of the water.

I didn't have tamarind pulp or radish, so made without. It was tame, but good. I added a pound of cooked shrimp about 2 minutes before serving, just to warm them up. (no tofu)

Big fan of pad thai but not this recipe.  It tastes sour to me. I took suggestions and used fish sauce instead of soy and replaced lime juice for vinegar. Not for me.

If you are used to the real pad Thai, find another recipe.  This was a waste of ingredients, too sweet, too much vinegar, and just did not taste like pad Thai!

This was a good dish, probably one of the best homemade Pad Thai dishes we've made, but we recommend using less sugar, frying the Tofu and pay special attention when cooking the noodles, they can be very finicky.

Excellent.  Pad Thai is my favorite main dish, and I've never found a great recipe that I can make at home.  This was it!  I made a few changes -- I didn't have tamarind, so that was left out (though I plan to buy it and try it with), I added 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and a little less soy sauce, and I didn't have the oriental radish, so that was left out.  We like things very spicy, so I added cayenne pepper and ground red pepper flakes.  I used green onions because I like them better than chives in this kind of thing.  For garnish, I topped with shredded carrots in addition to the bean sprouts.  On mine, I also added chopped cilantro, though my husband left that out because he's not a fan.  This was VERY authentic and delicious.  My only gripe is that I didn't make more because we all ate every bit, and I would have loved to have had it for lunch the next day.  This is a keeper!

This was a great recipe, only thing to note though is that I'm rating this as a 5 based on Bes' comments about swapping in the fish sauce for soy sauce and the addition of the shrimp paste really made the dish!

We enjoyed this.  Used tofu and shrimp both.  Substituted fish sauce for the soy and added some cilantro.  Will make again for sure.  Couldn't find the radish but it was still very tasty.

Very tasty!  I'm not sure how authentic it is, but it certainly pleased me and my husband!  I did do some trading with the spices as a few people suggested - I didn't add the additional sugar at the end, and I used some 'Thai seasoning' and chili powder instead of the oriental radish.  I also substituted lime juice for the tamarind pulp because our grocery store had none.  Definitely a dish we'll serve again and keep trying some different flavor combinations just for fun!

I just tried this tonight and I was so excited about making it because pad thai is one of my favorites but I think I used way way too much rice vinegar.  Maybe I will totally omit that because it was bitter tasting. I used the fish sauce instead of soy & lime juice instead of tamarind but it was very bitter - I really I messed this up because I've seen such gret reviews and I followed alot of the common changes.

Delicious! My sister makes this recipe all the time with the tofu. I tried it with the chicken and it was delicious. I havent used the rice noodles before, and did not soak them long enough. When the pad thai was ready, the noodles were still hard. I added a cup of water and simmered on low for 10minutes. I think it tasted even better because it really soaked up the flavor in the sauce. The boyfriend loved it.

This was delicious!!  I was impressed with my cooking skills and I enjoyed making it.   I could not find the tamarind pulp but even without it was a tasty dish!   A word of advice if you don't cook with tofu often...make sure to get firm or extra firm =)

We were really disappointed with this. A half cup of oil seems a bit much to cook the eggs in and when the dish was done the overwhelming flavor was vinegar--actually, that was practically the only flavor.  Not sure why it's so highly rated but to each his own.

i couldnt find the tamarind pulp, so i just went with thai sauce i found at the store, which was very good, but i should have used more. also couldnt find the oriental radish, but flavor was not the issue i had with this recipe.  the problem i had with this recipe was the rice noodle were mushy. i think i should have soaked them until al-dente, instead of soft, because it just turned into a mush ball when i tried to heat through on the skillet. also, is there a way to make bean sprouts slighly soft? they were quite stiff (got fresh bean sprouts in the produce department) while the rice noodles were too mushy, so it was a weird combination.  i also added a couple of tablespoons of cilantro, which was really good. oh, also used chicken instead of tofu.  may try again with a few tweaks, not too sure.

Even though I did modify this due to ingredients on hand, I think it was a great base recipe.  I didn't have radish, chives, or tamarind unfortunately.  I added some peanut butter to the sauce.  This has a very light flavor that I really enjoyed. I will try with shrimp next time.
11/28 EDIT: I've been subbing half the white vinegar with rice vinegar and half the vegetable oil with sesame oil, it make the flavor even better. Also, I've been frying the tofu in large strips in some sesame oil before dicing and adding to the wok - it helps the tofu cook more evenly. I've added chopped cilantro at the end which is amazing too.  Love this recipe!!

This was a good pad thai recipe however not particularly authentic in taste. I found my pad thai to be very 'light' in taste and didn't have the depth of flavours that I am used to when eating pad thai from authentic thai restaurants. Nice but don't know if i will use this recipe again. BTW, definitely use fish sauce and tamarind is a MUST to reach some sort of authentic pad thai taste

I followed Bes's modifications, except that I used both rice wine vinegar and lime juice in the sauce. This was very good. I'd like it to taste a bit more peanuty next time. I think I might also add another egg. And I will up the spice!

This is a simple and great recipe for delicious homemade pad thai! Other reviewers suggested using fish sauce instead of soy sauce but I couldn't find any fish sauce at the supermarket so I stuck to the soy sauce and it came out yummy! I used half the amount of white wine and substituted lime juice for the other half. Also I used chili powder instead of paprika to add a good amount of spice. Next time I will skip the sugar the recipe calls for at the end... it's not necessary. Overall I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!

Great recipe, though I did make a couple of changes based on suggestions other reviewers left and personal preferences.  First, I used raw sugar instead of white, and did not use the vinegar. I eliminated the tofu alltogether and also the radish and bean sprouts since my family are not fans. I used chicken and shrimp, and used at least twice as many eggs as called for, and it came out fantastic. I also added in fish sauce, red pepper, and chili powder to taste.

This was really great with chicken and shrimp.  Be careful to soak the noodles for as long as needed - you can also cook them slightly to make sure that they are not crunchy.

Really amazing!  Will compete with ANY Thai restaurant... I omitted radish and tamarind pulp because I went to 4 stores and couldn't find either... so I used worchestershire instead of tamarind, and lime instead of radishes.  Wow was this good... soaked wide rice noodles for about 30 minutes... after 15 minutes, I drained and added more hot water.

Tasted very authentic.  Delicious!  Noodles need to be cooked, not just soaked in water.  After they are cooked rinse them in cold water immediately to stop cooking.  Yummy!!!

This tastes very similar to pad thai that you get at restaurants, and it really does make 8 servings.  I didn't use the pickled oriental radish, and it was still very tasty!

I was looking for a recipe without fish sauce. I doubled the sauce and added it right before serving. I threw the beansprouts in with the rice stix so they would be cooked just a little. Turned out great!

I am still looking for that restaurant taste pad thai.  I haven been searching for over 7 years and tried over 2 dozen different recipes but NOTHING even comes close to it.  I have no idea what's missing!  My husband and kids liked it but once again, I didn't care for it that much hence, 4 stars.

Yummy.  I subbed 2 tb fish sauce for 2 tb of the soy sauce, added extra paprika, more garlic and chile paste instead of radish.  I also served all the garnishes (peanuts, cilantro, lime, green onion, bean sprouts) on the side.  Yummy, thanks!!

This was not good if you followed the recipe.  Way to much vinegar and tamarind.  Also, it does not state how long to soak the noodles.  I soaked them for about 45 minutes.  I thought all that oil was meant to finish cooking them but they never softened.

Joycie K variation on the Pad Thai:

(4 servings)
I left out the tamarind pulp, dried oriental radish, and chives. I made double the Pad Thai sauce. I also made mine with both chicken and tofu, and added minced onions and slices of red bell pepper (about 1/2 cup each). Served with cilantro and lime. Probably not as authentic, but still super tasty!

This recipe was better than ok but not quite "the Best" I've ever had.  It has great flavour, but it's just not quite what I've had in restaurants.  I find restaurant ones superior in taste and in texture.  It does have an authentic flavour though due to the tamarind pulp so I recommend you take the time to find it.  My hubby liked it a lot so I will be making it again.  Some tips I have for others after trying this recipe for the first time is 1/ to start soaking the rice noodle right away so it has time to soften while you do the other prep/cooking steps; 2/ to soak the rice noodle in HOT tap water to help to speed up the softening process (would have taken too long in cold water); 3/ to strain the Pad Thai sauce before adding to wok as the tamarind I used had fiber and seeds in it; 4/ to add the bean sprouts just after incorporating the Pad Thai sauce as it does need to wilt down a bit (and it helps prevent salmonella poisoning); and 5/ to use "DRIED" tofu which is different than firm tofu - it holds up much better and makes it more authentic.  Changes I made: 1/ added some siracha to add spiciness (what's a Pad Thai without the heat?) 2/ left out most of the chives - just used a little as garnish and for colour and 3/ left out most of the peanuts (I added peanuts to a small amount first to test and preferred it without).  Having said all that it was still enjoyable and different than what I normally make so it will be something I make again.

Thank you for the recipe! I recently moved from a big city to a smallish town and was desperate for Thai food. This was amazing--better than many restaurants I have been to. I didn't have oriental radish and so I left that out. I couldn't find tamarind pulp, so I used lime juice as a substitute (I should point out that I have no idea what tamarind pulp tastes like or if this is a reasonable substitute). The first time I made it I misread the recipe as 1/2 cup of peanuts. Be sure to use all 1.5 cups. I also leave out the tofu and use rice vinegar rather than white. Bean sprouts often look rather bad at my grocery store so I've used cucumber and shredded carrots for toppings. Sorry that this isn't true to the original recipe, but I just haven't been able to get all of the ingredients.

The taste and color turned out wonderful. It was full of flavor. I only give this recipe 4 stars because it was a bit soggy. I'll try cooking the noodle differently next time. I think I let the noodles sit in the hot water too long and it got a bit soggy. Great recipe otherwise!

One more thing, I didn't have tamarind sauce on hand so I used Worstishire sauce instead. Turned out great!!

This is the best recipe for Pad Thai I have ever tried. I did make some changes, most recommended by other reviewers. I used half fish sauce, half soy sauce for the soy sauce; I used peanut oil in addition to vegetable oil, added lime juice, and added chicken. I also fried tofu separately, and added it at the end, along with the fried egg. I also added a few tablespoons of peanut butter to the sauce, because I like the stronger peanutty flavor. This is a great recipe, I will make it again very soon.

I loved this recipe, it turned out great and made great leftovers. I did make some changes based on other review, i used 3 tbs worcehster sauce and 2 tbs lime juice instead of the tamarin pulp. Also i did not use the radish and used green onion instead of chives. Also I boiled the noodles, soaking them takes too long and doesnt get soft enough for me. YUM!

Wow this was so delicious.  I can't believe what an easy recipe it is.  I replaced soy sauce with fish sauce - I think that's really important.  And I couldn't find tamarind pulp but we had the powder.. so I don't know if that is the right substitute, but the dish was fantastic.  I used shrimp instead of tofu and the bean sprouts and  peanuts are sooo important in adding that wonderful texture to this meal.  Thanks!

Yummy & Very authentic. My husband made this and pretty much followed the original recipe. We couldnt find the oriental radish, so he left that out and subsituted lime for the tamarind.  While he was cooking I thought it smelled way too much of vinegar and told him that many reviewers cut down on the vinegar.  However it was too late as he had already added it, but it tasted great! Just like we used to get from our favorite Thai take away in Toronto.  We live in England now and I haven't been able to find a local Thai take away, so we have been craving it for a while.  This really hit the spot and will become a regular dinner in our home.

Good basis for a great Pad Thai - the tamarind and white vinegar should be replaced as many have suggested. But certainly results in a nice restaurant-style pad thai.

absolutely perfect when you add bess's "fixes".  though I don't think it would be below a 4 without them.

Awesome.  I adjusted the recipe to suit the ingredients I had and it was so good. My parents loved this dish. I'll probably be making this tomorrow too.

I followed the suggestions made by Bes (all except the fish sauce, we didn't have any one hand) and this was AMAZING.  This has made my "top dish" list and we will be making again.

This is the one closet to restaurant quality.  I know, I have been looking!  I took the advice of the Bes.  I used 1/4 cup rice vinegar and the juice of one lime instead of the 1/2 cup of white vinegar.  I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup fish sauce instead of the 1/2 cup soy sauce.  I used cilantro instead of chives.  And I marinated chicken breast strips in 1 tsp chili paste, 2 TB soy sauce and the garlic instead of the tofu.  You have to marinate the chicken for a little while before cooking it until no longer pink.  I omitted the extra salt, sugar and paprika.  I might cut down on the sugar in the sauce next time. :-) yum, yum!

A little difficult to manage the first time I made it, but the second time it did not take as long.  I added the whole package of tofu and used a little extra soy sauce.

After reading all the reviews I reduced the vinegar but only having to top the reduced portion up when cooking.I think the author has the taste right.Most foreigners would probably prefer a sweeter taste.The tip about the fish sauce is really useful.I also think that tamarind gives it a more "authentic" taste but lime is great too.Great recipe.Thanks.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I, too, substituted fish sauce for soy sauce and in a pinch substituted lime for tamarind. Even my kids love it! My toddler can't eat it fast enough!

Delicious! I just made a few changes to the sauce: instead of soy sauce only, I used mostly fish sauce with just a touch of soy sauce; I added 2 tbsp peanut butter (but I'm not sure this was necessary); and I used lime juice/pulp instead of tamarind. I also fried my tofu separately until slightly brown before adding it, and I added some defrosted shrimp at the same time. Next time I won't add the paprika at the end; the flavor doesn't really go with pad Thai at all. But overall a great recipe -- as good as the pad Thai I've had at many restaurants.

Wow!  I must admit I was skeptical when I tasted the sauce before adding it to the noodles.  I figured my boyfriend would be stuck with eating all of the the dish because it would have too much of that vinegar flavor.  It actually turned out very well once it was added though, almost like something from a restaurant.  Thanks so much.

This is really good. It has the authentic flavors of a Southeast Asian dish. I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings and used about 1/2 tsp of tamarind concentrate (purchased from ethnicgrocer.com). I omitted the radish; wasn't sure what that was. Personally, I wouldn't put 2 cups of vinegar in any dish. This is a noodle recipe, not a pickle recipe.

I used 1T of date syrup mixed with 1T of water in place of the 2T of tamarind. Reduced sugar in the sauce to 1/4c., and didn't add the additional sugar after.
Added three match-sticked carrots instead of the sprouts (only because I didn't have sprouts on hand!) Ideally, I'd use both.
Family gave it 5 stars. :)

I felt a little overwhelmed by the peanut flavor.  I liked it, it just was a lot.  I also had trouble with the noodle instructions.  I think if I make it again I'll just follow the instructions on the noodle package instead of the ones given.  Visually I was a little thrown too.  It's not the prettiest dish in the world, but if you like peanuts it tastes really good.

I made this last night with Bes' changes and OMG it was AMAZING!! I forgot to go to the garden and pick the chives but I didn't miss anything. It was soooo good, I'm prepared to do it again even though the fish sauce was so smelly (it cooks out). I used a combo of eggs, tofu, chicken breast, and shrimp for proteins. I also added sauteed veggies (cabbage, carrot, broccoli, onion made the day before) because that's how we like it. I gave it four stars because I didn't make the recipe as is - but It's a great start. I doubled the sauce I wanted to have some sauce for leftovers. (I used  about 3/4 the sugar though-so took out 1/4 of the sugar called for). For 2 people 1 used 2 chicken breast, 1 bag of noodles, 8 large shrimp, 3/4 pack of tofu, 4 eggs. I couldn't find tamarind concentrate which I assume is liquid so I had to use paste. Note: Needed to be soaked it in hot water for a couple hours and then put through the blender/mixer to puree. I also used chili paste instead of paprika. I couldn't find the pickled oriental things  or dried shrimp either so I'll have to keep searching. I also used a some peanut and veg oil because I didn't have enough to do all peanut (nor would I want to!) This was perfect! Veg oil was used at the beginning for the proteins and egg cook time, and saved the peanut oil for when everything went together (around the time I out the soy sauce in with the noodles. Can't wait to make this again!!

COOKE the noodles with a splash of soy sauce. COOK the chick en with a splash of soy sauce and sprinkle of garlic  salt. 

LATER, in lieu of paprika, I used 1 tsp chili  powder and omitted the extra extra  sugar. CILANtro in lieu of chives. ONLY  half the peanut s are necessary

I too made some changes and took advice from other reviews. I used only half a cup of organic cane sugar, I couldn't find the radish where I live so I substituted a quarter cup of organic kimchi. Used the fish sauce instead of the sy sauce and used the soy sauce for colouring the noodles and in this case shrimp while they were in the wok. I wont bother with the extra salt next time either, the soy sauce gave it plenty of that. Thank you, fantastic meal.

I have made this several times and find we fall in love with it more and more each time!!!
It is simple to prepare and the taste....unbelievably good.  
I have yet to use the ground radish...haven't even been able to find it where we live so I can't say what difference it makes but since I have ZERO complaints with the "revised" recipe I use (lack of radish) I don't think it's too important.....maybe....;)
I have added chicken now too instead of the tofu and it seems to make for a more complete meal for my family.  
The last time I made it...just last week, I used Seasoned Rice Vinegar and that doesn't seem to have made a difference for what that's worth.

Mine was a five star after I made way too many changes; therefore I gave it a three.  Here are some helpful subs for those who need healthy without sacrificing taste.  Half cup honey instead of sugar,  apple cider vinegar subs vinegar,  liquid aminos subs soya sauce.  I also added some real chicken consumme..which I freeze every time I  boil chicken with bone to avoid msg...to make it stretch.  Added lots of fresh garlic cilantro and green onions.  Salted peanuts eliminates the need for salt at the end...I also added squeeze of lime, s&P to the chicken breast while cooking. Keep a bottle of hot sauce for the heat lovers...definitely keep the tamarind paste though...
Hubby said it was best one yet.  We overate

Substituted soy sauce for fish sauce. Substituted white sugar for palm sugar. Omitted the vinegar and used a couple tablespoons of lime juice instead. Used chicken instead of tofu. Turned out very good. May try it with the white sugar next time to see how much of a difference it makes and which one is better.

This turned out to be very good, but I think next time I will use shrimp or chicken rather than tofu.  I also added snap peas to my dish for a crunch.

I loved it.  So simple. I did not have tamarind paste so I just squeezed some lemon juice and used brown sugar instead of white.  Also put a teaspoon of red curry paste in the sauce.  Also added cut carrots.

The flavor is wonderful, however rather than soak the noodles in cold water, I would recommend following the directions on the noodle package. Soaking them in the cold water added an extra hour to the prep time, which I believe could have been avoided.

Really delicious.  We will be making this often!
We were surprised the recipe called for no heat at all.  It was still great, but we'll read reviews to see how others added it to theirs.
We forgot to pick up tamarind pulp, but read that we could substitute a 50/50 mix of brown sugar and lime juice.

I chose to use some of the substitutions that BES mentioned, for a more authentic Thai meal. I sub'd the soy sauce with fish sauce and diluted the Tamarind concentrate with water. We were unable to find dried, ground radish, so I softened the dried whole radish in some vinegar, then drained the vinegar once the radish was soft and chopped till fine. We omitted the shrimp paste (my husband's suggestion-he is vietnamese, and didn't like it in this dish), and only used the soy to stain the noodles during cooking for aesthetic appeal. 

My one real frustration was with the "soak the rice noodles until they are soft." The package instructions for the wide noodles that we bought wanted the noodles to be soaked for 60 minutes. My husband had me soak them for about 30, and then we boiled them for another 10. That really helped to cut down prep time. 

Overall, the recipe was ok, but I am uncertain if I should have just stuck with the original recipe or not. It didn't taste quite right to me, but now I question if the Thai Restaurants I have been to are making an Americanized version, or if I did something wrong. Next time I may try using the Tamarind without diluting it, and adding red pepper flakes.  It needed more spice.

added 1 pound medium shrimp, couldn't find tamarind sauce so used lime pulp (grated), Can reduce bean sprouts next time, I also added  red flaked pepper. The lime juice squeezed on top really elevates this dish.  My boyfriend says "well, I'll eat it but I don't really like sprouts or pad thai." After 2 bowls, he said "Wow, this is really GOOD!"  It makes 2 huge piggy servings or 6 little-piggy servings. This is just as good as the Thai restaurant I love in Portland MMaine. My first-ever recipe from the magazine. Can't wait to try something else tomorrow!

This is a good starting recipe made great by following Bes's suggestions. I've made this a bunch of times, and I replace the vinegar with 3 tablespoons lime juice, leave out the added salt, add an extra egg, and reduce the peanuts to 1/2 cup (I found the original 1 1/2 cups WAY excessive). I skip the oriental radish only because I can't find any. I also use four cups of bean sprouts and add them in after the noodles to let them cook a little bit, and I usually skip the extra tablespoon and a half of sugar. I have only been able to find tamarind concentrate and use the 2 tablespoons/1/4 cup water mix that Bes suggested. I prefer to fry the tofu separately from the noodles and only mix it in once everything's cooked so that the tofu gets nice and crispy on the outside. With these (admittedly numerous) changes, this is one of my favorite recipes and has become something of a staple in my diet.

It was delicious! I took a few of the simple suggestions: halfed the sugar and didn't add the extra sugar or salt at the end, used half soya sauce and half fish sauce, omitted the oil except for the sesame or peanut oil to fry garlic, and used rice vinegar instead of white, and instead of paprika I added a teaspoon of sriracha sauce. I also wanted to add veggies , so after I sautéed oil, garlic, egg and tofu I added the bean sprouts and mushrooms, and broccoli florets.  I also tried making this with spaghetti squash and it turned out to be a delicious lower carb/ lower calorie option. If your family doesn't like tofu I have also tried using shrimp and scallops... Mm mm. This tastes just like take-out to me!

We are sauce-lovers so I double the sauce on this one.  This is the most asked-for recipe by my kids but they prefer it without the bean sprouts and we add plenty of shrimp and peanuts.

I made the changes people said to make:

fish sauce instead of soy sauce

rice vinegar instead of white vinegar

peanut oil instead of vegetable oil

I also added green onions and shredded carrots which made such a great difference than the batch I made without the veggies. 

Although this recipe was great the only downside is that I felt like it did not taste like the traditional pad thai from restaurants. Still great though.

I am not even sure how to star rate this because I used all of Bes's suggestions, and it was really good (all the kids ate it without complaining which is rare!).  I have tried many restaurant pad thai dishes and have rarely found one as good as her recipe.

I only used the sauce recipe, and used 2 tbsp soy sauce and 2 tbsp fish sauce. Used white vinegar, though I'd try rice vinegar next time. There was enough sauce for 20oz of fresh noodles. My guess is that adding in the extra salt and sugar at the end would not be necessary. I didn't and it was already very flavorful. I probably quadrupled the garlic, the more garlic the better! Also pan fried the garlic with a small chili pepper. Added a nice kick to the pad thai. I'd make this again. Noodle dishes like this are very customizable to your own tastes :)

If they wouldn't have seen me cooking this dish, I would have fooled my family into believing this Pad Thai was from our favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I followed the directions exactly, except I couldn't find tamarind paste, so used "concentrate" instead, which is in a more liquid form.  I just doubled the amount and it came out perfect. Definitely and authentic recipe!  Will make again and again...

Was very happy with how this turned out. I substituted rice wine vinegar for the white vinegar, used slightly less sugar, and also added 2 tbsp of fish sauce to the pad thai sauce. Could have used a little more sauce as the noodles absorbed all of it when cooking. It did have a slightly tart flavor, but I prefer that to sweet. I also added cilantro and red pepper flakes when it was served. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was delicious - although I did follow the comments from Bes which made it spectacular. The only thing I found a bit strange was that it never said how long to cook anything so it was a bit of a guessing game. Turned out great - my household agreed that it was the best pad thai we've ever had!

I was really nervous about this recipe but it was AWESOME! My man told me to add this to the cookbook and  will. I left out the fish sauce because I couldn't find it at the store but it was still great!

This is my  favourite PT recipe....so easy and tastes just like a restaurant.  I add snow peas and matchstick carrots for a little sweetness and colour.  YUM!

This made a LOT of Pad Thai. It was good but the vinegar was a little much.  It think it's unnecessary if you use the tamarind.  I always thought you use vinegar if you didn't have tamarind. Other than that it was great.  I did as others suggested and subbed fish sauce for soy sauce. I also used shrimp and tofu.

This took me a long time to make the first time, but I got it down after making it a few times. Really great with peanut sauce. I agree that the vinegar could be reduced, but it's also good as is.

It was quite good. I liked the fact that it did not have the sticky peanut butter sauce. I added a few more vegetables and overall liked it a lot.

Delicious!  I was hesitant to try to create Pad Thai at home, but this recipe nails it.  I did use the substitutions mentioned in previous reviews for the tamarind pulp and oriental radish but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks!

Yummy, yum yum! I put in veges that were already in my fridge instead of the veges in the recipe and it turned out great. Then I cooked again two nights later for some friends and they loved it too.

Wow, this is a great recipe! So simple. As suggested I replaced tamarind pulp with Worcester sauce & lemon juice. I also didn't have bean sprouts available so used very lightly steamed shredded cabbage which was just great. I also added fresh coriander when serving -- YUMMY!

Pretty good.  I've had gastric bypass surgery so I have a hard time eating things that don't have a lot of sauce.  I ended up doubling the sauce.

The sauce on this was far too vinegary. I didn't like it very much at all. I might make it again, but I would probably add some more soy sauce or subtract some of the vinegar.

Too sweet. I would cut sugar and use less tamarind next time. Also, I think adding ground peanuts adds good flavor.

I love this recipe.  I already have all the stuff in my house so I can make it whenever.  As others have suggested, I use 1/8 cup of soy and 1/8 cup of fish sauce (rather than 1/4 soy) I would also cut down a bit on the vinegar (1/4 cup maybe?).

I to made the changes of fish sauce instead of soy sauce, cutting down the vinegar and adding peanut butter per another reviwers suggestions, and this was really good.  Simple to make.  I added shrimp to mine instead of tofu.  I don't like tofu.  My husband really enjoyed this recipe and went back for seconds.  Something that he hardly ever does!  Thanks for sharing:)

Way too much vinegar! whew!  I added peanut butter and more sugar to cut out overwhelming vinegar taste and was better.  I added prawns as well.  Not a keeper for me unfortunatley...and I had such high hopes :(

Soy sauce should have been replaced with a bit less of fish sauce. Aside from that, the taste is delicious and works great with stirfrying shrimp and shrimp paste.

I made this with some chicken and shrimp it was great. I did not put chives or paprika on it and it still tasted amasing. I used 2 tablespoons of lime juice instad of tamarind pulp and I could not tast a differance. I would suggest that you make sure you have very thick rice noodles. Loved it.

I made a few substitutions & additions to suite my tastes -- I used part soy sauce and part fish sauce and added cilantro at the end.  I also used fresh lime juice instead of vinegar and added red pepper flakes for some heat!  Even without these changes, it is a very good recipe - just remember to soak the noodles long enough, or they will be tough/crunchy.

This was good, but I'd still rather get it at my local Thai restaurant.

Excellent!  I admit I usually just go to Nan's restaurant rather than cook it myself.  I love the flavor of the tamarind.

Very, very good!  I couldn't find tamarind pulp in the ethnic grocery or in the supermarket, but it came out awesome anyway. My husband loved it and can't wait to have it again.
