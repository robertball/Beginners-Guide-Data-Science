LOVED this recipe.  It was quick and easy and Delicious!!  I used real crab though I don't think it matters.  The cheese made it nice and creamy, went realy well with the crab.  Definitely will be making this one again.

Like so many other recipes on this site, this recipe is a great "canvas" upon which more flavorful dishes can be painted.  This reicpe, by itself, is easy and tasty, hence the four stars.  Yet, when one adds three or four slices of bacon (cooked ahead of time), and some diced tomato, this recipe becomes sublime.  Trust me, the saltiness of the bacon and the shasharpness of the tomato wonderfully accent the subtle sweetness of the crab and swiss.

Very yummy indeed. I made a sub for cheddar instead of swiss. I used imitation crab as well. I instead of making it a pie with the store bought crust, i used the 'cheesy quiche crust recipe' on here and made them into mini quiches using a cupcake pan. I used a large mug/cup mouth to make the circle cutout that i used to fill into the pan using that recipe. I had to double up on that recipe because i had extra crab filling left over. however i loved this recipe very yummy indeed thank you :)

This recipe is a very good base. I made it exactly how it said and we really liked it but we both felt like it was missing something. I think next time I’ll try it with some garlic and dill or maybe with some green chilies. It’s definitely better the second day.

I stuck to the recipe but added a teaspoon of Old Bay and a tablespoon of finely finely chopped jalapeno...turned out great.  When you choose your imitation crab read the packages.  At the Walmart I go to one package is made from a blend of Alaskan Pollock and King Crab.  The other package did not list any crab.
