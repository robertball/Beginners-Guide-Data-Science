I made these for a work cookie exchange and they were a hit.  I used the recommended amount of butter and they were just fine.  I think the amount is necessary to solidify in the refridgerator and hold the cookies together.  
I did not use the optional cherrys.  I also did them with both unsweetened and semi-sweet chocolate and both tasted good.
If you love mounds bars you'll love these because they taste just like them.  I was asked for the recipe by several people.  We all wondered if maybe adding an almond would result in an Almond Joy.  I am pretty sure it would.
I recommend doing the recipe as stated and you will have complete satisfaction.

Omg. These were DELICIOUS! I listened to the other reviews and reduced the amount of butter by just a tiny bit. They tasted like mounds candy bars! They were really messy when trying to form them into balls, but other than that, they were a breeze to make!

I was looking for something similar to the chocolate coconut bars I tried from this site, but a little less time consuming.  This was quick and almost a one bowl job...which was a plus.  I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand but when I dug around, I found a package of individually wrapped Dove dark chocolate hearts.  I melted these with a little shortening and they worked fine. I didn't use as much butter called for because I didn't want a buttery taste.  The only problem I had was my chocolate got a little dry and crumbly after being refrigerated, but that's my fault.  It certainly didn't stop us from eating them!  Thanks June.

These are really good but in my opinion the recipe calls for way too much butter! When I was making the cookies, it was literally dripping out as I rolled them into balls.  I squeezed out as much as I could and they were still great. So easy too!

to make shaping these little gems easier, I used a mini-muffin tin. Other than that I made exactly as the recipe calls for and they are now a holiday favorite in my diet - the Gluten Revolution.

These are tasty, a bit hard to handle & shape, but once they're done - yum!  I put a puddle of caramel in the middle, covered  it in chocolate and drizzled w/some more caramel.

Lots of work for this "so so" cookie.  I thought mine were mushy, so I added more coconut.  Like other reviewers said, too much butter is called for in this recipe.  Overall, just not impressed with this cookie.

These were okay. Not entirely what I was expecting. There's FAR too much butter in the recipe. I probably had 3 or so tbs of melted butter at the bottom of the bowl after I pulled all the dough. My hands were just coated in butter afterwards. Can't imagine letting my kids help me with these unless I wanted them greasy.  I ended up using 2 extra blocks of chocolate, 3 semisweet and 1 unsweetened. They're just ok. If I make them again I'll use less butter.

Because of the butter and sugar amounts it is more candy like then macaroon. It still tastes great but almost makes your teeth hurt.

Very easy recipe. I used a little less butter than the recipe called for because of other reviews. Top it with almonds and it like an almond joy..This would also be very good with a little honey mixed in.

These are quite tasty and I am not a coconut fan. They are rich so one will fit the bill. When making the balls its seems like there is too much butter but it works out when the set up. I used semi sweet chocolate and drizzled the top with white chocolate. They look and taste amazing =)

I made these for my son's wedding.  We have family members with a gluten intolerance and these are perfect.  I followed the recipe and thought the amounts of ingredients were perfect.  I used nestle chocolate bits and stuck a whole almond in the top.  They taste just like an almond joy.  Thank you to the person who suggested that in their review.  They're delicious!

Very good. Would have been too sweet with sweetened chocolate. I did not end up with too much butter at all, but did use more coconut and powdered sugar than recipe called for. I will wait to see what Christmas guests have to say

These cookies are GREAT! I left out the cherry (only because I'm not a fan) and just filled the hole with the melted chocolate. We'll be lucky if we have any left for Christmas!

Great for my sweet toothed husband. Next time I'm going to make the balls bite sized instead of cookie sized and maybe use semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened (because of the sweet toothed husband!)Going to make them again for Christmas this year!

I made these growing up in the Midwest. Don't melt the butter, let soften to room temperature. Blend into the powdered sugar , then add the coconut. Use your hand this the easiest way. Chill till just firm, then use a dessert scoop to make the balls , more uniform in size( you can decide just how big). Also a bittersweet chocolate is best. Keeps them from being overly sweet.
