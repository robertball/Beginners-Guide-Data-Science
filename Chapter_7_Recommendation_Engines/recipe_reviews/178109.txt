I just tried this recipe today and it is really delicious.  I didn't have any fresh blueberries, so I thawed out some frozen ones which worked just fine.  Also, I felt like it needed something, so I added some lemon juice which made it perfect!

I also found that the honey was to much. The next time I make it I will add lemon or lime juice to dressing to make it a bit tangier.

I found that the honey was too much, made it too sweet and I prefer a tangy-er flavor with this sort of thing. Otherwise was quite enjoyable

Very quick and easy to make on a lazy summer evening, especially when all the fruit is in season. I often make substitutions when I am missing ingredients or want to add something else (such as strawberries or walnuts), and it makes for a pleasant change.  The honey is a bit much, and you can cut the calories by cutting the coconut - a cup is a bit excessive.

WOW this is SO amazingly delicious! While reading the recipe,I was thinking there ought to be some more acid in it, such as lemon juice, then I saw many of the comments suggest it. So I added about 1/2 teaspoon or maybe less of lemon juice. I also saw how many people thought the honey was too much, and I'd like to make an assertion: The recipe doesn't say what type of flaked coconut to use, but I went with caution and used unsweetened organic coconut, and I think it is meant to be that way. I can't imagine how unbearably sweet this would be with sweetened shredded coconut. I ended up using about 2 Tablespoons of honey. I generally don't love avocado (I find it gross-to-"meh" most of the time), but this recipe changes everything. I have found a fantastic way to enjoy this once unexciting food!
