This recipe works GREAT provided a few basic frying rules are adhered to:

1)  DO NOT fry past the point when no air escapes the food.  The minute steam stops coming out grease is getting in.  

2)  Keep finished pieces in a 250 degree oven until the last one is done, right before serving.  The heat will keep the oil draining off and the batter crispy.

3)  Make SURE the oil temperature is hot enough.  The MINUTE the food goes in the oil loses a good 25-50 degrees worth of heat.  A great candy/fry thermometer or digital thermister is key to keeping a constant oil temp, and adjusting as needed every time food goes in wll keep the results uniform and the food looking good.


This batter is wonderful with beer instead of milk, or in addition to, and small pieces of fish fry more evenly than entire filets.  Keep the basic frying rules in mind and it becomes quite simple to make crispy, NOT GREASY fish and chips with ease.  The other quick tip I'd give is make SURE the food is good and cold, especially the potatoes, before trying to fry.  That will help the them not become limp too.

Being that I am English, and grew up with outstanding Fish and Chips, it's not really surprising that homemade F&C rarely come close to hitting the mark. With regards to this recipe, the chips were quite good (make sure you cut them nice and chunky, not skinny little fries). The fish batter, however, wasn't good - bland and oily, and it turned mushy while the other pieces of fish were being cooked. I MUCH prefer the beer batter in the 'Fish Tacos' recipe submitted by Tanya; the batter is light, crispy, flavorful - exactly how it should be. Thanks anyway.

To those all mentioning the soggy fish effect: Whatever liquid you use, be it water, beer, etc., it must be ICE COLD. That keeps the batter light & cooked fish will not get soggy.

In order to make deep frying easier and turn out better is by 1)keep whatever you are battering chilled.  Put chicken and potatoes in freezer for about 15 - 20 min just to chill.  2)batter needs to be cold as well.  Put batter in fridge for the same duration and you will notice that the batter stays on and fries up better.  Also, for better fried consistency, keep frying oil moving.  When deep frying, move the fish and chips around in the oil.  This will give you consistancy.  Really great recipe.

Long ago I learned from a New Zealand woman to never ever use eggs and milk in a coating batter.  Instead, I use cold water and a tablespoon vinegar.  This makes fried batter much crispier than any other method, and has earned me compliments over the years.

this was my first attempt at frying fish, and it turned out fantastic! my boyfriend and i often hit up pubs to get fish and chips, now we'll save money and make it at home. i followed the suggestions of freezing batter for 20 min, then refrigerating battered fish for 20 min, and it worked just fine. instead of frying the chips, i cut potatoes into wedges and tossed them with some olive oil and seasonings then cooked at 525 for 20-25 min for a somewhat healthier alternative to the frying.

This recipe turned out great! I added Old Bay Seasoning to the dry ingredients for a spicy kick. Other reviewers noted the fish was "greasy" -- fix this by using fresh canola or veg oil, and keep the temp above 325. Keep fried fish warm in a 200 oven to prevent sogginess. For the fries, drain on paper towels, then transfer to a pan or plate and cool to room temp before frying again.

Batter stayed on the fish well and crisped up nicely.  The flavor was fine, but was missing something.  Next time I'll add half milk and half beer.  Other than that, this is a great recipe!

I thought this was very good.  I put the pieces that are done on a platter in the oven set at 200...this keeps them from getting soggy while I continue frying.  I also had much batter left over to make onion rings.

This is the BEST fish & chips recipe ever!  I use halibut fillets instead as it has both the texture and taste just like the ones served by our favourite fish & chips restaurant. I have passed on this recipe to family and friends and I would like to thank Dan for sharing his wonderful recipe!

The batter was a little too runny and delicate for frying.  I added 1/3 cup more of flour to make it thicker.  Also, I think you can get away with only half the amount of salt.  In fact, we found it too salty with the listed amount of salt. Lastly, a quarter cup of oil to fry with is not enough. You have to have more so the fillets can float a little bit and not get ruined at turning.

A good recipe for fish and chips. One hint for makin the batter adhere tightly to the fish is to  Dust the fish 'first' with flour and it makes a glue when dipped into the batter mix. This is the method used for deep frying by restaurants I've worked in.

Although this receipe may be great for some peoples taste, as an a true Brit I would like to suggest some changes, I have perfected a receipe that is as close to fish & chips from a chippy in England as I can get.  Soak the cut potatoes overnight in water, when cooking cook until just turning golden and remove from oil, finish all the potatoes that way and once they are all golden re-fry until cooked. They tates SO good that way. And just use a dark ale like Newcastle Brown Ale and flour for your batter. PERFECT!

This is a very good basic recipe for fish n chips style batter.  Some of my children cannot have dairy, so we used 1/2 plain rice milk and 1/2 beer for the liquid in the batter. We had the oven on at 200 degrees (as suggested by others) and used paper towel-lined baking sheets in order to drain the excess grease and keep the fish warm.  The first fish was crispy even after frying several batches before we ate it.  We cut the raw cod into smaller pieces so they be about the size you'd have them served at a pub. We also fried shrimp (we used basic frozen pre-cooked cocktail shrimp, thawed under cool water) and onion rings.  A double batch of the batter was enough to do enough cod, shrimp and onions for my hungry family of eight people, with some left over.  I also think I added a bit more salt and pepper than called for.  (I'm not sure because we use a grinder for both, but we tend to like our food a little more heavily seasoned than others.) I also put the batter in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes before using it.  I dredged the fish in corn starch before dipping in batter after reading the reviews complaining that the batter didn't stick.  Remember to keep your oil very hot and let it come back up to temperature between each batch.  It was a big hit with the kids age 2-13 and the grown-ups!

Very bland taste as directed, On -n- On, Come on, use your imagination and spice up your cooking folks. You know what you like or how it should taste. Mexican seasoning "Tajin" (lightly spiced Lime seasoning sprinkled on the fish itself) works excellent. The best help would be to keep the batter in a bowl...now follow this...in a bowl with ICE CUBES in it, as well as chill your meat ect., before hand. And keeping your cooked food in a pre-heated and then turned off oven with the door very slightly cracked to allow the steam that makes batter soft to escape. Spice it UP....... Lubie

Unlike some of the other reviews I found this very good. I think some need to read the recipes a little more closely. One reviewer said that a quarter of a cup of oil was not enough for frying the fish. Well the recipe sad use a quart of oil not a quarter cup of oil. Anyway, this is a good recipe. Thank you for shareing.

You will need to keep the oil hotter than 350 to get a crisp coating rather than a soggy one.  That goes for both the fish and the chips.  I used 370 and all was well.

We thought this was delicious, and will definitely make this again. After reading other reviews, I decided to up the spices a bit - I added a few shakes of garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, and a shake of paprika. I used pollack. Make sure the fish is thawed. Also, I squeezed the fish a bit to get some of the liquid out, (this was key to getting the batter to stick) then dusted it with flour, and THEN put it in the batter. It worked PERFECTLY! They were just like you would have from a restaurant. There was extra batter left over, so I battered & fried some halved mushrooms (YUMMY!) and some mozzarella cheese sticks (chopped in 5 pieces) (MMMM). Next time I will also try zucchini sticks or onion rings.

We would give this more than 5 stars if we could.  This was a fantastic meal!  I used catfish for the fish, and cut it up into chunks.  I also used Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss beer instead of milk in the breading.  Finally, I went into the deep dark corners of my basement pantry and pulled out The Tater Twister to make the curley fries.  I kept the fish warm in the oven as recommended, and it stayed beautifully crisp.  The second fry on the french fries (I went about 4-5 minutes until they looked right to me) added just the right crispness to them as well.  I did lightly sprinkle the fries with salt right after the 2nd fry.  It was a fun meal to eat and make, now I must drop into a pleasant post Classic Fish and Chips meal food-coma.  My husband is already in his, napping on the couch!  This recipe will be going into my hand-written recipe box.  Thanks for the great meal!

Some may like this the way it is cooked but trade in for the Butter,Salt,Milk,egg and veg oil. for just flour and a tin or bottle of beer any kind will do {BEER and FLOUR to make a terrific authentic British Fish Batter.

The batter was a little thick, so while the outside was golden, the inside of the batter was a little soggy.  
I followed other reviews and subbed in 1/2 c. of beer, and stuck the batter in the freezer for 20 minutes.  On a whim, we baked half the fries and fried the other half.  Husband couldn't tell the difference, so I'll always bake in the future.

This is a good recipe if you are doing cafeteria-style supper, where each person takes his or her fish right from the fryer and eats it.  If you wait until they're all fried to serve, the coating is already soggy.  Tasty though.

This turned out really great, and I am no good at all when it comes to cooking things in oil, but this turned out just how it was supposed to.  :)  Worked great for our St. Patricks day feast, everyone loved it.  Fun to try with different fishes too.

Mmmm. VERY good! British food is not known for being heavily seasoned or complex. This is what this is - a lightly seasoned treatment for basic ingredients. If you are looking for something with "oomph" this is probably not for you. If you can appreciate simplicity, you'll definitely want to give this a try. One thing to note: This batter is VERY light & fluffy. The egg / baking powder are key and are EXACTLY what my hubs didn't like about this.... He prefers a crisper batter. On the contrary, I was quite pleased with how this turned out (they say opposites DO attract lol!). :) Having said this, you must do a few things to ensure a successful, consistent outcome. First and foremost, BE SURE to cut your cod filets in half (smaller pieces fry more evenly). Last but not least, make SURE your batter, fish and potatoes are VERY cold (I put my fish / batter in the freezer for about 10 minutes and kept my potatoes refrigerated until ready to fry). Stick to these tips (along with a good dose of common sense) and you can't go wrong. Served with mushy peas, homemade tartar sauce (for me) and malt vinegar (hubby), this was a fun meal. Thanks for sharing, Dan! :-)

I only gave this 4 stars because it wasn't as crisp as I wanted.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I used beer instead of milk like other reviews.  I even thinned it out with a little more beer than it called for.  I tested a peice of fish first to see if I liked it.  I add a 1/4 tsp. onion powder & a 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the batter.  It has great flavor! I will thin it out a little more next time.  Other than that it was a good recipe.

I refrigerated the batter for about an hour and used chilled rinsed tilapia fillets. I thought the flavor was good, but did find it a little greasy (but don't think that's really an issue with the recipe)! We will try this again, but will cut the fillets into smaller pieces so they'll cook faster and not have to fry as long.

I don't soak my potatoes, instead i place the cut chips in a strainer lied with a towel. You got to keep things dry if your deep frying. The fish I used was haddoc and it turned out nice. I replaced 1/2 of the flower with rice flower, you could also replace 1/4 - 1/2 of the flower with corn starch.

Good, but I don't know if I'll ever make it again.  I can't handle the amount of oil we're consuming or the amount of oil vapor hanging in the air in the house. The whole place smells like oil for days after making this! However, for an occasional treat, and if you have an enclosed deep fryer to minimize the oil vapor, it's a good recipe.

This is so simple! The batter is fluffy & crispy.  A home run in that department.  Needs a little more taste though.... I will double the salt and do another 1/2 teaspoon of pepper next time. The smaller pieces of fish were better than the larger ones... so I'd suggest cutting your cod to 4" long tops.  This recipe has the wow factor with very little effort!

I didn't get this recipe at all.  It's basically a pancake recipe which means it's way too heavy and thick for fish batter.  English fish batter is supposed to be light and crispy.  Fortunately I tested a small piece of fish with it and when i saw the result, I ended up throwing out the rest of the batter.  It was terrible.

Wonderful! Possibly the best fish and chips I've ever had. The only change I made was to replace the milk with Guiness beer. It was a good idea to put the fish in the oven after frying, they stayed nice and hot and crispy.

Loved it. Used vid. sweet onions instead of potatoes and made onion rings with left over batter. Put batter in frig for 25 minutes, used beer instead of milk, and placed fish and onions in freezer for 25 minutes. Made sure oil (used a cast iron skillet on side burner of grill) stayed at 350, drained well after cooking. Served with tartar and hot sauce. Also added old bay to batter.

SO PERFECT!! Best I've ever had!  Thinned my batter down just a  bit and used 1/2 cup of beer on top of the full calling of milk.  Delish! I also added a half tsp of garlic powder to the batter which gave my halibut a slight lift.  Finally, I rolled my battered fish in Panko bread crumbs for an extra crispyness.  My family loved it.  

Kept them warm at 200 and used the Tartar Sauce recipe on here and WOW!! Best chips and fish we've ever had.  Will never go out and buy them from the soggy fish shop again!

If you're fish are getting soggy, you're doing something wrong.  Lots of good advice on this recipe!  Follow it!

I used the batter to fry my fish, but I added beer in the mix and after frying my fish it had a nice, not to thick coating.  I've used other recipes before and the batter would over power my fish, but this was just right.

Pretty good. I substituted New Belgium Fat Tire beer for 3/4 of the milk. I think this added a lot of flavor. Half milk, half beer is probably a good mix. I had a lot of batter left over, too. I will only make a half recipe in the future. I did put it to good use for some onion rings, though.

Every time I make these, I get the best compliments. Keep fillets cold and make sure they are dry before dipping in batter. Keeping the chips in ice water makes them cook crispier. Any type of fish works for this recipe. Cook chips first and keep warm in 250 oven because your fish will cook quickly. Enjoy

I fish a lot on Devils Lake in North Dakota so we eat a lot of fish walleye perch and northern pike. I have found that with these mild flavored fish that we prefer a liter coating. I have tried many but my guests prefer the simplest one. No recipe at all. Just take a bag put some pancake mix in it shake the 1 inch wide fish in it shake off the excess and go directly to 350 degree oil. Salt right away when you take it out of the fryer. eat it before it gets to the table because people stand there and wait for you to plate it!

I tried this recipe. The potatoes were great. I would use COLD  club soda instead of mlk. It makes the batter lighter. (or you could use beer) Otherwise, nice recipe. The fish batter was just a little mushy.

First attempt at deep frying...anything...only had a meat thermometer but still managed to approximate the right temperature because it came out great! We made with mashed potatoes but the fish was so good we just squirted a little lemon juice on it. The picky eater 5 year old had two pieces. Will certainly do again and may try with a little Old Bay as another reviewer did.

I used swai (basa) fillets with this recipe and it turned out great. I chilled the batter an hour before using, as suggested by a reviewer, and sure enough, the batter thickened nicely. Keeping the temp steady was easy with an electric skillet. Will definitely use again!

This recipe worked perfectly for me.  I think the key with the soggy batter is keeping the temperature at the right level.  Mine were perfectly crisp and yummy and stayed that way long after coming out of the oil.  We also had leftovers which I reheated int he oven the following day and those crisped right back up as well.

I don't recommend using gluten free flour for this recipe.  The flavor was good, but the batter fell right off the fish during the cooking.  I've used GF flour for frying in my DF fryer before and never had this problem so I'm not sure what happened, but the flavor was good non-the-less (I did use garlic salt in stead of regular salt and about 1/2 teaspoon onion powder in the batter)

Wow, I was more impressed than I thought I would be with this recipe.  I used 1/2 cup half & half and 1/2 cup dark beer for the liquid ingredients.  The batter had a great flavor.  I used Tilapia and am going to try it again with Haddock or Cod to get a thicker fish.  I used an electric fry pan to keep the oil at 375 and my fish wasn't greasy at all.  I didn't fry the 'chips' but baked up curly fries instead.  Good meal.

I found this recipe to be not bad in flavor, but the batter soaked up WAY to much oil... I had the temp between 350-375 the entire time... I will try baking mine from now on instead of frying... What a waste of good fish...

Awesome...with just a few modifications :)  I used rice flour (for a delicate-but-crispy texture) and substituted half of the milk for sprite (you can also use beer).  The batter comes out of the frier crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside.  Thanks!! :)

This was so outstanding!!  We were so disiappointed by the soggy fish & chips we kept getting at resataurants, that we had written of Fish 7 chips for quite a while. I decided to try this recipe using Black Cod, and WOW.  We didn't have milk, so we usd 1/2 & 1/2 instead. We also used Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil.  The batter turned out  quite thick (maybe since we usd 1/2 & 1/2),and we were not very optimistic; but it turned out EXCELLENT! We had to really submerge the fish in the batter to get it to stick, so a very fragile fish would probably not withstand that much handling. The end result however was soft, yet crispy, and the taste was to die for.  If you like a more salty taste, you will have to add a tad more salt to the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Sorry this recipe needs a lot of work. It was the most greasiest fish I've ever had not to mention the recipe lacked flavor. Also the breading was so soggy by the time I finshed cooking the last piece...

Very easy, I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen except for the fish. The only steps are mixing the batter and frying the fish.  The leftovers can be fried again in oil and come out just as tasty as the first batch. Kids can help with the batter but not with the frying, the oil can spatter.  Delicious.

This turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  It was crispy and delicious.  I think the key is to make sure your fish is not too wet.  I dried the fish thoroughly and it came out just the way we like it.

Was wonderful after a bit of tweaking. As another review said.. Too salty.I used 1C. flour 1/2 C. cornstarch and a 12 oz. bottle of beer mixed ahead of time.3 hours was fine. No seasoning in batter but did season the flour with Tony Chacheres that I pre dusted the fish with. This batter came out crispy and light and STAYED crispy and light after 20 minutes in the oven while the rest of the fish was fried. It even stayed crisp all through dinner. Not soggy a bit. It took me years to finally get the batter right and I guarantee the cornstarch flour and beer are IT!

This turned out great.  My picky husband even liked it.  I love the second fry on the potatoes, it gives them a nice crunch. I served this with homemade tarter sauce, cocktail sauce and ketchup.

EDIT / Additional Note:
Do not use frozen fish -  the batter will not stick at all. For best results, thaw, squeeze completely dry, chill and then coat and fry. Delicious!
____________________

Fantastic! We have a new family hit.  The batter thoroughly covered the fish, browned up nicely and wasn't greasy at all.

I actually made two versions of the batter - one with all purpose flour and regular milk, and one with Gluten Free Pantry all purpose flour (rice flour) and almond milk.  The only thing I added was a smidgen of Tony's.

I rinsed the fish, drained them, and kept them on a cookie sheet in the fridge until ready to put in the batter.  My thermometer was broken so I don't know how hot the oil was, and I had potatoes in the oven, cooking at 425, so I couldn't use that to keep the fish warm afterwards.  I kept the oil hot enough that the fish started bubbling the second I put them in.  I turned them a couple of times to get them brown on all sides, and took them out while still bubbling.

The regular flour cooked up to a golden brown.  The Gluten Free was a bit thinner and less brown but as for taste - they were the same.

We'll definitely do this again.

excellent recipe. My son had a craving for fish and chips and I had tilapia in the house. It worked perfectly. The Tilapia was firm and supported the batter. I wish I had read about keeping the fish in a 250 degree oven, the fish was a bit too greasy but yummy.The fries were perfect. All in all a successful meal

to all you people out there.  99 percent of the time, if you are getting soggy fish, it is because your oil isn't hot enough, or broken down oil.  i have cooked 1000's of fish in my like.  and that is the only time the fish is soggy for me.  i would have ranked it higher, but i am a panfish and walleye guy.  not cod or whitefish.

This is almost the exact recipe I use for batter. The results are great - cooked on the outside, nice and chewy on the inside as it should be. The method for the chips is good - twice cooked is the way, although user perfectfamily seems to have the method perfected and I would definitely cut them a little thicker than the ones pictured (the example in the picture looks utterly mouthwatering by the way). For anyone who is concerned that the batter is too bland, it can be spiced with any number of aromatic spices (a good curry powder (Madras would work well), dried English mustard powder, ground wattleseed (yummy and nutty if you can get it), nutmeg (I dare you - just try it), and many many more) or herbs. The easiest to avoid flavour clumping is to mix them through the dry ingredients before adding the liquids. For a proper taste and a totally authentic chip shop taste, I wrap the fish & chips in some greaseproof paper, wrap the whole package in some old newspaper, leave for 10 minutes or so to become suitably soggy and unwrap and serve with some salt & malt vinegar, some nice pickled onions and mushy peas (or the condiment/s of your choice).

This was the best recipe i have ever found.  I have some really picky people in my family and this was a huge hit....Thank you so much for sharing and special thanks to all the tips about keeping everything chilled.  Also followed the tip for 1/2 beer and 1/2 milk.... Over all the best one yet.

Batter stayed crispy because I followed the reviews of others and kept it cold before dipping the fish and frying. After each batch, I stuck in back in the fridge and the texture was great. The taste was ok - it could have used more seasoning/salt.  I doused it in malt vinegar anyways.  For the fries, I just oven baked them with olive oil, and Paula Deen's house seasoning (salt, pepper and garlic powder).

Definately a great fish and chips recipe. I'm from the east coast and have had my fair share, as long as follow the nasic deep frying rules, which can be find in some of the first reviews, you should have no problems. I used freash hallibut that I caught my self in Vancouver island, which taste great! I also tried frozen pollock. I made fresh tartar sauce myself as well.

First time I've ever deep fried, but it was easy, and came out fantastic! And I'm not a big seafood eater, either. I was skeptical about getting Cod, because of my dislike of a lot of seafood, but I would definitely recommend spending the money on it. It's a little pricey but comes out super delicious. It's not a fishy taste at all. The breading on this is so good, and the freezing advice worked great, the breading never fell off. Overall great recipe, delicious, I loved it and will make it again!

I believe i'm a pretty good cook, but I don't know what I did wrong.  Even tho I did everything I could do to prevent the fish from being too greasy it still was very greasy.  I didn't over cook- the fish was light fluffy flaky as it should but I didn't like the batter.

if there was a half or no star rating than that would be my rating. but i had to opt for the 1 star. maybe i am being too harsh or i made it wrong(? yeah, right), but it was NOT crispy at all, if you can't chew crispy- then this recipe is for you! i thought the pictures and the previous ratings were promising to my expectations...oh well, you live and learn. i would preferr almost a lighter tempura like battering...i guess, this is just a odd fluffy recipe.  i GUESS on the plus side MY halibut was EXCELLENT on the INSIDE. i preferred to peel off the NON crispy coating though. i am not one to eat any fried foods, but i make a killer batch of chicken fingers and might end up using that coating instead of a batter next time. good luck to those who use this recipe!

I love this recipe!  Only thing I do differently is let the fish set in the batter for a while.  I think it helps the batter "stick" better.

Best fish and chips I've ever made. So simple too. Reccommend using some Basa fish, or some nice thick pieces of halibut. Try it with onion slices and you'll get great onion rings.

Total greasefest thought. Be prepared for feeling guilty.

Yes. Awesome. I used unsweetened almond milk because it's what I always have in the fridge and unrefined coconut oil for frying (waaaay healthier!) and this turned out perfectly. Light and crispy!  I'm really impressed with myself right now :) If you use unrefined coconut oil (and you should), check on it after a minute to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom and, if so, just gently lift with tongs and it will float for the duration of cooking.  Also, I halved this recipe but still used a whole egg and that wasn't a problem.  Thanks!

I took other members' advice and made sure all my ingredients were ice cold and I refrigerated the batter for about 2 hours before using it. I used ice water instead of milk and I dredged my cod fillets in seasoned flour before coating them in the batter and frying. The fillets fried up so crispy and not a drop of batter fell off. They stayed crispy for hours afterward. Excellent recipe!

This batter gives a thick, crunchy coating.  I used sunflower oil and kept the temperature at 340-360 degrees.  The fish I bought were rather thin, so next time I'll use thicker filets to balance this awesome batter.

I made this recipe tonight. The fries were very good and as I always make them but the fish was not. This fish batter recipe brings to mind Yorkshire puddings. The fish was soggy and greasy. My husband ate it, although he said it was not very good, but I could not.

I like the idea for substituting Beer for the Milk suggested for this recipe. Being Lactose-Intolerant, the Beer sounds much safer for me. Thank you for this recipe.

Turned out pretty well. Im abit of a novice cook and dont have much experience with fried foods.I had a bit of trouble with the batter sticking to the pan and peeling off of the fish but after the first couple pieces I got the hang of it. The chips were tasty. A good method for cooking them in my opinion.

8.14.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16580/classic-fish-and-chips/ ... 'Didn't deepfry (so it stuck to the pan somewhat), but still could tell this is a good recipe.  Found it needed a little more salt.  Light, crispy, no doughy part next to the fish. 'Keepin' this one. 8/12 Be sure to use thicker fish, not catfish.  It's a batter not a coating.  With catfish, it tasted fine; but the batter was 1/8+" & there was more of it than fish.  'Still didn't do the potatoes.  :)  Note4Me:  Tried a recipe that coats the fish w cornstarch then soda water/egg batter.  Not nearly as good - although some of the lessthangood review probably has to do with my technique.  "Dockside" in title sounds good for the recipe contest.  :o  :)

I was very dissappointed in this recipe. I really wanted to like it...but it just wasn't very tasty. Having roots in New England, I've had much more flavorful fish & chips. The batter was bland...and the fish only tasted good when I drowned it in malt vinegar. Like I said, I really WANTED to like it but it just wasn't very good. :o(

My hubby just loved this, my 5 year old as well.  Have made it twice and going for my third time tonight.  It's authentic enough for us!

I'm not big fry-guy by any means but this recipe worked out well. I used 1/2 cup of half & half cream and 1/2 cup of Alexander Keiths Indian Pale Ale in my batter mixture. It produced a thick batter which browned instantly. Be sure to follow the basic Fry Rules as posted by previous reviewers. 

One more thing, if you're using a Candy/Fry thermometer make sure that it's almost touching the bottom of the pot or skillet. If the end of the thermometer is only in the oil half way or less you won't get an accurate temperature reading.  

Cheers!

This was very good. It did get a little soggy while i was frying up the rest of the pieces of fish, but leaving it in a hot oven while finishing the remaining batch fixes that. I will keep trying this recipe until i get it "just right". Thanks for posting!

Very good dish!  Enjoyed by the whole family.  It did go soggy if it sat for awhile before eating but with the leftovers, we just stuck it in the oven for awhile and it was good again!  Will make again =)

The fish would have been great if you eat it right as it is finished. If you let it sit until you are completed frying it get soggy. I will hopefully have better luck next time.

This recipe is every bit as good as something you would get at a restaurant. It's really simple, which is nice. I found it took more time to cook than the 25 minutes listed, but it was worth it. Three of my kids, who "don't like fish" liked this, which is why I give it a 5!

Wow - great recipe.  I'd given up on making fish at home, this was my last ditch effort.  It turned out better than any fried fish I've ever had, including Monterey and Morro Bay.  The only thing I would change is to salt the fish after the frying, in addition to the salt already in the batter.  I didn't make the fries, instead I made "Corn Fritters" also from this website.  Thanks Dan for a great recipe!

This came out great. Not to oily and the flavour of the coating was nice. Used some fish my husband caught in Sept. and the fish did not smell fishy at all. Made the batter, let sit in fridge for 30 minutes, added the  fish to the batter and let sit for another 30 minutes. Fried in a shallow pan with olive oil, and then drained on paper towel and placed in an oven at 200. The coating stayed on really well. Was still pretty crispy when we ate it. Will definitely use this recipe from now on for fish.
Did not do the fries though.

This was pretty good.  I took the advice of one reviewer and chilled the batter for about 20 minutes in the freezer before I used it.  I had no trouble with the batter staying on the fish.  My recommendations for this are to cut the salt in half and don't use peanut oil because it takes !!forever!! to brown.

You should add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the batter and a table sppon of baking powder. Lime juice on the fish is also good.

This was a great recipe and fun to eat. It would've been perfect if the fish I purchased was fresh (We shop at the Commissary on base in S. Korea and can only get frozen fish).  Thanks for a recipe that reminded me of my favorite English pubs back in Florida!

The fish was really good, better than any frozen breaded fish you can buy.  The chips turned out so-so, but my family seemed to like them a lot.  I had problems with draining them on the paper towels - they wanted to stick and were hard to get back off for the second frying.  Previous reviewer, Dave, is right - this is not a dish you want to eat very often because it is so greasy.  I measured out one qt. of oil for frying and then remeasured when I was done.  I had used almost 1/2 of the oil. I can hear my arteries hardening!  A great dish to have a few times a year, though.  The batter goes a long way.

I followed one of the tips on this site that said to add some extra flour to make it thicker.  It sort of makes it too thick, so I would advise that you not do this.  A cup of flour should work fine.  Otherwise this is a GREAT recipe, probably could do without so much pepper. I tasted the pepper overwhelmingly in the batter.  Made with frozen cod and it was delicious.

My husband loves fish and chips and is always disappointed when we get it out.  He loves this recipe, best ever.

I don't care for fish so I dipped jumbo shrimp in the batter and was delighted with the results.  

Will absolutely make this again.

I learned after the taking out the first piece of fish to leave them in a couple minutes longer to really get it golden brown and help with the crispness. Although. That was my only complaint, but as crispy as I wanted. It was delicious though!

Made this for my Famjam on Good Friday. I substituted the flour for gluten free flour. It actually turned out amazing. A little on the greasy side but overall really really good. Everything else I did was per the recipe. Will make again.

Made this a couple of times before and it was great. I'm actually making it again tonight. I only give it four stars because of the batter recipe for the fish. Another user posted that they get mushy while waiting, it's pretty accurate. I opted to use a much larger pan with more oil so that I could have multiple fish going at the same time and serve them up quicker; this has done the trick. Last, I like to add some spices to the breading mixture, i.e. garlic powder/smoked paprika/old bay, etc. depending on what I want the end product to be when I cook them that time. Salt and pepper are great, but my personal preference is just to add a little something else to them. Great recipe, though!

I used buttermilk and added some Perrier water for a lighter batter.

Really tasty, don’t think I will ever get batter as good as a proper English chippy but was good and the kids liked it. I added a bit of fried garlic (powdered) to the mix enough to flavour but not overpower.

I use coconut milk for most recipes, including this one.  Accidentally spilled too much baking powder, but it made the batter nice and fluffy, almost like tempura.  Cooked mine in coconut oil, it was delicious.

I've tried this recipe 3 times and the fish came out perfect every time. Following the recipe to the tee, the first time I used the milk only and it was quite tasty.  The second time I tried with  beer only and although the texture and taste were fine, I thought the beer taste was a bit much (probably could have used a lighter beer). Third time I used half milk and half beer, Perfection! I have to mention, the family enjoyed all of my attempts.  I agree  with other reviews, season the flour to your taste.  In addition to salt and pepper I added a little garlic.  No additional salt needed, especially if  you like to use malt vinegar. I don't consider myself a real cook but I can follow recipes and add a few things to make it my own. I think the key to crispy and the lightness of the fish is refrigerating the batter, drying the cod and using medium heat to assure no burn and that the fish is cooked through the batter. I forgot to take a photo, Darn! Next time:-). P.S. Great as leftover too.  Do not warm in microwave, warm in the oven to keep crispy.

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I chalked up the mushy fish batter to my lack of skills.  The 2nd time I brought in expert help.  NOPE, the recipe ought to be removed from this forum.  Here is a quote from another review, "The fish batter, however, wasn't good - bland and oily, and it turned mushy while the other pieces of fish were being cooked".  
I totally agree, (twice that is).  I also see others making the same comment .  

I am now shopping for a new recipe and posting this to maybe save some other hopeful soul desiring Fish and Chips to not waste time here.

My family really enjoyed it. I noticed i had to squeeze the cod to release the defrosted water before placing in batter.  The batter was great but a little bland to me, so i added about  1/2 teaspoon of ground onion and garlic along with the salt and pepper. but all in all it was great

I used 1 Cod fillet, only cook for 1 normally.... The batter was great, it stuck to the fish nicely & was crispy when done... I made the ''Fries'' first, then kept the oil at 350 degrees for the fish ...  I used Tartar Sauce (Mayo & Pickle Relish) along with ''Malt Vinegar'' ... Will make again, very easy & quick!!

I haven't made this in quite a while, but my son, who is home for the summer from college, requested it as his special welcome home meal.  He loves the "fluffy" batter and the crispy fries.  You know it's good when a teenager requests it!

This was the first time I've deep-fat fried anything for more than 20 years.  Since I've gone dairy- and gluten-free, I've had to change a lot of things and fried foods have re-entered my life.  
I used a commercial gluten-free flour mix and gluten-free beer in the batter.  I went a little light on the pepper because my arm got tired of grinding.  I was careful to dry the fish well before coating and kept the temperature of the oil well up in the 350-400 range.  I also cut the fish into 2 inch lengths which worked really well.
I forgot to check the reviews before cooking...won't forget again.  Next time, I'll have onion rings and mushrooms prepped as well as the potatoes.  Maybe even some broccoli florets.
Once my fish was all fried, I still had lots of batter left.  I added more flour and made some fried doughballs.  I don't recommend this.  If you must try it, add cornmeal and grated onions, put it into the oil 1 scant  tablespoon of batter at a time, and call them hush puppies.  
My son and I really liked this recipe, we didn't find it too greasy because I was careful to keep the oil temp up and I kept the cooked portions on paper towels and covered up with several layers of clean white cotton toweling.  I think there will be more fish & chips in our future; I already put more potatoes and a gallon of vegetable oil on the grocery list.

This was awesome and brought back memories of our visit to Ireland years ago!  After reading comment and suggestions from other cooks,  I too decided to use beer instead of milk. I also followed the advice of keeping first batches in the oven at 250 degrees. Turned out great! 

Wrapped up a leftover piece in foil the next day and heated for 10 minutes in 350 degree oven. Made a great fish sandwich and still had some crunch to it!

Made this using Haddock.  Added 3 tablespoons of beer to taste and both my wife and daughter loved it.  Will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe a few times and I like to modify it at times for  a different flavor.  I added 7-up instead of the milk and about 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Ginger-ale is also a nice substitute especially for those of us that are trying to avoid dairy products.

I did everything possible to make the fish crispy (very cold batter and fish) and they still came out soggy. The only things I changed were I added extra seasoning and a splash of seltzer water. It didn't taste bad but I'm not a big fan of this recipe at all. (Did not make the chips)

A little improvement: First dip the fish in flour, then in the batter. It makes the fish stick to the batter better! Other than that, perfetto!

Great starter recipe! I used it for chunks of cod. First of all we are gluten free so I used 1 cup of gum free gf flour. As other folks suggested I decreased baking powder amount to 2 tb. I used 1 cup of buttermilk and then added water until it became the consistency I needed. I also added garlic and onion powders, Italian seasoning and dried dill and a dash of cayenne. Fried fish in canola oil at 350 until golden brown. Fantastic recipe! Happy to have in my recipe box

I followed the core recipe and because of other comments actually tried both ideas. Recipe calls for milk, tried water as was suggested in another comment. Water- yukkk !  Milk was fine although used buttermilk instead. Tasted flour recipe and tasted rather bland so spiced it up with my own tastes. Picture does not look at all like what you make. Reminded me of fish fry but with flour. Will not make again. Guess I'm used to spicey  Louisiana  fish fry from the southern gulf.  Was looking for a fish n chips and this was not it.

I am a true fan of simplicity in cooking. When you only use a few ingredients in a dish, it allows the main ingredient to shine.  When I am making a fish dish, I want to taste the fish.  The same thing goes for chicken, beef, etc.   I do, however, enjoy recipes with lots of steps once in a while.  This one fits the simplicity  category.   
I followed this recipe all the way through except that I used beer in my batter in place of milk.
Delicious!   Not at all greasy and as good as I have had outside of my time in England. 
This recipe might not meet the standards of those who lived in the UK, (because it IS different), but for what is available for us here in the USA, it is very close.cipe!  I'm going to use yours from now on :-)
Thank you Dan for this recipe :-)

Good recipe. As per some other reviews, I used porter ale instead of milk, but otherwise followed the directions. Easy to make, just took a long time in small batches.

This was my first time making fish and chips and the chips came out great! However, I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and at first I was super excited as I stared at my golden brown fish, but I was disappointed when I took that first bite. It was not crunchy or flavorful like i expected. I will try again but with some modifications of my own and report my second try.

I recommend serving this with Malt Vinegar. You can purchase a bottle from Long John Silver's. Or fresh lemon wedges.
Spice up the "tomato sauce"  or ketchup with some course ground black pepper. Let it sit for about 30 minutes.
BTW, I used swai instead of cod.

Very good recipe. I did sub beer for the milk, and followed others' advice about chilling the batter and keeping the cooked fish in a 200 oven while frying the rest. It came out very crispy. The fish was a bit bland, so I will increase the s&p next time. And there WILL be many next times!

Lost my original recipe but this looked pretty close so I gave it a shot and the family loved it every bit of it just as is. Batter on fish is a thin, light crispy coating. Next time i might go half on the salt though. And the fries were yummy even without the sugar that i usually add into the water. However, when I was frying the fish, the batter was coming away from the fish on some of the pieces. Did anyone have the same problem?  I didn't let the batter rest for 20 minutes before dipping since I was rushed for time. Could this be the problem?

Very good recipe and simple to make.  1 pound of fillets should do it if your serving 4.  The thinner the fillet the better because it adds to that crunch we expect from fish and chips.  Also, I refrigerated the batter for an hour before using it and I think it helped to thicken it up a bit.  Don't forget lemon wedges and Malt Vinegar!! - Yummy.

Everyone really enjoyed this.  It is very tasty fresh out of the pan but looses its crunch fairly quickly.  All in all, very good, though.

good tasting fish, loved the flavor and it was a hit with my picky dad, husband, and mom.  I tried baking the fish at first, but that was a bad idea. Stick to the frying.  I baked the fries and they were good, but need some seasoning, maybe some Jonny's.

Batter did not stay on...at all. I was forced to still serve it due to time constraints. Will never use again. Should have read the reviews first, but i was in a rush.

Oh my gosh this recipe is exactly what I was looking for! I used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour, and soy milk instead of regular milk.  I added onion and garlic powder to the batter. I also seasoned the fries with  It was soooo delicious. I am not a fan of fish so I used lean turkey breast instead.  This recipe was great and I definitely will do this instead of ordering take out.  Thank you so much for posting this I really loved it!

I made this for my boyfriend - he loves fish and chips. I don't really fry food ever, and didn't have the right type of pan (electric,) so I just used a big pot and crossed my fingers! I also didn't have enough oil, so I used what I had (about 50% of what the recipe called for.) I put the heat on medium-high, having no idea what temperature that might result in. I changed the batter recipe a little by using 50% milk and 50% beer, and also sprinkled Paps seafood seasoning on the fish before putting into the batter. I served with homemade Tartar sauce (using Trader Joe's mayonnaise, which I won't use for everyday use, but use a lot when cooking because it's cheap, and seems to have a better cooking taste/consistency than Best Foods.)  My boyfriend LOVED this meal. He said that it's better than the fish 'n chips he gets out on the coast (and, it's a lot less expensive!) Next time I'll cook it just a little bit longer, but otherwise it was great!

I left my fish pieces too big so will have to cut them down next time.  Also, I used a cup of Newcastle Brown Ale instead of milk in the batter per another user's suggestion and really liked the taste.

I think this recipe would have been good, but I was so paranoid about overcooking the fish after reading the reviews about them getting soggy, that they got undercooked. Make sure you cook them thoroughly. The parts of the fish that were cooked tasted good! I may try this recipe again.

This was easy and delicious! I cooked it for dinner the other night and my husband and 3 year old loved it, my husband said it was the best fried fish he has ever had.  I did add a pinch of garlic powder but even with out that I think it still would have been delish!

I am giving this a 3 only because I didn't really follow the recipe. I took one of the reviewers advice and used the fish taco batter to use on the fish and chips and it came out fabulous. My family ate 3 pounds of fish and would have eaten more if I had made it. Great advice.

Delicious!  Followed recipe, except for took another reviewers advice and did 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup sprite and fish was wonderful, french fries delish.  Why go out for fish fry when you can make it this good at home.

The fish batter was good - but the whole process isn't worth it! I'd rather go down to the local fish and chips place and buy them!

I'd been searching for fish and chips that tasted as good as we got at a pub in London; this is the closest I've found so far and will become a permanent part of my collection. My only problem was keeping the coating on the fish as it cooked and in serving.

I didnt attempt the chips so I cant comment on that. I had a hard time trying to keep the batter on the fish when I was frying it. However, the batter tasted really good. Oh, and I didnt use cod, I dont actually know the name of the fish i used.

Since this is the first time I try to cook fish and chips, i didnt know what to expect.  The batter taste nice, but ihave to agree with some that it's no more crunchy by the time u serve it.  Any suggestions to make it crunchy?  Still trying to cook the perfect fish and chips.. pls advise..

This was good. Next time I think I will add a little spiciness to the batter.  I think I will also make onion rings to go with it.

Very good recipe! The batter really brings out the flavor of the fish. I used some pollock I had in the freezer and it came out great.
