Delicious! I like to use all-fresh ingredients, so I roasted the bell peppers myself. Just set your oven to broil, cut the peppers in half and seed them, set them skin-up in a glass pan on the top rack of your oven and broil until the skin is blackened (10 minutes or so). Let them cool and then peel the skins off.

This was a DELICIOUS meal! We made a few changes though.  1. Replaced heavy cream with evaporated milk, for reduced fat content.  2. Roasted our own red pepper and made our own tomato pesto (but I'm sure the store bought kind is good and much easier).  3. Drizzled a little olive oil over the finished pasta.  4. Used a LOT less basil, probably a quarter of a cup, at the most. Also a lot less cayenne, maybe 1/4 tsp. All in all, a very tasty meal that I'll definitely make again!

I don't understand what all the bad ratings are about.  If you don't like spicy, the solution is simple: don't add all the cayenne pepper!!  This is really an excellent pasta recipe, it definitely tastes like something from an Italian restaurant.  I used a really good tomato pesto and 2 cups half-and-half instead of 1 cup heavy cream.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great taste, easy to make!  I added fresh green, orange and yellow peppers instead of the roasted, I also put in about a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, otherwise it would've been a bit too spicy.  Great dish!  Can't wait to warm up my leftovers for lunch today!.

I had some ingredients to use and was looking for something a little different but not too involved. This was delicious and one of the few pasta dishes I've made that I felt the pasta/sauce ratio was right on for us. The sauce was thick enough in my opinion before simmering but I did it anyway. With leftover chicken I could easily make this dish in the time it takes to make the pasta. I added a fresh basil garnish and would probably adjust the cayenne depending on my mood at the time.  I scaled it for two in case it wasn't well received but wish I had made enough for leftovers.

YUM!  I had to make some modifications to suite the ingrediants I had on hand.  Skipped the bell pepper, a little short on the pesto so added a little more oil and cream.  Doubled the garlic (we love garlic) and my pesto came with pine nuts in it (they were great with the sauce though)!  I will definately make again.

We loved this chicken, used a can of evaporated milk instead of cream, no cayenne, and added baby spinach and cherry tomatoes. Served with quinoa, will definately be adding this one to the roster!

This recipe proved very tasty.  I substituted regular cream for heavy cream and used dried basil for the fresh.  The  taste was very flavorful.  Definitely a four star meal.

This is an excellent gourmet recipe and the results were out-of-this-world delicious.  I was proud to serve it to a party of 7.  It was very easy to make, and with such fancy ingredients it was essentially fool proof.  I barely made any changes, except I halved the cream, added homemade chicken broth, used made my own homemade pesto (it was sitting in the freezer from centuries ago), and served it over quinoa as a fellow reviewer suggested.

This was an excellent dish. However, the mount of cayenne pepper that it calls for was way too much for my family's taste. I will start with a dash and work up from there next time. I also used angel hair pasta and it was fantastic!Thank you!

The chicken in this was so good! Next time I don't think that I would use cayenne pepper - it was a little over powering and there are already so many good flavors in the dish.  I had asparagus so I put that in - it was a nice addition.

I would give this a five if the meat had more flavor. I seasoned it with garlic salt, and it wasn't enough. I still liked the dish and will make again, but instead I will not cut up the chicken and cook prior to letting it marinate in the pan for 30 min. I'll leave the chicken whole, brown both sides, then add the sauce and let it finish cooking.

YUMMY! I used chicken thighs, they were a better price, just drain the excess fat before adding the garlic. I tripled the recipe. I dialed back the spices due to grand children's young palates. I also used bowtie pasta for the little ones. I served freshly grated parmesan/asiago cheese and garlic powder on the side. 
There were not enough leftovers for lunch. That's the best compliment in my house.
THANK YOU FOR THIS SUPER EASY SUPPER! I will bring this dish, as written, to the next work pot luck.

Absolutely delicious. Used whole wheat pasta, as that is what we eat. Roasted my own red peppers following the directions of another reviewer - easy and tasty! We like a kick, so I went with the full teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Amazing. Also used half and half as again, that’s what I had. Enjoyed with a bottle of wine sent to us from Italy - and felt like we were there! Will make again.

This was really good. We had sun dried tomato olive oil and this seemed like the perfect dish to try it with. I used maybe only half the amount of cayenne/red pepper and we thought it was plenty spicy. I finished off the leftovers over grilled zucchini and that was good too. We would make it again for sure

Used rotisserie chicken cut up and 1 pint of half and half to stretch it. It was a hit at my home. Sprinkled  parmesan cheese on the top of each plate. Nice addition!

BEST recipe ive tried in awhile!! even my fiance' (after  one bite lol) said this is SOOO good! you have to know how picky he is on stuff like this! i kept true to the recipe except just added to it and used fresh ingredients... 3 more cloves and made more of the sauce using more half  and half....i sliced the small sweet red and yellow bell peppers (only about 3) and "fake roasted" them in a skillet on the side to give the appearance of roasting lol seasoned and bowned the check as per another review...  and a very small onion i diced with garlic, tossed that in the skillet with the peppers for about a minute or so decided to throw in the basil to shock it....one the chicken went for the 10mins i followed the rest of the directions..adding shaved parm cheese close to the end of the sauce thickening and also a little mozzerlla and sugar bc i like my tomato sauces sweeter.***oh yea i also used these chicken and mozzerella tortellini things i found at walmart.....thats why i found this sauce and did add things to the recipe.....i put the tortellini in a 9x13 baking dish with just enough chicken broth to cover the bottom then put parm chz and mozzerella on the tortellini put the chicken thighs on that then poured the rest of the sauce on top of that and added more of both cheeses (kinda like a lasagna) baked on 350 degrees until cheese melted left it i the oven to sit until we got home from bowling.... i was so shocked at how delicious this meal truly was!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH F

This is actually my first review, this recipe is so delicious I just had to review it! I am making this today for my husbands birthday as per his request! Simply delicious! I have lots of my own sun dried tomatoes from my garden so I use them with additional Parmesan cheese and olive oil in place of the sun dried tomato pesto. I use the same amount of cayenne and the heat is perfect!

Will make again!  
Didn't have prepared roasted red peppers nor sundried tomato pesto - so I roasted my own pepper and used this recipe to make sundried tomato pesto: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25307/sun-dried-tomato-pesto/.

Also, instead of pasta, I roasted cauliflower, zucchini, asaparagus, onion, and potato using this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9377/roasted-vegetables/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%202.

This caused me a lot of extra work, but it was delicious! I used extra cream to make the sauce a little soupier to cover all the veggies.    For two of us, there were plenty of leftovers, but I ate more than I usually do because it was so good.

Great recipe,I roasted the Red peppers and also roasted some baby portabello's and sliced for the sauce.I used some baby spinach and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.When I browned the chicken I sprinkled it w/Paul Prudomme Poultry Magic which adds a nice flavor.Served over Dreamfield angel hair pasta (low carb pasta)that taste just like reguler pasta.The dish tasted very good and was able to cut some fat and carbs.

Delicious!  Quick and easy.  Halfed the cayenne since I don't like a lot of heat. Half gave just enough kick. Bowtie pasta and a good bread to clean your plate,  yum!

The chicken definitely needed more flavor seasoning or something. But everything else was great.

Delicious and very easy to make! I used farfalle noodles instead of penne but it's the sauce that makes this dish.

5 STARS! My family gave thumbs up to this dish even my little ones. Only thing I did different was roast my own red peppers. FANTASTIC!

Great recipe! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and yogurt instead of cream. Yum!

Great but modified a bit...used sour cream and cottage cheese with 2 tbs of cornstartch in place of heavy cream.  I used fresh garden tomatoes,bell peppers, onion, and garlic for pesto.  Cut basil in half and used oregano and red pepper. Used 4 tbs of olive oil and added kosher salt to taste. Served over bow tie pasta-kids favorite. Extra spicy!!  Loved it...
