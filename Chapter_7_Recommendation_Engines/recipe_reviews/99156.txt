Excellent recipe.  I found the sour cream difficult to spread so I just mixed it with the chicken and spread it that way.  One can of black beans was plenty for my family.  Will definitely make again

My husband and I both loved this quick and EASY casserole dish. I halved the recipe and still had enough for two more meals. I added about a 1/2 cup frozen corn to the halved recipe. I'd definitely make it for a church-covered dish.

HUGE HIT with my bonco group. Only thing I did differently, based on previouse reviews was spread on the sour cream before I layered on the cheese. I had to print 11 copies of this so everyone could take it home & make it themselves. I will definately make this again as I'm sure it would be an awesome leftover the next day.

Super easy and delicious!  I mixed the cheese and the sour cream in with the meat mixture, so my layers were: tortillas, mixture, sauce.  Made it even easier.

I thought this was tasty, and it was easy because I used a roasted chicken from the store. I like that it used black beans, and I think next time I will mix the sour cream with the chicken like another reviewer suggested. I will probably also half the recipe and put in an 11x7 pan.

I loved this recipe!!!  We ran out of sour cream, so I added 1/2 cup of ranch dressing.  It was spectacular!!! I will definitely have to make it again!!!

This I didn't care for because I don't like dark meat.  I may try this some time and substitute refried beans for the chicken - put in more tortillas and maybe let it sit all day in the fridge before baking so they melt into the dish.  Good recipe, just not my taste.

This was easy to make, I followed other reviewers' suggestions and mixed the sour cream in with the chicken, and I used a rotiserie chicken. Next time I will add more enchilada sauce and less sour cream to make it taste more like an enchilada. The leftovers were better than the first night, the flavors blended together nicely the second day.

Took some time to prepare but had a very flavorful result ... didn't taste like a typical pseudo Mexican dish like some enchilada recipes I've tried. The seasonings were just right.

This was very good.  I didn't even have enough enchilada sauce or sour cream and it was a huge hit with the family.  It made a LOT and for a family of 3, this will feed us for at least 3 or 4 meals.  This would be a great potluck or super bowl party recipe.
