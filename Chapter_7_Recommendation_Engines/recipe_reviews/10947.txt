A great Christmas favorite. 
Only difference is that all the coconut is added to the mixture and the balls are rolled in extra ground walnuts.

Simply Great. Cross between a cookie and candy due to the soft interior. Needed a gluten free dessert for Christmas exchange w/neighbor. Did not encounter any problems noted by previous reviewers. Pulsed walnuts/dates in food processor until nice mix of fine and small bits to insure everything held together. No need for extra egg. Placed on parchment paper on cookie sheet, baked the full 17 minutes. They came out of the oven looking like an undercooked cookie w/browned coconut exterior.  No problem...they just need to set. I slid the parchment paper, cookies and all, onto a wire rack to cool completely.  VERY hard to wait....the smell was amazing! But, while warm they fall apart.  Once cool they were perfect and yummy.

These make a pretty presentation on a cookie tray. But most of all they are absolutely wonderful with a steaming hot cup of coffee! Thanks for sharing Suzanne.

These cookies are chewy, sweet, and scrum-didillyumptious! Will be great for my brother who is allergic to gluten...if there's any left! Thanks for the great recipe.

Crispy outside, chewy inside.  I added one egg, as another reviewer suggested, and I preferred the texture when using finely shredded coconut.  You will need to increase your bake time by a couple of minutes.  I solved the sticking problem by baking on a silicone pad.  This cookie doesn't have an overly sweet taste to it, so you can just appreciate the true flavors of the ingredients.  Wonderful!

I love these!!  So easy to make!  I didn't have enough walnuts and substituted one cup with pecans.  Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  These are great!!

these cookies are healthy alternative with no butter or flour. we didn't have enough walnut so we used hazelnut as well. The dough was easy to work with and we had no trouble rolling them into balls and they stayed that way after you baked them. I used fresh grated coconuts, which I prefer, and it turned out really well. We even sprinkled powered sugar for decoration. 
I can see why some people don't like it but they really don't taste bad. You just have to past this mind set of traditional cookies with flour and butter in order to appreciate it.

I was really hoping this recipe would yield some good date cookies.
I was horribly disappointed.
I was sceptical during the mixing process when I was supposed to "roll into balls" because the items didn't stick together with just brown sugar and two eggs.
Then when I pulled them out of the oven they LOOKED good- but they were super stuck to the "ungreased cookie sheet" and they absolutely fell apart when I scraped them off, and the coconut that was "rolled around" the cookie was brown and the center of the cookie was goo.
Guess the search continues for a good date cookie.

The hubby and I loved these! Had to cook them a bit longer - about 17 min. Also needed a bit more coconut for rolling. So yummy!

These were great for the first try.  The reason for the 4 stars was nearly taring them apart removing them from the ungreased pan which was layered with foil to make easyer clean-up.  I'd like to experiment with adding a little dried fruit and maybe some flavored Liqueur.  I'd take a picture but my daughter talked me into letting her take them home.

tasted kind of healthy for a cookie... and I love all the ingredients but I didn't love this "cookie". crumbly and gooey and lacking.

These were splendid! I made them for someone who is gluten intolerant and ended up liking them so much I make them often now. You can change them up and use oats, dried berries, raisins, other nuts.  Yum!

Delicious!  Both my husband and 2  year old are happily munching  away. I ground the walnuts and dates in a mortar and pestle in small portions, which released the walnut oil beautifully, so I didn't have any trouble with the dough sticking together, and they didn't stick to an ungreased  cookie sheet. I  also added a splash of  rum,  which complements the flavors nicely.
