This is a winner. I happened to have Halloween pasta on hand so I used it in place of the wagon wheel pasta too. I'm not a big fan of garbanzo beans so I subbed cannellini beans. Other than that the rest of the recipe was followed. If you have a fall potluck to go to I highly recommend this recipe.
