This recipe reminds me A LOT of what my German mother in law calls her Pastasciutta.... she uses a ton of onions, canned whole tomatoes, tomato paste, paprika and ground beef and lets it slowly cook on the stove all day adding water when needed... It is absolutely delicious, but she never had an actual recipe for me to go by...  
This recipe gave me a good base to work with and then I added and tweaked as I desired! :)   I wanted this to be a meat sauce like hers, but being a vegetarian now, I instead added three packages (approx 2 lbs) of  "Smart Ground".  I also added more salt and paprika (not a big fan of the smoky type, just personal preference) and some other spices that I like and let it simmer on low heat all afternoon, stirring and adding water as needed.  Served it over spaghetti noodles for dinner last night and my family LOVED it!!    Will definitely be making this again and again!  Thank you for sharing, Patrick!

Loved this recipe!  I will definitely make it again.

I did not add a cup of oil, it was way too much for us.  I added just enough to saute the garlic and onions.

I couldn't find the double concentrated tomato paste so I added about 1/3 of a jar of marinated sun-dried tomatoes.  

I wasn't sure about the amount of the smoked paprika but it really gave it a lot of flavor.

This was fantastic! I like some spice in my sauce and also added a dash of red pepper.
