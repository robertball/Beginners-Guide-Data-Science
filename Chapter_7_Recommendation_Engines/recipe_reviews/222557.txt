I made this as described and it was lovely. It was so good that I finished that drink and immediately made another. My husband didn't like his, so I poured his over ice and drank that as well. Even better on ice. Is drank a real word? My only criticism is that it is potent and delicious and I am drunk. Next time i.will double the tea and halve my consumption. ACES!

The classic west coast version of this is slightly different. Add a muddled wedge of orange to the sniffer and a cinnamon stick. Also consider a good Earl Grey such as Mighty Leaf to accentuate the citrus flavours.

The Blueberry Tea cocktail has been a favorite of mine for many years and I usually ordered them out but rarely made them at home.  I use a nice Earl Grey in mine instead of the Orange Pekoe and I think it's a very nice alteration.  Favorite winter time soother!

I like to drink this when Iâ€™m sick with a cold too. I steep fresh ginger slices with the tea and add honey. Makes me feel better and helps me sleep.

I love this cocktail. I enjoy making it with an earl grey tea.
