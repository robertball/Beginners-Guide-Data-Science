I was looking for traditional fried bread. This one is more like a biscuit but it was delicious. I added a little sugar and used milk instead of water.

Simple recipe, one thing I did differently, when the dough mixture was done, I rolled it using a seasoned flour mix , gave the bread a nice flavor! Will use this recipe again!

Thank you! This is how my Potawatomi family makes fry bread. I don’t know what’s up with the yeast in some of these recipes!

This is the first time I made these biscuits.  I found the flavor good but the texture dense.

This easy fry bread recipe rose up beautifully when fried and reminded me of the fried biscuits that I loved as a kid. I sprinkled with powdered sugar and drizzled with honey. This would also be great with fried chicken. We will make this again.
