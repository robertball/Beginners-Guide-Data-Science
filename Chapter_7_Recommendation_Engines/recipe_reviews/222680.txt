What I appreciate about this recipe is that the submitter knows that no matter how individual Italian cooks make their meatballs, there are always just a few, simple, ingredients. These were considerably breadier than I prefer but that might be a discrepancy between the submitter's interpretation of "half a loaf" of Italian bread and mine.  No matter. That's something easily adjusted and a matter of personal taste anyway. Even  if I thought them a little bready, that did not discount the fact they were incredibly aromatic and flavorful.  I'm sure both the chicken broth and the small amount of Italian sausage are responsible for that.  Still, if it is easier for a cook giving this a whirl to just use all beef or a pre-packaged "meatloaf" mix of beef, pork and veal, the meatballs would be equally as good.

Thanks Bon, for another winning recipe! The finest compliment I can receive is from my husband's drooling mouth! I baked the meatballs rather than frying and as the aroma was wafting through the house, he kept murmuring how good they smelled. Then, when out of the oven, he kept circling the baking pan. I told him to have one and he said no, that he wanted to wait until tomorrow's dinner. What control! Well, I didn't wait. Popped one in my mouth to devour a little bit of heaven in one bite! Thank you again, my friend!

The best meatballs ever...sorry Momma... he did learn from the best! I prefer the fried meatballs not in the sauce with plenty of sauce on top with my pasta. I have been wanting to review Bon Appetit for the longest time. I am his favorite fan...

As or the flavor, absolutely fantastic!  I was worried because I thought I should add some herbs, resisted doing it and glad I did.  Everybody loved them!  As for cooking, I browned them in butter with olive oils and finished them in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes. Great leftovers on a sandwich with marinara sauce.

The amount of egg varys by the size of the egg. I also add more cheese 1/2 lb is the usual amount. For the original my recipe go to my recipe box it is right next to this recipe.

Every time someone cooks this dish, ten italian grannies die all over the country.

Please don't say this is  an italian recipe!!!! Nobody would evere think about cokking such a (for us) terrible thing in Italy!
You can eat it if you like, but please don't say it's tipically italian: we would be really hurt by this declaration.

Sincerously, 
an proud italian.

P.S.: please don't take offence at my message, it just wants to be a funny way to tell you these dishes aren't really eaten in Italy.
P.P.S.: sorry for my english, forgive me for my (probably multiple) mistakes.

Made this for dinner for company. Although I did not fry the meatballs I (I broiled them), I followed the recipe. Would not put Italian sausage in these as it made meal taste like Italian sausage balls....also Romano cheese is overpowering here.
