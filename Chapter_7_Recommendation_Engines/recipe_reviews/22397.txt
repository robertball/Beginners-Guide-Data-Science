This was great and easy to make!  I followed another person's advice and cut my cabbage into chunks instead of shredded (would do that again!).  I used 1 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 3, and thought 1 1/2 was perfect.  I also prefer sliced onions instead of chopped.  The apple cooked so much that it became mushy, so next time I will add it to the onions when I cook them.  My family thought it needed more sausage, so next time I think I'll add another lb.  The recipe sure did taste great, and was perfectly complimented by mashed potatoes and rye bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Better give this 5 stars, because my husband informed me that he wants to have this for breakfast, lunch and dinner from now on.  I took the great advice of others and made just a couple of minor adjustments.  I had a fairly large head of cabbage, so I doubled the recipe.  But I, too, reduced salt.  I added about 1 tsp. of caraway seed (really "makes" it)!  Also, I used a large green apple, unpeeled and diced.  I would use more apple next time.  I added the apple when I put the cooked onions into the pot of cabbage. I used homemade broth instead of water, which added more flavor, and since I doubled it, there was lots of good juice to pour over our baked potatoes.  Oh, and I used more vinegar.  Delish!

This is now my favorite recipe.  I use whatever cabbage I have on hand and it is always good.  I did end up cutting the salt in half, and I love salt!  We eat it with potatoes on the side, covered in the extra juice.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

FAB-U-LOUS!!!  We used fresh polish sausage instead.  I cooked it most of the way along with the onions and then added it all to the cabbage to finish cooking.  I think the salt amount depends on your sausage.  We ate it over mashed potatoes and it was GREAT!  My German hubby loved it, too!

I used normal cabbage instead of red one as I had it on hand. I omitted onion as I did not have it. It still tastes good and my German husband LOVES this! Next time, I would reduce salt and add some more apple. Thanks for the great recipe.

I am VERY surprised by how much I liked this recipe.  We only chose to make it because our CSA gave us red cabbage and we had to pick a recipe to make (not being big cabbage fans).  Anyway, my husband and I thought it was delicious (although I liked it more than he did).  Couple of adjustments based on what we had and one shopping mishap: linguica instead of kielbasa. Sauteed the linguica in butter, and then sauteed the onion in those pan drippings.  Replaced lemon with fresh lime juice.  Used balsamic wine vinegar + distilled vinegar in place of white wine vinegar (we were out).  Also, added more vinegar (added to taste), and reduced the amount of salt.

Mmmm made this with regular sausages as we don't have any smoked and added the apple at the end to try and save the texture of it as suggested by another reviewer. The sausage, once sliced, fried and added to the 'kettle' (pan with lid), tated devine. But sadly the apple didn't hold it shape as planned but then I don't think was a bad thing at all as it gave a sweetness to counteract the sour lemon throughout the dish. I also used cider vinegar as that what we had. Let's just say that when our veg box gave us another red cabbage this week, I've gone out and bought some sausage to make this again. Yum!

This is one my favorite recipes. I substitute spicy vegetarian sausage crumbles for the kielbasa and it always turns out great. I've even made it without any sausage at all because I love the tangy taste of the cabbage in this dish. Thanks!

I love this one!  I have made it several times now and it's great to bring to work for lunch too.  When I made it today I used Hebrew National Polish Sausage instead of Kielbasa and I also added 1/2 tsp. of carraway seed...it came out great again!  It's great with whole grain german style mustard on the side.

This was so good!! I was craving cabbage and this hit the spot. I did increase the lemon and wine vinegar by another 2 tsps each, just to give it a little more zing. Served with mashed potatoes, sweet peas and fresh bread. The kids had a difference of opinion on the red cabbage..,3 year old wouldn't even try it but she ate everything else. My 18 month old couldn't get enough of the cabbage. He kept saying "mmmmmm good!" 
Recommend you give this a try. It is a keeper.

We really liked this!  I made this all in one pan by cooking the onion in olive oil then adding the cabbage and other ingredients in step one.  I then added the unpeeled apple for the last 15 minutes.  I cut the salt in half as others suggested and used a few splashes of white wine vinegar.  Lite Kielbasa also helped cut calories.  We'll have this again!

This was sooooo good, and very pretty too.  We don't usually have red cabbage, but recieved some in our vegetable order this week.  This recipe sounded strange to me, but we had the ingredients, so I decided to give it a try.  My husband said it looked like something that he would never eat, but then couldn't stop eating it!  He then begged me to put some in his lunch tomorrow!  Very satisfying, I added extra wine vinegar for a little extra zing, and served it with rice since we are saving our potatoes for Thanksgiving.  Very good.  You need to try this!

Very tasty. Thank you for this recipe. I went a little crazy on the healthy food at the store the other day and found myself at home with a red cabbage I had no idea what to do with. Even the skeptical fiance is enjoying it. I took another reviewer's advice and sauteed the onions, apples, and sausage all together, then threw them in the with the cabbage to cook a little while longer. The apples came out tender, but not mushy.

Delicious! The only thing I have to suggest is that the best type of apple to use for this is a granny smith as it takes it much longer to turn to mush. Very easy recipe too!

I would give this 5 stars, but because my husband wasnt too fond of it, I had to take it down to 4.  I liked the fact that the cabbage wasnt your typical sweet, spiced red cabbage.  Cooking the sausage in the cabbage gave it a wonderful flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to sautee the onion in the dutch oven first and then just add the cabbage- really no need to dirty 2 pans.  I also chopped the cabbage an onion into larger bit size pieces rather than shredding and dicing.  Very tasty!  Served with pierogies and sour cream.

It was just ok.  Something different on a weeknight.  Mustard is a must to pull the flavors together.  I ended up mixing it with everything on my plate.  Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  If I decide to make this dish again, I think I would add some bacon to add to the flavor.

This was really good but I decreased the salt from 3 to 2 teaspoons and would further decrease it to 1 1/2 teaspoons when I make this again.  I also used a light smoked sausage to make the dish healthier.  The apples did get mushy so I would add them further along in the cooking process next time.

Way too sweet with the apples.  Next time I would add some green cabbage and maybe double the sausage....will be trying again with those changes.

Delicious!!! Maybe the best cabbage I've ever had. I added some red potatoes and I'm glad I did!  This was the first time I've ever had cooked red cabbage.  I will have it often, now.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I took it to a church dinner because my family doesn't like this kind of dish and there was none left. I liked the combination of flavors, and will try it again with regular green cabbage. I did reduce the salt to 2 tsp. and used rice vinegar. I added the apples to the onions when sauteing and they turned out perfect. I used some ring sausage that a friend gave us and have no idea what kind it was. It was pretty spicy and was the perfect complement to the cabbage. Thanks for the recipe. I'm always looking for new recipes with healthy ingredients!

Better than I expected!  I followed the advice of others and cut the salt down to 1 tsp which was perfect- any more and it would have been way too salty.  I used 1 TB olive oil in place of the butter and I used turkey kielbasa to cut calories.  I softened the onion in the oil in a large pot 1st then added the remaining ingredients, except for the apple which I added the last 10 minutes.  I also added a little caraway seed.  The whole family loved this!  It is very diet friendly if you use turkey sausage and olive oil.  Husband would have liked double the sausage but I thought it was just right.

Disappointing indeed! A lotta work for a mediocre meal. Hear is a better idea. Toss a can of sauerkraut in a pan, toss in a polish sausage (cut and browned) and heat through. Serve with mustard on the side. Fast, easy and tasty!

WONDERFUL! I used lime juice instead of lemon and apple cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar, only because it's what I had. I'm sure it would have been just as wonderful with the original ingredients. Thank you for a great recipe!

We used regular green cabbage and left out the lemon juice and apple.  First fried the sausage and onion, then added the cabbage; no need to add butter.  Satueed for a few minutes, then added the vinegar, water and pepper.  No need for salt; sausage has plenty.  Very tasty.  Ate with mashed potatos.

My husband would rate it a 3, but I'm giving this a 5.  My 4 year old and I loved it! My only change was to save cleaning a saute pan, so I cooked the onion in butter until golden, first, and then threw in the cabbage and other ingredients.  Use lean, turkey sausage, and this is one easy, healthy dish!

Great story...my husband was doing anexperiment with red cabbage for a Chemistry class, and so we had almost a whole head of cabbage left and I hate to throw out food...so I turned to allrecipes.com as I do with all my leftover needs. This was a fast and easy recipe. I thin sliced the cabbage instead of shredding it. Sweeter than I expected, but very nice and easy. Also freezes well :)

Took this as a side dish to a birthday party that offered up italian beef as the main dish. The Cabbage dish was gone and very little of the beef was consumed. I felt bad for the host but think that I learned how to make an awsome dish!!

This was good, but not really good.
I used Bratwurst beer sausage a 1/2 cup of suarkruat and a couple of potatoes chopped up. I think some caraway would have been good

Deeeelicious!!!!!  Didn't change a thing - just added a little more black pepper since I like spicy.  Followed another reviewer' suggestion and served it over mashed potatoes (made garlic mashed potatoes).  Great combination - the leftovers are great too.  If there are any!!!!  Thanks Karen.

I'm obsessed with this red cabbage. I sautée the onion in the pan before adding the cabbage since it seems a waste of a pan when it doesn't really change the flavor. I only used 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I didn't worry about the apple getting tender since I was interested in the flavor of it and not the texture, but it blends beautifully with the texture of the cabbage. I finely chopped and didn't shred the cabbage.  The texture is nicer plus its simply easier. I don't cook the sausage in the cabbage, but I cook them in a separate pan with a bit of beer. Then I serve it all over mashed potatoes. It makes for an amazing bangers and mash with red cabbage.

Husband says he could eat this every night (so I send him frequently to our supermarket for red cabbage!). I make with mild pork sausage from butcher counter , add caraway seeds and a chopped apple. That is how my mother made this and she learned it from her mother who was raised by Amish farmers after being chosen off an Orphan train.  this is really close to old recipe. Thank you for posting.

I loved this! I made it with only one small change and used Sweet Italian turkey sausage because that was what I had in. Freaking fantastic and I don't even like cabbage that much!  I just took a chance because it is very low carb (low carb diet here) and red cabbage is a "super food". So not only is this delicious, it is  a very healthy recipe too.

We are not cabbage eaters, but the CSA gives us cabbage!  Both my husband and I loved this recipe.  I didn't use butter, just some cooking spray.  I also used skinless turkey sausage because that is what I buy.  I added extra lemon juice and vinegar and a generic all purpose non-salt seasoning.  Added the apples with the onions and sausage hoping to keep them a little more crisp, next time I will wait until just before serving to basically heat the apples.  I will definitely be making this dish again!

This was so good!  I only used about 1/2-1 tsp of salt, I used turkey sausage and olive oil instead of butter.  I sliced my sausage into 1/2" slices.  Make sure and use a firm, cooking apple...preferably on the tart side.  I will definitely make this again!

It does not necessarily look all that appetizing because of the purple look of the cabbage.  My hungry crew quickly overcame that when they tasted how yummy it was.  Extremely easy and loved by all.  I will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!!!!

We had leftover red cabbage from fish tacos so I came here looking for something to do with it. Based on other reviews, I decreased the salt significantly, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. I used a crisp Granny Smith apple which added just the right amount of tart/ tangy flavor to the dish. My 4 and 7-year-old daughters thought it was "ok", but my husband and I liked it. Served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus and of course, Sriracha hot sauce on the side. We eat many meals with Sriracha ;-) Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very tasty recipe. To make it a little healthier,  I used lean smoked turkey sausage, only about 2 tsp of salt, doubled the cabbage and onion and added about 2 cups raw spinach (great color and didn't really change the flavor).  The flavors all come together really well and the apple doesn't make it too sweet.  Delish!

This is a very good recipe.  I did add caraway seed, and I used apple cider vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.    My husband and I both enjoyed the meal.  I did as many other reviewers cut back on the salt.

Made this with Calvados since I didn't have an apple.  Didn't use the butter and dumped a lot less sausage and onion in for the last 15 minutes..  I thought it was going to be awful but was pleasantly surprised. Great way to get color in your diet and on the plate.

I often find myself searching for recipes with the ingredients I have on hand...I had green cabbage, red onion and bratwurst.  Those were the substitutions I made.  Otherwise I followed this recipe precisely and it was absolutely FANTASTIC!  I served it over mashed potatoes.  I'm going to go pick up some purple cabbage and try this recipe as it states.  Oh & I was a bit hesitant about adding the 3rd tsp of salt but glad I did.  Thank you grandma of Karen for this dish!

I followed the directions explicitly, and wouldn't change a thing.

This was a great dish.  I used fresh sausage patties instead of the kielbasa, and it still turned out well.  Make sure that you use a firm type of apple or it will get lost in the steamed cabbage.

I love red cabbage but have to say this underwhelmed me. The kielbasa tasted nice but the cabbage is undercooked and without much flavor. I did cook it longer than it stated but it was just ok.

I cook the cabbage alone and add black or redcurrant jam and caraway seed and simmer it on the stove for several hours before adding the kielbasa and onion separately. Served over egg noodles or spaetzle!

Made with these variations: hot Italian sausage, rice vinegar, and about1T Dijon mustard. At first I thought the mustard might overpower other flavors but let it sit an hour and everything blended nicely.

We love this and it is regular on our menu. The only change I make is to cook the onions with the kielbasa. The mashed potatoes make it just right.

I first made this about 10 years ago. It's now a staple in this house. My husband asks for it regularly and will even make it himself (a minor miracle) when I'm sick and tell him what to do. 
My only changes are that I use bratwurst instead of kielbasa and I add a second apple. 
Thanks so much, Karen!

It's a very good and different way to use red cabbage...other than soup or salads. I mixed all the ingredients together in a large skillet, then served it over garlic mashed potatoes. I found it went a lot further that way. Hearty eaters in my house! Definitely will make it again!

Followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out really well! We made it to help use up half of a giant head of cabbage we had for another meal. Super easy and quick to pull together, definitely will make again.

This was very good and easy.  The second time we made it we finely shredded the cabbage and that was better.  Also, the second time, we served the sausage (sautéed) on the side.

I followed this recipe as written, except I doubled the sausage.  We received red cabbage in our CSA box this week and I found this recipe.  My husband loves it (I'm not a meat eater).  I would make this again--super easy to make.

Excellent! After reading a couple reviews that mentioned the apples getting too soft I added them about 5 minutes after I added the onion and sausage. They were perfect. Served with mashes potatoes this revipe is both filling and delicious.

Used weiners, 1 tsp lemon juice, 2 1/2 c cabbage, no wine vinegar, 1 tsp salt and the apple.
Could have been a little more sour...maybe add the wine vinegar.

Pretty good.  Had only made 1/2 batch (2 1/2 c cabbage) and only used 1 tsp lemon juice.  Robert thought could be a little more.  Might not have needed as much pepper as I used.  Used only 1 tsp salt, no wine vinegar and browned 3 weiners....enough meat.
Next time add perhaps 1 tsp wine vinegar

This was amazing! I used chicken stock instead of water altogether. After a taste test, I used a lil more vinegar & lemon juice. I splashed that on as  cabbage continued to cook last 5 min.  Sprinkled just a lil cinnamon on the apples & dumped them in near the end (thanks so much for the tip everyone! ). I placed cabbage & sausage over quick/instant garlic mashed potatoes, ate with a lil indiv apple sauce (love apples!)...I had thirds of this dish...THANK YOU! :)

Personally, I do not like cabbage. My husband is german and his mom always made it for him. Well this was actually really good. I did make a a few changes, for the meat I used raw Italian sausage. I sautéed it for a few minutes then I cooked it in the oven till no longer pink. Then cut it up and sautéed it again. I cooked the cabbage and the rest of the ingredients for the time specified, but the cabbage was still hard. My husband likes the cabbage to be soft, so I cooked the cabbage for a total of 2 hours till it was soft and I kept adding apple juice when it was low on liquid. I also added an extra apple 30 minutes before it was done. This recipe is definetly worth a try!

I bought a jar of pickles and was trying to think of a way to use my leftover pickle juice. Found this recipe and used the leftover pickle juice instead of the 1/2 cup of water, and it made the cabbage taste delicious! Also had to substitute a tiny bit of apply cider vinegar as I did not have apples on hand. Definitely a good try if you need to use up some leftover pickle juice!

I have made this twice and it's delicious and serves many. I prefer to use twice the sausage, twice the apple and 50% more vinegar (half apple and half red wine), everyone loves it.

i did half the salt and used apple cider vinegar and since I am low-carbing I only used half the apple and turkey kielbasa.  I would definitely make this again.

Quick and simple recipe, full of flavor (even with the uninspiring sausage I had). I used apple cider vinegar out of necessity, but it did quite nicely. Definitely adding this one to my recipe box.

We have made this recipe several times.  I get red cabbage a lot with my CSA and was at a loss of what to do with it besides coleslaw.  The kids (2 and 4) like it and it has even grown on my husband who grew up eating super spicy indian food.  Its a winner for me.  Not 5 stars because I dont go out looking for it but its a great meal when cooking with what you've got.

Great recipe, received at small red cabbage from our CSA and found this recipe.  Was perfect for dinner tonight.  I tried to go healthy and used the Jennie-O turkey kielbasa, should have gone for the real thing would have been even better.  Served with mashed potatoes as other reviewers mentioned and it was great!

Very easy and delicious dish!  The only changes I made were salting to taste since some people said it was too salty.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar.  It was simple to make and tasted wonderful.  I made it alongside spaetzle and the cabbage combined with the spaetzle was really delicious!

Just made this dish last night, followed all instructions, EXCEPT used half the salt, and added a little more pepper. It was fantastic! It really delivers a lot for such a small commitment of time and money.  Ate it with country style potatoes and bread.  Mustard makes it a ++!

So good! This was an incredibly easy meal to put together on a busy weekday night...to make it healthier I did use turkey kielbasa (delicious) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I think it tasted even better - more sweet, less vinegary - the next day when we fought over the leftovers! And don't skip the dijon mustard and pickle! Great cold weather food:)

I made this with a Pink Lady apple which I thought would be sweet enough, but I ended up adding a packet of Splenda to the mix. If I were to make this again I would probably add a splash of apple juice instead of lemon. I'm not a huge fan of caraway seeds but a wee pinch would add some extra flavor. Thanks!

I thought this was very yummy, but I just love sausage and cabbage.  My very picky husband even loved this.  We froze a bit of it for later and it thawed very well and tasted even better!

Good, a little more flavor would be good.  I followed other advice and added some caraway, and used turkey sausage.  Not good as leftovers however.

This was a wonderful treat!  I was a bit afraid at first and wondered what my fussy husband would say - he loved it and wants me to make again soon!  Only lessened the amount of salt due to our tastes, otherwise great as written!

What a great recipe; even my two year old loved the cabbage!  It was so easy to make. I would have added caraway to the recipe had I had some on hand, maybe next time.  I served it with pumpernickel bread and smashed red potatoes and called it my "German Fare Night", the kids loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really enjoyed this dish as did the kids.  (The kids did pick out the cabbage but enjoyed the taste of the sausage from the cabbage.)  Made exactly as written but I did use 2 pounds of sausage so I could have leftovers.  Glad I did because there was a lot of cabbage leftover.  Made with Home Fried Potatoes from this site.  Thanks

This was just okay.  I thought it would be improved by a rough chop of the cabbage instead of the shred.  I think it could also use more seasoning, as it seemed rather bland to me.

This was very good. I used turkey andoulle sausage and it was spicy that way (I have no idea if that would be authentic or not, but it was good!). I added about half a teaspoon of caraway. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and beets. My husband (all american) really liked it, too!

This was pretty good.  I am not a fan of kraut, but my husband is.  He liked it.  My daughter and I think it's okay.  My 3-year-old didn't like it at all...but he doesn't like anything!  He's picky!  Thanks!

Very good - if you like slavick food, then you'll love this!  I used lowfat keilbasa and I think it would have been too fatty with regular.  I also served it with mashed potatoes and it was the perfect combination.

Found this recipe too much trouble for what you got.  Sausage and cabbage cooked together without the remaining ingredients tastes almost exactly the same.  I was surprised how much the flavor of the apple disappears when combined with the other flavors.  Meal was good -- but not enough to make again.

I've never had saurkraut before & didn't really know what to expect, but it turned out well. The sausage flavor blends in with the rest of the dish, which is really nice. We also had it with mashed potatoes, which was perfect. Definitely a good one for the saurkraut lover(s) in the family.

Very yummy way to use leftover cabbage.  It also tastes good to use light butter and reduced fat turkey kielbasa if you want to save yourself a lot of fat.

This was probably the best recipe I've tried from this site and I've tried a lot of them. The only thing I changed was I added a little more water in the 1st 15 minutes because it looked like the 1/2 cup had steamed away and, I used bratwurst instead of keilbasa. 
Thanks Karen!

This is such wonderful feel good food. My 18 month old cried after he cleared the bowl. My 5 year old picked out the cabbage but liked the rest and my husband went back for thirds. I think this is a great meal because it is so simple, flavourful and would go great with alot of sides. I made a plain white  rice with mushrooms which went very well. I will make this again for sure. This is also a meal you can make ahead, and put in a casserole for later. Great for when you just want to come home and pop it in the oven.

A very nice fall recipe. I served it with mashed butternut squash which as one might imagine gave the plate beautiful color. I have made it twice and had to double the kielbasa . Thank you for a simply good fall treat.

Really delicious! I had been looking for a recipe to approximate some "rotlkohl" that I had at a German restaurant that was flavored with apples. This tasted even better.

Although I tried it with the green cabbage, this was a GREAT recipe, quick and easy and everyone loved it.
