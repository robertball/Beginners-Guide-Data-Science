This is a good basic muffin mix but it is too dry and definitely not lemony enough.  I suggest adding 1 Tbs of fresh lemon juice to the batter and then glazing the muffins with a mixture of lemon juice and powdered sugar while they are hot.  Poking the tops of the muffins with a fork first will allow the glaze to soak in better.

this recipe is tasty and easy a few suggestions though I grated all of the zest off of a whole lemon and added the juice from the lemon aswell I also added more milk I found the batter to thick, once I had the batter in the muffin trays  sprinkled zest on the tops this made these muffins sweet and wonderfully lemony. My husband says they are to die for lol I have to say I agree.

Great recipe.  I added more lemon zest and 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  Baked them only 15 minutes instead of 20.  They came out moist and delicious!!

I took the recommendations from the other reviews. I added another 1/4 cup of milk, 2 tbs of lemon juice, and also sprinkled lemon zest over the tops before putting them in the oven. I baked my muffins for 17 minutes, and they came out great.

--I made this recipe a second time and this time I used the juice from a whole lemon, about 2 tbsp more sugar, and instead of sprinkling the top with lemon zest I sprinkled it with a thin layer of sugar before baking. The sugar on top gave it a more crisp and slightly sweet top and the extra lemon gave it a fuller lemon flavor. I thought the second batch was twice as good as the first and this is how I will make them from now on!

I am 7 years old and my family and I really liked this recipe.
We added 1 tsp vanilla extract, lemon juice and lemon zest from a lemon. I would recommend this to anyone who loves baking, but advise them to make the same changes, it makes a difference.

Based on suggestions of the other reviewers, I modified this recipe a bit.  I added the zest of 2 lemons to the batter as well as the juice of one of the lemons.  I also substituted the oil for unsweetened applesauce and replaced the white sugar with an equal amount of Splenda.  Lastly, I added about 1 cup of blueberries to the batter just before baking.  The flavour of the muffins wasn't bad, and certainly not overly lemony...but the end result was a very chewy muffin that stuck to the paper liner.  Not a bad start - but this recipe still requires more tweaking in my opinion.

My first reaction to these muffins- Bisquick!  They resemble Bisquick bicuits in taste and texture.  The lemon flavor is very faint.  I followed other reviewers advice and made a lemon glaze that I added as soon as they came out of the oven.  The glaze helped immensely.  I think next time I make these muffins I will add another Tbsp lemon zest and cut back on the baking powder.

This is a very easy recipe to follow and turns out nicely with a cake-like texture. The entire family likes them and I can't keep them in the pantry. If you like a little more lemon flavor, just put on a glaze of lemon juice and sugar and put in some more lemon zest.

This was a great recipe! We added 1/2-3/4 tbsp. more lemon zest to add an extra zip. We also a few drops of lemon juice to each after they were done and dusted with icing sugar. We made 21 mini muffins, rather than 12 large muffins. Great EASY recipe! Trust us, we're 13!

I added 1.5 tbsp fresh lemon zest & 1/2 tsp lemon extract & still thought they were more like faintly lemon biscuits. The family was happy though. Next time I am cutting the baking powder to 2.5 tsp & increasing the amount of lemon flavor.

This recipe was awesome. However, I did have to tweak it so I can't give it five stars. I did what other reviewers did and upped the lemon zest. I had small lemons so I ended up using five lemons plus the juice of three in my batter. I also added 1 cup of sugar and some extra salt. It came out smooth and not lumpy. I also put zest on top of the batter before I put it into the oven. Then did a lemon glaze over that when they came out.  Everyone loved them!!! They were so moist. The glaze added a nice kick when you bit into it. I would recommend tasting the batter as you go to get the lemon-y consistency you want. Otherwise. great recipe to start off at.

Instead of 3/4 cup of milk, I added 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I also baked the muffins for 18 minutes at 390 degrees.
It was moist and fluffy, but I felt like it needed a little more lemon juice and zest. Next time, I'm adding lemon extract. Yummy!

These were just (barely) OK. I usually like when muffins are dry, but these were just too dry. Even though I added more lemon, I didn't think they tasted much. I won't do these again, but maybe a simple change in the recipe will do it?

I took others' advice and added lemon juice from a whole lemon, and 1 tsp vanilla essence. I tossed in a cup of frozen blueberries too. Beautifully fluffy and yummy - even with replacing the egg with 1 tbs ground flaxseed + 3 tbs water.

Thank you for the recipe. As others have I as well tweaked a few things in this recipe to make it to my liking. Instead of 1/3 cup vegetable oil I used 1/2 cup. I also used the juice of one lemon and used the zest of the whole lemon. To add moisture and a bit of a flavor twist I also added 4 oz of softened cream cheese to the mix. They turned out moist and delicious. Perfect for my Sunday morning. Also, my 16 month old loved them too!

easy basic muffin recipe, but...not alot of lemon taste, and I added extra lemon zest and lemon juice to the mixture and lemon glaze when they were hot out of the oven. Next time I will definatey add more of the lemon zest and the juice. Other than that, they were sooo easy to make.

These were good, but I would suggest substituting 1/4 C of lemon juice for 1/4 C of the milk and much more lemon zest.

This recipe only makes about 8 full muffins. I have used peels of 2 lemons and juice of one lemon. It turned out great!! I will make it agian soon and will certainly make more! Maybe doubling the ingredients! It's a very simple recipe! Encourage all the first timers to try this!

Loved the rustic look of these muffins but I'm sure my customers would prefer prettier muffins. Either way, they're easy to make and very flavorful. I did make a lemon juice/sugar glaze and poured a teaspoon on each muffin.

This recipe is ok.  It has a more biscuity texture than I was expecting.  I added 1/3 cup chopped candied ginger, tablespoons lemon juice and half a package of powder lemonade. I like a good lemon flavor. I also sprinkled some sugar in the raw on the top for appearance.  It's best served fresh out of the oven. The recipe is simple and easy to adjust.

The recipe was very good. My family and my friends loved but I just add more lemon zest (double) and 1 cup of lemon juice.
I made it twice and for sure I will make it again.

They came out moist and fluffy but very limited in the lemon flavor. I think adding a touch of lemon juice will enhance the flavor.

I like these muffins and make them often. They are moist and a little pound cake-like - just what I was looking for. They also freeze well.  I add some lemon extract and use the zest of a whole lemon when making them.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

After reading most of the reviews I made the following changes to address the texture and dryness issues.  I scaled the flour back to 1 1/2 cup and added another egg.  I also added 1/2 tsp lemon extract to bump the flavor and sprinkled the tops with turbando sugar before baking @ 375F for 23 minutes.  By cutting the flour back the yield was 9 nice size muffins.

I was out of milk when I made these muffins, so I used water.  I also added a I/2 teaspoon of lemon extract.  Baked them for exactly 25 minutes.  The result was a delicious, light, cake like muffin!

They were good but definitely too dry. I freaked out a little from the texture of the batter, it was lumpier than I thought it would be. I agree that it would be good to have some lemon flavor so you should add some lemon juice. Otherwise they are very sweet and bland and good for tea.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, lightly packed, instead of white, increased baking powder to 4 tsp., and milk to one cup.  Also, I added one cup of blueberries.   Baked for 15 minutes at 400 F.   My family loved these muffins.

Muffins were not very sweet and barely tasted of lemons - even with additional juice from one lemon added in.  They were also of a strange consistency. I will definitely look elsewhere for lemon muffins.

These were okay but they didn't really taste very lemony.  Next time I make these I will probably add more lemon zest.  They taste very good with jelly and butter.

This was good but I used a whole lemon for the zest and the juice of a lemon for more flavor.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 a cup to make them a little sweeter.  I also added 1 1/2 t. vanilla if you like vanilla flavoring.  I had to add about 1 T. of extra flour since I added more liquid to the recipe.

I had a feeling they wouldn't have enough lemon flavor so I added a  drop of lemon extract.  It still was not enough.  If you're looking for something subtle, this will suit you as is.  I used another reviewers suggestion of adding a lemon glaze and it helped a little.   Mine didn't turn out dry as others experienced, they were actually quite moist.  I'll continue my search though, sorry!

This is an easy recipe to follow, but I had to change it to get a lemon tasting muffin. When I did exactly what the recipe called for, the batter turned out more like a dough - very sticky and when they came out of the oven they were dark and tasted like plain. I added a 1/4 cup more milk, 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 tablespoons more sugar, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon less baking powder. I also went ahead and zested the whole lemon. I still think the lemon taste isn't strong enough, and my taste testers agree. When following the original recipe, you will see that the wet ingredients are not enough for the dry. My additions made the muffins moist and sweet. I just need to tweak the lemon flavor and they will be perfect.

These were alright - in my opinion the deifnently need a lot more lemon flavour. I tried them with the lemon glaze as other reviews suggested, this helped out and was very good. I did not like the texture of the muffins. Next time I will be adding more lemon juice and rind, and reducing the baking power as others suggested.

I was worried when the batter turned out to be more like a dough and I had trouble releasing it from my cookie scoop. I added some lemon juice and sprinkled with poppyseeds. They did turn out kind of bready. Not sure if I did something wrong here. I know I didn't overmix. I used a mini muffin tin to make them then when I found the texture wasn't muffiny I decided to cut off the tops, put some raspberry jam and put the tops back on. Then I made a glaze out of confectioners sugar, milk and vanilla and drizzled on. My co-workers loved them. Overall the flavour was nice but I didn't care for the texture.

For this recipe I only give 4 stars, with the additions I would give it 5 or more if I could. These were sooo good, Im planning on making more in the morning. I used the zest of a whole lemon and I used alittle more milk than what it called for probably about 1/8 cup more because I thought they were to thick. Also, I din't have an egg so I added 2tbsp sour cream to it (Im not sure if that can be used for an egg subsitute but it turned out good anyways) Then mine only took about 15 mins to cook (my oven must cook faster) anyways after they were done I used the juice from the lemon and mixed it with sugar and powder sugar and poured it on top on the muffins. Oh so good!!!

Instead of lemon I used lime and added the zest of 2 limes and the juice of one. The result was fine, but maybe a bit tastless. My mother says that more sugar would be required.. I used exactly that of the recipe.Anyway, it is easy to cook... and with same other readjustments... bon appetit!

Love this recipe.  Muffins turned out very fluffy and flavourful.  I've made them twice with 2 modifications: 1) added the zest of 1 lemon, and 2) topped with a lemon juice/sugar glaze.  delicious.  I think they would be really good with blueberries, will try that next time.

After some adjustments, I found this to be really good!  I added about 2 TBSP of freshly squeezed lemon juice and a bit of vanilla. Made them in mini muffin tins and baked for about 10 minutes and then frosted with a lemon juice/powdered sugar frosting. A hit all around!

This recipe was okay. The muffins were not very moist and there were not very lemoney flavoured as well .. I think I will keep looking for a better recipe, I just wish I had read the comments of others before trying this out...

Great tasting recipe, I did find it a bit dry so added a few tablespoons of cranberry juice - you could add milk or water also.  I also added some cranberries - very good mix!

Very good and simple. I doubled the lemon zest and used lemon glaze ( icing sugar + lemon juice ) and made it into mini muffins. Every thing else was the same.

This recipe has great lemon flavour and was an instant favorite in my house. However, because of the high heat, it can go from done to burnt extremely quickly.

As others have said I think they should cook at 375 rather than 400 for the 20 min. Maybe that would help with the dryness. I'm going to try some lemon and/or vanilla next time to enhance the flavor a bit too.

I got the same muffins which were really dry and as a result the finished muffins were hideously lumpy looking. I would try again and make a little adjustment, lower the temp. from 400 to 375, shorter baking time, add more milk and a tsp of pure lemon extract. Hopefully it would work better.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I took the advice from others and added more lemon zest along with lemon juice. I even added sour cream to the batter hoping to make them more moist, however, I still felt that they were dry. If it wasn't for "BakinginErie, PA"'s advice to poke holes in the muffins and glaze, they would have been pretty tastless. Sorry!

this doesn't taste like lemon at all. I added a whole lemons worth of zest and juice plus extra milk (because the batter was too thick) and it barely tasted like anything. Do not recommend.

Have made a few times, tastes like there is too much baking powder so may need to adjust in the future but is a good base to start with (also highly recommend adding blueberries).

Muffins were meh, the lemon flavor is there but it’s very very suttle and I added both lemon juice and lemon zest. Would be perfect in mini muffins for a toddler tho

I have made this a couple of times now.
Good starting point.
Recipe needs more lemon.  I added juice of one lemon.  Added  all the zest .  Had to leave in oven for extra ten to brown top.
The muffin top needs a sweetness I added powdered sugar this time.

I added the zest of two whole lemons and some diced cranberries. Yes, the batter is dryer than a cake batter and sticky, but work with it becuase it is worth it. The texture is light and fluffy and the flavor is very clean. A great treat to bring to a function.

The muffins look and taste great, but I had to modify the recipe because they were too dry without additions. I added  1 egg, 3 T. Lemon juice, and 1/4 c. Plain yogurt and 2 tsp lemon zest to the top of the muffins before baking. I like how light these muffins are.

I love this recipe,  it uses a few ingredients. I did however grate a while lemon and added its juice to the batter for a more lemony flavour and used 1/2 cup more milk. Muffins came out crunchy on top and moist on the inside. My kids loved them

This is one of the best muffin recipe I've made so far (due to the fact that I'm only 14)!! I love this recipe! I've always been a fan of lemon desserts and anything that has lemon on it (it sounds kind of weird ik). Anyways, this recipe was so moist I loved it so much, thank you for sharing!! After I zested one lemon though, I squeezed the lemon juice into the mix, just to add a little more lemon flavor. The batter was also too thick, so instead of 3/4 cup of milk, I changed it to 1 whole cup of milk. Which made the batter  perfect and they turned out amazing. Thank you again for sharing this recipe and I will never forget to make this recipe again in the future. I recommend this recipe to anyone who loves lemoney desserts!

I noted that people had found it dry, so I added an egg yolk to it, and made orange-spice muffins by using a teaspoon of orange peel, a teaspoon of Penzey's Baking Spice blend, and a teaspoon of orange extract in the milk. I find with citrus that peel in the flour and extract in the milk gives you the big flavor you want.

I followed a lot of the tips from previous reviews, I added about 1/4 cup more milk, and I didn't have lemons so I used oranges and it came out great! I also didn't have vegetable oil so I used corn oil and it worked just fine. I put in zest from a whole orange, as well as the juice, though I think I will try the tip of sprinkling sugar on top before i bake them next time.  My family loved them! Really easy and fun recipe.

There muffins were delicious, I followed the recipe as stated adding only some fresh figs from my tree. The combination of lemon and figs were great. Will make them again.

As is I rate it a 2 as they are not strong on the lemon flavor. As the first tray was cooking I read some other reviews and decided to modify my remaining batter. I added more lemon juice as I was out of  zest and also added blueberries. Some of my muffins I topped with a lemon glaze and others I told with sugar before baking but no glaze afterwards. With my modifications, based on others suggestions,  its a good recipe!

I did a test bake today since I need to make them for church this weekend. The muffin was dry and not very lemony (but WOW did the house smell good!).

I will add extra zest, lemon juice, and additional milk. I'll also glaze them.

I put in the zest of a large lemon and squeezed the juice as well.  also I used coconut milk instead of regular.  I doubled the batter then split and added cranberries to one and blueberries to the other..

This recipe just did not work for me. 
It came out bone dry and lacking flavor even after putting the juice of an entire lemon into the mixture.
 Won't make again.

This was a quick and easy recipe for a morning breakfast. I only had buttermilk so I used that instead and added some baking soda. I added cranberries and used the zest of a whole lemon. I also added the juice of two lemons based on the other reviews.  My husband and the kids loved them. I will definitely try these again.

The muffins have a lovely texture and a crunchy top, but they could use a bit more flavour. I'd suggest doubling the lemon zest and adding a  tbsp or two of lemon juice.

Overall, this is a great recipe. I only had to make a few adjustments. After reading some of the other reviewers' comments, I decided to add a tiny bit more lemon zest. I also made sure to add some freshly squeezed lemon juice. They only had to bake for about 16 minutes, and they were just the right texture and flavor. A great way to make your muffins even more delectable is to add some powdered sugar on the tops when they are fresh out of the oven. Awesome recipe! :))

I made some changes:
1 Cup sugar, 1 tsp lemon extract (in addition to the zest), additional 1/3 C milk.  These muffins were moist but no Iemon flavor, and not sweet.  Next time I'll add 2 tsp Lemon Extract, and 2 Cups sugar.   Sprinkle with powdered sugar or make a simple lemon glaze.   I'll update my rating after making these a second time but for now I give it 3 stars.

These muffins were ok, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  We tried adding more lemon to the muffin mix but it didn't really help that much.  I think I will just look for a different recipe rather than try to make enough changes  to this one so that we like it.

I also added an extra 1/4 cup of milk and the juice of one lemon.  Also sprinkled sugar on top which made it crunchy on top!  I'm a lemon lover and these were great, and next time I'm making them with juice of TWO lemons!  My husband and son loved them.

The muffins were tasty, We added some lemon juice for a stronger lemon flavor, but the muffins still weren't lemony enough. We baked the muffins for 15 minutes at 205 degrees C- and they were very moist.
Good recipe. We enjoyed making them and will enjoy eating them.

I read some of the reviews and used 1 cup milk and used 2 Tbsp lemon zest. Additional milk made the muffins moist. The additional lemon zest was not enough. The family could not tell these were lemon muffins. Next time will also use lemon extract.

I added a bit of extra sugar, more milk and oil as I found the batter too dry. I used the zest of one whole lemon in the batter as well as all the juice from the lemon. Before baking I sprinkled some zest on top of each muffin. And I added a handful of frozen blueberries. They turned out moist and so delicious! I will definitely make them all the time!

This recipe was way too dry and floury. The batter by the original recipe looked way too thick, so I put one muffin into the oven and tried adding up to another 1/2 cup of milk to the rest of it to get to the consistency I'm usually familiar with. The added milk was a vast improvement on the final product, but it still tasted too floury. Recipe needs more fat in it.

definitely too much baking powder :(  Mine was like dry, baking powder flavoured, and not lemony enough. will probably add more lemon zest and lemon juice, and reduce the baking powder to maybe 1.5 tsp. I add 1/2 cup more milk in as well.

I made a few changes and they were the best muffins I've ever had!
Instead on vegetable oil substitute 1/3 cup melted butter PLUS 1/4 cup coconut oil
Added a teaspoon of vanilla extracts as well.
Zest end 2 full lemons and added juice from 3 lemons. They were so flavourful but not too tart. I also added a cup of fresh blueberries and then made a sugar crumble (butter and coconut sugar or brown sugar) for the top. Then finished it with a lemon glaze. They were phenomenal!

This one was better than most of the reviews read, I did add a little more lemon zest than usual, and I made a simple glaze using powdered sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest. They looked and tasted beautiful, thanks for the recipe.

I took my time, carefully measured, followed the recipe (no adjustments at all) and it still didn't come out right. I didn't taste the lemon at all or anything actually. It is just hard to explain, I couldn't even eat it as a snack cake or something.

The taste was pretty good; however, the muffins seemed dry and floury in texture.  I'll try it again but maybe with more milk in the batter.

It's more of a biscuit batter. I little more lemon and butter instead of oil will probably do better. It was ok not the best.

I added 1 cup of milk and zested 2 lemons. I also juiced both of the lemons right into the mixture, as it was very lump at first. Added 1 cuo of frozen blueberries for added flavor. I also saved a little of the zest and topped the muffins with it and a little sugar before baking. I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. They turned out perfectly and are so so delicious!

I should have read the reviews before I starts baking. Yes it was quick and easy but it came out too dry. The measurements given is for mini muffins but I used proper muffin cases so ended up with 6 muffins.I will try the recipe again but with juice, vanilla extract,etc.

I am not a novice at all so was pleased to find a simple lemon muffin recipe. These muffins had the texture of playdough.

Yummy! After reading other reviews I decided to add more lemon (the zest of 2 lemons and the juice of one) . It was perfect and they were a big hit!

I like the muffins but something is definitely missing. I added more zest, juice, and lemon extract for flavor and I still could have added more I think. I used a little more milk than called for too,  almost a full cup instead of 3/4. I didn't have any fresh fruit but berrys would be a great side for these.

That is by far THE driest muffin I have ever eaten - or tried to eat.
I cooked them for 20 min. - the minimum recommended.
I have lots of MUCH better recipes for muffins.  But I wanted a lemon muffin.

I followed the recipe, but also added the juice from the lemon I had zested, and a bit more milk (til I thought the consistency was right).  I've decided they are more like "Lemon Scones" (rather than the typical muffin texture), which is also fine, but next time perhaps I will make them more like drop biscuits and add a bit more lemon zest and juice.  They are perfect as Mini Scones!

This was pretty good. Wasn't too dry when i added extra milk, but it definitely could have used more.  I also thought there wasn't enough sugar. So instead of adding more, i just made a crumbly topping out of flour, butter, and sugar.  Overall it was ok.

I have made this several times with variations each time. I think I will keep playing with it. Good basic muffin recipe with the texture of cornbread. I made a few modifications- zest of 2 whole lemons, 1 tsp of lemon extract, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1 cup sour cream. Next time I will reduce my oven temp to 350.

these muffins were too dense and even when i followed the previous reviewer's comments and added the juice of one large lemon and a large lemon's zest, they still barely tasted of lemons. it was a real disappointment.

The only alteration I made was I used lemon juice instead of zest. I didn't have any fresh lemons. I added the juice after I added the liquids so I wouldn't curdle the milk. The next time I think I'll use buttermilk instead of regular white.

This was the very first muffin recipe I cooked according to, and I am certain, the best one yet! Don't really know if it changes anything, but I add some lemon juice and some water or more milk to the batter as I find it a bit too thick.

These are not really the texture of what I would deem a traditional muffin - almost more like a scone than a muffin.  My lemon peel was too dried out to zest, unfortunately, but the lemon was still very juicy on the inside.  So, I used the juice of the whole lemon and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract.  I found the batter to be too dry so I splashed in some more milk and also added Craisins and glazed the tops.  I will try them when I have a fresher lemon on hand, and maybe some blueberries.

It passes as a basic muffin but too dry.  I added extra oil, some lemon juice, and drizzled lemon juice with powder sugar on top but still not great.  Decided to kick it up several notches!  Poured some Limoncello on top with a spoon of whipping cream.  Delicious as a dessert!  Now I would give it 5 stars.

Make sure to eat these right out of the oven, otherwise they get Way too dry.  I tried adding more lemon to boost the flavor, but it didn't help much.

The muffins were bland, but if you take away a quarter of the milk and add more lemon juice it will taste better. I added a thin frosting and that added some flavor too. Over all i liked them but I've had better muffins.

Too biscuity and lumpy, the batter was so dry I had to add more milk just to mix thoroughly.  Bakes nicely, but they are more the consistency of biscuits than muffins.  Also agree with others, not enough lemon.

My kids loved these muffins. I added the zest of two small lemons. They were just the right hint of lemon. I glazed the top with powdered sugar and water, which gave them a sweet kick. This is a keeper  : )

Not horrible. Very plain tasting, even after I added half a lemon's juice and tons of grated lemon peel. I also added vanilla for extra flavor but it's still missing something. Maybe a lemon glaze next time ?

simple recipe, makes a great base for other flavors- I made it with cranberries and walnuts, and then strawberries- turned out great!

Great Muffin Recipe, moist etc..
I substituted the lemon peel for lemon juice but found it wasn't 'lemony' enough, overall a good recipe

They came out pretty good. I used the suggestions of making the powdered sugar/lemon glaze, which made them extra tasty. Instead of the lemon zest, I just used about three tablespoons of lemon juice because it was handy - the muffins came out just the right amount of lemon flavour. I think I'd use slightly less flour next time, though.

I'm a very inexperienced cook, since I'm just starting into my teens, and I made these (while my mom was at work and she couldn't help!) very easily. They definitely need some lemon juice, I turned the oven temperature down to 375, and I accidentally used about 1/3 cup less flour (I was only using a 1/4 and 1/3 measuring cups because I couldn't find the others). I also used the glaze suggested by some other reviewers, and it helped immensely.
Overall, not the best recipe, but very easy to make and good after some tweaking.

I love lemon, but not this recipe.  I took the advice of others and added some lemon juice, even glazed them and still they were just kinda ho hum.
