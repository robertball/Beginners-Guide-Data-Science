This was DELICIOUS!  For my own preference I sauteed up my broccoli, red pepper, zucchini and jalapeno before adding onto the sandwich.  It was so cheesy and just perfect :)

Instead of using all that butter in the pan simply butter the bread, Works well.

The perfect way to eat comfort food with a serving of veggies. The jalapenos are the perfect complement to this sandwich.
