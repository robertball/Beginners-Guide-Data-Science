This was delicious!  At first I thought it was a little sweet, but I added some fresh chopped basil and some smokey salt and it was delicious with just the right amount of sweet heat!  I used red curry paste and coconut milk in place of the heavy cream.  Definitely will make this again.

I was a little skeptical because I wasn't sure about maple and also the grocery store didn't have curry paste.  All the had were Marion's Kitchen curry kits which did have the paste inside.  Going by another reviewer I got the Thai red curry kind.  I ended up combining the instructions for the kit and the recipe, leaving out the heavy cream since the kit came with coconut milk.  I just made the sauce and mixed it with the ingredients from the recipe. It turned out very good! the dried chillies from the kit and the maple syrup balanced each other out very well. Just the right amount of sweetness and spicy.  Everyone loved it!

It was good, but too sweet. I hadn't added the syrup and put in some garlic salt and it was perfect. Then I added it and it was too sweet for my husband and I. Next time I will leave out the syrup.
