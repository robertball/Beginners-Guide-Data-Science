This is an awesome recipe that I can use for any occasion. Christmas was a good one, I used regular Oreos for the crust and made a picture of a Christmas Tree, leaving a majority of the cake white. Next I plan to use a birthday cake Oreo to make it for my husband's birthday! LOVE IT! Thank you so much for sharing.
