Absolutely WONDERFUL recipe. Has been in our family since mid-1950's (at least) only without the brown sugar added to the whipped cream topping. You can also take the pie mix and drop it by spoonfuls on a greased cookie sheet and make melt in your mouth cookies! The cooking time is much shorter (about 10 minutes). You can also put the pie mix in the tiny cupcake tins and make bite-sized cupcakes. This is a VERY versatile recipe!

I can't believe that this hasn't been rated yet. This is a great pie that I had wanted rate a while back. When I first read the ingredients I got real excited because it sounded just like the pie my best friend's Mom would buy at Piccadilly in about 1971. It is and it is so good!!! People love it!

This ssounds like the pie I used to make "way back when" It was delicious. I particually liked the addition of nuts. Talk about "comfort food".

I am so surprised to see this recipe here! It was my grandmother's famous "Mystery Pie" and I was coming online to submit it. The only difference I think is that hers called for 23 crackers. It is SOOO good... light and sweet and crunchy. We always top it with cool whip and shave a chocolate bar over the top of it for decoration.

My husband's aunt fixes this and it's very good. She puts sweetened strawberries on top then the whipped cream. It reminds me of a "torte." Thanks Saundra for reminding me to fix this again. Susie

This pie is sooo good! I ran across the recipe several years ago and everyone just loved it. I make this every holiday and there is never any left. You can't go wrong with this pie. It's also a nice change of pace from standard fruit pies.

I have searched for this recipe for years. Ironically my sister made it in her Home economic class in 1965 and brought the recipe home to my mother. Our mother made it for our family for some time to our family s delight. Somewhere along the way we lost our mother and the recipe. I have searched for years for that heavenly taste and the memories it would conjure up. I finally found it right here. I made it as surprise for my sister yesterday (Thanksgiving 2017). She was so delighted and elated to eat it. Thank you for publishing the recipe. Bless you!!! This is one incredible pie. You will not regret introducing it to your family.
