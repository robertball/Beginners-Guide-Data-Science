Oh my gosh, this is delicious! I have never had such a delicious apple crisp!  I will never search for another recipe! I fixed this for my large, picky family for Thanksgiving.  There were no leftovers!:-) Here's what I changed. I made 2 batches. In one, I added 1/4 cup of water rather than 1/2 cup. That was perfect. In the other batch I didn't add any water at all, and it was a little drier than I like.  So cut the water in half.  Also, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and I added some nutmeg to that mixture.  I think that's what made the apples soooo perfect. Lastly, I doubled the crust recipe and put a layer on top and on bottom.  Yum!!!  I used 6 large Granny Smith's.  I won't change a THING about this recipe next time I fix it, which if my family has anything to say about it, will be tomorrow!:-) 
11-13-06 I made this again for like the 5th time. It's still good, but I think next time I will try to cut the butter into the crust rather than melt it. My crust is never "crumbly" like I like on a crisp recipe.  Still a 5-star no doubt!!!

Excellent recipe and a hallmark of a superb chef, but as usual I had to futz with it. Leave out the water, add 1/4 teaspoon of Nutmeg to the apples, double the crust recipe, add 1 1/2 c. chopped pecans to the crust, and it comes out perfect. Remember to use baking apples (preferably granny smiths) for this, as red delicious will be more sweet and therefore need less sugar. Good vanilla ice cream provides all the moisture you would be missing from the water, and a food processor does wonders for taking the work out of slicing the apples. Now just to find a good butter rum sauce recipe :)

There's a reason why this recipe has nearly 300 reviews - it's THAT GOOD.  THIS is now my standard Apple Crisp recipe. I made mine in a 9 x 13 pan and doubled the topping as another reviewer suggested to cover. Perfect. I mixed my apples up with the flour/cinnamon mixture - this draws out the juices and eliminates the need for the extra water. I did not add the water to the apples.  My only mistake was I sliced my apples too thin and because they were too ripe some of it came out more like applesauce, but that was my own error.  Everyone loved it! I know you are considering other Apple Crisp recipes here but MAKE THIS ONE!

Excellent recipie.  It is important to follow the steps and not deviate from them (i.e. don't mix up All the ingredients at once and throw it over the apples as you may be able to get away with in other crisp recipes)
The recipie was great. the water factor wasn't a factor for me. it turned out to be a very nice thick juice that accented the dish nicely.
A word of caution when using this or any apple crisp recipie.  THE TYPE OF APPLES DO MATTER. I made this twice. Once with Red Delicious apples. these apples are not the greatest to use as they are often soft and bland. the recipe was great but the apples lacked.  I then used Granny Smith green sour apples.  This made All the difference! Do not be afraid to use sour apples. Keep in mind you are using two cups of sugar in this recipie and it will be quite sweet.  It simply comes down to the need for a hard and sour or at the very least sharp tasting apple to counter the sugar and even the flavor out. It will taste much better. Do not use soft or bland tasting apples, and do not overcook as the apples will turn mushy if you overcook.  If you fear overcooking then cut your apple thicker.  If you like the very thin slices of apple then you need to you a very hard, fresh, tart apple.  I do not suggest using Red Delicious apples. I also addeed a pinch of nutmeg.

Tasted wonderful.  I followed the directions exactly this time, but in the future I will make the following changes: cut the amount of water in half, double the topping and add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  You may need to increase the cooking time as mine was not done in 45 minutes.  Great recipe though!

I submitted this recipe several years ago, before I was a registerd member.  It was included in the first cookbook that All Recipes published, and I was so proud.  I like to come back every now and then to read some reviews.  I recommend Granny Smith apples; it won't be too sweet or watery.  Thanks to all you cooks for your ratings and reviews!

One important note: skip the water! I didn't use any at all and it was perfect.
I made a smaller version using a square 8x8 pan. I halved the sugar mixture for the apples but used the full measurements for the topping. If you are using the original 9x13 size, make sure you double the topping otherwise it wouldn't be enough.
This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted and so easy to make!!

This recipe is nearly the exact recipe I've been using for years, so I had to add my review to the pile.  It is my favorite way to get rid of an apple surplus (I ususally use about 7 good sized apples of mixed variety, minus what I snack on while I make it).  The only things I do differently are:
 
1) I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white for the apple mixture. 
2)I add fresh ground nutmeg, vanilla extract, and often raisins. 
3)I omit the h20 and 
4)I always add a heaping spoonful of gourmet butterscotch caramel ice cream topping to the apple mix-TRUST ME on this one!  

In the begining, I had a hard time with my crumble mix being 'crumbly' until I figured out to lightly press it down into the bowl, chill it for at least 30m and then break it up with a fork.  Letting the butter in the mix re-harden really makes a BIG difference in the final crumble factor.  Also, you must use real butter, margarine won't have the same effect for this recipe.  I'll often assemble this earlier in the day and leave it in the frige, then just before dinner, break up the crumble, top and bake while we eat.  I always serve with vanilla bean ice cream and have ALWAYS gotten rave reviews with this one.

First I made with(10)fresh peaches. Was WAY too sweet for our taste. Second time, I used semi- tart apples with only 1/4 of the white sugar. We still COULDN'T eat without a giant glass of milk, or the suggested ice cream. All I could taste was the "sweet";not much of the fresh fruit flavor or the wonderful cinnamon.The topping was about a 1/4 inch thick in a 9/13 dish. Also, way too sweet for us. I will omit all, but a sprinkling, of the white sugar, add HALF of the brown sugar, next time. If you like it 'BIG TIME' SWEET, this recipe AS IS, is for you! If you like the fresh fruit taste more, omit most of the white sugar and half the brown. Also, you can get away with half the butter if you "cut" it in evenly with a pastry cutter or a fork. It still comes out crispy and not too dry and is healthier.

Great Recipe! I did not add the water, since I never add water to fruit crisp recipes. I mixed Granny Smith apples with Jonathan apples and the result was a delicious dessert. For those bakers who said the recipe was too sweet, I am guessing that they used eating apples and not baking apples. Rather than sprinkle the sugar, cinnaman and flour on the apples, I mixed the ingredients together and then stirred in the apples.

By far the best apple crisp I have had (or made for that matter...). I only used 5 granny smith apples as I also prefer a higher "crust-to-apples" ratio and cut back the white sugar to 1/2 cup as others have suggested. This gave the crisp a perfect sweet/tart flavor, and for some reason there never seems to be any leftovers. This one is a definite keeper.

This is the best apple crisp ever. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and everyone about died because it was so good! Now whenever I have company it is demanded that this be made for dessert! After making the recipe a hundred times, I have altered it slightly and come-up with my perfect variation although the original submission is great as well! In the filling I skip the water but I do add 2 tsp. lemon juice, and 1 tsp. vanilla. The lemon juice adds that little extra oomph to it. Also, to the topping I added 1/4 c. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. The white sugar gives the topping a bit of a caramel flavor as sugar will do when warmed. It also makes the topping VERY crunchy which I think is my favorite part. It's hard to find such a crunch with a crisp. I searched for years for a good apple crisp recipe and I will never look again. This is a life long keeper! Thank you for this gem from me and all my family!

Wow... this was really really sweet. The topping is absolutely delicious, but I would cut the sugar, probably only half of the white. Mine was also a touch watery... I made it exactly by the directions. What went wrong?

Tried this tonight with Jonathan & Granny Smith apples. I hadn't read the reviews first, but thought that was a lot of water, so I used apple cider instead.  I found the amount of sugar OK but think I will try brown sugar in the apple mixture the next time.  I used apple pie spice instead of plain cinnamon.  Can't wait to try  the recipe with cranberries!

Prepared this exactly as written using Granny Smith and Fuji apples and for our tastes it was just right. No changes necessary.  Nicely sweet and cinnamony with a substantial and hearty oat topping.  Very good!

Holy MOLY!! This is what an apple crisp should be. Just enough crunch to contrast with the soft apples. I added freshly-ground nutmeg to the apples and upped the flour to 2 Tb, as many reviewers felt the dish to be too liquidy. I poured 6 Tb cranapple juice over the apples in place of the water, thinking the cranberry in it would provide some subtle counterpoint to the sweetness. I was right. (Updated to add: Tried it with orange juice to replace the water. Excellent!) Used a mix of early macs and Granny Smith. I spritzed the apple mix with some fresh lemon juice. Also added cinnamon and fresh nutmeg liberally to the crisp topping. Spectacular! I made it for my daughter to take to a friend's house tomorrow, and the aroma as it baked darned near drove me crazy! I filched a little from the edges while it was still warm just to taste it and smoothed it back over (shhh!) Thought I'd died and gone to heaven on a cloud!! On the advice of several reviewers, I cut back both white and brown sugars by 1/4 cup, and to my palate, the sweetness quotient was perfect, with just enough to point up the other ingredients. Topping lends a satisfying crunch. What a dynamite recipe this is!

This recipe is excellent the way it is written.  I've read other reviews and have noticed that some people have reduced the amount of white sugar and the amount of water. However, I believe that if you use the proper variety of apple and the proper quantity of apples, the measurements given in the recipe for both sugar and water are appropriate. My experience with this recipe was that 3 pounds of apples was the appropriate quantity. I also found that using a tart cooking apple, such as Northern Spy or Granny Smith, worked out well. I did not have a problem with a filling that was too runny or too sweet. Of course, these things are subject to taste, but the variety of apple used does have a significant impact on the amount of sugar required.  The variety of apple used also affects the amount of juice produced during baking, therefore impacting the amount of water required up front. For the amounts of sugar and water indicated in this recipe, I believe a tart cooking apple produces the desired results.

Awesome!  I used Granny Smith apples, half brown and half white sugar, 1/4 c. of water with a little lemon juice and 1 tbsp. of vanilla.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  I added some chopped walnuts and this went great with vanilla ice cream.

This is a good basic formula for apple crisp-- except for the water.  Apples provide enough natural juice.  If you have dry apples, just pour a very small amount (1/8 cup) of water over the apples before adding the topping.  Also, the topping needs salt and spice.  Add 1/4 teaspoon salt along with some cinnamon and ginger.  I put ginger in with the apples, too.  My crisp was killer.  The filling was not runny at all.  The topping was crumbly and buttery.  It was excellent.

OOHH MMYYY!!!  This is sooo heavenly..warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream on top..Doesn't get much better than this.
It's apple picking time so I used some fresh picked Empire apples.  I used two 8x8 inch glass dishes instead of a 13x9(one for me and one for a friend).  I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg(which I will leave out next time-ita a very overpowering spice if you use too much) to sprinkle over the apples and mixed together with a spoon to incorporate it all into the apples .  I also gave the apples a few squirts of vanilla and topped with a few dollops of butter(it's already high fat and calorie-why not go for the gold!).  Then for the topping I did one and a half batches for more crumbs.  I love the topping..I didn't use all brown sugar-I did half brown half white.  I also added in some more cinnamon to the crumbs. I  softened the butter not melted it for extra big crumbs-just squeeze in your hand and let them fall over the apples in big fat crumbs--YUMMMY!!!
No need for the water-the apples were squirting at me when I cored them-so I new they were juicy enough.  PERFECTION and I feel a need to go apple picking again so I can make more of this fabulous dessert!

This was great!  I ended up making a few modifications (I used extra-thick cut oats and added about half a cup of chopped pecans to the topping.  I also added a little fresh lemon juice to the apples, doubled the cinnamon, threw in about 2 tsp vanilla, and omitted the water). . .  the results were amazing.  I served it with caramel ice cream.  

My husband's friend summed it up best.  As I was passing out napkins, he said "This stuff is so good, I'm not going to waste it on a napkin.  I'll lick my own face if I need to!"

I ADORE this recipe. First off, to address other reviewers' issues with the the crisp being too sweet or too watery, I imagine that none of them made this with ten whole cups of apples. I used 10 apples and didn't come near 10 cups. I imagine 15-20 medium apples would come to that, and then the sugar/water would be fitting. Simply adjust with the amount of apples you use! My point is that the recipe itself is not flawed. And, as others have mentioned, definitely use Granny Smiths. DEFINITELY.

As I made it, I used ten smallish Granny Smiths, cut the sugar in half, omitted the water and instead tossed the sugar mixture with the apples, letting them release their juices. (I would have added water if I'd had more apples.) I doubled the crumble because that's my favorite part, but in hindsight I could have done with the original amount. It's very rich so not too much is needed.


What else... I ended up baking mine for about an hour because my apples weren't too ripe, but thankfully the top didn't burn. Oh, and I was delighted with the crumble using melted butter - I don't see any need to cut it in but I suppose it's up to one's personal preference. I made this with my mother, who has a famous apple pie recipe and doubted this crisp, but she conceded once she tasted it. Enjoy! :)

I just baked this last night and it is AMAZING! I am 15 years old and have recently developed a passion for baking. I love doing it and everyone who has tried what I make is a fan. :) I love any type of apple dessert, especially apple crisp, so I thought I'd try making it myself. Well, I am so glad I found this recipe. I used 10 rather small Granny Smith apples and that was just enough (luckily I bought a prepackaged bag of about a dozen because I was not sure how much 10 cups would be). I'm reading other reviews after I already made it, and I'm surprised to see how many people made changes to the recipe. I followed it exactly as it says and it turned out perfectly. One thing I must say though: when I cut it, it was very watery on the bottom, but that did not affect the taste. Overall it had the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I would definitely recommend this apple crisp to anyone and I will definitely be making it again! :)

Yum!  This is a great recipe with some alterations.  I cut the sugar in half (used 1/2 cup white sugar for apple mixture, and 1/2 cup brown sugar for topping), omitted the water (apples already contain a lot of moisture), and added walnuts to the topping.  I used Granny Smith apples which were tart, but a scoop of vanilla ice cream complemented this dessert perfectly.  And in the morning pour some milk over it and zap it in the micro for a warm delicious breakfast!

Made it TWICE in one week!!  I peeled and slices the apples VERY thin and tossed the apples in the cin./sugar (use 1/2 amoutn of sugar required) mixture with a splash of water (NOT 1/2 cup) and added nutmeg like other people suggested.  I doubled the crisp mixture and layered 1/2 on bottom of dish, then spead apples and put rest of the crisp mixture on top.  It was EXCELLENT!

Wow, was this delicious.  It rivals the "award-winning recipe" served at a local fancy restaurant.  I cut the apple mixture in half for a 9" square pan but made the full recipe of topping since I love a thick topping.  I used maybe 3/4 of it and it came out wonderful.  Will make this again and again.

First let me thank Diane for a great recipe. A truly wonderful dessert. I paired this with the "Rum sauce" from AR and got outstanding praises at the potluck I took it to on Sunday. I did read the reviews and did make some changes. I think the recipe as written would still be a 5 star Plus but the changes made just made it even better. Now the changes I made. First I doubled the topping. and put about half on the bottom of one of my lasagna pans and the rest on top. Another change I did was cut up all the apples with the Cuisinart and put them in a bowl with the sugar, flour, cinnamon mixture WITHOUT the water. The apples made more than enough liquid for this crisp. When I looked at the apples in the bowl and compared them to the pan I added more apples. I think I ended up using about 10 medium granny smiths that were peeled. The last change I made was to the ingredients to the topping. I added 1 1/2c of finely chopped pecans and mixed that in before adding the butter. My oven is pretty much dead on the mark as far as temperature goes and baked for the 45 minutes called for. I checked it and added about 5 more minutes to compensate for the extra apples (made it a bit thicker in the lasagna pan) and also wanted to be sure the topping was starting to brown to get the desired "crunch"! Watch it close or it will burn quickly at that point. I was asked to make this again for Thanksgiving. Oh, the Rum Sauce.... caught a couple of ladies going after JUST the sauce!!

the best apple crisp ever. My dad is an apple crisp specialist :)And he said it was the most perfect crisp he's eatin. I used 8 Granny smith apple and added 1tbsp lemon juice and one tsp vanilla to the apple's and NO WATER. The apples were perfect consistensy and in a nice sauce. Also I doubled the topping plus added an extra 1/2 butter because I had read some people said it was dry. It was perfect and really easy to make.I made it ahead of time and cooked when we got to our companies house. Amazingly delicious. A+++

I gave it 5 stars because it came out exactly as promised and made exactly as posted.  Normally I read reviews first, but am glad I didn't.  The type of apples will make a huge difference when making pies and crumbles because they give off different quantities of water when cooked (as many are finding out).  The thickness of the apple will also make a difference.  The thinner the slices, the musher the final product.  If you want something a bit chunkier, cut the apples about 1/4" thick.  Otherwise somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4".

I used granny smith apples, cut between 1/8-1/4" thick and I tossed the apples with the flour/sugar/spice mixture (did add 1/8 tsp cardamom as well) rather than just pouring it over the apples in the pan.  Then I poured the 1/2 cup water evenly over all of it before sprinkling the crumble evenly across the top.  It baked for exactly 45 minutes. Then I let it sit for 10 minutes to let everything cool and gel just a bit.  Perfect!  Just the right amount of syrup in the apples and just the right amount of crumble on top...and it is a crumble.  Sounds like some people are after more of a streusel topping which tends to be crunchier.

Excellent apple crisp, but just a little too sweet.  I used less than the 1 c of white sugar.  When I make it again, I will try 1/2 c.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Will definitely make this again.  My husband thought it was one of the best apple crisps I've made.  I bet peaches would be good, too.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a wonderful recipe. I made it exactly the way the recipe specified. I turned out delicious. My family loved it. Next time I might cut out the white sugar completly or at least cut it in half like suggested from other responses. I would also peel the apples. That was the only hard part. Slicing all those apples. But it was worth it.

Wow..this has to be one of the best recipes I've tried. Loved the crunchy crisp topping. I didn't add the 1/2 cup of water like it says but just added some butter to the apples and it turned out awesome. Don't think the water was neccesary.

This is my "go-to" apple crisp recipe...easy and delicious!!

It's great as-is, but after making it dozens of times, I've made three tweaks:
1) I prefer the apples chunky, so I cut them into wedges (not slices). To soften them a bit, I put them in a pot over low heat for about 10 minutes, with the water, until they barely start to cook. I toss the sugar, cinnamon and flour right into the pot with the apples. 

2) The apple mixture can be pretty sweet, so I usually cut the white sugar in half.

3) I use a lot more cinnamon than the recipe calls for, and add it to both the apples and the topping.

I thought the texture in this was excellent!  Family said it was "scarry good".  Added a little nutmeg as one of the other viewers suggested just because I like spice but it doesn't really need it.  2nd time I made it, I used Splenda reg. sugar and brown sugar and fat free butter.  Still was great.  This is a keeper.

I do not understand the positive ratings this recipe received!  This was TERRIBLE!  One previous reviewer called it "Apple Mush".  I agree completely.  Also, the topping was too sweet, and there was not enough oatmeal.  I'll stick with my own recipe.  I had high hopes for this -- sorry.

Definitely a fantastic recipe.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I did half the sugar for the apple mixture and also used half the water as other reviews suggested.  I figured the crumb topping had enough sugar and I was right.  It all came together great and we all enjoyed it.  This will be my go to for an apple dessert.  Thanks!

I wanted to pass along a helpful hint about apple choice when baking.  Choose Courtland or Empire for baking because they will hold their shape (one is just larger than the other and will require less work if you're making a large batch).  If you like tart apples, then try Granny Smith (I only use these for making coleslaw).  Avoid Red Delicious for baking (these are best eaten straight off the tree).  Do not use MacIntosh apples for this because they will not hold their shape when baked (they are best for apple sauce).  Hope this helps!

This is a winner!  I first cut the white sugar for the apples down to 1/2 cup and added about 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Used 9 cups of granny smith apples, plus 1 cup of mixed berries. Then made 1 1/2 times the recipe for the crumb topping mixture, adding about 1/2 c. crushed walnuts.  Buttered baking dish. 
Put about 1/3 of crumb topping mixture on bottom of pan before adding apples mixture, then remaining mixture of crumb topping. Baked 45 minutes.  Brushed melted butter to top of crumb mixture and baked 15 more minutes.
Excellent!  Great with vanilla ice cream! Eating some right now for breakfast!

Very good! Here's what I did, as only for my husband and I, I halved the 1st part of the recipe (5 cups of granny smith apples), with 1/4 cup of sugar (I would use even last sugar next time), and 2Tbs water. I also added 1/2tsp nutmegc 1/2 tsp allspice, and a few drops of vanilla extract and a bit of lemon zest and 1/3cup of raisins. I tossed the apple slices and raisins with the mixture and let soak for 20min. I did not half the crust but used 2/3cups of brown sugar instead of 1 cup (I'll use even less sugar next time), and I added 1/2cup of finely chopped walnuts. I cuted in the butter then added additional 2tbs melted butter.  Mixed well, then put a layer of crust on top and on bottom. When layering the apple/raisins on the crust, I left the juice behined. Baked perfectly in an 8*8 baking dish. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this once, as is, but it needed a little tweaking for my family.  Sp for Thanksgiving, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and I doubled the crust ingredients, reduced the water to ¼ cup, cut the butter in rather than melt it, tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, added a touch of nutmeg, 3+ teaspoons of cinnamon (even added some to the top crust). I lost count of how many apples I used - small/medium apples, in three varieties because it’s what I had on hand.  The entire pan was gone in under 10 minutes!  I’ve been told to make at least 3 for Thanksgiving!

Not much to add to an excellent dish with over 2000 reviews.  I did add nutmeg and doubled the topping. Will be on the Thanksgiving table. Thank  you Diane!

I've been making this one for years and it is so easy and tasty.  I change nothing and people love it EVERY.SINGLE.TIME!  I use sweet apples, I use tart, it makes no difference.  It really is just tasty.  I find 5 to 6 apples is what is needed for 10 cups.

I cut the recipe in half for a test drive and baked in an 8 x 8 pan.  It was the perfect size for our small family.  To the apple mixture, I added a little nutmeg and a pinch of salt. I also increased the flour to make a nice thick sauce and eliminated the water.  The salt will pull the natural juices out of the apples.  The end result was perfect, I will be making this many more times

Great recipe! I used 6 granny smith apples, which were just perfect for the amount of topping. I also made the following changes after reading other reviews... 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. water, then, half way through baking I melted 3 tbsp. of butter and drizzled it over the crumb to make sure it came out nice and crisp! Don't pass this one over, it's a goodie!

Great recipe.  WARNING: To those that don't like too much sweet! DON'T double the topping part as some recommend.  Ick.  Too overpowering for the apples. I followed recipe exactly except I omitted the water and it was plenty juicy and the topping was perfect (not to little, not too much)

Awesome recipe. Used 6 medium granny smiths, tossed them with the sugar/flour mixture before laying them in the baking dish. Doubled the topping, but ended up only using about 1 1/2 x the original amount. 
Used the full 1/2 cup water, would have been too dry without.

This is a great base recipe for apple crisp. I made a bunch of alterations to the original recipe. I felt that there was way too much sugar; therefore I only used a 1/3 of a cup of white and 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar.  I only added a few tablespoons of water (instead of a 1/2 cup) and mixed the apples well with the white sugar mixture.  The dessert was fabulous.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a really excellent apple crisp recipe and I think I'm going to adopt this one as my regular crisp recipe.  I would personally only use about 4 or 5 apples for a 9 x 13 because I like the "crisp" part the best.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

In one word, addictive.  I do think it could use less sugar, at least 1/2 cup, in with the apples.  I made it with 6 Granny Smith apples because I like to have more crisp than apples, but that was too few.  Next time I will try 8 or 9 apples.  Oh, and I used 1/4 cup water and it was about perfect, just a tiny bit watery.  Would be interested in sprinkling some nutmeg on top of the apples too as other reviewers suggested.  But all in all, it is a great recipe as is without any changes like nutmeg.  Thank you!

That's gooooooood ... I made few changes to boost the flavor. I used 5 apples, 1 plum peeled & cut to quarters. I used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 sugar cane molasses (I didn't have brown sugar) I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. substituted water for orange juice. added orange zest to the filling. for the crisp, i used 2/3s oat to 1/3 flour & I used cubes of butter (no melting). I served with lite vanilla ice cream & God ... that was goooood!

This recipe is exceptional! The only changes I made? I cut the amount of water in half that I put over the apples. Also, I mixed the apples in the mixture in a bowl (the sugar, Tbsp flour, cinnamon) to coat them better before sprinkling the water on AND I added maybe a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to that.
The topping though, I didn't change one bit and it is P.E.R.F.E.C.T!!!
Thank you, thank you, thank you to whomever contributed this wonderful recipe. I am quite sure I will be the one who is asked to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Not kidding people...it really IS that good:)
Happy Holidays!

Our large family did not like this recipe.  It was far too sweet.  I liked the idea of a little syrup forming with it but we just couldn't eat it.  I'm going back to Mom's old Betty Crocker recipe.

I made this yesterday and it was soooo yummy.  I only gave it 4 stars because I thought the water would have made it too runny.  I only made a few changes. I didn't use the water, baking soda or baking powder (was out of baking soda).  I also added a 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar mixture (love nutmeg) and a dash of cinnamon to the crumb mixture.  I just had some leftovers a few minutes ago and the crumb topping is still nice and crunchy.  My whole family really loved this and I will definitely be making this again and again.

This was a WATERY, embarassing disaster. I usually make Apple Oatmeal Crisp from this site (so awesome).  I wanted to try a recipe that served more for company at Thanksgiving. Sorry - I'll keep the Apple Oatmeal Crisp recipe.

This has to be the absolute best apple crisp I have ever eaten! We halved the recipe because 12 servings was going to be way too much for our family of four. A few tips from other readers to make this crisp superb: 1.Toss sliced apples with the sugar before putting in the dish. 2.Add 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the apple-sugar mixture. 3.Omit 1/2 cup of flour in the topping mixture. 4.Double the topping mixture so that  there is enough to press in the bottom of the dish as well to sprinkle on top. Extra good with on top and bottom! 5.Use cold butter cut into pieces in the topping mixture. Not melted as 
  recipe states. 6.10 cups of apples= 7 medium apples. That should do it. Bake and enjoy!

This recipe was excellent!  I read the reviews before making it so I did make some changes...I did double the topping recipe and added half on the bottom.  Then I took the sugar, cinnamon and flour mix and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and put that in a bag with the apples and coated them with it before I put them in the pan.  I then halved the water to 1/4 cup and topped it with the rest of the topping!  It turned out perfect will definitely make again!

I have been using this recipe for over a year now.  I do, as someone adviced earlier, double the ingredients for the crumble mixture and I eliminate the water.  My family asks for this to be made and I have a husband who generally doesn't like desserts.

The reason for doing this review is that yesterday I substituted PEACHES for the apples.  I didn't put the full amount of cinnamon in (used less than 1/2 teaspoon).  My husband said to try nutmeg instead of cinnamon next time, so I will give that a try.  Once again the whole family loved it.

This is a very delicious apple dish. I used a combination of Jona Gold and Delicious apples and included the water called for in the recipe.  This added a little more juice to the apples to go with the crunchy topping.  My family was quite impressed and this will be the only apple crisp made in my kitchen!

This was easy to make, and easy to improvise with. I added pecans to the topping, and cranberries to the fruit, and it was awesome! Everyone loved it.

My daughter made this recipe for the first time, she loved it, the ease of preparation,the taste afterward, the crisp texture of the crunch on top, very good, will try again.  I do not agree that there is too much oatmeal.

The best apple crisp ever.  Used Splenda instead of white sugar.

Delicious! But many thanks to the other reviewers, I read most of them in detail and based on the comments, reduced the sugar in the apple mixture to 1/2 cup, increased the flour to 1/3 cup, and reduced the water to 1/4 cup. I also allowed the apple mixture to sit in the fridge overnight to allow the fruit's natural juices to ooze and combine with the flour-cinnamon mix... Lovely! For the topping, I used 1 cup unpacked instead of packed brown sugar and I might try to reduce this to 3/4 cup the next time. Also, as other reviewers suggested, I cut in the butter to the topping instead of melting it and mixing it -- seemed to give me a better crumb topping. Oh and I also added a handful of chopped pecans to both the apple filling and the topping for that extra crunch. Will definitely make this one again, thanks!

I would attempt this recipe again.  I think most of the issues I have are from my own mistakes.  my mix of fuji and washington apples probably kept it from being as appley as it could have been.  I personally think it needed way more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg, cloves, etc.  you could get away with a lot less sugar in the apple mixture and add some more spices to the crumble part.  It didn't make the house smell all wonderful either...  im still gonna eat it.  I cant stand to waste all those beautiful apples!!!

I used ten medium granny smith apples and following another reviewer's recommendations I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and cut cold butter into the topping rather than melt it.  The result was delicious, but next time I will use 9 apples and follow the recipe with regard to the water and the butter. The topping turned out a little too dry for me.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but will make it exactly as written.

This recipe has the potential to be outstanding. It is missing a few things- more spices! Ground cloves are a great addition to this recipe as well as a little bit of nutmeg to bring out the cinnamon.  Also, water is not flavorful enough to toss the apples with, some apple cider would be the perfect touch.

great recipe -- the type of apple should be Granny Smith or anouther Baking apple. -- all purpose of pretty vague. Softer apples will fall apart & don't need as much bake time or sugar. I made it with 4 granny smith & 2 fiji & it was awesome.  whole oats work great too. :)

I made this for the first time and it turned out fantastic! I took the advice of other reviews and only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of water. I did not double on the toppings, but I am thinking I will next time. My family ate half of the batch in the first hour it was out of the oven. Definitely a fan favorite and I plan to use it again!

This is delicious! I doubled the crisp part and put under and over the apples and I soaked the apples in the sugar, flour and cinnamon as suggested. Delicious! I added a little nutmeg to the apple mixture. I didn't use baking apples so I didn't add the water but the mixture came out really juicy. This was reallly good!

This is awesome! I took the advice of others and only used 1/4 cup water and it turned out perfectly. Also doubled the topping, putting the apples between the two layers. It completely filled up my 9 x 13 Pampered Chef baking dish! I tossed the apples in the sugar and cinnamon mixture vs. pouring on top and the apples came out perfectly. Because I doubled the topping I baked it for close to an hour and it was perfectly done.  Granny Smith apples worked well for me. And I didn't notice until just now that the recipe doesn't specify if the apples are to be peeled--I guess I just assumed they were to be peeled, so that's what I did. Served with vanilla ice cream for a birthday lunch today (my sister requested this vs. a birthday cake) and everyone loved it.

This was a very good recipe and probably would taste wonderful with vanilla ice cream (unfortunatly I'm all out) The only reason why I did'nt give this recipe a 5 star is I found it a little too sweet (but the flavour was very good). It was even too sweet for my 8 year old. She would'nt eat it. Everyone else did although they all said the same thing. I will definitely try this again using less sugar and I would also use a more tart apple like granny smith.

The first time I tried this, I cut the sugar in half as some reviewers suggested, and we were not impressed with the result.  I decided to give it one more try as originally posted, and it is FABULOUS!  Don't change a thing - it makes a wonderful apple crisp and the "sauce" thickens as it cools.  I'd give this one 10 stars if I could.  SUPER RECIPE!  Thanks so much!  :o)

delicious! a great oatmeal topping--its kind of crunchy like granola, but not too crunchy. i lightened this recipe by subtituting splenda for the sugar, i used maybe a little less than half of the brown sugar called for in the recipe, and i used light butter in replacement which has 1/2 the calories and much less fat. i also used old fashioned rolled oats, instead of instant. it turned out perfect. a good breakfast as well because of it being healthier. adding fat free coolwhip to top it off makes it even better!

YUM YUM YUM!!!  I quadrupled this recipe and made 4 apple crisps for a Thanksgiving party at my office.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I didn't measure the apples, I just packed a whole bunch of them in the pans and tossed them with just the cinnamon and sugar, because I've found that the flour and water sometimes makes it gummy.  I also just cut in the butter, I didn't melt it.  The crisps turned out so good, I got rave reviews at work!

This apple crisp recipe is a great find. I agree that the water should be decreased to about 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup (depending on your personal pref.) Other than that it's perfect, and so easy to make.

The crisp was great!What worked out best for my family was to forget the water, cut the white sugar to 2/3 cup, add a little nutmeg, and as far as apples use 2/3 Golden Del. and 1/3 tart apples (Mac's or Courtlands ). Also double the crust.

Great recipe!  As good as my grandfather's recipe, and his is an all-time favourite!  The only modifications I made were to use 1/3 a cup of sugar in the apple mixture and I increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons.  I thought the topping would be sweet enough, so that's why I cut back on the sugar with the apples.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!

Excellent!  Followed other suggestions & used about 8 cups apples (Granny Smith) and doubled the topping.  Perfect!  Will make again & again.
I used fat free frozen vanilla yogurt instead of ice cream so I wouldn't feel quite so guilty :)

Excellent Recipe!!!  Whole family loved it!
I was out of cinnamon, oops.
One recommendation though I cheated and doubled the crisp topping because I thought that it was not enough to cover such a big dish.  Still not diappointed. 
Thanks again.

The recipe was delicous.  I made it in school the one day to try it and everyone in my class loved it.  So I made it as part of my project and served it to the two people I had come in.  They loved it too.  It was really big thing for everyone that tried it.  I would make it over and over again.

Good recipe.  I found it to be a nice texture; not so much flour that it was more like apple betty or so much oatmeal and butter that the apples were over powered.  The recipe halved and served with ice cream was prefect for 4 adults and 2 small children.

This is so good and easy to make.  I made it for a gathering of women and they loved it & wanted the recipe.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and warm caramel drizzled over the top.  I know I'll be making this again, and again.  Very tasty, and highly recommended.

Great!  I usually use the joy of cooking's recipe for apple crisp, and for some reason it never occurred to me to search the web for a good recipe...

Well, I'm happy to report that this one is much better!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, maybe a little less sugar on the apples.

When it comes to the "extra water" debate, I think that it really depends on the apples you are using.  If they are juicy, they will bubble up and be delicious, but if they are dry, it is not going to work.  I usually peek into the oven about halfway through the cooking time, and if the apples look  like there's not enough juice, then adding a little water works magic.  Some people I know use orange juice.  It really doesn't matter, but you want a little sauce to make the dish really work.  

So for me, I don't add any water, and then check on it halfway through and decide if it could use some.  I am so glad I have a new apple crisp recipe!

It's far too sweet! 

The crumble part of the recipe is really good, and it makes a lot

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I made it exactly as written. It was delicious, however, it was pretty sweet and a bit too runny for my taste. When I made the recipe the second time I added a 1/2 Tbsp of flour and I grated the rind of a small lemon and added the juice from the lemon. The sweetness of the crisp was cut and it was runny .... perfect I think, especially with a scoop of quality vanilla ice cream when serving.

I followed the instructions of many-many reviews by doubling the crumble and putting half on the bottom, as well as halving the mount of liquid added. It was SO tasty, but a tad dry with all that crust. Next time(and there WILL be a next time) I'll again do the double crumble, but do the full amount of water called for. :-)

Absolutely yummy! However, I didn't give it 5 stars because it was entirely too sweet.  Next time I will add 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup.  I also replaced the 1/4 cup of water with apple juice.  Will definitely make this again!

flavor was pretty good but mine turned out really liquidy.  Could be the type of apple I use.  Ginger Golds - it said they were good for baking.

This apple crisp is one of the best things I have ever cooked!  Very tasty with caramel and whipped topping. I mixed up extra topping because it is my favorite part, and it was perfect. I will use this recipe forever!

By far, the best apple crisp I have ever eaten. I've made many, many recipes before but this is the "apple of my eye". And so easy ... who would have thought? Thank you for submitting this. It goes into my permanent recipe file.

This is excellent.  I made a half of recipe with a few changes.  First I didn't peel the apples, I added some fresh ginger to the apple mixture, I used whole wheat flour and I added a 1/2 cup of pecan pieces.  Adding the pecans was the real winner.  Next time I'll try less flour more oats and less brown sugar but it's a great recipe as it.  I like to eat this with no fat plain yogurt added to the top.   thanks

I made this with half the water and 2x the crumble (1/2 on top and bottom)  I wish I hadn't cut down on the water by half because it was a little dry, but im sure that was because i doubled the crust.  It was still very good!  I used Fuji apples because that's all i had, next time I make it I will use granny smith and make sure to keep the water as stated!  Yummo!

I made it exactly according to the recipe. If I were to make it again, I'd say that I would double the topping. However, this is purely from an indulgent perspective. There is absolutely enough topping to cover the apples and then some, just not enough topping to satisfy the cook who always doubles the amount of topping, cheese, butter, ect, in a recipe to make it absolutely stupendous.  It was awesome just the way it was. I served it for Christmas dessert with some vanilla ice cream, and there was nothing left!

This was fabulous and made my husband's night.  I just made two minor changes; there are only two of us so I cut the apple part of the recipe in half, but kept the topping amount the same and was glad I did.  I also used cold butter cut into little chunks and cut it into the flour/oat mixture.  Oh, and added a couple grates of fresh nutmeg to the apples.  Next time I will melt the butter per the original recipe and see if there is a difference in the texture of the crust.

This recipe was quick and easy and tasted wonderful!  I did not use the water and cut the white  sugar in half.  I did not double the topping but someone mentioned doing so and putting one layer on bottom and one on top.  If you like lots of the crisp that would work.  I would also cut the slices in thirds next time.  Definitely a "make again" recipe!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!! I have been meaning to review this for a long time now, I have made this several times, and is a must the first day of autumn in my household. We all love this so much, it's the best apple crisp I have ever had. I added some chopped walnuts to the crumb topping, and that adds nice flavor and crunch. I serve this with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream on top. Thank you so much for sharing this. *UPDATE 9/25/09* If you don't want much "sauce", I highly recommend using 1/4 cup of water instead of a 1/2 cup, but I prefer using the 1/2 cup that's called for, you could always add another Tablespoon of flour. I use 1/2 Granny Smith apples and 1/2 Red Delicious for this crisp. Also, a drizzle of caramel sauce is excellent on this along with vanilla ice cream. Other than the water amount, this recipe doesn't need tweaking. Don't mess with perfection :)

Every guest that tried some loved it. Mine turned out a bit watery but I used apples that had been frozen, thawed, and not drained enough. The flavor was wonderful! I always add a dash of cinnamon to the crisp topping part; other than that the recipe was made as stated. Mmm! UPDATE: Made this again with fresh apples, and it still came out a bit watery. Next time I will cut the water in half; but honestly, it's a nice syrupy consistency that is great over ice cream! This time I added 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon allspice to the topping.

Pretty good - there is absolutely no need for water in this recipe.  Be sure to use cooking apples - a mix of 2 or 3 varieties is great.

I wish I could give it ten stars or more...this recipe was awesome!!  I will never use a different recipe again.  I used half Red Gala Apple and half Granny Smith and doubled the topping and I did not use any water.  It was perfect, still very moist with the perfect amount of sweetness.  I will never use another apple crisp recipe again!!

For a long time, I've been trying different recipes to find the best apple crisp, and hadn't found it until now I think. This may be the recipe that has given me the best compliments for an apple crisp in a looong time! I halved the recipe, and baked in an 8X8 pyrex pan, and used about 5 granny smith apples, followed everything else exactly (but divided by 2). It came out delicious, and perfectly caramelized, which is often hard to get, and that is what I've been looking for in all the recipes. Finally, my mom agrees that it's a really good crisp! I would strongly recommend granny smith apples, they are perfect for this recipe, and trust me, NOT any kind of apples would do! You really need an apple that is firm, that keeps its shape and that has a good flavor for baking. Thanks for sharing your recipe, it was great!

This was really yummy! Who doesn't love a warm apple crisp with vanilla ice cream? I doubled the crumble mixture, but didn't quite use all of it, but it was still worth it! The only change I will make is to use less sugar next time because it was a little too sweet than I would normally like it, but still a winner.

used the pumpkin spice instead of cinnimon and nutmeg (it has both). tossed the apples in lemon juice. added peccans. cut up the butter instead of melting it....and only used 1/4 cup of water.....took the advice of others and doubled the crisp, putting a layer on the top and bottom.  IT WAS PERFECT! can't wait to use it onThanksgiving.

I have made this twice now.  The first time I used Gala apples, they added great flavor, but were pretty mushy.  I also added chopped walnuts to the crust-that was excellent!  The second time I used Jonagold apples and they stayed nice and crisp, but didn't have near the flavor.  That time I put chopped almonds in the crust (also very good!)  All in all the actual recipe is good, but not much different than any other recipe I have tried, it really depends on the quality of apple you use.

Very, very good.  Whole family loved it. Followed the advice of other reviewers. Used a 5lb. bag of granny smiths this filled up 9 x 13 pan to the top. Then I did not add water, let the apples and sugar sit for 10 or 15 minutes before cooking. Added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger to the topping, more butter, one and a half the topping. In the apple mixture, less sugar, 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup,  used half brown sugar and half white. Added a little lemon juice to the apple mixture. 1 tbs cinnamon instead of 1 tsp. to the apple mixture. Turned out great.

Amazing!!  I omitted the water since apples are in season and don't need any additional moisture.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This might be the best homemade apple crisp I've ever tried!

This was a great recipe.  I went apple picking with my family and wanted a recipe to help me use up some of them.  This recipe was easy to follow and didn't take too long to prepare.  My family and I loved it.  It was even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

This was a lovley and easy recipe. I have made it twice once adding the water and finding it soggy on the bottom and too "wet". The 2nd time I did not add the water and let the natural juices from the apples take over. It didn't last long and with it warmed up, a little ice cream and whip cream mmmm yummy

I'm giving this a 3 star rating, only because the type of apples used have a big impact on the outcome.  I used gala apples, but still was not impressed with the results.  As other reviewers noted, it definitely does NOT need water.  I also felt that the amount of sugar called for, to be mixed in with the apples made it a little too sweet.  However, my biggest concern was that it lacked that "WOW" factor.  If I were to make it again, I'd add a pinch of salt to the apples, decrease the quantity of white sugar, and try adding more spices (cinnamon and nutmeg; possibly allspice), and grated orange or lemon zest.  Or perhaps some dried cranberries.  I'd leave the topping exactly as called for.  That part was good, and the quantity was perfect; no need to double it, as some reviewers suggested.

This was very good.  My family loved it!  My husband said it was better than his Mom's apple pie.  I would not add water next time.  It was too soupy.  I will also spice it up next time.  I used home grown apples.  It was delish!!

Great, simple recipe (but of course I had to make some adjustments).  I had a lot of red delicious on hand, so I cut the sugar in half and used 1/4 c water like another reviewer suggested.  Also, I made more topping -- I increased everything by 1.5 -- and the only thing I will change for next time was to add a teeny bit more salt.  Maybe 1/2 tsp.  I used real butter and it was well received!

the best! made a few slight changes. i used heavy cream instead of water,"will seem runny, but let the crisp soak up the heavy cream" couple squirts of lemon, and lime juice. to help apples from turnning brown, and a little more tartness. and only bake mine for 40 minutes."like my crisp a little under done"

I followed the advice of others and left out the water and added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg. I also baked it an extra 15 minutes because of those who said 45 minutes wasn't long enough - but I wish I hadn't, the apples turned out sort of mushy. I had intended on adding some almonds to the topping but forgot, so I toasted them seperatly and sprinkled them over the topping after removing it from the oven, and this added a nice flavor. All in all, this recipe was pretty good, but I still think my mom's is better!

Nice crunchy crust - I doubled it, but it was too sweet and could not taste the apples.  Also, I decreased sugar on apples and did add the water - big mistake - got applesauce.  Next time, I will leave out the water (water + sugar = syrup; if you decrease the sugar, leave out the water or you will get applesauce like me!)

Unbelievably easy and soooooo delicious!  I wouldn't change a thing, other than making extra topping.  I used one and a half times the topping recipe and it was just perfect.  I wasn't sure what kind of apples to use, so I bought a bag of red delicious and they were just perfect in both flavor and texture (it took about 9-10 apples).  As I sliced the apples, I sprinkled them with a tiny bit of lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.  My family thanks you for this WONDERFUL recipe! :-)

SOOO good...with a minor change.  I used tart granny smith apples, and 1 C. sugar was still much too sweet.  Cutting down to about 1/2 C. made the recipe perfect.  I also doubled the topping (it is definitely the best part)!  MUST serve with vanilla ice cream!

This is a really good crisp recipe.  Next time I will add a little less water.  It was a little runny in the bottom of the pan.  I threw in a handful of orange flavored "cranraisins" for something different, would be great with a fall or Thanksgiving meal.

Outstanding apple crisp, though a bit too sweet for us. Next time I will cut sugar 3/4c in the apples and 3/4c in the topping. I also increased flour to 1 1/2T over the apples. Yummy! Thanks, Diane.

I gave this recipe to my 14 year old daughter to make for our family and it was a hit!  She used Granny Smith apples and it was perfectly tart and sweet.  I will add walnuts or almonds to the topping next time, but otherwise, it's a great recipe.

Not very good for someone who doesn't particularly care for oatmeal - I thought the taste would be much more subtle than it was. I felt like i was eating apple oatmeal crisp.

I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out fantastic.  I do use a Tablespoon of cinnamon instead of a teaspoon.  And I recommend using granny smith apples.  I have tried several different types of apples and the grannies always come out the best.

This will continue to be a staple in my kitchen.

I used Honey Crisp apples, they have a great flavor (sweet with a slight tartness) and so I think I should have reduced the white sugar- mine turned out quite sweet.  I followed the top review that said to reduce the water to 1/4 cup, but found there was quite a bit of liquid on the bottom.  I am not sure I'll add water the next time I make it.  It is delicious though, and makes the house smell like fall.  Definitely worth making!

I used 1 1/2 times the crust. My crust turned out perfect. I cut the cubes of butter in small pieces then used a pastry cutter (?) to cut the butter into the mixture. At first, it was too fine so I just stuck the crust bowl over the vent of the oven to let the butter melt a bit. I used half about the white sugar. 7 Granny Smith apples cut about 1/2 inch thick.  I added an extra 2 tsps of cinnamon, and a touch of nutmeg. Mixed sugar mixture into the apples, instead of pouring on top. Only added 1/4 cup water.

This recipe is good but if you read the reviews you'll see that some omit the water completely and others reduce it and other tell you it's too sweet.  I cut the water in half and it was still a soupy mess and still very sweet.  That means either leave out the water completely or just add a tiny bit, say 1/10th the amount.  Of course this will make the recipe that much sweeter, so that's something to take into account as well.  The taste is amazing, just needs to have the right texture and you won't get that with the recipe as is.

Great recipe with my substitutions. 1. Sub Apple Cider Vinegar for water and only use 1/4 cup instead of water. 2. Add a pinch of nutmeg to sugar mix. 3.Coat the apple slices in the sugar mixture instead of just piling on top. 4. Toast the oats slightly before adding to the topping to bring out more flavor.

Way too sweet! Hurt my teeth, couldn't stomach it. Couldn't taste the fruit due to sweetness.

I am not a baker. I suck at it. I am impatient and don't have a sweet tooth. However, I had apples to use up....hence this recipe. Loved it. More importantly, my guests loved it. It was all gone - one person had 3 servings. Thanks so much for making me trick my guests into thinking I was a baker! :)  I did follow some other reviews and lessened the water and doubled the topping. Perfect.

I LOVED this recipe, but I certainly added my own flair. Everyone came back for seconds and thirds and begged me for the recipe. It's an awesome crisp! Here is what I did differently.

I used a mix of Granny Smiths and Red Delicious. Added 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 full because of the apple mixture. Added in caramel sprinkles from Pampered Chef.  Perfection! I added about 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. Added nutmeg and salt (a dash).  Doubled the topping and used old fashion oats and just a little more than 2 sticks of butter. With doubling the topping it requires 2.

These changes ended up making it the perfect combination of tart, sweet, salty, buttery, and crunchy. It's amazing. I'm eager to make it again.

Flipping fantastic!

Oh wow!  This is amazing!  I did as others recommeded, tossed the apples with the sugar, etc and doubled the topping.  I used a lot less sugar since I used fujis.  I didn't have enough butter so ended up using some coconut oil, oh yum!  Also added some cranberries and a little walnuts.

Not only did I love it, but everyone around loved it.  Heard over and over that it was the best apple crisp they ever had.  They keep asking me to make more.  People are bringing apples and begging.  I read some of the reviews and followed some of the suggestions.  I did not add water, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon sugar mix before putting them in the pan.  I then doubled the topping and put it all on the top.  People loved that because it gives them more crunch with the apples.  Enjoy!!!

As written, this recipe is just okay.  It does not need any water at all.  The water actually ruins it.  I also think that adding a pinch of nutmeg gives it that little something extra.  With those 2 changes, this is a 5 star recipe.

I have made this again and again.  I love the simplicity of the recipe.  It is very forgiving with the number and type of apples you have.  I always halve this recipe, but last time I accidentally used the full amount of flour and I loved it that way.  The filling got a lot thicker, like apple pie.  It is still too sweet and I always forget to cut the sugar down.  This last time I was convinced to double the crumb topping and I regretted it.  I didn't even use the full recipe I had made, but I added more than the recipe called for.  I am all for a nice thick crumb topping, but I think the quantity called for is just perfect.  Cut the sugar and double the flour.  What a great recipe that can be thrown together in a hurry with ingredients I always have on hand!


Original review:I agree with other reviewers.  As written, this is too sweet, but some of that depends on the apples you choose.  I had golden delicious from a trip to the local orchard so my apples were too sweet for the amount of sugar specified.  I will use Granny's next time and a little less sugar.  I think the water was unnecessary, but I imagine that also depends on your apples.  I had to use a paper towel to soak up some of the water after the first piece came out of the dish.  I followed the recipe except I made an 8x8 casserole.  I halved the filling but made the whole topping recipe as someone else suggested.  The topping was good but I agree with another reviewer that some finely chopped nuts would be a goo

I've made this 3 times now, I agree with other reviewers it's the best apple crisp i've made with one exception, I do not add the water.
I use macs and I usually use  about 3 1/2 lbs (prior to peeling and coring).  I too find this to be my go to crisp recipe.

What's a great way to say goodbye to Summer and hello to Fall?  This recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did followed a reader's suggestion and baked it in a 8x8 pan. I used 8 Granny Smith apples and cut them in thicker chunks. I think next time I'll use a bit less water but other than that, it was fantastic!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very nice treat - look forward to trying with other fruit.  Love how easy it was. Only used 1/3 cups white sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar with golden delicious apples and sweetness was just right.  Included ground flax seed in the 'crisp' mixture to add extra fiber.

Fabulous. Better than mine.
I added brown sugar instead of white, 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 and a little nutmeg as well as the cinnamon.
1/2 cup of water would have been fine. It would have mixed well with the brown sugar and given more syrup.  Next time I will follow the appropriate amt of water.
Served with vanilla ice cream but was great without.
On a scale of 1 to 10, my family gave this a 15.  Wonderful, thanks for sharing.

I live in India so we don't get granny smith apples all the time. I baked it with 8 red delicious apples with 2tsp of lemon juice for tartness, skipped water(as suggested in other reviews), reduced sugar to half and wow!!! My kids and hubby finished the whole thing. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. A definite keeper.

Amazing, just simply amazing! I made this as a dessert for my family and it was just the easiest thing to make. I made it while making dinner and by the time everyone was done with their meals, the crisp was out of the oven, cooled, and ready to be served. I myself didn't use granny smiths because I can't handle the tartness of the apple, so I used red delicious and you would have thought it'd be too sweet, but it actually wasn't. I added a bit of cinnamon to the oat mixture with just a dash of nutmeg just to give it a bit more of that warmth you get from great dishes like this one. Perfect cooking time, measurements, everything. Had the whole house smelling like it was late fall again! I recommend this recipe to anyone looking to whip something up for dessert, because this is phenomenal and just off the charts.

I made this for a coworker's fall birthday and it was fantastic. I used Fiji apples, which bake well. The amount of topping to apples ratio was perfect too. I always have issues getting crisp topping to be the right consistency when I use cold butter. Finally, using melted butter, the consistency was exactly right. My husband was surprised. He's a professional baker and cutting in melted butter flies in the face of baking logic, but I've used it in other recipes and it works. Well done and thanks for sharing Diane!

JUST the kind of recipe I was looking for! Easy, yet produces the "Yum" factor for guests and family we look for at the end of a meal!! As other reviewers suggested, I omitted the water, (I used 3 types of apples) added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and doubled the topping. Was perfect for a 9X13 pan. This will be my 'standard' from now on...

This is an awesome recipe and can be used with other fruit too!  I added some pecans to the crust and it gave it some more crunch and great flavor! I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg over the apples.  I will make this recipe again!

I was so disappointed! This was my first shot at apple crisp and it was just mushy and overly sweet. I had a layer of uncooked topping when I took it out of the oven and mixing it in just made more of the goo.

this was a fabulous recipe - I used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 of white sugar on the apple topping with about 1/2 a cup of water.  Doubled the crumble topping as other reviewers recommended.  PERFECTLY cooked in 45-50 minutes.

This was great. I made a few changes to make it diabetic friendly and it was a big hit. I used Smart Balance for baking in place of the butter/margarine. I used 1/2 cup Slenda Brown Sugar in place of the brown sugar. I used 1 cup of White Slenda for the sugar. I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.

Terrific, but make sure you use a full 10 cups of sliced apples. I had fewer to work with and it came out a bit too sweet, I knew it was due to not enough apples to begin with.  My Picky son loved it. He is picky about both his apple pie and his apple crisp.

It was delicious, the only critique I'd make is for the crust to meld together and get crispier.  I took a few reviewers suggestions and doubled the crust making a bottom and top layer.  I didn't alter the water, however I did mix Granny Smith apples cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar and water together, let set together while mixing ingredients for the crust.  In my opinion, it would have been too dry with less water.

Excellent.  I followed the advice to use 1/4 cup water rather than 1/2 cup water.  It was the perfect amount of moisture.  I used Granny Smith apples which I would recommend as they are tarter than Delicious or other sweeter eating apples.  I did put in a pinch of nutmeg because I like that flavor and as others, I doubled the "crisp" part.  When I assembled it, I mixed the apples in the sugar mixture and when I put on the "crumbly part" I ended up not using all of the double batch.  Next time I will make 1 1/2 batch and that will be perfect.  This will now be my one and only apple crisp recipe.  Thank you for the recipe.

Fabulous recipe! I've tweaked it to my tastes and have yet to hear any complaints. I've cut both the white and brown sugar back to 1/3C each. I've also substituted the water with Disarono, Grand Marnier or Cognac - whichever happens to be on hand. The sugar from the liqueur makes up for cutting the white and brown sugar from the recipe. This is a fabulous go to dessert!

I love this apple crisp!! I keep making it because it's so good and really simple.  I do think that the apple quantity does not match up with the topping; if I use only 4 apples the crumb topping covers it okay (but is still skimpier than I like), but if I use more than that (I like to use 6 apples) I need to double the topping.

Aside from doubling the topping, I don't change a thing in this recipe.  I have tried variations of it (less sugar, less water, no water) and I think the water is necessary.  Without the water the apples are too dry.  The one time I made it without water I had to add extra milk (I always eat my crisp with milk) and it still wasn't as good.  Those who don't like really sweet desserts may want to use less sugar, but I love the recipe as it is.  Thanks for posting!

Splenda was used since I am diabetic and let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS!  I was able to enjoy an entire desert and not worry about my blood sugar!  Excellent recipe and I love the crisp on the top!  Amazing!

Excellent apple crisp recipe!  After reading other reviews I made the following changes:  used Granny Smith apples (6), reduced water to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, cut in room temperature butter instead of melted, and doubled the crumb topping.  It came out delicious!  The texture was perfect and not too watery -- just right.  Next time I will use only 5 apples to leave more room for extra crumb topping.  I will also reduce the sugar to 1/2 - 3/4 cup -- it was a bit too sweet for me.  I will also try to make larger crumb pieces for a crispier topping.  For a first run, this was an excellent start!  With a few tweaks of personal preference it will be perfect!  Thanks for sharing Diane :)

I would use less sugar in the apple mixture next time, especially if serving with ice cream.  Would also be good with some chopped walnuts added to the topping.

omg!!! this is sooooo good. I have been making this for the past 3 years. I took a break for 6 months. My co-worker noticed and requested it again!!! Since then, it has been my secret weapon! I took sugar out (if you use fiji apples, they have that extra sweetness you need) and added a teaspoon of cinnamon for extra kick. I also added a tablespoon of lemon to help prevent browning of the apples .

I make this recipe atleast twice a year, Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is super delicious. I always double the topping (my favourite part) and I actually reduce the sugar by half because my family does not like eating sweet desserts. I tend to do this in general with most dessert recipes and they turn out just fine. I also use half a cup of orange juice instead of the water which helps keep the apples from oxidizing.   Thank-You so much for sharing a simple and delicious recipe! I will definitely pass this on to friends and family.

Made this with Granny Smith apples and half the sugar mixture mixed in with it but it was too tart.  Made this the second time with golden delicious apples and the full amount of sugar mixed in and it was PERFECT!  Served warm with ice cream.

I've made this recipe twice, and I thought I lost it and panicked! I'll be making it again tomorrow. When I make it, I use brown instead of white sugar, and I only use 1/2 a cup as well. I found that only 1/4 C of water was necessary too, as others have said. I also doubled the topping. The first time I made it, I at first made a single batch of the topping and then mixed another before sliding it into the oven because it was clearly not enough for my personal preference. I topped this with a small amount of fresh whipped cream for a perfect dessert!

I cut the recipe in half and it fit nicely in a square pan. It took 6 apples to make the 5 cups neccessary for a half a recipe, and I sliced them thin about 1/4". Instead of quick oats I used old fashioned oats because I like the look and texture of the whole oats. This was delicious and the right blend of sweetness and crispness. Thank you Diane.

This was really delicious! I also used only 1/4 cup of water, and that was PLENTY! I think it would be much too wet at the bottom if 1/2 cup of water is added. It was a quick, easy recipe that really impressed my guests. Thank you!

This recipe is perfect the way it is! I made it as directed except for making 1/2 a batch and using an 8x8 pan. I used a good baking apple from our local orchard, I think they were Cortland. Don't change a thing about this recipe because it's perfect as written!

Excellent!  Made this for a family cookout and it disappeared quickly.  Followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the crumb topping, and I also tossed the apples in the sugar mix, and also added a little nutmeg to the apples.  Turned out great and will definitely be making this again.

YUM! This was the best apple crisp I've ever had! I left out the water and so glad I did because there was juice at the bottom from the apples after baking. It was more like a "carmely" sauce, so with added water...it would have been too runny. Also, I used Fuji apples, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and doubled the crumble topping. Another tip: DON'T MELT THE BUTTER! Just soften it, wash your hands and squeeze/crumble the butter into the topping mixture...the warmth of your hands will make the perfect crumbly texture. I served this with French Vanilla Bean ice cream and it was PERFECT! Definitely going to keep making this one...THANK YOU! =)

I've made this twice now and it's been GREAT both times! Plan to make again in the next day or two. Delicious, homey recipe. Be sure and use a mix of BAKING apple varieties. Not all apples are suited for baking. I read some of the negative reviews and can't figure out where they went wrong. For those complaining that the topping is too dry, be sure that you've melted the butter and mixed it thoroughly with the other topping ingredients. Kudos, Diane, on a recipe going in my permanent file!

This was very good! However after baking I had lot of liquid in my pan. It may be from the type of apples I used(Cortland). I drained a good bit of it out of the pan, thickened it with cornstarch and poured over the top of the crisp.This was an overall great recipe. Next time I will try different apples or omit the water all together.

This is Fall dessert Heaven!  I forgot to add the water, and it turned out just fine.  The topping was "crisp"-y, and almost like a crumbled oatmeal cookie.  Fabulous & easy, will make again soon!

I was soooo happy to find this recipe!  It's exactly the same recipe that I'd found in one of my grandmother's very old cookbooks (from, maybe the 1910's), but I lost it about 10 years ago.  The topping tastes like cookie!  (I admit to eating some of the topping mix raw, lol.) Like other commenters, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, I added some nutmeg to that mixture, and I also used less water.  I doubled the topping, and I used softened butter rather than melted.

WOW!  This is my "go-to" recipe for apple crisp!  We had a bumper crop of apples this year and I'm now baking our 4th pan.  As per earlier reviews, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon-sugar mixture before putting in the pan and omitted the water.  I also doubled the topping recipe and it is SOOO YUMMY!!!!  Each time we've served it to guests they ask for the recipe, that's a great sign.  Thanks for the recipe, it's one for the family collection!

I made this recipe especially because it included oats, which give an extra great taste to the topping! It turned out pretty nice. I kept in the water and didn't have any problem with the crisp being watery. In fact, the extra moisture helps the topping, which remains rather dry all-around. For next time, I would add perhaps 1/4 cup more butter for the topping, as it was a little dry and not rich enough. Also, I might cut down the white sugar to 1/2 cup because the result is indeed quite sweet. I will definitely make this again and might even try it with some cherries. Yum. Very nice comfort food!

This a great, classic apple crisp recipe.  We loved it.  I don't agree with other reviewers that it had too much water.  To make it healthier I mixed 1/4 cup of honey with the apples instead of sugar and used whole wheat flour.  It doesn't affect the flavor at all, and makes it good enough to be considered a healthy dessert. For a variation, I tried it one time with frozen cranberries and some nutmeg mixed in, and it transported me right to the holidays.  I can't wait to make it again for Christmas time (of course I could make it any time of the year, but detracts from the special holiday feel:).

I have made apple crisp a million times. I just threw out my old recipe.. This is perfection and I am a perfectionist. Oh sure a trillion people want to change the recipe to there liking, but to those of you who haven't tried this yet, make it the way it is. You can add your allspice or nutmeg, but that even might take away from its originality. I love the crumbley crisp part, so I double it. also I dont like alot of the syrup so I nix the water and sprinkle some vanilla. 5 stars well deserved here, this is now my regular sunday night all time favorite.

This is an updated review.  Really liked this recipe :)  Changed just a little to our taste.  Used 3 lbs. granny smith apples, no water.  Used 1/2 cup real maple syrup to replace 1/2 of the sugar, used brown sugar for the other half.  Made 1 and 1/2 times the topping which was perfect for us.  This was very traditional apple crisp, just what we were looking for.  Thank you for the recipe!

Terrible! We followed the directions for the most part, taking into account other's recommendations of limiting water and doubling the crust but were thoroughly disappointed. When removed from the oven we had to shovel off an inch of uncooked dried crust. Then soaked the top layer in shots of spiced rum to moisten it up. It gave it the perfect kick to a college's students attempt at baking. Overall, the recipe was a failure.

I have made many apple pies, crisps, etc. and this is very good.  I've made it 3 times and this is what I have done differently..
1)cut back on the water and instead of using water, I used 1/2 cider, 1/2 lemon juice

2) I mixed a little bit of nutmeg in with the apple mixture.

3) I was trying to make it a bit more 'crispy' on top, so I put underneath the broiler set on low for a quick moment.  Next time I might drizzle more butter on top, also

I followed other reviewers and doubled the oatmeal/sugar mixture, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to apples and used only 1/4 cup water. I will remember to grease well my pan next time, because my crisp stuck on the bottom.  I had probably sweeter type of apples because it was too sweet for us, so I might decrease the sugar and/or add some lemon juice. Otherwise pretty good.

A decent crisp recipe, but it didn't need all that water. I think it's a matter of knowing your apples and how much moisture/sugar they need. I prefer brown sugar in a crisp, so that's what I used. But if you want an after-dinner dessert that goes together quickly, this will do it.

This was delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 8x8 pan because I needed a smaller batch.  I baked for 35 minutes also.  However, I kept the recipe the same and it was PERFECT!

I've been searching for a recipe like this for years! It reminds me of a one my mom used to make for desserts when I was a kid. My husband and I both loved it. Instead of water I splashed the top with pure vanilla, it made the house smell GREAT after it was finished baking.

I made this for my mom to take to a dinner party.

Right off the bat I used 2 granny smith and 5 Macintosh apples. It was for a smaller dish (9 by 9) so I meant to cut the sugar down a bit because of the sweeter apples and size, but I forgot and used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown as well as added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon. I tossed the apples in the sugar/flour mixture before pouring them in the dish. I also only used 1/4 cup water as per other reviews. Then I did 1 and 1/2 times the topping so I could put some on the bottom, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to that. 

By all accounts it was perfect. Not too sweet which is shocking! This recipe is a definite winner!

3.5 stars as written, 10+++ stars with simple modifications.  Here's what I did a little bit differently:   (1) instead of adding 1 cup of white sugar to the apples I added 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white.  That was plenty, and next time I'll just add 1/2 of brown.  (2) added 1tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of allspice to the crust.  (3) used a cheese grater to grate 1/2 cup of almost frozen butter to the topping mixture instead of the melted butter.  Melted butter will never get you a "crisp" topping, it will give you a  "crumble" topping instead.  I also added a few shreds of butter to the top of the final "crisp" crust.  My crust was "crispy" and golden brown.  The BEST CRISP I've ever had!!!!!!!

This really did turn out great, thanks to some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  I cut the water to about 1/8 cup of water and added 1/8 cup of lemon juice to the apples.  Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg as well.  Also, as ALLY99 suggested, do not melt the butter for the crumble.  Instead, let the butter come to room temperature  and just work it in with the other dry ingredients using a fork until the mixture looks crumbly.  You also need to DOUBLE the topping recipe...it may seem like too much, but it comes out just right.

AWESOME!  I used 8 Granny Smith apples, approx 4 1/2 pounds.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers: I stirred the sugar mixture in the apples and let sit for approximately 1/2 an hour.  I also doubled the crisp recipe and lay some (about a 1/3 of mixture) on the bottom and the rest on the top.   Additions: 2 T. of lemon juice and 2T. of vanilla, 1/2 t nutmeg, and decreased water to 1/4c.  I increased baking time to an hour, as I like the top to have a bit more crunch.  Great recipe!

So incredibly good. The only thing you shouldn't do is line the apples neatly in the pan, because it blocks the steam from cooking them (I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I ended up with a not-as-cooked-as-I-would-have-liked dessert), so just toss them in the dish.

My husband LOVED this! Said is was "almost as good as grandma's, which is truly a compliment! The thinner the apple slices the better...I like it to be quite soft on the bottom. The 1/4C. of water suggestion was really helpful. I halfed the white sugar and it was great. Could have bee because I used Gala apples which are pretty sweet as is. Great recipe, going into the family favourites recipe book!

Taste was good. I omitted the water with the apples like others suggested, but thought it was a little too dry. It tasted perfect with ice cream, but I will add 1/4c water next time.

Received rave reviews from several people for this dessert tonight ... three people asked for the recipe!  It really was excellent.

I doubled the topping to make a bottom layer.  I also decreased the white sugar amount by half, and only added about three tablespoons of water.  It did not need any more water than that.  I also did add about a half teaspoon of nutmeg, which I think was a nice added something to the recipe.

A definite keeper that I will make again and again.

The additional water is completely unnecessary!  The finished product was beautiful but when we served it, it was a bit watery!  Next time, I will let the natural juice stand on its own.  The "crisp" is yummy though!

This was just what I was craving! :)  I didn't really read many of the reviews before I started baking but I would agree that you could cut back on the sugar and add more cinnamon.  I used granny smith apples and it turned out wonderfully! Overall, it's excellent!

This is amazing! I have made this twice and both times it was loved.  I took the suggestions and cut the water to 1/4 cup and added nutmeg to the apples.  I used 5 granny smith apples and increased the crust ingredients so that I could have some on the top and some on the bottom.  Also, the second time I made this, I cut the butter into the flour instead of melting it, to provide a crumblier texture.  Both times I received the crumble appearance and crunch but with the butter cut in, the texture was looser vs. crust-like with the melted version.  Both ways are good, just a matter of preference! In addition, adding blueberries and/or nuts to the apples just adds an extra delicious touch.

This is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten!  It was simple to make too.  I did do as others suggested and instead of sprinkling the sugar and cinnamon on the apples, I mixed it all together with the apples before putting them in the dish. I used a 9x9x2 pan since I halved  the amount of apples. I used 5 medium granny smith apples and left all the topping amounts the same(we love crunchy topping).  I only added 1 Tbs of water and that was plenty.  You get the natural juices from the apples. I cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 and it came out fantastic. We served this warm out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream!  All I can say is YUM!!!  I will definitely e making this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I needed a good recipe to use up the bag of apples that my family wouldn't eat (got an off-brand when it as on sale and didn't go over well!). The apples themselves were a little too sweet for all the sugar that was called for, but the crust--WOW.  SO good!  I want to make this again!  I served it with vanilla ice cream and caramel topping.

This is definitely VERY tasty. However..do NOT add water. I also do not agree with making the topping for both top and bottom. Way too much, and way too sweet. I used Granny Smith apples, and will again. I did mix the apples with the sugar, cinnamon, and I also used nutmeg. I believe however, that you really do not need a cup of sugar, so I will cut that down next time to maybe 2/3. You have enough brown sugar in this recipe to help sweeten things up. I did let the apples soak in the mixture for about 10 minutes, then layered with the rest.

Amazing.  I took other reviewer's advice by doubling the topping recipe.  I then layered the sugar/oat/flour mixture on the bottom, placed the apples on top, and sprinkled the sugar mixture. THEN I drizzled a little bit of carmel apple dip on top before adding the top layer of crumble.  Rave reviews.  I will make this again very soon!

This is my all time favorite recipe for apple crisp. It is simply the best!! I can't tell you how many times I've had to print out the recipe for friends after they tried it!! Now, whenever I take it to a gathering, I've learned to make copies of the recipe ahead of time because I know people are going to ask me for it!
Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Please, make double the crust; you won't be dissapointed.  And like many of the other reviews said, add either half of the water or none at all.  I added just a bit of water and it turned out perfect. I added some nutmeg and more cinnamon than what's called for.  I also wasn't too careful about the 10 cups of apples.  I know I added alot more and it shouldn't make much difference if you don't measure the apples just so.   Serve with ice cream ... Breyers light vanilla ice cream is great stuff!

wonderful wonderful wonderful! The only thing I had to change was to reduce the sugar to half the recommended amounts in the topping and hardly anything to the filling; plus with the cinnamon (doubled the amount!) it didnt seem to need any extra sweetening.  I agree that adding pecans to the top (and filling) made it extra delightful.  HAS TO be served with cream or icecream!

used 8/8 pan with 4 apples and left everything else the same, but bake for 1 hr (throw it in just before you serve dinner.)  Must use water to create caramel sauce.  This recipe is fail proof!

It had great potential, but it was WAY too sweet for me.  I should have read the reviews before trying it out - then I would have known to use MUCH less sugar.  I'll try it again just because I can see that it would have been really delicious if I wasn't choking on how sugary it was.

The first time I made according to the recipe.  It was way way WAY too sweet.

I cut sugar in half as was suggested.  It was still quite sweet.  I also added 1/2 cup oc chopped walnuts and used smart balance butter spread in place of butter.

It was excellent with the modifications.

Original ** with less suger *****

This recipe has potential just needing a little tweaking.
I would use 1/4 flour in the apples, two Tbls of cinnamon, no water, and a dash of nutmeg. Underneath the topping in my crisp there were apples floating in LOTS of liquid. 2) Continue to double the topping, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of salt. Make extra topping which is the best part! Other than really good.

It hardly seems fair that a dessert so easy to make can be this good. I took the advice of many others and doubled the topping. I used Splenda in place of sugar and used Fat Free I Can't Believe It's Not Butter in place of the butter for the topping. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and added apple pie spice as well. 

I think it is the best still slightly warm and served with vanilla custard ice cream. MmMmMmM!

Had a half bushel of Honey Crisp apples and this was a great way to use some of them.  Like some of the others - No water, double the toppings, reduced the sugars.  Tasted great with ice cream.  Anyone know how to incorporate chocolate or caramel into it?

I made this for my boyfriend (I don't particularly like cooked apples) and we ate every bite of it in two days.  I made an 8x8 version with 5 large Granny Smith apples.  As others have suggested, I only used 1/3 cup of white sugar in the mixture that goes on top of the apples, and I eliminated the water. I made the amount of topping in the original recipe and had some left over. The texture was perfect, and the flavor was absoulutely delicious!  I think the Granny Smith apples were just right for this dish- they created a fantastic tart/sweet combination.   Wonderful!

I love the crisp topping-I use less sugar and double the recipe.  This topping is great on all fruit crisps!  Especially love it on strawberry/rhubarb! I,like other reviewers, do not add the water, I find the fruit has enough natural juice in it.  Great recipe-thanks for sharing!

Absolutely perfect!  I made this and my husband, my two children and myself ate this all within 24 hours. I have been looking for a good Apple Crisp recipe for a long time and this is the best one ever. So very easy to make; all I had to buy was the apples, I had everything else on hand. My family thanks you (I have already passed this out a number of times)

I was told by family and friends that this was the best Apple Crisp they ever had.  I made a little bit more of the topping and that made it even better!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Ok, it takes quite a bit to get me to give something 5 stars.  This is it!  This will be my apple crisp recipe forever!  Then I'll pass it on to my two daughters!  I did make a couple of adjustments based on the reviews (which I LOVE).  I cut the brown sugar in the topping to 3/4 C and I omitted the water and used a squeeze of lemon juice over the apples.  It was terrific!  Thanks!

It is good, but watery?? I was hoping it would thicken up as it cooled, but no such luck.  I followed the recipe, although only used about 8 cups of apples. I guess next time I would not add as much water.  The flavor is good though.

Easy and delicious.  I also reduced the sugar.  I was using a sweeter apple (not sure of the name) so I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  This is a great recipe!  I made it twice in 3 days... have to get rid of all those apples growing in my backyard and this is a great way to do that!  :)

I was a little dissapointed after all the good reviews. it was ok. the icecream is very necessary for it to be good. i'd atleast half the apples for one family to eat. i have a ton of leftovers. i cut back on the sugar like everyone said. if your crazy about apples i'd try it but if not i wouldnt bother.

this recipe was absolutely delicious! i loved it. it was very easy to make, and very tasty warmed up with some vanilla ice cream. unfortunately, after about a week, the topping gets soggy, but it will probably disappear long before that! it would be great for a dinner party. (i used 6 large granny smith apples, which turned out to be about 8 cups. the 8 cups filled my 9x13 pan completely. if you put ten cups in, be sure to put a cookie sheet underneathe the pan when you bake it, or it will probably drip in your oven.

I prepared this recipe with Granny Smith apples and it was wonderful.  I took a pan to a 4th of July cookout and everyone enjoyed it. It took awhile to cut the apples but it's well worth the effort.

I just made this and it's pretty good, but the water made it kinda runny. I'd go with 1/4 cup or maybe just a little apple juice and no sugar. I used red apples and it is a little too sweet for me too. I think with granny smith and less water it would be perfect! I love the crunchy crust!

Way too much sugar in this recipe and not enough cinnamon.  Next time, I will cut the sugar in half (at least) and double the cinnamon.

This turned out great!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because it does need some tweaking.  The water is definitely unnecessary because it's almost too runny just from the water baked from the apples.  The half brown/white sugar is a great edit, too.  I made the apples and crumble mixture ahead of time and refrigerated both until it was time for dessert.  I then sprinkled the crumble on top and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes.  It is wonderful served with vanilla ice cream and caramel!

I've made this a few times, and it works GREAT! 

I just made a couple changes to the Apple part. I skipped the water completely, and I altered the apple seasoning a bit. Instead of just Cinnamon, I opted for a mulling spice mix (Cinnamon, Allspice, Nutmeg, and Cloves) and I love the result. I also use about 1.5-2 Tablespoons instead of just a teaspoon. I used a hand coffee grinder to pull out the fresh-ground flavors a bit more, but, I'm sure that pre-ground would work fine as well.

Overall, love this one!!

This apple crisp is soooo delicious! I've made the recipe both as written and with a few modifications. As written, it's still really good but just a few minor changes really perfect the recipe. First, I add 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture. I also mix the apples (I use 6-7 large Granny Smiths) with the cinnamon sugar mixture rather than pouring on top. I only add 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2, which adds just the right amount of moisture. For the crumb topping, I add just a small pinch (1/8 teaspoon) salt, and I cut cold diced butter into the crumb topping rather than melted butter. This yields a more "crumbly" topping. Baking for 45 minutes has worked perfectly for me. This apple crisp is so good that my fiancé ate through almost the whole batch himself within 2 days (and that was with a little self control haha), and begged me to make it again that same week! It's AMAZING!!! :)

Delicious!! Ok people ,, those of you who rate recipes with 5 stars and change the recipe in a number of ways.   Does not make sense. So I am giving it the most delicious Apple crisp I have ever made and I didn't change a thing.

The flavor was good but the apples were too mushy for our taste.  Next time I won't add water.  I also cut them very thin so I will slice thicker.  I doubled the topping but it was a tad too much so I think 1.5 the amount of topping would be perfect.  Also added a dash of nutmeg for our taste.  Great start just need to modify the mushiness.

This is so delicious, it's unreal. honestly. You need to make this. I decided to leave out the water because I prefer it on the thick/hearty side and used less apples (because I only had a small dish) - but other than that, followed the recipe exactly and my man and I were in a surreal apple crisp heaven!! I want to eat this every single day. Forever and ever. It's probably the best dessert I've ever had, and I'm the kind of girl who would pretty much always choose dessert over dinner, so that's saying something! ;)

I loved this recipe. It was my first time ever making any kind of crisp and it turned out to be so delicious. My only issue was that I didn't know how many apples equaled 10 cups, so I went out and bought 8 apples. Well after I had peeled and sliced all of them, I realized not all would fit in the 9x13 pan. I ended up wasting a few apples, but now I know. I followed other reviewers' advice about using Granny Smith apples, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly how it says. I will be making this for my family so I can show off what a great cook I am now, even though this recipe is extremely easy, but they don't need to know that.

This recipe is great! I give this 10 stars if there were that many.  This is so....easy and so.....good.  I definitely recommend you make this and you will see and taste how good it is.  Easier than making a pie.  Believe me, it will not last very long at all. I used yellow delicious that was given to me.

It's absolutely delicious. I am constantly getting compliments when I make it. The only thing I changed was based on personal taste. I changed the type of Apple and my dad accidentally cut the apples in cubes but we ended up liking it better that way.

LOVE THIS Recipe!!!  I did not have any raw rolled oats and was forced to try instant oat meal. After the allotted baking time I discovered it was not even close to being done so I added milk cinnamon and sugar slowly over the next 2 additional hours at a low temp of 135 in the oven! I have now purchased raw oats and can't wait to make it again

This was really easy to make and it tasted awesome. I didn't change the recipe, but I did add 1Tsp (teaspoon) of cardamom. It smelled wonderful while it cooked and the Cardamom added a lovely warm note to this dish. I also used three different types of apples to give it some variety. Really great recipe!

Let me add my 2 cents to these reviews.  Awesome!  I made this for a recent get together at my house and people just loved it.  Thank you for the recipe!  I did use a gallon bag and mixed the apples with the spices.  I also doubled the topping and put some on the bottom of the pan.  Added a small amount of nutmeg.  All of these were suggestions made by others.  Oh, I also cut the white sugar to a 1/2 cup.  Perfect.

Best Apple Crisp! But it makes a lot. Maybe cut the recipe in half if you're only making for a few people. Ice cream is a must!

I found this to be WAY too sweet.  The sugar overpowered everything, especially once it cooled off.  If I try this recipe again, I'd cut down on both the white sugar and brown sugar.  I also added a bit of vanilla, which was nice.

Tried this last night with great success! Absolutely delicious! I need look no further for an apple crisp recipe. In the past, I could never get a topping that was truely crumbly but a tip from one of the reviewers really helped: After adding the melted butter (real butter please)lightly press the mixture down into the bowl and refrigerate for 30m and then break it up with a fork before crumbling evenly over the apple mixture.

This is the best apple crisp ever! Very easy, and came out perfect! I will say though I did not add the water. I simply slices the apples
(8 granny smiths, and 2 fuji's) and let them rest in a bowl for 10 mins. Letting the juice run off and that substituted for the water. It turned out so yummy and I don't see any point in using the water. 
I look forward to making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe yesterday for a family get together. AWESOME! It was easy to make and my family gobbled it up! I did follow some of the suggestions and did not add any water. The apples had enough "juice". I did let the apples sit for about 30 mins or so with the filling ingredients mixed in rather than sprinkled on top. This let the juice come out of the apples a little to create the liquid. I also doubled the topping and added chopped pecans. I also was not stingy on the cinnamon! I'm going to make this for one of my Thanksgiving desserts as well!

I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving out the water and adding nutmeg to the sugar and cinnamon.  This was very good! I made this early in the day and pulled it out to bake while I was cooking dinner.  The top was crisp and the apples were sweet-tart and soft.  I think I sliced some of the apples too thin, they came out like applesauce.  Next time I will make bigger chunks of apple... but otherwise this recipe is a keeper.

I followed the reviews and made 1 1/2 crisp topping.  Also added salt to the crisp mix.  And 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to apples.  Delicious!!!

The apple crisp is super delicious and we all loved it.  My daughter wants me to make it everyday.  The one thing I did different is after I sprinkled the sugar mixture on the apples I mix the apples so they all get coated. Thanks for sharing!

Crisp was runny, did not need water.  Also less flour and more oats would improve texture and taste.

Simply delicious. This is so easy and yummy. Only thing to change is don't even bother adding the water. Other than this, it is perfect. Will make this again and again.

This is the best apple crisp recipe that I have ever used. I followed the advice of some of the cooks on this site by putting only half the amount of water recommended and the consistency was perfect. Everything else was done exactly as stated in the recipe. I am a fan of Pampered Chef stoneware and I baked my apple crisp in my 10x13 pan for even heating and browning. I also posted this recipe on Facebook and send a copy to my step daughter.

Yum!  Made this this a.m. and it's gone already!  Loved it, loved it, loved it!  I did go half and half on the fruit, I used rhubarb my neighbor gave me and apples.  Other than that I did some minimal changes per the reviews I'd read. 
1.  I doubled the topping and put it in the bottom of the pan and the rest on top of the fruit mixture.
2.  I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsps.
3.  I also added Cardamon spice, since I was out of fresh nutmeg - and boy was I glad I did - NUM!
4.  I crumbled the butter into the topping instead of melting & pouring on top.  - I liked the results BUT - that meant that some of the mixture on top remained/looked dry and unbaked.   I sprayed oil olive oil on top when almost done - that helped... but I think I'll consider melting the butter the next time as per the recipe.
I don't think I changed the recipe too much and when I did, it was just due to our family's preference.   I know for sure that made exactly as the recipe was written that we would have enjoyed it just as much - Thanks, Chef!!

Oh my goodness!  This was so good!  I just made it and almost burned my face off eating it because I couldn't wait for it to cool!  I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the topping mixture.  The water in the recipe made a yummy caramel like sauce because i greased the pan liberally with butter.  Make this.  And watch those faces because you wont be able to wait for it to cool past the volcanic stage!!!!!!!

This was SO GOOD!  I am usually not a big apple pie/crumble fan, but this was amazing!  I had a bunch of apples that I had to use up - an assortment of red delish, pink ladies, galas.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and tossed that with the cinnamon and 1 T of flour and a squeeze of lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.  I let that sit for about 15 min, and when I was ready to use I did not need to add any water. I doubled the oat crumble mixture (used a little more cinnamon and a couple of dashes of nutmeg) and put 1/2 on the bottom and the other 1/2 on the top.  I also added 1/2 cup of sliced raw almonds to the top and mixed that with the crumble. Served it with vanilla ice cream.  It was amazing!  Our tummies are happy tonight. :)

Easy and delicious.  I did cut the sugar just a little bit and it was just right with a blend of sweet and slightly tart apples; all a matter of personal taste.  Mixed the flour/sugar with the apples and didn't add any water as our apples were very juicy.

This recipe is GREAT!!  Everyone loved it!  I used apples from our tree which are sweet so I added only 2 tbs of white sugar instead of 1 cup and it was perfect.  Everything else I made as the recipe called for, even the 1 cup of brown sugar for the topping.  Right out of the oven, it was runny on the bottom but after letting it sit until it cooled down, the water soaked in and was not runny at all. This is the apple crisp recipe I will use from now on.

I unfortunately read the reviews that talked about doubling the topping. Heavens, no! It was topping overkill. Do it as written; do NOT double the topping unless you want to eat only topping. Isn't the point to taste the apples?

MMM-MMM! I used 5 Granny Smith's and 3 Pink Ladies (I think). I did 1.5 times the crust. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the crust ingredients and cut in my cold butter, rather then melting it. (My husband is eating his right now and all I'm hearing is "MMMM".) I tossed my cut up apples with the cinnamon sugar mixture, to which I had added a little bit of nutmeg. I layered about 1/3 of the crust mixture in the pan and then put in my apples with about 1/4 cup of water. Then I topped with the rest of the crust. Baked it according to the recipe. When I served it, I topped it with some warmed caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. Man, writing this makes me want to go get another bowl of it!!! Awesome recipe!

Used 1/4 c. of water and added some freshly ground nutmeg to the apples. Left out the baking soda and baking powder, increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups and used 1 cup of melted butter. I know...not exactly low calorie but it's dessert, might as well go all out!!!

If I make this again I WILL NOT double the topping. I listened to the reviews and doubled the topping and it was TOO MUCH. I did leave the water out and would do that again. I don't think water is needed. Also I would reduce the sugar to 1/2 C...it was too sweet for me. But overall was a good recipe.

I have been making apple crisp for 7 years based on my mother-in-law's great recipe.  In our last move, I lost the recipe (and suffer from a terrible memory).  I searched for a version similar to hers, but when I saw this recipe I decided I would try this instead.  My husband said this was the best apple crisp I had ever made.  

Personally, I loved the melted butter idea instead of cutting cold butter in like I used to do.  I also put it in an (roughly) 8x8 baking pan so the apples were thick.  That also made the topping thick, almost like a crust, but I loved that.  I don't usually eat apple crisp either.  

I didn't add any water, just added juice from a lime since the apples were browning very quickly and that's all I had on hand.  We used Jonathan apples (about 8 medium sized) because that's what we picked last week.  I cut the apples thick so they wouldn't turn to mush.  We used about 1 tsp Pumpkin pie spice in the oatmeal topping because my 3 year old wanted to add it (really, no other reason than that, haha).  It was juicy and the apples were cooked to perfection (about 45 min baking time).  The topping was crunchy and perfect.  Thank you!!!

This was seriously THE most amazing crisp I have ever had.  When I read the ingredient list I thought it would be your pretty standard crisp, but this makes a caramelized "sauce" in the apple layer that is to DIE for.

This was sooo delicious. I used 6 cups of apples and it still made quite a lot. I also used Royal Gala apples and they came out fantastic, they still had enough crunch to them when they came out..just the right amount! I used a bit less white sugar on them, and also tossed them with nutmeg added to the mixture. The crumble came out perfect too, also just crunchy enough. I only had normal oats, not quick-cooking ones, and those were fine. I also doubled the amount of crumble, which seemed to give just the right amount.

I didnt actually have the oats on hand, so I used the same measurement of oatmeal cookie mix (Betty Crocker) and it is AMAZING!!!! Absolutely delicious!! I also cut the water to 1/4 cup and it made a nice thick sauce that was great over icecream!! Thanks for posting such a great recipe!!!

Great taste, Not too sweet. I did not have any oats but I did have Oat Bran flakes. The finer texture of the Oat Bran worked out great.

I made this recipe for a Mother's Day picnic and it was a hit.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the topping recipe, eliminated the water, and cut the sugar in half.  It was so good I have another pan in the oven to have for today.  Try this recipe and you won't be disappointed!!

It was my first time making an apple crisp...and this recipe was delicious...especially served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! I took some of the suggestions that other reviewers made such as reducing the sugar in the apple mix to 1/2 cup, adding ground nutmeg, doubling the topping recipe and adding chopped walnuts to the topping. Highly recommended!!

Delicious.  
I added blackberries and because they get really juicy when baked, I increased the flour to 2 tbsp.

Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a big hit and I will be making this again without a doubt.

First time making apple crisp and this recipe was really good. Next time I would also cut the water in half as there was alot of fluid in bottom upon serving.  Thank you.

Wow,wow, and more wow! I made dessert for two so I used a pie pan instead of the recommended dish. I used the suggested amounts for the crust, which perfectly doubled the amount allowing for a top and BOTTOM crust. I had the nerve to add pecans and walnuts! Three apples worked perfectly and I halfed the ingredients for sprinkling over the apples. I omitted the water and used butter. Deeeeeeelish!

Delicious!  I did make some changes to fit in with my diet such as I used almond flour in place of the flour and I used Stevia in place of the sugar (just used about 6 TBSP, but I also made the recipe for only 6 people).  I also added some Craisins and nutmeg, doubled the "crisp" portion, and cut the water in half like others recommended.  Turned out great!

This was such a simple recipe that turned out AMAZING!! I used Splenda products in place of the sugar and brown sugar and neither me nor the family members who ate this at Christmas dinner could tell that it was sugar free! Next time, I will add more oats, as I like the texture. Otherwise - Perfect recipe!

This recipe was just ok.  I always like to try and stick to the original the first time I make somthing (unless reviews are consistently pointing out one mistake).  I should have listened to those who decreased the water.  The apples were way too soggy for my liking.  The topping was not oaty enough and it it was overly sweet.  I will keep the recipe though as it it a good jumping off point to alter.

Not too bad, but I found even after cutting back the sugar to half cup, it was still too sweet for me.  It definitely paired well with vanilla ice cream and that helped to mellow out the sweetness too!

Love this apple crisp recipe! Have made it twice now and it was a hit both times. I use 6 green golden delicious apples and the flavor is wonderful. I will probably experiment with different flavored apples in the future.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is due to others' reviews I modified this recipe by doubling the topping and adding nutmeg as suggested. I also put a thin layer of the topping in the bottom of the pan before adding the apples. I also cut in the butter rather than using it melted. The topping was very firm, but not hard. Just right! This made the most wonderful dessert and it is going into the permanent file!

good recipe.  My apples happened to be a little dry(been sitting around a while,) but since I had some apple cider in the fridge, I added some to the apples before baking to sort of reconstitute them.

In the apples I used 1/2c brown sugar, and 1/4 cup sugar, heaping t. of cinnamon, and dash of nutmeg.  Also, apple juice instead of water.
The top I used 1 1/2 cups each flour and oatmeal, heaping cup of brown sugar and 1/4 plus 1/8 each soda and baking powder...EXCELLENT!!

Yum, yum, YUM!  I had a ton of apples left from our trip to the u-pick orchard, so instead of water, I put two apples into the juicer and poured that over the apples.  I also cut the sugar in half and used sweeter apples, and it turned out just divine!

I reduced the sugar per other comments and this was still so overly sweet that it was inedible.  We scraped off all of the topping and mixed the apples in with unsweetened apples to salvage this.

Great recipe--it turned out perfect!  I cut the recipe in half, using 3 very large Granny Smith apples.  I also omitted the water (per other reviews), cut the white sugar in half, and used slightly less than 1/2 cup of flour in the topping, with 5 Tbsp cold butter cut into the mixture, instead of melting it.  I used a 8 x 6 inch glass baking dish and added on about 7 minutes of cooking time, as it wasn't golden brown when the 45 minutes of baking was up.  The apples were fork-tender, not mushy and the crust was cripsy, giving it the perfect contrast in texture.

Awesome!! Followed reviewer's advice and cut in cold butter instead of melting it for the crust, which was lovely -- definitely gives it the texture you're looking for in a crisp. I also doubled the crust, putting apple layer in between, which is yummy but also very very rich, so it's probably not for everyone. It's a little much for me, and I love rich stuff! The only change I think is important to the recipe is the cold butter, but I'm sure it's delicious no matter what. :)

YUM! That's all I have to say. I didn't make any adjustments at all - it was perfect just as described in the recipe. This is MUCH better the day you bake it, the crust starts to get soggy if it sits too long - best to eat it all right away.

First time making Apple Crisp and it was delicious!! I used 5 Honey Crisp apples and put it in an 8 x 8. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tbsp of water. It was amazing!! The topping is the best part. Yum!

Really great! Used 5 Granny Smith apples, and the whole recipe didn't take long at all, for a very delicious outcome. The whole house smelled wonderful. Followed the recipe as shown, just added a little nutmeg into the apple topping. Also, it seems a tad bit watery to me, but my boyfriend says it's fine to him, so it's just a matter of preference. Delicious recipe though!

This is the best apple crisp I've ever made.  It is easy and tastes great! I only had about 7 cups of apples and I did not add any water.  It turned out great!  I am very pleased and I will definitely be making this recipe again.

OH MY!!! Apple crisp is my ALL TIME FAVORITE dessert ever and after years of searching for just the right recipe to make at home, THIS IS IT! I made it in a 9x9 pan with 1/2 the apple mixture, using 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar. I used the full crust mixture as suggested by other reviewers. Definitely need to use Granny smith or other tart firm apples as the mixture is plenty sweet. Also did not use the water. Unfortunately the only thing I was missing was some good quality vanilla ice cream to melt on top! I just might have to go out and buy some to go with my second (and maybe 3rd!) serving!

Even with my healthy changes, this dessert was a hit!  I used Splenda in place of the white sugar and whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose.  No one was the wiser. ;)  Might benefit from extra apples.

Very good apple crisp recipe! The topping is nice and crisp. I used 12 small/medium apples and used only 2/3 cup of the white sugar called for, and it tasted great!
I've actually used the recipe for this topping to fix some of my other recipes that haven't turned out good. This is a go-to recipe for sure!

This is fabulous!  I followed a couple of the other reviews and added nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup water.  I also used about 12 cups of apples and doubled the crumble part (it's my favorite part).  Also used softened butter and cut it in like you would with pastry instead of the melted butter.  Turned out great!

I made this recipe using local apples (Cortland variety) and brought it to work. It was gone by the end of the day so I guess it was good. I just thought a cup of sugar was way too much for the apple mix so I added maybe 1/4 cup, and I added a tsp of nutmeg which was probably too much. The topping was good but didn't really crisp up even though I left it in the oven for 20 minutes longer at 375 degrees. But overall it was good.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to double the crust recipe. It turned out great! I used Granny Smith apples and it had the perfect combination of tart and sweet. Love it and will definitely make again and again!

This was truly amazing. I found it to be a bit watery when all was said and done, but I just drained the water and no harm done! Highly recommend it.

This apple crisp is delicious. My version didn't look as pretty as the above picture, but with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - who cares?!. I have never been successful at making apple pies, so I'm glad there are easy apple crisp recipes like this to make me look like a hero to my family. Thanks Diane!

Double the crust - but only 50% more on the butter instead of double.

I didn't care for this.  WAY too sweet for my taste (I did use red apples, but I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup white and brown). It also left a lot of liquid behind.  I don't think the water is necessary.

This is great! Don't add the water, and if you use anything other than granny smith apples, forget the white sugar completely. I cut the recipe in half to make 6 servings in a smaller pan, so I only cut the topping down by 1/4. Everyone loved it!

I cut this recipe down to 4 servings and it came out great!  I used 4 ramekins and instead of sprinkling the sugar, flour, and cinnamon over the apples in each ramekin, I mixed it together with the apples first.  Then I put about 1/2 TBSP of water into each ramekin before putting the crisp on top.  Baked for 35 minutes and they came out PERFECTLY.  My new recipe for any type of crisp.  Thanks!

Very good recipie....I made this today for a pot luck & it was gobbled up very quickly.  I made just a few changes per recomendations of previous reviews & was very happy with the results.    Instead of using a whole cup of sugar I used 2/3 c, and did not use water as the apples will release juices anyways & I DOUBLED the entire crisp topping (kept the apple bottom mixture same)- glad I did.  I got so many complements on this and that is a rare thing for my cooking!!  It came out crisp, buttery & yummy- it was so rick I served it with cool whip- ice cream would have been way too heavy, the cool whip was creamy but light- a nice complement.

This was so good, my husband and I Loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't find it watery at all.  The water mixed in with the sugar while it baked and turned caramel-y.  Delicious and it smelled so good while it was baking!!!  Will definitely make again:)

Yummy!  I used sour apples and it needed the full amount of sugar, in my opinion.  I put half the amount of water in and it didn't really need it.  Don't think I would change anything else--it was great!

WONDERFUL!  I made additional topping (because I am excessive!) and it was AMAZING.  I will never look for another recipe!  I topped it with homemade vanilla whipped cream with was a great compliment.  If your wondering: I filled up the large magic bullet container (which will whip cream in 15 sec GUARANTEED!!!) with heavy whipping cream, added a couple of Tbsp powdered sugar and a splash or vanilla and whipped it up. It was great!  Husband loved it!

Very, very, very delicious. This was my first ever crisp/crumble and it was so good. I took the advice of another and added pecans to the topping and it is now an irresistible treat! I also doubled the topping for a 9x12 but personally found it to be way too much. It was twice as much topping to apple and I didn't even use it all. That aside it is lovely and will be made again and again and again.....

AWESOME!!!  Very adaptable for those going organic too.  I used organic apples, organic sugar, whole wheat flour, and all natural oats.  I've made this several times and it's a hit with everyone!  Like other reviews, I doubled the cinnamon, added nutmet and doubled the topping.

This is the recipe I'll always use from now on.  I decreased the water to 1/4 cup and added 1 cup chopped pecans because I had them on hand - with or without them, it's a delicious Apple Crisp.  I served it warm with with vanilla bean ice cream ala' mode - scrumptious!!!!

This was delicious, but the water made it far runnier than I've ever eaten a 'crisp'.  Next time I will definitely leave that out.

This is an excellent recipe and will definitely use it again.  The only changes I made were, 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a full cup, and used old fashioned oatmeal because that's what I had.  Absolutely delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving and whoa that's a lot of sugar! I like the juxtaposition of sweet and tart, so this time I cut the white sugar in half and increased the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp. Much better! And with 1 stick of vegan Earth Balance instead of butter and whole wheat flour, it's a wee bit healther. Not much, a little.

I needed a last minute recipe for Thanksgiving desert and I always order Apple Crisp when they have it at restaurants. This came out absolutely perfect, follow the recipe exactly EXCEPT A FEW THINGS : 1.Add a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmug to the cinnamon mixture. 2.Coat the apples in the cinnamon mixture and then put them in the baking dish, then you don't need to add any water and I promise its perfectly moist. 3. Double the topping mixture  I promise if you follow this it is absolutely restaurant quality.

Everybody is giving this 5 stars but nobody is making it according to the recipe, how can you give something a top rating when you've altered it? The first time I made this it was bland and watery with not enough "crisp" topping so the recipe as written gets only 3 stars from me. The second time I made this it turned out REALLY good!  I omitted the water, decreased the white sugar by 1/2 and added nutmeg, allspice and clove along with the cinnamon in the apple mixture. I made almost double the amount of topping. In the end it was fantastic when I served with vanilla ice cream.

This makes the best apple crisp I've ever had! I doubled the crust recipe though, because I like more crust. Two suggestions: I cut the butter into the crust and sprinkled chopped pecans onto the top. The toasted pecan taste really adds to the overall taste of the crisp. Also, if you mix the apples with the sugar/cinnamon before you put it in the pan, no water is necessary.

Perfect.  The only thing I did differently was to soak my apples in a bowl with water and a little lemon juice, to prevent browning while I chopped the remaining apples.  When done chopping, I just drained the water out, mixed it with the sugar and cinnamon/nutmeg, and dumped it into the baking dish.  With this extra moisture, I didn't need to add any water, and the resulting sauce was heavenly!  Served warm with a scoop of ice cream, YUM.  So easy, and my husband said (twice!) it was better than any restaurant. :)

this is an excellent recipe! A couple things to mention though... I used probably about 1/4 cup of water and it still ended up pretty watery when it came out, so water is probably not needed. I added more cinnamon and mixed the apples in the mixture instead of just sprinkling it over. And for the crumble part, I used margarine instead of butter and it ended up being too much, so make sure to add a little bit at a time until it's crumbly. Otherwise, great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. The only modification I made was to add a bit of nutmeg and ground cloves to the topping with a bit more cinnamon. We were only 5 people, but we finished this off. It was fantastic. I used fresh from the orchard Cortland apples and fresh ground cinnamon. I have never added water to a crisp before, but it was just right. The sauce was really nice. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this as written, to begin with.  I used 6 Granny Smith apples to make up the 10 cups, sliced fairly thickly.    I found the water to make too much juice.  Next time I'd halve it or omit it altogether.    After I'd made everything, I found there wasn't quite enough topping to make a respectable apple crisp, so I whipped up another batch of topping.    Also, even though I used Granny Smiths, I found the recipe too sweet.  Perhaps this was due to the doubled crisp topping.  If you are going to double the topping, consider halving the white sugar in the apple mix.    Finally, even though I sliced my apples fairly thickly, they still came out very soft after 45 minutes.  I like a little bite to my crisp, so next time won't cook it so long.    It's a tasty recipe - just play around with it.  A little extra cinnamon, perhaps some cloves or nutmeg...

OMG! This is amazing.  I followed most other reviews and doubled the topping.  I also added 1/2tsp of nutmeg to the apples.  I didn't add any water because my apples slices had been sitting in water with lemon juice while dinner was cooking and the water left on the apples after draining was plenty.  I will be making this on a regular basis.

Fantastic recipe! I had never made apple crisp before, and this recipe was very easy to follow and replicate. I halved the recipe (except for the topping) and made it in an 8x8. I left out the water, and it was not at all dry. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing apple crisp recipe.

I made this as directed but lessened the white sugar to half a cup. It was still delicious and very sweet! I think next time I'll also halve the brown sugar. Some reviews recommended doubling the topping. I did not find this neccessary at all, there was plenty of topping! It tastes like a combination of warm apple pie and sweet oatmeal cookies on top, delicious!

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I did what other had suggested, used only 1/2 cup of the white sugar and omitted the water.  Then I added a handful (literally) of extra oats for a bit more texture.  Came out perfect.  I used the Northern Spy apple.

Yum! Great apple crisp recipe. Nothing out of the ordinary though. I like the baking soda/powder that makes the "crisp" more than just a streusel like topping. I used just 1/4 cup of water, like suggested I think next time, I will probably use lemon juice instead of the water, just for a little lemon flavor that I like.

I made it for a local Fire Satation......all the men looooved it! It's a great crisp! Definitely cut the water down to 1/3 cup....was perfect.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added a dash of nutmeg.....made all the difference.  Also....if the crisp part is your favorite, like mine, double the dry recipe and use about 1/3 to line the bottom of the pan.....the rest on top.  I cut in the butter rather than using melted butter......seemed to give it a better texture. It was very crispy and just the right amount.  I used Granny Smith apples and they were the perfect compliment for the sweet crisp.  Was super delish and I will be making it again....soon!

I have made this a couple of times. It tastes wonderful. One time I tried cornstarch with the apples and the result was very soupy. So we stick exactly to the recipe now.

VERY Good.  Followed this recipe exactly... I used a variety of apples, not just "baking apples", and it seemed to work just fine.  Didn't add any water, but did coat the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and put in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the apples "marinate" a bit.  Would make this again!

This is some of the best apple crisp I've ever had! The only modifications I made was to coat the apples with the sugar mixture instead of sprinkling it on top and I used margarine instead of butter. I've also experimented a bit with the water. The first time I made it, I tried 1/4 cup based on the reviews on here. It was quite watery, but still delicious and it didn't ruin it or anything. This time I only added 1/8 cup, and it was still too runny. Next time, I'll just omit the water. Absolutely fabulous recipe- I used Granny Smith apples and they worked perfectly. Delicious!

Delicious...although I would cut the water down next time.  It got a bit runny, which doesn't look so appetizing.  The crumble topping was very sweet and tasty.  Bible study ladies liked it & I love that this makes a 9 x 13 size.  Enough to serve with plenty of leftovers!  Definitely the best warm and a la mode!
9/23/11 Made this again.  Eliminated the water completely & doubled the topping.  SO amazing...they were all asking for the recipe!

I recently made this for a dinner party I attended.  Everyone LOVED it and requested copies of the recipe.  I took the reviews and advice from previous users by doubling the crisp recipe and placed about 30% on the bottom and threw the rest on the top.  Added a 1/4 cup of water to the bottom and added nutmeg to the mixture.  I used by Pampered Chef apple slicer/corer which left the apples a decent size and perfect size to bake the whole way through and not be mushy as an end product.  The Best Ever!

Best apple crisp I've ever had!  This was my first time to make it too.  I made it almost like the recipe.  I used orange juice instead of water and doubled the topping.  Some people recommended less liquid for the sauce.  I would only use less liquid if you plan on reducing the amount of sugar since the sugar makes the sauce thicken.  Also would recommend mixing together the ingredients for the sauce before pouring over the apples.  I doubled the topping only because it's my favorite part.  The original amount is enough if you don't prefer more crunch.  I used granny smith apples and they were a little too tart for me.  Next time I will make it with mutsu apples from the orchard.

This recipe, as is, no modifications is a 5 star! This is absolutely the best apple crisp out there. (Better than any restaurant and better than your grandma's)! However, I have my own taste preferences and would like to note I have made this recipe quite a few times. The last time I made it I added some rhubarb (unsweetened) from the freezer isle at the store. I am always going to make it that way because it adds more nutritional value and I love that tart taste. Hands down DELICIOUS as is though! BY THE WAY, I have cut the sugar like others have suggested and it really depends on the apples that you use for it. If you are using sweet apples cutting the sugar is fine. However if you are using plain ol baking apples I would recommend to follow this recipe precisely and you won't go wrong here. Also do not add pumpkin pie or all spice or nutmeg, it makes the flavor spicy and way too aromatic for apple crisp!!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  I think it would be absolutely excellent without the water.  There is no need for water as the apple crisp was soupy even the next day.  Leave the water out and it will be great!

If your sweetness preference is like having coffee with 'regular' amount of sugar, this recipe will be too sweet for you.  So many people said to leave out the water so I did.  I used Granny Smith apples and let it cook 1 hr because it didnt look brown enough.  The texture and flavor was wonderful!  The oats really add a great crunch.  Will def. make again!

Made this tonight and as others have said, it was fabulous. I followed the recipe except after peeling and slicing my apples, I squeezed the juice of a whole lemon over them and tossed to coat; I added a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients to bring out the flavors and I omitted the water from the recipe. The natural juices from the apples and lemon lend enough liquid to the recipe to turn out sweet, crisp, and delicious. My search for an excellent apple crisp recipe is over!!

LOVED IT!  I halved the recipe the other night for my family of 4 and it was just enough and I even had a little late night snack.  It did seem a little runny, but after it set up for a few minutes it thickened up.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Really good basic apple crisp recipe.  I used a mixture of Macintosh and Granny Smith apples.  I tossed the apples together in a bowl with sugar, flour, cinnamon, a few dashes of nutmeg, and ONLY two tablespoons of water instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe called for.  I set the apples to the side while I mixed the crumble and they produced plenty of their own juice.  I did double the crumble top based on suggestions from other reviewers.  The apples were perfectly cooked and made just enough juice to have a nice thick syrup, but, not be too watery.  I served warm with french vanilla icecream and received a TON of compliments!  Thanks for the recipe!

I did the apple portion first, but instead of sprinkling the sugar mixture I dumped it in a bowl (minus the water) and tossed my cut-up apples in there as I went along.  This helped my apples to not brown.  After tossing it all together I let it sit to the side while I prepared the topping.  By the time everything was ready to go in the pan, the apples had combined with the sugar and created an awesome syrup, meaning I never needed to add water.  If you prefer a more liquid-like dish then add a few Tablespoons of water.  I also added nutmeg & cloves to both apples and topping and it was perfect!

This reminded me of "All you can eat buffet" apple crisp, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. My man loved it, but it was wayyyyy to sweet for me. I wouldn't make this again.

This was really easy and really good. The next time, I might cut back on the sugar just a tad...maybe 3/4 of a cup instead of a whole cup as it was just a little sweet but still really tasty. I used a 3 pound bag of Granny Smith apples. Will do this again for sure!

Perfect! I cut the amount of apples in half to make a 9 inch square pan but kept the same amount of topping as for 9x13 pan. This is a great classic recipe!

After reading many reviews, I left out the water, doubled the topping, added 1/4 t of nutmeg and tossed the apples with the sugar mixture. I will stick to the original amount of topping next time. The apples seemed to disappear under everything else. I didn't find the dish too sweet because I used granny smith apples. It took almost 3 lbs to get 10 cups worth.

Fantastic.  I have been looking for a great apple crisp recipe and have found it here.  Simple to make and was a great hit with the family.  As suggested by others I did not add the water. I also added vanilla to the apples and crumble.

Wonderfully delicious, however, you have to know your apples.  I used my home-grown green apples that are NOT tart, Nor are they sweet and my Apple Crisp turned out way too sweet,  I have since made this many times over with less sugar and substituted fresh squeezed lemon juice for the water, which I poured over the sliced apples in the pan and stirred by hand.  I only used 3/4 cup white sugar in the sugar cinnamon mixture and poured that on top of the apples after the step with the lemon juice.   This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Oh! What a treat. I scaled the recipe down because I didn't have all of the apples that the full recipe required. I did use the water (only 1/4c) and found it was perfectly moist. Top with vanilla icecream and its the perfect winter comofort food. PS-next time I will add fresh ginger.

I made this for a cookout a few weeks ago, and my friends are still talking about it, and asking when I'm going to make it again! It's great if you make it exactly by the recipe, which I did the first time, but I've actually made it several times and this last time I think it was perfect with these changes: I use 5 large granny smith apples (the green ones), sliced as thiny as possible, the thinner the better. A 1/2 cup sugar is plenty, and only a quarter cup of water is needed too, but still use all the flour and cinnamon. I also added a dash of nutmeg.
For the topping, I did double it once and I thought it was wayyyyy too much. Stick to the recipe on the topping and you'll be happy, but if you have a pastry blender, definitely use softened butter instead of melted and cut it into the other ingredients.

This was absolutely delicious! At first, I was a little hesitant before adding all that sugar. I didn't have to be though, as the crisp turned out to be perfect! I wouldn't alter this recipe at all. I give it five stars. Thanks for sharing!

WOW, what an excellent recipe!!  I did however use some of the suggestions I read in the other reviews. I did reduce the water in half and made double the topping.  I also used more cinnamon (1 tbsp instead of 1 tsp).  I read that some people preferred softened butter versus melted.  I went with the melted as stated in the recipe and I think its great!! I served it warm with some vanilla ice cream.  YUMMY!!!!  This is the best I have ever had!!

Fantastic! After peeling the apples I placed them in water with a few squirts of lemon juice to prevent browning. After draining and chopping them all up, I poured the sugar mix (with only about 3/4 cup sugar) over them in a bowl and shook it all up. I followed others' suggestions and added about a half tsp of nutmeg to the apple sugar mix. I left out the water since the apples were juicy. I let that mix sit while I made the topping (which I doubled and pressed about 1/3 of it onto the bottom of the pan). I cooked the whole thing for an hour. This recipe came our so amazing, my boyfriend and even my dad who's not too into sweets ate it up! This is definitely a keeper. We served it with vanilla ice cream, of course. :) Oh yes, and I cut in cold butter while blending the topping in the food processor instead of melting it.

This recipe was so easy and so yummy. I added 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 as some reviewers suggested. I doubled the topping and put half in pan, then added apples - sugar mixture and the rest of the topping. I used 2 honeycrisp apples, 2 figi apples and 2 granny smith apples because that is what I had. I baked it longer. This turned out Wonderful !!! My Husband Loved it - He said it was the Best he has ever had - I liked it with Ice cream - YUMMY !!!!!

It turned out great! I did not reduce the water, but I did double the topping as others suggested. And I cooked it close to an hour so the topping could brown. My only creative change: cinnamon roll instant oatmeal in place of the quick oats! I used 4 packs and it worked out beautifully in this recipe.

This was generally good, although it was way too sweet. Next time I will try it with 1/2 the amount of sugar. I used Cortland apples so they already had a bit of tart even. Also next, time I will double the apples because I felt there was too high of a topping to apples ratio.

I made  this recipe this past weekend to take to my parents for dinner.  It was delicious- everyone loved it.  The only thing I didnt do was add any nutmeg as some reviewers said to.  I also read one of the reviews said to double the crisp and lay some on the bottom and some on the top- I think that would make it better.  Also, it was delicious but not crispy, I'm not sure what to add to make it more crisp.

Yummy recipe.  Even better with whipped cream on top!  I used Granny Smith apples which were a little sour and tasted good to the adults but not so kid friendly.  Maybe a slight sweeter apple would work better for kids.

Absolutely Perfect as is!!! I can't believe people doubled the topping mixture - that would be way too much for me. I followed this recipe exactly and it is the best apple crisp I have ever made! Great recipe!

This is by far the best apple crisp I've ever made!  I ended up using 8 cups of apples because that's all I bought and it worked out great.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup because the apples are already sweet, and when you add ice cream to it b4 eating, that's enough sugar!!  I also decreased water to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Absolutely delicious.  It makes a huge pan so I can share with my coworkers!!

I've never made apple crisp. I followed the recommendations of adding nutmeg, using green apples, using half the white and brown sugar, adding half the water, and it turned out awesome. I will make this again very soon!

This recipe was alright. Major change I would do next time is use UNSALTED butter for the crumble instead of just regular butter. When it came out, it was a bit too salty for my taste.

This is awesome.  We had to many apples off of our tree and made these for our neighbors.  They are still raving about it.  note:  Its just as good and less runny without the water.

I have a fabulous apple crisp recipe that I've been using for years, but I was in the mood of a change. This one provides stiff competition, although it reminds me more of an upside down apple pie than a crunchy crisp. Following reviewers advice, I made the following changes:
1. In the flour mixture, I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added a dash of nutmeg. Then I mixed the mixture into the apples. 
2. Cut the water in half.
3. Doubled the topping.
With these changes, it's a delectable dish!

Melt-in-your-mouth delicious topping! I doubled the topping amount and added half to the bottom like some reviewers suggested and I wouldn't have it any other way! The apples are runny so forget the extra water and I added an extra tablespoon of flour to my second crisp and it came out great. I also noticed that the cooking time isn't sufficient enough to soften my apples so I had to bake it 30 minutes or more longer. Other than that, this is the best apple crisp recipe ever!!! My family and I love it and will continue to use this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Great Recipe! One change though, instead of melting the butter I cut the cold butter in to the crumb mixture; it makes better "crumb clusters."

This was ok- it turned out a little dry for me and I like a little more crisp topping.  I used apple juice in place of water and omitted the white sugar completely- there is no need for that much sugar.  Just the brown was fine.  It was plenty sweet.  I had to bake it a lot longer than stated for the apples to get tender.  I'm also wondering what the addition of baking soda and powder had to offer.  I've made many crisps and never seen that before.

It was a bit too sweet...next time I'll cut down on the sugar a bit and I think it will taste better...Also, you need to increase the topping on top...it wasn't enough...

I'm a caterer, and used this dessert twice in the last few weeks. Rave reviews!!! I cut the sugar in half, added nutmeg, left out the H2O,made 1 1/2 times the topping, and served it with Pumpkin Pie ice cream. Will make it again, and again, and again!!!

Excellent apple crisp! I used tart Michigan apples, Ida Red and Jonathan. Added cinnamon & nutmeg to the topping as well as apples. I did not use water and certainly didn't need any. Topping came out slightly crispy.  This is a definite keeper!

This recipe was amazingly awesome.  Based on previous reviews, I used Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples, doubled the topping, substituted Splenda for the sugar, and cut out the water entirely.  I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg in with the cinnamon.  Delicious!

We were very dissapointed in this recipe. My husband said it should be called apple 'mushy', not apple crisp and I agree.  I'll stick to my standard apple crisp recipe.

This recipe is delicious, no wonder 700 people have rated it with a 5 star rating. Every time I make this dish for a party or get together, the company cannot believe how great it tastes. We normally serve it with vanilla ice cream  YUM YUM!

Very good.  Make sure the topping/crust ingredients are doubled, w/the exception of the oats, as I'm not the hugest fan of them.  Instead of doubling the oats, I added an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar in it's place.  I served french vanilla ice cream on top.  Yum!

This recipe was easy and so delicious! I did add some extra spices (dash of cloves, nutmeg, and ground ginger) and some vanilla and brown sugar to the apples. It is not necessary to double the topping. I think it would be too much if you did that. I didn't have a problem with the apples getting mushy, but you will have that problem if you use an apple that is not meant for baking. Use Granny Smiths. They always work well for baking.

This was really good and easy to make too, although I think I'll try just softening the butter instead of melting it. I like the topping more chunky. Great recipe though, my husband and I love it and I think I'll be making pretty often!

I've made this several times now and it is the best apple crisp I have ever made or tasted.  I always get compliments on it and it is usually eaten too fast to keep left overs around.  It is excellent warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe turned out to be quite easy to make.  I did omit the water, and it was a good idea because the juice from the apples and sugary syrup created a lot of liquid anyway.  I would probably add more flour to the crumby topping, being as it was not as crumby/crispy on the top as I would have liked.  It also turned out to be really rich and very sweet, so make sure you have a sweet tooth for this apple crisp.  Over all, very good and it has made it into the "make again" pile for me!

Due to my husband being diabetic I replaced the white sugar with Splenda. I also reduced the amount to 3/4 cup for the Splenda & also reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. We find there is no difference in taste.

I rated this apple crisp 4 stars because I found that using 10 cups of apples was a bit too much apple.  I also found it to be a tad too sweet for my taste.  I will definitely make again, but using 6-7 cups of apples and I will cut down on the white sugar.

Great recipe.  I made several of the changes suggested by other reviewers...some I agree with...some I don't.  I agree with cutting back the water a bit.  But, I'm not sure I would double the topping.  I think I would do 1 1/2 times the topping next time.  I like a bit more...but double was too much.  I will definitely make this again!

I am rating it a 5-star based on comments from my husband and his co-workers (sweets aren't my thing).  They said it was fabulous.  Like others, I tweeked the recipe a bit.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of ground cloves to the crumb mixture - which I doubled.  Left the liquid for the apples (I used granny smith) as the recipe indicated.  The water/sugar mixture made a light caramel sauce which my husband said was fantastic.  Did not have ice cream, but the boys topped the crisp with half-n-half.

Really really great... I only used half of the white sugar the recipe called for.. and just like when I make an apple pie, I always had a splash of vanilla and a little orange zest.. This recipe is definetly a keeper!!!

This was a big hit with my family.  My 3 year old is the one who picked this to make...he loves to bake!  Next time I make it (and I definately WILL!) I will cut the sugar down some.  Maybe in half, actually.  It was way too sweet after a few bites, but we don't eat much sugar so that could be why.  Other than that, I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers and am so glad I did...that was the best part!  Try this recipe, it's soooooo yummy!  Good with ice cream, too.

I never liked the apple part of any apple crisp and would only eat the crisp part.  That was until I came across this recipe.  My husband loved it!  I did make some changes:
1) tossed Granny Smith apples in the white sugar-flour-cinnamon mixture, 2) eliminated the 1/2 cup water, 3) made 1.5x the crisp.  UBBER GOOD!

This was great, but can't give it 5 stars since I altered the amount of sugar so much. I cut both sugars in half and it was very tasty. My husband even commented that he liked how he could taste the apples and it wasn't too sweet. Next time I will eliminate the water. That didn't seem to add anything and actually probably just made it too loose.

This is the perfect recipe for apple crisp. I would recommend doubling the crumb topping if you like a big crunch.  I also added even more oatmeal.

This was WAY too sweet - and even with putting fresh lemon juice over the apples, it was still too sweet.  Next time I will use 1/2 the sugar (even with the lemon) and I would omit the water. The apples make enough of their own juice - water not required. Topping is very good!

Delicious recipe.  I too doubled the topping recipe.  I did not add any water (if I had it would have been way too runny) Be sure to peel the apples as the recipe recommends.  I didn't & the peel gets tough in the cooking.

Was looking for a way to quickly use up apples that were on the verge of going bad and this recipe is a Godsend.  It is excellent warm or cold and very easy to make.  I even had all the ingredients on hand.  I left out the water, substituted  half the white sugar for brown in the filling, added a generous tsp. each of vanilla and lemon juice, and tossed the filling in a bowl to coat the apples beforehand and the texture was perfect.

This is an awesome recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white, 1/4 cup of water, and butter on the apples. The crisp is excellent and is my favorite part so I doubled it. EVERYONE loved it...will definitely make again.

This was good.  It was very much like the one I have been making for years.  Don't add the water.  Double the crust and you'll be good. Alittle more cinnamon too.

Terrific recipe.  Very kid-friendly, my little brother made it and it was delicious.  We drizzled caramel on top before putting it in the oven which gave it a nice, crunchy texture in places.

I gave my daughter a casserole dish for Christmas and made this apple crisp in the casserole the day before.  It was a big hit!  In spite of our huge Christmas dinner, the apple crisp was eaten up.  We had whipped cream on top.  Thanks for my big success.

I made this recipe and it was fantasic. I used a different topping mix from another recipe and used the whole amount of water and doubled the cinnamon and flour, it was still had a little to much juice so I think I will reduce the water by 1/2 next time. The topping I always double. I used Johnatan Apples and the same amount of sugar. I didn't think it was too sweet. I have always loved apple crisp but the recipe I had always used was lacking something and thought the apples needed more flavor which this recipe definately does that. I will make this recipe from now on.

This REALLY is a good recipe!  I've made apple crisps so many times before, but had to try this to see what all the other reviewers were raving about.  I used less sugar in the apples and it still came out delicious!  Perfect crumbly crust, a no-fail recipe.

This was very good. I would have given it 5 stars, but the water made it too juicy. Next time I would skip adding the water.

This was delicious!  I omitted the water, reduced the sugar overall and halved the apple part to put in an 8X8 pan.  Kept the topping amount the same for that higher crisp to apple ratio. I might have to make it again this weekend!

I made this about a week ago because I have alot of extra apples.  I used granny smith about 8 medium to large apples so more than 10 cups and I stirred all the ingredients except topping stuff into the apples.  I used a little more cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  I did not add the water!!! I put 1 1/2 times the topping on top.  It turned out fantastic.  This is the apple crisp recipe I will use from now on.  I took some of it to my very picky male coworker and he also loved it.

This was an excellent apple crisp, our family loved it. If you're using a 9x13 pan I would double the topping recipe otherwise the topping is very sparse across the top.
I'm adding this to my recipe collection!

I thought this was a fantastic apple crisp recipe. Contrary to other reviews, I found that I had plenty of the topping and did not need to double it! In fact, I had more than I needed. Just shows how we all have varying opinions, so you just have to try it for yourself to find out what suits your needs! The ONLY thing I had to change was the 1 cup sugar which is sprinkled over the apples. I only used 1/3 cup and to us, that was plenty sweet. We used Rome apples which already have an average sweetness. I guess if you use Granny Smith or other tart apples than you may want the full 1 cup sugar. Otherwise......it was GREAT!!!!!!!

This is the best apple crisp recipe! I substituted two 21 ounce cans of apple pie filling for the first five ingredients. I also put 1/2 cup chopped pecans in the topping.It turned out great and my family loves it.

I made the recipe for 3 different holiday parties and it was a huge hit.  I did do 1/2 on the water and 1/2 on both sugars like they suggested and that worked out well, one time I did 3/4 on the sugar and it was too much.  In addition I added extra oats to the topping because I love them so much.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious.  I read the other reviewers suggestions and double the topping (putting cinnamon in the topping also), decreased the white sugar by 1/2 and used 1/2 Jonathan & 1/2 Granny Smith apples.  Took about 4 Grannys & 5 Jonathans.  The pan was FULL.  (Probably because of doubled topping.)  Most people at Thanksgiving chose this topped with ice cream.

Wow, is this delicious!  Tastes like it should be a big deal to prepare, but the only thing that really takes any time at all is peeling & slicing the apples.  I added "craisins" (dried cranberries) to the apple mixture, and a little vanilla extract to the topping mixture.  Thanks, Diane, for a great recipe!

This was okay.  I did enjoy the topping very much.  However, I thought that there was not enough "juice" from the apples.  I did cut down on the amount of apples, too.

This recipe was very delicious and easy to make. It actually tastes better the day after. I added a little bit more oatmeal-2Tbls, since we are big fans of it, and it made it even more heartier! Next time, I'm going to add some walnuts! ummmmm

This was a great recipe. I read a few of the other reviews and I have to agree that the sweetness of the recipe was an issue. I would imagine that the sweetness seems to vary a lot, depending on what type of apples you end up using and your own personal preference. I used golden delicious apples, and the recipe was still not sweet enough for me. I served it with vanilla ice cream, and that worked out beautifully.  So depending on the baker's particular preference, just be careful of the amount of sugar and the type of apple you use. I don't have a whole lot of experience baking with apples, so I'm still not good knowing a good balance between the natural sweetness of apples and the amount of sugar to add. All in all, I'd say this recipe is excellent, and very easy. And one must definetly eat it with ice cream!

Amazing!!! I was kind of iffy when I checked after 15 minutes, looked like it would be really dry, but after the full cooking time, it was wonderful. My family finished 3/4 of it the first night. I cut the amount of apples and cinnamon sugar topping by half, but left the oat topping at full (same result as doubling the topping). Tastes just like that at a restaurant I loved as a child.

I could not wait to rate this recipe because this was the best apple crisp recipe ever. I made it twice I always make a recipe more then once so I can point out what I did wrong. The second time was awsome. The apple crisp melted in my mouth. For tips: Make sure that the apples you cut are not two thin if so when they are cooked they will lose some of their juices, and also make sure that you peel the apples real good and don't leave any part of the core tissue on your cut up apples if so when you reheat it later the core pieces on your apples become more tough. Also blend the mixture well with the melted butter that made a big difference when I made sure their  were no lumps at all (use a hand blender on the lowest speed) Will become very moist.

This apple crisp was delicious!  It was very easy to make and my husband really enjoyed it.  I used an Applemaster to peel, core and slice the apples, so it went together really quickly.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves apple crisp.

I needed to use up some apples someone gave me so I looked for Apple Crisp recipes I decided on this one. I stayed pretty much on recipe except my apples were sweet so I added some vinegar to them and let them soak it up. I then added some vanilla to the water you add to the apples and some nutmeg along with the cinnamon called for. It was absolutely the best Apple Crisp I have ever had. Everyone who had some asked for the recipe. It's a winner.

Made a few changes based on recommendations from other reviewers. 1) Added nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon mix and tossed the apples in it, rather than sprinkling it over the apples. 2) Cut the water in half, down to 1/4 -- you could probably go without it altogether, but I liked the slight soupiness. 3) Refrigerated the topping for about 40 minutes to re-harden the butter, which allowed it to remain crumbly even after baking. 4) Served with french vanilla ice cream rather than regular vanilla/vanilla bean. Absolutely fantastic with the changes.

This is a delicious dessert.  Everyone in my family liked it.  I thought it needed to be cooked about 5-6 minutes longer.  Also, I decreased the amount of sugar in the sugar, flour and cinnamon mixture and it was plenty sweet.  I'll definitely be making this again.

If you're looking for something different and relatively easy to make then this recipe is for you!!:) Below is my experience when trying this recipe: so i tried this recipe about two weeks ago, I'm new to the whole baking and cooking thing. I used granny smith apples in this recipe. I ended up burning the top (i set the dish to close to the heating elements), once i took off the charcoal everyone ate some after dinner AND everyone LOVED it and said this is how an apple crisp tastes. The syrup that develops during cooking is good and the apples keep a nice texture. 
      Next time I make this I may use more butter when making the topping just because it still felt really dry when mixing in the 1/2 cup of butter.
     Overall definitely a great recipe and will be making again. :)

Very good! I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the topping. As soon as it came out of the oven, I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on top, too. I used margarine because I didn't have any butter. For my family, I would cut down the apples to 8C instead of 10 because we aren't "huge" fans of Apple. Delicious!

WAY TOO SWEET! Next time I will omit the white sugar (only do the crumble with cinnamon). Apples have enough sugar on their own!

This recipe is fantastic! My family LOVES it!!! I went with someone else's suggestion and reduced the water to 1/4 cup and I doubled the crumb topping. Serve warm with a scoop of ice cream... It's so delicious!

This was super yummy. Like the other reviews I suggest cutting out the water. I did half of it and it was still pretty runny, just cut it out. I also doubled the topping!

Excellent recipe!  However, I cut the sugar in half as one of the people  who would be eating this is a diabetic.  However, the sugar was just right for us non-diabetics. I can't imagine this with full sugar.

This was way too sweet!  I think it was the full cup of sugar in the apples, because the topping was just fine.  I'll try making it again and cutting the sugar in the apples down by half.

Followed almost everything and incorporate a couple suggestions. Cut the water in half, added a bit of nutmeg and used granny smith apples.  So good!  It must be paired with ice cream for the full yummy effect.

These came out really crispy, hard actually. Needs way more apple slices because they shrivel up into tiny pieces after baking.

I have made this at least 7 times and it's usually gone within 2 days at my house! The only thing I do different....Old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking ones and I increase the oatmeal by 1/2 cup because I love oatmeal.

This was easy to make and very tasty. However, it was a bit to sweet. My teeth actually hurt! Next time I would cut the sugar in half. Otherwise, this was very tasty and would make again with half the sugar!

Awesome recipe!! I used granola and oats for the crisp, double the amounts. I would recommend adding salt, and using butter instead of water.

I really liked this. It's hard to judge how many apples (and what size) will be 10 cups so I just used 6 large Granny Smiths, sliced into 16ths, which seemed like a good amount for my 9x13 pan. Some of my slices were probably 1/2" to 3/4" thick,  shows how big my apples were... I added no water, baking soda or baking powder because I saw no reason for their inclusion. I did add at least a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples and more cinnamon because we like our spices. Other than these changes everything else remained the same. The amount of topping was just right, it was perfectly cooked in 45 mins and absolutely delicious.

Very good recipe that I have made many times. - I don't put water on the apples and I found a better crumble but this one will work too - just doesn't get quite as crunchy as I like it and it's not quite enough for a 9X13.   

Superior Crumble:
Mix 1 1/2 cup flour, i cup packed brown sugar, 2 cups quick oats, and 1 teaspoon (or more) cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Mix in one cup melted butter until well combined.

Scrumptious and so easy! Excellent apple crisp!

I used half the apples but kept the topping the same (I like more crisp) thinking this would be the perfect size for my husband and me. After tasting it I wish I would have made a bigger one - it is so good!

I mixed the sugar/cinnamon with the sliced Granny Smiths before putting into the baking dish, and I reduced the water to 2 tablespoons, and made extra "crisp" for the topping.  My mother-in-law said it was better than hers, so you know this is a keeper recipe.  I've already been asked to bring it to Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter.....   My husband loves apple pie, but claims he'll never eat another piece of pie as long as this apple crisp is available.   Many thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This is a great dish! I used Honey Crisp apples, I bought from the Amish Market, (they were the size of softballs) so I only used about 5 apples for this recipe!

This is an absolute fantastically delicious apple crisp. INSTEAD of water, I used the zest of one orange and squeezed the juice from the orange. For those that have made this recipe over and over, try this tweak with the orange and you will probably agree that it brings out an extra note of flavor brightness. 

Cheers!

10/12/2014: Listened to a lot of the tips in other reviews... doubled the crumble (for a layer on the bottom), halved the water (used galas so only used half the sugar) which I added to the sugar mixture and tossed it all together (instead of pouring the water over it into the dish).

AMAZING reviews from the full fam.

12/25/2017: Made this again today.  10 cups of apples made A LOT of apple crisp. I ended up making a triple batch of crumble mixture, doing a 9x13 and a 9x9 pan of crumble. Again, super good. Used Macintosh this time.

I was searching for a new apple crisp recipe.  Every fall, we pick bags of apples and make about 10 pans of apple crisp to freeze and eat throughout the year.  I made two different recipes (this being one) and had a taste off.  Everyone preferred this recipe.  The apples keep their shape and don't cook to pieces.  I only added 1/4 cup water and there is lots of liquid in the bottom of the pan.  I suggest you adjust the water depending on the type of apple you're using.  We use Mutsu apples and I will reduce the liquid to 1/8 cup (or less) in the future.  The topping was crispy.  We like a sweet apple crisp, so I left the other amounts as specified in the recipe.  Yum!

Love this recipe! I left out the water accidentally when I made one for my mom and it turned out great. Made another pan for my own family and remembered the water that time but it makes the crisp too runny. Much better without the added water.

So good! My husband and three boys ate more than half the pan in one sitting. I used 1/4 cup apple cider instead of 1/2 cup water. I cut white sugar by 1/4 cup. I used 2 tsp cinnamon and also added a dash of nutmeg and clove. I also increased the topping by 50% but left the brown sugar the same amount. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was amazing!! I did make a couple of small changes. I cut the white sugar in half and doubled the cinnamon. had macintosh apples on hand so i used those, sprinkled with a little lemon juice and omitted the water. I doubled the topping and added a little cinnamon. Delicious!!! This is a keeper!

Delicious! I changed mine up a little bit. I coated the apples in the sugar mixture instead of sprinkling them. I also used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  Amazing. I was doing a bake sale to raise money for charity and baked then in little mason jars. Absolute perfection!

I followed the recipe exactly, including using the water and did not double the topping as some suggested and it was a big hit. ( I personally feel doubling the topping would have been way too much). I just always recommend tasting an apple first. If it is a sweeter apple cut down on the sugar, a tarter apple the sugar can be left alone.

Wanted to chime in here with another stellar review and a couple of tips. Used six Granny Smith apples, and 1/4 cup of water as someone else suggested, and it was a tiny bit dry on top so I think the 1/2 cup would have been fine. Also mixed the sugar, cinnamon, flour, etc. and added some nutmeg as someone else suggested, and tossed the apples in the mix. Didn't double the recipe; it was by far enough topping as written. One of the BEST apple crisps I've ever made!

I kept everything the same except I used 5 Granny Smiths, 1/2 cup sugar divided among both white and brown and also threw in some salt and nutmeg. Kept topping the same except I cut in softened butter and made in 11x7 dish. Accompanied this with a homemade salted caramel sauce from Sally's Baking Addiction which is liquid gold and really set this over the edge. Oh and of course some vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

Holy cow, this was sweet!! I halved the sugar (used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the topping, and 1/2 in the apples). There was also too much flour in the topping, as it was kind of pasty in our mouths. Would not repeat. :(

This was Fabulous!  I only used 1/4 cup of water and the apples were very moist!  I did double the entire crumble, but just because that is my favorite part of apple crisp as is my families.  They loved it!  Only bake as long as the recipe states or your apples will be mush!  I plan on making this again in a few more months for the holidays...it is that good!  Serve with french vanilla ice cream over the top.

Feels like Fall! I only had 5 small apples that started to dry out. Still able to make enough for 3 individual porcelain pies. Decreased the topping amounts by half which left the apples mostly covered with the crumb topping. Perfect!

Yummy!! Everyone loves it! Changes I made, however, are: skipped the water; added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg; cut the sugars back by a third. As it was, it was way too sweet for everyone.

This was excellent! I made it for the first time for my July 4th party, and everyone who ate it complemented how good it was. I used about 7 large granny smith's, and per another reviewer I mixed the apples in the cinammon sugar mixture and then put them in the dish. I also added half the water it calls for, and it came out perfect. I doubled the amount of topping- personally I thought that was too much topping, but everyone else loved it. May make 1.5x topping next time. Served this with the homemade Vanilla Ice Cream IV on this site, and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe

Mine was great. Perfect crunch. I used other reviews to tweak my recipe. I doubled the topping recipe and used most of it. Used 1 stick of butter diced cold and 1/2 stick melted.added vanilla to my topping and pecans.I tossed my apples in sugar mixture with added nutmeg. cut the water down to 1/4 cup over apples. Was crisp even after being in the fridge 2 days. Never got soggy leftovers. Awesome.

I served this as dessert for Father's Day dinner and we all thought it was SO good! I followed others' directions and doubled the crust- putting one layer on the bottom and a second layer on top. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, lessened the water to 1/4 c and used granny smith apples. It was EXTREMELY sweet and I'm not sure we would have been able to eat it if we didn't add a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, which actually cut the sweetness. I'll definitely make this again but I'll use less sugar.

I have baked for a long time and always make apple pies - our new Pastor liked apple crisps - so had to find a recipe. Tried this one and it was very good and well received. I also baked it in 9x9 and used only 
1/4 C. H2O. Would recommend to anyone :) thanks!

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made.  I used 6 apples I think, and just used the normal amount of everything. The only modification I made was that I added 1/8-1/4 tsp salt to the crumble mixture. I think it needed it and it tasted great. Also, I forgot the water and it wasnt a problem at all.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day and everyone loved it.  I made a few small changes but mostly stuck to the recipe.  I cut 10 small granny smith apples and soaked them in a bag with a sugar mix (1cup sugar, 3 tbs cinnamon, 2 tbs all purpose flour).  I let it sit for a couple hours to soak up flavor.  I Didn't add water b/c there was more than enough juice from the apples in the bag.  For the crumble I doubled the recipe (next time I will only make 1.5x b/c I had plenty leftover).  I cut the butter instead of melting it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! Family loves it. Here are the suggesting I followed:
Double crust and put on top and bottom.
Blend soft butter in crust instead of melting it.
Lemon on apples instead of water.
Added nutmeg.
Yum..
Next time I will use just a tad less white sugar.

Very bland? I don't get the great reviews?? Needs some salt and vanilla - I used unsalted butter ? I added apple pie spice and twice as much cinnamon tg!! idk what the baking soda and powder were for? didn't rise? Next time I would toss w/ lemon juice , add salt , vanilla and skip soda and powder - and add some pecans!

I made this the other day. Instead of making it in a 9x13 pan I made it in a crust round pan, the ones you buy in the store for pie and it came out perfect!the crust on the bottom was a nice touch, instead of making more of the crumb topping. Make sure you use good apples or it wint come out as well. I think I lowered the sugar because I had very sweeet apples. All in all, this is the best apple crisp recipe. Its perfect, and im making it today!

having a hell of a time doing this on my mobile phone, so, I will just say that I loved it, I added "pickled" tri-color raisins (in rum, leftover from a previous recipe). And walnuts, mixed in with the oat mixture, and it came out delicioso! Mmmmm B-) will definitely be making this again!

This is a great apple crisp recipe.  I use 6-7 very large Granny Smith apples, which made for a nice tart apple taste to go up against the sweet topping.  I find that mixing the apples in a large bowl helps to evenly distribute the cinnamon/sugar/flour mixture before spreading the apples in the pan.  I skip the water (per other reviews) and don't miss it at all--the apples release plenty of liquid as they cook.  I also roughly double the topping mixture, as my family likes that part the best.  This recipe has become a highly requested dessert at family gatherings.

Meh...definitely not worth all the hype people have been giving it. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a little less water as others have suggested. It came out...ok...but nothing to rave about. I used granny smith apples, and the thing was pretty tart and not that sweet. For me, this was not a dish that was best served fresh. It actually tasted better the next day after the apples lost a lot of their tart flavor. Also, the crumb topping wasn't very good.

Thee best apple crisp recipe!!! I use half the suggested apples and omit adding any water when first placing the apples in the dish. I also sometimes add flaked coconut to the crisp.

Great recipe.  
Don't be afraid to make a few changes to your liking. I doubled the topping and used 7 Granny Smith apples. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in my apple mixture instead of white as well as 1 cup in my topping. I also added the juice of one lemon to the apples instead of water and added cinnamon and nutmeg liberally. I left my apples in the fridge for half the day before baking.
For the crust I made sure my butter was cold (cold butter suspended in the batter is what makes your crumbles)
I added a tad of cinnamon, and didn't bother with the baking soda or baking powder. 
And used my hands to mash everything together. After I was done I pressed it all down in my bowl and let it chill in the freezer. When I was ready to bake I used a fork to make big chunks. Mmm. Baked at 325 for 50 min. 

Best served... Anytime with ice cream. :)

This was a great crisp.  I omitted the water on accident and when I pulled it out after 35 min it looked really dry.  I covered it with foil, poured 2c cream over the top and put it back in for 15 min.  It was wonderful. The cream made a rich, delicious sauce.  I also cut the sugar on the apples in half.  I used fuji apples.

This was SO good! Only deviations I made were that I used a 8x8 glass dish, used 1/4 c water, and probably only 7+ c apple slices. Would be perfect with vanilla ice cream!

Recipe was very good!! I did make some changes. Since I was using all red eating apples (red delicious, gala, and fuji) I went with what other reviewers said and cut the sugar way down. I used less than 1/2 c for the apples. I also added in the 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture and tossed the apples in the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg mixture. I added a very small amount of water (less than 1/4 cup) and it came out perfectly. For the crumble topping I doubled it and added in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chopped pecans but kept everything else the same. I baked it for the entire 45 minutes and it was delicious. I will make this again. It was a perfect addition to our brunch. 

I did have some left over topping ( I used 3/4 the amount) so I mashed up two very ripe bananas and mixed them in, scooped into mini muffin pan then baked at 350F for about 12-15 minutes (until toothpick came out smooth), sprinkled a small amount of cinnamon on each and it was a delicious treat! Tasted just like banana bread. You could probably mix in some cinnamon into the batter instead of sprinkling on top but that was an after thought.

This was wonderful!  I only had 6 medium apples so I used those but made the amount of topping called for in the recipe.  It was the perfect ratio of apples to topping.  I made it in a Corningware dish that I could cover and store in the refrigerator.

Family favorite!

Everyone raves about this apple crisp, and my partner expects it as his yearly "birthday cake."

It's super easy to make, and sometimes I substitute pancake mix for the flour (I was out of flour once), and I think they like that even more!

I added 1/2 C. of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey in with the apples instead of the water. Fantastic! I too doubled the topping recipe only using 3/4 C. butter. Served warm over ice cream is a must and if you like, drizzle a little Fireball over it all for an added kick. You will never make apple crisp any other way again.

Love this recipe!!! I changed the spices a bit as I like it a little more spicy. Added 1/4 tspn of ginger, nutmeg and all spice in with apples and then cinnamon as well as other spices to crust. It was amazing! I served it with whipped cream and the whole thing was eaten by 4 adults in one sitting. Piggies:) I baked it at 325 for an extra 12 minutes and it was absolute heaven. Best apple crisp recipe ever.

SO YUMMY! I sprinkled nutmeg over the apples before adding the crumble mix on top. I also baked for a little longer so the topping was a little crispier. We couldn't get enough!

This is an excellent recipe. As Ally99 said, only use a 1/4 c of water. Using a 1/2 c will make it too runny. It's still reeeeeeaally good. I don't see this sticking around the house for very long.

I MADE CHANGES!! I used Jonagold apples and worked purrfecty! I thought this was a wonderful recipe. It was my first time of ever making it and I followed it completely. My family enjoyed it but being a southern girl it needed a little bit more.  These are the changes that I did the 2nd time of making it:
Used dark brow sugar instead of sugar 
Added vanilla extract and nutmeg but no measuring just by taste. 
Cut back on water because of the vanilla.
For the topping,
 I used 3/4 cup of flour
A little extra of butter
Added some of some of the juices from the apples
OMGOODNESS! It caramelized up so well and was not runny. The topping was awesome and it goes great with coffee! Thanks DK

This sounded like a great recipe to try out and maybe take to Thanksgiving dinner.  I just pulled this out of the oven.  The taste is great.  I cut the recipe in half, but left the original topping measurements as others suggested. I also used much more cinnamon and nutmeg, and added a tsp of vanilla.
Pros: Good flavor, looks pretty.
Cons: Could use less water and oats next time.  Maybe as it sets the water-glaze will thicken.  This is almost too much topping for my taste, and for my 8x8 pan. I realize a lot of people do like the topping part better though, so I think this could go over well.  Overall, good recipe and easily tweakable.  I think I'll do things a bit differently next time if I want to serve this to company.

Made this for desert tonight for the family, and it was awesome!  As a dad who enjoys baking but often creates flops, this worked out perfectly.

Not sure if I actually had 10 cups of apple or not... I had a bunch... :)  Enough to pile up the 9x13 pan pretty well.  And I followed the recipe exactly, *except* I decided not to put all of the sugar/cinnamon mix on the apples.  I mixed those ingredients as per the recipe, but then only used about half of it, and the taste was amazing.

Made the topping/crust as per the recipe, and it was also perfect... plenty for a nice thick crunchy crust.

We didn't have any ice cream at home, but it really didn't need it!  It is that good!

Super delicious and VERY easy". I used Granny Smith apples and the ONLY change I made was that I baked it covered!  It was a big hit and the left overs were equally delicious!

My issue with this recipes is that I CANNOT STOP EATING IT! I;ve made it about 100 times and every time I take a little spoonful of it and next thing I know I've eaten half the pan. Seriously, go make it, this is THE BEST. Also, don't worry if you don't have baking soda, I've never used it ( I never seem to have it around) and it always turns out amazing.

WONDERFUL! Made is for a work pot luck. Got very good reviews. Personally next time I will cut the water down to 1/4cup. I like my apples to still have a little bite but still very good.

Made this today with my boyfriend and we both loved it! I used mostly Granny Smith apples but threw in a Pink Lady and a Braeburn just for some variety. I also followed what some reviewers said and instead of adding water, I mixed the apples in the sugar/flour mixture to draw out moisture and I found them to be perfectly moist after baking. I don't recommend doubling the topping mixture like some reviewers suggested. I was going to double it but decided to see how much the original recipe made first and I thought it was the perfect amount of topping. Any more would have been too much, in my opinion. Also, I used 3/4 cup sugar in the apples instead of 1 cup to balance the sweetness of my Pink Lady and Braeburn apples, and I used wheat flour instead of white. I found this recipe to be delicious and I definitely plan on making it again. Not to mention it's easy and fairly cheap to make!

Great recipe! I had the apples all prepped and realized I was out of oatmeal. So I subbed 3 packets(which equals 1 cup) of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal. I decreased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup to compensate for the sweetness of the oatmeal. And I increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for a great recipe!

Normally I make a recipe the way it is written but this time I took the advice of some of the reviewers. Pros: adding Apple pie spice good. Mixing apples in with sugar, flour, cinnamon good. Cons: Not adding water, bad. My oats didn't cook. Using any type of apples, bad. Mixing two different types of apples made this too sweet. I like a little tart to my Apple crisp. I gave this five stars because the second batch that I made tonight as written, keeping with the pros and cons was delicious!Next one that I make, I will make without any changes! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it had way to much sugar.  1/2 cup is plenty and I used granny smith apples which are pretty tart.  I did double the topping and it was very good.  Also, could see no point to add baking powder and soda, so left it out.  I'm not sure what that would have done for it.

Delicious!  I used a variety of apples (macs and cortlands)and followed the directions almost exactly.  I forgot the water and only had regular oats.  It came out great! Topped with vanilla ice cream, of course!

I had a pantry full of very bruised apples so decided to try this recipe rather than trying to force the kids to eat them! We loved this recipe and I certainly won't be waiting for the next batch of old apples before making this again. So simple and very, very tasty.

Delicious! While I normally make apple crisp with Granny Smith, our orchard didn't have any so I went with 1/2 cortland and 1/2 macintosh. I doubled the topping and made the mistake of using one stick of butter by accident rather then two (d'oh!) and naturally it was pretty dry which took me a while to figure out why ( you, White Zinfandel!) but i did a bit of damage control and mixed the topping in with the apples to moisten it up. I halved the water also but i don't think it was necessary

Just made this using 15 Gala apples, it was delicious!! I cut the water in half,(per other reviews) and I also cut the white sugar by half since I was using all Gala apples, and added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. I followed the topping exact and I thought it was plenty for my 9x13. Thanks, Diane for the wonderful recipe!!

Don't follow reviewers advice about doubling the topping.  It was way too much topping and I wish I had followed the recipe as written.  If I had, I think I would have loved it.

Family really liked this.  I read reviews so stirred the flour sugar mixture into the apples, doubled the topping recipe using brown sugar instead of white.  I used old-fashioned oats as I didn't have any quick oats.  I added about 1/4 cup of apple juice instead of water in case the old fashioned oats would soak up more moisture.  The crisp turned out great.  The topping was a crisp, golden brown and the apples turned out well too.  The topping could probably be made with a little less brown sugar if you prefer a less sweet topping.  This is a recipe I'll make again.

Turned out perfectly!  Don't mess with this recipe! Perfect as is!  I used Granny Smith apples and left the peel on.  Delightful awesomeness!

Awesome recipe, very easy to adjust to whatever ingredients you have at hand.  Like other users suggested I omitted the water, reduced the sugar and baked in 9x13 dish. Came out great.  I used wild apples, which are small and red and grow right outside my parents yard. The coring and pealing took a while, but the crisp made it worth it. I sprayed the dish with Pam and tossed the apples with 1/4 cup white sugar (didn't have brown), a pinch of ground cinnamon nutmeg and 1 table spoon of flour. I poured the apples in the dish. For the topping I used 2 individual serving packets of instant quacker oatmeal in banana bread flavor ( all I had for oatmeal in the pantry) 1/2 cup self-rising flour (out of all purpose, so I omitted baking soda and powder from my recipe) 1/4 cup white sugar, pinch of cinnamon, 1/4 cup butterscotch chips. I tossed the dry ingredients then melted 1 stick (8 tablespoons) of butter and poured it into the dry ingredients. Roughly mixed until the mixture looked like wet sand and crumbled on top of the apples. Baked for 45 min at 350 degrees. Broiled the top for two minutes at the end. Delicious served with whipped cream. Yum yum!

Apple mush! I used Granny smith apples and they literally turned into applesauce. There is way too much sugar in this recipe, it makes my stomach hurt. Normally my apple crisp is bubbling, this one wasn't. It had an entire layer of dried oatmeal mixture just sitting on top. Complete fail.

1. I read the recipe and top reviews and came up with the following stellar recipe. At a dinner party everyone (6 different couples) asked for the recipe and every crumb was gone.  
2.	 Mix the white sugar, 1 tablespoon flour and ground cinnamon together, and  lay apple slices in mixture and flip over apples so they are coated well.
3.	Combine the oats, 2 cups flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and melted butter together in a bowl.
4.	Place about ¼ of the oat mixture at the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan
5.	Place the sliced apples over the ¼ mixture
6.	Pour the rest of the sugar-cinnamon mix evenly over the apples 
7.	Pour ¼ cup water evenly over apples
8.	Crumble the rest of the 3/4th oat mixture evenly over the apples.
9.	Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes.

I halved the recipe and still needed a 9x13 pan! It came out delicious. I served it in wine goblets with vegan ice cream.

Most requested from work and home. I double the crust. I use Honeycrisp Apples and no water (there's enough water retained in the apples). I have also used the crust as a base in cheesecake recipes.

I use this recipe all the time. It disappears. 5 stars.

I use Granny Smith Apples, either 5 or 6 depending on the size.
I don't add the water.
I reduce the white sugar by about half.

The only thing I do that hasn't been mentioned is that after I spread the crust over the top, I take two hands and firmly compress the crust down on the apples, especially the edges. I find the end result stays together much better and reduces the "spillage" in the oven.

enjoy.

I have been searching for 20 years for an Apple Crisp recipe that mimicked the dish served in my Grade School back in the '70s. I have found it!!!!! After trying many, many, many recipes! I have an "old" peach cobbler recipe that is VERY SIMILAR to this EXCEPT it is with a batter topping. I followed the recipe exactly; however, I did add lemon juice to the apples to keep the color as I prepared the topping and to add a little acidity. I also added cinnamon to the apples along with dotting the apples in the baking dish with real butter. I added 1/8th cup of water, but had to remove the water after baking. Do not add water; it is NOT necessary. I used left over Red Delicious Apples. I also cut the recipe in half to fit an 8x8 pan, but kept the topping as is. It is to DIE FOR!!!!!! This recipe will forever be on my table! Congratulations!!!!

So perfect!! I ended up putting it in two different tart pans and loved it. I think being so spread out made the crisp part crispier :) I also subbed crushed graham crackers for the flour. Very happy with this change. Enjoy!!

It's pretty good - I added nutmeg as I've noticed some others did and some Vanilla extract. It's a little too sweet though - I cut back on the sugar a little bit, and next time I plan to cut back even more on it. Much healthier and you can taste the flavours past the sweetness! :)

I made this last night to use up the last dozen or so baking apples I picked the other day and this is my new go to apple crisp recipe! It turned out fantastic and smelled so good while baking, my husband kept asking if it was done yet so he could try it. I used slightly more then the 10 cups of apples called for because I didn't want just 2 apples left over as the apples I used are a bit tart for eating on their own. I also added some nutmeg to the sugar/flour (3tbsp)/cinnamon mix and rather than sprinkling over the apples I mixed it with the apples, poured the apples in my pan, sprinkled with 4tbsp of water and dotted with butter. For the topping I doubled the recipe (the topping is the best part!) and added chopped walnuts and a dash of cinnamon. I had to bake longer than recomended but I attribute that to using a few extra apples. I covered the crisp with foil for the first 20 or so minuets to avoid over browning. Next time I will cut back on the white sugar in the apples, 1/2-3/4 instead of 1 cup. Even with using very tart apples it was a bit on the sweet side for our taste. All in all a GREAT recipe that will be in regular rotation in our home.

This is the first time I've ever written a review, but was so pleased with this recipe I felt it was very deserving of a review.  I took other advise and doubled the topping and omitted the water and I used golden delicious apples.  The apple crisp turned out absolutely perfect and sooooooo easy to make!!  I took it to a meeting I had tonight and received compliments from all and brought home an empty pan.  Thank you Diane, for submitting this recipe!!!  It will be made many times over at this house and I'm positive it will be a family favorite.

This is a wonderful apple crisp.  Bought a 4lb bag of Honey Crisp apples at Sam's Club, ate one and didn't like it...more tart than usual.  So, I thought, dang, so much for eating healthy...I have to make a crisp now.   Peeled, cored and sliced the rest of bag and it measured out 10 cups perfectly.  Used a hand held apple slicer and then cut each of those slices in half lengthwise.  Followed recipe, except made 1 1/2 times the topping and had plenty for top and bottom.  As per other reviews, I cut butter into flour/oat/sugar mixture instead of melting it.   Didn't use water, probably wouldn't have hurt it any, though.  Baked for 1 hour to compensate for extra topping.   Perfectly delicious served hot with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream!   Family was all smiles.  Will add chopped pecans next time to put it over the top.

I've made this apple crisp twice now and love it.  The crisp stays nice and crunchy and is my favorite part!  I wanted to get this ready a little bit ahead of time so I made the crisp part first and just covered with plastic wrap.  A little bit later I peeled the apples and covered them with the sugar, flour and cinnamon mixture.  I did toss this all together in the baking dish because I felt it would help more evenly coat things.  I covered and just let it sit until I was ready to top with the crisp mixture, fully intending to add the water, but in the confusion of our family get together, I forgot.  I just topped with the crisp mixture and put it in the oven.  It was plenty juicy though and very delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream.

When you peel and core your apples, if you soak them in lightly lemoned water and then strain them, this is plenty to cover the water asked for in this recipe.  The sugars and natural water from apples make it caramely/ wet enough. Yummy.

This is a really good one.  My changes were; Sqeezed 1/2 of a lemon over sliced apples. 1/2 the white sugar, but did drizzle a little agave nectar over apples. Used i/2 coconut oil minus 1 Tblsp.  Added lots of cinnamon and a little pumpkin pie spice.  added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to topping mixture.

I actually cut this recipe in half and made this in my cast iron skillet. I used half Jonathan apples, half Granny Smith apples.  Before tossing the apples with the sugar, cinnamon and flour, I did toss them with a tablespoon of lemon juice to keep them from browning. I melted 1/4 cup of butter in my skillet as the oven was preheating, I just layered my apples on top of that. After 20 minutes of baking, I realized I had forgotten the flour.........but you know what, it still turned out AWESOME. Out of that whole skillet, there is NOTHING left over. We LOVED this crisp recipe. Even my husband said this is perfect and I'm to make this again. Tomorrow. SUCH a keeper.

Have made twice and we're very happy with it, but we use only half a cup of white sugar.  It works best for us to use ~ 8 medium-sized apples and no water! You don't need to use quick-cooking oats; we always use regular oats, and it comes out nice and crumbly!  You can also use a little less than 1/2 cup butter.  I like to add extra cinnamon.

Delicious!  I'm giving it 4 stars only because I found the water to be completely unnecessary. I tossed the apples in the sugar mixture and that brought out enough juices that the addition of the water just made it too watery.  Great recipe, though!  Will definitely be making it again.

This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted and all my friends just love it too. I have made it twice now once with macintosh apples and the other time with harleson apples.

This was an ABSOLUTE hit with the family!! The only thing I would change the next time I make it is to decrease the water! Other than that, this is one recipe I will not tweak beyond that tiny bit! This was definitely a hit and will be made many times I am sure!

This was absolutely delicious!  My entire family raved about this and we are making it again even though we just had it a few days ago (we have a lot of apples to use from our tree:))  Anyway, we followed some other reviewers advice and made the following changes:
-doubled the topping (next time will only time and a half it, as it was a little too much)
-mixed apples up with the flour/cinnamon mixture -did not add the water to the apples
-didn't really measure the apples...maybe only used 8cups?  Just kept adding until all sugar mixture used up, then added 2 more apples to coated ones
-used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg
-cut the butter into the topping with mixer instead of melting it
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a big hit at a bbq, several people asked me for the recipe!  It was super easy to make.  I used 1/4 cup of water and doubled the topping, as suggested by other reviewers.  I was going to add nutmeg as well, but I forgot.  It turned out great without it.  I used Granny Smith apples and baked it in a 8 1/2 X 11 baking dish, as I didn't have the bigger size pan that the recipe called for.  It turned out perfect. Definitely must be served with vanilla ice cream!

Add Cereal!! I didn't think it was possible to make this Apple Crisp recipe any better, but...I didn't have oats at home, so I grabbed a box of cereal out of the pantry - Honey Bunches of Oats - and mixed that into the topping mixture. It was SO good. The flakes and clusters of oats from the cereal are much crunchier and crisp than the plain old oats. I'm going to make that a permanent addition to this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! As others have done, I doubled the crisp and made it with the crisp on the bottom and on the top.  Also used a little more than the suggested amount of water due to the doubling of the crisp. It was nice bc it wasn't dry but moist and just right.  All I can so is oh so good!

This stuff is to die for!   The first time I made it, I sliced the apples a little too thick, and they did not get soft enough in cooking.   When I made it again, I used an apple corer/slicer to cut each apple into eight pieces, then cut each piece again lengthwise so I had sixteen slices per apple.  MUCH better!  Also, instead of adding the water, I rinsed the apple slices in a colander, then mixed them in with the cinnamon sugar combination.  Thanks to hints from other reviewers, I also added a pinch of nutmeg.  I doubled the topping recipe but had too much left over.  But if you like lots of crispy topping, I'd increase it by at least half.   Absolutely delicious, and none left over!

Made this today. Followed the instructions exactly except I used a mix of old leftover apples - granny smith, a fuji and some red delicious.  Turned out fantastic and a 9 x 13 pan is a lot of crisp.  Yum! Taking leftovers to the office tomorrow.

I always pick recipes with the fewest amount ingredients, the less ingredients for me usually ends up being the better recipes for my family.  I did double the topping based on other reviews next time I will only add an additional 1/2 of the topping almost too much crisp for me. However with that being said my husband tried to convince me that I ruined a good batch of apples with this recipe so he could have it all to himself and supposedly save me..lol...definitely will make this again, easy and excellent taste always win out!!

This makes a HUGE batch of Crisp.  I found that the recipe didn't make quite enough crumble so I made a second batch to sprinkle over the top and was glad I did.  It helped balance out all the appley goodness!

This is AMAZING!!! I didn't add any water like other people suggested and it was perfect. I used a 9X9 pan and didn't double the topping and just cooked it for 5 or 10 minutes longer and it was great! It was a little bit soupy though even without the water. I think I will add a little more than the 1 tablespoon of flour that is in the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe!

I, too, am always compelled to add my own spin.  I added frozen mango, strawberry, peach mixture.  Instead of brown sugar, I used molasses melted with the butter.  I also added a tsp of cayenne to the apple/fruit mixture.  Served with really good vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of home made chocolate syrup.  Wonderful!

Wonderful! Everyone I have made this for loves it.  I doubled the crust (because it's 'that' good) and used different apples each time (pink lady, ambrosia, etc) and it always tasted good.

JUST what I was looking for!  Only change I made was I halved the sugar in with the apples; next time will eliminate it all together.  Apples are sweet as it is, so extra sugar is unnecessary....was VERY good though.  Will definitely make again!

What a great and easy recipe! I followed it exactly, and my whole family loved it. It was a bit sweet for me personally, but I put a scoop of tart frozen yogurt on it and it was so good. I will definitely be making this again!

I am giving this recipe a 4 WITH my changes. I saw a lot of reviewers say that granny smith works best here, but I already had Gala so I used those. The texture turned out great - the sweetness did not. And on top of that I used HALF of the sugar called for in the apples themselves - I cannot imagine what this would have tasted like with a whole cup! I did also add some nutmeg, which was a nice touch. I also didn't use the 1/2 cup of water, but instead a few tablespoons of orange juice to add tartness, but with all that sugar it still wasn't tart enough for me. As far as the topping - I doubled that and put part on the bottom, If I wanna make this 5 star, next time I will use Granny Smith, cut the sugar down to just a few tablespoons, use orange juice (a few Tbsp) instead of water, NOT double the topping (which I know was my fault, not the original poster's) and cook for an hour. I may also use less butter since it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. Decent basic recipe, just needs a lot of tweaking and DEFINITELY the right apples.

I made this receipe for my boyfriend & friends - and now it is always in demand! Receipe is perfect as is, and also really good if you add half apples/half peaches. My personal preference is to add an extra cup of oats to the topping (as the topping is the best part!) and serve with vanilla ice cream.

This is great. If you want it even easier, just open a large can of peaches (and don't add the white sugar). This always goes fast!!

I doubled the topping as other reviewers suggested, and used only 1/4 c water. This is quite possibly the best dessert I have ever eaten in my life.

This is delicious !
I made it the other day and it is so easy. Next time I will buy the prepared apple slices in my market. I only need enough for 2....
My Hubby thought it was as good as my Apple Pie I will definitely make again :)
Instead of using real brown sugar, I used brown sugar substitute....Yummy !

Excellent apple crisp!  A huge hit!  Used the following user suggestions:  Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture I tossed the apples in.  Added half of the water.  Doubled the crust recipe and cut in the butter instead of melting it.  Yum!

Great recipe!  I omitted the water as well.  I've made it twice so far.  The second time I made it, I added a can of whole berry cranberry sauce to the apples.  The result was tart and sweet.  Loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for a family reunion and there were no leftovers.  Only suggestion is to use tart apples, like Granny Smith, or this dish might be too sweet.

The first time I made it I used melted butter and I didn't have crisp.  The second time I made it I used cold butter and cut it with a pastry blender.  It was crispy on top but too small of pieces.  The next time I make it, I'll cut it with the pastry blender and then grab it and make it chunk together as I spread it over the apples.  Also, you can bake the apples while you make the crisp topping and it cuts down on the total time to prepare.

Made this today.  Cut the recipe in half but kept the topping the same amounts.  Recipe is wonderful but I would recommend that you use double the amount of topping as that is what actually makes apple crisp so great.  Thank you for sharing.  Will be adding to the menu rotation.

First and foremost, thank you for this lovely recipe. My husband pretty much ate half of the casserole dish that I baked it on and he dislikes cinnamon. I pretty much stayed faithful to the recipe but i had to tweak it as I only had 4 apples, (3 fujis and 1 granny smith.) I only put in slightly under half a cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Everything else was the same as instructed and it came out heavenly! Warm and soft on the insides, crumbly and buttery on top. Amazing...

This recipe is great, very simple to make and not really messy. I Know I like my toping thicker so I have to make twice as much. I know this is very sweet and my we are watching our sugar because of diabetes so I used both brown and white sugar replacers.

This was not that good. I think it's strange that it calls for water. Usually the juice from the apples is enough. Plus, it was way too sweet. I did make two mistakes: I added a little too much water (although as I said, I don't think water is a good idea at all) and I used Red Delicious apples because that's what I had. Tart apples are so much better in apple crisp!

Made 1.5 times the topping mix, keeping the amount of apples the same.  Replaced most of the white sugar with brown sugar.  Kept everything else the same.  Must use sour apples, or this will be too sweet. Absolutely delicious!!

This is a 5-star dessert that I have made every fall. We use Cortland apples and dark brown sugar, serve it with vanilla ice cream and get rave reviews every time we make it. One tip: don't cook it until you are ready to serve it. Squeeze a little lemon juice over the apples to minimize browning.

This was rated by my husband... I made a couple of alterations taking into account a few of the suggestions in a few other reviews.  I put the apples in a bowl then put 1/4 cup of water over them, let sit for 5 min.  slowly mixed in the dry ingredients and tossed them letting them sit for 30 min.  Doubled the mix for layer on bottom, used organic sugar and amish rolled buttered cut in pieces on bottom and top instead of melting it.  Also for the crust I finely chopped walnuts and mixed it in well.  It was a hit.

Delicious!! My first try at apple crisp and it was wonderful. Making it again for Thanksgiving this week. I sprinkled chopped pecans on the apples before adding the crisp layer and it was really good!

The flavor was great, but there was too much crust, not enough apples to me when I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again, just add more apples! Serve with vanilla ice cream!

YUM!  Easy recipe to follow.  Cut back a little on the white and brown sugars - maybe 3/4 cup each.  Next time, will cut back to 1/2 cup each.  Added a little extra cinnamon - because we love it.  Also added a dash of nutmeg to the mix.  Will add more oats next time too.  Makes a lot - smells wonderful while cooking and tastes delicious.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Took this recipe to a church gathering.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to make.  I used a softer apple and decreased the baking time so they wouldn't get to mushy.  I prefer the sweetness of a Jonagold, so that's what I used.  I also added flax and oat-bran to the topping.  So yummy!

This recipe was ok.... The entire dish came out too SWEET. It probably contains loads of calories and of course sugar!Because vanilla ice cream makes all apple crisps better I thought it was going to be perfect but it turned out to sweet. I could barely eat a slice with vanilla ice cream. Nice try though.:(

I made this for dessert tonight and it is FABULOUS. I doubled the topping and placed half on the bottom and half on the top. I forgot the water, but I don't think it was needed. The juice was nice and thick. Made some unsweetened cream to top. Again FABULOUS! Will def make again =)

I read @Ally99's review, added her changes (less water, more crumble) and it was AMAZING. the best review i received from my family over any previous crumble.  the only thing i would recommend is not recipe related, but mess related. when i cut butter into things such as pie crumble or crust, i have a surplus box of latex gloves (the thin kind) that i use and put on so that i can crumble and knead the butter into the other dry ingredients  w/o getting my hands messy and it works better than any utensil. when done, just peel off and throw away. back to the crumble. it's so good, it's worth adding an extra two miles to the morning run! there's sooooo much butter and sugar!

Like others, I doubled the topping. I also added just a smidge of  salt as there was none included on the recipe. Very yummy and I will make it over and over again.

This recipe yielded a completely delicious apple crisp!  I made a few modifications:
1 - I added a little extra cinnamon, plus some nutmeg, cloves and ginger.
2 - I put this in a deep dish pie dish and it fit perfectly
3 - Usually people recommend Granny Smith or a tart apple for crisp (or most apple recipes).  We had Jonagold apples from a recent apple picking trip, which almost taste like pears and just made sure to keep the apples a decent thickness.  We peeled the apples, put them through the corer/slicer and then sliced the sections in half.  Perfect!

Like other reviewers I left out the water, and since I cook for two, cut the recipe in half but kept the topping at the full recipe in order to have a higher crisp to apple ratio. Also, I always cook with macintosh apples since my grandma has a few trees in her yard and we have a lot on hand. Remember if you use these apples to use almost twice as many since they are small apples and tend to shrink quite a bit when cooking. I always think my pan is too full but it ends up being just right with 3-4 extra apples thrown in. Finally, the only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is the topping the first time I made it was way too dry, so I cut the flour by a 1/4 cup and I felt it came out perfect the next time.

I would have to say this is the easiest and yummiest apple crisp I have ever made.... my new standby!  
Review Update:

I just made this again and yup, it's still yummy.  What I would say is that indeed, less sugar is better.  Someone else said they made it with peaches, well folks, peaches are a sweeter fruit so you would have to use a LOT less sugar.  For the apple version I cut the sugar content in 1/2.  I really like a fresh, apple tasting crisp/crumble.  But, if you like a really sweet dessert leave the recipe as-is.  Either way, it's really easy and really good!

I thank you for the recipe.  I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake so I made a few changes.  I omited the white sugar and water from the apples; I used the juice from 1 lemon, 1/4 cup molasses, and 1/4 cup pure maple syrup.  I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar for the crumble.  The apple crisp turned out delish!!!  I will make it again.

First time I ever baked and I agree with many of the tips! Absolutely do not need any water and instead of doubling the topping, I would do 1.5 times the amount, it took a little bit away from the apples. I also used 10 medium sized apples, and it worked out great!

I used cheapo red gala apples and this turned out delicious! I doubled the topping. I would rate this only four and a half stars if I could though. The reason why, is because of the water. I really should have listened to other reviewers when they said if you're going to put the water in, only put a quarter cup!! Especially if you are serving with ice cream. The water makes it soupy!! But after scooping around the water.. It is a delicious, easy recipe!!

I used 10 granny smith apples, doubled the crust to make a top and bottom, added a splash of vanilla to the crust, and added some sprinkles of nutmeg to the apples.  It was so delicious.  My husband, who is not a fan of desserts, went back for fifths!  Everyone loved it!

Very good recipe if slightly tweaked.  I found it to be overly sweet when I made it by the recipe so when I made it last night I changed a few things and it was perfect!  First off, make sure you use granny smith apples.. the more sour, the better. I found that the recipe didn't have enough apples so I added 3 extra cups of apples (roughly about two more large apples).  I doubled the crust and didn't add the water as other reviewers said the water is not necessary and just makes this delicious dessert runny.  I also cut the white sugar in half, so on top of adding a few more apples.. I found it to be the perfect combo of tart/sweet.

Excellent.  The classic recipe for Apple Crisp that everyone loves so much this time of year with the cold weather!!  Only thing I changed was I doubled the flour, so 2tbsp instead of 1tbsp in the apple mix, and then I added a little vanilla flavoring in the topping mix.  Excellent, very very very good, and so simple to make! I used a large pan, 9X13 as in the recipe directions.  SO GOOD! Thx for sharing :)

This is a superb recipe!  Simple to make and tastes delicious!  I used Golden Delicious apples with a sprinkle of lemon juice over them.  Doubled the amount of cinnamon.  Otherwise no changes to recipe.  Fed to my husband and Dad - both said it was by far the best crisp they've ever have.  Great job!

I made this for a potluck and told everyone - I'm a great cook! I adjusted the recipe by using cornstarch as the thickener and gluten free bisquick in place of the flour, baking powder, baking soda. The participants at the potluck agreed that I'm a great cook - so thank-you!?

This is the best Apple Crisp recipe I've ever tried.  You get a nice thick crumb on the top and a perfect balance of sweet and nutty!  
Don't venture from the directions...yes, add the water even though it seemed odd to me...and you'll end up with a fabulous dessert.

This was excellent - I used 6 apples and next time I would use 7 as I like a thicker apple base.  I mixed the flour/sugar/cinnamon together, added nutmeg, and tossed with the apples.  I couldn't decide between the reviews that said to use water or not, so I used 1/4 cup of rum instead and sprinkled it over the apples.  I also added nutmeg to the topping and would recommend making 1-1/2 to 2 times the topping.  Don't be afraid to cut the apples thicker, they will bake beautifully. Perfection!

This is a very simple and quick recipe. Nice texture to the crumble. I have never poured water in a crisp before, so I was curious. It prevented the apples from drying out, however it created a sauce like bottom (perhaps the type of apple used), which was not what I was hoping for -I prefer pieces of apples to bite into. Also for my personal taste I found this quite a bit too sweet. My husband thought it was a little too sweet as well. But it is a good basic recipe and I will adjust it for our preferences.

This lives up to all the great reviews! I made this as part of the refreshments for a Mason's Lodge meeting and they all loved it. I doubled the topping and added dried cranberries. I made this a day ahead and popped it in the oven when I got home from work and it was still warm for after the meeting. Topped it with vanilla ice cream. Served it with cheese and pretzels, apple cider and coffee. This is a keeper!

I downsized the recipe by half with the apple mixture but kept the topping the same.. baked it in a smaller pan. Yum and probably the best recipe I have ever made of apple crisp. Will make again!

Not overly fabulous... A little on the dry side- I normally make my apple crisp with just oats, sugar and butter - I think the flour makes it dry-

Awesome recipe! I made this last night on a whim while at my boyfriend's house. I followed the recipe to a T, except for the fact that I didn't use baking powder or baking soda in the crumble simply due to the fact that he didn't have any. It definitely didn't make a difference in the taste or anything. He tasted the finished product and said, "Wow... you nailed the crispy part." He then said after he finished the serving that it was the best apple crisp he's ever had in his life. I will defintely be adding this to my recipe box. I also think that I'll refrain from using the baking powder and baking soda next time as well... it was good as is, and I don't want to "fix" a recipe that already hit a home run. Excellent, excellent recipe.

People suggested to double the crumble mixture... are you serious? It was WAY too much! I will half it next time! Also the butter to dry ingredients ratio is off, there should be less flour I think. And the butter should not be melted, as always.

Delicious.  I am particularly fond of the crisp part so I doubled that.  And my apples had been previously frozen, so I think it would've been better if I had added more flour to the apples to soak up more of the juice.

Wow! eating this as I type...it's YUMMY! Read reviews so I added nutmeg, pecans, cut sugar in half, no water, cut in the butter instead of melting it. Finally I topped it with vanilla ice cream and it tasted delicious! Thanks for the recipe and the reviewers with suggestions to make it even better!

For this one I use just the topping portion. I added several spices to it, the same ones I use in my apple pie; just less of them, so as to not be overpowering. See my Custom Version...: I added a very little smidge of each of the following: Cinnamon, Allspice, Cloves, Nutmeg and Cardamom. I know, they LOOK like Pumpkin Pie spices, and indeed they are, (minus the Ginger & Mace for mine), but Pumpkin does not have the Cardamom, which in my opinion, makes the apple pie what it truly should be.

This is a great recipe. I used seven granny smith apples. After seeing how much topping the recipe made I decided it needed a little bit more. I made the topping recipe again but I cut it in half and it was just enough. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out amazing. Next time I will use granny smith apples mixed with a red variety to balance out the tartness. Perfect recipe for a cool fall day!

I did this in a 8x8 Pan, It took about 4 apples. I stuck with the same measurements for the top layer because I like a thicker top for my apple crisp, It turned out to be the perfect amount.

This was very good and I got a lot of compliments on it!  I didn't add the water but did add 1 TBSP of lemon juice.  I also added nutmeg to the apples.  Use tart apples!   I did double the crust and I am glad I did.   I added cinnamon to the crust also.   Plus....I added about 1/2 TBSP of cinnamon candies to the apple mixture.  I always do this to apple pie and it makes it "zing" a little more.......Oh, and I used regular oatmeal instead of quick-cooking oats.  It gave it a little more texture.

I added more apples than the recipe called for and less of the sugar mixture. I used the exact amount of water in the recipe and it was perfect! The sugar caramelized and it was yummy :) Will definitely be making this again!!!

This was very good!  I made it exactly as described and it turned out great--everyone loved it.  Next time I think I will reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup each, like in a batch of chocolate chip cookies.  I used nice, tart apples, but for my taste it was still a titch too sweet.  However, I had no problem eating it, lol!

Very nice.  Couple changes.  Added nutmeg to sugar mixture.  Added cinnamon to crumble mix and vanilla to the butter.  I used Jonathan apples w/full sugar and it was just right.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  I doubled the crumble.  I did add the recommended water (I used my lemon water I soaked the apples in) and I really wasnt anticipating any extra moisture, and maybe I didnt let it set up long enough before I cut it but I could see excess moisture, so I did probably the unthinkable - which was to sort of break up the crumble topping with a fork - just enough to mix slightly with the apples in order to absorb the moisture.  I thought it worked great.  It tasted great topped with whipped topping.

Delicious.  I made 1.5x the topping, and halved the water, and enjoyed it that way.  Haven't tried the exact recipe, but I can't imagine it would be disastrous.  This is just such a solid crisp... cinnamony, crunchy, smooth, absolutely lovely.  Top it with some vanilla ice cream.

This recipe was delicious! I didn't use the water at all but I think I should've used at least 1/4 cup of water to have a syrop-y consistence. I also added 1/8 teas of nutmeg. I did find that it was more sweet than I anticipated even though I used baking apples. I will use less sugar next time but overall it's a great recipe!

This really is a great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time will add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and only 1/2 of the water.  Everyone that had the apple crisp said it was the best they have ever had.

Awesome.  I left out the water as others suggested, and found the consistency to be perfect.  I used Gala apples and thought it was perfect, though I might try Granny Smiths next time for comparison. Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this tonight, just had a peice while it was still warm, wow, very good! I wished I would have read more in depth on the reviews, I did add the 1/2 cup of water, next time I wont do that. A little to watery. Also I didnt have any oats so I did without, still turned out great! Will make again, but without the water, I might also try to add nutmeg, and double the topping mixture. I used fresh apples that I just picked a few days ago, not sure what kind, they were red, turned out great!

I made this recipe tonight and it was AMAZING!! So simple and so much deliciousness! My husband thought it was the best apple crisp he'd ever had and I couldn't agree more. I didn't change a single thing and it was perfect! Will definitely make this again and again.

Hubby said this is the best apple crisp he has ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly using apples I had on hand.  Next time I will probably seek out some really tart baking apples because it was a bit sweet for me.  Delicious recipe, thank you!!  :o)

Loved this recipe.  Just a suggestion that I like to do with any crumble...right when it comes out of the oven sprinkle with 1 to 2 T of Turbinado (natural brown sugar with big sparkly crystals) for a little added visual pizazz and crunch.

This recipe is very good!  But do not double the topping as I did.  I read the reviews and most of them said to double the topping and as this was my first time making apple crisp and I love sweet things I did.  Even when I was putting it on I thought wow that looks like alot!  It made it way too sweet, and as I said I love sweet things but it was too much.  I also didn't melt the butter, just mixed it in until crumbly and that worked great.  I mixed the sugar, cinnamon and flour with the apples and as another person said, it draws out the juices of the apples so I only added a  splash of water.  Yum!!!

This is amazingly good!  I listened to another cooks suggestion to cut the amount of water in half, doubled the topping and I mixed 3/4 of it in with the appples, the sprinkled the rest on top.  I also cut in softened butter instead of using melted butter.  I bakedit for 50 minutes.  Turned out soooo good!!!!!  Defenately going to be making this recipe a lot!!!!!!!!!!

5 Stars!  Yes the topping was not enough but I will just double it next time.  I used granny smith apples (the best for baking) and it was absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  It you need a tasty dessert in a flash, THIS IS IT!

i made this recipe last night. I scaled it down to one serving (i had 1 apple i needed to use up) and baked it in a custard cup. Perfect size to split with my man.  I did add more cinnamon, and i was kinda concerned after it was done baking it was watery, but letting it sit for a few minutes the "water" was soaked up. It was very good, very comforting dessert. I can wait till fall. I'll definately make this again.

I was not very happy with this recipe even with the adjustments I made. First I used an 8x11 in. pan I cut four large granny smiths and tossed with the sugar/spice mixture (I added 1/4 tsp. Nutmeg to this) then instead of the half cup of water I used one tablespoon vanilla extract and one of water for moisture. This was soooo sweet I can hardly eat it! Also the topping isn't really a crumble it's more like an oatmeal cookie on top which is what I liked least about the recipe. Others have complained of dryness but even using two tablespoons of liquid mine came out very moist I had liquid filling pouring out after the first piece was served. Also I cooked mine for 35 minutes and it seemed overdone to me although my oven is ancient so it doesn't have the most reliable heating mechanism... Overall it was just okay. I won't be making it again because of the sweetness and the cookie like top.

I took the advice of others and cut the amount of water to 1/4c.  I also cut the sugar to 1/2c and added nutmeg to the mixture.  I used an 8X8 pan and my DH and I ate the entire pan late that night.  I had to make it again the next day for the kids because I promised they could have some =)

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made it last night and brought it over to my parents for a small dinner party they were having and everyone raved about it!  It's ridiculously simple too.  My sweet man peeled and cut up the apples which made it easier!  ha!  But he did make wedges versus slices which was good.  Also, I doubled the cinnamon and then made another half batch of the topping.  Awesome!

My whole family agreed that this was the best apple crisp recipe I have ever made.  And I've made my fair share since we live in the Apple Capital of the World!  It is very sweet so use a tart apple like Granny Smith.  I follwed the recipe exactly except for using half wheat flour/half white.

This was a hit! I did follow another reviewers idea of doubling the topping, and making a layer on the bottom of the pan, topping with apples, and then another layer on top of the apples. I also like to sprinkle coconut on top, for a little extra flair. I will be making this one again!!

Excellent recipe! Made this for Thanksgiving for family and has been requested non-stop! Followed the recipe exactly expect used 8 granny smith apples, and per other reviews, left out the water, added a little vanilla extract, and doubled the topping.

I loved this recipe. I substituted 1 tblsp. of ginger instead of using cinnamon. I also let the apples marinate in ginger, lemon+zest, honey, and a dash of salt for about 8 hours. Instead of using 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of the liquid that formed from letting the apples marinate. The flavor was amazing and the end result was a perfect consistency. This is also an easy recipe to convert for people like me who are gluten intolerant. I used a gluten free baking mix instead of flour and Bob's Red Mill gluten free oats.

Made this for our family Xmas dinner.  AMAZING.  Got tons of compliments and my husbanad says it's a full 10 stars, and that's hard to come by in this house!  Do add nutmeg.  Didn't have a problem with it being too watery w the 1/2 cup water, as it will eventually suck all the liquid up anyways...and also double the topping...it's always better to have too much 'goodness' than not enough!

So easy...and the best I've ever made.  Made for family Thanksgiving and even the kids wanted this instead of the cream pies I made.

This was excellent & I'm not a real big fan of apple anything!!  I had a new "apple" baking dish that I wanted to use so I'm not sure that I used the entire 10 cups of apples.  I did add more cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice to the apples & didn't add the water.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe & changing my mind about apples!!

This was my first time making a crisp and I'm hooked on this recipe! A few minor things...I only added 1/4 cup of water and even that was too much for my taste, so next time I wont use any. It was just a bit too sweet(Even with using Granny Smith apples), so I will use 3/4 cup of white sugar next time instead of the full cup. I used self-rising flour and omitted the baking power and soda. Every thing else stayed the same. I will use this every time. So easy, so fast, so good!

mmm another great apple pie! My family gobbled this up. Made as written and I have to agree with it being a little watery but the crisp topping made up for it.  So next time I will cut down the water.

I just made this tonight, I had a bunch of apples I needed to use up and couldn't think of another way to use them. I knew I didn't want to make a pie because the crust would be too time consuming. Oh my gosh this was SO GOOD and SO EASY! I'm not really a fan of apple stuff, I prefer berries. But this was amazing! My husband and I were licking our bowls. I used granny smith and golden delicious apples and only changed a few things: I omitted the water, used probably 6 cups or so of apples (I halved the recipe) added a few sprinkles of lemon juice and nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also used raw sugar instead of white refined sugar in the apple mixture. I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping as well. Put in a 9x9 inch glass baking dish and baked for 45 min. It was perfect with a fat blob of fresh whipped cream on top (none of that non-dairy 'whipped topping' for us!) Heaven!

This was really good and easy to make.  We served it with vanilla ice cream.  I halved the recipe and used 4 apples in a 8x8" pan.  I think I might add a bit more melted butter next time, as my crumb topping was kind of dry.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was terrific, but I changed a few things.  First, I cut the sugar in both the filling and the topping by half.  I think next time I'll cut it down to 1/3 cup in each, depending on the type of apples I use.  If I'm using sweeter apples again I'll also add 1 T. of lemon juice.  I doubled the cinnamon (at least), since we all love cinnamon.  Next time I think I'll add some nutmeg.  I also cut out the baking soda, and didn't melt the butter.  Instead I cut the butter into the oat/flour mixture.  Oh, and I put 1 t. cinnamon into the topping.  My family loved it!

The best apple crisp.  To the sugar mixture added nutmeg, tossed with apples then added the water and tossed, put in buttered pan ( made for easy clean up ) doubled the topping spooned on top and baked as directed.    Used a 4 pound bag if granny smith apples.  It was YUMMY topped with vanilla ice cream.    Warmed leftovers on the defrost setting of microwave next day.   Keeper ! Thanks for a great recipie.

Excellent recipe.  I used 3 large Granny Smith apples which equalled just under 5 cups peeled, cored and sliced into fairly thin slices; prepared 1/4 cup wite sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, 1/2 tsp. cinammon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and combined carefully; NO WATER; Mixed the apples with the sugar/flour mixure coating them evenly and placed the apples in a 9x13 pan;  Doubled the topping as others suggested combining it well however I used cold butter cut into small cubes and mixed it together and then spread evenly over the apple mixture in the pan;  Baked at 350 degrees for 45 - 50 minutes.  Absolutely delicious! Best apple crisp I ever made and will definitely make again for company.  Thank you so much.

This. Was. FANTASTIC.  I only made a few alterations, based on what I had on hand.  First, I love cinnamon with my apples, so I increased from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon.  I probably didn't use 10 cups worth of apples, because I only have 5 apples on hand.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white, as I was out of white flour.  SO FANTASTIC!  Probably one of the best desserts I've made in a long time.  YUM!

I am giving it 4 stars because I made it exactly as the recipe called for. The topping is definitely a 5 though!! I will make this again, but will omit the water as others suggested. I will also cut the sugar to 3/4 C. since it was a bit sweet to me. I used a mix of fresh apples from the orchard, so not exactly sure what all I used.

I thought this was a tasty classic version of an Apple Crisp, however, if you aren't using a tart baking apple like a Granny Smith, the sugar should be decreased a bit- maybe a 1/4 cup.  I used Fugi's because it's what I had, and it was a tad too sweet.  And I think next time I will put the 9x13 with the aaples only in the oven to bake for 10 min or so, and then remove and add the crumble part, so the apple get nice and soft while the crumble doesn't get too dark.

Delicious!  I would agree with some of the others that it didn't need the water.  I would cut down to 1/4 cup or none next time.  Mine was a little runny, but I just spooned out excess liquid after I took the first piece out.  Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely delicious!  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream, which just put it over the top.  I did have to guestimate the pounds of apples because I only made a third of it.  It still turned out perfect and will definitely be made again this Fall.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the advice of many reviewers who doubled the crust and eliminated the water. I also tossed my apples in the sugar and cinnamon mixture. My apple crisp turned out perfect. It was so delicious fresh out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. A lovely fall dessert.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  My husband has me make this for his crew at work at least 4 times a year.  I get plenty of "will you make this again", always a crowd pleaser.  I double the crumble, it makes it a little more chewy.

I'm new to cooking and baking.  I made this recipe last week, and it was AWESOME!!  The hardest part was literally the cutting of the apples, which left me with not one, but two cuts on my thumb.  Totally worth it.  I wanted to make more the second I ate the last bite.

Made this for the second time today at the request of my husband for Father's Day.  This is really a great recipe.  I used 6 Grannysmith apples and 2 Braeburn.  Added only 1/4 cup water, but followed the recipe and it turned out great again.  This will be my go-to Apple Crisp recipe from now on.

Great recipe! After reading other reviews, I also omitted the water and instead of dumping in the mixture for the apples, I mixed it together in a bowl beforehand. I bought a bag of Granny Smith apples and used all of them, I believe it was about 10 apples. Shared some with friends and they loved it also! Will def. make for the holidays!

Not the best apple crisp I've had but it is pretty good. A little too watery for my taste. I suggest omitting the water.

This is the only recipe you will ever need for Apple Crisp!  By far the BEST you'll EVER eat.  I have made this several times and there is no need to change a thing - the ONLY thing I do different is to double the topping because I just can't get enough of that crispy topping.

Delicious! Followed other reviews and decreased the water to about 1/4 cup. Added a bit more oats and flour and butter to the topping as it didn't seem like enough for the amount of apples I was using (6 apples). Also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the apple mixture. I mixed the apple mixture all together in a bowl then put it in the pan before topping it with the topping. Will make again.

It was alright, but the topping was very dry and almost powdery. I will try adding more butter or use less flour next time.

This apple crisp is fantastic!  One of the best I've had.  I did not think the topping needs to be doubled - but I guess that's my personal preference.  Pretty much made the recipe as stated, and turned out perfect.  Served with whipped tpping - thanks for this awesome recipe!

By far the best apple crisp recipe! The topping is so yummy, crunchy with carmelization. I used triple the cinnamon from my cinnamon grinder for extra flavor. I also had to bake for an hour to get the apples to be soft. It was heavenly with vanilla ice cream. The hard part is not eating a gluttonous amount, as it's so yummy, it's hard to put the spoon down!

This was good but not great. I'll keep looking for a good apple crisp recipe. Needed more cinnamon and possibly some nutmeg.

Yummy.  It's a little sweet, but with a little ice cream or whipped cream it great. I followed instructions exactly, but I threw in a bag of frozen cranberries. Used some embarrassingly old spy apples that were about to be dead.

I'd never made apple crisp before, and decided to give this recipe a try. Not only was it easy, it was DELICIOUS! I've made seven batches (fourteen pie pans!) of this in the past two weeks because my friends and family keep asking for it. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

this is my first review on here, but i just had to write something! I'm a big fan of apple crisp so I'm a tough one to please when it comes to recipes. I've tried a whole bunch of recipes on this website but this is the only one i've found so far that deserves a review!  GREAT RECIPE! Very easy, inexpensive... i did cut the sugar down by half...it was definitely a smart choice because the sweetness of the delicious is more than enough.   Also cut down a bit on water but kept everything else in the recipe the same.  If you are making it in a pyrex, its a lot of surface to cover so i would consider making double the amount of topping to ensure each section of the apple base is deliciously covered!

I pride myself on baking and I do alot. This IS the best apple crisp i have ever had.  My husband gave it a 12 out of 10.  I too doubled the topping and i added some nutmeg with the sugar and cinnamon. Other than that i changed nothing and it is AWESOME. Green apples are definitely the way to go.

I made this apple crisp for a coworker's birthday, and it was excellent. I used Granny Smith apples--I bought six huge ones and ended up using five-and-a-half of them. My only addition to the regular recipe was to include 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg as some other reviewers suggested. The nutmeg addition added a noticeable spiciness to the crisp, but I think it would be terrific without the nutmeg and plan to try it that way next time. I also filled the bowl with my apple slices with water and a bit of lemon juice while I sliced the apples. I'm not sure if the lemon transferred at all to the finished dish, most likely not, but it did help keep my earliest slices from getting overly brown as I sliced the rest. All in all, I would definitely make this recipe again, and I highly recommend it. It continued my reputation for baking good things, and I didn't have to cart any leftovers home. Who doesn't appreciate that?

not bad at all!  Followed other readers advice and cut the water down to 1/4 cup, and only 1/2 a cup of sugar. Also I didn't use 10 cups of apples, just 6 cups and it worked out well.  I will make this again forsure.

I made a few minor adjustments - I mixed the apples with the sugar mixture before placing them in the pan, then sprinkled with extra cinnamon. I did not add the water because I thought it would be too runny. It turned out great, will make it again.

This was the hit of all the Christmas Day desserts.  I tweaked the topping just a bit by using 1 1/2 c. of oatmeal, chopped walnuts and some nutmeg.  The topping was a bit dry.  I think the extra oatmeal was unnecessary.  Very good though.  Oh, I did leave out the water in the apples.

Awesome!  I followed the advise of others and omitted the water and added nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar.  I tossed about 1 tblsp. of lemon juice in the apples before putting them in the mixture, and doubled the topping.  It is perfect!

Wow is this good! Per many reviews, I added 1/4c water, doubled the topping and cut in the butter cold rather than melting. Also added 1 c chopped pecans to the topping which is a must if you like nuts!  I used both quick cooking and regular rolled oats and it worked fine!!

I really enjoyed my first attempt at this.  As with some of the other reviews, I doubled the crust and put some at the bottom and some at the top.  I also tossed the apples with the cinnamon sugar mix (and added nutmeg).  I omitted the water - but really on accident (had it ready but forgot), and it turned out well.  I mixed everything in for the crust (and added 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the crust).  I also used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar (so, doubled the crust, but didn't double the brown sugar).  Them I poured in most of the melted butter (reserved around 1/4th of the 1 cup).  With doubling the crust, I put more of it on the bottom (60% or so) than on the top.  Then before I added the crumbled crust to the top, I mixed in the additional butter.  This came out great.  I look forward to trying it again (I'll add Chinese 5 spice next time!!).

this is WAY better than my old apple crisp recipe. i used 5 granny smith apples and 5 cortland apples. i tossed the apples in the sugar mixture. i also added some nutmeg, and reduced water to 1/4 cup. it was not watery at all, but i think it would have been with the full amount. increased topping to double the amount. the topping was REALLY good. very pleased, thank you!

I can stop looking - this is the best apple crisp I have ever made. I used a little less water and added a pinch of nutmeg to the apples, but other than that didn't change a thing. This is now my go-to recipe whenever I need to make apple crisp. Thanks!!!

I have made this 2 times on 1 week!  I LOVE it!  The only change I made was not using any water.  The juices from the apples were enough to keep it moist.  I think the water would have made it too runny.

This was a delicious and easy recipe!!! I used the tip from another review and used 1/4 cup water and double the topping. I used granny smith apples and tossed them in the flour/sugar/cinnamon mix before spreading them in the pan. Once in the pan i then sprinkled the water over the apples. I also used nutmeg and instead of the melted butter i used cold butter and cut it into the topping mix to ensure a crumbly topping and it worked great!!!! Hope my tips helped!!!!! I will make this recipe again~it was flawless!!!!

I have been looking for a good apple crisp recipe for a while. In my search I have tried a few good ones, but this one is the clear winner. It is so simple, and all the ingredients are something most people are likely to have on hand. I didn't have as many apples as the recipe called for (about half), but based on the many reviewers who doubled the toppings, I decided to keep the toppings the same. It was so delicious. The toppings melt and brown into caramelly crispy goodness, that is just heavenly with the apples. I have found my crisp recipe. I will be making it with pears tomorrow. Thanks!

Loooove this!I used 6 granny smith apples and piled them in a pie plate rather than a 9x13 dish. Instead of butter I used Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks. Worked great! The topping turns out nice and crunchy and I threw in some salt, cinnamon and nutmeg for a little added spice. I also reduced the sugar in the apples to 3/4 cup since the topping is very sweet. Probably could even do with only 1/2 cup sugar. My apples were very tart and the crisp still came out nicely sweet, almost a bit too much. Definitely do not add any water..the juice from the apples combined with the sugar is more than enough to make a beautiful filling. I love this recipe..it's so easy and came out great..fool-proof baking instructions as well. Thanks!

Made this to the recipe. Everyone raves about this one. The topping is fantastic! I am always looking to use up the apples off the tree this time of year. The added water was way too much for me. It may be the type of apple used. The filling part of the crisp is not bad. Needs more cinnamon and sugar for my apples. All in all, good recipe, I'll adjust and make again, thanks.

I only used about a 1/4C. of water and did 1 1/2 times the crust.  I partially melted my butter but then worked it in with a pastry blender... REALLY REALLY GREAT!!!  Great crunch with a carmel taste to the mixture,  a fantastic recipe!

Great recipe! I took some suggestions and doubled the topping the first time I made it but my husband said "It would be perfect if you would just cut the topping in half" lol so next time I made it, I followed the recipe to a T and it was great. Thank you!!

This is the BEST apple crisp ever!  I did double the topping, added 1 tsp of nutmeg, & no water.  This is amazing!  I wish I wouldn't have offered any to my neighbors, as now it is almost gone!  This will be the only apple crisp I will make in the future.

Absolutely wonderful...I used Jonagold apples I got from Walmart...they are a kind of Johnathan Apple..because Jonagold is a juicy apple I didn't add any water to the recipe and like some of the reviews are saying DON'T double the topping part...in my opinion it would definitely overwhelm the apples and dish would be way way too sweet. Except for ommiting the water and adding four tablespoons of flour to the apples {because Jonagold apples are so juicy) I followed the recipe as written. It turned out perfectly...  Will definitely make again...I served the Apple Crisp with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...Yummmy....  Thank you so much for such an easy AND great recipe.

This is by far the best crisp recipe I have tried yet; the right amount of everything, but I did add a teaspoon of nutmeg; so yummy! Goes perfect with vanilla ice cream. Thanks Diane - this one is going in the "Family Faves" box for sure!

super easy. i halved the water and mixed the apples with sugar before laying them in the pan. my mom devoured the entire pan within two days! didnt even need ice-cream but i could see how if it was available, it would be heaven in a bowl. besides the melted butter, the recipe isnt all that bad for you either!

This is the best apple crisp I have had. I mixed the apple slices with the cinnamon and sugar instead of sprinkling it over the top. I also added a pinch of salt to the cinnamon sugar mixture. Doubling the topping is a must!

This was great! I made this yesterday to take to a party last night, I am so glad I picked this recipe (I've never made an apple crisp before). It was one of the first desserts gone! My little changes were : Only used 1/4 c water, cut white sugar down to maybe 3/4 c, added a little vanilla and couple shakes of cinnamon to the topping. Added a little nutmeg to the apple mix, which I shook all that up with the apples instead of sprinkling on top. Still have apples left and thinking about making again :)

Great recipe!!  Can use this if you are short on apples.  I used only 5 cups of apples, but used the same amount of topping.  The extra "crisp" MADE this dessert.

Followed recipe exactly!!! It is just absolutely perfect as it is, no messing with it, OH, except I did add some nutmeg to the apples mixture and again in the topping. THEN I discovered we have a 'rat' in the house when I went to check on it to see if it had cooled off (after movie had ended, I had taken it out of the oven during the movie "Hero") - a big HUGE corner (like... 1/8 of the entire pan) had been sneaked into and eaten while I was using the restroom after the movie!!!  A 2-armed, 2-legged 'rat' who has claimed he doesn't like desserts!!! *lol*  So, I had to try it too, I ended up eating the other 1/8 of the same end of the pan.  Wonderful recipe, I'll have to make another dessert tomorrow (this was supposed to be for a Women's Conference tomorrow - will make another one!)

Very good. When I took it out of the oven I thought it was going to be too runny but after it cooled all of the juice thickened into a nice moist crisp. I added cinnamon into the topping but otheriwse made the recipe as stated.

This is the most delicious apple crisp my husband and I have ever had! I'm 29 and this was my first attempt at making apple crisp ever and obviously it turned out great. The only thing I did different to the recipe was add the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in with the cinnamon and double the crust, like some of the other reviewers had suggested. My husband and I really love a lot of crust on apple crisp-this is the only reason I decided to double it.

This is a great recipe! Here's the approach I took: I used a combination of whatever apples I had on hand, as well as a handful of Craisins. I opted not to peel the apples. I really liked the added color and texture! I forgot to add the 1/2 c of water before cooking, and the crisp looked a bit dry around the 40 minute mark, so I went ahead and poured it in around the sides of the crisp. I also poured an extra 1/2 c of melted butter over the top at that same point to help the top crisp. Total cooking time came to around 55 minutes. Served hot with vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it!

Definitely the BEST apple crisp I've ever had!  I followed some suggestions, I only used 5 Granny Smith apples, in an 8x8 inch pan. (So I halved the recipe, except for the crust.) We loved having a nice thick crust. Oh, and we didn't add any water, added some nutmeg, and it came out perfect! Thank you Diane!

I volunteered to make apple crisp to bring to a friend's cookout.  I found this recipe and made it just as it was written and it was a hit with everyone.  Next time I think I will leave out the water because I'm not sure what it adds if you have juicy apples.  I used a combination of Granny Smith and fuji apples.  We served it at room temperature and it was delicious.

What a yummy recipe! I did not change a thing, but will only add a couple tablespoons of water next time, as oppossed to the 1/2 cup that is called for. I used early season Macintosh apples, as we have a ton of them right now here in Michigan. They have the perfect tart flavor to compliment the sweetness of this recipe. I will definitely be making this again and again!

Absolutely the best apple crisp! I've only tried one other apple crisp from this site....this one blows it away! I made some caramel sauce (from Sweetened Condensed Milk) and drizzled it over the top when the crisp had about 15 minutes left to bake. This is a keeper! Thanks, Cyndi Gephart for telling me I had to try this one.

Mmmmm, love this from the top to the bottom. My suggestion is to use two different apples. One sweet and one a bit tart. We enjoyed.

This will be my apple crisp recipe from now on.  It is soooo good.  Read a lot of reviews and ended up with these simple alterations.  I skipped the water (although how could a little more goop be bad!).  I added 1/4 cup lemon juice to the apples.  I added a pinch of salt to the crumb topping mix and just cut in softened butter.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! We really enjoyed this dessert. I halved the amount of sugar and I think it would have been too sweet for us if I have added all the amount of sugar.

I used a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice for the spices, and just used a sprinkle of water on the apples. Other than that as written, awesome recipe -- best apple crisp I ever made, thanks!

Fabulous!  I made 1/2 the recipe and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and followed the recipe.  Granny Smith apples were tart with the crisp sweet and a little crunchy.  Next time I may add a little extra sugar over the apples and a little more water to get more "sauce" and the crisp was so good I'll have to increase that!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this recipe but only gave it 4 stars.  My reason why is the amount of sugar.  Being an award winning cook myself, I realized that this is way too much sugar.  When using granny smith apples, I cut both the white and brown sugar in half.  It was plenty sweet and more carb friendly.  I also used Apple Pie Spice instead the cinnamon.  With some adjust to this recipe for your own personal taste, this can be a tasty crisp.

I halved the apple filling, but made the full crumb recipe.  Also, I decreased the water by a little bit as a result of the reviews I read.  The result was great.

Very good. All my colleagues were clamouring for more... might want to reduce the white sugar in the apples though, I reduced to 1/3 cup and it was still nice.

Very good, but also very sweet the way it is written. The 2nd time I made it, I added 3-5 cups extra apples and it was outstanding. Also sliced apples VERY thin with mandoline.

This was very tasty overall & it went over well with my small group - they cleared the dish!  Next time, I'll double the topping portion, especially if using a 9x 13 pan - this barely covers the top. I used mostly Granny Smiths (great for this since they don't get too mushy & keep some of their firmness) & a few Rome's.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe got great reviews from my friends and family. I made it twice in one week! I doubles the crust and put a layer on the top and bottom. I tossed the apples with the apple mixture in a large bowl before putting it into the pan. I added half the water the recipe calls for because the apple mixture seemed to create enough moisture. I also used granny smith apples as recommended by others.I will definitely be making this again!

I added LESS sugar, a bit of nutmeg, and more cinnamon to the apples, then added some "craisens" (cranberry raisens) because I like the tartness - - yummy - even my super picky Mother asked for the recipe. A keeper for sure - even better the next day warmed up.

I have made this several times and it is absolutley delicious!  I doubled the crust on top and put very little water in the apples.  The apples create enough of their own juices.

I will be using this apple crisp recipe from now on..but with these modifications: 1/2 C sugar w/ the apples - this is plenty unless you have a serious sweet tooth.
Mixed the cinnamon/sugar/flour w/ apples before putting in the pan - it draws out the juices.
Omitted the 1/2 C water, just sprinkled a little over the apples since the only time I've used water with apples was to make applesauce and even then, not very much.
Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the topping.
Results were delicious...YUM

Have mercy...this is the BEST crisp EVER!! I pretty much followed the recipe to the T...I just added 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar to apples. Along with cinnamon and nutmet and a dash of vanilla! I then doubled the topping.  I put a little on the bottom then layered the apples, then finished off with the rest of the topping!!  GOOD EATING...then topped it with fresh vanilla ice cream!!  You can't beat this!!  Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

I love this recipe! Since discovering it last week, I have made it 4 times and it never lasts more than a few hours. I did make a few minor changes though...I mix the sugar, flour and 1.5 tsp of apple pie spice (in place of the 1 tsp of cinnamon)and mix the apples in it instead of sprinkling it over. I also omitted the water. No need for it.
 I love the crumb topping so the first time I doubled the recipe, per some other reviewers advice and I thought it was incredible, but my family thought it to be too much crumb topping to apple filling ratio. So now I make it according to the recipe instead of doubling it. There is still plenty of topping and my family eats it up just as fast, if not faster!!

We are invited to one of my first extended family "inlaw" parties. Everyone must bring a "fall" dish to share and I'm a little nervous. My husband and dear neighbors have been sampling apple desserts all week.  This was the unanimous winner. In fact my neighbor just printed off the recipe to make for her family. It is excellent. Especially the topping. I only made a few changes. I substituted apple cider for the water and cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup because of that. If you like cider it really gives the recipe a little extra zip. Thank you.

This was awesome- empty pan already! 
I followed other suggestions: doubled topping, adding some cinnamon, and nutmeg. I mixed green and red apples, and the red were mushy. I've already been asked to make it again. It is very easy to make, I used the little gadget that slices/cores apples in one action, then peeled the 8 little slices separately, it went very fast that way.

This is wonderful! I halved the sugar and upped the spices (added ginger, nutmeg, cloves). I used whole wheat flour, added a bit of lemon juice and some blackstrap molasses. It is SO good, we've already almost eaten all of it.

Apples have been my "thing" lately, due to a trip to a local orchard.  My boyfriend and I have them for every meal!  He is a huge fan of desserts, and this was PERFECT to satisfy his sweet tooth.  The only thing I changed was adding about a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  Will DEFINITELY use this again!  Thanks!

My preschooler went on an apple-picking field trip and came home with a huge bag of orchard fresh apples.  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could--it was so good!!  I'm not sure what kind of apples they were but they were very firm and a little tart so I added the full amount of sugar.  I read several reveiws that debated the amount of water to add or to even add any at all.  I finally settled on an idea from another baked apple dessert I've made, orange juice.  Since there are only two adults in my house eating this I mixed up the apples with the sugar mixture in one big bowl, squeezed in the juice from half of a very juicy orange and even threw in about a tsp of orange zest.  Then I dumped a third of the apples in a pie plate and the other two thirds into an 8x8 pan.  I made about 1 1/2 times the crumb topping, topped both pans, then I froze one pan and baked the other.  This dessert was WONDERFUL.  I let it rest for 10-15 minutes, topped it with a big scoop of ice cream and drizzled caramel over it all.  Almost worth skipping dinner for!!!

I was so hungry for apple crisp and this was perfect.  I had sweet juicy apples (lots!) so I decreased the amount of plain white sugar and water and it came out just right.  Filled the pan perfectly, just the right amount of topping.  Easy enough for the kids to help with and delicious right out of the oven with ice cream.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Absolutely yummy.  In reality I would have to give the Crisp at 4.5.  I used a melange of apples - Fugi, Gala, and Granny Smith.  Each has a different texture and taste.  I doubled the topping as others have mentioned and decreased the water to 2 tablespoons.  I believe I might increase the cinnamon to 1 1/4 teaspoons the next time I make it.

very good, tasty, simple.  I liked the soft apples under the crunchy topping.  Adding the water did that, but it really depends on the wetness of your apples if it gets mushy.

As i read previous review, i made slight changes for this recipe. I cut half amount of sugar for the crisp  and only use 1/4 cup sugar for the apple filing (I convert all white sugar into brown sugar). Add generous cinnamon & nutmeg plus i mix raisins which i'd soak in them in rum overnight. IT really brings out the rich flavor! Also i didn't melted the butter, just mix them with dry ingredients until crumbled. One more thing, i use corn flour for the filling mixture, not all purpose flour..I learn this while making apple pie filling, since i like the texture i use it for this recipe too..Don't forget to double the crisp recipe, it won't cover all the surface if you use the original recipe..I also spread a thin layer of the crisp batter before topping them with the filling..Enjoy em with ice cream, Hemmmmmm...Marvelous!!! Note: Use Grainy Smith apples and to save time, just put them in the food processor.

With the cool fall air moving in, I had been craving apple cobbler or crisp.  I wanted to try a new recipe and WOW, was this amazing. I made it as written with one modification.  I only used 1/4 cup of water. I didn't have ice cream so I topped it with fresh whipped cream and it was delicious.  Thank you!!

This is sooo good!!!!  I couldn't wait till it was done.  The aroma was to dye for.  I did make a few changes.  Because I used frozen apples, I omitted the water and I added nutmeg.  I will be making this again.

Really really good! Everyone seems to have differing opinions on whether water should be used or not but I think it depends on the juiciness of your apples. If you cut up your apples and they seem a bit dry, use a little water. If they seem very wet and juicy, don't use it. I used gala apples and I also had some leftover homemade cranberry sauce that I added between my apple mixture and crumble mixture. Gala are sweet apples and the cranberry sauce offset that very nicely! I added the bit of nutmeg to the apples as another reviewer suggested, but stuck to the recipe otherwise and it was FABULOUS! Me and my husband ate two bowls each, warm and topped with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderful as is!  Even with the water added it still turns out great.  When first served after baking it may seem a bit runny but the following day after it sets it is amazing!!!  I tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and added more cinnamon to that.  I also added some cinnamon to the topping.  My husband says it's the best crisp I've ever made.  Thank you!

This was excellent.  Not exactly sure that I would add the water again - don't know that it served any purpose except to make it mushy.  I did want it to be alittle firmer if that makes sense... but the flavor was incredible.

I've just began cooking for a household of 8 and this is one of the more popular recipes.  There's a taste for everyone.  My fiancee (who thinks apple pie is too terribly sweet) loves this.  He had 3 plate fulls before he stopped!  His brothers and sisters loved this, too.  As everyone else, I did some tweaking:  I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, and apple pie spice.  I also added some maple syrup to give it a "warm flavor."  As always, I microwave before serving and toss some cool whip on top.  I eyeballed the amounts, added to taste (if you do this, make extra apple so you won't be subtracting from the dish).  *Note:  Add some fresh ginger if you want a little spice to the dish.  Ginger blends amazingly well with the flavors and whatever cream used to compliment this (milk, ice cream, cool whip) will be enhanced with the ginger.

I tried this the way most did - 1/2 the water, added nutmeg and doubled the topping. I also added pecans to the top. Next time I will add the pecans to the dry mix and butter first because the pecans were just really dry on top. I may also try to cut the butter instead of melting. I also, like most, mixed the apples with the sugar mix before putting it in the pan. I think the flavor was really good until I added the ice cream. That I don't recommend!

Review #1206, huh? Well, as if another 5 stars really matters, this is a GREAT recipe! I followed the recipe *exactly* as written and it was just lovely. The apples were delicious and perfectly baked. The topping was crisp and delectable. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Thanks so much!

This recipe is truly wonderful! But I did take some advice from other reviewers and also did some changes of my own, here is what I did: First of all I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings because 12 would have been too much. I doubled the recipe for the crumb topping (do not melt the butter all of the way, only have the butter partially melted, you will have a crispier topping this way) and I put about a 1/3 cup of the crumb topping on the bottom of the baking pan (before putting the apples in) or put in just enough to coat the bottom. For the apples I mixed together the cinnamon mixture with the apples in a bowl so that the apples were evenly coated. Once I had everything assembled  I cut up 1 tablespoon of butter into pieces and placed it on top of the crumb topping. I baked it for almost an hour and it came out perfect! Enjoy! 03/31/08: You can make this in advance. I made two batches and baked them the next day at work and they turned out great!

I tried to incorporate some of the suggestions of other reviewers; used Granny Smith apples, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, added some nutmeg, and doubled the crust for one on the bottom and one on the top. Wish the topping was crispier. I think next time I'll use a little more apples too. It was gone in no time! The next time I cut the white sugar to 1/2 c., because I only had a couple Granny Smith and the rest Fuji. I cut the cinnamon to just over 1/2 tsp., because a whole tsp. just seemed to overwhelm the other flavors, and left out the nutmeg. I softened the butter and cut it into the rest of the crumble ingredients then stirred in about 3/4 c. chopped pecans, because we love pecans in everything! Also after placing half the apple mixture in the baking dish I sprinkled a layer (about 14-15 oz.) of fresh cranberries, then the remaining apples and crumble topping. It looked really pretty through the sides of the clear glass baking dish. Sooooooo delicious too; especially warm with some really good vanilla icecream on top. I highly recommend this recipe with or without the cranberry layer.

I must agree with the majority of the people on this dessert.  It was perfect!  I used 8 granny smith apples and sliced them thinly in the food processor.  I tossed the apples in the sugar mixture just to coat them, and omitted the water.  I also doubled the crust recipe and put half on the bottom, then the layer of apples, then the other half on the top.  It was wonderful!  Served with cold vanilla bean ice cream and a cup of smooth coffee.  Mmm good!

Loved this recipe, but changed the following.  Substituted 1 cup of splenda for the white sugar and used the splenda brown sugar mix (1/2 cup) instead of regular brown sugar.  Also cut the water in half.  Turned out great and didn't taste sugar free at all.

I used 1/4 a cup of water and coated the flour mixture. For the topping, I added 1/4 a teaspoon of nutmeg, and used regular oats, as I did not have quick cooking oats. It still turned out great!

DELICIOUS APPLE CRISP! I used a bag of Empire red apples (Granny Smith's are too bitter for me) and it came out great! My only changes after reading reviews from others: I used 1/4 cup of water instead of the recommended 1/2 cup. I also added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and instead of sprinkling the sugar, flour, cinnamon mixture over the apples, I coated the apples in the mixture to make sure that they were well blended. This Apple Crisp recipe is delicious and I will definitely use it again!

This was really good!  I couldn't imagine leaving the water out, because it really makes a nice sauce for the apples. If you want more of a crumb topping, cut the amount of butter in half, and don't melt the butter, just soften it a bit. Cut the butter into the flour/oat mixture with a pastry cutter until you have incorporated it throughout and it resembles coarse crumbs. I used three Gala apples, thinly sliced and left the skin on.  Didn't see the need to go through the effort of peeling.  Then I cut the amount of the ingredients to go with the apples in half.  Used the same amount of ingredients for the topping though, because I love double topping. :-) My husband and I absolutely loved it and I will definitely make this again.

Using melted butter in the topping produced the best results I have ever experienced, and I've tried at least 10 different crumbles. Fabulous recipe.

No other way to describe it but DELICIOUS! I used only 3/4 cup of white sugar and omitted the water and used 1/4 apple juice with a generous teaspoon of vanilla. I will definitely make this again very soon.

I made this for a few hard working sailors at the end of their work day. I made extra so that they could each take home leftovers if they so desired. Within 10 minutes the entire pan was empty and I was begged to make more that evening from my fiance, and even more for the sailors the next day! This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted!

This was so easy and so good.  I used golden delicious apples that were going soft on me.  I was worried that they would be too soft and too sweet but they were fantastic.  I only used a 1/2 cup of brown (not white) sugar in the apples and 1/2 cup of apple cider instead of water.  I added 2 T. of lemon juice and 2T. of vanilla.  I could have used more liquid.  I guess it depends on how juicy your apples are.  I didn't melt the butter, just softened it and added it to the other ingredients in a bag and kneaded them together.  There was plenty of crumble, although I only had enough apples to cover the 9" x 11".  I served this with ice cream and caramel sauce because that is how we serve apple pie around here.  Everyone ate it up.

Thanks, Diane, for a delicious apple crisp!  I did end up having to increase the butter when I spread the crumbly topping over the apples. Without the extra butter, it would have been too dry. Otherwise, it was very good.  I cut the recipe down for just my husband and myself. My husband was very disappointed when he realized I had eaten the leftovers the next day. I guess I'd better make more the next time so we can both have seconds!

I made this just as stated, only I did not measure the cinamon. I thought this turned out WONDERFUL. It was not runny at all like others said. Next time, and there WILL BE a next time... I will change only that I will peel the apples as I didnt this time, and I  will too double the topping recipe, and place some under and on top.  The crunch was my favorite part, I may just make THAT next time!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and it is the very best. Why everyone changes recipes and then reviews them I just don't know... There's no need for any changes, the recipe is perfect the way it is!

My whole family loved this recipe.  I substituted wheat germ for flour and 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce for butter.  I cut the sugar to 3/4c brown and 3/4c white.  Even more delicious with the healthy substitutions.

This is so good, I made a few minor changes but this is a great recipe overall!  I used very tart apples and I still only used about 1/3 cup sugar to mix in with the apples, I think a full cup would be too sweet.  The crisp topping was awesome! I also baked this recipe in my crockpot on low for about 4 hours!  It was enjoyed by everyone at the cookout that I brought it to!

Wow! This apple crisp was so yummy.   The only change I made was only adding 1/2 cup of water, instead of 1 cup.   My family enjoyed it alot and I will be making this again.

I have made this numerous times but not exactly following the recipe. I like to cut the topping in 1/2 and put it over a can of cherry pie filling or apple pie filling in a 8x8 or 9x9 pan. Make sure you break up the topping or you get hard chunks. This is a great topping but I never had the patience to make the filling from scratch.

Great recipe...........
Upon reading others reviews I tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and added a tsp. of ground nutmeg, then layered the apples in he bottom of the baking dish.  I halved the amount of granny smith apples and substituted the remaining apples for rhubarb.  I used a little bit more brown sugar than the recipe called for as the rhubarb was not sweetened.  45 minutes was the perfect baking time.

My son requested apple crisp for dessert on Easter so I tried this recipe.  I wasn't sure about adding the water since none of my other crisp recipes called for it. I did add only 1/4 cup.  It didn't need it at all.  It came out a little watery but I just drained it off after baking.  Very delicious.  I thought the topping was the perfect amount but my husband liked it so much he thought it could use more. I will make this again.

This was DELICIOUS.  I will definitely make it again.   I used granny smith - the tartness worked well in the recipe.  The changes i will make the next time - double the topping, reduce the sugar that goes on the apple, cook for 35 minutes rather than 45.  Personally I like big pieces of apples than thin slices. Another modification i will make is cut the water in half as others have suggested.

This was my first attempt at making apple crisp.  I bought 7 granny smith apples, which I thought would be enough but it only ended up being 8.5 cups.  I used 1/4 cup of water and doubled the topping as others suggested (and then didn't quite use all of it because I had fewer apples).  I also added too much cinnamon by mistake.  Even after all of this it turned out great!  The apples were the perfect texture--not too soft, not too hard.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was a real hit at the party I brought it to.  Yum!

This is a great recipe. I omitted the water and instead I let the apples sit in the sugar mixture (with a drop of lemon) for about 15 minutes before adding the topping. I halved the sugar and added pecans to the topping. Also, I brushed melted butter over the top after it was almost finished to crisp even more. I will definitely make this again!

I bought too many apples, but I'm glad I did. The first batch I made smelled sooooo good when I set it on the stovetop to cool I couldn't resist and ate a piece....Made up the rest (1/2 recipe) and am not going to share! This was WONDERFUL! Don't need to tweak a thing it was just great!

I've made this dish serveral times. It always turns out properly and people just scarf it down. I usually double the topping ingredients because they are my favorite part of the crisp. Highly recommend.

Very tasty.  I think better as it sits a little.  Make sure to PEEL and slice the apples very thin.  I used an apple corer and slicer and cut those slices in half, but they were still not thin enough. About 1/8 inch would be good.  Also, I would recommend adding a tsp or two of pure vanilla extract to the water for a little more flavor. I made a half recipe, but still used the full amt of topping, and it was slightly too much, but better too much than not enough. Also, I used 1/8 cup of water, but I think 1/4 would have been better, as it was a little dry for our tastes. Probably had dry Granny Smith apples though.

This was really good!  I halved the recipe but kept the topping the same...glad I did!  Used Harrelson apples and threw in a small handful of cinnamon chips before the topping went on and it made a delicious dessert.  Thanks much!

VERY TASTY! but make sure you peel the apples as well as slicing them. It did not cross my mind until it was done and it looked liked sauteed green pepper crisp. It really did not change the flavor, just the eye appeal. Also after slicing i put lemon juice on the apples so they wouldn't turn. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly (just cut as many apples as needed to fill the dish) and it was wonderful and really easy!

I FORGOT TO ADD IN MY LAST REVIEW THAT INSTEAD OF POURING THE MIXTURE OF SUGAR, CINNAMON, AND FLOUR ON TOP OF THE APPLES IN THE DISH, TO TOSS THE APPLES IN THE MIXTURE IN A BOWL, THEN PUT IN DISH AND PUT TOPPING ON.

Very Good. Thanks for the recipe. I substituted 1/2 Cup of Splenda and used only 1/2 Cup of Sugar. I also used Splenda Brown Sugar. It came out great and no one even noticed that it was lower in calorie.

This recipe was perfect!  The compliments didn't stop all evening.  Besides peeling and slicing all the apples, it was a snap to make as well.  Thank you, this is going to be THE recipe for me :-)

This is the best apple crisp recipe I've made.  The topping tastes like oatmeal cookies.  I didn't have quick-cooking oats, so I used old-fashioned oats and it still turned out great.  The only problem I had was that the apples were too mushy; I won't bake it as long next time.

Wonderful apple crisp. I did use a few of the other reviewer's tips. I reduced the water by half, doubled the topping, and added pecans to the topping. It was wonderful. I could not get enough!

I made this for a group of women and everyone of them asked for the recipe.  I doubled the apples and it was perfect.  I also didn't add the water and it was perfect.  I doubled the crust recipe but didn't use it all.  I also added 1 T. cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon juice to the sugar mix and apples.  I will definately make this one again!

This crips smells like heaven!  Tastes super yummy with vanilla ice cream.  I also doubled the crisp part, but didn't quite use it all.  Came out perfectly delicious.  I used mostly granny smith apples and added a couple of honeycrisp apples for their flavor.  I'll be making this again.

Turned out a little too moist. Maybe I did something wrong but the flavour was very nice. With a large scoop of vanilla icecream melting on top everyone gobbled it up. I'll try the recipe again.

I just pulled this crisp out of the oven and held my breath because Woops! I forgot to add the water! It looked pretty juicy so I scooped some onto a dish, added vanilla ice cream and it is just heavenly! The crunchy topping is the best part of it (which honestly I was picking at before I added it to the apples, which may be the reason I forgot the water). I will make this again and again - but I think next time I may add just a bit more cinnamon. A perfect dessert for a cool autumn day. Thank you Diane!

This was a very good recipe.  I cut the water to 1/4cup and doubled the topping, like others had mentioned.  Cutting the water worked fine, the apples were perfectly crisp and the gooey insides were just right.  There was definitely lots of topping.  I used Honeycrisp apples and they were fabulous. Everyone liked it.  Will do this one again.

This was one oooey gooey treat.  After one serving i had a tummy ache.  It was definately one of the better crisps i have ever had.  I was about 1 1/2 cups shy of the necessary apples and i only aded 1/4 cup water.  It was a bit on the dry side but i think that extra cup of apples would have fixed that.  I wish the toping was bit crunchier but it was still good. Will definatly make again

OUTSTANDING.  Thanks for this very easy and very delicious recipe.  I used half white sugar and half Splenda. I added 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla. I did add the water and it was perfect; not at all thin as other reviewers mentioned. I used Granny Smith, Fuji and Rome apples. Great both warm or cold. This is a keeper!

A fabulous tasting recipe! But "please" dont add the water!  Mine was thin and I didnt even add water based on the most helpful reviews.  I made this for a potluck last night and I'm going to try and make this again for a Send-Off party tonight.

OH MY..This is so good and so easy. I don't know why I expected it to be hard..but this was an easy recipe. I used McIntosh and used my mandoline for quick slicing. I doubled the topping and left the white sugar and water as stated..it wasn't too sweet..It was awesome! Thank you.

This was a perfect apple crisp recipe and really easy too!  I used 5 granny smith apples and put them into a pie dish and didn't double the topping recipe and it came out with just the right amount of crisp to apple.  I also reduced the amount of water and it didn't come out soupy.  Thanks for a great, easy and quick dessert!

I found it strange to be adding water and sure enough it came out like soup. It was better the next day after being in the fridge but still runny... and a little too sweet (using golden delicious apples). Next time I would leave out most of the water and lighten up on the sugar.

I was looking for a way to use the yummiest peaches that I bought from Costco.  I used them instead of apples in this recipe.  Keep the sugar the same, no cutting back like on the apple version.  I did cut back on the cinnamon.  I also did 1 1/2 on the topping as suggested.  Glad I did, could have even possibly doubled it.  Turned out great out, will make again.

First of all I have to say there are no words to describe this VERY delicious recipe. It's the best Apple Crisp I've ever had. I am known for altering all of my recipes to make them lower in fat, calories, etc. so I used 3/4 C Splenda and 1/4 C Sugar for the sugar, I used light margarine instead of regular butter whole wheat flour for half of the flour amount. It turned out terrific, we can't get enough of it at our house. And warmed with vanilla frozen yogurt on top- you've gone to heaven. Thank you Diane!!

This was a great recipe.  My family and I fully enjoyed eating this Apple Crisp, the only thing I would change is the amount of sugar.  I think a little less white sugar would be better, but thats just for my personal taste.  Otherwise this is a winner!

Fabulous!  Took this to a pot luck and everyone loved it.  People went for the chocolate cake first, but when they tasted this apple crisp it disappeared! I did make 1 1/2 batch of the topping, as suggested by many others.

Absolutely perfect!  I used six medium sized Granny Smith apples with the full amount of sugar.  I omitted the water, added dashes of nutmeg to both the apples and topping, and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp for the apples (also adding a couple of dashes to the topping).  It was OUTSTANDING!  The apples were tart but sweet and was perfect with a scoop of ice cream!  Thank you so much!

This is wonderful.  I have always made it using the water, and it has never turned out runny for me.  I add some vanilla to the water, and a little cinnamon in the topping.

This apple crisp is WONDERFUL! The recipe makes a lot, and since I was making it for my family of four, we had several leftovers servings. We found that even when reheating it in the microwave, the topping remained crispy. Great with vanilla ice cream. My husband and kids were in heaven with every bite!

I made this apple crisp for an out of town family gathering.  I had to prepare it two days in advance and it still tasted great when I served it. My family raved and it was a breeze to make.

I changed the recipe according to other reviewers' suggestions.  I tried it because of the rave reviews.  I'm going to have to go against the majority...I've made better apple crisps than this. The topping is not very crispy...it's more of a crumb cake topping.  I also like the crisp part to be on the top and bottom as opposed to one layer just sitting on the top.  I won't be making this again.

This turned out yummy!  I used 1/4 cup water and 1 1/2 times the topping mixture.  
I brought it to a potluck and it was the 1st dessert to go out of many.

Well this was good but really sweet! Could be the apples I had! I know they can make a huge difference. I think if I made this again I would go for a more tart apple like the granny smith. I even cut the white sugar back to 1/4 of a cup like others suggested. I also used half the water. Good suggestion! Thank you! The topping was really good. I doubled it. I think next time I would only make one a half times topping. Double was a bit much. I do suggest you give it a try! The Vanilla Ice Cream is a perfect match for this one.

What a wonderful fall recipe!  My husband is an apple crisp devotee and rushed home from work for more desert!!!  This recipe will last for a couple of days as long as I hide it from him.  teeheehee. I did as many others suggested - omitted the water and doubled the topping.  Yum.  This is a really crisp crisp!  Enjoy!

I printed this recipe back in November of 2002 to prepare for Thanksgiving that year.  It has been a staple in our house ever since.  I  make it every year for my husband's birthday "cake" and it beats every apple pie and crisp recipe hands down!  I always omit the water and double the topping (advice I read in reviews back in '02).  If you're an apple crisp fan, don't miss this recipe!!

This was very easy to make and just as delicious. My husband said that it reminded him of the apple crisp his mom used to make when he was a youngster. I made this for a party and had to make several copies for friends and family!!

So delicious!  Even my 6 year-old (who won't eat apple pie!) loved this.  I prefer a more tart and not-saucy apple filling, so I used a combination of firm Macintosh (flavor) and Smokehouse (juicy), and added only a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice with the flour and cinnamon -- no water, and only about 1/8 cup of sugar.  I doubled the topping but it was too much -    1 1/2 times would be perfect.  Dreamy Fall treat!

Perfect recipe and filled the 9x13" pan well.  The topping was crumbly and sweet and it was ready after 45 minutes of baking.  Making the apple crisp is a good task to share with your child.  One can peel while another slices the apples.  One variation I used was straining the juice of one lemon onto the apples in the baking pan.  Stirring the apples into the lemon juice kept the apples looking fresh and added a nice flavor.  Invite your parents or neighbors over and enjoy the apple crisp on vanilla ice-cream!

This is so delectable!  I took the advice of others to make more of the topping because it is so good.  I reduced the sugar slightly and it was great!

I also reduced the amount of white sugar and water added. One tip- if you like a butter-rich topping, don't overmix the crumble topping after adding butter. The clumps taste rich and yummy!

This is pretty much a standard apple crisp.  Definately use granny smith apples. I used about 6 apples, 1/2 the white sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of the water.  Also added some nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.  Tasty and easy.

This recipe is so easy and it was the best apple crisp I have ever had. I was skeptical about the water addition but it proved beneficial for a nice sauce throughout the apples.

This Apple Crisp was great but I did not like how much water was added. The water made the apples verry soggy and not crispy. I am going to try and add half the water because I like my apples crispy. The topping was amazing and I can't wait to take it to a friends house to have them try it:-)

The apple and the crisp blend nicely. I found that the taste was a little bland... next time I will use more cinnamon and put it on the underside of the apples as well. The oats add a great crunch.

This is a great recipe. It's just like the one my Mom used to make for our family years ago. The only changes I make were I used 1/2 Apple Juice and 1/2 water,to give more flavor. I added 2T nutmeg and I also doubled the topping. Also, it takes about 1 1/2 hours to bake. Thanks for sharing!

I took the advice of others, cut out the water in the apples and doubled the crust.  Thank goodness I did, but the recipe still needs some work if I use it again.

1) I would use 1/4 flour in the apples, two Tbls of cinnamon, no water, and a dash of nutmeg.  Underneath the topping in my crisp there were apples floating in LOTS of liquid.

2) Continue to double the topping, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of salt--mine tasted a little bland and I realized that could have been fixed easily with some salt to perk up the flavors. 

This recipe has potential, but I'm a little disappointed I used up a bunch of freshly-picked apples on a mediocre recipe.  I'm from Ohio--we know apples.  I should have followed my instinct.

Yummy! I used less white sugar, only about tablespoon water, tablespoon lemon juice, 5 large granny smith apples, dash nutmeg in with cinnamon, and I didn't melt the butter...I just cut it in mixture until crumbly. A big hit here. Thanks for posting. made it last night, making it again for tonight. Husband loved it, so did I.

This is the best apple crisp ever!!! Served warm with vanilla icecream, it is the most comforting dessert. My children loved it. I took some to work and my co-worker almost flipped out over how delicious it was. She immediately copied the recipe and made it that weekend.  The only thing i did differently was omit the water. This did the trick for my family.

THE BEST!!! I only used 1/4 cup of water.  If you end up with too much towards end of baking, just scoop out and finish cooking.

This was delicious!  I used a mixture of apples:  machintosh, granny smith and braburn.  I always love to mix up my apples in pies or crisps to give different textures.  I'm sure I used more cinnamon thank what the recipe called for since my husband loves cinnamon and I also added about 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp allspice to the appple mixture.  It turned out so good and I was very pleased that everyone loved it.  I have a small dish left in the refridgerator waiting for a midnight snack attack to hit me :)   Thanks Diane!

This is the best apple crisp I have ever made!  Everyone loves it, including my very picky husband.:) I have made this three times now, using 10 granny smith apples and I omitted the water each time.  Thanks for a great recipe Diane!

I made this with 2 16oz bags of frozen blueberries instead of apples and it came out great. I only added 1/8 cup of water to the berries, 4 Tbl of suger, and instead of cinnamon I used apple pie spice. Great dessert will make again on Thanksgiving!

Wow, rave reviews.  Served this at Halloween party, gave out the recipe to many.  Omitted the water. I used 3 kinds of apples as that is what I had on hand.  I doubled the topping & added pecans to it,  but did NOT double brown sugar--used about 1&1/4 cup. Also added a dash of lemon juice to apples, I poured cinnamon-nutmeg sugar over sliced apples while in a bowl to coat them thoroughly & than put into pan.  Once apples were in pan I tossed some Craisins on top than sprinkled on the oatmeal mixture. Yummy! Will make again and again.

My family really enjoyed this apple crisp.  I have searched for an apple crisp recipe.  This is delicious.  I left out the water like others recommended and added less sugar.  I decided to half the recipe and this was a huge mistake.  We finished the apple crisp within a day!  I need to make it again soon!

I messed up the topping (I know, real hard!), but even so it was delicious.  I can see how much better it would even taste made properly!!! I usually make my crumb topping with solid butter, but using melted made it easier (no need to have room-temp butter hanging around).  I did not add the flour or sugar to the apples just a tsp. of cinnamon -- we like the apple part slightly tart.  I will definitely make this again (the right way!!).

This is the best recipe for apple crisp!!!  I made it for a family gathering and everyone said it was FABULOUS!  A wonderful dessert for a cold fall/winter evening!  It was a bit sweet for me so next time I will reduce the amount of sugar. Scrumptious!

Loved this apple crisp recipe. I mix the apples and spices in a bowl first, so they get evenly coated. I skip the water, and it turns out great every time. I also like to add cinnamon to the topping. I recently made this with fresh peaches.Mmm. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is very, very good!  I didn't give it 5 stars because of the water.  Against the advise of my fellow reviewers, I added the water and ended up w/watery crisp.  I loved the flavor so much i decided to try it again, this time minus the water and it was GREAT!  The second time around, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the full cup of white sugar with the apples and it was not too sweet, not too tart - perfect for my taste!  The apples that you use are the vital ingredient in this and any other apple recipe so make sure u use BAKING apples.  if you are wondering which apples are baking apples, ask the produce staff at your supermarket or your fellow shoppers, it really makes a HUGE difference.

Yummy! I had just two apples to use up so I scaled the recipe way down (which is plenty for my beau and I). The only thing I did different was to use lemon juice in place of the water which satisfies my desire to have the apple filling a little on the tangy side. We ate this with vanilla icecream. I would make this again.

This recipe was awesome. I halfed the apples for an 8x8 pan and left the dough/crisp portion as is. I also deleted the water.  The recipe came out perfect. i will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made this last night for my husband and sons and it went over extremely well. I followed some prior advice and used 5 granny smith apples and I cut out the 1/2 cup water and replaced it with 1/4 cup apple juice. We ate it warm with whipped cream... DELICIOUS!

This recipe was excellent!  It was a huge hit and my husband who isn't a big dessert person had three helpings of this!  I did change a couple things.  I added extra cinnamon to the topping and added cinnamon and allspice to the apples.  Also, I one and a halfed the topping as I love extra topping.  But without any of these changes it still would have been great!  This is absolutely a keeper!

I thought this recipe was pretty good although several people commented that there was "too much cinnamon" in the apple mixture. Serving it with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping helped cut the cloying taste of the cinnamon. I also added more oatmeal than listed because the topping seemed really cake-like.

This was very good, especially the topping.  I used Splenda & a brown sugar substitute so my diabetic dad could eat it too.  I served it hot out of the oven &, for the rest of my guests, I had vanilla ice cream to put on top.  I'd used granny smith apples, & one guest said it was good as it was both sweet & tart.  My husband thought it was too sweet so I'll try 1/2 a cup of the white sugar/Splenda & maybe 3/4 cup of the brown sugar/sugarfree substitute next time.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to peel the apples or not but I peeled them. I'd say the size of your baking pan should depend on how thick you'd like the apple part to be.  I used 10 apples &, even though my guests enjoyed it, I think the 9 X 13 pan was too big.

Very easy to make, very tasty.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg to the apple mix, along with an extra few pats of butter on top of the oat topping.  I've also thrown in some golden raisins, maybe next time I'll toss in some chopped pecans into the topping...lots of room here for variation.  I've even modified the recipe to use it with other fruits, like canned pears (or fresh when available), or canned peaches.  Yum!

Great recipe, Diane!!

I was a bit skeptical because I have tried so many other recipes and the taste was just not what I was hoping it to be.
I made it for a pre-Thanksgiving pot luck.  It was gone in no time.  
I added a bit of allspice to the crumb mixture and used Cortland apples.

Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe... since I like cinnamon a lot, I added more to the apples, and included some in the crisp topping - excellent!

Soaked water with cinnamon sugar mix the night before! :) Great the next day! My boyfriend loved it - but it seemed to be kind of watery when it's first baked - surprisingly after a day in the fridge the water evaporates and the apple mixture is thicker.  Next time I'd try adding less water! :) Also added some walnuts :)

This was great! We had people over for the World Series Angel game (Yeah Angels!) last night and it was as big a hit as the game! We forgot the water but it was great anyway.

This recipe is AWESOME!! I made it just as instructed - water and all and it came out perfect. My family raved and it was so easy I felt guilty. I used a mixture of Mutsu, Gala, Macoun & Courtland, and the flavor was fantastic.

This was a very good recipe!  I followed the majority of the previous suggestions and cut the amount of white sugar in 1/2 and it was just right.  Also, since my husband and I like a lot more of the crisp than the apples, I reduced the amount of the apples by about 2 cups so it was perfect for us.  I will definately be making this again.  I'm only wondering if it will work just as well for peaches as it did for apples?

I only used 1/2C of sugar with the apples and it was still too sweet for our liking...... perhaps next time I'll add a few drops of lemon juice to cut the sweetness.  But overall I think it is a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again. It is especially good served warm with a scoop of ice cream. The topping is fabulous... I added sliced almonds and it was d'lish!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

My husband and son really liked this recipe.  It was easy and tasted great!  One thing that really made a difference was using Pampered Chef's Peeler/Corer/Slicer, it does all the work with the apples and slices them to 1/8" thick.  I don't like the big wedges of apples that never seem to get done, this was juicy and the apples were very tender.  I also cut back just a bit on the sugar based on some of the other reviews.  SUPERB!

The BEST apple crisp recipe ever.  This is so easy and SOOO good.  I made it for a dinner party and it was devoured in minutes.  It is wonderful with ice cream.  If you slice the apples thin enough, the cooking time is perfect.  We will definitely keep this recipe in our dessert file!

My mother and I have been looking for an apple crisp recipe that could rival the apple crisp served during intermission at the Shakespeare Tavern in Atlanta--we look forward to this treat at every show.  Well, this is the recipe!  We made this last week, and are already wondering when we can make it again!  One note--the apples we used were very juicy, so 1/2 cup of water seemed to be just a little too much.  Also, we added chopped pecans to the topping--wonderful! *Added note--I've now made this recipe many times. Have discovered that good apples make good apple crisp. Always use very crisp, flavorful apples, or you will be very disappointed.

Have made this twice already.  The family loves it and it doesn't last long!  I make many pies for Thanksgiving, but this has been requested this year.  I had lost my original apple crisp I used when moving, and have been trying many different ones since.  But I have to say, I am glad I found this one because it's better than the original one I had!!

I followed your directions to the tee! Was truly delicious! I didnt change anything, but was considering using only half of the sugar, flour, cinnamon mix at first...it seemed alot. But I chose to follow along and I'm sure glad I did!!! I topped it off with vanilla frozen yogurt on the warm crisp and Wow!! Tasted perfect and I will make it again!! Thank you!

This was not too sweet, one layer of topping was enough, though 2 may or may not have been better.  Easy to make.  I used around 1/4 cup water since some reviews say to use no water, and used I used normal oats instead of quick oats (I think they are old fashioned).

Amazing apple crisp! My husband says it’s the best he’s ever had! I agree! The only thing I don’t understand is why are baking soda and baking powder added??? There’s no leavening...

I did not add water.  Instead of sprinkling the sugar mixture over the apples, I combined with the apples and mixed well to coat thoroughly.  IMHO Granny Smith apples were made for this dish.

This tops my other "Swedish apple pie" recipe that I've always used and thought was the best. This is actually better. Soooo good. I did everything mostly as written, except I doubled the topping part. I accidentally added the water (I used 1/3 C.) to the oat/flour mixture instead of the apples, but it made it more moist. I also did put a little bit of water on top of apples too, b/c I figured I should. I also added a tsp. or so of vanilla extract to the oat/flour/butter mixture. This is the best apple crisp I've ever had. I melted the butter as the recipe stated (some people said not to melt it, but it was perfect). I used Granny Smith apples, they are the best for pies and apple crisp. My home smelled amazing while this was cooking. This will be my go-to apple recipe from now on.

Made it as stated, except I did not add the water, and glad I didn’t. Turned out great! No extra moisture needed. Just really sweet... Next time I’m going to use green apples and maybe half the white sugar.

I had three old apples that I needed to use so chose this recipe in the hope of making the best of fruit past its prime. It was easy to scale the recipe down and I did make a few changes by adding lemon juice for extra tartness and using only brown sugar in the apple mixture and topping. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, a half a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and fresh ground nutmeg to the apple mixture, as well as, a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping. Since I used a small ceramic baking dish, I decreased the oven temperature to 325 degrees and it cooked perfectly in 40 minutes. My husband thought it was one of the best apple crisps I had ever made so I will definitely be making it again!

Delicious, although I did take the recommendation to omit the water this time and I doubled the crust recipe.
Everyone thought it was amazing.

Have made this recipe countless times for many years. Still great every time and I have made adjustments - nutmeg and allspice in the crumble portion, and I’ve even played with the fruit by adding blueberries which is an amazing touch - tonight I’m trying it with strawberries. This apple crisp is hands down the best and everybody loves it when I make it!

It’s really good and I don’t have much to contribute that other people haven’t already, but just a mention for other people like myself. I’m allergic to cinnamon, so I substitute half allspice/half cloves and about a teaspoon of vanilla extract for cinnamon :)

Followed recipe for the most part, not the norm for me.
I used three types of apples the majority Granny Smiths.  I added a dash of kosher salt and I would add a dash of nutmeg next batch. Everybody loved it!

This was a hit at a church pot-luck! if you are trying this recipe for the first time as I was, it is definitely a winner AS IS!!!

The following are some personal refinements I incorporated following reading many of the other reviews.  I chose to stir the sugar and cinnamon mixture with the apple slices and to double the topping (also  adding 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and partially melting butter until it reached a thick liquid consistency). 

Next time - which there definitely will be!!! -- will try preparing without adding water and may also line the pan with half of the double portion of topping and layer the other half of the topping on top of the apples.

NOTE:  When 45 minute baking time is done, test apples in several places with a toothpick to see if they are suitably soft. If they are not (e.g., if apple slices are thicker), cover topping with aluminum foil to keep topping from becoming dark/burnt and return to the oven for a bit longer, checking periodically. Repeat toothpick test until satisfied with consistency of apples.

Some of the best i have had, moist yet crunchy top, I made the following change to the recipe. When I went for the oats I found someone had used the last and it hadn't made it to the shopping list yet, so in an effort to salvage the recipe I found some individual serving packs of Instant oatmeal and it took about 4 to make the right amount, my concern was because all I had was strawberry and cream, well mixed it up baked it to rave reviews. I bet any of the   flavors would work, give em all a try and let us know what  ya think.

I was looking for a desert I can make with gluten free ingredients since I had 2 gluten free guests. Made this recepie with Bob Red 1 to 1 flour and gluten free rolling oats. Doubles the topping as some recommended. It was so so good. Almost none was left at the end of the party.

This recipe was waaaay too sweet! My favorite apple crisp recipe, which I couldn't find so tried this one instead, did not have a single bit of sugar mixed in with the apples, just in the topping. This recipe made a sickeningly sweet sauce that made a syrupy mess. If you're going to make this recipe, I recommend omitting the 1 c. white sugar completely.

This is absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe to the T and  it was really good though if I am going to make again next time I would omit 1/2 cup water as it will be too watery.

I cook a lot of sweets (50 years +) and this is the best apple crisp yet!!  I heeded some of the reviewers' adjustments. I decreased water to 1/4 cup and tossed with apples before stirring in sugar, flour and cinnamon. Added a sprinkle of nutmeg and cloves and salt.  The apples make a lot of juice waiting for me to make the crisp.  Put it all in.  Doubled the crisp volume and put half on bottom before apples.  Used part steel cut instant and part regular oatmeal - what I had in the cabinet.  Sprinkled pecans on the apples before adding top crisp layer.  Delicious with ice cream.  Super apple crisp recipe. Thanks!!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I share it with. I increased the amount of butter to a 3\4 cup and the cooking oats to 1 &1\2 cups because there just didn't seem to be quite enough crisp to cover the entire dish of apples enough for my liking.  The rest of the recipe stays exactly the same and it tastes apple-icious!

I made this tonight for a church meal. I made it multiply to feed 60 ppl. Usually I follow recipes exact the first time but I wanted to make it where my daughter could eat it. she can't have white processed sugar. So I completely left it out and just used brown sugar. It was delicious. Came out great. I baked it in an oven roaster. I got many compliments on it.

This was wonderful! I only used 4 average size apples and an 8x8 baking dish. I added some nutmeg to the mixture for the apples and left all other amounts as directed. I also tossed the apples in half of the mixture and then sprinkled the rest on top. My crumble turned out great, a little too sweet but I still loved it and will make it many more times.

Oh my gosh, this was excellent.  I also didn't add water & used only 8 apples.  I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla with ingredients to put over apples.   Did not melt butter for topping but used cold butter and cut it in.  Cooked 48 minutes and it was perfect.   Will definitely make again!

I made this exactly according to recipe. I used 10 med/large Gala apples. I thought it turned out okay, but after cooking it 45 minutes the juice was very runny. I took it out and cooled it in hopes that it would thicken up, but it was still very watery. The flavor  was okay, bland and quite sweet.  This is partially because this is a dessert recipe, while I make this more as a breakfast dish.  I put it back in the oven the next day to try to reduce the sauce and it took about an hour to get to the right consistency. I think if I made this again I would use a more tart-flavored apple, reduce the amount of sugar, and perhaps increase the amount of cinnamon in order to improve the flavor. I would eliminate the water as it seems completely unnecessary. I would also chunk the apples instead of slicing them I think, just because it would make it easier to get out of the pan and to eat it neatly.

Second time I made this after rave reviews the first time.  I doubled the  crumble recipe and layered half under the apples and the other half on top.  As others suggested, I reduced the white sugar to 2/3 of recipe amount, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to sugar/cinnamon mixture and tossed apples with the mixture before adding to pan.  I used 1/2 cup water to drizzle over apples before layering top with crumble.  Cooked the whole thing at 325 degrees for 50 minutes - and it helped to keep it very moist but still easy to cut.  This is delicious with vanilla ice cream and home made caramel sauce.  It is most delicious two days later when juices have been fully absorbed in bottom layer and lasts several days as long as refrigerated.  This is an absolute "go to" Fall dessert. My company and family loved it!!!!

This would have been a five star, had I followed this as written! read too many reviews and as a result, didn't add the water (or apple juice) to the apples and I doubled the topping.  The water or juice IS needed (and I used some very tart Paula reds which seemed to make a lot of their own juice).  Doubling the topping was way too much crust.  Disappointed but I should have made it as written the first time:) I sure will next time, the flavors were excellent, but dry.
UPDATE 9/16/2016:  FIVE stars when followed as written.  Only thing I would change is a bit more cinnamon.  This will be my go-to for future apple crisp.  Just right on the topping!

This recipe calls for too much sugar, if I make it again I will definitely use half white if any and half brown sugar.  Other than that the recipe is OK .

I have tried several apple crisps over the last month and this is the only one I didn't like.  It was incredibly sweet.

I was in a cooking competition and made this as dessert, the judges LOVED it,  I did reduce the water from 1/2 cup, to 3/8 cup and it came out perfect.

It was delicious! I used 21oz of apple pie filling instead of making the apples, but kept everything else the same. The crumble was so good I kept eating it before I even had it in the oven! Totally making it again!

Very, very good. I have made this recipe many, many times now and it always comes out great. I do leave out the water (apples release liquid as they cook and soften, so they provide more than enough liquid while baking without adding more). I also use half brown sugar and half white sugar in my filling and I add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to my topping. Perfection!

It has too much sugar, and a bland, dry top. I didn't trust that the recipe said 'melted' butter.

Best apple crisp recipe ever!  Use granny smith apples or a sour apple you like. I made these changes to the apple mixture: added 1 tsp. of vanilla, left out water and added 1/4 cup apple sauce instead, and added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. To the crisp part: doubled up but instead of melting the butter completely, use it soft. This causes the chunky crisp effect.
Also, I put a layer of caramel sauce to the apples after placing them in a dish then adding apple crisp mixture to the top. 
Serve with French Vanilla bean ice cream and add some caramel sauce to the top. Top notch!

Really yummy! I had way too many spartan apples that were just about off, so I had to use those rather than granny smith.
 I cut the white sugar by half as others suggested, but I think I could have left it in since the apples turned out to be slightly tart after cooked. 
I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and left out the water, it didn't need it at all. 
Overall it turned out really good, just like an apple pie without the crust. It hit the spot!

I made it just like the recipes says.  I'm not a very good cook so I rarely vary recipes.  It was not only easy, but delicious!  My family loved it!  I did use 3 varieties of apples that we had picked at an apple orchard.  We topped with a bit of vanilla ice cream.  So good.

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  A couple comments on the other reviews:  Yes, add nutmeg with the cinnamon...it's good.  I was planning on halving the water like others said, and wound up forgetting it altogether.  Seemed fine to me without water, but if I did use it I'd keep it to 1/4 cup. Also, I think if you leave out the water you need to cook longer. A lot of people talked about doubling the crisp...I did this and thought it was too much.  I'd stick with the original recipe for the right ratio (at most up it by 50%).  One reviewer said it was too sweet;  I'm betting they used regular red apples.  I highly recommend Golden Delicious or Braeburn apples to balance the tart and sweet.  I used Golden Delicious and they were perfect.  Finally, I agree with everyone who said to toss the apples in the sugar mixture...it gives you a nice even coat and helps the apples to soften equally throughout.

I made it this morning for a Boss's Day breakfast and it was a big hit! I used a variety of apples (don't even know what kind...my neighbor brought them to me from the Amish farm stand in upstate New York) and I doubled the topping. (I had some topping left over and you can bet your booty it's going in the oven tonight :)) As other reviewers have said, I think I could have skipped the water or at least cut back as it was a tiny bit runny while still warm but once it cooled it firmed up. Might depend on type of apple you use. Anyway, it was delicious and got two thumbs up from everyone.
P.S. I prepared the topping the night before, covered tightly and put in fridge; peeled and chopped the apples the night before, tightly covered and put in fridge. Apples browned very slightly but you can't tell at all after it's cooked! I also combined the sugar/flour/soda/b.powder the night before. It was very easy to assemble and bake this morning, didn't even have to get up early. :)

This is delicious!!! I can't tell you how many times I've made this! My parents really enjoy it too! I have added fresh local maple syrup to it as well (just drizzle it on top after you take out of the oven) It also smells wonderful while baking!

Awesome!  As other reviewers recommended, I doubled the topping and used 6 granny smith apples that I mixed with 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Use 1/4 cup of water or none.

I think you need to add more apples to the recipe. Also I think it would be better if the sugar mix was stirred into the apples before putting them In the baking pan.

Made this crisp for a local pool league award ceremony, there were roughly 80 to 100 people there. Quadrupled the recipe and made it in 2 big hotel pans. Both pans were DEMOLISHED. Literally. I cannot tell you how many compliments I received! I've already been asked to make it again at next years' ceremony. Hubby is already asking for it to be made again so he can have one to himself. Followed the recipe as is, no changes at all and it was perfect. And so simple to make too! Will definitely be making more of these in the future. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I made this the other day with some variations suggested by reviewers such as less sugar, less butter, less water, more crust, and use an 8x8 pan. The taste was good but next time I will put half the crust mixture on the bottom because I kept having to increase the baking time when the crust still looked raw after 45 minutes.  When I make it again, I will try different apples, decrease the sugar even more, keep the amount of butter the same as in the recipe, and add apple juice or apple cider instead of water.  I think the liquid is important for steam-cooking the crust.

I would cut the brown sugar in the crumble topping considerably...much too sweet for my taste. The apples can withstand less sugar as well. Also, I would change flour to cornstarch since it does a better job thickening liquid so it isn't runny. My mom also used to squeeze a bit of lemon juice onto her sliced apples used in pies/etc. to brighten the flavor a bit. If you slice apples thinly, you shouldn't need the full 45 min to bake. Mine were about 1/2" thick and the baking time was perfect for the apples without making them mushy but it was a bit too long for the crumble topping and dried it out. Since the flour didn't thicken the 1/4c water (I halved what recipe required based on reviews), I ended up stirring the entire end product into itself so the dried-out/overbaked topping could be alleviated with the excess liquid that accumulated at the bottom.

My whole family LOVES this apple crisp recipe!!! I make the recipe as is, as far as ingredients go. When I am slicing up the apples I have the cinnamon, sugar and flour already in the bowl that I am putting the apples into. Helps them from turning brown on you!!! Thank you SO much for this awesome treat!

This is very good. I changed a few things as I am gluten free. I changed the flour for all purpose gluten free flour n it was very good. I also added chopped pecans in the topping as they come out crunchy and roasted. I also doubled the topping as we like lots. Very good flaver.  I added some nutmeg like a few others in the apples and a little pinch of ground cloves. Used brown sugar but only half of what it called for. I cut just a little of the water. I also added raisins in the apples as we like that. Raisins make it sweeter so another reason to cut back on the sugar. The flour in the apples I also used all purpose gluten free four. 
This crisp is very good buy itself or top with vanilla ice cream or cool whip while warm n it melts on top. Yummy.

This was really great! Made it for Sunday lunch dessert and everyone cleaned their plates. Made a few changes, added some orange zest to the apples, and used half a cup of white sugar in the crumble since I didn't have brown.

I have to say this recipe is spot on IF you use 10 cups of apples. I use spartan apples for apple crisp every time. My husband is an apple dessert anything. I did add 1/4 cup caramel sauce and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. The key to a crunchy topping is to cut the butter in the dry ingredients AND just before you put it on top of the apples, drop 1/2 teaspoon of butter onto the apples, about 6 dopples. To keep the apples creamy, don't put a bottom layer of crumble in the pan. It tastes wonderful with a creamy apple, buttery with cinnamon bite!

The flavor is awesome!!! I would take other recommendations and double the toppings and ether make the choice to cut out the water or add more flour.

Delicious. Made this for holidays and was enjoyed by everyone. I threw in some raisins and crushed walnuts which gave it some extra flavor

One of the things I love about this site is the suggestions by the reviewers. Due to the suggestions, I made this recipe with half the apple part with no water.  I did put in 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice before tossing the flour and sugar with my Granny Smith apples.  I made the full amount of topping.  The whole thing fits in a 7 1/2" souffle pan or an 8"x8" pan.  I cooked it for 50 minutes and it was absolutely outstanding.

So wonderful. I added rosemary to give it a bit more flavour and lessened the sugar and it was like eating apples and caramel. So delicious with a scoop of plain vanilla ice cream.I love how the oats gives it that depth rather than just flour , sugar and butter. Also, adding bran to the top mixture was so yummy.Will make this again.

I made this recipe today with a few modifications.  It turned out excellent but I think it would have been too sweet had I added the sugar to the apples so I gave it a 4/5 stars.  I used whole wheat flour, added 1 cup of pecans chopped and left out the white sugar.  It turned out wonderful and I would make it again the exact same way.  My daughter asked for seconds!

Everytime I want some good hearty dessert that's quick and delicious I always go for this one or the best brownies that's from this site as well. this is the only apply crisps recipe that I will be making again and again it's so delicious and very easy to make. I had to bake mine with 8 minutes to spare because I smelt a hint of burning so I pulled it out. it's perfectly golden brown I pulled it out just in time and it's perfect. so guys when you are closing in to your 45 mins.  keep an eye and the smell make sure you won't burn it. anyways I love this recipe and would definitely recommend this.

Perfect! I made a half batch as I only had 4 medium apples on hand. I made it in a 9x9 square cake pan. Next time the only changes I'll make is make in a slightly smaller dish (if making another half batch) and reduce the water just a touch.

I made this but I used Washington State apples and added the water. Was not impressed. Totally my fault. I did not. Read the comments before I bought the apples. Next time I will make sure it's Granny Smith and not to add the water. For too much liquid at the bottom of the pan.

Simple and yummy! I made this with red delicious apples I had on hand that were a little on the tart side. I cut back on the sugar, added a little (1/4 tsp) nutmeg and didn't add any water. Turned out great! I can't wait to try it with Granny Smith apples.

Mix the sugar mixture with the apples (and do not just sprinkle on top). Leave out the water. Double the topping. Half on the bottom and half on top. Add nutmeg.

Best apple crisp I've ever had!

The only thing I added was half a tsp of vanilla to the brown sugar mixture. 

To those who think the water is unnecessary. It's not, it really helps the cinnamon/sugar mixture stick to the apples. I coated the apples in the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the water by stirring them in the pan so it would be evenly applied. It turned out PERFECTLY. Will definitely be making this again.. and again... and again. :)

Delicious! Made this for AFC Playofff and there was not enough. I could have made two easily. Best Apple Crisp I've had, ever! I will increase the topping by 50% and cut back on the water by half next time though. Thanks for a great recipe.

Overall, very yummy and it the spot for my dessert craving, using a bunch of apples I needed to use. It was a little runny at the bottom. But it was simply made (with help from young children) and delicious.

I have been making this for a few years now and the family loves it! The only change I make is the apples. We have a tree in the back yard and I use those, no idea how many apples, enough to fill my pan.

AWESOME recipe.  Like so many other reviewers, I didn't add water, used a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in with the cinnamon/sugar mix, and I doubled the topping mixture.  I used Granny Smith apples, and they were very firm, so I ended up having to bake the dish for two hours. I kept it covered most of the time to not overcook the top, and it was so worth the wait.  It may have been ready sooner, but the extra baking time brought out plenty of moisture in the apples, and it caramelized so nicely.

I made it for the first time for New Year's Eve.   I dressed it up a bit by altering the 1/2 cup water.   I made it 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup Apple brandy.  With a dash of clove to the cinnamon,  it made a great adult taste for Apple crisp.

Amazing!!! So easy, yet so delicious! Followed recipe except used old fashioned (5 min) oats rather than quick oats, and added walnuts to the topping. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream about a month ago. Making again now for Christmas dessert. If you don't have an apple peeler and a thin slicer/corer (16 slice/apple), get them... so worth it and save so much time on recipes like this!

The first time I made this I followed it exactly and it was so sickly sweet that I wouldn't even serve it to anyone! I made this again last night with some modifications and it turned out way better. Use the Granny Smith apples since they are more tart than other brands. Also, replace 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar with half portions only. Next time I make this I plan to reduce the sugar even further!

Double the topping. Cut all sugar by 25%. Add 2 T lemon juice if apples are sweet. Cut water in half. Yummy

Hoping this turns out as I just realized it called for half a cup of water but no where in this instructions does it say what to add the water too. So that being said fifteen minutes into cooking I had to pour water into pan.....#fingers  crossed.

Very good apple crisp.  Next time I will add less water....either that or more flour....was a bit watery.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added nutmeg because I love it.

Great recipe.  I used green pippin apples.  NO water.  1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar cause ice cream sweetens it up.  I used pumpkin pie spice which is ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  1.5x the topping for more crunch.  Family loved it.

Great recipe-doubled the topping like other reviewers suggested. 

Didn't have enough brown sugar for that so used white for half of the double topping and it still tasted great. I used Granny Smith apples.

I used gal bag of fresh apples that had been frozen and thawed on the counter. They were pretty juicy and so didn't add the water. Will try thawing just over night on the counter,,maybe 6-7 hrs and if that is still too juicy will try in the frig over night. Seemed like it took a long time to thaw even on the counter. Anyway I might add another TB or 2 of flour to thicken it up. I also used a tad more cinnamon. This was really good and took it to a meeting and several wanted the recipe. I am making it for Thanksgiving with ice cream. Yummy.

Love this! So easy! I always forget to add the water and it still comes out perfect! I took the advice of others, added nutmeg to my apples. I like to let my apples sit while I make the topping which I also double, and which is why I forget the water. But they make their own juice like that and it's awesome. Only thing I add...CARAMEL! Right on top the topping, make it right in! Top with ice cream, amazing in my mouth!

As other people have said, this is a very sweet recipe, and while using tart apples may help, it is still too sweet for my taste (that's with sugar already reduced by 25%). Next time I'll try reducing the sugar by half.
There was quite a bit of liquid after baking, but that didn't bother me.

Best apple crisp recipe I've ever tried.  I agree with other reviewers, the water is not necessary.  Otherwise I made it exact to recipe, using cortland apples (tart and great for baking) and it was fantastic.  The crumb topping is decadent and would go great with any fruit.

First time making any kind of crisp, and I loved it. I had all the ingredients on hand, and it was really easy and fast to make. Followed the recipe exactly except that I only had about 5 cups of apples. So, I halved the cinnamon, flour, sugar mixture. I kept the same measurements for the oats, brown sugar, butter mixture and put half on the bottom of the pan, layered the apples on top, and put the rest of the oat mixture on top. Very good recipe.

Yum! My first baking of an apple crisp. My friends and I LOVED it. I did double the recipe for the crumble as I wanted a packed bottom and top layer in a 9x13 pan ~ the way my mom used to make it. And at the suggestions of other reviewers I didn't add the water. Great with or without vanilla ice cream! I also don't know how much 10 cups of apples is, but I used 5 granny smiths.

DON'T ADD THE WATER! I had it all ready to pop in the oven, and was waiting for another baking item to finish, and checked the reviews, (Should have done this first, as I usually do). I tried to pour off the water, & out came a lot of the cinnamon, sugar & flour coating. Cooking time was perfect, but was still soupy from the residue water. Gave it 5 stars in spite of this, as I will try again.

Delicious!  I always use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Water is not needed on the apple mixture unless you prefer your crisp less dense.  The topping is delicious.  I make 1.5 of the topping.  Sometimes I add a cup of mini caramels that you can usually find in the fall at your market.

It was good but a little sweeter than I like but it had good flavor. I will be making this again just 1/4 cup less sugar. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Great recipe, the only thing I would change was 1/2 cup of white sugar.  A bit sweet.

Delicious!! Best part about it is the crumb topping! Next time I'm going to make double the amount of the crumb topping because that's the best part! Also I cooked my apples on the stove too for Abt 10 min and I ended up only baking it for exactly 20 min. It's much more fun seeing the apples cook!

Too Sweet.  Twelve servings contains 2 cups of sugar.  That's 96 teaspoons sugar/12 servings = 8 teaspoons of sugar in a serving.  Yech!  Sweet isn't supposed to be a flavor.  I will cut the sugar in half next time so I can taste the tartness of the apples.

Way too much sugar! I did exactly every step this recipe listed, and it came out entirely too sweet! 1 full cup of sugar including 1 cup of brown sugar is way too much.

I made this, as written, tonight for a quick apple dessert and it is perfect!  It was easy to put together from ingredients on hand and was a hit with my family.  I like that the cinnamon wasn't overpowering and that the crisp topping was made without any spice.  It's nice to actually taste the sweetened apples.  Keeper!
11-17-18 I've made this dozens of times and want to add that I think the water in this recipe is important to make the apple filling juicier; especially if served a la mode. It makes a nice sauce for the ice cream. You can use apple juice or cider as a replacement for the water.

Outstanding- the best apple crisp I've had. I didn't measure the apples. I just filled a glass 13x9 dish (size in the recipe) almost to the top. I had a combination of apples, including many McIntosh, which tend to be more watery. Also used Crispin and Spartan varieties because that's what I had. I cut the water in half, but using the full amount in the recipe probably would not do harm- especially if using apples other than McIntosh. I don't know why people are complaining of so much liquid after baking. The recipe calls for 1 cup + flour which should absorb liquid.- maybe they didn't follow the recipe. The recipe is not too sweet if you use enough fruit, as a 13X9 pan implies. Some people are using 5 apples or peaches . That is not going to make 10 cups or even fill the pan.

Wow!  This stuff should be illegal.  It's too bad it's fattening.  O well, it's so worth every calorie.  I used whatever apples I had and turned out perfect.  Better than mom's and mother in law.  How'd you like that!

Very very good. I enjoyed the crumble on top of the crisp. I used pre-frozen apples I had picked last year so I didn't need the water. Turned out wonderful. Ice cream is a must as it steps it up even more.

Didn't change anything and it was great!!! Definitely a little sweet (which I love) and the Macoun apples  I'd had picked a few weeks earlier were perfect in this recipe. It was a little watery but it didn't ruin anything. The flavor was great and the topping would be good all buy itself! I had no issues with it crumbling and the oats really made it. This recipe really is great and was very simple to make. Will definitely be sharing during the holidays!

Other than adding a small container of blackberries, I made this as written.  Loved by all.  Next time I will double the crisp.

Man, this is the way apple crisp ought to taste. So hearty, rustic, and substantial. A co-worker gave my wife a box of apples and this was a great way to use some of them. I forgot to add the water, but it wasn't a problem. I may use half the water called for next time, but even without it, the apple crisp was plenty moist. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

So yummy!  Like others, I halved the apples and mix (for 2 people) but made the full topping mix. I thought it came out a little watery but hadn't read the comments.  Next time I will cut the water in half too.

Love it. I've made this often. Changes I do now are :1/2 the apples and left topping same.  Used the called for (little less)water.  Put half topping on bottom. 1/4 nutmeg to apple mixture.
You don't have to change a thing. It's awesome. I only change because I use a smaller pan

This recipe is easy to make, but HUGE on flavor!  My husband usually just simply comments that something is good or not. He stated that this crisp has the perfect balance- I almost fell over!  As many reviewers stated, you don't need the water. I used half each of brown and white sugars (Splenda), about 10 Granny Smith, and 6 Gala apples for the fruit base. I grated a little fresh nutmeg in with the sugar that goes over the apples. Next time I will add half again as much topping- it was the best part.  The tart, soft apples play nicely against the sweet crunchy topping perfectly. My kitchen smelled heavenly, and my husband asked for seconds. Thanks, Diane, for this fantastic recipe.

I'll give this 5 stars too.  I made it just as written with half the amount of water.  However I'm telling you .... You don't need NEAR that much sugar!!!  It's a keeper but I'd diminish the sugar by at least 1/3!

Awesome recipe! I made my crisp in to individual sized tarts, they were a great success. I added 1 tsp of nutmeg, used half the water and double the topping. Chopped my apples to bite sized pieces, filled my tart shells, pressed on the topping and baked for 35min. I will definitely use this recipe again, it was yummy!

Awesome! . I doubled the topping recipe cut the water in half and added 1 cup of pecans. Mine came out super crunchy and perfect. Baked mine for about 45-60 minutes. I used a mix of red and green apples and dipped my apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture before pouring it on them. . I cut my apples thick and also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to them. Do these things and yours will come out perfect. Love this recipe.

Apple filling:
Our apples were on the sweet side..they were a bit to sweet with the extra sugar from this recipe. Next time I will take the apples sweetness into consideration. 

Topping:
I doubled the topping and it worked well. 

Served with vanilla ice cream

Delicious!! I did not measure apples, but used 10 granny smiths. Stirred apples/sugar before adding water.  Baked longer than instructions bc slices were pretty think, but should have followed instructions - apples were a little mushy.  Will definitely make again!

So good! I was out of shortening so I substituted with butter and reduced the salt. I also like mixing the apple variety making a nice combo of sweet and tart thru out the dish.

This is my absolute favorite apple crisp recipe EVER!!! I have made this with the double crust as suggested, with only a single crust,with and without crushed pecans, in a 9x13 pan and in an 8x8. And it has never turned out bad. It's just THAT GOOD!!

Great recipe! I used Granny Smith apples and decreased the water to 1/4 cup based on people's suggestions. I also added a bit of nutmeg and tossed the apples in the cinnamon mixture before placing them in the pan. I tried doubling the crumble part and layering the crumble and apples to make bars, but this ended up having an unfavorable crisp to apple ratio. I tried it with a one to one like it's written and it's definitely better with just one layer each.

This is so delicious! I had never made apple crisp. I followed other reviews and did not melt the butter (I cut in the butter) and added just a little water. The crumble is divine. I could eat this everyday. Thanks!

Excellent! The top gets nice and crispy. I used a little less sugar, and half the water called for. I made half the amount of apples in a 9x9 but left the topping amount the same and it was perfect.

Sweet. Made with Granny Smiths. I followed the recipe except I forgot to add the water! I'm glad I did, it was somewhat watery anyways. I also added the nutmeg as previous reviewers suggested. A side of ice cream was a perfect (almost necessary) complement to this dessert. 

In the future, I'll continue to omit the water, add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, cut the sugar a bit and double the topping.

Made it tonight, forgot to add the water and the topping was already on, so I poured about 1/4 cup of water down the edge and let it seep around the bottom.  This was a very happy accident.  After letting the apple crisp rest for 45 minutes...it was not soupy and the best I've made so far.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I cut the liquid to about a quarter cup, used cider and skipped the white sugar. Added nutmeg, cloves and powdered ginger. Used a 9x9 pan with fewer apples and same amount of topping. Best. Thing. Ever.

I make this every fall and it is a huge hit among my family and friends!!  As someone else posted I cut the amount of water I pour over the apples, in half. Then I also double the crust recipe, but I put it all on top. Turns out amazing and perfect every time!!! This recipe is a serious hit!!

Delicious.  Did not peel the apples.   Easy to make gluten free.  (Use sorghum flour or a GF flour mix.)  It may have been slightly too sweet but I used tart apples so it was perfect.  Also added a touch of nutmeg but it probably made no difference.   But next time in going to make it with tapioca granules on the apples instead of flour.  Just personal legends but I didn't think about it until it was too late.

Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly except I halfed it and baked it in an 8" square pan. I gave it 4 stars because it was a bit too sweet. Next time I will add less white sugar. Topping was fine!

Our favorite recipe, just add half the sugar to the apples, and we added caramel sauce to the top for extra awesomeness ;)

This is a good apple crisp recipe. I gave it 4 stars based on making it as written. I like that this recipe is a bit different than some because you add additional liquid to the apples so that they bake up a bit saucier.  The second time making the recipe I made a few changes which makes it more like a 5 star recipe.  I used less sugar with the apples - about 2/3 cup.  I also used apple juice instead of water because I had it on hand for another recipe.  I 1 and 1/2'd the topping so I would have more - but doubling the topping seemed like too much for me.  Also when doing that I used 1/2 c. margarine and 1/4 cup canola oil.  (I always use a bit of oil in my fruit crisp topping, as I think it makes it crunchier.)  The apples I used weren't the most flavorful  - someone gave them to me from off of their tree.  But, even so the crisp was very yummy.  Someone suggested to me, to add some lemon juice, about 2 TBL, to the apples to give them a tarter, more flavorful taste.  Next time, if I don't use Granny Smiths, I'll try that!

Made it as directed... So good. Will try a few suggested alternatives from other reviews in the future while making (nutmeg, less water...) but was good as is. Only thing I recommend to people making this is to make sure you don't cut the apples to thin ( I did on some and they came out really mushy).

I love the taste of this  recipe but it didn't have the "crisp" I wanted. I substituted  Japanese  style, plain Panko bread crumbs in place of the  oatmeal. Wow. Gives new meaning to the word crisp.

First several times I made this recipe as stated, and it is delicious. I have since then increased the crisp since that's my favorite part of apple crisp, so I add another half cup of oats, flour, brown sugar and stick of butter. Otherwise this recipe is perfect as is. I'd recommend honey crisp apples or Red Ida; and if you find they are particularly juicy, you can forgo the water.

Good recipe but too sweet for my liking.  I doubled the crumble and cut the butter in rather than melting it. I mixed the flour and sugar into the apples rather than sprinkling. In addition I added the zest of 1 lemon and the juice from 1/2 a lemon so I cut back the water to 1/4 cup.  Also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg , 1/8 TSP cloves and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  
For next time,  I'd use half the amount of sugar both in the apple mix and the crumble. Especially if you intend to serve with ice cream!

I read some of the other reviews (glad I did too....) & learned that tart apples were best. All I had were red apples so I soaked them first in lemon water (then drained it of course)!!! WORKED LIKE A CHARM (very good!!!) I also only had whole oats. I fixed that by putting them in the food processor & pulsing a few times. I also doubled the cinnamon & added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. 
Since I had soaked the apples & knew there would be some moisture on them I didn't add any water.
This is a KEEPER!!! Next time I will take the other advise & add oat mixture on the bottom as well. Will be double-good then. Thanks for sharing this!!!!

Delectable!  I doubled the crust, half on bottom, apples, sugar mix, other half of crust, sprinkle, literally a sprinkle of water.  Very delicious.  Will make again.  Maybe tomorrow.

Everything was great for us except it was too sweet. We used tart Granny Smith apples and still found it too sugary. Next time, I'll use 1/2 to 3/4 sugar, depending on the apples, and reduce the sugar in the topping.

The only recipe I will use for apple crisp is this one.! Definitely a top favorite in my house. The only thing I add is 12 cups of apples rather than 10 and I add 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar mixture. All in all amazing very easy recipe.! :)

This was a delicious recipe and my family loved it. I didn't change the water or topping amount as many of the reviews suggested and it turned out perfect! It was not watery at all. I did add 1 tsp of nutmeg and it added just the right flavor to it. Love this recipe and will make again for sure!

It was way too watery and almost too sweet. Won't be using again.

My family said it was "restaurant quality"!  They loved it!  Not sure it needed the 1/2 cup of water, but I followed recipe exact and 10 Granny Smith apples for me equaled 10 cups.  Only time consuming part was prepping apples, otherwise easy, delicious recipe!  It's a keeper!

Found this recipe to be easy and delicious. Just added a touch more cinnamon (as I like cinnamon). Bought ice cream specifically for this recipe. No regrets!

Very good! Halved the recipe, but kept topping amounts the same and it was perfect. Used honey crisp apples, 2 tbsp. white sugar and 2 tbsp. water. Will make again!

This was awesome!! I did change a couple things,(I always do ??). Instead of the half cup water, I used quarter cup of apple cider, and I also coated the apples with a tablespoon of melted butter before adding the sugar mixture. In the topping I added some chopped pecans. Served warm with whipped cream!! Best I've ever made!!!!!

This recipe is great!  I followed others tips and doubled the topping so that I  could put some on the bottom and on the top. I also mixed the apples up with the cinnamon and sugar mixture instead of pouring it on top. But it turned out great!

Delicious and healthy.  My three picky teens love this dish especially the topping.  I myself like it very much even though I never care for cooked apple.  Use green apples for a friend's tree.  The recipe is perfect without being neither too sweet nor too greasy.  Can't wait to repeat this recipe exactly as is written.  Thank you.

I loved it, my husband and me just loved it!! The only thing I changed was I did not add 1/2 cup of water, I used a 1/2 cup of milk. It makes it more creamier :) 
I use milk in my apple pie, and pear pies to.

Took the advise of others and reduced water to half, used Splenda instead of sugar and margarine not melted due to husbands diet restrictions, it was still very good.

Followed other recommendations and reduced water by 1/2, tossed apples in the brown sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture instead of sprinkling on top, added a 1/4 t. of nutmeg to that mixture as well. Lastly cut in butter instead of melting at recommendation of others.  It was AMAZING.  Seriously I could eat like 3 bowls full.

As written, I'd have to give this recipe 3 stars, due to how watery it was.  I'll make it again, and just leave out the water.  The flavor was very very good, and it was a really easy recipe.

I had 4 apples to use up, so chopped them and split them among 4 ramekins. I split the recipe in half and it was perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. Easy and simple. I only had Trader Joe's ROLLED OATS on hand, and they worked great.

This recipe was delicious. I followed the recipe and I would recommend skipping the 1/2 cup of water. It made it really watery on the bottom and I didn't like that. Other than that it was great. The crush added a nice crunch to it and it was a big hit with my family they loved it and it's great with vanilla ice cream!

Great Recipe!  I changed it up a bit though.  I put the topping on the bottom (to make a crust).  I halved the water and added extra cinnamon to the apples. I put a box of white cake mix (dry) on the top with a stick of butter.  So basically I combined 2 recipes, apple crisp and dump cake.  It was delicious...served with vanilla ice cream.

After read other reviewer's suggestions, my advice is to go with the recipe as-is. It's very good. Adding nutmeg will give a little extra kick, but it isn't necessary. Doubling the topping will make the dish very dry! Don't do it!

This crisp is awesome.  I've made it a few times, and through experience, I've made just one change--I omit the water.  The first time I made it, I was later tilting the pan and removing liquid.  The apples give off more than enough of their own moisture, but that may just be the type I use (granny smith).

I really enjoyed this recipe! Many of the people who ate swore they loved it! I did change a few things based on my desire to NOT go to the grocery store. I didn't have any oatmeal left but conveniently had the Quaker Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal packs (the ones kids usually eat for breakfast) anyways, I subsidized the 1 cup of oats for 3 packages of the oatmeal (equaled almost a cup). Then I baked it in a deep square pan and for 40 minutes and the last 5 minutes i took it out and added a 1/2 cup of pecans and lightly sprayed with cooking oil and turned the oven to broil (maybe 4 minutes) and then pulled it out :) We enjoyed it warm with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream on the side!

I just made this and it's so good that it made me weak in the knees.  Of course, like other reviewers, I made several changes to the recipe: For the apples (I used granny smith), I coated the apples with the sugar mixture and left out the water. The apples create their own liquid.  I also threw in some extra all spice to the apples. For the topping, I doubled the recipe and put some of it on the bottom of the pan before putting on the apples. I also threw in some additional all spice and cinnamon, as well as some chopped walnuts. As it was baking I thought the topping looked a little dry so I cut up a bit of butter and dotted the top of the topping with small cubes of butter. I served with vanilla bean ice cream,  and I will say this is better than any apple crisp I have ever had in a restaurant.

I can't get enough! I've made this recipe so many times and just realized I've never rated it. The only thing I do differently is instead of sprinkling the cinnamon flour mix over the apples, I place the apples in a bowl and just stir them until evenly coated and bake it at 375° for about 30 minutes or until the crisp is toasty brown. Thanks a million for a great recipe!! Oh, and if your crisp isn't crumbly enough before you crumble it over the apples, just add a 1/4cup more oats. PERFECT!!!

I didn't like this recipe at all. The topping was heavy (too much flour), and tasted like baking soda and baking powder (what was the purpose of adding those ingredients to the topping?) It was crumbly and dry, instead of rich and tender.

Following the advice of other reviewers to omit the liquid was a MISTAKE! I prefer a juicy, bubbling filling. This recipe also needs salt, lemon juice, and vanilla, which are necessary to create a pleasing contrast of flavors. So it was far too sweet, only because it lacked other flavors to complement the sugar. This was not the gourmet apple crisp I was looking for.

As other reviews recommended, I used granny smith apples, doubled the topping, added pecans to the topping too, and omitted the water.  It made a huge pan and was still a bit watery, so I had to spoon some out.  Next time use Mac apples as the granny smiths apples cook up very firm, and it was soooo sweet so next time halve the sugar.  I think my teeth are going to hurt from all the sweetness, but my hubs and mom seemed to like it.  I'll try this again, but only with some changes.

Amazing! I took advice from some other reviews. I doubled the crust recipe and put half on the bottom of the pan and the other half on top. I didn't add extra water but yet it was very moist because the apples had some excess water on them from rinsing them. I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust, I also added nutmeg to the apples. Using only 6 medium Granny Smith apples was plenty. This was my first time making this and it was a true success. I will be adding this recipe to my favs to make for family gatherings.

I made several adjustments to this recipe.  I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger.  Then I cut the sugar in half, in both the apple mixture and in the topping.  I also used whole wheat flour to give the topping a heartier and crunchier texture, and I added a pinch of salt and about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts to the topping mixture.  The end result was wonderful and flavorful, and the texture was perfect.  The only problem was that the crust and filling were still much too sweet.  Maybe next time I'll reduce the sugar by 2/3 instead of 1/2.

I like how the sugar/cinnamon sticks to the apples when it's baking because of that 1T. flour!  Water is a must, otherwise apples are dry.  Yes, double the crisp part; yum yum!  (I think I'll try adding pecans as someone suggested.)  (I'm not overly fond of nutmeg myself.)

Way too much brown sugar.  It really ruined the apple crisp.  Very easy to make.  Used a bit more cinnamon and added a pinch of nutmeg too.

There is a reason that so many people have made and reviewed this. So good so good. I used 12 small Fuji and gala apples, peeled and cut. I mixed them with salt, the sugar, cinnamon, flour and lemon juice and vanilla instead of the water. In doubled the topping and put some on the bottom. Cooked it in a 9 x13 glass pan for a little over and apple.  Bubble goodness not at all runny. Crunchy crunchy topping. Nice.

Made this for a big family gathering. It went so fast I didn't even get to taste it. Smelled amazing while it was baking, served with home made vanilla ice cream. 
I only used 3/4 cup of white sugar on the apples and about 2/3 cup flour for the topping.

Fabulous -- simple & delicious.
Make it gluten-free with Bob's Red Mill GF oats and Bob's Red Mill GF all purpose baking flour -- out of this world -- no one will know will guess it's GF!  Only adjustment would be with spices -- add more cinnamon or add nutmeg.  The water gives it a beautiful sauce!  Cook at same temp but on convection for 30 minutes -- delicious, apple-y, crispy, goodness in a pan!!

We loved this apple crisp.  I made it for a group dinner ad everyone loved it also.  I used granny smith apples, which may have mitigated the sweetness.  The only changes I made were to add about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and reduced the water to 1/4 cup (I forgot to add it until after the dish was in the oven, lol)  It also wasn't served until it had been out of the oven for a few hours, perhaps allowing the water and juices to gel a bit.  As a result, it was not soupy at all.  It is my favorite apple crisp of all time.  It will be made again and again!

I used 9 Green Granny Smith apples. Put the sliced apples in a ziploc bag with the sugar, flour, cinnamon and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Skipped the water (because I forgot) and doubled the oat mixture. Added french vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.

Great recipe...even a picky husband has asked me to save it and use it. This has great flavor. I used 10, golden delicious apples (I hate it when a recipe says how many cups of a fruit/veggie and not how many of the fruit it's. Not everyone is going to cut the same apples the same, so 10 cups for someone, could be more or less for someone else). I also doubled the crust, but used Demerara sugar in the crust (on hand thanks to hubby thinking it was the same thing as brown sugar...needed to use it for something and it works great in this recipe).

This was fantastic! Like KATTELYN, I left out the water. I used Granny Smith apples, and I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was absolutely amazing. I took it to my Bible study group, and it was completely demolished. My husband was so mad we didn't have any to bring home. I will definitely be making this again... and again... and again. :)

This apple crisp requires some modifications to be perfect - as is it's a 3.5/5. Add more sugar, cinnamon and some nutmeg to the cinnamon-sugar mix and toss the apples in it otherwise it's much too tart and you won't taste any spices. Also, use a mix of Granny Smith and semi-sweet apples like Honey Crisps. I also found the crumble wasn't crumbly enough - it needs more butter than the recipe calls for to turn it into a nice crunch. Tip: change to a low broil during the last 5 minutes of baking.

This is delicious! I cut back on the amount of water used. I used about 1/3 cup. Very sweet but we loved it. I will not use another recipe again.

Perfect!! Doubled the topping. Also sprinkled a little nutmeg and mace in addition to what the recipe calls for on the apples and tossed to coat before adding the topping. I used cortland apples - apps 4.5 pounds. This was gone in minutes!

Halved the recipe in an 8x8 pan.  It was more of just crumble - the apples really reduced (almost to nothing) which made the crumble part overpowering.  I did use gala apples so I'm not sure if this was the issue.  The crumble was delicious though so I wouldn't change that, would just increase the amount of apples. It was also extremely sweet for our taste!  We had some homemade apple sauce so we mixed that up with the crumble and it was yummy!!! Will try this again with Granny Smith, less sugar & more apples.

Turned out very watery.  If I were to try again, I would significantly reduce the water added to the apples.  Otherwise the flavor is great.

I did skip the water but also tossed the apples in a bit (half a lemon's worth) of lemon juice before the sugar/flour mix (and of course added nutmeg as others did but also put some cinnamon and nutmeg in crumble). I was making apple crisp to use up a bag of apples and think the reviewers who talk about buying 'tart, crisp' apples for perfect apple crisp need to lighten up! My apples were a little soft and sweet so I added a tiny bit less sugar and the lemon juice also helped brighten them up.I scaled it down to just over six cups of apples for my 4 person dinner party and it was PLENTY and filled a large dish and used up nearly my entire 4lb bag of overripe gingergolds. Because they were a little soft to begin with I cooked for about 5-10 minutes less than recipe recommended and it was very good. Just use common sense. I have made dozens of good crisps but liked the idea of the melted butter so gave this a try and am glad I did. Tasty and easy with the melted butter, which made a very crispy delicious crumble (which there was a perfect ratio of to the apples without screwing with the portions). 4 picky eaters agree- just leave out the water, add a bit of lemon juice, and give it a jab with a fork near the end of cooking and take out when they are at your preferred softness level.

I made this recipe a couple of time and each time I wish I had a bigger pan!! I used a pinch of nutmeg and only a 1/4 cup of water but everything else I kept the same. Dish this with a few scoops of French Vanilla ice cream and you'll be in heaven. It's also good after a few days hanging out in the fridge and then reheated.

This was quick,easy, and tasted great.  It reminded me of the apple crisp my mom used to make.  The only think I would change is to cut down the amount of water in recipe to half of what is listed.  Mine was a little watery...

So I can't give my own opinion for this recipe but speaking for my boyfriend (whom I made it for and he is an excellent cook) said it was absolutely delicious and was begging me to make it again! While making it, it seemed as though the porportions were right. I followed the recipe exactly and made no alterations.

very good, I've made it several times. Don't add water and use macintosh or gala apples. I tried it with other kinds and it doesn't taste good. Crumble topping with your hands and sprad evenly over top.

Instead of water used lemon juice. The crumble is good but there's something off or missing, haven't figured it out yet. Would use a crisper apple next time.

I made double topping and baked half of it in the pan for 15 min. for a bottom crust.  Made the rest according to the recipe except I forgot the water.  It may have made the crust soggy anyway.  Used Granny Smith apples and served with whipped cream.  It is amazing :)

I followed the other reviews: mixing apples with cinnamon and sugar and didn't add water and there was still juice in the bottom. I added 1/4 t. nutmeg and doubled the crust. It was very good but a little on the sweet side for me. I would cut down on the sugar next time. Great recipe though. I will make it again decreasing the sugar and maybe the butter to make it healthier.

I've used this recipe a few times now. I use BOURBON in place of the water; but only 1/8 cup,  1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice with the apples( I like Macintosh) . I double the topping using mostly old fashioned oats&  add 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice to that also.

Excellent recipe! I did make some changes that I feel made this recipe more to my liking. First, I used about 12 Granny Smith apples in a 9 by 13 pan. I mixed the 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, 1 tea. of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of ground up walnuts in a bowl with the apples tossing to coat. Place apple mixture in pan WITHOUT adding any water. Juice forms when the apples are mixed together with the sugar mixture; therefore, I only poured the juice from the apples over top. Adding the water would have made it to watery. I also doubled the crumb topping place a layer in the middle of the apples and the rest on top. I have made many apple desserts in my lifetime and one important step in avoiding a watery apple dish is to allow it to stand a couple of hours before cutting in to it. This gives it time to firm up. Wonderful crisp

Way too much sugar. I would cut the sugar in half. Other than that, it was good.

LOVED this.... I have made it just as the recipe requires, and it was delicious (although I did have a little extra of the sugar mixture that I did not completely add in).  The last time I made it, I added some raspberries (about a 1.5 cups) and it was AMAZING.  This is a standard in our home!

This was way too sweet for my family (including 4 kids), and I prefer less flour more oats. Only change I made was grating a stick of frozen butter, instead of melting and mixing, to make the topping more crumbly. I do like that it filled a 9x13, I've always had to double or triple recipes in the past. I will modify to our likings, great starting point though.

I love this recipe! I've followed directions every time and always end up with an amazing crisp! Recently I've played around with ingredients and added: dash of ground clove, substituted apple cider for water & sprinkled caramel bits over the apples before adding the crumble topping. I get raving fans every time I make this awesome fall dessert! Easy to follow recipe and delicious outcome! Thank you!

We always double the topping, but be prepared to have a glass of milk to go with it.  The apples didn't seem to sweet, not sure if my son measured correctly or if water had something to do with it.

I followed other reviewers suggestions: added nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mix, doubled the topping and only used about 1/4 cup water. So I know this is a little bit modified, but the basic recipe is a terrific start. I'm sure it would be terrific if made exactly as the recipe states; little tweaks are just personal preferences.

I gave this recipe four stars... only because the outside of my crisp just never hardened and instead of using a 1/2 cup of butter, I had to use 1 cup...  the measurements for this recipe Is off a little... I also suggest using pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon for more of a fuller flavor... and using 2 teaspoons of that

Way too sweet for our home. Can't imagine doubling the topping (2 cups of brown sugar). Try another recipe if you want a crisp with a less sweet taste. Won't make again.

Hubby approved! I have made my fair share of apple crisps and this has by far turned out the best. I didn't use 10 cups of apples, I used 3 med mcintosch apples and 2 large. But kept all the other measurements the same. Asked the hubby what he would give it out of 5stars.. Without hesitation. 5!!! Awesome recipe!

This is the best apple crisp I have made.  I followed the recipe exactly and used Jonathan apples.  The secret may be the baking power and baking soda in the topping as it stays solid.  I halved the recipe as there are only 2 of us and it still was a nice size dish.  This is a keeper.

After reading other reviews, I decrease the water to 1/4c., added 1/4tsp of nutmeg, and increased the amount of topping (made 1.5 rather than doubled); it turned out PERFECTLY! Everyone hard a large helping with vanilla ice cream and raved about the apple crisp. I will definitely make this again.

First time making an apple crisp, it was easier than I expected and it turned out quite good (I'm a novice baker). As recommended I used half the amount of suggested water and I added a dash of nutmeg to the apple mixture. I cut the butter into small squares in order to mix it into the dry ingredients as opposed to melting it. I used Gala Apples (since they were the only ones I had on hand) vs. Granny Smith but I reduced the amount of sugar. Though the final result was quite good I still felt something was missing - some vanilla extract maybe? Will definitely make again.

Great flavor! Great topping! I only made two changes: I used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon and I left out the water. The next time I make it, I will mix in some cornstarch with the sugar, flour, apples and spice to help the liquid to thicken a little. Try pouring a little heavy cream over this instead of ice cream. Deelish!! My kitchen smelled amazing while this was cooking.

The flavor was AMAZING! The water was WAY too much though. I actually had to drain some off once I took it out of the oven. Next time, I will only add a few tablespoons of water.

Absolutely terrific. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe. I did double the topping like other reviews suggested, but that was way too much. Maybe 1 1/2 the topping next time. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Would definitely make this again.

My grown daughter & I made this today & followed the recipe as written. My daughter & grandkids enjoyed it, hope they leave some for their dad when he gets home from work. I took two pieces home for me & my hubby. I ate it warm with Edy's Caramel Delight ice cream on top & it was delicious!

Absolutely what I was looking for - cinnamon-y, sweet, with perfect crispy, crumbly topping.  Cut serving size to 4 and used an 8x8 glass Pyrex casserole .  Still took 40+ minutes to brown the crisp.  Excellent with ice cream.  On a healthy note, this used a lot less butter than my previous allrecipes apple crisp choice.  Recipe box keeper!

This really is a definitive apple crisp recipe.  I used McIntosh and Gravenstein apples from a local orchard and the tanginess was top notch.  I mixed lemon juice in with the water to keep the apple browning to a minimum, so that might have tanged it up a bit.  Everything else according to the recipe, mixed it in a kitchenaid mixed which broke the apples down a bit to a very good result.  Needs no ice cream, awesome for breakfast or dessert.

This apple crisp was absolutely amazing! My friend had some and didnt even believe I made it. The crumble part with the oatmeal, butter and sugar all mixed together was to die for, try a little bit of it before putting it in the oven its great! So delicious!

Made with Granny Smith apples (used 10 of them). Added two tablespoons of flour instead of one and added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Had no issues with it being too sweet or too watery. It was perfect! I cooked it for 45 minutes probably around 400F. Apples were not mushy.

Finally found and made apple crisp like my nanna use to make....made as directed with a small change of no flour in the apples, replaced with raw tapioca, that is what nanna used....I noticed on review commented on how there were nearly 300 reviews...I giggled as I looked at the "now" reviews...over 3000!!!!! And I know the reason why.

Great recipe.  The only change I made was using granola in the topping since I was out of oats. It made for a very nice topping. Next time I will cut the sugar (the granola adds sweetness as well) and cut my apples a little thicker.  The water didn't need to be reduced because as soon as the crisp begins cooling the "sauce" thickens. Others suggested doubling the topping but I don't think it's needed.  It's pretty darn good just as it is!

Baked smaller version using only two Granny Smith apples sliced in a round pie plate. Sprinkled some lemon juice over the apples. Actually I like using the water called for because I like my pie juicy. I used only half the topping and instead of adding melted butter to flour mixture, I drizzled the butter separately over the whole pie. Just works for me. Next time I will try suggested dried cranberry and walnuts. yummy!

Time and time again I use this recipe. Different variations, low sugar, different fruits, sometimes with instant (even flavored oatmeal), substituting coconut oil for butter....the list goes on but the basics of this wonderful recipe remain the same. Perfectly done every time. Thank you!

I never made an apple crisp before and was really impressed with how easy this dish is to make. I gave it 4 stars because if I went solely on the recipe alone I do not think it would warrant 5 stars.  I made some changes.. Now as far as the apples go.. I used aprox. 7 medium Granny Smith apples and 5 small Fugi apples.( I have an applecorer/peeler/slicer)  I however prefer a slighty thicker slice than the slicer produces..so what I did was just use the peeler, then a hand corer/slicer and cut those slices in half. I did use the amount of sugar/four that it called for; however I mixed it with the apples in the 9x13 baking dish...  I added more than 1 Tsp. of ground cinnamon to the apple mixture to where the apples were generously coated, in addition I also added 4 rasps of fresh nutmeg to the mixture.  I also reduced the amount of water to only use 1/4 cup.   I doubled the crisp part added cinnamon and cut in cold butter and set the mixture in the fridge for approx. 30mins to chill. The bake time was perfect and after baking left it in the oven on the warm setting to have later after our main meal, the crisp held nicely.  I highly suggest that you use Granny Smith apples as the main apple and Fugi for the remaining. I promise that you will have a nicely cooked apple and not applesauce =) This dish was perfect and not too sweet, I served with Dryers french vanilla slow churned ice cream.. omg was to die for!!  I will make this again!!!

This was yummy and I'll definitely make it again.  Because I needed to make it ahead and bake later, I tossed the apples in fresh lemon juice.  I did not use nearly 1 cup of white sugar, I just kind of sprinkled it over the apples and MAYBE used 1/4 cup at most and it was PLENTY!  I added some nutmeg as well.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the topping which was really good.  I did not use 1/2 cup water, thought it would be too soupy, so used about 1/4 cup.  Also - I cut cold butter into the topping, rather than melted. In the end, I felt it was still a bit too sweet and might consider cutting back the brown sugar and leaving the white sugar out all together.  As the apples bake, they do sweeten up a bit (compared to a raw apple), so I don't think quite that much sugar is needed.  Also I used Braeburn and pink lady - a mix, hoping for sweet/ tart and that worked out pretty good, except all of the apples seemed a bit too soft, will research a more 'sturdy' apple to use next time.  Also, will leave out the water all-together as that might have contributed to making them too soft.

I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add any water.  It's a good thing I didn't because there was a lot of juice in the bottom of the pan after baking.  This desert was entirely too sweet for our liking.  In fact neither my husband or I finished our serving and we threw the rest of the desert out.  There may be nothing wrong with the recipe.  It's just our personal taste.  We prefer my old recipe for apple crisp and I will stick to that in the future.  Sometimes new is not always better.

I thought this was good but not fantastic. I added 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon for more flavor and I thought it was still a bit bland. I was lazy and didn't peel the apples, if anyone else is thinking of skipping that step don't! The skins didn't cook down which I thought they would, so that is my mistake and didn't judge my review on this mistake. The crumb topping though was very good.

I ruined this recipe by using granny smith apples.... Don't make my mistake... Use Macintosh or a baking apple. Granny smith tart flavor killed this dessert. Husband still ate it cause he is so sweet.

I made a half batch of this recipe, but made the original size amount of crust. The flavor on this was just so so for me. Kind of bland. Next time I'll up the brown sugar and cinnamon and add vanilla. I only used 1/8 cup of water and that seemed to work fine. It was ok, but I'll definitely increase the seasonings for next time.

The original recipe is very good. With my tweaking, I would rate it 5stars. The oatmeal should be substituted with Old fashioned oats for a coarser more rustic crumble, I replace the cinnamon with apple pie spice, and adjust the amount of white sugar based on the sweetness of the apples I'm using. I also only use melted "butter spread" like Country Crock, to cut back on the calories & cholesterol that would be added with real butter. Oh, and forget the water.. what the heck is that for?

This was delicious!  We all loved it!  :)  I did not peel the apples and used a combo of red delicious and granny apple. We topped it with homemade whipped cream.  The only thing I would change is maybe cut down the sugar a bit.  I think it would still taste great and be a bit healthier!

This is the best apple crisp I have ever made! It was also very easy to make. I eliminated the water that the recipe calls for and there was an adequate amount of moisture at the end of baking. I also added an additional 2 cups of apples. It is a hit with family and friends and others have requested this recipe from me!

i followed this recipe exactly except i doubled the topping and it came out great. the water is what makes the gooey saucyness in the apples. next time i will half the white sugar though, it doesnt need it.

The basic recipe is very good. After reading several other reviews I elected to double the topping...it was a bit too much. I would probably go with 1 1/2 times the recipe. As well, I would up the butter just a bit. Very tasty and definitely better with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I've made a few changes to fit my family. Substitute nutmeg for the cinnamon (my daughter's allergic) and use cornstarch instead of flour to thicken. I also add a little nutmeg to the crumble and toss in some chopped slivered almonds for additional flavor and crunch - even crunchy when reheated in microwave! Unlike some, I use the water because we like a lot of juice. It's a cross between a crisp and a cobbler. This is definitely a keeper that I make often!

Made with Mutsu apples, will probably use Granny Smith next time.  Didnt add water and would probably add a pinch of salt next time.  Great recipe, really crispy topping!

This is by far the best apple crisp recipe I have ever had. My dad used to make it just like this when I was little, so it definitely has a homey feel to it. I've found it can be made easily with gluten free ingredients, and it doesn't taste any different. I just use my gluten free flour mix which consists of corn flour, rice flour, tapioca starch and zanthum gum. I only use about 2/3 of the sugar recommended in this recipe otherwise it's much too sweet. Also, this recipe should definitely specify using granny smith apples. Any other apple is too sweet or not acidic enough, it just tastes like eating sugar. If you don't have granny smith apples on hand, just pour some lemon juice or vinegar on the apples and it tastes just about the same. As for the water, a 1/2 cup is too much for me. I use a 1/3 cup and it's just right. That way it becomes more caramelized and less soupy. I add just a touch more butter to the topping, it makes it just a little crispier and tastier. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a people pleasing dessert. This one is staying in my recipe box for a long time.

This crisp was easy to make and turned out great. I wasn't able to find good tart apples, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 C. and gave a good squirt of lemon juice on top of the apples before sprinkling on the oatmeal topping. I got the tart flavor I was hoping for and the sweetness is perfect.

This recipe is easy and affordable to make.  It is very sweet and I found it slightly bland or one-note--cinnamon sugar, but still tasty.
I think that this could be a real crowd pleaser for a potluck or something like that because it doesn't have any dairy, eggs, nuts or other ingredients that people tend to be allergic to or dislike.

Yum!  This recipe is delicious!! I used Cortland apples.  For the topping, here's what I did differently: I doubled the amount of oatmeal. I used half the amount of flour and replaced the other half with graham cracker crumbles.   I also added some crushed pecans.  I used a little less sugar than called for on both the apples and in the topping because the grahams have sugar to compensate. I used another 1/2 cup of butter for moisture. I doubled the topping because we like a lot of crumble.  I coated the bottom of the pan with crumble as then put a generous layer over the top.  YUM YUM YUM!!

This was fabulous!  I had a deep dish crust I needed to use  so put 3 cubed red apples directly in it and added the spices (1/2 of the recipe) minus the water.  Used the same crumble topping (again  1/2 of the recipe).  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it!  Will definitely make again....

I used home grown gala apples for this recipe and although the apples are softer than green apples.  The crisp turned out wonderful!! My husband and I loved it.   If you don't want something so sweet lower the sugar amount.

Delicious! I used 4 large apples and 1 small (3 pink lady, 2 fuji) and that seemed like a good amount. I baked them in an 8x8 glass pyrex and like others did half white half brown sugar and also just put a splash of water in with it. I also added nutmeg and a hint of cloves as I love those flavors in my apple baking. Four stars because it wasn't as pretty as I'd hope for, I felt like need modifications, and the texture wasn't quite what I wanted. But its taste is superb!

This is delicious!!!  Next time, though, I will use less sugar on apples and I left out the water.  I baked on 8x8 stoneware.  I did use only 7 apples and 1/2 of sugar for the apples.  I did however use the full amount of topping ingredients. I highly recommend this recipe.  It's only the two of us.  It's almost gone!! This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is so delicious!! I did make changes following other reviews. Cut the Sugar in half and made double the topping. Could almost even cut 3/4 of the sugar in the filling as well. I have made this 3 times now and it is truly a wonderful recipe.

I received many compliments on the 2 crisps I made using this recipe.  I did make a little extra of the topping and pressed it into the bottom of the pan as a crust.  And for 1 of the crisps, I omitted the cinnamon and added a scoop of caramal topping into the apples mixture for a more caramel-y apple crisp.

This was a huge hit at my house.  I have made it 3 times in the last month and it never lasts more than 24 hours.  This is a keeper!

I loved it. My family loved it. I substituted splenda for both the white sugar and the brown sugar and it came out great! Will definitely use this quick and easy recipe again and again.

My husband, in-laws and 17-month-old son loved it! I will definitely make it again! As others suggested I doubled the topping, added a little bit of nutmeg and cut the water in half. It was perfect!

I cut the apples in chunks, mixed them with the sugar, flour, and cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, omitted the water, and doubled the topping. DELISH!

I will never search for another Apple Crisp recipe again. This, by far, is the best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried, cooked, or eaten. I'd like to give it 11 out of 5 stars, but I can't, so 5/5 it is...

Usually I would just wing a crisp recipe... they are all pretty standard when it comes to composition... 
That being said, this is one of the best recipes for crisp I have found. I did spiff it up a bit making it my own "Caramel Apple crisp" for the Holiday season, but it was an amazing hit at the potluck I brought it to.  I made it according to recipe, save adding a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the apple mixture and over the very top of the crumble mixture.  It did take a little longer than an hour for cooking time, but well worth the wait.  Just as one other review stated this was not completely done cooking in a 45 minute period at 350.
I let the dessert cool for about an hour or so and just before serving warm, I lightly drizzled the top of the crumbled crisp evenly with that caramel apple dip (note that I only used a small amount, probably 2-3 ounces, NOT the whole container) that they sell in the produce department of your local grocery store and served it with Tillamook Vanilla Bean Ice cream.  
There wasn't any leftover :)

I have made this apple crisp a few times now and my family liked it most when I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and I also drizzled homemade caramel on top.

Do NOT double the topping in this recipe...I found it way too much.  I thought there was too much sugar in it overall, I think I would reduce the sugar by half.

Made this using fresh Honey Crisp Apples (LARGE) 4 Large apples FILLED my 9x13. I followed the recipe just the way it says and it was PERFECT better than my last one I made. Next time I make it I will add less water if I add any at all though (I think the water depends on the apples you use though!). Definitely making again!

I've made this once before and it was such a huge hit in my house that I have a batch in the oven again tonight.  So amazingly yummy and a bargain when those apples go on sale.  First time I made it with Granny smith apples and now I got some Galas in the oven and this time I used a sugar/splenda blend for the cup of white sugar.  I'll edit this review and say how it turned out.

This was sooooo good!  I made this yesterday to bring to a bonfire/hayride.  It was a HUGE hit with everyone.  I heard things like, "you really outdid yourself on this one" and "you know where I live".  My search is over.  I'll never need another apple crisp recipe. Thanks so much for a wonderful Fall recipe Diane.

I found this recipe because I had run out of yellow cake mix, which is what I usually use to make apple crisp.  I thought this was MUCH better!  I used sugar in the raw (turbinado sugar) instead of both the white and brown sugars.  Made it for a Christmas potluck.  It was GONE!

This was very good and easy to make.  I use Splenda in place of the white sugar, guess it might help a little. Ive made it a few times now, when I use MacIntosh I cut the sugar in half but not the brown sugar. I wait till the apples around home arent getting eaten fast enough and use whats left for the crisp. This doesn't last long at all.

This was my first apple crisp that I ever made. My son and I ate the entire 9x13 pan in two nights. Best recipe ever. We are not generally over eaters, but we ate it for breakfast, lunch and at bedtime.  I am making my second batch two days later. The only thing I did different was double the topping and a pinch of nutmeg to the apples. YUMMMMMMMMYYYY!

My dad said this was the best apple crisp he has ever had (and he is 64, so I think he has had a lot if apple crisp).  I have to agree!  It is a little different than what I am used to, as the topping was crunchy (unfortunately, I am used to apple crisp with a somewhat crispy/soggy oatmeal topping), and it was a really nice surprise!  This will be my "go to" recipe from now on.  Oh, my family doesn't like nutmeg, so I left it out and you would never guess anything was missing.  Truly terrific!

OMG! I made this Sunday after trying another Apple Crisp recipe a couple of weeks ago which I was disappointed with.  I was hesitant because the recipe called for water but the finish product was delicious and that was without ice cream! I used Gala apples because they were on sale. This is now my go to recipe for Apple Crisp.

This crisp is AMAZING!!! I added about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and only a 1/4 cup of water like some reviewers said, and I also mixed the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the apples. I went ahead and doubled the crumb topping because reviewers recommended it, but it was WAY too much topping!!! Next time I will times the topping recipe by 1 1/2-- I think that will be perfect. Also, I cut in the butter instead of melting it. I was so incredibly delicious! :-)

Oh my word...This recipe was FANTASTIC. I followed the advice of the others and and doubled the amount for the crust and still found that was not enough for me so I ended up tripling the crust recipe. I also ended up baking it for an extra 15 minutes just bc of my adjustments. It was just sweet enough and the crust was golden and crumbly and made my entire apartment smell like fall heaven! I will definitely be making this again this season

Loved this!  Rather than just throwing it all in the pan, my husband requested an "apple crisp pie".  So I halved the apple portion, made a pie crust for the bottom, and still put the crisp on top.  It was the best of both worlds!

I used Honey Gold apples and cut the sugar down quite a bit (1/2 cup on apples, 1/2 cup in topping).  I always cut sugar down in recipes, and I would cut it down even more next time because I prefer my apple crisp slightly tart.  I did not use the water as recommended by others, and the apples cooked up perfectly.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and cooked for about 55 minutes.  My crumble was just slightly browned on the top, and the apples were bubbling around the edges (that's how my mom taught me to tell if it's done).

We didn't know how many apples equaled 10 cups and used 10 apples. We had to use a larger pan and doubled all the ingredients (except the water). By doubling, we made a ridiculous amount of topping and didn't use all of it. I think next time we may cut back on the white sugar a bit since there is so much brown sugar in the topping, but it is delicious exactly the way it is.

One thing I will note that I think made this stand out - we used Vietnamese cinnamon.

halved everything and put in an 8x8 dish. a little watery so use less water next time. 10/13: full recipe, used a variety of apples, very good.  i used half the water in the recipe and it was still watery.  some users suggesting mixing the white sugar mixture in with the apples instead of sprinkling on top, next time try that and use only 1/8th a cup of water.10/14: 1/8 th cup of water and double the flour in the sugar mix worked well. used 5 granny smith and could have used 2 more to fill large white dish. 10/15: used 7 apples and could have used 3 more in metal baking dish.  also used no water and it was good, doubled flour too.

Sweet baby Ray!!! This was so good that I just had seconds!I did add a dash of clove and instead of water,added Motts natural pressed cider.I also cut way back on the sugar.I did the crumble exactly to the recipe but did double it because everyone loves a good crumble!!I used a mix of granny Smith and jazz apples too...the sweet tart flavour almost did me in it was so good!!!!

We liked this. I had some gala apples that were a week or two old. They stayed solid but were soft enough for my little one.The top turned out kind of like an oatmeal cookie. Soft and yet crumbly. Made it gluten free by using GF oats & GF oat flour plus xanthan gum for cohesion. I also added nutmeg.Will probably make this again, upping the oats to 1.5C and lowering flour to .5C. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  My family loved it and I didn't change anything except adding less water as others suggested.  I also only had whole wheat flour, I don't suggest using that.  Mine had a slightly wheaty flavor that I didn't like but no one else seemed to notice.

For this recipe I used 7 cups of Gravenstein and 3 cups of Pink Lady apples. My family found this crisp way, way too sweet. I like that this is a simple recipe and I'll probably try it again, but with much less sugar. (Perhaps I can eliminate the white sugar altogether?)

Yummy!  I don't like my crisp too sweet so I used Granny Smith apples and cut out the white sugar altogether. I also cut the water amount down to just 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.

Love this recipe!  Like others, I omitted the water, made the slices larger.  I didn't melt the butte but cut cold butter in small cubes and mixed into the oatmeal and flour mixture.  Tasty!

This was excellent! It had the perfect amount of seasoning and sweetness and the apples came out tender and perfectly cooked. My husband was convinced it was canned filling. (I think it tastes way better than canned!)

This is a good apple crisp.  I made it with home grown jonnagold apples.  The only thing I changed was to use Old Fashioned Rolled Oats, because that is all I had in the house.  I think I might try brown sugar vs. white sugar next time I make it to give it a more caramel flavor.  Pecans would be good in the topping also.

I also omitted the water, and since I had no oats, I used cereal! (golden puffs) Turned out great!  Especially good with vanilla ice cream.

Pretty good. Because I added some blueberries it turned out a little soggy and the topping that I doubled didn't turn very "crispy". Regardless my family still liked it, and next time I will use only apples.

Don't get me wrong, I love sugar.  One of my favourite indulgences is fudge, but this apple crisp is far too sweet.  I'd cut the white sugar entirely and let the taste of the apples speak for themselves.  The crumble turned out well.

The best apple crisp recipe I've ever had!

I used Granny Smith apples and didn't add any water and it came out perfectly. Next time I'll peel the apples.

Delish! Thanks for sharing. This was really easy, and I had everything on hand. I had some apples I really need to use up and this was perfect. I halved the recipe because there are just 3 of us, but it disappeared right away. So it looks like I'll be making it again!

Great recipe. I got rave reviews from the potluckers. I did leave out the water and cut the butter into the oats mixture. Used early harvest (sour) apples and it was perfect.

Yummmmmmy! Made it for Father's Day. I added the suggested 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2, and doubled the topping. Next time I will add a few more apples and put a tad less topping (although it was devine!) Will definately make again!

Fantastic! I doubled the topping, added a little nutmeg to the apple mixture and used apple juice instead of water. I did not cut down on the amount of liquid - I used 1/2 cup and it made the perfect amount of appley, caramely syrup. Fuji apples are my favorite and they did not disappoint in this recipe. Served with vanilla bean ice cream... Hard to beat!!

My husband loved, loved loved this recipe!! I made this for our Memorial Day party with a 1/2 pint of blueberries, quart of strawberries and 4 or 5 apples. I took the other reviewers advice and doubled the topping. Will definitely make this again.

My husband loves this when I make this.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to a T and found it to be too watery. The last two times I've made it, I only put a few tablespoons of water and it was perfect. I also mixed the sugar and cinnamon with the sliced apples and I added a touch of vanilla to it. Perfecto! Thanks for this recipe :)

I am pregnant with twins and had a craving for apple crisp....but had never made it and didnt have a recipe.  I picked this one for how easy it looked  and the great reviews. It did not disappoint! Small changes I made were to not peel the apples, add nutmeg, use only 1/4 c. water and I made a little extra topping.  It was fabulous! And between my husband and I, gone in 2 days...

This tasted like the filling of an apple pie. I even got my husband to eat some which is a big deal in this house. I put half the amount of flour and white sugar and used only about 6 apples. I added a tsp of water in the apple/sugar mixture and then halfway during baking I poured water over the top, just enough to wet the crumbles on top. I baked it in a small convection oven so it worked well. I will definitely be making this again in a larger oven.

This is now my "go to" apple crisp recipe. I have been trying to find a great recipe that is big enough for a crowd and this one fits the bill. I have made it over and over and it never lasts long. Thank you for sharing it!! I also skipped the water with good results. I put it in the first time I made it and thought it was too soupy.

This is an awesome recipe, so good.  I cut down on the white sugar with the apples, forgot the flour and it still turned out great.  The water seemed to help make a carmel syrup that was so nice.  Used spy apples that held their shape.  The topping is very nice.

Like the other reviewers, I would not add the 1/2 cup water. I would still add water, but not that much it was quite watery. If you let it sit after cooking some of the water soaks up. 

I also found that it didnt have a lot of taste. It was sweet, but bland. I don't think I would follow this recipe again.

I made this recipe with half the amount of apples, 1/4 cup sugar & doubled the cinnamon & a pinch of nutmeg. Also I cut the other ingredients to half but still put 1/4 of the sugar and still it´s sweet. I loved it.

I added 1/2 cup of ground walnuts and sprinkled it over the topping.  It gave it a nutty flavor that was non-intrusive.  Yum!!  This recipe is a wonderful middle ground in a family that 1/2 prefer oatmeal topping and 1/2 prefer a more cake like topping.  This is the new favorite for both sides.

This was so tasty. The whole family loved it. I followed the instructions as written. Next time I will try only half the water and half the white sugar. I wouldn't double the topping as I had plenty to cover a 9x13 dish. We served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  I like cranberries (dried, fresh or frozen) in my Crisp just for an added tartness.

I used to make an apple crisp that was similar to this, but I never used an actual recipe.  I went hunting for something similar on this website and ran across this recipe.  I just made a half size portion of this and my family loved it; my daughter is whining for seconds while I type.  I made it according to the recipe, but I did reduce the amount of white and brown sugar.  I think next time I will add a little more of both sugars and have some vanilla icecream to go on top.  This is a simple and tasty dessert which I highly recommend.

Absolutely Delicious!  Although I did make 2 minor alterations, as suggested by previous reviewers, so it's more like a 4.9 star recipe instead of a true 5 :).  I doubled the topping (couldn't imagine NOT doing that!), and I used only 1/4 cup of water (instead of the suggested 1/2) and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon to brighten it up a bit.  I used Granny Smith apples, and they were just perfect.  I noticed that when we cut into it the first night, there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan, but as it continued to cool--even into the next day, the liquid thickened into a delicious syrupy caramel-y sauce.  Best apple crisp we've ever had--by far!

This was great! I halved the amount of sugar, and will try eliminating it all together next time and exchanging the water for apple sauce. I also doubled the crumble, and layered it top and bottom. Fun to make with my 2yr old son :)

I used 2 15 ounce canned apple pie filling instead of the 1st half, but used the crisp recipe for my topping. Filled a 9 in deep pie dish and only needed about 3/4 of the topping. Instead of melted butter I used cold cut butter and used my hands to mix it. It seemed dry but after baking it came out perfect. I will use fresh aples next time and this dish would be perfect!

This was great! The oats add a nice crumbly texture to the crust. I prefer to sprinkle the crust on top, and not pack it down. I used red delicious, so I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and tossed the apples with the mixture. I also added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the crust.

very good recipe, made a few changes, omitted the water that is poured over apples all togather, doubled the topping part of recipe, and placed half of it on bottom of 9x13 then layered the apples and then the rest of the topping. Took to family dinner, everyone loved it and said it was the best apple crips they have had. Did not turn out dry at all by omitting the water.

Added pitted tart cherries for some extra zing.  Doubled the topping as suggested by others, but found it too much.  Next time will make it 1.5 times as much.

Good as it stands. Better with the reviewers' suggestion to double the "crisp" part. 

I botched one of my tries by using a different kind of oats. Very important to use quick cooking whole oats. Otherwise, they can be toothy.

This crisp recipe is SO good! I forgot the tablespoons of flour that go on the apples. It turned out just fine. Not runny at all. I added nutmeg because I like the taste. :-) I used fresh rolled oats. I doubled the topping because I love it so much! After it was done baking the topping had a very light crispiness to it that was probably a result of the baking powder and soda. VERY pleasing!

Yummy!  My 8 year old proclaimed this "the best dessert ever!" and said I should make it every day (uh, no).  He really like the oatmeal in the topping which was a surprise to me.

Love this crisp! It tastes much richer than other recipes. I doubled the topping, but think it isn't necessary. It seemed out of balance with the apples. Stick to the recipe and it's good. Add more cinnamon and it's great!

This is awesome!  The best apple crisp I've ever had.  I omitted the water every time, and added a light sprinkling of brown sugar over the top before baking.  I receive compliments every single time I make this.

the crumb topping needs flavor.  you can taste too much flour.  The next time i will add salt and cinnamon.  I used Rome apples and they were a little mushy although I cut the water to 2 tblsp.   i also cut the  white sugar in half, to 1/2 cup and that was plenty sweet.

Made this several times and it's always a hit!  Turns out better if you don't over melt butter and really mix well with the oats.

WOW!!! Made this last night, left the peel on Granny Smiths (6 of them) thin slices. Made to 'T'. last night was good, TONIGHT = AWESOME, all the flavors came together and the apples softened up nicely. Wonderful blend of flavors. Husband loves it as do I:) Will try some pecans or walnuts and maybe a handfull of raisins next time just for kicks. This Recipe 'ROCKS' HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  Thanks for sharing, Diane:)

This is a great recipe.  I typically double the amount of crumble and make one 9x13 and one 9x9 pan. I also only add about half the amount of water.

Also, I rubbed butter along the bottom of the baking dish, and then sprinkled brown sugar on top before adding all of the ingredients in the dish! Was sooo yummy!! Finished with french vanilla ice-cream on top!!

Exactly the Apple Crisp recipe I was looking for!!  Great way to use those apples that are no longer so good for eating out of hand.  Works well to halve and bake in a smaller pyrex or deep dish pie plate.

Way too sweet.  Next time I would cut both the sugars in half.  I was fine with the liquid and the cinnamon mixed completely through the apples.

this was pretty amazing. the first time it was a little watery, but when I cut the water down by half the second time it was perfect. I sliced the apples as thin as I could and they were nice and soft after they cooked. it's a sweet dessert, but that's not because of any flaws in the recipe.

I used half Granny Smith and half Red Delicious.  I think the mixture of the two balanced the sourness of the green apples with the "applesauce" tendency other people noted with the red delicious.  It was perfect!!

I made this for Thanksgiving as a back-up dessert.  This is definitely a keeper for me and my family.  I didn't change a thing other than halved the recipe and it came out absolutely perfect.  I used Empire apples and they worked well.  Can't wait to make this again!

FANTASTIC!!! I've tried several of the apple crisp recipes and this one is a WINNER!!!!  I will eliminate the water the next time I make it (it wasn't necessary at all).. I also used granny smith apples. Easy, fast recipe to make.  Delicious and got lots of "OMG, so good" from fussy family members.

I made this one weekend for my dad and he has asked me to make it almost every weekend after. We are both very picky about our apple crisp and this recipe was wonderful. I used more than 10 apples because we like more apples. Since we used fresh Orchard apples I left out the water and still had to syphon off some juice after it baked.

Great recipe! I doubled the topping and added 1/4 t of nutmeg as other reviewers suggested.  I've made it with different kinds of apples and my favorite was with Wealthy apples.  If you can find this variety I recommend you use them.

my husband and I and his father had this tonight for dessert. It was amazing! my husband loved it so much he had two bowls! I cut down the white sugar to 1/2 a cup and doubled the topping and used granny smith apples. It was wonderful. Although 30 minutes in the oven, because 45 is too long as the apples will turn to mush.

I took the advice of other reviewers and I only used a splash of water which worked out great. Also I did not melt the butter I cut it in...big mistake the topping came out floury and dry, MELT the butter!  I also added a pinch of nutmeg to the apples(YUM)
Depending on the type of apples you are using the cook time may vary I used granny smith and honey crisp sliced thin and had to increase the cooking time by 20 min. So melt the butter and use less water and it's delicious.

I followed other reviews advice and doubled the topping and cut the water in half. I regret doing this. There was way to much topping and the apples were dry! When I make again I will follow the recipe exactly how its written. The flavors are nice.

This was fabulous!  Best crisp I've had.  Maybe it is the baking powder & soda that makes such a nice topping.  I used much less sugar, I tend to like things less sweet than most other people.  I used half the amount of apple filling but the full amount of topping.  That was a lot of topping, probably too much for most people.  I was going to add walnuts but forgot, that's okay since it was great without.  I used brown sugar instead of white in the filling and I didn't measure but just sprinkled a small amount over the apples.  I also added some nutmeg.  Next time I need to be sure to cut the apples into larger pieces, the apples got too soft.  Don't think I need to try any other crisp recipes!

This is definitely legit! I halved the water and doubled the topping and it was great but i did add a little touch with my caramel topping..... 36 individual caramel pieces in a pot with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of butter simmer on low and stir stir stir set aside and let cool for 20 min then poor on top of apple crisp. you can thank me later!

Delish! Very easy. I used some Red Delicious apples I had on hand, and I think i used 10 or 12 of them (they weren't very big). I did put the sliced apples in a gallon zipper bag, added a little lemon juice to stop them from browning. Then I added the flour, sugar and cinnamon to the bag and shook it. And, I only used 1/4 cup of water. Smelled SO good while it was cooking. Served with whipped topping and ice cream :)

Delicious!!  I used granny smith apples so I added a bit of brown sugar to the apple mixture.  I used just a tad less water than recommended and also doubled the oatmeal crunch mixture on top because that part is so yummy!  It turned out perfectly!  I will absolutely make this recipe again, thank you!!!!

I made this last weekend and it was a hit, so I am making it again this week and I hope to share more of it.  My daughter ate half of it by Monday, so I told her to slow down.  I shared the remainder with 2 co workers who loved it also!  This one is a keeper and I did it just as written!  Once the apples are cored and cut it is a breeze to make.

BEST APPLE CRISP RECIPE EVER!  There I said it!  Stop looking at tons of apple crisp recipes, this one has over 3,000 reviews, how can it not be fabulous?  I doubled the crumble topping because really, how can you ever have too much crumble on your crisp?  I went wild and left the water at 1/2 a cup and it is juicy, but with double the crumble who cares?  So go crumble crazy with this crisp and be ready to moan!  Enjoying the good life includes apple crisp!

Apple Crisp was excellent, everyone loved it.  I made some substitution/addition just on personal preference.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar,  1/4 cup orange juice instead of water and added some raisins.  Excellent!!!

Excellent crisp. Used my apple core/peeler and made the job super easy!!! Such a good & simple recipe. I used extra cinnamon. Made a double batch making two 9x13s & shared with my parents and our neighbors.

Used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Tossed apples and did not add water.  Used 1-1/2 times crust ingredients.  Awesome--my family loved this.  I'm throwing away any other apple crisp recipes that I have.

I really like this recipe. I had to cut the sugar in half for the apples and the crumble, because it was too sweet. I also ran the oatmeal through a food processor. This is one of my favorites!

This is the best Apple Crisp I have ever made. I used fuji apples, only added a splash of water, and doubled the crust as other reviewers suggested. My family loved it so this will now be the only apple crisp recipe I use.

Perfection!  Aside from halving the recipe, I followed it exactly.  It wasn't too sweet, or too soupy, nor did it need more topping.  thank you Diane for this outstanding recipe.

I use this as a guide b/c I tend to measure like Rachel Ray (pinch here, palm full there, fill up to about here). I made a roasting pan of this: filled it 1/2 way up with apples, (i did then sprinkle some nutmeg like others mentioned) and the other half with topping....oh so yummy!

Easy recipe and very good, but way, way too sweet.  It over powers the tartness of the apples.  You need to have some zing.  I'd cut back on the White sugar.

I'm eating this right now and it's wonderful! It's sweet and has some crunchiness from the oats. I followed this recipe exactly too. I'm definitely making this again. Some might find it hard to measure out 10 cups of apples. I peeled and cored 11 apples. I figured each apple would be just under a cup. Then I sliced each slice in half longwise again.

Loved it!!! Cut down on the sugars by half and it's perfect, serve with ice cream is a must. I made mine in a pie dish using 5 gala apples, halved the flour and sugar, and topping as is, next time, half the sugar for the topping too, but still delicious. Yum!

I use this site all the time and have never written a review until now. This is a fantastic recipe, my family just raved about it!  I used Jonagold apples and added 1/2 tsp apple pie spice  to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I think its better to to toss the apples in with the ingredients as it coats the apples better.  I read the reviews before making this and only used 1/4 cup water however, next time I will skip the water altogether.  I also doubled the topping as others suggeted. This is definately a keeper, one I'll be adding to our family favorites!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this tonight, trying to use up some of the apples we picked yesterday. It turned out great! I changed a few things, based on what I had in the house. I used honeycrisp apples, and added allspice and nutmeg to them along with the cinnamon. I tweaked the topping a bit, using a packet of flax oatmeal mixed with old fashioned oats and sliced almonds. It gave the topping a little more bite and crunch. We loved it! I threw the apple mix into my cast iron skillet, topped them with some caramel sauce, then the oat mix and baked at 350 for 20 or so minutes. Will definitely be making again soon!

Perfect!  I reduced the water to 1/4 cup.  I also mixed the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture with the apples before putting in the pan.  Didn't melt the butter, but instead cut it into the flour/sugar mixture and then added the oats.  It was a hit for all!

This was very tasty and hit the spot for that after-dinner sweet we all wanted. My only complaint is that I would have wanted the crisp part to be crispy/crunchy, other than that, this was delicious and I would certainly make this over again. I used apples I had on hand - no granny smiths nor red delicious and it was wonderful. 5 stars on taste and ease. Thanks for sharing!

First time I have ever made apple crisp and it came out amazing! I have to eat gluten free so I substituted gluten free flour and I also used only 1/4 cup water. It was a touch watery so next time I will use a bit less water. Awesome recipe!!!

I will rate this 4starsonly because I found it to be too sweet. Could be just me as I tend to cut down on the sugar in all recipes. I used  turbo ado sugar  in the topping and it was absolutely delicious.I used Gravensteins the first time I made it and macs the next time. Both are excellent choices. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I made this apple crisp tonight for the first time.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except for cutting the water to 1/4 cup.  It turned out delicious.  I would have to say it was the best apple crisp I've ever had.  This recipe is a keeper.

We LOVE this!!  I kept all of the measurements as listed.  The only changes I made were the following:  tossed the apples to coat with the sugar, flour, and cinnamon, omitted the water, cut cold butter in to the oat mixture, and baked for one hour.  Served warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream - delicious!

This was absolutely amazing! It is the perfect fall recipe. I can't wait to try this topping over cherries and pears. I cut back to 3/4 cup white sugar because I wanted to taste more apple, but I didn't think about cutting back on the water...note to self for next time. Anyways, I loved it!

This was amazing, I added frozen berry blend (blueberries, raspberries, cranberries) atop the apples before adding the crumble and served it with vanilla ice cream on top.  AMAZING, and super easy, thanks for posting!

I used 6 granny smith apples.  Added only 3 TB of water, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and added a handful of craisins.  It was very tasty, not actually very crisp but that may be because we didn't let it sit long enough.

followed the recipe to a t - except i subbed half of the butter for applesauce and used splenda. unfortunately the apples came out extremely mushy, and the top wasn't crunchy enough to my liking. I think it could have used more time in the oven.

This recipe is excellent and YUMMY! Just as good or better than an apple pie, and super easy. I suggest you only use 1/4 c water, not 1/2 cup water. Best crisp ever!

I thought this was good but not exceptional. It was a little too sweet, for one thing. I followed the recipe as written except for using cider in place of water. It did not seem to have enough bulk in the mouth. If I were to make it again, I would use a little less sugar and double the topping mix.

I made this recipe without reading the reviews first.  I followed the recipe as written.  Like many of the others, mine was runny too.  I was hoping it would thicken upon standing, but it has not.  Next time, very little or no water. As a matter of personal taste, I used Macintosh apples.  Very good recipe.  Will make again.

This was an excellent recipe!  I did make alterations though, to fit in my dietary requirements.  Here's what I changed:  Instead of 1 Tbls flour on the apples, I used 1/2 Tbls corn starch, I then took out 1/2 cup of regular all-purpose flour and replaced it with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  Instead of butter I used a diet margarine and instead of pure sugar on the apples I used 1 cup of Splenda baking mix.  I did use 6 Granny Smith apples, but followed the steps exactly, including temp and baking time.  It came out great!  Top is crispy, apples are sweet and delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

I followed the reviewers comments, adding double the topping and omitting the water. I had placed the cut apples in a bowl of water with lemon juice to keep them fresh before I baked them,and after draining, there was just a tiny bit of water left, and it was plenty.  That said, with those changes, it was PERFECT! Probably the best apple crisp I've ever had! Five stars isn't enough!

My family loved it.  My only tweaks were since I was using fresh tree apples, I too used no water and prepared the flour, cinn, and sugar then threw in apples and stirred over.  I also doubled the topping which was prepared by cutting in soft butter (not melted) and added nutmeg and cinnamon to that mixture.  Awesome!

This is the first recipe from allrecipes.com that I have completely been amazed by!  I followed the directions to a "T" like always when trying someone else recipe and it's perfect.  Absolutely amazing and great for fall!

This recipe is good but I added some nutmeg. I used a mix of Jonagold apples and Granny Smith, which has always been my fav combination for apple pie. Now, I always add a bit of lemon juice, about a tablespoon or two  to the apples. It wakes the flavor of the fruit. My family and I like some chopped pecans or walnuts in the topping for extra crunch.

ABSOLUTELY NO WATER - it makes its own juice.  Also try with brown sugar and double the cinnamon.

Loved this recipe! So simple to prepare and then just into the oven it goes.  The only thing I would do and did is add more cinnamon! Nothing like a little more spice to truly make this a success!

This was an excellent Apple Crisp recipe.  I did change it a little.  I didn't add as much water, I  Only about 1/4 of a cup.  I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also like carmel on my apple crisp.  It was delicious warm with vanilla ice cream on top!

This recipe is really tasty. However, I normally read the reviews prior to making a recipe and i wish I hadnt forgotten this time. It seems everyone left out the water, which was a good idea because my apple crisp had some serious liquid at the bottom. I'm not sure if this is due to the types of apples I used (cortland and macintosh) or the water (or both) but I could do without the liquid gathered at the bottom. Otherwise a good recipe and I would repeat it with different apples and no water.

This is delicious! I decided to only make 1/2 batch to start with but after reading the other reviews I went with a 1/2 batch of the apple mixture (only using 1/8c. of water) but stayed with the whole recipe for the topping of oats, flour and brown sugar.  I topped it off with caramel swirl vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect addition!

Love this recipe and have been making it for years.  I tend to leave the water out, i find that the apples are usually juicy enough.  I always include a mixture of different types of apples and i double the recipe for the topping.  It seeps into the dish and you get some in every bite!!  Thanks for such a wonderful fall recipe, oh and you must pick the apples fresh if you live near some orchards, it is a perfect way to end a beautiful autumn afternoon!!

We absolutely LOVED the taste of this Crisp!  I did add some frozen berries (I did not have quite enough apples) and it turned out great!  Next time I would not add the 1/2 cup water.  My only complaint is that it was a bit soupy.

this is very good - just like Mom used to make !
I thought it would be too sweet when I put in the sugar, but it wasn't for our taste and those of the guests I served it to - got LOTS of raves on it !
I used small apples from my tree - wish I knew what kind they are as they are good for baking.
This is a keeper - thanks for the good receipe !

I think the recipe calls for too much butter - would cut by a 1/3 next time (crust was a a little "pasty").  Other than that, excellent!!  Serve warm, ala mode with a drizzle of caramel sundae sauce!

The best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried!  I did reduce the water to 1/4 cup.  I also only used 1/2 cup quick cooking oats and added one cup up pre-made pie crust to the topping mixture!!  So delicious!!

This crisp was AWESOME! I see why the recipe has 1/2 cup water, as the crisp bakes, the apples get really tender. The only thing I would do different next time is cut back on the white sugar to 1/2 cup.

Very good, easy and delicious!  I would definitely decrease the amount of water by at least half.  I didn't change the topping amount and it was fine.

Delicious! Based on the reviews, I did edit a little bit: I used 8 small gala apples, 1/2 c white sugar and added a little nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also only used 1/4 c of water and it came out perfect! YUM!

Great flavor, but I think I'd skip the water next time.  Mine was a little too runny. *Edited - Baked it longer to ensure the middle was bubbling and then it was a great consistency!

Amazing and simple! I used way less sugar (~1/3c) and brown sugar (~1/2 cup) and it still tasted great. I did not double the amount of topping as suggested by other reviewers but I cooked in a 9 inch pie pan.

I am not a huge cook and am a beginner. I made this for my husband because I wanted to see if I could do it! I did, and it turned out wonderful!! I doubled the topping and did not add water, and put the first ingredients needed right into the apples and let the sit to get the juices from the apples out.
I am now using this recipe for peaches (they were on sale)!! I don't know if it will turn out, but I am trying it anyways because all the peach recipes don't have the crisp topping I like! I also let the peaches sit in the mixture to let the juices out, so I did not add water. Ran out of Brown Sugar so could not double to topping, but I am sure it will still be good!!

Everyone liked it. However I only used 2/3 cup of sugar with the apples and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I'd make it again!
Oh, and I baked it about an hour so that the apples were softer and blended together.

This is a famous, loved dessert in my home - very frequently requested. I do, however, double the crust. Overall, a favorite all around.

I doubled the topping and put some of it on the bottom per other reviews. I didn't add the water either and next time i'll use much less sugar. It was too sweet for me overall. Otherwise, very good.

The subject line of the first email I got about the apple crisp was this "KILLER APPLE CRISP!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG   Heavenly"  I tried the suggestion of others and made double the amount of the topping and put half on the bottom.  I didn't use any of the water but next time might use just a tablespoon or two at most and back off just a touch on the cup of sugar that I mixed with the apples.  If you like it extra sweet keep the full cup.

I definitely agree with previous reviewers about cutting the water in half and doubling the crumb topping and adding a dash of nutmeg. Amazing recipe! My guests loved it!

I made this recipe for someone who was going through a hard time... and she LOVED IT!!  She is constantly asking me for this recipe, as well as another plateful! I have made this twice, each time the fans were raving, and I have not even tried it yet. The next time I make this it will be for me!! I also doubled the crisp topping.

Amazing!  I've made this several times and have shared with family, friends, and coworkers - all whom have gluttoned themselves. I normally double the topping though - making one batch as the recipe calls for, and the other half leaving out the oats so it's just a butter crumb. My husband isn't a fan of oats.

I've made this twice now and it is truly fabulous!  Everyone will eat it and I love it as it is not dry like some apple crisp can be.  I followed some of the other suggestions and mix your apple slices with the sugar/cinnamon mixture (no water) and let them sit while you make the crisp.  Double the crisp recipe so you can put half on the bottom and half on the top.  Super yummy!

So so so good! I did, however, double the topping and halve the water, so I gave this only 4 stars. Next time I would just 1 1/2 the topping, but still double the butter. It was fantastic!

Delicious!!  I myself used red apples, about 4 or 5.  It was enough to make two round cake pans.  I didn't put any water in at all.  I tossed the apples in the mixture instead of sprinkling over them.  Also added nutmeg to the mix.  So good, it's being paired with french vanilla frozen yogurt and it's just out of the oven so it's still nice and warm.  So so good.  Will definetly be making again.

I used half blackberries (wanted to use some I had frozen) and half apples. I followed the recipe exactly, otherwise. I really like the topping. It's sweet and crunchy and chewy at the same time. Next time, I will decrease the sugar in the fruit and not add as much water.

The flavor of this is fantastic! I cut down on the amount of water, not quite 1/4 cup, and still found it really runny. I also added a bit of nutmeg. 
I will most definitely make this again!

this is a pretty good recipe. I did use tart apples & added all the sugar & water it suggested. I did not use all the topping as i felt it was a bit more topping than we are use to. Very simple & easy to make too

Good, but the apples needed more flavor and/or sugar. It's very good with ice cream.
Also, I would add more topping next time (maybe 1 1/2 times more).

I thought this recipe was okay, but not great.  My main complaint was that the crust was not as flavorful and sweet as I had hoped and it didn't crisp, even after an hour in the oven.  It was really just chewy and bland.  The apple mixture was quite tasty, though and altogether it was acceptable served with vanilla ice cream.

Simple yet delicious!  I purchased a bag of granny smiths that were a bit too tart and so I used them to make this apple crisp.  I actually only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet for my family.  I also used 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 1/2 cup and just sprayed the top with butter flavor Pam to save fat/calories.  Yum, Yum, Yum!

I love this recipe! I use it for any kind of fruit and it always turns out great. I do not add the water. I always make extra topping and put it into a jar and keep in the pantry for extra quick desserts.

This was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe. The only things I changed were as follows: First, I tossed the apples in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I used only 3/4 cup of white sugar because I like a bit of the apple's natural tartness. I add 1/3 cup of coconut to the topping. I didn't melt the butter, I cut it into the crumble mixture so it would be more crunchy. And, I used 1/4 cup water as opposed to 1/2.
 Altogether, absolutely amazing!

One word: Amazing. I too doubled the topping, that's a good choice if you like a better topping to apple ratio. I cut the water in half, but it didn't need any at all. I didn't believe the other reviewers.. but as usual.. they're right! I brought this to a church event and someone found me to shake my hand for making the amazing apple crisp.

Sadly, I was not too impressed with this recipe. I made this for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day.  I took others' advice and made double the topping, which was a mistake. Since there was so much crumb mixture, the topping on the outsides cooked too much while the inside didn't cook enough. My oven is fairly new and I doubt the problem was due to uneven cooking.

After reading all the great reviews, I was really exciting about making it, but neither my bf nor I thought it was that great. Definitely better served warm with ice cream, but a recipe should be great on its own too.  I can only hope my disappointment in this dish was due to doubling the topping. If I gave this dish a second chance, I would definitely stick to the original recipe.

Best apple crisp, hands down! I did make a few changes. I used honey crisp apples and they were pretty sweet so I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp of salt, I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the apple mixture. To the crumb topping, I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and two extra tablespoons of melted butter (i used salted butter). It was delicious! Served it hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce. Perfect comfort food!

Split the recipe into 3 loaf pans and made as directed. I used about 8 apples, but would try more next time just to increase theamount of fruit I can get into my family.

This was great. The only change I made was 1/4 cup water because I like a thicker sauce.  Excellent!

It was okay.  For me, it didn't have much of a "crisp" texture to it.

I loved this recipe as did my company.  I had some blueberries on hand, so I added them to half the pan.  I did decrease the sugar however, by 1/2 cup.  The topping is perfect.

came out great, but i wouldn't follow another reviewer's advice to use a food processor to slice the apples again, or at least not if you have  a cheap food processor like mine!  the apples got sliced too thin, and i ended up with textured apple sauce with fantastic crumble topping...still, it is delicious and i will definitely make it again!

This is really superb.  I am diabetic and I used Splenda instead of white sugar and Heart Smart instead of butter.  Worked great and my husband asked when I was going to make it again.  This is truly delicious, and with sugar free, low fat vanilla ice cream, nirvana.

Great recipe. It's very easy. I do agree that you could cut the amount of sugar on the apples and leave out the water. It was really, really good though!

I made using 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I also doubled the topping.  This could probably be made with less sugar.  A little too sweet for me.

Great recipe.  Only used half the amount of sugar and water, as it seemed like a lot, and it was great...not too sweet or watery.  Used granny smith apples, and they worked out well.

Delicious! I mixed the sugar/cinnamon mixture with the apples instead of sprinkling on top. That way all the apples got covered. I also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture, and I omitted the water - not necessary. Per other reviews, I doubled the topping. This came out great!

I had some mixed types of apples that were too bruised to eat, yet too good to compost.  I liked the ingredients in this recipes and thought it would be something my family would enjoy.  I halved the recipe and it came out perfect!  I sprinkled about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and used only 3/4 amount of the water it calls for.  An excellent dessert that I will definitely be making again.

This was excellent.  Both my husband and I loved it. I did reduce the water to 1/8 cup based on other reviews of it being 'runny'.  I have to say, using the 1/8 cup water made the perfect consitancy for my liking. I also used Spartan Apples.

Yummy.  I cut the white sugar in half as most people recommended but I think I would eliminate more sugar next time.  The apples are sweet enough.

Although still an excellent dessert I had problems with the recipie.  I halfed the recipie to an 8 x 8 dish.  I ended up with soup- does the type of apples make a difference?  I used 75% crisp apples and 2 soft ones.  I DID NOT half the topping recipe and still barely had enough to cover the 8 x 8 inch pan.  Not sure, but I think I missed something.  Will definitly still make this recipie again and try less or no water and different apples.  I thought it was too sweet as well, but didn't rate the recipe on this since I think that is a matter of personal taste.

Simply delishish!  My family devoured it.  I made it in an 8x8 pan so I halved the recipe except for the topping.  It was a bit watery but my husband said it didn't hurt it at all.  Next time I may skip the water all the way.  I did  toss the sugar and spices with the apples plus added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Also, I never melt the butter but cut it into the topping cold so it crumbles.

Excellent recipe!  Don't let your friends get a taste of this one.  Mine are constantly requesting it now and I've lost track of the number of batches I've made.  I usually throw a little cinnamon and nutmeg over the apples along with the sugar and put around 1/3 cup water in instead.  I also triple the topping amount, but that's mostly because I eat a large portion of the topping before it ever makes it into the oven!  :)

Overall nice texture, aroma & perfect crumb topping (though I used half the butter).  This was, however, way too sweet/rich for us but it could have been my error.  I even splashed lemon juice over my apples before adding the crumbs. Rhe only additions I made were (suggested by another reviewer): lemon juice, nutmeg & vanilla were added to the apples before sprinking on the first sugar mixture.    Next time I make this I will definitely use a tart apple  & cut the amount of sugar (& butter) by half. I'd like to add chopped pecans as one reviewer suggested, too.  If you prefer really sweet desserts keep the recipe as-is, however if you want to taste the apples enhanced by some sweetened oatmeal-crumb topping, consider decreasing the amounts to your taste.

Fantastic! This was my first time making apple crisp, and it came out fantastic. I read through the reviews before baking and decided to reduce the amount of water to 1/4 c as recommended, and also took someone's recommendation of cutting the butter into the oat/flour mixture instead of melting it. I served it hot with ice cream and everyone loved it! It is important to use granny smith apples, which I found out by asking the produce guy at my local supermarket. One additional thing: baking for 45 min at 350 degrees did not cut it--I had to turn the oven up to 375, cover with foil, and bake for an additional 30 minutes.

Fantastic recipe.  I won't ever look for another.  I'm sure it's delicious as is; however, I increased the topping.  I multiplied it by 1.5 which still gave me plenty of sweet crunchy goodness.**Update** I have now made this three times and can't find a thing wrong to say about it.  I've used different apples every time and found that when using non "baking" apples, I don't need to cook it as long.  My favorite amount of crust is still 1.5 times the original recipe.  When I do this, I cut back on the butter some.

this is AWESOME! i used Braeburn apples and only changed the amount of water i used. i think it ended up being about 1/4 of a cup instead of 1/2. also only baked it for 40 minutes. goes perfect with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. DELICIOUS!

Very good recipe, but I had to make changes. I did a mixture of Granny Smith & Pink Lady apples (which I tossed with 1/8-1/4 cup of OJ) and instead of the full cup of white sugar I did a mix of white & brown sugar. Also added some nutmeg to the cinnamon. Also, instead of 1/2 cup of water I did water & apple juice. Doubled the topping recipe and enjoy with some vanilla ice cream- perfect fall dessert!

This was absolutely delicious!!!! I eliminated the water, because I like a thicker consistency in my apple crisp. I also did as another reviewer suggested, and tossed the apples in the flour/sugar mixture, and then layered them in the pan. It was perfect! It would make a great deep dish apple pie as well!!

Maybe after some tweaking this might be ok.  I used half the water suggested by other reviews...wish I wouldn't have used any at all.  It was very runny and the apples still weren't done after cooking it an extra 20 min.

Would give it 5 stars except it was too sweet for our liking. Even my 19yr old daughter thought so. I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 in both the filling and topping. Maybe even 1/2 a cup in the filling depending on the type of apple used. I did use the water and it worked out just fine.

Good recipe.  I followed other reviewer's advice, and tossed the apples with the cinnamon sugar, and didn't add any water.  While it was baking the moisture came out of the apples and made its own liquid.  I doubled the crust because I LOVE the crisp part, and it worked great. I also didn't melt the butter, but cut it in to the mixture so it'd be more like a crisp and not just a crust.  DEFINITELY use Granny Smith apples, the tartness is perfect! With the couple changes I made, this was a wonderful dessert!

Very good recipe!  I was looking for a recipe with a crunchy topping.  When I pulled it out of the oven, I thought the topping wouldn't be very crunchy, but it was perfect.  A little on the sweet side, but with ice cream it was great!  I made it just as the recipe was written except I folded the butter in.

I thought this was the best apple crisp ever.  I used 12 cups of apples and doubled the topping.  Added just a bit more sugar, flour and cinnamon on the apples.  Didn't have any problem with the water. If you let the crisp set up a bit the sauce will thicken.  Yummy!!

Overall, a good recipe. I will definitely cut the water in half next time. It was too runny. And I will toss the apples with the sugar mixture before baking. Some apples were a little sweet and others were too tart because they weren't covered evenly by sprinkling. I saw other people doubled the crust. That would be good, but I'm not sure it's necessary.

I love this recipe.  I have been looking for an apple crisp recipe for a long time.  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used less sugar and water.  It turned out great.  The topping was nice and crunchy.  I also used half whole wheat and white flour.

This is sooooo good.  I did as some other reviewers recommended and doubled the oat mixture, and I would not recommend doing that.  It just made it dryer than I was expecting (even then it was really good though).  I served it over homemade cinnamon ice cream, which remedied the dryness.  Would also be really good with vanilla ice cream.

The topping was spot on!  We thought the apples were a bit sweet, and will use less suger next time we make it. Other than that, it would have easily been a five star classic.  Great Dish!

Oh wow is this good!!!  I used the red and delicious apples off the tree in our yard and it turned out great!  My boyfriend is used to home town cooking and I don't usually cook things from scratch.  i followed the directions, it was super easy, and I was told it was better than any apple crisp he's ever had.  now THAT is achievement!

This was the best recipe I've ever tasted!  I used 1/4 cup of apple juice in place of the water, and I put the water in the pan first. Also, next time I think I will use less sugar because even with the granny smith apples, it was super sweet! I also doubled the topping recipe and added a pinch of nutmeg to both the apples and the topping.   I also added some cooking time because 45 min. wasn't long enough for my oven.  I served it with Vanilla ice cream and Caramel topping. It was a hit!

If you are looking for a classic apple crisp, you've found it! The apples will be tender with a lovely rich sauce. While the surface is crispy and full of flavor. Together they make a marvelous mixture. A Delight to the senses!

This is a very good recipe.  I did chop the apples smaller the 2nd time.  The sliced apples seemed to be a little more crunchy than what we like.

I followed other suggestions.  Decreased water by half and I thought it was perfect. I doubled the crust/streusel and actually thought it was too much.  I'd rather have more apples in my apple crisp.

I tossed the apples in the sugar and cinnamon mix, along with a bit of fresh nutmeg. Then I added them to the 9x13 pan that I'd already added the 1/2 cup water to. After all, why bother rinsing the seasoning off by pouring the water over top? Turned out fantastic, and I know I'll be making it again soon.

I thought this tasted pretty good.  I halved the white sugar because I'm trying to cut back.  The topping was a little drier than I'm used to but all in all it tasted good.  Next time I'll omit the baking powder and baking soda because I didn't like the fact that the topping rose during cooking.

OMG!!  I think this is the best Apple Crisp I've ever had.  I did squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over the apples and tossed before putting into pan and I added just a few shakes of cinnamon into the crisp part!  Yum.  I would suggest slicing the apples a little more on the thicker side, I sliced them thin and they were a little mushy, so go thick!

I made this for a church function and everyone loved it. I did cut back on the sugar and water over the apples because I had relatively sweet apples. Very good basic apple crisp will continue to make. Also a good recipe to use if you have an abundance of apples.

This is probably the one recipe that I make the most on this site. I just love it. As others, I did double the topping and cut the water in half and it was perfecto. Now it's peach season and I'm making this same recipe using, yes peaches. Very yummy!

i've been searching for the apple crisp that i remember my mom making, and finally i found it! i did make a few modifications, i halved the amount of apples, sugar, flour & cinnamon and added allspice.  i tossed the apples in this mixture and then put them in an 8x8 pan.  i sprinkled with lime juice (out of lemon) and omitted the water.  i made the crust per the directions and it came out amazing.  i brought this to a party and it was gone in 2 minutes!  i am definitely keeping this one, and getting rid of the other apple crisp recipes i saved.  sooooo good!

Very good...but was skeptical about the water...I always add lemon juice to my fruit pies...so i did that and only added some drizzles of apple juice. Did not have enough apples, so i used 2 containers of red raspberries.  Would double the amount of crust....we love it!

This was good, but not the best apple crumble/crisp I've had.  I think I'll stick to the other recipes.  Next time I will replace some of the white sugar with brown, add a bit more cinnamon and sprinkle some nuts.

Winner, winner...this is what my family wants after dinner!!!  I followed the directions and this was superb!  The only "extra" I added was some raisins, because that's what my mister wanted!  It was SOOOOO good!  This may very well turn into my "go to" dessert.

My family thought this was absolutely wonderful. I halved the filling part of the since there are just 3 at my house but kept the full amount of topping as others suggested and baked in an 8x8 pan. I used gala apples. Galas, fuji and granny smith are my favorites to cook with.

I used four different varieties of apples. In the end, there was a little more 'juice' at the bottom than I would have liked. So next time, I will add less water. Even with the juice, it was delicious.

this was really good and simple to make. the great thing about it is that all the ingredients are things you would usually always have at home so you can throw it together for a quick dessert. next time i will be sure to serve it with either vanilla ice cream or whip cream on top. its still good without it, but im sure it will taste fantastic with that addition. i will also try adding some nutmeg next time. i didnt use a full 10 cups of apples, as i only had 7 apples at home

Delicious!!! Everyone loved it.  Though for my family & friends, we found that 1 c. sugar total (so 1/2 c. white & 1/2 c. brown sugar) was just the right amount.  When I made the recipe the first time, I followed the recipe exactly & it was way too sweet.

This is the first time I've made a crisp and I was very happy with the result.  After reading several reviews suggesting doubling the topping, I adjusted accordingly.  I used Braeburn apples and regular oats (not quick-cooking) and it turned out great.  There was a little runny liquid at the bottom, but I think it will just depend on the type of apples... some are just more juicy.  Delicious recipe, thanks!

I loved this one, although I did make a few changes.  With the filling I used only 1/2 the sugar and I doubled the cinamon (I love cin).  I omitted the water and instead put this into two pie shells.  I then used the topping as my top crust.  Came out delicious and I will definately make again.

halved the apple mixture, kept the water in, will continue to look for another recipe.  The crisp topping seemed too sweet.  I couldn't even eat one helping.  I have liked crisps in the past; this one wasn't what I was looking for.

So I monkeyed with the ingredient amounts a bit to suit the preferences of my family, but the basic "bones" of this recips are perfect the way they are. I double the topping and put everything in a big 9x13 casserole dish. Try this... play with the amounts. You will love it too!

this is the best apple crisp ever! i make it all the time and everyone loves it. I have made some small changes. instead of 1/2 cup water i put 1/2 cup lemon juice (real lemons when i can) it doesnt make the apple crisp sour, it makes the apple a little less sweet. The other thing is that this recipe has alot of sugar. So if u have kids and u want to minimize the sugar buzz, this recipes still tastes great if u half both the white sugar and brown sugar! Enjoy!

Excellent recipe. I used apples I picked from our Goodland Apple tree in fall and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg as some previous commebnts had mentioned. I also reduced the water to 1/3 c due to the apples being quite juicy.  Tasted great. My wife said it was the best apple crisp she has tasted. Definitely will be making it again next fall.

This turned out fantastic with a few adjustments. I used 1/2 the sugar suggested, used maple and brown sugar instant oat packages (2) single serve packages, added a little all spice, doubled the cinnamon and used 1/2 the water. By the way, the 2nd time I made this I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda and you could not tell the difference. Great recipe.

This was very good. I added a dash of nutmeg. I also cut in the butter with a pastry blender, instead of pouring melted on top.  I then pressed it evenly across the top to make a pretty presentation.  Great filling to crisp ratio.

This is not a good recipe! The measurements are wrong,  I wasted 8 apples making this overly sweet syrupy mess.  There should be no water, the apples have thier own moisture.  Have you ever put water in an apple pie?   And the topping is only not nearly enough.

I doubled the oat mixture and put half above and below the apples. Next time I will halve the water and also cut down the white/brown sugar by 1/4

I followed the recipe as is and it is fantastic. Next time I will have to cut my apples a bit chunkier because they turned out a little too soft. If you like your apples with some texture make sure not to slice them too small. Use granny smith apples because the sour apple goes great with all the sugar and spice.

SO good! DOUBLE THE CRUMBS--otherwise there are not enough. I prefer to use Granny Smith because I like it more tart and I also add a bit less sugar to the apples.

This turned out perfectly the first time. We'll be making this over and over. Just make sure to use the right kind of apples, so they don't turn mushy! (Although it would still taste good.)

I can only give this recipe 4 stars as written, but with my slight changes it's easily a 5 star recipe. I added a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples, instead of water, I used 1-2 TBSP. of vanilla. I doubled the topping adding more cinnamon, nutmeg, and chopped pecans. Baked as directed. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!

Used granny smiths and did the double batch of crust... too much.  

2nd time tried 1.5x crust... still too much.  I think it's better to just do it as listed.  I did mix the apples and the filling in the pan, as well.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was sooo good.  Took the advice of others and double the topping and am so glad I did.  I only used half of the amount of water poured over the apples and it was perfect.  I think I used fiji apples, not the granny smith ones, but I just sliced them a bit thicker and it was fine.  Also added some nutmeg along with the cin.

Yum, so good!  I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan.  I cut back on the sugar a little bit because my apples were sweet already.  I thought the amount of water might be too much, it seemed very liquidy, but the water absorped while the crisp cooled.  Thanks so much, I will definitely make this again!

This apple crisp is awesome.  Only change I made is that I added some caramel topping prior to adding the crumble topping.  It was a little watery, so I will probably use 1/2 the water next time.  Still...its amazing!

This apple crisp recipe is great! My husband loves it and ate half the pan within the first two days! He was fine with it until he realized how much butter was in it. Apples do matter, as others have said. Use a crispy apple, such as a Granny Smith or Jonathan. I used Macintosh because we had a whole bag to get rid of and the apples turned to mush in some places, but it still tasted good! I also doubled the topping recipe, which did not really need to be done. Making a 1.5 serving size would have been just fine. We think the topping is the best part, so the more the better! Overall, a great recipe. Very flavorful, not too sweet, and definitely a guilty pleasure! I will definitely make this again! Delicious!

I found this to be much too sweet.  I will use tarter apples and cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup (or use a mix of apples as I did this time and just omit the white sugar.)  The topping is sweet enough without adding more sugar to the apples.  I also added just a sprinkle of nutmeg to the apples.

The apple crisp topping is perfect and I didn't change a thing there.  I did alter the apple filling by using half the sugar listed and instead of the water, I used 1/2 tsp of lemon juice.  Also, instead of one big 9x13 pan, I used individual 3oz ramekins.  About 1 1/2 sliced apples fit per ramekin and the topping amount made can be used for about 4-6 ramekins depending on how  thickn you prefer your crisp topping.

This is a delicious recipe as is, but I tweaked it a bit and was very pleased with the results--as are all the people who've tried it.  I used 6 Granny Smith apples, doubled the amount of cinnamon and added a scant teaspoon of ground cloves, then tossed the apples with the sugar-spice mixture.  I divided the apples between 2 smaller baking dishes, used 1/4 cup water in each--which I found was a perfect amount once the dishes had cooled to room temp.  I doubled the recipe for the crumble and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix.  I'd planned to cut in the butter, but in my rush to soften the butter, I had half melted and half softened, so I cut in the softened chunks.  Very nice results!

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for the old-fashioned crisp like mom makes and this is it!  I've made it twice now; the first time exactly as the recipe's writtten, and the second time I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats, (btw, both times I used regular oats-quick cooking wasn't necessary).  Anyway, I got absolutely rave reviews from my co-workers both times.  I plan on making this for Thanksgiving. 
 I've since made this several times.  I've used quick cooking as well as regular oats.  I like the texture of the crumble with the regular oats much better.  Also, I've found that adding the melted butter a little at a time, and stirring intermittedly helps the butter to more evenly dispense. I can't tell you the raves I get over this.

The best apple crisp EVER.  I mixed the cinnamon mixture up with the apples, rather than sprinkle on.  And I didn't add the water.  I let it sit for awhile before baking, so there was plenty of water in there already.  Again, best crisp EVER.

Delicious and easy to make, however you definitely need to omit the water, or at least cut it in half.  I followed the directions exactly and the apples were swimming in water when I took it out of the oven.  I would cut the white sugar in half as well.

Yummy! I have made this about 6 times in the last month in a variety of sizes. I always use much more oatmeal than flour, usually double. I have used whole wheat flour which was probably the best. I love the crumble so the more the better! Thank you for this quick, simple, yummy, no fuss recipe! I usually end up using 5 fugi, 5 granny smith apples. If you decide to make more crumble, you need the brown sugar and butter to help. I made it once (on accident) with out the water and I definitely noticed. It needs that little bit of water.

YUMMY!  I just made this for the second time in two weeks.  It's really great.  And YES - use Granny Smith's and not a sweet apple.  (Although I threw in a couple of Honey Crisp because I had them on hand.)  I eased up on the sugar just a bit because it can be very sweet - but oh wow - it is so, so good.  Not alot of work for an excellent ending.  YUM!

Very good recipe and easy to put together. I halved it for just my husband and I and put it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out great. And I'm already making the full size recipe this weekend for a party. Next time I'm going to double the crisp topping and add  a pinch of nutmeg and salt into the mix. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made lots of changes but it was great! I used Macintosh apples. In the apple mixture I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup, I used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch instead of flour. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. For the topping, I doubled it and added 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans. I ground the oatmeal in a food processor (because my husband doesn't like the texture), added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I baked it for 55 minutes and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to additionally crisp the top. It's wonderful!! Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Oh my word!!! This Apple Crisp was amazing! I couldn't stop eating it! Sooo tasty. I used about 2 cups more apples then called for only because I had them on hand and needed to use them up. But it worked out great. And I also would reduce the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup or even a little bit less. I'm not a fan of overly sweet things, so I cut the sugar down on most recipes. But this is definitely a keeper!

This was THE BEST apple crisp I've ever had. It was actually cripsy. I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers. It was good, but I guess it depends on how much you want to taste the fruit. I may add another apple or two next time to achieve the fruit/topping balance that's right for me. Next time I'd like to try adding pecans to the topping (left them out because the group I was feeding has nut allergies). I also used regular oats not quick cooking because that's what I always have in my pantry. Maybe that's why it was extra crunchy, but that's how I wanted it to be. And I cut in the butter rather than melting it just because that's how I always make a crumb topping. As far as the apples go... I think adding water depends on the type of apples you use. I used Winesap which are very sturdy apples, good for cooking, but in my past experience with them they don't cook down quickly or get very juicy upon cooking. So I added the full 1/2 cup of water & it was perfect. Another apple may cook down more, make lots of it's own juice, and not need the additional water. This recipe going in my recipe book!

You probably don't need one more review, but I wanted to add that I made this for some vegan friends, using vegan margarine, and it was still WONDERFUL. My preference is to use butter, but it does make a good vegan dessert.

So good. I didn't think it needed quite DOUBLE the topping...but if you're not afraid of lots of extra sugar & butter...go for it. I also added chopped walnuts and nutmeg to the recipe - VERY GOOD!! Next time I think I'll try to make it a little healthier, a little leess sugar & butter and see how it turns out.

The BEST!!!! My very picky fiance raves about this recipe! I was SO UPSET when I lost my print-out of this recipe - I cannot find another one that tops this! Like some of the other reviewers I double the topping, use about 3/4 of the amount of sugar the recipe calles for, and I do not add any water - I usually use macintosh and cortland apples and they produce plenty of juice!

Absolutely teh best Apple Crisp I have ever made!!!  Teh recipe was quick and easy. Like others, I omitted the water complete.  I also used macs and courtlands instead of Granny Smiths so I used only half the sugar. I made half again on the crisp, but the regular amount probably would have been plenty as I do not put it on the bottom.  Great recipe! Will definately make it again!!!

I used five apples, skipped the water, added 1/4t. nutmeg, and made the topping for 12 servings (full recipe).  This turned out great!  My husband usually doesn't like apple desserts, but he loved this one!

Excellent receipt.  Loved by all. Will definitely make again.  Receipt easy to follow, made a couple adjustments as follows: 1/4 cup of water, soaked the cut and peeled apples in lemon water. Also, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and I added some 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to that mixture.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I love it so much that I will be making it again for Thanksgiving. This is a great recipe for a non-cook- it's easy and fast. The hardest part is peeling and coring the apples.  I did not have an issue with the water at all, if anything I think I might have added MORE water, not less.  My local paper published an apple crisp recipe from a famous restaurant (so famous that I can't think of the name of it!) that was much, much more complicated than this one, and I got mediocre results from it. If you make one Apple Crisp recipe MAKE THIS ONE!

Shame on me for only making a half recipe! I could have eaten an entire 13x9 of this! I always pay attention to the reviews so, like many others, I cut back on the water, added a dash of nutmeg to the apples, and (what the heck) doubled the topping. I've always thought of crisps and cobblers as humble weeknight desserts...but I'd be proud to serve this one to company. I'm sure it would do just as beautifully with other fruits, too. This is THE recipe for apple crisp!

Excellent recipe! This was the first time I've made apple crisp and I love it. I don't know if I'll be able to eat anyone else's. I did add just 1/2 cup more of the cooking oats to the mixture for the top (the crunchy top is my favorite).

This was a hit at a party. I did not add the water to the apples, but my apples had been sliced and frozen for 2 pies and were already plenty wet.  I also did not melt the butter, but cut it into the topping mixture.  I like a more crumbly topping.  Once finished, I felt the topping needed a pinch of salt as well so I will add that the next time.

This recipe is amazing-although I tweaked it a bit. I used 5 large granny smith apples and coated them with the sugar mix instead of layering. (10 cups seemed like a LOT) I used apple cider instead of water for extra flavor. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! Serve it with vanilla ice cream and caramel topping for an extra kick. (and calories :) But well worth it!

Very good & super easy to make!  Next time I may reduce the amount of water, it was a little runny.  I used Granny Smith Apples and they added just the right tartness to balance out the sweet of the topping.

Amazing!  This was the best apple crisp I have ever had!    I made half of the recipe and I am glad I did b/c I can't stop going back for more.  I could probably eat the entire pan!  Used Jonathan apples from the orchard and made as directed.  It was a little watery right out of the oven, but thickened up.  This is a keeper!

Absolutely the BEST apple crisp I've ever made or eaten! I made the recipe exactly as written, but added a little cinnamon to the topping portion. I used gala apples and it turned out GREAT! I will be making this simple and delicious dessert often! Thanks for posting. :)

OHHHHH GOODNESS!!!! I ate this for dinner. I picked apples fromy my tree, then baked this.. as I baked this I made dinner-- I didn't eat anything BUT THIS for dinner! YUM!!! It's definitely the best! not too overpowering with the cinnamon, either! =-) I also doubled the topping, and added nutmeg! I DID use the water.. but it was PERFECT! I think it would have been too dry if I hadn't added the water. I didn't have vanilla icecream on hand, so we will have it with that tomorrow =-) My son is on his 2nd bowl, and I- well, just ate it out of the pan =-)

This was WONDERFUL! Made a few small changes. I only used 1/4c water and added 1/4 tsp of Pumpkin pie spice & 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Will make again and again!

Really good! I used a mix of Red Delicious, Granny Smith, and Gala apples (3, 3, and 1, for a total of 7 apples to make around 10 cups). I used half white and half whole wheat flour; and I cut the sugar in the recipe in half (altogether, halved it for each layer). The butter I used was a 50/50 blend of real butter/olive oil Heart Smart spread...unusual for me as I generally only use real butter in cooking, but this worked out fine (melts much faster in the microwave than real butter!). The end result is for sure the best of about 4 "crisp" recipes I've tried on here thus far! Juicy, tender, sweet, delicious, the crust is probably my favorite part--it holds together well, probably from having a higher ratio of flour:oats than other recipes have called for. I don't know if I will quit trying other recipes now, but this will certainly be my go-to recipe :) Thanks so much, it's worth every star!

Yum, Yum, Yum!!  I made this with some Braeburn apples I had that didn't taste really great fresh, but they made an awesome crisp!  I also added a bag of frozen blueberries and made a recipe and a half of the crisp.  I seriously could not keep my husband and son away from it!

I never liked apple crisp much, but my husband wanted some--tried this recipe and I love it! Don't use the water, but add a little more sugar to the apples.

I put it in an 8x8 pan instead.I used half for top and half for bottom crust. I cut up my apples and put them in a bowl with the sugar and some lemon juice. I let it sit for 10-15 minutes and the apples make their own juice. I did that instead of adding the water. I used Honey Crisp apples so I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and a 1/4 cup brown. Definitely a repeat.

Awesome!  Loved the crumbly top, and it stayed that way.  I did double the topping though per other reviews and forgot to add the water to the apples, but I don't think I would change that in the future.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really good.  Just as good as the boxed kind I use when I'm being lazy.  It has a good crunch.  The topping needed a dash of spice though, so I added a dash of clove, a dash of salt and a healthy sprinkling of cinnamon.  I thought a cup of sugar on the apples was too much, but I was wrong.  I also didn't add all the water, I just added a little.  I can see where it would be needed as mine was kinda dry since I added the flour.  Thanks for the recipe Diane, now I don't have to spend my money on the boxed mix.

Great recipe for an apple crisp with a little hearty feel.  The topping is so delicious!  I made this for a friends wedding rehearsal dinner and both pans were gone in a snap.  Served hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream is the perfect combo.  No changes made to the recipe.

Do NOT double the topping - the recipe makes plenty. I did not add water, as my apples had plenty of juice after slicing. Very yummy!

This was a good apple crisp.  I listened to a few of the reviews that said to double the topping and I shouldn't have.  It was way to sweet with double topping.  Next time I would leave it alone and make it as stated in the original recipe...I did not add any water though and it came out fine, not dry at all.

I had 3-4 cups of huckleberries that I wanted to add to an apple cobbler.  (Had heard that this was a good combination). This recipe looked like it might work for that.  It turned out to be very good!  Used about 8 cups of apples, cooked them separately with the flour and sugar in the oven about 30 minutes at 350 first, (Used no water) then sprinkled the huckleberries on top, then the topping and baked about 35 minutes longer.  It turned out great.  Next time huckleberry cobbler is the goal, probably would use more huckleberries and fewer apples, though, as the apple flavor dominated.  I made 1 1/2 x the topping recipe, as some had suggested increasing it, but ended up not using the extra 1/2, as it was too much.  A very good recipe.

Tasty crisp, but I was hoping for more of a "crisp" texture for the topping.  Overall, nice taste, everyone seemed to like it.

Very Tasty! I took the advice of others, doubled the topping and made a crust below with it. Love that idea (and the added texture). I forgot to put in the water (oops) and it came out a bit dry (due to the added crust I'm sure -- my bad). Also added the nutmeg as others had recommended. Very tasty and loved by all at our house. Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't read enough reviews - and when I went back, they were right.   Leave out the water.  Mine came out very runny.   I also find it very,   It was also way to sweet for me.  I don't think I have ever said that before!  Seriously though - I would cut the sugar in the first part by at least half.   My husband and kids gobbled it up though....

This turned out really good.  I tried to double the crisp part of it, which I doubled the water that went into it, too, and I shouldn't have done that.  It had a wonderful flavor, though and we loved it!

i just made this last night and it's already gone! i didn't alter the recipe at all and i think it was perfect.  you have to remember that this is basically like an apple pie, it will come out a bit "soupy" right out of the oven but after sitting it will be perfect!   also, i used granny smith apples.

I brought this to a meeting and everyone really enjoyed it.  I reduced the water by half and doubled the topping.  I used granny smith apples (about eight of them) since many past reviewers recommended that variety and I was happy with the results...plus, the granny smith apples were the cheapest!

Even I was able to make a successful crisp, and my family and I love it.  I also doubled the topping (used another 1/4cup applesauce instead of butter) and cut the white sugar in half (still a little sweet for me).  I think I'll try more cinammon next time.  Delicious either way.

Yummy! I have use both sweet and tangy apples in this recipe and I love it both ways. I found the topping was plenty unlike some other reviews, but I guess everyone is different in their tastes. Excellent recipe!

Made this recipe twice and was pleased with the results.  The first time came out too watery and not as flavorful as I like.  The second time I used half the water and added a pinch of salt and some crushed pecans to the topping and it came out better.

Great tasting crisp!  After reading the reviews, I modified it just a little bit.  I tossed my apples with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon, but I also added a dash of nutmeg.  I did not use any water, and it was perfect.  I also used  a stick of smart balance 50/50 blend and cut it into the topping mixture.

YUMMY!!! Thats all I can say! I've never made homemade apple crisp, normally I buy premade crumb topping & just cut up the apples & add the topping. I had some leftover apples & decided to try this. I took another reviewiers advice & only added 1/4 cup of water, rather than the 1/2 cup. It seemed like too much water & I don't like a soggy apple crisp, but didn't completley omit the water as some reviewers did because I do like a little bit of a thick sauce. It was delicious...very yummy!! Thanks for the great recipe!! This was soo good & soo easy I will never buy boxed topping again!!!

This is really great and I have to say that by mistake I probably made it even better! LOL I didn't have any quick cook oats so I used two individual serving size maple and brown sugar packets which exactly equalled one cup! The topping with this addition was out of this world! I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup to compensate for this addition since I was afraid of it being way too sweet, but it was delicious! Thanks for this perfect recipe :) FYI: I also mixed the white sugar, flour and cinnamon together then tossed the apples in this mixture to ensure even coating instead of sprinkling it over the top.

The perfect apple crisp.  This recipe is easy to make, no fuss, and turns out delicious every time.  I have made it for guests many times, and always get compliments.  As others have suggested, I omit, completely, the water, and add 1/4 t fresh ground nutmeg.

Not to bad, but I did  not follow the other reviewers advice. Definitely cut water, mine has a lot of water in the bottom of the pan. I used jonathon and granny smith, they rendered a lot of juices and the water was just overkill. I would also cut sugar if you like the apple taste of apple crisp. It is VERY sweet. Third, I added a lot more cinnamon and it turned out to be a good idea but if i cut the sugar i prbably would not need more. Will definitely try again with the tweeks.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because i'm sure if it is made as written it would be worth 5 stars. That being said, let me tell you what i did different from the recipe, so you'll know what NOT to do. Do not cut the butter into the dry ingredients. It will be very dry if not melted. Do not double the crisp and put some on the bottom. It is just not apple crisp that way, and do not leave out the water completely. It's in the recipe for a reason. It needs some extra moisture. I will make again and will make as written and i'm sure it will be great.

I thought this was a little too sweet. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar but it was still too sweet. I would do 1/2 a cup of sugar and double the cinnamon. That being said, everyone else loved it. I am always particularly hard on my own cooking I guess!

Very good, but I made a few changes the 2nd time I baked it.  Mix all ingredients as directed FIRST and cover them.  Then, core, peel and slice the apples to prevent them from turning brown.  Definately double the oat mixture as many other reviewers recommend.  Finally, bake in a metal pan and cover...this ensures a more even bake.  The first time I ended up with apple sauce on the edges and raw apples in the center.  This recipe is a 5 star with these adjustments!

Absolutely wonderful! I omitted the water and drizzled 2 T. of caramel ice cream topping over the apples before adding the crumb topping.  Baked as directed and served with vanilla ice cream.  Yum!

Very good! I listened to the reviews and used 1/4 a cup of water instead of 1/2 a cup and I used about 1/2 a cup of sugar instad of 1 cup....I also doubled the crisp on top so it would be extra crispy...it worked!The top was very crispy and the bottom was very moist...I loved it!!! I will definently use this recipe again.

Great, simple recipe....the way an apple crisp should be!  I actually made this for my freezer.  I prepared the filling (with a little bit of added lemon juice) and put it into ziploc bags...froze them flat.  Then when I need a quick, easy dessert I just thaw, pour into my casserole dish, prepare and add the topping!  Voila!  (hint...I also do this with my apple pie fillings too...freezing this way saves space instead of having to freeze whole pies)

This recipe is really really good even if you've never baked before. Just follow the instructions. I reduced teh water to 1/4 cup. Since my kids cant stand the smell of cinnamon, instead of sprinkling cinnamon powder , i actually just chuck in one whole cinnamon stick with the apples just to very lightly scent the apples. I used red delicious apples.Yumm, as of today this is my husband's favourite dessert!  DELICIOUS.

This apple crisp is awesome. The first time I made it, it was a hit. I have had constant requests for it ever since. My housemates have actually banned me from making sweets because they eat everything up in one sitting. Hey its not my fault, I blame all recipes lol :) Thanks for the recipe!

Without alterating the recipe, I give this recipe 4 stars. It is a great base recipe but there were two problems: 1) too sweet and 2) too watery.

I bet this will be a five star recipe if you take into consideration the recommendations of the other reviewers. Cut the sugar to your liking and add no water. 

I will make this again with a few small changes.

This recipe was really good! I used a touch a lemon juice to prevent browning of the apples. I added about 1/4 cup of the water after reading the reviews of some who had problems. My filling was the perfect consistency after baking. I doubled the cinnamon in the filling and added nutmeg as well. I used a double recipe for the topping (we like alot of 'crisp') and added cinnamon to topping mixture as we are big cinnamon lovers. The recipe was a huge hit at my party. Thank you for sharing it!

This is excellent!! I followed the recipe, except I used wheat flour, more brown sugar instead of white, tossed in some pinhead (whole) oatmeal, and a packet of instant spiced apple cider to add flavor.
 
This made my whole house smell delicious! The first piece was soooo good! I wanted a second serving, but it didn't happen.. I got full right away what with all the oatmeal! Very hearty 'healthy' dessert!

 Next time I'll cut the apples thicker (as they were a little to soft for my liking), toss some chopped pecans in the crust, and try the nutmeg like alot of people recommend. I'll be making this often! A+++++

This crisp is awesome.  We did use the water suggested and it was ok - but, we had added more apples.  We doubled the topping as suggested and it was yummy - it takes like caramel.  My younger daughter says "it's awesome".  We will definitely make this again.

My first Apple Crisp recipe ever!  Made this for Thanksgiving for 16 people- everyone loved it- not a drop left!  I followed the recipe exactly too!  I would not change anything except maybe 1/2 the water.  I used some Swedish apples like Gala and maybe will try granny smith next time for a tart contrast ot the sweetness!  Overall fabulous and will do the exact same recipe again!

This was delicious! I doubled the topping the first time, but that was too much. The second time I used the topping plus doubled it just by half. Perfect. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and used brown sugar for 1/2c and white for 1/4...I prob will just use 1/2 next time. The only other change I made was to add 1/4tsp nutmet. Perfecto!

Really good and easy recipe and yes, it's a bit sweet for my tasting and I didn't even use the full amount of sugar and only used brown sugar (though I guess that's probably just as sweet or sweeter!). Still good though. Added more spices too. and upped the amount of apples.

This was a fantastic recipe!  Normally I make new recipes as written the first time, but I didn't allow myself time for  a test run before Thanksgiving, so I had to use my judgement and I have to say it came out great!  I tripled the crust part because we like a nice cookie-like double crust.  I also used only 2 tlbs of water and I mixed the apples in flour/brown sugar and stirred i the water before dumping it all on the bottom crust.  I cut the sugar back quite a bit because I didn't have enough left after the other desserts I made and it didn't make difference, it was plenty sweet.  I omitted the cinnamon because I'm allergic and this time around I didn't replace it with any spices.  The wonderful taste of the granny smith apples came through, it was great!  The water debate has a simple answer, imo, it all comes down to what you want out of your apple crisp.  If you like it on the drier side, the juice of the apples will provide enough moisture to keep it from being gross.  If you lke a nice sauce, add the full amount of water.  I'm going to make this again next week and try it with more water just to see how it goes.  The bottom line with this recipe is that it's flexible; you can adapt it to your own tastes and it will yield a wonderful harvest treat.  Happy Thanksgiving!

FINALLY!! This is the one! The best apple crisp I have ever had... and I can make it! I used Granny Smith apples & followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp ground cloves to the apples. Makes me miss my grandma!!!

Wow!! This was wonderful!! I followed another reviewer's advice and only used 1/4 c. water, and it turned out perfectly.  Other that that, the only change I made was to add chopped pecans to the crumb mixture.  Fantastic!!

This is the type of apple crisp you dream of!!! The topping is thick and crunchy it gives substance to the dessert.I'm sure both whip cream and vanilla ice cream are great on this .. i served it with Fat free Vanilla froz.yogurt And it was terrific! only had 7Cps worth of apples but it was still GREAT! and  by the way the flavor is even better the next day, try it!

Tasted great.  My apples were a little on the soft/watery side before cooking - I should have omitted the water in the recipe or added more flour. Despite that, it turned out really good.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it for my boyfriend who MMmm'd all the way through eating it and commented that it was just like his mom's.

My changes:

I mixed the flour, water, cinnamon,etc. together first, then into the bowl of cut apples which I then transferred to the pan. 

I added a little nutmeg to this as well.

I do agree with another post about the quantity of sugar.  This was very sweet and next time I will reduce the sugar.  I also added a little more butter to the topping mixture as I like it mine with a bit more crunch.

however, without my personal modifications, this recipe still would have been great!  it's now a keeper!

This was a very yummy apple crisp.  It was a big hit with my husband and two boys.  We had it tonight with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Based on other reviews I decided to use less water - probably around 1/4 cup, and I could have used even less.  It thickened more the longer I let it sit, but it was still pretty thin for my tastes.  Also, it was extremely sweet (and I even used all Granny Smith apples, which are very tart), so next time I will probably cut back some on the sugar.  That's really a matter of preference, though - some people like it sweeter than others!  Plus, I thought the apple to topping ratio was good as is.  Any more topping would have definitely been overkill in my opinion.  

All in all, this was excellent, and I'll definitely be making this again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I cut this by two thirds to make a good amount for my husband and I. I was out of baking powder, so I obviously didn't add it. If it made a difference, I didn't notice! I will definitely make this again-next time when we have company so I can show off!

This was a hit, and I have received request to make it again.  The only thing I would change is adding water if your apples tend to be juicier you don't need to add as much or any water at all.

Overall, this recipe was decent. I made it with whole wheat flour and added walnuts. The walnuts added SO much flavor. Overall, I thought the apples were pretty bland, and cooking the dish for 45 minutes made them a little mushy for my taste.

Amazing recipe.  My family loved it with vanilla ice cream.  I used a mixture of Jonathan and Granny Smith apples, and the combo was perfect.  I ignored the advice of other reviewers to leave out the liquid (I used apple juice), and I regret that, as it turned out a tad more watery than I like.  It really needs no water or other liquid.  Other than that, perfect recipe.

Phenomenal!  I tried someone's idea and made a crust and topping with the topping recipe.  I also tried something and didn't use fresh apples, I used cut and seasoned canned apples.  The crisp is DELICIOUS, never gonna lose this recipe!

This has been the best apple crisp recipe I have tried yet.  I actually use orange juice instead of water, I seen it in an old apple crisp recipe I used before, it's really good.  I also add raisins.  I use Cortland apples those seem to work very well.   Other than the OJ I would change a thing.  The water when I used it just kinda sat there on the bottom of the pan.

Oh Mama, this is some excellent, extremely addictive stuff.  I've made it twice in the past week.  I used Granny Smith apples which are very tart and dry, so I used the whole 1/2 cp of liquid, but I used spiced rum instead.  WOW!  I also added more cinnammon and some pumpkin pie seasoning to the apples.  I made my sugar mixture, then tossed the apples so they were coated perfectly, then topped with the rum.  I doubled the top crumbly stuff and just lightly crumbled on top.  It was absoutely pefect.  Also served with butter pecan ice cream which was awesome.  Don't make this unless you want to be addicted to it.  :)

WOWEE!!! This is DELICIOUS!!! Used 6 MacIntosh apples tossed in 1 T lemon juice; decreased water to 1/4 c; stirred together apples and sugar mixture, doubled crust ingredients using 1/2 butter, 1/2 margarine (unmelted, cut into flour mixture).  My son and I have already eaten 1/2 the pan and it's only been out of the oven a few minutes! Yummy!!!!`

Am total culinary hero after making this dish!  I cut the water in half as well and it turned out really well.  My grandmother - best baker I know - told me it was the best Apple Crisp she had ever had.
Oh - definitely add the nutmeg.

This is a very nice apple crisp.  A classic.  Have made it 2X in the past couple of weeks.  The first time I followed it to a T, the second time a added a bit of lemon juice.  Next time, I will add the lemon juice but less than what I originally added.  The lemon juice is a "sometimey" addition, as it depends on the type of apples used.  If using sour type of apples, such as granny-smith, lemon juice won't be necessary, otherwise I like "just a hint" of zip.  Loved it and so did everyone else in my house.

This was SO good.  Great flavor and the apple to topping ratio was perfect, I don't think the topping should overwhelm the apples.  However I did make the following adjustments:  I used only 1/3 cup of the white sugar and replaced the water with 1/2 cup of apple cider (cider added more flavor but also adds sugar so 1 cup sugar would have been WAY too sweet), upped the flour to 2 tbsp for a thicker syrup, and upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.  With those changes, the best apple crisp I've ever had.

This recipe is delicious!!  I followed the directions with the following exceptions: (1) I tossed the apples in the sugar, cinnamon and flour as one reviewer had suggested and (2) I did not add any water.  The granny smith apples I used were juicy enough - the extra water would have been way too much.

The crust was very good.  Nice flavor.  I may cut back sugar to a half a cup the next time I make it because it was a tad bit too sweet.

OMG so good. im 14 and i love to cook/bake so when my mom brought home tons of apples from the local orchard i knew id have to make an apple crisp. i added lemon juice another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples. the water isnt too much at all. the topping is plentyy, since it should be all about the apples. oh and i baked for 35 minutes and the apples were plenty done. i wouldnt bake anymore or it would get mushy. sooooo good! thanks for my new apple crisp recipe!

I have to say I was a bit dissapointed with this recipe. There were soooo many EXCELLENT reviews about it I was expecting more than what I got. I followed this recipe to the T, except I added only 1/2 the water like many other people suggested. It still seemed too watery and mushy. The title is deceiving! lol... I guess I was really expecting something crispy- far from that. But it was good, I just would not make it again.

This was the worst apple crisp i have ever had.  The crumble top resembled more of a oatmeal cookie and not the sweet crunchy crumble i love on a crisp.
I would never make this again... waste of time.

I loved this recipe as it is written but wanted it a bit more healthy for some guests' needs.  I substituted whole wheat flour and instead of using 1 cup of flour for the topping, I used 1/2 cup flour; 1/4 cup ground pecans; 1/4 cup slivered almonds. It increases the fat, but decreases the white flour content.  I also used a Splenda Blend instead of the sugar.

Is it possible to ward off loneliness with apple crisp?  The answer apparently is “yes” – but only if you believe in the recipe.  With its shortened list of ingredients and easy, fail-proof instructions, this recipe inspires confidence.  Be sure to use only the crispest apples you can find, and go easy on the sugar.  Served warm, with a single scoop of vanilla ice cream, this classic recipe is like being visited by a dear, long-parted friend.

The topping reminded me of an oatmeal cookie.  Good flavor, but the topping was not as crumbly as I prefer.  It was a bit hard.  Next time I will not melt the butter, I will just cut it in.  Thanks.

This apple crisp is delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and skipped the water completely, turned out great without it. I also doubled the crust and I am so glad that I did. I made the mistake of slicing my apples a bit too thin and they got mushy, my fault. I won't do that again. This is easy, fairly quick and yummy, cannot go wrong with this one. I will be making this over and over again!

This recipe is easy and excellent. It's hard to judge how much sugar you need to sprinkle on the apples because some apples are naturally sweeter than others. I used what the recipe called for but I think mine would have been better with a bit less sugar ( and I love sweet, sweet desserts). I questioned the addition of water because I didn't want a soupy crisp but I did add the liquid and it was in the form of apple juice.  Excellent addition. It was not soupy at all (after it had cooled a bit, it set nicely) and the apple juice really added a nice flavor. I actually made 2 pans and in the other I used orange juice instead - also wonderful. Almost better actually.  The only other change I made was to add a big splash of vanilla to the crumble part on top. It kind of made it taste more like a cookie on top.  This is a really good traditional apple crisp. Good way to use up apples that are less than perfect to eat by themselves.

This was EXCELLENT! Based on the other reviews, which were very helpful, I used 1/2 the sugar, did not use water and mixed the apples w/ the ingredients before placing in the pan.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out awesome!  Used 9 or 10 Granny Smith apples.

Amazing! This is a lazy weekend favourite of ours. I makes a great breakfast treat or a nice after dinner dessert. I really love the topping and so I tend to double up to make sure there is plenty to go around.

Absolutely the hit of the party! I followed others suggestions by doubling the topping and using only 1/4 cup water. The search is over; this is the most sinful, perfect crisp recipe!

This is THE best apple crisp i have ever made.  I used Cortland apples, and omitted the water, increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2tsp and added 1/2tsp nutmeg to the apples.  We also love nuts, so as i doubled the topping, i also added 3/4cup chopped walnuts.  yummmmmmmmy!

Awesome. I couldn't find my usual recipe, so I made this instead. It is now my only apple crisp recipe! I made this for a family get together and it was gone in seconds! Everyone wanted the recipe and I had to make another one the next day.

I used all Granny Smith from my own tree. I halved the sugar(For personnel preference) and I did not add the water. This recipe was GREAT! Thank you for posting the recipe.

This was my first homemade apple crisp, and I was very pleased. I used 1/4 cup apple cider instead of 1/2 cup water. Next time I may try adding the full 1/2 cup apple cider just to see what it does to the consistancy.  I also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the filling.  I sprinkled the sugar mixture over the apples and it turned out fine.  Next time I will try tossing the apples with the mixture to see if it makes a difference.  Smelled wonderful baking!

The best! I googled for "The best Apple Crisp" this was excellent. I had fresh apples I had frozen...the only variation to recipe was I used Splenda brown sugar, instead of water I used apple juice and not quite as much as recipe called for, and I was out of baking powder. I am saving this and will definitely use it again. I have several batches of apples I have frozen and some peaches I will try this with.

Excellent recipe!!! I used 1/2 cup rather than 1 cup white sugar and it was still plenty sweet. Reduced water to 1/4 cup. Mixed water, sugar, flour and cinnamon into apples rather than just pouring over. I look forward to making many variations of this recipe, mixing fruits, etc... Thanks!!!

I just made this exactly as written--not one change and I think it came out perfect.  I used 9 medium/small Granny Smith apples, mixed them in a bowl with the flour, white sugar, cinn. and water then put them in a 9x13 pan.  Some people mentioned they would put it in a smaller pan than that, but I really don't know how it'd all fit in a smaller pan if you're making the full recipe.  Put the crumble on top and voila--perfection! If you think it is too watery, you probably haven't let it set/cool down.  I've made it twice and the first time I cooled it and it was not watery at all, the second time I tried to eat while hot out of the oven and while still delicious, was a bit watery.  Just like a pie, if you let it cool, it will gel up for you.

This was absolutely fabulous!! My only suggestion is to substitute the water for a mixture of 1/3 water, 2/3 vanilla. I think ice cream & whip cream would be too much...have a coffee with Baileys instead! Thank you for a lovely recipe that even a beginner such as myself could not ruin!

I've made this a couple of times now, for family gatherings, and it's been a big hit both times. Thing only thing I ever change is the size of pan. Definitely use a smaller pan. I use 8x8.

This was our 4th of July desert, along with Vanilla Ice Cream IV.  It was a big hit, except the kids didn't eat the cooked apples.  I used 6 large green apples (tossed in the sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mixture) and double the topping; cutting in the butter instead of melting it.  Next time I will one-and-a-half the topping because it made too much in my opinion--
I had to get a bigger pan to hold it all!  I forgot to add the water, but it still cooked nicely since apples hold a lot of moisture.  But I like my apple crisp more saucy so I will make sure to add the water next time. Pecans would be really yummy in this as well.

This is a great recipe, but next time I will use a bit less sugar in the apple mixture.  I followed previous reviews and made my own changes.  Instead of water I used 1/4 cup orange juice.  I doubled the topping, but might try a bit less next time and added 2T shredded coconut and 2T chopped pecans.  This was great, can't wait to make it again!  FYI you must get one of those apple peeler/slicers gadgets, my son loves to help out and they make for fast work!  Ours was only $30 and it gets lots of use!

I am not a big fan of apple deserts, but my husband wanted apple crisp for his birthday. I found this recipe and I am so glad because I thought I could never like apple crisp. It tasted really good especially w/ vanilla ice cream.  My husband loved it, so thanks on his behalf too.

Absolutely perfect!  My husband who usually dislikes fruit desserts loved this.  I followed several suggestions and reduced the water to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the apples.  I also doubled the topping ingredients and added 1/2 tsp salt to the topping.  Came out amazing.  Gonna be a classic in our household!

I made the recipe pretty much as is (except I used softened butter instead of melted butter) and everyone loved it. It worked especially well with vanilla ice cream. The next time I make this, I'd probably tweak the following: substitute 1/3 cup orange juice for the water, substitute half of the white sugar for light brown sugar (and probably use less sugar overall), and add the nutmeg to the apple mixture. If I wasn't going to serve this with vanilla ice cream, I'd probably want to add a little vanilla extract too.

This was a big hit, and very easy (except for the apple peeling, of course). It was delicious with ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I could give 4.5 stars. This was a delicious apple crisp. I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly into an 8x8 pan. I  used half brown sugar and half white sugar on the apples. I had cut the water two tablespoons, but after baking it was definitely too runny. Next time I'll leave out the water or add more flour to the apples. But the flavor is definitely right on. It was my husband's first time having apple crisp and he is a big fan of it now!

definitely use less water (the bottom was runny). and use very sweet apples, because we didn't, and even though everything else was perfect, we couldn't get over how tart our apples were. the topping is excellent, but you will have lots of it on your plate, so eat this with vanilla ice cream!

The reviewers are correct this is amazing.  I used Granny Smith apples, added a pinch of nutmeg, decreased the water, and doubled the topping (which I layered on the top and bottom).  Although I love crumb topping, I actually thought that doubling the crumb topping was a little much.

I mixed the white sugar, flour, cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg with the apples and cut out the water content - not needed since it is naturally very juicy. Use only Granny Smith apples or it will come out too mushy or too sweet. Cut down on the amount of brown sugar in the topping or mixed in with the apples - too sweet and drowned out the great taste of the apples. Also, double the topping and instead of melting the butter, cut it into the topping to resemble course bread crumbs for that crispy/crumbly top.  For that special touch, add coarsely chopped pecans or any other nut you prefer - I added pecans and it was just delicious.

Very yummy and simple.  I cut the recipe in half, because I made it in a pie pan.  Drizzled with a little carmel and topped with homemade whipcream! Yum!

WOW!!! What a great apple crisp.  I'm a baker at a retirement community which houses some of the pickiest folks I've ever met.  I decided to switch up my old apple crisp and try something new, and after making the switch I now have no intention of going back to my old crisp.  I made this using a canned apple pie filling, I made the topping according to the recipe but I added the cinnamon from the apple layer to it.  I also added a small amount of nutmeg.  This is a fool proof topping.  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!!!!!

This was perfect... exactly what I was looking for!  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 pan; it was perfectly cooked in 45 minutes.  Just added a dash of nutmeg to the apples... served hot with vanilla bean icecream and caramel topping.  Thank you!

This was very good!  I made it for Christmas Day and everyone loved it.  I followed a couple of the suggested changes.  I used granny smith apples.   I shook the apple slices in the 1 cup sugar, cinnamon (which I increased to 1/2 Tablespoon), 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (which I added to the recipe) and flour mixture.  I softened the butter and then mixed it with the topping in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I doubled the topping as many suggested BUT I found it was too much.  I only used half.  I planned to use apple juice in place of the water but I forgot to add it.  I am glad I forgot.  It was perfect.  We ate it warm with quality vanilla ice cream.

This was my first apple crisp, and I wasn't disappointed at all!  I omitted the water, as it is not needed.  I followed what other posters said and added nutmeg to the topping.  Also, instead of layering the topping, I mixed everything together and put on top of the apples.  I kept it covered for the first 20 mins of baking and then left uncovered for the last half of baking.  It was bubbly and delicious!

Fantastic! I used eight medium to medium large Braeburn apples. I cut and peeled the apples into eights and laid then opposing directions in the pan. I diced the last apple to fill in the gaps. I doubled the cinnamon but used good stuff from a local spice store, china cassia I think? I also added the same amount of freshly ground nutmeg. I served it with Bryer's Double Churn ice cream, the kind without Splenda. Very tasty and not too heavy. My mom has made apple crisp my whole life and it's one of my favorite desserts. She said this was better then hers. That's saying something considering how well she cooks. Thanks for sharing it.

This apple crisp recipe is sssooo good!!! I made a 13x9 pan for my husband and I and we ate half the pan in one night!! The taste was just perfect.  The only thing I changed, was that I doubled the topping recipe which was just a little more than I needed but one batch wasn't enough for us.  Other than that, the recipe is absolutely perfect just the way it is! :) You gotta try this! YUM!

How could over 1,000 people be wrong??  Really good but I think it can be better than written with the following changes.  I had A LOT of golden delicious apples, about 15 cups. Because they weren't sour, I left the sugar one cup and doubled the cinnamon and flour, didn't put the water and also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, juice of 1 lemon and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla to apples.  Piled them in a deep corningware dish, doubled the crust adding to it 2 tsp. cinnamon, another 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. salt. But I think for me, doubling the crust was a little much, next time I think I will leave it as written, (only to make it less fat, but the crust was outstanding) Baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes, however next time 1 hour will be enuff.  My house smelled HEAVENLY while it was cooking and everyone raved about the crisp served with vanilla ice cream.  I will be making for many years to come!

This was really easy, quick and good!  I used Splenda instead of white sugar and I did cut the recipe in half (6 servings and used an 8x8 glass bakeware).  I also used a mix of Red Delicious and Golden Delicious.  Can't wait to have it with vanilla ice cream!  Yum!!

Great!  I made it in an 8inch pan and decreased the apples to approx. 7 cups but kept the topping the same. I will make it again.

Loved it! I made this recipe for a work party and people kept coming back for more! I used Granny Smith apples, omitted the water, and added a little nutmeg.  I also let the sliced apples rest in the sugar mixture for about a half hour before putting the oat mixture on.  Serve warm over vanilla ice cream and you have Heaven in a bowl!

Oh my. Talk about the perfect fall dessert. I doubled the crust as other suggested, putting it on bottom and on top. All I can say is that this was a knockout recipe. Next time, though, I will use Granny Smith apples instead of Gala. Don't get me wrong, it was still awesome, but the Granny Smiths would kick it up a notch....

use less water, as others have suggested, add extra cinnamon and add a pinch of nutmeg.

So Yummy!  I like lots of crust on my apple crisp, so I also like to make this in an 8 X 8 pan if I am just making it for our family.  I just fill the pan with apples, and make the full amount of crust and spread over the top. Best Apple Crisp of ALL RECIPES!

This was a great Apple Crisp! I loved the crunchy topping. Just what I was looking for for a quick apple recipe. I did cut the water in half as the other reviews suggested.

This was such a good way to use apples in dessert. The only things I changed were that I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and did not melt the butter which turned out great. I think it helped to reduce the water because it was just the right consistency. My baking time also wasn't quite as long. I might try it with syurp instead of water next time and reduce the sugar. This is one of those things that tastes even better the second day.  Thanks a bunch!

The crust really is the best!  I doubled the crust and pressed half of it down as a bottom layer. I also cut in chilled butter instead of melted butter. I mixed the apples (I used red/green somewhat sweet small apples from my tree) with the sugar (only 1/2 cup because of the sweet apples). I had let the apples soak in lemon water while I cut them, so I only used about 1/3 cup of water. It was plenty moist. Oh ya, I also used about 3 Tablespoons cinnamon (I love it) and about 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Next time I'll halve this recipe though, it's so much for just two people!

Awesome!!  I made it for the 2nd time tonight! The first time I made this it was for a dinner party and everyone loved it!  My husband is not a fan of anything with fruit and he asked me to make it again so I did tonight. I will be making this many more times I'm sure. I took the advice of some of the other ladies who posted reviews; I doubled the topping so I had a layer at the bottom and on the top of the apples, I cut the sugar in half and omitted 1/2 cup of the flour in the topping. The first time it was just a little too dry, but now it's absolutely perfect!!

This was perfect. I followed the recipe except for a couple minor changes first i added a LOT more cinnamon to the apple mixture (3-4 tbsp) and i tossed the apples in the sugar mixture rather than just sprinkling it on top. It turned out perfectly. I will definitely make this again

Truly delicious. I baked my dish at 375 for 40 minutes rather than 350 for 45 and it was perfectly crunchy! I also followed suggestions to use a touch of nutmeg, doubled the crust and 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup. This has already earned a spot as a "fall staple" in or home!

Awesome recipe! I tried it today and I used the advice of the previous review.  For example I did mix the white sugar and cinnamon recipe with the apples instead of spreading it on top and I only used 1/4 cup of water instead of half. I also doubled the dose as you recommended (layer of crisp on top and bottom) and it was delicious!  Here's a hint of how I mixed the crisp recipe...I blended all of the ingredients for the crisp part along with chopped walnuts and I used cold butter cut into pieces instead of melted butter.  The apple crisp was so good, even better than what you get at restaurants!  Enjoy!

Yummy. I doubled the crust like many other reviewers suggested, however I don't think it needed it. Next time I will stick to the recipe! Update- I like it much better with only one serving of the crust. Gala apples are best because they stay crisp after cooking.

Excellent recipe.  Apples are sooo good for you. i reduced the white sugar to about 1/4 (used jonamac apples).  The topping is great and crunchy.  The sweetness in the apples and the brown sugar in the topping is just right so that you don't need that much white sugar.

I've made this many times and my husband loves it. I think that the amount of topping is perfect. It's even better if you add some crushed nuts (pecans or walnuts). I think it's a bit too sweet, but no one else agrees with me so I have not tried to cut back on the sugar.

I thought that this was a very good recipe.  The only thing that I did different was I added more cinnamon and bit of nutmeg with the apples because my family likes things more spicy, and I added some toasted almonds in with the flour because I had them on hand.

Whenever I make this, I get rave reviews!  The topping is so good I multiply it by 1 & 1/2. Plus I halve all the sugars.  I bump the cinnamon up to 1 Tbl., and add a bit of nutmeg as well.  I often sneak wheat germ or bran into the topping, and nary a person has noticed yet.  This is a winner, Diane!

This was a delicious apple crisp. I substitued 1/4 pure maple syrup for 1/4 cup of the water and it worked out great.  I will make this next time I have to bring desert somewhere.

Awesome recipe!! The first time I made this for a family bbq, I didn't add the water & it came out wonderfully--everyone couldn't stop raving about it! The second time I made it (just for my family), I still didn't use any water, I substituted Splenda for the granulated sugar & the Spenda Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar in the topping & it still came out excellent! This is a wonderful recipe whether using regular sugar or a sugar substitute. Thank you for sharing your receipe!

Delicious!  I doubled the "crust" recipe and added a layer to both the top and bottom, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and went to town on this.  So good!

We used granny smith & gala apples (7 med. apples = 10 cups).  As others reviewed, ½ c sugar & water was enough.  We also mixed ¼ c maple syrup w/ the water. (very good addition!) This recipe is delicious warm or at room temp.  High recommendations on this recipe.

This recipe was pretty simple to make and very tasty! I cut the recipe in half and used peaches as well as apples and it turned out pretty good, although the peach nectar turn the bottom into a very thick syrup. But it still was yummy :)

This is a good recipe, but it's really sweet (and I have a big sweet tooth).  Next time I'd use 10 cups of apples or less sugar.

Very good recipe, and very very easy. I used pears instead of apples because thats all I had in my house, but it came out great nonetheless. I cant wait to try the recipe again with apples.

OMG!!!This is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten! Thank you Diane Kester and many thanks to the reviews to help take it over the top! I headed the suggestions of no water none is needed; I used Granny Smith apples they make their own moisture. It was not dry at all. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp. cloves as one reviewer suggested it made me think of thanksgiving and great times with great friends. I also mixed the apples with the sugar/flour spice mix before adding to pan. I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts after the butter was cut into the crumble topping. I will no longer look for an apple crisp recipe again. My family went ape over this. I would make this everyday if it wasn't so fattening!!!! I'm going to try this with peaches next.

Uh...perhaps I did something wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't know, but I found the topping kind of mushy, not "crisp" like it should be. I have definetly had better apple crisps. I don't think I will be making this again. Sorry.

Great recipe, definate family pleaser. With a few changes the recipe was made even more delicous.
I used 7-8 granny smith apples and coated them with the sugar mixture before laying them in the pan. I also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and nutmeg to sugar mixture and only 1/4 cup water. I doubled the crust and had one layer on the bottom and one on the top and added almonds to one of the batches. Terrific recipe, my very picky brother couldn't quit eating it!

This was an excellent recipe, especially when the comments by reviewers are taken into consideration. I only used half of the white sugar sprinkled on the apples, plus only half of the brown sugar for the topping. It was wonderful, with vanilla ice cream. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan, which was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was gone way fast after I made it! I doubled the crumbly mixture, which just added to the goodness! If i were to make it again, I would just take out the water alltogether I think, cause it was a little runny with just reducing it! Thanx a bunch:)

FABULOUS. Just like apple crisp should be. I followed the advice of using half the water, and it turned out perfect. Next time I will also halve the sugar on the apples. My fiance loved this, and he is a chocoholic!

Excellent apple crisp.  I've made this many times--I've had problems with it being watery so I always omit the water; I also only use 1/2 cup white sugar on the bottom instead of one cup.  The topping is perfect as is.

Wow!  Really, this is a perfect crisp and you should make it!  My only change was doubling the topping as many others suggested...now, I can't believe I am saying this, but I think it was a tad much, and I used 12 cups of Granny Smith apples!  I think 1 1/2 would be perfect as the topping...one batch doesn't seem like it would have been enough.  I didn't lessen any sugar, but used half brown sugar with the apples...you will not be disappointed with this one!

This was such a yummy recipe!  The only change I made was to double the topping.  I think next time I will add less sugar to the apples also--a bit too sweet for my taste.  The only apple crisp recipe I will use from now on.  Really, really good!  Thankyou

I gave it 4 stars because I did make some changes.  As some others have posted, I omitted the water and it turned out great.  Also, I used just a 1/2 cup sugar and it was still way too sweet.  It's probably partially due to the fact that I used Gala apples, which are sweet.  I would prefer a tart apple in this, but I was snowed in and I had no choice!  So maybe the sugar would be ok with a more tart apple.  I would also double the crisp....I didn't think there was quite enough. Besides all that, I really did like it and I'll make it again!

Hi there!!! I tried this recipe for the first time last night...it was GREAT!! But...I did alter it quite a bit, as there were some people who sent in reviews saying the topping was not "crisp" enough. I used 6 granny smith apples, and I followed another reviewers suggestion to put the sugar, and cinnamon in a bag and coat the apples inside of it. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the mixture. Once I had done this, I was going to start to prepare the topping, but realized that I had run out of brown sugar. I left the apples to coat in the bag while i ran to the store. After I returned about 20 minutes later, the coating was almost syrupy from the apple juices, which actually helped in the cooking process, as I only needed to add 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup. I altered the topping as follows:
I only used these ingredients: 3/4 cup flour, 1 cup quick oats, 1 cup brown sugar, and 3/4 cup melted butter...but I only added 1/4 cup at a time, and cut it into the mixture. I cooked at the same temperature as the original recipe, and for a few minutes less, and it turned out great...the topping was crunchy and crisp...and my husband says it's the best apple crisp I've made!!!

Gosh this was good!  Much healthier without the crust, and used Splenda in the apples instead of regular sugar.  Also soaked the apples in spiced cider for more moisture and flavor.  Delicious.

i had to leave feedback on this one, because all of the other feedback was so helpful!

fantastic recipe. i just hosted big christmas eve family dinner for the first time and made this for dessert. i modified the recipe in the following way (per previous suggestions)
-doubled the crust recipe
-ommitted water
-added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the apple mixture

i also prepared this the night before, and kept the crust and apple pieces seperate before baking. since i had no room in the refrigerator, i had to freeze the apple mixture and thaw the next day. i wanted to mention this part in case there are any other less-experienced cooks out there like me wondering if such a process would ruin the finished product.

oh, and i served it with a scoop of caramel ice cream!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving & it was a big hit!  The prep is a little time consuming (peeling, coring & slicing) but the end product is worth it.  I brought it around to my in-laws & my family's home and everyone loved it.  It's easy to assemble & it's a real crowd pleaser.

First off, the taste was wonderful.  However, I didn't feel that the apples were cooked to my satisfaction so I doubled the cook time to 1.5 hours.  Unfortunately, it came out REALLY watery for some reason even though I omitted the water.  Must have been the type of apple I used.  The topping was really crisp and tasty.  I really love that stuff and I felt that there was more than enough without doubling the recipe like some of the reviewers recommend.  I'll need to experiment with types of apples next time around.  Very good with some cool whip!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and it ended up being ate up by the family that stopped by over the next week.  Everyone loved it and it tasted better the next day.  I was taking the suggestion of mixing the apples in a cinnamon and sugar mixture before putting on the topping, but I forgot and layered the entire bottom so I just sprinkled the apples with cinnamon, sugar and a little allspice and it turned out good!  I doubled the topping and left out the water also. I might make some in the next few weeks with apples being all over the place now.

This was great! I omitted the water, as others had suggested, cut down on a bit of the sugar, and I also made a caramel sauce with butterscotch caramel chips, corn syrup and a bit of water- over med. heat on stove, and drizzled that on top with - oh so yummy!! Will for sure make again.

Excellent.  Doubling  the topping seemed too much but 1 and 1/2 times was just perfect. Didn't use any water as most recommended and have to say it was the right choice, the apples were moist and juicy on their own. The only changes I would make are to reduce the amount of white sugar by half and add an equal amount of allspice to the cinnamon. I'm going to try this recipe with pears next!

not bad... i made it for my apple club and everyone enjoyed it, the only issue is that it needs to have the side of ice cream, until i find an apple crisp that can be eaten alone the best any of them can get is 4

This recipe is very good- however, i am only giving it 4 stars because it is a little sweet. This may be my fault because i dont think i used enough apples. I would suggest to others that you make sure to use plenty of apples- i used 5 and could probably have used double that amount. The taste of the topping is very good. I will try this again with more apples because i really do believe this has 5 star potential.

Apple crisp that's actually crisp! This was so yummy -- the only change I made was to use less apple than called for (just because that's the way I prefer it). Thanks!

Here are a few changes I made: 
4 cups of Gala apples & 4 cups Honeycrisp apples and omit water. 
Instead of doubling the topping ingredients, I used an 8.5x11 glass baking dish, instead of a 9x13.
Once the apples were medium diced (not sliced) I added only 2/3 white sugar, 1T of flour and cinnamon (more could be added to taste) to them and let set for about 10 minutes or so. In regards to the topping, I used dark brown sugar and made sure the unsalted butter was softened, not melted. 
This recipe is GREAT!!!

Awesome!! I made this for my husband to take to work for a party and, of course, I had to try it. I ate almost half of it to myself! Unbelievably good! My husband had to hide it from me so there was some left for him to take. He told a friend it was "killer" apple crisp! I used 10 Northern Spy apples, didn't add water and I doubled the topping. Excellent! I am making it again this weekend!

The most work intensive part of the recipe was peeling the apples! I made this recipe for the people in my office, but I had to sneak it out of the house because my boyfriend didn't want to part with it. It suggest serving it warm with fresh cream or with vanilla or pumpkin ice cream. The only drawback was that the crust stuck to the bottom of the dish and was hard to serve. Next time I'll make a thicker crust and grease the pan better. Also, watch that you don't let the butter soften too much for the crumble mixture or you'll end up with brown sugar droppings instead of crumbles. I used dark brown sugar and it turned out great!

I don't get all the raves.  I won't make this recipe again, no offense. Too much water in the bottom of the pan after baking.It was fine after fishing all the water out. I also baked it for 15 more mins.,as I like tender apples in an apple crisp, not crunchy apples. Wish I would have read the reviews before making this one. In it's defense, the topping was delicious after adding more cinnamon.

This was very good and very easy. I can't say much more that hasn't already been said except... warning... the apples coated with sugar and spices are awesome!  Stop right there and you have an awesome treat!  I did double the topping and it was too much. Based on the reviews, I felt it would be dangerous to have a full pan of this sitting around so I split into two square pans (froze one) and had so much topping that I tried to put on the bottom as well as top.  A good apple peeler is a must, like the pampered chef one.  Oh, and I was doing this recipe to use up leftover apples from apple picking so these were not the freshest, crispest available and it was still delicious!!

Excellent recipe!  I thought it was a little on the sweet side, and would have preferred a dash more cinnamon, but overall delicious and hubby said it was the best he's ever tasted!  Thanks.

Very good recipe, nice and simple. I'd never made apple crisp before and this was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I'll definetly make this again for the holidays.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I've made it 3 times in the past 6 weeks with a few alterations each time.  First time, did it other suggested doubling the topping (but not the oats) - it was perfect although i found the cinnamon flavor a bit strong.  The second time, I was out of oats but still doubled the other topping mixture while decreasing the cinnamon a bit and it was fabulous.  I like ours cold so the water issue is probably not as big for us as it is pretty firm when chilled.  As I type this my daughter is cutting up apples to do it all over again.  This is definately a keeper!

My husband loved this recipe. I used 5 granny smith apples and 4 gala apples. The gala were so juicy that I did not add any water and it turned out perfect!

My family loved it! I didn't add any water, I don't know why you would need water, the juice of the apples gives plenty of moisture. I doubled the topping, but I won't next time - we would have preferred more apple less topping

This was my first apple crisp--yummy!!!  I used 1/4 C of water, which i would delete next time.  Little watery.  I also used old fashioned quaker oats, and chopped them a little finer in a chopper.  The topping of the apple crisp tasted just like oatmeal cookies.

OUTSTANDING.  I omitted the water, doubled the topping, and added some graham cracker crumbs I had leftover in the pantry.  The BEST.
Oh, and I used half granny smith and half braeburn.  (total of 6 apples)

I made this apple crisp for friends we had for dinner last night and it was the perfect fall dessert. I left out the water as suggested and am so glad I did.. The apples produce enough juice. I recommend making 1 1/2 times the recommended topping. So yummy and will definitely go in my permanant recipe box.

This is a terrific recipe for fall.  I typically halve the apple filling part of the recipe so that there's more topping.  I like to use Jonathan apples for this one.  I typically cut the water in half or omit it altogether.  Try serving with vanilla ice cream for a real treat!

Really, really good. I used rather juicy apples and added in a few pears so I had to extract some juice at the end, but WOW! Like some others I too made extra topping.  Also, I used all organic ingredients which really punches up the flavors. yummmmmm..... :-))))

This was just ok.  I doubled the topping as others suggested and didn't really care for the topping at all.  It was an "average" apple crisp...served it to friends who said it was "good" but didn't get the oooo's and ahhh's I was looking for..

ps - I did not add as much water, but you need to make that judgement on the type of apples you use.

I made this recipe for the daycare center where I work as a cook, and it's a hit! I made it with half as much topping and only 1/4 cup of sugar with the apples, and it's still delicious. I also skipped adding water. I will be making this again!

Great, great, great!  The smell of it baking was unbelievable.  I, too, didn't measure exactly 10 cups of apples - in fact, I had the 9 x 13 pan heaping full.  Made 1-1/2 times the topping for added crunch and texture - will it last long?  NOPE!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Doubled the topping for extra crunch. Only used 8 cups of apples instead of 10 cups. Makes the house smell great and tastes even better. Recipe takes some time, due to peeling apples but it was worth it.

I'm only reviewing the crumb topping (made a pear crisp instead) and I must say the topping is just perfect.  So tasty and not too terribly unhealthy either!

all i have to say is "wow" for such an easy dessert, it has so much flavor.  I had a lot of canned peaches in my pantry and used them instead of apples, and upped the flour by a tablespoon.  Next time i will add cinnamon to the topping mixture.  great for a last minute dessert.

This was an awesome and easy recipe. I actually made peach crisp.  Followed the same steps, just used peaches.  I also added a dash of lemon juice on top of the peaches before spreading the oat mixture on top.  Also, added some all spice, ground cloves, and a tad of ginger.

This was very yummy, but, for those who use Paula Red apples, I would recommend decreasing the cooking time by about 30 minutes. I eliminated the water and my apples were still mushy...more like applesauce. I'll try again.

I changed the recipe just a tad, used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar, added nutmeg as well as cinnamon, and put a couple of cloves on the top of the crisp. I also dribbled a little bit of maple syrup over the top just before baking. Beautiful!

This was such an easy recipe and is incredibly yummy! My husband is a big apple pie fan and I wanted a recipe that was easier to make for him but had a similar flavor. I'm not a big apple fan, but even I must admit that this was fabulous served slightly warm with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yumm!

I used Granny Smith apples and followed the recipe.  I did double the topping based off of recommendations and this was the best apple crisp I've ever had.  My guests raved about it and my father also said it was the best apple crisp ever.  I will definitely make this again!

I am not a fan of apple pie or crisps but everyone devoured it and said it was delicious, I served it with vanilla ice cream. I personally thought it is REALLY rich.

I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 c., may use even less next time since this was a bit sweet for my taste. I'd also reduce the water a bit, and add a teaspoon or two of lemon juice. But the flavor and texture was great and the rest of my family raved about it, so I'm still giving it five stars.

My dad used to make apple crisp for Thanksgiving using the apples from the trees in our back yard.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, and the water to 1/4 cup. I also mix the sugar and cinnamon with the apples at least an hour before making to mix the flavors. Serve warm with vanilla bean ice cream! So good!

I’ve made this recipe many, many times before. As Diane Koester who posted this recipe said”Use Granny Smith apples and double the topping.” Absolutely fabulous! I keep going back to the remarks to see if it is possible to assemble this in advance and then bake it after a couple of hours later or not. If anyone has suggestions on this I am very interested!

ohh mmyy gosh...I eyeballed my way through the recipe..cut it in half b/c I only had four apples...used less butter...and it came out DELICIOUS! It came out a little soupy even without the water, its sweet apple sauce is even better to put over ice cream!

This recipe was pretty good. Me and my fiancee added nutmeg and instead of water we substituted half and half.I think it would be awsome with vanilla or french vanilla ice cream on top.

Easy & hit the spot -- I scaled this down to 2, then made 2 single servings in tiny pyrex cups (like small glass ramekins, maybe?), and it was perfect!  The only thing I would change is scaling down (maybe cutting out) the sugars, since I used the maple & brown sugar flavored oatmeal packet (single serving), since that's all I had around for quick cooking oats.  But a fab, quick snack!

This was a big hit at a football party.  I served it with vanilla ice-cream and a little carmel sauce. I did double the topping as someone else suggested and it was a perfect amount. I will definately make again!

Very good, but watch out - it makes a lot.  And the topping is not crispy the next day.  I'll make half a batch next time, which should be enough for 8 to 10 people.

Look no further...this is the one!  I used it to replace my lost family recipe and have made it dozens of times in the last few months.  Only change, I do not use the baking powder or soda in the topping.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

My mom has always made apple crisp for me as a child and this kicked it hardcore.  I loved it and I will keep this recipe.  I added 3 cups nectarines in the place of some apples and it was amazing.  I would also suggest that you go 1.5 times the topping.  I also used about 2/3 cup sugar for the fruit and there were absolutely no complaints.

Absolutely the best without a doubt! I do not use the water through because it is too runny. Update: I have made this as gifts for several people. They tell me it is the best they have ever had! My favorite apple to use is Honeycrisp. They are a sweet-tart and very juicy apple, that is why i do not add the water to the recipe. They perfect Fall dessert!

This is very good but, I can't believe I am saying this because I am such a sweets person, it is too sweet. I will make again but decrease some of the sugar. It has a very  nice texture and I even substituted 1/2 of the flour with wheat flour. Everybody enjoyed it!

Absolutely yummy! I followed the suggestions of others and omited the water, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and doubled the topping mixture. I made this for a crowd of people who all thought it was delicious!

Delicious!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and the water to 1/4 cup.  However, I think it can do without the water.  Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!  My search for the perfect apple crisp is over.  We loved this recipe...even the kids loved it & they have never been big on desserts with fruit in it.  It was very easy...I doubled the crisp topping & added more butter as suggested.  We're going apple picking this weekend & can't wait to make this recipe again!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was THE best apple crisp recipe l've found.  I omitted the water because the apples seemed juicy enough, and I mistakenly put the white sugar in the topping instead of the apples, but it still was wonderful!  Thank you for a great recipe, Diane  :)

This recipe is SO GOOD!! I added an extra 1/4 cup butter, and also did away with the water. I also added 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and lots of cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the apples. It's extremely easy to make, and very much worth trying.

This was great!  My family loves the crunchy topping, so I doubled it and it was incredible.

Try this one...I can't believe your family wouldn't love it!

On the advice of others, I increased the butter in the topping to 1 cup.  Came out too sticky.  Keep it at 1/2c.  I couldn't resist taking a bite of the topping before cooking... I almost didn't cook it.  I could have sat there all day and just ate the topping, it was sooo good!!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I've tried many crisp recipes and never liked them. But I tried this one and it is good! Only difference is 1C butter & added cinnamon to the crust (plus to the apples) because we're cinnamon freaks! Very good!

My apples came out mushy and soggy- almost like a chunky applesauce... I should have read the recomendations of ommitting the water and Im sure it would have been great.  The topping was fabulous.  I'll make this again but without the water!

This might seem like a weird thing to review in the middle of summer, but I actually made it with peaches because none of the peach crisp recipes looked that good.  I used 5 cups of fresh peaches cut into thin slices.  I then put on half the amount of sugar, the full amount of flour and cinnamon, and one quarter cup of water.  I love lots of topping, so I made twice the amount of it, using traditional rolled oats, not quick cooking, so some of the extra juices were absorbed, but there was still a nice crunchy layer on top. I hope that some other people who have had troubles with too much sweetness or water are helped by these hints and I cannot wait to try this recipe in the fall with apples.  Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe that can be used with such a variety of fruits!

Great. I made this with a frozen bag of mixed berries and no apples.
I then cut the white sugar in half and omitted the cinnamon.
Delicous and no apples to peel!

A great apple crisp, although I admit I did change it quite a bit to try to make it healthier. Like others, I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I've also made this with Splenda replacing the white sugar & it works really well too. I also increase the cinnamon to suit my own taste. For liquid, I use about 1/4 cup of orange juice - gives it a nice flavour and doesn't make it too watery. For the topping, I use 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 1 & 1/4 c. oats. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and use light butter. Even with all these modifications it is still delicious. I'm sure it would be even better with no modifications and with extra topping (the best part!), but when you're trying to eat more healthily, these changes work well.

Everything an apple crisp should be! It does not need the water - I left that out completely. I did a 1.5 recipe of the crisp portion and it turned out fantastic. Next time I will add some more oatmeal. Also, I will use less sugar on the inside - maybe 2/3 or 1/2 cup instead of the full cup - it doesn't need that.

I had a package of frozen peaches, strawberries and cherries that I didn't know what to do with so I began searching for a recipe and stumbled upon this one.  I'm so glad I did because this was excellent.  I just substituted the fresh fruit in the recipe for the frozen fruit and it was such a good home-cooked dessert.

SO AMAZING!  Humiliating to admit, my husband and I finished this whole thing in one sitting, with a pint of dulce de leche ice cream.  I substituted splenda for the white sugar, and used light butter, with no problems.

This was good.  I used four pears and four apples, and it was the perfect amount.  I used one and a half times the topping and it was perfect.

This recipe was a hit with my family, I didn't add the water (like others suggested) and I suggest that maybe cut the cup of flour, oats & brown sugar down to maybe 3/4 of a cup each. There was just to much 'dry' topping left on top and not very much "crisp". I also used spartan apples and they turned a tad 'mushy' but noone except me noticed! Over-all, a very pleasing dessert that everyone loved.

MMmmmm! I have made this twice already! I made the first one with water and second without. I agree with everyone else...you do not need to add any water. I used 2 packets of Quaker Oatmeal Raisin and Spice....delicious!

Wonderful! You will get many clumps from combining the "crumble" mixture -- be sure not to break these little clumps up, as they are the best part of the topping.

This will now be my permanent apple crisp recipe!  Just made this recipe for the first time for a family gathering and we all loved it!!  I used Granny Smith apples.  Tastes just like my grandmothers recipe, but a much healthier version!  Highly recommend!!

Very good recipe. I used 2/3 of the white sugar recommened for coating the apples and mixed it with the apple slices. Did the topping as written-it was the perfect amount. Served with vanilla ice cream. Yummy! Thank you Diane.

Yum!  I cut the sugar in half, added 50% more of all topping ingredients not including the sugar, cut the water in half, added a tsp of vanilla, and one of cinnamon to the topping.  It was not watery at all.

It was great, with a few changes. I only have 4 people in my family so I cut down the recipe. (You can do that at the bottom of the screen. Type in the amount you want.) I made the first mixture and instead of sprinkling it over them I mixed them in it. I put the sliced, peeled, and coated apples in little individual cups. I left out the water. Then I put not melted butter in the next mixture and cut it in. I sprinkled it over the apples evenly. From here if you are not serving it immediately you can put it in the refrigerator, if not instead of putting it in the over put it in the microwave for 2 min. Good Luck
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

I made this last night for the first time and didn't change a thing.  It was perfect.  The water wasn't an issue for me, but maybe that's because I made it earlier in the day and then warmed it up that night.  It was totally crispy on top and delicious.  This recipe for Apple Crisp was super easy.  I'd make it again in a minute.

This recipe is not the kind of apple crisp I like, it was very wet and too sugary.  I like mine more firm and the topping to be a little crunchy hence the "crisp". Won't try this recipe again.

I found this recipe to be pretty good.  I made it exactly how it was written but if I were to make it again i'd probably change a few things.  First I used my food processor to slice the apples and I feel like the apples were then sliced too thin.  When they baked they cooked down pretty far and were really, really soft.  If I use this recipe again i'd either slice by hand or cut the apples into chuncks and there would be more of them, I'd completely fill up the baking dish.  Also I felt like there was a lot of the crisp topping so maybe i'd layer SOME of it in with the apples.  Other than that it's easy to fix and DOES TASTE GOOD.

Egads!  This recipe is awesome!  Prep time is estimated at 30 minutes-- with an apple parer/slicer/corer the entire prep time took me closer to 15.  Very easy to make.  And the results!  YUM!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and I never will.  I'm not a big cinnamon fan, and this is delicious, not too sweet, not too cinnamony, and it really showcases the apples I recently bought from a local farm.  The topping is crunchy and sweet.  This is an excellent classic apple crisp.  My 4 year old and 1 year old ate this dessert in record time.  Wonderful!!

I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't overly pleased with the results.  The taste was good, but the water was not nessicary, the apples were just floating in liquid under the crisp topping.  The topping ammount/flavor was just right, and my only other complaint was that there was too much sugar in the apples.  The whole cup of sugar was way overpowering, even though I used tart apples, I'd try 1/3 cup next time.  I've had and made much better apple crisp. This recipe is about average. I would not use this recipe again.

This was a great apple crisp.  I did use more topping than called for and decreased the amount of sugar in the apples just a little.  I used Granny Smith's and this was good.

I made this for my family tonight....it was pretty good, I took the advise of others and reduced the sugar on the apples, but I wished I had left it according to the recipe, as it was a little tart.  I doubled the topping.  Overall it was very tasty.  I should have used the water, I used about 1/8 cup, and should have stuck to the recipe?  I doubled the crust, glad I did that.  Will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a keeper! My 12-year-old and I made this together for a potluck. It was great fun peeling and cutting the apples together. We omitted the 1/2 cup of water and doubled the crisp. I overheard several people at the potluck commenting on how good it was and wondering who made it. My daughter enjoyed the praise too.

This one is a keeper! My boyfriend has an apple tree in his yard and suggested I make us a cobbler. He thinks I'm a great cook and I didn't want to admit that baking is NOT my strong point. I found this recipe, it looked simple so I made the apple crisp instead. He LOVES it! Used 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the water and doubled the topping as others had suggested. Turned out great... THANKS!

My husband and I love Granny Smith apples, and this recipe is wonderful with them. I cut back on the water as other reviewers suggested but kept the amount of apples and topping the same. It was absolutely delicious - we ate leftovers for two days and were sad to see the dish finally empty! Goes great with pork chops and garlic new potatoes.

YUMMMMY!!  I made this two nights in a row - for two sets of friends.  The only thing I changed was that I made individual servings in ramekin dishes instead of one big baking dish.  Everyone raved about it...my friend and her husband both wanted the recipe :)  It tastes soooo good you would never think it was this easy to make!  Thanks, this one is a keeper!

Mmm, just like mom used to make....this one gets rave reviews from me AND everyone I've ever fed it to (my boyfriend said it was "dangerously good"). I halfed the apples and doubled the "crisp" for a better balance...I can't imagine how that much crisp can be enough to cover ten cups of apples.

I tried this recipe as a means to use up some eating apples from my refrigerator; therefore, I made a few changes.  Instead of water I used orange juice (yum), I only used a 1/2 cup of sweetening with the apples since they were not tart (Splenda instead of sugar to save on calories), and instead of cinnamon I substituted apple pie spice (very nice).  The topping was prepared as instructed.  

If the recipe was this great with not-so-fantastic apples... I can hardly wait to try it with some crisp granny smiths!  What a hit with the family!  Quick, easy and deee-lish-uuuus!

Very good, though a little on the sweet side.  I think it's because I didn't use granny smith apples.  Next time,  I will try using a more sour apple and also cut the sugar by just a little.  Instead of using a 9x13 pan, I used 3 nine inch pie pans -  fit perfectly.  Definately a keeper.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I have tried many apple crisp recipes over the years and never found one that made my husband happy until I tried this one.  He loved it and so did I!

WICKED GOOD. I've been looking for a keeper of an apple crisp recipe and this is IT. I, too, left out the water and doubled the topping. Came out perfect. This is pretty much THE definative Apple Crisp recipe.  NICE.

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  But I made a few revisions: 1) I used 52oz of canned apples or 1/2 of a large can (a much better buy right now :D  ) 2) I added 3T lemon juice 3) only 1/2c of white sugar 4)2/3c brown sugar 5) chopped walnuts and added them to the topping and 6)added approx. 1/2 t of nutmeg to the topping as well.  I also did not use any water in this recipe.  Because I used canned apples it only needed 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  This was awesome in that it was a quick dessert!  Also I topped each square with a dallop of whipped cream!   Even if you don't use canned apples many of these changes will make it a better crisp.

The only bad thing about this recipe is it disappears as fast as it goes together!  I didn't add anything to the apples other than a slight sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon (the Ida Red apples I had were already pretty sweet).  I cut down on the butter and sugar in the topping.  Also used a 50/50 mix of white sugar and brown sugar. I bet this recipe would be terrifc with peaches...Thanks for the awesome recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

This is my favorite apple crisp recipe - it deserves all of the rave reviews.  I use Granny Smiths and depending on the apples will sometimes adjust the amount of sugar and water.  It makes a generous amount and is even better the next day!

The best apple crisp I've ever had!  I also added some nutmeg to apples and crust and doubled the crisp recipe to pack 1/2 in bottom of pan for crust then topped it off with natural vanilla Breyers icecream when it was done and ready to serve.  Yum!!

This is a REALLY good recipe, but I used two cans of Comstock apples and added a dash of nutmeg to the apples.  I agree with the other person, there is no need for the additional water as this "juices" up nicely.  Overall though....really really yummy! Also, about 5 minutes before it comes out of the oven, I take some apple juice(only about 1/4 cup) and drizzle it over the topping, makes it a little more moist on top.

This was the best apple crisp I have ever had!  I used 5 granny smiths, but next time I think I will use 10.  ( I like a lot of apples.)  The topping was GREAT!  My husband, who is very picky, absolutely loved this dessert.  I will definately be making this again!  Thank you!!!

Made it with 3 extra-large Melrose apples, sliced with my handy-dandy 50's style Vegomatic.  Instead of doubling the topping, I went 1.5 times, which ended up being a perfect amount for the 9/13 inch pyrex pan.  Simple, fairly fast, and minimal cleanup!  Just my kind of recipe.

I have had to make this for two weekends in a row, because the family LOVE it.  It is a fabulous recipe...thanks Diane.  I too left out the water and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup.  Tomorrow is Sat, so guess what I'll be doing...yes, making it again.

yummmmy! so easy and so great! I did what some others sugg and doubled the toppings and didn't add the water. You get plenty of liquid from the apples no need for the water.

This is an amazing recipe and I have baked it 4 times in about a month. Everyone who has tasted it has asked me to print it from this web site for them. Awesome, I must say it is because of the oatmeal, it just makes it taste so close to apple pie but better! Plus this is easy to make, you just can't go wrong.

I tend not to follow recipes to the tee - since I use recipes just to create new ideas for myself.  I used this recipe to create something different...more like an apple brownie crisp.  I halved the apple mixture (the first 4 ingredients) and omitted the water, which was reecommended in previous reviews.  I then combined the remaining ingredients as the originally calls for and instead of crumbling it over the apple mixture, I mixed the coated apples into the topping mixture.  I placed this all in the pan.  For extra streusel topping, I halved the topping mixture and topped the whole pan with it.  After baking it in the oven for 40 minutes and cooling for 30 minutes - the results were SPECTACULAR!  It seems to freeze well too.  So whenever I'm in the mood for something apple-y sweet, I pop a piece in the micro, and top with sweet buttery caramel. Vanilla ice cream doesn't hurt either!  Thank you Diane for giving me the inspiration!  :)

I used 5 large ginger gold apples in a 7x11 baking dish.  I skipped the water and cut the white sugar back to about 1/2 cup and it was plenty.  I used all the topping ingredients, and it was probably a bit too much.  The topping, although delicious, overpowered the apples.  Good basic recipe.

I have never made an apple crisp before.  I tried this recipe and loved it.  My husband also enjoyed it, he loves apple crisp.  The only thing I did different, was to mix the apples with the cinnamon and sugar mixture in a bowl first and then put it in the pan so the apples were well coated.  And it definately needed to double up on the topping.  I will be making this one again!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I admit it was a bit sweet which took from the apple flavor, so next time I will make the white sugar 1/4 cup or less.  Also - I halfed the first part of the recipe so it would fit in my 9x9 square pan.  

I would make the topping for so many other things - I was thinking it would be GREAT with a sweet potatoe casserole for Thanksgiving.  

Thanks for sharing your recipe with us (my old apple crisp recipe was just apples covered in a brown sugar/butter/oats mixture).

I'm not an apple dessert fan, but this was incredible! I have to say that every time I went into the kitchen, I had to steal a bite or two. It's been requested of me to make it again and again.

Yummy Yummy...I made this using 5 granny smith apples.  I did not use the water and I doubled the topping and only used 1/c cup sugar.  It came out perfect not to sweet the apples where nice and juicy and the crisp was perfect.  I served it coffee mugs with vanilla ice cream on top.  My 2 year old loved it and he  dont like much.  Will make again over and over :)

This was a wonderful recipe.  I halfed the recipeand it was great!!  I made it this mornig and half is gone already!!  I added some vanila extract, all spice, and nutmeg.  I did cut back on the water and it was just as bubbly and good.  I did double the topping   I will definitely make again.  My two year old loved it.  She doesn't even like apples.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Yet another awesome recipe from this website!
This is a huge hit at my house.  Serve it warm with some vanilla ice cream on top and you've got it made!  Once I made it with green apples.  I didn't care for it that way.  It was too tart, but my man loved it. Great recipe!

This had a great flavor.  I used frozen apples and did not need to add the extra water.  I will definitely be making this again.

OH MY GOD! This is the best recipe I have ever tried, I search high and low on the internet and it never appeared that maybe a good recipe was in my face all along. I made mine with peaches and I made extra topping for the peaches and it was very good. Use extra topping, trust me it want be enough. The topping is good by it self

My family says nummy.  I added about 18 soft caramels (chopped in 4 pieces each) over top of the apples.  I did decrease the sugar a bit to accomodate the sweetness of the caramels.

Very good! Served to guests and they loved it. My friend asked for the recipe. I made twice the amount of topping and nearly used all of it. Because of the extra topping, seemed a little dry while baking so I sprinkled some additional water on top then finished baking. Thank you for the recipe.

After a Christmas Eve apple pie crust disaster this morning, I was left with 6 sliced apples sitting in cinnamon/nutmeg sugar & wondering what to do with them. I certainly didn't feel like making another pie crust, so I decided to give this simple recipe a try. It came out delicious! I snuck a little taste while it was still warm & I know it will be a big hit tomorrow after dinner. The oats really add a nice touch to the topping. Thanks!!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is delicious and so easy and quick to make.  I have made this one several times and it is always a hit with everyone who has tasted it.  The last time I made it, I added a 1/2c. dried cranberries to give it some color and tartness.  This is definitely one you can add to your holiday recipes!!!

Very good.  I followed everyone's advice and doubled the topping and omitted the water.  The result left it just a tad dry so I might just make it the original way next time.  Everyone did love it though.

Delicious! Simple ingredients make this a wonderful homey dessert. In the topping mixture, I added a few "shakes" of cinnamon. I serve it warm with butterscotch ripple ice cream.

This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted.  It's also easy to make.  My 12 year old sister was able to do most of it herself, aside from cutting the apples.

My husband loved this or what!  He told me that this was better than an apple pie and the best apple desert he's ever had.  It's very amazing such an easy recipe tastes so great!

Great recipe!  I loved the oatmeal topping.  I didn't have any quick oats, so I substituted them with a couple packs of the flavored breakfast oatmeal. It actually worked and tasted delicious!

Smelled great as it was baking!  It was too sweet though.  I will try it using granny smith apples next time and also with less sugar.

With all of the raves and reviews about this recipe, I couldn't help but to try it.  I cut the recipe in half to make it for my husband and myself.  Or should I say, for myself!  I ate about 90% of it within 24 hours.  This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I made it again a day later for work.  They LOVED it too!!!  Thank you for a GREAT recipe.  Next time, I will share more of it with my husband.  He LOVED it too.

Excellent recipe!  I did not use the 1/2 cup of water, just sprinkled a little water on top of the apples.  I also doubled the topping!  Thank you for a great, easy recipe!

Being 21 and just now discovering my love for cooking, this was the first time I had ever made apple crisp, and it came out GREAT!!!  Everyone loved it.  I added a handful of chopped walnuts in with the oatmeal, which gave it a little extra something.  Highly recommended!

Loved it!  Was fast and simple and the crumb topping was great.  Apple crisp has long been one of my favorite desserts and this recipe is one of the best I have had.  Easy too, with the melted butter you don't have to "cut in the butter" which takes forever.

This made a very attractive desert that my husband and or dinner guest loved.  (I chose to skip desert).  I will make this again, it's simple and coupled with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, you can't go wrong.  I only gave it three stars for "kid friendly" because my son chose to have just ice cream (typical kid?)

This is the best apple crisp! I have been looking for an apple cobbler/crisp recipe ever since i went to the New Orleans Las Vegas buffet and had the apple cobbler there. I have tried several apple crisp/cobbler recipes to find the right one and this is it! It's sweet but not too sweet and it has that soft, warm, smooth texture. Everyone in my family loved it! I will make it again and again.

My husband (who does not like desserts) asks me to make this just about every week.  Every where I go, people are asking me to make this again.  I love it, and so does my family.  The only difference I make is that I only add 1/4 cups of water.  We did not like it so soupy.  Otherwise, thank you Diane!

However, I do suggest to put more cinnamon and less oats.

This recipe is amazingly good - not too sweet, just sweet enough - and my friends just loved it. I'm not an expert cook and I like things easy, this was just the right recipe for me! One detail : it says for 12 portions but I would say 10... Will definitely keep this one!

For some reason, the top of this recipe turned out a bit dry for me. But overall, it was delicious. I'll just have to make some modifications to avoid that in the future. But we added extra cinnamon for even more flavor.

This is a great and easy recipe!  It impressed my company and made the house smell heavenly.  The only thing i would changed in the recipe is to have cut the apples a little thicker for a more chunky texture.

This is what my husband had to say, "This stuff isn't just sort of good, it's incredible. I love it. I have not had apple crisp this good in 30 years."  
I did not have quick oats so I used regular oats and it came out great.

Just wanted to say this is a wonderful recipe. It was easy, fast and was gone faster then any other I have made. My family likes it so much I made it one weekend and the following weekend I made Four more. I gave one away (to my sisters family that says its better then grandma's), we kept one and froze the other two for later. Once again a GREAT recipe. Thanks alot.

Wow! What a great response from my co-workers on this dish! Three of them asked for the recipe. I found that it was easy to make and there was plenty for them to go back for seconds! Thanks for the great recipe.

My family and I loved this recipe!  My nephew (4 years old) keeps asking me to make more, he eats it by the bowl full.  Other people tell me it tastes like an apple pie without the pie.  I had it warmed up and put over vanilla ice cream and it was out of this world!

This was my first apple crisp attempt...I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, next time I am going
to try making it in a smaller dish so the portions are more substantial.  Very very very delicious. 
Will definately be making it again.  Goes great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Mmmmm! This was yummy.  I made it last night with apples I bought at a farmer's market yesterday morning.  Just the right amount of apples & cinnamon, and LOTS of crunching topping! (That's the best part!) The recipe says it makes 12 servings, but I think they would be fairly small.  The way we cut it, we got about 8 larger servings.  I will definitely be doing this one again while the apples are still in season.

Made it per the recipe. I will likely make it again but if so will eliminate the water. It was too watery, soupy. The taste was good, not too sweet. I used Fuji apples.  We didn’t have ice cream but it would definitely be good with it.

Followed the recipe to the tee- at 45 minutes bake time the apple crisp was very watery. Baked it much longer to try to get the texture thicker and condensed. It turned out okayish, but next time I would add little to no water.

Easy and delicious!! I cut the water in half and added a smidge of nutmeg to the sugar part. I served over ice cream to a party of 10 and it was a huge hit!

I doubled the topping as recommended by many reviews. Delicious.. Didn't have granny Smith apples so I used Fuji and three quarters cup sugar. It turned out great. I'll make this again.

This is a great Apple Crisp. The only thing I did different was used brown sugar instead of white and I used Honeycrisp apples. Loved it.

This is the best apple crisp recipe that I've made from Allrecipes. My wife and I thought it tasted like an apple pie. To ensure that the bottom didn't stick to the pan, I put parchment paper down first, and it meant we could scoop out every little bit.

This is overly sweet, especially the apple filling, as agreed by 3 adults and tweens at my house, but still good. Analyzing it, I decided that the crust is sweet enough to sweeten the apples below, as the sugar melts downwards. I have an almost identical recipe that is still our favorite, and it uses no sugar in the apple base. I like the crunchiness of this crust. If I make this again, I’d reduce the sugar on the apples to 1/4 cup or omit altogether.

My forever favorite recipe. 
I love that you have room to sort of play with it and make it to your own liking. I use a  combo of honeycrisp and sweetie apples (I like em SWEET!) Add a little nutmeg, and throw maybe a cup of pecans in the mix!! Highly recommend!!

Made this for my in laws. It was a huge hit! Some changes: 

My pan was a bit bigger so I used 10 large granny smith apples which turned out to be about 12-13 cups
1.5x the topping was great for this amount. 
I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (just not a big fan)
Tossed the apples in the mixture to evenly coat
1/4 cup water instead of 1/2c
It was looking dry in the middle near the end of baking, so I melted about 1/8c more butter and just sprinkled in the middle of the topping, broiled for 3 minutes at the end to make it crispier. 

Pretty much perfect. I don't think I'd make any changes for next time! Served with ice cream = amazing! :)

This is so good!  I added dried cranberries, pecans, walnuts and almonds and the result was a delicious dessert.  I also cooked it a little longer to make sure the apples was tender.  But this is a great dessert if your looking for something quick, easy and delicious try this.

Excellent if you like super sweet. I prefer a crumble that lets more of the apple flavor take center stage, so this wasnt my favorite. Especially if you serve it with ice cream, err on the side of cutting sugar by at least half, and use TART apples to help cut the cloying sweetness.

My changes
Use just a couple tbsp of cider or juice instead of water. Way too much water.
Double the butter, topping was too sandy and therefore not crumbly.

Used granny smiths, if using a less tart apple would definitely knock back the sugar in the filling.

So good! I didn’t use white sugar. Just drizzled maple syrup on the apples in the dish and used sucanat and brown sugar for the crumble. It was all the rage at my work Christmas party.

I made a half recipe in a 9x9 pan.  The water was a little too much.  Maybe I should have tossed the apples in a tsp of flour to thicken.  Also used dark brown sugar.  Very sweet.  May have been able to reduce sugars to 1/3 c of sugars.  But it was devoured quickly! Thanks

I thought this was delicious! My boyfriend thought thinks that we should do a layer of apples then a layer of crumb topping , apples again then crumb topping on top next time.  Needless to say we loved the crumb topping!! We also did the apple slices super thin which we liked. Thank you for sharing your recipe

Made this numerous times and it's consistently excellent! I like to use a mixture of apples for best taste and texture. Paula or Ida Reds combine well with Golden Delicious. I reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup when using sweeter apples like the Golden Delicious.  I always omit the water and I use apple pie spice instead of straight cinnamon. Sometimes I add a sprinkle of cardamom as well.  I also mix light and dark brown sugar (50/50) in the topping. All of these modifications add a nice extra depth to the flavor.

I added my own spin on this. Right before I put it in the oven I put a layer of brown sugar on top and more melted butter but with Carmel. Tonight's with be the same way except for tonight I added a table spoon of honey.

Made apple filling exactly as directed. I did make 1.5 of the topping for a little more crisp on top. It was delicious, even though it seemed like it had a lot of liquid in the bottom. I may leave out or half the water next time.  Even after the leftovers were sitting in the fridge for a few days, it was still great!

I used almond flour instead of all purpose and it came out great.  I brought it to a party and everyone said it was a hit.

I have made this recipe too many times to count! I really didn’t change a thing! I added less water depending on the type of apples I used but it comes out juicy and perfect each and every time!! Highly recommend!!

I had planned on doubling the topping since several other  commenters mentioned doing that, but 2 cups of oats, 2 cups of flour and 2 cups of brown sugar? That's more like an entire cake than topping. So I went with the original amounts, and it was more than enough to cover a 9x13 dish. It was still a bit too sweet for my tastes (and I did use granny smith apples). I didn't add water to the apples, and I tossed them in the sugar/flour mix. I might try adding water to the topping next time, as it seemed a bit dry to me. Overall, an easy, tasty treat.

I had to adjust to half recipe because I had 5-6 red delicious apples- slightly over ripened. So I followed recipe exactly for half measurements and it turned out delicious! I used steel cut oatmeal because that is all I had on hand. I had to use regular sugar for the topping but I only used about 1/4 cup and it is still

Excellent recipe. This recipe has become a huge favorite of our family. It turns out perfect every time. I have made this so many times I can practically make it without reading the recipe. If you are looking for a perfect Apple Crisp recipe this is the one!

Very good recipe. I took the advice of the other reviewers and omitted the water from the filling. I also doubled the topping. I used Granny Smith apples and left the peel on. I sliced them in my food processor which made them a perfect thickness. I agree with some others that the filling  was too sweet and next time I would cut the sugar on the apples to maybe 2/3 of a cup. Otherwise perfect!

This was such a hit after Thanksgiving dinner and a nice change to the "typical" apple pie. I put it in the oven when we sat down to dinner and it was done just in time when I served dessert!

Super easy and delicious. Next time I might chop the oats a bit more as they’re a bit too large for my liking (texture). But other than that, this is a keeper!

Great base recipe. I followed some previous comments and left out the water because my Granny Smith apples were super juicy. I added more cinnamon. Also, I added walnuts to the crumble.

I agree with other reviewers, just double the crumble using half on the bottom and the remainder on top. I also used the nutmeg suggestion. Our family absolutely loved this dessert.

I used 6 large Granny Smith. Squeezed a fresh lemon over cut apples. Made the crumble recipe from the Triple Berry Crisp which is very similar and already measured for top and bottom, but only use 1 C  butter  on that from previous experience and reviews.

Everything is perfect except one thing, take that one thing out and it's 5 Stars. Do not add the water. Instead mix in the sugar mixture and toss the apples till well coated. After that continue with topping and cook. The water made mine extremely runny. As the apples bake it should give you the moisture you need. Enjoy.

Good base recipe but as others suggested I cut the water in half  from 1/2 C to 1/4 C. I also added nutmeg to step 2 and mixed the nutmeg, flour, cinnamon, and sugar by hand into the apples for an even coating. I also doubled the crisp topping in step 3 and added chopped pecans as many others suggested. I felt melting the butter was unnecessary and just cut it into slices and mixed in with my hands. Overall it was fantastic served with vanilla ice cream and the crumble was perfect. However, the apple filling was  a bit too sweet. Next time I will try and half the white granulated sugar in step 2, it seemed like an excessive amount when I was mixing it in with the apple filling.

This is so delicious! I make it for every Fall/Winter big gathering. Like many others suggest - definitely do double topping. Also if you like less crispy, use Old Fashion Oats vs 1 Minute Oats. I sometimes like to do this with young kids. Also for a little extra sweet I add 2/3 cup of raisins - letting them soak in water for at least 5 minutes before adding to the apples pre topping.

Made changes. Only slightly melt the butter till softened (10-15 sec in microwave) if frozen. Is vital butter is not melted, but soft. If too melted, topping won’t be crumbly.
Add 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon into flour/brown sugar mixture and 1/4 tsp cloves as well as 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Since I added the pecans I also added an extra quarter cup of Softened butter. 
Came out perfect.  Was nice and crumbly.

After reading other reviews and adapting to my preference, the result was YUM!
Doubled the crumble and put a layer on bottom too.
Cut white sugar down to 3/4 cup (going to try 1/2 even next time).
Cut apples slightly larger for a firmer texture.
Added teaspoon of nutmeg to the apple topping.
Omitted the water all together! Sure it was accidental, but resulted in a  nice firm & crumbly texture yet still moist enough from the apples.
Turned the oven up to 400C the last 10 min for added crisp.

Excellent! I reduced the recipe by 1/2 and added 1/4 teaspoon each of cloves & nutmeg to the apples. I also added a pinch of salt to the crumb topping. This will be my go to recipe for apple crisp from now on!

One word:   AMAZING!   Next time may cut back sugar in apple filling a bit if using sweet apples.  Put cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg in both the apples and crust.

A great Apple crisp but like others, I doubled the topping! I also used less sugar—I just find most desserts too sweet. I probably used 1 1/3 c brown sugar in the doubled amount of topping, and 3/4 c on the apples. I also added nutmeg. Granny Smith’s were perfect in it. I baked it at 375 for 30 min, then 15 min at 350. I like the topping golden and well, crisp! Mmmm... A keeper!

Absolutely delicious. I used a little less apple (it was all I had) and added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Probably could’ve baked for a little less time, but it was really easy and delicious.

This was fantastic!! I did make a couple of changes other people mentioned. •First, I made it for a serving of 6 so I used 5 large Granny Smith apples in my 7x11 glass Pyrex. •Second, I used Monk fruit sweetener instead of typical white sugar, it’s lower on the glycemic spike and it’s a 1:1 measurement. •Third, I tossed the apples with the cinnamon and Monk fruit + nutmeg. •Fourth, I did not add any water and it was perfect.I followed the rest of the recipe, besides the butter I melted half way to mix and dab on top. Enjoy!

I added some vanilla to the after mixture. Extra cinnamon to the white sugar mixture and added cinnamon to the crumble recipe. We love cinnamon in our family, so we always go extra. Super easy and delicious recipe! Absolutely will make again!

This was the 3rd time making this and I hit it out of the park with this version. First, use Granny Smith apples & you’ll taste a marvelous blend of tart and sweet. I reduced water to 1/4 cup. Then I mixed all the dry ingredients, but instead of sprinkling over the apples, then dribbling the water, I poured the water into the dry ingredients & stirred till smooth. I then poured that over the apples & that’s how I’ll do it from now on. For the crumble, I did the recipe as is 1st time, &  doubled it, the 2nd time.  It was way too much crumble, and left you looking for the apples. So, I compromised. Where it called for 1 cup oats, I did 1 1/2, and Im telling you it was perfection! I did this with all the crumble ingredients & where it calls for 1/2 tsp I did 1/4 plus 1/8 tsps. It is the best recipe for apple crisp I’ve ever eaten even without the changes. But Making 1 1/2 times the crumble was perfect! Great recipe, thank you!

Delicious!!!  I doubled the crumble and halved the water like other reviewers suggested.  It was still too watery on the first day.  In the future, I would pat the apples dry and PEEL them before cooking.  But the flavor was great!  I used all Granny Smith apples so it wasn’t overly sweet.  I definitely recommend serving with vanilla ice cream, too!

I made this recipe without oats and I think I could of left out water for that reason.  Besides it being real watery it very delicious and I would definitely do it again and add oats or if I leave out oats again I'll try leaving out water.

I just made the Apple Crisp.I started before I came across this recipe.So I ended up making the topping.For the topping I used less than a cup of flour and oatmeal.I used two tablespoons brown sugar and less than a half a stick of butter.I mixed it up and it came out delicious.I gave this recipe three stars because I felt it told me to use too much sugar and flour for the topping.As For cooking my Apples I used three big red apples.I just boiled them in water and added the sugar Cinnamon and a little Nutmeg.I would prefer to use Red Apples because Granny Smiths are to tart.I made my dumplings also.Then I transferred them to a round baking dish where I had put a crust on the bottom.Next time I will use Pluckers Apple Liquor in my Apple crisp.That makes it really good.

Absolutely delicious.  I did use classic oats instead of quick oats, and they cooked up fine in the butter mixture, not too chewy.  My only qualm is that there was quite a bit of thin liquid in the bottom of the pan after cooking and cooling.  I ladled it up and drizzled it over the top, it seemed to absorb after that.

Excellent apple crisp!  Before making this I followed some of the reviewers’ suggestions and tweaked it just a bit.  I added the flour and sugar (used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar) to the sliced apples (8 Granny Smith apples), added cinnamon, freshly grated nutmeg, did NOT add water, but added a just a splash of apple moonshine (cider would be nice too).  I believe  that  the amount of water called for sounds like too much, and Granny Smith apples are pretty juicy.  I also added dried cranberries (Craisins) and let that sit while I made the crisp topping.  I doubled the topping recipe, also per the suggestions, but did not use all of it, a little too much to use for this recipe. I didn’t melt the butter but rather cut in into cubes.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg and a pinch of salt to the topping.  Mix together with a pastry blender or crumble it together with clean hands.  I set it all up in the morning separately- apple mixture in a 9X13 Pyrex dish, and topping mixture in a bowl, and put it in the fridge until I came home from work.  I agree with the suggestions, that 45 minutes was not enough, and increased the baking time to one hour @350.  Served it warm with both vanilla and Dulce de Leche Haagen Dazs ice cream.  Heavenly!  I might decrease the amount of sugar in the apple mixture next time, just to have more tangy apple flavor shine through.  Maybe add a splash of lemon juice too.   I would definitely recommend using Granny Smith apples, they’re perfect ba

so yummy! I used 1/4 c of water, as per suggested by other reviewers. I also used 5 large Granny Smiths and 2 Macintosh apples. I sliced them pretty thin so perhaps I'll make them a bit chunkier next time. I did double the crumb topping and put it in the fridge for about 15-20 mins before I added it on top of the apples and it came out perfect, it even stayed crumbley the next day! I did use a smidge less of the brown sugar than suggested. I gathered all these tips from other reviews, easily adjustable to your taste preferences.

I've made this several times. It is the best apple crisp I've ever had! The recipe calls for water and I've made it that way, but after reading the comments I cut the water in half and also tried no water. For me it tastes best with half the amount of water. My family loves it!

Quite sweet, even with half the sugar.  Substituted  for the oats, kamut crisp cereal. Why so much butter?   Is it really needed?

I LOVE this recipe I gave it four stars because the first I made it I used all the sugar indicated and it was too sweet. This time I added a quarter cup of white sugar to apples, no water and 3/4 cups of packed brown sugar to the topping. I also added nutmeg and allspice to the apples. Other than that this recipe is perfection

This was a Delicious recipe! 
I did however make the changes many others have made. I cut the sugar in half in both the apples and the topping. I did not add the water, and so thankful I didn't because it would have been a sad soupy mess. 
I also added extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg because I love the spice. Overall a very good starting point recipe for people to tweak to their taste!! Will make again today actually!!

I've tried a few different apple crisp recipes lately...This is my favorite.  Although I left out the baking soda and baking powder because I didn't want a cakey texture to the topping.  Very delicious!!

I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping and sugar/flour sprinkle mix. I also doubled the topping. Good recipe overall. Next time I will use half the sugar. This is delicious, but super sweet.

This was delicious.  My husband and I both loved it.  I followed a few of Allyson Hester's recommendations.  First, I tossed the apples (about 6-8 golden delicious) in cinnamon/brown sugar/nutmeg.  Secondly, I cut the water down to 1/4 cup.  It was still a little too soupy.  I might try 1/3 cup next time.  I will definitely make this again.

I used Gluten Free Flour ( Almond and Rice) and vegan margerine ( allergies in the family) and added lemon zest and Nutmeg to the filling. It was a huge hit!

- Use less sugar.
- Use 4 tbsps lemon juice, 1/4 cup water (instead of 1/2 cup 
  water). Adds flavour.

Very tasty, but MUCH too watery. I've never added water to an apple dish like this before, and it didn't  need it. Caused the topping to be less crunchy. Eliminate the water and it will be awesome!

My family LOVES this recipe!  The only thing I change is I DON'T add the water.  Not necessary at all.  We use all Macintosh apples with a couple of green apples thrown in for good measure. Being from New England, those are the apples everyone uses for pies and crisps in my area.  I also double the topping 'cause we all have a sweet tooth, and I only make this once maybe twice a year, so it's ok!  SOOOO GOOD!!

I loved this recipe!! I followed the directions exactly only I doubles the topping, because everyone knows deep down that’s the best part! My only critique is that I think it could have used more spices, maybe more cinnamon. Other than that it’s fabulous!

There were only 2 of us so I divided everything by 4 & made it using  ingredients as listed.  It had a nice crunch but was a little too sweet. I used golden delicious apples so maybe they added to the sweetness. Next time I will cut white sugar in half & use tart apples.

This was loved by everyone. Next time I will slice the apples thicker . Mine looked a little like applesauce but was still amazingly good. I did reduce the water to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the apples. This recipe will be on the Thanksgiving dessert menu  this year.

This has WAAAY too much sugar. Picked fresh apples and they probably barely needed any sugar. In the future I'd change to 2-3 Tbsp white sugar and maybe even cut down the brown sugar too.

Made this apple crumble because I had the munchies and was craving something freshly baked  this recipe was awesome, I used 3 very large pink lady apples cubed and peeled, I do prefer more crumble to apple plus all I had was 3 apples lol, I also added a little vanilla sugar to the mix as well. I did add the exactly amount of water if not a few drops more just to melt sugar and cinnamon at first and was a little more caramel-like once it came out of the oven. I cant wait to make this again for my family!

This is so good.  I made it last year also and found one reviewer saying to use less water so I did.  This batch was only 1/2 cup water and still a little more watery than I’d like.  Super sweet so you can cut out 1/2 the sugar also if you like.   It’s excellent with a creamy vanilla
 Ice cream on top!  Enjoy!

Yum! I used Honeycrisp apples (I read the reviews after buying them and many recommended Granny Smith, which I’m not a big fan of). After reading some reviews, I cut the white and brown sugars in half, used 2 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tbsp of vanilla on the apples before coating with the sugar mixture. I also added nutmeg to both the apple and oat mixtures. I *almost* doubled the oats but decided against it and am glad I did. This turned out perfectly!

This is definitely a go-to apple crisp recipe.  I doubled up on the crisp topping because, well, you can never have too much crumble.  Quick, easy, and a classic favorite.

I read the reviews before making this recipe so I made a few changes to it. I used Granny Smith apples, it helped with cutting sweetness. I added nutmeg to the apples. I also only used 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3tbsp of water and 3 tbsp of lemon juice in the apples also. I doubled the crisp recipe but, no other adjustments to it. My family loved it.

Absolutely Delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used Granny Smith apples, halved the water, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and doubled the topping.  Took to a fall cookout and it was gobbled up in minutes!  The tart apples baked perfectly into the sweetness.  So Yummy!

I followed the recipe to a "T" except the only apples I had in the house were Red Delicious and although others suggested not using them, this turned out absolutely scrumptious!! For me it could have used more crunch topping but I'm a crunchy kind of guy.

Great recipe, but you can definitely skip most of the white sugar for taste and health reasons. Don’t skimp on the brown sugar though. Also I substituted cider for water (only use 1/4 cup), and added nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Might add raisins, or use peaches when I make this again.

An uncommonly fine recipe for a common dessert, and a good way to use up an excess of apples. I followed some of the recommendations of other users skipped the water, doubled the topping and added pecans. WIll make this again.

Good stuff. I've made it a couple of times. My husband added pecans and a little bit of caramel apple dip this time, but it's awesome without it too.

I do cut the sugar a bit and double the "crisp." I prefer being able to taste the apples over the sugar. Some sugar is necessary to help make the crisp crispy, but it doesn't have to be exact.

It was tasty but adding the water was unneccessary. Ours came out almost completely submerged in water. The apples, when cooked, produce their own liquid so extra water isnt needed. If you leave that out, it's perfect.

I skipped the water (I think I've made this one before with the water). It is so good . I used about 15 small honey crisps that my family found too sour to eat fresh.  I also added about  a teaspoon of nutmeg.

Best Apple Crisp recipe I have made. Super easy and delicious! I added two tablespoons vanilla bean sugar (purchased at the spice store) to the crumble and it was a great addition.

Outstanding!  No water added but I did 2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla to the apples.  Doubled the topping as others suggested with a perfect result.  Thank you for my first (and only) apple crisp recipe!

This was a really good recipe! My only problem was that the crust on the top didn’t get crispy how I like it. So it felt kind of soggy maybe I will try it again.

I reduced the amount of water to 1/8 a cup, as the recipe called for way too much. I also reduced the sugar by 1/3 and increased the cinnamon by 50%. I substitute whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the all-purpose and increase the topping by 50%.

I only made half the apple recipe but did double the amount of topping (so what it called for). I used half the amount of sugar for the apples (1/4 cup) and half the amount of brown sugar for the topping (1/2 cup). I sprinkled water over my apples instead of the amount it called for. I also kneaded in softened butter (instead of melted) so the crisp was crispy. I forgot to add nutmeg to the apples so I sprinkled it on the crisp before I baked it.

Delicious!  Made it for bible study and there was only a tiny bit left afterwards. My husband isn’t an apple crisp fan and asked me to make it again.  It’s hard to stop eating. Put a little vanilla ice cream on top and it seals the deal!!

I followed the recipe and found that I agree with other reviewers about water. It’s not necessary.
It’s still yummy , but next time I will skip the water.

I made this with some small changes with some recommendations from the reviews. So I used Granny Smith apples, which I peeled and cored and left aside in a bowl with water. ( this is crucial because I saw there was many reviews that stated water was not necessary  and some said to reduce it) Then I made the apple mix with a 3/4 of a cup of white sugar and added nutmeg , cloves and cinnamon. Then for the topping, I doubled the recipe and added another half cup of oats (for crunchiness) and kept the brown sugar at 1 cup. I reduced the sugar because I felt like it was a lot and I wanted to taste the apples. So I baked it for 45 mins in a glass dish and it was perfect! The ratio between apples to topping was phenomenal and I felt like I made the right call reducing the sugar because it was just sweet enough with the extra topping. With the water that came from soaking , It was gooey with a pie like and almost caramel filling and I was very happy.

I love this recipe.  It is great when you do not have time to deal with making an apple pie but are looking for the same idea.  It is easy to make and the most time consuming part is cutting the skins off the apples.  I also doubled the crumb topping.  I use granny smith apples.  IT is a great contrast of sweet and sour meeting in the middle.  Thank you for posting this...made it many times and always enjoyed by everyone!

Agreed you do not need the water. I   added 1/4 cup and still was too much. Also this was way too sweet for our family, including my kids who said it was too sweet. I'd decrease the sugar in the apple mixture next time and decrease a tad amount in the topping as well.

I LOVED THIS so much. I did tweak it a little, I did not add water and I used a bit more cinnamon and added just a sprinkle of nutmeg to the crumble and it was divine! I would say for those who think this is to sweet - do some research on your apples, the apples that are sweet, cut some sugar but the apples that are tart you should use the amount listed in the recipe. It was a hit in my house and I have a bunch of picky eaters. I will certainly make it again ... and again!

I feel like we could have used less water because it was flowing around once the crisp was done and I felt like that was ruining the look. Tasted absolutely great though so I'm not sure if we can do without the water for next time...

Rating this recipe exactly as it is written, I'm not a fan. There is way too much sugar, definitely should have halfed it. I also thought it was weird that the directions said to melt the butter which I then did to give it a try, but the top wasn't crispy at all.  So definitely half the sugar, and don't melt the butter. Just use cold butter & cut it into the mixture.

Delicious!  Everyone in the family loved it.  I liked the fact that the recipe made a 9 x 13 pan.  Most recipes are for an 8 x 8 and you have to adjust to make it bigger.... no guessing!  If I had to say anything it would be that maybe could cut back on the sugar just a bit.

Delicious!
My apples were a little tart so after I put the apples in the pan, I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top and then stirred it in. The only other change I made was to use apple juice concentrate instead of water.
I will definitely make this again, and again!!

I loved it. Ive made it several times. Dont skip the water. My apples get too dried out and wont even soften without it. I opted for only brown sugar and allot more cinnamon. Plus a double batch of topping. Yum

This made the most delicious apple crisp! The people who left negative reviews had to have done something wrong, and those calling it apple mush should try it again with a more firm apple and no water. I will say however that the water has no reason to be in this recipe, the apples release PLENTY of liquid as they macerate during the bake. I omitted the water, baking soda, and baking powder, and  I used half gala and half fuji apples plus added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping. For an even distribution, I tossed the apples with the cinnamon, flour, sugar, and a bit of vanilla in a bowl to coat and then poured it in the baking dish. It was phenomenal! This is such an easy, quick recipe, the hardest part is peeling and chopping the apples but anyone adept with a veggie peeler and a knife can knock it out quickly.

I made it exactly as described and while it was very good, it was way too sweet for my taste. Next time, I will cut the white sugar down 1/2 a cup, add nutmeg, and use only 1/2 cup of water. Other than that, it was yum!

Everyone loved!  I used Granny Smith apples and it was not too sweet.  I did reduce the water to 1/4 cup but probably didn't need to.  I also doubled the topping.  The only thing I will do different next time is add more apples.   Very good!!!

I'm definitely planning on making this again! I made this recipe as a surprise for my boyfriend when he was coming to visit me since this was his favorite dessert growing up. I took some advice from other reviewers about adding less than 1/2 a cup of water to the apples which I think helped a lot. I also didn't have quick oats, because I like my old fashioned for breakfast, so I used my blender to do five pulses so they could be as quick to cook as quick oats also. I also added a tiny bit of cinnamon to the top covering as well.

I will say, if you don't like overly sweet desserts AND plan on having this with ice cream, do a little less sugar because for me, it borders on too sweet and I have a big sweet tooth.

Otherwise, loved this more than store bought apple pie!

I chose to leave out the  Baking soda and baking powder from the topping it was just as yummy!

I used 10 Granny Smith apples per recipe, which is actually about 11 cups of apples.  It  gives it a better  apple foundation Slice the apples fairly thin.

Use the water it calls for !!!

It was very good.  And because the recipe uses melted butter instead of needing to cut it into the mixture makes it so much easier to make the topping.??.   I’ve made other recipes but my husband likes this one the best.

I have tried a few apple crisp recipes this summer with apples from our tree. This is the new family favorite. Very easy to make and doesn't last long.

Great recipe for granny smith apples! Crunchy, sweet, and delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

I cut down on the sugar and it was still so sweet it just about hurt my teeth. My hubby, the sugar fiend, liked it alright. I'd never added water to a crumble before and I never will again - it basically turned into applesauce with crumble on top. I guess it might have a lot to do with what sort of apples you're using.

Was very good and tasty. I did make it with apples that I had picked and frozen  from the previous year. Made sure that  I drained the liquid off but did save it to use if needed. Cut the white sugar in half and added just a bit more flour to the apples to prevent to much liquid while cooking. Will definitely make again and looking forward to using fresh apples this time.

First of all, this was amazing. I made it for my family just for fun and they all loved it. We had it fresh out of the oven and it was delicious. I didn't measure the apples, we just put them on the pan until they covered the bottom then put some more. I put a little more cinnamon, but they are loved. Will definitely make again.

Watery at the bottom. I only used 8 cups of apples for my 9x13 pan and the apple layer was even with the top layer. I really would have liked a thicker crust on top. Might have used a little less than a cup of brown sugar just because it was all I had. Tasted great!

Added the 1 Tsp of salt the OP left out, and it was delicious!  I used Gala apples, and, though they were a little elderly, they had the perfect texture and sweetness.

This was delish. I used truvia baking blend instead of white sugar, but i agree with others it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I'd half both white and brown sugar next time.

Great recipe. We usually do 6 apples in a 9x9 with half the filling, but keep the topping equal to the whole recipe.

Absolutely yummy! So easy and only 1 tweek  - I omitted the water. I used Granny Smith apples but any tart apple will work best, otherwise it'll be too sweet and you'll have to cut the sugar. I also doubled the topping, as some other reviewers, but that is a matter personal preference of whether you want it to be more topping or more apples.  Another reviewers tip on making the topping, pressing down into a bowl and letting the butter cool and go back to a hardened state to get better balls of the crumbs was an excellent tip and it worked for me perfectly. I will definitely be making this again!

This was good.  May have been better if I hadn't had two glasses of wine and then decided to make it.  Didn't notice that the melted butter was supposed to be mixed in to the dry ingredients,  but then I had to just pour over the top.  Maybe I will try without the wine next time.

Yummy! As I get older, I lose my sweet tooth, though. Next time I’ll half the sugar, double the crumble. Also tossed in cloves, ginger, and nutmeg! Topped with ice cream is perfect.

Used frozen honey crisp apples from our tree!  Doubled the topping as others did to make a top and bottom crust. Eliminated the water as I used the apples frozen so they have water already in them. Yummy!

The only change I made was to use 1/4 C. of water, instead of 1/2 C.  It was very yummy.  Took it to an Easter gathering; everyone loved it!

REALLY GOOD. Almost too good. :) Rated 4/5 because there are TWO types of sugar white and brown. It's a lot and note 316 calories per serving so it's a little on the heavier side but Lord it is incredible. If you can manage your portion and be mindful of the excess sugar you'll love it.

Made this for a Sunday potluck and everyone liked it. It was served warm with vanilla ice cream. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and used less water and doubled the topping.  I thought it was awfully sweet and I would cut back on the sugar next time or maybe not double up on the topping.

Man, I hate being the bad guy but I was not impressed. I don't know what type of apples the "all purpose apples" in the recipe refers to but i used 3 large granny smith and about 8 galas because that's what i had. Followed the recipe exactly, though I only used 1/4C water (I have never added water before so I halved it, and should have listened to my instincts and not aded any) and wound up with a LOT of water/juice on the bottom. I know it depends on what apples you use, so the recipe should be more specific. Way too sweet with all that sugar, and the topping/crisp.....never crisped. I saw reviews stating that was an issue, so decided not to melt the butter but only soften it, then chill the topping while I finished making the rest of the recipe. It was a firm topping, but not crispy. Wish I could give a better review, but as a baker, I can't give this more than 2 stars.

It was pretty good I did everything but cause everything is too sweet instead of water I used a lime or lemon. To bring back tartness and give flavor and a bit of demension giving the green apples the shine. Used 8 apples.  A sprinkle of  a water cause it was a tad dry with my apples. Used the extra sauce to top off all my apples.

Delicious! The only change I made is adding a LOT more cinnamon to the apples (1 tsp was hard to taste at all, I went for 2 tbsp), as well as adding cinnamon to the crumbly topping (2 tsp). We love cinnamon so it’s just personal preference! Only other thing was that we found it a bit runny/watery so next time I would add more thickener (maybe a cornstarch slurry).

This is the best apple crisp I've ever made! This is now my go to recipe for anything apple. I am a big fan of apple pie, but find it tiresome to make, so I turned to apple crisp. I wouldn't add anything to this recipe because it's absolutely perfect. I'm only a teenager, but my family says they've never had a better apple dessert, and I wouldn't turn to any other recipe. It's SOOO delicious! The first time I made this, I was unsure because it seemed as if there was too many oats and not enough cinnamon, but I promise, this recipe is absolutely perfect. Also, there's no need to grease the pan because the apples won't stick to anything.

I doubled the crust recipe and added it to the bottom of the pan (loosely, not packed and not edge to edge). 

I used gala apples, halved the sugar and water. 

Added the white sugar, a little flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the apples. I poured the remaining water over the apples after I put them in the pan. 

They turned out really good! I had enough to make 2 8x8 pans (light topping) and 12 muffins! 

The muffins are fun. Crust top and bottom with apples in the center. What a treat!!! I used muffin liners and sprayed them (and the pans), so the crust cane off super easily. I wish I’d made more muffins. They cooked in about 25 mins.

Followed it exactly and it was way too sweet! The sugar was so much, I couldn't enjoy the apples. Half the sugar next time and also omit the water. It was too watery. I've never made it with water before and I think it turns out crispier and not soggy without the water.

Excellent crisp! I halved the recipe and cut back by about 1/3 of the sugar (used all brown) in both the apples and topping.  Skipped the water altogether.  I added a few handfuls of raisins to the apples (really liked that) and about 1 tsp of vanilla. Instead of melting the butter, I used a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the topping mixture. I've made a few crisps lately (with melted butter), and this one was the only one that actually had a 'crisp' topping (maybe that's why). I also added some nutmeg to the topping (not a big fan, but it worked great here) and some cinnamon. Cooking time of 45 min was spot-on. Nothing better than this with some good quality vanilla ice cream! Thanks for the beginning of a keeper recipe, Diane!

I really like this simple dish. My 12 year old was able to make it for the family. For me it was just a little too sweet so next time around I will use a little less sugar. It had my daughter excited to be in the kitchen and feel more excited that everyone enjoyed it

it is very good.  I used Honey Crisp apples and followed the recipe with no changes.  When the crisp came out the apples still had a tiny bite to them and did not go soft however we all found this recipe too sweet.  Next time I use honey crisp apples I will reduce the sugar significantly, but if using a tart apple like a granny smith it would probably be spot on.  also I think a lot of the sweetness comes from the topping.

This is our go-to apple crisp recipe!! 
We've found we don't need to add the water, just leave it out completely.

Add a tablespoon or two of lemon juice to the half cup of water. Lemon juice should be added to apple pie filling at all times.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I found that after 45 minutes, the apples were not fully cooked through. Also, so much water that once you got through the crisp, the base was soggy and swimming in liquid.  Wasn’t a fan.

Loved the taste. I had no flour, so substituted ground rolled oats instead. Good substitute.  End result was too watery , but I had soaked my apples in water first so they wouldn’t turn brown. Next time, I wouldn’t add the 1/2 cup of water, but would definitely make again. Thank you.

I make  it in lieu of creating apple pies.  As I am not skilled in  pie crusts, this great and easy recipe is delicious and just as satisfying with the Granny Smiths. oatmeal and butter combo.  My family and guests have never been disappointed when I pull this hot out of the oven and serve with vanilla ice cream and a cuppa!

I followed the recipe using 8 large Granny Smith apples peeled, cored and cubed. I also used 1/2 the white sugar  sprinkled on the apples as suggested. I divided mixture between 8 small glass baking dishes and baked for 1 hr. There was no need to double the topping. The crisp was delicious and crispy, and had just the right degree of sweetness. Will definitely make again.

After reading reviews I made couple of changes as I don’t like overly sweet desserts, but had a bunch of apples to use up. used red delicious so cut my white sugar to only quarter of cup, cut my brown sugar to half a cup, added tsp of nutmeg and halved the water.  Was delicious

A bit too sweet for my taste. Also, it could use a pinch of salt, both in the apples and topping. Otherwise, the kids loved it.

Mmm, nothing like a good apple crisp for the chilly autumn and winter nights. This was so easy to follow, I made hardly any changes. I used Granny Smith apples, as they are perfect for baking and not too sweet, peeled and cored. I used less water (maybe a tablespoon?) since the apples were pretty juicy and I didn't want it to be too saucy, and I added a little nutmeg to the mixture with the apples, but other than that I made this as written!  Took it to an office potluck, served with vanilla ice cream, NO leftovers!

I guess it was ok I made it in two patches served the smaller one with no ice cream and it felt really not complete and kept the larger one (in picture) for a special gathering I think ice cream is a must you can’t serve it alone hence the 3 stars

I used humongous Honey Crisp apples (5 peeled and sliced filled up my 9x13-inch glass dish. Tastes WONDERFUL! Didn’t change/add anything. Next time I may try adding a touch of brandy once I learn the ratio.

I made it.  Quick and easy recipe, but WAAAAY too much sugar.  I forgot the water, but that didn't seem to affect the outcome.   I used Braeburn apples from the yard, but next time I will use a more tart apple like Granny Smith (but still cut the sugar by half).  We don't normally eat much sugar so perhaps we were sensitive.   My wife stopped after one bite.  I plowed through 4 bites.  At least i used up the last of this year's apples.

I made the recipe as presented once and another time accidentally forgetting the brown sugar. Both times my daughter, son in law and granddaughter and myself absolutely loved this recipe! I used a mix of soft and firm fleshed various varieties of fresh apples. This recipe beats my old standby apple crisp recipe hands down. It is officially going in our family favourites recipe box.

I’ve been using this recipe for a few years now. It is usually wonderful. I made it at thanksgiving and it was perfect. I just made it again for a work Christmas party and it was like soup. When I was baking it last night I thought 1/2 cup of water was more that I remembered adding last time but I went with it because I can’t trust my memory. It was WAY too much liquid. Did the recipe get changed? I don’t know for sure what went wrong, but next time I will add less water. The apples make liquid as they cook so 1/2 cup is too much. Maybe it’s because I made it the night before? At thanksgiving we ate it the same day. Very disappointed with this batch. But I still give it 5 stars because it is usually great.

I don't know why you need to add baking powder and baking soda - but it works.  I like to but the crisp under the broiler for the last couple of minutes to give the topping a brown. I'll be using this often

Quite easy to make and very good.  I typically cut it in half for a smaller group and don't use nearly that much water or cook it for that long.  Nice to have apples with a little texture rather than on the mushy side.

I made this with Gala & Granny Smith and added Frozen Blueberries & Tart Cherries (thawed & drained), and the juice and zest of half a Fresh Lemon.
Still really sweet so serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
Delicious!

Practically fool-proof, inexpensive and delicious. I've made this several times and it's always a hit. I end up emailing the recipe to everyone. 

I used Granny Smith apples, they're usually cheaper and have a nice tartness which contrasts with the sweetness. (The precise amount of apples doesn't really matter. The recipe turns out great whether you're a bit over or under. I prefer under because I love more struesel).

 I used Apple cider instead of water, because I had leftover in the fridge. I also used regular whole oats instead of quick (I prefer the texture with regular oats, but you won't go wrong either way).

I use Saigon cinnamon, it has more oomph and it smells Amazing. Usually easy to find in any spice shop or where bulk spice is sold. It's my "secret" ingredient for most of my holiday baking. 

If the top starts getting too brown, just throw a piece of tinfoil over it.  Check it with about 10-15 minutes to go. 

The filling thickens as it cools...so if you can, let it have some time to cool on the countertop before serving. 

Yes, you could add pecans or walnuts but then the nut allergy people can't have any, you increase the cost and it really doesn't need it. 

Make sure you slice rather than chop the apples. They release their juices faster and cook more evenly.

Rave reviews from family.  Use 1/2 cup sugar, not 1 cup.  Also, use an equal number of tart and sweet apples, such as Granny Smith and Pink Lady.

It was VERY good but it definitely was VERY sweet.  I think next time I will do about 3/4 of the topping.   I also think this would taste amazing with cranberries added.

Hands down the best apple crisp recipe, been making this one forever. I use granysmith and honey-crisp for this and always double the topping (that’s the best part) in a 9/13 dish. The last 3-4 minutes of baking I put 6 lil pats of butter along the top.

The only difference is, the last  of ingredients I mixed together with my Kitchenaide and I added in about a cup of chopped walnuts,  THEN I added it to the dish. Before baking I also gave it a "dash" of Nutmeg over the top.

I make this in large batches & serve it at my firehouse bingo nights.  It goes fast & keep getting told it's the best they've every had.  I also substitute Splenda for the sugar & use splenda brown sugar in the topping for my diabetic customers.  No one can tell the difference.

Mine needed a bit longer cooking time with the granny smith apples.  Did the crust on the bottom and the top. Was nice.

Came out great. But use only half the sugar it calls for in the recipe, otherwise it will be too sweet.

I've made this twice, and it was amazing both times. I make a smaller dish (8x8) for our small family.  I used six apples total (I like to use at least two different types of apples when I can), and then sprinkled the cut apples with a little lemon juice.  I double the cinnamon.  Skip the water; the apples will supply the juice as it bakes.  I make the full amount of topping, and bake for 45 minutes.  Autumnal perfection! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Delicious, fast and easy to make (except for prepping the apples).
After looking at some reviews, I omitted the water.
 I did not double the topping because I used about 7 large baking apples (different kinds- we went apple picking).
I substituted the melted butter in the topping with coconut oil and helped my 2 year old mix up the crumble topping with her hands. 
I usually like coconut oil butter substitution, but feel as if butter would have probably worked better in this case.

When it first came out of the oven, the sides were bubbling a bit. The oatmeal on top was still a bit uncooked and the apples were very soupy and over it was sickeningly sweet. I instantly regretted using the full amount of sugar and glad to have omitted the water. 

As it cooled, the oatmeal began to absorb the liquid, and this also led to the super sweetness being dampened.

Next time, I will omit the water, use butter, and about 2/3 - 3/4 the amount of sugar.

Instead of water, I use bourbon or whiskey. Amazing. I also use coconut sugar instead of white sugar on the apples. Gives a great depth of flavor!

My first time making this! I just got an apple peeler/corer and just happened to have a ton of apples of varying types laying around. So super easy, my 11 yr old daughter, husband and I all had a hand in making it, smells amazing!

I've made this recipe twice.  The key is to use tart apples, like Granny Smiths. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out a bit sweet for my taste - and I have a sweet tooth.  The second time I made it, I used half the white sugar and a bit more cinnamon, and the sweet/tart ratio was right on the money.  I tossed the apple slices in the sugar/spice mixture to ensure even distribution, which is an important step.  The family raved over this, and this is my go-to apple crisp recipe for those cool fall afternoons.  Excellent!

Used Honeycrisp apples and tossed in about a cup of chopped rhubarb that I had in the fridge for tartness, came out really good, and everyone raved about the crunchy  topping. I did use brown sugar instead of white as others suggested, for a bit richer flavor. Will be adding to my recipe box , as its a perfect fall dessert.

Received rave reviews!  Like many others I used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the apple mixture.  I also used half Granny Smith and half Honey Crisp apples so water was not needed.  I also doubled the topping based on the suggestions of others. Perfect!

I made this tonight and it’s sooo good. My apples were a little over cooked (I like some bite to them), but I’m going to credit that to me being a horrible baker and not the recipe. Next time - and there will be a next time - I’ll chunk the apples into bigger pieces. Otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing.

I made this recipe tonight and it turned out well.  I used a little sweeter apple, so next time I will definitely leave out the water, it is funnier than I would like, but the taste is excellent.  I will also double the crumble part to have the crust thicker.

i hate altering recipes but when so many people say the same thing i go with it. half the water. double the crisp. 1 tspn vanilla. i use organic cane and brown sugar so it’s more coarse. i like the added crisp it gives. also cut my slices in half for better toddler consumption. no runny juices right out of oven. very very very yummy. even with out the ice cream.

This  dish was wonderful. I used half the apples and followed the rest of the recipe as written. I baked it in a 8 x 8 for 42 minutes. Easy to prepare and tasty. Will make again.

This recipe is delicious. I halved it to make a smaller amount but otherwise no changes. I could see next time using less sugar, but I also just used the apples I had in the house (gala) so that may have contributed to the sweetness.

Delicious! I scaled this down to 2 servings, which was perfect for just me and my husband. Will definitely make again! Thanks.

OK but too sweet for me. I used Granny Smith apples.  If I make again I will probably add 1/4 tsp of salt to the topping to see if it balances all the sugar

Excellent. I used a combo of large diced Granny Smith ad Honey Crisp apples. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. And substituted apple cider as another reviewer suggested. Will definitely make again!

I made in an 8x8 baking dish, using a mix of macs, honey crisp and granny smith (5 apples) and then basically  followed the recipe quantities,  using a 1/4 cup of apple cider instead of water and included nutmeg as suggested by others. Also I didn't melt the butter as someone suggested, instead I mixed it until it was incorporated and crumbly. Wow, was this ever good, I'm going to make this again and again.

Topping was fantastic!  A little sweet but I like it that way.  You could probably cut back on the brown sugar by a 1/4 cup if you prefer less sweet.

This came out really good, I made with a mix of local honeycrisps and macouns. I usually find that many desert recipes are too sweet, so I use less sugar and still found it a bit sweet. The texture came out great, kind of creamy and buttery. I will make this again as everyone loved it.

Tasted ok but there was a lot of liquid left at the bottom  of the pan.  Was hoping because it's high ratings it would taste and come out better.  Not gonna use this recipe again.

Delicious...perfect recipe to welcome in Autumn! I made this exactly as directed , well almost,  did cut the sugar to 3/4 cup but only because that’s all I had on hand and it was perfection! 
I used 4 large Granny Smiths and 1 large Fuji, great combination of both flavor and texture. Thank you so much for sharing... will definitely be making again ??

I've been making the same crisp for years and decided to try a new recipe - so glad I did!  This was a big hit at book club and with the family when I brought leftovers home.  I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the topping (then chilled it while I was slicing the apples), added some nutmeg, and reduced the water to 1/4 cup.  I think  next time I will add 3-4 more apples because with the doubled topping it could have used them.  This is a winner!!

Close but no cigar. First, there is WAY too much sugar mixed with the apples. I use 1/3 of a cup. I also skip the water. With the apples I do not mix flour. Instead I use 2 teaspoons of corn starch. For the topping, double everything but skip the baking powder. Do NOT use melted butter. Instead, use room temperature. This revised recipe has pleased hundreds of thousands of people at fairs all over New England. Serve with a high fat vanilla ice cream! I prefer Macintosh apples. So close to being great but in the end this recipe is WAY to sweet and falls apart too easily to due the water.

This apple crisp recipe was a huge hit with the family. I cut down a bit on the cinnamon and added just a bit of nutmeg.  I’d share a picture but it came out of the oven and was GONE!

I used Jonathan apples as they are my favorite baking apple and tossed them with the flour, sugar, cinnamon and some nutmeg - no water. I also made extra topping. Syrupy apples, crispy topping and super yummy!

I also used cold butter instead of melted plus added some to the apple mixture.  I tossed the apples in the sugars (half white/half brown sugar unintentionally!) and cinnamon.  I reduced the recipe to 4 servings (thank you for that option!). There is just my husband and I and, trust me, we would eat the whole pan!  This is my husband’s favorite dessert, and he said it was perfect.  A keeper!

Made exactly by recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I was surprised that even my extremely picky daughter loved it!   I agree with how sweet it is that’s why Granny Smith apples work the best to offset the sweetness 
I cooked for 45 min.  Next time I’d cut it down to about 35 min just bc the bottom crumble candied a bit at the corners.

I made this with gluten free flour and it turned out great. I made it for a party and no one knew it was gluten free or asked about it. I did double the topping and added a pinch of nutmeg as others had suggested. I also used 1/4 water, and used fresh picked apples. I believe they were red delicious and since some had warned about the sweetness, I added a little less sugar to the apples. It was great with vanilla ice cream!

So so good! Left the water amount as the recipe stated but doubled the topping. We used three kinds of apples, Rome, Jonathan and honeycrisp. So delish!!

absolutely delicious! I took another's advice and reduce the water to 1/4 cup I also doubled up the crumble so there was a crumble on the top and the bottom. I also cut in the butter, rather than melting it & turned out amazing! I also added way more cinnamon than it probably calls for it but that's just preference. I absolutely love cinnamon-lol

Doubled the topping as suggested in comments. Used gala apples (about 12-13).  Added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the apples. Used 3/4 cup of sugar in that mixture. 
 Next time use less sugar on the apples.  Very sweet.

This was a huge hit with ice cream at Zion tonight, the Sabbath. I added nutmeg to the apples and used less sugar and water. I doubled the topping as some suggested. Turn out great, I was order to make this again lol. Great recipe!

I have made this ever year for the past 5 years and you would think I would remember not to add the water! I use picked apples from the orchard down the street and they are juicy enough! I would not add any of the water if you are using very ripe apples or picked from an orchard. It comes out like soup. But still very delicious!

I’ve made this apple crisp twice now. The first time I followed the directions exactly with the exception of adding water. Other reviews recommended leaving the water out and I’m glad I did. It doesn’t need it. It was good but way too sweet. Even my kids thought there was too much sugar. I made it again with 1/2 of the white and brown sugar and it was much better.

It turnout really good as far as flavor. I blame myself for adding more water than someone else posted. I also believe I sliced the apples to thin. It tastes awesome. I didn’t have any oats but had a box of honey bunches of oats...Worked great!

Delicious and easy. I used honey crisp apples. I halved the recipe, cut the white sugar (could have cut more), gave a squeeze of lemon, and grated some nutmeg as one reviewer suggested.

This is my first time making this recipe, and my first time posting a review on allrecipes (because it was THAT good!). I gave it 5 stars despite the fact that I made minor tweaks for my taste palette I didnt stray very far from the actual recipe so I can still say my rating is accurate. As fall is in full swing I've had a hankering for a great cinnamon apple recipe and I landed here! I used 5 big honeycrisp apples--my favorite for snacking as well as baking because they are juicy and tart but have a slight sweetness to them that are perfect. For the apple mixture I used half white and half brown sugar and added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and tossed the apples to coat them evenly. Using 5 apples instead of ten left a lot of great sugary syrup that allowed me to omit most of the water, I only poured a tiny bit over the apples to moisten them. I doubled the topping because I like a more crust-to-fruit ratio and added a tsp of vanilla to that mixture as well. I crumbled the topping but then gently patted it down to level it and make it so it will hold when cut into squares. Lastly I drizzled some caramel syrup over it when cooled and although I'm waiting to eat dinner so I can have a piece with ice cream, I had to taste test a corner of it and it was so perfectly delicious! The sugar/apple/crumble ratio is perfect and its sweet enough without being bland but not overpowering to the apples. This will be heavenly with ice cream, thank you for the great recipe!!!

I really enjoyed it. However I used honey crisp apples. The only thing I did was take some of the sugar. Since you use regular and brown sugar I toolk away about 1/4of the white sugar out.  The honey crisp are very sweet. It was delicious.

This is so good and so easy to make. My husband's family always requests it for family get togethers. It's the perfect apple to crisp combination. I  omit the water as other reviews have suggested.

Since I used gala apples, I put a little less white sugar. I was also afraid of it being too watery like how others said theirs turned out, so I sprinkled a little bit of flour on the apples after putting the water in. When I baked it, I covered it with foil, then uncovered it the last 6 minutes of bake time.

This was my first time making this, I was so happy with how it turned out. I loved it, and my family enjoyed it was well. I'm definitely keeping this recipe. Thank you for sharing it!!

It turned out great.  I followed the suggestion of cutting the water in half.   I did not want to double the topping so increased it by 1/2 and cut the sugar with the apples to 3/4 cup.  Once the topping was on I also sprinkled more cinnamon on it.  Not sure it impacted the flavor much but it filled the kitchen with that wonderful smell.

After reading the reviews, I used Granny Smith apples, made 1 1/2 times the topping, and chilled the topping before adding it to the apple mixture - all good tips! My guests loved this, and the leftovers were even better the next day. Great recipe!

Bomb dot com. Followed others advice and used 1/4 cup water, not half cup. Added some nutmeg to the apples. Made 2 portions of the crumble, put half on the bottom of the pan, and half on top of the apples. Superb.

Basically followed recipe. Just tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and added a little vanilla. Way too sweet in my opinion. Next time will way back on the sugar. Other than that it was good and easy to make.

I have never rated a recipe before, but I LOVE to cook and doctor recipes to my taste. I made this recipe and used so many apples, which are expensive. I have to say this recipe is so overly sweet it's almost uneatable. I can't believe so many people have given it such high ratings. I would make this again, but change it so much that it's not even the same recipe. I increased the crumble to 1.5 measurements. if I made it again I would use less sweet apples. I would reduce the white sugar to 1/4 cup, and possibly reduce the brown sugar too (but I'm not sure the crumble is the problem - I did add some old fashion oats for more texture). I would not use 1/2 cup water, maybe 2 tablespoons. I know there are other changes I would make to make this recipe worth making and eating, and also worth share, but without the changes I would be embarrassed to serve to it others. I want my creations to turn out perfect when serving to others.

Helpful tips: 1. Heat the butter to soften, not melt (30 seconds). 2. Reduce sugar on apples to 1/2 cup if using both tart and sweet variety. 3. Add juice of 1/2 a lemon to apples. 4. Refrigerate topping mix until butter hardens (30 min). PERFECTION! Crispiest I've ever had.

The 2nd time I made this, I used only a 1/4 cup of sugar on the apples (I always use an assortment). I was feeling adventurous so I used 1/2 all purpose flour + 1/2 whole wheat flour - could taste no difference. If you like more spice and more flavor, try adding a tsp of pumpkin spice in addition to a tsp of cinnamon. This is such a forgiving recipe!!!

This recipe was so delicious! I loved the flavor and the crunchy oat topping! I did add a few dashes of nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also needed a bit of a larger batch so I made this recipe plus 1/2 then doubled the topping recipe. It was completely awesome.

Absolutely delicious! Yum!  I made a few minor changes: used half the sugar on the apples, used ~2tsp cinnamon, added 2tsp vanilla, used 1/4 cup flowers. Next time I’d also cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Sooooo good, esp with vanilla ice cream!

The taste is great but it was extremely watery. I was suspicious to put 1/2 cup of water in but thought I should follow the recipe since it’s rated so well. Maybe the fresh apples from the orchard were very juicy, I’m not sure, but next time I make this I will not add water.

Very good,  but maybe a little too sweet. At least for my liking. So perhaps I will lower the sugar amount next time

I used Macintosh and cortland apples and it came out with to much liquid, next time if I used these apples I would omit the added 1/2 C water

This is fantastic... really good! I had to bake mine longer (probably because it the type apples I used), but it came out beautifully. Definitely a keeper! (btw... I also left out the water)

If I made it again, I'd use Macintosh apples.  My family doesn't like "chewy" apples (I used Granny Smith as suggested).  It was good though!

Delicious! This is the first time I ever made apple crisp without walnuts, salt, or lemon juice so I was kinda worried but this recipe rocks! I had to cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us. I tossed the apples in the sugar, flour, cinnamon mixture before putting them in the pan and I had to cook it for 60 minutes to get the apples cooked. I like them still to have some crispness but not be crunchy.  This is a dynamite recipe.  If you use a sweeter apple like I did you can reduce the sugar by a little. I will definitely make this again.

Everyone loved this. I also doubled the crust (except the brown sugar since I felt I already added a TON of sugar, plus the apples are already sweet - I used gala). Also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as some other suggested. I got a lot of people asking me for this recipe!

Used Honey Crisp apples, left out the water and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Tossed apples, flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg before spreading in baking dish.  Doubled the topping and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Needed to cook for about 55 minutes in my oven.  Served it with warm, homemade caramel sauce and ice cream.  Best apple crisp I have ever made - my compliments to Diane Kester!!!

Best ever.  This is great as written but we like cinnamon. Addition of some King Arthur Vietnamese cinnamon, an especially flavorful cinnamon to both the apple and the topping pushed this way over the top.

This was very good made as written.  My apples were fresh picked so the water in the recipe was just fine (other reviews say the water is too much, but I think a lot depends on the apples you use--know your ingredients).  The only thing I would do differently is cut down on the sugar.  Its sweet, and a little more tart from the apples would be healthier and taste just as good.

I used Granny Smith apples (green apples) and the crisp turned out almost perfect.  Next time I would decrease the white sugar by 1/4 cup because it was just a touch too sweet.

Definitely need to use a harder tart apple for this recipe.  A soft sweet apple like Macintosh, Red Delicious or Gala would be too sweet and would become mushy.

Do not add water, I also added about a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg to the apple mixture.  I used 20 oz. apples up here in NY, they were nice and tart to balance out the white and brown sugar in the recipe.  I also dotted the top of the apples with real butter before adding the crumb mixture.

Wonderfully delicious recipe! I made for a women’s group I’m in and they all loved it! I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the apple mixture as recommended by a few reviewers, and I did stir the apples in the sugar/spice mixture to coat them instead of sprinkling on top. I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and it was perfect! Used all Granny Smith apples and they did excellent! I doubled the topping as suggested, but it was too much so next time I’ll do 1&1/2 instead of double! Served with scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top!

Yes, I made changes. I only added a sprinkling of sugar on the apples. I used less brown sugar too.

Apple crisp is a staple and this recipe certainly hit the spot.  I don't like chunks of under-cooked apples so I sliced them thinly.   I added an extra 1/3 of topping because, well, it's the best part of an apple crisp!  I did find it a tad sweet even tough I used granny smith apples.  I think I'll reduce the sugar a bit next time.

I have made this delicious recipe many times and people always rave about it. . These are the changes that I have found work best:

I cook the apples before in a pot. I always use Granny Smith as their tartness works best for these type of desserts. I do not add sugar to the apples because the crumble part is sweet enough. I add extra cinnamon. I do not add water but rather add a cornstarch slurry. 

I also double the crumble recipe. I do not add baking powder or baking soda because I am sensitive to the taste. I add cinnamon to this as well. 

I put half the crumble on the bottom and cook it for about 12 minutes so that it does not get soggy. Then, once out of the oven,  I pour the cooked apples on top. I finish by putting the second half of the crumble on the top and peeing it in the oven for 35 minutes. It's the best Apple crisp I ever had. I gave it 4 stars because so many changes were needed.

I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg with the apple mixture and whole oats for the topping.  I used fresh picked fireside apples, sliced thin.  Took it to a church carry in and it was a hit!  I had no leftovers and a ton of compliments.

Sorry to say, it is bland and watery. I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the topping because of the other reviews. It was still bland and watery.

Definitely a winner! I have been using this recipe for years. It is absolutely delicious. My family asks for it at every holiday meal. Since everyone likes the crumbles best, I double the crumb mixture and layer the pan with it before I add the apples. I also reduce the water slightly.

Way too much sugar (and I have a sweet tooth!). I’ll make this again, but will cut the sugar by at least half. I prefer the oat, apple and cinnamon flavors coming through more than the sugar. ??

Excellent!  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup, only because I prefer it less sweeter than most.  But the flavor of this with a scoop of ice cream was perfect!  I also used steel cut oaks and ground them finely.  This makes a great dessert to make when one is needed at the last minute.

I've made Apple crisp many many times but this recipe is by far my family's favorite! The only thing I changed: doubled the crust recipe (I like having it on the bottom as well) I added 2 handfuls (about 1/2 cup) extra oats, about 1/4-1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crust mixture and 2 sticks butter instead of 1 1/3 cup. I also tossed the apples in the cinnamon mixture and cut the water in half. It was delicious!!

It was a bit sweet for me. I might cut the sugar sprinkled on the apples in half. Other than that, this dish was awesome. Had to do something with all these apples my mom gave me from her tree ;D

Delicious. Changes- Used 2-3 types of apples for more complex apple flavor and added lemon juice while I prepared apples to keep them from oxidizing and to cut a bit of the sweetness. I upped the crumble by half the recipe and used a half and half mix of palm sugar and cane sugar.  Cooked for the same time but loosely covered with foil for the first 35 min the foil off for last 10.

Delicious Apple Crisp!
I read through the reviews and did some modifications:
Only used 3/4 cup of white sugar, and I tossed the apples in the cinnamon & sugar mix instead of sprinkling it on top of the apples. I eliminated the water because apples have enough moisture, and especially with mixing the cinnamon sugar on the apples beforehand, it really brings out the juices in the apples. I also cut in the butter to the topping instead of melting the butter and pouring on top. I added chopped pecans to the crust, which a lot of people loved.
I am definitely saving this recipe!

This is easy and delicious.  Make sure you put enough butter on the crumble or it doesn't come out right.  I put an extra 2 tablespoons on my second batch and it was much better than the first.

Cut the apples in half but made the entire topping. This was a very good recipe. Hubby was happy.

Exactly what I was looking for!  Quick and easy.  I used 7 Granny Smith apples and served the crisp with vanilla ice cream.

Def one of the simplest, but most perfect apple crisps.  The only change I made was I halved the liquid using a mixture of cinnabon coffee creamer and water.  I would've also added walnuts or pecans,  but the kids would've protested, lol. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the lemon juice which I eliminated based on other comments. The cobbler tasted good except it was very dry. I used ripe fresh juicy peaches but after it was cooked, there was hardly any juice and the top was like a dry cakey biscuit. My husband grew up in the South and said that he had never had cobbler with such a dry consistency. Would not recommend this recipe.

I liked it but I made quite a few changes. I used equal parts apple slices and frozen cranberries. 1/2 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 cup. 1/4 cup water instead of a 1/2 cup but next time I'll leave the water out. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumble topping. I baked it at 350 and the thick crumble never burbled up and the fruit had a lot of runny liquid. I poked large steam holes into the crisp with a wood spoon handle and put it back in the oven at 375. It came out more like I expected. I think there was too much crumble so next time I try it I'll cut the crumble ingredients by 25% or possibly half.

Definitely a hit with my family. I added a few other spices to the crisp (always do) and it didn’t disappoint. I added a sprinkle of ginger, nutmeg, and allspice to the crust mix before the melted butter. So a nice warm flavor. 

Served it with creme fraiche and enjoyed.

Great staple recipe! Will make again for sure. I followed some of the tips other reviewers posted - used half of the water, doubled the top crust, baked for  55 min instead of 45. I used about 6 larger sized granny smith apples.
When I doubled my crumble recipe, I used: one cup quick oats, 1 cup granola and added 1 cup mini dark chocolate chips. Served with ice cream...it was a hit!

My son & his 3 college roommates had just moved in together and 3 days into their new townhouse, I got a text from him (them) saying "Mom! Help! We are dying for a home cooked meal already!" So knowing I couldn't drive all the way up there without a casserole sized, hearty dessert for 4 boys...I was on the hunt! This was PERFECT!  I did leave out the water as one commentor suggested, added some nutmeg & doubled the crust...pure perfection! I will absolutely be making this again & they have already put in ANOTHER order!

It will be a 5 star with certain changes.  I wish I'd read the other reviews before I hurriedly made this! It is good; it just needs a few previously mentioned tweaks 1.  I'll. eliminate the water,  2 I'll add 15 more minutes to cook the apples and 3.  I'll double the topping and reduce the brown sugar by 1/2 to 1/4.
I personally like the ration of crust or topping higher than the fruit.  Also, 4.  I'll add a dash of nutmeg.

Made a couple changes  based on preference. Used granny Smith, omitted water, doubled crust recipe. I'll try closer to original recipe next time as mine came out a bit dry. I also found this overly sweet even using granny Smith so I may cut back sugar. Family enjoyed it and will definitely try again.

Amazingly delicious and easy. I have made it multiple times and usually put it in a store bought pie crust and use less water than it calls for. It is so easy and goes perfectly with vanilla icecream!

Best Apple Crisp I've ever made! I have celiacs disease so I made a gluten-free version by subbing GF pancake mix for the flour. I also added extra oats (1 and 1/2 c total) and increased melted butter to 3/4c. Soooooo delicious!

Used a variety of apples I was trying to clear out of my kitchen. I see what everyone is saying about the sweetness of the apple mixture being a bit much- but that could be due to some of the sweeter apples I used. I also think I would have liked a bit more topping, so will double as others have next time. Family loved it; I wasn’t a huge fan of the oats. I did think the consistency and texture were perfect, though.

Great recipe, the topping is nice and light and crumbly, and with the melted butter it's easy to mix. (Another recipe I tried involves cutting cold butter into the other topping ingredients, which was way too fussy for me and resulted in a hard shell of a topping.)

As-is, it made way too much for just the two of us, but it's easy to cut the ingredients in half to make a 8x8 or 9x9 size if 9x13 is too much for you. 

For the record, the full size took about 10 medum/large apples; the half-size took about 5. 

Any apples will do. If they are sweet or soft apples like McIntosh or Rome, cut WAY back  on the sugar. For tart apples like granny smith, still cut back on the sugar but maybe not so much.

Great recipe, lasted only a few hours in my house. I added more cinnamon as I’m a huge cinnamon fan, half the amount of white sugar and omitted the water. 7 small apples worked great.

I immediately halved the sugar and flour content and it came out terrific. I highly recommend it in the alternate way.

Really good, but really sweet! I made it exactly as the recipe states except I added ¼ tsp of nutmeg to the apples. Next time I think I will cut the sugar in at least half and probably do 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar with the apples and if it’s still too sweet I’ll cut it down even more. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I made half the recipe, and after reading reviews that said it was two sweet, just tossed the apples with one Tbsp of white sugar, nutmeg (1/8 tsp), plus the cinnamon and flour.  Followed the rest of the recipe, and it was a big hit with our family.

I'm not a fan of apple desserts, but made this to take to a friends house.  I was very surprised that I actually enjoyed it.  Everyone else loved it.  I did serve it with ice cream and caramel sauce.  The caramel sauce was the perfect finishing touch.

This recipe called for wayyyyy too much sugar. It was so sweet that I couldn't eat it Keep in mind that I reduced the sugar by 15%  and it was still too sweet to consume. Mind you, I do find that with American recipes  the sugar level  is very high.  Tastes are different in the U.S. I will definitely go back to my grandmother's recipe. So much better.

SO GOOD!! I used Granny Smith apples and the only thing I changed was to double the topping because that is my favorite part of apple crisp. Baked 45 mins at 350 in my countertop convection toaster oven. Turned out beautifully. Even a few people who said they didn't really like apple crisp couldn't get over how good it was.

Very good. I made this dish with 7 granny smith apples  thus I cut back the sugars, flour and oatmeal to 3/4 cups using 1/3 cup water and the full amount of the melted butter.  I coated the apples first with the white sugar and them sprinkled the flour/cinnamon mixture. Unfortunately I misread the recipe and put in 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.   We do like the taste of cinnamon so did not find it overpowering. The overall taste was just right. It was not overly sweet but then the apples I used were quite sour. If sweeter apples are used you may want to cut back on the sugar amounts. This is such a good base which can be used with different fruits. Hubby said it was one of the  best crisps I made yet.

This recipe is amazing!!! I've used it numerous times now. I do however use only brown sugar, it gives it a richer taste to me.

This is a great, easy recipe! I have a soft spot for any dessert made with apples. I actually took some elements from my own apple pie recipe which adds 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves to the mix that covers the apples. Absolutely delicious, definitely give this a try if you're interested!

I halved the recipe, still baking it in a 9x13 pan,  and it took 30-35 minutes to bake.  Also reduced the sugar, and it turned out perfectly! I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe was good. Hubby and kids love it. 
Does take time to cut apples but definitely worth it. I toss the apples into the sugar flour mixture. NO WATER. 
Enjoy Baking everyone

I really like this recipe. Next time I think I will cut down a little bit on the sugar. I probably will only put 3/4 of a cup of sugar in the apples and only put 3/4 cup of brown sugar in the topping. Really yummy though hot or cold, by itself or with vanilla ice cream!

I actually added a bit of nutmeg, as well, and the result was great.

This is great, but you don’t need NEARLY that much sugar. Apples are already sweet, and the awesome crumple on top is sweet too. I probably did like 3 Tbs to 1/4 cup of the white sugar. Still delicious!

Turned out amazing!   I did not use the entire 1/2 c of water -and I did not double the top part. I think it would have been too sweet.  I used the apple slicer which makes the slices kind of big. So it needed to bake about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Next time I might add some blueberries!

I think the crumble crust has too much flour compared to the amount of oats. The result is too cake-y for my taste. I even increased the amount of oats. I'm not sure if you even need flour.

Simply Scrumptious!  As an aside, this can be adapted for gluten free diets - if substituted with cup-for-cup flour and GF oats!  I’ve made it both ways and both are delicious.  I doubled the crumb topping because why not?!

This was easy to make, and tasted good.  I used a mix of granny smith and honey crisp.  I also mixed all the ingredients and the apples together before placing in baking dish.  As others did, I used have brown/white sugar for the mixture.  I could see how some people could think this is sweet, so cutting back on some of the sugar would work.

A huge success! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out moist with a crunchy crumble top. The spice to apple ratio is well balanced. A great dish for a large crowd. If you purchase an apple peeler-corer-slicer your prep time will be quick and worth it!

Super easy to make and it is so good! I usually only use about 4 cups of apples, half the sugar mixture and keep the rest the same and it comes out perfect for my family of 5!

This is my go-to recipe for homemade apple crisp.  The only thing I do differently is double the topping recipe, as others have suggested, and add about 5 more min of baking time.  You end up with a crisp that has a good apple to topping ratio, a nice gooey apple base, and a crunchy oat crust - gets rave reviews every time.

I have made this twice and have had success both times. I took it to family events and everyone raved. The way the recipe is written is wonderful but I am a cook that likes to modify a recipe to reflect the likes of my families taste. First, I chop my apples, they tend to hold up better, but this a personal opinion. I like to use utility apples from the local orchard, the variety helps to provide nice textures and flavor. I stir the cinnamon/sugar and apples together before putting it into a 9x13 stoneware pan. Pretty tasty stuff.

Using whipping cream instead of water made this recipe much better. Mix the cream with the apples to make sure they are all coated before sprinkling on the topping. I also added nutmeg.

This was really good. I used my gluten free flour mixture in place of the ap flour and dairy free ‘butter’.

Amazing!!! Lots of compliments on this apple crisp dish! I used brown sugar instead of white and it was perfect. I also used a granny smith and a variety of red apple mix. Perfect!

This was a great recipe with only a couple of changes:  2T lemon juice instead of water, 1/2 C white + 1/2 C brown sugar sugar and added 1/4t nutmeg.  I mixed the apples and spices and flour as I would for a pie and let it sit for 15 minutes in the pan.  Then I mixed it again and spread the topping over the apples.  It took about 55 min. in the oven.  Everyone loved it and referred to it as an "uncrusted pie".  I will definitely make this again.

Oh my gosh, this is incredible! Highly recommend! I used Granny Smith apples with the full amount of water and it came out perfect. The excess water just caramelized in the bottom and wasn’t runny after the first day. I also doubled the amount of topping since that is my favorite part. It was SO good that I’m already thinking about making it again next week! Don’t forget the vanilla ice cream!

Very tasty! The only problem was that it was way to sweet. The second time I made this I halved the amount of sugar but it was still sweet. Of course this is just personal preference, but if you are a person who does not do sugary things, I would definitely recommend to half or quarter the amount sugar. Other than that, it was delicious and perfect for a dinner dessert!

I thought this turned out perfect.  I didn't change a thing. I used Granny Smith apples and I think that is very important. I wonder if the people who said it was too sweet used apples that were too sweet?

This tastes amazing!! Only changes that I made are using 1/4 cup of water (which I'm glad I did it would have been too much liquid at the bottom) and I doubled the crumble!

I thought this was amazing! It turned out very well. I didn’t have brown sugar so I just used 1/3 cup of white sugar in crumble topping and it worked out very well. I also only used half a cup of sugar on the apples themselves. I give this one a big thumbs up!

I loved this dessert! It was my first time baking any kind of fruit crisp so I read plenty of reviews. I made a half recipe in an 8 by 8 inch pan using 5 gala apples(though I may up that to 7 next time), half the white sugar and  half the brown. Also used 1/4 cup water so I think the full amount for a 9 by 13 inch is probably spot on. I used the full amount of topping because I really like it. Thanks to the submitter of this recipe. Will be making this again, probably for the holidays as Thanksgiving is right around the corner.

I thought this crisp was great, if you like a hard top. I doubled the top and made 2 square pans. Didn’t add the water (after reading reviews) and added the juice of 1 lemon in the middle  of the apple layer and then put the rest of the apples in the pan. Only added 1/2 the sugar (used brown)  in the apples, cause the apples were sweet. I will make it again!

This is the one! Although at first reading  I was skeptical of the topping begin flavourful with the amount of flour used because I’d previously used very little in the butter & brown sugar combo but it gave a crispier top. Also  added one Bosc pear to 8 Macintosh apples and placed in a smaller pan of 8x11 which spread the oat topping to a decent thickness. To keep the apples from baking to mush, I removed it from the oven 10 minutes early..delicious.

This is an excellent recipe! I adjusted it slightly because I only had 8 cups of apples. I also cut the white sugar and brown sugar by half because I don't like my desserts too sweet and it turned out perfect. Also I partially melted the butter instead of melting it completely and cut it in to get a more crumbly texture for the topping. Topping was crunchy and dessert was DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing!

This is beautiful and delicious. I used some "seconds" apples so I have no idea of variety, they did cook up firm but not too crunchy. I will be using this recipe again.

This was way too sweet. You could cut back by half on the sugar, add a pinch of salt and nutmeg, and DO NOT add water! I followed the directions 100% as written and it came out with a puddle of water at the bottom and overly sweet. I don’t agree with its 5 star review. I suppose all the rave reviews are to be expected somewhat with THAT much sugar, but as far as a 5 star rating, this apple crisp is not.

Why is there baking soda and baking powder in the topping?  I have used a similar recipe for years without them and wonder why they are needed.  I welcome your responses.  I also made it without the water, adding 1 Tbs Lemon juice and 1/2 tsp salt to the apples and mixing all together with cinnamon & sugar.  I added 1 cup chopped pecans to topping and cut in the butter.  I loved the suggestion of a little nutmeg, it was a nice addition.

This is to die for!  The only changes that I made were to halve the sugar used with the apples (we prefer a less-sweet apple pie and 1/2 cup of sugar was sufficient for us; it also balanced out the sweetness of the topping perfectly) and water (1/4 cup) and to bake for one hour instead of 45 minutes.  At 45 minutes, the apples weren't quite soft enough and the juice was more watery than carmelized.  The extra 15 minutes made it go from good to sublime.  Great recipe!

This is the first dish I made from this website, and I love it! I read many reviews and decided to cut down on sugar and water. Maybe the apples were sweet but I wish cut down on the sugar even more, but it was absolutely delicious and I couldn't stop eating, best apple pie I ever made. Also I didn't add water but a half of a lemon juice with a slice of vanilla. Amazing recipe, I registered on the site just to write a review! :) Good job!

Love this recipe. It's probably the best apple crisp I have made. The only changes I would make is add only 1/4 cup of water not 1/2 cup. And def. add more crumbs! I add 1/2 more crumbs and it was perfect!

Yum!!!!! This was every bit as good as promised. I added some pecans and that went well also. I topped it with some vanilla/caramel ice cream which made it a bit too sweet. My next serving will be with half and half.

This was yummy, though I did change it as follows: used paleo flour, added nutmeg and cardamon, used only  sprinkle o f white sugar with the apple mix, didn't add water- instead added maple syrup. Made the rumble per recipe - though with paleo flour.  Yummy!

I used Gala apples, doubled the topping (putting half on bottom), and used about .25 cups water. I ended up baking maybe 25 minutes longer. So good! Might do .75 cups white sugar next time. Mmmm....

A huge hit, but needed the following  changes: doubled all topping ingredients but the oats, omit the water, and sprinkled flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg over the apples without measuring.  Adjust the amount of white sugar according to how sweet your apples are.

I doubled the crisp part like most people suggested. I used 5 granny smith and 5 honey crisp apples. I also kept the apples thicker cut instead of using a food processor because the bigger the apple chucks the less mushy the final result. I put the apples in a gallon baggie and tossed them with the sugar and cinnomon mixture and i added a teaspoon of nutmeg. Next time I will cut the white sugar in half for the apples. It was too sweet for my taste. I saw some reveiws complain that this was too mushy. I used old fashion oatmeal instead of quick oats which made it very crunchy on top. If it wasnt so sweet I would have gave this 5 stars. Deff will make again!

Yum!  I didn't add the water, as others suggested.  I used Macoun apples and cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 glass pan.  I spread the apples on the bottom, squeezed lemon juice over them and sprinkled them with cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and maybe 2T of organic can sugar (there is half a cup of brown sugar in the topping so the 1/2 cup of white sugar it calls for on the apples prior to the topping is way too much for my taste).  I made the topping following the recipe and it was plenty since I used an 8x8 pan, but had I done the full recipe I definitely would have doubled the topping recipe as others suggested.  This is a great recipe...it's a keeper so I saved it.

Fantastic with reservations. I cut the white and brown sugar down to a half cup for each. Added a a 1/4 tsp each of allspice, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom to the apple mixture and replaced apple cider for the water. Also, a good pinch of sea salt to the crumble mixture to harmonize the sweetness. Lastly, I baked in a Dutch oven which allowed for a deeper serving of apples and a perfect amount of crumble topping. It took about 1 hour to bake at 350 which allowed the scent of fall to linger in my kitchen a bit longer.

The first time I made it, it was very good but a little too sweet for me. I cut the topping to 1/3 of all ingredients and used just one apple  in a casserole dish for 2 - just enough for me and hubby. Last night I made it for 16 in a 9x13 Pyrex dish. As many suggested, I doubled the topping and cut the white sugar in half. It was PERFECT with vanilla ice cream.

Very easy to prepare! I thought 10 cups of apples would be too much and didn't use that much. Wishing I had followed the recipe. Still extremely fantastic just less to eat.

This is also a great breakfast option. Pour some milk over it and you've got your milk, fruit and oats for the morning!

My grandchildren and I made this apple crisp recipe with apples that we had picked over the weekend. This was my first time ever making apple crisp and it was excellent!! The only thing that we added was some chopped walnuts to the topping. After putting some vanilla ice cream on top off his apple crisp, my ten year old grandson said "Grandma, this is DELIGHTFUL!"

Great recipe!  I made a smaller batch so cut it in half.  I was out of quick oats but had some instant Cinnamon/maple oatmeal packets.  I used those and the rest of the recipe as it was written.  It was VERY good!

Made it exactly using Cortlands. If I make it again will bake longer as apples are a bit too crunchy! I expected it to be juicier.

I will be using this recipe for my go to recipe for apple crisp. Made it as directed and loved it.  Even makes enough to share with family or friends, if it lasts that long :)

This is my new go-to recipe for apple crisp. I use an 8x8 baking  and add apples until it is about 3/4 full. I do not add water to the apple mixture. I make the topping as described above  because my family likes the crunch with the apples. So awesome.

The only thing I changed was adding nutmeg, which I don't think made it or broke it. This recipe is spot on and and it was absolutely delicious. I didn't double the crumble and didn't think it was lacking.

I always make a recipe exact as written the first time.  Seeing as there are only 2 of us, I did halve the recipe.  It was delicious. I used 3 different types of apples (that was what I had on hand) I would have rated it 5 stars but thought the topping could have been a little more buttery crispy. Next time I will fold in a little more butter to the topping. Other than that.  Great recipe!

Big hit at Thanksgiving - family went back for more despite two other desserts. Made it as noted in the recipe - no changes, but would consider adding craisins/raisins next time.

With a few modifications this is a great recipe. I can't imagine putting 2 cups sugar into any dessert! I used 1/3 white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and that was still a little too much especially if you eat this with ice cream. I also didn't add any water, it's not necessary.

Used tart Granny Smith apples (7). I do not like overly sweet desserts and didn't find this to be too sweet as written.  I would not reduce the sugar. Also no problem with water as called for.  The filling really came together and had a pie-like consistency.

I doubled the topping  called for because who doesn't like more topping? Came out crispy on top and edges, a bit more oatmeal cookie -like near filling.

I've made this recipe so many times.  Always amazing.  I usually do a blend of Apple types that are all suitable for baking.  Gives it a bit of depth of flavour!

I’ll use this again this week (lots of apples to use up).  I made this in a casserole dish so had to adjust the cooking time to 1hour 10 minutes to accommodate the thicker mass of apples.

This came out delish! Made it twice. First I used Granny Smith apples and made recipe as is. It needed a bit more than 1 TBS of flour. I didn't want to reduce the water because I wanted what juice there was to be thicker. So I made it a second time. Used Macoun apples, upped the flour to 2 TBS, and added a tsp of nutmeg. It came out amazing. My guys would just about eat anything but this they raved about!!! This recipe is a keeper!

I think this is the best apple crisp I have ever made.  I did mix up the sugar mixture with cinnamon and nutmeg and mixed it up with the apples in a bowl. It did bring out the juices. 
I did double the crust mixture putting some on the bottom and more on the top.  I cut up the butter from fridge and mixed it with my hands into the mixture.  I actually forgot to add the water and I'm so happy because I hate it when it's soggy and really wet.  I used an apple corer/slicer which makes fairly big pieces.  I used 10 tart Harrelson apples that we picked today from the apple orchard. Some were big and some were not. My boyfriend thought the apples themselves needed more flavor. I liked it but will consider "marinading the apples more beforehand with the sugar and spice mixture.  I might add more cinnamon and nutmeg next time.

Made this tonight with our leftover macs (we live across the street from an apple orchard so we have an abundance).  My husband said it was the best apple crisp he’s ever had by far.  My son who is a picky eater went for seconds.  Very good!!

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg along with the cinnamon, that is the only change I made.    I have made this apple crisp 3 times.

*My adult daughter is celiac so I made this apple crisp for her and  substituted gf flour and gf oats, she and her husband raved about it.  Rated it a 5 stars,too!

* used King Arthur gluten free flour and Red Mill quick cooking oats.

Absolutely loved this recipe, the only difference is I ended up using tinfoil to cover half of its cooking time to keep some of the moisture in, then uncovered for the back half.  And broiled a little longer to crisp the top to perfection :) love love love this recipe worth making.. thanks chef!

After reading a few reviews, I decided to make a few changes to this recipe.  I used 3 honeycrisp, and 3 gala apples (10 cups) and added the juice from a half of a lemon to the apples.  I omitted the water, and used 1/4 cup of sugar in the apples, instead of 1 c (a lot of reviews said it was too sweet).  I used softened butter instead of melted, and added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping.  Baked for 45 minutes and it came out GREAT!  The apples stayed crisp and the lemon cut the sugar a bit.  Only negative was that the crumble seemed a bit dry.  Will probably do 3/4 c of butter next time.

I cut the white sugar in half and the water in half. I kneaded the melted butter into the dry mixture to make sure well incorporated before spreading over the apples. Was delicious.

This recipe is so great, it's my go to recipe for apple crisp. I use half the water and add nutmeg, it turns out great. I've tried doubling the topping recipe like other reviewers suggested but I found it too much and too sweet. Served with homemade whipped cream is awesome.

I made zero changes to the recipe - and it was awesome. Next time, I will add some nutmeg and make a bit more of the topping, but otherwise, it was perfect as is.

I increased the apples using the new fall harvest - 13 cups to fill an 8.5 x 13 baking dish.  No other changes made.  This was moist, perfectly sweet and subtly spiced.  It was a hit with both kids and adults and even made it too a few breakfast plates the next morning.

I am not very handy in the kitchen, and have only made apple crisp one other time- and that didn't go well.  This recipe was easy for me to follow and tasted incredible!!! I followed some of ALLY99's modifications.  I used 6 large red delicious apples from a local orchard.  I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and it was still plenty moist. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon/flour mixture like she had mentioned.  I didn't melt the butter, but rather used a pastry blender to work it into the flour mixture until it was in pea sized crumbles.  I put a layer of apples in a greased 9 x13 pan, sprinkled them with the crust mixture, and then alternated apples and the mix.  Very pleased with how it turned out.  LOVED the flavor and the texture of the baked apples. Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

I, too, doubled the topping and decreased the sugar and water and it was great. My family loved it with ice cream and I am happy it was so easy to make because I know I will be asked to.make it again.

This recipe is super easy to make if you don't feel like baking for several hours. I'm someone who likes sweets so I changed anything I would just add a little bit more cinnamon and sugar to the mixture and a little more butter and brown sugar to the top crumble. Otherwise, this is a great recipe for the family!

This recipe tastes like Fall. Classic comfort food... best served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Like many other reviewers, I omit the water and toss the apples in the sugar mixture. I have made this recipe many times with success. Tonight I used 11 small granny smith, kept the sugar mix measurements the same but added 1/4-tsp Nutmeg, then made 1-1/2 x the topping recipe. Topping stays crumbly if you don't completely melt the butter, just soften. Baked at 350 in convection oven for 50-min. Perfect!

This was very much a oatmeal cookie topping- which wasn't what I wanted, but, a really good tasting recipe. I did add two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice blend both with the apples and the topping, and used 1/3 cup apple cider for water. I used a bit less white sugar. I think most reviews about being dry or too sweet don't take into account the very many different varieties of apples. I used Cortland, which I find just right
I'm afraid the recipe I'm looking for would use too much butter and brown sugar anyway!
I think I'll try omitting the baking powder and soda next time.

I used gluten free flour (Red Mill), and Granny Smith apples. I added about a 1/2 C chopped pecans to the topping. It baked while we we ate dinner, and I served it with whipped cream and salted caramel sauce. It was a bit at my dinner party.

This  apple crisp was delicious and a big hit at our neighborhood block party. Like other reviewers suggested, I also mixed the apples with the sugar, cinnamon, etc.,  in a bowl prior to putting the apples in the pan. I also added extra cinnamon (maybe an extra 1/2 tsp), and added nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp). Another suggestion I took from others was to double the topping mixture. This worked out great, and I had enough left over to use on a pie pan of extra cut apples. I used mostly Granny Smith apples, and a couple of galas as well. I served vanilla ice cream the side. The perfect fall dessert! Will definitely make this again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. The only thing I change is that I use 1/4 cup water, and I use mactintosh apples (only because my husband doesn’t like green apples) and he will eat the entire dish unless I stop him. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it and it never fails at get togethers or work parties.

I made this using 4 granny apples in a 8×8 dish. 
So I had to cut the white sugar and water down to half but still used the same amount of cinnamon ( what? I like cinnamon). However, I did NOT half the toppings. BEST EVER!!!! I will be making this again and again. Oh yeah, I used no salt butter stick and shouldn't have. Next time its going to be blue bonnet or add a pinch of salt to my butter.

Amazing! I found this fairly sweet. I used small apples off of a tree and they were already ripe and sweet. So I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead and 1/4 cup of water as a previous poster had suggested. I also only cooked it for 30 minutes as the apples were already slightly soft prior to cooking.

 It was delicious but next time I would add less sugar in both steps as long as the apples are already ripe/sweet.

This was a hit in our house!  I used honey crisp apples and since I know I didn't have 10 cups, cut down some of the other ingredients and cooked in a square baking dish.  I cut both sugars down to 1/2 cup each and also cut down the melted butter by 1/2.  Next time if I have the same number of apples (approx 6-7 smaller), I will also cut down the oats and flour to about 3/4 of a cup each.  I will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe!  Will certainly do this one again and again...  A favourite at home and the office.  Less apples from our apple tree went to the deers!

This was incredible, and everyone in my party of 12 raved about it and wanted the recipe. This will be my new go to apple crisp recipe! The only thing I would modify next time is to cut the white sugar in half. This dish was super sweet, but I think that's because my apples were super sweet. Thanks for the great recipe Diane!

A simple yet delicious crisp that is a big hit with my family. Followed the directions to a T with the one alteration of some nutmeg in the sugar mixture (I'm a sucker for the cinnamon/nutmeg combo). Served it warm with some vanilla ice cream and the family was fighting for the last serving. Great recipe!

I agree, cut back on the white sugar.  I used golden delicious apples from our tree and it was a bit too sweet for me.  I always use granny but thought I would try to use up what we had. Next time I'll use the granny smith.   This is one of the best I've ever tried.  Thanks

DELICIOUS!  Made it last evening, turned out so good.  Next time ( which will be soon), I will use green apples instead of the Crisp apples that I used.  I think the tartness of the green apple  will be even better.  The crumb topping is wonderful!

This is so easy and delicious!  I'm not the greatest chef/baker, and even I was able to follow the simple instructions.  ;)  Plus it is the perfect combo of flavors.  Will definitely make this for our next big family gathering.

This tastes great. I used a 3# bag of apples. Followed the exact recipe. I couldn't wait to waste the results so as soon as it was done and still warm I shoveled some on a plate and luckily I happened to have some vanilla/caramel praline frozen yogurt on hand. It's delicious!!! Alone, it's very good but served warm with ice cream it's really fantastic!!!

Prefer my grandmother's recipe: no water, cut the sugar in the apples, and use just the sugar, flour, and softened butter for the topping. (Same proportions.) We call this candied apple pie. You won't miss the oats. My husband's favorite dessert - or breakfast!

I followed the instructions but was thinking as I made it that there was too much sugar, and I was right. I would eliminate the first three ingredients. I would take about 1/4 of the mixture of oats and brown sugar and flour and mix it with the apples instead and then put the rest over the sliced apples. Also not sure why baking powder and baking soda was added to this recipe. probably won't make it again.

This recipe is soooo good, but I would not add any sugar in the apple and only put 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the crust mixture. BELIEVE ME, if you follow the recipe and use THAT MUCH sugar to your apple crisp, you will regret. But if you have a sweet tooth, then you can go for it. Of all, just make this, so worth it

This was a pretty good recipe- to be fair, I halved it so maybe that threw something off, but I found the crumple to be too wet and wasn't enough to adequate cover my square pan.  No big deal as I just added more oats and brown sugar and a bit of flour until it looked like a crumble.  Tasted good when finished!

The topping is perfect. I don't think the water is necessary in the recipe at all, made it a bit runny. I used a baking apple, which came out great and is important for the right consistency and flavor for this recipe.

Amazing recipe!! I'll never make another. I used 6 Large granny smith apples. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and mixed the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and flour with the apples before adding them to the pan. I only used 1/4 cup water, then I doubled the topping recipe because I love extra topping on mine.

This is a good recipe, and my family and friends really enjoyed it. I've made it twice now, and I find it a bit too sweet for my taste. Will alter next time, maybe take the sugar on the apples down by half.

Used this recipe as written EXCEPT cut out the water. I used my garden apples and they are on the softer side so adding water would have resulted in soup. Turned out perfectly without the water. I would only ever add water if you used really firm apples.

It was delicious.  I made as written with granny smith apples except I doubled the topping per other reviewers.  One family member thought there was "too much oatmeal", so I will probably follow the recipe exactly next time or just reduce the oats.

I made this twice but for some reason my apples are still hard they don't get soft . So the second time I made it I baked the apples with the sugar and water for 30 minutes  covered then I added the crumble and cooked for 30 minutes but the apples still are hard. What am I doing wrong

Made this with a few different apples.  Really liked it.  Easy to make and worked with gf flour.  Tossed the apples in cinnamon and sugar mix. Added nutmeg.

Yummy!  I didn't use as many apples as it called for and found it was a great mix of apples and crumble.  If you're going to use all the apples I would suggest as others do of doubling up on the crumble

So so yummy! It had quite a lot of sugar so next time I would cut down the amount of sugar and maybe add a bit more of water but it was so yummy with the original as well!!

Tip for topping: I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl and crumbled evenly over the dish.  Then I DRIZZLED melted butter on top.  A much better presentation I believe...

I have been making apple pies that I have perfected beyond belief and this recipe with a few slight changes that my husband says he actually prefers it this way!! Lol Just when I had him hooked...but honestly the way I made this recipe was heaven! I used 6 large Granny Smith apples with 1 fresh squeezed lemon with about 1/2 cup of sugar and lots of Madagascar Roasted Cinnamon  (I personally think it makes the whole dish) and tossed that together with about 3 Tbls of dark brown sugar.  For the topping I used a food processor with 1/2  cup of Flour with 1 cup of the quick oats and another 1 cup of dark brown sugar adding a cold stick of butter and more cinnamon . .M

I didn't have enough non-salted butter so I switched to sunflower oil instead- still worked out pretty great in terms of texture and everything. And in terms of taste: amazing! This is a really easy and simple recipe to follow :)

Good apple crisp! Is missing something. Much more cinnamon in the future and some nutmeg. I also added cornstarch to the water to thicken it and that worked well!

This is a great Apple Crisp and very easy to put together. I made it pretty much as written but omitted the water and my cinnamon may have been a heaping spoonful. The crisp was perfect with some vanilla ice cream.

This was delicious, but too sweet & syrupy and I would have liked a crunchier topping. Very simple to make, though.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe and reading all of the reviews.  

I did add a bit of lime juice to the 8 cups of apples (only because I didn't have tart apples).  I also added a bit of milk and water totalling 1/4 cup liquid instead of 1/2 water.

 Next time I will add 1 tsp. of vanilla to liquid and more butter to the oatmeal mix as I like my crust a little more moist.

I give it a 5 for the original recipe and for all the helpful reviews :)

I would have preferred the crisp crust  to be more dough and less oats- I didn't even notice the baking soda/powder: too much water added to mine.

Let me start by saying that I hate apples. And, I am no good at baking. I bought a bag of Granny Smith apples in a failed attempt to add more fruits to my diet. But the bag sat in a corner and I keep finding excuses to NOT eat those apples. Until I came across this recipe! Oh man, it's so delicious!!! My husband loved it, my mother-in-law loved it, in fact, whomever I served it to, loved it!! This is my 3rd bag of apples this month to make this apple crisp! Oh, Diane Kester, I can't thank you enough!
I only made a little changes here and there for a healthier version:
1) I used Granny Smith apples, and loved the slight tartness to it.
2) The 1 cup white sugar, I reduced to 1/2 cup of sugar.
3) 1/2 cup butter, I substituted with 1/2 cup of coconut oil.
4) I reduced the water to 1/4 cup because the first time I made it with 1/2 cup, it was a little mushy, not that it was bad, because I licked the pan clean! But, it lacked firmness, so it was difficult to slice them and take to work.
5) And, the crisp is so delicious, that I made a double batch to layer the bottom and the top.
It came out perfect!
This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

This is absolutely delicious and will be making it again for company. Skip the water and use Granny Smith apples so it won't be too watery.

I made this almost as is, the only change I made was I didn't add the water. I found it way too sweet. The rest of my family really liked it. I don't think I would make this again unless I did a bunch of changes.

Absolutely heavenly. My first time making apple crisp in about 30 yrs. It couldn't be nicer.  The only thing I did differently was I omitted the water and added an Asian Pear. I will be making this again and again?

Made this according to directions.  It's way to sweet for our taste.  It took a lot longer to cook.  Some lemon juice and less sugar will help alot.

This recipe is just like the one I remember my mom making when I was a child, maybe even better! I made it with my mom last week - we used margarine, which was great; I think it could be even better with butter! Either way, this recipe is tops, and I will *never* use a different apple crisp recipe.

A great tasting crisp & simple to make. I didn't use the water but I did sprinkle about 1/8th cup fresh lemon juice over the apple mixture before I put the crumb topping on.

Absolutely the best. I use the crumb topping on sweet breads and muffins. Also, yummy to eat the topping raw.

Based upon the other reviews I skipped the water and doubled the topping. I also experienced that my apples were not fully cooked in the suggested time, I had to bake for an additional 15 minutes. Came out great!

I made it as per recipe but halved it.  I did cut down the water because of reviews, used granny smith apples  and 1 1/2 the topping which I thought was perfect.  My guests loved it.  Half a recipe was a good size piece for 6 people.  Top with ice cream.  It's a keeper

I made it per the recipe except I always add some ground cloves to an apple dessert.  This was far too sweet for my taste.  If I made it again, I would start by cutting all sugars in half.  It was also very runny, so I would eliminate the extra added water or put in a few extra tablespoons of flour with the apples to make it more saucy.

I was craving apple crisp for a few days and finally decided on this recipe to try. I will definitely double the topping when I make this again as it did not cover the whole thing like I wanted it to. 
Everyone loved this recipe & I will definitely make it again!!!! It was great!

Definitely make again...I hate altering recipes but I did only put 1/2 cup sugar on apples and doubled the crust and next time I will decrease amount of sugar in crust just because it was still a little too sweet for my families taste...

I certainly loved the recipe and checked out most of the reviews before making. Most people said use 1/2 the water, I did this but it was a little dry, I used Granny Smith apples but next time would use all the water PLUS I would  1 1/2 the topping and not double as it was too much. Maybe if I didn't use all the topping it wouldn't have been too dry, GREAT flavor and certainly serve with vanilla ice cream.

We call this "Apple Brown Betty" and make it in a cast iron skillet.  It is delicious with vanilla ice cream!  Use tart apples (Granny Smith) for best results.  My kids love to make this because it's so easy and turns out perfectly every time!

This recipe was so sinple & easy to follow. I'm not even fond of apples, but this dish has now become one of my favorites & will be a go-to dessert for me. It turns out absolutely beautiful! I would highly recommend this if you're unsure of your capabilities with baking. It's foolproof.

So simple and so delicious! Used two granny smith and three rome apples and it turned out great! The crisp is crunchy and even with all that sugar its not overly sweet at all. What a fantastic dessert to follow a heavy meal.

My favorite Apple crisp recipe ever! Here's why I gave it a four and what I will do to make it a five next time:

•  Too much liquid. Skip the extra half cup of liquid unless you know you have apples that won't create as much. 

Other than that the ingredients make a beautiful caramelly flavor that is perfect with vanilla bean ice cream.

Really easy to make and turned out delicious for the time it took to make. I cut down on the sugar by 1/3  because I find most American desserts always require too much. It turned out just fine and I served it with vanilla ice cream.

Made this with a bunch of middle school kids today...despite the variety of sliced apple sizes, questionable mix ratios, and not adding water....it was all delicious. Even the pickiest eaters among the group enjoyed.

I used to make apple pies and people would go crazy for them. Then I made this recipe and people also went crazy for it, but this easy recipe is a lot less work and is quicker than your typical apple pie  with a crust.  I feel like I'm cheating when I make this, because it take very little effort with great results.

I always start out by making a recipe exactly as it is written. We liked this but found it was too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth). I used spy apples - the same that I always use for my pies and they were, as usual perfect but the sugar was too much. I would definitely cut the white sugar down to 1/2 a cup or less. There is enough sugar in the topping. I used a smaller pan and the apples ( I used 10) to topping ratio was great.

I made two separate Crisps using pre made pie fillings, apple and cherry. Both were delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again. I ran out of Minute oatmeal, used Old Fashioned type, still tasted great.

I've made other crisps that were far better than this one. There was a lot of water at the bottom and the topping was far too hard. I would never use melted butter again for a crisp. You need to use cold butter and chop it up with knives or a pastry cutter. Melted butter makes the topping bake very hard and makes it hard to crumble on top of the apples.

This is the best recipe I have found. I like my crisp sweet and tart at the same time so I used all Macintosh apples plus cut the white sugar in half. I also used dark brown sugar in the topping because it gives it a slight caramel flavor.

I made this for a girl's brunch. It was the perfect finale to the quiche, salad, roasted veggies and baked ham. I served it hot out of the oven with frozen vanilla yogurt. It was absolutely perfect on a snowy afternoon. I also added the nutmeg, deleted the water, and doubled the topping, as others have recommended. FYI, I used 8 medium-large apples and packed them in tightly. It was delicious and a huge hit!

If anything I didn't have enough apples, but it would definitely taste better with some vanilla ice cream!

This is delicious! I left out the water and added nutmeg into it as well. I also tossed the apple slices in a bowl with the cinnamon/sugar mixture instead of just sprinkling it on them. Turned out beautifully!

Good Apple crisp, we used gala apples and should have left off the water as others suggested... There was at least ½C of juice/water in the bottom of the pan that i poured off. Also doubling the topping is a must, and a few minutes under the broiler crisped up the crumbly topping also.

I made this using only 1 cup total of sugar.  I will omit more sugar next time because it was definitely sweet enough.  The recipe itself without all the sugar is excellent!  The apples were cooked perfectly and the topping was crisp.  I added more cinnamon to the topping because I didn't think there was enough.  I baked the crisp around 15 minutes longer to make sure the topping was done and the apples had a nice syrup around them.  The 1/4 of water kept it from getting dry.  I used a glass baking dish so I could keep an eye on it.  I will definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe!  I listened to reviews and cut sugar in apples in half as well as half the amount of water.  Put some crumble on bottom as well as top.  We put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and it was superb!

I loved this. I did cut sugar to 3/4 cup, stirred it all in with apples. Doubled the crust and halved the water. I used 8 apples mixed with honey crisp and green. Husband loved it so much!!!!

We halved the recipe; then based on other reviews, halved the amount of water again. We had gala apples on hand so used those. This was delicious but very sweet. When we make it again, we'll either use less sugar or more tart apples. Great recipe!

My girlfriend made it in an 8x8" pan. I think she used the full sugar measurement so it was super sweet, but full topping measurement which resulted in a perfect amount of crunch. I'd double the topping mix for the 9x13" pan.  If using an 8x8", half the sugar. I'll be making it myself for Christmas dinner tonight, except I'll be adding a cup of rum soaked raisins and a bit of nutmeg. Also, the apples weren't peeled as per the picture, and it still turned out great. The peels have the nutritional value. Make it!

Excellent recipe! As another reviewer suggested, I doubled the topping and used half for a bottom layer. I baked the bottom layer for 10 minutes prior to adding the apples and topping. My favorite way to make this is using (7) Granny Smith apples. This one's a keeper for sure!

Make as directed.  I put lemon juice on my apples, and used 3 Granny Smith, 3 Gala.  Also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I DID NOT add the water, and it was perfect. Baked for 45 minutes, and sat for about 45 with juices and flavors nicely settled in.

I used this recipe just for the topping and used my own jar of homemade apple/pear pie filling. It was delicious! My quart jar was really only big enough for a 9x9 so my crust was probably a little thicker but it was so good! I also substituted old fashioned oats bc I didn't have quick cooking. It turned out fine

This was SO GOOD and I will definitely make again.  I made this for a work potluck.  Due to various dietary restrictions in the group, I had to find a vegan recipe.  For this particular recipe, I was able to substitute the butter for vegan butter without a problem.  Per the various recommendations, I doubled the crumble part of the recipe.  My coworkers (and I) loved it!  People were still talking about it the next day!

I usually use Granny Smith apples for baking but only had galas on hand when I made this.  I did a 1/2 batch and followed the recipe exactly- it was terrific!  I will do it again and probably leave out the water next time as it was quite a bit more soupy than my usual crisp recipe.  This took a favorite dish to the next level!

This was delicious and very easy to make. Like other reviewers, I left out the water. I also made 1.5 portions of the topping and added a pinch of nutmeg. It was fairly sweet. Next time, I will cut back on the sugar mixed with the apples. 7 medium granny smith apples was the perfect amount.

Oh My Gosh! This was the best apple crisp I have ever had. The only thing that I changed was using Coconut Palm Sugar instead of white sugar as an experiment. It worked!! The coconut palm sugar gave the crisp more of a caramel-ey flavor than you get with white sugar. If you can get it, try it! In all cases: make. this. recipe.

I took other reviewers suggestions and cut the white sugar in half, used Granny Smith apples, omitted the water, and a 9 x 13 pan.  The apples were fantastic. I doubled the topping but I'm not sure I used enough butter (probably my fault because I did not measure it).  I tried cutting the butter into the topping but it was a little dryer than I would like. Next time I would use less flour in the topping. Otherwise a terrific recipe for both a desert and topping for waffles/yogurt for breakfast.

I made as is and my family loved it! Next time I will add less water since it did turn out a little watery but it's nothing that messed with the taste. Just don't spoon the water onto your plate :)

My 11 year old daughter made this and did a great job! The only thing changed was a reduction in water. It turned out delicious!

Great recipe!  I made it with 1.5 of the topping mixture, and I added more apples.  Delicious!!

Well, I agree, it was awesome! I don't usually rate recipes, but I HAD to on this one. My family grumbled they didn't get enough of it and I am going to have to make another one so my daughter can have some more before she goes back to college. It was simply the best I have ever had, and I am a fan of fruit desserts. That said, I followed many reviewers advice on  three main issues. First, I used granny smith only apples. The combination of tart and sweet absolutely made this dish. Second, I used freshly grated nutmeg lightly over the apple mixture. What a great addition! Last, I doubled the toppings. It was perfect. After it came out of the oven later it seemed a little dry, so I sprinkled a few scant TBS of water over it very sparingly. Made all the difference, though others may not feel the need for this.  Absolute heaven. Thank you for sharing, it is our new Thanksgiving tradition.

Tweaked it a bit but I must say, excellent and the best I've tasted!  I went with a recommendation from another review and glad I did.  I used half the water, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the apples (granny Smith).  For the crust, double the amount and added 1 1/2 C of chopped pecans and baked it a bit longer until crust was a rich golden brown.  Awesome with vanilla ice cream!

I had to make this gluten free.  I didn't do the first part mixing the apples together with sugar, flour/water and just dotted butter over the top and then subbed the flour with oat flour...turned out perfect.

Only giving four stars because I did not prepare as suggested.  Needing a dessert in a pinch, I doubled the topping and crumbled over canned pie filling. This fantastic topping fooled some into to thinking I had made the whole thing from scratch, LOL. Thanks!

This was okay except that the crisp ingredient proportions are not correct.  I make enough "crisp" desserts to know better, but for some reason, I was determined to actually follow a recipe for once.  There was just not enough butter to actually hold the crisp together.  I added a bit extra melted butter when I noticed the texture wasn't right but still not enough.   It turned out like a fine powdery topping.  Tasted okay though.

This was good! I followed others about the water, I did not add any. I also cut my apple slices big and added one Tablespoon of nutmeg.  Loved it with Vanilla Bean ice cream, definitely a keeper! Thanks!!!

Everyone said they liked it, of course I'm my own worse critic. Next time instead of sprinkling everything over the apples I'll probably mix it all together. I'm not a huge fan of the quick oats either, but I'm unsure what I'd replace them with...

Full disclosure, I only made a half recipe because I didn't have that many apples to use up. It definitely tasted very good, but it wasn't crispy. Of course if you heat this up and put a scoop of ice cream on it, no one will complain.

This is delicious! This is my go-to when a few apples are starting to get soft and could go bad within a couple days. It's so easy and I always seem to have all the ingredients on hand.

This  is the best Apple Crisp recipe Ive found. I didnt use quite as much sugar. 3/4 cup of each. everything else stayed the same.
I don't feel that the topping needs to be doubled, there was plenty for a 9X13 pan! thanks for sharing

There is nothing much to say besides it was GREAT! Picky family LOVED IT. I did NOT add any water and it was great. I did double the topping and that also was perfect. I would suggest adding a larger pan or even tin foil to the bottom of the oven as mine started to bubble over while it was baking. But man oh man was this great!

Everyone loved this dish. Once the apples are peeled and cut, it's so simple! I made it exactly as written only I substituted Splenda and Splenda brown sugar. I didn't tell anyone until later and nobody even noticed it was sugar free! I served it with a squeeze bottle of caramel and vanilla ice cream

I thought this was great, I halved the recipe. I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in the apple mixture  and added only a splash of water. It came out perfect. Should have made a whole one!

Great!  I followed a few other reviews and added some nutmeg, removed the water, and doubled the topping.

I made it (mostly) as directed and shared it at work. My coworkers said it was the best apple crisp they'd had in years.
I didn't half the water as some suggested and it was a tad runnier than I would like, but that didn't stop it from being delicious. I also tossed in a little pumpkin pie spice to mix things up. Really delicious. I used a mix of fuji, honeycrisp, and sweetango apples.

Edit: I've made this twice in the last month now and it definitely turns out better if you mix the flour/spice mixture with the apples instead of just sprinkling it over. The flavors mingle much better.

This is a good dessert, family liked it, easy to make. I doubled the crumble as advised by several reviewers and personally found it made it a like oatmeal with sugar and apple compote.  Would not add so much crumble next time.

I made it in a 8X8 pan, did not add any water, used 1/2 the sugar it called for but used the crumble topping for the 9x13 pan.  This turned out so yummy. Will be making this time and time again

SO delicious! I followed the directions as written with slightly tart apples and would not change a thing. The water added to  the apples made it a little soupy when it was hot, but when it set up it was perfect. I refrigerated some leftovers and rewarmed them the next day. I think the water kept the apple mixture from drying out.

I made it according to the recipe, except I used gluten free flour mixture and I did not add the water.  everyone liked it, the apples actually had a bit too much juice, so it was good that I didn't add the water.  The crumble was not as good as some others I have had.  I think for that amount of flour and sugar it probably needed more butter.  In some bites the brown sugar is still very granular.

I always feel funny to review a recipe that I changed. But it's so delicious and so easy, so I decided to share what changes I made. First thing, I got rid of butter and substituted it with 2 tbs of coconut butter and 2 tbs of coconut oil.  Neither of them was melted; I worked them into the oats/sugar/flour mixture. Next thing: sugar. I replaced regular and brown sugar with coconut sugar. I also cut it in half and it still came up a little bit too sweet. But that also depends on the apples you use; mine were on the sweeter side (I don't know what kind, as they came in my CSA). I also added a juice from half lemon together with water. It came up delicious, with coconut undertones! Yumm!

No changes..used Granny Smith apples. Next time will try a mixture of apples.
May also try oatmeal instead of flour to make it a little healthier.

Fantastic :)
I mixed the apples with the white sugar, cinnamon & 1 Tbsp of flour in a bowl then put in 9x13 pan....I DID NOT add water . (The sugar brings out the juices in the apples)
I did not double the topping ....I doubled the topping the last time I made it and found it to be way too much.

Instead of using all-purpose apples, I used granny smith apples, because that's what I had in my house. I just made it today 10/23/2016 for my family, they devoured it, but I had fun making it. Only made one time.

This is the best dessert I ever made.  So yummy.  The crumble topping is perfect.  Gives the apples a nice texture and sweetness.  I followed the recipe exactly. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.  Restaurant quality.

Followed the directions entirely.  There is way too much water in this recipe and too little topping.  Follow the adjustments in the reviews and it could be great.  As is it is only three stars.

Make it this way every time. Sometimes use a gluten free pancake mix as a sub for flour and lesson up a tad on sugar to make ourselves feel better...

Very tasty and simple.  The many cooks tips in the reviews were very helpful. I am only giving it 4 stars out of 5 because I feel the recipe alterations were quite warranted. 

Apples I used: 8 small Gala, 2 large Granny Smith. Where I live there wasn't any choice as to what apples I could use. 

Sugar content: I halved the recipe content. I knew I was going to serve it with ice cream so I did Not want the apple crisp itself to be so sweet. I cannot imagine how it would taste if you made it as is - it might be like a candy bar or something. Nasty.  

Water content: 1/4 cup

Topping amount: I made two batches of the topping (the flour and oats part) and ended up using 1.5 batches because I like a lot of Crisp on my apples. This was perfect.  I couldn't stop sampling bits of the very crispy topping right after it came out of the oven. 

This is definitely going into the Fall Baking rotation. I have an apple pie recipe that I use but this will be perfect for those times when I don't have the time or the patience to make a more elaborate crust.  

It is sensational paired with plain vanilla ice cream.  It is very hard to stop eating. Not good for people without willpower, that is for sure.  :)

Excellent...... This is a great way to use up frozen windfall or lesser quality apples. Taste the apples after they thaw and adjust both  sugars and lemon juice accordingly; mine also needed lots of cinnamon as well as some nutmeg. No water was needed as they had lots from the freezing process. I did syphon some of the liquid off part way through and then spread it on the topping part way through to make it mix better.  At the very end I broiled it gently on the bottom shelf until the topping was crisp.

Loved this recipe! Have made it twice in one month, as it is apple harvest time now. Took the suggestion of doubling the topping and adding  a touch of nutmeg to the cinnamon. (Amount of nutmeg depends on number of servings  you are preparing.) Everyone loves it, especially my husband who doesn't often eat desserts.

This was delicious-best apple crisp ever!  I did double the crumb recipe as others suggested (glad I did cuz it's awesome), and I added 1 tsp of nutmeg to sugar mixture, and left out the water.  Also mixed the apples in sugar mixture rather than just sprinkling it on.  Since I used apples that were only slightly tart and somewhat sweet, I cut the sugar for the apples in half and reduced the sugar in crumb part by 1/4 cup (after doubling the recipe for it). Glad I did because of the Empire apples I used. We all felt it was the perfect sweetness, and the consistency was right on. I think if I was using Granny Smith or other pretty tart Apple, I would leave the sugar as written or maybe just reduce by a little bit. Oh, I did add a couple more small apples just to use them up, so it was a bit more than the amount called for. Also just remembered that I used less butter than it called for only because I ran out.  Topping still fantastic with a little less butter.  This was the best-thanks for sharing!

Lovely! Made one and a half. The half I sweetened the apples with 1/4 C maple syrup, and the crumble with 1/4 C honey.  Made double topping.

Best Apple Crisp recipe I've ever had!  The topping is excellent and most of our favorite parts.  Only change I made was to omit the water and I only used half of the white sugar on the apples.  I used Gala apples because that is what I had and was concerned because they are somewhat soft.  The end result was excellent, the apples stayed firm.  I actually peeled the apples, then wedged them so they were very thick.

Oh my goodness!!  The BEST!!  Made pretty much as recipe called for but made a few slight changes based on ingredients I had on hand.  I put the sliced apples in a large ziplock & dumped in the flour, sugar, cinnamon mixture.    Halved the water & added a little ground cloves (no nutmeg on hand).  Gave it a few good shakes to cover all apples & poured it into 9x13 pan.  Topping was soooo good!! Since all I had was golden delicious apples, I did cut the brown sugar down to a 1/2 cup.  Served w/vanilla caramel ice cream.  Perfect!!

I made this recipe using McIntosh apples, and it turned out amazing! I recommend using less than the amount of water in the recipe, as there was some excess water in the pan after it was cooked, but it didn't seem to affect the taste or consistency, both of which were great. My family loved it and I'd definitely make it again!

Fabulous. I cut all the sugar by 1/3 for health reasons. I didn't have the oatmeal, so used some organic gluten free maple granola! The little extra crunch turned out delicious. Made a nice topping and added a little fiber!

I used Arkansas Black apples instead of more standard baking apples, and substituted  the white sugar with 2/3c agave necter. To make up for that, I reduced the water by 1/4c. 
It still turned out really really good. My mom loved it and it went great on vanilla ice cream!

Everyone loved this dessert!  Based on the previous reviews, I adjusted as follows:  doubled the crumble quantity, added only 1 cup of sugar on the apples - 1/2 white, 1/2 brown, and omitted the water.  Will definitely make again.

Made this the first time yesterday but I did it a bit differently, I made it gluten free. Instead of flour, I used gluten free baking flour; the oatmeal of gluten free oatmeal. It turned out great!

I cut the recipe in half and used old fashioned oats because that's what i had.  I baked it in the smaller Pyerex dish (11x7?) and it turned out great.  I like crisps CRISP so maybe a little more oats and butter next time.

I lowered simple carbs, raised complex carbs.  I made some dietary changes to the recipe and it came out great. I didn't use any white flour used fresh ground whole wheat flour. The same for white sugar - none, to cut down sugar intake, but you could use some honey or Stevia. Did use brown sugar, stevia, truvia, Turbinado or date would work too. 
 Only used 1Tablespoon of w.w. flour in the apples and completely left out the soda and baking powder. Washed and cored the apples but did not peel them. Used large granny smith apples that yielded approx 2 cups loose pack per apple, yes, they were the size of large golden delicious!
 Followed directions and bake time. Came out lovely! 
 It tastes great not tart, but not sickly sweet either. B-)

 However, next time I will use at least the equivalent of 2 to 3 more apples. 
 If you want to cut out the butter just use equal amount of CCO ( CoConut Oil ) which is a medium chain fat that adds to your energy not your waist.
Enjoy, TB   : )

The family absolutely loved it, it was  gone in minutes. Will definitely make again. I might omit the water next time the apples were just so juciy.

Far too sweet.  Tasted like eating an apple slice with a mound of sugar.  Made it again and played around with the recipe.  Here's what I did and my family was all raving about it :)

I used Gala, Fuji and Granny Smith apples.  Only a couple tablespoons of brown sugar instead of the cup of white sugar with the apples.  I also used cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger for the spices.  Further, with the crumble I used finely minced crystallized ginger and a handful of walnuts.  Sorry I can't give you exact measurements as I am one of those who doesn't measure carefully.  Just play with the seasonings and the amount of sugar that your family enjoys and you can't go wrong!

Instead of following directions, I used whatever apples I had in the fridge, and i didn't peel them (what a waste of nutrients!).
It was very quick and easy, my kids will love making this too!
It filled a whole 9x13 cake pan with just 7 small apples, so go easy on the apples.
When it came out of the oven (after 45 minutes), it was perfection. Not too sweet, and perfectly cooked.

This apple crisp was perfectly golden and smells really delightful and of cinnamon.  The taste of apples and cinnamon was a touch of heaven.

It's a bomb! I followed the other reviews, i used half white sugar and half brown sugar and added more cinnamon to the apple mixture. I used granny smith green apples. I omitted the water. And for the crust, I don't have baking powder on hand. It turn out great, I served with french vanilla ice cream...I have to stop myself from eating. And save some for my boyfriend (he will love it for sure).

Could not have selected a better tasting dessert for fall.  I made a 9x13 pan, even though there is just two of us, and over 3 days we ate it all.  That's important to note because I am not a sweet eater but love apples!

This was good. I made 2 9x13 pans and about 12 apples. I mixed the apples with the spices and added bit of nutmeg to the mix. I tripled and half'd the crust so I could make a bottom and top crust which was the perfect amount. I baked for about 45 mins and served warm with ice cream.

The only thing I changed was the butter. I used Earth Balance for a vegan version. It was extremely sweet and next time I think I will cut the sugars in half. Otherwise, this is a great recipe!

This was fantastic. I made it for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I added a handful of dried cranberries and a splash of fresh squeezed lemon to the apples and the combination was excellent. This recipe doesn't need anything adjusted , I just wanted to experiment. I'll definitely be making it again, with or without the cranberries and lemon. I must say though, to switch up the classic apple crisp recipe, I recommend trying it!

This is really good!!!  When I opened the oven once it was finished, the yummy smell that came out had me super excited!!!  Then when I tasted it, it was even better.  The only thing I will do different next time will be to add less or no water.

Hard to truly screw up making apple crisp. This topping is  very crisp. I read number of reviews and made a few adjustments based on popular opinion. Did not add 1/2 c water BUT I did rinse my apple slices. Made a recipe and a half of topping.  Added nutmeg and dried cranberries to the apples and  sliced almonds to the topping. Smells awesome baking. :) Family loved it even w/o ice cream. Thanks!

I made this and doubled the topping as many suggested. It may have been too much.  So, I'd say I will add more of the topping ingredients next time but definitely not double. Also, I did cut down on the sugar by 1/4 Cup as suggested and that worked well. Other than those 2 things leave the recipe as is. Tasted great!

After experimenting with this recipe I believe I have perfected it and created the BEST APPLE CRISP OF ALL TIME.
 Here are my modifications:
1. Double the recipe for the "crust", so that you can have a bottom crust.
2. Increase the amount of Butter by 1/4 Cup (I use Land 'O Lakes European Style Unsalted Sweet Cream Butter)
3. Decrease White Sugar to only 1/4 Cup
4. Increase Cinnamon to 1 TBSP
5. Add 1/2 TBSP Cloves and 1/2 TBSP Nutmeg to sugar and cinnamon mixture
6. Add 1 TBSP Vanilla extract to the 1/2 C Water
7. Toss apples (I use a gallon-size baggie) in sugar, spices and water/vanilla mixture before spreading it all on the bottom crust.
8. Lightly mix the crust mixture in its own bowl, using a fork, in separate equal halves (one for bottom crust and one for top), before spreading it in the pan and on top of the apples.
9. Bake, uncovered, on center rack in preheated oven at 350 degrees for 55 minutes
10. After letting it cool for 15 minutes I serve it, still warm-hot, with vanilla ice cream
See my photo for results!

Very easy and quick. I boiled my apples slices ahead of time and then used my apple infused water for the water to pour over the cinnamin and sugar. This cut down my bake time to 25 minutes.

A keeper but did not add sugar to apples.  Sweet enough with the sugar in the topping.  Having baking powder in the topping makes it lighter.

The perfect fall dessert and so delicious! I halved the recipe, but I kept the toppings (step 3) the same, so if you do not want to half the recipe, double step 3. Another thing I love about this recipe is I already had everything to make it! It doesn't call for anything that most people don't have or you are going to have to buy to only use once.

It turned out amazing. I added some dried cherries and cranberries. I also used steel oats for the crisp. This recipe is a keeper!!

Great recipe! I went apple picking and had lots of Gala apples. I know they're a bit on the sweeter side so I used a little less sugar. I mixed up the apples with the cinnamon mixture as suggested by another reviewer and it turned out great.  I doubled the topping as suggested and it made too much. Next time I'll use 1 and 1/2 times the amount of topping instead of double. Can't wait to try it again!!

With the cooler weather among us, it got me into a baking mood. I made this recipe as written but did double the topping mixture. I found it a little to sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth!) but it was still the best apple crisp I've ever tasted or made. Next time I make it, I will try using only half the sugar and butter and see how that turns out. And maybe add more cinnamon as I really love cinnamon!!

I used half of the recommended white sugar and still plenty sweet. I also add juice of 1/2  lemon to the apples along with the water.  Also have used bunch of different apples (whatever is at hand) and has always been a huge hit.

Oh man!!!  This is so very good, and I'm really glad a made a huge pan full so there is some left over for breakfast.  I live in Guatemala, and while we can buy imported apples of all types, they are very expensive and not always of high quality.  So I bought some local apples, and they worked great.  They were a mixed lot, some sweeter than others, some juicier than others, so I followed the basic directions pretty closely.  I added more cinnamon, cloves and ginger to the mix because we like it that way, cut back a bit on the sugar, and like others suggested, I cut back the water and added lime juice to make about 1/4 cup.  

I doubled the topping but used less flour and more oats, baked it for about 50 minutes (my oven isn't always reliable) and served it for dessert.  My husband, who loves desserts, let me know I could make this any time, any way I wanted.  He grabbed half of it to take to a friend's house tonight for a TV event and let me know I didn't need to make breakfast.

Amazing apple crisp!!!!! My whole family loved it! I prefer it in a bowl of vanilla ice cream. One thing I would change is the amount of water. Maybe only use half of it or even just a tiny bit. It came out really watery/soupy. Other than that, awesome recipe!

This was easy to make, my daughter and I went apple picking last week so had lots of fresh apples. We stirred the apples a bit in the sugar and spice mix in the pan, as well our butter was soft so we did not melt it. We doubled the crumble topping as someone else suggested and found there was great coverage for all of the apples. Next time will make the topping as 1.5 larger and not double though. Maybe reduce the sugar as well throughout. But it was awesome and so easy!

This recipe is perfect for fall! I used gala apples to add a little bitter to all the sweetness. After coating the apples with the normal ingredients, I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon and sugar on top before the breading. After done cooking, serve with ice cream for an amazing taste!

What a great recipe!  I did make a few changes only adding 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the 9 X 13 pan.  I also added some nutmeg and didn't take out the water.  I used Macintosh Apples because we like a softer apple.  Loved the crunch on the top with the oatmeal, flour and butter mixture.  We have made it twice already and it is now my favorite Apple Crisp Recipe.

Made it exactly as stated. Flavor was good, but the water over the apples was unnecessary. It made the recipe too watery. Also, there was not enough topping, and the topping surely would have been improved by the addition of more flour. Not sure why it was necessary to melt the butter - cutting it into flour and oats would have made it tastier. Thanks, but I'll keep looking.

Very easy recipe and it is delicious! The upper crust is more  crispy and delicious. But, the apple part is too sweet. Will definitely make this next time but with less sugar.

Easy and tasty!  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup after reading comments saying the posted recipe was too sweet.  One half cup was just right.  I also slightly reduced the portion of water.   I will use this recipe again!

This was so good!!!  I'm never searching for an apple crisp recipe again. This one is it. 
I only had a 9X9 casserole dish available so I made 1/2 the filling recipe. I followed the tip about omitting the water and I'm glad I did. (smart tip)  I used a mix of Fuji and Gala apples, cut into chunks and they came out juicy and tender.
 
I made a full recipe for the topping (I have half in my freezer)  But I  made a few additions to suit my taste: I added
 2tsp cinnamon and a generous sprinkle of nutmeg. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped pecans (I'd add more next time). I also used 1/2 stick melted butter and 1/2 stick iced cold butter that I worked in by hand. I liked the texture, not too crispy, but still buttery.   I highly recommend this recipe.

Loved this! And my family gobbled it up. I only used half the amount of white sugar. I didn't realize how low I was when I started the recipe, but it still turned out really good. So if you want to cut down on some sugar--it won't hurt it. And I doubled the topping because it's my favorite part of apple crisp. Delicious and will be making again

Absolutely delicious!    I followed other reviewers' tips and halved the water, and tossed the cinnamon - sugar mixture with the apples.   I made an extra half-recipe of the crust and put it on the bottom, which really made it taste awesome! I only used half the sugar in the filling, and I added more cinnamon, and it was plenty sweet.  I also reduced the sugar in the crust by one-third. !  It was perfect all-around!

We loved it!    I loved the topping and not having to "cut cold butter" between 2 knives with other ingredients.  I particularly loved the crumble topping.  It was delicious and a fantastic Crumble..
Now, because I am not a cook, I have to go by a recipe  to the letter.  Mine was a bit liquidy on the bottom but did not take away from the taste. I just lifted some of it out with a spoon. I did let it sit for at least an hour before cracking it open.  I used Cortland and Red Delicious Apples as we had been Apple Picking the day before.  I wonder if it was the Apples that may have more water to them.  None the less, everyone gobbled it up with ice cream and whipped cream.  The family knows I am not exactly Martha here so they were highly impressed !!  
The only thing I thought wrong was the Prep time...maybe because I am a novice but this took me a full hour to Prep.  I think the 20 min prep time is AFTER you have your apples peeled.   After that, it was nothing to put together!   5 stars and I absolutely will make this again.

This was excellent. I followed the suggestions and added  half the amount of water & a dash of nutmeg. I also mixed all the ingredients for the crumble in my stand mixer and gradually added the melted butter to it so it did clump up & become more "crumble like." Will definitely make it again!

Great recipe. Incredibly simple and delicious. I threw about a half tsp of apple pie spice in with the white sugar step as well. :)

I cut the recipe in half cause its only hubby and me. Oh my, it is sooo good and so easy to make. I used orange juice instead of water like another reviewer suggested.  I used half Granny Smith and half Gala apples, which I sliced with my mandolin. Delicious recipe. Will make from now on.

Great recipe...I doubles the topping and used butter that I mixed in by hand instead of melted butter...also less water.  I also added chopped pecans to the topping and sprinkled sugar crystals on the top to make it shine.

Truly loved this recipe. My daughter n neighbor was dancing and making that good tasting sounds when you know it good.  I did added some lemon zest and lemon juice about 3 squeeze.  Added fresh mint leaves which brought some fresh taste. I also made two different batch with 2 types of sugars,  one with white regular sugar and the other with natural organic tornabando sugar ( I used less sugar). Also used organic light brown sugar for both. Definitely can tell the different of the sugar being used. The tornabando sugar wasn't as sugary as the white granulated sugar.  This was my first time ever making this recipe n it became my family favorite already.  Love it

I changed the serving size to 6, there's some confusion in the ingredient list. it states 1/2c flour for the first part(before adding water) yet the instructions states a tablespoon. I went with the tablespoon. 4apples =5cups (6servings according to recipe). baked in small individual sized bowls, it came out to 8 servings (see my pic). tastes amazing. highly recommend it.

I used fresh apples form my friends yard.  They where mid-tart so I used the full amount of sugar but it was almost too sweet for us.  When I make it again I'll cut the sugar in half.  Despite that it WAS delicious!

I've made this 5 times in the last month.  Its apple season at my house. 
I cant believe the response I've gotten from everyone ive given one to.  It's so popular!
I've tweaked the recipe many different ways of course,  but it doesn't matter- it always turns out awesome no matter what i do. Ive made it with pears,  tons of Cardamom,  way less sugar,  gluten free,  simmered the sugar and butter into a caramel first...  I never seem to so it the same twice.  And it  always is really wonderful. 
I highly recommend this recipe. 
It's fool proof and everyone loves it.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! I did stir the spices into the apples and added a 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. . I reduced the water to 1/4 cup. I also doubled the toppings. But I think it would have been just fine without doing that. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making it again and again.

It's awesome but the only issue I had when making it was with the water, the "sauce" was pretty thin and runny, so next time I think I'll leave out the water and just toss the apples to coat them like suggested by others. Overall not too bad tho

I didn't make any changes, other than I ran out of quick oats so I used the regular ones. It still turned out amazing!!! My husband actually preferred it but I'm good with either. 
I have made a mass production of these this week and everyone has loved it! Will most definitely keep this one in my recipe book and have no need to search for another.

I used a recipe converter to adjust for two servings and it was delicious!  A little on the sweet side; could cut down sugar to three forths or even a half, if your apples are sweet ...  

Use gala instead of granny smith apples and that could be the reason why mine came out uber sweet.

Everyone loves this!  I use honey crisp apples.  They have the right balance of tart and sweet,  I cube the apples instead of slicing and the water is unnecessary.  If you  don't like cinnamon you can omit it or use another ground spice.

I needed to make a Gluten-free version of this for my family , and they were VERY happy with the results!  We used gluten-free oats, and a flour mixture from XO Baking Co. For the flour.  I decreased the sugar as it seemed excessive and doubled the topping as others suggested.  I also added vanilla, and some salt to balance all the sugar.  i would have given this 5 stars, but it was just too sweet.  I might cut the sugar in half next time.  This is amazing with ice cream, by the way.

Absolutely delicious! As I read the reviews, I was surprised how many other cooks did change something here or there. 
This was the 1st apple crisp I ever made, and will look no farther! I totally love it! 
I pealed 14 red apples (one bag)
The few changes I did were:  I 1st cooked my apples down with the brown sugar (instead of white sugar), cinnamon, & a dash of "Apple Pie Spice".  I added the flour to the apples, before I semi strained them & put them in the pan. 
I also added some of the juice from the pan to my 'crisp'. It does make it a little bit less crumbly, but then I top it off with about 1 1/2 cups of chopped walnuts on top. So it is still crumbly.
The 1st time I made it, I took it to a pig roast cook-out. Once people started in on the deserts, it was gone within 30min.  
Now it's one of my favorites!
Thank you!

Such a lovely recipe! I only gave it 4/5 stars because I think the 1 cup of each brown and white sugar it too much, but if you take out the white sugar then it's a 5 star recipe.

This turned out good. I did omit all the water, and I wish I would have added at least 1/4 cup. (I cut the recipe in half and did it in an 8x8 dish. ) I probably will  cut back a little on the sugar the next time I make it. But it was good and even better the next day.

This is my "go to" and favorite recipe for apple crisp. I have made this recipe many times reducing  the amount of water  and sometimes adding no water.  This apple crisp recipe is worthy of all the 5 stars it has received!!

This was so easy and was very good.  The topping was nice and crisp and for my taste,  tthe apple filling was the perfect amount of sweetness. 
The only change that I made was that I used 1/4 cup water and a very thick caramel topping to equal 1/2 cup instead of just water.  Definitely will be making this again and am looking forward to this being a fall favorite.

Yummy!! For the filling, it worked perfectly to use only about 1/4 to 1/3 cup water with  2 tsp. lemon juice, and 1 tsp. vanilla added. I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the apple sugar mixture.  I will try reducing the white sugar a bit and adding a little more cinnamon next time. Also, to the topping I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

This was great and really easy. The only thing I added was a little caramel on top. Out apples were really sour to start with so this helped. I would definitely make it again.

Loved it. I made the changes that other reviewers did: halved the water, doubled the topping! It turned out super delicious.  I also used granny Smith apples and they were perfect.

Excellent flavor! I halved the entire recipe and used Granny Smith apples. Other than using cold tiny cubes of butter on the topping instead of melting it and mixing it in, I followed the recipe exactly. The water turned into a lovely syrup. I cooked the crisp, then set it aside in my toaster oven while I baked my main dish. After my main dish was done, I put the crisp back in the oven to keep it warm until after dinner. It was perfect served with some double vanilla ice cream.

I made this and instead of using apples I used peaches. it was amazing. Also after you heat it up or after it is done you can put some granola on it or mix in it. I did and it brought the flavor out so much better.

Made it today, after reading reviews decided to omit the water, (it seemed that was a frequent review) and doubled the topping. I'm glad I did did both of those, it turned out fantastic. Some reviewers suggesting cutting the sugars in half but if you use the called for amount of apples (10 cups) then the sugar to apple ratio is just fine. If you use less apples, use less sugar. I personally will use this recipe again and again.

This was very good!! I used 3 large Fugi apples, so cut back on the sugar so it would not be  too sweet. It was perfect!! I also made 1 1/2 times the topping for a small casserole dish. Served it with vanilla ice cream. We ate it 3 nights in a row. (I made 1/2 the recipe for 2 of us) The 1/2 cup of water was perfect to make a nice apple juice thickened. Personally, you could cut out almost all the sugar if you use apples other than Granny smith. I do prefer mine with a tart bite to it though. Excellent.

These were a hit! The only thing I would do differently next time is soak the apples in water before hand so they are a bit softer and use 1/2 the water so there isn't extra liquid after baking. Otherwise, this was delicious and my whole family loved it!

I've never made apple crisp before, but came directly to allrecipes because they have an excellent Banana Muffin II recipe that has become my go-to. Well, this apple crisp recipe was the same. I halved it since I didn't want to make a huge one the first time, and put it in a 2 quart baking dish. The only thing I did differently was I made it gluten free by using GF oats and Bob's Red Mill GF flour. I used Jonagold apples because they were in season and I don't like Granny Smith, and it was perfect! Will be making this again!!

New family must-have recipe! I couldn't stop them from seconds. This was absolutely delicious! I made this dairy-free and added about 1/4 c more Earth Balance spread to get a good crumble consistency.

I made this exactly as is and loved it so much! I used apples from an [unknown kind] apple tree, nothing you'd find in the store. They were VERY tart. They were p-e-r-f-e-c-t for this amazing recipe. The crusty top is the best too. Thanks!!

This is a fantastic recipe! Hubby gave it 11 stars! 
After adding the crumb topping, I added blackberries and blueberries and loved the additional flavor they added.
(I used foil to keep in the moisture and then removed the foil for the last 5 minutes).

This is a great crisp,  there are times when it is a bit too wet and an extra Tablespoon of flour helps with it making  that perfect thickness with out making it gummy like cornstarch can make things.  Everyone loves it

I made the original recipe as it is written and thought it was WAY too sweet. Granted I used a mix of apples and eyeballed the amount of apples. Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar in the filling and the topping and add extra cinnamon.

This is my go to Crisp recipe. I have used it with various fruits and oatmeal types. I always (at least) halve the sugars as it is too sweet for our family's taste - we prefer to have the flavour of the fruit dominate. I also quadruple the cinnamon, at least. Sometimes I put a half more or so of the crumble, depending on my mood.

I added a tablespoon of lemon juice and vanilla to the apples, did not add water. Used white and brown sugar in crust and apples. Added nutmeg to the apples. Made 1 1/2 serving of crust. Used 7-8 apples.

I made this with a combination of green & red apples but made it otherwise as directed. It was absolutely delicious & now my family specifically asks me to make this for every holiday gathering!

Perfect!  My daughters (13 & 16) made this tonight with pears instead of apples.   The recipe is just right.  Easy to follow, not to sweet and great ratio of fruit to crumble. But Wow!  Don't think I'll ever make apple crumble again, Pear crumble is the way to go!

The best apple crisp ever! Doubled the crumb topping recipe and put a layer on the bottom and the top. Added half cup of pecans to the top layer of crumbs topping. Cut the water amount in half.    Excellent!! Will make again for sure

Made this for my family and it was a big hit!  The only change I made was add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Next time I think I will use less white sugar (1/2) as I personally like dessert less sweet.  I don't think my family will notice and it will be a little healthier .

This is so good and easy to make.  I increased the topping by half, decreased the water to 1/4 Cup (as others suggested), and added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg.  I increased the baking time by 20 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

As others commented, this is an easy and delicious recipe. The crisp was great on top and I recommend mixing that with your hands so the melted butter is distributed evenly throughout the crumbled oats, other ingredients and brown sugar. It was my first time making it so I followed exactly as written. I did see others suggest to cut the water in half and I wished I had - it's definitely a watered down consistency and the liquid part itself doesn't have much flavor to it. The apples and the crisp topping are delicious!

We added ice cream to the warm crisp and it was fabulous. I thought it was a tiny bit too sweet, but everyone loved it (8 adults & 2 kids). Four of my guest asked for the recipe. I will definitely make it again & again.

Per popular recommendation, I not only halved the water, I actually substituted it for brandy. I soaked the apples for an hour or so in the brandy before sprinkling them with the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  This is a great base recipe that allows you to play with. It was a huge success a luncheon with my girlfriends.

It was a delicious recipe, however it was extremely sweet! Probably my own fault as I didn't use Granny Smiths, but instead Red Delicious. 
Even if I were to use Granny Smiths, I would definitely cut down on the sugar!

Served last night at our July 4th celebration.  Big hit with everyone.  I followed a few of  the suggestions:  cut down on the sugar to about 3/4 cup, mixed the apples with cinnamon/sugar/flour, skipped the water and doubled the topping.  Delicious!

Amazing! I put a little too much butter which didn't make it crispy but it was still amazing! The smell alone while prepping was absolutely divine! And it was so easy to do I did a little fixing for my taste and added more cinnamon since I love the smell and taste of it and it was perfect! I served with French vanilla ice cream and it was perfection!

Really good recipe, went over well with my guests. I would reduce the sugar in both the apple mixture and topping next time but that's because I don't like things too sweet. As per other reviews I added more cinnamon (and put in both apples and topping) and also a dash of nutmeg.

I fourthed the recipe and ended up using 3 apples-2 granny smith one red. It turned out great! I wish the crumbles on top were a little crunchier... not sure how to change that. Serving it with ice cream is a must!

I added more cinnamon just a pinch to give it some kick and a smaller pinch of sugar to kinda even it out. Also I added another 1/4 cup of oats. And of course My ... SECRET ... ingredient!

Halfed the amount of water, doubled the cinnamon and used 3/4 of white sugar instead of the full cup...tasted awesome and found it to be a good balance with Granny Smith apples...definitely making this again :)

This was the best apple baked anything I have ever made. I'm telling you it was gone within 5 minutes. I didn't have baking oats so I used brown sugar oatmeal and I'm glad I did because it turned out great. I do recommend using less water because there was a lot still in the bottom. The crumble part that goes on last was the best, I enjoyed that more than the apples themselves??.

Will definitely make it again! Absolutely scrumptious! I followed one of the other commenters reccomendations. Double the crumble mixture and made bottom crust with half. Tossed apples with some of the cinnamon sugar mixture before placing on crust. Only used 1/4 cup water. It was wonderful and easy to make. Will definitely make it again! Thank you for a great recipe!

For  double batch:

- Coat apple (thick) slices with juice of three lemons.
- Finely grind 1 1/2 cups ca ne sugar in place of 2 cups white sugar.
- Use coconut sugar in place of brown sugar
- Use 4 tsp apple spice in place of cinnamon
- Add 1/8 tsp salt to topping mixture.
- Add 2 cups chopped pecans to topping mixture
- Use whole rolled oats in place of quick oats.
- Add 1 tsp vanilla extract to topping mixture.
- Beat 2 egg yolks, 6 oz  table cream, 1 tbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  Divide mixture in half and drizzle over both casseroles  before placing in oven.

Chill when done to help make topping  more crunchy.

This was great! After reading other reviews I added 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg and doubled the topping. I used Instant Apple Cinnamon Oats! Plus it was so easy!!!

Like many of the reviewers, I also decreased water to 1/4 cup,  and sugar in the apples to 3/4, cup. I added a little pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon.    My family likes the tang of granny smith's, added chopped nuts to the crumble, 1/2 -3/4 cup brown sugar in the the crumble.  With this revisions it's a perfect for my family apple crisp!

I have never made apple crisp before so I was thrilled with how it turned out. Got rave reviews from my family and friends! I followed the recipe exactly myself and used all Granny Smith apples. One thing I will say is that, at least for me, it took a lot longer than 30 minutes prep time. Peeling and cutting up all the apples took probably about an hour alone, and then another half hour or longer to get everything ready to put in the oven. That being said, it was very well worth it. Great recipe!

Certainly not my favorite.   I don't think that I would bother making this one again ... too heavy.  I prefer apple crisp recipes without flour ... just oats.

This was a wonderful recipe and loved by all who ate it! I did substitute Coconut flour for regular flour and used old fashioned oats as that is what I had on hand. I also cook/bake  with  coconut (palm) sugar.  I used 1 tsp of coconut flour in the mixture for the apples, and I doubled the ingredients for the topping so only 1/2 sifted coconut flour.  I also did some water being concerned it would be to dry with the coconut flour, but there was still water in the bottom of the pan.  I think you would need water if you did all granny smith. I had a mixture of granny smith and fuji. Some were very ripe and therefore I didn't need as much water.

This was a good recipe, although I didn't get why you had to pour water over the top. When I cut a piece out of the crisp, there was a deep pool of water and juice at the bottom of the pan. I would work on this by mixing the apples with flour separately to make it thicker.

I strongly agree with the comments that this crisp is far too sweet. The flavour of the apples was drowned out by the excess sugar.

I switched it up a wee bit with maple syrup instead of the full amount of white sugar and I added apple with the skins along with raspberries.. It turned out quite good... Extra cinnamon as I love that...

I thought this was very good. I made it exactly as written. I found this recipe looking for a way to use up a ton of apples leftover from a large fruit tray (a mixture of Granny Smith and what looked like Gala apples). It was a little sweeter than I'm used to but I agree with the reviewer that the amount of sugar and water in the ingredients are probably written for a tart Apple like Granny Smiths. The next time I make this I'll use all Granny Smiths and still use the recommended amount of sugar/water. But I will definetly be making this again!

This is very good with the exception of too much topping.    I will probably cut it in 1/2 for the next time.  I did add about a cup of craisins and it was really good.  My husband said "we are out of that apple stuff, are you going to make more?"    He also suggestec rhubarb for the next one.....I think I'll  do that!

I made this recipe exactly as written for Mother's Day. It was fabulous.  I served it warm with ice cream and whipped cream. Everyone loved it. A lot of people said to not add the water, but it makes it perfectly moist. The topping stayed crisp. Not too sweet for us either. I will definitely make it again soon!

I really enjoyed this recipe and had several compliments on it. As other people have mentioned, it did seem a bit watery (didn't make it any less enjoyable for me though!) Because of that, I may cut the water added down to 1/3 cup of water added next time, but otherwise, this was delicious and very much enjoyed!

My family really enjoyed this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious. I did make one intentional change and one unintentional change haha! I intentionally chopped the apples in small chunks rather than slicing them. The oopsie I made was that I didn't add any white sugar. I just noticed that when I went to write this review! We didn't miss it though! Very yummy.
I utilized my food processor for the topping and it came together nicely. 
I will surely make this again when I have a bunch of apples I need to use up. Thanks!

This recipe is a family favorite. The only thing I did was reduce the white sugar from 1 cup to 1/2 a cup.  I did that only because I found it was extremely sweet when I made it the first time.

4 stars only because there is way too much sugar in the recipe. 
I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup with the apples, and down to 1/2 cup for the crumble. An easy to make recipe. I used Granny Smith and Pink Lady.

Really good! Way to much sugar though. I cut it almost in half the first time I tried the recipe. Especially if you plan to eat it with ice cream or something else really sweet.

This was absolutely amazing.  I followed the directions and it was delicious!  There was nothing at all off with this, it was perfection.  I will make this often, it's quite easy.

I didn't need 12 servings so I adjusted it for 4.  Used Granny Smith apples.  I  did omit the water and added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  Also blended the apples with the sugar cinnamon mixture instead of pouring over the apples.  Adjusted the topping mixture for 6 servings and used a pastry blender to blend in the cold butter until topping was crumbly instead of melting the butter. (I like a crunchy topping).  Next time I  will add a little cinnamon- nutmeg and a few chopped pecans to the topping.  Didn't find it too sweet as some reviewers reported.  This dessert had a wonderfully   balanced sweet-tart flavor with just enough spice to combine them.   Thanks for sharing.

Best Apple Crisp ever! I make no changes. Every year after 4-H fruit sales I get out my apple peeler and start baking. My father who is a VERY picky eater loved it.

I love this one and always get rave reviews when I make it.  I think the only thing I do differently is to omit the water.  Mine is always moist  enough.  I think it would be really runny with the water.

Only change I made was adding a generous sprinkling of allspice and some chopped pecans to the topping.  I used Granny Smith apples, and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream while still warm. Absolutely delicious. Only change I would make is not using the water next time as it was a bit watery in the bottom, but still awesome. :)

I made this recipe following the directions exactly so rating on it without modifications.  The flavor was really good, however this recipe uses way too much water. It was like an apple soup with a crumble on top.  Next time I'll cut the water in half or eliminate all together.  Would've been a 5 star if it wasn't for that.

Made it with thawed sliced frozen apples and omitted the water as when I thawed the apples they were very juicy.  I like lots of cinnamon so I doubled it. I also doubled the topping as others suggested, but left the sugar at one cup.  Best apple crisp ever!

The recipe is good but I followed the comments about not adding water and doubling the topping. Way too sweet! I can't even taste the apples anymore.Next time, I'll not double the topping and I think I'll do 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of the full amount

Made this the other night. I halved the sugar, double the topping, and used 6 granny smith apples, and NO water. This made a HUGE serving in an 11x9 pan. It's just me and my boyfriend here so it was a little much for us! Freshly baked, the apples were a little tart but it was a good balance with the sugary topping. I refrigerated left over and reheated in the microwave. Somehow the topping was still crunchy! Yum! I let the topping sit for about 30 min after adding the melted butter before crumbling on top. I think that helped with the "crunch" factor. Also, I sliced each apple into 12 slices, (halved twice, then cut each piece into 3 slices). After 45 min the apples were REALLY soft. Next time I'll probably check after 35-40 min. Will definitely make again!!

Made this two nights ago.  Only made 8 cups of apples (I was only serving 2 people).  I wish I would of made more!  Everyone had second helpings!  And that says something about a dessert!  I took the advice of another user & used granny smith apples, and less water.  Also, I made the crumble top with butter that was softened at room temp instead of melted.  Turned out perfect!

In an 8" square pan, I put 5 Granny Smith apples, cutting back the white sugar to only 1/3 c and the water to only 1/4 c. Then I used the crumble as shown in the recipe. It took almost an hour for the fruit to bubble, so I lightly tented the crumble with foil for the first half hour or so, to avoid scorching. I am 60 years old and FINALLY have PERFECTED the apple crumble.

Awesome recipe.  I used Gala apples and reduced the white sugar to about half a cup. I followed the rest of the recipe as is. I used a 9x13 glass pan and had plenty of crumb. The fam enjoyed it.

This recipe is easy to make and taste great. This is a combination that I love. 
During the apple season this year I made 2 additional apple crisp and instead of baking them I froze them. For Thanksgiving I baked one of them and it was great. So many people complemented on how the apple crisp tasted.

I have made this twice,  and the first time when the topping wasn't at all crisp, I thought possibly I had made a mistake when measuring my ingredients. So a few weeks later,  I decided to make it again, with the results being exactly the same. Even after baking it longer, the topping was still not crisp. It taste and feels like there may just be too much flour for the amount of oats and butter.

It was just YUMMY.  Only,  I swapped out the water for apple juice, and reduced the amount to 1/4cup.  I would definitely recommend  trying it.

This was delicious! Especially the next day.

As always, before cooking I always check comments for tips on recipes. A lot of comments said to cut down the sugar tossed on the apples so I cut it down to 1/4 cup and it was a perfect amount of sweetness. I used half gala (probably why I needed less sugar) and half granny smith. I will make this again! Yummo

The topping was way too sweet, but made extra crisp with far less sugar. I think I'd cut the sugar added (both to the crisp and the apples) in half if I were to make it again.

Made as written using 4 varieties of apples. It was good but for my own personal  preference  I will not use granny smith  in it again without increasing  the amount of  sugar.

Delicious! Made this for the first time...I imagined eating it as if it came from a restaurant. Prepared 1/2 the recipe in a square pan. It came out a bit watery, but waiting a while to cool down it settled. I'm a sweet tooth person so the sweetness was about right. My husband thought it was too sweet and he's not a sweet tooth person.  I will cut the sugar from the apple mix next time. Granny apples worked great with this recipe.

This apple crisp is sooooo delicious - I made it the other night but cut the recipe in half for everything to make just 6 servings. The texture is both soft yet crunchy.  SERVE WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM! For the apples, make it with about 2/3 Granny Smith (more tart in taste/flavor) apples and 1/3 Golden delicious (more sweet). With this mix, you have a nice balanced apple taste. Some people on here say this recipe is too sweet but I think they could be using apples which are too sweet. I do love sweets, though so maybe I am biased. I have never been a fruit dessert sort of person but this apple crisp has changed my life. Even though I made it the other day, I am probably going to make it again today or tomorrow, I can't get enough.

The basic recipe itself is very good and easy, however I found it to be extremely extremely sweet and if you like your apple crisp with a scoop of french vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, it will be to sweet to eat. The next time I make it ,I will cut the white sugar in half. 

I will also double the crust recipe, because I was wishing there were more crust. 

 I also added a nutmeg, allspice, vanilla and a little cognac, which took the flavor to another level.

This is a perfect recipe!  No modifications necessary!  I used ordinary apples...nothing special and made this recipe twice and both times came out perfect.  Friends, family and a cooking class LOVED it.  Thank you for the recipe!

A good recipe; makes enough for a crowd.  I doubled the cinnamon and added ground cloves, nutmeg, and ginger, as well as chopped walnuts in the topping (pecans would also work well.)

This apple crisp is amazing. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was gone in 5 minutes. I have made it a few more times since then. I did buy caramel sauce to drizzle over the vanilla ice cream  which made it even better. Other than that I changed nothing and it was by far the best apple crisp I've ever had. Great recipe!!!

Super easy and delicious.  Made with Jonathan apples.  Could probably use less white sugar if you don't like things very sweet.  I always add more cinnamon then called for as I love cinnamon.  Put at least a 1/2 tsp in the topping as well.

The flavor is good but be careful how 'quick' your quick oats are. I used Quaker Oats 1-minute quick oats and it was too hard when I left it in there at the amount of time the recipe called for. When I used lesser time, it tasted like oatmeal on top of the apples. No Bueno. Next time I'll use a slower 'quick' oats.

Marvelous! We stuck very close to the recipe and we'd do it again. We used 3 granny smith and 3 honey crisp apples and left it in for about 55 minutes to get the top extra crispy. We also doubled the cinnamon. And for goodness' sake serve it will vanilla bean ice cream! This one's going in the books.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  And it was great!

Made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly.  To make 10 cups of apple slices, I used 3 granny smith apples and 1 Fuji apple.  They were all largeish apples, not small.

Initially when taking out of the oven, I thought it might be too watery.  But as it sat and cooled, it thickened and turned out fantastic.

Thanks for the recipe!

Double the topping, made when the kids came one night for dinner, used all Granny Smith apples. About 8 apples.  Yummy! I'm not a big fan of apples, but the topping made me enjoy this wonderful dish. Any leftovers were devoured for breakfast.

I made it for a party and followed the recipe exactly. I was not thrilled with the topping. Next time, I would eliminate the white sugar from the topping and make it all brown sugar and I would increase the amount of butter. I also like a bit of lemon zest in the apple filling. I did not add it and felt it would have made it better. I will make those adjustments and report back.

I halved this recipe because I only had 4 apples and wasn't looking to feed an army. I didn't change anything with the recipe and the flavor was great!! It was a tad to sweet for my liking so I may cut back the amount of sugar I used to mix with the apples but I wouldn't change the crisp part of it. I'm glad I didn't skip the water because my apples weren't very juicy so I'm sure it would've been dry. Also, my oats weren't cooked through. This may have been because when it cooked the juices didn't bubble up high enough to hit the crumble on top, my pan may have been to deep. So knowing what I know now, I will make adjustments to the next batch. Very good served hot with some vanilla ice cream on top!

Generally great, exactly what I would hope for an apple crisp dish to be. I made a few minor tweaks like others. I added some nutmeg and skipped the 1 cup white sugar. I also didn't peel the apples just to save on work. It didn't bother me at all, although my friend would have preferred it peeled. Delicious!

5 minutes before I pulled it out of the over, I poured a cube of melted butter over the top, sprinkled some sugar & cinnamon and let it finish baking.  

Rave reviews from the gang at work!  I served it warm with vanilla bean ice cream! 

YUMMMM!

Very tasty!  I didn't add water, but instead sprinkled about a tablespoon of lemon juice over the apples before adding the next "layer."  I didn't have quick oats, so used regular old-fashioned slow oats.  Also, used half the recommended sugar, as mentioned by others reviewers.   The result was still a touch bit watery for my taste but really flavorful!  The crumble topping is excellent!  I will make again!

So I found the amount of sugar was way to much. I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown. I added lemon juice to my apples cause I like the flavour and I added blueberries cause I had some in the freezer. Good base recipe but I had to make those changes to suit my family.

Very easy to make.  I did use an apple peeler corer, although, I think chucky apples would be great.  Very sweet and delicious on its own.  No ice cream needed.  My husband says this is a keeper.  That's a compliment coming from him.

I did not measure the apples, I just picked out about five (and they're small ish) and chopped them up and dumped the rest of the cranberries in a 13x9 and tossed with the sugar mix. I doubled the topping based on another review and thought it seemed like a TON of topping as I was mixing it up, but it turned out pretty darn good. I did also only use 1/4 cup of water and was happy with the liquid amount at the end of cooking. I think it's all about preference, if you prefer a good thick topping then double it but if you don't have enough ingredients the regular amount would be fine. If you prefer your crisp very juicy then use more water. Bravo to this recipe!

Delish and will def make again! Some changes I made- cut the sugar in half to go over the apples. Also the topping was too much and I ended up dumping some of it so I would cut back on the amount of topping to make as well.

Great recipe! Instead of just using apples, I did a mixture of pears and Granny Smith apples. I didn't add any water since I knew that the sugar would draw out a lot of the moisture from the fruits. I also cut the white sugar in half. Another thing I did different was I added all spice and nutmeg. After topping the apples and pears with the seasonings and white sugar, I actually mixed it all together to ensure that every slice had spices on it. I would definitely make again!

This was so easy and delicious. I did not make it exactly according to recipe. I adapted to our personal tastes and according to other reviewers suggestions. I doubled the crumble because we like more crust than fruit. I did not add the water. I overcooked slightly which I will try to correct next time I make.

Found this recipe overly sweet and the topping much too dry and gritty. Used Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples and followed directions exactly. I think there was far too much dry vs wet ingredients and either too much sugar/flour in the topping or not enough butter. Made this for a Thanksgiving party and even brought my own homemade vanilla ice cream. The ice cream went over well - the apple crisp was left on the plate. Wouldn't make it again or if I do, cut down on the dry ingredients to start.

Simple, and delicious. To make a wonderful cranberry apple  crisp simply add 3 cups of fresh cranberries, and increase sugar by 1/4 cup. Or, don't add extra sugar for more tartness.

Omitting the water would help. The flavor is good but the crumb top defy leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't care for that as much.

Two of my three roommates are gluten intolerant and so I made this using gluten free baking flour (1:1 as instructed per packaging). I feel like if I'd used regular flour it would have been excellent but unfortunately I can taste that I altered the ingredients :/ I did what most others did; less water, twice as much crust, and about 6 Granny Smith apples. Looking forward to trying this out again WITH gluten :)

The apple crisp turned out really really good.  I made it in an 8 x 12 baking dish instead of 9x13 and I used 7 small red Gala apples. The only thing I would change is adding a little less water, about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2. If you use the smaller pan, bake for 36 mins. Overall, very delicious and just enough sweetness!

This recipe is a knock-out! The only change I made was that I doubled up on the crumble topping. Very easy to make and everyone loved it!

Absolutely delicious! I added a bit more cinnamon than the recipe called for- probably close to 2 teaspoon- I put some with the apple mix and some with the oatmeal mix. I served it with Schwanns Caramel sea salt and Cashew ice cream and it was to die for! My guest said it was better than any restaurant dessert he'd ever eaten! I used HoneyCrisp apples!

I made this according to the original recipe with no changes and loved it. I didn't measure the apples because I am a lazy human being, but I covered the bottom of the 9x13 with apple slices just until I couldn't see the glass anymore and that seemed to be the perfect amount. I would definitely make this again!

This is great. I used a lot of apples and the biggest pan I had. I would also recommend granny smith apples, but I used a variety.  I cut the sugar by a lot (maybe half) because I didn't think that much sugar was necessary and I think it worked well. I prefer a less sweet dessert. Also since this had oatmeal and since I had so much leftover, I might have eaten it for breakfast a few times.

I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup because we like a little more of a tart flavor. Otherwise it was spot on!

Very very good recipe. I halved the amount of apples and kept the crisp the same... Just used a smaller dish. I took advice from the reviews and tossed the apples with the flour and left out the water. I also used less than half the recommended white sugar (it really doesn't need a ton). I've always been an apple pie gal but I think I'm hooked on this. No pastry to deal with and it's SUPER yummy. I may try adding dried cranberries to the apples next time...

I found out late into the process that my oats were stale so I substituted unsweetened shredded coconut. It turned out to be as wonderful, if not better! I'm using this recipe from now on. My daughter loved it!

I used a sweet thin skinned apple and left the skin on. It was too sweet. Next time I will cut down on the sugar and use a tart green apple.  As noted in other reviews, try leaving out the water.

Fabulous!  I made this last night and it was a HUGE hit. My boys were both in town so I made this for dessert. The only mistake I made was to make only half the recipe. Big mistake!  This was gone in an hour!  So today I'll be making another batch, but this time a full recipe. Absolutely the best apple crisp ever!

Was delicious, especially served warm with vanilla ice cream. You know it's a good recipe when it tastes just as good the next few days! Cut water in 1/2 like most reviewers have been saying. It was pretty sweet to me, so doubling the crumble would've been a bit much in my opinion. I think that the apples are the highlight of the dessert. Awesome recipe.

I made it exactly as is.  First of all there was too much liquid.  Next time I won't add water over the apples.  Second, the crumb topping was not crispy. Cutting cold butter into the oat mixture instead of using melted butter will help crisp it up.  Third, there was no salt in the crumb topping, which left it tasting very one-dimensional.  It needs salt.  Lastly, it was very sweet.  I liked the sweetness of the crumb topping, but the white sugar over the apples was too much.

This recipe is delicious! My husband said it was better than apple pie. I did half it since it was just the two of us. I halved the apples and the ingredients for the filling but kept the topping ingredients the same after reading the reviews. I did add some caramel topping to the filling and left out the water. After removing from the oven, I drizzled it  with caramel. I baked it  in a 8 x 8 dish and cooked it at 350 degrees  for the 45 minutes. This recipe is a keeper!

This was my first time making this recipe and it was amazing. I didn't add the water because ive never done that before but I kept everything else the same and it came out really good.

We used Granny Smith apples, instead of all white sugar, used half white, half brown in the apples.  I didn't have quick oats, just old fashioned and I don't think it made a difference at all.  I did add a little extra cinnamon.  It was excellent.

This is now my "go to" apple crisp.  I love it!  I make this in 9x13 tin pans then freeze.  I set them out the day before and cook 1 hr 15 min the next day because it's still a bit frozen.  I love taking this to pot lucks.  It's very sweet and great even without ice cream.  I follow as in and don't change anything!  Thanks!

This apple crisp is quite delicious.  I did make some minor changes. Because I used sweeter apples, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup and I used all brown sugar because my husband likes it's a little more caramelly. 
Overall, I will totally make this again. Served warm with some whipped cream, it really hit the spot!

Yeah ..so....I think using sugar in the raw is probably not a good idea in place of brown sugar, the mix came out of the oven extremely watery.  I'm gonna try this again in a couple of days.

This is good. I made 2 at the same time, cooked one a little longer than in the instructions. The one I cooked longer turned out better, because it wasn't soupy like the other. Also, it was very, very sweet. Too much sugar, maybe?

I've been making this for years to rave reviews.  Slight changes I've made are cutting the white sugar to 1/2 cup (I don't miss it and could even use a bit less) and cutting water to 1/4 cup (I don't like it runny). I also used 5 cups of THINLY  sliced Granny Smith and 5 cups THICKLY sliced Mcintosh....these 2 combine for a great taste, neither too sweet nor too tart.

I used honey crisp apples, and cut the white sugar amount in half.  I made double the crispy topping and put half in the bottom of the pan to start, and the rest on the top at the end.  I also tucked about 6-8 Kraft caramel squares into the apple mixture.  Made for a surprise creamy treat!  My family loved it.  They want me to make it again for Thanksgiving.

I just made this but haven't tasted it yet but I just want to point out that if you alter the quantity the flour doesn't change for the topping.  I.e. I changed it to 4 servings and it changed the flour to 1/3 cup but in the instructions for the topping it still listed a full cup of flour which I realized too late so I didn't use all of the topping.  I'm hoping it'll be ok. But I love this site for being able to change servings and I don't have to use math skills! Ok it came out really good.  Not too sweet and I used pumpkin pie spice with a little extra nutmeg.  Flavor is fantastic!

Loved the recipe but with  with a few modifcations as mentioned by a fellow reviewer. The water is unnecessary. My own rake is that the initial white sugar/ cinnamon mix can be reduced to a half cup of white sugar and for the topping doubling the oats and butter make  it perfect.

Added nutmeg and deceased the sugar quite a bit. Used pecans in the topping. I used apple cider in the place of water. Taste was awesome but came out with too much liquid still after it cooked(could be the types of apples) . I will decrease the liquid next time.

I made this Apple Crisp the other day and it was absolutely the best! I used Winesap apples and the amount of sugar was good. I appreciate the fact that there is a generous amount of oats on top, my favorite. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

Perfect Apple Crisp!  I omit the water and it always comes out perfect with just the right amount of sauce.  I love the topping when it has larger crumbles.  They get nice and crisp and delish!

Absolutely delicious! Though I feel the original recipe would be wonderful, I made just a few small adjustments based on personal taste and previous reviews. I cut back on the white sugar to about 3/4 cup and was a bit generous with the cinnamon and the oatmeal. I loved how it came out, as did everyone who came to dinner.

The only thing I changed was I doubled the topping and didn't add water since so many other reviews suggested this. It was way too sweet for my liking, I won't make it again.

I just want to note that so many people mentioned to cut back on or cut out the water.  That will depend on how juicy your apples are.  I recently got apples to make pie and the pie filling was so dry.  Other times, I need to add flour because the apples are so juicy.  You really just need to gauge the amount of water by the juiciness of your apples.

I made this recipe with the topping doubled per multiple suggestions.  Upon making this at 5:30 a.m. and figuring out I had no brown sugar, I made a substitution that appears to have been fortuitous. Instead of brown sugar, I used "Sugar in the Raw". It seemed to give a sweet crunchy texture to the topping. My co-workers raved about it! So this is the first time I have ever posted about a recipe change. This was a hit in my baking world and hope it helps!

Absolutely delicious!
I only used half the sugar & brown sugar because we had so many sweet dishes that night. For me, it would have been way too sweet if I had used all the sugar in the recipe.
I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt, mmmmmm!

Delicious! (I of course always add more cinnamon plus I put a little lemon on my apples). I did mix all the base ingredients right in with the apples. After baking I did think it was a tiny bit juicy, so would cut down water but not a big deal

This recipe was simple enough to make and very tasty. My only objection was that in order to make the apples tender, I had to cook it a bit longer than suggested and then the oatmeal crisp topping became hard.

I halved the recipe for my small family and used a gluten free flour blend. I did use the water and did not find it too watery.  I cut the amount of white sugar by about 2/3.  It was very good!

This recipe is amazing. On the advice of others, I doubled the topping, mixed the apples with the sugar and cinnamon mixture, and added fresh nutmeg. I also included fresh lemon juice (1/8 of a cup; I halved the recipe since there were only 3 of us). Did not add water. Put 1/4 of the topping on the bottom, then the apples, and the the remaining topping. Also sprinkled a small amount of raisins on top of the apples before adding the topping. Awesome recipe!

I've made this several times and it just keeps getting better. I made a couple of modifications. I use only 1/2 cup of white sugar as 1 cup was waaaay too much (and I'm a sugar freak, so that says a lot lol). I also use a little more butter in mixing the oats, about 1/4 cup more. There will be a lot of water in the bottom of the dish when you first take it out of the oven. As it cools it thickens and makes a yummy sauce. If you spoon the water over the oats before it has a chance to cool it just makes it even better!

Half recipe with gluten free all purpose flour on the apples. Used food processor for crumble and it turned out perfectly. Processed gluten free oats for a bit first. Then added other ingredients and pulsed. Then added melted butter to pulse again.

Great recipe!  I did read the reviews first, so I also cut the white sugar in half and doubled the crust. I put the apples in a large bowl first and sprinkled a few drops of lemon juice over them to prevent them from immediately turning brown and to add a bit of moisture.  Then, I added the white sugar, flour, cinnamon, and a mixed cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange peel spice blend over them, along with a tablespoon of butter cut up into small cubes. After mixing everything and coating the apples nicely (and tasting them), I poured the apple mixture into a greased 9x13 dish.  I omitted the water and sprinkled the topping over the apples.  The baking time of 45 minutes was perfect! It turned out perfectly, the apples were not overly sweet and still retained that fresh apple tang and taste; the crust was perfectly crunchy, sweet, and buttery.  I will definitely keep this as my apple crisp recipe!

Very easily made, lessened the amount of sugar slightly.sprinkled cinnamon on top just as it was going in the oven.My home smelled wonderful as the dish was baking.We all loved it and I will continue to use the recipe in the future.

Delicious, a little time intensive but worth it!  Used Granny Smith apples.  Three pounds was just right.

This is so yummy.....Baked it this morning.  Followed recipe
except cut back on white sugar to 1/2 cup and doubled the crisp topping..  I love the sweet and tart of Granny Smith apples.  Did not have a problem with adding the water gave it a delightful syrup to the dish and was awesome over the extra crisp topping...This is going to be added to Thanksgiving fare and I am sure it will be around at Christmas as well this year.  

Thank you, thank you !!

It's delicious. However, it does not need any water. I added about 1/2 cup instead of the full cup and it was still too much liquid. Not the consistency I wanted! I also cut the white sugar in half. Only cooked it for about 35 minutes and it was done. Overall, it's yummy but could be better.

Best apple crisp I've ever made! I used Empire apples and they were perfect. I added the water but I regret it-the bottom was a little soupy. Next time I make it again (and there WILL be a next time!) I will omit the water. Love that it makes a full 9 x 13 pan.

I took the advice of a few other reviewers.  Since I had MacIntosh and Cortland apples, which are not as sour as Granny Smith apples, I cut the white sugar by half.  I also tossed the apples in the white sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and didn't just sprinkle it over; this drew out the juice in the apples, and there was no need to add the water.  Finally, I doubled the topping, and there was plenty, maybe a little too much on top for my liking.  Because of the doubled topping, I baked it at 375° for 50 minutes.  I brought this to work, and it was gone in a half hour.  Next time, I might try what another reviewer did, and put half the doubled topping on the bottom of the pan and half on top of the apples.  This is a keeper!

Super easy to make and fun as well. I made this with my 2 yr old, she had a blast mixing the dry ingredients. The only thing I would change is the amount of water it calls for, I would use 1/3 or 1/4 of water next time. Besides that this recipe is great!

I made this true to the recipe and didn't change anything-- only added a few dashes of salt on the top when it was done baking which I liked! Will definitely make it again! Although it was super delicious, I may try adding nutmeg to the apple mixture and pecans to the crumble topping!!

Really this is absolutely amazing but far too sweet. I'm going to make it again without so much sugar. I did use gluten free certified oats and dairy-free buttery sticks.  I would have given it an easy five star if I weren't feeling unwell from all the sugar!

I made this and it was very well received. I had to cook it a bit longer and some of the interior of the dish wasn't as cooked as it could have been. Otherwise, the topping was excellent and a very simple dish to put together for a dinner for 12.

I found this recipe to be way WAY WAY to sweet.  If you used very tart apples perhaps it would be ok.  But between the cup of sugar and water in the apples it was a syrup soup on the bottom.  I also found there wasn't enough butter to make a nice hold together topping, mine ended up lose and powdery on top, it mixed well with the soup on the bottom, but I won't make this again.

This recipe is delicious.  I only did half of everything as my pan was smaller and I did find it a little bit too sweet but will definitely make this again, just with less sugar. Absolutely lovely crunchy topping.  Smelt lovely whilst cooking. Would recommend to everyone.

Delicious! I used 15 small gala apples.  I cut the white sugar down to 1/4 c and the water down to 1/4 c.  I increased the cinnamon to 2 t and added 1/2 t of nutmeg.  I left the topping as listed and baked it for 25 minutes before serving it with vanilla ice cream.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Really great recipe! It didn't need 45 mins in the oven. 30 mins would do. My apples turned out a bit mushy for my liking. Will try this recipe again with the adjustment of time.

This recipe is amazing. To customize it a bit, I often add a handful of cranberries or substitute some of the apples for pears our nectarines. For the topping, I prefer rolled oats and I often add chopped almonds or pecans.

This might be the most delicious dessert I have ever made. Used 8 large Cortlandt apples, only 1/4 cup water, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg in the spice mixture, and replaced instant oats with old fashioned oats. I also doubled the topping - YUM. I will never look for another Apple Crisp recipe!

Was almost perfect just a little to sweet, next time I will try cutting back a little on the sugar. I also only put 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup, and made 1.5 times the topping I also used slightly soften butter instead of melted and the topping came out great.

Yum!  I wanted a thicker topping like some other reviewers had mentioned so I only used 7 cups of apples.  I followed the rest of the recipe.  Very good!

This was the first time making this recipe.  It was delicious!  Love the way you can adjust the number of servings and the recipe is all adjusted for you.  The only thing I did different was omit the water, came out perfect!!

This is my favorite recipe for Apple crisp, the only change I make is I use packets of Quaker instant oatmeal cinnamon and spice. Everyone loves it and request we make it for parties and holidays!

Used half the white sugar and a drizzle of water.  It could have been even less water and sugar but is excellent!

very happy with this- It's a keeper! I omitted the water as many reviews suggested.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and changed the sugar to 1/2 brown and white respectively.  I've tried several recipes only to be disappointed and this one is spot on.  Thank you!!

Other than not peeling my apples, and using just a splash of water rather than 1/4 cup, I followed recipe exactly, and it was enjoyed by the whole family.

Excellent recipe! I did add my own touches (added ginger with the cinnamon in the apples, added cinnamon to the topping, baked at 375 degrees to caramelize the filling). I also had to halve the recipe as there are only three of us in this household. As my eight year old says, this one has to be made again!

This is a good recipe with a few minor adjustments.  You have to adjust the amount of sugar you add to the apples depending on what kind you use and your tastes.  I can't imagine using a whole cup of sugar for any apples.  Galas and Fujis get about 1/4 cup and Granny Smith get about 3/4 cup, at least in our house.  I only use 1/4 cup of water because I like a tight crisp.  I don't melt the butter, but cut it in with a pastry blender.  Also add a dash of cloves.  I often adapt it to be gluten free with a 1 to 1 rice flour and it's always a hit.  Depending on how many apples I use, sometimes I do 1 1/2 times the topping.

This is a fantastic recipe although I found that that it was a bit sweet and too much water.  I amended the recipe the second time as follows:

Cut the white sugar in half.
Cut the water in half
Added raisins - lots of raisin
Added more cinnamon
Drizzled good Canadian maple syrup on the apples before adding the top ingredients.

Maple syrup is a better way to add sweetness than refined whole sugar and tastes great with apples. 

This recipe is so easy to make and feeds the family over the weekend

LOVE this simple recipe.  Cut the 1 cup of sugar for the apples down to 1/2 cup and it was perfectly sweet.  I had a sweeter apple, so 1 cup would have been toe curling sweet.  Also for the topping, I cut the butter in rather than melting it and pouring it in and cooked for closer to an hour.
Delicious fall dessert!

Delicious! My family ate it in a day. I used Gala apples, so nearly eliminated the white sugar, just sprinkled it over the slices along with some cinnamon. Also added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the crisp.

This recipe is good BUT in my experience do NOT cut back on the water. It came out on the dry side. I guess different apples vary in moisture so to be on the safe side add the recommended amount of water. It was still very good but a moister apple crisp would have been perfect!

I had a whole bunch of granny smith apples and a few assorted other softer apples that I didn't really want to eat fresh, but they made a mighty fine crisp. I appreciated the reviewers who mentioned that more sugar might be necessary for cooking apples and less for eating apples. I ended up using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in with the apples, and I think I could have reduced it a bit and done just fine. Also I've never put water in my crumble, but I have put lemon juice, so I tried 1/4 cup of water and it worked very nicely. The topping: I followed advice to not melt the butter. Instead I let it soften a bit, cut it into bits and threw the whole works into the food processor to blend it, as I have no patience to cut in the butter by hand. I used 1.2 kg or about 9 cups of apples in a 9x13 pan, and I found that to be a good filling to topping ratio. I will use this recipe again, with or without variations such as nuts in the topping. Thanks.

Very yummy, but probably could have used half the water. I made with freshly picked Cortland and Jonathan apples and sweetness was just right. The only oatmeal I had in the house was steelcut and it gave the crumble a little extra texture. I liked it.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe, added a bit of nutmeg,  doubled the topping, but it was a bit too much.  Next time I would use 1.5 times the topping.  Baked at 350 for 60 min.

Way too sweet/way too watery!  I had a bunch of very tart apples and thought this recipe would work well because it has so much sugar in it, boy was I wrong!   I am definitely a sugar eater.   We drink sodas and eat an assortment of desserts at our house on a regular, and often daily, basis.    But this recipe is WAY TOO SWEET.  Another issue is that it's way too watery.  My normal apple crisp doesn't call for any water at all.  I should've known better than pour 1/2 cup of water on this.  I thought that since it got so many good reviews it would be good.... wrong!

Amazing. Followed the others comments...did not add the water and only put half the sugar. I also didn't have enough apples on hand, I used a mix of apples, strawberries and blueberries.

OMG this is so good!   I took the advice of other reviewers and added a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, used granny smith apples and did double the topping but I think it would be just as good using 1 1/2 times the topping recipe listed.  It took a full bag of small size granny smith apples to make. The first time I made it I added 1/4 cup of water and the second time no extra water.  Both ways are great right out of the oven but the sauce thickens after cooling and really does need the extra 1/4 cup of water especially when you re-heat it later, but I think 1/2 cup of water is a bit to much since the apples make liquid as they bake.  The water helps keep it from being to dry when you re-heat it a day or two later in the microwave.  I think adding 1/2 cup of extra water might make it to soupy.  I also think the next time I make it I'll try using half granulated white sugar and half light brown sugar for a more caramel flavor.  This makes a full 13x9-inch pan so if you want less you might want to half the recipe.  It also warms up beautifully in the microwave and tastes as good 2 days later as when you first took it out of the oven.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream would really put it over the top.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Yes it's that good!  I've been cooking and baking for 58 years and this is the absolute best apple crisp I have ever tasted or made and I've made several of them over the years.  It's the only one I'll be making from now on.  Thanks so much for sharing this wond

This tastes like apple cider crisp.  It is so, SO, good.  I made changes (because don't we all), I only added 1/4 cup of sugar on top of the apples--I like a little tart.  I didn't add water, either.  It turned out so amazing--especially topped with a little whipped cream.  (Out of Ice Cream from a late night binge last week.  Oops.)

I halved the recipe and used a 9 inch pie plate for it.
The amount of sugar, both in the apples and in the topping sounded like too much, so I cut it by half and the dessert was sweet enough for us. We served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream

I made this recipe several times this summer with some home grown apples from my friend's farm. They were slightly tart and so it made it perfect with the sugar and sweetness from the recipe. Definitely will use this recipe more.

I made this recipe two days ahead and kept in the fridge,  covered in foil. It turned out as if I made it an hour before. Also, I did not add any water and had a lovely sauce with its own juices.

I read all the reviews beforehand. Since it was a desert for 4 people, I reduced the apples to 8 cups.  I omitted the water as suggested and halved the white sugar. Otherwise all measurements were according to the recipe and it turned out awesome. I am making it again today and will try to get a picture before the vultures descend.

My Family loved this.  I doubled the crumble topping as others suggested and found it was WAY too much.  The top of my pan was completely covered and I ended up throwing it away.  I also mixed the sugar, flour and cinnamon together and poured over the apples.  I did not add any water.  The Apple Crisp was so delicious and so easy.  A great way to use up some excess apples.

This apple crisp was sooo good!  My first time making it, so I was a little nervous when serving it to my guests.  Big hit with everyone.  House smelling amazingly was a perk.  Will make again for sure.  Thank you so much for this  recipe.

This was amazing, I thought I'd try something a little different and I liked it.  I just cut up the apples, no pealing, and mixed that sugar/flour/cinnamon/water base together and stirred in the apples to make sure all were coated.  I have a 9x13 slow cooker and used that.  With the soaked apples in, covered with the mixed topping and cooked on high for 3 hours and it was magic.  The apples were soft and the topping moist but cooked, it was GOOD!

Excellent recipe, I particularly liked the melting of the butter rather than cutting it into the flour.  I made a few changes; I doubled the amount of flour to the sugar, cutting the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  This thickened the sauce more.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon in with the white sugar.  I doubled the topping but it could have been just 1.5 instead of doubling.  I only used 8 cups of pippin apples, leaving room for the extra topping.  I added two cups of walnuts, coarsely chopped, to the topping mixture.  When baking with walnuts, I always toast them in the oven on a baking sheet at 200 degrees for about an hour to give them added flavor.  I also added one teaspoon of vanilla extract to the topping.

I messed up....Laugh Out Loud I forgot to put my flour in the crumble topping so here I was sprinkling flour on the top just before I threw it in the oven.  Like everyone else I doubled the topping recipe and I ran out of butter so all I put was a 1/2 c. butter but I added a little water to the crumble topping.....this is still quite delicious and I cant wait to make it the right way :) 

exquisite with a dollop or two of ice cream on top....

This is my go to apple crisp recipe that is now our families favorite dessert! Don't change a thing, (tho you can always up cinnamon...try a dash of nutmeg! Mmmmm. The crumble topping  is so good, this time I'm increasing it!  (1 1/2 cups each of oats/brown sugar/flour... 1 1/2 sticks of butter). I use 11 "lunchbox sized" Granny Smiths. Top with whipcream vanilla icecream while it's still warm! (Reheats great too if you have leftovers)

I used this with fresh picked wild apples and since my hubby doesn't do refined sugar I substituted the white sugar for 3/4 C dark pure maple syrup and left the water out and the brown sugar for Palm sugar. it turned out great!

This was a great quick dessert that went well with vanilla ice cream.  I would suggest using the granny smith apples to offset the sweetness of the dish and to hold the shape of the apple slices.

It was wonderful!!! I used baking apples (green pippins) and a couple of fuji's I had laying around.  I made it as instructed.  It was perfect.  We used the juice to pour over the ice cream apple combo, it was perfect!  Next time I will add some raisins and walnuts, just because I think it would be delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious.  I've made it 3 times.  The first time as is but I thought there was too much sugar and water.  Still delicious as is which is why I gave it 5 stars.  The second time I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, did not use any water and added walnuts to topping.  Third time I reduced sugar to half cup, no water and added walnuts to topping.  This was the best so far.  I may still reduce sugar further.  The applies from my tree are really sweet and juicy so I think it really depends on what kind you use.  I don't know what kind they are but they look similar to Fuji.

Best apple crisp EVER! So delicious....and the crisp part was actually crispy. I could even hear the crunching sound when I was cutting myself a huge slice to test it out about an hour after it came out of the oven. 
The changes I made, was that I doubled the crisp portion of the recipe, and used a bit more than 10 cups of apples (probably closer to 12).  I used 2 types of mystery apples that came off nearby trees. (Half were mostly green, very large, and quite tart. The other half were smaller, a bit sweeter, and very red and delicious to eat as is). I also tossed the apples,  sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl first. (I did not add water to the apples either.) With the crisp part being doubled, I put half of it into the dish first and pressed it down, then spread the apple mixture on top of that, then spread the remaining crisp mixture on top. I was hard pressed to get it to fit in a 9x13, pan (so I pressed the crumble mixture hard into the dish  lol.)  Anyways in the end it fit, but it was kinda heaping in the middle. But I just put a cookie sheet on the rack below it to catch anything that that dripped out. The end result? Fantastic!

I used Gravenstein apples from the farmers market.  I must have cut some too thin because some pieces came out a bit too mushy for my taste.  Next time I'll all the slices thicker for more of a bite.   I added extra cinnamon and some freshly grated nutmeg.  I cut down the sugar as we like a tart crisp.  Served warm with vanilla bean ice cream.  Delicious!

I like to cut some of the apple up into very small pieces to fill in the spaces between the large slices so they cook down into a nice gooey apple filling.

A+  The expert pie bakers in my family loved this.  I used Granny Smith apples so not overly sweet. Added nutmeg to cinnamon sugar mix, left out water, and added pecans to crisp topping as suggested in other reviews - perfect. Also made this in glass pie dish with apple's piled high like a regular pie - came out perfectly with no bubble over at all.  Also used same recipe to make a rhubarb version - perfectly tart.  Small peach version is in oven now.

This is the best!! I made the recipe by doubling the crumble topping and adding about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg over the top of the apples. Delicious!! Also, since my family and I prefer a more crispy crumble topping, I put my oven on broil for about a minute before I took the crisp out. It turned out perfect, I will for sure use this recipe many times again in the future(:

Great recipe! I read the other reviews and opted to not add water, this was a good call. When I was peeling and slicing the apples I just put them in water so they didn't get brown. I drained the water and what was left on the apples was plenty. I also added the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg recommend by another review. ??

This apple crisp is great! The only thing I would change would be the amount of sugar. I found it a bit too sugary for MY taste. Other then that, give it a go!

I cooked the apple mixture on the stove before adding the crumble mixture and placing it in the oven. Pie has a lot of liquid and next time I'm going to omit the water. It is very good and yes we did have it warm with ice cream. Yummy.

Don't do what I did...forgot the ice cream :( and bake and eat it early in the day, not @10:00 PM at night. Easy peasy recipe and so delish. I reduced my white sugar to 1/4 cup but everything else much as per the recipe. Still delicious in the end.

I read some reviewers suggestions and used 1/4 cup of water and doubled the crumble topping and got rave reviews from co-workers at our office pot luck.  This is very sweet but is amazingly good.  I will definitely be making this again.  Loved it!

I have been cooking too long to measure anything, but used this recipe as a guideline.  It's a great foundation recipe once it's tweaked to your taste, and I concur, WAY too much sugar in the original, but still a winner!

Best apple crisp.  I did double topping because my husband loves the crunch .  The best  tip I read was to add the butter in pieces and not melt it.  There are just  2 of us and the topping stayed crisp all week while we ate it.  Also easy to half the recipe.

A decent apple crisp. I used a little less sugar. The rest of the recipe is similar to my original (which I don't measure out). I think this is a good recipe for beginners.

I made this last night for my family and it was a big hit with everyone. I made a smaller amount, using a pie pan... so for the filling, I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and the water to 1/3 cup (I also used older 'gala' apples 'on their last leg'). For the crumble topping, I reduced the amount of oatmeal, flour, & brown sugar to 3/4 cup each. I had a lot of crumble topping which was good (at least 1/2" thick crumble crisp fully covered the top of pie). The apple crisp was still a bit too sweet, which my son thought was wonderful. I should have reduced the sugars a bit more, especially since I used 'gala' apples - they are already sweet. Next time, if I'm using 'gala' apples and cooking the same amount, I'll further reduce both the white sugar used in filling and the brown sugar used in crumble topping, to 1/2 cup each. It will still taste sweetly yummy and I doubt my son will notice the difference. We ate it as it was...no ice cream and it was delicious. I have no doubt it will be a fabulous taste treat when eaten with vanilla ice cream. I plan to make it again and eat it with ice cream soon. This recipe is a 'keeper'. I don't need look for another apple crisp recipe version.

This is now our standard apple/fruit crisp recipe. It is the right level of sweetness and you can play with the sweetness for your own palate.  The main reason though that I like it, is that the crisp is dead easy to put together.  Not that blending with a pastry blender is difficult but its one more tool.  Plus, the crisp always brown beautifully, and stays on top of the crisp.  From start to oven its about 15 minutes.  I add a little bit of cinnamon in the crisp part from time to time.  Some people say skip the water, but for my kids they like the sauce it makes way better than without the water.  Great recipe.

Had a serious craving for apple crisp so I pulled up this recipe, preheated the oven , prepared the apples and started collecting the rest of the ingredients only to realize I was Out of Oats!! I happened to have two packets of instant banana walnut oatmeal, so I used that. WOw'Ee!! It was sublimely delicious! I believe I may actually do that again but on purpose next time!  (full disclosure, I added nutmeg and halved the water).

Thank you, Diane, for such a great recipe! I had a bowl of a Granny Smiths that were becoming a bit too ripe - had all the ingredients for this on hand, and vanilla ice cream in the freezer, to boot! YUM! Do not change a thing! Perfect, as is! Hardest part was peeling all of the apples. Well worth it! I will be making this one often!

This is a great recipe, but way too sweet.  I used granny smith apples and the 1 cup of sugar that you mix with the apples is too much.  Next time I'll cut it in half or maybe down to a 1/4 cup.  I added 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 and it was perfect.  Also, I followed other reviews and doubled the topping, but it made so much that I didn't add it all.  I think I added about 1.5 times the topping and even that was a little thick.  I will definitely make this again.  Delish!

Omg!!! I made this this morning for the kids and it is absolutely amazing!!! Best I've ever had. I "tweaked" the recipe a little. I added nutmeg and mixed it into the sugar mixture then tossed the apples in it. I also doubled the topping and added crushed almonds. Instead of the water I used unsweetened Apple juice. It came out so good. I well deff make this again.

Followed recipe exactly for Halloween dessert.  It's really sweet. I'll make it again but definitely reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup over apples.

Made this for my family. Everyone asked for seconds. The only thing I did differently was use brown sugar instead of white. And had some fresh oranges that I didn't want to go bad so I used them instead of water.

I have made this recipe twice now and it has been a great hit at both parties. The water is something I normally don't put in a crisp, but it made the crisp  nice juicy, DELICIOUS !!!!

I haven't had apple crisp in years.  So I saw this recipe and made it for dessert.  It was simple to prepare and baked it while everyone was having dinner.  It came out great and everyone enjoyed it.  Definitely making it again.  Thanks for posting the recipe, keeper.

Delish, even my husband loved it , every year we Apple pick and he picks in me saying. Oh it's Apple mush time :-) not this year it was fabulous. 
The only thing I changed was I doubled the crisp, not the apple part and I also didn't add water because I added my apple mixture and then let the apple just sit for 3 hours.

I made it with half Bartlett pear and half Granny Smith apple which was a nice mix of tart and sweet.  I left out the water and sugar from the fruit part and halved the sugar from the topping. (I used brown sugar as well). Even with that I found it a tad too sweet but that's just my personal taste. My boyfriend found the sweetness level to be just fine and suggested some corn starch or arrowroot in the fruit mixture to make it less watery. I also added a little bit of shredded coconut and cinnamon to the topping. It might have been less watery if I used just apples. It's a good recipe though. I will make it again!

Very good! Good ratios and it seems to work every time. Follow the recipe and you will have a great apple crisp. Use the same topping for other fruit crisps; it works out great.

Fantastic! This is my new go to recipe for apple crisp. I, too, omitted the water and used brown sugar instead of white since I never use white sugar. Next time, I will cut down on the amount of sugar with the apples as it was a bit sweeter than I like, but it is super yummy! Guilty secret: the leftovers are incredible the next day heated up with cream for breakfast!

I made the recipe just like it said to. I thought it was really good! I do think the next time I make it I will make sure to use  granny smith apples. I used sun crisp apples and it was still good,but with all the sugar a crisp tart apple would be better. I would also double the topping,only use 1/4cup water. Definitely  a keeper.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I have never made apple crisp before and was not disappointed.  The topping was so crunchy and delicious.  I would definitely reduce the amount of white sugar by half next time around.  It was super sweet and I am not a big fan of very sweet but that is a personal preference of mine.  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy delicious apple crisp.

I made this to bring to my parents anniversary party and it was a big hit! Everyone raved about how delicious it was. I used Granny Smith Apples and followed the recipe as stated but chose to add chopped walnuts to it as well for extra crunch. Very delicious! :)

It is so simple to make, my little kid helped me (and snuck pieces of the apple and the crumble). And it is quite delicious!

Amazing! The pan only lasted a day and a half! Only thing I will do different next time would be to melt more butter for the topping.

We made this with honey crisp apples and it was tart and perfect. However, I used 1/4 cup water and will omit all the water next time.

I've made apple crisp for years and never had one call for water of any kind til this one. I gave it a go even though I had my doubts about adding water considering apples tend to bring their own juices once it starts cooking. Well, I made it and as I figured too much water! To be honest, there really isn't any need to add water when your using juicy apples. Oh well, it still was good just a lil soggy.

This was sooo delicious. I took the advice from the other reviews and I didn't eliminate the water...but i only used a sprinkle...just to kinda wet the apples a tad...i cut the sugar and used granny smith apples...the crust was really hard to "crumble over the apples" I kinda had to smear it as it was really moist...idk if that was my fault or the recipe...LOL. but it was good. will make again

Substituted stevia for the white sugar and brown sugar with stevia blend for the brown sugar just because we are trying to cut down our refined sugar intake. Still came out perfect!

I liked the recipe but it was too sweet. I used the granny smiths green baking apples and it still was too sweet. Next time instead of using 1 cup of sugar I will try 1/2 cup of sugar. I used 1/2 cup of water as the directions specified and it was great...not too watery. This dessert was good with vanilla icecream which helped cut out some of the sweetness...I doubled the topping and it was delicious!

I made this tonight and it is fabulous! Only thing I changed was cutting the serving size by half and made it in a glass pie plate. I cut down cooking time by a few minutes (cause I forgot to set the timer so I had to wing it a bit). Nom Nom

Tried this last night in order to use up a bunch of eating apples of different varieties (gala, lady pink, etc).  This was fantastic!  It tasted super sweet, likely due to the type of apple we used, but it was great regardless.

We cut the water in half and doubled the topping, both excellent suggestions.  If using sweet apples, you may want to cut back the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2.

Thanks!

Be sure to add nutmeg!!  Also, I have someone that doesn't like rolled oats, so substituted for Rice Krispies (glutten free) and works VERY nicely.  Lightens up thetopping as well, not so heavy!  Had family matriarchs asking for the recipe!

Tried it last night - it was excellent. However I halved the amount of white and brown sugar - nobody needs 2 cups of sugar! :) I did not use water and I added 1/3 teaspoon dried cloves. Delicious.

Delicious! I made a few sight changes.  1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2. I tossed to the apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture first. I also added nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture as well as cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. also instead of melting the butter for the topping I cut the butter in, which made talking mmore crumbly.

This turned out great!  I used granny smith apples,  cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and water to 1/4 cup.  I followed someone's advise to toss the apple slices in cinnamon & sugar mixture. I doubled the topping so that I could have a double crust and it was fantastic!

I used 9 small granny smith apples. I followed most of the recipe directions, except: I coated the apples in the sugar mixture; and, since so many people recommended it and I had one less apple, I lowered the water amount to 1/4 cup. I was so excited to try this, but it ended up being overpowered with sugar. I felt like I was eating sugar with a side of apple. It may have been because I had one less apple, and they were small....but, IF I were to ever make this again, I would cut the sugar on the apples AND the topping down to 1/2 cup each...maybe add some more flour to the topping to replace the sugar. I don't understand why some people are recommending to double the topping...gag!

AMAZING!!! I made this a few hours before i baked it so i used 1/4cup lemon juice instead of water (cut back to 1/4 cup like other reviewers said) and added nutmeg, and used granny Smith Apples. It turned out great, and was a huge hit our our family get together. Next time I will cut back on the sugar, it was super sweet but still amazing! This is a keeper for sure!

Delicious! I made it as followed on the recipe except I lowered the water to 1/4 cup and it actually came out a tad dry, so next time I think I'm going to make sure I add the 1/2 cup as stated on the recipe. I used Granny Smith apples and I cut in cold butter for the topping because I like my topping kind of crunchy. Taste so yummy thanks Diane Kester for the recipe :)

I used and peeled about 10 cups of red delicious apples ( I think it was about 6 apples total?).  I did what some other people recommended and cut down the amount of sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and also added a pinch of nutmeg to the first mix.  I also only poured 1/4 cup of water over the apple mixture, and when I pulled it out, I still feel like it was slightly to watery for my taste, but the leftovers may "gunk up" and it tastes great either way!  I would have loved to try adding pecans or some other nut to the topping mixture but I didn't have any, but will try next time :)

I had some apples in the fridge that needed to be used and I had been looking for an apple crumble recipe forever. This was the one! I read through all the comments before making it. I make apple pies all the time so I also varied a little with that. I halved the water and added a little nutmeg and it was perfect. My 10 year old daughter who I thought may not like it said "It was to die for"

Excellent and easy! Be sure to add just a little water at the end, and slice up a pat of butter onto the top before putting into oven. The topping on the top and bottom is amazing!

This crisp was okay.  I don't understand why you are supposed to add water.  My crisp turned out soupy.  I also added more cinnamon on top of the apples and I also added cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture that went on top

Good recipe- love the topping, but overall it was too sweet for my taste. I would cut the white sugar at least by a 1/4 cup, if not half.

Delicious but a bit sweet for my taste. I may have not used enough apples. Either way I'll be making it again with less sugar! Also, eating the leftovers on top of oatmeal for breakfast = yummy!!

Excellent although I add 1 tsp on cinnamon to the topping and a 1/2 cup of water is way to much it makes it way to runny you need to cut it back to a 1/4 cup or less due to the apples cooking down.

This apple crisp was good, but i went in with the intention that it would taste similiar to apple pie. This is a much DRIER version, hence the word "Crisp". If you're looking for something more cruncy and chewy, than this recipe is fine. It's also much easier to make than apple pie. I actually used all the water advised, and almost wish I used more since I wanted more moisture. I'd rather stick to apple pie, but this wasn't bad.

Apple Crisps are a favorite in our home but it was almost unanimous that this particular recipe was entirely too sweet.  Even my 12 year old boy said he couldn't eat it because it was so sweet.  Reduce the sugars and I am sure it will be good.  This had a great flavor and that was our only qualm about it.

So yummy!  Had a lot of apples to use up, and this was delicious!  We used peeled Junami apples, and I just used the coring/slicing tool that I keep to cut apples for my toddler, so the slices were thick, but wonderful.  The only change that I'd make next time would be to either cut or eliminate the water.  The apples cook down on their own, so we had quite a lot of sauce at the bottom when baked.  If I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go ahead and add nutmeg like reviewers are talking about, but the recipe is really delicious on its own.

Scrumptious. I did double the topping and next time might add some chopped pecans to take it to a new level, but it is divine as stated.

I love the sweetness of this dish. Someone else said it was too sweet. Um, it's a dessert! Instead of the water someone said to cut, I added pink moscato wine and it was a lovely addition. I also thought that the crumble wasn't enough, so I added more to cover the dish towards the end and it added some crunch from the dry oats that was really good.

The flavor is fine.  I suggest you DO NOT ADD WATER. I only added 1/3 cup; it made this watery and the apples too soft.  

To make a flavorful mix, I always use Winesap or stayman and Granny Smiths in combination.  I also mix the cinn/sugar/flour with the apples, and add nutmeg.  Add cold butter, cubing it into small cube and cut it into the topping. 

If I didn't have to tailor this recipe so much, I would have rated it higher. It is a good start, but truly, fruit crisps are relatively hard to mess up.

Well, I altered it by leaving out the cup of sugar poured over the apples... and it was still amazing.  SO good!  Brought it camping and actually took home leftover because it was too good to just throw away with the other camping yuckies!  Cut the sugar, though!  Making it again for Thanksgiving... right now!

The best ever!! I use 11 Granny Smith's apples (no subs) without the water and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also mix the flour mixture in with the sliced apples prior to placing in the 9x13 pan. Then double the crust recipe. It is easier to dump the crust mixture onto the middle of the pan of apples and gently spread out to the edges and pat down. The pan will be heaping, but the apples will cook down so the finished product is level. I get begged to make this and everyone says it's the best they've ever had. For a special treat serve with Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel ice cream topping and vanilla ice cream. Thanks Diane!!!!

I followed the recipes exactly, including the water addition and it  turned out amazing! I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  It was coined the "winner".  The pan was clean in about 10 minutes setting on a table of about 7 other desserts. I brought salted caramel ice cream, whipped cream, and homemade toffee sauce to top it. Most people didn't fully indulge because it didn't need it. ...but I did:) So GOOD!

I've made this twice now, and it has been well received both times.  My brother in law is an avid apple crisp addict, so this was very popular with him.  I didn't change the recipe at all, though I think adding raisins would be an optional variety.

Overall really tasty, but don't trust any recipe that doesn't require you to grease the pan first! I assumed the butter and water would compensate, but I was wrong and the edges were really black after just 30 minutes in the oven.

I melted the 1/2 cup butter and added 3 heaping tablespoons of flour. I cooked the mixture for 5 or so minutes, stirring constantly (don't let it brown). I then added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar. Mixture will form a paste. I then added 2 tablespoons of water. I brought the mixture to a boil, lowered the heat and continued until the mixture became syrup/thick. I also added the apples and cooked until the mixture was thick again (5 or so minutes). I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 dashes of nutmeg. I baked the pie at 400 for 30-45 minutes. Allowed the crisp to cool for 15 minutes. Update 3:  Melt 7 tbs of butter.  Add 3 tbs. of flour to the melted butter.  Cook for about 5 minutes.  Do not allow the mixture to brown.  Add

What's not to love about this?? It was simply amazing. Not one bite leftover. I only used half the amount of water and it came out perfect, not too dry or too watery. Next time I will double the crust and add it to the top and bottom because the crust is my favorite part. Make sure to use crisp, sour apples. Otherwise it will be too sweet and mushy. We served it with vanilla ice cream and it was perfect.

Great recipe. I made a few modifications:
I cut all the sugars by half and used half whole wheat flour with half white flour. I also used half the amount of water as others have suggested. And for a 9x13" pan you want to one and a half or double the topping ingredients.  I definitely will make it again.

No wonder this has 3,500 reviews. Excellent. I made it as listed. My husband loved it (had 3 servings), the family loved it, the neighbors loved it. What a nice fall treat!. I baked it at 325 for an hour and then turned the oven off and left it in there. It was perfect. Served it with vanilla ice-cream. PERFECT!

It was a little too sweet with the full sugar. i might try to reduce that next time. 

only sprinkled water over apples. i think it would have been too soggy with a full cup.

i will make it again.

YUMMERS! I made this for my family (made the house smell AMAZING btw) and when they got home they gobbled half the pan for their afternoon snack and were begging for more after supper.  Needless to say, they polished the rest off!  Followed the recipe exactly as is and I have no adjustments to make to this one. I scribbled it onto an index and it has a permanant home in my recipe collection. I will definately be maaking this crisp over and over again!!

This was great! I wanted to make a smaller portion in an 8x8 pan, so I halved the first ingredients (apples/cinnamon/sugar/flour), but used the full quantities for the crumble ingredients. Baked for 40 minutes at 350. My little apple pie fan now says this is better than apple pie!

This recipe is not good I will not make this again.  It may be because I followed others advice to double the topping and lower the amount of water and mixed in the sugar cinnamon mix.  The topping was way too dry and loose, definetly not a 'crisp'

For those who find it too watery mix a little cornstarch with water and add the apples.  When baking it will be perfect as the cornstarch will thicken the liquid

I had to scale this down as I only had 3 apples.  Like others, I did not bake this with water in it. Instead I put the apples in water to avoid browning until I was done preparing them. I also doubled the topping (from the scaled version it ended up as the recipe states). I eyeballed the cinnamon, and I'm sure it was more, but not by much. I think I'd add a bit more next time and reduce the sugar,  otherwise this was very good.  The kids and the husband loved it.

This is by far one of the best recipes I have found on here-  and one of the only ones I have not had to "tweak".  I used assorted types of apples that we had from apple picking, and used the recommended amount of water as well.  I did not double the topping ingredients as many people have recommended, and am glad I did not because it would have been too much for our taste.  I would recommend a more tart apple, or to decrease the white sugar if you are using a sweeter apple.  Serve with some real vanilla ice cream and enjoy!

This is an absolutely delicious recipe! I've made it in a 9X9 and a casserole dish, and it was great either way. It could be renamed, "Vanishing Apple Crisp," because that is EXACTLY what it does here. THIS is now my apple crisp recipe!

This recipe is perfect as written, but after reading other reviews, I decided I should double the crumble and add a layer to the bottom.  Definitely don't regret it, but it came out really sweet!  So to remedy this, I'm putting a dollop of vanilla yogourt when serving it because it adds a tangy creaminess that balances the sugar very, very well.

This crisp was, at first bite, pretty good. My apples remained firm and the crisp was initially tasty. But after a couple of bites, my company and I all thought that it lacked flavor. The dish was overwhelmingly sweet and didn't seem to have a lot of spice. If I were to make this again, I'd add more cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe a hint of clove and allspice. I'd also use light or dark brown sugar in place of the white sugar called for tossing the apples. I did double the crisp as most reviewers suggested, and I definitely would not do that again. We all felt that it turned into a crisp with apples, rather than the other way around. The proportions as written would have been good for us. It otherwise felt like we were eating butter and sugar and flour and butter. This wasn't terrible; my guests ate it and were pleased to have a dessert made with freshly picked apples. But I'd have to make a lot of adjustments if I were to make it again.

Really good.   I used granny smith apples like I usually do for pie but I think I would prefer a sweeter baking apple such as a Mcintosh but our grocery store didn't have any.  Almost too much tart vs sweet.    I did double the topping just because it's so good.  My daughter thought 1 1/2 times the topping would have been suffiicient.

Very good. I baked mine for over an hour & it still wasn't quite done in the center so next time I may saute the apple mixture for 5 minutes or so. Also it's very sweet, so I'll reduce both sugars by at least 25%. But it's still delicious this time, thanks to Ms. Kester for posting.

This was gobbled up in minutes! Excellent dessert! I reduced the recipe from 12 to 6 servings using a 9x9 glass dish. Mainly because my 9x13 was in the dishwasher :). I had to substitute the flour with almond flour and left out the baking powder because I had neither on hand for the topping, which I also doubled and added to the bottom of the dish. I also used coconut flour mixed with the sugar and cinnamon to coat the apples. Absolutely delicious!!

Yum yum! This is so good straight out of the oven with caramel ice cream! I swapped out the water for apple cider and did cut the liquid down a bit as others suggested. Did not melt the butter but just cut it in to the dry topping ingredients. I used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon and also added a pinch of sea salt. Definitely a keeper!
Update 9/28/16 -- still fantastic!!! Another option I like is to serve warm with vanilla ice cream and drizzle caramel syrup on the whole mess!

This was simply delicious. I made this apple crisp for thanksgiving as a surprise dessert, and everyone loved it! I did, too. I have noticed a lot of people saying that you should not put as much water in as the recipe says, but I did, and i thought it was still super good. I really recommend this as a seasonal celebration dessert, but it would taste just as well at a casual dinner party! Really great recipe!

I gave it 3 stars because good apples should not be peeled because that is important to eat the skin for good fiber and health; also, way, way too much sugar. If you use a good mix of sweet and sour baking apples very little sugar is needed especially if it is topped with ice cream. Taste test the apple mixture before adding any sugar and lemon juice and cut the sugar in half for the crust. Top with toasted nuts and vanilla ice cream.

I thought this was a great recipe, but I give it a 4 because I adjusted it according to other review comments.  I omitted the water and made 1 1/2 times the topping.  It's not soupy, but not dry at all, and the tart firm apples come through perfectly.

Tried this recipe on Friday. Used Granny Smith, turbinado sugar, added nutmeg and cardomon. Fabulous and easy. I also cooked it longer so it was really bubbly and had a crispy top.

I left out the water, mixed the sugar and cinnamon with the apples and cooked it an extra 5 minutes. It was crispy and good but I probably will cut the sugar by half the next time I make this.

I just made this. The texture of the topping was perfect. Plus using melted butter made it very simple. Next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar though. It's way too sweet for me, even with the Granny Smith apples.

Takes time to cut those apples up! I used only 6, not 10 apples (would have been way too much for me). But it turns out great and had it with vanilla ice cream even better

as it did taste delish, i halved the sugar content and it was still too syrupy...  I would recommend pressing the cinnamon and flour into the butter, brown sugar and oats, but add some more flour or mill some oats to flour to help it all stick together better and come to a crisp, crusty texture.

While the recipe was delicious, it is a bit sweet. I guess it depends on the type of apples you use, but I would definitely cut the sugar in the apples back by half. I also like my apples a little more cooked than this so I would add another 5 minutes. And the key to thicker consistency is letting it sit for 10 minutes after removing from the oven. I know, CRAZY! Who can watch a hot apple crisp for 10 minutes without eating it. Trust me, it's worth the wait.

Delicious! I maybe shouldn't rate this five stars b/c I did alter it ever so slightly. I almost halved the white sugar and gently packed the brown sugar. It was plenty since I used Fuji apples. Also, I added much less water, merely a heavy sprinkling and it was quite watery. I would skip the water next time. So easy and delicious. *must be eaten warm out of the oven served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. yum!

Having never made apple crisp before, I thought this was pretty good. I think I could have left the water out, as apples are naturally full of water. The topping was a bit bland, and its' texture was too chewy. Next time I would season the crumble part with additional cinnamon, and a dash of salt. I might even leave out the oats in favor of walnuts.

This was great.  I skipped the water and the apples were still juicy...I think it would have been too soupy with the water.  Crumb topping is really good on this and everyone loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this dish every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, it almost never makes it to the next day. It's one of those dishes you want to make the day before you serve it so its nice and thick and wonderful, then heat it up 20 minutes before you serve it. I do go a little above what the recipe calls for with the cinnamon though, you can never over do cinnamon.

A very easy recipe with very good results, but it's a bit sweeter than I would like.  The apples and sugar caramelized beautifully, the topping is crumbly and nice... but yeah, this makes a really, really sweet dessert. I might try tweaking it with less sugar, or by tossing the apples in some lemon juice.

Made this recipe tonight.  After reading some reviews, I also altered the ingredients.  I used 13 fugi apples.  I changed 1 cup of white sugar to 3/4 cup, and changed 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to one tablespoon.    I followed and used the rest of the ingredients as noted.  Before I placed the cut up apples in the 9 by 13 inch pan; I put the apples in a zip lock bag.  I mixed the white sugar, cinnamon, and flour together and added 3/4 of the mixture to the ziplock bag.  I closed the bag and shook it to make sure the apples were coated with the mixture.  I then put the apples in the baking pan and sprinkled the rest of the mixture over the apples.  I then made the crumb topping as directed and baked it.  ( I was a little concerned with the amount of water, but stuck to the original ingredients).  Yes, it was watery.....but, we are a small family and do have left overs.  The water will keep this apple crisp moist when re-heating it another day.  This is a magnificent tasting apple crisp!  I will definitely make this again!

This is the perfect apple crisp recipe, I won't use anything else now. The only thing that needs changing is the topping. Once doubled it is the perfect amount. I also added some allspice to the apples as a personal preference. My family loves this apple crisp, never any leftover.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and I got amazing reviews! My husband says it is the best apple crisp I have ever made. I love how easy it was to make. I followed all of the instructions except that my oven had it ready in only 30 minutes. I also added sliced almonds to the topping and maybe sometime I will try walnuts. This will now be my go-to apple crisp recipe.

The easiest recipe I've ever tried! I agree with not putting much water in, but I believe that's the best way to cook the apples...that was a lot of Apple's to peel but well worth it! Save the crumb recipe for all your future crumb desserts! It's a time and mess saver. Trust me! No more cutting butter in with knives or squishing it through your fingers, etc.
Add dried fruit & nuts of your choice and let the
 kids help. You can't mess this up!

I got rave reviews when I made this apple crisp today.  I followed other reviewers advice and omitted the water.  I used honeycrisp apples and had to cut down the sugar and brown sugar both.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was very good.  I made it for an adult pot-luck and had not much left for my own kids to try. When it came out of the oven, it seemed soupy to me and I was very concerned.  However, upon it setting up a bit, it was not too runny - just in a couple of corners and the texture was great.

Be careful with the amount of sugar to apple ratio. I didn't have quite 10 cups of apples so it was too sweet but still very good apple crisp

This was one of my top five apple crisp recipe. The kids loved it. I would cut down on the sugar as suggested by others. Half the amount on the apples but keep for the topping. Will sure be making this again in the near future.

This was very easy to make and delicious!  I didn't find it too sweet.  Maybe it is the apples that are used that make the difference.  When I was cutting the apples, I was tossing them in fresh lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.  I added some fresh grated nutmeg and vanilla.  I tossed the apples, sugar (3/4 c), flour, and spices in a bowl and let it sit while I made the topping.  I did not use any water.  I added 1/3 c of sliced almonds to the topping.  I greased the pan with the butter wrapper and added 1/2 the topping to the bottom. Some of the crumble on top was dry when I took it out of the oven.  But it moistened during cooling and when I covered the pan with foil.

Delicious! After reading through some of the reviews, I made the following adjustments: Omitted the water, doubled the topping, doubled the cinnamon and mixed the flour/sugar/cinnamon with the apples instead of sprinkling over the apples. I used Macoun apples and it came out just right...not too sweet and the apples were soft...just the way we like them! Also, in my oven it took roughly 55 min at 350.

This is a fantastic recipe! The best one I've come across with very minimal changes. I added a dash nutmeg to the apples and halved the water to 1/4 cup. Absolutely the best apple crisp. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty...  I make this in a slow cooker which makes the house smell great while it cooks.  Instead of melting the butter, I cut slices placing them in top.  Cook for a few hourss on high.  Yumm!

I found this recipe good, but too sweet. I doubled the crumb topping as per reviews in order to cover a 9 x 13 pan. I don't know if that's what made it too sweet or whether there is just too much sugar in the topping recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of water, but next time, I'd use 1/8 or none at all.
This does make a great oatmeal topping. I made regular oatmeal, spooned some of this apple crisp on top, microwaved it, and de-lish. Better than store bought apple cinnamon oatmel.

WAY too sweet. Even with using predominantly tangy Granny Smith apples, it was still overbearingly sweet. Add ice cream and you've got a sugar coma. I didn't add water based on other reviews and was glad I didn't. The apple juices were sufficient. Topping was great, just the right amount for the 9 x 13 pan. I like the generous size of this recipe and I will probably make it again but I'll reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup.

DELISH! decided to make my 1st ever apple crisp and chose this recipe. I used 8 granny smith apples(wasnt too sure on how many cups), next time will use 10. I read all the reviews, but still decided on using the water as the recipe states. To the water i added a big splash of vanilla. also added a pinch of nutmeg with the cinnamon. Finished product was amazing!

I like this recipe, but my wife and I think it's too sweet. There's no need to put as much sugar on top of the apples as the recipe call for. I'm guessing the sugar would offset VERY tart apples, but this recipe's sweetness took away from the apple-y-ness of the apples.

I prepared this desert for my in laws... They licked the plate clean!
I did not add the water, instead I used the juice of one lime (I didn't have lemons on hand so that's what I used) and used Stark apples because thats all I could find...
I did the refrigerating thing for the crust and used half white sugar and half brown sugar for the apples.
An absolute keeper!
Served warm with fior di latte icecream... DE-LI-CI-OUS!!!

I get stellar reviews every time I bake this!  Love to bring to potlucks because it can be eaten hot or cold. Follow the recipe and the results will be delicious. I use Gala or Fuji apples and they are just right. The topping is delicious and can be doubled, but I think it's a perfect balance as is.  Definitely a keeper!!!

I made this with loads of apples, no water, 2/3rds the sugar and 1 1/2 times the topping. I'll make it like that a couple times more this fall I believe!

Very easy recipe once you get past peeling the apples. As others stated, I did NOT add the water. No need. It bakes up with a sweet, cinnamony syrup from the baked apples. 
And the topping is phenomenal! I have for years always had recipes that tell you to mix in softened butter and use a fork to mix until crumbling. What a PIA. This recipes states to melt the butter. So much easier to mix and the crisp topping was perfect. This is a keeper!

The topping doesn't have that golden top with the 1/2 - 3/4 inch gooey awesomeness that it should. Ends up with too much juice on bottom of pan. Maybe a 'lil more sugar mixed in with apples and no water. Overall very mediocre. Would not make again but can still enjoy the apples I picked with my children. Not a total loss.

I like the two different kinds of sugar in the filling and the topping. I put the cinnamon (just a 1/2 tsp) in the topping rather than the apple mixture for a fresher apple taste. I also ALWAYS use CORTLAND apples. These are especially good if you like to eat the crisp once it has cooled. I think the flavor is far better than granny smith for crisps. Next time I might add another two TBSP of melted butter, I think it will make the crisp crispier and less dry.

Fantastic!  2nd time made.
1/2 sugar (maybe 3/4 brown sugar), added a few pecans I had around, 1/2 of the water & left the skins on the apples (random apples I had around).  Served with greek yogurt.  GREAT for a brunch w friends.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

Made this with the suggestions from ALLY99 and doubled the crumble recipe to have a bottom & top crumble, used solid butter instead of melted and used a pastry tool to combine.  Also tossed the apples with cinnamon / flour mixture, added the nutmeg and reduced the water to 1/4 as suggested.  I also added more cinnamon & flour to coat the apples than the recipe called for (kind of just winged it with amounts until I felt it had the aromatics I liked).  I also cooked it for an extra 10 min. but that could vary by oven.  It all turned out great but I'd say it came out more like a crumble pie because it all held together like a pie.  It makes quite a bit and is very sweet and rich so small servings seem to do the trick (but still delicious especially with  vanilla ice cream!)

As per suggestions I doubled the crust recipe, but cut sugar significantly as ever time I made it it was still too sweet. So even with the doubled crust I cut white sugar to 1/2 cup and kept brown sugar at 2/3 of a cup. Plenty sweet still!

Flavour wise this recipe was delicious but like other reviews--too much water came out of the apples.  I'm going to do a trick from America's Test Recipes and cook off the apples first--then bake it with the topping.  I'm sure this will do the trick.  I used honey crisp and Granny Smith apples.

If you like sweet things,go for it, but it was WAY too sweet for us. Cut sugar greatly in half and omitted the BR. Sugar entirely!, then is was great. We like tasting the apples and not all sugar.

This recipe is delicious.  I won't be needing to search for another one.  I agree with previous reviews that the water isn't needed.  You can also add nuts and cranberries if you prefer.  Enjoy!

-added nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon mixture
-used 3/4 cup of pure cane sugar instead of 1 cup of white

Perfect! I used Granny Smith apples and after reading the reviews I was skeptical of the water but decided to still use the 1/2 c. and it worked great and tasted wonderful! Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe this past weekend for my husband, and he LOVED IT!  I followed the recipe almost exactly! I cut the cinnamon in half and added a dash of nutmeg.  Other than that, I followed the recipe (water and all) using Granny Smith apples and it came out wonderful!  **We topped it with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream and it was heavenly!

OH MY GOODNESS! This was so freaking delicious! I kept pretty true to the original recipe except cutting the water down to 1/4 cup and added a little nutmeg. I used tart granny smith which gave it a nice balance. What a fantastic fall recipe to get you in the mood!!!! Thank you so much for a stellar dessert :) Will be making MANY more times

Absolutely amazing. A little decadent on the sweet side, so if you're the type that can be overwhelmed by sweet, maybe cut down on the sugar. Might be I used apples that were too sweet to begin with though.

I love this recipe. *This is so delicious as written* I wouldn't change a thing. Just a helpful tip - put the topping in the fridge for a couple hours & let the butter harden, that way the topping crumbles. I had issues with the topping not crumbling first time I made this, either way whether you let the butter harden or spoon bits on - its still soo good. I used Golden Delicious apples both times for this & it's wonderful. I like eating this for breakfast with a tall glass of Silk soy milk :-) yum, this is my second time making it & I will be making this over & over again forever. It is Fantastic!!

Great recipe. We used fresh gala apples we had picked today and it is fabulous. I did add a little extra butter in the oat mixture. I also sprinkled some extra dry oats over the top before baking. Sooo good.

Double the topping.  Omit water.  Use baking apples only.  50% brown sugar.  Raisins.  Coat apples with cinnamon and flour.  Nutmeg.

Followed the recipe exactly using a combo of granny smith and baking apples and it turned out perfect!  Water mixed with the sugars into a delicious caramel-like sauce.  Love the oat topping too! A+ recipe...now only if I can stop tasting so there is some left for the family!  (Warning: it is irresistible!)

Was looking for a good way to use up a mixed batch of apples picked from a local farm and this was a simple delicious dish! The changes i made were ; Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and allspice, cut the white sugar to about 1/4 cup and skipped adding any water. The dish came out delicious and still plenty sweet without taking away from the flavor of the apples, thank you

There's a reason this recipe has over 3,000 reviews! It's 5 STAR Delicious. I did use granny smith apples and followed the recipe to a "T"
Served up and topped off with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream!

Why deviate when it's perfect as written.
USE APPLES..NOT PEACHES, PLUMS OR SOME OTHER FRUIT YOU MIGHT HAVE LAYING AROUND! IT'S APPLE crisp!

I loved this Apple Crisp recipe!  So did my hubby!  He ended up eating it all so I'm making it again (just went out and picked some apples) and now I can try it!  I just had 1 taste!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really loved this recipe, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my apples got mushy. Maybe will cut down the baking time next time. Otherwise this was very delicious!!

I'm not a fan of apples as they are from off the tree, but do like to make things out of them. This apple crisp recipe is sooo good and really easy to make. I do suggest that you prepare the dry ingrediences first before peeling and slicing the apples. It's best when served warm.

It was absolutely wonderful!!! I used a fruit that is common where I live in Brazil, but I'm sure that it would taste great with apples too!!! I cut down about half on the sugar and water (like other members recommended). The whole family loved it, and I was asked for the recipe by several people. It is worth trying.

The best! Followed the advice of others and omitted the water. Made in an 8x8 pan and the single recipe for topping was perfect-came out nice and crunchy! For those who use Epicure products the Poudre Douce spice blend was delicious in this.

LOL..... I accidentally missed the one cup of white sugar and when my family and I had some we all loved it, saying that it was great. We all loved the fact that it wasn't too sweat, then my daughter and I looked at the ingredients and I noticed that I totally missed the 1 cup of white sugar.  For our family it was still the best apple crisp ever, and I will  just leave out the white sugar as the brown sugar is sweat enough for us.  Thanks

DO NOT ADD THE WATER!!! I wish I would have read the other reviews and omitted the water. I lost my apple crisp recipe and although I thought it was a little strange adding water, I did it anyways. The flavor is good, but the topping was overcome with the liquid of the dessert and turned soggy.

This was super good, but a bit on the sweet side.  I actually didn't have enough brown sugar and that worked out fine because I'm afraid if I added the full cup of brown sugar it would have been way to sweet.  I'll make it again but I will cut back on the sugar.  I served it with slow churn caramel ice cream and it was yummy.

This is one of my favorite recipes for apple dessert.  I think it would go very well with some vanilla ice cream.  I never have oats in my house, so I use Honey Bunch of Oats cereal instead.  It tastes really great.

This was a hit at my house. I used Granny Smith apples and left the slices  a little thick.  I  halved the recipe for the apples but left the recipe for the topping the same and baked in an 8x8 dish.  I also had to substitute some steel cut oats for the quick oats because of what I had on hand.  Didn't cause a noticeable difference.  I will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again.  Loved it!

This was very "soupy", even after cutting the water in half like other reviews suggested. The topping was very rich. This recipe made a lot and you could not eat much at one sitting. I will not make again.

Though I like to follow all the directions to a high accuracy this time I made some slight alternations.  I added only 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water, it was more than enough and a dash of nutmeg (mmm...). This recipe calls for 1 cup of brown sugar. As long as I have only dark brown muscovado, I used 1/2 a cup of it and didn't add any white sugar in the crisp. It came out sweet enough for me, because the filling is very sweet.

Just made this for the first time. After reading the other comments, I used granny smith's, did  half white, half brown sugar and mixed the dry mix with the apples before putting them in the baking dish. I used 1/4c water with the juice of half a lemon and a tsp vanilla and doubled the topping. It got great reviews!

I have never made anything like this before and I was happily surprised with how easy it was! I made it with 10 red apples and doubled the topping, my husband and I loved it! I will certainly be making this again! I did follow other reviewers instructions and added nutmeg.

Great recipe.  I cut it in half since its just for me and my husband and I also added nutmeg and cut the water amount in half.  My husband prefers the apples to be a bit "saucy" and this recipe does that.  Can't give it five stars since I altered it a bit but otherwise a great base recipe.  Thanks.

I used 6 granny smith apples and a fuji apple.  I added a dash of nutmeg.  It was very good.  I give it a 4, but my husband gave it a 5.  He loved it.  My young kids did not care for it. **note: I've made this many times and it's turned out perfect, but tonight it was way too watery.  Perhaps next time I will cut the water in half.

This is my go to apple crisp receipe come fall. It is quick, easy and tastes home made. I make a little bit more topping than the receipe calls for and also add a few more apples. Other than that it is a simple, delicious, uncomplicated apple crisp .

Made this for Father's Day and had it a la mode with vanilla ice cream. So awesome, and not too sweet. I didn't add the water since I had my apples previously frozen with all the filling ingredients, so when it thawed, there was plenty of liquid.

I doubled the crust recipie which was a good choice! I also used Granny Smith apples as some of the other reviews said. Turned out great! Took this to a BBQ and it disappeared in minutes! People were asking me for the recipe. Suuuuper easy to make as well.

Made this today and it was sooo good. I made half the recipe because I only had 6 apples (wished I had more). Did everything else like the recipe stated except I diced my apples and it came out perfect. Thanks pattycakes for a lovely recipe

This was very good.  I took suggestions of some of the other reviewers.  I reduced the water to 1/4 cup, and I also doubled the topping.  My kids loved it!

This turned out amazing!  It was so easy that I was able to impress my in-laws and Im not a very good cook.  I would leave out the water like other reviews said, but overall it's easy and quick.  I was even surprised how delicious this came out.  I will definitely be making this again!

Followed other suggestions and doubled the topping.  Also used less sugar and 1/2 the water (I used Braeburn apples).  Was great warm with Vanilla ice cream after Easter Dinner.  Next time, I'll use slightly less water and a little less sugar.

I guess I'm more of a cobbler fan than a crisp fan and I'm really just rating the topping here. This tastes really good and is easy enough that a monkey could make it. When first out of the oven, it was crumbly and loose -- almost like granola -- which I didn't like and I gave it a three star rating at first. Then I came back 20 minutes later and it had all combined nicely and set up and I was pretty impressed with myself. :) LOL! I used an 8x8 pan and had two small clamshells of blueberries which I used in place of apples. I sprinkled about 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar, some cinnamon and about three tablespoons of OJ over the blueberries. I used the exact topping measurements for a 9x13 pan because nearly every reviewer said to double the topping recipe for a 9x13 so I assumed the regular recipe would work fine for an 8x8 pan. Yum.

OMG OMG OMG! Made this (topped with vanilla glaze once it cooler for about 10-15 minutes) and my family gobbled it up and the 9 x 13 pan was practically licked clean! This was fantastic and will definitely be making this one again and again. (I also did NOT add the water and the apples produced plenty of liquid to not make it too soupy - was perfect!! (I used 7 apples - combination of Gala and Granny Smith apples)

Super yummy. I omit the water, and only use half the regular sugar... It's still plenty sweet. The batch in the oven right now has sweet cherries at one end (no cinnamon on them) I'm hoping that part is delish too.

Really good! I reduced the sugar and water in the apples by half and it turned out great, but I would probably add more spices to the crumbly top next time.

This recipe is amazing! We had apples in the fridge, and my mom told me to make an apple crisp with them. I found this recipe made it, and it was delicious! Easy for a 13 year old to make!

Changes I made:

~Didn't use a full cup of water
~Didn't do 10 cups of apples

I halved the whole recipe because I was just using up Granny Smith apples I've had for far too long.  It was really good, although I had it with yogurt and cool whip since I was out of ice cream, lol.  I'm sure it would have been much butter with ice cream, but until I run to the store!  Also, I think next time I will follow another person's suggestion to halve the water proportion, so there isn't so much of the thick sauce.  It was good, and would be great if you like quite a bit of drizzle!  Also, I cut the apples kind of thin so I will try and see how they turn out next time when I leave them thicker!

Very good and very easy to make! As per other reviewers, I did not add the water and cut the butter in rather than melting it.  Also, as other reviewers mentioned, don't mix in the crumble with the apples...it will become soggy.

Hmm, I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Too liquidy and too sugary, and I even reduced the amounts the recipe called for.. the "crumb" topping baked more in to a cake-like topping, but it was still pretty tasty overall, just not the apple crisp I was hoping for :( 3 stars for it being an nice basic and easy recipe.. with some variations I'm sure it could be really delicious :) I noticed a lot of other reviews said that skipped the water completely so I'll probably do that next time too and reduce the sugar more as well. Not sure what happened to the "crumb" topping though.

Yummy recipe.  I used the amounts suggested (the full 10 cups of Granny Smith apples - 3 lbs.) and it was delicious.  Instead of 1/2 cup water I used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice.  I might try 1/4 cup less sugar in the topping next time.
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Slightly changed the recipe a little. Eased up on the flour and sugar it wanted. Only used 1/3 cup white, 3/4 cup brown, and 3/4 cup flour. Added a little extra quick oats. Same amount of butter. I used mostly Empire and threw in 3 Macintosh Apples. Wow. Became like an oatmeal cookie on top! Yummy and a smidgen less calories than original recipe. Apples are so sweet on their own don't be afraid to cut back on the sugar! Still comes out great. Everyone in my house loved it.

WOW!  This recipe is terrific!  I made it with fuji apples (that was all I had on hand) and I ought to have cut back on the sugar.  Mine was a tad too sweet.  Next I will make it with granny smiths.  Thanks allrecipes and whoever created this recipe

Great recipe! I used the water & followed the recipe exactly. I would not use water again. I would also cut back the sugar. I'd use 1/4 white sugar next time. Nice flavour, everyone loved it.

I loved this recipe but made some changes to clean it up.  I used sucanat (evaporated cane juice) instead of brown sugar and used 1/2 of what it calls for.  I also reduced the white sugar by about half. It was plenty sweet.  I used organic apples and butter and added some walnuts and shredded coconut to the topping mixture.  Fantastic!

I give it 6 stars!! We followed most of the reviews and did 1/2 water, doubled the toppings and added nutmeg. It was delicious. Not sure what type of apples we used but they were very soft when we used them and they were still good and not too mushy. DELICIOUS!!!

I was not impressed with this recipe. Made it for our supper club and was apologizing for how it turned out. Like other reviews, it was way too juicy. I even cut back on the water. A little too sweet also. Will never make again. Lady Di

I love this recipe.  I had gotten a fruit basket when I started a new job and had pears and apples that I didn't know what to do with and I didn't want them to go bad.  I used both fruits with this recipe along with a few granny smith apples.  It came out perfect!  I didn't use quite as much water, just a sprinkle or so.  I paired it with some Hagen-daaz vanilla bean ice cream and mmmmmmm yummy!

So good!!! I followed this recipe and my boyfriend and I devoured it. I'm still learning how to cook/bake, and this was easy to follow. Even *I* didn't screw it up and it came out great!

I've made this recipe twice - once as written, and once with modifications. I think the original recipe is 4 stars because it's good, but lacking in flavor complexity. It's sweet; maybe too sweet. The second time around, I used lemon juice in place of water over the apples, and added some nutmeg, and thought it was amazing. The lemon juice really does something wonderful.

Made this the other day and we loved it.  I've never put water in apple crisp, so I left it out.  I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream.  My teenaged grandson asked for seconds.  I didn't measure the apples....I just used 5 large Granny Smiths, and that was plenty for a 9X13 pan.  Thanks for an easy recipe that tastes yummy!

I omitted the water as others suggested. I did add a little bit of fresh grated orange and about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of juice from the orange to the apples.

This is by far the worst apple anything I have ever made. Under the 'OKAY' tasting topper, the apples were just sitting there with no flavor, plainly and oh so boring. Made it for guests and I was so embarrassed once I cut it open to serve. Terrible.

About twice as much sugar as I would like making it too sweet but otherwise really nice. Wonderful flavor, made even better by adding some chopped pecans to the topping.

Easy to make and tasty.  I only added the oatmeal mix to the top the second time as the first time it was mushy on the bottom.  You can add this to just about any fruit for a delicious Crisp dessert.

Delicious. Since I used cortland apples, I cut the white sugar in half and added the juice of one lemon to the apples. Also added nutmeg - just a little. Topping actually had a little crunch, which was very nice.

Loved it. Doubled the topping to make a crust and topping. Added a dash of some extra spices (allspice, nutmeg, and cloves), tapioca beads instead of flour, and baked at 365. This temperature increase gave the crust a crunchy texture and allowed my apples to get slightly softer. I've made this recipe multiple times and my husband describes it as "the best apple crisp ever."

Delicious and super easy to make. I used cortland apples which were perfect and still firm after cooking. 6-7 apples sliced up to > 10 cups.

I loved this recipe.  
My changes were: 
coconut oil instead of butter.  Due to dietary restrictions.  
Pineapple juice instead of water.  I made it up ahead of time and did not want the apple to go brown.
DELICIOUS.  A big hit.  Had it straight out of the oven and served with vanilla ice cream.  YUMMY

This is EXCELLENT!! I have made it now for the last couple of dinner invites we have gone to and it gets RAVE reviews each time. Some reviews commented about skipping the 1/2 cup of water because it makes it too watery. I did add the water, but added 2 Tbsp of 'minute tapioca' to the sugar mixture that you pour over the apples. This is what I add to fruit pies to give it some thickness, and works well with this recipe too. I serve it hot with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream and it is divine!

this was a simple recipe that has great results. I used granny smith apples from a local orchard and loved it! I didn't use ten apples and added 1 1/2 cups more of oats since I like a lot of oats on mine. Great recipe.

DELICIOUS!!! If you double the crisp topping you definitely only need a 1/2 cup white sugar (if that) with the apples. Double the topping and use half pressed into the bottom of the pan and the rest crumbled over the apples. I used granny smith apples and only 1/4 cup water. It turned out wonderfully! I will definitely be making this many  more times!

This apple crisp was DELICIOUS! I had so many apples, I made four recipes of apple stuff. This was the best out of all of them! Best apple crisp I've ever tasted. It looked pretty weird since I've never actually made apple crisp. I made it with my friends and ate some at parties. They all tasted way too sweet. I used Granny Smith Apples and didn't use as much sugar. Next time, I'm just going to skip the water part, because the bottom of the pan was too moist. I only used 1/4 of a cup of water, but it was still too watery. It still tasted good though!

This was absolutely delicious, paired with some Haagen Daz French Vanilla was an absolute hit and now family favorite request. (I may add a pinch of salt to the crisp but that's my personal pallet.. either way it's great!)

This apple crisp is absolutely DELICIOUS!! I knew that I didn't have the full amount of apples that the recipe called for so I only used 1/4 cup of water, but made the full amount of topping. OH. MY. GOODNESS. I ate so much Im going to be sick. This is SO good.

Best ever!! I took this to a get together and got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe! The entire pan was gone when I left. I did omit the water in the recipe like others suggested and doubled the crust. I also baked it for a little longer than suggested. I used granny smith apples sliced very thin. I served it with vanilla ice cream.

This was fantastic - especially straight out of the oven, with ice cream. Yum!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the crumble part of the recipe. It's a good move, because you wind up with just a *bit* too much crumble, and get to munch on the extra stuff while everything's baking.

Yum!  I didn't have any baking apples on hand so I used the red delicious (4) and cut down on the sugar.  I also made this in an 8x8 pan without the water and it came out perfectly.  Next time i will add more cinnamon and more ice cream....Thanks for sharing.  This will be my go to recipe for Apple Crisp.

This is my new go to recipe for apple crisp.  We all LOVED it.  I used whatever apples I happened to have around my house. Because it was not granny smith, I cut down on the white sugar.  I followed reviewer advice and tossed the apples with the spice-sugar mixture.  Also reduced water to 1/4 cup.  Personally, I love oats, so I reduced the flour and added extra oats to the crumble.  I can see why this recipe is so well loved.  Best apple crisp to ever come out of my kitchen!

Tastes Ike an oatmeal cookie on top!  I added nutmeg, ginger, and ground cloves with the cinnamon.  No water!  The apples give off enough.  I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  For topping, I over measured all of the dry ingredients to make up for the egg I added with the butter.  Amazing!  I can't help but tweak recipes, but this would be great without modification!  Wonderful, yummy, fast, easy, and convenient!

Phenomenal!  Absolutely terrific. This is the best crisp I've ever made. The kids and husband loved it.  I used the recipe exactly as written and it worked well. I used equal parts of granny smith and red apples (picked them myself from an apple farm nearby) and it was a delectable blend of sour and sweet.  I forgot to add the half cup of water and ended up adding it almost near the end of the bake cycle. But no harm done. It still came out awesome.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was DELICIOUS! I did take the advice and cut the water down to 1/4 c and I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp cloves becuase I think these all go with each other and make it extra special! Have made several times and loved by all who try it!

Definitely double the crumb topping and I did add a dash of nutmeg to the apple coating.  I halved the water suggested and it came out too watery for my liking.  I think next time I may leave out the extra water completely.  All in all a GREAT recipe!!  This is going to be one I make over and over again!!

This is the best recipe as is, but can be modified with anyone's creativity.  I have made this so many times this fall, and never have leftovers!!!  Make sure to have vanilla ice cream on hand for an extra "umph!"

I made this for the first time today and I thought it was great. I will make it again. I reduced the recipe down to serve four, used granny smith apples, and doubled the topping as many reviewers suggested. I do not like things that are very sweet and I think the granny smith tart apples counter balanced the sweetness of the sugar. This would probably be a good dish to take to a party. The topping is staying crisp so it would not be mushy if served hours later. Next time I will add walnuts to the topping. I would imagine that this is a good basic recipe to use with different kinds of fruit or ingredients - nuts, raisins, coconut, etc.

Great recipe. The only thing I did that differed from the recipe was to dice the apples then put the apples in the sugar, flour and ground cinnamon mix. Then spoon the mix into individual oven safe ramikens.I baked 6 of them @ 350 degress for 35 minutes. This is one of my favorites!!

So, easy! Prepped it and had it ready to go in the oven when dinner came out. By the time the kitchen was cleaned, we were ready for dessert. LOVE the oats added as well. The brown sugar carmelized around the edges which made for yummy "pickings" during clean up time. Will definitely make again. I'm gonna have to try some other fruits...cherries, peaches, pears, a mixture of fruits! Might even add some cranberries to this for a Thanksgiving dessert.

This is really good! The prep time took longer than stated (mostly for the apples), but it was worth it. I halved the recipe and used Smart Balance instead of butter; I also used Granny Smith apples- the best for baking! My only complaint is that there is too much sugar in the topping- it's still grainy on the final product. I'd either cut back on the sugar a little or add more oats or something to balance out the topping. Otherwise this is delicious! I think I'll add raisins next time for a little extra something.

This recipe was amazing!!! Only 2 suggestions, melt an extra portion of butter and drizzle on top before putting the crisp in the oven, that way it comes out crunchier and holds together better with big chunks of brown sugar and oatmeal. Also, when making half a batch, do not use the 9 x 13 pan- the crust will be too thin even if you double the crust. Use at least an 8x8 pan. I made this recipe at about 2pm and by 6pm my 6 roommates had pretty much licked the pan clean. Oh and it would taste even better with some vanilla bean ice cream.

By far the best apple crisp recipe I've used.  This topping was nice and had a bit of a crunch to it, whereas others I've tried in the past just sort of sat there on the top, did not brown or crisp up.  I really think the secret here is how the entire recipe is put together.  Here the apples go in, then water then sprinkle with the topping..  This recipe is far superior and tasted like the crisps I always remembered my Nana making and I could never replicate until now.  Thank you, Diane for a great recipe!

The house smelled amazing while this was baking! This recipe is great and everyone seemed to enjoy it. For me, it was a little too sweet, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. The crisp was delicious though, and was perfect with some vanilla ice cream.

This Apple Crisp was very good! I forgot to add the water to mine and it still tasted very delicious. I made this for the company we had over, and they liked it a lot, too! :)  Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great apple crisp recipe.

Loved it. I split it into 2 smaller pans, It turned out wonderful. I used apples from my tree, not sure what kind they are. I think I could have cut the water in half but it's nice and juicy. Very good flavor. Printed it out on one of my pretty cards for my recipe box. I definitely will make this again. Thanks for sharing it.

This was one of the best apple crisps I've ever made/had!  I didn't change a thing, and it was perfect.  I used Mcintosh apples.  I will make this again and again!

I have used this recipe for 2 years now and it is fabulous.  Whenever I have a bag of apples my family won't eat, I use this recipe.  The only thing I have ever changed is I have doubled the topping since my family loves this part.  I have made this recipe as it is written also and it is wonderful. This is one recipe I know I will hand down to my daughters.  Thanks for posting.

Left out the water and doubled the butter, which I cut into small pieces and mixed with my hands rather than melting. Also halved the apple part and and put the crust in the freezer while I prepared the apples.  Substituted old fashioned oats. Very good!

OK, so I will preface my rating with some history:  My brother-in-law is the considered the apple crisp critic of the family and my mother bakes prize-winning apple pie.  I have experimented over the years with apple crisp and decided to give this one a try this weekend.  It was hands down, the best apple crisp we (he) has ever had.  My mother always told me to mix your apples when baking pie/crisp, so I used Northern Spy and Macintosh mixture and cut the water in half as some recommended.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and doubled the topping amount.  I baked it in a deep dish square pan and had a little left over for a smaller single portion (for the neighbours).  The mixture game some apples a mushier texture (Macs) and a few firmer pieces that melted in your mouth with the vanilla ice cream.  It was served warm, but I am looking forward to some cold left-overs to see if the reviews hold out.  In my opinion, this recipe kicked apple pie butt! :)

This was delicious, but I felt like it had just a tad too much sugar even though I used Granny Smiths. Next time, I think I will cut the sugar on the apples back to 1/2c and will add nutmeg like others suggested.

I'll use this as a base for apple crisp in the future but it was WAY TOO SWEET!!!! I always make recipes exactly as described the first time because, although I am experienced at baking, you never know when you are going to be surprised. Well, as I made this recipe I kept thinking to myself "wow, that's a LOT of sugar" and it turns out I was right. WAY too sweet. I would cut the sugar in half next time and save myself the toothache. The only thing I changed was that I used apple cider instead of water in the recipe.

I followed some of the other reviewers advice and doubled the oats (to make a bottom) and halved the water. Divine. Raves from everyone myself included, because tooting your own horn is fun. Thank you for the recipe!

This is the best apple crisp I have made. I did leave out the water though. I can't imagine putting water in it. I think it would turn to apple sauce which is not how I want my apple crisp to be. Without the water, the topping came out nice and crispy.

Delicious! Made just a few minor tweaks.
1 - Cut apples into bite size (cubed) pieces for more efficient cooking all the way thru and for ease of eating smaller pieces.  
2 - Substitued the cinnamon that is called for in the apple filling mixture for APPLE PIE SPICE (much tastier). 
3- Added ground cinnamon in the crumble topping mixture for flavor.

This is an easy desert to make that tastes wonderful!  I read that others doubled the topping, but I didn't to save on fat content and it turned out perfect!  However, I didn't add the water and it still was moist and delicious!  I will make this again!

This apple crisp is delicious and so easy! Thank you for this great recipe! I used 4 Golden Delicious apples which is probably half of what the recipe called for. Therefore I had a lot more of the crumble part, but it came out great anyway, as that's the part I like most! Some reviews say to double the crust/crumble, and I would agree. The crust came out a bit crispy and chewy, and perfectly sweet! The only thing I added, was 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon/flour mix. I also used Maple and Brown Sugar instant oatmeal instead of quick oats as that's all I had, but the flavor matched very well with the apples. Next time, I will add more apples to this and add more crumble/crust accordingly. It will be interesting also to try other types of apples, like Honeycrisp. We served it with ice cream and it was BOMBDILICIOUS!!!

Super! Had old apples and didnt want to throw. I never follow exact measurements for any recipe; use as per my taste and intiution. Didnt use water at all. Didnt peel apples. Didnt use baking powder and soda. Didnt use melted butter - used semi-frozen butter pieces.
Chop apples (cubes), spread them in the tray. poured dry mix of flour+cinnamon powder+sugar+flour. Topped with butter bits. 
Next time, will make a layer of the dry ingredients at the bottom (below the apples) as well, to make it even crispier. Like a sandwich. Overall, extremely easy, no fuss, and super quick. Served with Vanilla ice-cream...Tops!!!

I halved the recipe to make 6 servings, it really is still a lot! I also used half pears/half apples. bartlett were not baked to softness but it added a nice crunch. i also served it with 1/4 cup of frozen yogurt. it's perfect for a rainy night

Great recipe!  I substituted coconut oil for the butter, and added 1/2 cup more oats & 1/4 cup molasses to the mix.  I also left the apple peels on the fruit.  Yummy!

Fantastic Simple Recipe!  So, I switched it up entirely!  Sorry, could not resist the temptation to try a variation - I had some frozen fruit puree that I thawed and mixed in with the apples (used 1/2 fruit puree consisting of: 2 ripe plums, peeled and cored; 3 ripe pears, peeled and cored; 3 granny smith apples, peeled and cored).  Because of the sweet fruit puree, I halved the white sugar.  Naturally, I was out of butter, so I used extra virgin olive oil - albeit a bit fearful of this, and took the advice of using less water.  No problems!  In fact, all changes turned this desert into a gourmet crumble.  Yum - thanks for the inspiration!

Only changes I madewere to add 1 Tb of lemon juice...brighter flavor and keeps the apples from Browning while peeling and slicing. I used 6 instead of 8 Tb of butter. The first time I made it I used 8 Tb and it was a little too wet.

the BEST APPLE Crisp EVER!! This apple crisp is wonderfully sweet, and is especially fantastic when contrasted with sour Granny Smith apples. Try it, save it in your recipe box, and use whenever possible!

I doubled the crisp part as many other reviews did. I thought it was way too much and way too sweet. I used red delicious as that's the apple I like and halved the sugar and that part was delicious. Next time I'll stick to one batch of th crisp and reduce the brown sugar. Overall still good, but I would modify next time.

AMAZING!!!!! I have a large family so I made a very large batch of this.  I overlooked adding the cinnamon to the sugar/flour mix that you place on the apples, so I just sprinkled very little on it and mixed the remaining cinnamon in the crumb mixture - YUMMY. I have teenage kids who tweeted how good this was. thank you for sharing this recipes, I will use it for years to come.

I tried a suggestion on here to half the water and double the topping. Seemed like too much topping, kind of seemed dry. Wouldn't double again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used 3/4 cup of white sugar with the apples and I did not add the water with the apples and it was just fine.  It is wonderful served warm with ice cream or whipping cream and a big glass of milk!

Amazing! (with a few changes) I used twice the amount of the topping like a lot of others. I put juice of half a lemon over the apples, then mixed the cinnamon mixture over the apples before putting them in the pan. I also put 1/4 tsp salt into the crumb mixture. Didn't melt the butter either like the others- just softened so it was crummy. Oh yeah-I cut the water in half- might even cut in half again (1/4 cup) AMAZING!!!!

Overall easy and good flavor.  A little sweet for my liking. I did use Macintosh which are not the best for baking; which may have contributed to sweetness. Will try Granny Smith next time and maybe cut back a bit on sugar.  Also omitted the water as the apples were already soft.

Crispy, tasty, will make again, I used wholewheat flour and baked in 2 8" round foil pies dishes so I could freeze one pie, slight overfill problem but made for very deep juicy pies. I forgot to add the water so probably depends how juicy your apples are to start with.

I made this for my reading group and they loved it! I thought the sweetness was a bit over the top, though. I left off the icing and served it with a dollop of whipped cream. The cinnamon chips were difficult to find, so next time I'll go with white chips and add cinnamon to the apples.

This was EXCELLENT and amazingly easy to prepare. LOVED the taste and texture. To make it simpler I cut the recipes in 1/2, chopped up the celery, SHREADED the carrots and 1 large onion, added 4 cloves of garlic. Boil for 10 min, than simmer on low heat for 10min. This made the soup thick and hearty in taste (without the need to puree or strain). We added chicken and fresh parsley to the leftovers ....result...SUPER YUMMY...not a drop left!!!!

I thought this was very good, but I modified it a bit. I don't like my apple crisp too sweet, so instead of mixing the apples with 1 cup of sugar, I used 2T of sugar and 3/4 t of cinnamon. I also left out the liquid, and thus the flour. I made the topping as written, and threw in a handful of chopped pecans. I will make it again, as I modified it, because it turned out just the way I like it!

Amazing! Used 5-6 granny smith apples, left out the water, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars and used a 8x11" pan. 
**Have also used 10 Granny Smith apples and divided them into two 8x8“ pans

Will definitely make it again. Made it a little healthier by using Splenda. Next time will try applesauce instead of the butter. Wonderful flavor.

I signed up for the site in order to leave a review!

We'd eaten dinner last night and wanted something sweet. Usually I'll whip up a quick batch of cookies, but had no softened butter.

I made this so fast and it was SOOOOOO delicious! Even with the nondescript apples we had on hand. I can only imagine how good it'll be when I purposefully choose good apples to bake it with. Great recipe!

delish!  Read some of the reviews so added a cup of chopped pecans to the topping which gave it an extra crunch.  I also used 1/4 cup apple juice instead of 1/2 cup water and the sauce was very flavorful and not runny at all.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious! I tried this recipe using apples from our garden (no idea what type) and followed the recipe as written except cut it in half as there is just the two of us. Wonderful recipe. Tried it on its own last night but tonight will have it with ice cream. Thanks for the recipe Diane K.

My family and I loved this recipe! Granted, we did tweak it, but it was one of the best Apple Crisps I have ever made. I used home-grown apples, used 3/4 cups of sugar instead and it was still too sweet. Next I plan to cut the water in half, cut the brown sugar in half, and cut the white sugar in half. I will definitely make this again!

Generally not a fan of cooked apples, but this was delicious. The only thing I did differently was add half the amount of water and white sugar called for.

It was pretty tasty with some vanilla ice cream.  It does have a lot of butter and sugar so you might want to cut back a little on that.  I had about 6 kids fighting over who got to have seconds though!

I made this exactly like the recipe states.  I used three granny smith apples and three braeburn apples.  I cut them into bite size chunks instead of slices.  It turned out perfectly!!!  I wouldn't change a thing.

I asked my hubby to grab me some apples from the store for our son's lunch box.  Not knowing one apple from another he bought the granny smith apples because "they looked good."  I decided to make this recipe with them and I was surprised at how easy and quick it was.  Both of my boys are happy now enjoying this awesome dessert.

When I made this several years ago, I gave this recipe 4 stars. I just made it again today, and have to take back some of those stars. This is just too sweet!  I even cut way back on the sugar and used tart apples per other reviews. Still too sweet. Have our tastes changed with our recent healthier eating ways?  That's good news, but now I need to find another apple crisp recipe. :(

Double the topping, reduce the white sugar by 1/2 on the apples, and either reduce water or add more flour.

I tried this last night. I love that there is so much more oatmeal crisp than most recipes. Love that it is both under and on top of the apples. The only critique I have is that it is quite heavy on the cinnamon. I will cut it back at least half next, if I use it at all. Also, be sure to grease pan really well. I just rubbed the stick of butter over the pan before I started and it stuck pretty bad. But this is by far my new favorite crisp recipe. Cant wait to try it with peaches or berries!

Thank you for this recipe, it was wonderful! It was my daughter's 18th birthday yesterday and she wanted apple crisp for desert instead of cake. I made this for our family dinner and it smelled wonderful as it cooked and was delicious - rave reviews by all. I used Granny Smith apples, added a bit of nutmeg to the topping, doubled the topping as suggested by others since we all really like that part of the dish too, and used cold butter to cut into the topping. Excellent taste and consistency. I prepared it the night before, refridgerated it overnight, and popped it in the oven for about an hour before we started our main course - perfect!

This will be my "go-to" apple crisp recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe, and my go-to for apple crisp.  My husband absolutely adores apple crisp, and this got a huge double-thumbs-up from him the first time I made it!

Following advice from previous reviewers, I halved the water to 1/4 cup and doubled the topping.  I also substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for half of the white sugar called for in the recipe.  Use granny smiths or another tart apple variety or it will be too sweet.

I'm making this again tonight as a special treat for my husband - he's very excited!  :)

I double the topping.  This is so good, that I am now responsible for bringing it every Thanksgiving.  Don't forget the French vanilla ice cream!

Excellent taste.  However, there is standing water in the pan so add a bit more flour to the apples.

Super easy and includes ingredients that I always have in the house.  To it to a family dinner and didn't have to worry about carting home leftovers.

Wonderful!! I used some extra Braeburns we had on hand. They were sweet enough that I cut the sugar called for in half, but made the mistake of using the full amount of water which ended up making a sloshy cinnamon soup at the bottom of the pan. The apples released enough moisture during baking that I don't think the extra water was needed. Great recipe though, thank you!

Did 1 1/2 times the topping, added nutmeg to sugar/cinnamon mixture and tossed apples in the mixture before putting in the dish. Delicious!

Oh my gosh, this was awesome. I made a couple  changes from reading the review, I only added 1/4 cup of apple, added nutmeg and as for the plain rolled oats I didn't have any so I used Quaker flavored instant oatmeal, the flavors I used were maple and brown sugar and apples and cinnamon....It was delicious then topped off with some chocolate icecream....This was a hit and will make it again...Thank you

I made this per the recipe and do not change a thing.  It was wonderful and very easy.  I used Granny Smith apples.  A three pound bag of apples is perfect for this recipe.

decreasing water is not a good idea, tasted good but not very juicy, very sticky without the extra water. we did double the topping and used on bottom and on top that was a tasty bonus

This is the all-time best apple crisp recipe!  I made one change, omitting the sugar.  If you use a sweet variety opp the white sugar, added at the beginning, isn't necessary!

Easy and great tasting!!  The hardest part was cleaning the peeler/slicer/corer.  It made the house smell WONDERFUL while baking, too.  I made two of these - one for a family gathering and the other for the girls at work.  Both loved them.  I took the advice of others and tossed the apple slices with the sugar mixture and did not add the water, perfect!!  Will be in my favorites!!

Red Delicious work ok too!  With the most common tweaks this gets kudos from me, I had a bunch of Red and Golden off my trees to use, I did NOT peel the apples (saves time) cut the sugars in half , no extra liquid, Zested a lemon, then juiced it and poured it over apples to keep them from browning while mixing the rest,  I did the Crisp part at 1.5 times more, just doubled the baking power and soda to 1/2 tsp, was plenty sweet with half brown sugar and mostly Red apples! The lemon juice and zest add nice touch, along with Vanilla Ice cream. 50 min cook time or could go with 375 at 45 min im guessing.

So simple, and SO yummy! Best apple crisp recipe I've had and the only complaint I received was that there wasn't more. A friend of mine told me it was way better than her recipe because it was nice and crunchy and not soggy.

this was the best apple crisp that I've ever had. Two things I will change next time i make it-
Cut the white sugar all together. This time I used 1/4 c. It was very sweet. I tripled the topping to make it really thick. Instead of adding 1/2 c. of water I used 1/4 c. of apple cider. Also, I will cut the amount of butter in half. This is a great recipe for a holiday or family party.

This is the best apple crisp I've ever made!  I used six large Granny Smith apples and that seemed to be just the right amount.  After reading some other reviews, I doubled the amount of topping  Next time I will just do 1 1/2 times the amount.  Keep an eye on the apples while baking.  If you like them to retain some of their firmness, 45 minutes is way too long.  Next time, I'll starting checking mine after 35 minutes.  This has definitely become my go-to recipe for apple crisp.  What a great fall treat!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made a few changes based on the suggestions of others.  I used no water, and I used softened butter instead of melted, so I could have a crunchy topping.  I cut the butter right into the oat mixture.  I also used McIntosh apples, and it was very tasty!

This recipe would have been a bit better with way less sugar. I used granny smith apples and they are already so sweet that the 2 cups of sugar was overkill. That's my only complaint, because it still came out fantastic.

This recipe is superb!  I have found my apple crisp keeper.  Followed the recipe exactly as written except right before I placed the crisp in the oven, I sprinkled it with cinnamon and nutmeg.  It turned out beautifully and tasted amazing!  I used a local seasonal apple- Limbertwig.  I was told that this apple was great for baking, the flavor is tart and juicy.  Thanks to Gopher Glenn for their flavorful, yummy apples and thanks to Diane for this wonderful recipe.

Super easy recipe and so good! My husband asks to make this all the time. It is especially good when topped with Hudsonville's apple pie ice cream (when it is in season). Vanilla is good too, but we liked the apple pie ice cream best with it.

Made this a few weeks ago and Wow, this was so good!  I mean GOOOOOD!!!  We like more of the crumb topping so I used a little less apple and then just used an extra 1/2 of the crumb topping ingredients.  Was perfect for us! 
Followed everything else as written except I did NOT use the water, glad that I didn't because it came out perfect!  
Wish I had found this sooner in the apple season, can't wait to make again!!

I have never made apple crisp before, but was in the mood for something warm and yummy, so I tried this one.  It was wonderful!!!  Even my husband loved it and he is not a big sweets fan.  I followed the recipe exactly and used jonathan apples.

Incredible! Made this for a dinner party...served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...my friend said she didn't really care for apple dishes but she gobbled this one up...and another friend had thirds:) A true crowd pleaser! Sure to become a regular at our dinner table:)
I made this recipe almost exactly...didn't really measure the apples in "cups" but simply used a 3 lb bag of granny smiths. I may have also cooked it for a few extra minutes because the top didn't seem crisp...which I think helped create the amazing caramel-like filling! I also added a pinch of nutmeg as another reviewer suggested. But overall it is spot on and truly amazing! Oh and did I mention incredibly easy!

This was a great crisp!  I wasn't sure if it would turn out while I was baking it, because there was so much juice.  When I took it out the juice soaked into the crisp and it had great flavor.  My mother'n'law loved it and hubby isn't a crisp lover and he had two helpings.  I used 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup and I used granny smith apples.  Thanks for the recipe!!

We made this recipe and we absolutely LOVED IT!!!!! We took the advice of other reviews and only used 1/4 cup water and we also tossed the apples with cinnamon sugar mixture. It came out FANTASTIC!!!!! Next time we are going to put the crumb mixture on the bottom too like other people have! This really is the best apple crisp recipe we have ever had!!

I think this recipes is almost foolproof.  It's very good and very easy.  I made it just as written although I think I might have had less than 10 cups of apples, so I thought I had plenty of topping as I see some reviewers have doubled the topping.  Excellent!

I have made this twice in the past week!!  I followed some of the other reviews, I made a smaller batch in an 8X8 pan, used about 6 apples.  After I cut the apples I put them in a long container and mixed the sugar and the cinnamon along with it.  I also only used about a tablespoon of water.  I also doubled the topping.  The first time I used contry crock and the topping was like an oatmeal cookie, the second time I used real butter and it wasn't the same, so my advice is to use country crock!

The crusty was not crispy and light for a high rating.  Also the recipe should call for more water( I ADDED apple-cherry juice as a substitute and raisons to compliment the apples.

No changes made and it tastes great. Easy to make. Used honeycrisp apples and turns out great. Have used red delicious in the past and it came out more mushy and less sweet.

This is a great recipe!  Some friends gave us a huge bag of apples from their tree and here was the solution for using them up.  Very tasty and very simple.  Will try this topping with cherry pie filling sometime. I'm sure that would be wonderful too!

This is wonderful, the kids went over the moon for this served with some vanilla ice cream.  The only thing I would change is reduce the water to 1/4 cup. It was a little watery.

Really good! I made it just as the recipe states, except I halved the water, although it would probably have been fine with the entire 1/2 cup, just more saucy. Everyone in my family loved it. I liked it a lot too, just felt it was a bit too sweet. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar, for my personal taste. And it was so easy; definitely deserves the 5 star rating. Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT recipe!  I was going to rate it 4 stars out of 5, but then I realized that it was because I followed the advice of others by halving the water and doubling the crust.  I found it came out dry and WAY too much crust to apple ratio.  Next time I would add the whole 1/2 cup of water and keep the original crust, as I found it was more than enough for a 9x13 dish.  Also, I might not put as many oats in.  I did add 1 tsp of nutmeg and tossed the apples in the mixture before putting them in the dish.  Also, I didn't cover with aluminum foil while baking, which I might do next time.  I'll be making this one again soon!! Thanks!

We have searched and searched for an apple crisp recipe that tastes like my grandmother's.  Totally nailed it.  My only change is substituting brown sugar for part of the sugar. Thank you - I've had tons of compliments on this recipe.  It's divine.

Fabulous Recipe!  So much so, that I had to share it on FaceBook.  I suppose you could dress it up a bit, maybe add a bit of nutmeg.  But really, you don't need to!

I just made this recipe and it was delicious.  I used some suggestions from other posters and increased the flour 1T, decreased the white sugar to 1/2, tossed the apples with the dry mix before putting in pan, cut down the water to 1/4, used 4 varieties of apples as well as increased the apples to about 11 cups, and, finally, added 1/4t of nutmeg.  What a disappearing act, gone quickly!  This turned about better than our old family recipe!  Yum

Very Yummy! Instead of sprinkling sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture over the apples, I coated the apples. I also left out the water. Turned out perfect!!!! My family loved it!

WOW...WOW....WOW!!! The words exclaimed by my husband between mouthfuls. He then requested it for Thankgiving and Christmas desert! Lol, it's only October.  I couldn't agree more. By far the best desert I have ever tasted! I substituted 1/4 cup of apple cider and doubled the crumb topping.

Awesome recipe!  Super easy and the topping has the perfect amount of crunch to it.  Not too sweet and the topping even stayed a little crunchy the next day.  Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

Awesome flavor! This recipe is perfect when you omit the water. I made this twice now and ommited the water the second time and it was perfect. I also added 5 cups more of the apples since I love mostly apples and the topping couldn't be more perfect .. Thanks for sharing.

This is an excellent Apple Crisp. I tried it for my family and they loved it. Then I made it for dessert for a lunch for 20 people and got great reviews. This is great using Granny Smith apples.

Perfect.  I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the white sugar down to 3/4 cup. It was exactly as I hoped it would be, crumbly but not dry.
It is what I remember my Mom making.

A definite keeper.

This recipe has the best consistence, it really ends up being crispy but also juicy. Do what others suggest: add 1/4 tbspn nutmeg, half water, toss the apples in the dry mix instead of just sprinkling it, double the crust recipe. 3 cups of sugar in the whole recipe is too much though, so next time I'll double the crust recipe but keep only 1 cup of sugar on it. I used 7 granny smith apples, next time I'll go for 10, because they come out just perfect.

just finished having this after dinner. only change I made was in the sugar /cinnamon mix. I changed the 1 cup sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I did add the 1/2 cup of water which made for a nice thick sauce.
This was very yummy and definitely making it again.  As for the apples used:  gala,honeycrisp,macintosh and cortland.

Oh sweet heavens this is SOO good!!!! It took a while to make because I'm uber slow at pealing apples -_- but it was worth it! Ate an entire 9"x11" pan by myself in about 3days. Only thing I added was a tiny bit of all spice over the top of the apples in the pan and a little bit of caramel syrup over the apples prior to covering them with the crumb topping

I've never made anything like this before, and it was delicious! I followed the recipe, except to cut the water in half, use all brown sugar, and to mix up the first bit of flour & sugar with the apples. I also cut the butter into the crumble, and it came up nice an crisp on top!

it's very good! just the right amount of sweet. but if you are only feeding like 4 people, you might might cut the recipe in half. the original makes a whole lot... the real problem is it's sooo good...

Absolutely delicious apple crsip!  I used mostly Spy apples and a few Cortland.  I also cut the brown sugar in the topping ingredients by half.  Was perfect!  Looked watery as it baked, but once it cooled it was a perfect consistency.  A family favourite for sure!

This was the yummiest apple crisp ever!! I didn't melt the butter , just used room temp and incorporated it in the flour/ oatmeal mixture. It made a ton and my family gladly ate it for days! Good hot or cold. I plan on making it again tonight :)

Make this-you won't regret it!! I made it for a group of friends coming over, and one commented that this was better than apple crisp at one very famous southern/country cooking restaurant chain. I did add some allspice and cloves (I didn't have nutmeg on hand, or else I would have added that), doubled the topping (so glad I did!), and reduced the water to 1/4 cup. It was perfection! I used Gala apples, but will use Granny Smith next time. Add a scoop of ice cream on top and you have the perfect desert! It was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's delicious.

Is there a six star option? YUMMY and fantastic.. make sure you can share with others otherwise it will be gone in a flash! Made it the 2nd time for my sister and her family and they were all "ooo's" and "yumms" about it. The butter is a bit heavy in my opinion, but that's probably what makes it taste so good to. It has a great texture and is really just perfect. Eat with vanilla ice cream and wow, one of the best deserts on the planet.

Simply the best apple crisp recipe I have ever made!!! I used McIntosh apples, omitted the water, doubled the crust, and added nutmeg to the apple mixture. I did not place the apples in the pan first. I mixed it all together and then spread it evenly in the pan. Like I said this is the best ever!!!!

Super easy and delicious. I was doubtful about the melted butter (vs chilled pats of butter) making a nice crumbly crust but it came out great. I added a handful of chopped walnuts to the top and like many of the other reviewers here, I left out the water and it was perfect. I used slightly less apples, since my husband and I prefer a lot of crumbly crispy crust. I also used a variety of apples. This is a definite keeper in my book.

This was good! As I like to follow directions exactly I was hesitant about not adding water like many of the reviewers suggested. I did stir my sugar mix and apples in bowl firt then added to baking dish. I added 1/2 of water that was called for on recipe and wished I didn't add any. The reason I gave 4 out of 5 is because the topping didn't come out as crumbly as I had hoped. Still taste delicious though.

So far, this is the best apple crisp I have eaten! I only added a 1/4 cup of water since many reviews suggested it, and it came out just fine. I made the crumb topping ahead of time, so it would hold its shape, but it still turned into syrup. Next time, I'll freeze it. Anyway, thank you for this recipe! I will be making this again!

Was a big hit.  Used Granny Smiths and Gala apples.  Added some dried cranraisins and instead of the water I used about 1/4 c orange juice and a couple of heavy squirts of lemon juice.  In the apple mixture, I used only half of the sugar.  As far as the topping - I would increase by 1/4 recipe - half was a bit much. Top with a glob of vanilla ice cream!

Waaaaay too much sugar. I followed the recipe and found that it was just ok. The topping was too sweet though. Husband and daughter thought it was just ok too. I will try again with 3/4 cup of brown and white sugar.

Wonderful!!! Will def. make again! You don't need to double the topping part, I did and it was way to much. Just following the recipe as written. The only thing I changed was used softened butter instead of melted. Very flavorful!

Amazing! However, I can't give it a full 5 stars becuase I altered it, however the recipe as is was a great base! I am not much of a baker and this was my first real attempt at anything like this and it turned out amazing.

I used Cortland apples (a bag) and 2 Granny Smiths. I didn't add any water as I didn't need it. I used brown sugar instead of white and only used 1/2 cup in the filling (and it was still a bit too sweet for me). I doubled the crust recipe (except the sugar) and put half on the bottom of the pan and half on top. I also doubled the cinnamon and added 2 teaspoons to the crust! I baked in a glass dish for an hour, but next time I will cut the apples into thicker wedges or reduce cooking time. Overall, everybody loved this and I was impressed!

Excellent and simple apple crisp! It was a hit with my whole family. I'll definitely make it again. I followed other reviewers by not adding water and used less apples so that there was more crumble topping.

This apple crisp was SO effing good! I made it last night with the recommendation to double the crust, and I am so glad I did! I also softened the butter rather than melting it to make the crust more crumbly. I did not add nutmeg like many people suggested because I don't care for it. It turned out so delicious, and I'm SO excited to be eating this decadent treat all weekend!!

So this was the first time I've tried any kind of cooked apple recipe and this one was AMAZING! I had no idea how many apples to use so ended up getting 10 pretty decent sized Granny Smiths, used all but maybe half of one, and they were pretty piled up in the 9x13 dish lol. I actually did not use the baking soda, found out too late I didn't have it, so winged it and left it out. I did use the half cup of water, I know some people were kind of 50/50 on that part of it, but it worked well for me. As far as the oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon etc...goes, I went by the measurements for the most part but fudged it a little since their were so many apples, and cooked it for about an hour. It turned out great though, will def be making it again.

My mom is allergic to gluten, so we used this as a starting recipe, and simply switched out the regular flour for gluten free and we all loved it!  Even my picky father who normally refuses to eat anything that  has been adapted for my mom's diet couldn't find anything to complain about.

This recipe was easy and delicious, plus it was a huge hit at the party I brought it to.
I used about 10 small granny smiths and altered the recipe a tiny bit. I doubled the "crisp" part and added a layer to the bottom underneath the fruit, then one on top. I also cubed the butter rather than melting it.
Perfect for fall!

I made this tonight and followed the suggestions of others to cut the water in half and add nutmeg.  I'm giving the recipe 4 starsbecause with the full 1/2 cup of water, it would have been too runny.  Also, it wouldn't have been as good without adding the extra nutmeg (and cardamom).  The surprising thing is that I did double the crumb topping, and it was WAY too much.  And I used a ton of Honeycrisp apples.  Fewer apples, and I would have had to trash it.  I cut the sugar in the apple mixture in half, which was perfect.  I will make this again, but will go with either the original amount of topping, or 1 and 1/2 times at the most.  Very good, but think twice about that topping.  Doubling it almost completely overtakes the apples.  Oh, and Honeycrisps are perfect for this!  :)

Best apple crisp I have ever made! With a few changes to make it my own (and following other reviews suggestions), definitely a hit! I used a bit less white sugar and a touch of nutmeg, tossed the apples in the sugar mix and only used 1/4 cup water. I did a recipe and half of the crumble, and sprinkled more cinnamon on top. Perfect!

I read all the current reviews and decided to try this recipe.   It is excellent.  I made the "crisp" by half again.  Used 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal, flour and b sugar,  increased the soda and b powder,  added another 1/2 stick of butter.    I also used Penzey's baking spice, as I do for all of my baking.   Instead of water I used orange juice to keep the apples lighter in color -not that it matters.   Very good crisp.   Thanks for sumitting this recipe for our use.

I baked this today for the first time. I used apples from my apple tree in the backyard. I didn't change one thing in the recipe & it turned out great! With a family of 5, I bet this will be gone in no time flat! Thanks allrecipes for such a great, easy & tasty recipe!

Not sure if I'm just not an apple crisp kind of person but I wasn't a fan. It was way too sweet. The crust was pretty good though.

Oh my goodness, this was so good!  I used half the amount of apples (that was the amount I had) but made the full amount of the topping.  My husband chopped the apples so they were more chunks than slices, but turned out excellent.  I followed the other reviews and put half the topping on the bottom, and used only half the water.  AMAZING.  I'll definitely make it again, and I'll try it with berries, too!

This is so good. I tried and I don't think nothing has to be different about it. I was going to take it to work and share with my co-workers but I think I'm just taking a couple pieces for family. My son loved it a lot.

This recipe is excellent.  Part of what makes it so good is you can make adjustments to it to suit your own tastes.  I did make it nearly as written, I just used a little less water and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples.  The crumble was much simpler when using the melted butter instead of cutting it in as done in some recipes.  Don't be afraid to use your hands with the topping.  Everyone at work was very pleased with the results.

This recipe is wonderful! I tool suggestions of other users and doubled the crust and used 1/2 cup water. Everyone in the family loved it and it is a very easy recipe. This will be my apple crisp recipe from now on!

Great. I did make some minor changes. The only one I would say was a must is to decrease water by half. Other changes were to my taste: add nutmeg to apples, add cinnamon to topping, decrease white sugar by half (i used granny smiths and it was too sweet for my taste)

Wonderful recipe!! Awesome taste! After reading reviews, I added a little less than half the water. I also added sweetened granola instead of oats (made the crust a little sweeter), substituted Crisco instead of butter, and added only about 3/4 cup sugar whenever it called for full cup. Turned out perfectly--not too sweet, but sweet eneough; just the right consistency, not to watery; and the apples were divine!

Holy Moley this is AMAZING! So so incredibly easy! THe only change  I made was cutting the water in half. I've made this twice, and one time I didn't have brown sugar so I used a cup of white sugar and added about three tablespoons of molasses. Still tasted yum, so that's a good substitute. Absolutely fabulous.

Loved this recipe.. I doubled the crust like I read others suggest, the only thing that I would change is to add a little less sugar as it was very sweet... but that probably was a good thing so I didn't overeat :)

WOW! Definitely THE best apple crisp ever!! I made it by going with what other people said by doubling the topping and cutting the water in half. Even though I decreased the water, I still had a puddle in the bottom of the pan. Next time I will just skip the water all together. Still tasted amazing though! Crowd pleaser for sure!

Everyone LOVES this recipe.. It's highly recommended when I go places! :) I like to mix the apples I use...Granny smith, cortland, golden delicious, and a few other great baking apples...It really gives it a distinct flavor AND texture...not all the apples cook the same!

Made this to use up some apples this fall, and everyone loved it. Hands down the best apple crisp I have made! The hubby and kids liked it with some vanilla ice cream, but I prefer mine with a bit of Carnation canned milk..:) May sound strange to some, but gotta try it....even if you put a little spoonful of warm crisp in a bowl and add a tiny amount of canned milk. Let it sit for a minute, then try it.....gets so creamy and yummy.....mmmm....hehehehe. Def recommend this recipe to everyone. Only thing that I "changed" was to double the topping, as I love the crisp..:)  Thanks!

signed up just to review 5 stars. Believe these reviews, it's just great! I halved the recipe and left out the water. Used regular red apples. It came out perfect! Also, I didn't have brown sugar so I made a light brown sugar from white sugar and a little bit of molassses. So simple and delicious~~

I have made this twice now. And gotten rave reviews every time. It gets eatten up so quickly I wondered where it went.  I just mention making it and my friend perks up and asks if I really am going to make it. I'm so going to make it again and again.

Wonderful crispy and easy to make!...It replaced the other recipe I used to make from this site. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and did not add any water. However I added a splash of orange juice. I also doubled the quantity for the crumble mixture and added a handful of crushed pecans because my family likes it that way. I also used 2 tbsp of cold butter that I crumbled and put on top of the mix before baking. We loved the result and I am sure to make this easy recipe more often....Thank you for sharing it!

Very very good.  Very sweet. I read the reviews  and only used half of the water and doubled the topping.  My husband even ate it and he normally doesn't like apple crisp. Also, stirred  the apples together with cinnamon mixture to coat apples. That's it!!!

Halved the recipe (for the 2 of us) and followed it  exactly except for using 4 large apples--instead of measuring.  Topping was nice and crunchy; filling wasn't too syrupy but nice and moist.  It was perfect-best crisp I've ever tasted!  It was gone within 24 hours.

This is an excellent recipe as is. I sometimes add some nuts, if I have them lying around, pecans and walnuts are both great mixed into the topping. This is a sure to please recipe that I go back to over and over again!

Very simple and tasty when you want something sweet.  I used apples that were soft; not too fresh.  Whipped cream or ice cream on top is a great addition.

This is so simple to make, but it was a bit watery at the bottom. I will definitely make this again, using less water, then I'm sure it will be a 5-star recipe!

This was my first attempt at baking ANYTHING from scratch and it truly turned out wonderful! I couldn't wait, as soon as it came out of the oven I had to "test" this masterpiece...I could not put my fork down! I also halved the recipe, using 4 granny smith apples in a 8"x8" pan. However, to make it a little healthier and perhaps easier on my hypoglycemia, I substituted organic palm sugar for the white sugar on top of the apples (lower on the GI and is similar to brown sugar in taste/texture) but used brown sugar for the topping and used white whole wheat flour. I also did not add water, sprinkled a little nutmeg on top of the apples and a little cinnamon on top of the crumb crust. Tester for Thanksgiving which I plan on actually contributing to this year! A true winner!

This apple crisp was amazing!! I used Granny Smith apples and omitted the water...plus, I added some nutmeg as suggested. I halved the apples as I only had 5 on hand but left the topping amount the same. It came out PERFECT!

I made about 1 1/2 times the crust, not quite double, and I did reduce the water to 1/4cup. I also added 1/8 tsp of ground cloves, and 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg. It was perfect!

Well, I guess I'm in the minority here since so many people love this recipe.  I have to say I prefer my original apple crisp recipe which doesn't use Quaker oats, although I know this recipe is healthier because of it.  I followed the suggestion of making twice the amount of crumble, putting it on both the top and bottom, and decreasing the amount of water.  It turned out dry and there was too much crumble which hid the flavour of the apples.  I'll try this again, but without twice the crumble.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a couple very minor changes.  I cut the butter in using a pastry blender.  After putting the topping on, I drizzled about 1 Tbsp butter.  Also to the crumb mixture I added a couple "shakes" of each of the following: cloves, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was just delicious!!!

To quote my fiance,"Wow, I think that's the best apple crisp I've ever had!" I also cooked these in small individual ramekins, came out great without changing the recipe one bit.

Excellent recipe!! I made mine with the water and wished that I would have left it out like some suggested because it was kind of runny.  Other than that it was easy to  make and talke about great flavor! Definately a keeper.

Made this last night. It was very good. Wasn't too sweet for us! Other reviews said about it being runny, so I just added an extra Tbsp. of flour. As soon as I took it out of the oven, it was runny, but after it cooled, it set up and was perfect! Not runny at all! I also added an extra tsp. of cinnamon in the crisp too. The crisp was delicious. Thanks for this recipe, its a keeper!

This was delicious, the whole family loved it. We doubled the recipe, deleted the white sugar, water and flour in the apples. The topping was sweet enough to compliment the apples.

Awesome recipe... I agree with some of the other reviews; the amount of water can be reduced to keep it from getting  a little too soupy. Or you can keep the water the same and use a straw to suck up the liquid; it is like the nectar of gods! I didn't have oats, so I crunched up some granola with almonds instead; it came out fantastic.

We loved this recipe. Thank you for sharing it! This is how we altered it and made it delish for my family. I DO NOT add water, I also use LESS apples because my family likes the "Crisp" aspect and not a lot of apples. - Just their preference. So I use enough apples to BARLEY cover the bottom of pan. For the crisp topping I DOUBLE the ingredients, giving it plenty of crisp to cover the apples and pan completely. When I make this dish my family finishes it off in one day and wants another made soon! Even my 3 year old LOVES it!!!

very good, but too sweet. I used Granny Smith apples and the topping is what I would say is way too sweet. Next time I will use only half of the sugar for the crumbs. otherwise it was great!

Made them for the first time last night.  We loved it.  I was able to prepare it while boneless breast was baking in the oven.  By the time we were finished with dinner it was ready to come out of the oven.  I was able to clean my kitchen while it was cooling down a bit.  We served it with vanilla ice cream.  The sweet crunchy deliciousness of it was almost more then I could bare. ALMOST L.O.L.

Love this apple crisp! It came out amazing... I gave it 4 stars because the topping needed more butter than called for, otherwise it came out powdery and grainy. But once that change was made it was great!

A lot of people suggested adding Nutmeg but I think its great just the way it is. :)  It is important to make sure that the apple slices (Granny Smith) are good sized. I cut the apples into quarters for the little apples and 1/8 for the larger ones. I will definitely be making this again.

Always a winner!  I made a little bit of extra topping and did add a little bit of nutmeg.  I did mix the apples (Granny Smiths) with the cinnamon/sugar mixture and then put the topping on.  Also, didn't melt the butter, just cut chunks working it into the topping mixture.  Everyone always loves it so this is my standard crisp recipe.  Great served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Highly recommended!

Perfect!  I cut the water in half, used Granny Smith's, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and doubled the topping to add some on top.  All my family and friends love it and ask for it at any gathering we have.

This apple crisp is seriously the best I've had.  Imagine yourself wearing a thick warm sweater kicking through the leaves on a beautiful autumn New England day...now you're almost there, add this apple crisp and everything is good in the world :)

AMAZING!!  I made this for my sister's birthday with some vanilla ice cream, and my entire family loved it.  The only change I made was adding some nutmeg and ground cloves for a little extra flavor.

I have made this recipe twice. Once omitting the water, soaking the apples, doubling the topping and cutting in the butter and once as the recipe is written with the exception of a splash of lemon juice in the apples and tripling the amount of cinnamon. Make the recipe as written first, it's great. Not too sweet (granny smith apples), not too runny and not lacking topping. Just right and gone in an hour.

BAKE THIS! This recipe is SO delicious. I used tart Granny Smith apples which really kick up the flavor. I also put in a lot more cinnamon than is prescribed. Finally, I doubled the amount of crumble topping- mmmmmm. Awesome Autumn recipe; I highly recommend.

Grandiose!  Don't change a thing!  It's almost too simple.  I used 3 very large Jonagold apples which filled the pan up about an inch and a half.  Used everything else as written.  Splendid flavor!  Serve warm.

This apple crisp was tasty, but too sweet for my taste (even when made with tart apples).  After reading the other reviews, I doubled the topping and it was WAY too much.  I like topping, but I couldn't even fit it all in the pan!  I will cut back on the sugar and make the amount of topping per the recipe next time, that should make it great!

This recipe is fantastic...The only this I added was a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Also I omittd the 1/2 c of water and let the apples soak in water while I mixed the rest, which was just enough moisture to make this great!

This was good! I used honeycrisp apples. I added 2 tablespoons cinnamon, nutmeg and a little vanilla to the apple mixture, and I only used 1/2 c brown sugar instead of 1 c white sugar. For the topping I used 1/4 c butter- came out fine!

Sensational!  I made this recipe as an afterthought because I felt like betty crocker as I was making dinner.  I added some fresh pears too from our tree out back which gave it even more fresh flavor.  Yummy!

Spectacular!  Followed the recipe exactly, and turned out perfectly!   Used Granny Smith, but I believe you can use any type of apple.  Very good, and whole family liked it, so seven thumbs up!

This is awesome!  The family loved it.  We made it gluten free with gluten free all purpose flour instead.  And I cut the sugar in half because our apples were really ripe.   I just wished I had doubled the topping like others said they did.  We will be making this again real soon.

I just made this tonight! I doubled the topping and added 1 tb of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also used Jonathan apples and didn't add any water since the natural juices from the apples was plenty of liquid. Baked for about 45 minutes and it looks and smells delicious!

SO dang good! We used 10 green apples, diced. Mixed them around with the flour/cinnamon sugar mixture and added 1/4 cup water. We accidentally used only about 6 tbs butter in the topping, but it still turned out deeeelicious. Thank you!

Great recipe and very easy! I am not sure what all purpose apples are but I substituted them for freshly peeled Gala apples and turned out great. I would also like to try next time with walnuts.

Yummy! I used just-picked Spartan apples, which were very sweet and juicy, so I omitted the water.  I also doubled the topping (mostly because I really love the crisp topping!!).  Turned out great!  I didn't find it too sweet as others have suggested.  Next time I will use a harder apple as suggested in the above reviews, as mine turned out quite mushy.

Delicious! I misplaced the apple crisp recipe that I've used for years so I gave this one a try. The result was the best apple crisp I've ever made. I used golden delicious apples and the only change I made was to eliminate the 1/2 cup water, as recommended by other reviewers. It turned out perfectly!

I followed the recipe exact with the exception of the water.  I omitted it like everyone said to and it came out awesome!  I used Granny Smith apples so the sweetness was just right.

This is awesome! I cut the recipe in half, and the apples were a bit watery. I also didn't have quick oats so I used 2 packets of breakfast oatmeal and 1/2 cup flour. The secret kicker was a bit of almond extract to the topping, that is a MUST!!! Delicious!

All I can say, is: AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! I took some reviewers suggestions and reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. sugar. It was perfect. No need to look any futher for an apple crisp recipe!

Wonderful apple crisp, just a little too sweet, and this is from a 'sweet tooth'.  Next time I will use a 1/4 c less of both sugars otherwise it was a huge hit!

I used Granny Smith apples and added 1/2 the amount of water as suggested and it was VERY runny, but still delicious. I also had to double the topping since the recipe amount didn't even come close to covering the apples. Next time I will omit the water completely and once again double the topping and it will be perfect. Everyone that came for dinner loved it.

This recipe was very good!  I used half of the water and next time will not use any water.  The topping did not look like enough so I doubled it.  Next time I will use 1.5 of what the original recipe calls for. I added chopped pecans to the topping.  The family loved it! It was gone in a flash!

Oh  my!!! This sounds so wonderful! My family is nuts about apple crisps and cobblers of all kinds!! I am curious about the baking soda & powder. What does it "do" for this crisp? I have never seen it before in any crisps I've made. I cant wait to try it!!!!

It doesn't need the water or at least only use half(and maybe use apple juice instead)  I added a little cinnamon to the topping.  Other wise it was simple to make and good.

I was disappointed in the results I got.  I followed the recipe and it came out way too sweet and very watery.  I used Honeycrisp apples which are not overly sweet in themselves and rather dry so I didn't anticipate any problems.  :(

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  I should have omitted the water like so many other reviewers.  When I took it out of the oven, there was still water in the pan - very unappetizing.  The apples were not seasoned enough.  However, the topping was delicious.  I made an apple crisp recipe a few weeks ago that was divine!  I couldn't remember which recipe I'd used.  This wasn't it!  Ugg!  What a waste of apples!

soo good! I found that adding 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the mix over the apples (like many other users suggested) was great, as well as eliminating the water. I also doubled the crust recipe... although twice the recipe was a little too much. Otherwise, really great recipe!

This is absolutely delicious.  I followed the advice of others and added a little nutmeg to the apples.  I also added a touch of clove which was good.  I added very little water - actually used the water to wash the sugar and spice out of the bown and put it in with the apples.  For the crisp part, I doubled the recipe which others suggested.  Although it was delicious, it was a bit heavy on the crisp, so I'd suggest doing the recipe with 1.5 times the crisp.  So delicious though!

This is the best apple crisp ever!!!!! DON'T put less h2o in it.. it's perfect. I'd say the baking powder and soda is pretty much worthless. It didn't rise the leased bit!

My husband loved this!  I used granny smith apples and added nutmeg to the apples.  Also I intended to use 1/4 cup of water but I forgot it all together and my husband was glad I did.  He says apple crisp can be very runny and that's why he liked this one so much is because it wasn't runny at all.  Also added some cinnamon to the crust.  I used a bag of granny smith apples (10 smaller ones) and the topping was the perfect amount!  Also cut the butter into the topping, added some vanilla, white sugar and just a tad of nutmeg.

I am a sweet lover but this was just way to sweet and I reduced the sugar by half cup already can't imargine if I didn't. It was also missing something maybe some fresh squeezed lemons on the apples or just something I also think the best apple for the raito of sugar will be granny smiths because of it's tartness it will ne perfect for this recipe...I used golden delicious

I'm only giving this a three star.  Most of the reason is my own mistake--I used canned apple pie filling.  I was so hungry for apple crisp and didn't have any fresh apples in the house.  So I substituted canned--NEVER AGAIN.  The crumb topping was a little too sweet for me.  Will try again--maybe this weekend--have granny smith apples.  Gonna add more oatmeal and less sugar.

Yummy. I had a craving for this, and it fit the bill. Just a basic, classic apple crisp.

I make this all the time and it is SOOO good.   I modify this recipe by adding a splash of nutmeg and no water.

This was really easy and tasted great. Hubby mentioned it could have been a little better if I didn't use Red Delicious.

I liked the taste, but I felt I was eating sugar with apples! (and I have a very sweet tooth)  I made half the recipe and used 5 1/2 medium granny smiths apple. Next time I'm cutting both the white sugar and the brown sugar by half!

It was delicious but I made changes and it needs a couple more.  I used four pears, 1/2 cp sugar, and 1/4 cp water, next time no water if I'm using pears.  I used all the same amounts for the topping but used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar and 5 tbsp butter.  Next time I will only use 4 tbsp butter and a pastry cutter made all the difference with the topping.

YUMMY!!!  I only had 6 apples (3 granny smith & 3 jazz) for about 7 cups of apples.  I used slightly less of the water and white sugar, everything else I did as the recipe called for.  Plenty of "crisp", not too sweet, not to tart.  Very good!!  Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!

This is wonderful! I did as one of the reviewers suggested and mixed the sugar / cinnamon / flour with the apples. Also added a dash of nutmeg. I only used 1/4 cup of water. And I cut the butter in with the topping rather than melting. This is delicious! Warm with vanilla ice cream = heaven!

This turned out great, just what I was hoping for! Delicious.  I had never made apple crisp before.  I cut the recipe in half, used a square glass pan, and forgot to add the water. I agree, the water is not necessary. I also coated the apples in the flour mixture, as someone suggested.

No extra water needed. I would add another teaspoon of cinnamon and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup. I used home canned apples and it only needed to bake for 30 minutes.

My family really liked this recipe.  I made according to the directions and it came out perfectly.  Other reviewers stated their recipe came out too watery.  I didn't experience that.  There was some juice in the bottom of the pan, but not enough for me to take much notice.  However, when I added the water, I poured it very slowly and evenly over the cinnamon and sugar that was on the apples.  I also let the water sit on the mixture for a few minutes while I mixed up the topping.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Excellent!!  I actually used 1 can of Lucky Leaf's Apple pie filling and used the topping below and it was delicious!  I didn't bake as long since apples were already soft so I would say I baked for 15-20 minutes..just enough time to brown the topping.  We added a scoop of vanilla yogurt. yum!!!

My boyfriend went back for seconds; he rarely does that. I doubled the amount of sauce, because I like it saucy. I had success using the same amount of farm-raised honey instead of brown sugar, and the same amount of canola oil in substitute for the butter. Also, I highly recommend Saigon cassia cinnamon... wow!

This turned out really well. The only change I made was to scale the recipe down to 4 servings since there are only 2 of us! I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was delish! It was a little sweet, maybe I would use a little less sugar next time, but on the whole this recipe was great!!

The recipe is more like 3 1/2 stars. I doubled the crust based on user reviews but found that with 2x the crust the 1 cup of sugar in the apples was WAY too sweet. Next time I will cut it down to 1/2 cup and keep the crust doubled. An addition I added was 1/4 cup of dried cranberries, they got all nice and juicy and it was really yummy. I also cut down the water to 1/4 cup. With changes, will be a 5 next time,

This crisp was absolutely amazing! I read the comments after I made it and was a little nervous about the amount of water added, I put in a half cup just like the recipe said, contrary to the reviews which said not to add the entire amount, anyways it still turned out incredible and I will definetly be using this recipe for all my future apple crisp ventures

I used macintosh apples because that is what I had. Also, baked in a glass pie plate since I think the round pie plate looks better. Didn't add water (macintosh are juicy), added the 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 TBL. lemon juice. All that was mixed in a plastic bag with the apples so there is no bowl cleanup. The second mix I did put some on the bottom. The rest on the top was alot since I put in the round pan (should have put more on the bottom layer). Great yummy results!

I made this for my mommy buddy for a playgroup and she loved it. I mixed the apples with the sugar/flour/water/cinnamon as it seemed the right thing to do and turned out great. I used golden delicious apples but I'll probably use granny smiths next time since the goldens seemed a bit bland. Also, I'd reduce the water to a 1/3 cup as the apples are swimming in liquid w/this recipe. I like sauce a little thicker. Definitely a keeper though.

This is a delicious recipe.  The only change I make is to decrease the brown sugar to 3/4c as the topping was a little too sweet for me.  I made it several times this fall per my 5 yr old daughter's request.

Delicious!  Used granny smith apples, the topping turned out so well, it was a hit!  Will probably use less water next time, it bubbled over a bit, and then when it cooled, it sloshed over the edge during transport in the car.

I made this with a combination of apples I got at a local orchard...it was outstanding!  Everyone who tried it agreed it was the best apple crisp they'd ever had.  My mom asked me if there was caramel in it - she said it had such a deliciously caramel flavor...the only thing I changed was I probably only used about 6 or 7 apples...I just kept putting them in till it looked like the right amount.  I thought 10 would've been a bit excessive.  I also only added 1/4 cup water to keep it from being too runny.  Some of the reviews said to double the topping...so unneccessary in my opinion!  It had a delicious and plentiful topping as directed. Thank-you for the yummy recipe!

Sooo! Yummy!  I had some old apples that needed to be used so chose this recipe since the 10 apples would help fill my need.  I made it out of necessity, but what a wonderful surprise...  The only thing I would change is to add pecans to the topping mixture, but it is wonderful without.

As far as apple crisp recipes go, this one is just fair. Perhaps the ingredient list is ok, but the preparation method leaves too much sugar on top. Next time I'm going to mix the sugar in with the apples.

Wonderful recipe!  Friends loved it, but it was a bit too watery.  I'll try this in the future with no water--the apples ended up producing even more water--and I'd like to try doubling the crust (which was extremely good, I only wished it was crispier and less crumbly).

Wow! This is sooooo good.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and splenda brown-sugar blend instead of brown-sugar.  1/2 cup of water for a double batch is necessary due to use of splenda.  Yum, yum, yum!  Hubby is already asking when I will make it again.

Delicious - a huge hit! I doubled the crumble recipe as suggested by others, but found that I maybe used 3/4ths of the amount. I could have added the rest but it seemed just too much. You could always layer the crumble as well if you double it. WIll definitely make again and again!

I was craving apple crisp, but had never made it before, and this recipe certainly didn't disappoint!  No need to try any more recipes, this one is great.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and doubled the topping and also halved the water in the apple mixture.  I've made this twice now, once with Galas and once with Granny Smiths, and I think I actually prefer the Galas.  I cut down on the sugar a bit when I used the Galas, and it was really great.  Though if you prefer a less sweet apple crisp, go with Granny Smiths.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

This was my first time making apple crisp and I found this recipe SUPER easy and my boyfriend loved it! I made mine in an 8x8 dish. The only thing I would change for the size of the pan is reduce the amount of white sugar used. Also, I didn't use any water and it still turned out amazing. :)

I bought a bunch of apples that were no longer "perfect".  I made this recipe with different apples and it turned out delicious!   Because it was Thanksgiving, I threw in a handful of cranberries.I made a recipe and a half of the "crisp" part.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was good. The topping could use a lil work. it was really hard and almost crunchy. It was still good. I used 4 granny smiths and baked it in an 8x8 dish. It fit perfectly. Serving this with ice cream is a must!

Absolutely amazing! I used granny-smith apples and double the amount of crust. Everyone loved it! It was even tasty warmed-up the next day. Will definitely make this again.

I followed ALL the suggestions by other reviewers.  Used granny smith apples, 1/4 cup water, nutmeg....  this recipe gets 4 stars because the crust was DRY.  It looked like quaker instant oatmeal before you added the water.  After adding the butter to it, it was still dry, so i doubled the butter, it was still too dry.  Next time I will add water until it's at least crumbly and crust-y.

This is a wonderful recipe! I thought the proportions for the topping were sufficient w/o doubling (unless you have a big sweet tooth). I did reduce the water to 1/4 cup, which was perfect.

good! cut recipe in half and made in 8x8 pan (used about 1 1/2 times the amount of topping, didn't melt butter, just cut in). The flavor was good and tasted yummy served warm with vanilla ice cream. Used golden delicious and i think next time i would use a more sour apple like granny smith. I rated it a 3 only because i think it was missing something that gave it that extra punch... more spices maybe? or maybe just the more sour apples will do?

I made this for my husband's annual thanksgiving lunch potluck.  It was delicious!  I did cut the water in half, cut the sugar in the apples in half and doubled the crust.  Next time I would use 1 1/2 times the crust instead of 2 times, as I felt the crust was a bit too thick.  Overall, I felt it was better than apple pie!

So delicious! Even my mom who has made her own recipe for years asked me for this recipe! I followed other reviews - mix apples with sugar mixture instead of sprinkling and double the topping. I've also made an 8 x 8 pan by halving recipe and even made mini servings for me and my hubby. Can you tell I like this??

I think this should have been baked a bit longer as the apples I used were still crunchy. I added some crushed cinnamon graham crackers for extra flavor. I would probably also double the topping next time. Otherwise, this is a great recipe!

Very, very good recipe. Definitely a keeper. I kept everything the same but I reduced the water to 1/8, not bad, not too runny but next time I think I'll leave it out. I used Granny Smith apples and added some nutmeg to the apples and doubled the toppping, perfect!! Thanks a bunch my family loves it!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did however leave out the flour and water that you put in with the apples.  If I had put the water in it would have been way too waterey for my liking.

I would give it five stars but I think the water made it too runny for my tatse. The other reviews were correct in that no water is really needed to make it really good. Next time I will double the crust like someone else suggested and put a layer on the bottom and one on top and omit the water

Awsome crisp recipe, I used to use a different one, but this is by far the best. I have made it at least 7 times this year. I just add a little lemon zest to the apples and cinnimon to the topping.

I recently made this using Northern Spy apples which I consider the absolute best for cooking and baking. I do not like my cooked apples to be hard but prefer an apple that cooks through but is not mushy. I doubled the topping recipe and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Very good, but too sweet.  Wish I listened to other reviews and decreased sugar.  Served with vanilla ice cream and it saved it...without it it would have been way too sweet to eat.  I also made another half batch of the topping...that's the best part!  : )

Fantastic!  Even my picky parents loved this!  I added less sugar than suggested. I used a variety of apples, some of which were tart.  It worked out fine.  I added all of the water which I was glad about since it helped during reheating.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!  I will make again and again.

i liked this recipe and was excited to make it for its crunchy topping. my family thought it was pretty good but could b much better. Some of their complaints included that the topping was too sweet (which i disagreed with)and that the apples could have been better. I sliced th apples too thin however and they would have been better a bit chunkier. The next day though I thought it tasted better cold.

This was awesome! I never made apple crisp before, but I will be making it often now! I used granny smith apples and the only thing I changed was using half the amount of water (1/4 C) and adding a pinch of nutmeg to the cinnamon mixture. I love sweets, but it was a little too sweet, even for me, so next time I will use 1/2-3/4 cup of white sugar.  Thanks for the post, I will be making this often!

Oh, This is soooooo good! My 4 year old neice and I enjoyed making this.  So easy to make.  I did what some of the other reviews said and only put 1/4 cup of water.  Let it sit before serving and then it's not too runny.  My 5 yearold already wants me to make it again.

I cut this recipe in half, used 4 Granny Smith apples in an 8x8 glass pan. I also used the normal amount of topping that you would use if you were making the whole recipe. This was AMAZING!!! I highly recommend it as a delicious fall treat.

I really liked this apple crisp. It was nice and hearty and tasted great with vanilla icecream. Perfect size for larger families. I made a few changes and would suggest a few. I read the other reviews and I add nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon/flour mixture. I tossed the apples in the spice mixture before putting them in the dish. I decided that the topping wasn't enough so I made one and a half of the amount. That was plenty. Next time I will cut the white sugar in half and I will decrease the brown sugar by 1/4 cup. This crisp was very very sweet, a little too much. I will also listen to the other reviews next time and cut the water down to 1/4. I can't wait to try this recipe again!

This IS THE GO-TO recipe on this site for apple crisp!  Yummy!! I even forgot the water and it is still so delicious... it would be even more "saucy" if I had added the water, but it is still a 5 star plus plus plus on my list!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out really good.  I would, however, cut down on the water depending on the type of apple used.  I used GALA apples which seem to be more of a juicer apple.  Would definitely make this again!

WOW was this apple crisp delicious!!  I cut the water in half like other reviewers recommended and it was perfect.  Some of the apple slices were thicker and came out a bit crunchy.  Next time I'll make sure to slice them thin.  Definite keeper in my book!

This is truly the best apple crisp I've ever had.  I followed reviewers' recommendations to cut the water in half; I also squirted a bit of fresh lemon juice onto the apples.  I used tart granny apples and 3/4 c. sugar.  The topping is fantastic.  This is truly one of the recipes on this site I've found.

I made this over the weekend, and it was good, but I would definitely take other reviewers suggestions and reduce the water (or not add any at all) I also thought it was a little too sweet for my taste. But it was easy to make and other then being a little watery and sweet we loved it.

I was so excited about this recipe -- feeling it had to be fool proof with all the positive reviews. I prepared as stated with a few suggestions taken from other reviewers(added vanilla, used OJ instead of water, used all brown sugar instead of white sugar), and it was still waaaaaaay too dry for my liking, even with the dollop of decadent gourmet caramel ice cream. Boyfriend liked it, and guest liked it, but since I know that better exists, I will either search out other recipes or tweak this one with more brown sugar and liquid to get it to the consistency that is more visually and tastefully appealing.

Absolutly delicious!! My fiance said it was the best he'd ever had. The only things I did different is that I used a few less apples and I doubled the topping and added cinnamon. The apples came out really tart for macintosh but everyone else thought that they were perfect!!! Definatly my go to recipe!!

Easy and very tasty but not perfect. Apples turned very mushy.  Will have again...might cook less.

I love apple crisp so much, and i have always just free handed it before, but this time I decided to follow a recipe. I picked this one because of all the great reviews, and I'm so glad I did, it turned out perfect! I did make more topping.

This crisp was SO good I am actually craving it! It was easy to make, and really delicious.  I took it to a party, and several people asked to take some home just to have some more.  Would make again for sure.  Maybe today!

it wasn't bad, but i took the advice of many reviews and cut the water down, which then made my crisp really dry?   i'll probably make a few changes next time.  but it's a good basic recipe.

Omit the water! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in both the mix & topping. I also added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts to the topping.  Must have it with vanilla ice cream! Great comfort food on a chilly night!

Great recipe! I've made it a couple times now. Tonight I realized at the last second that I didn't have brown sugar so used white with a bit of molassas. Since I was already deviating from the recipe, I also thew in a 1/2 t cinn., dash of nutmeg, and 1/4 c wheat germ. Worked like a charm! I also used just a few T water and I liked the consistency a lot better.

It turned out great all three times I've made it. I put a little less sugar in it because my family said it was a bit too sweet. But overall we loved it.

Yum, Yum, Yum! Nothing else to say really. I didn't make any changes and this recipe is FABULOUS! The only thing that would have made it better was ice cream. I think if you had double the topping like some people said it would have been too much. This recipe has a nice ratio of topping to apples.

The topping is perfect! My family raved over this apple crisp. It's definitely a keeper. As many of the other reviewers said, do not add water. It is not necessary. I use 4-5 large apples and the 1 cup sugar and lots of cinnamon and it turns out perfect every time with no water. Thanks!

Delish. Cut the recipe in half, used 6 apples: 3 honeycrisp and 3 granny smith. Added fresh nutmeg to the apples and a dash of cinnamon to the crumble topping. Excellent served with dulce de leche ice cream.

This is excellent! I do agree that the water should either be cut down (or even cut out completely). I had a little pool of water at the bottom of my pan. Still fantastic and I'll be making this again!

yummmy...yummy...yummmy...Luved this recipe. I had soo many apples in my fridge I didnt know what to do with them... if I made pie  I wud eat the whole pie myself since my husband is not that into pie. so I cam across this recipe and well the ratings and reviews were all positive.I didnt change a thing. I used whatever apples I had, a few galas and red delicious.I used probably 7-8 apples and will use more next time. I like more apples since they do shrink when baked.I did add a cup of raisins, walnuts and a fresh grating of nutmeg. um ummmm ummm delicious. I can't stop sneaking spoonfuls. It's definetly great in the fall season.. warm and delicious.thanks. will make again and again.

This is the best apple crisp I've ever had! I didn't change a thing when I made the recipe, however next time I would add more cinnamon and brown sugar for the bottom part (the apples I used didn't have the best taste in the world)

This is an exceptional simple recipe. I have tried many apple crisps and my company and I loved it. I would add 1\4 cup water-just a bit to keep it moist while baking. 3\4cup sugar is optimal here making the tart-sweet ratio perfect. I used 5 granny smiths but will use 6 next time. I made double batch of topping but used about 1 and 1\4 of it on top. I froze the additional topping for a smaller portion next time. I used 1\2 cup melted butter in the topping that I didn't freeze. I would have ice cream next time but not on top. The topping is too good to ruin it w ice cream on top of it. GREAT RECIPE!

This was absolutely delicious and exactly what i was looking for. With apple crisp, i think the more simple the recipe is ... the better! This straight forward recipe is PERFECT if your looking to prepare a classic fall dish with little fuss.  I did not change anything about the recipe except cut it in half because there are just two of us. Looking back, i should have made the whole batch ... it lasted mere minutes!  SIDE NOTE - I made with Jonathon apples which i don't believe are "typical" cooking apples. It added a little kick and turned out real nice!

This recipe was good. I did have to make a few adjustments though, doubled the oat topping, used cold butter instead of melted butter, reduced the water to 1/4 cup(will eliminate it completely next time), mixed the cinnamon sugar mix with the apples. With these changed its a 5 star but as is its only 4. Good though made it for thanksgiving dessert and everyone loved it. Thanks :)

Great recipe! I make this all the time, but I keep the peels on the apples. Gives it extra texture and keeps more of the nutrients in there. It's also great with pears!

Very good, especially with Granny Smiths.  I omitted the water but I won't next time, it was a bit dry without it.  This will be my new standard recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good, however, I did not add the water at all....decreased the white sugar to 3/4c. and added some cinnamon to the topping. I used Cortland, Macintosh, and Gala apples from the orchard. Thanks!

Excellent easy recipe to build from.Im gluten intolerant so I use my Gluten Free bake mix and I used a mix of 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda. I used 8 Cortland apples and doubled the topping. Instead of the half cup of water I used 2 tbs of Agave nectar and also tossed the apples in 2 tbs of lemon juice mixed with 1 oz of water. Delicious and lower carb!

WOW! This really is a "TO-DIE-FOR" recipe! I made it last night using 8 apples (Fiji and Red Delicious), reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of Allspice and tossed apples in the dry mixture along with some raisins prior to pouring only 1/4 cup of water to it. Also double crumb mixture like others (except butter) and baked for 55 minutes. I got a crumbly top, little crunchy apples and highly aromatic Apple Crisp as supper! These are also good for breakfast next morning… Definitely a keeper!!

This recipe is delicious as is, and I've made it a few times as is.  This weekend, I made it for a cookout with a few additions (2 more good shakes of cinnamon, 3 good shakes each of cloves and ginger; tossed the apples in the dry mixture to coat; only 2 T water) and people were LITERALLY eating it right out of the bowl...what a compliment!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as written but used a 3 lb bags of Macintosh apples(about 9 cups total). Oops, & I doubled the topping because I like it on the bottom too. It was UNBELIEVABLY good! It was perfection!

This was really great.  After reading all of the reviews, I used a bit less liquid, and I regret it.  I will follow the recipe next time and the only sub I will make is apple juice for the water.

This recipe is incredible. I only made a few alterations.  I doubled the crumb mixture, as so many suggested.  I also only added 1/4 cup of water because I sliced my apples on the thin side.  Lastly I added just a touch of nutmeg.  This was by far the best apple crisp recipe I've ever had. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was great.....even though I forgot the water...oops.  I also thought htere was way too much sugar...I 1/2 the recipe and that would be a whole cup of sugar in the entire recipe...gross.  So I just scanted the sugar portions and thought it was wonderful, especially with vanilla ice cream.

Doubled the topping; way too sweet even though I used tart Granny Smiths.  Might be ok if you used an entire package of whole cranberries.

Delicious!  I follwed recipe and it was so sweet and yummy. I forgot to buy ice cream so I topped with a bit of flavored coffee creamer (pumpkin spice flavor).  We had it for dessert last night and when I got up this morning the entire pan was gone!!  My kids loved it.

Very, very good.  If you like a little syrup on the bottom use 1/4 cup of water. If you want it to be more like a cobbler add 1/2 cup water.  I used 1/4 cup-not to dry or to runny.  Wonderful, it was gone the next morning.

I made this recipe exactly as written the first time and it was great. The next time, I increased the cinnamon a bit and added a sprinkling of ground ginger and ground cloves. It is out of this world delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

One word...AMAZING.  I added no water and sprinkled with cinnamon.  I could eat this for every meal every day of the week.  People had second and third helpings of it when I took it to a party.  So easy to make!

This recipe was very good. I followed the advice of others and doubled the topping and placed some on the bottom of the pan. This turned out really well but I think I needed to add the full amount of water. I only added 1/4 cup of water and it didn't turn out as juicy as I wanted. Will make again with some changes. Thanks

I have never been able to make a decent apple crisp!...until now...and everyone requests it...thanks to this wonderful recipe.  I do make a few changes.  First of all, to save time I make applesauce first.  I am the queen of applesauce...so this suits me, and it's easier!  Secondly I make 1.5 batches of the topping....use 1/4 on the bottom and 3/4 on the top (with applesauce in between).  I don't use much sugar in my sauce, but more cinnamon, and maybe a pinch of nutmeg. I've only made this with Macintosh apples, since we have our own trees.  Excellent recipe...thank you!

Really great flavor with a few modifications.  I would use a little less of the white sugar next time.  And whats with the water?  I thought that was a little weird but I put it in anyways and there was a pool of it at the bottom of the pan.

I used an apple machine to peel and slice my apples.  The apple slices were too thin so it ended up being like applesauce.  Next time I would slice them myself, thicker.  That said, the flavor of this recipe is UNBELIEVABLE!  I doubled the top and I would omit the water.  GREAT FLAVOR!!

absolutely,the BEST ever. I just made it this week. We had company and I needed a quick dessert. I had a bunch of apples and needed something with ingredients I usually have. This is so simple. I have now made it 2x this week. Everyone loved it,I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

This is an excellent recipe, especially if you are looking for a taste of Fall.  Since there is only 3 of us, I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8X8 pan.  However, I DID NOT cut the topping recipe in half.  I used the full recipe and it was absolutely delicious.  I served warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup.  This will be my Apple Crisp recipe from now on.  I don't know if it matters but I used Granny Smith apples as I do for all of my apple baking recipes.

Used 5 granny smith apples, reduced water to 1/4 c. as suggested by others, few dashes of nutmeg, 8x8 pan, baked for 40 minutes. I let sit overnight, then reheated the next day, served with vanilla ice cream. Turned out perfect, no leftovers!

This apple crisp is SOOO good! I used mostly granny smith's with a few ida reds.  Here are my changes: added about 1/2c dried cranberries to the apples (LOVE cranberries!), changed 1c white sugar in apples to 1/2c brown (too lazy to dig out the white), added 1/2c pecans to the crumb.  I found it was a little runny, too, so next time I think I'll half the water. My dad's apple crisp better watch its back!

We made this last night with a can of home-made apple pie filling and this was the best topping for a crumb topping I've ever found. Lots of topping and sweet and good. We put it in a 8X8 pan instead of a 9X13 and it worked out just right. Love it, Thanks for recipe, can't wait to try it on other fruit!

Excellent recipe.  When I saw the 1/2 cup water (and knowing that the apples would make even more juice)I increased the flour from 1 tbs. to 3 tbs. Cooked it for 15 minutes longer at a reduced temperature 325.  Better use a tart apple like Granny Smith or it will be too sweet.

BEST APPLE CRISP EVER. So delicious, I have impressed myself! And re: a recent reviewer, I did not make any modifications, the recipe is great as it is. I did use 5 very large Granny Smith apples, I don't know how that equates to pounds. Perfect fall recipe, your family will be impressed!

Honestly, best non-chocolate dessert I've ever made or had! I double the topping for some extra deliciousness. December 2010 UPDATE: If you're using sweet eating apples, you're missing out on the great sweet/tart combo. I usually use Granny Smiths, or a combination of those and sweeter ones. If using sweet apples, you might want to cut the sugar a bit.

Excellent apple crisp, and really easy to make!! I cut the white sugar in half, and I think next time I'll do the same with the brown sugar as well. It definitely doesn't need all the sugar asked for! I also cut the water to 1/4 c as others had suggested. And I added a dash of nutmeg. It came out really well!!! Next time I will try whole wheat flour rather than plain for the crumble. Very good!!

This is the best apple crisp ever, plain and simple.  I've made it numerous times and it always gets rave reviews.  People have said this apple crisp is the best they've ever had!  I use 8 medium granny smith apples.  I juice a lemon into a large mixing bowl, fill the bowl with water and toss the apples in to prevent browning.  Instead of adding 1/2 cup tap water I use the lemon water.  I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb topping.  It comes out perfectly, just the right amount of sweet and tart.  Excellent!

This is a very good recipe! I had a few adjustments:  I only added 1/2 a cup of water and it was still too watery.  The apples produce a lot of water so you'd be fine without it and then it wont get soupy.  6 apples is MORE than enough to fill a whole pan. I shaked them in a large bag with some white sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Then I reduced the amount of sugar it tells you to sprinkle over it.  I added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust portion.  Enjoy!

This recipe was AWESOME! Diane you should go in business with this one.  Years ago, I use to pay about 6.50 at TGIFriday's for apple crisp.  They no longer sell it.  However, this recipe is by far better than what I am use to.  Awesome!  Thanks for sharing.

Great Recipe! I followed the reviews and doubled the topping, though I think next time I'll only 1.5x it. (I think it's really about personal preference...my grandmother's used to have a very thin topping, also delicious.) I also only used 1/4 c. water, which I found perfect. I used a mix of spartan, mac, pink lady and granny smith apples. This recipe's definitely a keeper.

I should've listened to Amber Dawn and not doubled the crisp part of it! LOL I added 1/2 the amount of water it called for and it was still very soupy at the bottom.  This was an okay recipe, but I'll probably stick with my Moms. :)

I make this recipe especially if it's I have tons of apples on hand.  The only change I made with this recipe is instead of adding 1/2 cup  water I only added 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup maple syrup, and another 1/2 cup of oats.  I love oats and it's good for you.  I think the maple syrup helps to thickened the sauce.

This was very good! I'm pregnant with my third child and all I've been thinking about is apples - this really hit the spot! I scaled it down to 4 servings and didn't have any trouble with it being too sweet or too moist or not enough crust.

Used half the sugar on the apples, as I used a sweetish eating apple (Spartan's). Still found it just a little sweet, however. Will try this again with Granny Smiths as others have suggested.

Just a few changes... I only added 3 Tbs of brown sugar to the apple mixture, as well I added lots of cinnamon & about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I added more butter too, about 3/4 cup in total.  One final addition was a couple of handfuls of raspberries & blueberries!  It was really yummy, none left!

This recipe is great.  I've used it a couple of times.  This winter I made 3 of these to put in my freezer. I took one out the other day and it was delicious.  I love it with a chunk of sharp cheddar or with whipped cream.  I'll definitely make this again when apples are in season in Minnesota.

Definately a crowd pleaser.  I used granny smith apples and used no water.  I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I doubled the topping mixture and placed half in the bottom of the pan. I tosssed the apples in the cinnamon/flour/nutmeg mixture then placed into pan.  I topped with remaining mixture.  It was yummy and everyone wanted the recipe.

I have made this recipe a few times now.  It is very easy to assemble and tastes so good! I did follow some suggestions and use only 1/4 cup of water, which has worked well every time.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for half of the white sugar. I have used Granny Smith apples every time and wouldn't use another variety. The tartness is perfect with the sweet sugar and crumble. I can't stop eating this once it's out of the oven!

I used this recipe as a base for strawberry crisp and it was delicious. I followed a lot of reviews. This is what I changed; I halved the amount of white sugar in the berry mixture and added a touch of nutmeg. I omitted the water all together. I also doubled the topping, used whole oats and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  The mixture had a lot of liquid, so the water isn't needed. It was delicious!

The first time I made this it was a little too sweet. So I cut out half of the white sugar and it was perfect for me.

I only have one apple crisp recipe I use but thought I would try another one just to see. The only change I made was I only used a half a cup of the white sugar. THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD. This is my new favorite crisp recipe. The topping never got gloopy, really kept it's shape and when reheated tasted like cobbler. mmmm yummy.

This was very good and satisfied my craving for something sweet and oaty. I didn't melt the butter. I cut it in so the mixture would be crumbly. I also added some extra oats. I may have cooked mine a little too long because my apples were almost too soft like applesauce, but it was still delicious. I like the topping best anyway!

Has the potential to be great.  I followed the recipe exactly and it had way too much liquid.  Next time I will cut the water in half or ommit completely.  Also, the topping would be good if increased by 50%, however, I don't think I would increase the sugar, it is plenty sweet! Overall, a great recipe.

ABSOLUTELY amazingly tasty!  This one gets picked at by all members of my family looong after dessert is served.  You just can't walk by without taking a taste. I too, did reduce the water to 1/4 C, and that seems to be just right.  I also tossed the apples in the cinnamon/sugar mixture before laying them in the cakepan.  Most importantly, however, is that I make double the oatmeal topping.  It's naughty, I know, but I haven't gotten any complaints YET! MMMM...I just made a batch....

Perfect with a little extra cinnamon and a scoop of french vanilla ice cream!  As suggested by other reviewers I halved the water and the consistency was perfect. I also added 2 extra tsp of cinnamon... one to the apples and one to the crumble. This will certainly be my new crumble recipe!

YUM!!!  This was great...and as always I try to keep to the recipe as exact as possible if I am going to be writing a review.  I can't stand when someone rates a recipe with a ton of changes and then rates it low.  With that said, I did use the web site to scale the recipe down to only one serving since my hubby has been working out of the country for the past two months...it was just me.  I used a Gala apple and the one thing I did not follow in the recipe was to peel the apple.  I love the apple peel and the extra fiber is an added plus.  I used the measurements exact as stated in the recipe and I thought it was wonderful.  Could maybe cut down just a little bit on the sugar, but I don't think it needs double the crumb topping like many reviewers stated.  I also thought after scaling the recipe down to one serving it was still a very large serving.  It very well could have been two.  So the 12 servings the original recipe states could easily serve 20 in my opinion.  I obviously didn't use a 9x13 pan, but I used a small round oven safe dish and I baked it in the toaster oven...why heat up the entire oven for one serving?  I did not bake it for the full 45 minutes.  It was more like 35, but that could have been because the toaster oven baked it faster.  At any rate...it was absolutely delish!!  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this for my hubby when he gets home in another month.

Very good, but could be a little sweeter for my taste. I would cut the baking time down next time- the apples got a bit too done. A bit dry, maybe more butter?

I know that everyones rating is high on this but my family didn't really care for it. My husband was the only one who went back for seconds. Tried it on the day I made it and the next day. I did make the extra topping and it to me tasted like a granola bar or something you would grab for a fast breakfast. Will not be making it again.

This was just delicious!  As other reviewers suggested, we only used 1/4 cup of water, and also tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon (with a little nutmeg added) instead of sprinkling it over the top of the apples. We used granny smith apples, which worked very well.  With these small changes, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was a great recipe.  The only reason it has four stars was because of the amount of sugar, I decreased it amount of sugar as others noted and it was still a little sweet.  I had a ton (a massive tin of applesauce that my evicted roommate left here and I was able to get rid of about 3/4 of it in this recipe, hence I did not use sliced apples and had to increase the flour to 2 Tbs and extra cinnamon because I love it.  Next time, if I am able to afford it, I may use a bit of nutmeg just to experiment but I will definitely use sliced apples.  It did turn out like a nice apple-ish pudding with a nice and crispy top and tasted good, thanks and my other two roommates thank you as well, as they devoured it in one night!

Wow! There are recipes you look for hoping to find that forgotten awesome dish you remember as a kid. This actually tasted better than what I was wishing for. It tastes better a day or two after you make it as the apples are marinated.  Fantastic!

Delicious!  I didn't have apples, so I used 6 green Anjou pears that were sitting on my counter for 6 days. Used 1/2 recipe for the pears and kept the full recipe for the toppings.  Got rave reviews, everyone's favorite was the topping.

I added 1/2 tsp of cardamom to the recipe and used only 3/4 c of sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar for the topping..I added no water and it came out really yummy but next time I would even decrease the sugar and brown sugar to 1/2 c as it is still too sweet..very yummy on a cold day!!

Easy to make and good crisp. I found the filling too sweet, though, even though I used Granny Smith apples. Next time I will cut down on the sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  Instead of water I added about 1/4 cup of orange juice and with the sugar and flour sprinkled on top of the apples (granny smiths, of course) I added a couple of tablespoons of graham cracker crumbs.  They help thicken up the juice and add a little more flavor.  Served it warm with warm English Custard and it was fab.

The best apple crisp I have ever had.  Look no further.  I did, however, upon other reviewer's suggestiong omit the water and doubled the topping.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This is excellent. I just made this because I had some apples that I really had to use.  I only had 3 so I chopped those up and added 3 pears.  I also added nuts-I had some pecans and walnuts and threw those into the mix. The result was delicious!  I will make this again and again.

This was great tasting!!  I used granny smith apples which were perfect.  I doubled the topping (perfect amount) and left out the water.  When you use granny smith apples they produce enough of their own liquid when you bake them in the oven.  Adding water would have made this soupy.  I cooked it in the morning and rewarmed it in the oven at 250 degrees for 10 minutes before serving.  Delicious!!

AMAZINGLY GOOD.  Just the right amount of topping.  I added a little more cinnamon and some nutmeg and decreased the water to a couple to Tbsp per other reviews.  Will be making this again and again.  Everyone loved it.

Pretty much perfect. I think the best part about this recipe is the nice consistency it makes from the apples/water/sugar/flour. Only a couple mild changes: I added more cinnamon and nutmeg to both the apples (1 1/2-2 tsp cinn, 1/2-1 tsp nutmeg) and the topping (1 tsp cinn, 1/2 tsp nutmeg), and cut down on the butter by a quarter to a third. I think the extra spices really kicks up the homey flavor and the extra butter isn't really necessary and just increases the fat content. Also, I would use a variety of apples if possible, some sweet, some tart. Skip the most typical grocery store apples, they are boring. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect.

This is one of the most delicious dessert recipes I have ever made. I used pink lady apples because they are the sweetest apples. I love the crumb cake topping, this can defintely be used in other recipes including crumb cake. I ended up only using 3 apples with the same portion of crumb topping. I thought I had more apples to use. This dessert only lasted 2 days in my house.

This was a very good base recipe, however the first time I made it (exactly as the recipe read) I found it to be too runny and it didn't have enough crispy topping for my family's liking.  So the second time I made it, I only used 1/4 c. water and I also doubled the topping recipe (except for the flour- I accidentally just used 1 c. flour, and it turned out great!)  Anyways, my suggestion for adding the water is if you plan to serve it warm, DO NOT use any water because it makes it soupy.  But if you plan to serve it after it has cooled, go ahead and use about 1/4 cup water.  With these changes, this is definitely my "go to" recipe for apple crisp!

I made this apple crisp for Christmas, I added a 1 lb. bag of frozen whole strawberries, which I quartered. I also doubled the topping as stated in other reviews. There was none left, so I had to make another pan for myself. Tastes just like Grandma used to make!

What a delicious apple crisp!! This will definitely be my go-to dessert from now on.  When I make it the next time, I only have a few wee changes I'll make: use orange juice instead of water (I used 1/4 cup as per suggestions), and reduce the white sugar (it wasn't too sweet for me but 1 cup seems like a lot and I'm sure I won't notice if there's only 3/4 cup).

Not only did this taste great, it made the entire house smell incredibly warm and wonderful on this snowy day~

I cut the brown sugar to 2/3 cup and the melted butter to 1/3 cup, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and a splash of vanilla~

I needed to use up a lot of apples before they went bad, so I tried this recipe. It was much easier than making an apple pie. It was VERY sweet. I think I'll try spenda or something next time. I'm soooo glad that I took the ohers advice and did not add any water. There was PLENTY of juice as is. It was delicious!!!!!

Great recipe. I have made this twice now. The first time I made no changes and used a mix of Pink Lady apples and Granny (half and Half). With the tartness of the granny the amount of sugar was not too bad, but still too sweet for me. I did (as my mom always did when I was growing up) make extra topping. The second time I only had enough apples on hand to make it half batch. It still turned out great (using the same mix of apples), but I did make sure to cut the sugar back more than half. I didn't have any problems with the amount of water in the recipe as some other reviewers mentioned. However, I have an OLD oven that uses a fan and usually dries food out. So I think the water helped to keep it moist. I will definitely use this recipe as a base from now on. It's flexible and hard to go wrong!

Very tasty, but the "crisp" part of the dessert - the topping, could have been a little crispier. Otherwise, very yummy - especially warm with vanilla ice cream.

I made this with 8 apples, and it was still way too much for my 8x12 pyrex. I ended up putting leftover apples in a smaller one and baking two pans of it. Otherwise, great taste especially with vanilla ice cream!

Recipe is awsome. I found it to be a bit watery though. I don't think I will use water next time because the juices from the apples will come out as it bakes.

***Excellent***  The topping stays nice and crisp for leftovers, does not get mushy.  I used Braeburn apples fresh from an apple orchard, omitted the water, and was very satisfied.  My family gobbled it up over a few days, and that was after giving half away to a neighbor. I did double the topping as was suggested.  If you have a super sweet tooth, this is for you.

I usually don't like any baked apple goods, but this apple crisp is just delicious. I almost ate the whole thing myself!! I used 4 granny smiths and 2 rome apples, and followed other reviewers' advice and used 3/4 cups of brown/white sugar. The finished product was a little on the sour side, but was still splendid.

Definatley a keeper but needed some more flavor. My alterations were adding 3T cinnamon, 1t nutmeg and coating the apples w/the mixture. Also doubled the topping mix and added 3T cinnamon, 1t nutmeg, extra butter.

This was okay.  It was way too sweet for our taste.  The sugars overwhelmed the flavor of the apples.  I loved the oatmeal in the topping.  I would make it again but use half the sugar.

I have made this probably 3 times in the last 2 1/2 wks. It is delicious! I did cut the sugar back in the apple mixture, and it ended up being perfect. thanks!

Very good.  I did make a few changes based on reviews, one being halving the amount of water to the apple mixture (I used Granny Smiths).  Unfortunately lessening the water ended up making the apple crisp a little dry.  I would not do so next time.  Great recipe, although I prefer one of the other ones on this site because I love the oatmeal cookie flavor the topping has on that one.

Excellent recipe.  It makes a lot! I usually double the topping based on feedback from the family.  Have plenty of vanilla icecream on hand also.

This apple crisp is AMAZING. I used 8 granny smith apples and doubled the topping ingredients. Kept the water the same(which makes a great sauce)and it came out perfect.

This was great. I made it for Bible study and it was gobbled up. I added extra apples, using mainly granny smith, but throwing in a couple of too-soft-for-raw-eating galas. I also made some caramel sauce with brown sugar, heavy cream and a touch of vanilla and some homemade whip cream with chopped pecans. YUMMMMY. I love recipes that showcase fall foods and this is definitely going to be repeated at my house!

I'd suggest reducing the amount of water added, this crisp came out soupy. I drained quite a bit of water out of the bottom of the pan after the first serving was taken...I might not add any water next time. Other than the excess water, this crisp was wonderful and I'd definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe was pretty good but I think next time I will use less sugar. I didn't melt the butter, instead I cut it into the flour/sugar mixture which turned out ok. I don't think I used the right kind of apples as they lost their texture, but my family really liked it.  I will probably try this again.

OMG!!  Add me to the list of converts!!  This recipe is amazing. I cut it in 1/2 because I was only making it for my family of 4.  After I tasted it I could hardly wait the 5 hours until after dinner to dig into it.  The absolutely best part about it, in addition to the taste, is that it is so incredibly easy to make and relatively low fat, compared to some of the other apple crisp/cobbler recipes online.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe, it was just awesome!

Yes - it's really that good!!  I cut recipe in half but followed proportions, it was not too watery for us.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  Tasted even better the next day - who knew it was possible to improve on perfection?! What more can I add that hasn't already been said?  Make this apple crisp, you won't be disappointed.

This was good when first cooked, but after refrigerating it the crust was soggy and not very tasty.  Next time I will half the recipe so it can be eaten in one evening.

Very good! I didn't add the water. I wish I had though, it wasn't dry, but I think it could have had more liquid. And I did double the topping. Everyone enjoyed it, and it went pretty fast. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this again, this time 10 years later we don't eat much sugar. This is still a good recipe, even after me only puting an 1/8th of a cup of coconut sugar on the apples, and then 1/4 cup of coconut sugar in the crumble. // 10/24/2018 I forgot the water on the apples, and it still came out wonderful. I will definetly make this recipe again.

This is the BEST recipe ever.  I didn't add water and I used Apple Pie Spice instead of cinnamon, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I made it once for the family and they loved it, so I made it again and brought it in to work.  It was a hit.  I plan to make this recipe often.

Yummm! We loved this. I did not use as much cinnamon and sugar on the apples as called for, just mixed it up till it looked right and it came out fine. Next time I will eliminate some of the water that gets poured on as I did not like the soupiness in the bottom of the pan, but it still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!

THis was ok.. I like to cut back on fat and sugar so I used 1/2 Cup white sugar and I cut the butter down by just a couple of Tablespoons.. which in turn made the topping little dry.. yikes .. I will next time use the full amount of butter. other than that it was easy and my kids loved it.

I tried this recipe for the first time and I haven't done much with apples before.  I find its the best when you mix your portion up in a bowl before you eat it.  This spreads the great topping to all the apples.  I have 50 pounds of apples to go through so I think I'll be making this one a lot in the next few days.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It is like french apple pie without the crust.  If you have an apple peeler and a food processor, it only takes 15 minutes to prepare the apples. I used golden delicious apples, but any apples would be good. I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed both the recipe and some suggestions of the reviews. I mixed the apples with the sugar and spices while cutting them up to get out all the juices, didn't add water, doubled the topping, and cut the butter in instead of melting it. When I make this again, I will NOT double the topping, but keep the other changes. I will also cut back on the sugar. It's too sweet for us and we enjoy the apples much more than the topping.

I have made this recipe twice now with raving reviews, a couple changes, 3 cups of apple instead of ten, grated the apples, and doubled the crust (half on the top and half on the bottom) recipe and served warm with ice cream.

Excellent Recipe.  I used my my apple peeler/slicer which took alot less time then peeling and slicing by hand.
I use more apples then recipe called for and a little more sugar to make up the difference. Use all different type apples. Basically, whatever ones were in the house. 
Very Easy to make.
Great for a gathering

This was fantastic!  I added 3/4 cup pecans to the topping, used 1/4 cup water, & tossed the apples in the cinnamon & sugar mix.  I used granny smith apples & it was still a little too sweet for my taste.  I'll cut down the sugar next time.

I used Red Top apples. Will make it again with Green apples.  Added some raisins in with the apples. Water was enough - like a bit of sauce. I reduced the sugar because of the sweet apples.

Good! Made it with Granny Smith apples, which gave it a nice tartness and kept the apple slices in an apple shape.

I am a farmwife so I decided to try this recipe after reading the reviews.  I took the suggestion of other reviews and doubled the crust recipe and I had read were some people either used no water or 1/4 cup of water.  I replaced the water with 1/4 cup of rum sprinkled over the apples then put the crust on top. The rum in it was good.  Then I took out some Whipped Cream to put on top of the apple crisp and than drizzled some caramel topping over all of it.  The guys said the only thing they would have liked better was ice cream instead of whipped cream but ice cream is hard to take out to the field.

Fabulous recipe!  As others recommended, I cut the sugar for the apples in half.  I used Granny Smiths and the sweetness/tartness was just right.  I was unsure about doubling the topping so I made the recipe as is and then decided another 1/2 recipe of the topping would be enough.  For personal taste reasons, I also increased the cinnamon in the apple mixture to 1 tablespoon.  I never got around to buying the vanilla ice cream but no one missed.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Wow!  Homemade apple crisp never tasted so good!  The 13 x 9 pan size provided yum yums for my family of 5 for about 3 days.  Of course, I doubled the crisp and made top and bottom crust.  I added 1/8 teaspoon of cloves to the apples in addition to the cinnamon.  This is a keeper FOREVER!!!  Thanks and hugs to all this Fall!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I used what apples I had on hand...a granny smith, some galas, and not sure what the rest were but they were slightly tart. Very good apple crisp.

This recipe was AMAZING!  My kids loved helping do the apples (we have one of those peeler, corer, slicer gadgets).

Although I folled the recipe almost exactly, I made a procedural change by mixing the dry ingredients for the apples together then putting them in a big Ziplock bag.  I then added the diced apples and shook the bag until they were all evenly coated with the mixture.

Also, I reduced the sugar just slightly in the crumble and added some Turbinado Sugar (Sugar in the Raw type stuff) to the top.  The extra rich flavor and crunch was awesome.

Very good! I also halved the apple portion as I wanted to make smaller amount. I baked it in an 8x8 pan, but still used almost the full amount of topping - I probably had about 1/2 c. extra that was just too much.  The only other change I made was to use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think this is the best apple crisp I have ever made.  I did use just 1/4 cup of water and also 1/2 cup of sugar in the apples.  I also doubled the topping and mixed half of it in the apple mixture also.  Made for an amazing apple crisp that I will definitely keep and use often.  One word Amazing!!!

It was really good but REALLY sweet.  I used McIntosh apples, which I suppose are a bit on the sweeter side, but I think I could have probably halved the sugar and been fine.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. Next time, I will cut down on the sugar and use a little less water. Otherwise, it was perfect! Definately a keeper!

Because we love the topping so much (who doesn't), I used 1 1/2 the amount.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust.  It was a huge recipe, now that we are empty nesters but my husband didn't complain about having lots of leftovers.

Good: Great flavor, good amount to serve for a dinner of 6-8.
Bad:  I baked this for 30 minutes instead of 45 to keep the apples a little firm and from turning to applesauce.  It was perfect! But, when serving, it was way too watery, even after setting over night.  Next time I will try baking it without any water.  Second, I cut the butter into the topping mixture, it was yummy, but not very pretty and not very crispy.  I think I was mess around with either substituting white sugar for brown or a combo of both.

I have been looking for an apple crisp that is as good as my mom's and this might even be better!  Really fast and easy and really good.  I used Granny Smith apples.  Next time I might add a little nutmeg like somebody suggested but it was really perfect as is.  Thanks for the great recipie!

This is the best apple crisp.  I like to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream, so yummy!  I double the topping and used a mixture of granny smith and red delicious.

The recipe ie great!  I used Fuji apples so my crisp came out too sweet which was my fault, but the topping and consistency was good.

A-MAZING!  I took the advice of a few different reviewers: added NO water and doubled the "crisp" topping.  Eek!  That was way too much topping for me.  Next time I'm not changing a thing.  I know it'll be just perfect as-is.  GREAT recipe.  Oh, I did use Granny Smith apples and those work beautifully.

This was super good. I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup of the water. I didn't add enough apples though...probably only 2/3 of what the recipe calls for so it was really sweet...but all the same it was a huge hit at the Youth Group my husband and I run. Just made it again 9/30/09 and it was really good. The only adjustments I made was to cut the wate to 1/4 cup again and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. It was still a little watery though so nect time I'll add another 1/2 tablespoon of flour in the apple mix. Really good though.

This was my first apple crisp with oats, and I guess I'm not a fan of it baked this way.  I'll stick with my mom's recipe that I grew up with from now on.

This is my favorite apple crisp recipe. I will forever use this! I used some of the suggested changes: only 1/4 water, put the apples in the sugar mix, doubled the crust and I cut in half of the butter and melted the other half. It was so perfect! I can't wait to have my husband try it! He will be so impressed. Tomorrow I am going to make it again, only with peaches.

This is awesome!  I have made this for family holidays, and people have asked for the recipe.  The only modification I have made is to adjust the white sugar depending on the sweetness of the apples I use.  Otherwise, I use as is.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This apple crisp was delicious! I made it for the birthday party I threw for my husband yesterday because it's one of his favorites. I was nervous because I had never made it before & I had to do it in a hurry, but it turned out perfectly! Everyone raved about it & couldn't get enough. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I used peeled (personal pref.) Granny Smith apples and did mix the apples and sugar mixture before putting it in the pain.  I also added nutmeg and a little bit of apple juice instead of water as others have suggested.  I cut the butter into the topping to get a cripsy crust.  It was a hit and was gone by the end of the party.

Yummy, though I changed the recipe slightly (as usual). I doubled the topping, using 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. Also, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup Country Crock in place of the butter. I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup water, but next time I'll try 1/2 cup water because this seemed a bit dry. Great otherwise though!

I was not as "wowed" as others on this recipe.  I was not sure how many apples would make 10 cups, so I followed the suggestion of someone else and used 6 (what I would consider) medium Granny Smith's.  This was WAY too much for my 9x13... especially when I doubled the topping, which was another suggestion from someone else.  I did not bother peeling the apples... just cored and sliced.  You wouldn't know it was there if you didn't see it.  I did toss the apples with the sugar/cinnamon mixture as opposed to pouring it over top of them because I thought it would distribute it a bit more evenly.  I used about 3/4 of the double batch of crumb topping and I think it was too much.  The fact that it was piled on so high made it seem dry to me.  If I had it to do over again, I would either used the amount of topping called for, or put half of what I used under the apples so it could have absorbed some of the juice.  There was something that seemed a little off about the flavor to me.  I used the nutmeg as suggested, which may have been it.  I took it to an Easter dinner and the other guests seemed to like it which is why I'm giving 4 stars.  If not for them, I probably would have gone with 3.  Another note:  your pan will look like it's overflowing before you put it in... but it will lower into the pan as the apples cook down.

Delicious!  As suggested, I added some nutmeg to the apples and upped the amount of the crumble a bit.  Served this to company and everyone enjoyed it.

This turned out good but a little more liquid than I liked, even when using the other reviewers suggestions to us 1/4c. water. It was probably due to the fact that I used yellow delicious and gala apples. Other than that it is was very tasty. Thanks for post.

I made a huge tray of this for a party and brought it and baked it there, everyone loved it! Served with vanilla bean ice cream. I used whole wheat flour and doubled the topping like everyone said to put half on the bottom, although I found that to be a bit mushy. Upped the spices, and used 10 apples, and only 1/4 cup water. Yum! It was sooooo good!

I made this recipe with Melanie's suggested changes to terrific fanfare. There is more sugar in this recipe than I would normally allow myself to use, and found that it adds good texture. Vanilla ice cream cut the sweetness perfectly. I doubled the crumble topping and split the apples between two pie plates so that I could share with my neighbor.

I made this over the weekend and it was very good.  I did change it up a bit though.  I doubled the crust topping-the best part!  Yum.  I also reduced the amount of water since the apples seem to let out juices as well.  I used about 1/4 cup of water and I mixed in about a tablespoon of vanilla with the water.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar when initially coating the apples.  I also used a little dash of nutmeg in the crust topping mixture as others did suggest.  One thing that I did not do because of time, but will definitely do next time is peel the apples.  Otherwise, it turned out great.  It went perfect with some vanilla ice cream.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Very nice basic, a comfort food classic. I think next time I'll add some cinnamon to the topping mix as well and maybe some corn starch to the water to thicken it a little. All in all very good starting point, try it as written first then tweek a little to your taste.

Holy cow!  The best apple desert EVER!  And I was never a fan of apple anything.  I followed the other reviewers' advice and put crisp on top and bottom.  I rolled the apples in the sugar mixture+nutmeg before laying it in the pan.  Also, I soaked the apples in water before I baked it because I didn't have enough time to throw it in the oven before it turned brown; so, I didn't add any water.  It came out perfect.  Note: Remember the vanilla ice cream!

Great recipe, the whole family loved it! I only had Golden Delicious on hand, so I used those and cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup. I did not decrease the water as some did. I like the gooey stuff and it worked great. Next time I think I will try decreasing the brown sugar to 2/3 cup. Great recipe and very simple to prepare.

Good apple crisp recipe.  Make sure your apples are peeled.  Also, I took the advice of other readers and doubled the crust recipe.  I thought it made way too much and will only use the regular recipe next time.

This is a lovely recipe, that reminds me of a crisp my mother makes. It gets high marks for flavor, but you can also use the crumble recipe on a variety of other things. It's an all around great recipe that lets the home cook expand their repertoire.

This recipe was super easy and my boyfriend loved it!  I modified slightly based on other reviews... I used 5 gala apples and tossed w/ the sugar mixture (1/2 brown and 1/2 regular) before hand. The apples were so juicy NO water was needed. I baked in an 8 x 8 square dish w/ the regular amt of topping for 40 minutes and it was perfect. Delicious w/ Vanilla bean ice cream!

This is a good, basic recipe.  I usually have most of the ingredients on hand, and it's easily modifiable to suit your tastes (for example, drizzle some caramel over the top and serve with a scoop of ice cream - yum!).

This is my "go to" recipe here in the fall in New Hampshire when the apples are plenty! Everyone asks me for seconds and then the recipe. I sub out half white sugar and half brown sugar in the apple mix. Otherwise, I follow exactly. Thank you for such a delicious recipe that will someday be "an old favorite" of ours!

AWESOME RECIPE! The apples turned out so soft that they melted in your mouth and I loved how the oatmeal made the topping taste. I made this twice in a week and everyone loved it.

Delicious! I would use less water. I used 1/4 cup and it was very watery at the bottom. It wasn't a "sauce" like others mentioned. I wouldn't use Granny Smith- I used 1/2 Granny and 1/2 Cortland, I never use Granny and I can see why, too tart for me. Otherwise, I made 1/2 extra topping and it was perfect with 1 and 1/2 the topping. Yummy overall!

mmmm great recipe!  I also cut down on the water I used.  However, if I was to make it again, I would use brown sugar in the apple mix instead of white.  The white is grainy.  When I make apple pie I use brown sugar, I almost did when I made this, but I wanted to try the recipe the way it was.  All in all..you won't go wrong with this recipe!

This is the only dessert recipe I've come across that I actually had to do nothing to make it taste better. My husband and guests and I LOVED it. The only thing I changed (because I didn't have regular oats on hand) was I substituted in two of those individual serving caramel apple flavored oatmeal packets. I don't know if it made much of a difference, but this turned out superb. (and it was my first time making an apple crisp recipe ever.)

I had a friend call me last night and said she has been dying for "my apple crisp" and could I pleeeease make her one. I had to come back and reprint the recipe and wanted to reinterate what everyone else said. This is the best apple crisp. I always make it when the inlaws are in town or to take to a friends house. Great comfort food ladies!!
I also cut the water in half and double the topping with a little cool whip on top. I strongly suggest purchasing an apple peeler, mine has a built in de-corer so it makes it so easy to make! (Can also use it to peel the dreaded potatoes!) One last thing, I have made using the Splenda white and brown sugar..trying to make myself feel better about eating a huge bowl of it and it turned out really well.

after popping this BEAUTIFUL dish into the oven, i realized i completely forgot to put the sugary dry mix over the apples, so the dish was totally ruined and i had to mash everything together. it still came out "okay" but it looked hideous and the flavor of course was no mixed correctly. will try again asap! Two tips: 1. dont forget any ingredients. 2. add some nutmeg, but not too much. it totally overwhelmed all over flavors last time.

I baked this yesterday and it was sweeped at once :) i got compliments from every single one on the table :) i just love apple crisps, thanks to a friend who told me about it. Next time am gonna double the crisp topping and maybe add some to the bottom and use sweeter apples... since i think the apples i used were a bit sour so they gave this tangy taste to it... and i think it needs more than 45 mins in the oven in order for the topping to turn goldish-brown ;) but in general YUMMMMMY :)))

Simply divine!  I did follow others' suggestion to double the crumb part and put half on bottom.  I used 7 large Granny Smith apples and tossed them with the sugar and cinnamon (with 1/4 t. nutmeg added) mixture to coat well.  I also used about 1/4 cup apple juice instead of water.  I got lots of compliments and will definitely make again!  Thanks!

I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe.  I did what others suggested and reduced the water, but it still came out very watery.  Also, next time I will peel the apples.  The recipe didn't indicate to peel them, but I definitely will next time.  The flavor was good, but the next time I will double the topping.  It also needed to be cooked longer because the apples were still too crispy.

Loved this one! My 9x13 pan was being "occupied" by brownies, so I halfed the recipe and baked it in my round, stoneware Pampered Chef dish. If you need to do the same, only bake for 35 minutes (which was perfect). I used Red Delicious apples. What I like best about this crisp is that it isn't too sweet, the apples' flavor are not overshadowed either. We had this as our New Year's Eve dessert - served with Blue Bell's 'Anniversary Cake' ice cream- which has an almond-type flavor and tasted amazing with the apples, so maybe even adding a tsp. of almond extract to the crisp would be good. :)

Absolutely sinful!  My husband made this for Christmas dinner and my husband isn't a chef by any means, so this is a perfect recipe for the beginner!  :-)  He followed the reviews and cut the water in half, added nutmeg and doubled the crumb topping.  We will definitely be throwing out our other apple crisp recipe and using this in the future!  Thank you very much!

This makes wonderful apple crisp.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the amount of water.  This reduction left the apples (I used granny smith) rather dry, though.  I will not reduce the water next time I make it.  My only other change was to mix the cut apples into the sugar mixture as I cut them so they wouldn't brown.  Wonderful taste and excellent recipe.

Oh my! This was probably the best apple crisp I've ever had.  I halved it, used Gala apples and sprinkled some nutmeg over the apples. I kept eating small spoonfuls of it, and didn't want any supperl. Thanks for the post.

What w wonderful recipe.  I also cut the water in half and doubled the topping (my favorite part).  I have made this several times and it is always a hit with whoever is lucky enough to be around when I make it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so good! Probably the richest apple crisp I have ever had. I halved the recipe (although I didn't notice that inside the recipe instructions, it calls for a whole cup of flour rather than the re-sized 1/2 cup in the ingredients so it got a little extra of that) and baked in an 8x8 pan.  We cut up as many apples as would fit in the pan; it was about 6, mixed granny smith and golden delicious.  We didn't peel them and it was great, though my husband would've preferred no peels. Based on some of the other reviews and my experience making crumb toppings, I used cold butter, and mixed all of the topping ingredients in my food processor with the mixing blade to cut in the butter. Works great. Only other change I made was to use a little apple juice instead of water. I just eyeballed enough to coat but not drown the apples (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup). Definitely a keeper!

All I can say is WOW! I LOVE this recipe! I am a big apple crisp fan and this has ruined all other competitors. I reduced the sugar content in half for both white and brown, and used Roma apples because of thier sweetness. Also if you use a cheese grater to make thin long slices instead of thick, it carmelizes the apples and sugar...YUM!

Yum! Yum! Yum! This is absolutely the best apple crisp I've ever made.  My family loved it. I used an eight by ten baking dish, 6 large granny apples and apple juice instead of water as suggested in a previous review. I will definitely make this over and over again.

Love this!  I did tinker with it a bit. I used half red and half golden delicious apples. I used twice the amount of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and it was awesome.  I used the amount of water called for, but it was a tad dry so next time I'll increase it to 3/4 cup. For the topping, I doubled it and didn't melt the butter, but cut it in once softened. I sprayed non-stick cooking spray and then put half the crust down. Put the apples down, sprinkled the apple mixture down, water, then the crust. It was great!

I will never look for another Apple Crisp recipe again. This was FANTASTIC! I did follow other reviews and cut back on the sugar, I only used 3/4 cup. I didn't use any water, added 1 tsp of vanilla to the apples as well as the juice of 1/2 of a lemon. I doubled the crisp topping, and had to cook it for about and hour and five minutes. Totally worth it. Super easy to fix, I left the peel on the apples out of laziness....next time I will definitly peel the apples. A wonderful recipe...my hubby was in heaven!

Delicious! I used Granny Smith apples and forgot the water, but it turned out perfect without it. A little on the sweet side, so some may want to use slightly less sugar.

This was good, but very sweet.  Next time maybe try less sugar on the apples and perhaps more topping, but that's probably just a personal preference.

This was really good, but a little too watery.  If I make it again, I am definitely going to only put in half the water called for.  It will probably be 5 stars then.  I also doubled the "crisp" part because I love it!

Scaled the recipe down for 4 people then doubled the topping plus added a hand full of walnuts  Amazing!  It was just as good the next day.

I added less than half of the water called for and it still came out watered down and soupy. It could have been 3 stars but as the recipe is, I can only give 2 stars as I can't imagine why it calls for so much water. Still, even without the water I've had better apple crisp. Edible, but will not make again.

So yummy.  I made the first batch basically according to the recipe.  I added a little bit extra cinnamon over the apples and an extra tablespoon of butter to the topping.  Perfect amount of topping as is.  Served with cinnamon ice cream.  The second batch was for an office potluck brunch.  Added the extra cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and about 1/4 teaspoon cloves.  Everyone raved.

i put 1/2 the crust on bottom of 8" pan and then added apples,topped with remaining crust.~so after i got this into the oven i noticed that i had forgotten to add the sugar to the apples! but it still tasted great!  i had used macitosh apples and they're sweet to begin with-i had also added about a 1/2 cup of chopped fresh cranberries-very good. i served the apple crisp with whip cream and poured a bit of carmel sauce on top. 1/3 cup butter, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, (boiled together) very yummy i will forsure make this again and NOT add the extra sugar!

This was amazing. I followed the recipe but used a smaller pan and fewer apples. Perfect amount of topping with the smaller pan.

Amazing! I cut the recipe in half (only 5 cups of apples - fresh apples, right off the tree!), but left the crust recipe the same. I was only making it for 2! (and we ate it all). Also, I added nutmeg to the sugar mixture. This is my husband's new favorite.

Delicious! Only problem is that this is VERY sweet. I doubled the crisp portion of the recipe, and will do so the next time except for the sugar, (both brown and white) reducing by half should do it.

GREAT!  Here's a serving tip: make your own warm custard to pour over the top before serving. Trust me- it's more delicious than ice cream and friends will be impressed by having their apple crisp with something creative!

Excellent!  I took the advice of one reviewer and doubled the crumb mixture and used half for a bottom crust and half for top. YUM!  It's been a few weeks since I've made this apple crisp and my boyfriend is already asking me when am I going to make it again.

This is the ultimate crisp recipe!! I have  made it for years and everyone loves it. Melting the butter is not necessary. I use a pastry blender to mix it all to large crumbs and that creates a crunchier topping. Its hard to stop eating it!!

This recipe is outstanding... I really loved it! I used Braeburn apples, they are my favorite to bake with because they stay somewhat firm when cooked and give more of a bite instead of a squish that you get with some other apples. THe crumb topping was REALLY, REALLY good, however I agree with some other people who reviewed this recipe. It could use more of it. I think next time I will double the crumb recipe and use some on the bottom and on the top. But, GREAT recipe, and SO easy!!! This will be my top dessert for when I have company!

This was really delicious and a big hit at work. I can't imagine making double the topping, as some people mentioned. The amount listed makes almost too much in my opinion. I did use slightly less water than called for and it turned out great.

This was a huge hit at today's potluck! I may try it again tomorrow since there were NO leftovers from today's batch. I also want to try it with wheat germ in addition to the oats - a little more fiber and a little less guilt, right? Allrecipes.com comes through big for me once again!

Good. Not my absolute favorite, but defintely good. I would recommend like the many others before to only put in 1/4 cup water. Otherwise it is a bit runny.

Awesome. I did omit the water and will try a little less sugar next time.I did a a little nutmeg. I am not a big nutmeg fan and I think it would be good with or without it.I was out of brown suger so I used white in the oatmeal mixture and it was still great. Thanks for the great recipe.

this really wasn't very good.  I should have followed directions and halved the amount of water.  Regardless of that, however, the cooking time is also VERY off, and even though I sliced the apples very thinly, they were tough and rubbery and hard to eat instead of tender like apple crisp should be.

I was the star of the BBQ party with this dessert.  My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made!!!  Only alteration: leave out the 1/2 cup of water.  I ended up tipping the pan to the side and spooning out 1/2 cup of extra juice after it had cooked.  It was still awesome though!

After making this for years now, I have the following tips: You don't need all the white sugar. Halve the sugar in the apple mixture. Best apples are a mix of tart and sweet, such as Spartan  and Granny Smith apples. Using very/all sweet apples will make a difference and you will probably want to reduce the white sugar even more. I have made this with Splenda and it was fine, but IMO Splenda tastes sweeter than real sugar, so I reduced it even more.  When assembling the apple mixture, I don't do as the instructions say: I simply put the chopped apples into the pyrex pan, add the sugar, cinnamon, water, etc., and mix it all up in there. Then I sprinkle the topping. The topping is good as-is but could also reduce the brown sugar there if desired.  Instead of melting the butter, cut it (softened) into the topping mixture. I have made this with additions too (mix with apples) such as walnuts, raisins, and halved blackberries.

Very Yummy! I halved the apples since there's only 2 of us but kept the topping amount the same.  Like other reviewers I only put a fraction of the water in.  I will be making this again and again and again.

Very easy recipe. Will make again but may add a bit more spice to mine just to give it a tad bit more pizazz.

great. it has a beautiful caremel flavour. Probably the best crisp I have ever made. The only change; I used barley flour in place of all purpose flour.

Yum oh! For the apple portion of the recipe I followed the other suggestions and omitted the water. I substituted tapioca pudding for the flour and added the juice of one lemon to give the apples a little zip.  It turned out great!

This is fantastic. Though I did turn it into a pie, instead of a crisp. I cannot have the oats so I eliminated them and the water aswell. I used 4 good size granny smith apples. I mixed the first ingredients in a bowl with average sized apple slices and then poured them into a store bought pie crust. I then mixed the other ingredients in the bowl and it came out very thick, so I just placed it all over the apples and put the pie shell on and baked for 10 mins on 450 and another 40 mins on 350. Topped it with some regular cool whip. Awesome results. Im getting fatter by the minute. :( lol

I thought it was very tasty...Only suggestions, I used unsalted butter and added about a tsp of salt to compensate.  I also think you might want to bake longer than 45 minutes if you want the liquid from the apples to caramelize more.  Otherwise delicious!

It's too sweet, but it's very delicious otherwise.  I put in 2/3 C white sugar, I think you could put in 1/2 C or less.  And maybe add some nutmeg.  And some chopped nuts to the topping if you like nuts

I had never made apple crisp before so didnt have much to compare to.  My husband said it was excellent!  I doubled the topping like other reviews suggested to use half as the crust, I also cut the water in half and it came out a little dry.  Otherwise I do not think it was too sweet.  I used granny smith apples because some reviews said it was too sweet.  I could have over cooked it which is why it came out dry, but a little more water would have been fine!  I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the apples.  Yummy dessert!  We also topped with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious.  This is a wonderful recipe, it even makes its own luscious sauce to drizzle over the crisp or over ice cream.  Will be making this every time I'm craving something apple-y.

Best apple crisp ever! The whole HUGE pan was gone the second nice, only three people in the house

I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking and it make the crust have a nice granola-like feel to it. Very yummy! Added extra cinnimon over the top and served hot with cinnimon ice cream!

This is as good as it gets for a basic apple crisp.  I halfed the recipe and then halfed the water and doubled the topping.  Everyone enjoyed.

This is VERY good apple crisp! Even way slimmed down it still tasted great. I'm getting ready to make another batch (first one was gone in less than 24 hours!! ) and I'm going to use even less of both sugars. Fantastic!

This was so delicious! I will 1/2 the water next time as suggested because I did feel it had a little too much juice. I used McIntosh apples which made it a little sweeter but oh so good! I also cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us and used a 8x8 square pan. The best apple crisp I have ever had! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I used half the water called for, as some people suggested, and doubled the topping mixture. I'd make this again and again.

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and it was great.  I am a "food-fataphobic", so anytime I can made a recipe close to fat free, I do.  In this case, I substituted a bit of butter spray (I can't believe it's not butter pump bottle) by pouring just enough to make the streusel crumbly...although it wasn't as crispy and buttery as the true recipe would have yielded, it was AWESOME...more like a chewy oatmeal broken up cookie sprinkled over the top.

This recipe was easy, moist, and absolutely yummy.  Peeling the apples took the longest; and waiting for it to bake, of course. I used Granny Smith apples because they are on the tart side, and with all the sugar, it doesn't come out too sweet.  I took it to the office for Thanksgiving and it disappeared.  This is definately a keeper in my book.

I like this recipe because you can prepare ahead. I kept the crumble topping seperate until time to bake and it turned out great.

I followed the other reviewers' advice: instead of doubling the crumb topping I cut the apples in half to only 5 cups.  I then put 1/2 the topping on top and 1/2 on bottom. The apple crisp was accidentally was served cold (outside at a church picnic) and the topping on bottom was extremely difficult to scrape off.  Make sure to either spray the pan first or serve it warm. Otherwise, the flavor was very good.

My family loves this and I like that it is big enough to share with a large group of people.  I make sure I use a tart apple and I've never had a complaint that it was too sweet.

It is also awesome warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a drizzle of carmel sauce.

Got rave reviews from the family when I made this!  A tad sweet, so I cut the brown sugar down a bit in the topping.  Made it another time with chopped walnuts - a nice addition.

Scrumplicious recipe!! I baked it at 300°F for 1 hour, so that the apples could gently melt, and as others had suggested, I left out the water and cut down on the sugar. The result : Rave reviews from son and husband (who is always kinda picky about American cuisine). Will definitely be making it again and again from now on. Thanks a lot!!

My first crisp from scratch and it was a hit.  I used Cortland apples as I like cooked apples that retain their shape.

Such an easy and thorougly satisfying recipe, I've made it 4 times in the last month (by popular demand) and every time I love it more. Everyone complains about the sugar but use your discretion based on the apples you have. Its a must make...Enjoy everyone.

This turned out excellent!  After reading the reviews I wasn't sure if I should add the water, if I should  double the topping recipe, etc.
I ended up going with Honeycrisp apples and they were juicy so I didn't add water.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy and I make it in a pinch or when I have lots of left over apples.  This recipe doesn't sound like much, but trust me it's full of flavor and everyone will like it.  I top it with whip cream or use the apple crisp as an ice cream topping.

I hosted a small birthday brunch yesterday and needed to bring in something for "brunch monday" at work.  So I used two 8 x 8 pans instead of the 9 x 13 (used more apples but the split the topping amongst the two pans).  It was a hit at both functions!  I did notice that my "crisp" wasn't crisping as well as I would have liked, so I melted and additional 1 cup butter and poured half over each pan during the last 10 min of baking.... wonderful!!

This was just ok to us.  Made exactly as directed.  Wasn't crazy about the topping.  I think because of the oats.

I forgot to add the water. I think it might be a little runny for my taste with it, so I will continue to make it this way. The topping is expecially tastey.

This recipe was great! I made it with pears, but I should have peeled them. Also, I'm not sure if you need the water unless your fruit is particularly dry - but DO add a pinch of salt to the topping. Otherwise, I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

Loved the crunchy texture on the top on this apple crisp!  I followed this recipe exactly other than adding a lot more apples and a larger size pan than the recipe suggested. I used Jonagold apples for this recipe.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for the recipe~

This is about as good as Apple Crisp gets!  I followed others' advice and used 2/3C white sugar, no water, and chopped the apples. With fall apples (Mutsu - yum!), it was great.

I made this with no water and half the white sugar as others suggested. I found the topping a little on the sweet side, and I prefer a more oat-y, crumbly topping. This satisfied my apple crisp craving for now, but I will try other recipes.

I didn't have 10 apples so I wanted to half the recipe but forgot when I was adding the sugar. So... I added too much sugar but it all still turned out great! I used extra crisp topping too. It was gooey and sugary and so tastey. I am not giving it a five because it was really sweet (my fault). Oh and I used red apples.

This apple crisp was the bomb.  I used several different type of apples and a few pears. This is what was in my house.  The golden delicious and macintosh turned to mush but the pears and granny smith did well. I used 1/4C. of water.And for the topping which was the best part I used 1 1/2 the amount called for. Thanks, I know this will become a favorite in my house.

My first time making apple crisp. Very good and easy. I didnt add water. I let the apples and sugar sit while I finished cooking dinner and by the time I put it in the oven there was already juice in the bottom from the apples. I used a potato peeler to peel and then a apple corer to do the rest.

Well, after all the rave reviews i decided to try this. I followed the advice of others and doubled the topping which I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and used only about 4tbls of water with the apple mixture. I found that doubling the topping was excessive and did not use all the mixture. The final result was just okay. It would not stand out as something to definately try again. Very simple to make though.

i definately think this recipe does not need the water. i used red delicious, gala, and granny smith apples and the mix came out with water remaining in the bottom. it still came out and tasted really good after you dipped it out it just left alot of water in the pan. i know just not to use any water in it next time.

The flavor was very good but the Granny Smith apples came out too soft, almost mushy. I will try leaving out the water next time.

I thought it was great! I made the first time as instructed, but decided to use about half the water the next time because my apples were very juicy. Took it to work and got rave reviews! Thank you!

Delicious!!  I left the water out because the apples were juicy enough - added water would have made it too liquidy.  The rest of the recipe was perfect though!  Thanks!

I used the advice of previous posters and eliminated the water and doubled the topping.  I was glad I did.  The only complaint I had was that the topping didn't get as crunchy as I would have liked.  It tasted great, though.  I wish I would have had some vanilla ice cream to serve with it.

My husband was a little leary when I told him that I was making apple crisp. I decided to fry the apples a little before I cooked them as the recipe called for. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on them while they were cooking a little. I also doubled the topping to make it a little thicker. Then proceeded with the rest of the directions. It turned out GREAT!! My husband absolutely loved it and is now a fan of this apple crisp recipe!  I will definitely make this one again!

When eaten warm, it was a bit mushy, but when it cooled more it was divine, like candy, yummy.  Would definitely make again, but not serve right away.

This was great!  I would make more of the crisp on top.  Peeling the apples takes a long time and is a lot of hard work.

This was really good.  I baked it until the top was crisp.  Some people said it was mush so I baked it longer.  It was very crispy on top.  I think it could use less sugar or next time I would use more of a tart apple.  I used Michigan apples which are sweet and tart.  I would make this again.

This recipe was perfect, except for one thing--I will use less water next time, maybe even 1/4 cup. Instead of melting into a syrup it left a lot of water in the bottom  of the dish when I was done baking it. But it's still very very delicious!

Thanks so much for the recipe!  It's a keeper.  Made it today to take to a potluck tomorrow, which meant I had to make a second one for at home.  It was wonderful still warm with vanilla ice cream.

Based on some of the other reviews, I omitted the water on top of the apples with good results.

Agree with previous review. This was just okay.  It tasted fine, however, it didn't live up to the rave reviews. The texture of the topping wasn't quite right.  It was more like soft granola poured over apples. Maybe adding more butter to the mixture would solve that. There are better apple crisp recipes out there.

We loved this. The only problem is we ate it too quickly! The recommendation to cut down on the water was helpful. Even with only half of the water, it was more than juicy enough.

This smelled fabulous while in the oven.  I used splenda white and brown sugar and it was wonderful.  I used the honeycrisp apples for there great flavor, I think I would have put more apples in there but only had 4.  I also used a square 8 x 8 pan because that was all that was available at the time.  This was wonderful but I felt there could have been more of the delicious apples.  The smaller pan made the topping thicker and I don't think I would double it when making in a smaller pan.

This was also the first apple crisp I have ever made and I was just happy that it turned out so well.

Thanks for a great recipe! This is my first time making apple crisp and will definitly make this again! It was very easy! I doubled the topping but found it to be a bit powdery, so I added a little more butter to keep the consistency. It was fabulous!

I am somewhat suprised at all the high ratings this one got. The topping was very good, but it's a pretty standard recipe. The apples weren't very good though. Adding the water to the apples made it soupy and rinsed away all the apple seasonings. Will try a different recipe or omit water next time.

This was really yummy! I didn't eat it with the ice cream, though. I used green apples, reduced the quantity of sugar and butter. Still, it was wonderful! I also added some cinammon. Thanks for such a s'wonderful recipe!

This was great as I expected it to be.  I scaled it to two servings and baked for 25 minutes in two ramekins.  This was so good I ate both servings for myself :-)

This is one of the best apple crisps ever! I used 1/2 c dark brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar in the topping because that was all I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It came out great, can't wait to try it with different kinds of fruit.

I made this with apples that I had just picked from my dad's apple tree.  I brought it to work with some cool whip and one of my co-workers said it was the best apple crisp she has ever had!  It looked, smelled and tasted delicious!  Great recipe that I will make again and again this fall!

All I can say is FABULOUS!  I made a half batch since it was only me and my daughter.  I served it with Pecan Praline ice cream.  I also added vanilla extract and omitted the water like someone else mentioned.  I am too embarassed to say that we ate the entire dish.

This was a great recipe.  I made a few changes to it, including the following, sugar-1/4 cup, 3/4 cup Splenda.  Also, added rasins and walnuts to taste in the topping as well as doubling up on the recipe for the topping.  Once I had the dish ready to go into the oven I poured sugar-free maple sugar onto the top of dish to make it a little more wet.  I added the full amount of water, and I think the recipe needed it or else it would have been too dry.

The recipe turned out great and we ate it with vanilla bean ice cream.  The recipe makes a pretty big portion, so my boyfriend and I will be eating it for about a week!

WAY too much sugar.  Next time I'll cut the white sugar in half.  Also eliminated the water as others had suggested.  Other than that, good recipe.

This was really good, but way too sweet for us. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. Here we go again...used about 15 apples and doubled the topping(oats with flax and bran), 1/2 the brown sugar and no sugar in the apples. Pecans, chopped into the topping. Delish!

The combination of the tart McIntosh apples and the crunchy sweetness of the topping is wonderful.  It is equally good warm or cold.  This is definitely a keeper!!

Wow, this is awesome!  I used half the amount of apples and made it in an 8x8 pan.  I took the advice of other reviewers and tossed the sliced apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture.  I also used the full amount of topping mixture.  It's incredible and easy!  Try it with caramel ice cream.

This is such a good recipe. It's easy to make and the taste is superb. I liked how the topping was crunchy. It is better than my mother-in-law's recipe! Sorry mom. This recipe is definately a keeper. I scaled this down to a three person serving because this is a big batch.

Loved the topping!  The apples turned out a little too sweet for my taste so will use a little less sugar next time, but otherwise this was a hit with the family.

Excellent recipe.  I followed the advice of others and reduced the amount of sugar. I also sprinkled some lemon juice (1T) on the apples.  I loved the way the melted butter held the crisp topping together in big, crunchy chunks.  Will make again and again!

Delicious. I cut the recipe down a lot so fiddled with proportions a little and I added a little nutmeg.  I used Splenda for the sugar mix and cut back the brown sugar by half. It was sweet but not overpowering.  This is a keeper!

I usually try a receipe the first time exactly as written - then change if needed.  I felt the apples were a little over done and will shorten the bake time in the future.  I spooned the warm crisp into a glass bowl inverting each scoop so that the apples were on top as I layered it. It made a nice presentation with the slightly runny water/sugar combination turning into a wonderful sauce.

I used half of the white sugar granny smith apples and i sprinkled the top with nutmeg and it was good. I will probably use less water becase I cooked it 10 less and the apples were still too soft for my taste. But other then that it was great but not as good as my other apple crisp recipe.

Love this recipe, but needed to modify so it wasn't too sweet.  Used only 1/4 cup of sugar in the filling and didn't add any water.  With the sugar in the topping, it was sweet enough.

Oh my goodness...this is so good. I also doubled the topping and next time will cut down on the sugar a little.  I used Empire apples, which may account for the sweetness.  I also added a handfull of chopped pecans.  I'll be making this again for a luncheon on Thursday.  Thanks!!

I have made this several times now. Each time it disappears quickly. Like someone else suggested, I doubled the topping, since that is the best part. It's definately a recipe that went into my keeper file.

I doubled the recipe for a party and it turned out amazing.  Many people had seconds and others asked to take some home.  I will definately be making this again soon!

I made this for a potluck tonight.  It was a big hit.  The only changes I made were using 3/4 cup sugar with apples, doubling the topping and using cinnamon-plus from Pampered Chef.  It was a huge hit!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have never rated a recipe before, but this one deserves it!  All I have to say is this tastes like soft yummy oatmeal cookies over apple pie!  Definately double the crumble topping, I put it in my new 9X13 stoneware and what a way to break it in!  Awesome!

This was a wonderful treat!  I also didn't use granny smith apples so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 a cup and used only a 1/4 cup of water.  I also doubled the topping and added cinnamon.

This was my first time making apple crisp, and it was excellent!  I followed others' advice and increased the butter, and also increased the amount of topping.  I used apples off my sister-in-law's tree, which I guess weren't at tart as Granny Smith, because it was a tad too sweet, so next time I'd reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.  

I now think my Apple Crisp rivals my mothers!

So easy and delicious that my guests actually asked for a doggie bag!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the crisp and decreased the sugar on the apple filling.  I also never add water to my fruit fillings.  Fantastic.

Pretty good!  I will keep trying new recipes for the sake of finding the absolutely perfect apple crisp.  But this one does taste great.  Next time I'd try slicing the apples thicker since they seem to turn to mush when they're so thin.  I only added 1/4 cup of water to the apples and also added some cinnamon to the topping mixture.  Mine needed to bake for an  hour.

I did the recipe as written but used a 9x13 inch pan and used Macintosh and Cortland apples.  The apples lost their shape, but it was still DELICIOUS.

This apple crisp is the BEST I've ever made.  I threw all my other recipes for Apple Crisp out and replaced them with this one.  This is a keeper that is for sure.  I also doubled the topping.

WE HAVE A FEW APPLE TREES IN OUR BACK YARD AND THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO USE SOME OF THE APPLES. I DID INCREASE THE BUTTER TO 1 CUP AS SUGGESTED AND I USED CINNAMON INSTANT OATMEAL.

Wow! This recipe was unexpectedly good! Like others previously said, I omitted the water, doubled the topping, increased the butter by a 1/2 cup, and it came out perfectly! Our guests loved it and I even gave a copy to my cousin who said she would make it for her friend! The best apple crisp I've had in a long time!

Excellent! Used as many apples as would fit in 9x13" baking dish. Doubled crumble mixture, adding 1 tsp cinnamon and increasing butter to 1 1/2 c so it would turn out crisp, not crunchy. Added 1/2 c chopped walnuts to white sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and increased cinnamon to 2 tsp. Used 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp lemon juice, reducing water to 1/4 c. So good it was bad...we ate it for breakfast :~)

This was good, and so easy! The only thing was that it was WAY too sweet. The apple flavors didn't come through at all. Next time I will decrease the white sugar and omit the water as suggested. It's still a keeper!

We love this recipe!  This is the only apple crisp recipe that I use.  Like the others, I omit the water & peel the apples.  I also double the topping, as it "makes" the recipe!  I don't really measure the cinnamon, however, as we love cinnamon & also add a touch of nutmeg to it.  Gives great flavor!

This apple crisp is absolutely delicious! I ended up having to use more butter than the recipe called for (about double), and next time I will probably skin the apples. I also completely omitted the water like others suggested. But this recipe tasted wonderful! I used all-natural, all organic ingredients, and this recipe was wonderful to boot! Highly recommended! Thanks so much for this simple, tasty recipe. It's great!

This recipe rocks!  I think it's the best apple crisp I've ever had.  I did make 1 1/2 times the amount of crisp to have an extra thick topping and it was delicious!  The crisp is perfectly sweet and crumbly and so easy!  Thanks, I've been looking for a recipe like this!

This was great! I replaced 2 cups of apples with sliced frozen strawberries, used about 3/4 cup of sugar (it was still plenty sweet, I would go to 1/2 cup next time as recommended by others) and 1/3 cup of water.  I made 1.5 times the topping, this was perfect.  With vanilla ice cream on top, it was a hit!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recommendations of others and was very pleased.  I used just 4 Granny Smith Apples (med-large in size) in a 9 inch square pan and kept all the other ingredient quantities the same.  I also omitted the water as recommended, and that worked out great as well. I will definitely be making this again.

It's good, no complaints.  It wasn't really anything special, but it was good.  DO NOT add the water.  There is plennnnnty of liquid without water.

Yum.  It takes awhile to peel and slice all the apples but it's worth it.  I made extra of the oatmeal mix like others suggested and it is a good idea to  not add the water because to the apple portion because it gets runny.  This is very sweet so it tastes best with ice cream.

I used half white sugar, half brown sugar.  I cut the recipe in half and used an 8" square pan, but did not cut the topping in half.  I sprinkled the topping with untoasted almonds before baking.  It was delicious!!

I used 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar.  I also reduced the water by half.  Everyone really enjoyed the apple crisp.  I will make it again.

This was awesome!!!  My mom thought is was from a box!  I did one thing different.  I used 1/2 cup more oats then what it called for. We also put a dollop of cool whip on each of our slices for a wonderful tasty treat. I will keep this recipe for my recipe box!!  Thank you Diane!

After comparing this to some other recipes, I it so much I probably shouldn't review it at all, but anyway, it was delicious! For the apples, I used 8 C of fairly sweet apples, 1/2 C of sugar, a tsp of cinnamon as stated, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 2 T each of cornstarch and water. This created a very yummy, gooey sauce - not watery at all. I added 1 C of pecans to the topping and also cut in 1/4 C of shortening with the butter because it seemed too dry at first. All I know is that it tasted great and lasted less than a day!

Very good.  I used 6 apples and cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and left the water out.  I also used a slightly smaller baking dish.  Probably about 7X11.  I will be making this again and again!

With a couple of minor modifications definately the best Apple Crisp recipes I've used! My suggestions - skip the water, but mix the apples with the dry ingredients and let sit for @ 15 minutes before covering with 1&1/2 times the crumble. Almost better than Grandma's!

Very good, but the topping was lite.
I made this again with 1 and 1/2 the topping and it was MUCH better.

Excellent & easy! Nix the water (not at all necessary). Doubled the topping. Allowed to sit in the oven (off) at the end. Thinking about putting even more of the topping in the processor & forming a bottom crust, too. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream!

Good recipe, thank you.  I made as described only reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup as I anticipated it would be sweet enough without the full cup and was correct.  The only reason I give this one four stars, was after it finished cooking the full 45 minutes and cooled, there was quite a bit of water/liquid still in the bottom.  The flavor was quite nice, but the watery effect underwhelmed me.  I will make this again but perhaps omit the water entirely in light of how much moisture is in the apples.

I didn't have plain quick oats. Instead, I used 3 Quaker Oats apple cinnamon flavored packets.  I think this made the recipe even more delicious!

I made this for my grandpa's birthday, and he loved it! The only thing I did was use about 7=8 green granny smith apples...i also doubled the juice, and then added an additional half recipe to the topping. I'm for sure going to make this again!

A bit too sweet for my liking but I got many complements.  Like others..I thought it had a bit too much liquid in it when all was said and done. The apples for me took a bit longer to cook than the 45 minutes.

This was good, but I substituted cranberry juice (100% juice) instead of the water.  I think I'd add a sweeter apple too...I used granny smith.  The crisp was very crispy, but needed to cook longer than suggested time.

Made this twice. First time, doubled the amount of crisp as many suggested but found I like more apples to crisp. Second time, used delicious apples and splashed them with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, used only 2 tablespoons sugar, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, substituted apple cider for the water and topped it with the crisp from the recipe. Also, prepared it in a deep ceramic cassarol and baked for 1 1/3hrs. Amazing desert and was a big hit with the family!   Thanks and enjoy!

This was absolutely delicious. I just added a bit of nutmeg to the apples and the next time I make it I think I will add some chopped nuts to the topping. I was also thinking of soaking some raisins in rum and adding them to the apples.......YUM

Good crisp, but I think water can be omitted. The hardest part of the work is slicing the apples, but it guarantees you freshness.

I love this recipe.  I omitted the water and cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup as others had mentioned.  It is still juicy and sweet enough.  I used cortland apples.  yum yum

I made this last night - cut half the sugars, omitted the water, per the other posters' advice.  It turned out really good - not as sweet as I would have liked so next time I'm going to keep the sugar measurement for the crisp.  You might want to toss the sugar/cinnamon topping with the apples so all of the slices get coated too.  I'm definitely making this again.

It starts with the aroma of the baking apples, I used Macintosh, Gala, Golden Delicious and Granny Smith sliced thin on a simple Mandoline.  I added the juice of one one small lemon to the apples to prevent browning.  Otherwise this recipe was absolutely perfect.  Mad it in split quanataties in two 9 inch disposable cake pans sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.
VERY YUMMY!

I doubled the cinnamon and the crumble.  I also halved the water.  Next time I will probably add some nutmeg and leave the water out completely.  We loved this apple crisp!

All I can say is WOW.  This was a really great apple crisp and so easy to make.  I made double the topping as many people suggested and added some nutmeg.  I think I'm going to eat some more for breakfast!

Excellent! Used the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping and omitted the water. I also added 1/3 c. dried cranberries, 1 tsp. each of vanilla, lemon juice and apple pie spice (instead of cinnamon) to the apple filling to enhance the flavor. The children loved it, despite the oats!Very easy and a fabulous Fall recipe. Serves a big crowd. THANK YOU for the recipe.

its pretty standard. I would also make more topping as its the best part , it doesnt need the water which pools are the bottom and stays water after its cooked. I used a mixture of fall northen apples since I just went apple picking and cant tell them apart. I added more spice, I used a high quality apple pie spice mixture and I also added ground Ginger to the topping. I thought this was excellent with extra sharp chedder cheese  served on the side~! I would add a bit more butter also overall.

Halved the apples (used 3 granny smith) and sugar, used a bit more flour to coat well, only used a drop or two of water, kept the topping recipe as written (if I was making this for a 9 x 13 I would definitely double the topping recipe), placed all in a 9 x 9 and it was done in about 35 minutes. House smelled great and it tasted even better!

Good, but too sweet.  I would reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 c. and 1/3 c. white sugar instead of 1/2 c.  Double the crumb mixture.

Made this for a family gathering and no one liked it. I followed the directions and doubled the topping as others suggested, I don't know what went wrong - maybe the family does not like apple crisp. PS it taste horrible cold (room temp.)

This is the most delicious apple crisp I have ever had!  The only change I made was   ommiting the water.  The water is not needed.  This apple crisp forms a delicious syrup on the bottom of the pan, which is great to drizzle on the top.  Definetly a keeper! Thanks!

I didn't love this topping. I think a traditional crisp topping would be better. I'll definitely make it again, and do my own topping.

Great recipe, I doubled the topping as advised.  I reduced the water by half, but will omit next time.

I have made this twice and it was a HUGE success.  Probably the best dessert I have ever made.  My boyfriend who only likes chocolate desserts has requested this for his birthday.  The only change I made was to double the topping like some people suggested.  I will make this often!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had many compliments on this apple crisp.  I thought it was a bit sweet but everyone else loved it.  I used mostly Jonathan apples but had a few others I also threw in.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla to the crisp part.I may try 3/4 c. sugar on the apples the next time if I use the same kind.  Was delicious warmed then with vanilla ice cream.

This was awesome! I took the advice of the readers and omitted the water and doubled the crumbs. Took it to work for a treat and it was gone in 10 minutes. Everyone wanted to know who made the apple crisp! Thanks for sharing.

I thought it was good. I served it to some guests and they wanted the recipe.  I am still looking for the perfect crisp!  But this will do until then.... Next time I would reduce the amount of sugar on the apples...

Made this with apples off of our tree, and it was wonderful! Tastes just like apple crisp is supposed to. Perfect with vanilla ice cream, and would also be good with whipped cream. A must try!

The topping turned out dense and thick. I reduced the water and white sugarr and it still seemed to be too much. Sorry, I'll keep looking for a new crisp recipe.

I also doubled the topping and added nutmeg to the recipe.  I thought it was very good over ice cream, however I would have preferred a more crunchy topping.

i was looking for a crumble topping and this was perfect!
I used 1 tin of pineapple instead of the apples and only used the topping to cover the pineapple instead of mixing the pineapple with the other ingredients.
next time i will used 2 cans of pineapple instead or i will half the amount of topping.

Thanx for this great recipe i will definately use it again!

I used to make a recipe similar to this when I was young, before I was married. For more years than I will admit I used my husband's family recipe and missed the oatmeal...not any more. This is perfect, just like I remember Apple Crisp to be.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did cut down on the white sugar to 2/3 cup but felt that the topping ingredients were more than enough for a 13" x 9" pan.  I also omitted the water because I thought it would come out too mushy.  My family could not get enough of this recipe and it also received raves at a dinner party that I gave.

Yummy!  I've made this three times now and it's always a hit.  The only change I make is to use a little more cinnamon in the topping mix and sprinkle 2/3 cup of white sugar over the apples and not 1 cup.

Excellent!  I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8 pan, added a few crushed ginger cookies to crumb topping and cut back on brown sugar a bit.  Have made a couple of times...so good!!

Definitely the best apple crisp I've ever made.  This recipe even inspired my dad to bake.  Although some people commented about too much sugar, I've actually been inclined to add more brown sugar - chalk it up to a super sweet tooth.

Overall, very good.  Got lots of compliments.  I doubled the crisp topping and used apple pie spice as someone else mentioned.  Next time I would halve the amount of sugar that goes ontop of the apples.  Too sweet for my liking.  I used Macintosh apples which tasted great, except too much sugar cut out thier sweet/sour taste.

this was excellent!!!  I used red delicious because that is what I had, cubed the apples instead of sliced and instead of sugar I drizzled maple syrup over the apples.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping....this will be "my" new recipe :)  thanks Diane!!!!

This was very delicious, but no more delicious than most apple crisps that i've had.... Apple crisp is pretty hard to mess up as long as you've got the basics in your recipe.

I absolutely adore this recipe! I picked several bushels of apples this year and we NEVER got sick of eating this crisp! I only used 1/4 of water and 1/4 cup of white sugar. I think the topping amount is perfect, however my hasband has told me he would like it even better if it were doubled. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars, it is wonderful!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This was absolutely deeeeelish!!!  Probably my new favorite recipe off of allrecipes.  I used 6 Granny Smith apples and used only a teensy bit of water.  Served straight out of the oven over french vanilla ice cream is the way to go.

I cut the apple recipe in half, but used the full recipe for the crumble on top. I also cubed the apples instead of slicing them. I think this makes it easier to scoop and eat. Then I baked the whole thing in an 8x8 pan.

Absolutely delicious!  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I used 3 kinds of apples for a bit of variety and it worked well.  Would add more crumble to the top, but that's an easy adjustment.  MMMMmmmm...

YUMMY!!!  I halved the apples and sugar mixture to put in a smaller dish.  I used English cooking apples (Bramley Apples) because of their super tartness and boy am I glad!  I also added nutmeg to the white sugar and cinnamon.  This is the BEST apple crisp/crumble recipe ever.  Thank you so much!

I have made quite a few diffrent apple crisp in the past few years and this one is by far the best. I followed the lead of other reviewers and left out the water and doubled the topping. This recipe rises above the rest in taste and in presentation. It is perfect for any occasion and makes the house smell really good!!!

I had good luck with this recipe. I did eliminate the water (the apples were wet anyway) and I used some lemon juice. We really enjoyed it warm with Ice cream, and I took it to work cold and enjoyed it that way as well. Thanks for sharing!

Too Sweet! I cut back on both sugars and it was still so sweet we could hardly eat it even with icecream, and I'm a certified sweet-aholic.  The topping is especially sweet.  Probably won't make again.

Really great recipe. I only had a few macouns left over, so I used braeburn, not ideal but it was great. I didn't have enough apples to halve the recipe and didn't read it thoroughly, so I threw everything in a bowel, measuring by eye, put it over the apples and it came out wonderful.

Delicious!  This was a recipe I did with my kids (Ages 7,4, and 2), and they did a great job.  It was a nice mix of crisp and sweet.  We used the full amount of apples, and used fresh Mckintosh, that we had picked that day.

This was a really good and easy apple crisp recipe. This was the first time that I ever made apple crisp and the only complaint that I got was not peeling the skin off the apples. I did not know if that was necessary. Serve it with vanilla bean ice cream!

This recipe was awesome. I followed the topping recipe to the letter, but the filling was quite a bit different. I sliced 3 very large ripe white peaches, and mixed them with a jar of Smucker's 100% Fruit Black Raspberry jam instead of sugar, then I added around 1/4 cup lemon juice (until it was tart enough!) Then I added 1 T of flour and stirred it in.... The finished product was so good, I know I'll be using this topping recipe on all kinds of fresh fruit. Thanks Diane!

This recipe is GREAT! It is extremely easy, and it took no time at all to make. It tasted wonderful too! I used a little less apples and a bit more crust. What I like best about this recipe is how easy it can be varied for every person - and it tastes soooo good.
