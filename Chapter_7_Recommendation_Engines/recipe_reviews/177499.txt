This was a very simple and tasty recipe. I did not have brown sugar on hand, so I used 1/3 cup molasses instead. I also added a few seasoning because after the initial taste test it was a bit bland. I added onion powder, salt, pepper, and Italian Seasonings. I also think some fresh garlic would be good added when you are browning the chicken.

Let this recipe serve as a base for a quick American version of sweet & sour chicken. Cut your chicken into chunks and brown in the butter then remove. Now add onion, red bell pepper & canned pineapple chunks. Once everything has started to soften, you can begine making the sauce using 1 can of tomato soup, 1/4 C brown sugar, 1 t soy sauce and 2 T juice from canned pineapple. Add the chicken back to the sauce/veggie mix and simmer for 10-15 on low heat. That my friends is some good eating!!

This was a quick and easy recipe. Tasty on it's own but next time I think I will try some spices to make it really good.
