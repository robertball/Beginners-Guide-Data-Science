You need butter, cinnamon, and sugar also. Plus you can add raisins or cranberries if you want to.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it with margarine and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and it turned out great. It was tastier than the coocnut buns that we buy at the bakery.

Only a light coconut taste, I prefer something stronger, sorry!  I would say these are more like cookies rather than buns.  Still pretty good though!  Just not what I expected...

Good recipe but needs adjustment for GREAT recipe.  First, the combined liquid of 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk and the extracts is way too much.  This results in pancake-like buns.  I used 1 egg, 1/4 cup COCONUT milk and the extracts instead.  Even this adjusted amount may still be too much.  Add just enough of the combined liquid only until mixture comes together to form a biscotti-like dough.  I used 1-1/4 cups of sweetened coconut flakes and 1 cup currants as well.  Drop tablespoons of the dough on parchment-lined cookie sheets (do not compact) and press in 3-5 halved macadamia nuts on top.  Bake as directed until tops are golden brown.  You will not be disappointed!

I just made the recipe, but did use coconut milk and coconut extract in place of the almond.  The flavor is great, but they came out flat as a pancake.  I also put some in a cupcake pan, so now I guess you can call them a muffin in place of bun.  Not sure about the reaction between baking powder & coconut milk -- will try again.  from Foodie

I haven't tried this recipie but I also make coconut buns. When making this recipie people shouldn't be afraid to add extra coconut or dried raisins or cranberrys. I'm sure this is a delicious recipies and perhaps I'll try it soon.

They are delicious. They are a little softer than I'm used too but they taste great. We call this coconut drop where I live.  I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and used 2 cups of shredded coconut which helps enhance  the coconut flavor and thicken the consistency of the batter. I also left out the eggs and used extra milk instead. Hubby an father-in-law approved!
