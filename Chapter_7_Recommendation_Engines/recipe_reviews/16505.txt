Recipe is great if you have a lot of time to spare. My mother taught me to make potatoes fast and they come out just the same. 
1.Poke a bunch of holes on each potatoe with a fork (to make sure they dont explode)
2. Put in microwave for 10 minutes (3-8 potatoes) (7 minutes for 1-2 potatoes)
3. With an oven mit take the potatoes out of the microwave and wrap in tinfoil individually and place in a preheated oven at 375.
4. Bake 20 minutes or until soft and squishey. (You can check the potatoes with an oven mit on to see if they are cooked and squishey enough to eat.
5. Garnish with what ever you like!

Good recipe for beginning cooks. Variations are to wrap potato in foil for a tender jacket, or to rub Pam or Olive Oil on potato jacket and sprinkle seasonings and/or sea salt on the outside for a tasty and tough jacket. You can also bake at 400 degrees for 40 - 60 minutes. Baking time will vary on size and number of potatoes.

Nice recipe when you have 1.5 hrs to bake them. My version is similar, but much quicker and the potato is fluffy and never 'hard'. I cut the ends off the potato and prick with a fork, then I microwave them first, but ONLY until they are tender but still very firm when you insert a sharp knife. Then I bake them about 15-20 mins. at 350* until skins are dry and the potato is very tender. Then the KEY to my famous baked potatoes is this: *After removing from the oven take each one and squish it a bit by lightly squeezing it between a towel because they are so hot! The result is the potato becomes crumbly and fluffy and then lather on the toppings! People LOVE my bakers. Try it! (By the way I normally HATE microwaved potatoes, but by baking these after starting in the microwave they are superb!!).

i disagree with some of the reviews! if someone does not have anyone to teach them how to cook and make a baked potato then this was very helpful! i've never cooked a potato in the oven so i needed to find out myself without asking! and this was great help! so thank you for putting this small & easy recipe on here!

This recipie has times and temperatures and everything. Perfect for those of us unsure how to actually cooked a baked potato. Hint: if you are interested in a crusty peel, put your potato directly in the oven. If you like a softer covering, cover it in foil!

Thank you, I already knew how to make baked potatoes, but I was able to print this out for my husband.  They turned out really good.  The only thing I like to add is if you rub the skins with oil and sprinkle with salt they get crispy like in restuarants.

Your Basic Great Baked Potato!
Before you cook it, roll the wet potato in some salt, pepper, all season, and garlic powder.  This makes the skin taste so so good! Stuff it with some brocolli and corn, I'll never go back to microwaves again. ^-^

The potatoes came out perfect.  I first sprayed the potatoes with PAM and seasoned them with seasoning salt and cajun seasonings then wrapped them in tin foil.  YUM YUM!

I haven't done this in years, as I'm so used to doing them on the grill anymore - my husband really wanted that "old school" way of a baked potato from the oven tonight so I though I'd indulge him. It was soooo good - especially with all the fixen's: butter, salt, pepper, bacon bits, chives, and a little sour cream! Great classic recipe!

okay people..... try 400 for one hour.  pour some kosher salt onto the counter.  put some butter in your hands and fondle your potato.  then pat the salt with your buttery palm and tap onto sticky potato.  wash your hands and set right onto oven rack with tongs and cook for 1 hour.  your skin will be crispy and there is absolutely no reason to wait 1.5 hours for a potato, unless you are cooking something else at 350 for an hour and a half.  good luck!

This is a great way for a potatoe. But... I've been slicing the potatoe [long end to end]. Poking some holes in the potatoe with a sharp knife, then add some salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, and a slab of butter, anything you want. Put the two pieces back together, wrap in foil. No need to poke more holes in it, the potatoe is cut in half. Then cook or grill for your length of time you want.

I followed one review of poking holes in them and microwaving for 15 minutes. Then I brush with olive oil and sea salt and bake them at 375 for about 20 minutes and they are perfect!!  I use Yukon gold potatoes...they are the best!

This came in very handy for my 12 year old daughter.  She's trying to be a little more independent, now she's in charge of the potatoes!  Thanks for making my life easier Faye!

I always insert a metal skewer (or a clean nail) into the middle of the potato and it heats up the potato from the inside as it cooks. This cuts the cooking time down by about 30 percent.

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe.  I couldn't pass this up.  I really got a kick out of the sarcastic reviews...this IS JUST a baked potato...right ;o) I'm commenting on this one because I'm a potato lover.  Any which way you make em I love em.  But for over 35 years now I have aways just put them in a 400 degree oven (without poking holes) for one hour.  Never had one burst on me.  I despise microwave baked potatoes...but I will try the partial time in the micro and remaining time in oven.  If they still come out as fluffy as I'm used to...great...otherwise its worth waiting an hour for them to come out perfect!! Sometimes I wrap them in foil for a soft skin...when I don't wrap them and they come out with a crisp skin...I eat the potato...saving the skin for last.  Then slather a little butter, salt and pepper on the skin...fold it in half or roll it up and eat the skin separate. YUM

Faster and better in my opinion....
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Rub an Idaho potato with olive oil and roll it in  sea salt. 
Place directly on oven rack.
Bake for 45-60 minutes, depending on size.When serving, break the skin/potato open with a fork rather than a knife.
The skin is outrageously delicious and so healthy; lots of vitamins and fiber.

PERFECT. I wrapped mine in foil, placed on a cookie sheet, and timed them for about an hour at 400 degrees. Thanks for the recipe that might sound common sensical, but is perhaps not for those of us who haven't yet made our own baked potatoes yet.

These came out perfect!  My only change was instead of piercing with a fork, I cut the potatoes into long strips and instead of baking them for the whole 1.5 hours, I deep fried them in oil at 375 deg. for 8 minutes.  Yum!!  I did think they needed salt when they came out of the fryer though, which is the only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5.

A baked potato is always better than microwaved! Although I do already know how to bake a potato, I was looking for different ways to spice it up and knew member reviews often offer that assistance here.  Thanks for the seasoning suggestions and the use of Olive Oil to crisp the skin. I always wondered what was used at the restaurants! Based on how few people know how to cook anymore, I think this is a very valid, simple recipe for people who are learning. Please be patient! You may not know the circumstances for their inability to cook and at least they're coming here to try! I was fortunate to have a mom to teach me the basics till I was 15, but after she died, I'm glad to have cooking sites like these to go to for additional help. I quit my career to make sure my kids eat only home-cooked, healthy food. My husband's mom died when he was 16, so we're on our own with no extended family to go to for ideas. Thanks for all of the help and delicious recipes. Your reviews and recipe variations have helped alot and I can honestly say, I am a better cook than my mom was. Thanks!

I like the idea of rolling the "baked" potato in a towel to soften it up.  BUT, we ensure that it comes out fluffy, piece the top of the potato with a fork in a CRISS-CROSS pattern.  Then, squeeze the potato from the BOTTOM, and the insides will fluff OUT of the potato.  PERFECT!

I love this recipe.  I have never made a baked potato in the oven before.  I always used the microwave.  I wanted to be different this time though.  This is just what I was looking for too.  It's annoying when all you find are the fancy recipes.  Thanks for this, it helps a lot.

Makes a perfect skin! I like to do baked potatoes in the winter time, as the oven heats the house. Microwaves are FAST, but oven baked potatoes taste SO much better!  When I need them faster, I kick it up to 400, and it only takes an hour.

I've only been cooking seriously for less than a year, so after deciding I'd like to have baked potatoes on the side, I realized I didn't remember how long to leave them in the oven--or even how hot to set the oven.  Thanks for the basic, but extremely helpful information.  I'm a little too old to be calling mom about this kind of stuff.  Oh, can't wait to try some of the other suggestions--I always wondered why restaurant baked potatoes had more zing.  Now I know!

This is just your basic baked potato. However, if you wish to speed up the baking time, just stick them in the microwave for a bit--and then transfer to the oven. Adjust the bake times accordingly.

I've tried making baked potatoes before but never knew the secret of how to make the skin crispy until I found this recipe.I start with huge Russet potatoes,add oil and sea salt, microwave them for 10 minutes then bake them at 400 degrees for one hour and they turn out perfect.Add sour cream, bacon, green onions, salt and pepper, and shredded cheddar and you've got a meal.

Just made this today, however, I followed one reviewer since I don't have much time. She states to poke a bunch of holes on the potato then I put the potato first in the microwave for 10 minutes then bake for 20 minutes at 375 degrees F.  Thank you Faye!

I bake my potatos in the microwave for about 4 min. for medium spud, turn over half way through.I also put them in a fold top sandwich bag then spray them with some butter flavored spray, then move around in your hands till spud in covered with nice butter flaver. Tender & delicious.I live in Arizona & you don`t want your oven going for an hour and a half at 350 degrees!!!!!!

Excellent, simple recipe; like some, I'll coat with Pam olive or similar, or even rub with olive oil, then sprinkle or roll in various seasonings depending on my mood that night. Finishing it on the grill after baking gives it a smokey taste that makes this recipe hard to beat. Thanks!

I dust the outside of mine in kosher salt, wrap in aluminum foil, and then bake for only an hour. I am glad to see someone had the insight to post this recipe. When I grew up and moved out of my parents' home, I do remember calling home to actually ask how to bake a potato. :) luckily for my family I've come a long way since then.

This recipe seemed intriguing, so I tried it.  Too good to be true!!  I even doubled the recipe(not difficult to do) so my hubby could have some, and it didn't seem to effect the outcome.  The kids were shocked and disgusted, wouldn't try it. We topped ours with butter.  YUM!  Next time I will try serving it with steak and salad.  Eureka!!

you can use almost any temperature and adjust the time.  I bake potatoes nearly any time I bake something other than cookies.  Since I bake my chicken at 400 I often bake the potatoes at 400.  it usually takes about an hour, depending on the size of the 'tater.

I've always done potatoes in the microwave to save time, but this is so much easier that the extra time is MORE than worth it.  Wash them, pucture them, stick 'em in the oven and wait.  Unlike in the microwave, they turned out perfectly done throughout, and I did not find the skin inedible as another reviewer said.

Wow..so simple and delicious! The skin was perfect - slightly crunchy, which is how I like it. I never knew if I should wrap them in foil and/or add olive oil and salt/pepper. Now I know you don't need to.  Just top it with whatever you want.  I used light sour cream and salt/pepper, and it was great.  I love having the oven on in the wintertime. I used to make baked potatoes in the microwave...Now only in the summer...maybe.

Baked potatoes are a good standard and can be dressed up easily.  If you've got lots of time, bake the potatoes low & slow (200 degree oven for 3.5 to 4 hours). Otherwise, bake as above. Wash the potato & dry. Then rub the potato skin with butter & roll in sea salt before wrapping in sprayed tin foil. It's infused with the butter & salt and makes a nice crust.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I wrap mine in foil.  Rub a little butter or margarine on the potato.  Cut it in half and put a big slice of sweet onion in the middle and wrap up in foil.  Even if you don't like onion you can discard and just eat the potato.  We love oninons.  It give the potato a great flavor.  I perfer yukon gold.  But It would work with other potatoes.

Way too long in oven.  Cook in microwave first and then finish in oven?  Or use aluminum foil to finish cooking when it's hot.

Microwaving is faster, but it can't give the potato that crisp, tasty skin.  Make sure you scrub the potato well, rub with olive oil, a little salt and pepper.  There is nutritional value in that skin, and this will make it almost as tasty as the fluffy inside part.

Thank you!    Some people really need to have an idea how to do the basic stuff, not everyone has someone to teach them how. It might seem as easy as the post that compared it to eating an apple said but not everyone knows how to cook everything and needs a little guidance! It would have been nice if the size of the potato was clear, different size=different cooking times.   I will say I do prefer to rub mine with olive oil as my family eats the skins.

Bake large red potatoes.  It's amazing how much more moist and flavorful they are than the white ones.

Perfect Time & Temperature... I  did take the advice of others and seasoned the outside then wrapped them in foil.  Punctured the potatoes and followed the directions as written! Perfect potatoes for the Taco-Topped Potato recipe on this site! Yum!

This is a classic you can not go wrong with this.  My daughter and I love a good baked potato and this is how we do it.  After it is done we usually add a bit of salt/pepper, butter, bacon and green onions. For a nice simple meal add a salad and you are good to go!!

These are true baked potatoes. The phono shows a potato wrapped in foil. That makes it a steamed potato, even though cooked in the oven. A nuked potato is just that. Cooked by microwaves. All three are valid ways to cook potatoes, but each will have a flavor different from the other methods of cooking. If you wrap in foil, remember to increase the baking time.

After 30 years of baking potatoes, the way I love them is to poke a few times and then wrap them in foil with a little butter. Bake at 400-425 for an hour. I love my potatoes a little more "done" they have a different/better taste...like a restaurant baked potato.Great for a weekend dinner, just start the potatoes before the rest of the meal and it isn't so time consuming.

Great way to make if you have a lot of time.  Otherwise I poke holes in the potato and throw in the microwave for about 10 minutes depending on the size of the potato.

If someone who had never baked a potatoe before were to use this recipe there might be some problems.

There are no *guidlines* for the size of potatoe to use. Also, depending on the size, the time and temperature likely would need adjusting.

Also, many restaraunts and businesses wrap the potatoe in foil for cooking and convenience sake.

Using this ?recipe? for a baked potatoe, I found the potatoe to be extremely tough on the outside and not done on the inside.

I think that I would prefer to *wing-it* the next time.

This is not a *recipe* I would use again or recommend.

Thank you so much for these easy instructions! I had no idea how to make baked potatoes before. The only thing I've changed is that I poke the potato about 8 times, coat it with vegetable oil, sprinkle it with salt and then put it in the oven for only an hour. Comes out delicious every time! THANKS!

I tried it but microwaved it for 7 minutes (as was suggested in another review) followed by baking them for 20 minutes while covered in tin foil. They came out tender and were cooked to perfection! My BF thought I added butter because of how soft they were!
Definitely recommended for those short on time

I know it might be basic, but there is always going to be someone who needs basics. Simple, yes. Intuitive, not necessarily. Temp and time are things someone wouldn't necessarily "know" off-hand, especially if this is their first time or they haven't done it in a while. I agree that oil and salt will give you better flavor and crispier skin, which I enjoy! Thanks for keeping it simple!

Great recipe! I baked just as stated. I wet potatoes after stabbing them and then sprinkled with garlic salt, season all and pepper. No foil wrap- just pop in the oven for 1 1/2 hours and they are fabulous!

Used small red potatoes.  Punctured with a knife and put in the microwave for 5 minutes.  Wrapped in aluminum foil to keep hot.  Topped with our favorite toppings of butter, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.

I think potatoes done from start to finish in the oven are much better.  Even starting them for a few minutes in the microwave changes their texture, and the flesh comes out mushy and less fluffy.  Plus the peel almost always comes out soft....myself, I like the crispy peel from a tater that's spent an hour or so in the oven.

Thank you for explaining a classic recipe in a dummy-proof way.  I appreciate that you didn't take any culinary knowledge for granted here.

Like many others, I've learned how to "bake" potatoes in a microwave, but there were issues with that (like how quickly the potato cools down).  This is perfect!  Yes, it takes a little more time, but it gives you time to work on other components to your meal.

It's possibly the simplest recipe on the website, but none of that matters. 

It produces a great tasting potato that can't be matched by microwave cooking. So, great recipe.

Baking time will indeed vary given the type and size of potato used.  I suggest in addition to pricking with a fork or knife before baking, also add a tablespoon of water in with the potato when you wrap it in the foil.  This will keep it from drying out and becoming overly starchy.

I have a different twist on a baked potato.  Try baking it at 500 degrees for about an hour.  Depending on the size of your potato.  My mother always made her potatoes this way, and if you love to eat the skin by it self, you will love it this way.  The skin is cooked to perfection and sturdy enough after you remove the potato, to fill it with butter, sour cream or what ever you fancy.  Try it once, you will be hooked!

My potatoes turned out perfectly.  I took another reviewers advice and rubbed olive oil on them and rolled them in kosher salt before putting them in the oven.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  Thanks for the baked potato recipe!

I really appreciate this type of recipe.  A great guide for when you want to put dinner on the table and just need to know the time and oven temp..  You can customize this as much as you want too!

rubbed my potatoes with vegetble oil and spinkled with sea salt before baking.  My potatoes were large so it took about 1.25 hours.  Perfect with a little salsa and sour cream!

This is the perfect, old fashioned baked potato directions. I always bake my meatloaf at the same time since it takes the same amount of time, at the same temperature. Then all you have to add is a vegtable or salad and you have your whole meal.

Before this recipe, I never knew how to bake a potato in the oven. I always winged it in the microwave. I made 15 baked potatoes in the oven a few days ago, to serve at a party. They were incredibly delicious. Side dishes don't get any easier, healthier or tastier than this.

I thought the directions were difficult to follow.  The potato tasted a little bland or starchy this way.  I only had sea salt, though.  I'm going to stick with boxed potatoes.  Their quicker and bedder.

Thanks for the simple step-by-step approach.  
You can wrap in foil, cover with oil/salt/pepper, as well.    

Use your common sense.  It is implied that the potato is 'medium' size, not tiny or the world's largest.

Nice and easy to follow. If you're making baked potatoes to eat by themselves, do them in the oven always. They taste so much better. Definitely brush with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt. If you need baked potatoes to cook with (for example for twice baked or potato soup) I recommend cooking in the microwave on a paper towel for 3-5 minutes.

I read with much amusement as to mentioning "guidelines" concerning this recipe....I believe the recipe called for one (1) potato!!  Can't imagine how difficult that could have been without "guidelines".....I also read reviews from others and like them, I heartily agree....A great recipe for baked potato, and as some also stated, like me, agree it beats a microwaved potato any day.....good going, Faye for your "A Baked Potato"....thanks

I had never baked a potato before, so I was glad to find directions for doing so. It took just 60 minutes in a toaster oven. I learned this trick on how to split open a baked potato during my days as a waitress: Cut halfway through the middle of the potato, but don't cut near either end. Instead, on each end of the potato scrunch inward with your fingers (wear mits)and voila! Your potato has opened up restaurant style!
 As an alternative to sour cream, try cottage cheese, it's better for you and tastes great.

This is a really good guide!  I took some advise from other users and rubbed oil on the skins and added a little salt.  I wanted the skins nice and crispy, but didn't want the salt all over my oven, so I put a layer of tin foil on the rack and placed them directly on there.

Baked potatoes....yum....!  Microwave cooked potatoes just aren't the same as the ones that take a nice long bake in the oven.  One of my favorite topping combinations is barbecue sauce and sour cream.

I am SO GLAD that you thought of posting this recipe! :()  While I didn't need the recipe (don't even remember when I learned to bake them - been covering the tator with oil (canola, corn, veggie, etc.)) and then with foil.  Thought I would get some ideas from the reviews (so many people to thank and I only read about 1/4 of the reviews!)Never thought to roll the oiled tator in seasonings prior to the foil.  Will try that next time.  A thing that I wanted to share is that when you are baking potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, or things that don't leak too much, when they get alittle soft, you can take them out and let them complete cooking inside an oven mitt (1 per mitt).  This allows opening up oven space to bake anything else.  Never tried with a potato that wasn't foil covered, so do at your own risk in that case.  Thanks again for posting because as a lot of reviewers said, there are some of us who don't have the resources to learn basic techniques like this.

I have been cooking for years (i am 65) but for the life of me, I have never been able to make a decent bake potato. I either burn them or don't cook them long enough. 

This recipe was simple and an eye opener! Thank you!

Really good. I did split the potatoes in half after baking, added butter and cheese, and continued to bake for 5 minutes. Then I added already cooked bacon and served with Ranch. Yummy.

I dipped them in grapeseed oil after washing and sprinkled garlic salt on them.  Delicious!  Next time I'll also sprinkle paprika on them to balance out the salt.

Thank you for posting this basic recipe. I'm roasting a chicken tonight and thought oven baked potatoes would be a good side. However, I was unsure how long to cook them for. This recipe is just what I needed.

I am baking 6 massive potatoes and was worried that they weren't done after 1.5 hours in a 500 degree oven; just wanted assurance that I remembered how.  Thanks for confirming.  To NICKIE75, probably didn't turn out because you didn't use russet potatoes, the BEST kind for baking :o)

I am not given to creating reviews. However, for years I microwaved potatoes for the time saving aspect. One day I put the potatoes in the conventional oven because I had other stuff in there. I had forgotten hot good conventionally baked potatoes are. Went out and bought a cheap toaster oven. I have never microwaved a potato again. If you use medium or even on the small side potato they cook in 45 minutes at a 45 degree oven. I like to rub them in salad dressing first.

Came out beautiful! Mine cooked less, as I have a hot oven. I also added some salt on the skins to give them extra flavor.

After 2 hrs of cooking, they still weren't done. Figured out later that they need to be cooked at 400-425 degrees instead.

Great to have recipes like this for those that have never made a baked potato- there's plenty people out there who have not- It takes a lot of power this way and added heat to your kitchen- My mother would always plan to bake something else at the same time- double duty- I pre-cook slightly in the microwave- remember to punch holes! and finish off in the oven- this takes less power and also tastes great unlike potatoes that are solely cooked in a microwave!!!

Very good and easy.  I needed to do 25 potatoes for a party so I scrubbed 'em, stabbed 'em, brushed them with melted butter, put on some sea salt, and wrapped individually in foil.  Did convection baking at 350 for an hour and a half.  Turned the oven to the "warm" setting and let them sit until the party started.  Turned out great.

I myself have never made a baked potato. Crazy I know. My husband asked for it and I wasn't exactly sure how to do it. Followed this recipe to a T-adding spices before wrapping in aluminum foil. They came out awesome!!! Whole family loved it. We will be doing this recipe again. Thanks again for putting such a simple thing on here for those of us that have never done it before.

This was a pretty good potato - next time, I'd cook it a little bit longer at a less temperature.  The skin was perfect but the closer we got to the inside, it got harder.  Worth another try.

I like to make really big potatoes so I adjust the time in the microwave. But they always turn out great and I recommend them for anyone who wants an easy recipe for making baked potatoes.

I appreciate this very simple recipe for a basic baked potato.  It worked out real well.  I didn't need that much time to bake my potatoes (as they weren't very big).  Topped them off with a bit of butter and a lot of cottage cheese. Yum!

For a TERRIFIC, baked potato with the microwave, scrub potato, break skin with fork, place on PLASTIC wrap, spray with cooking spray all over lightly, wrap well and make air-holes in the plastic wrap.  Cook on high until done...depends on microwave.  I'll never bake them in the oven again.   ALSO, steaming sweet potatoes is a wonderful way to cook them for any recipe from casserole to pies to eating as is!

This recipe helped me so much.  I have tried so many ways to cook a baked potato, but never like this.  I just put foil on the rack and placed the potatoes right on top.  They were perfect, thanks.

I made twice baked potatoes for Memorial Day using this recipe.  I used Navy_Mommy's idea of rolling them in salt and pepper after rubbing them with oil.  I also added a little seasoned salt.  They were Excellent!!  I not only ate the "potato part" I ate the skin as well.  Thank you Faye (and Navy_Mommy)

I only want to comment. I rated 5 because I think it's a great idea to have these kinds of simple instructions for the beginner and then have the seasoned cooks add their techniques. I've been making baked potatoes for years but never thought to add seasonings to the potato skin before baking! I love that idea! Thankss

These potatoes were amazing!!! My whole family ate them all. Next time I have to make more for dinner. We stuffed them full of butter, sour cream, green onions, and cheese and ate them like tacos. So fattening and generally not the way I feed my family, but it was a wonderful treat!!

Very simple, but much tastier than a microwave potato.

I followed the recommendation to put olive oil, and salt on the outside. I think this added a whole new flavor to the potato, and will do this from now on.

My medium russets were done in about 70 mins @ 325.

Potatoes are pretty good. What I did differently was that I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil (because I didn't have vegetable oil) and instead of salt I used seasoned salt. The one thing that I hate about the recipe is the 1 1/2 our wait.

Excellent recipe.

A little mod:
Key are:
Low heat (325) slow cooking.
I use olive oil over the skin (low boiling point and very tasty oil).
Cook 90 minutes, while cooking mix sour cream, bacon bits (real bacon please!), salt/pepper and chopped chive together.
Let that sit.
pull potato out, cut the top of it and gently scoop the meat out of potato, mix meat with your sour cream and back in the potato nice and tight, add cheddar cheese and back in the oven 10 minutes with the 'lid' on the side.
Pull out put the lid on and serve!!!

My mom said that first I clean the potatoes. Then I put some butter on them. Last I poke 'em with a folk then wrap them in sliver wrap and stick them in the oven. Though, I can't really remember :3 

I made this and it turned out okay. I might make it again some day. Thanks for the recipe :oD

This is great. I was kinda surprised to find just a simple baked potato recipe on here.  I ususally make my potatoes in the microwave but I'm having company for supper so I decided to bake them in the oven and I can never remember the right temperature.

I always butter the washed baking potato before baking to get a crisp skin. Then I bake at 450 Degrees F for 50 minutes. For twice-baked, I let them stand after baking about 5 minutes, and holding with a potholder, slice them in half, remove the potato and save the skins. Add butter, half and half, salt and pepper to the potatoes and mash or beat with mixer till fluffy. Add some sour cream for 4 potatoes about a half cup. Put mixture back in the potato skins put shredded or torn pieces of cheddar or swiss cheese on top, then back into the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Really delicious. Done this way, people usually just take a half a potato, so they go farther, and taste better.

Instead of pricking the potato, I slice down the middle the way they're served in restaurants, then wrap in foil. I baked them for 1 & 1/2 hours in a 425 degree oven. they came out creamy and tender!

Good recipe.  Time varies based on potato size of course.  I split mine, added butter, minced garlic, and Kosher salt.  Yummy.  Now to answer the real puzzler.  How come so many of you insist on adding an (e) to the end of 'potato'?  You have one potato, or many potatos.  Don't want a 'toe' in my potato!  =)

Thank you for this 'basic' recipe! Most others don't include how to actually cook it....I agree with a few reviewers to roll the potato in olive oil, then sprinkle with sea salt, garlic powder and pepper...delicious skins!

I found it helps to rotate the potatoes every 30 minutes for an even bake. Also I really scrub the skins and we eat the entire potatoe! Yummy recipe!

Taking it way back! :-) This is the way to make baked potatoes should you not have a microwave or toaster oven. I would recommend rubbing your potato down w/ butter or olive oil, minced garlic and salt and pepper and maybe even leaving them in the a bit longer than 1.5 hours. Okay recipe, but you got to have nothing but time on your hands and a non-hungry disposition.

I must add my 2 cents worth.  I also microwave my potato for 10 to 12 mins. While it is baking I have a pot of water boiling in which I place the baked potato in for another 5 to 10 mins.  Fluffy and it taste like a baked potato.

I usually microwave, but when they's time I use the oven and they're always better.

I enjoyed reading some of the reviews of those who suggested using the microwave first and then the oven to cook the potato the rest of the way. I grew up with mom baking potatoes in the oven.  However, when the microwave came into my house, I stopped using the oven.  When I'm using the oven for a dish for an hour or more I wrap my potatoes in foil and put along the sides of the dish.  Baked potatoes are a quick and easy meal loaded with bacon bits, cheese, broccoli, sour cream or butter.

I have been trying to figure out the baked potato for some time, never getting it quite right. I made these last night and they were PERFECT! Thanks

I was taught to put foil on the potato and then bake. I think this is a better way to bake a potato.

My parents brought round a huge bag of potatoes, so decided to bake one for supper. Followed the instructions and the potato was perfect. I rubbed the skin with salt and garlic granules before I put it in the oven and that was the finishing touch.

Great basic potato!  I sprayed with Pam and sprinkled seasoning salt on them, but didn't wrap in foil.

I baked the potatoes for a potato soup recipe and they came out very fluffy.  The skins came out sort of tough so if you like to eat the skins I would recommend a different method.
