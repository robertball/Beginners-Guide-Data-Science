made this tonight, but tweaked it a bit to my situation.  We beef our own cows, so used tenderloin steak as well as sirloin steak in place of flank. Also added a can of Campbell's Creamy mushroom with roasted garlic to the simmering liquids.  Simmered for about 90 min, added the sour cream (with chives) and it was a winner.  Simple...

This was really good, and it kept really well. I did add onion to the bell pepper and the beef when it was browning, because I like onion. Next time, I'll only use one bell pepper because I'm not a big fan of cooked bell pepper.

I tried to make this but our power went out when I was 30 minutes into boiling the meat!  I put it in the fridge and came back to it the next night and boiled it some more.

It is easy and good if you don't like the mushroom version.  I only gave it 4 stars out of the fairness that I was unable to make it as the directions said due to the power issues.. 

I couldn't for the life of me find the right kind of steak so I used sirloin.

Like I said, this is a VERY easy recipe to follow and I liked it!

This is an AWESOME recipe!!! I was looking for the easiest beef stroganoff I could find and this was great! The only thing I do differently is add a little seasoning to the meat as I am browning it and also some chopped fresh garlic. My family loves this meal and begs for me to make it. Thank you!

This was a delicious recipe, for the meat I used leftover flank steak from rouladen and added an onion and some cream of mushroom soup as another reviewer suggested - very nice, we thoroughly enjoyed it!
