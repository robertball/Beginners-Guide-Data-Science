It isn't Christmas at our house without this cranberry pudding.  We make it in the crock pot using the cake pan.  Very easy and always a hit.  My daughters now make it for their in-laws.  When we are in Africa, cranberries aren't available so we us plums.

I ship this frozen to all my relatives - they insist on it.  It can thaw and be refrozen with no adverse affects.  It is fat free before sauced!  I steam and ship the pudding in fancy christmas tins!  Perfect for gift giving

This recipe is an old family favorite for generations.  You can make it in a cake pan and then cut into small squares.  If you split the square in the middle 2 pieces it absorbs more sauce and turns into something quite spectacular!

I followed a reviewers advice and put the pudding in a 9x13 pan, increasing the ingredients 1 1/2 times so it would fit the pan better. I covered it with foil and baked it in another (little bigger) pan of water at 325. I think it turned out the way it was supposed to, the berries popped and it was not sour. My problem was with the sauce, it was gritty from the sugar. I am going to try it again since the flavor was good.

This is the exact recipe my mother-in-law gave me 36 years ago.  She had prepared it for her family every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I have made this recipe over seventy times myself!  I cut the berries in half if they are large and I steam the pudding in a decorative German steamer (the ones that look like little bundt pans with lids).  I also make the sauce in a double boiler.  Pudding and sauce reheat well (separately) on lower power (70%) in the microwave oven.

This is a delicious pudding cake. My recipe calls for an additional 1/2 cup light karo syrup and no salt at all. But other than that it is the same recipe. Don't hesitate to try it. It's really quite delicious!

Excellent. We used to buy cranberry puddings from Cranberry Creek, but they're very expensive, particularly when including shipping costs! Finding a recipe that actually tops the pudding we fell in love with was amazing! No changes necessary. Make sure to serve with the butter cream sauce!

I tasted this dessert and it was delicious.  Now, I did follow this recipe and it turned out weird.  It`s like there was not enough liquid in it and not enough baking soda.  It turned out like a ball of playdough, tough and rubbery.

A word on the sauce: it's technically fudge, and if you treat it like fudge it will be easier to know when it will have the consistency you're looking for, as it thickens a lot as it cools. I keep my fudge at a boil for four minutes or so, and when I boiled the sauce for two minutes it came out just right for me. I think half as much of it would be plenty, though; we didn't even use that much.

This recipe has been in my step-mother's family for about 4 generations so I'm thinking it's pretty old.  I've made it every year for the past 10 years and my dad and stepmom love it, and so do I.  A few things though.  this recipe is very temperamental and must be babied. You must steam it for exactly 1 1/2 hours. I use a LARGE stock pot, put a little water in the bottom along with a small cup saucer so the pudding doesn't burn.  Bring the water to a boil, place the ingredients in a small round casserole dish, put the dish on the saucer in the stock pot of boiling water, simmer with pot covered for exactly 1 1/2 hours for best results. DO NOT PEEK AT DISH WHILE IT'S STEAMING. You'll lose your steam.  You can substitute canned cranberries for fresh, but fresh is best. But canned makes a more moist pudding.  You can also use 1 cup of brown sugar instead of sugar to make a caramel sauce and Half and Half cream for a less sweet sauce.  I once accidently  used whipping cream instead of the usually half and half cream and found this makes the best sauce.  yummy, yummy, yummy!!

I made this for the first time today and it turned out great!  Perfect consistency.  I cut all the berries in half before adding to the flour to prevent the problem of them not bursting.  I love the little pockets of tartness among the sticky molasses flavored cake.  This one is a keeper for sure!  Thanks for sharing Jerri!

Like another reviewer, I used my steamer and perhaps that's why it didn't turn out.  I didn't bother to make the sauce but maybe that sweetness would have helped because the pudding itself was tart and had a weird taste.

OK, I love steamed pudding and I love cranberries...why did this turn out so weird?  Granted, I did use my steamer instead of a saucepan, but I have made many breads and puddings in my steamer.  The pudding texture was great, but very weird tasting and the cranberries were soooooo sour.  I expected them to pop while cooking; they did not.  I did not want to add all that fat with the sauce.

This is wonderful, I have made five so far for Christmas gifts for family and friends.
Anything I can make with cranberries is my favourite.
Has anyone used Splenda in the sauce instead of the 1 cup of white sugar? It is a bit too sweet for me and also I try to avoid white sugar.

This is so easy and so good.  It is the perfect dessert for those who don't like desserts too sweet.  I will make this every holiday.

I ended up making this with cranberries that I had soaked in rum brandy for 2 weeks to make cranberry liqueur, and it turned out really well in the end. I loved it, and my dessert queen friend loved it so that was good enough for me...my future Christmas pudding mix!!!

This didn’t turn out good, I followed the instructions and ingredients to a tee. It tasted like molasses and cranberry, seemed like it was missing something, and definitely too much molasses. Won’t be making this again

This is a childhood memory!!  The only thing we did different is we used 1/4 of white corn syrup instead of the sugar and the hard sauce had a small pkg of cream cheese added to it.  The cream cheese is the kick.

I loved it! I served it with vanilla ice cream--by the time Christmas dinner was over, I was done cooking--and the ice cream provided the right sweet to balance out the pudding's tart. I sliced the berries on the recommendation of one reviewer of either this recipe or another one, and I don't know that it was necessary. Who cares if they pop on their own? I'm definitely putting this recipe in the holiday lineup. Maybe next year I'll even get around to the sauce!

You better like molasses and its smell. There are so many excellent cranberry pudding recipes that put this one to shame. I served this to my guests and they all enjoyed it but it has an unpleasant odor and it isn't great. I added orange courvoisier to the sauce to punch it up. Without the added liquor I don't think anyone would have enjoyed this very plain not so pleasant tasting dessert.

I was looking for a cranberry pudding recipe to mimic the one my grandma made every christmas. This came very close in flavor and texture. (My Grandma's always came out very dark in color..  maybe blackstrap would of made it darker?) . I topped mine with a brandied whipped cream instead of the sauce listed here.   Thanks.

This is the same as my Grandmother's recipe and I have been having it for every Thanksgiving and Christmas for my whole life...I am 51 years old. It is a must have! I always make 2 or 3 puddings and freeze them so there is plently to last through the season. If you haven't had before you should try it. It's easy to make. The sauce is important too, be generous. It makes a wonderful gift as well.
