This is alright, but not great. The recipe should specify RICE vinegar as white vinegar is to pungent. There should also be some honey as is traditionally use in Korea. The sesame seeds don't need to be fried, just toast them in a dry pan. Replace the vegetable oil with dark sesame oil and add directly to the sauce mixture.

This is excellent. The second time I made it I used sesame oil instead of vegetable, Rice vinegar and added some Gari (pickled ginger) Brought it to work and everyone raved!

This was a nice, refreshing and easy "banchan" (korean sidedish). I often make it without the carrots, but increase the green onion. I like it with a little bit of sugar added, but it's nice as is.

This was really yummy.  We made it a whole meal by pairing it with two other recipes from this site, Korean BBQ Beef and Korean squash as well as some jasmine rice.  I added about 1tsp of sugar and next time I won't use quite as much red pepper flakes...Rachel

I really liked this dish.  I used carrot sticks in mine and marinated mine for several hours before serving.  I will have to cut down on the red pepper flakes next time, because it was a tad bit too spicy for me, but I will be making this again.  Oh, and I got ahead of myself and didn't saute the sesame seeds (just threw all the ingredients in a container)  oops.  But it still came out good. It was the perfect compliment to rice and beef bulgogi, also from this site.  Thanks!

I can't speak to the authenticity of this recipe, having never experienced the real thing before, but I know what I like, and the dressing for this salad was far too astringent. I would increase the oil and choose sesame over vegetable, use rice vinegar, and add a teaspoon or two of sugar. Otherwise, the dressing is extremely unbalanced, resulting in something tart and sour.

This was great. I used rice vinegar, sesame oil, and garlic chili sauce instead of white vinegar, vegetable oil and red pepper flakes. It turned out perfect!

I really liked this recipe - cukes, carrots with a twist. I added a little zucchini and red pepper since they were left over in the fridge. I served it with BBQ chicken and thought it was a nice, refreshing yet spicy side.

These were good.  I am a wimp when it comes to hot stuff but I was able to handle the red pepper.  It was offset by the vinegar and it went well with the Korean Squash and the Korean Beef recipes from this site.

I used rice wine vinegar and a 1/2 t sugar to make a sweet and hot dish that got rave reviews.  I also marinated it for several hours. The white vinegar was too acidic.

We liked the tangy taste of this salad, but I do think it needs a bit of sugar added to even it out.  It was better the next day, so next time, I will make it in advance.  We had little ones joining us for dinner, so I left out the red pepper flakes, but have no doubt that they would add really nice heat to this salad, which I think it needs.  Will use them for sure next time.  I toasted my sesame seeds in the oven (a single layer on a 9" cake pan @ 375 for about 5-7 minutes) to skip the oil and that worked out great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Nice! I really like the heat of this. I used rice vinegar instead of white because it made sense to me. Otherwise made as written and we all really enjoyed it. Thanks!

I added more hot pepper flakes.  This went very well with the "Firey Pork Skewers" recipe I found on this site.  I made sure it was served icy cold, for contrast.

Great recipe to start from but I thought it was too vinegary - I toned down the vinegar by a little bit, added brown sugar and sesame oil and it was a great side dish to the Korean BBQ marinade chicken and the Bulgogi from this site.  Yum!

It was good, but I felt that there was far to much white vinegar. I did add some sugar, but I don't think that was what was needed, next time I'll try some of the other suggestions. I did not find it to be bland, the Korean's are great at making foods taste like themselves but with spunk. The cucumber was awesome!

very nice counterpoint to a richer asian meal.  i used half white vinegar, half rice vinegar.  the white vin. gave it the zing and the rice vin. gave it the right flavor profile.  used a dash of sesame oil instead of veg. oil.  tasty

I would have rated this with more stars except I think that this recipe would be 5 stars if one were to use rice wine vinegar rather than just plain white...that's the only thing I would change.

Thanks for all the tips - I made this using seasoned rice vinegar. Because I like things spicy I toasted the sesame seeds with chili oil and didn't need any red pepper flakes.  Wow it sure had a kick - but sooo good!!

Made exactly per recipe. Good but....needed salt. I was surprised by how spicy (hot) this was. I eat a lot of Indian, hot curry, so wasn't too spicy for me, but if you don't like hot, might want to cut back on red pepper.

This was just ok. I did use rice vinegar versus white and I am sure that helped a tad. It really needed sesame oil (which I didn't think about until after the fact) I also wasn't too keen on the Red Pepper Flakes being in this recipe. A chili oil would probably have suited this a bit better. I will say that after trying I did add a dash of salt and that helped the flavor a bit. I do feel it is a good 'starting point' to put my own spin on things but that's not how we rate the recipes here....

Seemed like it was missing something. I tried a bit of sugar, not quite but better. Tried ground peanuts, still not it. I'm looking for something more in the dressing but I dont know what it is.

I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and added a bit of sugar to balance out the acidity.  Very refreshing side dish. I served it with pork pot stickers and Thai Cocunut Soup (from this site) for our Anniversary dinner.  Yum!

It was not Asian enough for me so I substituted toasted sesame oil for the oil and seasoned rice vinegar for the vinegar.  I also toasted the sesame seeds in a hot skillet...........

This was ok, but I felt that something was missing, but not sure what. If I try this again, I would probably go with the rice vinegar as others suggested, and maybe some sesame oil or sugar or something. We ate it, it just wasn't our favorite, but thanks for sharing!

I will make this again using less vinegar, and probally use the rice wine vinegar instead. The vinegar was way too strong, but still worth attempting again. =)

We ate this, but the vinegar was pretty strong. I guess that's the way it's supposed to be. We served this with bulgogi and kimchee.

I made it exactly as written except I browned the sesame seeds in half sesame oil and half olive oil.  Once it was all put together, I tasted the result and the flavor of vinegar was overpowering. I added more olive oil and sesame oil to the mix and I added half a red bell pepper for color.  Can't say I'll make this again, but that doesn't mean others shouldn't give it a try.

Pretty good, but the kids couldn't handle the heat. I had to substitute red onions for green onions, only because my green onions had wilted. I will make it again with green onion.

Pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe except I used thai bird peppers.  Spicy, but good if you have  something bland like rice or noodles to eat with it.

This is an awesome salad. My husband and I made this last night and we just loved it. We ate it with Korean BBQ Beef from this site, like suggested. The only change that we made was we added more pepper's.... yum .... Thanks

Make this all the time and I’ve always love this Korean dish.
It’s even good on  hardroll sandwiches. My mom always had this at the table, and we’re Pueerto Rican. 
Filipinos and Japanese people love this too.

This is a light and refreshing salad that is a must to complement the Chef John Korean Fried Chicken and Korean Fried Chicken Sauce recipes on this site!! Recommend letting the cucumbers marinate in the vinegary dressing for about an hour. I did make a few more changes to suit my and my family's tastes: reduced amt of white vinegar and topped up with seasoned rice wine vinegar; added a splash of sesame oil; and 3/4 tsp of sugar. We all just loved this crunchy, cooling cucumber treat. Yummy!!

This is a very light salad, great for those hot summer days. I made it almost as written. I used rice vinegar, three medium cucumbers and omitted the use of oil. It was great with the Bulgogi and rice.

Holy Cow!!!!  This is now my favorite cucumber salad. So light and refreshing.  A few tweaks:
1)used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. 
2)used pre-toasted sesame seeds, eliminating the oil.
3)used freshly ground black pepper
4)used a long English cucumber
Definitely allow time for the flavors to come together before serving.  I set it aside for an hour and it was sooooo good!  
I went back into the kitchen and made a double recipe of just the dressing. I only put 1 T of sesame seeds since I don't know how much vinegar they may absorb.  Keeping it in the fridge, so it is ready to go for the next few days.  Keeping presliced veggies on standby.  Gonna put it all together for lunch at work and share with coworkers. Yummy, can't wait to enjoy it again.

This was good. I doubled the recipe and added some salt. (Doubling the recipe, I used 1/4 tsp.) I omitted the green onion in favor of dehydrated onion (was out of scallions). A bit of sugar would have brought these flavors together nicely, I think, and I would add that in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

This was just okay. The vinegar was overwhelming and overall, it was lacking in flavor. I tried doctoring it up with some sugar and a little salt. It helped a bit. As others have suggested, I would use rice wine vinegar.

I've given the recipe 5 stars based on a few changes I made.  The changes were made only because I was missing ingredients.  I used ground red pepper (a few shakes, taste, and then a little more), extra pepper because I like it, a little extra sugar because I like that too, no carrots because I didn't have enough and skipped the sesame seeds so  justed added in sesame oil instead.  I love cucumber salads and I'll be making this one again.

I use rice vinegar, 1 tsp of white sugar, a few splashes of sesame oil, red pepper flakes, sliced white onion and a little pepper.  I skip the sesame seeds - they're too much trouble to toast and I find it a weird texture when mixed into the liquid.  Might be better if they were just sprinkled on top when serving.

It was okay, but it wasn't like any of the cucumber salads I ate while living in Korea.

I followed this recipe to the letter and we thought it was the perfect side dish for the beef bulgogi.  I wouldn't change a thing, and our dinner guest also thoroughly enjoyed it and even went back for seconds.  Terrific summertime crispy veggie salad and the spice is just right!

This salad was good but I had to add a little bit of honey for a hint of sweetness.

Smells wonderful and tastes great! I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I ended up tweaking it a little. The sesame seeds and red pepper flakes were so overpowering I ended up adding another cucumber and carrot to balance out the flavor. Next time I make it I will only use 1 tbs sesame seeds and 1/4 tsp or less of the red pepper flakes. Other than that it goes great as a side to any Korean BBQ dish and compliments kimchi wonderfully!

Pretty good! I used a little less than the recommended sugar, added romaine lettuce to fill it out, and sirrachi hot sauce for color.

I thought this was pretty tasty.  Only problem was too much on the vinegar side for me.  I added 2-3 packets of Splenda and this helped balance out the overwhelming vinegar.  Also I sub'd black sesame seeds, which were lovely.  The red pepper was great-- nice kick.

Like others I used rice wine vinegar a sesame oil and I used Korean chili peppers. I also used organic Persian cucumber instead. I didn’t have carrots or green onions in stock but it turned out great!  Not as good as my Korean moms recipe but Thanks for the recipe!

I think I did not add enough cucumber and added too much chilli flakes. It was really spicy for a salad and too vinegary.

EASY VERY FRESH. I liked the rice wine , sesame oil, touch of sugar  combo.  I felt even with a few red pepper flakes it was a little bland. I served to kids who like cucumber but not onion. I put a few tomato wedges around edge of dish.
Next time I will add a bit of onion and maybe red pepper just to pick it up a bit.  Very nice.

It's a good start, but it needs sugar (1tsp at least; white or honey), less red pepper, and rice vintages (not white). [these are great tips that I gathered and tried from other reviews and they balance the multiple flavors]

just not enough flavor to go along with the heat. I think it needs a good amount of rice vinegar to get something going on your taste buds. Would not make this again.

Following suggestions, I subbed rice wine vinegar (1/8c), added 1t sugar, & less red pepper (1/4t).  I marinated a few hours.  It's not so Asian flavored, which was the attraction to making this.  Using less & rice wine vinegar instead, it wasn't so vinegar-y either.  No points off for that.  ;)  It didn't seem much different than an American cucumber dish.  For sure, sub sesame oil for the oil - if you try it.

I used sesame oil instead of seed, and reduce the EVOO, just a splash of EVOO. I used RICE VINEGAR instead of what she wrote. I added a slash of simple syrup or honey... So yummy!

Other than being much hotter than we expected, this had a wonderful flavor. Based on other reviews, I had used a generous 1/4t.- scant 1/2t., but next time will use a scant 1/4 t.  We like spicy, and maybe it is a factor of not having had a lot of experience with Korean food, but we had this with the bulgogi from this site, and I think we were expecting the meat to be spicier and the cucumber more cooling!  Will add the excess red pepper flakes from this salad to the meat next time!

I make a lot of Korean foods since I am Korean and this dish not only tastes authentic, but its very healthy!  I used sesame oil instead of veggie oil and added a bit of sugar. The longer it marinates in the refrigerator, the better it tastes! Great recipe! :)

I liked it, but I thought it was missing something.  I liked it because it was rather easy to make.

Awesome salad!  Very refreshing on a hot day.  I used small zucchini since my husband doesn't groove on cukes, and I toasted my seeds in a dry pan rather than use oil, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  This is going to be one of my go-to recipes at the height of zucchini season when I'm tearing my hair out trying to figure out what to do with the little buggers!

Very good!  Subbed sesame oil for vegetable oil and used a whole carrot and whole green onion.  Ate the whole batch myself!  Will definitely make again and next time I'll share it!

This stuff was great. Only things I did different were: used rice vinegar instead of white, added a pinch of sugar, and halved the red pepper flakes. My boyfriend and I agreed this was the best we have ever had!

This was okay. It had heat, which I like, but I didn't think that it had much flavor.

great recipe! though the proportion of the crushed pepper was too much for me, considering that there already was some ground pepper in it.

TOO MUCH RED PEPPER.  Aside from that, the recipe is tasty and simple.  Next time, I'll cut back on the red pepper...since I probably will make it again...but maybe increasing the black pepper.

This Recipe is great over white Rice and topped with a bit of soy sauce! A friend of mine made this back in 1993 and shared with me. I crave it every other month... I lost it but now it's found!

spicy and delicious. If you have someone who doesn't like spicy food, cut back on the red pepper flakes, they pack quite a punch.

I really liked this salad!  Out of respect for my 4-year-old, I cut the red pepper to 1/4 tsp. and thought there was plenty of heat.  Next time, I will try using rice vinegar and scale back the black pepper just a bit.  Overall, a refreshing addition to my veggie rotation.

This recipe is great with bbq food, very crisp and refreshing with a little zing, plus very little fat added.  We had this side dish with the grilled peanut chicken (from this site)and the two went well together.  I did not make any changes to this recipe at all.  Thanks for the refreshing recipe!

For something so basic it was pretty good! It's a great way to get me to eat my veggies and I ate it with the Korean BBQ recipe (Pul-Go-Gi)on this site. What a great combo!

Hubby didn't like it. Five year old ate one. I thought it was OK. I don't remeber this dish when I was in Korea, but i like the raw fresh veggie idea. Thanks anyway.

My husband, my Korean exchange student, and I all thought this was disgusting. She said she had never eaten it before, and It tasted like bitter spicy vinegar.
