Tastes just like the out of box bread machine products.  I used all-purpose flour instead, and this bread still came out great.  Nothing like adding butter to fresh homemade bread. yumm!

This recipe is great!!! I made it again last night using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added oragano, parsley flakes, onion powder, garlic powder and some Italian seasoning and it was delicious!!! Hubby was dissapointed when I said he couldn't eat the whole loaf!!!

I used 1.5 tsp of yeast instead and it turned out great. I've tried using the recipe's 2.25 tsp of yeast with 3 cups of butter before and my bread always falls, so perhaps my breadmaker differs from everyone elses.

I removed 3 tablespoons of flour and added in 3 tablespoons of gluten. The bread turned out soft and spongy and so delicious! It's similar to the soft breads baked in Taiwanese and Chinese bakeries.

Fantastic in or out of the bread machine. I have made it by hand, and the only change was I used unbleached all purpose instead of bread flour so hand kneading would be sufficient. Also, for sandwich loaf consistency wheat bread, I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour for the white.

This is the first review I've posted on allrecipes, although I use this site almost every single day. I do not buy bread from the store and this basic recipe is the one I use the most. More often than not I set my bread machine on the dough cycle, pull out the dough when finished (first rise) and form into 8 sandwich/burger rolls or (occasionally) 12 hot dog buns. They go into the oven which was heated to 200 degrees F and then turned off. I let them sit/rise  for an hour then bake at 350 degrees for about 18 mins. Perfect buns every time. When I do bake a loaf in the bread machine, it also comes out perfect! Oh yes, I also substitute 2/3 (2 cups) of the white flour for whole wheat flour. My husband loves that I literally save dollars per batch of bread, plus fresh hot bread cannot be beat!

I've made this bread four times now, and I think this recipe is perfect just the way it is, although substituting olive oil can give you a slightly different texture. It does well on it own or with add-ins (I love rosemary, garlic and basil). Excellent!

This is a really easy to remember recipe that even my daughter can put together fast. We keep a copy of it, in our favorites recipe box , to give out, for  when friends ask  "how hard it was to make" . It is great to put together a few hours before company comes so Warm or HOT Bread can be served durring the dinner, and it was No Fuss at all !

I wouldn't change anything on this recipe. The bread was wonderful and tasty. My only recommendation for those that use the bread maker is to check your dough within the first 5 minutes of mixing. If your dough has the right consistency, it will be wonderful bread. Remember to let the ingredients mix well and add flour or water 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough is moist or dry. Sometimes the way that we measure the flour affects this. Remember that the perfect dough mixes into a nicely even rounded ball that doesn't stick to the sides of the mixing container.

I've made this recipe three times already and absolutely LOVE it!  I make it as is, and it comes out great every time.  There are only two people in my household, so I've had problems in the past with stale loafs of bread.  To avoid this, I slice this bread up once it has completely cooled, pop the sliced loaf into a Ziploc bag, squeeze all the air out, then store the loaf in my freezer.  When I'm ready to eat the bread, I take a slice or two from my freezer and microwave the bread for 20-30 seconds.  Voila!  I have fresh, not-stale bread.  I've been able to make my loaves last up to 10 days this way.

I just got a bread maker & this was the first recipe I tried. I've tried to make bread by hand & it turns out terrible. This was pretty good. I used AP flour & cut down on the yeast a wee bit but I still found it smelled yeasty, is this normal for homemade breads? And it seemed a bit dense?

I won't buy store bought bread again. This recipe is perfect! I tried it on the dough cycle and baked in oven @375 degrees for 25 min, and it came out perfect. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Delicious.  If you're like me and you like to let the bread machine do the muscle work, but then bake the loaf in the oven and take all the credit, then I highly recommend this recipe.  This yielded a soft, fluffy, loaf that's ideal in texture on it's own, perfect for sandwiches, and makes a mean slice of thick chewy buttered toast.  Soft, with just enough density.  Set bread machine for the dough cycle, remove when finished and punch down on a lightly floured surface to remove large gas pockets, let rest for a few minutes.  Take your ball of dough, stretch outer surface around while elongating, shaping dough to fit a greased 9x5 loaf pan. Loosely cover with plastic wrap (sprayed with non-stick spray). Create a perfect warm, moist rising environment in your microwave by boiling 1 cup water in it (about 2 mins), remove water and place covered loaf inside for a second rise (about 30 minutes or so).  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes or until dark golden brown on top.  I've tried several white bread recipes on this site, and this is by far the best for this method.  Yummy!

I made this bread last night, first time making bread in our bread machine, and the loaf turned out half the size and the crust is so hard I barely cut through it. Any help or reason you could give would be great! Thanks :)

This bread was wonderful! Light and airy and delicious after only 5 minutes of cooling time. We ate it along side a stew, but I didn't find it to be too sweet or too salty. My guests all went back for more!  I used my machine's 1 pound setting with a light white because it matched the 3 hour cook time stated in the recipe.  The only substitution I made was to use olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  No problems at all with over-rising, hard crust, or dense bread as stated by others.  My yeast was fresh and the water was 115 degrees. That can make all of the difference in the world when it comes to bread baking!  I plan to use this as my go-to white bread, however I would like to use something other than refined white sugar. Has anyone successfully substituted agave syrup or honey in place of sugar?  I intend to try a few sugar substitutions- but will not alter anything else!

I had been searching for the best bread machine recipe and have found this to be our favorite.  It's easy (I've practically memorized it) and easily customized.  I prefer to make the dough in the machine and bake it in the oven (350 for 25 minutes in my stone loaf pan).  I like a wheat bread, so I substitute 1 c. whole wheat flour.  Also, this recipe takes all purpose flour well, so if I need to stretch my bread flour, I do that.  I've tried white sugar and brown sugar.  It's a great recipe.

This is the only recipe that I use for white bread in my bread machine. It comes out great. I set my crust on medium and it comes out perfect every time. You can also use very soft room temperature butter, or melted butter, which I had to do one time when I realized I was out of oil.

I had loaned my ex-husband my bread machine and he forgot to return the book.  Since I wanted buns for dinner I headed to allrecipes for a substitute to make due.  This will be my new basic recipe! It was so quick and easy and really good.  I only use the machine to make the dough then bake bread in the oven.  I used the dough to make rolls this first time.  The dough seemed kinda heavy when it came out...but it rose nicely and the rolls were soft and wonderfully flavoured.  I will use this recipe as my basic from now on it looks like it can be easily adapted to other things too.  Thank you!

My family LOVES this bread, and it's so easy to make that I'm cranking out at least one loaf a day, if not more!  My only complaint seems to be directly the opposite of the rest of the folks, in that mine rises TOO high, pushing the top open on my bread machine!  For those who are having problems with it not rising and/or collapsing -- the water you're putting in at the start may be too warm.  I keep a large (1.5 litre) bottle of spring water on my counter and use that (room temperature) for the water, instead of the slightly-warmer water the recipe calls for.  Soon I'm going to start doing more experimenting with it as far as adding cheese, herbs, etc.

This bread came out perfect the first time I made it and it's delicious. It's the closest I've come to a good Italian bread in the bread machine. I also used olive oil.

This really was a good recipe. So fast to put together and in no time the kitchen was smelling of home baked bread, which it was. Only change I made was to us regular flour instead of bread machine flour. Will make it again in just a few days.

Good. I think next time I'll add more salt, however, my man enjoyed it the way it was... and aside from the one bite I got, he ate the whole  loaf!

This was my first recipe using a bread machine! I got a bread machine second hand and wanted to try something that seemed nice and easy. This recipe fit the bill flawlessly. I did add a bit more salt, as per other reviews, and it turned out awesome. It's good enough to eat plain and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely be making this again.

I have made this recipe (without alteration) at least 10 times with a perfect result.  Texture, moistness, stability consistent throughout.  Ignore your bread machine recipes; this is a keeper.

I agree with the best reviews. This recipe came out far better than any mix I have ever used. It was so fluffy that I thought it might overflow. But, it didn't and was perfectly cooked! As per one review, I also used slightly less salt.

I used about 1/8 of a cup more of water and this bread turned out perfect!  coated the top with egg whites  and popped it in the oven on 365 for 30 minutes!  PERFECT!  1 and 1/2 hour to rise then punched it down and gave it one more and a 1/2 hours to rise.  It is AWESOME!

I am new to the bread machine world and have tried other recipes before I found this one.  This is by far the best one yet!  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing.  The bread is delicious and stays moist for days, this one is a keeper for sure!

Awesome bread. This bread has the lightest consistency of any bread I've made w/my bread machine. This is definitely going to be the staple recipe for sandwich bread at our house.

Wow, this was soooo good! 

Instead of cooking the bread in the machine, I divided the dough into 15 dinner rolls and baked in the oven for approx 15 minutes at 375 degrees. 

I did use slighly less sugar than called for in the recipe due to the comments I read from others.

This is a definite keeper...thanks!!

This recipe produces an absolutely gorgeous white loaf.
I love my bread maker, because I love the person who gave it to me. But the results were not always what I had hoped.
This recipe was totally against the instructions of the booklet included, but doing things the wrong way round sent gorgeous smells of yeast around and the bread was scrumptiouus.

Nice texture,  wonderful aroma.  However, entirely too much sugar..ended up being much too sweet.  Will make again but will definitely reduce the 3 tablespoons of sugar to 1.

Turned out really good! I used my Bread Machine but used just dough setting. Let it rise one more time and baked in the oven F350 for 20 minutes. I also brushed the bread with egg before putting it to the oven. Looks great and tastes even better ;-))) Thank you for a simple but wonderful recipe!

This is really good! Using bread flour has a small impact on texture, but all-purpose works very well!

I added: 

1/2 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes. If you use the jar, drain well, if reconstituting, be sure tomatoe is full wet!

1 teaspoon dried rosemary

Make small wells in the flour at corners, place equal parts tomatoes in each.  After you have made the well in the center for your yeast, first add the rosemary.

No additional cooking time is needed.

This was really nice... but a bit too salty for me. Next time, I'll reduce the salt by at least 1/4 tsp. I used all purpose flour and that worked beautifully; even used 1 T brown sugar in place of white sugar with good results. Will bake it in the bread machine on the "light" setting next time instead of the "medium" to reduce the thickness of the crust.

Fantastic!  Made was written, however I decided to bake in a conventional oven at 350* for approximately 30 minutes. A light, fluffy bread, with a lovely golden brown crust.  Thanks Diana for the terrific recipe.

I have not made bread at home for a long time because the last few times I did, even with following recipes to the 'T' the bread did not come out looking good or tasting good, UNTIL YESTERDAY!  I am now hooked again on homemade bread, this bread taste just like a french bread, light, airy and great, having to make another today the first is almost gone.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. It was very good bread, but I made a few changes and it came out perfect. I thought it was a little too sweet, so I cut the sugar down to 2 Tbsp. I also substituted 2 Tbsp butter for the 3 Tbsp of oil. I like my bread to be just a little more dense, so rather than 2 1/4 tsp of yeast, I used 1 pkg of rapid rise yeast.  It turned out beautifully and tasted wonderful!

I LOVE this bread! I admit, I adjusted it slightly though, I used honey instead of sugar, used 1/2 cup oat flour in place of 1/2 cup of the bread flour and I always add a little gluten flour when I used my bread machine (I like the consistency of the bread I end up with) usually about 4 tsp. The crust is fantastic and the inside is soft and moist!

This makes a good basic bread.  I have also added various herbs to it and it is great that way as well.  Rosemary and Thyme are my favorite additions.

Great recipe! Simple and bread tastes good. I've made with both the amount of yeast written in this recipe and the amount suggested per cup on the bottle of yeast, which is 1 1/2 tsp. I prefer it with less yeast, but it turns out either way.

Great basic white bread recipe. I made this 50% whole wheat and used the whole wheat setting of my machine. It turned out great.

This is the white bread recipe I have been searching years to find!!! Comes out just like bread from the bakery without having to add wheat gluten for moisture. You have to try this. I have a Breadman machine and used the 1.5 lb setting and Basic with Medium crust.

I subbed almond milk for the water and it was perfect, an excellent white bread recipe.  Hubby made grilled cheese with it and it was excellent.

Easy and awesome. Made a loaf, then made a second one right after since I could see the first loaf wasn't going to last very long.

I loved recipe but was able to make it better. Substitute 3 Tbls. of melted butter for the oil. Use milk instead of water, and use seasoned salt in the place of table salt. It comes out very delish.

Excellent. I wasn't sure because some of the reviews said it was too sweet, so I added an unmeasured amount of sugar, what  thought looked right. Baked beautifully and tasted great! I will definitely use this again!

Maybe it was my bread machine, maybe it was my yeast, but this was awful.  I really had high expectations for this recipe.  It didn't raise well and when it finished baking it tasted awful.  I won't try this one again, sorry!

I made the dough in my bread machine, shaped it by hand and let it rise before baking.  It was delicious.  I made it a second time and used about 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour instead of bread flour.  Again, delicious.  I also made the recipe as is but shaped it into 8 balls, let it rise until doubled and had delicious rolls for pulled pork.  It makes a beautiful dough and I thoroughly enjoy the taste and versatility.  Thank you Diana.

I attempted this recipe exactly as written and in the order as written and it was a complete fail.  Undeterred, I attempted the recipe again, this time I held out to add the salt, and after I put in half the flour, I added the salt, then covered it completely with the other half of the flour.  I then sprinkled the bread machine yeast over evenly.  I used the 'basic setting' with a 'light crust'.  This time it turned out AMAZING!  Easily the best loaf out of the machine hands down. It even keeps well for a good 24 hours (maybe more, but it never stays around that long). The reason I only gave 4 stars is because of the mix up with adding the salt.

This is my first real success with my new bread machine.  What a great recipe!  The last one I tried tasted good but completely collapsed.  This one is a beauty.  I grew up near a bakery, and the aroma coming from my machine brought back warm, fuzzy feelings.  Thanks for what appears to be a no-fail recipe.

Thank you so much! I just got my bread machine second hand a few days ago and my first recipe flopped, but this recipe worked! I followed it exactly and am very pleased! Thanks again... now after making this bread I think I'll continue to use this machine! I was considering dumping it after last nights failure! :)

I bake about 90% of the bread my family eats and find this recipe the one I automaticly put together for our white bread. I seperate it into two hand rolled loaves. I sometimes put 2 to 3 tablespoons of minced garlic and a tablespoon of Epicure Selections pasta seasoning and we find it makes a good sandwhich bread or dinner bread with pasta.

Love Love Love this recipe!  By far the best white bread recipe I've made.  I went against manufacturers suggestion, however, and added all the water, sugar, salt and yeast first, then the flour.  When it was kneading I also added 2 T. Melted butter, as it looked a bit dry.  Yummy!  Rose perfectly, nice and flaky outside, soft inside.

Love this recipe.  I substitute honey for the sugar, and olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Since this recipe makes a big loaf, I mix it in my bread  machine, after mixing, I transfer it to a loaf pan, let it rise and then bake. I use this recipe over and over.

Great texture, good flavor. May use a little more salt next time. Used dough cycle, then baked in buttered bread pan at 350 for 20 minutes. Sliced when fully cooled, and it sliced wonderfully for sandwiches.

I love this recipe. Very easy to make with only a few ingredients. I used yeast for the bread machine instead of the regular kind. It rose beautiful and I got a very wonderful loaf of bread. Thanks for this recipe!!!

It was just ok, nothing outstanding.  Served its purpose which was getting my bread machine to finally make a loaf rise.

If I were out of bread AND out of milk, HAD to have bread AND couldn't get out of the house - I would totally make this again.  Otherwise, I'll stick with the white bread recipe that came with my bread machine.  This recipe is just heavy and greasy and lacks the one thing I LOVE about bread machine bread, and that's the yeast flavor.  Yeast flavor in this bread is undetectable, because all I could taste was flour and oil.  Sorry.

This was fantastic! I used Turbinado in place of white sugar and had to leave the room after it was baked to keep from scarfing down the entire loaf. This is a great vegan-friendly recipe :-)

Best white bread that I have made thus far.  Very easy.  Was great for sandwiches. I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit heavy.  Any suggestions on having it come out lighter?

I got my first bread machine at Christmas and have been starting off slowly with basic white bread before I get more adventuresome.  Made this bread twice.  The first time I set it to medium crust and wasn't sure whether it was 1.5 lb or 2 but set it to 2.  The medium crust was too dark for me but the bread was quite tasty except it tasted really yeasty.  I don't think I put enough salt in it.  Made it again today on light crust and 1.5 setting and put in the amount of salt it called for plus used bread flour, which the first time I used AP.  It was delicious.  Nothing fancy, just really good white bread!

I made it with olive oil and added some fresh basil, rosemary and garlic as another reviewer suggested.  It made a perfectly beautiful loaf in my machine and everyone liked it.  I'll definitely use the recipe as listed for plain white bread on other occasions.  Thanks for posting it, Diana.

Wow!  Made this bread and love it!  Very soft and real yummy.  All my other white bread recipes, crust comes out to crunchy and the bread is always a little coarse, crumbly.  Very simple and tastey recipe!!!  Glad I looked it up!

The first time I made this, the bread rose so high that the bread hit the lid of the bread maker and blocked the vent!  Still turned out a delicious loaf.  For the second loaf, I cut back the yeast to 2 Tablespoons.  It did not rise as far as to block the vent, but still hit the lid.  Next loaf, I will cut the yeast back to 1 and 3/4 and see what happens.  The bread is very light and fluffy.  Made great toast.  It seems to tear easily when cutting, so let it cool.  I will most likely refridgerate the next loaf before cutting if I intend to use it for sandwiches.

Holy Cow!!! This came out perfect!!! I didn't think bread machine could actually taste this good. It's easy to cut, it's stayed fresh (I put it in a bag and then in the fridge), it's stayed softer than any other recipe's I've tried to date, and tastes just like the bread you can get in the store. I WILL be using this recipe from now on! Yippee!!!

Oh YUM! I read through a lot of reviews and and made the following changes based on what I read: Added 1/2 tsp each garlic powder, oregano & basil. Added 1 tsp dried onion. I used olive oil & all-purpose flour in place of the recommended oil & flour. And I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of the white. Set bread machine to dough cycle, removed dough ball and smoothed into loaf pan. I baked it 375' for exactly 25 minutes. This vegan bread is just perfect. The herbs I added gave it a slight hint of flavor without over-powering the delicious bread flavor. The consistency is similar to our local bakery's bread and it's great for sandwiches, just a slice w/ butter, dipping in soups....

This is a great recipe with whole wheat flour also.  I used Canola oil the first time as I didn't have vegetable oil...YUCK.  My fault though.  I used olive oil the next time and it was great.

After years of only occasional use of my bread machine, it may overheat soon.  This bread has become a staple in our house.  I have stopped buying bread at the store.  The flavor is great and the texture is fabulous.  Make this bread!

So easy!  The measurements are forgiving, and once you make it a couple of times you won't even need to remind yourself.  I have never used my bread machine to make fancy stuff but this I can make every few days and justify having it on the counter.  My sons prefer this to store bought bread hands down.

I have to be on a low iodine diet for thyroid cancer treatment in a few months, so we're testing bread recipes for me to eat... and this one was fabulous! The first one we tried was in the bread machine manual and just didn't taste like anything.  This one is slightly sweet, and just perfect.  It was especially good when it was warm, straight from the machine!

I too, reduced sugar to 2 tablespoons and substituted 30g of bran for 30g of flour to give extra flavour and colour. So soft and easy!

I had actually stopped using my bread machine because I never could find a recipe for really good bread from the machine.  But I pulled it out one last time when I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try and this is it!  The crust is not hard and the bread is so soft.  My kids love it and want me to bake it everyday.

I tinkered and I am truely sorry but if you increase yeast to 2-1/2 tsps, the bread is like eating a cloud. Just fantastic. I've had great comments and people want to work my little bread machine to death.

I made this basic white bread for a friend who is undergoing radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer, which means she can’t eat the regular iodine found in many foods for the next couple of weeks. I used olive oil and no-iodine salt as recommended by the NIH guidelines for this treatment. I used 2 tsp of yeast as per other recommendations, subbed 1/2 cup of white flour for wheat, and I used the 80 minute setting. My friend loved it.

I love this bread! My bread machine has 3 settings for white bread - I have to use the light setting, otherwise the crust is more crispy than I like.

This bread is good.  It is better if you use the dough cycle and bake it.  Everytime I try to add anything to the bread it doesn't work, but it is good white bread.

This bread was exceptionally easy to make and turned out just perfect.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding 1/2 tsp. salt.  It's definitely a keeper.

This was my first attempt of making the bread "from scratch", I have always used the box mixes, and now I know why! This was AWFUL, It did not rise properly, I think it was too dry, I will not try this one again.

This is THE BEST bread my bread machine has ever made. It's good all the time, as a snack, with a meal, whatever... and it makes the whole house smell wonderful. It has never failed me yet, and I must have made it a hundred times by now. I used to buy those bread mix packages at the store but nothing ever turned out this good! Everyone I know loves it, and always wants more. A+!!

If you are reading this review, STOP. YOU ARE WASTING TIME! You could be this many seconds closer to eating this delicious bread. If you have 2 bread machines, get them both going with this recipe. The first loaf will be devoured by you and your family as soon as it comes out.  Don't change anything, it is perfect! I use light crust setting and it is a small loaf for those of you with that setting option.

I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. I also used a package of active dry yeast. I didn't measure the yeast. Bread was delicious and turned out perfect!

Absolutely wonderful bread!  I did a few things differently:  used bread machine yeast, didn't proof yeast, and added ingredients accordance with my bread machine's instructions.  

I was rewarded with a light, fluffy, beautiful 2 lb. loaf of the best bread I have ever tasted!  My family was very impressed.  Seriously, I make at least one loaf of this bread daily.  thank you for a great recipe!

One question though, has anyone used this on a delayed baking schedule?  If so, what were the results?

I used AP flour.  Set machine for 1.5 lb loaf and erred when I forgot to used room temp water.  I used straight from tap cold.  I did sift dry ingredients together and I believe that improved texture immensely. Everything else I kept same.  
I also cheated and started cutting right away.  It looked gummy.  I was just happy I have dogs so it wouldn't be wasted.  I got distracted long enough for the bread to cool and went to slice it up for the puppers and a miracle happened! It was perfect. Apparently the steam when hot will make the bread gummy so it's imperative to use patience and wait for it to cool a bit before slicing.  Happy ending, it was fabulous. My extremely picky eaters loved it. It was easy to spread peanut butter and jelly.  Toasted up great.  Bread maker is a Cuisinart BK-100.

This came out good. I'm new to bread making and my first loaf was terrible. This one came out much better! I used bread machine yeast instead of active dry yeast, so only used 1.5 tsp. I would definitely make this again. Love making my own bread!

Perfect. I made this three times and it came out beautifully every time. I love the texture and flavor. I don't see it going stale any faster than a normal homemade loaf - it's normal for homemade not to last as long as store bought because there aren't any preservatives in it. 

Details:  Breadman machine on the 1.5lb loaf, medium crust setting. 

Yeast was Flieschmann's instant. 

Flour was King Arthur's Bread Flour. 

Oil on the first loaf was half olive oil and half canola because I was out of canola. Second and third loaves I used soy bean oil just because it was cheap. The olive oil loaf did taste different and was a little lighter than the other two, but they were all good.

Good basic recipe with minimal ingredients. I took the dough out before it had completely risen, sprinkled a bit of flour on countertop, flattened the dough, sprinkled a thick layer of cinnamon sugar, rolled back up, tucked the ends under, a bit of vegetable oil patted on the top of the loaf. Voila.  Cinnamon roll bread.  I like this recipe because it is vegan, for my lactose-intolerant partner.

The bread tasted and smelled so good!  It was my first real bread in the bread machine (I've only made cakes before).  I might cut down on the yeast though because the bread was desperate to push open the top of my machine when I checked it at the end.  It rose a little TOO much.  My house did smell great in the morning though!

I read the recipe and made it right away in my bread machine.  The only variation was 2 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour.  It is a delicious loaf and I will make again soon.

Read The Little Red Hen in class today.  Brought in my bread machine so my students could see, smell and taste freshly baked bread.  They loved it!  Some was left after school and my son and daughters ate it.  They loved it as well.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  I used my scale to measure out the yeast, and it called for 7 grams.

I made this several times as directed and was very good.  I just tried making it with coconut oil substituted for vegetable oil.  The bread was a little smaller but more moist.  Either way it's a great, easy recipe!

I am making my 2nd loaf as I write this. This is a quick and easy recipe especially for someone like me who is slowly trying to make everything as close to homemade as I can with the busy schedule I have. LOVE IT!

This is the best bread I have ever made.  The texture is perfect.  It is soft and spongy.  It has great flavor.  We had none leftover.  I could probably make a loaf a day.  It is also a very forgiving recipe.  I put ingredients in different order, and if still came out perfect.  I accidentally stopped my bread machine so I had to put the dough in a bread pan and bake it in the oven.  Still a perfect loaf!

I have made this for several holidays (and a few weekdays!) and it gets rave reviews every time!  I like add-ins however and I highly recommend dried onion flakes, sesame seeds, black pepper, and dill.  Thank you for this recipe!  I have not purchased bread in almost an entire year!

I have made this recipe (unaltered) twice this week already.  It is a keeper.  Beautiful, the best I have ever made in my machine. This recipe is 5 stars. **Suggestions and comments.. I have also altered this recipe. However, my rating is on the unaltered version.  I also made this with all purpose flour.  It did not rise as well.  In fact it was about 30 percent smaller.  Of course, that made it dense. But, it was still yummy.  I also made this with olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It was a tiny bit smaller, but the taste was even better.  I read some reviews that suggested decreasing the amount of salt for taste.  I realize that salt adds flavor.  It also governs the power of the yeast.  Without salt your bread will have a coarser quality because it rose too fast. Too little salt will make the dough rise fast that it will fall before it is done baking.  Too much salt will kill the yeast.  Salt also helps the bread from getting stale to fast.

This is by far the best bread machine recipe I have found. I learned that I hate bread machine crusts so, I put mine on the light setting and took it right out of the pan when it is done. Thanks!!

This is super simple and SUPER delish! Instead of sugar I use Honey and instead of "salt" I use Hymilian  Sea Salt and instead of vegetable oil I use coconut oil. Very very good and my kids LOVE it!

I made this loaf exactly as written and honestly I've never had a loaf of bread turn out so badly.  The top completely sunk, didn't brown and ended up being oddly crunchy.  That being said it was edible so I ended up cutting off the u-shaped top crust.

This is great!  Perfect crust and nicely dense but fluffy inside.  I used all purpose flour and olive oil and it turned out fantastic on the rapid setting!

My family LOVES this recipe! The first time I made it I mixed and baked it in the bread machine, but it came out burned. So I decided to just use the bread machine for mixing and then I baked the loaf in the oven and it came out perfect! My family loves it so much that I have to make this bread in double batches! I actually have my bread machine mixing a double batch as I'm typing this! To make this bread the way I do: Have 2 well-oiled bread pans ready. Change the "servings" in this recipe to "24". Add all ingredients to your bread machine in the order given. Turn your bread machine settings to "Dough". Once the machine has completed this cycle, you'll notice the bread will be puffing up above your breadpan. Remove the dough from pan and punch down. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a loaf and place in the breadpans. Cover the pans with a cloth and place in a warm area to rise for 30 to 45 minutes - preheat oven to 425 during the last 10 minutes. Place bread in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Enjoy!

This was very fast and very easy.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because: a) while it's tasty enough, it's not outstanding - just a really good loaf of sandwich bread for the family's lunches and b) I reduced the salt to 1 t and the yeast to 2 t.  I didn't try it as written - I don't use more than a t of salt in a loaf and I don't use that much yeast with only 3 c of flour.  It rose perfectly with these quantities so if you're not a fan of salt or yeasty smells, you don't lose anything in the rise by reducing these (in fact, it smelled great).  I kept the sugar as-is despite some of the reviews.  I guess it's a matter of taste - this didn't taste too sweet at all.  Just right.

Having never used one I got a flea market bread machine for $15 followed this recipe and had fresh bread right away! The only comment I would add is I added the water the four then the rest as I have read adding the yeast out of order might make the bread fall.

This recipe turned out fantastic! I think that bread machine white breads usually turn out too thick or too crusty, but this one had a perfect consistency. The smell was overwhelmingly intoxicating while rising away. A note though: I had to add more flour (probably about 1/4 cup more) both times that I used this recipe. Not a significant amount though. Thank you, whoever submitted this : )

Best bread machine recipe yet. I add 2 tsp. garlic powder to the mix. When it is finished baking, spread butter and a little garlic salt on the crust. Super yummy!

This was the first recipe I've found that actually tastes good out of the bread machine. It's what I use when I'm to tired to make bread by hand. ^.^

I made this twice last weekend - didn't change a thing.  Couldn't be easier and very, very good.  It does stale quickly, but it makes amazing peanut butter toast and French toast on day 2...that is, IF there's enough leftover from day 1!

I LOVE this recipe!!  I tried the white bread recipe that come with my new breadmaker, and it was heavy and dense....so, I looked up recipes online and tried several of those...same results.  I'm so happy to Finally have a recipe for such a light and fluffy white bread, and it's so easy and economical too.  I used it to make Monte Cristos with the left over Thanksgiving turkey...and they were the best I've ever made.  This will be the only white bread recipe I use from now on!!   =))

My family and I didn't like the flavour of this bread. You could taste the yeast and that's all you smell in the house. There is way too much yeast in this recipe. I am going to find another bread machine recipe to use.

I've made this a couple of times now and mine has always fallen a little. So I am trying only 1.5 t. Of yeast.  I also found a HUGE bag of bread flour from Sam's Club for $11 and its working awesome. Also am trying garlic salt in place of regular. Once I figure out what works I'll update my review. Btw I have an Oster bread machine. Almost forgot the best part... This makes *amazing* French toast!!!

I've only had my machine since Christmas, and it didn't come with a white bread recipe so I've been on the hunt for a good one. I was worried because we have just moved to a higher altitude but I tried this last night and its the softest I've made yet and my 21 month old daughter can't get enough!! Hubby will love it I'm sure!

Made the dough in bread machine and the placed it in pan and let it come to another rise and then baked on 350 for 20 minutes. The bread came out wonderful and tasted delicious. My family loved it and I love how simple and inexpensive this bread is to make. This is a keeper.

Even better than the recipe that came with my bread maker.  Makes a consistently fluffy, soft loaf of bread with a nice flaky crust.  Absolutely awesome with my morning cup of coffee.

I make this bread in the oven and its awesome. I hand knead the dough for 10 minutes and then I put it in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap for 30 min. I then stretch that dough on a baking mat to about 9" X 14" and a 1/2" thick and  then roll it up like a cinnamon roll and put it in a greased bread pan and poke it with a fork a couple of times. Cover it up again and let it rise for 60 minutes. Then bake at 400 degrees for 23-25 minutes

Simple recipe and dairy-free which is a plus.  Down side is that it got noticeably stale fairly quickly.  Still... great as long as you don't plan to use it slowly.

I make this recipe every week for our bread.  I rarely buy bread any more.  If I feel like being healthier I use 1 cup light whole wheat flour and 2 cups white flour.  It is very good!

I acquired a bread machine about a year ago. This was the 3rd recipe I tried and I stopped looking right then. So simple and delicious! This is the only recipe for white bread I have used since! I recently tried making it with all-purpose flour and it even works with that. Just make sure your water is VERY warm. I pre-measure the flour so I can just dump it in when it's time, not giving the water a chance to cool off much at all. If I could give this 20 stars, I would!

Incredible!! I used all purpose flour and canola oil because that is what I had and it still came good. Light fluffy and smooth. Thanks for the great recipe.

Turns out perfect every time.  My bread maker is small so I use the dough setting and bake in a bread pan in the oven.  Makes very yummy sandwiches.

This bread is sooooooooo good!!  I made this as directed, then when finished with the first rise, I rolled into a rectangle, and sprinkled some Cheddar cheese, and randomly laid some Jalapeno slices from a jar.  I then folded the bread over a little at a time and pressed together until all was folded,, I then tucked the ends underneath to form a loaf, and put it into a sprayed bread pan for final rise,  I then baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Will use this recipe many more times!!

Not the very best, but for such few ingredients, not bad at all.  I've made this bread twice now.  Both times I doubled the recipe and just used the dough cycle.  baked 2 loaves of bread for 30 - 40 min. on middle rack.  The second time I made it I used 5 cups white flour and 1 cup of wheat germ.

This was my first dip into the bread-machine pool, and this recipe was very tasty; just right in texture and flavor!  I made 2 loaves in two days, both with the same caution; the first came out perfect, but the second came out with an inverted top. I believe the only difference was that in the first, I used water that was 120 degrees. But, regardless, they were both delicious. Also, after I took it it out, I brushed butter on the top: yummy!

It's the easiest white bread you could make. Quite edible, but dry, so I can't recommend it for sandwiches, but that could be because it is gluten free, which I like. I am not good enough to alter recipes, so I am still looking for sandwich bread. Try this if you are just starting to use your bread machine. You will impress yourself!

This bread was wonderful. I have had my bread machine for a week and have tried a lot of recipes, this is the first one that really tastes like my idea of "homemade" bread. I chose the light crust setting on my machine and it's perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I have used MANY recipes for a bread machine, this one is the easiest,most  consistant one I've found. Although I have used a few different yeasts, Fleischmanns RapidRise works better than say Red Star for a light crust.

This is a really fantastic and soft white bread recipe. In fact, out of all the recipes for any variety of bread I've made in my trusty bread machine, this is far and away the closest to store bought bread I've ever come. In my Cooks Essential this recipe worked best on the white bread setting as a 1.5lb loaf with a light crust. Perfect!

Recently acquired a bread machine & searched for a recipe without eggs and milk so I could use the timer. I have used this recipe over & over with variations of melted margarine instead of oil, 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour. Now I have tried it for cinammon rolls & yes, it is the best of best doughs. The last test I gave it was to use regular flour & yup, it was terrific! Thanks, Diana for sharing this recipe.

My only negative critique is that it didn't come out as big as I would have liked. What I loved was the density.  For those looking for a homemade bread that makes a good sandwich, this is the bread for you!  It is a winner and has been put with my other favorite bread recipes.  I am going to try it on the dough setting and baking it in the oven as well to see how it turns out.

This bread is excellent!  I decreased the sugar to 2 Tbsp. and used all-purpose flour.  The family inhaled the whole loaf in one sitting.

Excellent recipe, I needed dairy free and sugar free, so I used splenda. The first loaf I did in the machine was rather small. I used the machine to mix the ingredients and rise, but then I let it rise again on the counter and then baked in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes. Turned out excellent, nice large size loaf. Loved it, this is my recipe I will used now. I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour and two cups white flour in another loaf and turned out very good as well.

I was looking for a dairy free recipe for white bread for my bread machine.  This recipe has never failed me.  I've made it dozens of times, and it always turns out perfect.  I bake a couple of these to use for thanksgiving dressing.  I will never use another white bread recipe....there is no need!

I love this recipe! I chose to use my bread machine for the mixing and kneading of the dough, then bake in the oven at 375 degrees for 25 min. I made a couple of minor changes. Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil like many of the other reviewers, when I ran out of olive oil, I used canola oil and both loaves came out great tasting. The texture was a little airy and I had a hard time cutting it into slices. So the next time I made the bread I added 2 Tablespoons of "Blue Chip" Dough Enhancer per 3 cups of white flour and it was the perfect bread! My husband loves it!

The bread looks good, the texture is good, but the bread does not taste good. It's actually salty and almost inedible. I may make this again and decrease the amount of salt by a full teaspoon, but as-is, it's horrible.

Great recipe. Been looking for a good white bread recipe for my bread machine  since I  got it. Once again it passed the ultimate test, my wife loved it. Is better than any bread machine mix I've ever tried. Will definatly make it again.

This bread is absolute Heaven!  I followed the recipe exact placing all the ingredients in my bread machine according the the manufacturers recommendations this morning before I left for the gym.  When I got home my house smelled wonderful.  The bread tastes even better.  I hope I have some left for a sandwich for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is going to be the only recipe I use from now on.  I had tried a few others since I got my bread machine a week and a half ago but every time I ended up with a hard crust.  Not this time!  I used the light crust and basic settings and it came out perfect.  The only change I made was I used turbinado sugar and not white sugar, which isn't a huge change really.  Excellent recipe thank you!

This bread is like candy, you don't want to stop eating it. I bake mine on the light crust setting and my sandwiches have never been better. This is exactly what a classic white bread loaf should taste like.

The Best! Even make it with all-purpose flour. A bit denser but still great. Since finding this recipe I make 8 loaves in 2 weeks. No more purchasing bread for this family.

Can't get anymore basic than this. If you're looking for plain white bread here it is. I followed the recipe exactly. I Would have given it 5 stars but I did find it a little salty. Will reduce the salt next time by a little bit.
UPDATE: I added a mix of dried parsley, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning and it turned out great! Didn't last very long at my house.

This bread is fantastic! Everyone warned me that it was difficult to make bread because of the altitude(I live in Denver,CO).  Boy were they right until I found this recipe.  Thank you!

bread came out very good.  i messed up by putting everything in the bread machine and pushing white bread and manual at the same time and it just rose but never started to bake.  i took it out of the machine and put in a oval cassarole dish about 2 -1/2 qt. and baked it. it came out wonderful.  thanks for the recipe

I have finally found the PERFECT white bread recipe (after searching and trying for six months!) for my bread machine.  Followed recipe exactly.  The only problem with this recipe....is that there aren't any leftovers for sandwiches on the second day!  Thank you for sharing.

I literally make this recipe everyday.  I use corn oil to keep it soy free as opposed to vegetable oil.  I have used organic flour and Red Mill's flour with 30% whole wheat.  Both make successfully risen loaves.

I just got a bread machine, and for my very first loaf I tried this recipe. It turned out well. I used quick rise yeast but kept the recipe the same. Consequently I used the rapid-bake setting on the machine. The bread was a little on the salty side for me, so next time I use this recipe I may reduce the salt. Bread-making is so easy with a bread machine.

This came out perfectly the first time I made it - I was so impressed!

I used 3 tsp. of yeast, and replaced 1/4 c. of the flour with gluten.  I let it rise too long - both times - and it still came out beautifully golden brown and moist.  

I will definitely make it again!

I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and used the light crust setting on my bread maker.  This is the best white bread recipe I have tried so far!  It is very simple, has few ingredients, and turns out perfect every time.  We used the last night's leftover bread to make grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch today, and they were amazing!

This recipe was not very good.  I carefully measured the ingredients and I did not alter the recipe.  I thought that it was very heavy and not very flavorful.  I was very hungry and I could not wait to taste it when it finished cooking, but when I did, I was very disappointed.   It is not something that I will bother to try to improve.  The recipe that came with my machine was much better than this.

This is an exceptional recipe! by far the best white bread I have ever made in the machine... its fluffy.. unbelievably fluffy and the crust is flaky and soft.
I reduced the sugar to 2T 
set my machine on1.5lb loaf and crust color as "light" 
perfection!

I intended to make this and then cube to make homemade croutons but we have already eaten 2 thick slices with butter.. and its divine.

This is the best bread I have made so far!! My daughter is super picky and she LOVES this bread! I have been making this bread every day, and everyone eats it right away! Some reviews stated the crust came out too crusty, I have 2 machines and one came out hard and the other one came out soft, like Wonder Bread. Even when the one that came out hard, it was still great! I have another loaf in the machine right now! Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried this bread recipe. It is a good recipe as far as taste, but the crust gets really hard. I haven't found a bread machine recipe yet that has a soft crust bread yet. The crust was as hard as a rock. Other then that it was good.

I thought this was a really good recipe. I didn't find it too sweet at all. The thing I didn't really like is that it was rather heavy, but that could be because of my yeast. I will definetly use this recipe often.

This recipe turned out wonderfully!  reduced the salt just a bit to suit my taste.

I think those of you who are complaining about the bread not riding may want to check the yeast you are using. I have made this bread several times with excellent results. It is VERY important that you check the DATE on your yeast! This is a common problem, and can be a major disappointment I know! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was very easy to put together and turned out yummy.  I liked this recipe a lot better than the one I had been using.  I substituted olive oil for the veggie oil and reduced the salt.  I will definitely make this one from now on!

This recipe turned out terrible for me. The bread was dense and hard. I used Gold Medal Bread Flour and I think the problem was there wasn't enough liquid in the recipe. The dough never achieved the proper kneading texture. If you want to try this, I'd say watch the bread machine as its kneading to make sure the proper texture develops. Add water as necessary. 
I don't know how it tasted because I just threw it out.

Very good bread....It seemed dry in the machine as it was mixing and I did have to add a little bit more oil, but other than that, it came out perfect and went well with a salad that I had for dinner.

This is absolutely the best bread machine recipe.  It even can be made by hand.  My bread machine died in mid-knead, and I didn't want to waste the dough - what a perfect loaf of bread!!!

I did not think this bread was very good. I made it twice, and each time I was disappointed. The bread is too sweet, and the crust is not chewy at all. It is crispy and sugary. This will not be used again. It is, however, very easy and quick to put together.

Amazing!  First time I followed recipes and instructions exactly... was great.  But the loaf is so tall it’s hard to get a regular sized sandwich slice.  Second time I tried it..... I again followed the recipe exactly but veered from the instructions and stopped the machine right before it started to bake.  I decided to follow the suggestions from one of the reviewers.  I took the dough ball, punched it out.  Pulled to fit into loaf pan, lightly covered with plastic wrap and then put it in my microwave that I had “pre-warmed” by heating 1 cup of water for two minutes first.  Half hour rest. And then baked in my preheated 350F oven for 27 minutes.   Perfection.  Light, airy bread that everyone is raving over and I am infatuated by.

This bread was perfect!! It was delicious with butter when it was fresh and warm, and we are also using it for sandwiches. I highly recommend this bread recipe. It will be our go-to bread now.

This recipe is so amazing and boosted my confidence in bread-making!  The bread turns out perfect every time and my kids love it!  I used the 2lb setting on my bread machine.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I can make my own loaves weekly now and get great use out of my bread machine!

An uncomplicated every day bread. I used the light crust setting and 1.5 pound size. Turned out better than most of the breads I have made in my Cuisinart bread machine. Nice  texture. Great for sandwiches.

Absolutely the best white bread I've made in the bread machine. Be sure to use bread flour, not all- purpose. I used rapid rise yeast and the bread rose beautifully.

I loved the recipe and the bread came out great! However, I did make a few adjustments. I added powdered milk (2 tablespoons) and reduced the yeast by 1/4 teaspoon. I found that 2 1/4 teaspoons made it rise too much and my loaf was hitting the plastic cover of my machine.

Wow! I have been baking with a machine for a long time, all kinds of loaves with ingredients like eggs, yogurt, nuts, dried milk, but this simple easy loaf blew us away.  I have renewed use of the machine because I have a family member who needs low fiber food and we have a habit of buying whole grain bread and then needing white for her.  Everyone loves this! "Vegetable oil" is olive oil, safflower oil, many things, including the avocado oil that I used .

I can't find break machine mix in a box anymore in stores, no idea why. So this was the first go at winging it from scratch. I have a 1 1/2lb loaf bread machine. Read reviews saying the top caved in and made the mistake of choosing to use less yeast 1.5 teaspoons instead of what was called for. Live and learn I guess. My bread tasted fine but it didn't rise enough to where it was light and fluffy. I could tell right away taking it out of the machine it wasn't quite right. In fact it was heavy and supers dense. Next go around I'll stick to the recipe as called for and hope it comes out right this time.

Update: Second loaf much improved. In my first trial the dough was so dense during the mixing cycle that the paddle was straining the motor to move it around. Did some reading and one website mentioned using at least 1 1/2 cups of water to 3 cups of bread flour. I went with the the amount of yeast called for and increased the water to 1 1/2 cups. Result was light and airy with a good crust on the outside. More of what I was looking for. My only concern was the bread rose too high until it was almost if not right against the viewing window. It didn't cave or collapse though. Might try a little less yeast in the future but the recipe is definitely a keeper so I'm increasing my rating to 5 stars.

This is my absolute ‘go to’ recipe for white bread in the bread machine! Super easy- and the ingredients are likely to be on hand every time. The aroma is wonderful, density is nice enough for thinner slices- and perfect for a hearty French toast!

I increased the sugar to one third cup. I decreased the salt to one tsp. I make this bread regularly. We like homemade bread. Instead of buying store bread.

for a basic white bread this is really good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I've also added garlic, basil, and oregano to make an "Italian" style bread, and that was amazing.  

This recipe is a perfect base for numerous flavor combinations.  

Thank you so much for sharing it!

I've been making this bread almost everyday for 3 weeks, it's great just as the recipe is. Because it's such a basic recipe it's also great for adding flavors. Rosemary, garlic, cheese, honey, cinnamon raisin, any flavor or combination you like.  I cut it thin for my sons P.B.&J., the and thick for my boyfriend.     I normally just bake it in the bread maker, but today I did the 2nd rise in a pan and baked it in a 350* oven for 45 min. It tastes just as good, without the extra crusty ends my family doesn't like (they do make for a good bread pudding).

My daughter is on LID, and we needed bread that she could eat.  Made this in a VERY old breakmaker that has been sitting in my cabinet.  Used non-iodized salt, but other than that, followed the recipe to the T.  The bread is DELICIOUS!  So simple, and so yummy!

Easy ingredients, easy to toss together and yummy.  I'm normally a fan of rustic crusty breads but needed a quicky white-type bread and this is the best I've made. I did butter the top 1/2 way through baking cycle but other than that followed recipe exactly.  Will be my "go-to" from now on.

Amazing bread!! Only changes we made were to lessen the yeast (2tsp) and salt (1/4tsp). We've tried a few bread recipes and this is by far the best and easiest to make. A+++++

Just made this and oh... my... god. SO good. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I added a teaspoon each of dried parsley, oregano, Italian seasoning, onion salt, and garlic salt. I also used rapid-rise yeast, so I set the machine to rapid bake, white bread, 1.5 lbs (perfect for crispier crust and super soft bread). #Drool

I used all purpose flour and bread still sliced very nice. Easy to throw together and I recommend setting your bread machine for a medium crust cover. I will be making this again.

It turned out fine with 1/4 cup more flour - I used regular flour. Very pretty loaf but I like a little more flavor.

This is an excellent sandwich bread. I left a cup of flour out to make sure the dough wasn't too stiff. I only had to add back in about 1/2 a cup. Super easy and very good toasted too.

Completed recipe as says no changess made.. came out dry and bland, not like a yeast bread is suppose to. Try revamping this recipe by adding something to make it moist, water alone dont cut it for me, sorry.

This is becoming my go-to bread recipe.  The bread flour and yeast quantity have worked well for me. I made a couple changes based on my preference:  honey in place of sugar, and instead of baking in my machine I used the dough cycle and baked it in a loaf pan in my oven @ 350 for up to 25 min.

I followed the recipe to a T. The only thing I would change is to bake it in the oven vs the bread machine.  I dislike how thick the crust is, and how uneven the top is. I'm ridiculous like that. The bread though was fluffy and moist. Amazing texture and taste. It seemed solid, however the day after will be the ultimate test. I will update after I bake it via the oven.

Just exactly what I was looking for. A good simple loaf of white bread. I mix the dough and let it rise once in the bread machine, then transfer it to a glass loaf pan, let it rise again until it's reasonably tall over the side and then bake it for 23-25 minutes at 375. (I don't like the odd shape loaf with the hole from the paddle in the bottom the bread machine bakes). 

It turns out golden brown and delicious! I have also made it with olive oil which subtly changes the taste, also nice.

The loaf looked pretty but the taste didn't wow me. It reminded me of store bought sandwich bread like Wonder bread. The search continues for the perfect bread recipe.

Made this in my bread machine tonight and it turned out perfect! Excellent crust, taste and texture. And so simple! I've tried other recipes but they never turned out as well as this one. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Great for a basic, white loaf of bread.  I made a few alterations to the recipe: I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and coconut sugar in place of white sugar.  I also used instant yeast and the rapid setting on my bread machine.  Turned out great!

Bread almost busted out of the 2lb bread machine. It had the classic white bread texture inside, but I set my machine to dark so the crust was amber and had a delicate crisp all around which is what I hoped for. I'll make this again.

I used someone else's suggestion on reducing the yeast to 1.5 tsp yeast to prevent falling and added 1 tsp. xanthan gum. Wonderful texture! Would like to try adding some flavorful herbs next time, as someone else suggested!

The recipe doesn't say what loaf size to use.  I have an old Oster bread maker with just a large and small setting.  I used the large setting and it worked fine.

If you live in a cold house, warm the bread cylinder with hot water. Add ingredients in the order posted. If your first loaf comes out flat, add 0.5 tsp.  I add an egg.

(It works well w rye flour. I have done 2c white and 1c rye. My 2c rye 1c white is mixing now. i also used 4 tablespoons of real Canadian maple syrup in place of sugar. Will update)

I just made this with my 11 year old girl, and it tastes delicious. I added an extra Tablespoon of sugar.  I turned them into bread sticks and they are soooo good!  My children gobbled it up! :)
I also sat and made 20 of them in quart size bags with the directions on the box I am storing them in. I showed my children and said that they could make bread rolls, cinnamon rolls, and bread machine bread.  Thanks for sharing it!

So quick and easy! I used a mix of 00' Flour  and ap  flour and it turned out  great. Can't wait to see how it is with just bread flour! Definitely a keeper! Oh and I used butter not oil! I may try milk in place of the water next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out delicious! I have tried many recipes for my bread machine and they just didn't taste "right". I was going for my mom's Thanksgiving bread and this is as close as you can get. :)

This is the go to recipe for all my breads! The only changes are putting in the oil right after the water (according to my machine's instructions) and only using 2 tsp of yeast. I get beautiful, delicious bread every time! This recipe never fails! Because of the simplicity of this recipe, it is easy to experiment and try new add ins! Diana, you're my heroine!

This is the best bread machine recipe yet. I've tried several from this site and this one is a keeper. The bread turned out wonderful. The smell of fresh baked bread in the house made me want to make more so I added some sunflower seeds and flax to the next batch and it too turned out great. I'm making our bread from now on since it has become so expensive to buy these days and I've found the right recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

I love this recipe, and so does my boyfriend! It turns out amazing every time! The only change I make is to use all purpose flour instead of bread flour. It is great with Jam on it or just butter. It couldn't get any better!

I had only coconut oil on hand so that's what I used. Took out the second the buzzer beeped and just plain it was literally the best bread I've had in a very long time, if ever! Top with butter and honey or jam for breakfast or make the perfect turkey sandwich for lunch with this dairy free delicious bread machine bread. Store in a double zip lock bag in the bread box to keep fresh.  So easy!

Italian dressing in the place of oil. Tried it both ways and really like it, in fact my family liked it so much they refuse to buy bread anymore so I make it daily. Saves $ and its yummy!

I've never made a "toss it in at once" bread recipe in my bread machine, so I was a bit skeptical. However, this has quickly become my go to recipe in the last couple weeks. I have made it four times and each time, it remains the same, •a light to medium crust with a soft, stretchy center•. It takes just a minute or two to gather (Canola, not veg oil), then measure the ingredients into the machine, turn in on, walk away, and in three hours, it's done!

Every time I tip it over on the rack, the top crust isn't effected and doesn't drop at all.

If it lasts past the few minutes after being placed on the cooling rack, we've made toast and Paninis with it. It's absolutely delish!

My lovely mother-in-law enjoyed it so much, she even asked for the recipe. Thankies ever so much for posting this.

Really enjoyed this. Used the Cuisinart 200 breadmaker and medium crust. Crust was a little darker than I prefer next time I will try to use the light crust. Toasted up really nice.

I make this recipe often. Sometimes I let it bake in the machine and sometimes I just  use the dough setting and bake it in a loaf pan so it doesn't have those holes in the bottom. Very easy and delicious. In my Breadman, I use the 1.5 lb. Loaf setting with light crust. Mmmmmm.
Only downside is it can be crumbly

It is the easiest recipe ever and it turned out perfectly ! I used all-purpose flour. I have made three times this week.  Once I had oil I wanted to use up so I increased oil to 1/4 c. oil and made no other changes.  It still turned out great!

I have made this recipe several times "as is" and it is consistent and really good.  I wanted to make it according to the recipe before I start tinkering with it.  The only tinkering I have made is to replace the 3 Tablespoons of sugar with 3 Tablespoons of Truvia (baking) sugar substitute.  My family loved it and it eliminates the calories from the sugar.  Will continue making this!

Made exactly as recipe stated. The whole family loves this recipe and prefers this over store bought. This is excellent bread for grilled cheese & tomato soup!

I preheat to 400 and COOK@ 350(because you always lose a lot of heat when you open the oven to put the loaf in) for 25-30 minutes. Perhaps not the tastiest bread I've ever had but, as others have posted, you can add things to enhance the flavour if you like. It browns great and cuts easy. The other recipes I tried would mangle the bread when tried to cut it into slices.  It also lasts a surprising amount of time before going bad. That's it for store bought bread for me!

This was my 4th loaf of bread I made with my new bread maker. Following the instructions exactly this loaf came out perfect. My household devoured it, there is another one in the machine right now. My machine has a weight button, I used the 1.5lb setting, medium crust &  basic bake. I also used olive oil. Has anyone got a good alternative to sugar?

It was easy to make, basic ingredients, and came out like bread so it was a success.  At the same time it wasn't anything special to make it memorable.  As a basic bread recipe it's good enough.  I will try it again as well as make custom additions to it making specialized bread with this as the base.

Used olive oil and added about 3tbs of half and half due to my altitude. I also added about a 1/4 cup of flax seeds. Great simple recipe. Turned out delicious and soft!

This is a perfect, standard, tasty white bread. It was so easy with my new bread machine! It is pretty squishy and soft, which made it delicate and hard to slice for sandwiches. It is delicious anyway though.

My first time ever making bread and it didn't turn out too good.  I'm going to try again and see what I did wrong.  I was really looking forward to eating this bread.

I went back to make this bread the second time and realized I had measured a few ingredients incorrectly the first round.  The second time around, the bread turned out beautiful!  After letting it cool down and settle, I cut it the next day and it tasted just like and much better than the bread I buy from the store.

Good flavor and texture. Definitely will make it again. I kept it in the fridge  to preserve freshness. Next time I will try to reduce the sugar by half.

I usually don't write reviews but after reading some of the one and two stars I decided to give my two cents. This is our go to bread. I have two picky boys (one who has a dairy allergy) and they both love love love this bread. That is a big thing in this house. I have found if you put in the ingredients in this order it helps- yeast, water (110 degrees) sugar, salt, oil, and flour. I measure as I go. Also my machine rests as it's first step, kneads, rests and kneads again. It has two kneading flipper things. I don't know much about bread machines I just know I love mine. I have a Zojirushi bb-pac20. It also has a warmer on the top of it to cook and brown the top of the bread. Hope this helps a little.

Used this recipe to make the first loaf in my new bread maker today, it is very simple to make, however it has nothing as far as taste. Would be good for toast or sandwiches, I think I might add more sugar or some honey next time.

Am making my second loaf in three days!  I was out of bread flour so used all-purpose flour for the first loaf.  The loaf is soft and delicious.  Great for sandwiches and toast.  I've tried many bread machine recipes and this is our new favorite at 5 stars!

We've made this bread every single day for over a month now. We do 4 tbsp of coconut oil (melted or unmelted!). 3 tbsp of coconut oil was tasty, but it just wasn't quite what we wanted.

We use this recipe every time we make fry bread. I make the dough in my bread machine. One batch makes plenty for my family of 5 with enough left over to have with lunch the next day. I've also used it to make a regular loaf in the machine. Turns out perfect every time. We don't ever worry about it going stale because there's never any left after dinner.

I follow the directions word for word but substituted butter for oil and it is the very best I've white bread I tasted or seen.  It helps to mix the sugar and yeast in warm water and let it work for 10 minutes then add the other ingredients.  I also heat the pan with hot water so its warm to begin with.  Shred the bread machine instructions.

So, maybe it's my machine, or some other unknown factor. I made it as the directions said, and it didn't rise at all. Just became this rather hard lump. Overall unsatisfied since I expected more out of such a highly rated bread machine recipe.

Amazing! I tried many white bread recipes in the past and this is the best! I will not look for another one. The texture is very soft and moist. This recipe was perfect and I will not change it

LOVE THIS.
I make it savory by adding an extra quarter cup of water, extra table spoon of oil and then add half table spoons of thyme, rosemary, oregano and then a half tea spoon of black pepper and sage.

*Note
You can make this recipe sweet and savory by adding an extra 2 table spoons of sugar ;)

Very easy to make, tastes very good, added one teaspoon of gluten and used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. Great for a tuna fish sandwich! Kept it in a large ziplock bag and 3 days later it is still very fresh and yummy.

I only had a.p.flour and the result was a disaster.  The loaf is about 1.5ibs. High.  I have a Cuisinart convection bread maker.  Anyone have suggestions, apart from throwing out the machine?  Iris

Great recipe, turned out nice and even.  The only thing I changed is I added a little more water (about 3-4 tbsp.) during the first kneeding cycle because it seemed very dry.  This helped out a lot.

Omg! This recipe is the perfect one for bread machines. Love it! I did substitute butter for the oil and added a little garlic. My husband wants to have it for dinner and skip the soup I made. Thanks for another great recipe!

I don't have a bread machine so I used normal bread making techniques (kneaded, let rest, formed, and let rise till double in the pan.) I also used all-purpose flower as well as a packet of quick rise yeast. I baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for 12-15 minutes until the top was golden brown and it came out awesome. I sliced off a chunk as soon as it was cool enough to handle and was not disappointed, it was nice and soft and tasted great! This is a great recipe for anyone looking to make a single loaf of fresh bread.

This was our first attempt at bread using a bread machine... ever. Recipe was idiot proof (even with help from a 4 year old). Better yet, it turned out as good or better than any more complicated hand made recipies I ever made. A new go to.

And when my bread machine went on strike, I just mixed it by hand and baked. One of the best and simplest recipies I've tried. I don't even have to wait for a day off. It works up in an evening.

Have tried several bread machine recipes and this one is the best. Simple and the bread comes out light, fluffy and soft on the inside. Nice crust on the outside!  Didn't change a thing about the recipe. We loved it! I think my search is over :)

I love this bread! So simple to make. I made one for my sister, and they loved it. The only thing I did different is I used 3 tablespoons of canola oil instead of the vegetable oil. The breads you get in the stores now do not taste good to me. I don't buy them. But if your looking for a good bread, this is the one. You will not be dissapointed. I slice mine and then freeze it. I take out what I need and microwave it. It's fantastic!! Oh and I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar. I'm diabetic.

Its a ni e easy recipe. To add a bit more flavor try substituting beer for the water and butter for the oil.  Make sure to warm up the beer first and melt the butter.  The bread tends to rise more, so I also recommend baking down to 1-1/2 tsp of yeast.

This was my first attempt at making bread.  The recipe was easy and the bread turned out light with a good texture.  I used olive oil since I didn't have vegetable oil and it worked just fine.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for posting!

Great basic recipe. I usually use olive oil instead of vegetable. Comes out great and is easy to make.

I am a bread machine novice and this recipe was good tasting, easy to follow, and tolerated me opening the top and trouble shooting a bread machine problem well. I put more yeast than the recipe called for, about 5 teaspoons, and more salt, about 2 teaspoons, and accidentally put too much oil in it. It tastes good. I would go so far as to say that this recipe tastes better than store bought white bread. I will be making this recipe again.

i joined this site just to add this review, this is only my second attempt at bread making in the bread machine, the first recipe I tried had a 5 star review and was said to be light and fluffy by many reviewers, i always read the reviews and comments along with them to see if the success of a recipe is dependent on many alterations or not. Well it failed despite my efforts to follow the suggestions and as well as trying it as it was written, it was dense, to yeasty, the crust was hard, but yet golden and it did not rise also it was tough to swallow bread. This was not the case with this bread, it rose wonderfuly high, it came out soft and fluffy on the inside and nicely browned on the outside but not tough, it also looked like an actual loaf of bread should. My children have devoured half the loaf already and its only been out of the bread machine a half hr. This is now my go to recipe and the best homeade bread I've had in a long time,  tastes just like my grandma used to make by hand. The only alteration I made was to use vegetable oil as that is all I had, and I added one tbs of milk, also I used all purpose ,again all i had on hand, however I do think that if I had not made those few adjustments due to ingredient availability it would have come out perfect anyways. Amazing go to recipe, its practically fool proof. I have never made bread by hand either so I am a true amature if I can make perfect bread anybody can. Thanks so much for the submission.

Better than the recipe I've been using for the past 5 years!  Lighter than most bread machine bread. I add 2 tsp of vital gluten to make it fluffier, but it doesn't seem to even need it.

my bread machine has never made good bread for me, I only use it to knead dough and then remove it for baking. this recipe was great! only things I did differently were I used olive oil and all purpose flour, still came out great.

Very simple yet very delicious!  I've made it as the recipe is only baked in the oven. I've also made it with all purpose flour when I was out of bread flour with good results. Recently I've started adding in things (the other comments really have great ideas).  Today I did olive oil instead of veg and Italian seasoning and it looks and smells amazing. Next I thinking I'll do garlic and cheese.  So not only is it great just the way it is but it makes a great starting point for other breads.

This recipe is great! I'd never even used a bread machine before, so was a bit anxious, but it is an absolutely wonderful way to get home made bread without having to be home to punch it down, etc etc etc.  Tastes wonderful!

I like this bread, but I find I have to drop out a half teaspoon of salt and it comes out better in my opinion.

There is a lot of "tweaking" you can do to really change up the flavor and texture of this bread with available ingredients. I live near people with bees so I can get honey and substitute that for the processed sugar, just cut back a little on the water. Since I also know someone with a dairy I've substituted a little cream for water, and a little home made butter instead of processed oil. I've made bread with this from food grown within 50 miles of me and it still tasted AMAZING. A great start to play with.

Made the bread exactly as recipe indicated. The bread turned out fine, good color, texture, but tasted like store-bought bread. I was so looking forward to that homemade bread taste and I'm disappointed. This bread is good if you like store bought, if you're looking for the good homemade taste, try a different recipe.

Followed the recipe to a t (which is not like me!) and it came out great! I made honey butter, another recipe from this site, to spread on the bread afterward. My mom said this was the best bread she has ever had. The family loved it! I made toast with what little leftovers there were the next day.

I've used brown sugar when I was out of white and butter when I was out of oil, still turns out great. Now I normally use butter in place of oil and sub 1/2 cup wheat flour. Usually have to add about 2 table spoons water to get the dough lookin' good.

This is a great bread recipe for the bread machine.  I use two cups of AP flour and one cup of white whole wheat flour instead of bread flour.  This is delicious bread and is excellent for french toast.

This was the first loaf of bread I've ever made, and it was absolutely perfect. I was nervous because I read that active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water but I just dumped everything in (actually, my toddler did) like the recipe called for and had no problems. It's soft and chewy and light and thick in all the right ways!

I also used all purpose flour. I used the light crust setting and it turned out great.  I would recommend it to anyone and definately will make it again.

I substituted the bread flour with all wheat. Turned out good. It is a little more dry from the rest of the breads I have made.

Easy and works very well. I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour, no sugar, and also used canola oil. My machine uses a five hour whole wheat setting and the bread was lovely. Thanks for sharing!

Great basic recipe.  I wanted something easy, but everything I saw used a bread machine!  So, I went and got one yesterday (second hand for $5!), and gave this recipe a try.  The first loaf I did on the basic setting, medium crust, and it came out a bit dense and the crust was very thick, but it tasted fantastic dipped in cheddar broccoli soup!  I'm working on two loaves right now, one is rising on the counter and the other one is on the dough setting of the breadmaker.  They look and smell delicious, I can't wait to have them with lunch (cheese fondue with the neighbor!).  I used all purpose flour in all 3 recipes, it's what I have on me, but added wheat glutin to the second two loaves. Also, for the one rising on the counter, I added a pinch of powdered garlic, powdered onion, and italian seasoning.

5 stars doesn't do this recipe justice.  I have made hundreds of loaves of white bread but it wasn't until I made this one that everyone in my family raved.  I didn't have bread flour so I just used regular flour.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  I have never tasted such a light fluffy white bread, ever.

Using the exact ingredients I made the dough in my bread machine, then took it out at the end of kneading and let it rise, then formed a loaf, another rise, and bake. It made a HUGE loaf and it was absolutely wonderful. Will definitely make this again. Like to use the bread machine to make the dough while I'm doing other stuff.

Started this out in the bread machine but had to stop when our power went out. So I put it in a loaf pan and let it rise for about an extra hr til the power came bk on and baked it in the oven. It was AWESOME! I have never had any luck with bread from the oven but this was the best ever!!!!

Easy and delicious!  My first really successful for the whole family bread recipe.  I love to cook but baking isn't my thang.  This is sooooo easy. I use all purpose flour and it's gone in 2 days!  My daughter begs for it!  AND it's delicious toasted with butter.

This was the first bread I made in my new machine and our family of four devoured it in less than 24 hours!  Definitely a keeper!  The only change I made was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Delicious!    I follow the recipe exactly, except that I used 50/50 white bread flour & whole wheat all purpose flour.  I put it through the dough cycle on my bread machine, took it out and put it in a metal bread pan and let it rise for another 30 minutes.  Baked in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes and it turned out perfectly!  Agreed, it is a plain bread and snot busting with flavours - but it's a fantastic basic bread that's soft and moist with a perfectly crispy crust.  I will definitely be making again!

There is no recipe easier, soft and fresh as this one!  My loaf was about 6 to 7 inches high and as soft and light as anything. Absolutely loved this one.  I am going to try a whole white flour next and later some other variations, just playing with flavor. Thanks for sharing Diana!

After storing the Bread Machine for 3 years I decided to try this recipe before giving up on homemade bread completely!  It's New Years Eve and fresh bread would be ideal so I went for it! WARNING: It was so GREAT my husband and I couldn't stop eating it and tomorrow I will work those calories off. Happy New Year!

I just got my bread machine and this is the first bread recipe I've tried.  I must say the results were fantastic. My brother in law came to visit just as we were having dinner.  Both him and my husband were amazed by how soft and tasty the bread was.  They wanted to know where I bought it.  I made a few adjustments.  I used all purpose flour (it's all I had) brown sugar instead of white, canola oil instead of vegetable and 1 1/2 tsp of yeast. The results were great!

Easy, simple and tasty.  Makes great toast.  I set my machine for a 1 1/2 pound loaf and set it for "light".  This is my go-to bread recipe.

I made this recipe following it to a T. I used it as homemade stuffing (after drying in the oven) and it was wonderful. Next year I will use Olive oil and mix in the stuffing herbs in the bead as another reviewer used.

This bread is so good but I have to say I love it even more since I tweaked the recipe just a bit. I add a squeeze of honey and also because this makes it a bit more wet a touch more flour about a tablespoon. I also add split the oil between mild extra virgin olive oil and canola. I feel like it gives it a clean taste. My family loves this bread for their sandwiches, especially a pb&j.

I am looking forward to making this bread, however, I scaled it down to 6 servings, as I will be making it in my "Just for Dinner" bread machine.  Will let you all know how it turns out.

Used this recipes twice, first time the loaf was a little flat and doughy... second time, I reduced the flour by 1/8th of a cup and then sprinkled in a little of that 1/8th to keep the dough from sticking to the sides as it mixed.  Second time, bread was fluffy and perfect to the taste.  Enjoyed it, with a slight modification.

It tasted very nice. There was something a little off about it that I'm not sure wasn't my substituting Olive Oil for the vegatable oil. Other then that, this is a wonderful and easy recipe for bread.

The bread looks beautiful but my daughter and I both thought there was something missing...the flavor was a little flat.

I love this recipe. The bread comes out much much lighter than other recipes and the crust is great. Don't worry about adding the yeast to the water. It goes against the norm for bread machines but it works perfectly.

I forgot to add the salt and i was still pleased with this bread.  Nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be.  My favorite part was the crust, which i'm not usually a big fan of.  This crust was crispy without being hard.  Very nice.  I will use this one again

SO easy and delicious!! I had nearly given up on finding a basic white bread for the bread machine that I wouldn't ruin. Oddly enough I always have success with specialty breads but struggled to make basic white.. until now! Try this out you won't be dissapointed. Thanks Diana

This was my first time successfully baking with my newly aquired bread maker. I did not have the directions so I "winged" it. This recipe was a great place to start using the bread maker. The next time, I will be looking for some additional flavor.

I've been using this recipe for 6 months and realized I'd never rated it. This is my go-to bread recipe. I love that it doesn't need the powdered milk. The only thing I change is adding alittle extra sugar.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used the bread machine to mix the dough, took it out and placed in a bread pan, let it rise for about 20 to 30 minutes and baked it in the oven, as my husband doesn't think it looks like a loaf of bread when baked in the bread machine.  Hence then he will not eat it.  Wonderful flavor and stays fresh... This is a keeper in my recipe box.

So delicious! Is it bad that I have already consumed half the loaf?=)Light and fluffy! I followed the exact recipe and this bread is perfect. I will just slightly reduce the amount of sugar next loaf as it is a little on the sweet side for sandwiches (that may be because we don't usually use real sugar.) Thanks for the recipe

This turned out very tasty.  My only problem was that it over-rose in my machine and stuck to the top of it.  It wasn't that serious of an issue.  Perhaps, I'll just lower the temp of the water the yeast steeps in.  Other than that... it was great with dinner tonight and I am in the process of turning the rest into bread pudding!  YUM-O!

Great bread!  I set the machine for a 1 lb. loaf, light crust and followed the recipe as directed.  This is an ideal recipe for our family because we're avoiding dairy (allergies, etc.).

Not sure what I did wrong, I followed this recipe, using a sunbeam 5891, 1.5 loaf setting, crust color medium. The bread is too dense. The taste is good, I guess I should have set the crust color to light, because it is too dark to my liking. What did I do to get it so dense? too much flour? not enough yeast? Using SAF yeast, Gold bread flour, sea salt, olive oil, white sugar, please help?

I use olive oil and coarse sea salt, but no other changes.  This is an amazing recipe.  It makes the best peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. yum!  I ran out of bread flour the other day and used 2 cups bread flour and one cup whole wheat.  It was pretty good too, but not as soft.

Just like home-made.  Have made it twice this week, and am putting it on delay for tomorrow morning.  Yum!!! 375 for 30 min (I'll try that for baking in the oven and edit if different).

I scaled this up to 16 servings to use 4 C of flour and make a 2 lb loaf in my Zo. At that, I still had to increase the sugar to 5 T of sugar (from 4) and the yeast to 3.5 tsp (from 3) as well as adding 2 T vital gluten to obtain the necessary rise. With those tweaks and using milk / unsalted butter rather than water / veg oil, this will be our white bread recipe until I find something better. Very nice flavor and consistency.

The flavor is very good but I made it twince and it gets so big it touches the top of my bread machine. I have a Breadman so you just have to be careful when you are taking it out that the handle does not get caught in the loaf.

Absolutely perfect in appearance, texture, and taste!  I'm a novice bread-maker, and hadn't used my bread machine in years until today.  As it would happen, during the initial kneading cycle, I found that it no longer works.. so I dumped out the dough, kneaded in by hand, let it sit in a barely warm oven until it doubled, kneaded it again, and baked it at 350 degrees for about 28 minutes.  I was thrilled at the results.  I feel like a skilled breadmaker, thanks to this recipe! If I can do it, anybody can. ;-)

The first loaf from my bread machine that turned out with a nice soft crust!!  I used olive oil instead of veg oil and threw in about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese because my husband adds cheese to everything.  It was delicious!!!

The bread came out moist and the crust was the perfect chewiness that we like.  Went really well with Apple butter and butter. I did bake it on the light setting of the bread machine and it turned out perfect.  I am making up a bunch to freeze for future use.

Excellent Recipe, this is excatly what i was looking for. I made a few changes, I used 2 3/4 cups of flour and an 1.5 tsp of yeast. It turned out great, soft and moist on the inside and crispy crust.

This is a very basic white bread recipe, but it turned out really well. It was the first time I baked bread in my bread machine rather than just using the dough setting and baking it in the oven, and it was fine without all the extra work. I followed all the measurements exactly, and I didn't find it too sweet at all. It was incredibly light and airy, though a little too tall for its original purpose (regular pb&j sandwiches), but perhaps I'm just too used to the size of the store variety. It also lasted several days on the countertop without becoming too hard or dense. Overall, I would recommend this to someone looking for a basic bread recipe.

Very good! Undoubtedly easy to make. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. It wasn't the highest loaf ever but is nice and soft inside. It had a fairly sweet taste to it though, could probably do to have a bit less sugar.

I have used many different bread recipes in my bread machine. This bread not only looked GREAT but also tasted GREAT!! The crust was so soft!!! I highly recommend this recipe if you like a tasty bread with a soft crust.

I have tried this recipe several times. All of them very very good and gone very fast. I add poppyseed or various nuts or sunflower seed. Simple, fast and easy.

Easy to make, but nothing special to eat.
