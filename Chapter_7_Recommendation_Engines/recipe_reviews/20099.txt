This recipe was a lot more work than it originally seemed. The thick cut bacon burned before the cheese melted and the shrimp cooked throughly.

These are a bit time consuming, but they're well worth the effort! My friends just love these. I've made them along with grilled steak and chicken, which I'll have leftovers of. But, very rarely are there any of these great, rich, spicy shrimp! Very good!

Had no bacon on hand so skipped that part along with the seasoning stuff. I used a smoked bacon cheddar cheese ball and cut thin slices to go with the thin slices of jalapeno. Along with some mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, sweet yellow onion and bell pepper strips, these were the most amazing kabobs ever. I mixed up some Chablis with virgin olive oil, lemon juice and one of those italian spice grinders to baste the kabobs with. You would never believe how quickly these disappeared!

These shrimp are delicious !!  We added cajun spices to the shrimp before wrapping just for a little extra heat.  Also, heeding other reviewer's advice, I cooked the bacon 1/2 way before wrapping it on the shrimp.  Doing it this way, the shrimp didn't overcook on the grill.  This is a new grilling staple for us - Thanks so much for the great recipe !!

This reccipe is a little time consuming, but one of my friends gave it 67 stars.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing that I changed based upon previous reviews wass to use a thinner cut of bacon, and bake for about 15 minutes at 400.  I then turned over the shrimp, poured out the fat and cheese that had accumulated on the pan and broiled for the last 7 or 8 minutes.  Perfection.  Than you so mmuch for posting the recipe.

I precooked the bacon a little bit and put these on a sheet of aluminum foil on the grill on indirect heat. They were harder than I thought to put together and did take some time but once you got in the rhythm it wasn't so bad. Tasted wonderful!

This was good, but next time I will not use thick bacon because the shrimp were over cooked.  I will also try it with green chili peppers.

I would rate this as ...ok. I made this recipe along with two other " shrimp-on-a-stick" recipes for a dinner party. These guys lingered while the others did not. Just missing ...something?

Great recipe.  Used a habenero, but would advise against it.  I also used turkey bacon and it tasted just as good

I used thinner sliced bacon and I cooked it for a bit and then wrapped my shrimp, cheese and jalapeño strip. I didn’t butterfly and it worked fine. I used an air fryer for 4 min and they turned out great. My only suggestion would be to maybe cook the jalapeño strips too if you plan to do air fryer bc they don’t get soft enough in that short amount of time. My husband is allergic to shrimp so I did chicken for him and 12 min in air fryer and PERFECTION!

I used 14-16 count shrimp.  Unless you are using giant prawns, these are nearly impossible to stuff and hold together while grilling.

This is tasty for sure....but very time-consuming because I butterflied all the shrimp myself first...and then had to do all the wrapping. I finally just stopped trying to stuff the pepper and cheese because it wasn't exactly stuffin' well. So I just wrapped everything in the bacon. I think if I made them again, I'd not even butterfly the shrimp. Also, one other thing -- I followed another lady's advice to cook for 15 or so min and then broil them. I'm not sure when it happened, but most of my cheese melted & ran out of the wrapped area. I was disappointed in that.
.
But again, the taste of all of these flavors together is great!

Use cream cheese instead of cheddar..SO much better. Also, thick cut bacon is great but not necessary. Wrap regular or thin bacon a couple times around the jalepeno and secure with a tooth pick. BBQ, bake, or fry them. Any of those ways is great.
