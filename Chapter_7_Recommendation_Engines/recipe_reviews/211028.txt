This was amazingy simple.  I think if it's your first time making lasagna and you're looking for something simple.... this is it.  Get creative next time once you get the hang of it.

Easy is so true. I used this recipe as a reference as to the basics and changed the flavoring by substituting a half pound of spicy italian sausage meat along with the ground beef. I also saw in the notes that the recipe does not call for enough sauce so I added another 13 ounces of sauce and that was perfect. Also if you are a cheese lover you can easily add or modify the cheese amounts. I for instance used more mozzarella and put that on top of my lasagna instead of the parm they call for.

I haven't made Lasagna in a LONG time, i found this one, and my kids and hubby LOVED it.  I did changge some stuff, like when i cooked the meat, i added Thyme, oregano, and basil.  I also substituted cottage cheese for the ricota, ricota is too dry, I didn't put the eggs in either, and used the no boil noodles.  I also only baked it 30 minutes. texas toast on the side.... It was delicious!!!!!

Absolute 5 for the simplicity alone!  Family loved it.  I used Bob Jones sausage instead of ground beef just because it has more flavor, and I'm a fan of Maria Batalli's spaghetti sauce so I used 2 jars of that instead.  I also used the no boil noodles, probally needs 10 extra minutes because of that.

My husband and children loved this recipe, but I did not care for it.  So, I am going to rate this recipe 3 stars.  Don't worry, it is something that I will remake for my family.

This recipe is soooo great--the only change I made was that I added another 1/2 jar of sauce and a few jalapeno slices for some extra spice!

My first time making lasagna and it came out great. I used a smaller pan because it needed more sauce. Might double it next time and add some peppers and onion. Served with garlic bread and red wine, loved it!

I make this Lasagna all the time.  My family loves it!  The thing I like best is unlike other Lasagna recipes this one stays all together when you cut it up and does not turn into a big puddle... most Lasagna only stay together after they have spent a day in the fridge this one is good right out of the oven.

This is a great basic, quick & easy recipe.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper,  and oregano to the meat while browning it to add some flavor.  Next time I will add sauted chopped onions and mushrooms to the meat sauce.  A winner recipe!

I absolutely loved this Lasagna... the only problem was that there wasn't enough sauce. I am 13 and was cooking lasagna for the first time. During diner, I got many compliments on it. It was really easy to make and will not hesitate to make it again!

The taste was excellent...I used Ragu sauce with tomatoes, garlic and onions instead of the one in the recipie, and that added flavor to it...the only thing is that I got short on sauce, so for the top I had to add plain spaguetti sauce, but still was very yummy. Super easy to make too.

Pretty good for a beginner lasagna. I used more meat and more sauce. Added mozzarella cheese on top with the Parmesan.

I gave this four stars for simplicity however I'm not sure how you make 1lb of hamburger go as far as 3-4 layers in a 9x13 pan?!?! I used 2 lbs of gb and still had difficulty making it last for only 3 layers, maybe I'm being too generous but I kinda think a layer should be a layer not skimping on the ingredients! i ended up topping the last set of noodles with just plain Ragu sauce. It's still in the oven so I can't comment on taste but my family loves and eats Ragu with our spaghetti all the time so I'm sure taste won't be an issue... I would recommend maybe a smaller pan and an extra pound of ground beef, other than that great, simple, tasty recipe! (We ate supper before I finished writing my review so I can truly say that it is tasty now :-)

Basic, very basic but very easy. It was good for the kids because it didn't have any more spices then the pasta.
