I used a graham-cracker crust and that was good. We liked the bottom chocolate layer but didn't care for the top part made with the egg whites. It wasn't bad but the remaining custard didn't seem to have much effect on the flavor of the egg whites. Instant vanilla pudding made a better (and simpler) topping choice in my opinion.
