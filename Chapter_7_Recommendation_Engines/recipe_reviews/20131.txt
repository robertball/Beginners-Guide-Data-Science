This recipe makes me feel warm all over! Nothing goes better with rum than coconut and pineapple (except maybe ginger ale!) If you don't have fresh coconut pineapple juice, you could always use frozen, or mix together some from a can. This is drink is so good, it makes me want to HOLLER!

Even using canned juices, I felt like I was on an island, mon.  So easy, yet so good.

I've been making this drink for years. Just the thing to have on a hot day while BBQing. Using the Dole premade juices are just as good. The only thing that I do different that makes this even better is to use Malibu Rum, which is coconut flavored. Way yummy!

This is fantastic, and I don't care what they call it as long as I can order it! but while I was in Hawaii I thought this was known as a "Pina Colada"!

Love it. Add a extra ounce of rum and a sprinkle  of fresh nutmeg on top (some add a splash of grenadine too) and you have what call a painkiller!
