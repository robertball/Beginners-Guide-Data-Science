Don't add the asparagus as early as the recipe calls for - it will overcook.  Add it during last few minutes for crisp/tender.  This was quite good.

This was very good.  I actually used pork cutlets because I couldn't find turkey.  I served it over brown rice with a spinach salad.  Tasty and healthy!

This was pretty good. Although I added about a 1/3 cup of water as it was to thick.

Not bad.  Next time I make I will cook the asparagus longer (we thought it was too crunchy per our taste) and not cook the turkey as long because it got a little tough.  Also would double the sauce because there was not enough for the rice.  Very quick meal to make when you need something fast.
