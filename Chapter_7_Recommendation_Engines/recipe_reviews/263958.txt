I really liked these--they are so much better than the banana/egg pancakes. If you're looking for a low-carb pancake, I think this is a much better choice. I didn't use a blender; I just used a whisk and a bowl. They spread and don't have a perfectly round shape, but that's not a problem for me. I thought they were great with a drizzle of honey and a little whipped cream.

They remind me a bit of crepes. I didn't add any sweetner because I prefer my pancakes to be savory.

These are great!  My teenager likes them better than regular pancakes and asks for them all the time:)

Love these!  I topped my with sugar free maple syrup, whipped cream, fresh strawberries and sprinkle of cinnamon.  Nice change from my regular keto breakfast of eggs and bacon.  My teen eats hers with Nutella and rolled up as these are very crepe like.  Really delicious!
