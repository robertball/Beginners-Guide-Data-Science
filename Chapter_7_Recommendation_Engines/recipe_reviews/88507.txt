Nice and spicy, loved it! I halved this recipe for my family of 3. The chorizo gives a smoky flavor. I omitted the salt since the canned tomatoes and chorizo have plenty of sodium already, and didn't miss it. Topped with mozerella. My 2 year old loved it! Perfect for cold weather! Bell peppers would probably work, too.

This was pretty good.  I added 3/4 packet of homemade taco seasoning instead of salt and pepper to give it a little extra flavor.  I put the pasta in uncooked and it cooked up fine in about 15 minutes without adding any extra liquid.

Ok, this was great! BUT YOU HAVE TO COOK THE PASTA BEFORE YOU MIX IT WITH ALL THE OTHER STUFF!!!!!!!!! OR AT LEAST SEMI- COOKED!!!!!! IT DOES NOT COOK LIKE THE RECIPE STATES. With that in mind.......

A big hit with the family! This was VERY easy, quick, and delicious. Even my picky eater enjoyed it. I used grond beef instead of the chorizo sausage, added a can of corn. Instead of using four poblano's, I used two poplano's and two green bell peppers. This was a big hit and EVERYONE said "Mom!!! Make this again!!!" It is delicious with or with out cheddar cheese on top. (This review is based on 8 servings)

Great recipe, making it for the 3rd time tonight! I use kidney beans because I prefer them and bell peppers because I find it hard to fine poblanos.

This was really good! I omitted the mexican oregano since I couldn't find any, the black beans since I don't care for them, and the salt since the chorizo has plenty already. I added 1 seeded, chopped jalapeno for an added kick. My first experience with chorizo sausage and I gotta say, it is really delicious. Good stuff, thank you for the recipe.

Mkay, how do I tell you how I changed this.... not a lot but some... First, I couldn't find pablano peppers so I used pasilla peppers (are they the same? idk), in addition I had a red bell pepper that needed using so I blackened that on up too.
I used whole grain pasta that was 13 oz. so I just used it all. To compensate for the extra pasta, I added a can of rotel and a can of undrained sweet corn (more veggies and color!!!). I skipped the added salt because my chorizo was plenty salty to do the trick.
Since the recipe does not state when to add the chorizo again, I did it at the very end when the pasta was done. Topped it off with a small pinch of Mexican cheese blend and a small dollop of light sour cream.
Pretty healthy if you make sure to drain that chorizo! Tasty too! My 8 year old came up to me and was like, "Mom that dinner was..." , didn't say anything more but puffed up his cheeks, motioned with his hands like his head was blowing up and made an exploding noise.... I said, "What was that? You mean mind blowing?" He said...."Oooohhhh Yeah!" LOL! Silly boy!

Everyone, including my 2 year old loved this recipe.  My husband said he could eat three bowls (but restrained himself).  We'll definitely make this again.

This was different than I thought it would be (not very tomato-y) but the whole family really enjoyed it. Next time I'll add bell pepper.

Made this for dinner tonight with a couple of changes. Fist I used extra lean ground beef in place of the chorizo due to personal taste and the high fat content in the chorizo. I also did not have poblano peppers so I used a can of chopped green chili's and a can of chopped jalepenos instead. Lastly  I added 1 T chili powder and 1t ground cumin to add flavor since I didn't use the chorizo. It turned out pretty good. The hubby have it the thumbs up. I will make this again.

Quite yummy.  Followed recipe exactly (except for throwing in a small can of corn and using regular oregano) and it turned out great!

I made it as stated and loved it. The rest of my family wasn't as keen on it, but they just prefer plain food. This was warm and comforting with a nice spice.

Great recipe idea to start from. I cooked  2 cups of macaroni, drained the grease from the choizo using a strainer into a bowl, substituted  a can of fire roasted green chilies, sprinkled in a liberal dustting of taco seasoning, added a half pound of frozen corn and probably about 2 cups of cheddar cheese but otherwise followed the recipe. The taco seasoning seemed needed for flavor. My grandsons, ages 2 and 7, devoured it.

this was a great base recipe for another one of bf's lunches.. i don't keep poblanos around so i subbed a small green bell pepper for the 2, cut the chorizo and onion in half.. used garlic powder for the fresh.. left out the canned tomatoes.. used 2 cups of our crock pot pinto beans we made overnight for the black beans.. left out the water and cooked the pasta separate (used shells).. didn't add the extra salt.. i believe the dried mex oregano was supposed to be 1/2 tsp not 1/2 tbsp (its potent and stronger than regular oregano).. i used 2 servings of Fajita Seasoning Recipe (from this site) and added 1/2 cup of salsa.. SO delicious.. i don't think it needs the sour cream or the queso.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: this is such an adaptable recipe for what you have laying around the kitchen.. i subbed a can of corn for the peppers and chopped up pork loin for the chorizo.. added a can of El Pato.. doubled the Fajita Seasoning.. and used the canned black beans this time.. this is a great base recipe.. ty again for submitting

Very good recipe. The only change I made was to substitute frozen chopped poblanos for the fresh. Saving two steps and some time.

This was more time consuming than I thought it would be, so that is why it has 4 stars. I used soy sausage to make it vegetarian. I didn't have mexican oregano. It was missing something, so it must have been the oregano. Other than that it was really good. So good that I will make again and again provided that I have the time and maybe some other spices.

I found this quite easy and fairly quick to make. I used poblano's and tom's from my garden and went with soy chorizo. Ultra tasty! IMO, Mexican oregano gives the dish a certain flavor as opposed to regular.
Did anyone else notice that the recipe fails to tell you at what step to add the cooked chorizo??? After it says to "set aside" , it is never mentioned again. Will def make again with a few variations.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used 1 package of Trader Joe's soy-chorizo, and ta-da it's vegan! I also added a can of corn and some cumin. Oh and if you have a toaster oven, broil your peppers there, it is much more efficient than heating up the oven. This recipe is really easy and simple to make, and very flavorful with the perfect amount of heat. I've made this multiple times for friends to show that vegan food isn't bland and scary. This is delicious and so easy!

Very time consuming and there could be short cuts but I wont be trying it again. My husband hated it and we love cooking authentic and Mexican style foods. I added cheese and corn to add more flavor and color but still fell short. Wasn't spicy enough added Cheyenne pepper for more heat.

I made this for a banquet and it was pretty good, but it took me quite awhile to make it.  It's certainly not a simple recipe that you can whip up quick.  At least I wasn't able to
