This was super easy to make, so I think 4 stars makes the most sense.  I ran out of cilantro before I made this, so I put some adobo seasoning in the rice with the lime.  Also, I used bulk Italian pork sausage, about 1/4 to 1/3 of a pound.  Really fresh tasting.  The cilantro would be wonderful in this dish.
