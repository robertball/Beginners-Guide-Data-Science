Great!  I served this at my card club last week and it was the hit of the night!  I made it with barley instead of farro and added tangerine sections for color.  Everyone wanted the recipe!

This salad is fantastic. I did not have time to do the 12 hour soak.  I soaked the farro for 2 hours, the recipe turned out just fine.

I used jasmine rice in place of farro.  It needed a tsp or so of olive oil to keep the rice from sticking together, but it had a great look and flavor.  The next time I threw in a few black beans for more protein, and that worked, as well.  Great recipe!

This was wonderful.  I wish I could underline and bold that word.  I made this for a family picnic.  Yes, I did modify but it doesn't substantially alter the recipe.  I only had Quinoa on hand so that replaced Farro.  Truthfully, I'm betting cooked wheat berries would work too.  The other modification was the walnuts.  I replaced them with toasted sliced almonds due to a family food allergy.   Also, I used a Red Apple Balsamic.  I'm sure any type of good quality balsamic would be great.  I forgot to take a picture but I will next time I make it.  This is a keeper.

Loved it! I wasn't sure about the cranberries, but love the little sweetness it adds.  I also didn't have time to soak for 12 hours, but it didn't seem to affect the delicousness! I skipped the parm cheese, and instead sprinkled a little goat cheese on...so so good!

I was a bit hesitant about this, having never cooked or used farro.  However, it was really delicious!  The chewy, nutty texture of the cooked farro was wonderful.  I plan to try it in other dishes.  One caution:  2 cups of uncooked faro makes a whole lot of cooked grain!  So be sure to check servings for this recipe - I wasn't serving a crowd and could have cut the recipe in half.  As other reviewers did, substituted almonds for walnuts and as another Easter dish had asparagus, used haricots vert for the green veggie.  Surprisingly good.  Will share with others.

I am going to give this five stars although I have not tried it yet, it sounds very appealing!  Farro is a wonderful grain and I hope those of you who have not tried it will do so!  It can be found in a health food store, and if not found, I am sure it can be ordered for you.  However, since I did that, I have found that it can be purchased from Amazon in a 3# bag for a more reasonable price per pound.  http://www.amazon.com/Roland-Farro-3-lbs-Bag/dp/B0028VZEJQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1292004253&sr=1-1 However, I went to their website just now and found they are out of it at this time, but you can sign up to be notified when it does come in.  I am sorry for the buildup and the let down!!

I made this for an Easter buffet and it was absolutely wonderful!  Made especially for vegetarians in the group, but everyone loved it so much.  I used faro (rather than substitute for another grain) and am so glad I did.. it is wonderfully nutty and chewy, and holds up really well with the other ingredients.  The leftovers kept well for at least 5 days .. I think it may even have become better as it sat! The only substitution I made was scallions in place of chives (the chives looked terrible at the grocer) and it was perfect.  I will make this again and again..

This was an excellent recipe. I made two minor changes based on that I had. I only had 1 cup of farro, but I kept the other quantities the same, as I like a high proportion of veggies. I had almonds instead of walnuts, and they were great. This is my first time trying farro, and I really like it. It's a lot like barley, and it's very filling. My non-veggie husband really liked this!

Really good! We had a bag of Trader Joe's par-cooked farro, which allowed us to skip the soaking step and cook the grain in 10 minutes--big time-saver. The bag was just shy of 2 cups, so I just followed regular amounts in the rest of the recipe. My  modifications: I toasted the walnuts; I didn't have enough cranberries so used half dried cranberries, half golden raisins; and I didn't have enough parsley so added chopped fresh mint, which was terrific. I used a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. I also completely forgot the Parmesan, but didn't miss it. Perfect side dish--we served it on a bed of watercress with grilled chicken. Oh, and it makes a ton, so I have plenty to bring for lunches during the week.

This was truly inspired! Didn't have farro, but did have kamut (go figure!), which is a good substitute. Beautiful mix of tastes and textures.

This was a real hit at a dinner party.  I did not soak the Farro for 12 hrs. as the recipe stated.  Just boiled according to package directions.  Super easy.

We thought this was pretty good. The only substitution I made was almonds for walnuts. Next time, I would probably cut the cranberries by half. It just made it a little too sweet.

So good! All the ingredients work really well together. This is a good "make on Sunday, eat for lunch all week" dish.  I used pecans instead of walnuts since I a bunch handy.  I also only soaked the farro for a few hours, which was totally fine.

This is a keeper. It was so good. We didn't have asparagus so I used French green beans and feta instead of Parmesan. For the balsamic dressing I did individual servings of 1 T olive oil 1/2 T balsamic vinegar, s & p, and a dash of oregano. Great for lunches, add over green salad etc. thank you!

Tried and Loved!  I have a very picky partner to cook for, and it was a hit. Asking for it again. Going to take to a volunteer meeting, since rarely do you find a dish great at room temp. Even though several steps to prepare worth it for the results.

I never tried farro before but this recipe was great! I used lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar, decreased the amount of Parmesan cheese, and left out the chives because I didn't feel like buying it. The recipe was really easy and makes a good amount, so I can take it for lunches this week at work. I'm so glad I found it!

First time I've tried this grain is with this recipe. It sat in my cupboard forever...until today.  Umm.  I used exact ingredients from this list,but I roasted the veggies.  Cooked grain according to package. Omitted walnuts and parsley. Everything else was perfect. Thanks for recipe.

Just made it my second time.  Great response from guests and taking it to a dinner tonight. Thank you doughgirl8 for what looks like a little spinach. Love a little spinach tossed in initially and then as a bed for the leftovers. Don't be afraid of making too much.  You will love the leftovers for lunch for several days.  It doesn't fade.

Love the variation of textures and the freshness.  I also didn't soak, just washed and cooked x 35 mins 6:2 ratio. I used most of the farro (about 1 cup left over, I just like the slightly heavier concentration of vegetables).  I only very coarsely chopped the whole/half nuts for a good crunch.  Also the asparagus only 2 mins to blanch if thin and up to 3 mins for thick.  I used scallions.  I also probably 1-1/2 the homemade basalmic. This will definitely be a great recipe to add to the potluck repertoire.

Thought about the feta or goat cheese suggestion, I decided I just like the simple fresh flavors playing against each other.  I thought the other cheese might dominate.  I will however try that sometime too.  I am also not sure how much the parmesan cheese adds, but I left it in and enjoy the flavor when I hit it.

Great combination of textures, including the farro which is so soft. Too much parsley - it became the dominant flavor; cut it in half.  I don't think it's necessary to soak the farro - just cook according to the package.

I used pre soaked farro (Trader Joes), frozen asparagus (also TJ), canned tomatoes, frozen parsley and mozzarella cheese (Parmesan was moldy) and this still tasted great!  Can't wait to try it with all the right ingredients.

This salad was a big hit at a recent luncheon.  Trader Joe's has 10 minute farro which saved a lot of time.

Excellent dish. Didn't change anything. Everyone in my family of 4 loved it. I would just suggest people divide the recipe in half if they have a small family. We ended up with tons of leftovers.

I am a huge fan of balsamic vinaigrette, so I really liked this recipe. It would be really good with barley or a similar grain as well.

Yummy! Personal preference - too much parsley! Also, I couldn't find Farro so I substituted Orzo - turned out great! Also, I added more basaltic (almost double) - maybe was necessary due to the orzo sub? Overall a very good recipe. I think it will be very popular this summer at pot lucks!

Very yummy!  What is commonly available, at least in my area, is pearled farro, which doesn't require soaking, and cooks in about 15 minutes or so.  I just followed the directions on the bag of farro.  I, too, left out the cranberries.  I also substituted almonds for the walnuts, because my daughter doesn't like walnuts.  Lots of compliments on this.

Absolutely delicious.  I used green beans instead of the asparagus because that is what I had on hand.  I left out the parm because I completely forgot about it.  Even without, it was fantastic.  I'll be making again for sure.  Thank you for sharing this!

Aside from swapping pecans for walnuts I made this as written and this is SO SO GOOD!!!!  Ooooh what a keeper this is!  I had some farro that I had no idea what to do with and this is the perfect recipe!  I served it as a side when family came for dinner and it was a hit with everyone- it makes a HUGE batch and the leftovers were great too!

I absolutely love this recipe!!!  It turned me on, to farro...yum!  You can totally skip the farro soak...just cook as the pkg. directs you to and you'll be just fine!  I like to season my farro cooking water with cilantro flavored Knorr (omit the extra salt that the farro cooking pkg. says) This product can be found at walmart in the mexican isle. I also add chopped cilantro to the finished dish.  Another addition is to add feta.  The original recipe is fab, you can tweak it easily to suit your taste....but you will absolutely love it as printed above.

liked it.  I made a few adjustments and it came out sweet, which I like.
instead of asparagus, I added 1 cup of cooked frozen mixed veggies(carrots, peas, corn).  I eliminated the parsley & cheese. 

  Everyone liked it and it will be great as a leftover for lunch.

I believe you only have to soak the farro if its not pearlized.  That is all my grocery store sells and it cooks in 20 min.  I made a vegan version with no cheese and it was very good.  Walnuts and cranberries seem to be a very good combination with the nutty farro.

Perfectly understated.  You can combine a variety of veggies to produce a light yet very nutritious side or main course.  I ended up broiling the veggies instead and still turned out great.

I've made this many times over the past couple of years, usually for picnics or pool parties.  Excellent recipe. I have also used pine nuts instead of walnuts, feta instead of Parmesan, and sometimes omit the dried cranberries. No matter what I do, this is always a big hit.

This was a nice combination of flavors. I toasted the walnuts, and used feta for the parm (because I just had the shaker stuff)and used balsamic vinegar *my oops* instead of the dressing but we love balsamic so it worked just grand. Put the cooled salad atop a bed of spinach and all were satisfied! Thank you

Used pearled farro, which cooks in about 20 mins with no soaking.  Did not use any herbs; used balsamic vinaigrette dressing, which had plenty of spice.  Room temp salad, so easy to bring to any event....Love this!

I never soak the farro.  Just cook with chicken broth as per package directions.  Also I didn't have shaved Parmesan the first time and used grated.  Liked it better than the shaved especially for leftovers.

Excellent salad! I've made it 4 times and everyone loves it. I made this salad per the directions except I used farro from the grocery store and it just said to cook it on the stovetop until desired tenderness (took about 40 min). Easy. Also, I didn't have walnuts so used thin-slices almonds. Delicious! A filling salad. Everyone loves the chewy farro.

Excellent! Wanted to try some farro and I'm glad I did it with this recipe. This makes a LOT. I used scallions in place of the chives and parsley. Didn't have cranberries so used dried tart cherries. Really good!

This is truly wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't have cranberries but I wanted to try it so I did and I'm so glad I did!  I've made it two to three times a week.  It's great with grilled chicken or steak or just by itself.

Really terrific dish.  I used quinoa and didn't have chives so substituted green part of green onions.  Look for low-sugar dried cranberries.  I cut the asparagus first, then cooked it - I think that made it easier to cut and left out the toughest ends of the stalks (left about 1/3).  To make it in a hurry, I spread the hot quinoa out on a dinner plate to help it cool quickly.  I used fresh shredded parmesan cheese to give extra rich flavor.  Enjoy!

I liked this.  It was balanced and was a welcomed way to eat whole grains. Especially good with sharp parmesan on top.

I used wheat berry in place of the farro, grilled the asparagus, and used Ken's Lite Raspberry Walnut salad dressing. Delicious. My husband raved about it too!

There's a lot going on in this salad, and all of it is good! I made it once as written. But, because I like my farro a little chewier, on second try I skipped the soaking and simmered it about 12 minutes. I also subbed golden raisins for craisins and omitted the chives, as I didn't have any. Still tasty!

Absolutely delicious...hubs asked to make it part of our regular rotation.  We live in Canada and are able to purchase PC Blue Menu Farro that cooks on about 12 minutes without soaking.  I didn't have walnuts but substituted sunflower seeds hulled.  Absolutely a keeper. Many thanks.

So I had never eaten Farro much less cooked it.  I made it for my family with everything except the parmesan and nuts because of digestive issues.  I added chicken chunks from a rotisserie chicken & served it on a bed of fresh baby spinach.  The next day, I added blueberries & more cranberries & again served it on a bed of fresh spinach.  We liked it so much that I plan to make this for an upcoming potluck.  Thanks for the introduction to farro!

I have a bag of pearled farro from Costco, so I just had to rinse it.  I've made it twice - once with green beans and the other with  the last serving or so from a  frozen broccoli bag.  I used small diced red onion in a lower amount both times (lower amount so the onion doesn't overpower the whole thing) plus toasted pecans as that's what I had on hand and it turns out very, very well.  Honestly, just a side dish you can put about anything into and it will be tasty.

I made this, it turned out Amazing! had to make a couple of small changes due to not having the same cheese. I also used a asigo balsmic vinaigrette; used dried herbs instead of fresh except for chives. I also used low sugar dried cranberries, so happy I did. now I that I have made it my own recipe I will be eating this all the time. BTW I used pearlized farro, no soak time required

Amazing salad!  And you can add a protein to the leftovers and make it a main course.

For the first time the other day I tried faro at a cooking demonstration. I had never heard of it. It kind of reminds me of brown rice, but softer and fluffier. I actually really like the taste. I found this recipe to test it and was surprised by the results. All of the ingredients were so super easy to throw together except the farro. My bag just says cook 30 minutes. This recipe says soak 12 hours and cook almost 1 hour. The wheat really has to be watched as the water either evaporated off or it soaks it up quickly. I am soaking my pot as I am writing this. So, I decided to do a half a recipe to test it. I used half the farro and mixed in the other half of the ingredients. I about halved the walnuts, cranberries, and chives due to personal preference or what I had in the house. I noticed it said balsamic vinaigrette and not vinegar. So, I mixed some up using olive oil and a small pinch of sugar and salt. I also ended up adding an additional 1 Tblsp of olive oil, at the end, due to it looking a little dry. For the tomatoes I just used 3 sliced and quartered roma tomatoes and for the asparagus I used French haricot green beans I cooked in the microwave about 10 minutes and cooled. As all of the ingredients tasted well together and they were easy to put together I may try this in the future with leftover cooked brown rice to save time. My bag says this is a substitute for rice or pasta. Either way, this recipe seems quite healthy and I think it will be well received.
