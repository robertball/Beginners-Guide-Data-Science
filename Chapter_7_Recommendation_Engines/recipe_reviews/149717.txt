Great vegetarian potstickers!  We did fry ours after boiling with peanut&dark sesame oil until light golden brown on either side. Yum!

Not bad, but I also wouldn't be so quick to make them again. Something tastes "off" with the combination of ingredients. I've only ever had edamame dumplings at my favorite Thai restaurant so I could just be used to their preparation. A really great dipping sauce would have made these much more desirable!

These were delicious!  The filling was so easy to make, just dump everything in the food processor.  The longest part is just folding up the won ton wrappers.  Will make again and again.

This was pretty darn good!  We've never tried Edamame before, so this was our first foray into soybeans.  Even my husband liked these.  He said they were pretty darn good and ate 5 himself.  We didn't use any dipping sauce, just the bouillon.  I did make some minor changes to make it a little more healthy.  I changed the sour cream for fat free cottage cheese, with 1 TBS. lemon juice, and 1/6 cup of fat free milk.  I used canola oil since I had not olive oil.  I also added more garlic, more lemon, and more green onions as we like all those flavors.  Overall, a great start to using edamame and to ravioli.

These were quite good, even better the next day.  I am the only one in my house who likes edamame so I cut the recipe in half, but even then put generous portions of the filling in each wrapper so I ended up with about 24.  I only boiled a few tonight, and then a few the next day since it just me eating them.  Still a very good recipe.  Thanks!

Delicious. I halved the amounts of salt and pepper and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It took me longer to fold the wontons than the recipe suggests, but perhaps that's because I'm a wonton novice. It was worth it, nevertheless. I was amazed at how the amount of filling was almost  perfect for the number of wonton wrappers. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Okay, these are delicious, fun and healthy! Dipping sauce anyone?  I dipped mine in soy which was too strong, switched over to a thin teriyaki marinade...better.  This one is a keeper!

These dumplings were awesome! I highly recommend this recipe if you like the taste/flavor of edamame; and yet the other flavors balanced out the edamame so it didn't over-power the taste. This was a very easy recipe with the most time consuming part being the actual assembly of the wontons (but you can't avoid that). Every time I put a spoonful of the mixture into the wonton, I'd grab a spoonful for myself. Instead of the chicken bouillon, I used 2-3 cans of vegetable broth (I'm a vegetarian) and it.

Didn't enjoy these as much as anticipated. The boiled version didn't taste good to me. Will try frying them next time instead.

I love edamame, but the combination of spices and sauces in these dumplings was way too salty for me. These are good if you like very salty things, if not try and avoid.
