This was very good.  I did grill the tomatillos about 8 minutes PER side but that may be due to my grill.  My son said, "I love everything about this!"  My husband said, "The fire roasted tomatillos and the different cheeses make it great!"  This made about 12 enchiladas which filled the 8 x 12 pan.

This was delicious.  Have to say that I am not an avocado fan but loved the creaminess in this dish.  Would be a great quick weeknight dinner with left over rotisserie chicken.  We just loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I did add a little more cheese on top and used Oaxaca cheese instead of the Swiss.  Just because I had it in the house.

I liked, but how do you keep avacados from turning black before serving?

My kids loved this dish. It wasn't too spicy and made great leftovers.
