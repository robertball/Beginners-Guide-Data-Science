This is your basic recipe for stuffed cabbage that always brings me compliments. I bake this recipe in the oven rather than cooking it stove top. I line my pan with the larger cabbage leaves. I also cover the cabbage rolls wtih additional leaves. This way the actual cabbage rolls stay moist and don't get burned. I do parboil my cabbage, cutting a few leaves off at a time as they cook. I do add 1/2 to 3/4 cup tomato juice to the meat. This is something my Polish mother always did. I do make a different sauce. After all the work of making homemade stuffed cabbage rolls, I find it hard to pour tomato soup on top. For one pound of meat, I mix an 8oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 Tablespoon brown sugar, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce. I mix well and pour over cabbage rolls. Sometimes I double the sauce if I want a lot extra. I often serve these with noodles, so it is nice to have plenty of sauce to pour on the noodles.

Because I always read the hint to freeze the cabbage head and the leaves fall right off, I wanted to add my hint too.  I have done both, freeze the cabbage head and boil the cabbage leaves.  My advice is to ONLY freeze the cabbage leaves if you're short on time or you won't eat the cabbage leaves anyway.  This is an old world recipe, a classic and you don't mess with the classics if you don't have to.  By boiling the leaves, your cabbage rolls will turn out tender and edible.  By freezing them, they tend to be rubbery and inedible.  Just a warning to those who might not want to follow this recipe as directed.  It might be a little disappointing to the texture of the finished cabbbage roll.

An easy way to separate the cabbage is to take off the outer leaves making it a manageable size.  Bring a large pot of water to boil then putting the whole cabbage in the water.  Watch how much water you have in the pot because the cabbage will raise the level quite a bit.  Parboil for about 5 or 6 minutes, drain the water & place the cabbage in cold water to stop the cooking.  The leaves come off very well and are pliable to work with.  Hope this helps.

I'm quite certain this recipe would have been great exactly as written, but I did make a few changes to suit our taste. First of all, you can get your cabbage leaves to come apart perfectly by zapping the head of cabbage in the microwave for about 2-1/2 minutes at a time. Just score the core, and you will get full, perfect leaves without any tearing at all. No need to mess with boiling water.
I did not cook the cabbage leaves at all, I just simmered the rolls longer in step 4. With the meatballs, I added an entire cup of rice, garlic powder and closer to 1/4 cup of the prepared sauce. I did not find any reason to secure the cabbage rolls with toothpicks or string; they stayed together just fine seam side down. Being out of tomato soup, I used tomato sauce, but more of it; 3 (8 oz.) cans plus 1/2 cup of water. I also upped the brown sugar and lemon juice to 2 Tbsp. each. I remember my grandma making these when I was a child, and she would always throw  a handful of gingersnaps into her sauce, so I added 4-5 to mine for good measure.
Simmered for about an hour, stirring and basting as directed. This was my first attempt at making these, and they were out of this world. Thanks for the post, Judy... I'll be sharing it with my cooking pals at ourtabletalk.com

This was my first time making stuffed cabbage and I must say, it exceeded my expectations!  For starters, I boiled the whole cabbage head in salted water for 6 minutes and found it very easy to work with. Like others, I added garlic, 1 tbs. of worchestshire sauce, 1 tbs. of lemon juice and 1 tbs. of brown sugar to the meat mixture. I also added onion soup mix to the meat mixture, talk about great flavor. This will be a regular meal in our home, what a hit!!

I made this for dinner tonight.  It certainly was a hit.  I did use spaghetti sauce instead of soup, and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.  Thanks for the recipe:)

This recipe was good but I changed it a little. Instead of tomato soup I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. We love more of a saucier version.

This dish is amazing - just like my Polish "Gram" used to make!  Some details... 1.  Core the cabbage, parboil for around 5 minutes and remove the leaves as they loosen.  2.  Remove all the leaves from the cabbage, and line your roasting pan with some extras, along with cover the tops of your rolls with some extras.  They will burn, but your rolls won't!  3.  Trim the thick vein on the backs of the leaves you plan to roll, and you will not need toothpicks or string.  4.  Buy two cans of tomato soup.  I used one, realized it wasn't enough, had my husband go out and get another, and halfway through the baking time, removed the top leaves, added the other can of soup, then put the top cover leaves back on.  5.  Bake, in a covered roasting pan at 350 degrees for 1.5 hrs.  SO GOOD.  Hope this was helpful!

Recipe is great - however I cannot figure out why people "boil" cabbage leaves in a pan of water!! Takes to long and another big pot to clean up. I just put the leaves in a plastic bag, adds a sprinkle of water and put them in the microwav3 for a minute (more or less, depending on the amount of leaves & size. So fast & easy!

This is exactly how my Polish mother in law made hers with the tomato soup in a large dutch oven in a bigger volume, everything doubled but much more soup, maybe 4 cans at least.  My own Ukrainian mother used crushed tomatoes for the sauce but it might have been the Italian influence of my dad.  Both delicious but a lot of work when using more than 8 leaves of cabbage.  DO NOT DO THE SHORT CUTS OF USING RAW RICE. IT IS MUCH BETTER WITH THE COOKED RICE.  This is Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Hungarian etc comfort food as far as home cooking goes.  They are made without the ground beef at Christmas Eve time.  My husband would always pick off all the cabbage so often I just make the filling into porcupine meatballs with the same sauce. A lot less work but authentic cabbage roll recipe as shown here.  However, I doubt if they used tomato soup in POLAND. Probably that was all the grandmother could find on the shelves here at least in our family.   The reason we always made more than 8 is that it is a lot of work but they go fast....better the next day.  If my memory is correct these are called Golumpki or Golabki or Holubtsi depending on which language they spoke. Sometimes it sounded like Gowumpki.  My mother in law sometimes made them with ground pork in stead of beef but my mom made them with the ground beef.  Stiff cabbage leaves are a no no and hard to wrap around the meat and rice filling.  Use regular white rice, not minute rice.  Yummy.

My Polish Grandmother and Mother use this recipe and always eye-balled the ingredients. It’s nice to have a recipe to follow so I can pass this recipe on to my grandkids!  I have been making this recipe for about 50 years.  Some have said that they supplemented tomato soup with tomato sauce, but that changes the recipe from its Polish origins.    Tomato soup is the traditional sauce.  Also, some have said that the supplemented the tomato soup with a can of water.  My grandmother and mother added a can of tomato juice instead, for every can of tomato soup added to the recipe.  She baked the “Golabki” tightly covered in a 350* oven for at least an hour so that the cabbage could steam and get tender and then uncovered the dish to brown a bit.  We serve this meal with mashed potatoes and cucumbers in sour cream.  The stuffed cabbage rolls are even better the next day!

I made these last evening for Christmas dinner.  (I froze them).  They were delicious!   I added about 1 tble worchester sauce, 2 smashed cloves of garlic, a tble brown sugar & parsley to the meat. I also doubled the recipe using 1 lb ea of ground beef & venison.  I shredded the remaining cabbage & lined the pan with it, topping it with the rolls. To the sauce, I added a can of diced tomatoes, salt, pepper, & a dash of brown sugar.  I also baked them covered @ 350* for 1 1/2 hours.  We each ate 2 for dinner & froze the rest for Christmas dinner!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I've been making a very similar recipe for at least 40 yrs. It was handed down through the family. After all of these years I've learned that steaming the head of cabbage and removing the softened leaves a little at a time is so much less messy and easier to handle. I trim the heavy vein in the cabbage leaf.  I roll and tuck in the edges without using picks or string. I also use tomato sauce with a little sugar. For a little more zest while cooking try topping with sauce, diced tomatoes and sauerkraut before cooking. It makes a great topping  for over your mashed potatoes. I always make mashed potatoes with this dish. I've used the crock pot but I prefer baking them in a roaster pan. This recipe is great for a family dinner, holiday dinner or when having guests. It is always a hit.

Even though I modified this recipe, I still gave if five stars for a few reasons: 1) I only had the cabbage in the boiling water until I could peel off leaves.  This took the most time...waiting for the leaves to fall away from the head of cabbage.  I just started cutting away at the core as needed until I had enough leaves. 2) I used jar sauce!!  I hate to say it...but I have not found a weekend to make REALLY good sauce. 3) I put it all, as recommended in this recipe minus my minor modifications, in the crock pot on low for 8.5 hours....it was the best ever!!  I have made this recipe three times and putting in the crock pot made the best ever cabbage rolls!!!  Will I make this again?  Yes as I did above!!  It is a perfect, simple, easy meal for those of us on the go!!!  Love it!!

I have made this recipe for over 50 years.  It is from the Campbell's Soup Recipe book I got from Campbell's when I was first married by sending in soup labels.  The submitter may not know where she got this from but probably her grandmother got it either from the book or on a soup label. Campbell's has "deconstructed" this recipe on their site and this version is no longer available. Do not substitute for the soup. Campbell's kitchen created and tested this recipe and it won't have the same flavor.

Great recipe and I follow the suggestions from another reviewer. Line the pan with the larger cabbage leaves and cover the cabbage rolls with additional leaves. This way the actual cabbage rolls stay moist and don't get burned. Parboil the cabbage, cutting a few leaves off at a time as they cook. Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup tomato juice to the meat. Make a different sauce. For one pound of meat, I mix an 8oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 Tablespoon brown sugar, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce. Mix well and pour over cabbage rolls. Double the sauce if desired and serve with noodles. Bake in the oven rather than cooking it stove top.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.   My Polish family made similar rolls.  The difference was in the sauce. The cored cabbage is micro steamed  in a wet towel.  Keep removing leaves as the soften.  Leaves that are not used for rolls, are coarsely chopped and make a bed for the rolls.  Cover the rolls with  thinly sliced onion and a sauce made of a can of tomato soup with 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon vinegar mixed with the soup.

While this is a recipe that's always prepared to one's own tastes and everyone likes it their way, our family traditionally leaves out the tomatoe and just simmers the prepared rolls in water and broth/boullion.  Then we fry them in butter so the cabbage leaves carmelize and serve.  DELICIOUS!   I also use the entire cabbage and increase all the other ingredients so everyone gets to bring home a portion to eat the next day!

This turned out great.  I did use some of the others tips.  I baked in oven at 350 for 40 min, made my own sauce as was suggested by another member (8oz can of tomato sauce, tblsp brown sugar, tsp worcestershire sauce and tblspn lemon juice, and a bit of salt/pepper) poured over rolls and put loose cabbage leaves on top so they didn't dry out...they were great!  Will make again.

This is the recipe that my family has passed down for generation after generation. The best way to do the cabbage is to cut deep around the core and then place the whole head in a pan of boiling water. Be careful not to fill the pan with too much water because the weight of the cabbage will cause it to over flow. Swirl the head around and the leaves will fall right off. Drain on paper towels. I do not cook the rice ahead.. it will cook in the rolls. I also add some garlic powder to the meat mixture and to the sauce also. I also add a can of tomatoe sauce with the tomato soup and one can of water. I cook mine in a stock pot for about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. These freeze really well also. Serve with mashed potatoes and corn... Great authentic polish recipe!!

In the 'old world' country I came from, this is one of the best traditional winter dishes and a 'must have' for Christmas dinner. And because in the past nobody had fresh cabage on hand during the winter months, the ground meat (almost always pork) was rolled in SOUR cabbage leaves. Yes, every fall, whole cabbages were stacked in large wooden barrels and brinned for weeks in salty water. Here, in U.S., I had to adapt my recipe in order to get the same final taste. I always boil and/or bake the stuffed rolls on a bed of shredded sour cabbage (one large can), briefly rinsed in cold water and sauteed for 10 minutes with chopped red and green peppers, 1/2 pack of chopped bacon (or any other smoked meat or smoked saussages) and 2 cups of diced tomatoes. All cabbage rolls in the world will taste good but if you try this variation, you will see the big difference. I know that the sour cabbage does not seem too...appetizing to many people, but the end product is amazing.

Recipe is great, but instead of using tomato sauce or soup, I use a small can of tomato paste and mix it well with 5 cans of water, season it with salt, pepper, sugar, ketchup and onion powder.  This is the way my mom taught me and she came from a long line of Polish cooks.  SusieQ

Being polish we make these alot.  A few suggestions: To get the cababge leaves, core the whole cabbage and add to the boilig water, you can then pull off the outer leaves as they soften much easier.  Also we trim off the heavy vein on the cabbage leaf, then you can roll the leaves with out using toothpicks.

My polish mother taught me to make these many years ago.  The only thing that we do different is to top the roaster full of pigs with strips of bacon.  Why any solvanians would give this good old fashion polish recipe a bad review without even trying them is beyond me.  Plus, neither of my polish grandparents would ever use veal.    Cows were too precious to them to kill them before they even had a chance to grow up.

This recipe was great! I did use another reviewers advice though. I lined my casserole dish with the extra cabbage leaves. Instead of tomato soup, used tomato sauce. To cover the cabbage rolls I used, as suggested by another the following: For every 1lb of beef- 8oz of tomato sauce, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tsp worcestershire sauce. I then covered the dish with more cabbage leaves and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. It was delicious! I had to make more of the same sauce mixture to pour over the cabbage rolls just before serving at the request of my husband. He loved it! I will definately use this recipe again!

A quick hint for an easy way to remove cabbage leaves.  Put a cabbage in the freezer for a few weeks (or just keep one in there!)  When thawed, they come off very easily and are ready to roll!

Your rolls will be best with a combination of beef and pork (and veal if you can get it).  Use al dente rice -- soft enough to eat but able to soak up the meat juices while baking.  The sauce takes years of trial and error to FIT YOUR TASTE!  Both of my parents were Polish, so both had two sets of golabki sauces from their parents, so now I have four from which to choose as my favorite.  I prefer paternal grandmother's: tomato soup with dried mushrooms and a sprinkle of vinegar! But maternal dziadzia's tomato paste in broth with sauerkraut is equally to my liking! So many variations!  But keep the cabbage fresh, the sauce thick as a good gravy to pour over mashed potatoes, and the meat tender, juicy and flavorful.

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!! So good. I added garlic --- 1 Tblsp Worchestshire Sauce --- 1 Tblsp lemon juice --- 1 Tblsp brown sugar --- packet of onion soup mixture --- and finely chopped cabbage in the meat. Also, I made meatballs because of the extra meat. Boiled cabbage first, filled with meat, and used a crockpot set on high for 4 hours. Next time I'll have to boil the cabbage longer because it didn't seperate as easily as I thought it would. Also, I would use diced tomato with tomato sauce because the tomato paste and tomato sauce mixture I used was WAY TO MUCH TOMATO!!!

As so many other reviewers I grew up with my mom making this. We do freeze our cabbage first with great success. I also pre cook the rice because it does draw moisture out of the meat. Also try adding a package of saurkraut (sp?) Half the bag on the bottom and half covering the cabbage rolls, then pour a large can of tomato juice over it in a slow cooker. Hmmm...so satisfying!!!

The fastest way I've found to cook my cabbage leaves is in the microwave.  Peel off as many leaves as you need, layer high in a deep microwave dish with some water in the bottom of the dish, cover with a paper towel and microwave for 3 minutes.  Leaves will be plenty soft for wrapping.  I always add some red wine vinegar and brown sugar to my tomato sauce.  Pretty much in equal amounts and according to taste.

My family is Russian and we have cooked stuffed cabbage rolls for many years. A few small tips: use chicken broth to braise the rolls in for a much richer taste. If you have time, add sauteed onion, carrots,tomatoes and bell peppers with a tsp. of tomato paste to the braising sauce. Add ground pork to the ground beef, enrich the stuffing with minced garlic and chopped onion ( I also sautee it for a better taste). Braise it just for 20 minutes, lest it overcooks. Enjoy

I've been using this recipe for 20 years.  When my kids were little I called them "space burgers"--they would NEVER eat cabbage!!  They loved the space burgers though and never knew they were cabbage rolls.  The only thing I add is a small can of drained corn and use uncooked minute rice.  It also helps to put leftover leaves on the top and the bottom of your crockpot or baking dish.

This was my first time making this dish and call me stupid, but I did not realize that you added the meat mixture raw instead of cooking it first. The recipe does not indicate either way. By the time I figured it out I was too deep into it and did not want to toss out five bucks of beef. So I detoured and prepared a different dish. Please be as clear as possible when posting a recipe as some of us are still learning.

Great recipe!!  By just adding more of the existing ingredients, I was able to make a FREEZER MEAL for not much more cost.  I added more rice and ground beef and pealed down the 1 head of cabbage as far as I could (approx 22 leaves).  I doubled up the small ones to make a larger leaf and used those "not-so-pretty" ones for tonights dinner.  I placed the stuffed large "pretty" leaves on an oiled cookie sheet and placed it in the freezer for 2+ hrs.  Place the individual frozen rolls in freezer bags that have the directions (add tom. sauce and simmer) on the bag.  Use them as single servings if needed!  Perfect way to make meals for smaller households.

This is an excellent recipe. I have been making it for years passed down from my grandmother. I have learned if you use minute rice you don't have to cook it first.

Easy way to prepare cabbage leaves for rolling (Microwave Technique):
Remove the core from the head of cabbage.  
Place cabbage, uncovered, in microwave-able dish and place in microwave oven.  
Cook on HIGH for 10-15 minutes.  (Cooking time will vary depending on power of microwave oven and size of cabbage head.)  
Allow cabbage to cool before handling.

This is GREAT and my 1st attempt at making cabbage rolls!!! My boyfriend had to have them the next night as leftovers and he NEVER wants the same thing 2 nights in a row!!! I made 1/2 of the recipe which completely filled a 13x9 Pyrex dish, topped with sauce and baked for about 2hrs at 350 covered with foil so I wouldn't have to worry about the rolls breaking apart in the pot. PERFECT!

I tried to microwave the cabbage instead of boiling it as suggested by other reviewers which left the cabbage far too crisp. I also tried baking as suggested which didn't work for me either. Adding a small can of tomato sauce to the filling made the filling more flavorful. In the future I may try using the extra large can of tomato soup as there did not seem to be enough sauce to cover the rolls. Other than these issues this dish was tasty with pierogis and kraut!

A Ukranian friend who regularly makes cabbage rolls gave me this tip: soften the cabbage by boiling the whole head of cabbage in a stockpot.  Have the stem end sticking up and as the leaves soften cut each one off using a sharp knife and lay onto a paper towel to cool.  It's easy and works great!  To the tomato soup I added a can of diced tomatoes to make it more "saucier".  Instead of all beef, I used meatloaf mix.  Tasty comfort food!!!

It was delicious.  I forgot to add rice into the mixture, so we just had a side of rice to go with it.  I added a Tbsp of lemon juice and a Tbsp of brown sugar. I also added a 8oz can of tomato sauce and added I had some cherry tomatoes that I had on hand. I baked it at about 360 degrees for 35mins covered in foil and the last 5 mins uncovered.

Just a few hints to use, or not, as you see fit.  I've been making cabbage rolls for over 40 years & they are always a big hit.  I got the recipe from a Hungarian lady.  I use a combination of ground beef & ground pork (& ground veal if I can find it) mixed with onions & rice....and lots of Hungarian Sweet Paprika (4-6 Tbls)....depending on how many rolls you are making.  I usually make 20 - 30 rolls at a time.  Also, I use a large can of tomato juice with an equal amt of water, making sure the rolls are covered.  I line the bottom of my roasting pan with coarsely chopped cabbage leaves & cover the top of the rolls with more cabbage leaves.  Some use sauerkraut to line the pan & put between the layers & on top of rolls.  I always slowly simmer mine on top of the stove.  The only problem I've had is finding a cabbage with large leaves.  They trim them so much in the stores.  I've even had the produce manager save the outer leaves for me.   An optional ingredient would be to add a couple of dashes of cinnamon in the meat mixture.

i thought this dish was fabulous.  the only changes i made was using ground veggie "meat" instead of the beef, and added a little diced eggplant and red pepper.  the tip on boiling the head of cabbage first saved me!

Great recipe Judy!! Good old fashion meal. Easy to do. I added a teaspoon of Thyme and garlic powder to the meat mixture for more flavor. A keeper in my recipe box at Big Mama's kitchen.

I used this recipe as a base for cabbage rolls. It was my first time making cabbage rolls, and I will definitely make again! I used an entire onion, and I substituted the egg with a can of plain tomato sauce. I followed the top reviewers suggestion and skipped the tomato soup (I don't really like it). Instead I used tomato sauce, lemon juice, and Worcestershire (like recommended), but I also added a splash of red wine, garlic, marjoram, oregano, basil, and a little sugar. I put it in the oven for about 45 minutes and topped it with Parmesan cheese.  I was very impressed with the final result!

This a somewhat similar to the recipe that has been handed down in my family for generations and I have been making for over 40 years. However, I use half ground beef and half ground pork.  I also saute the onion in diced salt pork, then mix in with rice and meat mixture (I don't use an egg).  Have never put any of the tomato soup in mix, just use 2 large cans to pour over cabbage rolls after I layer them in a large roasting pan.  Then I bake for about 3 hours at 325.  This is a standard Christmas recipe at our house since it is very easy to heat up when guests drop by.

This is exactly how my mom used to make stuffed cabbage!  I made it for my dad and sister the other night, and they both agreed.  I used 1-1/2 lbs of meat, made 12 rolls and used 2 "family size" cans of tomato soup (that's the best part).  I cooked it for 8 hours on low in a crock pot.  Served with boiled potatoes.  NOTE:  You can also use a meat mixture of ground beef/pork in a 3:1 ratio.

I never realized how easy it was to make cabbage rolls. My family really enjoyed these.  I did add extra tomato juice to the sauce (to make more of it!) and I added some Worcestershire, white pepper and paprika.  Yum - I really liked what I got!

These were very good!  My only issue is that I think the sauce recipe needed to be doubled.  The sauce was too little.

I always make a double batch.  Always. 
I use half hamburg and half pork.
I followed many suggestions and added (to my double batch) 2 tsp worcestershire, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp brown sugar and 8 oz tomato sauce to the mixture.  I also use about 10.5 oz of tomato sauce plus a half can of water to pour over to rolls.  I put extra leaves on the top and bottom to keep everything moist - I always get 2 heads of cabbage so I can be picky. Baked at 350 for about an hour, and it came out great.  I had never had these and my husband asked me to make them - he said they were just like Mom used to make.  I've made them several times since and the recipe gets a little less precise each time, but still fabulous.

I first started cooking this recipe when I was a beginning cook. Now that I make this for my own family, I make this with brown rice that I've cooked in homemade stock (I've never had good luck with using raw rice, it never cooks fully for me), ground turkey or turkey sausage, I add fresh garlic and I spice up the soup with my own homemade pizza seasoning (basil, oregano, red pepper flake, Splenda brown sugar, fresh ground pepper, sea salt, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, fennel, paprika, little lemon pepper seasoning, parmesan cheese) and sprinkle a little cheese on top before baking, depending what I have on hand. I don't cook mine in a skillet, I've always made this in a baking dish just because that's how Mom did it. This is pure comfort food. NOTE: If you'd rather not use meat, you can sub 8 oz. of chopped veggies in place of the meat. Tomato sauce is a good replacement for the canned soup, if you'd rather not use that as well.

This recipe was really good. I kept the basic recipe, but added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 2 tsp of Worcestershire, and I used one can of tomato soup, but added one cup of spaghetti sauce. I cooked it on high in my crock pot for 4 hours on high. My darling boyfriend loved this recipe, and ate 6 pieces in one setting.

This was a great recipe :) I did change things up a little! I added a little garlic and paprika to the meat mixture. I used a family size can of tomato soup and added a cup of beer to that (my polish grandmother's secret!) i simmered them in that sauce and they tasted delicious!

This was my first attempt at stuffed cabbage rolls.  This recipe was so simple, it gave me the courage to try it.  It was EASY.  I followed the recipe exactly, and put the rolls and soup in the crock pot and cooked them for 8 hours on low.  The sauce and cabbage were very good, but I think next time I will add a little yellow mustard to the beef mixture to spice it up a bit.

We loved them.  I followed one review and added brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worstechire sauce but I just added them to the tomato soup and it was so great.  Thanks for a healthy, easy recipe.  I cooked it in the oven for 25 mintues at 350.

This is very similar to the recipe my Ukrainian Mother used to make her "Holubtsi".  The only difference is that she baked the cabbage rolls in the oven for about an hour at 350 and then added the tomato soup with a little water and baked them for another 30 or so minutes. These rolls would be covered while in the oven.

This is almost the same recipe my family has enjoyed for years.  My mother always fried a couple slices of bacon cut in half crosswise in the pot (a soup pot) before putting the cabbage rolls in.  She also adds a dash of  cayenne pepper to the meat mixture to jazz it up, and another dash to the sauce before serving.  If you add about 1/2 a soupcan of water, you can cover the pot and forget it until it's done.

This is about as easy as it gets for a cabbage roll recipe! I've made it a couple of times and I really love the results. I usually double it (I'm very big on leftovers!) and use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey to lighten it up a wee bit. I also add a pinch of ground nutmeg and a bit of garlic powder to the meat mixture to bring out the eastern european flavor.

So easy and everyone LOVED it. The hardest part was getting the cabbage leaves off in one piece, should have tried some of the suggestions in the ratings. Also, I had some spaghetti sauce that needed to be used up, so I used it instead of the tomato soup. Great as leftovers, too.

Update 2-16: Made it again today and, if you can believe it, I forgot to mix the rice into the meat mixture. I baked the cabbage rolls at 350 for about 25 minutes, and served on top of the rice that I forgot to mix in. I did add garlic and Worchestershire sauce, and we all just loved it again. I also used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup. Delicious!

So Yummy but I hd to figure out that if you keep the head of cabbage whole and boil salted water then submerge the entire cabbage the leaves fall of great! I tweeked the recipe a tad and used brown rice instead of white,added some green bell pepper, garlic chopped, soy sauce and worchester added stewed romas and tomato sauce baked at 400 checking after 45 min.. After I used the original recipe I just personally needed to add my own touch either way both they were delicious!!

I was surprised at how easy this recipe was.  I had never made cabbage rolls before.  This was quick and easy.  The whole family loved it.  My 3 year old has asked if he could have them for his birthday supper next week! I made a few changes: I used a jar of spaghetti sauce (as I had no tomato soup) and cooked them covered in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes. I also added 1/4 cup more rice and a whole onion. Cabbage Leaf tip:  I had a difficult time removing cabbage leaves in one piece so I cut out as much of the core as I could, placed the cabbage in a large pot 3/4covered with water and boiled for 10-15 minutes to soften leaves.  This made it much easier to remove the leaves and softened them at the same time!

Excellent! wonderful recipe - and if you like to add your own special touches - or alter to your tastes try salsa (at your heat level) instead of tomato soup and you can use pre-cooked rice - if you parboil the cabbage - remember though you wouldnt use 1/3 cup rice - you'd have to eyeball the mixture - for my tastes I'd use about a cup of cooked.

Excellent recipe.  This is identical to Polish pigs in the blanket.  It's a bit labor intensive, however.  You may not want to cook this after a long day at work.  Instead, it may be a nice dish to cook over the weekend when you have more time.  I used home made tomato puree instead of tomato soup.  Caned tomato puree is also a good alternative.  With the beef, I added minced garlic, chopped onions and a dash of caraway seeds.  One last tip.  Use cabbage that does not have ruffles in the leaves, common in yellow cabbage.  The ruffles make it difficult to tear the layers apart.  Good luck.

THIS WAS GREAT WITH MY CHANGES.  I MADE THE SAUCE USING  2 CANS TOMATO SAUCE, 1 CAN STEWED TOMATOES, 3 T. BROWN SUGAR,
1 T LEMON JUICE AND 1 TSP WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE.  I USED 1/2 LB. GROUND BEEF AND 1/2 LB. PORK SAUSAGE WHICH I COOKED FIRST SO I COULD POUR OFF THE GREASE. I ADDED 3/4 CUP SAUCE TO THE MEAT MIXTURE ALONG WITH 1 CAN CHOPPED MUSHROOMS AND OTHER INGREDIENTS LISTED. ALSO ADDED SOME FRESH BASIL.
PUT THE ROLLS OVER CABBAGE LINED 9X13 PAN (THIS KEEPS THE ROLLS FROM STICKING).
BAKED IN 350 OVEN TIL HOT AND BUBBLY.

I've never had cabbage rolls before but this is the results of searching for a recipe that uses ground beef and cabbage.  It was really good!!! I also had some ground pork sausage so I mixed that with the beef based on other's comments saying it was kind of bland.  I increased the tomato soup to a large can for more sauce.  I and my friend thought they were great!!!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Update:  I made this for a dinner party with the girls-  three people asked me for the recipe and two already made it within a week!!

A good recipe. I sauteed the onion with some minced garlic before adding to the beef mixture. Instead of tomato soup, I used a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (cutting each in half) adding a few cloves of minced garlic and a pinch of mixed herbs.

I'm shocked that this recipe has so many positive reviews; it's close to flavorless.  I followed the recipe to a T and the end result is a lump of beef wrapped in wet limp cabbage with a hint of processed tomato.  Really disappointed because the ROI was just not there for what ended up being a bit of a process to get the meat mixture wrapped and secured in the cabbage leaves.  2 stars instead of just 1 because it didn't taste bad, it just didn't taste at all.

I've read the recipe and the reviews and found all helpful and delicious sounding. I'd just like to add a 'hint' for those interested. Before rolling the mixture in the leaves I trim the back rib or spine of the leaves. By paring them down they roll up easily and don't split. Happy noshing ladies and gents.

Very basic recipe...lacks much of the hunky flavor that comes with added sauerkraut and various seasonings of the meat, etc.  I disagree with not using the freezer method for the cabbage. This is a HUGE time saver and if you cook the stuffed cabbage rolls on low in a crock pot for at least 8 hours, the cabbage is extremely tender.  Will not use this recipe again just because it lacks flavor.  But it is a great starter recipe for someone who is just starting out.

This would be great the way it is, but intead of 1 lb. of ground beef, I use 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. of sausage. I also pour 1 1/2 cups of vegetable juice into the pan after I put the cabbage rolls in and pour a can of crushed tomatoes over the rolls. Then to add even more color to it, I pour a small can of tomato sauce over the rolls. My family thinks it's a real treat for me to make these!

This turned out pretty good.  I did change a few things though.  Instead of the tomato soup I used 1 can diced tomatoes, 2 cans tomato sauce, worchester sauce, brown sugar and lemon juice.  I also baked at 350 for 1.5hrs.  Still needed some more seasoning though, will season better next time but I really like it!

Pretty good...once I figured out how to take the leaves off the cabbahe head with out ripping them! (I boiled the whole head for 10 mins)
I added LOTS of onion and about 1tbsp garlic powder, salt & pepper too. I also added 2 cans tomato soup & 1 can diced tomatoes and mixe dwith half can of water to make it a little more liquidy so I could baste more.
I used 1.5 pounds lean gr.beef & 1 cup rice, lots of onion & spices and I was able to make about 25 cabbage rolls. Serves 5 in my house! LOL!

I have used this recipe for quite a few years now and always get rave reviews. I add about 3 heaping tablespoonsful of brown sugar and 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice to the soup. I also add worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the meat and rice mixture to kick it up anotch. Yummy

I was afraid this recipe would be bland as written so I added quite a few more seasonings including: 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, ~1/8 tsp paprika, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I also increased the onion to 1/2 cup, used brown rice, and substituted 1 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes and half a jar of spaghetti sauce for the tomato soup.  I cooked in the oven at 350 in 9x13 covered with foil for 50 minutes.

All in all, this was really good, and with my changes it's definitely a 5-star recipe. My husband agreed, so this recipe is a keeper.

No need to pre cook the rice.  Just soak and rinse good and then add to meat mixture.  I add an egg to the meat as well. I add a can of diced tomatoes with the tomato soup.   I add a few strips of bacon over the top of the cabbage rolls...it makes all of the difference in the world.  Good stuff!

Roll and Tuck!! 

To secure the cabbage rolls..using my fingers, I tucked each end of the cabbage roll into the meat mixture to hold things in place. (no need for string/toothpicks using this method)

I love savoy cabbage and find it much easier to handle than regular cabbage. I bring a little water to a boil, add the head of cabbage, simmer it for about 10 to 12 minutes, and take leaves off as they get limp. Savoy cabbage is easy to roll and keeps its shape much better. I beat an egg with about 1/3 cup of milk, added Italian breadcrumbs and some Ritz cracker crumbs, finely diced onion, garlic powder, dried thyme, salt, pepper, a few drops of hot sauce. I cut up some of the cabbage leaves, put them in the bottom of a baking dish, cabbage rolls on top, and then add a 24-oz jar of tomato sauce. Bake in 350 oven for at least 1-1/2 hours. Sooo good. I always look to allrecipes.com for recipe ideas but usually change them slightly.

I changed this recipe a bit myself.  I browned the meat (I used ground turkey) with a small diced onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 tbsp of dried oregano and 3 tbsp of fresh parsley.  After I drained the meat mixture I added a can of tomato paste and simmered for 3 minutes.  I then added the rice and removed from the heat.  While that was cooling I blanched the cabbage 10 cabbage leaves - I did a couple extra in case some of them split before stuffing.  Stuff the cabbage leaves and place seam side down in 13X9 baking dish.  Top with tomato soup and bake in preheated 375 oven for 30 minutes.

I am just learning how to cook, and this was my first attempt at stuffed cabbages. For someone who does not have much experience in cooking, I was nervous. However, this recipe was easy to follow and tasted really yummy when finished. I rolled my cabbages the night before and combined everything before I went to work. I cooked them all day on low and they were wonderful. I also added a touch of tomato juice and brown sugar. I will probably use this recipe for the rest of my life. I recommend this recipe to anyone, especially if it is there first attempt making stuffed cabbages. Thanks for sharing!

"as written" I give it a 3, a 4 with changes. As written it is too bland for me. Made the following changes: used brown rice, added a clove of garlic to the meat filling and used spaghetti sauce (more tomato and more herb flavor than the blah condensed tomato soup). With the changes hubby really liked it and would like to see it again. I boiled the cabbage leaves just long enough to wilt them/make them easier to fold and finished it off in the crock pot on low x 5 hours.

I made this last night, and it was fantastic! I added a can of chopped tomatoes, and some garlic powder, paprika, and that was it. We enjoyed dinner, then  later with the leftovers I decided to try it with a Dollop of Sour Cream on top. That made it Awesome.  I need to go to the store and get more sour cream for the leftovers.

I've got one word for this recipe . . .  DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exact and thought it was really tasty.  The second time around (that's how good it was, it required a 2nd time) I added in minced garlic, red pepper flakes and a shake of worchestershire to the meat mixture. I thought I had tomato soup at home but I didn't so I had to use tomato sauce, unfortunately all I had was a small can so I combined that with 1/2 jar of Prego Spicy tomato & Basil spaghetti sauce.  It turned out to be a very tasty mistake that I'll make again.  My only regret was that I didn't take the time to take a photo.

Instead of cooking over low heat, I stuck it in 375 oven, covered, for about 45 minutes.   Good the way it is, but next time I will spice it up a little.

Would make again. I especially liked the tomato soup as the sauce. Much more flavorful than tomato sauce. I cooked mine in the crock pot on high for 5 hours.

This basic recipe is fine, but I also prefer tomato sauce, 2 T brown sugar, 1 ts. garlic salt & 1 T. lemon juice.  I also slash the core & microwave cabbage head.  With exception of microwaving cabbage head & crock potting, this is exactly how my Grandma Botsford made them in the 1950's, baking in oven. A family & friends fave!!!

I think you got it from my MOM. She made this during my childhood. Just wish the hubby liked cabbage When short on time she would layer this in a casserole and top with crushed saltines and bake in the oven. Yum Judy thanks for the memories

How nice to see a recipe for "golabki" on this site.  There are many variations of this Polish dish and this one comes very close to mine.  My mother insisted we never put eggs in ours though as she felt the eggs would harden the meat.  When I make them I usually use five pounds of good hamburger and two heads of cabbage.  Always plenty to share with my grown children and I freeze many for future meals.  And, I do bake them and my sauce has always been a huge bottle of ketchup!  Thanks Judy for posting this one; it's worth the effort.

I have been making stuffed cabbage (Holupki) for 40 years and the secret is making a roux and adding to rolls the last half hour of roasting.  Roux is crisco or vegetable oil, add flour, stir constantly until a golden color and it will have a nutty aroma.  Keep roux thin, add can of crushed tomatoes, it immediately thickens.  Add to cabbage rolls and roast additional 1/2 hour.  I also add large can of tomato juice to the cabbage before cooking.

This was very good. I cooked mine in the crock pot. Per other reviews, I sprayed the crock pot with non stick spray and lined the bottom with a few cabbage leaves. I mixed 1 pound beef, the cooked rice, an egg, 1 envelope of onion soup mix, and 2 tbsp ketchup. Rolled the rolls and snuggled them in the pot. I used 1 large can of whole tomatoes (I crushed), 2 cloves fresh garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper for the sauce. Pour over rolls and  cook on low for 5-7 hours. Oh yeah, I also sprinkled about 2 tbsp brown sugar on top of rolls. Very good!

Yummy!  Oh so good!  My husband and I really loved this.  I followed some of the other reviewers.  I added garlic to the meat mixture and a can of Rotel instead of the tomato soup.  The when I cooked I added 2 small cans tomato sauce with another can of Rotel.  We loved it because we love spice.  Many people probably wouldn't like it that spicy, but you could use 1 can of diced tomatos in place of one of those cans of Rotel.  Love it!  Thanks for sharing! :)

**** THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY WHICH WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THIS RECIPE IS TO PAR BOIL THE RICE AND DRAIN WELL.  UNCOOKED RICE CAN PULL THE MOISTURE FROM THE BEEF AND THEREFORE LEAVE A LITTLE DRY.  ALSO MIX A CAN OF STEWED TOMOTOES WITH THE TOMOTO SOUP, IT JUST ADDS A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR.

This was so easy and soooooooooooooo delicious. I made it vegan. I omitted the egg and I used veggie protein crumbles in place of ground beef. Like the other reviewers I used spaghetti sauce in place of tomato soup. Worked just fine. I added spaghetti sauce to the "beef" mixture as well. Used garlic, onion, basil leaves and some paprika for seasoning.    I boiled the cabbage as indicated and they rolled just fine. I used one or two toothpicks because some leaves were slightly torn as I was separating them. Like the first reviewer, I baked the rolls for 40 minutes. Lovely! Thank you much.

I left out the egg....oops - had it lightly beaten sitting in a small bowl and got these all assembled and voila - there was the egg still in the bowl.  I can't imagine this made any difference in the taste and my meat mix ( i used ground turkey) certainly didn't need it as a binder so if you don't want the egg don't bother with it.  I sauteed my onions with some minced garlic before adding it into the mix.  I cooked my cabbage for about 8 min. and had no trouble removing the leaves.  I added brown sugar, worcestershire sauce and lemon juice to the tomato soup.  I baked mine and they came out very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did not find this recipe good. I have had stuffed cabbage rolls before and these did not even come close. I do not understand why this recipe is rated so high. There was very little seasoning and the sauce leaved something to be desired.

great,we loved them,I sugest that if you make these try this. cut the stem of the bottom .then cut out the core and place cabbage in boiling water.in 4 min, the leaves will start falling off.place aside to drain when cooled take a small knife and slice the rib on the bottom of the leaf off-put your filling on and roll up then take another leaf and double roll it if you like cabbage, put sauce on bottom of pan and line the bottom with the snall leaves place cabbage rolls on top this keeps the rolls from burning then cover with sauce or tomato juice try it you will love it

I have never eaten Stuffed Cabbage before. I wanted to try something different, something out of my comfort zone and couldn't resist this recipe with all it's high reviews. I thought these were good but honestly, nothing I would probably make again. The meat seemed a little bland. I think adding some garlic, salt and maybe some hot sauce might boost the flavor. I'd give it a 3.5 for "average"

Good recipe. I did add a few ingredients as suggested by other reviewers. I added italian seasoning, crushed garlic and worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. The tip on boiling the head of cabbage to get the leaves off was a life-saver....Thank you! I also added a bit of italian seasoning, garlic powder, season salt and worcestershire sauce to the tomato soup, which I used 2 cans cause we like the extra sauce.

I kicked it up a bit by adding a little Italian sausage to the ground beef, and extra seasonings. I also cooked them in the slow cooker (great).  They were a little "loose" right from the crock, but the left overs -- after being refrigerated -- WOW!  They were much much better the second night -- they firmed up very nicely and stayed more together after reheating in the microwave.  Huge sucess - can't wait to make them again.  Also used 2 cans of tomato soup like several recommended.

I thought that this was a really good recipe, although basic.  I added into the hamburger mixture about a tbs of caraway seed for that hearty flavor caraway is known for.  I think that next time I will add some brown sugar in addition to the caraway, as well as more rice so that way I can make more and freeze them.  I didnt have tomato soup, so I used veggie juice, which turned out good.  I cooked mine in the slow cooker for about three hours on high, and they were excellent.

My family enjoyed this recipe, but we all felt it could withstand a little more cabbage flavor, so next time, I plan to make each roll with two leaves of cabbage.

This was very good and is very close to the one I've been using for...oh more years than I care to admit.  Just a suggestion that makes the job a lot easier.  I put the head of cabbage in the freezer unril I'm ready to use iit -- then I defrost it.  The leaves are pliable and easy to roll.  Try it.

Good basic recipe. Using suggestions of others, I made changes, and I feel made the recipe even better. Used uncooked rice, sauteed the onion with some garlic, and added some of the tomatoes to the meat mixture. After stuffing the cabbage, I combined one can tomato soup and two cans crushed tomatoes for the sauce (tho I would use more tomato soup less crushed tomatoes next time). I placed this in a baking dish, covered and baked at 350 for 50 minutes. Delicious.

This is a good starter recipe for stuffed cabbage. Like the other reviewers, I modified the recipe by using ground turkey, and adding Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and minced, fresh garlic to the meat mixture.  I also added two tbsp of brown sugar, but I wish that I hadn't. The end taste was too sweet, because to me, stuffed cabbage should be slightly tangy, not sweet.

These were delicious.  Like other reviewers, I added some garlic powder, a few drops of worcestershire sauce, and one tablespoon each lemon juice and brown sugar to the meat mixture.  I also added half a jar of spaghetti sauce to the tomato soup, and added 4 tablespoons of this to the meat instead of 2.   I baked these at 350 for about 50 minutes, and we loved them!

My grandmother taught me this recipie. I make about 3 times the amount you do, because everyone in my extended family wants some! I usually scrape down the "vein" on the cabbage leaves, use a little more onion in the mix and about twice as much tomato soup. Also, once all the cabbage rolls are ready, "Gram" would dice up and carmalize an additional onion and mix in with the soup. Gave it a little extra flavor.

This was surprisingly delicious. Surprising, because I'd never thought of cabbage as tasty. I usually considered it a necessary evil to corned beef. This was wonderful! The husband and I both enjoyed it very much. :)

Excellent!  Made as is with the exception of sautéing onions, and used Rao's homemade marinara sauce instead tomato soup.  Turned out great!  After serving, my husband added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce for a little extra flavor.  I didn't want to change the recipe too much, since this was my first time making cabbage rolls, but I might try adding brown sugar, lemon, & worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture next time (as other's have suggested).  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

There's four people in my house, I do the cooking for us. I made eight cabbage rolls and then had to leave. I came back and THREE people had eaten all of them! So, I don't know how they taste, but it must be good.

So Good. Well worth the time. Made my own sauce, could not pour tomato soup on this. I added a few spices to a can of stewed tomato's, such as garlic, bay leaf, oregano and basil.  Wonderful with mashed potatoes and any fresh vegetable. Kids and Dad loved it. I also baked it in the oven @350 for 1 hour.

This recipe is a very good take on a classic and filling family dish. I followed the recipe exactly. The family all enjoyed the rolls and the unique sauce but still thought the stuffing needed some extra spice to it. Leftovers were excellent! A very useful tip: A very simple way to prepare the cabbage leaves for this recipe, or any other recipe which requires the leaves to be used as a wrap is to freeze the head of cabbage whole - it's like a frozen bowling ball! Then thaw the cabbage completely - it takes 1-2 days. Core the cabbage. The leaves pull away very easily without all the fuss and bother of the cumbersome boiling, cooling and sorting of cabbage leaves in the traditional method described. This method will reduce your prep time and effort considerably, minimize clean up time, and make the stuffing job a real breeze. You will never go back to the traditional method once you try this freezing technique. Try it yourself!

I made these for the first time this last weekend for my boyfriend, who is Polish, and it's one of his favorite meals (Mom and Grandma made them, so I had some heavy competition!) 
I did some tweaking because I like to use more layers in flavor... I doubled the recipe so he would have plenty for the week :-)
I used 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb spicy ground sausage, 1/2 c fresh minced onion, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 1/2 fresh cracked pepper, 2 TB brown sugar, 1 TB Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 cup cooked white rice, and about 1/3 cup of the tomato sauce mix.  
I made the sauce mix with 2 cans tomato soup and 1 large can of petite diced tomatoes.  It made a lot of sauce, but these are best with plenty for the cabbage rolls and for sopping up with French bread slice, buttered, and placed under the broiler until lightly toasted. I placed the larger outer leaves on the bottom of the baking dish on top of 1/3 cup of diced tomatoes and layered the rolls w/half of the sauce mix followed by the remaining rolls topped with the remainder of the sauce and baked them at 350 for 1.5 hrs. These were a HUGE hit! They met the very biased approval of my boyfriend, which speaks volumes!  YUM!! A few hints that really made a difference (from various reviews) is to parboil the cabbage and remove the leaves as they fall away from the head, as well as cutting out the spine in each leaves before rolling, as it made it much easier to roll them without the need for toothpicks.

To me this is a basic recipe.  What I do is cook the hamburg up with onions and garlic pepper then add a package of taco seasoning and water, and cooked rice.  I also add re-fried beans for added taste. It is spicy but not too and with the taco seasoning it just adds that punch of spice it needs. I then use a can of Accents tomatoes instead of the soup.  We just love it.

Good basic recipe.  I like to make my own sauce and sometimes add a can of tomato soup if I need more.  I find rolls are best baked with lid on for most of the baking.  Since I like sweet and sour flavours, I add brown sugar and fresh lemon juice, to taste.  

Ground beef and ground pork or ham make a good combination for stuffing with cooked rice. I shred the smallest leaves and use to line the bottom of the roaster and top the rolls with the larger, tough leaves, which prevents burning (as mentioned by another contributor).  Cabbage rollls always taste best if made the day before or two days before!

Was SO great! Everyone suggested tomato juice but since no one would drink the extra, I decided to use V8 juice mixed with a can of tomato soup. Used the cabbage leaves to cover bottom and top of the pan and the rolls came out wonderful! I mixed a little garlic in (about half a clove). Can't wait for lunch tomorrow to finish them!!

I had never even heard of Cabbage Rolls until last week.  After much searching I decided to try this recipe.  It was fantastic and my little kids gobbled it up.  
I did make the changes that were suggested by other reviewers.  I baked them @ 350 for about an hour and 15 minutes.  I also made my own sauce to pour over the top.  8 oz tomato sauce, 1 Tbsp Lemon juice, 1Tbsp brown sugar and 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.
I will definitely be making these again.

Good basic recipe. I prefer a bit more flavor. I used garlic salt instead of salt and added worchestershire sauce to the meat. I added a can of tomato sauce, cider vinegar and smoked paprika to the tomato soup for the sauce. After cooking I removed the rolls and reduced the sauce until thickened. Maybe not authentic but just like mom made back in northern Ohio.

This was a HUGE hit with my kids, especially my picky eater. Even my mother in law who never eats anything new liked it. Made some tweaks. Used couscous instead of rice (had some leftover). Added a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce. 1 can of tomato soup was not enough so I added a can of diced tomato's and a small can of tomato sauce. It was delicious. Adding this to the rotation for sure.

Nic - NO you don't have to brown the meat at all. If you bake in the oven or on the stove, the meat is cooked with the juices and vapor enough that it negates the necessity to brown it.

I loved this! I used 1/2 beef 1/2 sausage. 1 cup of rice, 1/2 onion, 1/2 green pepper, and i used spaghetti sauce.(original recipe for other amounts)
I then doubled the recipe, using about 1 & 1/3 jars sauce, it ended up making about 20 rolls total, baked for an hour covered with foil, then another 1/2 hour uncovered. DELICIOUS AND SO FILLING!

I have made this recipes many time since coming across it a few years back. My family and I enjoy every time - even my 2 little picky eaters :-).  It is one of few meals that I make where my husband will re-heat and eat the leftovers! The only thing I do differenlty is add some tomato sauce to the soup - only because we always eat this with mashed potatoes, and use the extra sauce to pour on top of them. Delish!

I found that the filling of this recipe was good, although for the sauce, I follow the other recipe for cabbage rolls on this site that calls for tomato sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, and worchestershire sauce. Then it is darn good!

Watching my Slovak Grandmother for years, I have to say that although this recipe is similar to that which many people make, it wasn't according to her, authentic. She would add a clove of grushed garlic into the meat mixture which would be 1/2 pound ground pork and 1/2 pound ground meat. Instead of condensed tomato soup for the sauce, lay the cabbage rolls on a bed of drained (not rinsed) sauerkraut. Cover with tomato puree, add two small pieces of kielbassi to the pot and cook until the rolls reach an internal termperature of at least 165 degrees F.   She has since passed on, however, the taste of her Stuffed Cabbages, live on in this recipe.

My family enjoys recipes that are simple. Recipes that have few ingerdients. I tried this recipe out and it was a big hit! I made three changes, however. I switched the tomato soup, dropped the egg, and added some garlic powder to taste. I'm happy to say that this recipe has made it into my monthly dinner rotation. :)

The ONLY change I made and that I HIGHLY recommend is to add about a tablespoon of steak seasoning to the meat mixture ( trust me it makes the taste awesome) I also added sone garlic! They were wonderful , thank you so much for this recipe!! & trust me on the steak spice, you won't be disappointed!

This is a delicious recipe.  However, cooking on the stove burns mine easily.  Has anyone tried baking this?  Please tell me the temperature and the baking time.  Thank you.

Made this for supper tonight.  It was a big hit, even with my son who isn't wild about cooked cabbage.  I did tweak it a bit to suit our preferences and my convenience.  I used 1 pound of hamburger and 1 pound of sage sausage.  Seasoned, crushed tomatoes were substituted in place of the tomato soup and I baked it in the oven for 1 hour.  Thanks for this basic start to a great dish.  Never made them before, but definitely will again.

This recipe is delicious, simple, tasty, and has healthy food in it.  What more can a girl ask for?  I did add dry onion soup mix to the meat mix, put the cabbage head in the microwave for 1 1/2 min., added shredded carrots to the meat mix, and added two soup cans of water to the pot I was cooking the cabbage rolls in because I was afraid they'd burn.  I don't know if this is "toddler approved" because my son had a tummy ache so he ate leftover spaghetti instead.  My husband said that they were "alright", but I never get a big reaction out of him since he eats almost anything:).  He finished everything on his plate so he must have liked these and he normally doesn't eat cabbage.  I'm going to try this in my slow cooker next time and add a tiny bit of marjoram to the sauce since that's something that seems to go well in sauces.  This is a wonderful addition to the meals that I like to cook for my family.  Thanks!

5 Stars for flavor: )  Taking ideas from other reviewers, i made my sauce using 2 cans tomato soup, 2 TB brown sugar, 2 TB lemon juice, and 2 Tsp Worchestershire Sauce.  I baked the rolls with sauce poured over and covered with foil for 1 hour at 375.

This is an outstanding basic stuffed cabbage recipe.  I had never made this before though I've had it often and was very pleased with the recipe just the way it is.  I served it with cheese mini-pierogis and creamed corn for a true Polish dinner.

Very yummy!  I made a couple changes based on peoples reviews and what I had on hand.  The cabbage was very pliable just by boiling the entire head of cabbage in a big pot of salted water for 6-8 min., then pouring the boiling water out and letting the cabbage sit in cold water for 1-2 min (drain and put aside until ready to use).  I also added garlic, 1 Tbs worchestershire sauce, 1 Tbs lemon juice, & 1 Tbs brown sugar to the meat mixture.  As other reviewers, I too used my preferred can of pasta sauce (w/ mushrooms) and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce.  My rolled cabbage stayed nice and secure just by placing them seam side down.  I also baked mine in a 350 degree oven for 1 hr. basting them w/ the sauce often.  Turned out moist and yummy.  They make awesome left-overs too!

You need a dollap of sour cream to the sauce to be truly Polish style. It is pretty close to my great grandmothers recipe. Also some paprika!!!! Hot or sweet.

Like some other reviewers --- a real taste of Pittsburgh home.  A wonderful winter staple, with or without sauerkraut .  This is the recipes we all used, although some folks did use tomato instead of soup.  I'm partial to the soup.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, Judy.

Disagree about the veal. I'm Polish and we use combination beef/veal/pork, which any Polish market will sell you. Also, look for cabbage that is more white than green (easy to find in a Polish mkt), and also use Vegeta seasoning, which Polish people add to everything. Egg isn't necessary. Shouldn't need to secure w/string either. My twist is brown rice, which gives a richer taste.

Our family mixes beef, veal and pork; we stuff practically every leaf of the cabbage and just tuck the ends in (no string or toothpicks!).  Then, in addition to tomato sauce w. water, we layer sauerkraut as well as chunks of kolbassi (this is for a 3 lbs. of ground meat recipe).  We bake it in the oven for several hours at 350; the kolbassi is just great.  Served with mashed potatoes, it's fantastic.  (Raised in an Eastern European neighborhood in PA.)

This recipe is so basic, so simple, that you can easily modify to your own preferences.  I knocked one star off because I believe it would have been bland without modification.    I tried microwaving the cabbage like other reviewers, and it ended up being more trouble than just boiling it.  I steamed it, though.  I piled pulled leaves into the pot, which meant that I had to go through a few rounds of flipping the leaves (and removing those that were ready to go) before they were all done.  I also cut the tough spine out.  I might dice these up and add to sauce next time (along with other leftover cabbage).  I didn't use the can of soup, but I'd say you need more than one can.  I used a large can of diced tomatoes, a long squirt of ketchup, a small can of tomato sauce, and small can of tomato paste.  I used about a 1/4 of the tomato sauce to mix in with the meat mixture. I also added a mixture of diced peppers, dried basil and oregano, powdered garlic, cinammon, and salt/pepper to taste.  I added some chipotle hot sauce because the sauce still needed a kick.  I used a beef:sausage (3:1) mixture.  I used mild italian sausage, and would use hot next time around.  I also added breadcrumbs and used brown rice.  I would add parmasan next time, too.  I would also make sure I had enough salt in the meat mixture next time, too.  I also thought that the dish tasted better after 2+ hours of cooking.  I ate after 40 mins, and it could have used more time.

I made this for dinner last night.  It was my first attempt at making cabbage rolls and they turned out absolutely wonderful!  I did use another reviewers recipe for the sauce, which was doubled so that I could serve it over my rice side.  There was no need for toothpicks to hold the rolls together, either.  Definitely worth making.  It's not as much trouble as it may seem.

Very good recipe, but I did make some changes after reading some of the reviews.  Instead of salt and pepper I added an Onion soup mix.  Then for the sauce on top, I added 1 can of tomato soup and one small can of tomato sauce, sprinkled some worcester sauce and brown sugar on top with a little water. Good stuff!

This is my newest favorite recipe.  I put the cabbage head in the microwave and heated it on high for 3 minutes at a time until I could easily remove 8 leaves.  I used 1/2 ground chuck and half ground turkey.  I put the stuffed rolls in a casserole dish, mixed the remaining tomato soup with a large can of tomato sauce, and poured it over the rolls.  I baked it in a 350 degree oven for 2 hours.  Delicious!

Delicious and easy to make! I like to use tomato sauce (or regular spaghetti sauce) instead of tomato soup. I think it's best to put it all in a baking dish and bake at 350.

Very similar to what I had growing up. My father was German and Croatian, my mother is Japanese. Dad taught mom to make these but because he wasn't a fan of tomatoes, he asked her to substitute with cream of mushroom soup. Just follow your usual recipe but instead of tomato sauce/juice, thin a can of cream of mushroom soup with milk or water, pour over the cabbage rolls and bake or use your slow cooker. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed!

We love these cabbage rolls although I did add some garlic, salt, pepper and a little Italian seasoning to the meat mixture. I had also gotten a late start cooking so I cooked these in an electric skillet at medium for about 3 1/2 hours and they turned out great!

Noticed several reviews about the sauce.  We make an almost identical family recipe and the sauce is the best part of the meal.  Dice one onion in 3 tbsp of butter.  Add 2 cans of tomato soup (Heinz is the best tasting) and 1 can of milk.  Heat till warm.  We also add a little pork (1/3 pork, 2/3 ground beef).  Hope you enjoy it!!

This sounds just like my mother-in-laws recipe - although she added water.  One great suggeestion that saves a lot of time....

Just chop the cabbage into large chunks, put them at the bottom of the pot; turn the filling into meatballs, place them on top and then add the liquid.  Don't stir until the meatballs 'harden' a bit.  All the same flavors without the time.

REALLY good recipe. I have never made stuffed cabbage before. I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was still really good. I also followed the hint to put the cabbage in the microwave for two minutes to take the leaves off, and they did indeed come off in tact. I added a little garlic to the soup and also used two instead of one can. Next time I might try crushed tomatoes. All in all, DELICIOUS! We loved it in my house!

I tried this recipe after having tried one that you cooked in a slow cooker and OMG I loved this recipe better! I didn't use the tomato soup like the recipe called and followed Mary's suggestion about making the sauce with tomato sauce. I was a bit confused about the rice though bc it calls for 1/3 cup in the ingredients but then in the recipe it says 1 cup but the 1/3 was more than enough.  Will definately have this again! Thanks for shareing!

YUMMY!  I made this last night for my family (10 ppl total).  After reading some other reviews I decide to add the brown sugar, lemon, and Worcestershire sauce.  I also had to use 2+ cans of tomato soup.  I am not one either for measuring, just add and taste. I also used brown instant rice, cooked.  I made mine with 2pds of beef and 1 pd of pork, I know that seems like alot but I froze the left over meat mixture.  After making my rolls, I also made meatballs in another pan, for the ones who did not like cabbage. I took the leaves of the cabbage that I was planning on discarding, and placed them on top of everything to keep heat in, covered with foil, I cooked mine for about an hr. Everyone loved it!  It was moist and tender! I was proud of this dish and will use it again! served with homemade mashed potatoes and candied carrots!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Good stuff! I do much the same but add 4 TBSP. vinegar to the water which gives it a bit of a sour cabbage taste.

Good recipe.  But I always freeze the cabbage whole ahead of time.  Thaw, cut though the core slightly and stuff. Bake in the oven.  It is much less messy than boiling the cabbage, and the cabbage still cooks up nicley.

This recipe taste just like my mothers and grandmothers.  The only thing I changed was to par boil the whole head of cabbage. It makes it easier to take the leaves off.  Just be carefull not to over boil.

very good! I NEVER cook. EVER. made this for my boyfriend that loves cabbage rolls. was scared to make them but with the tips from other comments on here they turned out great!! I browned the meat first and put sauce (not soup) over them. Couldnt imagine not adding a LOT more spices,I also baked them and then reheated them for dinner the next day, tasted MUCH better. A very good basic recipe to learn from! will make them again for sure!

I changed a lot of this recipe based on previous reviews but still gave it 5 stars. I used instant brown rice and it worked just fine. Additions: 1 tbsp of brown sugar and lemon juice, couple of squirts of Worcestershire(?) sauce, few dashes of paprika and garlic powder. I used 2 cans of stewed/diced tomotoes in seasonings instead of tomoto soup (I think that would be bland). I did not steam the leaves first. I baked at 350 for an hour. My husband and 20 month old really liked it! Oh, so did I:)

I also have used this recipie for 20+ years. After I pour the soup over the cabbage rolls, I add undrained/unrinsed sauerkraut.  It helps to keep them moist and adds an extra ZING.

I personally really liked this recipe and would give it 5 stars but....my parents said it was too sweet and a tiny tiny bit bland.  So next time I may use another substitute for the tomato soup perhaps tomato juice.  I took advice from others and used about 2 cans of soup becuase 1 can was  not enough.

I made some substitutions and it turned out great.  I didn't have ground beef so I used ground turkey. I used a little more meat than it called for, so I added a little extra rice and onion.  I used the amount called for, for the other ingredients.  2 hours in a slow cooker set to high worked great for me.  Try this one!!

The original recipe helped me understand that I needed to steam the cabbage before filling them - many thanks! I found the recipe was excellent, and I modified it slightly by adding basil pesto, celantro and chopped tomatoes to the filling. I cooked them in a crock pot on high for 6 hours with a 16oz can of diced tomatoes for liquid. The  cabbage was translucent and tasted fabulous. My husband loved them and will definitely make again. Freezes well.

This was my first attempt at stuffed cabbage rolls so I followed the directions exactly.  Boy, did these bring me back to my childhood when my German grandmother made them!!!  They were delish! Some people think it's odd to put tomato soup over the top, but when cooked with the cabbage and meat juices, it turns out to be a very yummy sauce!  I just wish there was more of it to drizzle over my meat once I slice it.  I may add a little more tomato soup next time.  Other than that, I'm tempted to try some of the changes other people made, but if it ain't broke, why fix it? :)

Really delicious.  Have made other galobki recipes in the past but this was the best. Modifications I made: used brown rice, mixed a small can of V8 with the tomato soup & baked at 350 covered for 1 hour then uncovered for 15 minute. This is a keeper.

Many thanks to user ICookItsWhatIDo for the tips! I have made this recipe a couple of times before and had a heck of a time trying to peel the leaves off of the cabbage to boil them! I followed this user's idea of coring the raw cabbage and then parboiling and the leaves came out perfectly whole, with no rips or tears! I also followed the tip to use the extra leaves to line a baking pan and cover the rolls, and bake at 350 degrees for 1 and a half hours. They came out just right! Excellent recipe! :)

Delicious! If you have a hunch that the cabbage rolls need to be cooked longer, go with your gut. I had to keep mine in the oven for an extra half hour and was very happy with the results after doing this. I am vegetarian so decided to use sauteed minced mushrooms for the filler and along with the rice. In order to get that tasty pork flavour, I also added about 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke to the mix. Yummy yummy! I love the tomato soup sauce base.

turned out great - I took quite a few suggestions listed here and made a few of my own. Added more spices and seasonings: worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, basil, parsley, garlic; didn't use tomato soup substituted with a small can of tomato paste and a jar of homemade salsa. Substituted rice for bread crumbs - just personal preference today.  Layered cabbage leaves on bottom and top of the rolls and then covered with homemade stewed & crushed tomatoes. Baked in the oven. Served with potatoes.

To add a touch of Hungarian to this and after rolls have been made,  layer a casserole dish 15x10 with sauer kraut; sprinkle about 1/4 cup of brown sugar over kraut.  If want, add sliced potatotes on top of kraut  place cabbage rolls on top, and bake for about 30-45 minutes in 350 degree oven.

This recipe is pretty basic and authentic; i have been making cabbage rolls (Halupki) for at least 40 years and learned from my Slovak father. Salt pork topped the pot! Tomato soup is very authentic; i have a Slovak cookbook from 1952 and those halupki recipes all call for tomato soup. My mother used to use Hunt's Tomato Sauce for hers, and so i like it better that way personally. A couple of suggestions to make it easier: take the cabbage and cut around the core; straight down, to cut where the leaves attach to the core. Put the cabbage in a pot, fill with water and bring to boil. You will see the cabbage start to turn a brighter color, you can then cut the leaves off the core and pull them off with a fork, as you use them,  allow the cabbage head to sit in simmering water for more leaves to soften. As for the rice, we boiled water, added the rice, turned of the heat and let it sit for 3-5 min. then drain. Now it is par-boiled and you can add it directly to the raw meat, with a little tomato sauce, a LOT of salt and pepper and if you like, some onion and/or garlic powder. Two final suggestions; put about a half cut of water in the pot with the stuffed leaves, so that they do not scorch, and finally, add a few capfuls of vinegar to the finished product. The vinegar helps prevent "gas" from the cabbage, and also adds a little flavor. My family sometimes cooked any extra cabbage; when we ate it, we would use some of the pot sauce, a dab of butter(no saltpork) and  more vinegar.

I will never try another stuffed cabbage recipe again! This was delicious! I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and I added some pasta sauce to the recipe because there wasn't enough tomato soup to cover the rolls. The final dish was great. Loved it!

First time making cabbage rolls and they turned out great!!!  I did a bit of variation.  Instead of just onions, I added chopped red/green peppers, added some garlic and crushed chilli pepper, and used lean ground pork. For sauce, I combined 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, can condensed tomato soup and 1/2 to 1 cup chopped red/green/onions.  Poured over cabbage rolls, covered with foil and cooked in 350 degree over for abt. 2 hrs.  DELICIOUS!!!!

My first attempt and it was pretty darn good. I didn't like the idea of plain tomato soup/sauce. I did what other reviewers suggested and added brown sugar and Worcestershire - delish!

I made these using 1/2 pork sausage and 1/2 ground beef mixed. I used a can of tomato soup and 1/2 jar of leftover ready made pasta sauce. I also didn't have any white rice so I substituted some Basmati brown rice...Wow,they were so good! Can't wait to make them again. My 94 year old mother loved them (she's sometimes hard to please).

I followed this recipe exactly and the rolls came out very good.  This is the first time I ever made them.  I used an electric skillet and the one can of tomato soup did not seem enough so I added a little water.  Next time I think I will use 2 cans of tomato soup for more sauce.  My mother used to make these using a Kosher recipe and I no longer have any of her recipes, but I remember her making the sauce with grape jelly, so I took out a little sauce and added some grape jelly for a sweeter flavor.  I liked it, but most of my family like just the tomato sauce.  Will definitely try this recipe again, maybe for our bunco group.

First time making these. I added some Jimmy Dean Pork sausage to the mix for more flavor and to make 10 total. Also did 1/2c chopped onions instead of just 1/4c. For more flavor I added a bit of garlic powder. My family likes extra sauce so I added a whole can of Italian Stewed tomatoes to the mix. Served over white rice and steamed what was left of the cabbage head, carrots, and broccoli.

Yummy! This was my first time making stuffed cabbage and they came out great! It was intimidating making these for my husband, especially since he is used to his Polish mothers cabbage. But he loved them! He even said they were better than his mothers. I did make just a couple of modifications. I added some italian sausage just because I didn't have enough ground beef. And I used tomato bisque with a can of diced tomatoes instead of just the soup. Great recipe!

I really do love this recipe, but not exactly as listed on here. Add more sauce, this recipe ran short and I used a little more than listed, also, I think there was more meat than cabbage, so I recommend extra, also   takes longer than an hour.... cooking the rice is 20 minutes plus the 40 minutes cook time so its and hour plus the prepping time, just saying.

I made these for some my family and friends the other night and everyone loved them.  I am now making them again less than a week later.  I would suggest boiling the cabbage first it makes it so much easier to get the cabbage leaves off the head and to roll the caggabe once they are stuffed.  I also added some spinach to the ground beef part for a little extra healty kick  ; )  mmmm...

this recipe is good... it may not sound right, but if you try this you will really like it. I was taught to add a teaspoon of mint to the meat, it gives it a really good flavor and removes the gases in the cabbage.

I probably wouldn't make this again.  It actually required 2 cans of tomato soup (which I bought an extra can because I had a feeling) and even that wasn't enough.  The bottoms of at least 2 of the rolls were almost burnt had I not flipped them.  This is the basic, bottom of the barrel cabbage roll recipe that even a first time cook could make.  I would deviate highly from the recipe to add more flavor and might even bake them if I had never made it before.

I prepared these a little differently.  I browned them in a skillet and baked them in a combination of pasta sauce and V8 for about an hour at 350 degrees.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to add parsley and use brown rice instead of white.  They turned out great.

I followed recipe except instead of cooking stovetop, I baked them at 350 for 40 min and they were perfect out of the oven.  I also added garlic to meat mixture, personal preference as I add to most my meals. I found this recipe to be mostly bland due to the tomato soup.  Usually I use tomato sauce (but I was out).  Sauce gives it a bit more thicker, richer texture and flavor.  I found the campbells tomato soup I used to leave rolls a bit boring for my taste.  Next time I'll try a traditional marinara before I"ll use a soup base again if I'm out of sauce.

I will make this again Yum.  I made it in a slow cooker which was recommended but I didn't see specifics for it.   I used the auto switch function where it goes from high to low after a certain time.  The only changes I made based on previous posts:  instead of a bit of soup in the meat I used ketchup, a bit of worcestershire and garlic.  Also used two cans of soup instead of one.  Total cook time about 5.5 hours.

this is actually a very good recipe. It's actually a very old Polish recipe called golabki (pronounced (gaw-WOHMP-kee) and means little pigeons. The original recipe calls for ground pork and without the rice. But this recipe is fantastic!

When I was making them I wasn't sure I was going to like them, but I was wrong, I loved them. I made some changes to my preferences.... I used ground turkey instead of beef, I steamed the whole head of cabbage so it was easier to peal the leafs off without tearing them, and I added about 1/3C tomato sauce.

Oh my goodness! These were incredible. They came out much bigger than I remember my grandmothers being, but they were delicious. I wilted the cabbage by wrapping it in a damp paper towel and putting it in the micro for about 3 minutes. Also, I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. I also made my own tomato sauce because I like a little bit of a thicker sauce with them. I will be making these again!

Deliicious, no one excited that they were having cabbage rolls for dinner, these were so good that they were gone in one sitting.  I baked them in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes and instead of white rice I added a mixture of brown and wild rice.

You can add to the flavor by grating the the leftover cabbage (about 1 cup) into meat mixture.  A huge help is to add about 1-2 tsp cider vinegar and 2-3 T. brown sugar to the soup to pop the flavor. Way better then straight tomato soup. This is a great way to use extra cabbage from the garden.  I cook batches of these and freeze in ziploc bags in dinner-sized portions. Freezes very well.

These were easy to prepare once the leaves were softened. I would not have stuffed them as full as the recipe called for, but they were very good and I will make them again.

Thisis a recipe similar to mine, except I ad a scant tsp. of cinnamon and juice from  1/2 a lemon to meat mix.  It really perks up the flavor.  It's so good.  Hope this helps.

As some others have mentioned, it's a bit bland.  I don't know if I would make again, kind of ambivalent about this recipe.  I did omit the tomato soup and instead use the sauce the # 1 reviewer suggested.  It was still was missing something, not sure what.  ****UPDATE****  I had some leftovers last night and it was WAY better than the night I cooked it.  Keeping it in the fridge for a day really made a difference, therefore I'm changing from 3 stars to 4.  It was really quite good as leftovers.

Overall, an easy, delicious recipe that translates to vegetarian very well.  Rated 4 stars because, as others mentioned, it's a bit bland.  I used Morningstar Farms Griller crumbles and marinara sauce in place of the soup.  Baked in a lidded casserole dish at 375 for 45 minutes.  After removing the lid, I topped the dish with mozzarella cheese and broiled to brown.  I will definitely repeat this recipe with a few tweaks.

I had never tried stuffed cabbage rolls before, but thought I would give them a try for St. Patrick's Day.  WOW!  YUMMY!  The only change I made was to add a can of diced tomatoes over the top of the tomato soup to add a bit more liquid for the cabbage rolls to cook in.  The kids thought they were just okay, but my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  Will definitely make them again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I freeze the entire cabbage and thaw it at room temperature for three days so it is similar to saurekraut, the use raw rice an ground beef.  Pour the sauce over an bake at least two hours at 350F, that way the cabbage is more tender.

Very similar to recipe I use.  But did you now you can also put the entire head of cabbage in the freezer for a few days, take out & thaw and not need to microwave or steam.  I also had about 1/4 cup brown sugar to my tomatoe sauce mixture (but I use tomatoe paste and water to the consistency wanted).  One of our favorite meals.

This was my 1st time cooking stuffed cabbage rolls.  Preparation was very time consuming and in the end the dish was a bit bland for all the work.  If I do make them again I will certainly add some of the suggestions to the sauce for better taste.    However, the main reason for my review is the fact that there were no instructions in the recipe to brown the ground beef before mixing with the rice etc.  I didn't like the aroma/taste of the stuffing ...after cooking for the 40mins I still worried that I may have just consumed uncooked meat and egg.  My husband commented that he thought that the meat should have been cooked prior to stuffing.  I think I agree.

This was the first time I've made cabbage rolls & I loved them!! The only thing i did different was i took 1/2 a can of sour kraut and layered the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan, put the rolls on top, then put the other 1/2 of the can on top of those  & baked them at 350 for 2 hours.They turned out extremely moist & tastey!

I haven't made "piggies" as we call them in over 5 years because mine were awful. This recipe was delicious. My kids loved them. I did use a crockpot(4 hrs on low and 4 on high) and the cabbage was so tender. I steamed the cabbage in the microwave with Tupperware Steamer and it worked great. Add this one to your recipe box.

If you want to skip cooking the rice, use minute rice. I add a little ketsup to the mixture in stead of the tomato soup and omit the egg. This way, I make a number of batches and freeze them in bags. When I am ready to cook them, I defrost one bag, put them in  the crock pot with a can of tomato soup and they are ready to eat in about 8 hours.

I have been making cabbage rolls for over 30 years usually i use one cup of uncooked rice to a pound of ground sirloin, then just salt and pepper not too much salt wrap meat and use tomato sauce and a little water to simmier, add a bit of butter since the meat is lean serve with mashed potatoes, buttered french bread.....gets better for leftovers, a yummy comfort food!

This was my first attempt at stuffed cabbage. I think i will try the longer way next time, just for practice but, this recipe was really good. I used 3/4 cups rice, 12 cabbage leaves, 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, and used about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce(instead of soup)in the meat mixture.  I also made the sauce that another reviewer had posted, and it was the perfect sauce for this dish... "I do make a different sauce. After all the work of making homemade stuffed cabbage rolls, I find it hard to pour tomato soup on top. For one pound of meat, I mix an 8oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 Tablespoon brown sugar, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce. I mix well and pour over cabbage rolls."  I also added about 1/4cup of organic ketchup to this sauce.  My mother in law to be makes fantastic stuffed cabbage, so i have big shoes to fill, my fiance thoroughly enjoyed this meal.

These are perfect fall weather comfort food.  Made per instructions except for the sauce.  I used one can of tomato soup in addition to the leftover cam, 1 can diced tomatoes added 1 tablespoon each of balsamic vinegar, worcestershire, and brown sugar.  We like a lot of sauce, served with mashed potatoes.  I also baked mine at 375 for one hour covered with foil.  Delicious and so easy,  sounds more complicated than it is.  You won't be sorry! Thanks for the recipe.

Turned out great!  Used ground turkey and brown rice. I didn't boil the leaves, just cored it and then placed in the microwave for 2.5 minutes (4 x) turning it around each time.  The leaves came off perfectly with no mess.  Also, did not use condensed tomato soup, but instead used a large jar of crushed tomatoes which I added to sauteed chopped onion with garlic and about a glass of white wine.  When putting it all together I alternated the tomato sauce with left over cabbage leaves in between the cabbage rolls topping the entire thing with remaining tomato sauce. Baked at 350 for almost 2 hrs.  It was great.  Will freeze the rest for the next time.

This is exactly my Mom's recipe for golampki's (we're Polish)...we always cooked it in a large dutch oven, covering the top of the rolls with the largest left over cooked cabbage leaves to prevent drying out, and then covering with a lid.  Will have to try the slow cooker method too.

I couldn't go without rating this recipe. I made this maybe 3weeks ago. My family loved it. My younger son was skeptical at first when he saw me rolling meat with cabbage but it was a hit. I did make some alterations with diced italian tomatoes on top and shredded cheese and turkey sausage with the ground beef and rice. It's a great way to get you family to eat veggies if you have a hard time like I do. My sister liked it so much she asked me to make it for Thanksgiving.

My husband is a very picky eater and loves this stuffed cabbage recipe! I make mine with ground turkey and he thinks it is even better than the tried and true recipe!

I have made this a handful of times this summer, and we LOVE it!!!  I follow Mary Domaz's recommendation on the homemade sauce in place of the tomato soup.  I usually double the sauce.  I replace the beef with ground turkey, and I use a wild/brown rice blend in place of the white.  I also prepare the rolls and place in a crockpot for 5 hours on low.  DELICIOUS!!!!  I think they are even better the day after.  My husband loves taking these for lunch the next day.

O...M....G!  I had a craving for these, and i havent had them in years, this recipe is awesome!  i was a little worried when i mixed the beef, it seemed really mushy, and it didn't seem like one tiny can of tomato soup was going to cut it, but i added a little bit of water to the pan, and the hamburger juices mixed into the soup real well.  super tender and real tasty with such few ingredients!  love it!

Really good - family liked them a lot.  I boiled my cabbage for 4 minutes.  I cooked my meat and used minute rice (cooked).  I made my own sauce using suggestions from the reviews.  I dont measure, I just pour and taste and stop when it taste good.  For my sauce I used 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I added: brown sugar, lemon juice, basil, salt, pepper, garlic, minced onion, Worcestershire sauce, and oregano.  I mixed and it tasted so good that my kids licked the bowl after I was finished with the sauce.

I added the meat, rice and 1/2 the sauce together and stuffed the cabbage, then poured the remaining sauce over the top.

I baked in the oven at 350 F for 20 minutes.

I have been making these cabbage rolls for years, although I have always baked mine, covered, in a 350 degree oven for an hour.  I also add a 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the meat mixture for extra flavor.  It is my youngest daughters' favorite dish. We like to serve them with homemade mashed potatoes.

I thought this could be a bit too bland for my taste so I added, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried marjoram and basil to the beef. I also sauteed the beef before adding the egg and cooked brown rice.  Then, I covered the rolls with a mixture of tomato soup, tomato sauce with Italian seasonings and baked as one of the reviewers suggested at 350 degres.  I'm really grateful for all the great recipes, ideas and tips provided here.

This recipe was really good and would use this as a frequent rotation on my menu. I did make a few changes according to the feedback that I read: Precook cabbage leaves for 2-3 min and pull off as they cook. Line baking dish with leaves. Prepare 1 lb lean ground beef with 1/3 cup diced onion, 1/2 cup tomato juice, 2 tbs tomato soup, egg (beaten), 1/3 cup cooked rice, salt and pepper to taste.
For sauce: one 8oz. can tomato juice, remaining can tomato soup, 1 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs lemon juice, 2 tsp worcestershire sauce.
Wrap heaping spoon full of meat into leaf and wrap. Lay rolls over bed of leaves and cover with most of sauce then lay extra leaves over wraps and lightly cover those with the remaining sauce. ( this will prevent them from burning ). Bake 350 degrees for about 40-50 min.

This was a very good recipe, however, I did follow some of the other suggestions like using tomato juice in the meat mixture and using tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and worchestershire sauce instead of the tomato soup. I would also use the cinnamon as suggested on yet another review, because it gave the rolls the flavor that I remember from my childhood. Overall it is a bit time consuming, but well worth it and my family loved the outcome, voting it a "keeper".

MMmMmmMMmm just finished too many plates of this. Thank You for teaching me the secret of peeling off the leaves by boiling and pulling off one at a time.  After that, I skipped the egg to hold rice and hamburger together and had to cook way more filling to go with all the leaves I was able to pull.  The sauce needed help.  Added tomato paste and 2 cups of water, along with some brown sugar, vinegar and wooster as suggested by others. I can't give exact measurements, but it was as good if better than I remember....will make again and again

This was the first time that I've made stuffed cabbage rolls and they turned out really well. I added a small can of v-8, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder to the ground beef mixture. I also chopped up some of my leftover cooked cabbage and mixed that in with the ground beef and rice. I used boil-in -bag brown rice and boiled it in beef broth for extra flavor. I was able to fit 4 rows of 3 rolls in a 9x13 baking dish. I poured a can of tomato sauce on the bottom and poured 1 can of tomato soup plus one can of crushed tomatoes on top to keep everything moist. Covered it with foil, baked for 1 1/2 hrs.

My Mom has been gone for several years and I've been trying to find a recipe for cabbage rolls like she used to make.  I tried this today and it was great!  I boiled my cabbage leaves and they worked great.  I remember her saying that freezing them would cause them to be limp and not taste as good.  Thanks for a great memory of something my Mom used to make.

JUST WANTED TO THROW ANOTHER VARIATION I'VE BEEN MAKING FOR YEARS. PUT A LAYER OF DRAINED SAUERKRAUT IN CASSEROLE, TOP WITH ROLLS, AND PUT MORE SAUERKRAUT. PUT V8 JUICE OVER.  THE LONGER THIS COOKS THE BETTER.  AND THE MORE TIMES YOU REHEAT AND EAT FOR LEFTOVERS, EVEN BETTER!!

These were delicious! We did follow some of the suggestions to use tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, and to add a bit of oregano to the meat mixture. In the future, it wouldn't hurt to add some more rice to the mixture as well. Apart from the long prep time (which took far longer than the hour they say), this recipe is great, and I would definately make it again. (we served them with pierogies for an authentic Polish experience!)

Excellent base recipe.  Good for leftover rice.  Used 1 can of condensed tomato soup and 1 large can of crushed oregano, basil, garlic tomato.  I added a 1/4 tsp of oregano to meat mixture and substituted 1/4 cup of Egg Starts(meat surprisingly held together well).  I would definitely make this again, but with maybe more oregano and maybe garlic powder.  I also like my tomato sauce on this a little sweeter, so I'll be adding a bit of sugar next time.  But overall they came out delicious and very presentable.

Very easy recipe to follow. I doubled the recipe, using one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes, then baked at 350 for 1 hr covered with tin foil.  Still turned out pretty good.

This really made my husband happy.  He is always asking for stuffed cabbage and I am always saying it is too much work, but this was a very easy and delicious recipe and I will most definitely be making this again.  I added some spaghetti sauce because there didn't seem to be enough soup and I cooked it for about an hour.

This was totally what I was looking for.  Had 3 heads of cabbage ready to something with in my garden -- made a HUGE batch of these and froze them for "ready to cook meals".  We thawed some the other day and cooked them -- DELICIOUS!  I great comfort food served with mashed potatoes.  Even the kids inhaled them!

These were definitely the best on the first day.  Somehow, the meat in the leftovers got a little dry and tough.  But my hubbie loved it and he HATES cabbage!

Great recipe.  However, I suggest not cutting out the big "vein" but rather slicing it down, hard to explain, horizontally, to make it more the thickness of the cabbage leaves.  Much easier to roll the cabbage rolls this way.  Almost like shaving  cheese or a prosciutto.  Better.  It helps to have a Mom of Russian heritage.  :)

Very good. My husband loved it. Much easier than I expected. Took me a couple tries to get the wrapping right. This worked great for me: put the meat mixture close to the end of the leaf - opposite from the stem; give it one turn; fold both ends in; roll until stem end is on top; put toothpick through the stem end. Once I figured this out it was super easy.

This is a great recipe as it is. However, I have tried rolling the meat mixture in collard greens too. Both are great!!

Made this recipe as written but I used an extra tomato soup so I could have  a bit more sauce. My first time making stuffed cabbage using tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. Tastes SO much better. Even my Italian born husband loved it this way, and as most people know, Italians are usually very picky about their tomato sauce. I will make my stuffed cabbage this way from now on. GREAT recipe that I will probably make again next week as I am already craving more. I also cooked mine in a crockpot so I was able to come home from work to a delicious meal ready to eat.

Instead of soup I used two cups of crushed tomatoes mixed with two tablespoons lemon juice, two tablespoons brown sugar and two teaspoons Worcestershire sauce based on other suggestions.    I used large outer leaves to line bottom of pan, and extra leaves on top.   Covered and baked at 350 for one hour.   Very tasty!

It was a Polish dinner night at our house!  I baked them in the oven instead of using the stove top method described.  350-degrees for approx. 45 min.  I also laid additional cabbage leaves over the rolls before putting them in the oven.  Covered with foil for the last 1/2 of baking time.  I, too, added to the tomato soup as others did...Worcestershire  sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice and pepper/salt.  Mashed potatoes and beets for side dishes.  We like it!

Good recipe although as a personal preference, I use V-8 (low sodium if your watching salt intake), adds lots of flavor and it's good for you!

I am not a fan of cabbage, but my husband's grandma always made corned beef and cabbage for him on St. Patrick's Day.  After she passed, I wanted to make something for him, but I knew better than to attempt to make the same thing she did.  So I chose these for him.  He LOVED it!  Instead of freezing or using boiling water, I separated the leaves of the cabbage, placed them in my steamer, and steamed them for 10 minutes. It worked like a charm--soft, flexible leaves that didn't tear when I attempted to fill them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really delicious. Add a second can of tomato soup for the sauce.
BTW: Leftover hamburger filling makes excellent burgers on the grill!

This is my moms recipe too. I believe she would have used tomato sauce but some time had a can of tomato soup on hand so with seasoning both sauces are great. Mine are in the oven right now too. I had planed on putting them in a crock pot but 50 yrs ago my mom always had a big roaster full in the oven so today I was home and did them in the oven too. I also spray the baking dish with olive oil and place the extra leaves on top and bottom too. 
Anyway , they are great with sour cream and a glass of red wine.  By the way, when u was a kid I always knew that we would have a big roaster of cabbage rolls the next day when I saw a big pile of separated cabbage leaves under a white flour sack cloth wilting down over night.  Kudos to poppy too we called them Holubsi too!

Amazing! My husband was born and raised in Poland and I tried this recipe hoping it would meet his standards....after adding a few things such as using tomato sauce and diced tomatoes instead of the soup and adding a little garlic; he said it was very, very good! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my list of go to dinners! Thanks!

Last night was my second attempt at cabbage rolls after a horrible failure the first time.  I made this recipe pretty much exactly as written and the cabbage rolls were seriously delicious!  Next time I would season the meat a little more with lemon juice, Worcestershire and some garlic powder.  I might also make my own sauce as I'm not overly fond of canned soup. An excellent and fairly quick recipe!

I've never made anything like this before so working with cabbage like this was new to me. everyone ate it including my 3 yr old. We will be adding it to our go to list of hamburger recipes:) on a side note I wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook the hamburger before or not so I didn't leave it raw but mostly cooked. If anyone has done it raw and it worked out please let me know.

AWESOME!!  This is very tasty and scores real high points with family and friends. The only thing I did differently, was, I omitted the egg, and added a small can of mushrooms(stems & pieces) and a 14 oz can of spaghetti sauce, to the rice and groundbeef mixture, instead of the tomato soup. I did however use the tomato soup, to pour over the cabbage rolls, after placing them in the pan, for the oven. That gives the cabbage rolls an awesome tomato flavor. *** Just a Note*** Make sure to not over cook the cabbage leaves. They only need a few minutes in the boiling water, to make them soft. If you over cook them, they may tare when you take them out to drain. I would suggest about 4 minutes maximum, after the water begins to boil. The leaves are suppose to be soft enough to roll the mixture in, but firm enough to hold the shape, once the rolls are stuffed. Also, as a tip, instead of trying to pull the cabbage leaves off the head first ( as that might tare them up becasue the leaves are so brittle) you can put the whole head of cabbage in water, bring the water to a slow boil , and you can see and can feel that the leaves would drop away from the head, with ease.This is just awesome. I know it takes alittle time to prepare, but believe me, it is so worth it. GOOD LUCK !!!   &   BON APPETITE!!!

I love this recipe! It can be a bit time consuming, but it makes a lot and everyone always loves it! I use pasta sauce instead of tomato soup, but other than that, I follow the recipe as is. I also bake it at 350 for 1 hour. To keep the rolls from sticking to the pan, I put down a layer of sauce then line the pan with cabbage leaves. Works like a charm!

Reminds me of hunting deep in the Allegheny forest. This was a deer camp staple that never failed to satisfy and warm you up when you returned half frozen from the woods! I multiply this recipe and use an electric roaster. This is perfect for large gatherings. A buffet favorite that will make you a star!

I baked it in the oven for about 45 minutes instead of using the stove.  I love the tomato soup sauce (I added about 1/4 cup water to the soup).  I'm not a fan of tomato sauce on my stuffed cabbage so the tomato soup was perfect-I might add a little more pepper the next time, but other than that it was perfect!

I remember my mother making this as a child.  I had never made them myself until my husband & I were watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, and they had them on the show.  It brought back memories, so I decided to find a recipe.  I used this recipe, but didn't have any tomoto soup, so I used Progresso Basil & Tomato soup...it worked GREAT!!! Even my husband loved it and went back for seconds!!!

My Polish/Lithuanian husband LOVED these. There were easy to make; I did tweak just slightly. I used brown rice and added a splash of worcestershire sacue and 2 minced garlic cloves to the meat. For the sauce, I mixed 1 can of tomatoe sauce, 1 can of diced tomatoes drained, about 1 Tblsp of brown sugar and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I put this in the slow cooker on low for 5 hours, it came out perfect!

This was my first try at making stuffed cabbage rolls, and it was a home run!  I did use half hamburger and half pork sausage,  and added some chopped red and green peppers.  The most difficult part was trying to get the cabbage leaves off the head in one piece, they kept breaking so I put the whole head I the boiling water and then they began to come off easily.

These were great! My family loved them. I did blanch a whole head of cabbage to loosen the leaves I pulled them with a fork and threw them in a strainer and under cold water so stop them from cooking. Rather than cutting out the white part out of the cabbage I just made a slit because I like the crispiness! Also I add garlic just because I am a HUGE garlic fan. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these as written with the exception of using kielbasa instead of bacon.  Really great - love the broth, delicious with some fresh bread and butter!  I will be making these again and again, just without the bacon.

This was the first time I've ever made or eaten stuffed cabbage. And it was delicious!

The instructions didn't mention adding the water, so I forgot to, but it came out perfect anyway.

I wish I would have read some of the other reviews first, next time I am using tomato sauce instead of tomato soup!

I always find it amusing that many readers change the original recipe, so I decided to try it exactly as written. It was just so-so. I found the filling to be practically flavorless, and I highly suggest you put something else besides tomato soup on top. Should I decide to make this again, I will be changing and adding flavors.

I followed the recipe except where it called for the tomato soup, I substituted Marinara sauce. The tomato soup is way too sweet, imho, and throws off the taste of the cabbage.

I also used a lot more spices in the filling, including a dash of cumin, a large pinch of Italian spices and just a couple of scrapes of a whole nutmeg. If you aren't used to cooking with nutmeg, it's mind blowing how many things you can add it to that really make the dish. 

Best way to test, grate a little bit of nutmeg over plain sauce and give a taste. We just love it.

just like my mom makes, except she bakes them at 350 first hour
and reduce the oven to 300 for last half hour.
love the tomato soup, use Campbell because its the best.
she also uses 5 minute rice and just add to meat mixer, no cooking needed.
I also add a half can of tomato soup to the meat mixer.

While tasty, it was rather bland.  I will make it again, but I think I'll add different spices, and certainly more tomato sauce, maybe even Tabasco for flavor.  Just one more thing to try to make better in my kitchen!

I thought they were good,  never having stuffed cabbage rolls before, but it wasn't the family's favorite.  Husband ate most of them, but said I didn't have to make them again.

This was the first time I've ever made cabbage rolls and this recipe was awesome. I made a couple of healthy alternatives and additions but the basic recipe was great too. I used ground turkey instead of beef, brown rice instead of white and I added a can of stewed tomatoes to the mix. it was delicious and I will be making this again. Thank you so much!

I liked these. However, I didn't have eggs! So, I had to make do without the one, but they still came out alright! I used ground sirloin instead of beef, 'cause it's what I had on hand. While everything simmered, I threw a dash of red pepper flakes over it for a slight kick. Delish! Thanks, Judy.

Instead of beef and tomato soup, I used tofu and tomato sauce (trying to eat less meat)! I also added garlic powder, cayenne, beer, brown sugar, and lemon juice to the mix. I cooked my rolls in a rice cooker which makes the leaves really tender. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Made just a few modifications. 1. Omitted tomato soup and used a couple of spoonfuls of tomato sauce in the filling. 2. Also added some ground pork sausage in the filling. 3. Poured a can of stewed/diced tomatoes over the cabbage rolls to simmer. This busy working mom also doubled the filling. I froze the other half of the filling to make stuffed peppers with later (add some shredded cheese and done!). I love shortcuts to home cooking! Toothpicks are fun, but they were not necessary here.

Yum!  I make every meal I find on here veg friendly, (usually still with eggs though).  However, this was great using the ground beef substitute by Morning Star (in frozen section at any grocers).  Eggs can be replaced with Ener-G Egg Replacer if you needed to (this is available at Whole Foods and any specialty grocer).

This is SO good! I did half tomato soup and half cream of mushroom soup to make the sauce creamier. I also added worcestershire sauce and lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer (I left out the brown sugar). Very very yummy!

I make a recipe "like" this, it came from my great grandma. I use equal amounts of veal and pork. (I usually make 3 pounds of meat because they freeze wonderful) I also use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup and add 1 cup of vinegar. They are fantastic!!!

These were really good! I, too, added garlic. I used the tomato soup, but I also used half a jar of spaghetti sauce becasue without it there would have been way too little sauce for our taste. Thanks for the recipe!

I grew up eating golabkas (attempt at Polish spelling and pronounced "go-wump-kees") and just loved them. I baked mine instead of stove top cooking them but my cabbage was rubbery and not soft. It's not the recipe's fault.. just wanted to give folks a heads-up that if you use old cabbage it could spoil this dish.

I have made this recipe for years with two exceptions.  The rice does not have to be cooked and I brown two pieces of country style spare ribs and add to rolls while cooking with 2 cans of tomato soup with some cabbage water. This is so good!!

My husband loves cabbage in any form so this was definitely a hit.  IDK if we need to boil the leaves longer or cook it longer, they were a little tough but still yum!  We added crushed red pepper to kick up the spice!

These are darn good. I cooked them for a large group (made 80) and the prep went surprisingly fast. There is a method of folding the cabbage around the stuffing. The key ingredient here is the quality of the beef. I used 80 percent lean ground chuck. Another method would be to buy lean beef and grind it in a food processor yourself. Yum.

This was delicious, though it might be less kid-friendly.  I cooked the beef first about half-through and drained the grease.  Also I found that the can of soup was only about 2/3 of what I wanted... I don't like a lot of sauce, but even still I wound up short.  I used spaghetti sauce at a pinch and it worked out just fine.

The cabbage rolls were not bad, just a little bland for our taste. I think it would be a good recipe for kids,  but not for two adults.  Also, they were very mushy left over, and virtually inedible.

I am very pleased with this recipe. For a long time I've been looking for a sauce like this for my stuffed cabbage and peppers as I much prefer the ketchuppy sauce to a spaghetti sauce on these two recipes and it never occurred to me to use tomato soup. I did find it wasn't quite enough sauce as well so I did add a little leftover spaghetti sauce to it which made it great. I prefer to make mine with a combination of ground beef and italian sausage.

This was good, but seemed to be missing something. Next time I may add some vinegar so it's a bit tangy.

My Polish family has been making this recipe forever and it's always a big hit! I use more onion, fresh garlic and recently started using brown rice. I don't use toothpicks or string, I just roll in the leaf and put the seam side down.  My  90 yr old mother doesn/t roll them at all, she makes meatballs, cuts the cabbage and puts on top, then covers with tomato soup.  Still delicious and less work.

Similar to the way my mom made but she used tomato paste instead of soup.  Also, she steamed the cabbage leaves over a pot of boiling water and removed them one by one as she stuffed and wrapped the cabbage.  I believe this is the old Russian way since she was an old Russian.

This recipe was prepared by my grandmother ever since I can remember. She gave us this exact same recipe years ago. I am delighted to see it here. It is the best our family has ever had. We LOVE these and we call them Pigs in the Blanket. I don't know why but that is what Grandma always called them. I encourage anyone to make them, you wont be disappointed. Quida this is for you and I hope you are able to find other recipes here you love.

Only because I've actually had ones better from a campfire (but it would be 5 stars if not for that camping trip).  I used mushroom spaghetti sauce per my husband's request. I cooked the meat and rice before-hand (I have trouble with directions lol) and added the egg when it cooled. I've never made these so I had to youtube a how to on rolling the cabbages. It was a lot easier than I thought and they tasted wonderful! I also used a bit of onion soup mix instead of onion like another user suggested. My husband said it put his mom's to shame ;)

This was my first time making stuffed cabbage rolls. They turned out awesome. Everyone enjoyed them!!! I did alter it a bit. I used ground turkey instead. I am not the best at making regular rice so I used the brown rice in the bag. I also used Ragu sautéed onion and garlic sauce and spruced it up a little bit and added basil and a little sugar to the sauce (to take away the tart flavor). It turned out delicious!!!!!

These turned out ok. I'm not a big fan of stuffed cabbage rolls, but my hubby likes them, which is why I made them. I added some extra seasoning to the meat (garlic, Worcestershire sauce). As for the 8 cabbage leaves...I have no idea how to manage that. I had a huge head of cabbage, but I had to cut out so much of the hard, veiny sections, that it took way more than 8 leaves, and I was piecing them together as I went. Overall, I think these are a pain to make, but this recipe is as good as any other I've ever tried for them.

The main ingredients are fine except I don't use egg and add some garlic powder and onion powder. For the tomato sauce I use one can tomato soup (two if your making a large tray) and one can of stewed or diced tomatoes seasoned with basil or oregano and my secret ingredient is brown sugar, add to the tomato stuff. They usually taste best the second day, so if you make them, bake them and reheat the next day for nice soft piggies.

Awesome!  We added garlic and jalapeno to the meat, 1/2 can rotel tomatoes to the soup, lined the pan with cabbage leaves, poured the soup mixture over the rolls and topped with cabbage leaves, then baked at 350 deg. for 1 hour.

I learned from my Polish mother to always use ground pork for this dish instead of ground beef.  The pork gives a much more tasty and moist texture.  And you don't want to add more than 1/3 cup uncooked rice to a pound of meat, or again, the finished product will be too firm and dry.

Sounds and looks delicious..This recipe is similar to a recipe that comes from my father's country, Ara ara Village in Israel. Instead of cabbage they use grape leaves but since it was difficult for my father to find grape leaves in our tropical island he used cabbage. He also doesn't use tomato sauce.. Good recipe!

If use pork instead of beef and add dill or time there is traditional romanian dish. We put aside polenta, sour cream (optional) and chili. Great at Christmas, with sour cabbage, but also at wedding parties. When we use fresh cabbage we add some citric acid in souce. Eggs is optional, rice is better uncooked, but in this case we add some extra water.

My Grandmother always cooked the rolls, put in the serving bowl and then added a cup of sour cream to the sauce.  Soo Good! She also made this using green peppers (red ones are sweeter) Then chop cabbage and put on top before cooking.  Easier and just as good.

Fabulous, but the leaves should be pre-cooked a little longer that the recipe calls for. I will do it for 15min next time. I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup and sprinkled them with crushed red pepper.

My mom has been making these for years. It's usually her new year's day meal (cabbage for good luck). We LOVE these and everyone who has ate them loves them too! :) Very very yummy. I add Italian seasoning to rolls and the tomato soup... It really MAKES the dish! Definitely add Italian seasoning!

These were good! I added worshishire sauce, brown sugar and a little lemon juice in with the tomato juice. I also added more tomato juice then called for. Also i put cabbage leaves on top of the rolls to keep them from burning. I will make this again!

Good recipe.  I made them like a comment mentioned making my own sauce w/ sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon but doubled it and added 1/2 c that to the meat mixture instead of 2 T sauce tomato soup.  Also, I did mine in the oven at 350 for about an hour.  Turned out good but will use more sauce next time.  Definitely will use this recipe again

This recipe was great!  I loved the flavor, I would say it takes more then an hour to prepare though.  I took the advice from another user and made the sauce with the brown sugar, tomato sauce, lemon juice, and Worcestershire. Also baked it at 350 no way is this long enough if you only par boil your cabbage for 4 min. my onions were even still hard.  I put it back in at 400 for another hour or so and it was perfect.

I used ground turkey instead of beef and added a green pepper (chopped) and some garlic. After baking in the oven for about 45 min. I sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top. This was my first time making stuffed cabbage but definitely not my last!

I grew up making this with ground beef, but since we had ground deer meat on hand we used that instead.  It was more healthy and a bit sweet from the deer meat.  This is now a house favorite.  Oh, after reading reviews on the cabbage, I decided to just nuke each head for a few minutes until it was tender enough to remove the leaves with ease after coring it.  That was the best time saving tip ever for this recipe! Thank you!

Easy to make (slow cooker) but not a fan of beef.  I like the ground pork version better.

My husband and I had never had this before, but I was looking for a new way to use ground turkey. I follwed the recipe exactly except I used ground turkey. It came out pretty good. We will make it again, but use 2 cans of soup and water so there is more sauce and I would put more soup in the mixture and add more seasoning. Really good base recipe. I recommend with a few changes.

I had never made cabbage rolls before, but my husband loves them so I tried this recipe and was really nervous.  It turned out great!!  Like other reviewers, I used additional tomato sauce.  I have made it several times since then, and have also substituted ground turkey for ground beef, and it tastes just as good!

yummy!! made this for dinner tonight it turned out awesome!! I didn't have tomato soup on hand so I blended a can of diced tomatoes and half a can of tomato puree to make my sauce. I also avoided using toothpicks by simply placing the cabbage rolls seam side down and it all turned out perfect.  I think tho next time I'll add some celery and fresh garlic and maybe some cumin for added flavor!! My fiance doesn't like cabbage but even he wiped his plate clean!! Thanks for posting!!

My mother made these when we were little-love them!  I did make some changes by adding some oregano to the meat/rice mixture and also 2 TBSP of medium hot salsa.  I used a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes for the bottom of the pan where the rolls will cook.  Then I covered the pan with foil and baked for 1-1/4 hrs.  With the remaining inner head of cabbage, I sliced it thickly and steamed it for a side veg along with boiled potatoes.  Garnish the cabbage rolls with sour cream and sauce the cabbage and potatoes with the tomato sauce...and a little sour cream. Very yummy!

This was my first time making cabbage rolls, I found it very hard to peel away the leaves without tearing them. It took alot longer than 4 minutes to boil before the leaves came off. Like alot of the other viewers I modified the recipe. I read the reviews and took their add ons to make mine. I added the brown sugar,lemon juice and worchester sauce and V8 to my sauce,with some salt and pepper. I lined the casserole with some extra leaves and baked in the oven at 350 for an hour and half. It turned out great!

I had alot of distractions while trying to make this so I cooked the rice dry and thought the whole thing was gonna be a bust.  Surprisingly, this recipe is very forgiving and turned out great.  The fam loved it.  Will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks!

I found this recipe easy and delicious. I do cook mine in the oven, though. I line my pan with some sauce and some cut up left over cabbage pieces. Keeps everything juicy.  Then place the rolls on top. I also parboil cabbage first to seperate leaves. Cover pan with tin foil when cooking.

Nothing special about this recipe. My mom makes it in a pot rather than a pan like this, and I like hers much better. The cabbage leaves stuck to the bottom of the pan and partially burned. There was not a lot of flavor and it just seemed like it was missing something.

I added a lot of seasoning but it was still very plain tasting. However traditionally the dish usually is. I used whole grain brown rice instead of white. It tastes just as good. I would definitely recommend the modifications to this recipe in the popular reviews.

Good basic recipe. I added 1 tsp. of red hot pepper flakes to the meat mixture and I wish I would have used 2 cans of soup. Not nearly the amount of sauce I would have liked.

Wow! These were terrific. I cooked them all day in the slow cooker, the aroma was amazing.
I altered the recipe only to better suit my own taste. I used ground pork, and browned it before stuffing the rolls. Instead of 2 tablespoons of tomato soup, I used half a can. I omitted the egg. I found myself using two cans of tomato soup to cover all the rolls.

Unlike other reviewers I found no need to add any other spices or sauces. These were terrific as they were!

I just had stuffed cabbage for the first time at a polish restaurant a couple of weeks ago and thought I'd try to make them myself.  These tasted pretty close--I followed suggestions and added 1/4 of an onion, 4 cloves of garlic, a cup and a half of brown rice (cooked) and worchestershire sauce to the meat. Used two cans of tomato sauce (one with seasoning the other without) and a tbs tomato paste with garlic, a couple more cloves of garlic, more worchestershire sauce, a tbs brown sugar and a tbs lemon juice for the sauce which I poured over the top of the rolls.  I baked them in the oven covered with foil (9 x 13 pan)with a little sauce on the bottom for 45 minutes.  They were tasty but the cabbage was still a little crunchy.  I also microwaved the cabbage head for 10 minutes to make separating the leaves easier.  It was a LOT of prep and it's definately not something I will be making often, just due to time.  But all in all, pretty good.

If you use 8o% lean ground beef, you can mix uncooked rice with the meat and it will plump up while cooking.  I also add a can of diced tomatos to the tomato soup to dilute it a bit.  These will be the best cabbage rolls you will ever eat!  They are delicious with mashed potatos.

This was really good but it needed more tomato gravy, next time I'll add another can of tomato soup.  I used instant rice and I sauteed the ground beef with an extra 1/4 c. of chopped onion and I added lots of extra pepper, some cayenne as well as some basil and oregano.  These were quite tasty and I will make them again.

I rated this a 4 star, because it's an OK recipe, but there is just not enough flavor for me.  Also the bottom of the cabbage rolls burned, if I made them again I would make extra sauce, use a lot more seasoning, and turn the cabbage rolls while cooking.

Since this recipe lacks a bit in flavor for my taste, I can only rate it a 4. On my own I added celery and minced garlic and now,  for me,  it is a 5 star. I used my crock pot for this and I honestly think they are the best cabbage rolls I have ever tasted! The presentation was beautiful and I appreciate the recipe submitter for sharing how to make these!

EXCELLENT- from a good polish girl.  I changed a couple of things, brown rice, ham/pork mix and added chopped red and yellow peppers.  In sauce with slow cooker, in addition to tomato soup, i also add 2 dashes hot sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup.

This was ok, a basic recipe. I did take another reviewers suggestions of baking the rolls while lining the pan and topping the rolls with the extra cabbage leaves as well as using another sauce besides plain tomato soup. First time at making cabbage rolls and I will probably make them again but I am going to keep looking for something with a little more flavor using a "knock-out" sauce.

this recipe was great! i added basil and garlic to it.the tomato soup is a great flavor enhancer and cooking in a frying pan made it seem quicker and easier to get it together and to get it cooking.

This was good although, I did "spice" it up a bit.  First I added celery to the ground beef mixture and some red pepper flakes.  I also added a touch of brown sugar and vinegar to the tomato soup. I will be making this again.

This was pretty good!  Mum used to make us this stuff when she was a poor single parent!  (so I recently found out!)  I did add a few herbs to the mince (ground beef!) mixture for a bit of a boost & used a bottled tomato relish in the mince instead of a bit of soup.  I used the whole can of soup to cover it.  I was surprised how tasty it was really as I expect the soup to be overpowering but it was good.  We will have it again I am sure!  On poor days!  lol

This was sooo easy to make, and delicious! I used 1/3 cup of uncooked long grain rice and it came out perfect. I also cooked mine in the oven at 350 for about and hour and a half. Used the extra leaves on the top and the bottom, and made twice as much sauce by adding diced tomatoes. As per other reviewers I also added basil and oregano to the meat and sauce.  Very yummy, thanks for the post.

I love this recipe! I really don't eat red meat. (Dieting) so I subsituted the ground beef for ground turkey and with the onion and soup you can't tell. Also I added to the tomato soup crushed tomatos with spices. But this is really simple to make and freeze the leftovers.

I thought this recipe was quite good. I took other reviewers suggestions and used spagetti sauce instead of the soup. I also added lemon to the sauce and red pepper flakes and worcestershire to the stuffing. I like my food really spicy so I also added a bit of cayenne pepper. Doubling the sauce also ensured the meat didn't turn out dry.

The meat inside the rolls turned out quite dry.  These were not fantastic in my opinion.  I will continue searching for a good stuffed cabbage recipe.

Excellent.  I used ground pork versus beef for a different flavor (preference only) -- and it worked out great.  During the last 2 minutes of cooking, I raised the heat just a tad to slightly "caramelize" some of the soup directly beneath the rolls, giving a bit of a sweeter flavor...  Great recipie.

Because of my ethnic background, I decided to try this recipe.  It lacked something which I found to be onions.  Believe it or not, I used 1/2 lbs. of onion, chopped and sauteed til softened cooled and added to ground chuck instead of lean beef and instead of 1/3 cup of rice per pound, I used 1/4 cup rice UNcooked.  Instead of tomato soup, I used ketchup and water to just about cover.  From the l pound of ground meat, this recipe yielded 15 rolls. Drew a lot of compliments from the family.

This was my first time making cabbage rolls, and I was surprised at how easy this was.  I didn't add rice to the beef mixture (hubby's on a low carb craze) and just added garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I baked mine, and added one can of tomato sauce and half a jar of spaghetti sauce with peppers and onion.  Baked it at 350 until the meat was done.  Topped it with some parmesean cheese.  My family really enjoyed this.  Thanks for the recipe Judy!

The first time I prepared this recipe I took a gamble that it was be as good as everyone raved and doubled the recipe to I'd have plenty of leftovers.
It was well worth it! Even the hubby, who is not a big cabbage fan, went back for thirds.
While I doubled the recipe, I tripled the soup (I like lots of sauce) and added on can of beer as one reviewer recommended (I used Red Dog). If it's good enough for LMG1115's polish grandmother, it's good enough for me! :) And believe you me, it was GOOD!

A great and simple recipe for cabbage rolls.  To cut down on prep time, I used minute rice.  Also, I added minced garlic to the beef mixture and 1 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp lemon juice to the sauce. I added generous amounts of spaghetti sauce over top.  It won't look very "saucy" at first, but as the beef cooks, a lot of liquid forms in the pan and simmers while it cooks. Like others suggested, I cooked mine in covered 9x13 pan at 350F for about an hour and it turned out perfectly.  It is definately a recipe I will keep, and will probaby replace the old and time-consuming one I had before.  Try it, it's great!

1st Try: Used brown rice (cooked 25 min with 1 cup water) and added a sm. can of tomato sauce to the soup - too tomato-ey. Also added some breakfast sausage to the burger b/c I needed to use it up, but I wouldn't recommend it. Overall it was pretty good, but it didn't taste quite like I think cabbage rolls should. Next time I'll stick closer to the recipe and more rice.

2nd try: Much better! My husband said "I could eat this every day" - I thought it was still a little bland, so I'll be working on that. I stuck to the recipe except used 1/2 cup dry brown rice cooked in water w/beef bullion. I still need to experiment with the cooking time and amt. of water on the rice, will try 1c. water cooked for 20 minutes next time.

For the poster who wanted to know how to get the leaves off the cabbage, I cut a square straight down into the cabbage around the core, then pull the leaves off from the bottom. Works much better than trying from the top!

I make this all the time on the stove top in a covered 12 inch saute pan. Bring to a boil then low simmer for about 40 minutes. I do add a teaspoon of garlic powder to the meat and I use a 3 to 1 ratio of beef to pork. I also add a tablespoon of cider vinegar and a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce along with 5 or 6 ounces of tomato juice.

Very good. Our cabbage was a bit tough and just slightly bitter, but still pretty good all in all.  It needs some more seasoning... maybe caraway and dill. Also, it looks like the “false cabbage rolls” recipe on allrecipes is the same, but with sliced cabbage instead of cabbage rolls... much easier, so I will try that. (But the rolled presentation is definitely fancier!). P.s. the cabbage softened up and bitterness disappeared when the rolls were reheated the next day in the microwave.

Good basic recipe.  I oven cook mine @350 for hour and a half.
Also add sliced mushrooms.  Big can of tomato soup.  ( makes good "gravy over the rolls)  Be sure to season well with garlic, salt and pepper.  Learned how to from Grandma (Russian) 55 years ago!~  Don't change perfection!  Also need some fresh bakery bread.  For God's sake cook the  rice!  (the rice needs water to cook.  The guy that wondered why his rolls were "dry?"  and used raw rice, well "DUH!"

Came together easily. Used savoy cabbage and trimmed the stems. The filling needs a flavor boost, a little crispy bacon would help. I added an equal amount of clamato juice as tomato soup and it worked nicely. Bake the rolls in the oven in a casserole dish, tightly covered in foil for one hour at 350 degrees.

YES , I DID I MAKE THEM ALL  TIME.   I MAKE  THEM A LITTLE DIFFERENT.   JUST A LITTLE TWEAK  IN THE RECIPE.  I USE MINUTE RICE AND SAUTE THE ONION WHICH ARE YELLOW ONIONS NOT RED. RED ONES ARE FOR SALADS.   ALSO I USE 2 STICKS OF BUTTER TO SAUTE THE ONIONS 1ST.   I HAVE ALL OF MY INGREDIENCE  IN A BOWL.  1ST. I USE PORK VEAL AND HAMBURGER MEAT THIS KEEPS  THE CABBAGE ROLLS VERY MOIST THE I ADD SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE ALSO GARLIC POWDER AND ONION POWDER ALSO JUST A LITTLE THEN I ADD THE WARM COOKED ONIONS 2 BIG ONIONS. CHOPPED . WITH THE MEAT AND RICE AND SPICES.  THEN I TAKE THE CABBAGE ROLLS AND CUT A LITTLE PIECE OFF THE TOP OF THE LEAF THE HARD PART  I ADD EVERYTHING A BOUT A TABLE SPOONFUL IN THE CABBAGE AND ROLL THEM.   PUT ANY TOUR CABBAGE LEAVES THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN OR DISH YOU ARE GOING TO COOK THEM IN.  FILL  THE POT WITH THEM ADD YOUR TOMATO SOUP DO NOT USE SPAGHETTI SAUCE THEY DO NOT COME OUT THE SAME.    I  ABOUT 4-5 DOZEN OF THEM AT ONE TIME.   MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVES THEM .   THE WHOLE TRICK TO THEM IS TO COOK THE ONIONS IN BUTTER NOT MARGARINE OF OIL JUST BUTTER.  THIS IS WHAT GIVES THEM THE FLAVOR AND GOODNESS.  

THANK YOU,   MRS. R. BENZ

This is just like my polish grandmother's recipe, except we add a 1/4 cup ketchup to the tomato soup with about a 1/2 can of water to make the sauce.  Gives it a little zip.
I also make them with some ground pork added to the ground beef.  Since I make a huge batch, I triple this recipe, and used 2 lbs. beef to 1 lb pork.  We boil the whole cabbages and take off the outer leaves as they are soft.  Put back in the boiling water and continue  until all the cabbage is soft.  Pare down the hard end of the leaf of cabbage.
You can cook them in the oven also.  A large batch takes about 2 hrs. at 350.  I test one by cutting it open to see if they are done.  Cover the rolls with extra cabbage leaves so as not to dry out the tops.  They freeze well after baking.  Better the 2nd day when warmed up.  Serve with dark rye bread and butter.  Yum.

I have made it twice, once exactly as recipe stated.  These turned out really really well, we like them not so saucy and they reminded of my grandmother's.  The second time I was looking for a way to use up leftovers from a Mexican dinner and decided to be adventurous.  I used taco-flavored meat, spanishrice, Rotel tomatoes with green chilis mixed with mild enchilada sauce and 4-cheese mexican shredded cheese along with onion and  pepper (lots of salt in other ingredients).  Also this time, I used the microwave method for the cabbage.  Cooked for 1-1/2 hours at 350.  Wow!  They were totally different and my grandson, who hates cabbage and loves tacos, ate two of them (he's 3}.  Totally different take on the normal cabbage roll, but really great in its own way.

Changes I made were boiling whole head of cabbage in water to make leaves looser, using sauce recommended by another user (tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce) and bake in the oven at 350 for an hour.  I made this for my husband as it was a childhood favorite and he said the filling was good but the cabbage wasn't soft enough and that he thinks his mom used to make it in the slow cooker.  I wish there had been instructions for the slow cooker, maybe it would've turned out better.

A great starter recipe leaving room for personal improvements.  First time I made cabbage rolls and they turned out just fine.   My wife always compares my recipes to her mothers.  This came very close  but we'll adjust it slightly next time.  It's been suggested to increase the amount of cabbage wrap and not to pack the stuffing so tight.   I can live with that!  The flavor went over extremely well.  Great recipe.

Soooo delicious!  I followed some of the comments and added some San Marzano crushed tomatoes to the soup.  I added some of that to the meat & rice mixture along with a squeeze of half a lemon, a couple of dashes of Worcestershire, a clove of chopped garlic, and a healthy dash of S & P.  I also made sure the tomato sauce & canned tomato mixture was adequately salted.  No sugar!  Yuk.  ??.  In the stovetop pan, I warmed a couple of T of olive oil, added enough tomato sauce to cover the pan, arranged the stuffed cabbage and poured the remaining sauce over all.  I also used the idea of putting the raw cabbage leaves in the microwave for about 2-2 1/2 minutes.  Super delicious! I cheated since time was short and used precooked brown rice from the store.  No one would ever guess.  Thank you!

I am Ukrainian and recently on a plant based diet"
I use quinoa with the brown rice.
I use onions , celery, carrots, garlic and red sweet peppers , sautéed and added to the rice. I roast the cabbage rolls in tomato sauce and a. Little carnation milk to really sweeten the cabbage. My husband could eat them every day, he never tires of them.

My husband & son really liked this.  In addition to a can of tomato soup I added another reviewers recipe for their own sauce (tomato sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, &  worcestershire sauce).  I would add more rice next time.

Made about 12 rolls with 1.2 lbs. meat. (Filled a 9x13 Pyrex dish with the cabbage rolls.) Definitely recommend the parboiling method first to remove the cabbage leaves. Remember to trim thick vein in the middle of the cabbage before rolling. Did not need toothpicks to roll. Doubled the sauce using 1 can tomato soup and one can tomato sauce. Added 1 tbsp. Worcester sauce and 1 tbsp. brown sugar as recommended by others. Baked in oven for 1 1/2 hours covered with aluminum foil. Worked out great!

My mother made this exact recipe for 50 years God Bless her. I make it and would not change anything. By the way cooking it in a sauce pot makes everything a lot more sweet and moist.This is old school cabbage rolls!

This is a basic recipe. Try a few changes, saute onion in butter til translucent. use mixture of meat like for meatloaf (lean beef, pork and/ or veal) use broth to cook rice. Tomato sauce instead of soup. Cook in oven or slow cooker. In summer   do not boil leaves, instead core head of cabbage, wrap and place in freezer. Allow to thaw then trim thick rib and never use toothpicks or string. wrap meat in leaf. line bottom of pan with leftover cabbage and place roll with loose end down. top with remainder  unused  cabbage and top with tomato sauce bake.

My grandmother was from Hungary and my mother learned to make these and I learned from her.  I add tomato sauce and Hungarian paprika.  And instead of regular cabbage I use savoy cabbage.  It taste better than the regular cabbage which tends to be stronger tasting.  I also started using my slow cooker. Sometimes I use a mixture of pork , veal and beef for the meat.

Add green peppers to the meat mixture and garlic powder.  Use a good marinara spaghetti sauce like Newman's Own Sockarooni.  The larger dark leaves of the cabbage gives them a nice crunch.

Very good recipe.  I too use tomato soup.  But, I add a little white vinegar.  Not really sweet/sour, but, it's quite delicious.   Also, when I'm pressed for time, I make meatballs out of the hamburger mixture and lay them on top of the cabbage leaves.  This is just more free form, but it tastes the same and is way less work.

I make this dish 2-3 times a year but I don't put tomato sauce in the meat. For the sauce I use tomato paste, sour cream and flour to make sauce thicker. I combine it with chicken or beef broth and add some salt and pepper to taste.

I made i just as it was written.  The next time I would add more soup, it was a bit dry.  However for such a simple recipe and such a quick recipe, it was wonderful.

It was easy to make but the beef mix lacked flavor.  Added a little beef bouillon and more tomato soup than was specified.  Oh yeah also added some worstershere sauce and some Mexican blend cheese.  Everyone loved them and they all went. Would have given a higher rating if I did not have to add so many items for ther to be some flavor. Sorry.

I made this and it turned out well with lots of flavor, something it could not possibly had without the additions of additional spices. I used ground mustard, crushed rosemary and garlic.
It's a good basic recipe that really needs tweaking.

Just like my mom used to make! I boil the whole cabbage head for 4-6 minutes after I core it and they come right off without breaking. Next time I'm going to try to make my own sauce like some reviewers do.

A decent basic recipe for cabbage rolls, however the can of tomato soup need spices in order to give the whole meal more flavour.

I grew up eating these with the tomato soup from my Mother. I do add some crushed or diced stewed tomatoes to the sauce for a bit of body.  All I can say is childhood memories every time I make these.  I also bake them at 350` for about 45 minutes.  I do cut out the major rib in the bottom center of the cabbage leaf for easier rolling.  I also do the boil leaf as that is how I grew up and something so simple just to me adds to the experience!! I love to cook!!

I love how simple this was to make. It was delicious. I will make it again.  I like more sauce so next time I will use two cans of soup. I was not good at wrapping them so that will take a bit of practice.
update... I made it again with two cans of soup and I was happy I did. it was perfect, I wont change a thing!!!This reminds me of my Grandma Irene!

Thanks so much for sharing your recipe! This is almost  the same recipe my mom had used for years. When she passed away...I sadly learned this was one of those recipes she never wrote down. So glad this was the recipe I tried! The only thing I did was also add to the tomato soup a 15oz can of tomato sauce and I doubled this recipe. I remember mom always adding tomato sauce to the soup before pouring it on top of the rolled cabbage.
It was delish and just wish I had more left over! Everyone loved it!

This works! It is pretty much how my Ukrainian grandma made cabbage rolls--including the canned soup. You can substitute regular tomato sauce and a teaspoon or two of sugar to mimic the soup.

My Mother made this recipe when I was growing up and I often made it for my family. We did not pre cook the rice though and we spooned yogurt on the open rolls at the table.   We also used a large can of tomatoes and cooked it on top of the stove.

I am in my eighties and now do rolled cabbage for my self and friends.

Yum, yum, yum!  These are wonderful! My husband would not try them due to the cabbage, but I removed the outside and put on a plate with sauce and he said they were the best "meat balls" he had eaten in a long time.  The rest of the family loved them as is.

This is a great recipe that I have used for several years.   I just use Tomato soup on the top - works well and 3 - 4 strips of uncooked bacon, it give a great bacon flavor to the cabbage rolls but watch that the top of the cabbage does not burn when cooking them.I make triple the recipe and make enough cabbage rolls to freeze for my two daughters homes, and for myself for christmas.  Make sure you cover them well with foil when you place in the freezer.

Just made this for dinner and it is great. I substituted garlic salt for regular salt and fresh ground pepper. My kids loved even though it was my first time making it and their first time eating it. Also I used marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.

Very similar to how my mother made it 60 years ago and I have for 45 years. I add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, a tablespoon or so of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of salt to the sauce. Those flavors combine with the cabbage and beef which makes a dish my family loves.

Easy to make and tastes great!  I had to make my own soup because I can't have gluten, but I made a quick soup with a can of tomato sauce, broth, and potato flour.  I also like a little more rice in my stuffing.

Yum! I've never had cabbage rolls before, but had leftover cabbage from St. Patty's day that I needed to use. We'll be making these again! The only change I made was, like other reviewers, I added garlic powder and worcestershire to the meat mixture and added a can of crushed tomatoes to the sauce. I also could only fit 7 rolls in my baking dish, so I had a little bit of meat mixture left over, which I mixed into the sauce to pour over. Baked them at 350* for an hour. My three year old even ate it, cabbage and all!

I noticed that people went so far off this recipe and then rated it.  The only thing I did different was to add an extra tomato soup can.  I liked it a lot for being so simple and easy.  I mean, you can't expect a cabbage roll to be restaurant quality or anything, but for good home cooking, nice reicpe!

I didn't have any tomato soup so I used 2 - 8oz cans of tomato sauce 2 Tblsp brown sugar and 1 tap of Wircestershire sauce. Mixed together and spooned over the cabbage rolls just like in the original recipe. So yummy. Next time I'll try the tomato soup, much easier.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe for stuffed cabbage.  I have made this recipe several times with a couple of variations.  I use ground turkey instead of the beef however, this can lead to a dry inside.  For this reason I make smaller rolls ending up with 10-12 rolls instead of 8.  I also use two cans of tomato soup and add some water to the pan while it's cooking to help it stay moist.  This also helps with storage and re-heating.

Instead of using tomatoes, we simmered them in beef broth for 40 min and then fried them in butter.

Yummy! We LOVED these. My husband had never tried cabbage rolls and now we made them twice this week. The second time, we had leftover diced tomatoes so we used those instead of the tomatoe soup - they were just as delicious! I would like to note that we made about 20 rolls with the filling mixture....Maybe we had a really small cabbage..?? I'm not sure but they tasted delicious & that's all that matters to us!!

My family has been making this since their days in Ukraine. If you're worried about fat, DON'T MAKE IT! LOL  The best way to make this is with ground pork or 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork. The meat is much more flavorful and moist. Also, this recipe does not use bread crumbs or corn flake crumbs (I use corn flakes crumbs). It will be very dry ad crumbly if you don't use some sort of crumbs. You cut the bottom of the cabbage off to access the leaves (someone complained they couldn't get the leaves off the cabbage lol). Use lots of pepper, an entire onion and try some pasted garlic, just a little. Also, I use V-8 low sodium for the sauce. Don't be afraid to try different things and make the recipe your own!

Try adding some garlic & Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. It live a it up a bit & adds lots of flavor. The traditional way of steaming the cabbage leaves a texture that you'd expect with rolls. Freezing it will leave the wrap rubbery.

My husband is already asking me to make it again. I didn't boil the cabbage, and I cooked in a baking dish covered in foil in the oven for 45 minutes instead of the stove top method. This is definitely going on the dinner rotation, LOVED it.

I made mine with ground breast of turkey instead of the traditional burger. I placed the outer cabbage leaves on the bottom to prevent burning. On top of the cabbage leaves I added one can diced fire roasted tomatoes. I also crumbled up some garden herb croutons and added that to the turkey mixture. I topped the rolls with 2 Tbls. low salt tomatoe paste, then covered with the remaining outer cabbage leaves to keep al the moisture in. Put in the oven for 1 hour covered at 375 then 30 minutes uncovered. totally delish!

Love this recipe. I've made it several times already. I did change just a couple of things. I used a 1/2 cup of rice instead of a 1/3 (I love rice) Also, instead of plain tomato sauce, I use a jar of spaghetti sauce. So yummy!

I've been making stuffed cabbage rolls for years using ground beef and love them. I thought I would try this with Johnsonville's Italian Sausage. I used their links, removing the casing, in place of the ground beef in this recipe and my husband liked them better than using beef. Me, on the other hand, prefers to use a good ground chuck. Instead of boiling my cabbage leaves to soften them, I just stuck the whole head of cabbage into my steamer pot and steamed until I could loosen them from the head. I had to do it in batches but it worked perfectly. I also used onion powder in place of the onion since my husband won't eat anything with onions. Normally I simmer these in a pot on the stove but I didn't feel like babysitting the pot so I put them in a baking pan and basted them with the soup a couple times throughout the cooking process. I baked at 350 degrees for around an hour or so. Good simple recipe.

I use a similar recipe but have never put an egg in. For a topping, I use a can of tomato soup, half can water and 1/4 can vinegar. This came from my grandmother.  If you take the cabbage leaf, cut a V where the thick stem is, put meat in other end, roll leaf and when you get near cut part, fold in kinda like a taco and finish roll. No need for toothpick

This recipe varies a little bit from mine that I got from my Grandmother.   One trick that my Mom taught me is to add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of vinegar to the sauce - whether you use tomato soup or sauce or canned tomatoes.  The vinegar gives the cabbage rolls a tang that you don't get otherwise.  Try it and see!

We loved these cabbage rolls! We did make a few adjustments, though. First, we used ground lamb instead of beef. For the meat mixture we added in 1/2 cup of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup. For the sauce mixture we followed the "most helpful positive review" and instead of using tomato soup we used 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 8 oz tomato sauce, and 1 tbsp Worcestershire. It was delicious!

I tried this recipe and it was the first time I ever made cabbage rolls. I received lots of great compliments and will definitely make this again. The only change I made was to add a 1/2 teaspoon of beef flavoring to the hamburger. I highly recommend this recipe.

I used this as a basic recipe to get me started. I made mine with hot sausage and hamburger mixed. I already had leftover cooked rice so I used that.  I also used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup for a richer taste.  They were a hit!  Turned out fantastic!  I also used the microwave trick with the cabbage and it worked wonderfully!

This recipe was pretty good, I added garlic powder and worcestershire sauce to the meat. Layered the dish with cabbage and then placed the stuffed cabbage on top and repeated another layer of cabbage. I used 2 cans of tomato soup and 1 can of tomato sauce. Hubby said next time we have to add more flavor to the meat.

These were good.  I thought they could use more flavour though.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to brown the ground beef first or not, so I browned it first to be safe.  Overall a good recipe.

Have never made cabbage rolls before. These were bland and and the sauce was tasteless. Will try again but will use more seasoning in the meat and tomato sauce.

It is a Lebanese famous dish. Try replacing the tomato paste with pomegranate paste, water, minced garlic and dried mint, simply yummy. my favorite dish :)

I usually don't take the time to write reviews but felt I had too. The cabbage tasted like tomato soup and the meat was hard and flavorless.

A favorite from when we grew up.  Mom (and I) dredge the rolls in flour then brown them before putting them in the crock pot. We also deglaze the pan with a touch of water, then mix it with plain old un-diluted tomato soup before we pour it on top.  The browning adds flavor and color to the sauce.  I've also added Worchestershire sauce to the soup for a little "zing"  It's also a great way to use left-over rice.  Great comfort food.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and made some changes, I added mushroom and pepper flakes to make it pop. It was easy enough to cook and great tasting. Will definately make it again!

This was such a wonderful dish, just like my grandmas.  I have been wanting to try these since she pasted but never had the nerve.  This was easy, tasty and my whole family liked it.  I did use turkey burger instead only because that's all we are trying to use these days.  Couldn't tell the difference!

These are amazing! Very impressive, no-fail dish to make for family. No need to tie up the rolls or toothpick them as long as you carefully lay them in your pan. I added several cloves of garlic, a tbsp. of oregano, and dash of red pepper flakes to the beef mixture, and instead of the tomato sauce I used a can of stewed tomatoes blended with beef stock. Yummos!

First time I ever made cabbage rolls and they came out great! I used a pound and a half of chopped meat and it made about 12 rolls. I added worcheshire to my meat mixture and I added a little franks red hot sauce to the tomato sauce mixture. I baked them covered with foil at 375 for an hour. I will definitely make them again!

I wanted something easy and 'new' for my family to try with the pound of ground beef I had on hand, and this was a hit.  My 4 year old ate TWO of these!  
I used a bag of ready to serve spicy tomato soup in place of the condensed tomato soup (I had it on hand).  After adding a bit of soup to the meat mixture, I poured the remainder of it over the rolls that I'd placed in an 8x10 baking dish.  I covered the dish with foil and baked in a 200c (aprox 400f) oven for about an hour.
They were nice for a change, I'll make them again.

I liked this recipe. I never made these before, and I have no recollection of ever eating a stuffed cabbage before, but I can say these were GOOD. My wife loved them. I also added the 2tbs. brown sugar and lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. All good. Its a keeper.

This is an excellent recipe - great "comfort food" without too many calories.  I substitute ground turkey in place of the ground beef, and the change is not really noticiable, and saves a few more calories.  Even better reheated the next day for lunch!

My entire family LOVED these, including my 10 and 12 yr old daughters. They both said "I hate cabbage rolls" while I was making them and I had to laugh because I told them "You've never HAD cabbage rolls!" Turns out they both came back for seconds, and wanted to know if there were leftovers the next day! I did take the advice of a previous poster and I dipped the head of cabbage in boiling water for a few minutes at a time to make the leaves come off more easily. It worked beautifully!

This is an Eastern European recipe and in Romania, these are called sarmales (sounds like tamales) and they are a traditional dish for around the holidays. I uses the juice from a couple of cans of diced tomatoes instead of sauce as it really shouldn't be a saucy meal. I had to laugh at the woman who put spaghetti sauce on it-yuck.  Overall it was okay-will tide me over until I get to the family's house for Christmastime.  Definitely needs to have some garlic, paprika, and some basil. 

Also, the way it's usually done is with pickled cabbage leaves in a jar-they are really pliable and easy to use.

My husband isn't a fan of thick tomato sauces so I mixed the tomato soup as you would to make regular soup, added a little seasoning to the meat mixture to give it some more flavor, and then followed the rest of the directions in the recipe. My husband loved it!! Going to become a regular dish in our home!!

This was quite good.  My cabbage was too small for the task, so I had a difficult time wrapping the rolls, but when it came time to eat, it was pure "comfort food".  If these weren't so much trouble to make for one person, I'd make them more often. (That's why the 4 stars from me).  But yes, these are the real deal and delish!

If you cook beef in advance, it tastes very nice. If not you get sick after eating it.

I really liked the flavor to these.  It was something different to get out of the "spaghetti Monday" routine. The kids, however promptly removed the cabbage and ate the inside.  They liked the flavor, but didn't know what to do with the cabbage.  It was a different texture for them.  I'd make it again because the flavor was so good.

I had stuffed cabbage many years ago and was unable to find a decent recipe until now. My neighbor made a similar dish and I did not get the recipe. This is perfect.

This is almost my exact recipe that I've been using for years but I top it with a little saurkraut (this is more of a slovak tradition) and chop the left over cabbage and tuck all that around the rolls.  I also use a mixture of milk and water to my meat.  I never used water alone.  I also use par cooked rice.  I'm not sure if that's the right name for it, but it's not true "uncooked" rice.  Using that sometimes leaves you with still hard rice (it happened to me once).  I opt to use a bag of success rice-i don't cook it, but its not truely raw rice.  Hope that helps.  One more thing...if you come up short on soup, try adding a little ketchup.  I know..I know...it sounds weird, but it works!

I was so disappointed, it took forever to make which is not a problem if it would have tasted somewhat ok. I followed the recipe to perfection. We ended up making scrambles eggs and toast because we couldn't finish it.

Great recipe!  I used jar spaghetti sauce because it was what I had on hand, and used the water from the cabbage boiling.  I also added some crushed garlic.  Delicious- thanks!

This was a delicious recipe idea that I freely changed to meet my own needs! But *surprise* this took a lot longer than I expected! I live in a country where beef is very expensive so instead I used tofu, chopped mushrooms, and 1/2 bell pepper, sauted in olive oil with mixed italian herbs and plenty of garlic. I took the advice of other reviewers and made my own tomato sauce using a large can of crushed tomatoes, a small can of tomato paste, finely chopped pepper and onion, more garlic, a pinch of brown sugar and a splash of vinegar. I put it all + 2 cups of chicken broth in my slow-cooker for 2 hours. I served it with a simple side of green beans w/toasted cashews and my dinner guests loved it!

Quite good, and very simple.  The cooking time can be reduced a bit, and I think some other spices mixed in w/ the beef would add a lot to the depth of flavor.  (Add 1/4t Ground cumin & Cayenne along w/ 1t garlic powder to the meat).

I make mine very similiar to these. I change the sauce a bit and line the pan and cover with cabbage leaves . The main difference with mine is I use a mixture of ground beef and ground pork. Delicious. But I must say these are perfectly delcious just as written. Thank you

Delicious! I like to season my meat mixture a bit more with garlic and whatever spices sound good on that day. I added a few teaspoons vinegar to the tomato soup as it seemed too sweet. This is good served over homemade egg noodles!

This is a great recipie, I am not a fan of cooked cabbage but this was so good. we did not have tomatoe soup so we used a can of tomatoe sauce and a small can of V8 with a tablespoon or two of tomatoe paste mixed it. we baked it in the oven for about 45 min to 1 hour at 325, and it was great.

My family has been making this dish for years, known as " pigs in the blanket" in PA.  However, we use chopped tomatoes, gives more flavor to the sauce.  Also add about 1/4 cup cream and can of tomato paste to sauce. Very yummy!  This is a traditional recipe passed down from my parents.

I think this a variation of the Arabic dish "malfoof". its almost the same only no tomato sauce is used and the cabbage leaves are dipped in boiling water before rolling to soften.  the minced meat is seasoned with salt pepper and a little Cinnamon and lots of butter or ghee and is browned with the onions in the same pan before being mixed with the rice (no need to boil) and used inside the cabbage. (some people don't cook the meat before stuffing)  the cabbage is rolled in to medium/ thin rolls and stacked inside a pot with whole garlic cloves (unpeeled and as much as you want, the more the better) stuffed in between the layers. cover them with hot water (just so the water covers them). turn heat up until water comes to boil. then lower heat and let simmer for 40 to 60 mins or until rolls and stuffing are cooked (test with fork).  when served use a little lemon juice on top and squeeze the paste from the garlic cloves as condiment. Bon apetit  :)

This is Western-European recipe, in Romania we call these "sarmale" and we prepare them with sour cabbage or, in the summer, with grapevine leaves. Both are delicious. I only prepare them with chicken breast, as I don't like beef so much.  But this is a pretty good recipe. Enjoy!

Tried these last night and they were pretty good. Cooked in the oven at 375 for 1 hour and the cabbage was still a little tough, but yummy anyway. My family enjoyed them also. Will be making again.

I accidently left the cabbage in the hot water too long so it kept tearing but was easy to overlap and hide. Make extra sauce because it tend to dry out and was not sauce-y enough. Popped in the oven to cook for about 15 min and it was delicious!

I was not crazy about the flavor that the tomato soup gave these cabbage rolls.  My family liked another version I have made with tomato sauce and brown sugar and baked them.

Very Versatile - read for a vegetarian alternative if you're interested...  I love this recipe, mostly because of it's versatility.  I replaced the beef with chickpeas, used spaghetti sauce (because it's what I had on hand), and put it in a slow cooker.  It turned out wonderful!  I think next time I might use one more egg, and perhaps 1/4 cup of  bread crumbs (the chickpeas did crumble and fall apart a bit more than beef would), but the flavor was awesome as is.  You can do anything you want with this base recipe though, and it'll come out good.

My mom has been making stuffed cabbage for years; she never used rice in her chopmeat mixture; but she did add some type of pork -- bacon, porkfat etc. that she would saute and mix with chopmeat; always used tomato soup.  She now cores the cabbage and freezes it and it does NOT come out tough or inedible, if you boil it it is hot and you have to wait a while; I tried steaming it in microwave and it came out perfect and didn't take as long to cool as opposed to boiling it.

I use almost an identical recipe- except I use a can of tomato sauce to mix with the beef- then I use 1-2 cans of tomato soup to simmer in (I find that I need to add a little water to thin it to desired consistency).  Also I sprinkle a little garlic powder into the beef mix.  Finally, to save a step,  if you use instant white rice, you can just mix it into the beef mix uncooked- then roll and simmer in soup for 2-3 hours.  I've also simmered in tomato sauce rather than soup and it was good that way too.

I've never eaten cabbage rolls before, much less tried to make them, but these were great!  My cabbage-hating kids devoured them, so that I was glad I made a double batch.

I like the flavor of this dish a lot, but the cabbage rolls did tend to come apart.  I tried not to move them when they were in the pan & kept the heat on medium low so I wouldn't have to move them much.  I do recommend toothpicks to help keep them together.

Read reviews for this recipe and took everyone's advice.  Added 1 T brown sugar, 1 t ground cinnamon, 2 splashes of balsamic vinegar, 1 t lemon juice, very little salt (1/16 t), 2 T tomato soup, 1/2 c onion, 1 egg and pork plus beef - meatballs were excellent--everyone loved it!  Should have parboiled the cabbage instead of using the microwave method - even tho I nuked the cabbage for 10 mins, and cooked in the oven covered at 350 for 1-1/2 hours, cabbage was still too crunchy.

This recipe didn't blow me away, but there were a couple of things I liked about it that I think are worth mentioning. First of all, I had never made stuffed cabbage before, nor had I even eaten it. I just knew it was something that was out there and it sounded interesting. This recipe was pretty simple to follow for a first-timer. And though the flavor profile was pertty basic, I'm certain this recipe will adapt easily to my (or anyone else's) personal preferences. I found it too difficult to pull off individual cabbage leaves off a cold head of cabbage, so I cut off the bottom and put it in a bowl with about an inch of water in the bottom. Then I covered the bowl and put it in the  microwave for about four minutes. This softened up the leaves enough to pull them apart more easily without  tearing them. I doubled the recipe, which was easily done, but thought it needed more sauce, so I ended up using 3 cans of soup instead of 2 for a double recipe. Served it over brown rice. Next time, I'll also add some parsley, celery seed, and some drained diced tomatoes to the meat mixture. I think I'll also doctor the sauce, too. I've read other suggestions. For a double recipe I'll probably use 2 cans of tomato soup, then a can's worth of tomato  juice with a little brown sugar, worcestershire sauce, and maybe a splash or two of balsamic vinegar...maybe some parsley, too? So this is a good starter recipe, and I'll make it again, just with my own additions to make it more interesting.

I love this recipe!  My family recipe calls for baking cabbage rolls, but I must say, I like the stovetop cover method, faster!  I use lots more soup b/c I like mine soupy, typically make 2 pans and use 2.5 cans per pan.  Thanks, been making this recipe now for over 5years.  Grandma would be proud!

Very simple, but also very tasty.  I made these tonight and they came out wonderful.  The only change I made was the addition of some garlic to the meat, but other than that, I pretty much stuck to the recipe and it came out really good.

I was a little unsure about this recipe because of the simplicity...but it turned out great!  I had to tweek it a bit, only using 1/2lb. lean ground beef and maybe 1/4 of sausage (Jimmy Dean) because it was all I had on hand.  I used brown rice, extra onion, and seasoned it up with worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, a little ketchup and a few diced tomatoes from a can.  I then used some more of the diced tomatoes and tomatoe sauce instead of the tomato soup.  Used low sodium everything (dad has CHF) - and everyone loved this easy, healthy recipe.  Will make again.

A really nice basic cabbage roll-- my Mother in law was Polish, and taught me how to cook these when I married her son-- she traditionally used ground pork/veal, but since veal is hard to come by, I use beef/pork. The pork gives it a nice flavor. Also, she used tomato juice/chopped tomatoes instead of tomato soup. And for the richest flavor yet, she added sour cream into the sauce just before serving. Outstanding!

This was a really easy and quick recipe to make. I added a bit more salt to taste and along with the tomato soup I threw in some chopped canned tomatoes (basil, garlic flavor) in the hamburger mixture and the rest on top to simmer cause I like more juiciness. Reminds me of when my great grandma used to make this for us. =)

This was a pretty easy recipe and since it was my first time making it, I stuck to the directions. Not so sure I would use tomato soup again. It was a little sweet for our liking. The hint about steaming the head of cabbage was fantastic! Next time I'll definitely add more flavor to the stuffing. All in all, this was a good base recipe that leaves lots of room to add your own twist.

These were pretty darn good, but I did do a little tweaking. I usually try not to do that when I try other people's recipes, but I just couldn't do without garlic. So, I added a clove of garlic. I also mixed my remaining tomato soup with about a 1/4 c. of beef broth before I poured it over the rolls. I added a little cornstarch to the sauce in the end, because it was a little too thin (which was my fault for adding the beef broth). Had I not done all of these things, I am positive it would've been just as good!

These were ok, pretty bland though.  I had added garlic powder, brown sugar and lemon juice....seems like it could use a little kick.  I boiled the whole head of cabbage for about 8-10 minutes, then stuffed the leaves and cooked in the oven.  They kept form pretty good, but the taste wasn't quite there.

This is a really good recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that you definitely need to at least double the amount of sauce and it does need some doctoring. I did spice up the sauce as others have recommended, but I also found it necessary to add a bit of pasta or tomato sauce to the tomato soup. I also think this recipe would be better if the cabbage was fully covered in sauce and slow cooked either in the oven or a crock pot.

Im not good at making rolls, they seem to fall apart, so I turn this into a casserole. I do make my own sauce, but I line a pan with cabbage put the meat mixture with shredded cooked cabbage over the leaves, put bacon bits over that, put sauce over that, then top it with more cabbage rolls. Then I preceed to bake as recipe states.

We loved this!  I was lucky and did not have any trouble with the cabbage.  I did choose to add some cayenne pepper and also used some garlic salt rather than the regular salt.  I put mine in the oven on 350 for an hour and 15 min covered in foil, but only because my stove top does not tend to heat evenly, and the rolls can be somewhat delicate.  This is definitely a keeper!

I was brought up on what I know is the "traditional" way to prepare stuffed cabbage rolls, with beef broth, not tomato sauce.  I tried this recipe, with mild changes, added about a cup of jar marinara sauce and baked in oven.  This version was okay, I gave it 4 stars only to support the fact that it is a "tomato" version and I am not a hugh "tomato" flavor fan.

This was exactly the taste I was looking for, just as I remember growing up.  For anyone trying this the first time, it is a little hard to eat the rolls, best to use knife and fork, but they are soooo tasty.  Great comfort food and very easy.  I cooked the entire head of cabbage (removed the core) using a steamer basket, pulling a few outside leaves off to stuff and roll while the rest of the cabbage continued to cook, ended up using the entire head.  Also, I added a little more tomato sauce with the condensed soup for a stronger tomato flavor.  Great recipe!

Wonderful! I didn't rate this 5 stars only due to the fact that I did make it as others suggested, with pasta sauce, brown sugar, lemon and worcestershire sauce. So yummy though! My husband had never had cabbage rolls and he was ecstatic about these.

This was absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made were that I mixed one can of tomato sauce with some spicy V8 juice and cooked the rolls in that in the skillet.  It came out great!  It was a pain to cook in the skillet, though, because they weren't all cooking at the same degree and I had to keep moving them around in the pan some, not easy to do with cabbage rolls without tearing them up.  If anyone knows how long to bake them for at 350 in the oven, pls post it!  Thanks!!  It was great.

I loosely followed this recipe...basically to get an idea of ingredients to use. I went to the comments (as I always do) to check the 'most helpful', followed by the 'lowest rated'. After taking everything into consideration, I kind of made it my own. These are the changes: I wilted about 1/2 a large yellow onion, and 3 cloves of garlic seasoning with salt and pepper. I par-cooked 1 cup of rice. In a medium bowl, I mixed the onion/garlic, ground beef, egg, rice, together and I added about a 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. I sofened the cabbage leaves pretty much as suggested, added the meat mixture and rolled. Put the extra leaves on the bottom of the slow cooker, then put in the rolls. I mixed 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce (plus the rest of the other can I added to the meat mixture) added a bit of brown sugar and poured it on top of the rolls. Oh! I had about 1/4 cup of meat left over and I didn't feel like going back an peeling off another cabbage leaf, so I just broke it up a little and mixed it in with the sauce before I poured it over the rolls. Put the cover on the cooker and went to work. When I got home, the slow cooker was in the 'warm' setting, as it had stopped cooking. The sauce was a bit thick, so I added about a 1/2 cup of water and turned it back on 'high' for about an hour. I served it up, and my boyfriend and I thought it was absolutely wonderful.

very yummy - firstly i used basmati rice which i think makes a world of diff. then i added 4 cloves of garlic to ensure the mix wasn't too bland and a dash of worcestershire.  i used 2 cans of condensed tomato soup because it didn't look like enough sauce and i didn't think it could hurt.  Overall, very tasty and alot of fun since it was my first time ever making. also, a great way to use up left over cabbage from st. patty's day corned beef cabbage meal. don't hesitate to try this.  Thankyou for posting.

Definitely use suggestions from previous reviews and you will love this dish. This is the basic recipe I follow every time I make stuffed cabbage rolls. I always double the sauce. They come out just like my grandma use to make them back in Poland.

I love, love LOVE this recipe.  The only thing I noticed that was a bit off was the amount of meat for 8 cabbage leaves.  I had so much meat left-over that I made meatballs, which were just as fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great guide line for making cabbage rolls. However, that is all I will use it for. The measurements were a little too off for my taste. I ended up putting about 1/2 cup of tomato soup in the beef mixture. When it was all said and done I had used two cans of tomato soup. I also added mushrooms to the beef mix. Very Tasty!

I really enjoyed this. My boyfriend was so happy when he got home and saw what I was making. They turned out even better than the fancy ones at the local speciality shop's deli. I cut the recipe in half and added some minced garlic, which I sauted with the onion prior to mixing with the meat. I used the entire can of soup though. I will definitely be making this again.

I strongly suggest using JASMIN rice, cooked, as well as steak seasoning, fresh garlic, and a few dashes of Worcestershire's sauce. If you aren't using a slow cooker like the rest of America, put rolls in a lasagna pan, cover with 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can tomato juice. If you are going to do all the work of delicious stuffed cabbage, you might as while do a whole head of cabbage with 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground turkey and enjoy it. This recipe is ok, but definitely not the best by any means. Use above alterations and enjoy!

This is a great base for stuffed cabbage, as others have mentioned.  I used regular canned tomato sauce instead of condensed soup.  I also mixed it with some brown sugar, salt, pepper, and adobo seasoning.  I made it with turkey instead of ground beef and I mixed some of the tomato sauce with the turkey.  It came out very delicious and moist.

A very good basic recipe for stuffed cabbage rolls.  The meat mixture definitely needs a little more spice.  I also bake mine instead of boiling them.  I place all the rolls in a 9x13 pan, pour in the tomato sauce, cover with foil and bake at 350 for 45 mintues.

This was a BIG HIT hit in my house! I used ground beef and ground pork, plus added a finely chopped red chili pepper and fresh chopped basil. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. It was absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. (I wilted the cabbage leaves in the microwave as suggested by another reviewer - it was fast and worked out perfect)!

These cabbage rolls were good, but quite bland for my tastes.  I may use this recipe again as a base, but will find a way to jazz it up a bit.  Perhaps a healthy dose of minced garlic and some peas/carrots in the stuffing next time.

We loved this! My husband said it was even better as leftovers the next day. I used ground turkey instead of beef & 2 cans of tomato soup like other reviewers suggested. Also, chinese cabbage leaves worked really well since they're long & roll well.

Classic!  I make the sauce the "german" way - I saute a little onion, add beef bullion and water and thicken slightly, then add a couple tablespoons of tomato sauce (for the redness and a hint of flavor). Serve with mashed potatoes. Excellent, thanks!

I am only giving this four stars for a few reasons.  1 - there was a lot of prep time and by the time they went in to the oven I wondered if it was worth it and 2 - my kids wouldn't eat it at all.  This is the first time I have made something that my son just refused to eat.  He ended up calling his grandmother who lives around the corner to see if they had eaten yet so he could eat there. My husband and I thought they were pretty good.  I took the advice of others and added some garlic, brown sugar and woozy sauce. I have ordered these at restaurants and I thought this recipe was just as good. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very simple and delicious recipe. I also used two cans of tomatoe soup as one was not enough.  I would suggest putting down a layer of tomatoe soup at the bottom of the skillet before placing the cabbage rolls in to cook, so the cabbage rolls do not burn on the bottom.    My husband and I both went back for second helpings.  They were yummy!

I added a can of water since the soup didn't seem to make enough sauce.  Would also be good as meatballs without the trouble of cabbage leaves.  Kids liked the meat.

So easy, to be made often in crock pot.
Definitely should have spiced things up a bit more, but all in all, just great.

This was really yummy.  My changes were... ground turkey instead of beef, tomato sauce instead of soup, and I added finely chopped carrots and green bell pepper.  I loved it.

Thanks, they were great, I used uncooked rice and added some chopped banana pepper rings to add a little more zing to the filling. I made a large batch to ensure some leftovers but we couldn't stop eating until we saw the bottom of the pot. Gonna have to make alot more soon.

Ok, so...this was easy to make. But...the meat filling is bland and dry. So...as suggested by many...go ahead and add some seasonings to it cause it will need it. The sauce is bland as well. I see why many used spagetti sauce instead. It sure won't be authentic but it will taste better than plain tomato soup. There's plenty of room for improvement here.

I think it is more fair to say 8 cabbage rolls is 4 servings.  Served this with parsley carrots.  Used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of egg and added some cinnamon with the apple flavor.  Also added 2 chopped fresh tomatoes and about 1/2 cup bread crumbs since this made it a bit too soupy.  Also added about 1/2 soup can of water with the tomato soup topping.  This allowed it to cook at a very low temperature for a couple of hours.

I was planning on making my grandmother's stuffed cabbage recipe tomorrow for my dad's birthday but could not remember what we used to top them with when i was a girl helping her to make them.  I thought it was tomato soup but kept questioning myself, guess what, yours is the exact recipe she used, thanks!

I loved this!  I substituted fake eggs, brown rice, and ground turkey and it came out delicious.  I am a big fan of 1 pot cooking and this really made it.  You can steam the cabbage over the rice and them simmer in the same pot after a quick rinse.

This recipe is excellent! My husband loved it and rated it a 5 star and he grew up in a Polish family. My only complaint is the rice was done in under 15 minutes, no way it could have gone to 20 minutes. I did add just a dash of garlic powder after reading rewiews but I really don't think it needs it. This recipe will be a favorite in our  fanily.

I have never made these before because I don't like them.  I decided to suprise my husband with something different for him.  He ate half the pan and said they were good.  I did alter the recipe like alot of the other reviewers did. I think I will continue to use this recipe.

I used brown rice and it worked well.  My only issue was, the cabbage was so well done, it no longer taste like cabbage.  Next time, I'll do like another reviewer and bake them.

We didn't care for this too much. I made the mistake of not using really lean meat, so the dish was greasy and too rich. I don't know if I'd make it again. Was not what I thought it would be. Sorry.

This recipe is pretty close to the one I've been making. Just a few tips: For a quicker cook time, you can cook the beef while the rice is cooking. At that time you can flavor the beef with onions and seasonings.  The cabbage doesn't need to be pre-cooked because the sauce cooks it quite well. Try mixing mushroom soup with the tomato soup and a bit of salt.

My boyfriend was craving cabbage rolls like his momma used to make, and I served him these.  He LOVED them!  I had never had cabbage rolls in my life, and I enjoyed them quite a bit, too!  This recipe is going to be a standard in our household from now on.  Thanks Judy!

Delicious! I used the family size can of tomato soup and it was great! I have never made these before and I can't wait to make them again. Big hit in my house! We like garlic so I added fresh minced garlic to the filling, even better :) You have to try it!

when you put in it the large pan on the stovetop there isnt enough juice to boil.there is only the condenced tomatoe soup on top of the rolls.i had to transfer them to a baking pan and bake them at 350 for almost an hour.also i think it would have been better with more tomatoe soup in the mix.other than that they came out great and my guests really enjoyed.

My husband and I love these.  It is similar to the filling in stuffed peppers.  My parents always made these with beef gravy instead of tomato soup and I intend to try it next time.

I added a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomatoes with basil and oregano instead of tomato soup for the sauce . I added Worcestershire sauce to the sauce. I also added some garlic powder to the meat mixture. I put cabbage leaves on the bottom of the pan and baked it in the oven for 40 minutes.

I will be trying this again with tomato soup!  I didn't have any soup on hand so I used jarred tomato sauce....I was afraid it would be too sweet or thick, however, the juices from the cabbage and beef thinned it out just enough!  It worked well!!

RI followed the recipe to the letter. Everyone in my family loved it. My grandson wants me to make it again and again. Very easy and yummy.
We like a lot of sauce so I think I would use two cans of tomato soup.

We absolutely loved this dish but when cooking felt it could use a little more flavor. We added Ginger, Cumin, and Allspice to the meat. It might also be better to add a little more tomato soup to the pan when cooking as we found the saucier bites to be the best ones.

I added a tablespoon of Dimitri's Bloody Mary mix. No need for toothpick or string just lay them in the pan or baking dish and put them straight into the oven. Cover after 20-30 min. Bake for 60-75 minutes at 350 degrees.

I made this the first time on the stove, however the second time I got s good head of cabbage and had slot more rolls so put it in a casserole dish and covered it with aluminum foil and basted it the same and it turned out just as good. Also I learned if you take the whole head of cabbage and swirl it around the boiling water before you try to tear it apart it makes it easier to tear the cabbage apart and have whole leaves instead of broken apart leaves. Just s little something to keep in mind

I added 1 lb of sausage to this and just doubled the sauce.  I read online that if you use cabbage around the actual rolls they stay more moist and it is true!  I baked mine in the oven at 350 for 90 min.

Pretty good. I used A family size bag of Success rice, then softened the cabbage leafs in the water from the rice. 
Used Progresso hearty tomato because the condensed soup had too many additives for my household.
This is a simple straightforward weeknight recipe

We have always made stuffed cabbage using tomato soup and to me it’s the best-I do use a bit more than 2 tablespoons soup in the mix(generally a half can) and then one and a half can of soup over

These were good but I would leave out the onion next time. It overpowered the cabbage.

We really like this recipe! I use Swiss chard instead of cabbage. Don’t have to parboil it. Just wash the leaves and stuff!

I have made this recipe a few times now and its been a big hit. I've had someone tell me that the taste reminds them of their childhood because the sauce tastes like spaghetti-o's. I double the amount of rice and tomato soup and I let it simmer for an hour.

Taste better than I thought it would. Only changes I made was added sugar and garlic salt. I used the very outer leaves which may not have been the best idea but I think cooking them a little longer next time it will be more tender. The taste couldn’t have been better !

I hate to say it, but this was the worst stuffed cabbage rolls recipe I've ever made. No flavor. I definitely prefer pork over beef, baking mine and also including sauerkraut or just simply more herbs and spices. Also, not a fan of the soup for sauce, prefer real tomatoes or tomato sauce. I really was excited for these due to the raving reviews and both my husband and I couldnt finish a full roll .

I did make alterations such as ; omitting the canned tomato soup and used a jarred basil garlic spaghetti sauce. I also followed the other reviewer’s suggestion of pouring a mixture of sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce over the rolls. I also laid extra cabbage leaves over the top of the rolls which I think kept the rolls moister. Overall very good.

I haven't had cabbage rolls since I was a kid and wanted to try to make them. I found this recipe, which was very easy; however, I did make a lot of tweaks to it:
- I cooked the onions and hamburger, and seasoned it with seasoning salt , a little onion powder, and pepper.
- As my husband is on Keto, I changed up the rice for riced cauliflower.
- I don't like tomato soup in recipes, so I used a medium can of tomato sauce, a small can of tomato paste, and I seasoned it with a little more garlic, basil, and pepper. 

It cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good (my 9yo loved it!); however, we like savory foods, so I think next time I'll be adding some spicy sausage and a little oregano. :)

I made it last night and it was SO good! The cabbage tastes good because it soaks up the tomato sauce.  Its like eating a special burger because you taste the onions and garlic. If you’re wondering if you should try it... yes you should! The ingredients are cheap and it did take me a while to make it mostly because of dealing with the cabbage leaves but it was well worth it! It will definitely be a recipe at my home.

How I made it differently from the website recipe is I used butter to sauté garlic and onions. I let that cool and used left over white rice, spaghetti sauce (Prego roasted garlic tomato sauce), cumin, Sazon, Lawry’s complete seasoning, then a little salt and pepper. I mixed it all and then prepared a sauce to bake the cabbage rolls in. I had heated tomato sauce (the same one for the meat mixture and then I put a couple spoonfuls of cabbage water and some butter and cream cheese. I put this sauce down in my baking dish and then did one layer of rolls. I covered that layer with more sauce and then repeated kind of like a cabbage roll lasagna. I baked it for an hour and a half at 350 and it was so good. The cream cheese really added a smoothness to the sauce and I love this recipe so enjoy!

Followed the directions. Maybe it’s not a dish for me, but it was essentially flavorless.  It’s meat, plain old tomato soup and cabbage... it leaves a lot to be desired. I covered it in hot sauce and choked it down.

I added a can of tomato sauce to make it more moist, but otherwise kept to the recipe. Hubby said he liked it a lot and would eat it again, and it made a light meal with not too many carbs. Served with green beans, crusty bread and a salad.

I modified this by using more of everything. I add tomato juice, and a jar of sauerkraut, instead of the tomato soup. Like it more sour.

Tweaked this easy recipe: used ground turkey, added a litte diced jalapeno, used 1/4 tsp pepper to ramp up the spice for my fiance. Bubbling on the stove now... looks yummy. Never made stuffed cabbage rolls before, but this was so simple! Will update once we taste it but pretty sure it'll be a hit!

I do boil the head of cabbage along with a smoked ham hock....gives a lot of wonderful flavor!   I also put the hock in the crock pot along with the diced tomatoes while cooking.   
Many have asked what my secret is, I've never let it out
 till now :)   (if tried, I hope you will like it!)

This was excellent. Get a larger head of cabbage, small one have small leaves.

Having an egg allergy, I substituted egg substitute powder, 1 T mixed with 2 T of water. 

Also added organic catsup to meat instead of tomato juice, a dash of Worcestshire sauce, and added some additional seasonings.

It was excellent! Highly recommend for a theme dinner or cold winter night.

Just like my mom, who was 100% Polish, use to make. I cooked mine in the pressure cooker like she use to. Didn't change anything, except I browned them in butter before putting them in the cooker, because that's what my mom did. 20 minutes using 15lbs pressure, then release pressure with cold water.

The only change I made was adding tomato sauce instead of soup and making more of a sauce, adding Worcestershire, brown sugar and herbs.  Still it was a pretty basic recipe and quite bland.  I think if I make this again, I'll definitely add cumin, garlic and more herbs to both the meat and sauce mix.

Thank you for the amazing recipe! When I made these, the tomato soup was starting to stick to the pan so I added in a couple splashes of the beer I was drinking and it added an amazing flavor to it! Definitely will be one of my go to recipes.

For the pork I used Jimmy Dean sausage..(4slices) gives all the seasoning you need.  I also included some chopped green onions. 

For the topping I saved several cups of the cabbage water, chopped bell peppers/onions/ crushed tomatoes simmered and added several tablespoons full of brown sugar to give a sweet taste.  mmmmmdelicious...

Love this recipe, simple and made with things you would have in your home pantry. 
The only change I made was instead of tomato soup I used a can if tomato bisque....
Has become a family favorite and is so yummy.

This was a good starting point, but as is, the meat filling is pretty bland. I will make it again but will spice up the filling with garlic, tomato sauce or maybe Worcestershire sauce. I liked the sauce a lot, but I doubled it so I would have plenty. Also, I used the microwave method to obtain my leaves for wrapping and it worked famously. I am happy to have this recipe as a jumping off point. Thanks for sharing!

So glad I found a cabbage roll recipe that uses tomato soup--I love tomato soup with this! It's the very same way my mom had made it when I was a child. I did make a few modifications (no egg and no rice) just to satisfy my family's dietary issues. To the diced onions I added two minced garlic cloves, 1/4 cup diced celery, and 1/4 cup diced red peppers. Like another reviewer I also put cabbage leaves above and below the rolls (just like mom did). So flavorful--must be the tomato soup! Thanks for sharing!

I would skip the pan cooking in favor of baking. It can get messy if your rolls aren't tight and even then, they become soft and are more likely to fall apart or break open when rotating them.

Other than that issue it was a good basic recipe. Simple. Tastes good but not great. I added a little seasoning in the burger, however.

Love this recipe, but I have made a couple of tweaks! I add a little garlic powder and onion powder to the stuffing mixture for more flavor.  I also Mix a large can of tomato soup with a can of water and pour over the stuffed cabbage.  I also place salt pork in the pan, cover and bake for approx. 1 1/2 hours at 350.  I’m all about flavor.

Great recipe! I doubled the amount of tomato soup, added some water too.  For the rice, I used the leftover white rice from chinese delivery!  I didn't bother to tie or toothpick the rolls.  They stayed together fine.

This was a very bland dish. Very little flavor and not very interesting. If I make it again, I will add more spices and herbs, less to no rice and doctor up the tomato soup. My family wouldn't eat it.

I saute the onions and use tomato sauce to which I add a dash of Worcestershire sauce, some onion and garlic powder and black pepper. My family likes their cabbage on a bed of kraut. Made this batch for my daughter.

Not bad! I also baked it and think it requires a lot more sauce to pour on top. I covered with other cabbage leaves all around then with foil. I got maybe a medium size cabbage head but next time would get a larger one. I baked a little over an hour at 350.

I originally found this recipe in the 1974 edition of "A Campbell Cookbook: Cooking With Soup."  As a young bride, I used this cookbook often, and the Stuffed Cabbage Rolls recipe on page 31 was (and still is) one of my favorite recipes.  I double the sauce and add 2 tsp. of Worcestershire.
Sometimes I use part soup and part tomato sauce.  How one softens the leaves is personal preference, but I still closely follow the original recipe.  It's a classic and is delicious.   Of course, I don't cook with canned soups very much these days.  Everything in moderation.  But some 44 years later, I'm reaching for my worn and tattered Campbell's cookbook once again.

I used all the same ingredients and I wasn't loving it as much as I did before...the tomatoe soup is a big "no! no!" for this meal I switched it towards the end and used tomatoe sauce/paste and that definitely was needed to make this meal taste complete

My husband loved it! Of course I had to use onion powder instead of an actual onion because he doesn’t like them. The only other thing I did slightly different was make a copy cat version of canned tomato soup. 

Comfort food for sure!

Amazing! Made it for my family for the first time. And they loved it. I did added 1/2 - 3/4 inches of water to bottom of pan before pouring tomato soup on rolls. I was afraid it was gonna burn. it didn't burn, it slowly simmered for 45 mins.

I made a few changes and made it like my mom did. The less steps the better,  I say.  For every pound of ground beef, I mixed one can of stewed tomatoes in the meat and instead of rice and seasonings, I use 1 box of Spanish Rice a Roni, rice and seasonings packet. This gives it a great flavor. That's it. And instead of tomato sauce.  I pour tomato juice over the top of the rolls before cooking. The more juice, the more you have to use on your cooked rolls when serving and to pour over your mashed potatoes.

I used basmati rice as it holds up so well and also added a packet of dry onions soup and cut back on the fresh onions.  I baked the rolls in a roaster at 325 for 1 1/2 hours.  Yummmy.

Was a good base recipe.   I added some extra seasoning and a half pound of hot italian sausage to the meat mixture.   I also doubled the sauce recipe and added some Worcestershire and a tbs of sugar.  It was very tasty.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup and I baked it in the oven at 375 for an hour instead of in a skillet.  It was VERY good.  This was my first time making stuffed cabbage rolls.  Definitely would recommend!!!

I used the recommendation of another poster and put some lemon juice and worchsteshire sauce in the pan with the soup. 

I also added a whole head of garlic to the meat because my family loves garlic. I used garlic in the water instead of salt because my mom is very sensative to salt, so the cabbages absorbed some of that flavor too!

Lastly, I used the remaining gravy from the cooking as a sauce. It was delicious poured over top of the rolls.

This was the first time I have ever made cabbage rolls and they were great. I did use to cans of soup though.  When I will probably add just a tiny bit more salt and chopped bell pepper. I would also like to try it with tomato sauce to see which I like better.

This turned out to be a very simple recipe to follow... I changed it up a little by using 1/2 ground Elk and 1/2 Lean Ground beef. I wanted to keep the fat content lean ... but because elk is very lean I did need to add a little fat so I used a lean ground beef with it.... It came out awesome, and everyone seemed to enjoy it EVEN my pickiest eat said they liked it.

I've made this several times after 1st seeing the recipe less than a month ago.  My family LOVES it!  Instead of cooking the stuffed cabbage rolls on top of the stove, I bake them in a casserole dish.  The remaining tomato soup is poured on top of the rolls.  I use any remaining soft cabbage to cover the rolls.  I cover the dish with foil and bake in an oven pre-heated to 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Turns out well every time!  Thanks for sharing you recipe!

I was torn between rating this a 3 and 4 star. I went with 4 stars because I think the recipe has potential. The cabbage rolls were ok as is. Next time I will use tomato sauce, double the sauce, and add a ton more seasoning (it was bland). If you can only get your hands on a medium sized head of cabbage you will need more like 10-12 leaves.

Just made this and it was my first attempt at cabbage rolls.  They are awesome!  I wrapped each cabbage roll with bacon and baked them instead of cooking on the stovetop.  Love these and will be making them again soon!

This recipe was good but..... I  had to make changes to the gravy.  My polish mom always made the inside and the cabbage as you did.  But our gravy had tomato soup, lots of onion slices, brown sugar,  plus Heinz Ketchup.  It had to be Heinz too.  I don't get that but Its always perfect....1 cup water and  a whole can of tomato soup.  Broth to your liking!! Beef.

I've been making  stuffed cabbage for 50 years.  But to still soften the cabbage leaves in boiling water is old-fashioned and messy.  Just put them in a microwave on low for a minute or so -- 2 or 3 leaves at a time.  Faster, neater, easier.

I'm trying one new recipe a week, so I can get a variety of lunches for work.  This recipe is a keeper.  I cooked it in the slow cooker overnight, and it was ready to go in the morning.  Only change I made recipe-wise was to replace the white rice with "Royal Blend" of red, white, brown, and wild rices.  Nice texture, delicious food, and easy to transport to work.

We really liked the recipe, just added some garlic.  Also followed the suggestion in the reviews to put the whole head of cabbage in boiling water for about 5 minutes and then place in cold water.  It really helped with getting the cabbage leaves off.

This was good, of course like any recipe I use the base and then use the creative mind, bit... I used pork instead of beef and added a hint of sage.  I also added a cup of red wine, fresh grated tomatoes and chopped tomatoes to the sauce whilst cooking, and added it to the slow cooker with a stalk of celery on top... It was scrumptious... thanks for the recipe..

These turned out so good!  I doubled the recipe and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the meat.  I also doubled the soup so there would be lots of sauce. I lined my baking dish with the extra cabbage leaves as another person suggested to keep the bottoms of the rolls moist. I baked the dish at 350 for 1 hour covered then another 30 minutes uncovered.  Everyone loved it!  I will make this one again!

Love this recipe, but I make my own version of a red sauce or home made tomato soup to use.  I have also started making this as an open pot mix instead of making the rolls. I make the ground beef and onion together, drain and set aside, while a 1/2 c rice cooks in another pot.  I coursely chop the cabbage and stir fry it, then mix it all together with red sauce for a one plate meal.  Much easier for me.  Add Hoff Sauce for the perfect finishing touch!

I did make a couple changes, I added red pepper flakes to the mixture as well as some parsley. I didn't have tomato soup but I did have tomato juice so used it instead, worked great. I baked it for 60 min's at 350 degrees.

This will now be my go to St. Patrick's day recipe.  I basically followed the recipe but since I didn't have any ground beef or sausage on hand I used a corned beef brisket.  When partially thawed I trimmed off the fat and ground it up in the food processor and then followed the directions as specified. Unbelievably delicious.

This was really delicious and reminded me of the galumpkis my grandmother used to make.  I cooked them for 60 minutes on the stove and was glad I did so.  I added a small can of plain tomato sauce during cooking.  Next time I make them I am going to sauté the onions prior to mixing them with the beef.  They weren't as soft as I would have liked.

My mother was Ukrainian and here's her genius tip: freeze the raw cabbage heads. When they thaw, the leaves are soft and pliable, easy to stuff. No pre-cooking required and they taste wonderful!

I was ready to toss everything into the garbage because the cabbage leaves were ripping apart and making it tough to wrap the hamburger. I decided to core the cabbage and pull the leaves off from the bottom and they pulled right off without ripping.
Very tasty and enjoyed by all. I will make them again, now that I can get the cabbage leaves off  without ripping them to shreds.

I really didn't change this too much. It was an easy recipe to follow. Just added a little extra black pepper and some garlic powder. Next timeIi might add some crushed tomatoes to the sauce. Only because we had leftovers and the sauce was almost completely gone after reheating. This recipe will go in my family cookbook for sure.

These were so good! Just like my Gram used to make. I always try to make a recipe as close to the original as possible. I doubled the recipe. For the sauce, I used 1 (15) oz can of tomato sauce, 1 can of tomato soup,  2 tbs of brown sugar and 1 tsp of worcestershire.  So good. Everyone liked these.

Super easy! I added some more spices (Mrs. Dash, a little dill, etc.) and I used extra sauce on top. I'll definitely use this recipe again, but I'll be adding more cooked rice to the mix.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have any condensed soup so I substituted with tomato sauce, nor did I have any onions, and it tasted great. I also made a vegetarian version with pinto beans instead of beef and loved it.

Used the Core recipe but added 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon rice vinager to the tomato soup. Placed it in the crock pot on the lowest setting for 6 hours. When we got home it was done. It came out awesome.

Yummy! I boiled the head of cabbage in lightly salted water to get the leaves off easier. Instead of putting them in a pan on the stove I put them in a Pyrex dish and put them in the oven at 350 for an hour. I put a can of tomato soup on the bottom of the dish and one over the rolls as one can just didn't seem like enough. I will be adding these to my recipe book and can guarantee I will be making these again!

Not bad, but definitely needs more sauce.  Next time I would probably use something other than tomato soup.

I made these and followed the recipe except for my own tweeks with the seasoning and I shredded some of the leftover cabbage and mixed it in the filling. I also added a handful of raisins to the sauce. They were perfect. I will make them more often.

This was fun and a little challenging for me to make. When it was all said and done, mine were not as pretty as the picture, but they tasted amazing! I used ground turkey, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly. This wasn't enough for the way my family eats, so next time I'll double up, but will for sure make this again!  Even  my picky little princess liked it! Making this made me feel like what I imagine culinary school to be like. Tasty meat treat!

Omg...I'm 70 years old and I remember my grandmother making these.  This is the recipe she used. In any event, it's been around for ages.  It's quite tasty and takes you back to grandma's days.  There are fancier and better recipes developed over the years but this is where it all started.

My mother made stuffed cabbage, and this is exactly how she made it!  One of my fave dishes, with mashed potatoes, the tomato soup 'gravy' is excellent with it and another veggie.  Awesome to see it here.

I'm not a fan of cabbage OR tomato soup, but I wanted to make 'em for my hubby. He LOVED them! I must say, the soup really did add a good flavor, and I actually enjoyed these very much. The leftovers, I swear, tasted better.  Had some difficulty getting the cabbage leaves off without tearing them, but with the help of toothpicks (which I counted!), the presentation came out OK. Can someone tell me how best to get those things off w/out tearing them up?

My family loved this recipe. It seemed the easiest so I gave it a go. I did boil the whole cabbage, and as each layer cooked I would peel it off. Good idea to cut around the core before boiling. I did however add more seasoning, and also added more sauce. It does depend on the person but I did fineley crushed Italian stewed tomatoes and mixed it with spaghetti sauce which made the sauce thicker which we enjoyed

There aren't many spices in this one.  I added about a table spoon of black pepper,  teaspoon cinnamon,  and probably half teaspoon each oregano and basil.   I also added a chopped green pepper. .  I didn't use any salt because I thought the soup would add enough salt.  Great!

My husband approved of these cabbage rolls.  I read the various reviews and found them helpful.  Like others, I added canned tomatoes to increase the liquid content since I grew up with a cross between cabbage rolls and soup.  I also used half lean ground beef and half ground pork (again... reminiscent of family memories.  Yum!

Not so much a review, rather a little tip.  Core the cabbage and put them in a produce bag (the free ones all over the produce departments).  Microwave about 5 minutes.  Leaves peal off like a breeze.  Re-microwave heads until all usable leaves come off.  Former restaurant owner who made several hundred rolls a day.  Hands down best way to get your leaves!!

This was delicious.  This was the first time I made stuffed cabbage rolls.  I took one reviewers suggestion and boiled the cabbage in the microwave.  I also used minute rice.  Both were time savers.  I cooked it in the oven for about 2 hours.  My husband loved it too.  I will definitely make it again and again.

This is overall a really good recipe...I tried doing it on short notice, so it didn't turn out exactly right, but that's my fault, not the recipe's;) I did make a few changes, where I added garlic, and onion powder, and then baked it in the oven over a bed of sauerkraut and tomatoes at 425 oprox. 1h. or so  to speed up the cooking. I've never been great with cabbage rolling so they didn't come out perfectly, but it's not the looks that matters, right;)

This is the basic cabbage roll recipe I have used for years and I love it. What I do different is to add one cup of sauerkraut to the can of tomato soup before I pour it over the top of the rolls. I also bake it in the oven. I love the taste the sauerkraut adds!  I put my head of cabbage in a glass bowl with some water and cover it with plastic wrap and microwave for 5-7 min to soften the leaves.

I made this dish and adapted several of the other reviewers' modifications.  It turned out really moist and flavorful: 1) Broke off the leaves, cored them, then boiled them.  I boiled for 4 minutes but noticed they ripped too much.  Next time, I'll only boil them for a couple of minutes.  2)  Added a packet of onion soup mix to the meat mixture, which added loads of flavor.  3) Sweat the onions first before adding it to the meat mixture, since I hate the taste of raw onions.  4) Made a different mixture to pour over the stuffed cabbage before baking (1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon of maple syrup, 1/2 lemon juice, 1 teaspoon worscestershire sauce, salt and pepper to taste).  This makes plenty of sauce to serve over a pasta on the side too.  5) Covered and baked for an hour .  Enjoy!

Of course I altered this recipe as I do with every recipe I make (except my Mom's). The one thing I did do differently was I am growing broccoli this winter and it is failing to flower. So I have these huge broccoli leaves and this is what I have used instead of cabbage. Wonderful and slightly different (added stalk to turkey, sausage and rice ingredients) and at least I didn't have to throw away the plant from lack of flower production.  Thank you for recipe.

I made this for dinner with no substitution.  I did bake instead of the stove top cooking. I found the meat to be a little bland, but other than that very good. Next time I will add some spices for flavor to the meat mixture.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in the oven. They tasted great even though I accidently used extra lean ground pork instead of ground beef!  I didn't need extra sauce, the amount called for in the recipe was sufficient to cover all the rolls. I replaced the 10.75 oz condensed tomato soup with a mix of tomato paste, fresh chopped tomato and tomato pasta sauce.

This is a weekly staple in our house. A little time consuming, so it's not exactly a "quick, fast, weeknight dinner," but if you're willing to put in the time, delicious!

Used the suggestion of 1 can tomato sce, 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 1 tbsp. lemon juice and 1 tsp. worcestershire for the sauce, however, I doubled it, which was perfect. I also baked it at 350 for 90 mins. Since we like spice, I added cajun seasoning and garlic. Overall, an excellent recipe that is easily tweaked to your taste.

This was awsome!! I'm not one to try new things but it looked fun to make. It's very easy. I didn't have tomato soup so I used a can of tomato sauce with 1/4 cup of chicken broth. Definitely making this as a regular dish!!

These were absolutely delicious, and easy to make. I was making meatloaf for the kids last night, and decided to keep some meatloaf mixture aside to stuff in cabbage rolls for the adults...I should have made double!

The recipe as written was very good. I took the advice of someone else and used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the soup, because it seemed healthier. Bad idea. The crushed tomatoes were too thick and burned the bottom of the cabbage rolls. By the time I returned to look, they were ruined. I'll stick with the soup from now on.

The dish turned out beautifully, but I was somewhat disappointed in the outcome regarding taste. I made it as described except I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato soup because that is what I had. I found it very very bland as written. Not sure I'll make it again, maybe the secret was in the soup. Was not a hit with the whole crowd.

This is a quick week night meal for the two of us.  I'm not fond of tomato soup from the can so the only thing I change is to a small can of tomato sauce and a can of petite diced.  It's so awesome!!  Thank you for sharing, Judy.

This is the first time I have ever attempted cabbage rolls and it turned out delish. I made a few changes to the original. Added a packet of onion soup mix to the meat mixture. added 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and some garlic powder to tomato sauce. I like my food saucy so I used a can of tomato soup, a can of tomato sauce and 1/2 of a can of diced tomatoes. Turned out great. Thank for the great start recipe.

Family loved it! The only thing I added was some fresh parsley. The tomato soup sauce was better than expected.

I made the stuffed cabbage recipe as is and my family and I thought it was bland.  It definitely needs more flavor. The cooking process was tedious having to based often. I would have preferred to bake it. So I only  give one thumbs up to the chef.

I cored and froze the cabbage in a plastic bag; took it out the night before to thaw in the sink... this preserves the flavour of the cabbage rather than steaming it.
I also added a can of tomatoes in the italian seasoning.  
Excellent recipe.

First time trying this recipe. It was easy, delicious and my family loved it. The only thing I did different was to make it with a tomatillo sauce instead of tomato sauce.

This was absolutely delicious and I was so proud of my first attempt at making the rolls.  Grumpy loved them!  I used ground venison and had leftover rice so I just used that (1 cup) as well as increased the onion (1 small) and added a good few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.  My mom always baked these in the oven but I really like cooking these on the stovetop.  Great method!

Super easy to prepare. I used tomato sauce instead of the soup, and instead of cabbage leaves I used collard greens (blanch them for a minute or so)- they are so easy to roll up. I cooked the rolls in the oven for 1 1.2 hour at 350F. My boys loved them!

This was very good and not as difficult as I anticipated. I used diced tomatoes on top of the rolls instead of tomato soup, and served with boiled cubed potatoes mixed with some of the leftover cabbage after I got the good leaves off. My husband really enjoyed it.

First time making this, turned out well. Parboiled cabbage leaves for 5 minutes, cooled down with cold water in a colander. Made some slight changes to recipe. I used whole grain converted rice chopped green pepper with the meat. For the sauce one 5.5 oz can of V8 whisked together with an 8 oz tomato sauce and added chunky black bean/corn salsa with a glug-glug of Worcestershire sauce. Decided to bake it in a 9x13x2 glass covered with foil for one hour at 375, then uncovered for 20 minutes. Came out great -- since I'm single, I'll be eating it for the next few days. Very good.

I used the tomato sauce that one reviewer on here had advised, and it still didn't save the dish.  They were O.K, but it seems like a lot of work to just produce an "O.K" meal. Pretty bland.

I made these with a few changes.  I used ground beef and ground sausage. I used a pack of onion soup mix and added fresh parsley. I baked on a bed of sauerkraut on low heat for a few hours.  I served with mashed potatoes.  It was fabulous

loved it!!! made only change to the type of sauce. used tomato sauce and chopped onions 10.5 ounce cans each. i also cooked the rice in 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water. it was dificult seperating the cabbage leaves but with patience i aovercame. then i parboiled them for a couple of minutes to soften. simmered in an electric skillet for 45 minutes. totally awesome!!! hope my mother doesnt see this cause i think they are better than hers. lol. sorry mom.

Very good. I did use some options that others suggested.  1/2 ground beef-1/2 sausage.  I used 15 oz. tomato sauce and 15oz diced tomatoes w/olive oil & oregano.  Slow cooked for 8 hours.  Tasty!

Love this recipe with spaghetti sauce instead of  tomato soup and wish it didn't take so long to make but it would have been super bland with only the tomato soup. The sauce gave it just the right amount of flavor.

Loved this meal.  Someone shopped for me and got me purple cabbage.  I didn't have time to go back to the store so I tried to make do = it's much thicker than green cabbage, so I boiled it longer but it still was too stiff most of the time, and too hard to peel off the head, even after 20 min. in the freezer, as suggested by many.  But the meat mixture is delicious.  I combined aspects of other cabbage roll recipes and did it in the crock pot over sauerkraut and tomato sauce on top.  Everyone really liked it, but I will be sure to specify green cabbage next time!

I used brown rice instead of white for a little more nutrition, and subbed a jar of marinara sauce instead of the tomato soup to create more sauce.  Delicious, classic recipe!

Delicious, this was my first time making cabbage rolls and I can say I need a little practice, I did take the advice of some of the other reviewers, but think I will re-read some of the tips to keep my leaves from falling apart and getting stuck to my casserole dish. All in all it was a wonderful dish and I will make it again.

I've had amazing cabbage rolls at a local Polish restaurant and decided to try my hands at making them. Wasn't really feeling this recipe, though, sorry. It was very bland. The stuffing needed a lot more seasoning. A 15oz can of tomato sauce+water from the cabbage during the simmer made plenty of sauce for all the rolls.

This was a tasty recipe but I did change a few things.  Instead of all beef burger I added equal parts ground pork and hamburger, and instead of tomatoe soup I cooked in beef broth and drizzle light Karo syrup over each roll.  I've been making this recipe for over 30 years and alway get raves at the table.

Cabbage is so reasonable & so good, & these cabbage rolls are better than some I ate at a local Greek restaurant! If you have some leftover homemade marinara, it works better than canned tomato soup!

Great dish ...I enyoj it and my family to . 
In my country we are making it with sauerkraut leaves  ,  meat rice, onion are the same  ....then put around  chopped sauerkraut , tomato juice and some water , plus  few slices of beacon . ITs winter dish called "SARMA"  ,  and is best if you make bit more , then warm it ... as much more you warm it , tasted better.

This was a very tasty dinner! The meat turned out surprisingly tender. I made a few modifications with the suggestions of other members. I used Prego sauce instead of tomato soup. I also made spaghetti and used the stuffed cabbage rolls as meat balls. The only negative comment or suggestion or what have you is that the recipe asks the 20 minutes for the rice and 40 minutes for the rolls but I followed the recipe as it suggested and I nearly burned the meal. I cooked the rice for about 10 minutes and the rolls for about 30 minutes and it turned out just fine! Yummy!

Honestly, it was bland and not very tasty.  I wouldn't make it again. However, stuffing cabbage rolls isn't nearly as hard as it sounds.

A very simple "almost homemade" recipe (because of the use of tomato soup, which is what my mother used to do.)  Try adding a cup of raisins to the sauce during the cooking as many homemade Polish recipes do call for.

I have never made this before but remember my mom making something like it years ago. This was fantastic! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and thought it gave a wonderful flavor! Next time I'm considering using spaghetti/tomato sauce for a more thicker consistency. I also added some garlic powder to the meat mixture. We had this with scalloped potatoes and a side salad. Absolutely wonderful! Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

I used veggie crumble, day old tomato brochette, omitted the egg, and used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup as it has high fructose corn syrup in it. Baked it in the oven for 30 minutes. Thanks for the idea!!

This is a really good and easy recipe. It turned out really good. I just have to make a note on the amount of seasoning because my husband thought it was a little bland...I guess I scarred to put a lot of salt as it was my first time making stuffed cabbage. Overall, it was delicious!:)

Me and my family, of which I am the only one who enjoys cooked cabbage, loved this dish. Even my veggie activist 4-year old almost completely cleaned her plate without complaint. WOW!!! We did use the tomatoe sauce with worstichire and lemon jiuce version although we are garlic lovers so of course I threw about a heaping tablespoon of it in. It was great and has been added to my family cook book. Thanks!!!!!

This is a great basic recipe.  When I make cabbage rolls I also add sauerkraut and sliced lite kielbasa  over the rolls before I pour on the tomato sauce.  My family and friends love it.

I left the cabbage leaves in the water too long.  They fell apart and I ended up just throwing them in the skillet with the rest of the ingredients.  I served this with mashed potatoes.  The boys all loved it.

This was much more difficult than I expected.  The cabbage leaves fell apart and it was just a mess.  It was delicious but will be a long time before I try this again.  I wish that I would have read the review about freezing the head of cabbage first.  I struggled with the leaves falling apart.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. The only thing that I would change is to add some spagetti sauce to the meat mixture and maybe some more veggies as well.  They tasted good this way just think it could be even better with added favors.

Never made cabbage rolls before, and these were good.  I might try them with marinara sauce next time, not too sure about the tomato soup.  My kids didn't care for them, but I knew they wouldn't.  My husband loved it.  Did add some worchestershire sauce, and lemon to the meat mixture as some reviews suggested.  Served with some noodles.

I loved this dish.  My mother used to make this but stopped making it so when I saw this recipe i was geared up to make it.  I did do a few changes.  I, like others, put some garlic in mine, I also added a can of rotel, & a little barbeque sauce to give it a taste.  It was WONDERFUL.  I will keep this receipe.  Thanks for sharing

Thank you Mary Domaz for your review.  Your additions sound just like MY Polish grandmother used to make, but we never had a recipe for it.  I will make this with your additions and I am sure it will be authentic.  Thanks again :).

I am from a polish family & have made these for years  with only a slight variation. I use GROUND PORK instead of beef.  We also like alot of sauce so I ad one jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce to the soup that I pour on top of the stuffed rolls.  Pop in the oven for 1 hour.  Outstanding!

This is very similar with the romanian national dish "sarmale". The difference is that the cabage is pickled. In Romania we have polenta as a side dish for sarmale.

The recipe was  easy to follow, I took the suggestion from the other reviews and used pasta sauce instead of tomato soup. They tasted great, the only problem I found was that they were a little dry, so next time I would use more sauce.

My husband and I did not like this at all.  It was very very bland and just tasted really off...nothing like stuffed cabbage we've had before.  Not sure why it's rated so high but that's just my opinion :) I will continue to search for a good stuffed cabbage recipe.

I made this with ground bison and used two cans of organic uncondensed tomato basil soup. It was soupy to begin with, but it kept everything moist, and after cooking most of the water evaporated so it was just right. I'll definitely make this again!

I was slightly nervous of this recipe, never eaten cabbage rolls before.  My husband has just eaten left overs for his lunch and asked when we can have them again!!   My only alterations were to use partly cooked brown rice, omit the salt, add a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the soup and to bake the rolls for 90 minutes instead of boiling (I didn't need toothpicks).

We have a pasture raised beef quarter that included a lot of ground beef, so I have been experimenting with new ways to use it.  These cabbage rolls were excellent, expecially when I substituted home canned tomato sauce that had a little cinnamon and clove in it for the tomato soup.  I also added an entire can of diced tomatoes.  I am not sure how a single can of soup would have created enough sauce for them.  Also, I got 12 rolls, but that my have been because I was being conservative.  They are even better the next day.

I'm still cooking them, but there needs to be some liquid added to the tomato soup. I mixed a a few tablespoons of salsa with about two tablespoons of water and mixed it in. The cabbage rolls stuck to the pan.

Wow! Absolutely love this recipe! It's stuffed cabbage rolls as simple as you can make them. The only thing I tweaked was the meat, I'm vegetarian so I substituted Morningstar's Meal Starters Meat Crumbles- it was perfect! And the fact that it freezes well is wonderful, I'm in college and I'm always looking for quick/easy/tasty recipes that can be made in a large batch and eaten later. Bravo, loved it!

This is the first thing my 3 year old ever ate that I did not have to fight with her over.  Also we had some left over filling and a small head of cabbage so I ended up steaming the cabbage and shredding it and then mixed it with the filling in a frying pan.  Turned out good left overs.  also added some basil and parsley.  Ok I think thats it lol but yeah a great dish :D

this is totally different than what we normally have for dinner, and I have to say, it was a nice break. some changes: I also added Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and lemon. I used ham instead of hamburger (based off of a Julia Childs recipe,) and bread crumbs instead of rice since I accidentally burned the rice... I also baked in the oven, and lined the pan with leftover cabbage to avoid burning. it turned out pretty good! it was a little salty, so it probably could have gone without any added salt & Worcestershire sauce. I'd definitely make this again, next time with just a little less salt, and maybe I'll try adding brown sugar.

Thank you!!! My Mom used to make this for us as kids (I am a grandmother now), but I never wrote down a recipe. Every other recipe never included the brown sugar and yours did.  My son asked for this, he remembered it as a child going to my Mom's house for dinner. It was delicious and he loved it.  Said" this is it Mom!"

This was really good for a base recipe.    I will share what worked for me.  I added half a pound of ground sausage, an extra cup of rice, and some chili sauce to the filling.  For the sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomato sauce, and a can of tomato soup.  I baked them in the oven at 425 degrees for one hour and they were amazing.  I like the filling to be very moist as well the cabbage needs to be good and soft and this way I accomplished both.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and simple to make!  I took another users suggestion of adding brown sugar, lemon and worshteshire sauce to the tomato mixture.  I also found that it was easy to seperate the cabbage leaves and then steam them before filling them.  I also used the outer leaves and placed them as a lining around the inside of the pot so that the cabbage rolls wouldn't get damaged during cooking.

DELICIOUS! I have made this a few times already, and they come out perfect every time. The preparation is a little time-consuming, but the end result is worth it.  I do parboil the cabbage... the leaves come off effortlessly this way! I omit the onions, but I leave everything else exactly as written. My boyfriend and I gobble these right up! Thanks for the recipe!

I made it last night with roasted potatoes. It turns out great. I did add more chopped onion and Italian seasoning. I baked for 45 minutes. The hardest part of this recipe is peeling the leaves off the head of cabbage. I did peel it from the top down. It's seemed to work better. Great recipe. Thanks!

I made this for people who don't like cabbage and it was completely devoured in minutes.  I added garlic and chopped onion but I do that with absolutely everything.

First of all, this recipe is beyond my expertise as I could not get the cabbage leaves off the head without breaking them. The few that I did get off, I could not roll. And the strange concoction that came of this attempt, was a pairing of bland cabbage (all the good spicy flavor was boiled off) and tomato rice.

thanks for the recipe. i changed it a lot because i was in a huge rush. i used bite sized pieces of lamb which i pan fried. then cooked the rice in a rice cooker. i made my own sauce with tomato paste and italian seasoning and added a bit of cumin and a lot of red pepper. ( my hubby likes it spicey. thanks again.

This is a nice basic recipe for stuffed cabbage. I made a few changes. I did add the sauce/sugar/spices mentioned before. I also did half tomato sauce/half soup but the soup tastes so tinny to me and overpowers it. I added a little wine to the sauce and it helped. Next time I will use all tomato sauce-possibly wine based with chopped up garlic in it.

Love how easy it is to make. I just moved into a tiny studio apartment..having to learn to cook on an electric double eye hot plate basically. I was able to prepare these cabbage rolls in a small place. I also added some diced green pepper to the rolls and stewed tomatoes for an extra serving of veggies..
my very picky boyfriend loved them..once he got past the thought he was eating cabbage!! Thanks

I hadn't made stuffed cabbaged rolls in years, so I decided to try this recipe.  It is superb!  Vert tasty.  I made the remaining cabbage into sauteed cabbage and added a little cut up tomatoes, salt and pepper.  An excellent compliment to these rolls.  YUMMY!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I added garlic powder to the sauce mixture, added some sauce to the meat mixture before stuffing the cabbage, and quadrupled the sauce recipe.  (My husband likes a lot of sauce to put on top of the mashed potatos that are a must with this recipe).

Thank you for great tips and advice about cooking this recipe.  I followed the ones that appealed to me and OMGosh, it came out great!  My fiance cringed when I told him that we were having a meal of Stuffed Cabbage.  Once he tried it, he loved it and now he keeps asking when I'll cook it again.

This recipe was okay.  Although, this recipe was quick and easy.  I prefer the stuffed cabbage rolls that are cooked for a long time. They are more flavorful!   I think I will stick to my old recipe!

I make this recipe often and it's delicious. My family likes extra sauce so I always add a can of stewed tomatoes. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly.

Yummy!!  I used half ground beef and half ground turkey, cooked both first as another review stated.  I also added 1T each brown sugar and lemon juice to the tomato soup for the sauce.  Definitely worth the work!!

I thought it was a great recipe. I did do some things differently. I used 1.20 lbs of cooked ground beef. I made a total of 17 rolls, putting about a spoonful of mix in each. I suggest using 2-4 toohpicks, depending on the roll. I then added 1 can of tomato soup, and 1 can of water for my first batch of 8. And another for my second batch of 9. I brought the soup to a boil, but simmered for 20 minutes, instead of 40. It came out just as great. I have never tired these before, and so since thsi was my first time making, and eating them, i was very satisfied. My grandmom used to make them for my mother all the time when she was younger, and she said they tasted better then hers,in a way, because she used to bake them, where as thsi recipe cooks them on stovetop. I found it very simple and tastey.

Okay, I a thrilled with the recipe as well as all the comments I read on this.  So I borrowed from many and came up with this change: 1 heinz tomato soup (more runny), 1 large can spiced up tomato sauce, 2 tbsp brown sugar, worchestshire sauce in the meat mixture, consisting of ground pork and beef.  I cooked it on high in the slow cooker for 4 1/2 hours.

I really loved these and they were so easy to make.  My boyfriend said they were just as good as his Ukranian grandmother used to make.  I made them for the first time overseas where I couldn't get tomato soup, but tomato sauce worked just as well.

This was fantastic! After carefully reading the previous reviews. I used many of the suggestions along with my own, and the results were amazing! I used 1 c ckd jazmine rice; 4 clv garlic; 3 dash worche. sauce; 2 cans tomatoe sce w/ garlic; 1 tbs brwn sgr, and 3 strips of bacon. Sautee the bacon, and place rolls in pan w/ bacon and allow to simmer. Pour sauce over rolls and top with onions for flavor. This went over well with my southern cooking husband!

A 5 star recipe with the sauce submitted by Mary with the worchestire, brown sugar, and tomato paste. Without that sauce I would give it 3 and a half. I wanted to add that we use ground sirloin and use a very deep casserole or dutch oven and add skinned, chunked potatoes and kielbassa. It gives both the potateos and kielbassa and the cabbage rolls a really great flavor.

This recipe is nice and easy.  I learned how to make it just a little different.  I learned how on the slow cooker and we add raisins.  You prepare the night before and let cook all day.  So that by dinner your mouth is watering and you can't even wait for it to cool down.

Delicious and much easier to make than I expected. My husband grew up eating these and he said this recipe was just right. I would recommend using large cabbage leaves because I used small ones and had much more beef mixture than I could use.

This was my first time making cabbage rolls and they turned out great.  I par-boiled the head of cabbage for 7-8 minutes which made the leaves much easier to come off in one piece.  I added garlic powder to the hamburger mixture.  I also used one can of tomato soup and one small can of tomato sauce.  I heated these together with worcestire and brown sugar per others suggestions.  This was easy but did take longer to put together than recipe indicated.  Could have been because it was my first time making these.  I baked in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour 5 minutes.

It was pretty good!  I did add some garlic powder and seasoning salt to the meat mixture though.

Yummy! Didn't use tomato soup because I didn't have any...just used homemade canned tomato juice mixed with a small can of tomato paste. And I forgot the egg...other than that it was all the same and it was good!

These were good. I added 1 tbs of steak sauce to the meat mixture and some of Emerils essence. I also microwaved the cabbage in order to remove the leaves. It was still a little difficult though. I baked my cabbage rolls in a 350 oven for about an hour and fifteen minutes. Tasted good.

Great recipe, though 2-4 minutes was not enough to completely cook the cabbage leaves; I had to unwrap and cook up the leaves after taking the dish out of the oven (baked in oven instead of on skillet). I didn't use tomato soup and instead pureed diced tomatoes to make a thicker sauce, as recommended by another reviewer.

Good sauce, something needed in the mix that goes inside to give it a little more flavor.  Not a huge cabbage fan, but a great dinner alternative to all the normal stuff.  A little hot sauce gives it some spice if you like it that way.

We loved this recipe! I wasn't sure about it when I was making it because I have never had cabbage and beef together. I've only had cabbage with ham in my lifetime so I wasn't sure if I'd like the combination but it turned out great. I added some extras to the beef mix like worcestershire and garlic, basil and brown sugar because plain tomato sounded a little bland to me. Thanks!

This recipie is just for basic cabbage rolls. I like to spice things up a bit, so I added shredded zuccini and carrots to it. I also added both green and white onions. Turned out great!

I used 2 cans of tomato bisque and some onion soup mix to try and zest things up a little and...nothing.  For all the work involved, I expected much better.  Won't make again.

This recipe was wonderful!  I was hesitant at first because I'm not a fan of cabbage.  I slow cooked it all day in the crockpot on low.  For the ingredients, I mixed 1/2lb of hamburger with 1/2lb of mild italian sausage.  I also took some ideas from the previous reviews and added some worchester sauce and garlic to the meat mixture.  I didn't have any condensed tomato soup so I used some canned tomato sauce instead.  I will definately make this again and the hubby loved it. Great comfort food!

Aside from the fact that I had an incredibly hard time keeping the cabbage leaves in tact, the dish was fairly simple to make. Time-consuming, but simple. It was the first time I made, and ate, cabbage rolls. Loved it.

Not bad...made in crock pot and used venison and brown rice.  Added quite a bit of garlic and spices to meat but that's probably because of the taste of the venison.

I made these over the weekend. I followed the advice of others who suggested I should season the meat more. I did that, I also seasoned the tomato soup. I did use two cans of soup because one didnt seem like enough. Im going to be trying this in the crockpot. Its a great base recipe.

This was very good - I added garlic for seasoning and doubled the recipe cooking 1/2 on the stove and the others in the oven.  By far the stovetop were best! The sauce really cooks down and is more flavorful on the stovetop.

Worked out great!  the only deviations i did was i cooked 1 cup uncooked rice (it's easier to cook a full cup) and i added a little water in the pan with the rolls and soup to add more moisture and prevent sticking to the fying pan!  Very Tasty!!!
