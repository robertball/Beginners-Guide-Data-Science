I used "soured" lactose-free nonfat milk and vegetable oil in this recipe. These turned out a little flat for me, even with the additional baking powder. Even so, the kids liked these just as much as "regular" pancakes. I topped these with my own homemade strawberry-raspberry jam.

I don't know how much healthier these are - especially after the family soaks them in syrup and more butter.  I didn't use the melted butter in the batter - instead I used 1 T. of canola oil.  (Saved the butter for the top.)

As Rachel would say...YUMMO! We loved these healthier pancakes! I have always used a mix from the store. To my surprise we had no mix in the house today so I got on Allrecipes.  I tweaked it just a tad. I used canola oil instead of the melted butter and I substituted half of the white flour for wheat flour.  For an extra bonus I added fresh blueberries.  My husband couldn't stop eating them!

I only put in a sprinkle of salt, if any. I used whole wheat white flour and add a mashed banana and/or applesauce for extra moistness, sweetness, flavor and nutrition. I omitted the butter and added vanilla. Then...my daughter said they were the best pancakes I ever made.

Delicious, yummyâ€¦more please!
These are the words my three children used when they were devouring these pancakes this morning.  One substitute I did was for the 2 tbsp of melted butter in which was 1 mashed medium banana.  We had topped the pancakes with sugar free syrup and fresh blueberries.  My table of judges which are 3, 3, and 5 and tend to be the pickiest eaters for everything had absolutely loved these pancakes as opposed to the buttermilk pancake mix from a box.

First time trying. Much better than any store bought I've ever had!
I skipped the salt, used oil instead of butter and egg substitue. I sampled the first one out of the pan, and it was really hard to wait until I was finished cooking to eat the rest!!! I won't be buying mix anytime soon!

This isn't a very "healthy" version but substitute WHOLE WHEAT PASTRY FLOUR 100% for the all purpose baking flour and you have a winner. I even substituted egg substitute for the egg, also use a little less liquid than called for to make fluffy pancakes. Works great.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a splash of vanilla. They had a strong flour taste but looked good. Next time I will modify them by adding cinnamon and brown sugar.  Good base recipe.

Wow!  This was so much better than I expected.  I forgot the sugar in the first batch, but added it in the second.  It definitely needs sugar, but only 2 tsp. is just fine.  Everything else I left as is.  My husband liked it much better than his Krustez box mix.  So light and so easy.

Easy! I used 1 and 1/4 cups of wholewheat flour and 1/4 cup of regular flour.
It was really great. Fluffy pancakes, delicious.

Followed recipe and the batter was too liquid to form pancakes. I had to add almost a full cup of flour to make it thick enough to cook.

Came out pretty good second time around I made a little twist to it came out better I thought.  Instead of flour I used left over baby cereal and instead of butter I used apple sauce. Made it a tiny bit healthier and still really good.

this is the second time that I try to make pancakes.. the first time I added way too much salt, i threw them right away; i've just tried this recipe and i've used a little bit more butter because the batter felt slightly too floury to me.. (or it is supposed to have that taste? the less butter, the better D:) I added small chunkes of dark chocolate because i cannot start the day without it and... what else? oh right, i also added a pinch of sugar more, i felt they wouldn't have a taste at all my pancakes.. Now i'm sitting in front of my computer with a dish of pancakes, two big strawberries and a cup of caffelatte; i reckon i've never started the day with so much joy!

Delicious, easy and versatile recipe. I used half whole wheat and half regular flour. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 mashed banana. They turned out moist and flavorful!

1teaspoon of salt is too much I followed the recipe to the letter and when they were done they were way too salty. I recommend using 1/4 teaspoon of salt or less.

I think it's my fault...I used the only salt I have which is sea salt so the pancakes are really salty.  Also, subbed coconut oil for butter.  It's not great.  Shoulda stuck with the butter.

Substituted 1/2 tbsp honey for sugar (healthier), used slightly less salt, slightly less milk (honey adds liquid, so reduce other liquids).  Would make again. :)

Not even close to good pancakes. I was hoping this recipe would be a good healthier substitute from our traditional ones I make from scratch but they just don't compare. They were not terrible but I won't be making them again.

Just made this a few hours ago, and I ended up tweaking a few things to make it actually healthy. For instance I used whole wheat flour instead, added cinnamon, ginger, lemon juice, vanilla, and instead of using real butter I used smart balance. All in all it was pretty good. I want to remake this using buckwheat flour next time.

It was delicious and very filling, first time I make or even have pancakes, I halved the recipe and substituted the butter with 1 tsp olive oil, dressed them with unsweetened strawberry jam. Next time will probably mix the jam with a tsp of honey or a zero cal sweetener.

I loved this recipe. I made a double portion, two whole eggs and two whites. Also substituted the butter with coconut oil.
    For flour I used all white whole wheat.
Pancakes came out fluffy and delicious but with a real hearty feel to them. Kids and adults all loved them.

This is my go-to healthier pancake recipe. I have made it as is, and they're delicious and fluffy. We usually substitute almond milk for dairy milk with success. We have also tried variations with coconut oil in place of butter and coconut sugar in place of white sugar. We typically add about a teaspoon of vanilla.

I didn't like this recipe much... There was way too much baking soda.

"Healthier" is a stretch, but they were delicious when I used the whole egg (leaving out the yolk is not necessarily healthier) and Stevia instead of sugar.

I used almonds milk in place of low fat milk, and added blueberries and a dash of cinnamon.

I am cutting calories where I can, and I don't want to miss out on breakfast with my family. I made these and added banana and strawberry rather than syrup.  These came out fluffy and delicious. The only modification I made was 1 whole egg, 1 egg white, and 3/4 tablespoon of sugar. They are just as filling and taste just as good as other pancakes.
