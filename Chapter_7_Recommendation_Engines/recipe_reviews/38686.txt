After reading the other reviews, I decided to make this dessert with the following changes to the topping: 1/4 cup (instead of 3/4 cup) white sugar, 1/2 Tbs cornstarch, 1/8 tsp cinnamon (instead of nutmeg).  I also reduced the amount of boiling water to slightly over 1/2 cup (instead of 1 cup).  The result was perfect!!  Not too sweet and not too soggy.  I'll be making this again tomorrow :)

If you can't find self rising flour, just add
1 tsp. each of baking soda and powder.  We forgot and added 1/2 to the sugar and the balance in the water.  It worked!!
Absolutely delicious.

Reading the other reviews before making the crisp I decided to turn up the heat to 365 and use cinnamon instead of nutmeg. It turned out pretty good, a little crisp and a littly cake like. Next time I will try reducing the amount of milk. The batter seemed crumblier without it and it might be crisper that way. Less sugar too, it was a little too sweet for me.

Very good and easy to make!  It took less than 5 minutes to prepare.  It called for WAY too much water, however.  If I made it again I would also add more blueberries, although that's just my personal taste, and it isn't really necessary.  I'll definitely be making this again.  I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.

Recipe was OK. Topping was to soft and mushy for my taste. I like my crisp a little crispier.

Unfortunately we didn't care for this because it was easy to make.  It wasn't crisp, but was cake-like on top.  I won't make it again but would suggest cinnamon instead of nutmeg.

I made this recipe using saskatoon berries, which are very similar to blueberries
but now quite as soft.  It turned out excellent, and my dinner guests all raved 
about it.  I served it warm with frozen yogurt or vanilla icecream.  I would like to
try it again with another type of fruit.  I especially appreciated that it is mad in a 
9" pan.  There are only three in our family and I don't like to have lots of leftover
dessert.  This was a perfect size for a dinner party for 6.  I will definitely keep and
use this recipe over and over again.

Tasted great, it reminded me more of a cobbler. Not as crispy as I expected but the flavors blended well together. Added a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar to the topping and served warm.

THIS WAS A VERY EASY DESSERT TO PREPARE.  I EVEN MESSED UP THE CORNSTARCH, SUGAR, AND BOILING WATER PART OF IT AND IT CAME OUT JUST FINE.  VERY TASTY~I DOUBLED IT SO I MADE IT IN A 9X13.  IT'S GREAT WITH COOL WHIP OR PLAIN!  BY THE WAY, IT'S MORE LIKE A COBBLER RATHER THEN A CRISP  :-)

I followed the instructions and baked it for 65 minutes but certainly did not get the "beautiful crust on top."  The flavor of the batter was great but it was soft and "mushy" and I was disappointed about not having a crust.  If someone, perhaps Patricia E. Gordy, the submitter could tell me the secret for getting a crusty top, I would try it again.

I give this 5 stars as a cobbler recipe, not as a crisp recipe. The only changes I made was that I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and left out the additional sugar in the berries. It was so yummy! I made this in individual ramekins and served it with vanilla ice cream. Its definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This was outstanding.  Served it for a family desert and everyone - 3yr old and 20 month old LOVED it.  I used 2 cups fresh blueberries and 1 cup thawed-frozen raspberries. Used butter instead of the margarine.  Cut the water to 3/4 cup and used about 1/2 sugar each time.  Also used cinnamon instead of the nutmeg.  My husband dished out the serving and he flipped it over so the crust was on the bottom and the berry filling was on the top.  Topped it with some cool whip and it was awesome!  Will use this recipe many many times.

Great recipe!  I found this several years ago but it used fresh peaches sliced in the bottom.  I couldn't believe how great it was with the blueberries.  I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't love this.  It is a crunchy cobbler and wonderful served warm with ice cream.

This was really good - some people made comments about there being too much sugar or there should have been cinnamon instead of nutmeg, but this wasn't a blueberry cobbler recipe, it was something different and it was delicious!  I followed the instructions exactly and it came out perfect!  It would have been even tastier with a scoop of vanilla ice cream but I didn't have any :(  Otherwise, this was perfect and we'll be making it again.  Thank you for sharing!

Very sweet... I did get a pretty nice crust, but it's more of a cobbler. I cut the sugar down as others had suggested, but it was still way sweet... less than 1/2 cup brown sugar should be good for the topping and no more than that for the batter.

This was pretty good with modifications ie) 1/4 cup brown sugar and cinnamon for topping;  1/2 cup boiling water;  Takes a long time to cook so not sure I would make it again.

A+ according to my husband! So good and so easy! It is definitely more like a cake instead of a crisp. I reduced the sure to 1/2 cup in the batter and 1/2 cup brown sugar in the topping. I added a pinch of salt and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I also reduced the water to 1/2 cup based on the other reviews and it was perfect! By reducing the sugar, using reduced fat margarine, and soy milk...it's a much less guilty pleasure! I will be making it again!

More like a cobbler recipe. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cups (total of 1 cup) each, yet it was still too sweet.  I also added one more cup of blueberries. Great with ice cream!

this is truly easy to make and very delicious. i put 1 cup of pears and 1 cup of blueberries and cut the amount of sugar by half. i agree that there was too much water called for but it does make a delicious sauce. i'm not sure if this was supposed to be like a cobbler since it wasn't crispy, but i will definitely make it again :)

I modified as follows: 1/2 c sugar for crust and topping, added 1 tsp baking powder and soda to regular flour, 1/4 tsp cinnamon instead of nutmeg, just over 1/2 c boiling water - just enough to cover crust so everything melted. Delicious and easy, not too sweet! Doesn't need ice-cream or anything with it!

We love this recipe!  It's easy to prepare and the crisp (which is more like cake), isn't soggy and has a bit of crunch on the top.  It is sweet, so we add a little less sugar.

i tried this recipe twice and both times it came out really really good.  I probably won't use any other recipe but this one because it's so easy and it goes well w/other fruits.  It's more like a cobbler tho but it is very tastey and easy!

I made this for my roommate's birthday. And we absolutely loved it. The topping is sweet enough to balance out early season blueberries that are tart. We will be making it again!

Nice, easy dessert- I also cut the cornstarch in half, as well as the sugar to 1/2 cup (down from 3/4 cup). I still used 1 cup of boiling water and it worked just fine, although it only needed 50 minutes to cook. I would also suggest adding a little vanilla.

This turned out wonderful!!  I used demerara sugar (raw sugar) which made a nice crunchy glaze on top and I used about 3 cups of blueberries.  Next time I might try it with less sugar to see if it was just as good like some of the reviews suggested.  But I will definitely use this recipe again.  Excellent!

I followed the recommedations of 2 reviews and used the baking powder and baking soda for the all-purpose flour.  Also 1/2 cup sugar   instead of 3/4 cups  and just 1/2 cup boiling water.  It is delicious.  Everyone loved it.  It is the best crisp I've ever had.

First I agree with other reviewers that this is more of a cobbler than a crisp.  Which was fine because that is what I wanted.  I used fresh Wild Maine Blueberries, about 3 cups.   I used butter instead of margarine, half whole wheat and half AP flour (added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt.)  I cut back to 1/2 C sugar for each 3/4 C.  Next time I will  cut back a little more.  It was quite sweet.  And I will cut back a little on the water also.  Very tasty, we enjoyed it very much!  Thank you

The first time I made this, we had people over for dinner and I had blueberries-chose this recipe for the simplicity. I used butter instead of margarine, but left everything else the same. Everyone loved it. I make whipped cream and that topped it. I loved the crisp topping and moist cake. I've also tweaked the recipe and using 1/2 cup sugar for the cake seems to work better since its not as sweet, but no one is the wiser..

I made this the other day with some fresh picked Alabama blueberries and it turned out great.  I didn't have any nutmeg only - so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. Also I used almost 3 cups of berries instead of two.  The crust turned out as described.  I would describe it as nice and crispy on top; yet it was softer on the inside. The secret to a good topping is butter instead of margarine (for those that cook with margarine).  I am definitely going to make this again.

Came out a little too mushy for my liking. Not my kind of recipe. But my husband did like it, but he said "it's nothing special", would NOT make again.

Gosh, it's just not a "crisp", at least not what I've come to know as a fruit crisp.  I'll stick with our usual topping recipe of oatmeal, nuts, flour, brown sugar, & butter etc.

Recipe is OK, but has cake rather than crisp on top.
I agree, use cinnamon rather than nutmeg.

I made this tonight !!! I made these adjustments - 1/2 cup sugar in the flour mixture. And only 1/4 cup to the topping mixture. And i only did 1/2 cup of boiling water. Family loved it. I plan on doing this with Peaches sometime this week.

This came out terribly and looks nothing like the picture. The consistency was mushy and the top crust was very dark. I will not make it again.

Very easy recipe, but VERY sweet! I definitely would cut the sugar in half. There were a few changes I made because I saw a lot of people ended up with a mushy crust instead of crispy.   I used Crisco instead of butter because I knew this would make a crispy crust. Since I didn't use butter, I added about 2 teaspoons of vanilla to add better flavor. I didn't have fresh blueberries, so I used frozen wild blueberries. I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.   Because I used frozen blueberries, I only used 1/2 cup water. For the extra sugar topping, I added 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch...I probably would add more next time, especially if I used the frozen blueberries. This way it would set up a bit more and be easier to spoon out. Again...USE 1/2 the SUGAR IT CALLS FOR...WAY TOO SWEET!  Overall, very nice flavors in this recipe. I definitely will use it again! The top came out crunchy and still had a bit of a cobbler-style inside - which I love.

What a yummy way to use up blueberries!  It was very tasty, however I thought the topping was a bit too sweet.  It would taste just fine if it was omitted, or cut back on the sugar!

Gluten-Free version for those who cannot tolerate gluten....
I love this recipe!  I am a celiac so I had to substitute 2/3 cup white rice flour and 1/3 cup potato starch flour for the 1 cup of self-rising flour in the recipe.  No problem.  It is delious.  We have prepared this crisp several times with a variety of fruit.  It is wonderful to be able to have dessert with the rest of the family!

I thought this recipe was amazing. Although it probably should be classified as more of a cobbler. Its definitely best right out of the oven! I made 1 change though, and that was I sprinkled more along the lines of 1/2 cup of sugar and just a little nutmeg on top. I also put the sugar mixture on the blueberries itself before the batter and it turned out really good!

Was okay, but it is definitely NOT a crisp. It's more like a cakey cobbler. If I had read the reviews first, I would never have made it.

as other reviewers did, i used 1/2 c sugar in both places where it calls for 3/4, but i tire of cinnamon and like nutmeg so stuck with that. i would not be afraid to add more berries, either, next time. i used them from frozen, and it took about 70 minutes total, and i used 1/2 c of boiling water as well.

I read the reviews before making and decided to go with the sugar amount listed, glad I did.  The topping left alot to be desired.  I agree with other raters that it was extremely gooey and just about tastless.  Will never make again.  Guests were polite but didn't eat it!

If you add the amount of hot water and topping sugar called for, the result is a wonderful moist filling with a sugar-crisp crust (like those high-priced store-bought cinammon/sugar bagels from you-know-where).  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and about 1/2 tsp.  Only change I'll make next time is to add more fruit.  Yum!
