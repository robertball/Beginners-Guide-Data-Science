These are awesome. The orange flavor is not too intense, and the biscotti are not too sweet. I used chopped almonds instead of pistachios, and I increased the amount of nuts because I had no cranberries, and they came out great. I also dipped  a few of them into melted chocolate, and the contrast of orange with semi-sweet chocolate was delicious. Thanks, Libia, for an easy, fabulous recipe that I'll make often.

Love it!  Directions are wonderful. I am working on 4th batch!  Revised review: Refrigerate dough several hours. Divide dough, use plenty of flour on counter when halving the dough and rolling with hands.  Extra flour is ok on the dough. Roll dough the length of cookie pan (Make two) and separate them at least by 3 inches on the cookie sheet. Let rolled cold dough sit on cookie sheet for at least 30 minutes before baking.  You can use the same cookie sheet for additional cooking.  I cooled Biscotti at least 8-10 minutes before slicing or turning the Biscotti over.  I used a long knife to slice the cooked Biscott and to slice the underneath of Biscotti to unstick from pan.  On the last 10 minute cook, I shut off the oven and left Biscotti in oven for about one hour to  finish cooking & cooling. Then remove Biscotti on cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, then slide Biscotti to cooling rack.  Pistachios,  I found in produce section (I am thinking it is a seasonal item). Remember to cut back the salt to 1/4 teaspoon in the recipe if using salted pistachios.    I used 1 cup Pistachios & 1 cup CranBerries-Dried.  One package 12oz Dried Cranberries makes 3 batches. Orange Zest=One orange.  Orange Extract found with the Vanilla Extract. The Biscotti was REALLY GOOD with chocolate drizzled on it!!!   Not too sweet and it is crispy...better than store bought!  Use leftover crumbs on top of icecream! This Biscotti is the Best!!!

Thank you Libia for a great, great Biscotti Recipe. I have not made any in
over 60 years, when my Mother and I made

Absolutely perfect in every way possible. Flavor is fantastic. I zested two large oranges for maximum fresh flavor (2 Tb is a LOT of zest!) I didn't have any dried cranberries, so I subbed chopped raisins, which I soaked in 2 Tb of rum for 20 minutes - spectacular!! I upped the oven temperature to 375 for the final, drying bake of the cut biscotti. Baked for 7 minutes per side, and they came out with a lovely, golden color and the perfect crunch - not hard, but completely crisped through-and-through. Finished with some melted white chocolate, and they could not have been prettier. In the future, I intend to try them with toasted, chopped pecans instead of pistachios, which I don't normally keep around. I had about 2/3 cup coincidentally, left over from another recipe, that I found this week when I was cleaning out my cupboard, and looked for a recipe to use them - this one popped up, and I'm ecstatic it did. They're way too good to make only during the holidays! A+

These are delicious!  They are very festive and look beautiful wrapped (2 cookies per bag) in clear bags tied with a ribbon for small gifts for people at the office or neighbors.  You can also drizzle them with white or dark chocolate (after they are cut).  Gorgeous and scrumptious!

I made this recipe exactly as written and I love it.  The combination of pistachio’s, cranberries and orange not only tastes insanely good but it’s beautiful too.  The texture was spot on for me, not the rock hard stuff you buy.  This makes a great holiday gift but I’ll be enjoying it year round with hot tea.

This is the first time I've ever made biscotti and they are so good!  I also used almonds instead of pistachios, and then dipped half in white chocolate and half in chocolate when done.  So good!

This is really good biscotti - The only change I made was that I added 1/4 cup of dried apricots (snipped into small pieces) to the recipe.

No suggestions, but I will follow those left by others. I ended up using pumpkin seeds since there were no pistachios, + the seeds were the only green thing I could find in the bulk aisle! My boy is a big biscotti fan, + he thoroughly enjoyed these. I think I found my Christmas baking pool submission! For a 1st timer, this was a great recipe to follow + learn from. Cheers...

Delicious. I substituted cranberries with dried cherries. Even my daughter who does not eat dried fruit loved these. I kept finding her sneaking them. Did have to do lots of tweeking to the baking to get it right though.

I made this for my family as little gifts this Christmas and it was a huge hit. Softer and more flavorful than store-bought biscotti, which I find hard. The cranberries and pistachios and orange flavors are perfect together. Easy, easy, easy to make!

Taste is excellent. However, I think 350 degrees is too hot to bake the biscotti. The loaves turn out okay but still too cake-like in the middle to stand up to being cut. Then, if you put the slices in a 350 degree over for even a few minutes they get too dark. I will skip this recipe next time and go with one that calls for a cooler oven.
