I made this for a celebration at work and it turned out really well.  I inadvertently made the following changes I used 1lb mild country sausage and a whole loaf of bread (helps to check the recipe and not do it from memory).  

At first I didn't think there was enough liquid but it turned out ok.  I liked the amount of sausage I used, think it would have been too much bread for my taste with out it.  It was a good casserole but really basic.  I wouldn't describe it as festive at all.   I think that next time I'll add pepper jack cheese and a mixture of bacon and sausage.

I made this for breakfast this morning, along with buttermilk pancakes and bacon. The boys really liked this--no leftovers. Very VERY simple.

This was easy to make and my family really enjoyed it. I substituted Bacon for the Suasage and Salsa for the Picante Sauce.

Great taste and easy since you can make the night before. There was none left. I did add 1 lb of meat and made it spicy with pepper jack cheese.  I will make it again.

This is a keeper - especially since I can make it the day before!   I made this healthier by using Jimmy Dean's low fat breakfast sausage, 2% milk, and our favorite "white wheat" sandwich bread.  Also found a cheese mixture called "Fiesta Blend" at our local Kroger which had a nice mix of cheese and spices (incl jalapeno).  I did add a little crushed red but might omit that next time as it may have been too much with the spices in the cheese blend.    Everyone raved, and my guy is not crazy about "quiche-like" casseroles but he sure liked this!  Served it with low-fat sourcream, chopped green onions, and extra salsa on the side for those who wanted extras.

YUM!!!  I also added crushed red pepper and sprinkled shredded pepper jack on the top to make it a little spicy.  It was a huge hit!

This was good -even my husband who doesn't like strata liked it. I used turkey sausage & lowfat cheese. I ended up using 4 cups of bread - 6 would have made I too dry. Also added a little lowfat sour cream that I wanted to use up.

Delicious!  I made it for some company, and everyone loved it.  My husband wants me to make it again soon.
