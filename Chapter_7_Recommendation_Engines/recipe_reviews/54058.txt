This was really good.  I did not use a bread machine but used all the same ingredients called for.  I first dissolved my yeast in warm coffee.  I then added my brown sugar and let it set a few minutes to get frothy.  Next, I added the salt, molasses and oil.  I stirred this well and then added in the cocoa powder.  One cup at a time, I added the whole wheat flour, rye flour, and 1 cup bread flour.  I then kneaded in the last cup just until the bread was smooth and elastic(it did not take the full last cup).  This has a great texture and  was super easy to make.  It made two medium sized loaves.

Amazing bread.  It has a good rich flavor, a wonderful chewy texture, a looked great.  It is what I had hoped it would be. This is a keeper recipe. 

I do not use a bread machine, but use a kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook.  I did not have any oil but olive on hand, so I used 1/4 c of butter.  I heated all the liquid ingredients including the butter to 140 degrees(my house is cold right now, including the metal mixing bowl).  I put one package of the rapid rise yeast in with the brown sugar, king arthur's w.w. flour, rye flour, salt, mixed it up with the dough hook, and then poured in the liquid.  Mixed it well and grdually added the remaining bread flour. I kneaded the dough with the mixer.  I let the dough rest while I cleaned up maybe ten minutes.  I then pulled the dough off the dough hook and shaped it into a ball, put it in a greased aluminum pie pan and let it rise to double in bulk.  I brushed it with egg and put the oatmeal on top.  Baked it for 35 minutes.  It was wonderful.

This is a very flavorful black bread and well-worth making again and again.  I do recommend increasing the brown sugar from 2 Tbsps to 4 Tbsps - it does not seem to add sweetness to the bread, but it does increase the fullness of flavor.

This has become a go to recipe for black bread and bread bowls.  I use 1 1/2 T Cocoa powder and regular strength coffee.  One batch make 4 small bread bowls which are great for chowders.  These are also good for hot dips.  Thanks for a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe.  It was so easy, my whole family loved it.  You should probably be aware of whether or not you like this kind of dark bread before you try to make it however.  That way you could avoid feeding picky children something they would say tastes like dogfood.  My husband gave it five stars as well, and it was the first recipe of many that I have tried from this site that I have bothered to review.  Thanks again for the recipe.

Made a very good bread, although not *exactly* like my favorite steak house. I am giving it four stars only because by following the recipe as written, the dough came out of my bread machine very sticky and I had to knead in another 1/2 C of flour by hand to make it workable. I think this affected the flavor and texture of the bread somewhat. I plan to make another batch very soon and I think I will just let it bake in the bread machine (as it doesn't care whether or not the dough's sticky. ;) Perhaps without so much extra flour and handling, the flavor/texture will be closer to what I was hoping for. All in all a great recipe, though, thanks very much for posting it.

Very close to the steak house bread. I made my coffee a little too strong but otherwise it was good. The dough was very sticky as others had mentioned. I used the kitchenaid mixer but once I rolled it out with some flour the stickiness disscipated. I made one large loaf and it was very good warm with some butter.

Pretty good.  Not the best rye bread I've ever baked, but still good.  I did mix mine in my Kitchenaid.  I didn't have the problem of a sticky dough like some others did and I didn’t add any extra flour.  I let it rise, shaped it and put in the refrigerator so I could bake it in the morning.  I did give it an egg wash and a sprinkling of oatmeal before I baked it. It came out looking beautiful.  The flavor is more of a wheat/rye combination and a dense loaf.  Great toasted and would be great used in a tuna melt.  It's not a loaf that I would use for Reuben’s.

To Misscarolb who rated this a 1 star, you must have done something really wrong and that is unfair to rate. When making bread, if you are not used to making bread regular, you don't have the touch. Bread baking is an art and if you don't have it, it will not turn out. This is a nice black bread recipe and really pretty healthy for you. I use olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and it is not bad bread at all. Any time you use wheat/rye flour instead of white, you are choosing a healthier bread which is so much better for you. I hope you will try this recipe if you like black bread. It is so good with a nice steak and a little red wine.  Enjoy.

OMG!!  These were AMAZING!  I type with sticky fingers after polishing off a roll topped with honey butter=)  Hubby made this recipe and made rolls instead of loaves.  No bread machine..just mixed with dough hooks, proofed to double, punched down and made into rolls, proofed again and baked!  Keeping this one!

Oh my! These were insanely good!!! I thought that these would be heavy, but no! They were not as dense as we thought that they would be, they were light and the flavor was incredible! Thanks for the great recipe!!! :) :) :) :) UPDATE: I made a double batch of this today, and sprinkled caraway seeds on the top, yummy! I think that I will bake them inside next time, because I love caraway!

I wanted to make my own bread bowl to serve bread dip at a party, I tried another recipe a while ago and it failed. This one came out perfectly! I let it rise and baked it in the smaller of my two springform pans and it looks just like the ones my grocery is selling in their bakery for $5 a loaf!

i had high hopes for this recipe & it just turned out ok...based upon other reviews, i halved the molasses to 1/8c & substituted the other 1/8c with honey, & i made sure not to make the coffee too strong. i followed the recipe as written otherwise, & made it in my bread maker with none of the stickiness issues that others had noted. i think i'll try the recipe again, but will add another 2tbsp of brown sugar like others have advised to help the flavor.

I cut this recipe in half, only because I didn't need a monster loaf. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make this bread. I had everything but rye flour, I used a mixture of wheat flour and bread flour to make up the difference. I proofed the yeast with the warm coffee, sugar and molasses for 10 minutes, then added all the dry. I kneaded the dough with my hook for five minutes, than set it to rise for an hour in a covered greased bowl. After it doubled, I formed it and set it to rise in my loaf pan for another hour or until it doubled again. This was done at about a half hour at 350*. The whole house smells homey and wonderful. I couldn't wait to dig into it. Very tasty bread. Chewy and dense. Really a snap to make. I liked the other steakhouse bread from this site a little better, not by much. I think the molasses combined with the coffee and cocoa was a little too deep for me. I like the use of honey a little more.

These were perfect!!! Can't wait to make them again!!! After reading the reviews, I was a little afraid of them being bitter so I used 3 tbsp molasses and 1 tbsp honey. I added an extra tbsp of light brown sugar and used regular strength coffee. They were wonderful!! I served them with some cinnamon honey butter but they didn't even need it. I let them rise in a cool place so that they had more time to develop more flavor. Next time I'll make the coffee a little stronger but that's the only thing I'll do different. These were awesome and definitely a crowd pleaser.

This was very good. Don't have a bread machine so I used the kitchen aid following standard bread making directions. This made 4 mini loaves. The only things I would do differently next time is add a touch more brown sugar to give it that Outback Steakhouse flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

YUM!!!!  I did the whole thing in the bread maker (probably won't do that again as it was pushing the top open!).  You have to use really GOOD coffee in this though because that flavor really comes through.  I thought it had the perfect amount of sweetness as well.  It's a moist bread, perfect with a slathering of butter.  :-)

Excellent flavor. We made the rolls and they turned out perfect. The amount of liquid formed a perfect ball in our bread machine. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I liked the ease of being able to place everything in my bread machine.  I didn't have any whole wheat flour or bread flour.  Instead I used 2 1/2 cups of all purpose and 1 1/2 cups of rye flour.  These had fabulous flavor and I wouldn't change a thing next time!

Yum!  Made these into 30 dinner size rolls.  I followed exactly and added 3 tbsp. vital wheat gluten.  They were fluffy and delicious!  Will make again.

I thought these were pretty good, my husband (who loves molasses) loved them.  I proofed the yeast in the warm coffe with sugar, and kneaded all of the ingredients together.  Put in greased bowl, and let double (2 hrs).  Shape into loaves/rolls and let double.  Bake accordingly.  Next time, I would cut the molasses in half, just for personal preference.  I also think that making them into small loaves (like at a restaurant) as opposed to rolls is a better approach, as they aren't so huge and dense.

I thought these were just a tad bit too salty, but otherwise they were fantastic!  They had a delicious dense, nutty flavor and each roll was scrumptiously heavy and chewy.  I loved these rolls a lot, and will definitely make them again.  Perhaps jack up the sugar a bit and lower the salt next time?  I don't know, but they were great.

This is it! The recipe I have wanted for many years. My only tweak was to add a teaspoon of Caraway Seed. Love it!

Loved this bread. I used the K.A. to make it as I no longer have a bread maker. I dissolved the yeast in the coffee with the brown sugar, let it foam and added it to the other ingredients in the bowl. I let the machine knead the dough for ten minutes once it had formed a ball and had pulled away for the sides and bottom of the bowl. I then removed the dough, added olive to the bowl and placed the dough back. I let it rise until double in size, punched it down and formed two round loafs. Once it had doubled I brushed with egg, sprinkled with oatmeal and baked it for 25 minutes. Perfection. I loved the flavour and texture. Thank you for a great recipe Maggie McGuire. It's a keeper.

This recipe is easy and makes excellent sandwich rolls.  The only thing I changed was that I added 2 teaspoons of caraway seed.  Plan on making this to have some corned beef sandwiches for St. Patrick's Day!

I'm VERY new at attempting to make bread/rolls, etc.  Basically anything with yeast!  I was pleased with how these turned out.  My husband loves them, but, bread is his favorite food of all time.  I made exactly as written and put the dough in muffin tins to rise.  I ended up with 18 big rolls.  I thought the coffee was detectable in this (I'm not a coffee drinker) but the unsweetened cocoa was not.  Since my DH enjoyed them so much I'm sure I will be making these again.  Thanks MAGGIE for sharing.

I don't think this tasted exactly like the steakhouse bread that I'm familiar with but it is close.  I think the coffee taste was a bit strong and the bread wasn't sweet enough.  DH loved it.  I made 16 rolls instead of bread loaves.  I probably will make this recipe again but tweak it just a bit.

My whole family loved it.  Comment was that it tasted just like the bread at Outback.  I didn't have any rye flour so I used whole wheat in its place.  I formed dough into 8 small loaves; baked on (non-preheated) pizza stone for about 20 minutes.  Perfect.

I just made a loaf of this bread, I cant believe how high this bread rose. I made the dough in my bread machine, when the dough cycle was complete I put it into a greased 9x5 loaf pan and let it rise another 45 minutes then baked it for 40 minutes at 375. I was thrilled when I took it out of the oven to see how high it rose it smells heavenly havent tasted yet it is still cooling, but I know its going to be wonderful. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Just baked this bread.   It's wonderful.  Quite heavy and dense, but still moist.   Did make my bread machine strain a little.   Also in my oven it was done in about 25 minutes.  Will certainly make this again.  Donna from Alpena, MI.

This bread is absolutely AMAZING! Didn't change a thing with the recipe. I did divide into just 4 small loaves, and baked for 25 minutes. They were absolutely fabulous! Tasted very similar to "Black Angus" restaurant bread. It was very moist,great flavor, fresh and SO GOOD! A keeper for sure !

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. This is my favorite bread recipe - I make it at least once a week, sometimes twice. The only thing I've changed is using 3T of brown sugar and reducing the cocoa to 1T. It's my personal preference. I make it as a loaf or as rolls, delicious either way. THANK YOU for this recipe!!!

These are interesting rolls.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it tastes like it suppose to (like black bread).  I'm just not sure it's something that I'm fond of.  My husband liked it quite a bit.  I think my strong Southern coffee might have been a tad too strong because the flavor was a bit too distinguishable.

I USED FOUR TBSP OF BROWN SUGAR AND LET MY BREAD MACHINE MIX IT. I TOOK THE DOUGH OUT BEFORE THE FIRST RISE, REMOVED THE KNEADING PADDLE, PLACED IN A 9X5, COVERED WITH TOWEL, AND LET RISE FOR ONE HOUR AND 30 MINUTES IN A WARM AREA.  BAKED IN OVEN ON 375 FOR 32 MINUTES ON CONVECTION BAKE.  IT WAS DELICIOUS. IT RISES BETTER IF THE COFFEE IS AROUND 110 DEGREES. THA BOMB!!!SLICE WITH BREAD SLICER!!  WHIP HONEY INTO BUTTER AND SPREAD ON HOT BREAD .

Wonderful bread! Didn't change a thing. Cooks up beautifully in my low-end bread machine. Makes a great complement to any great soup.  When I was out of molasses I used pancake syrup, and it turned out just fine.

I LOVE THIS BREAD....I did make some changes though.  I used DARK rye bread flour, very dark honey (instead of the molasses) and boosted the brown sugar to 4 Tablespoons (instead of 2 Tablespoons).  I also used 1/2 butter, 1/2 oil to make up the 1/4 cup.  I used a chocolate coffee that I brewed, which does not overwhelm by any means.  I made one large loaf by using a springform pan which another reviewer had suggested.  This does make a gorgeous looking loaf that way.  I put the springform pan on a cookie sheet, so as not to burn the bottom of the loaf.  I sprayed the loaf with water and sprinkled the oats on top just before putting in oven to bake.  I did let it rise for at least an hour before baking it too.  It baked up perfect in the 35 minutes at 375 degrees.  P.S.  Now I'm having a hard time keeping my husband away from it!!!

I followed the recipe except added 5 tablespoons of brown sugar and honey instead of molasses (didn't have any). This bread is wonderful. Four stars because it took awhile for the loaf to rise.

Great bread.  I increase the brown sugar to suit our taste, and I'm careful not to brew the coffee too strong (it has the potential of overwhelming the overall flavor).  I almost always bake the entire loaf in my breadmaker with wonderful results.

This was very good.  It took a little longer for the loaf to rise than it indicated and we felt the restaurant version was a little sweeter, so next time will increase the brown sugar.  But a very good recipe!

Excellent recipe. I will probably add a little more sweetener next time, as I like it a little sweeter. I pulled the rolls out of the oven and immediately ate 3! The only substitution I made was using strong black tea instead of coffee (coffee gives me an instant migraine so I don't keep any on hand).

Fun to make, spent about $20 on all the flour and it got me to thinking I should just BUY a loaf of it! haha! But I bought all the stuff and made it, and now I'm going to have to KEEP making it to use all the ingredients up, but that's okay. Mine did turn out a bit dense. I'm a beginner bread maker.

If you don't like coffee, don't try this bread!  My household are not coffee drinkers, and none of us can eat this bread!  Truly inedible because of the overpowering coffee taste.  I might try it again and substitute something for the coffee as it has a great texture, just a bad taste!

My first attempt at making bread in my used ($20) bread machine and it came out pretty good.  Not quite the same flavor as the steakhouse bread I was anticipating, but good, nonetheless.  The recipe states to separate into twelves to make rolls and let me tell you they are HUGE!  I think it would be better to make them half that size or 24 rolls.  Next time I will try making some mini loaves.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I'm giving this only a four because I didn't really care for the bread.  However, it isn't the receipe as much as I don't think I care for pumpernickel bread which this reminded me of.  The recipe itself worked well and the bread came out well.

Yum! We didn't think it tasted like the steakhouse bread but it is delicious. We used honey butter spread on it and the sweetness helped bring out the flavors of the coffee and the hint of cocoa. Very yummy! Even my 4 year old and 3 year old boys loved it.

I have to say this turned out better than I thought it would.  I made it by hand (mixer) not bread machine.  Proofed yeast in coffee.  I didn't read the review that said don't make coffee very strong.  Needless to say I did.  I had to add alot  more sugar to the mix to cancel some of the bitter coffee taste.  It didn't rise very high, so I shaped into loaf pan and let rise again and it looked beautiful.  It did turn out pretty well after all was said and done.

This turned out very well.  I had to substitute buckwheat flour for the rye, but, even my picky husband said that it still came out close to what you'd get at a "steakhouse".  I'll be making this again.

It needs a little sweetening, maybe honey instead of brown sugar, but still a good, if different taste.  The loaves didn't shape well and they smelled like really strong coffee, but they tasted better than I thought they would.  Maybe they just need some restaurant style cinnamon butter....I am updating my review: I changed the molasses to a "heavy" maple syrup, cut back to about half the salt, & added (about 3 tsps) caroway seeds and I got a wonderful pumpernickel bread.....perfect amount of sweetness! It cooks best in 2 (small) 5x8 loaf pans

I made this recipe without a bread machine. I proofed my yeast in the warm coffee, so I knew it was good, but then the loaves didn't rise much, so I was worried. They also didn't rise much in the oven, so I thought I was going to end up with bricks. However, after cooling, slicing, and tasting, I am pleased. There is a slight bitter taste (probably from the coffee), but I like it. Here are my changes: honey instead of molasses, because thats what I had. Hazelnut coffee leftover from this morning. Half olive oil, half butter instead of vegetable oil. I also used a little less bread flour, but added some wheat germ and flax seed. Very good, unique recipe. Now I have to figure out what to do with 2 whole loaves of bread... lol

This was good but mine had a slight bitter taste.  Don't know if it was my coffee or if it was the molasses.

This was pretty darn close to the bread I've enjoyed for years at Black Angus restaurants!  I think next time I'll reduce the amount of molasses a little bit, though, because that flavor was a bit strong.  Also, I had to work approximately 1/2 cup more bread flour into the dough so it wasn't sticky, but I know that could have had something to do with the fact that we've had a lot of rain recently, so my flour was probably pretty humid.  Overall a great bread recipe that I will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I guess this just wasn't what I was looking for. Wasn't a REALLY dark bread. I made these as rolls and they were very dense. My daughter loved them though and ate the leftovers over the next few days.

cooked the whole time in my breadmaker and since I am new to bread making I had to guess on the settings. so I thought I would share what worked for me in case others have questions. I set it on rye bread, light loaf, large size. came out tasty. light fluffy in side and slight crunch on the outside.

The texture was wonderful. Taste not so much! It was too bitter. With butter and honey it tasted better. I'm thinking more sugar next time and perhaps less coffee? I used instant coffee because that's all I have.

While the bread tasted great, the recipe didn't say anything about greasing the pan and I forgot!  It kinda fell apart when I tried to get it out of the pan.  Lesson learned and I'll definitely make it again.

This bread is awesome!  The first time, I did not have molassess, so I used Steen's Cane Syrup.  The second time, I used a Sorghum/Cane Syrup blend.  Again, awesome!  I actually have molassess for this next loaf.  We use this bread to make toast, and to make sandwiches.  It is great for both!  The kids love it toasted also, either with butter and jam, or butter only.

Followed recipe as written ingredient wise.  I made a small loaf and 7 nice size buns, it let it rise until doubled.  Needed more time than the oven took.  Didn't find the taste strong nor the bread too dense.
Will make again.

I just made these tonight, and was fairly pleased with the result.  I wasn't prepared for how dry and stiff the dough was going to be (my bread machine creaked and groaned kneading this stuff) but once baked, the rolls were dense, soft, and very tasty.  Had them with a mushroom and barley stew---very good!!  Thanks!

I thought this was ok.  It didn't taste anything like the bread at the steakhouse I was hoping for.  I followed the recipe exactly and the end product had a very strong taste of coffee.  If I were to make this again, I would probably try using half coffee/half water.  My family seemed to enjoy it though.  I made it for Father's Day and they ate all three of the little loaves I made!

Hubs and I really enjoyed this.  Handling this dough was no challenge for us: I did put in a tad extra flour, but probably only by a tablespoon.  Then I simply used oil when handling the dough, and that left it handling very quickly and easily.  To make these more the size of the steakhouse loaves our family has been served in the past, we'll form this into six small loaves next time.  For a sandwich bread, larger loaves could be fine. /// We used instant coffee, but put in a tad extra coffee granules to make it 'strong' as per the recipe - HOWEVER, I would not recommend doing so again.  Also, I personally value the recommendation by another reviewer to add a bit extra sugar to round out the flavors.  We did not do that last time, and perhaps by cutting back that tiny bit on the coffee it would be fine without more sugar, but we'll add a bit extra sugar next time - but that can be a matter of preference.  ---  Lovely loaf, though.  Thanks so much!

Really good as is, though I can really taste the coffee. I recommend not telling everyone what is in it- it is better if you can't recognize the coffee taste :)  Very nice color, shape, and flavor- and easy to make!

I used instant coffee and I guess what holds true for wine and cooking is true for coffee and baking:if you wouldn't drink it don't use it in recipes.  Next time I'll make sure to make extra coffee in the morning for this bread.  
I don't have a bread machine, just used the KitchenAid.  I used about a cup less of flour.  My kids loved them, husband wouldn't touch "brown" baked goods. Next time I'll make bread bowls instead of having them beside the soup.

made this today to go with dinner and it was wonderful! I served it with honey butter! I did leave out the coffee and use water. I would have liked it a little sweeter, so next time I will add a little more sugar! definite keeper. can't wait to share with the In- Laws

It came out very good. I do think next time i will try honey instead of the molasses. I made the whole thing in my 2 pound bread maker. If you have a smaller bread maker, just make the dough in it because it took all the room in my big machine to bake.

The loaf turned out beautifully.  Would have liked it to be a bit sweeter though.  I can't have coffee so I used double bergamot earl Grey tea.

This bread prompted me to make my first review. We absolutely loved this loaf. My 9 year old son told me it was the best bread that he had ever tasted and kept begging me for more. It was such a full flavoured dense loaf and went so well with our roast beef and gravy dinner. It also made the best sandwiches the following day for lunch with some 6 year Balderson aged white cheddar cheese and fresh vine ripened tomatoes. I followed the recipe exactly and made the whole thing in the bread maker and it turned out perfectly. I am making another loaf in the bread maker as I write this. Thanks so much for such a great recipe for our regular loaf rotation schedule.

Wow, this bread is fantastic. Thank you so much for posting it. I made it sort of spur of the moment for small dinner with myself and 2 co-workers. I was kind of taking a chance, because bread can be tricky sometimes. It turned out beautifully and they went crazy for it and so I sent them home with the 1/2 loaf that was left. It was so easy to make, I can make another tomorrow. Very easy to knead, and just a beautiful, impressive bread.

I've been testing various bread recipes to find the perfect roll to serve at my family's Thanksgiving celebration, and this was clearly a winner! The coffee was a crucial ingredient, I think - the bread ends up with a sour but sweet taste, which is delicious. We had already eaten dinner by the time the bread came out of the oven, but my parents couldn't stop themselves from taking an extra slice after trying it.

This bread was very good.  I didn't use a bread machine, just my KA. I made it yesterday afternoon for supper, but it took longer to rise than I expected, so we had a sample after dinner. I thought that the coffee flavor was a bit too pronounced.  I made strong coffee (6T for 4 cups) just for this recipe, but perhaps if I had used my regular strength (1T per cup) it would have been better. I just toasted a piece for breakfast and put a little butter on it and it was delish! I'll make it again.

In order to bake this bread in my Zo, I reduced the water to 1 cup.  It was still a bit wet.  Although it did not taste like the bread I get at our local Outback Steakhouse, the result was wonderful for the first day, chewy crust, soft crumb.  However, it dried out very quickly.  If I  make this again, I would either make rolls to serve immediately or bake in the oven as per the recipe.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I did make my coffee too strong, so the rolls were a little bitter, but the texture wasn't that great. The rolls were pretty hard and dry. I had pretty high hopes for this recipe, and was disappointed that they didn't turn out. Sorry, I won't be making this again!

I have had the joy of munching Dakota Steakhouse bison bread - this is about as close as possible... addictive! The only changes I made are to eliminate the rye (lighten the extreme denseness) & add a bit of gluten. YUMMM!

Walmart didn't have molasses in stock, (typical!) so I used dark maple syrup instead.  I let it bake in the bread machine and it was great, very dense, chewy and delicious lightly toasted with butter. Yum!

This is my new favorite Chart House bread recipe. I made this in my bread machine on the light setting. It tastes as close to the Chart House bread as I ever had. I did add 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey. Thank you so much for the recipe. My husband gave it 10 stars!

This was fabulous! I cut the recipe in half... but experimenting showed to keep the same amount of yeast. I also go a little heavy on the cocoa...yummy.   I just use the kitchen aid with the dough hook and don't bother with any additional kneading, it works just fine, but takes longer to rise than I thought, probably because my house is always pretty cool.   So delicious, this is by far my favorite recipe.

Tasted very strongly of coffee. I ate it, because I didn't want it to go to waste, but I wouldn't make this recipe again. Never had a brown bread that tasted that way before.

My Gram made bread like this with raisins in it. I didn't use a bread maker and followed another member's instructions for hand made bread. My husband hates bread, but this, I couldn't keep him away. The texture is heavy as they said and what a real treat with home made baked beans. Mmmmmmm, I am definitely going to make this many times.

Very dense bread, but really good! I would make it with a little more sugar next time. I did add the egg wash with the oatmeal to give it that extra look and served with honey butter.

I did not have rye flour so substituted oat flour for it and it worked well. Used for Christmas dinner. I made the 12 rolls as suggested, I will make these again, however, I will make the dough into 18 servings. The rolls were large.

This is a very heavy bread.  It rose well and was fluffy so I was quite surprised by the weight.  It's tasty but one roll is definitely enough!

I made the recipe as directed in a bread machine and finished them as rolls. I was expecting a heavy bread but  the texture was amazing. My dough was easy to handle and not sticky.They have a rich flavor that went along with grilled steak very nicely.  I topped them with an egg wash and oatmeal before I baked them. They turned out very pretty.

switched it up and used half the coffee and made the difference with water.  Instead of using the dough  setting, I used the french, Italian setting and made one loaf  instead of rolls.

Hearty flavorful bread!
Modified the recipe by using 2 cups rye flour  and 2 cups all purpose flour. Also substituted 1 tbsp Truvia for brown sugar. Added 3 scoops unflavored vegan protein powder, which made it necessary to add 1/2 cup plain soda water. After first rise, I kneaded it again and after forming into  2 loaves, rolled them in shredded dried unsweetened coconut and crushed unsalted sunflower seeds. Very happy with the results.

Totally delicious, rich dark flavor that we were hoping for with just a touch of sweet to balance out the rye.  I added about 1/2 tsp of instant espresso powder to a medium roast cup of coffee since I was out of dark roast.  I used a medium rye flour this time but will try a dark rye next time.  My bread comes out of the machine in a large square loaf, so I cut it down the center and run the halves through a deli slicer for consistent sized pieces.  They are perfect for making 1/2 sandwiches.  I'm already getting requests from friends and family to make this again... and SOON!

I love this recipe! I have only changed  a few things and I use an oven with a pizza stone in it. I changed the flour to 1. 1/2 cups rye, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat,  the last cup is usually  all purpose flour.   I use rapid rise yeast, heat the coffee and sugar to 120'. I let that get foamy. It rises faster,and I have better luck with getting a nice crust.

Made verbatim in my Zojirushi with Basic Wheat setting and medium crust (3h 40 m time).  GREAT!!  Just add all liquids first, the dry followed by yeast.  Also used Kosher salt.

I made these for Christmas Day Dinner, and they were delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I made them without a bread machine, just using my KitchenAid mixer, and old fashioned rising and baking.

Really excellent just as written.  I had no whole wheat flour so I used a half cup rye flour and  a half cup bread flour. Turned out really good.  My Grandaughter thought I bought them at the Cheesecake Factory.

This is a great recipe.  I cut it in half and used my bread maker on the oatmeal bread setting.  It is a little chewy, but full of flavor.  I used 2 T of butter and 1/2 t. of vegetable oil.  I also added 2 full T of flour.  As others mentioned it seemed too sticky.

 I followed the recipe exactly. I brushed them with egg wash and sprinkled oatmeal as suggested. I got 9 good size rolls. This will definitely stay in my books.

I pretty much follow the recipe as written, and these rolls turned out picture-perfect, beautiful and delicious all the way through. I used fresh-ground rye and whole wheat. My guest said they were the best rolls he has ever eaten. This recipe is a keeper!

This makes  a beautiful, tall loaf. I let my bread machine mix it, then I shape it, let it rise and bake. Great taste and texture - soft, tender and yummy! Thank you very much for this recipe!


11/27/16
I have made this recipe more than 20 times now and both my husband and I really love it. It is hearty without being heavy. I don't eat store bought bread any more since it doesn't agree with me. I've been looking for a healthy bread recipe that can be made in the bread machine for ease. This recipe is superb! I use King Arthur flour because their protein count is higher. I use their pumpernickle flour which is whole grain rye flour. I use 1-1/3 cup each whole wheat, pumpernickle, and bread flour. I use himalayan pink salt because I've read the minerals in salt make yeast happy. I use a 99% unsweetened coco so I only use 1 tablespoon. I put liquid ingredients in first, then the flours, coco, salt and finally the brown sugar. I put the yeast on top of the sugar because sugar also makes  yeast happy. Thanks again for such a wonderful recipe!

I made two loaves of these using the dough settings on an Oster bread machine and one using a Welbilt.  The bread from the Welbilt came out twice the size of the Oster and with a better texture.  Aside from the machines, the other difference was that the coffee I used in the Welbilt loaf was not room temperature, it was warm.  That loaf came out with a lovely soft and moist  chewy texture.  So if you are coming out with a loaf that's too dense or won't rise, try using a warmer coffee.  This bread was fairly close to what I've had t the restaurants except it wasn't sweet enough.  The next time I make it I will add a bit of honey.   My goal in making the bread was the healthier nature of rye flour versus wheat flour, as opposed to re-creating the bread we get in the bar.  Thus, the next go 'round I will also keep the warm coffee, add some xanthum gum, and try to make it  with only rye and whole wheat.

There's something very wrong with this recipe.  less than 2 cups of liquid and 4+ cups of dry ingredients made for more of a crumble than a dough.

Great recipe!  I've been having problems lately with breads being too dense, but this turned out wonderfully light and flavorful!  I followed the recipe as exact but formed it into 12 rolls.  
These have a distinct taste.  Surprisingly you don't get much of the coffee flavor, but definitely a strong sense of molasses and rye.

This is an outstanding, flavorful, rich, moist bread.  You do not taste distinctly any of the special ingredients (cocoa, coffee, molasses) but together they really give a richness that is unique and delicious.  

I made this by hand vs with a bread machine and will caution--the molasses makes for a sticky bread, and I think I used more than the required amount of bread flour to make it manageable.  But when rose beautifully and baked up very nicely; I made 2 small loaves.

I don't have a breadmaker, so this was made traditionally. I added a total of 5 T brown sugar, and used regular-strength coffee per other reviewers. I also did the egg wash and topped with oatmeal. I made twelve mini loaves. The bread smelled heavenly as it baked and tasted so delicious when it came out. Served with Slow Cooker Pork Roast recipe by LawrenceKansasPerson. Thank you!

Made this without a bread maker but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.   My husband, who was recently away on business and went to what is probably the best known steak house, (the Aussie one), said these rolls tasted just like their's.  I prefer another restaurant's (one well know for their cheesecakes), brown bread, it's a little sweeter.  I think I may just use coffee that is a bit weaker next time and maybe a bit more sugar.

This dough was a dream to work with.  i make two rustic style loaves and baked them on parchment on my pizza stone. i brushed them with egg white and sprinkled one with sesame and poppy seeds and the other with oatmeal. i could smell the cocoa while they were baking. when they came out of the oven i cooled them completely on a cooling rack. i then wrapped them individually in plastic wrap, then in heavy duty tin foil and put them in the freezer. i took one out the next day and had it with our steak dinner. Everyone thought i picked it up from a bakery! This bread is DELICIOUS! will definitely make it again :)

I didn't make this recipe as it's written but I must comment on how much this helped me. I used this recipe as a basis for making a gluten free pumpernickel bread. The proportion of oil, coffee, molasses and cocoa was perfect. I added a tbsp of pickle juice to fake the taste of rye. Thank you for helping me indulge my craving for a pastrami Sammy.

This is a great "supper club" taste I remember from my youth.  I've made it in the machine and without. Made it into rolls, rounds and loaves. Works every way. Very flavorful.

Not the best bread and certainly not like the bread at that steakhouse.  Way too much coffee flavor and really no other flavor.  It could use to be a bit sweeter too.  The color was spot on though.

My son and I have eaten a similar bread shaped into mini-loafs at Outback Steak House, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I didn't have regular whole wheat flour so I substituted white whole wheat flour.  I also didn't have dark molasses so I used honey.  I had some coffee left over from breakfast, but I drink medium strength coffee.  But even with all the changes, the bread was still delicious.  My son doesn't typically like any bread except white, so this bread is definitely worth a try even if you don't typically like a different type of bread!

I cut the recipe in half for 5 individual loaves. I didn't have rye so I used 2 c all purpose flour. I don't have a bread machine so I kneaded and let rise like any other wheat flour loaf The bread is an excellent brown sandwich loaf that cuts clean with few crumbs. I added a dash of caraway seed and cardamom to individual loaves but I would skip the spices for sandwich loaves. I am going to use the full recipe and bake in a pan as an alternate for the daily and weekly sandwich loaf.

I like the bread, but will delete the coffee (replace with water) and add more molasses.

Followed the recipe to the letter. While I wouldn't say it tastes exactly like the Steakhouse bread, it is dense and has a good flavor.

Used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 bread flour. Added VWG and baked in the bread machine on basic light crust. Held together great, tasted okay. Without the rye flour I'll stick with the Steakhouse Wheat Bread recipe.

Will make again but not with coffee, which gives too much bitterness. Will replace with warm milk.

Absolutely perfect.  This made 2 medium sized loaves which I sliced and served with salted (important!) butter.  The bread had the right amount of sweetness and the texture was exactly what I had hoped for.

I made mine into rolls that I subsequently used as hamburger buns. I actually forgot to add the cocoa powder and only realised it after the first rise... :( not sure what difference it would make, but I would definitely make it again WITH the cocoa powder next time. Also, I don't have a bread machine, so, I proofed the yeast in the warm coffee with the brown sugar and added the rest of the ingredients in after that and mixed them all by hand. Love the flavour and soemthing I would make again!

Delish! I used black strap molasses and you can really taste it. Don't use it if you don't like the taste of molasses! Careful, it rises fast!

Absolutely delicious! It tastes just like the bread my husband and I love that used to be served at cattle company steak houses. 

I added a couple tablespoons of flax seeds and a couple tablespoons of steel cut oats (soaked in warm water for a while first) to this recipe then used my bread maker on multi-grain dough setting. Once the dough was ready, I divided it and baked in two regular bread pans. Great for sandwiches and dipping in humus as well as dinner!

I couldn't even finish my first bite and I generally LOVE black bread. I followed the directions to the 'T', I can't figure out what happened. I'll move on to another recipe.

I didn't think the bread was too bad, my son kind of liked it, but my husband took two bites,left the rest and said it was terrible. Since he's always the final judge, I gave it 3 stars. The texture of the bread was great I thought. I did double the recipe for a bigger loaf in my bread maker without a problem (no overflowing). I guess it just had an off taste. I ALWAYS reduce the sugar in all my recipes, but in this recipe I actually think I would increase the sugar. The coffee & chocolate actually left a slightly bitter taste and adding a slight bit more sugar may have helped balance the flavors. If my husband didn't dislike it so much I would probably give it another try with a little tweaking.

I made minor modifications adding 2 Tblsp honey, 3 Tblsp milled flax, and 2 Tblsp vital wheat gluten.  The taste and texture are terrific, the bread stays nice and moist for days, and everyone in our house gave it rave reviews (including the kids).
