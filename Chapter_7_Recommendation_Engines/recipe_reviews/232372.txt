These were so tasty, and I love the texture! They settle my sweet tooth without killing my diet. These are more like muffins than cupcakes, though - beware that the batter is pretty thick. I was afraid they weren't going to turn out right, but 20 minutes in the oven was all they needed. Thanks for the easy recipe! I will be making this often.

Wished I would've read the reviews before I made these because they were so over-baked. Set the timer for 35 minutes ( somewhere in middle of 30-40 minutes as per recipe) but I bet they only needed 20-25 minutes. They are definitely more like muffins than cupcakes and I didn't care for the olive oil taste. Could be because I have very good olive oil and it really came through, but still if I did make them again I would try coconut oil. Coconut and banana is a good combo though!

I thought these were VERY good!  I used coconut oil instead of Olive Oil.  And I added some mini dark chocolate chips.  I just had one without icing...but I will be icing them.  They're not sweet, they are more muffin than cupcake I think...but they're REALLY yummy!  Oh, and I only baked them for 20 minutes...that was plenty of time.

Very delicious. The only thing I am going to do is add a creamy frosting on top.

I made this recipe with coconut oil, baking for 25 minutes and they came out perfect. I even made some with mini cupcake foils and the were still the perfect density. They'll be great for a quick weekday breakfast!

These were delicious and I will be making them again! I did add chopped walnuts and they were gone in a day!
