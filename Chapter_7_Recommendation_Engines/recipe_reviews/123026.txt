I make a slight variation of these from a recipe I found in one of those Pilsburry Bake-Off books. My neighbor came over and tried one and said it was the best thing he'd ever tasted! Freeze the rolos first so they don't melt in the oven. Also, these are best the day of or day after baking..after that the caramel blends with the rest of the cookie and they're not quite as good.

Sort of a crazy measurement "17 tablespoons sugar"! That's 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon. A bit fussy to make, but worth it. We have a nut allergy in the family, so I had to leave out the pecans.

Definately let the dough chill before making into cookies otherwise it can be very sticky. These cookies are time consuming but well worth the effort.

dough has a very nice flavor and agree that it is nice and chocolatey without being sickening sweet.  I did find, however that dough should be chilled a bit before rolling. I prepared these using the Hershey's caramel kisses, and the dark chocolate strawberry kisses.  I stuffed a dozen or so and then decided to just use small size cookie scoop and top with a kiss when they came out of the oven.  Much easier.  When the kisses had a sheen to them and melted slightly on the outside, I dropped a few chopped pecans on top and forewent the adding the sugar to the pecans.  thanks for this recipe that presents well for cookie trays.

These cookies are amazing. I'm a home ec. teacher living in Sweden right now and I made these cookies with my student choice class. The studnets loved them and the teachers we shared them with called them heavenly. I wasn't watching carefully and the students making them used margarine instead of butter and they still worked out. In fact they were amazing so if you don't want the saturated fat, I think it is fine to do it this way:)

Exactly what I was looking for! To me, this is a "grown up" cookie. The dough has a good texture and is not too sweet, and the caramel center is a great surprise. I'm giving these to teachers, bus driver, and friends as a small holiday gift. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be keeping this one for sure.

5 stars for taste and popularity with our family.  However, the white sugar part of the instructions could be clearer for ease of understanding.  I just used 1 C white sugar and then mixed in a bit of sugar with the pecan.  Also I think ground pecans are an easier and better choice and that's what I used.  I also pressed them down slightly with my thumb.  Mine therefore came out like a flat cookie unlike the picture provided.  I used a mini Rolo inside and next time, I'd probably use two.  These were soft and had a great taste.  My oldest daughter raved over them and both sides of our family enjoyed them a lot at Christmas 2009.

I just made these cookies to put on a Christmas tray.  They smelled so good that I had to try one.  They were yummy.  Surprising not too sweet with the extra chocolate in the middle.

Good cookies!  I halved the recipe and it made about 40 cookies.  So that was 4 rolls of Rolos!

My family loves them. I did add instant coffee to make it a more rich flavor. Definately great for people who don't like too sweet cookies. More for adults if you take out the caramel.

These cookies are one of my favs!   Just the perfect amount of chocolate.  A few things I did..........I did not mix in the pecans.  I just put them on top.  I'm not a huge nut fan so just having them on top is the perfect amount.  I also baked them in the large silicon cupcake pans.  When they are done cooling they just pop right out no muss no fuss!  All and all love it!

I tried this cookie recipe after seeing it in Taste of Home or Quick Cooking.  It was good.  I shared with all my neighbors and they really liked it a lot too.

These are a really good option for Chocolate, Caramel and Pecans.  My husband really liked them but I didn't find them to be tasty enough to get five stars.
