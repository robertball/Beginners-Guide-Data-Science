Tasted delicious (I did forget to add the cinnamon and saffron until it was already eaten up, but I think it would taste great either way)! I used 1 lb of boneless cubed goat meat and made this in an electric pressure cooker - first cooking the meat, spices, onions, and tomato for about 15 minutes, then adding the remaining ingredients and pressure cooking for an additional 8 minutes.  I wanted to stretch this recipe for my family, so I added frozen peas and 2 cubed medium potatoes with the squash during the 2nd time in the pressure cooker.  Served over rice with a dollop of sour cream on top.

I used goat in chunks with bones instead of a whole shank, simmered 1hr30min. It was delicious! Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy to make.  Great recipe, was my first time cooking with a lot of these spices but was very happy I did.   You can definitely add  chili flakes or similar to give it a little more kick.
