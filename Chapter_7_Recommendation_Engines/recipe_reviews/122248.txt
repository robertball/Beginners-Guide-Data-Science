After making this several times, I've made a few simple changes that made a big difference!  Add chopped onions & bell peppers (about 1/2 cup each) to beef when browning it.  Also, for those who don't like the way the chips get soggy on the bottom, you can omit adding them first, and instead add 1 cup cooked rice.  Then, just add about 2 cups chips (or enough to completely cover the top) during last 5 minutes.  Serve with sour cream, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and refried beans for a complete "Mexican restaurant" style meal!

This was so easy and so good! I didn't have enough salsa so I threw in a can of diced tomatoes and it was just great! I will make this again!

A hit with our family.  I made a box of "spanish rice" prepared with the 16 oz. of salsa on the bottom for a more Mexican flavor.

"As good as the restaurant (we just ate at)," claimed the fam. We like spice, so I added a few chilis in adobo sauce to salsa. As a previous reviewer suggested, I eliminated the chips on the bottom (figured they'd just be soggy) & instead put a can of pinto beans on bottom. I added chili powder to sauce & corn  to meat after browning.  I topped with sliced jalepeno's & black olives. As recipe suggests, I put LOTS of chips on the top & they added a wonderful crunch & flavor. Great recipe Kim (even though I chg'd a bit, it's terrific & so easy). A KEEPER!

This was perfect.  I needed to use up some ground beef in the fridge and was not in the mood for heavy duty cooking.

I had 2 pounds of ground beef but only one can of soup, so I added a little chicken broth and some extra shredded cheese to the ground beef to keep it from being dry.  I also added some chili/taco spices to the ground beef as it was cooking (chili powder, garlic, steak seasoning), which I believe added a lot to the flavor.  And finally, I didn't have a good sized pan, so I split it in to two loaf pans.  This worked out great, as one pan fed five people small-to-medium servings.

This is a little heavy for most every day cooking for us, but was very tasty and definitely goes in the keeper file!

GREAT Recipe!  I went with a couple suggestions, but overall changed little.  I added taco seasoning and chopped onions to the beef as I cooked it, a layer of chopped onions between the beef and cheese, and substituted a can of rotell for the salsa just for personal taste.  As crazy as it sounds, the cream of chicken soup works great.  i do suggest the chips at the bottom.  Crumble them and it makes a nice bottom to your casserole.  This will be a keeper!

This was really good, but I have to admit I modified it because of the ingredients I had on hand.  I mixed some taco seasoning in with ground beef and soup, added some black beans on top of meat mixture, used Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa.  It is really tasty, thanks for the great base recipe.

Very good. I alsso was a little leary on th cream of chicken soup, but it turned out really good. Kids don't think they like salso, so I had to mix i tin with the soup and meat, still turned out great. Extremely simple to make, will make this one again. Would have been 5 stars, but my one son just picked at it.

Super good! I used mushroom soup and a packet of taco seasoning, and a little bit of water for sauce. Also added some Rotel for warmth. Delish!

Added a packet of low-sodium taco seasoning mixture. Would definitely recommend throwing in some onions too. Obviously this is nothing fancy, but it made for a quick, easy and pretty decent Saturday night snacky meal.

Made the Mexican Rice II on this site (which was fantastic and easy) then put some on the bottom as another reviewer suggested.  Otherwise, made like the recipe and everyone loved it.  Simply good!

Excellent!  I used "hint of lime" tortilla chips and added the leftover (half a jar) bean and cheese dip to the hamburger mix. As I said before - excellent!

This was really good. I added taco seasoning to beef. Only put chips on top. Put a layer of beans on top of beef. Instead of salsa I chopped up couple tomatoes and few little sweet peppers. Very yummy

I mixed a taco seasoning packet in with ground beef and used cream of mushroom soup. I also added a layer of spanish rice in between the bottom tortilla layer and ground beef. I think I should have added the salsa on top of the rice, but i put it as directed on top of the beef. I used 1/2 cup quesadilla cheese and 1 cup mild cheddar. This  was delicious, but it was missing something. Next time I may add a layer of frozen corn or kidney beans. Delicious and versatile. I recommend :)

I wasn't all that impressed with the recipe.  I took reviewers' recommendations to put a layer of Mexican rice on the bottom and top that with beans.  I won't be making this again. :(

I loved this! I went back for 3rds, but unfortunately my husband only ate one plate. His comment was "It tasted too mexican". But he is more of a steak and potato guy. I love mexican and loved this dish.

This is a family favorite. I have also brought it to our church potluck. We have a member who is gluten intolerant so I substituted the cream of chicken soup with a can of refried beans. It was a hit.

I made this with just a couple of changes. First I spread a can of refried beans on the bottom of the pan and sprinkled some of the chips on top of them, then layered the meat mixture that I had cooked some onions and taco seasoning into. Instead of salsa I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Then put on the cheese, and added the remaining chips at the end as instructed. My husband ate it up so it's a keeper.

Tried this last night we really enjoyed it.  Grandma can't tolerate green bell pepper so I used a large anaiheim instead of the bell and jalapeno.  This even made the marginal tasting tortillo chips I bought taste good.  Next time I'm gonna try using mesa herina for the chips

I made this as much as I could as stated.  I used 1 pound of ground turkey (all I had it on hand).  I got concerned about lack of flavor/spice and added chili powder to the meat.  Because I used less meat, I did add the chips to the bottom.  They do get soggy but absorbed some of the excess liquid from the lack of meat.  I thought the cream of chicken soup sounded strange but it tasted fine.  The final product tasted great but did not look that great - a soupy casserole look and because the cream of chicken soup, the meat did not look like ground beef or taco meat. Still it tasted great.

Really good right after you cook it but not so good as left overs.  Manybe if you reheat it in the oven it's better, other wise the chips get soggy.

I have made this and if I drained the grease off the beef (93% lean) it helped so the chips weren't so soggy. I first found this recipe in about 2007 in a Taste of HOmes mag. by the same person.  Although on the online web page the recipe does not have many reviews compared to this one. :) I have made this as is and felt it needed onions added to the meat, and sometimes I also add diced green chills. Just to change it up a little.

This was easy, tasty but too salty for my taste.  Definitely a 5 star recipe if the salt can be reduced.  I think it was the chips that made it so salty.

Not a favorite! I saved this years ago and made it tonight using several suggestions. Just okay. I’ve been making various nachos for Taco Tuesday for many months and thought this would be a nice change. My family was sorely disappointed and asked me to get back on the program.
