This was delicious.  I skipped the thyme and added some pine nuts I had on hand.  This recipe would be great as is.  But it's also extremely forgiving.  So if you've got extra vegetables you need to use up, just toss them in.

It was not good. I had added pork, to make it more of a meal, and that was the only substitution I made,  but we ended the night unsatisfied with this meal.  I really don't get why it's rated so highly.  And I can cook, so it's not operator error!

Excellent dish.  I'll make this again for sure but I may make the asparagus on the side or cook it until softer - I found the crunch of the asparagus took away from the squash.  Loved the goat cheese with this!  I roasted the squash yesterday and just wrapped it and kept in the fridge.  I don't think roasting the squash added much to the dish - to save time, a person could steam it in the microwave, cut-side down in a bit of water in a baking dish.

Delicious and filling!  Husband and I agreed this needs more goat cheese next time.  Served as an entree but would also make an excellent side.

I was looking for something different to do with spaghetti squash, and I'm so glad I tried this!  The texture difference the asparagus adds was very nice.  However, the flavor was absolutely amazing fo rbeing so simple!  I followed this recipe exactly as written.  The goat cheese added a nice touch!

Great! Easy to prepare. Simple ingredients making complex flavors. Didn't have goat cheese, used feta and Parmesan instead. Didn't have broth, used a little water. Would make again.

Quick, easy and healthy.  You can really add in anything you'd like.  Next time, I'm going to toss in some sun-dried tomatoes for added color and taste, and chicken for more protein.

Super idea! :-)  I of course was missing a few ingredients...asparagus (went on without it!), & veg stock (used chicken stock) and only had dried herbs, but still was great.  I am new to goat cheese...and was a bit sceptical...having it only on crackers till now...but sooooo good and creamy.  My man LOVED IT! :-)   Super easy too! Thanks! :-)

So good and easy! I used a shallot instead of the onion and skipped the thyme, also added walnuts. This will be in regular rotation!

This dish was a hit with everyone in my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  The goat cheese was what made it over the top for us.  I will make this again and will double it so there is a chance for some leftovers.

I used a regular white onion and feta cheese instead of goat cheese. We thought it was good, but wasn't very filling. Will probably try it again, but maybe add mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. Hadn't tried spaghetti squash before, so that was interesting too.

The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 was it was very healthy.I don't add salt because of my blood pressure perhaps salt would have woken up some of the flavor.I had some mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes which I added.I had fresh roasted beets and garlic bread,I feel this was a complete meal without meat.

Delicious! The goat cheese melts right in to the squash, giving it a great flavor. A good way to get someone to try goat cheese who may be reluctant!

I was very sloppy with the measurements and this still turned out delicious!  Like others, I used feta just because I had it on hand.  Next time I think I'll try adding mushrooms.

This was a great recipe! Left out the goat cheese only because I didn't have any. Still had a great taste. Added in some sliced turkey sausage for my meat lovers and made a great one dish meal!

It came out really delicious, I used half a shallot seasoned with unsalted butter and olive oil, the flavor that the seasoned shallot gave its amazing.

I thought this was just alright. I felt that it needed additional flavor- in the form of herbs, more vegetables or sausage. I did like the flavors together!

This was pretty delicious for a side dish. I paired it with baked chicken tenders.  I've used minced onion instead of dicing it, and Low-sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. The recipes from the magazine differs than it does here on the site since it has no asparagus mentioned.  Somehow this recipe is an alteration from the site.

4 stars only because I did change this a bit for the ingredients I had on hand.  Subbed zucchini for asparagus, and subbed ricotta for the goat cheese.  I'm sure the goat cheese would have been wonderful; I may try that next time.  I also added a small handful of leftover baked salmon I needed to use up, and left out the thyme (personal preference).  Lastly, I gilded the lily, so to speak, and sprinkled buttered panko crumbs with parm on top for a final broil to brown.  I really liked it, but spouse-person said just so-so.  I wanted to try another spaghetti squash recipe, not sure if this one's it.  Nevertheless, thank you for posting!

I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I used thin asparagus and veggie broth, then topped it with roasted pine nuts. Easy prep for a lovely side dish. Thank you

loved it.

I'm on a low sodium diet, so used  Imagine® Organic Low Sodium Vegetable Broth.  Very good. 

Added some mushrooms and used more goat cheese, the second time around.  Liked better.

Later tried sauteed spinach in place of asparagus.  Also very good.

This was great. I used butter instead of olive oil, since its more appropriate for heating at higher temps. I would absolutely make this again. I also used a lemon thyme flavored chevrie, which added just a little extra zest.

If you like goat cheese you might be a fan of this recipe.  It really isn't very pretty to present.  I followed the recipe very close only adding some sliced mushrooms because I had to use them up.  I thought the goat cheese flavor took over the dish.  I also find it frustrating when the directions say a bunch of asparagus or 1/4 onion.  How much is that?  Would rather see actual measurements instead.  I won't make again.

I will make it again.  I bought a can of store brand chopped asparagus that wasn't the best idea, I won't do it that way again.  Other than that I really liked the outcome.

I was really excited to try this recipe, but it was a total letdown.  The goat cheese gave the dish a much needed kick, but overall, this meal was bland and unsatisfying.

I have to say It wasn't great but only because the thyme overwhelmed the dish.  I agree with previous reviewer that the asparagus was a little too crunchy for the spaghetti squash. I think I may cook it again with mushrooms instead of asparagus.
