I loved these. The 4 star rating is only due to the rest of the family's votes, and let's face it, I don't cook for just myself. These directions are spot on. This recipe doesn't taste as good without all the ingredients, so if you have spice weenies or small children (like I do) at your house, you might have to make your own batch. I will also add that milk really does compliment this dish well. I really enjoyed the combination. It's like a fireworks show in your mouth. But don't worry. It's a small tykes firework show. We aren't talking atomic bomb over here. One slight change I'd make for next time, mainly to take advantage of the cheese coverage, is to make the cauliflower pieces smaller. They really need to be bite sized, no larger than a half dollar size. This will help ensure the cheese, sriracha and onions don't slide off and that you can get all the flavors incorporated into one bite. Great job, Brian!

The mascot for Sriracha has come up with a great snack for my milk. Actually, I had this for breakfast and loved it. The method is right on, at 30 minutes I could smell the roasted aroma coming from the oven. The cauliflower was browned perfectly, remaining tender enough to cut with a fork but not mushy. I didn't have garlic powder so I used fresh garlic and I had to improvise on the cheese. Thank you for the recipe.

I also cooked the stalks and leaves, which were tender and crispy! This recipe gets 10 stars. So so so good! I will be making again.

Seriously addictive! I made this in my Panasonic countertop induction oven, like in the Allrecipes video (combo 2 / 18 minutes / added cheese and 1-1/2 minutes more). It turned out fantastic! I could have eaten the entire plate, but I decided that my family needed to sample these little gems as well. It goes great with a nice glass of cold milk, that's for sure. Thank you bd.weld for this awesome recipe. I know I'll be making it often.

I used 1/2 head of cauliflower, scaling down to 2 servings. Cooking time was spot on. I had half of this as dinner tonight. Very good and something different with cauliflower, which was I was looking for. I'm not sure about the milk though; maybe another time. This time, I had it with white wine, and that was a good match, too!

This is a great low carb recipe that can be used as a side or add a Mexican seasoned ground beef or shredded pork to serve as nachos with your favorite toppings. I will definitely make it again.

I made it as written except I didn't have shiracha sauce and I also used fresh garlic for the garlic powder. It was unspeakably wonderful. Even the reheated leftovers were wonderful. I will be making it again and again. It would even be wonderful without the cheese or if you reduced the amount of cheese.

I make this all the time, but not as a snack, no milk.  Serving it tonight as a side for grilled teriyaki chicken.  Good with or without cheese.  Add the spices that you like.

This simple recipe turned out perfect. My only changes were to add in some seasoned salt, black pepper, paprika, and siracha to the cauliflower before baking. Served with a sour cream ranch sauce and had no leftovers!

Loved this.  Easy too.  I sprinkled cheese on half.  Both halves were great!  Even the kids liked it.  Of course, it had cheese on it so not too surprising.

Amazing! Great side dish/appetizer. Even my cauliflower dislikers enjoyed this one. I only put sriracha on about half. Cause of us wimpy people :)

What a great treatment of cauliflower!  Yummy little spicy bites, perfect with a glass of milk for a snack, or as a side for dinner.  As a matter of fact, DH says he could "make a meal out of this cauliflower"!  Add as much or as little sriracha as your taste buds will allow.  My only change was to roast the cauliflower on a half sheet pan with parchment paper.  I think these will grace our table, again.  Thanks for the idea, Brian!

Great recipe Brian.  We loved it. I had some very good white cheddar on hand so I used that but will make it again with a regular cheddar so the color of the cheese stands out more. Delicious way to kick up cauliflower! Great with a ice cold glass of milk, too.
