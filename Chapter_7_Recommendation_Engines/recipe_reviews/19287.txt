Absolutely delicious.  My family is not a big CHOCOLATE family, so these cookies were a great replacement!!  Everyone loved them.  I did not have self rising flour, so I added 1 3/4 teaspoons of baking soda to all purpose flour, and it wirked well.

Delicious! The coconut was a great touch. I also halved the amount of chips, and I'm glad I did.  I'll be making these again!

I made up and posted this this recipe when I was about 12. (Can you tell I was a chubby 12 year old?) I did not have a good grasp of the fundamentals of baking and was just playing around. I definitely agree now that the amount of butter/shortening is WAY too much and the white chocolate chips should probably be cut in half or at least reduced somewhat. I'm now 25 and would make many changes to this recipe before trying it again. I just wanted to warn those reading it that this recipe was made up by a child and not a expert baker and you might want to make significant changes before trying it. I'm glad some people liked it as is. I still very much like the basic idea of the cookie having white chips, macadamia nuts, and coconut, but you will probably want to play with the amounts of butter and shortening or add more flour and another egg or something to make it better.

I did not particularly like these blondies. I followed the directions but they still did not turn out well.  They were a little bit thin, and had way too much butter/shortening.  The white chocolate chips were overpowering and there were too many macadamia nuts.

I never add coconut but have made this recipes many many times. When ever I make just a single batch the cookies come out flat and not to appealing, so I double the recipe everytime and do the trial and error method by adding little bits of flour at a time.(the double batch gets gobbled up quick enough)
Lots of macadamia nuts  = awesome cookies!
Best cookies I have ever made and my family agrees!

I thought this was a great recipe and so did my family.  I left out the coconut though, because no one likes it, and they turned out good anyways.

Easy to make.  Make sure if you use regular flour that you add baking powder.  Also, would probably cut back on the white chocolate chips, but that's a personal preference.

This recipe was too sweet.  Felt like I was eating pure, rich sugar.  Too many ingredients made the cookie too thick, should half the chocolate chips.

Thanks for the recipe and additional comments,  Joy.  I made with pecans and added a few chocooate chips.  They came out great.
