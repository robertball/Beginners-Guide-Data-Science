A bit  challenging.  I'm an experienced cook, and I still struggled with this one.  I love, love bearnaise sauce, and wanted to try it from scratch for a change for Easter dinner. Takes a long time to prep, which I knew going in.  But here's where I flubbed up; I have a god-awful electric stovetop, so I struggle sometimes with cooking techniques that are very temperature sensitive.  I was skeptical about putting my stainless steel mixing bowl on an electric burner, so I decided to use a double boiler.  All was well until the "stir for 8-10 minutes" part near the end.  It took only 30 seconds for the sauce to thicken and I wasn't prepared.   When the sauce was finished, it was beautiful and velvety for a minute.  However, it was much too vinegary for me and had gotten too thick,  and I decided that I needed to "water it down" a little, which I did by adding more butter.   The taste was fabulous, texture was great, and I thought I had won, but after sitting on the stovetop for two minutes, it separated and curdled.   I could not rescue it.  So, my advice to you is...if you don't have a really good grasp on emulsification, don't try to veer from Chef John's directions at all. My fault entirely, but hopefully I'll spare someone else the disappointment.

I made this on Christmas Day to go with our meat and asparagus. It was a total hit. We didn't change anything!

I didnt have any capers but that was the only change I made. My husband was in heaven with this sauce over his steak. Absolutely delicious. Thank-you.

So flavourful! Although I followed the recipe to the letter my sauce broke (did not combine). But No worries. I just stirred in a tblsp of cream. All was fine!
