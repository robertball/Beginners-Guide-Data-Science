So good!  I added an additional Tablespoon of  12-year aged Balsamic Vinegar I purchased in Italy last year!  Also added 15 minutes more in my oven, to crisp it up a bit more. Yum!! :-)

Loved it, but needed more balsamic vinegar for my taste - I put in at least 3 tablespoons, probably more - added til the taste was good to me.
