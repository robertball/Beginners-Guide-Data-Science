Spaghetti squash "pie" really satisfies the desire for a casserole without the carbs of noodles found in most old-style casseroles.  I made this recipe for dinner, and I wanted to make it more of a Tex-Mex flavor, so I used 2 cans original Ro-Tel, and 1 and 1/2 tsp ground cumin, in lieu of the basil and oregano.  This had a good flavor, but I think both cans of Ro-Tel should be drained, as I had some liquid in the bottom of the finished dish.

The sauce is delicious! I modified it a bit - using a big jar of diced tomatoes and a small can of diced chiles. I also used half a pound of ground elk and that was plenty. ****ALSO**** the squash should be cut width wise!! Not lengthwise - you’re cutting every strand in half so you don’t get the nice long spaghetti-like strands. Width wise is easier than cutting it along the length. I’ve seen so many recipes like this. Anyway, the sauce is great and would be delicious on regular pasta too.

Well sort of made it. No tomatoes, no peppers, just spaghetti squash, onions, spinach, cheese, eggs, sour cream, and cooked ground beef and turkey mix.
Turned out great and tasted fantastic!!!

I cook ground turkey 2 pounds at a time and freeze the extra one so I cut down on time. I baked the squash the night before also. Instead of the plain diced tomatoes I used fresh from our garden. I also used a whole green pepper.

I modified using chicken tenders and roasted red peppers instead of turkey and diced tomatoes and tomato paste because it's what I had on hand and it turned out very well! I also served it with a gluten free dinner roll and garlic roasted green beans. YUM!!!
