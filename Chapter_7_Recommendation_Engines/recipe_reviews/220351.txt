I just followed this recipe, and used freshly squeezed orange juice. It was DELICIOUS! The orange added a to-die for zing, much better than just garlic and butter. I may try adding garlic next time, but I'm a garlic fiend. Well done!

This was the best lobster I have ever made.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of finely chopped shallot and a minced clove of garlic to the butter before adding the OJ.  Garnished with fresh parsley.

Very yum.  I sauteed a little garlic in the butter for a few minutes.  After the lobster was finished I cooked pasta in the leftover sauce.  Added a glass of the wine I used in the sauce and some crusty bread and had an absolutely delightful meal. Thanks for the recipe.

made this for Valentine's Day. took the whole 15 min. the lobster itself didn't absorb much of the flavor, but we kept it on the stove after we pulled out the lobsters and it made for a great dipping sauce.

Do you have to cut the tops of the lobster like you do when they are broiled or grilled?

This is an outstanding basic recipe.  To the reviewer who asked if the tails needed to be cut, I'd say "Yes." I cut the soft abdominal shell away and I thought that they absorbed more flavor that way and were much easier to eat.  Secondly, I followed other reviewers' suggestions about adding garlic.  And because I can't help but tweak a recipe to my own taste, I also added 1 tsp. Sriracha sauce.    Finally, I steamed them, covered for 10 minutes; removed the pan from the heat and let them steep for another 5 minutes.  They emerged very tender and flavorful.  My husband raved about them.

This was really great. So often lobster cooking methods result in tough lobster. This was tender and succulent. To the sauce, I had added two chopped garlic cloves and a spring of parsley. As another reviewer suggested, I boiled down the cooking liquid and it was a nice dipping sauce.

This was so good! I made it without the wine and it was so good! I can only imagine how good it would have been with the wine.

This is a great special occasion recipe!  I added minced garlic and equal parts OJ and wine (Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio).  Also threw in peeled shrimp last few minutes.  After I removed all from pan, turned to high and reduced by half. It was the BEST dipping sauce ever!

Perfect recipe for New Year's Day Brunch!  The orange lobster soup, I cooled it, scraped the butter off the top, used it to fry some shrimp, then reduced the liquid, added some sugars continued to reduce, added a Tbsp corn starch to thicken the reduction, then tossed the shrimp in it.  I used the orange lobster broth to cook some rice.  I added a pinch of sea salt to both.  Sailor Approved!

Well, I must say that I used previously cooked lobster, so getting the timing just right to warm up but not over cook the lobster didn't fair well. I did add garlic to the recipe which helped. The better half liked it, but the lobster meat was just too tough (my fault). Even with that, while the sauce was good, it just didn't infuse into the lobster.

I used only 4T of butter and added chopped garlic and parsley, too. After removing the tails, I threw cooked angel hair pasta into the liquid, because it was such a good sauce. Because this yields too much liquid for just 2 tails, I suggest that you save the broth for future use as a fish stock!

Everybody raved! I replaced the wine with broth. Cooked them for 10-11 minutes. My husband said it was better than the lobster he ate at a business dinner last week.

I can't believe it.  It st is so easy and delicious.  I would not recommend using unsalted butter.  You need the salt in the butter.  It was fantastic.  I didn't even use fresh squeezed OJ.  I tried it with straight OJ from the container and also Tampico (a Sunny-D) type thing and both were fantastic.

Cooked way too long.  Lobsters ended up tough.  Next time would take out after maybe ten minutes; definitely not fifteen.

I added green onion and garlic to my butter then I doubled the butter, wine and oj to have more dipping sauce.  I had 3 tails, 5 shrimp and 5 large scallops all put in at the same time then covered and simmered it for about 35 minutes and it was perfect!  I will make this over and over again.

I followed the reviewers suggestions and sauteed a large clove of garlic in the butter prior to adding juice and wine. Likewise, I followed the suggestion to reduce the cooking liquid by half to use as a sauce. Freaking AMAZING. This is something you'd see in a Michelin restaurant.
