I had never made Sloppy Joe other than the can before I tried this recipe and I can honestly say I will never use the can sauce again! This was delicious and a huge hit with my kids!

Excellent recipe.  Tasted much better than the canned version.  Cut the recipe in half for a smaller family and it worked just fine.  Just spicy and sweet enough for our family.

This was a quick and good recipe for yummy Sloppy Joe's. I found it to be a little on the sweet side, so next time I would cut the ketchup and add more tomato paste and cut the brown sugar. I used ground turkey and added zucchini, summer squash and some raw pumpkin.  It was a huge hit!  We even had my daughter's friend over, he loved it and told his mom to get my "secret" recipe for her to make at his house.  So generally a winner.  I used whole wheat onion rolls too.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I was afraid that it would be bland, but made it anyway based off of reviews.  I'm glad I did.  It was slightly sweet, but tangy as well.  I added about five or six drops of hot sauce to give it a little kick.  Everyone loved it at my house.

LOVE this recipe.  I used 2 lbs beef and added a little extra onion and peppers (I also added celery).  there was plenty of sauce to spare, so next time I will load it up even more with veggies.  very tasty!   

One tip to make this recipe more lean is to rinse the beef off with water  in a colander (after browning).

My fiance and my mom wanted some sloppy joes today, so I made this recipe because of the reviews. They loved it! I personally hate all sloppy joes, so my opinion doesn't count. I reduced the sugar, omitted the oil, and only made 1/3 of the recipe.

This was delicious! I actually hate sloppy joes, but my hubby loves them so I wanted to do something special for him. I switched the recipe to 6 servings since I didn't need that much of it. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use peppers since I didn't have them and I only used 1/4 cup of ketchup (that's all I had left) and the other 1 cup came from a can of  tomato sauce I had in the pantry. It was so good that even I liked it!

This is delicious, and we especially like it served in bread bowls. A little sweeter than usual, but that can easily be remedied with less or no brown sugar.

This is by far the best sloppy joe recipe I have had. It is so flavorful. My husband and I made a massive batch of it for an event at his work and we had no leftovers, people were going back for more. It is an easy recipe and needs no modifications.

My first time making sloppy joes and I will keep this as my go-to recipe. I subbed ground beef for the sirloin and only had apple cidar vinegar so I used that instead of regular vinegar. Very good!

I made a batch for our office staff today and they devoured it! Delicious! First time I've used red bell peppers instead of green in a sloppy joe recipe. It added a little more sweetness which I liked.

Excellent recipe.  Just the right mix of tangy and sweet - I prefer the ones like this that have a bit of vinegar.

Very good recipe - we'll be using this from now on. I usually buy BBQ sauce for my Sloppy Joes, but I had already browned the beef when I realized that we were out. I left out all the veggies, and just used this for the 'sauce' portion of the recipe. I used the called for amount of prepared mustard instead of dry, and it worked out fine. I don't think I'll be buying BBQ sauce for Joes again! Cut the recipes to 4 servings, and I mixed everything for the sauce in a bowl and then pour it over the browned meat.

Very Good. I left out the brown sugar to save on calories and carbs and it was still delicious! I have added it to my recipe box.

Very good. I followed this recipes exactly (except I did not add the water- I don't like runny sloppy joes).  I  served it at a get together I had at my house last night and I received a lot of compliments.  I will keep this recipe! Thanks!

These were very,very good.....made 1 1/2 times the recipe and got rave reviews. Handed out the recipe to more than one person. I followed the directions to a T with no variations. Will definitely keep this recipe and remake again and again.

I have made the recipe more times than I can count. When I met my boyfriend, he claimed his brother in laws mother made the best sloppy Joes he'd ever had. Having to find a rival recipe,  I found this one and needless to say he now thinks I make the best sloppy joes. I've made it for kids as young as 5 and everyone loves it! I never have powdered mustard and have always used brown spicy mustard as a substitute, a little more than called for and a little extra brown sugar. I pour the water a little at a time until it reaches a desired consistency, it only thickens a very little bit as it cooks. Best sloppy joes ever!

I only gave this a star because the program makes you click at least 1. Followed the recipe to the letter, I always do the first time around. This was the worst sloppy joe recipe we have ever had, I am sure it is because of the huge amount of dry mustard. I kept looking thinking I had read it wrong, but no 2 Tablespoons! Yikes. I made the others taste it, and got the same reaction. My hubby quickly said to dump it and he drove me to the store and bought more ingredients for good old canned version. Will not make again.

I am so happy that I was able to find this recipe.  I loved making sloppy joes when I was younger and then I lost the recipe.   Then after that, all the recipes that I would come across would used prepared mustard, which made the joes taste kinda funky.  The only thing I did differently was use ground turkey breast instead of beef.

I was used to the canned mix only...thought I'd try a recipe from this site.....I'm really glad I did...this was a huge hit the first time I made it, and have been requested to make it numerous times since, and have handed out the recipe on more than one occasion.

This was very good.  I made a vegan version using LifeLife ground "beef" crumbles.  It lacked a little something for me so I added some Rooster sauce and A-1 sauce and that brought it altogether.  Also, added a finely diced jalapeno to the peppers.

Very good.  A little tangy without tasting like BBQ sauce.  Someone posted that this recipe tasted like mustard, so not true. The only thing can can think is they used prepared mustard instead of ground (dry) mustard.

Very yummy and easy! I used turkey burger instead of ground beef and added a few dashes of hot sauce. I also cut the recipe down to about 4-6 servings. The entire family loved it. I will be making this again for sure!

I used a can of tomato soup instead of the tomato paste.  I also added celery.  I don't really know how much this changed the integrity of the recipe.  I guess I have always been very leery of tomato paste and avoid it when possible.  I suppose I will have to try getting over my tomato paste fear at some point.  Perhaps that would have pushed this recipe over the top but from my past experiences, that's difficult to fathom.

This is absolutely delicious. No need to buy the expensive Manwich. This is so much more economical and the flavor is outstanding. Love the tang the ketchup and vinegar give it and the brown sugar balances the tanginess beautifully. Just wish I could find the Sister Schubert yeast rolls.

I did not have dry mustard so I left it out. Substituted a mixture of 99% lean ground turkey and deer for the ground sirloin. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was a hit!

I cut this in half and it still made enough for 4. Loved the flavor. I added the water a little at a time until I got the desired consistency. Served on big onion rolls with broccoli slaw and baked sweet potato fries.

Great recipe. My husband is not a sloppy joe fan and said they were fantastic. I backed the off on the water and increased the brown sugar, tomato paste and used a can of tomato sauce because I only had 1 C ketchup.

This was absolutely delicious as is! It was even better the next day, surprisingly, because I'm not a big fan of next day meats. But the flavors really melded overnight and were even better. I couldn't believe it. Thanks so much!

Great taste. I had to omit the Worcertershire sauce because I didn't have any, so I added a bit more vinegar. I also used turkey instead of beef.

I use this recipe as a base for my sloppy joes.  It's VERY good and easy to customize depending on what you have on hand.   I  add minced veggies.  Onion, bell peppers, carrots, celery, and mushrooms so it's pretty healthy and it stretches out expensive protein.  It's also very good with ground turkey!  I've also substituted bbq sauce in place of tomato paste and regular yellow mustard for dry mustard  and so on..

really good!!!  I didn't have dried mustard, so used prepared.  The only thing that I would do next time is use at least 2/3 less water.  I also like it tangy so maybe a little more mustard and vinegar.

Delicious! I wanted to make sloppy joes but I didn't have our favorite jarred variety sauce in the pantry, so I gave this a try. My husband likes it sweet so I added a litle more brown sugar, other than that I followed it to the letter (reduced to 4 servings). Will print for my recipe box for sure!

Would be better if it included more peppers and spices.  It's too simple and you'd be better of just buying a can of sloppy joe mix.  I added in some Blue Moon beer for extra flavor but it didn't help.  Too plain.
