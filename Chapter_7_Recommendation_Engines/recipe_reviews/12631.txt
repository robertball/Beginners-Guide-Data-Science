Probably the easiest pie you will ever make.  My family finished it in one sitting.  The topping was so different, I think that's why everyone enjoyed it so much.

I like the concept behind this recipe, saving fat by leaving off the top crust was enticing.  However, the marshmallows baked up and then shrunk into little marshmallow pieces quickly- they weren't nice and fluffy. It didn't look pretty enough to serve.  It tasted good...but too sweet for me!

Mine came out very watery and the apples did not soften well, even after baking for twice as long as the recipe stated.  I added cinnamon to the apples and still found the pie almost flavorless.  It sounds like a great idea, but I will continue looking.

I had a ton of apples from my sisiter's tree and I didn't know what to do with them. 
I had printed this recipe monthes before so I decided to give it a try. I regret not
making it sooner. It was out of this world! It was so easy to make, I made 
three pies and took them to work. They were gone in five minutes and everybody 
wanted the recipe. Deb, thank you for sharing your Grandmother's recipe with
us!

This came out a little runny. I used a Pampered Chef deep dish pie plate. The pie was quite tart, but very good, especially served warm with vanilla ice cream. I will make it again but probably add a little cinnamon.

This was soooo tasty and easy to make. I love premade pie shells!! The marshmallow and the apples really go nice together.

This was very yummy. We couldn't wait for it to set up, so even with juice running everywhere it was still delish.

It was so easy to make which was my favorite part.  It's not the best apple pie I ever ate, but it was pretty good considering how easy it was.  My pie crust was pretty shallow so I only used five apples, and it did turn out very runny.  I think I would make it again; it's a good way to eat your apples!
