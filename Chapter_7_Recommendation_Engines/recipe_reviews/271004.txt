I made these cookies today. I followed the recipe to the tee, except I used only 1 1/2 cups of dark chocolate Easter M&Ms (10 oz bag). I used my KitchenAid mixer for this recipe. Two  cups of M&Ms is too much for my taste. Also, once you get to adding the M&Ms, make sure to mix them in manually with spoon or soft silicone spatula, because the KitchenAid mixer will break apart the M&Ms. Trust me you don’t want them to break apart, it will ruin the recipe and make a chocolate mess.PS, I also didn’t wait in our to let them sit in the refrigerator for an hour. They still turned out fine.
