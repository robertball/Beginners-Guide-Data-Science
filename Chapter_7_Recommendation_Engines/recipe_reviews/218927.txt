Just made these and they came out really good. You definitely will need more flour as the dough was sticky at first. Our cutouts kept their shape well and these tasted a little better than plain old sugar cookies. Plan to make them again!

Not enough flour! I got cookie blobs - not nice cookies like in the picture. Good taste, but add 3c of flour instead of 2 1/3c to make it work.

I tried this recipe because it's like a cross between gingerbread cookies and sugar cookies. We frosted them with a vanilla buttercream frosting, we really liked the flavor and texture of these cookies. The only thing that I was disapointed with was that the cookies didn't keep their shape while baking so we ended up with a bunch of mishaped Christmas cookies that looked nothing like what they were suppose to be, but they still tasted good.

Agree--need more flour! One batch came out all blobby, like our cookie men ate way too many cookies!

I made these over the weekend, as is.  I didn't change anything and I thought they turned out great!  Cooking time for my oven was at 350 for 9 minutes.  You don't want them too brown, they'll taste burnt.  My family enjoyed them!

Surprisingly bland given the spices, with a dry texture. I can't imagine what they would taste like with more flour.

Turns into cookie blobs. Can't taste the spice very much. Just a blah, flat cookie.

I followed the directions exactly and I added all the required spices, but they still tasted like dry toast.  I wouldn't roll them out to the stated 1/8 inch.  I will go back to sugar cookies.

We made these before Christmas and my first 2 pans came out as blobs. Definitely needed more flour. After adding some, the rest came out better. Next time I will roll them a little thicker, and bake until just done (don't leave them in any longer than you need to). I might add a tad more spice, but I like the 'hint' of spice. It wasn't overpowering.
