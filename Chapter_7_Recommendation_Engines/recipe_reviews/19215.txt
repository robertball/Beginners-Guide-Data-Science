Great Italian Christmas cookie.  For those of you who make it and don't know what to expect...these are not intended to have a flavor explosion; they are about the texture and mild sweetness.  Some people add the almond extract for more flavor, I like them the way they were intended to be made...without extract.  An added tip...use a small cookie scoop so they stay round and symmetrical.  You can also add another teaspoon of vanilla for a little more sweetness.  Lastly, the lemon icing isn't quite right for this cookie...just use a powdered sugar/milk icing, and it adds even more sweetness to the taste of the cookie.

I needed to use up a bunch of ricotta, so I tried this. Light & fluffy, a perfect cookie with tea. After reading reviews I decided to be skimpy on the icing (because of complaints about it being too sweet) and I'm glad I did.  I also decided to use almond extract instead of lemon (just because it's my favorite) and skip the colored sprinkles or colored sugar. My family liked these a lot.  Here's a tip to reduce the mess on the glazing process - a little cheat thing I saw on a tv show:  I put my glaze in a ziploc bag, sliced just a tiny tip of one corner, and then just drizzled the glaze over the cookies while they were still on the cookie sheet to the desired thickness.  No muss, no fuss. And I always bake my cookies on sheets lined with foil so there's also no clean-up.  Just toss the glazey foil away!  I'll make these again at Easter time and do the colored sugar/sprinkles to be festive.  This goes in our permanent recipe file.

These cookies are great - like mini cakes!  My only complaint is the icing, which I think tastes a little "fake" with the lemon extract.  I experimented and found what I think is a better alternative:  instead of milk and lemon extract, substitute the juice of one lemon plus about two tablespoons of water plus 2 cups of powdered sugar(I halved the entire recipe to make a more manageable quantity).

Five stars to the cookie, two to the icing. To the person who asked for a better icing recipe, I have one that I use on ALL cookies. To the 4 cups of conf sugar, add 2 heaping Tbl. of "Just Whites", a powdered egg white that you can find in the baking aisle of your supermarket. Add enough lemon juice (not extract) to make a thick paint-like consistency (not icing thick!) Dip each cookie in the mixture and allow to dry, about 1/2 hour. Icing will harden in a thin glaze. You can also use water or milk instead of lemon juice, as well as food coloring or other flavoring. When decorating sugar cookies that are cut w/cookie cutters, you can apply this icing more precisely with a small paint brush. (If you're going to further decorate with sugar or sprinkles, do it before it dries.) When they harden, you can stack them without the icing smearing all over. Enjoy!!

The raw dough was the best part of the recipe...I couldn't stop snitching spoonfuls with that great ricotta flavor!   I added grated lemon peel to the dough, which enhanced the flavor a lot.  The cookies were a tad less exciting in comparison, but still good.  They formed well with my mini ice cream scoop, and looked perfect when they came out of my oven after exactly 13 minutes.  I think the glaze does taste very powdered-sugary.  I agree that this is a huge batch of cookies and I spent way more time than I wanted to in my kitchen, and after the mess I made on my counter with the glaze, I might hesitate to make these again.  I did enjoy doing something different, departing from the good old chocolate chip cookie recipe, as I needed to use some leftover ricotta.  These are actually really better the next day, I think!

I have made these coolies several times and they  always receive raves. I originally made them with almond extract in place of the lemon and I still prefer them that way. But I made them along with maraschino cherry cookies for a reception so I made them as written with the lemon and everyone loved them. I volunteer weekly at a local hospice, in fact the first time I tried them was there and I made them to use up some leftover ricotta. One of the current residents asked me to make anise flavored cookies and said she likes soft cookies so I made these for her last week using anise extract. Today I had planned to make a Valentine's Day dessert but when I got to the hospice Laura asked me to make these again. Before I left she must have already eaten at least eight of them. So thank you, Lisa, for a great recipe and thank you for adding a little enjoyment to one woman's final days.

Another WINNER!  My kids couldn't stop eating these!  My daughter even did the glaze and sprinkles.  Light, delicate and best with the glaze since the cookie isn't real sweet.

These are good cookies.  The lemon flavor is really good.  The flavor kind of reminds me of Fruit Loops.

Have made these lots. The dough is a bit sticky. Make as symmetrical as you can when dropping, even though they do spread some to a round-ish shape when baking. I use one teaspoon full of batter (spoon, not measuring spoon). I got over 60 normal sized cookies. They seem to take about 10-12 minutes to bake (they should not look "wet" on top and be lightly browned on bottom). Un-iced cookies freeze well in ziploc bags.

Easy & delicious!  Very light & fluffy, great summer cookie.  In extreme heat (it's been in the 90's here this week) they don't hold up too well, my sprinkles melted.  I baked mine 8 minutes and they were very soft (which I love).  But I may do a little longer next time.  A keeper!

I had a cup of ricotta cheese leftover, so I cut this recipe in half.  So glad I did, because I still ended up with 33 cookies.  These are delicious, soft, cake-like cookies.  I love the lemon glaze, but the glaze is the one thing that gave me difficulties in this recipe.  It is like water if made as written.  I ended up adding almost a full additional cup of powdered sugar to get it to the consistency it needed to be.  So now I have a lot of leftover lemon glaze to find another recipe for:)  Other than that, we love these cookies.

These were delicious! I only had about 8 ounces of ricotta so I just made a half recipe and that was more than enough. I used 3/4 cup of sugar to make it a little less sweet (if I made the full recipe I would of used 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups). For the glaze I kind of just made up my own...I whisked together 1 cup of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of half and half, and a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. I didn't top them off with any sprinkles and they still looked great. I liked how these cookies were more like little cakes than cookies and this was a great recipe to use up some leftover ricotta. Thanks for the yummy recipe!!!

These were delicious!  Be careful about storing them together, however.  I made a large amount and stored them in a plastic container until I was ready to ice them.  Although they were firm when I took them out of the oven, they got mushy and stuck together in the container.  They were fine once I separated them and iced them (and then let dry), but you need to be careful not to store them covered together.

Perfect ricotta cookies!  Only changed two things:  added 2 tsp. of lemon extract to the dough (plus the vanilla); and used my own glaze made of key lime juice, powdered sugar, milk and melted butter.  I've been trying to duplicate a lemon cookie served at a high end chain Italian restaurant (Maggiano's) but am done with that since these are much better.

I made these for Christmas, and my family loved the zippy lemony taste.  I wanted them to stand out as the lemon cookie varietal of my spreak, so I added a little more lemon extract to the dough and frosting, which really gave them a punch.  They were very light and fluffy, and had potential for falling apart easily if I wasn't careful when frosting them, but all it all I will definitely make these again.  I think they have great potential to be made with cherry extract as well, and garnished with marachino cherries, which I will probably try in the future too, perhaps for a Valentine's cookie. ;)

It was very easy to follow, directions were clear.

Cookies are incredible!  The only thing I did differently was instead of using VANILLA extract in the cookies, I used LEMON extract.  I'm diabetic so can't have the cookies with the frosting, so I wanted to enjoy the lemony taste.  My hubby had some frosted cookies and he loves them.

Followed the recipe exactly for the cookie and all I could taste is flour. I made a powdered sugar/milk icing with sprinkles and my husband and son liked it. I didn't care for the flour-y taste. When I looked at other recipes, it used the same amount of ingredients but half the flour. This recipe has too much flour in it! If I make again, I'd halve the amount of flour.

Cookies are delicious and so easy to make. I used all butter for the glaze because I had no shortening in the house and used 1% milk. Will definitely be making these again

this was a very nice light cookie. For those looking for a burst of flavors,that is not what this cookie is about. I did change from using lemon extract in icing to almond extract. I also only made half the recipe and still had over 2 dozen cookies.I took it to Boss's day and everyone loved them. And had a few requests for the recipe. I would like to try almond extract in dough next time. will def make for my Christmas trays

I thought these were a pretty good cookie. They are cake like, which I actually prefer. I thought the lemon icing complimented them nicely. I had some ricotta cheese to use up and this recipe came up in the search. I made 12 servings, with the calculate button, and still got 22 cookies using a standard cookie scoop. Anyway, I thought the cookie and lemon icing had a really elegant appearance. The colorful sprinkles, although possibly traditional, seemed out of place. I wish I had something in the house to top them with to show that they were lemon flavored. Possibly a light yellow sugar or a small tad of lemon colored food coloring mixed in the icing. I would have to think about that, if I made them again. The lemon was a nice flavor, for a change, though.

THE Perfect Christmas Cookie Ever!  I followed the recipe except I added 1 tsp. almond extract & 1 tsp. vanilla.  These cookies do not spread so what size you put on the cookies sheet is the exact size you will yield when done baking. They are cake-like and very moist. Received Mmmmms from everyone. I think all almond extract would be great or even anise extract for a very Italian effect.  Maybe lemon for Easter.  I must admit that I was so tired when it came to frosting I just used the sugar, milk & sprinkles and they still turned out wonderful.  Will be making these cookies every Christmas from now on.

A very light and tasty cookie.  We liked everything about this - the taste, the texture and the finished presentation of the cookie.  I baked up half the dough and used the cookies for Girls Night Out.  All of the ladies enjoyed them.  I refrigerated the leftover dough and used it a week and a half later.  The cookies turned out just as well and the ones I baked the day the dough was made.  An easy cookie to change the "sprinkles" according to the holdiay/season.  Thanks Lisa for sharing your recipe.

I had about 8oz of ricotta cheese to use up, so I typed that into the search and came across this recipe. Thought..why not?? I didn't really know what to expect..but these cookies are fantastic. They totally remind me of the sprinkle cookies sold at my local bakery. I also love the lemon glaze! Yum. Oh..and even though I cut the recipe in half, I still ended up with 24 Large Cookies. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have never made these kind of cookies before.  They were super easy and tasty.  I mistakenly added salt to them  and they tasted fine.

This is wonderful, and especially good with colored sprinkles to cheer up what otherwise looks like a boring white cookie.
I didn't have shortening, so I made a super-simple glaze out of confectioners sugar and milk (3 T of milk mixed with about 2 cups of confectioners sugar--I just kept adding until it was thick enough).  I just drizzled the glaze on top and sprinkled it with colored sugar.
At last!  I've found a version of this recipe that doesn't use 4--count em--4 sticks of butter.  My Aunt had clipped the recipe for Frosted Ricotta Balls back in the '70s and that was definitely back in the day when it was okay to use 4 sticks of butter.

One day I looked for a recipe because I had left over ricotta.  I didn't expect much but I tried them.  They are heaven!!!  Most and wonderful.  Everyone that tastes these cookies asks me for the recipe.  They are a real hit with my family.

I mostly followed the recipe, only using 1 1/2 cups of sugar and replacing 1 tsp of vanilla with lemon extract.  I over baked the last tray by 5 minutes and I actually liked those better although I liked the others too.  They are just as good unfrosted. Thanks!

I have been making a recipe like this for a few years now.  The only thing I do different is I add lemon zest to the batter.  It gives the cookie a little extra kick.

Very soft and moist cookies, but they didn't have a lot of flavor. I liked them, but they could have used some more flavoring.

Wow, these cookies are delicious!  Very soft and moist, with a mild, sweet flavor and just a hint of lemon from the glaze.  I followed the cookie recipe to the letter, but used a different glaze.  I mixed 2 cups powdered sugar with 3 tbsp lemon juice and 2 tbsp water.  I just drizzled the glaze over the cookies, and they turned out fantastic.  My kids, husband, and guests loved them too.  I'll be making them again for Easter, and will add the sprinkles for a bit of a festive touch.

i so enjoyed these cookies! they are very much a typical italian cookie, not a lot of flavor but more about the texture.  they have a cakey texture that i loooove in a cookie.  i underbaked mine (took them out after 7 mins) and kept them in the fridge after i glazed them.  they were so moist and delicious, it was almost like eating cookie dough (which for me is a good thing!!) i did not have lemon extract so i subbed 3T of lemon juice in the glaze.  i don't know how much of a difference that made but they were very good nonetheless.  thank you and yum!!

Fabu! Having never made Ricotta cookies I gave these a try and I am so glad I did.  The kids LOVED them and they were quite tasty.  Opted for the lemon extract in the cookie and lemon in the icing-a bit to much lemon and the icing is VERY sweet.  The kids dipped theirs in the icing but I found them much too sweet-and I have  BIG sweet tooth!  As the previous review stated, I drizzled the icing and that was plenty.

I had been searching for this recipe for years. My grandmother made these type of cookies but took the recipe with her when she died. This is the closest I have found to the taste of her cookies. I made these and everyone loved them. I didn't alter the recipe much except I didn't have lemon extract so I used almond extract instead.

Wowwww. W.O.W. This recipe is just delicious! I used 2 tsp of butter rather than using shortening and about 3-3.5 cups of confectioners sugar for the frosting. Otherwise, I followed exactly. It's 11am at the office and half the batch is already gone! Thank you!

These are easy and delicious - used lemon zest and juice in icing. My container of ricotta was only 300 g so had to modify quantities. Turned out great.

Wonderful little cookies! I used my own lemon icing for these, but followed this cookie recipe exactly except that they baked for 13 mins, and they turned out wonderful! It made 120 small cookies, so make sure you have some time!

I give this recipe five stars but have a couple changes.  I do not use baking powder and 3 eggs, not just 2.  A little extra ricotta helps keep them more moist.  I started making these a few years ago and they have become a holiday tradition!  Everyone loves them and throws a fit if I don't make them.  We prefer just regular frosting (a tub of Betty Crocker vanilla, food colored for the holidays works great)!

The cookies are great without the frosting.  They are a little sweet so I can't imagine with the frosting too.  This batch can easily make a few dozens.  Will make again:)

These cookies are fantastic!  I made a half batch and got 31 medium sized cookies.  Like others, I used butter only in the glaze and part skim ricotta (what I had).  I sprinkled the colored sugar on the cookies instead of dipping.  With frosting, the cookies that were more crisp were better and the ones just barely done were better without.  Will definitely make again and again.

These are a lovely, delicate cookie with a delicious, buttery flavor and texture.  I sprinkled some sliced almonds on the last batch for a more "grown-up" version.  They toasted perfectly and made the cookie all the more delicate in form and taste.  But my little boys loved teh candy sprinkles.  Oh, and if you don't have shortening, all butter in the icing works fine.

Wow, the lemon icing made a difference! These cookies are a keeper.  Had 6oz of ricotta to use up so I changed the serving to 18. I also used Cathy's lemon icing which is not really a big difference to this one but it was just my current favorite right now.

I just made these cookies on Friday and they turned out well; soft and moist.  I used the vanilla extract and then added lemon peel and fresh lemon juice.  For the frosting I used a little butter, lemon peel, lemon juice and powdered sugar......it packs a heck of a lemon taste!  My 3 years old liked them and so did the girlfriend that I made them for.

I've been making this exact recipe for years, it was given to my mother by a lady that she worked with in the early 90's.  I make this recipe 2 times a year, Christmas and Easter and have people anxiously await for me to bring them into work and to parties.  They are super soft, more of an adult cookie - they are not too sweet.  I do not make the heated icing or put lemon in my icing, I make mine with sifted powdered sugar, a drop of vanilla and 1/2 & 1/2 or heavy cream in my stand mixer.  Multi colored nonparelis are a must!

I was looking for a cookie recipe that wasn't exceptionally sweet, and oddly enough, I had some ricotta I needed to use. This was the perfect answer to that. These cookies are good for a quick fix without being overly sugary. I wasn't super happy with the frosting, I found it too sugary, too much of a contrast to the cookie. A friend suggested trying a cream cheese icing, and that seems like a good idea so I'll try that next time.

These are so good and so easy.  We've been baking them at our annual cookie baking party for the past 3 years and they're always a hit.

These cookies are the BEST!! They taste like light cakes.  I froze a few to see how they hold up, the taste and texture was perfect after defrosting.  I used a teaspoon, so  got much more than it states.  Good thing, they didn't last.  Much better than any Italian bakery in Brooklyn.
The only thing I did different was the icing.  I used confectioner's sugar, lemon juice and water to a frosting consistancy.  Perfect.  Thanks alot.

These cookies surprised me-when they first came out of the over, they needed more cooking time, so I gave them an additional 3 minutes. At first, they weren't too impressive to the family members who tried them hot from the oven, (plain).  By the time, they had sit 4 hours, the taste had greatly improved. I don't know if lemon flovoring has that much stronger of taste over lemon zest, but I had to substitute lemon zest in the dough and icing.  In the end, they are a five star cookie with the  substitution and a keeper recipe.  Thanks!

In my family we call these Viscoot and they are made at every bridal shower, every wedding, baby shower and holiday. These are an Italian tradition for us. I just frost mine with canned vanilla frosting and use food coloring to dye it to the appropriate theme. They are wonderful to eat, like little mini cakes. Everyone should try these at least once....you'll come back for more. This recipe is the best of all the ricotta cookies on this site! Great job Lisa!

These cookies are good.  I added lemon rind to the cookie dough to give them more lemon flavor.  They taste just like from an italian bakery.  Thanks for the recipe.

Amazingly soft cookies.  I substituted almond extract for the lemon extract, as that was all I had in the pantry, and it worked out great!

These were outstanding, very moist and cake-like. I added a little grated lemon peel to the frosting to give it a more intense lemon flavor and everyone raved about them.

My neighbor, a 10 year old girl, sent over a tray of these cookies to us this morning. It was a rainy day here.  What a perfect day to bake.  My family thought they were delicious.  I never saw them eat so many cookies so fast.  Of course, I helped them eat them too.  My neighbor dusted the cookies with powder sugar. They were so tasty.  I am looking forward to making them soon.  Perhaps tomorrow!  I just love this website.

This an excellent, light tasting, fluffy, easy to make recipe.   I found the flavor and texture of the cookies awesome and the flavor of the frosting perfect.  I followed the directions as written, with the exception that I used parchment paper instead of a greased sheet.   My bake time was at least a couple of minutes more than the recipe called for, but that may have been because of the parchment paper.   I tested doneness just as you would a cake, inserting a toothpick and checking to see if it came out clean.   This worked.   The dipping in the frosting and sprinkles got to be a little messy, so on the second batch I spooned on the frosting and sprinkles.   I liked this better, but I need to remember to keep the frosting warm so the sprinkles stick (ooops).   When I go to the big box store, I sometimes tend to over purchase some things that aren't great at my store, like ricotta cheese.   Because of this, I don't always get it used up before it expires.   With this recipe, that will no longer be a problem.

Nice, cake-like cookie. I made a half batch (got exactly 2 dz) because I needed to use up some ricotta. Also added ~1/2 tsp salt and combined the dry ingredients before adding. They didn't seem done, so I left them in the oven 11 min but should have taken out sooner. After they sit they are fine. Went with the almond flavoring in both batter and glaze and it was very good. I can see this also working 
with lemon extract, or maybe even anise flavoring for a more Italian flair. Will keep these in mind for Easter. Lisa, thanks for the great recipe!

10 min baking wasn't long enough, I live in N Africa and my oven usually cooks twice as fast as my oven back in the USA, I cooked these cookies for 10 minutes and they were still gooey inside.  After I frosted them I decided to take a risk and put them back in the oven for a few additional minutes, glad I did...

Fantastic!
Followed recipe as is and they are light and fluffy and wonderful. Will put a little less sugar in next time though.
Didn't get around to even putting the icing on. Great flavour on their own!

Great light, texture--and with the glaze (I just used fresh squeezed lemon juice with powdered sugar) they are so delicious!  Very tangy matched against sweet. Yum yum!  Careful you will eat too many.

I was surprised by how soft and cake-like these were!  My husband and I love them!  The only changes I made were to the icing: I used 2 tsp butter rather than a tsp each butter and shortening, and I sub'd almond extract for the lemon out of personal preference.

I love these homemade ricotta cookies! They are very cakey, yet crumbly and buttery. To highlight the lemon flavor in the glaze, you might want to add the zest of half a lemon! It freshens the cookie without a severe lemony flavor.

no, no 4 cups of flour is all wrong; just wasted some good butter and ricotta plus a great deal of time. Cut the flour to 21/2 cups, or you will have the worst tasting cookies---all flour and the texture was just awful!

These are so fluffy and soft!  They have a slightly cake-like texture and are delicately sweet and creamy.  Delicious!  I used the sugar cookie glaze recipe found here on Allrecipes.com and drizzled it over the top.  Perfect!  I chose not to add sprinkles because I thought it would be too crunchy for the delicate cookie.  They are easy drop cookies to make, too.  My family was crazy about them, will definitely be making them again.

Never heard of this cookie but decided to try it with some ricotta I needed to finish. I followed this recipe to a tee (though without the icing) and they're OK. Good flavor, but kind of boring - and not because they're not very sweet. I wasn't expecting the cake-y texture. They do not spread out in the oven and remind me of biscuits. I suppose I should have read more than the reviews from the main page. The recipe certainly does make a lot of cookies tho - using a rounded tablespoon I made 60 cookies. I'm not sure if we'll be able to finish them all. Maybe the icing makes the cookie. Or maybe this is just not my kind of cookie. I will not make them again.

The cookies came out perfectly, and were enjoyed plain with lime curd.

These are BETTER as they age! Instead of getting stale and hard, they are soft. The cookie isn't very sweet as is but frosted they are perfect. Skipped the lemon and added vanilla. Made them for  a party but they were gone before that, everyone loves them. A definite keeper recipe!

The texture of these cookies are perfect! I didn't find them to be overly sweet at all. The cookie alone had a nice light buttery flavor with a cake like texture. I had to use lemon juice for the glaze but I loved the concept of flavors...ugh i wish i'd had lemon extract to give mine more of that lemon punch...then the sprinkles gave em a nice crunch of sweetness! I will def make these again for my son's birthday party.

These cookies were very good......a great way to use up the ricotta cheese I had sitting in my fridge!  The texture was more of a cakey texture than the normal chewy cookie texture.  There's not a whole lot of actual flavor in the cookie, but they are very very easy to just pop "one more" in your mouth;)

This recipe is great. I'm currently living in France and didn't feel like searching for ricotta cheese, so I substituted fromage blanc and it worked great. Added the zest of a lemon to the cookie dough and just used lemon juice/confectioner's sugar for the frosting - my friends absolutely DEVOURED them.

These cookies are delicious, but be warned:  these are cake-like in texture and not as sweet as other cookies, so that has to be kept in mind when eating them.  I enjoyed them without any frosting but next time I will be making the lemon frosting as I'm sure it will only add to the cookie.  Thanks!

awesome recipe.  I added orange zest to the cookie and orange juice to the frosting because some reviewers cited "something missing".  I also added a half teaspoon of salt.  Soft pillow cookies with great flavor.

Great cookie!  Not just for Christmas either, just adjust your sprinkle colors, pastels, patriotic, etc! I followed the other review and used lemon juice/water with the confectioners sugar, and the icing really made the cookie. This is an easy one to bake with your kids. Yum!

Great little cookie!  Used homemade ricotta cheese and followed the cookie recipe.  Glazed with a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar, topped with jimmies.    Nice change of pace!  This one is a keeper.

I didn't enjoy the icing for these - it didn't taste much different from plain powdered sugar to me.  The cookies were also odd.  They reminded me more like overly-sweet pancakes than cookies.  Not terrible, but won't make again.

These cookies were easy to make, however we found them to be quite bland and we didn't care for the texture. They did taste better after sitting for a day or 2. I would not make these again.

This is a nice, moist, tender, cake-like cookie. The only change I made to the instructions is to blend the half cup of sprinkles into the icing, then dip the cookies. Went much faster and used less sprinkles.

These cookies are fantastic! I needed to use up some cottage cheese, and so I used that instead of the Ricotta cheese. I blended it up really smooth, and you could not even tell it was in there.  Personally, I thought the cookies tasted fine without frosting, but the rest of my family enjoyed the vanilla glaze I put on top. My whole family really liked these cookies, and could not even tell that there was cottage cheese in it (which is saying a lot).  These cookies are light, fluffy, and cake-like. There's not a whole lot of flavor, but you don't really need any. They taste fine just the way they are. They do not look like they're done after 8-10 min. but they are--I baked mine for 10 min. and they were done. Though you could probably bake them a little longer without over-baking them. Still, they were not doughy on the inside at all.  Although I probably would not buy cottage cheese/ricotta cheese specially just to make this recipe, it's a great way to use it up!  Eat them warm, that's when they taste the best! ;)

Like other reviewers I had leftover ricotta that I didn't want to waste.  This recipe was easy to make and delicious.  I altered the recipe and instead of icing them I added chocolate chips.  I also chopped up some fresh strawberries and added them and then drizzled some white chocolate on them (but they need to cook a bit longer with the strawberries or they end up a little soggy).  Everyone loved this recipe and I will definitely make them again.

Don't have anything bad to say about this cookie recipe. We just loved it. Held shape well during and after baking, didn't spread, puffed nicely. Flavorful, moist, light and airy, soft, and stayed soft even the day after baked. These didn't last long at all. Yummy!!

This recipe is absolutely great for the cookie part.  Everyone that tried it, loved it, including one friend of mine who is extremely picky about food.  The texture was amazing.  The only reason why I did not give this recipe 5 stars was the icing.  I had quite a hard time getting the icing to harden properly.  When I tried to pile the cookies, the icing got sticky and smooshed.   A couple of tips: 1. Put the sprinkles on right after the icing so they stick 2. Role the dough in balls before placing on cookie sheet to form a nice shape 3. You may need to bake the cookies longer than the recipe's alotted time.  I took out my cookies just after they began to brown slightly on the bottom, and I was happy with that consistency.

I thought these cookies were very delicious.  They definitely DO NOT have a traditional crisp cookie texture.  They are more cake-like.  But, nevertheless, they are very moist and flavorful.  Instead of lemon in the icing, I used confectioner's sugar, milk and a touch of almond extract.  Next time I will try the lemon flavor in the icing.  I halved the recipe and got 3 dozen cookies out of it.

I love the texture of these cookies. I did make a few additions.  I added the zest and juice of 1 lemon to the batter and because I didn't have lemon extract I added the zest of 1 lemon to the icing. I also omitted the sprinkles. These cookies looked like they were purchased at the bakery but were so much better.  My whole family loved these.  My son after taking one bite wanted to know if we can make these again next week. This made alot of cookies...they were gone in 3 days.  Can't wait to make them again.  Thanks!

I loved the taste and the texture is really soft!  The reason I gave it a four stars is because my 10 years old son didn't like them.  He loves all kind of cookies, but he didn't like this one.  He said, "I don't think it is cook yet.  It's like eating a dough!"

I made one half of the batter into cookies and realized that they take more like bread.  So, I put the other half in a bread pan to bake.  When I brought the bread to an office party, people loved it, especially with a bit of lemon extract to give it a citrusy flavor!

A little too soft for my tastes but good nonetheless.  It's a good way to use extra ricotta but I don't think I'd buy ricotta just for this purpose.

I was a little disappointed with these.  Admittedly, I've never had ricotta cookies before, so I had no idea of what they would taste like.  I found the plain cookies to be a little dry (even though I cooked them less than 10 minutes) and rather bland.  They taste like slightly sweetened cake, but have little flavor of anything else.  I don't like super-sweet cookies, but I like food to have flavor and I had expected a more buttery flavor considering how much (1 cup, yikes!) is called for in the recipe.  I ended up not even putting the lemon icing on it because it tasted way too fake to me.  I think it would have been better had I used real lemon juice rather than extract.  Instead, I whipped up a light buttercream which improved them a bit and they did taste like little cakes.  I can see these being served at weddings or showers with different frostings, ie almond, chocolate, etc.  Just not my cup of tea, I guess.  UPDATE: I've since had ricotta cookies made by a friend's grandmother who lives in Italy.  They tasted similar to these, but were way better; they just melted in my mouth.  Now, if I can only get that recipe....

I made these to use up some ricotta from a small batch of lasange that I made (American Lasange from this site!)  and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know what to expect, but they are really good and easy to make.  I made two kinds of glaze, one with lemon extract and another with strawberry extract.  Both are good, but I prefer the lemon.  My boyfriend even liked them.  He was apprehensive about trying one, but said they were "pretty  good."  Even so, I think these are best served at a baby or bridal shower...something where women are the main guests.  It's kind of a girlie cookie.  :)

I was a little disappointed with these. First, I had to cook them longer than 10 minutes because they were doughy any earlier. Once they were done -- they were very moist and tasty. But then I put the glaze on and unless I did something wrong (very possible), all it did was make the cookies really sticky and quite a mess.

These are one of my favorite cookies and the recipe was flawless and pretty easy.  However, how do you recommend storing them?  I did the single layer.  I put them in an air tight container and they got mushy and my jimmies melted and ran.  Please help!!

what a phenomenal cookie!  Such pillowy soft delights.  The texture is outstanding.  I like the versatility of this recipe as far as extracts.  I did add about 1/4 tsp salt to help bring out flavor.  I opted for a tsp of vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract in the dough itself with the grated rind of one lemon.  I just made a glaze using 10x sugar, lemon juice, and scant 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I don't like a lot of lemon extract in frosting, as too much of it tends to come off as artificial.  The addition of the lemon juice in the glaze lends a tartness to the cookie.  This cookie can withstand the glaze without being overpoweringly sweet due to the mild sweetness of the dough itself.  What a wonderful cookie!  decorated with holiday non-pareils after glazing.  I used a size 'small' pampered chef cookie scoop and this made a nice big batch. (which is a good thing because they will go fast)  Thank you!

YUM!  I loved these cookies.  They are so moist and fluffy.  My only problem with the recipe was the frosting.  It made way too much!  I would halve the frosting ingredients in the future, but keep the same amount of lemon extract.  We wanted more lemon flavor.  And just FYI - I looked in various places and it seems that you do NOT need to refrigerate them after baking.  I wasn't sure because of the ricotta.

This is a wonderful recipe that is very versatile.

I make these all the time with a small variation.  I add the zest of one lemon just before adding the flour.  Use the lemon's juice (with a bit of bottled lemon juice) along with powdered sugar to make a glaze instead of the icing.  Dip baked cookies into glaze and place on racks (with newspaper underneath).

If you prefer, you can also use an orange instead of lemon.  This recipe holds up to variations only limited by your imagination.

I was very apprehensive about making this cookie. I have never had ricotta cheese until this week when I bought it to go in my lasagna (I usually use cottage cheese). The ricotta was a great addition to my lasagna but then I had a lot of it left over and no idea what to do with it. I found this recipe and decided to try it, not really expecting to like it. But it IS a great cookie! I followed the recipe exactly for the cookie, but I did not make the icing. My husband-who is not into sweets-, loves this cookie just as is, no frosting. The only extra thing I did was sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the top of them before baking. Also the cookie scoop idea someone else mentioned here, works wonderful for these cookies! Thanks for the recipe! :) Will definitely make it again, likely every time I make lasagna. ;)

These are a soft, cake-like cookie.  They are easy to make (I put tin foil on my pans instead of greasing them as was suggested in other reviews).  Mine took 14 minutes instead of the suggested 10, but it was also hard to tell for sure when they were done because they are such a firm cookie.  I didn't add any icing as my family doesn't care much for sugary foods and so far everyone likes them.  I deducted one start just because they don't really have a flavor or taste.  I'm tempted to throw in a cup of chocolate chips or some lemon zest or orange juice next time I make them to give them some flavor.

This is my most requested Christmas cookie for years now.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I do not make the lemon glaze.  I simply sprinkle the top of the cookies with red and green sugar sprinkles before baking.  These cookies are not super sweet and are more like a moist cake consistency.  Baked cookies freeze well if you want to make a few weeks ahead or store extras.

The whole family loves these cookies.  I didn't use lemon in the icing, I used vanilla.  Half of the icing amount was enough and I used butter-no shortening. This was a test batch for holiday cookies and it made the cut.  Thanks for a unique cookie, outstanding light texture.

Very moist, puffy cookies. We really liked the flavor of the cookie and the glaze took it over the top.

I made these cookies for the first time tonight and YUM! I made them as written including the glaze. I did however leave the sprinkles out because I didn't have any. Very good cookie and I will definitely be making them again, perhaps even try a different flavor extract like cherry, even though the lemon is very yummy!

Tastes pretty good but it was really hard getting the dough onto the cookie sheet without getting it stuck to my hands so the dough was too big to cook through at times. The icing also doesn't taste like anything other than powdered sugar. Good though. Probably not making again though.

These are pretty good. I changed it up by adding 1 tsp of Vanilla and 1 tsp of Anise, and just did a lemon glaze, which was what really makes these cookies. Not Bad though.

Cut the recipe in half and followed it exactly.  They are excellent!  Very light, airy and cake like texture.  I had anticipated that from the ingredients and the reviews.  No disappointment here.  Will make these again and they have earned a place on my christmas cookie list.  I may use almond extract in the glaze next time instead of lemon, although the lemon was perfect for these cookies.  Enjoy!!

Wow, these are surprisingly good! It's a cake-like cookie that doesn't spread too much.  I think the cookie has perfect sweetness without the frosting.  I made the frosting with 1/2 tsp lemon oil for a half batch and hubby said it needed more lemon. I might try real lemon juice in the frosting next time for a more potent lemon frosting.  I baked mines for 12 minutes (they're a bit huge) and they were slightly underdone at the top of the cookie. However, I LOVED the gooey underdone texture. It adds moisture, as if the frosting seeped into the cookie.

I had one cup of ricotta cheese left over from making lasagna, and although I was weary about cookies with cheese in them, boy I am glad I tried this recipe! I halved the ingredients and baked the cookies for 13 minutes. It made 30 medium sized cookies. For the frosting I just used butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and almond extracts thinned with water. These would make a great holiday cookie with the right colored sprinkles.

Loved this recipe.  Makes a lot of cookies.  My only suggestion is that you may want to cut the recipe in half.  Look forward to experimenting with different icing flavoring, but my family loved the lemon!  Nice soft cookie.

These cookies have a wonderful, very sweet taste. I did not ice them, I think it would be too much. They came out looking like pancakes more than cookies. Probably will not make again.

These were delicious.  I made them for family at Christmas and they held up well during our travel.  I will warn that if they are in an airtight container for more than a couple of days all the moisture in these cookies will turn them into a soggy clump.  In other words, they aren't the kind you'll ship across the sea.  They may make it to the next state, but beware and eat these light and moist cookies up quick.

Just finished making these and they are delicious.  Very moist.  Instead of using the icing listed, I went with the glaze from the Ricotta Cookies II recipe.  I prefer a lighter glaze over an icing for these cookies.  My Italian friends would be proud of me.  I'm including these cookies with 3 other types I made to give out for Christmas treats!

Good, and easy.  I got a lot of interesting comments when I answered the questions about what was in them, but everyone loved them.  I had to bake about 15 min each batch; was too gooey inside otherwise.  They are a mild, not very sweet cake like cookie.  They do not spread much at all. I eliminated the lemon extract from the frosting only bc I had candy cane sprinkles that are peppermint and I didn't want the flavors competing.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good.  A nice change from primarily chocolate dominated cookies.  I only made 1/2 a batch because I didn't have the full amount of ricotta and I still got 36 cookies out of the batch.  They came out very light and just slightly sweet, with a nice hint of vanilla.  I was going to make two kinds of icing, one with lemon and the other with almond extract, but when I took the bottle of almond out of the cabinet I found it had evaporated so I had to ice them all with lemon.  It was very nice, although I think I may use real lemon juice next time instead of the extract because the lemon did not taste as true as it could have been.  One last note, I had no problem with my icing completely drying.  I did a light coat though so that may have been why.

This recipe for ricotta cookies is fabulous! They are everything a ricotta cookie should be - light, fluffy, a little creamy, and not too sweet.  I found my cooking time to be about 12 minutes and I used almond extract in the frosting.  They were delicious!  I will be making them again soon with lemon extract to see the difference.  Beware:  The recipe makes a lot of cookies (not that they last that long, though...)!

Everyone Loves these cookies. They are now the desert everyone asks me to bring to family gatherings. I don't make my own icing tho. I use a can of whipped strawberry frosting from the store. I also use light margarine, fat free ricotta, splenda and unbleached wheat flour. I always make recipes a little more healthy if I can, and these taste awesome even when I make my "healthy" version.

We loved this cookie. I had only one problem, the lemon frosting never set on the cookie - it never dried. Does any one know how I can fix this problem?

These were a great way to use up some extra ricotta that we had.  For a nice light soft cookie with a little lemon flavoring, these hit the spot.  I made half with almond extract in the frosting, but I think the lemon were much better.

These cookies were okay but came out more like ricotta cakes than cookies.  They dont have much taste, maybe because I used vanilla in the batter....dont think i will make these again.... I made these again instead of the other recipe but they were use the other recipe from now on.  Maybe add some more flour.

These cookies are great!  They have a cake-like texture, yet are very light and have a delicious taste.  I cooked them a minute or two longer than the recipe states in order to slightly brown them on the bottom; otherwise they are a little too fragile to handle.

I made these cookies and found them to be absolutely fabulous.  They are so easy to make and come out wonderfully moist.  I read Jane's review and decided to try using Almond extract instead of lemon for the frosting.  Great choice!  Just remember when using the Almond to keep any Tree Nut allergy friends and relatives in mind.  Next time, I will make both frostings so that my nieces can enjoy these tasty cookies too.

I doubled the batch,  skimped on the flour a little (ran short) & they were excellent.  I didn't do the frosting part , just sprinkled the tops with confectioners sugar with some cinnamon & ginger powder added.   We all LOVED them!       It's a keeper. Next time, I'll try  adding anise oil to the batch & use straight confectioners on top, I think it would make a great Italian cookie. Thank you for sharing.

I absolutely love these cookies and so does my family. It's like have the perfectly sized mini cake. Had purchased them from an Italian bakery and just had to know how to make them myself. I make mine with lemon zest (from one lemon) instead of using the extract, it really gives it an authentic lemon flavor and its just right. I also cheat on the frosting, since I've never gotten the right consistency with the powdered sugar. I purchase a can of vanilla frosting (or any flavor you like) and zap it in the microwave for about 40 seconds (or until it is nice and thin - also don't spend the extra money on the one they claim is just for microwaves - just remember to remove ALL of the foil top and lid), stir and start dipping the full cookie. I then place them on a wire rack with a jelly roll pan underneath to catch the drippings and immediately sprinkle with confetti decorations, mini-nonparells, etc.

Love this cookie.  So light you feel like you could eat a dozen.  I baked them for 12 minutes instead of 10 and only frosted lightly before dipping in regular sugar.  EVERYBODY loved them when i served them for a birthday at work.

These cookies are very good and always a big hit. I sometimes make the icing using vanilla extract instead of lemon.

I made these cookies for a family picnic and they were a hit!  I did have to bake a tad longer than the recipe called for.  Very easy to make but the recipe yields so many cookies it seemed I was glazing forever!!!  Will make again.

These are yummy light little cookies.  My husband was disappointed when he saw that I frosted all of them, he preferred them plain.  They go great with a cup of coffee.

This cookie tasted okay.  The dough was really hard to work with.  I won't be making it again.
