Super easy and quick ! I used my Mandolin to thinly slice.  I also sliced the beets as opposed to dicing them.  1-2-3-done!!

I whipped this up for my husband and I for lunch today, and we both really enjoyed this!  I scaled this down to 2 servings, and didn't need the full 1/4 cup of parsley, just added a sprinkle on top. The flavors are so fresh and light. I can't wait to make this again during the summer, as it is the perfect summer side salad on a hot day. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
