This rub is quick to throw together and tastes great. I used it on baby back ribs and it really gave the meat a wonderful flavor. Ignore the calories and servings on this recipe. I had a lot left over after coating a full slab of ribs on both sides.

Excellent! Loved this rub. I used on pork that I  marinated in this rub and put in the crock pot. After 8-10 hours, shredded the meat and added our fave BBQ sauce. Excellent BBQ pork! Family loved...thanks!

This rub is great. The pork ribs had a tasty crust outside and  so moist, tender and juicy inside. I get frequent requests for these. My daughter has to have these for her birthday dinner. Thank you for this wonderful spice rub. It was exactly what I was looking for !!!

we used this on a boston butt and it came out pretty good.. we're usually not one for rubs with sugar but it wasn't overpowered by the sugars.. i liked the small amount of heat on the end.. bf said it produced a nice candy on it.. i agree.. bf's sister and niece stopped by and tried it and said they liked it too..  i tripled the salt but kept everything else the same.. caution it does make a lot and i even halved the recipe.. ty for this simple rub

The flavor on this was great, but it's lacking on salt. The recipe calls for 1 tsp...1 Tbsp would be more appropriate for this amount of rub IMO.

Great rub!!  we used on a charcoaled/smoked pork tenderloin and it was delicious.  My husband and I thought it was perfect as written, my daughter said it was too spicy and next time I think I would cut the cayenne in half.  Also, use this liberally to build a nice crust.  Delicious-- thanks for sharing, Big James!

I've smoked two shoulders with this rub and it came out phenomenal! The only change I made was to add a little more salt than requested. 
I bought all my ingredients in bulk at Winco and made the rub to last for a few smokes.

Used this with a slow cooker for game day pork butt and I received nothing but compliments! I removed some of the fat/excess liquid off prior to shedding the meat apart. I used all of this on approx 8 lbs of pork butt - THANK YOU for the great recipe! *I added 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic and 1/2 sliced onion on top as well.

Excellent rub. I made it 24 hours in advance, put pork tenderloin in plastic freezer bag with the rub and refrigerated overnight. Adds a great dimension to BBQ pork loin.

I made it for our family vacation to rave reviews (hubby said it was the best thing I’ve made yet on the smoker)! I had to half the recipe, because it was going to make too much. 

Made it again tonight for our 4th of July feast. I’m also going to try it on a brined turkey breast.

I was looking for a similar spice to the Fiesta brand Pork Rub blend since I cannot find it in my town. I am so pleased I found this recipe, it's even better (of course!) I left out the celery seed and the dry mustard, I didn't think it would go with the recipe I was going to make. I made a modified version of the tangy slow cooked pork roast recipe on this site &  liberally sprinkled this on top of the roast, it made a fabulous sauce! Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I added Carolina Reaper pepper power and omitted the white sugar.  I used honey on the pork ribs once the rub was applied. Excellent rub recipe! Thank you.

Great rub! Should have enough left for next time. I made this run for an 8lb pork butt that I smoked. It tasted great and produced an excellent bark. I will definitely use again.
