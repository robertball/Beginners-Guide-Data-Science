This recipe is delicious; however, 1/3 cup of basil is too much for my taste.  Next time I will use less.

Excellent!  I double the sauce (and this works with skim milk if that's a concern) and add a bunch of extra veggies (julienne carrots, squash, & zucchini with a box of frozen chopped spinach).

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I'm a bit tired of red sauce.  I used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and mozzarella instead of 4 cheese blend and it was de-lish.  I did notice that a food processor really helped!

Oh My God!!!! This was fantastic, and the great thing is, you can really put in whatever vegetables you like. I added spinach to it and it was sooooooo good. It didn't take that long to assemble wither, and you can put it together and cook it the next night. Highly recommend. The only thing is next time, I would double the ingredients for the sauce, becuase I really had to scrape the pan to have enough.

This was very good. I love the white sauce for a change. I used 1 1/2 tsp. dried basil in place of fresh and small curd cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

I cheated and prepared this recipe using no-cook lasagna and frozen veggies. Still this tasted like something I had spent all day slaving over. This is a rich and creamy comfort food my family will have again and again.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!!!  I don't like red peppers, so I left them out.  Also, I couldn't find fresh basil at the store, so I substituted 1-1/2 tsp. of dried basil and 1-1/2 tsp. of dried oregano for the fresh basil.  I'll definitely make this one again!

Very good! I made several changes that made it really delicious. For one, I added 8oz of baby bella mushrooms to the veggie mix, as well as some leftover spinach I chopped up. Note that you will need a pretty large skillet to cook all veggies in! I also added about 3/4 of a cup of prepared marinara sauce to the cheese mixture, which added a lot of flavor. I think the recipe requires more salt than called for, but maybe that's because I used different brands of cheese. I added a fair amount of S&P to both the veggies and the ricotta mixture before assembling. Finally, I sliced some fresh tomatoes and added those on top of the lasagna before the final sprinkling of cheese.

Yummy!

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT - I added a few extra seasonings though like dried parskey and I too couldnt find fresh basil this time of year (had it been summertime I could have found it in my mom's garden) .. but anyway .. it was delicious and will definitely make it again - I never tried to make a veggie lasagne and always used the traditional meatballs and sausage and gravy (or sauce depending on where you are from) .. I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy and delicious veggie lasagne .. Next time though I think I'll add some fresh chopped spinach to the veggie mixture :)
Thanks for a great recipe !!!!  Try it .. you'll LIKE IT !!!!

Okay, I didn't make the whole dish, I just made the sauce to use in another recipe - it was NOT GOOD!!  It was very bland and had an unappetizing jelled consistency after baking.  I won't make this again.

If anyone can tell me what I did wrong, please do.  I followed the directions and the ingredients except dried herbs for fresh; shredded Parm for grated; green pepper for red.  The FLAVOR was very good.  The TEXTURE was awful.  I didn't get the point of making the Parm sauce when using two cups of ricotta and three cups shredded cheese.  I'm wondering how this would work with more Parm sauce, which was tasty, and less other cheese.  When I took the cover off (which the recipe doesn't tell you to use but which is assumed by later instructions to 'uncover'), the edges appeared to be bubbling in oil that I believe came from the cheddar in the shredded cheese.  The bottom layer of noodles was not quite done.  The texture, I think from the ricotta, was grainy.  BTW, I measured out all of the ingredients before beginning the preparation, so I could focus on the recipe directions.  From the time I started until I put the dish in the over was one hour and forty minutes.

This is such a great alternative to potatoes, and really turns an ordinary dinner into something special.....Everyone loves it, and there is rarely any leftovers.

I miss read the directions and put the basil in the cream sauce also... it turned out6 pretty good anyway.  I also used different veggies b/c I used what I had fresh... (zucchini, squash, corn, carrots, and mushrooms) the flavor wasn't quite what i was lookin for. I didn't have fresh basil, so i added a tbsp. of dry and it was definatly a basil lasagne.  Next time i'll try differnt flavor (maybe a balsamic vin.), or stick with the fresh.  Thanx!

Very tasty, but a little bit bland. Our version turned out more like a primavera pasta than a lasagne.
