This was ok.  I thought it tasted bland.  Used boneless skinless breasts and dipped in egg to keep coating on.  I won't make this again.  My husband liked it though.

I thought I followed the recipe carefully, but I had the following problems: 1. breading needed more seasoning.  If I were to make again, which I probably won't, I would definitely add more herbs & spices. 2.  breading did not stick when I fried. 3. recipe called for 1/2 cup of oil, which was not nearly enough to cook.  I tripled the amount of oil, which helped because I didn't have to continually turn the chicken, thus causing the coating to fall off. I don't think I will make this recipe again.

This recipe was good.  The batter fell off the chicken, but I think that that was my fault, all in all very tasty.

The recipe is somewhat bland. I'd suggest adding pepper sauce (Tabasco, etc) to the buttermilk. Also, to make it quicker (and unfortunately change Kathy's recipe somewhat!) is to mix cornmeal with crushed potato crisps. Because they are salty, not extra salt might be needed. Try a cheese-and-onion flavour. AND: don't fry. Pack in an oven dish and bake, drizzled with a little olive oil. This way the covering won't come off either.

Wonderful! The chicken was incredibly moist and overall had a great flavor. This is also the only fried chicken that I've ever cooked that actually came out crispy!

Just from experience I added smoked paprika, garlic salt and a pinch of cayanne to both the buttermilk marinade and the coating.  I also changed the method somewhat.  Marinate the chicken, I used boneless skinless breast cut into serving size pieces, then dip the buttermilk soaked chicken into the flour and set aside while dredging the remaining chicken.  Then the dredged chicken go back into the buttermilk for a quick coating and then into the seasoned potato flakes.  I used a cast iron skillet - browned one side, flipped and then into a 400 degree oven.  Crispy and moist with the breading in tact.  Thanks for a nice dinner.

Fantasticconcept, makes great porkchops also.Always pound breasts if large and cut in half & pound  pork chops thin before marinating Anyone who really cooks, knows to adjust amounts and seasonings to their own tastes. for all recipes Try crushed saltines,rice krispies, or breadcrums with  half flour for differnt coatings We do like the potato flakes I add seeasonings like garlic powder and 1 teaspoon more salt this recipe makes economical pork steaks tender and terrific! Thanks!

I used celery salt instead of regular salt and added a tsp of onion powder and BAM! It's incredible!! I also used boneless/skinless breasts ponded flat instead of whole chicken pieces.

I'm going to try this but add a packet of ranch dressing mix to the buttermilk, let it marinate, then season with some black pepper and salt to flavor the chicken then use flavored potato flakes like garlic and herb, use more oil and i BELIEVE it would be totally awesome!!!!

Yes get into your spice collection and add a lil' sumpin to the buttermilk marinade. I opted to do a 1/3 sour cream and onion chips, 1/3 potato flakes and a 1/3 flour. Double bread the chops by taking them out of the marinade, into the breading, then in egg water mixture, then back in breading. Then put in good n' hot oil. 1/2 a cup is not enough. Turn these delicately and use a spatula to take them out or yes the breading will fall off.

Yum!  I was worried it would be bland, so I added some BBQ sauce before dipping in the potato mixture and I used seasoning salt instead of poultry seasoning.  Delicious, fried up nice and crispy!

Very nice change from flour breading! I pounded chicken breasts, added ground Parmesan, pepper flakes, a packet of dry zesty Italian dressing, cayenne and paprika to the potato flakes. I fried it in half coconut oil, half olive oil. It was light, tasty and very easy to make. The chicken came out very tender from the overnight marinade! Bet it is good with the ranch another lady mentioned as well.

This was really good, the coating was perfect.  Well worth buying buttermilk instead of the cheating method of adding lemon juice or vinegar to sweet milk.
