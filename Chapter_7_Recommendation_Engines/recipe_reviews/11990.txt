I make this at least once a week and my kids love it - it is gone immediately! 

I read some of the negative reviews and have some suggestions.  First of all, this mac and cheese is an "eggy/custardy" type.  If you think it is like creamy mac and cheese, your expectations will be different than what you get.    Secondly, you really need to prepare it in an oblong, the larger crockpot.  It makes all the difference in the consistency results.   I tried the smaller circular crockpot and because it is deeper, it doesn't cook throughout - just doesn't work right and produces a different dish entirely.   The oblong crock of course produces a thinner dish and as a result, it cooks throughout.   Also it works much better if you cook on low throughout and don't try to speed things by cooking on high for the first hour.

I live in NC and there is a cafeteria, (K&W) here that has mac and cheese just like this -  when we moved here, it took a few visits to get used to it but my kids have grown up on the stuff.  Also - I use reduced fat everything - milk, cheese, etc.   Try the larger crock and you'll love the results.

After reading other reviews and making the slow cooker lazagne, I decided to try this without cooking the elbow noodles at all.  It turned out great!  I also beat the eggs and then added the milk(s), cheese and other stuff.  Try not cooking the noodles first, it is great!

I have no idea why this got such bad reviews.  My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  I read the other reviews and took some of their advice and added the noodles half cooked. I cooked the noodles for about 6-7 minutes then added it to the cheese mixture.  I cooked the dish for 2 hours on high and got perfect results.  The noodles were not mushy at all.  And for you people that say that you prefer the velveta stuff or whatever, this is a custard style mac and cheese, it's not a cream style.  It's supposed to be chunky!  Be sure to scramble the eggs with the milks before you add the cheese and noodles, you won't get pieces of scrambled egg that way.  Try it at least once if you like homemade mac and cheese. Don't cook it for 5 hours you'll probably get mush that way.  About 2 hours on high is all you need.  Thanks a lot for this recipe. I will for sure make this again.

OK...I made this to recipe specs the first time...not a good idea.  First it was overdone and mushy, yet dry...lol.  So, I added the pasta UNCOOKED the next time, but it still seemed overdone.   So, 3 tries later, I cook it on high for about 2 hours and it is truly perfection!!!  The ingredients are great..the method just needed fixing for me.

This turned out just as good as the baked version!  I didn't cook the macaroni at all before putting it in the crock pot and used 1 egg.  Will make again and again, my 3 yr old loved it.

4 stars...needed some alteration.  
First..this is a baked style firm casserole dish.  Keep that in mind, it's not creamy.  I found the recipe great with the following alterations.  I doubled it.  I did not pre-cook mac.  I was going for the "one pot" cleaning theory so I made it in the cooker bowl and I wanted to see what would happen if I was too lazy to dirty the cheese shreader (processor) so I cubed the cheese.  It all worked fine. I used 1 - 16 oz block of cheese, half cheddar, half colby/Jack.   With these changes, it turned out great!  Add some beans and chicken and you'll have a complete meal.

Here is the key for this to be a success after reading MANY MANY reviews.... Do not cook macaroni or it will turn to mush. Add only 1 egg add 2-3 cups of shredded cheese and 2 oz of velveta cubedthis will give you the creamy texture you are looking for make sure to whisk all the wet ingredients together including egg. Pour it all in the crockpot stir every 20-30 mins cook for 3 hous on low. I made it like this and i got rave reviews at the 4th of july party someone actually referred to it as an "orgasm in their mouth" lol

I was amazed at how good this turned out.  I used 2% fat sharp cheddar and cooked this for about 4 hrs. 15 min.  I felt the eggs an unnecessary ingredient.  To bind the sauce I dissolved 1 T cornstarch into 2 T water then dumped that in with the other ingredients.  For extra flavor, I will add dry mustard, dash nutmeg and worcestershire.  I really enjoyed this and will make it again!

I have used this recipe twice.  I think it is delicious.  The second time that I made it I did not put the last cup of cheese on top right away.  I stirred it at least once every hour to prevent it from burning which several people commented on.  This also allowed me to cook it for the full time which prevented the milk separation that some of you talked about. The last hour of cooking time I put the last cup of cheese on top.  I used half mild cheddar and half sharp and added a little more salt. Definitely a recipe to work with!

I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews about this recipe...I was pretty wary when I made it after reading them the other day, but it turned out to be pretty delicious.  We gobbled it up.  I only cooked it for about 3.5-4 hours after so many people said it dried out.  Next time I'll cook it for about 3-3.5 hours instead since the edges did overcook.  May also eliminate one of the eggs since my husband likes the mushier mac, although I am happy with either kind.  I also only used 3 cups of cheese since it just seemed like an awful lot to me.

BTW, I feel like the person who found chunks of egg in her mac must not have premixed the ingredients as directed...I don' t know how else that could have happened.  It was all perfectly blended.

This wasn't bad, the consistency was different then what I am used to. I followed some suggestions from previous reviews. I used only 1 egg and whisked it in with the milk and used 5 1/2 cups of cheese. I will keep this just for the simple fact that if my oven is overloaded with other things I can makethis. It does need a little spice.

I was surprised to see the rating on this recipe. I have used it for years now and everyone absolutely loves it! The only change I've ever made to it was 2 cups mild cheddar and 2 cups sharp cheddar. I put 2 cups sharp and a cup of mild in the mixture and then the last cup of mild goes on top. When I make this macaroni and cheese it is the first dish to run out. I cannot count the number of people that I have given this recipe to because they liked it so much.

I changed this recipe based on the feedback and it was really good.  I beat the one egg (not two) and then added in the milk, the cheese (I used a Mexican shredded cheese mix), salt, pepper, hot sauce and uncooked macaroni.  I placed it in the crock pot and cooked it for four hours on low.  It really does need to be stirred often or it will burn along the side (which it did when I left it along between hour two and three).  I think not cooking the macaroni before is key - within four hours, the uncooked macaroni became perfectly cooked, not mushy.  I added a lot of hot sauce throughout, as it was a bit bland.  Good recipe.

I thought this was pretty good and had to write to clarify a few of the negative comments. 1st i only gave it 4stars because i made alterations according to my taste. added more cheese. used my fav cheese vs what was suggested and added s&p to my liking. 

on to the negative comments. 1st-this is a baked mac&chz NOT a velveeta type. 2nd- with that being said this is not meant to be stirred during cooking. it RUINS the consistency 3rd-my noodles did not turn to mush. i am inclined to think that some started out with over cooked pasta vs. al dente. 

a few suggestions 1-mix all ingredients minus pasta & egg. Season & TASTE the roux to YOUR liking. Once you have YOUR desired roux mix in egg(s) and then pasta.  2-the edges aren't burnt, its BAKED mac&chz

My alterations
1- i only used mild cheddar as i do not like sharp. 2- added butter. never had baked mac&chz w/o it.
3-used abt 1c more chz. i like chzy

Slow Cooker Macaroni and Cheese I is the exact same recipe except it uses uncooked noodles. It is definitely better.  Way too over-cooked. If you don't like a custard style macaroni and cheese you will not like this recipe. Needs seasoning.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my fiance and my parents (who are not huge mac & cheese fans) and they loved it! The only thing I didnt different is that I almost doubled the amount of elbow macaroni (12 oz or so) and it came out perfect.

This recipe is a great basic.  You can fancy this up anyway you would like!  I would def use only 1 egg, LOTS of cheese (different kinds, i used sharp chedder and montery jack) you can add anything you want i added bacon to mine and only cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours, turned out yummy! it will not be a CREAMY mac and cheese, its a custard style.

I know I won't ever use the recipe in a crockpot again, the cheese did not adhere to the macaroni and sort of became globs.  None of the kids at the party I went to would touch it because they didn't know what it was.  Maybe making it the old fashioned way would be better with these ingredients.  If you do use the crockpot, make the melted cheese in a seperate saucepan and mix together before serving so that the cheese is gooey and covers all the pasta, much more inviting to the eye (we feast with our eyes first).

delicious. would have been 5 stars but I followed reviewer advise & made some changes:  I did not pre-cook the noodles & I used shells since that's what I had on hand.  I used half ched. half moz cheese (again, what was on hand).  I added 1/4 tsp paprika & few dashes of tobasco sauce.  I cooked on high for exactly 2 hours. perfect.

I'm giving this a 3, because although I'm not sure what it was that I did worng, it must have been something .  I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but it could have been user error.  Pay attention while you're making this!!!  I threw the whole batch away after my family each tried a bite.  Too bad, all that cheese!

Tastes great, but you can NOT keep it warm in the slow cooker too long. The noodles get huge and too soft if you keep em on low too long. On weekends my family is in and out and I was hoping to keep this warm most of the day. Back to the old way of heating it as you need it

This was a little different than the baked mac n' cheese I usually make (in the oven with a bread crumb top). The condensed milk together with the sharp cheddar made it a little tangy which was delicious. Very good!

Made this multiple times. Always a hit.

This recipe is a favorite with my family.  I like to use a variety of cheeses, though.  Such as substituting some of the sharp cheddar with a white cheddar, asiago, and a mix of mexican cheeses.

Made this for a Thanksgiving side dish.  It was requested by my brother and kids, they LOVED it.  Very easy.  Actually made the macaroni the night before, mixed all the ingredients for the sauce as well in the crock pot.  When it was time to turn the slow cooker on I just mixed the macaroni and cheese sauce, turned it on low and that was it.  When we were ready to eat it was perfect.  Next time I may add a little dry mustard and grated onion for a little zip.  Great leftover too.  Try it!

Great comfort food recipe! As other reviews suggested, I only used one egg and three cups of cheese. Didn't have evap milk so mixed fat free half and half with the milk. Added seasoned salt and cooked on high for two hours while I ran errands. Perfect after only two hours!

This is tasty!!  It reminded me of when I was little & my mom used to fry fish & make her mac & cheese for us kids.  Beware of the cook time as my slow cooker for some reason cooks faster, 31/2 hours would have been plenty.  Eat it all up, as it doesn't reheat well (kinda smelled like worms) ;).  Thanks for sharing (as well as the memories) Becky!!

I discovered this recipe not through this site, but through my sister-in-law.  She considers this her signature dish.  It's a GREAT recipe if you like a custardy or casserole texture and don't overcook the noodles.  It's also excellent leftover.  My husband actually thinks it tastes better leftover, which is unlike any mac & cheese I've made before.  Most of them lose their flavor and the texture is off.  The one thing I have to question about this recipe as written here is the cooking time.  We cook it for 3 - 3 1/2 hours on low and it comes out perfect.  This recipe calls for double the cooking time.  I would think the noodles would be far too overcooked at that point.

I would never have believed this could be so wonderful!!Cooking for 5 hrs and I served it to our monthly card club all evening, and left it in the slow cooker on 200 and at 12:00 midnight what was left (not much) was just as nice and moist as when it was finished cooking.I was kind of nervous about not being able to look or stir this while cooking but if you follow the directions you will love this recipe !!!

I was surprised that this actually worked. It's good. I did what other reviewers suggested. Used only one egg, used uncooked macaroni and cooked for 2 hours on high. Watch it closely however. If I had waited to check it, it would have been a dried out mess. I also sauteed an onion. If I had green and red peppes I would have added those.

This was awesome ... after a few tweaks.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the egg to 1 and the total cups of cheese to 3.  I did NOT precook the macaroni.  I uses a large oval slow cooker on high for 2 hours.   It doesn't seem fair to rate the recipe since what I made is different than what was listed;  I guess my rating is more for the reviewers than the original poster.  This is a keeper. The resulting texture was very similar to the mac & cheese recipe from "Good Eats" but so much simpler!

I made this for the first time on Saturday there and added simply the same amounts of pasta and mature cheddar as I would in making the 'oven' version.  [I find converting to metric (I'm in Scotland!) produces slightly 'weird' quantities which are just unworkable to measure out.]  

Also substituted half fat evaporated milk for calorie reasons but otherwise followed the suggested quantities.

I found it took around 3.5 hours for this to cook to the proper consistency.  A bit of regular supervision helped in that I would stir every now and then and kept an eye on how thick the mix had become depending on how far the eggs had cooked.  I pronounced it ready when I felt it was, rather than the timing said after reading some of the previous reviews.

To my mind not a slow cooker recipe to go out for the afternoon and leave to do its thing, as you can with others.  Maybe therefore this would account for why it hasn't been a success to some of the cooks?  

Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed it and I would definitely make again.  Thanks.

I am so enjoying this site and in particular finding out all the wonderful things i can do with my slow cooker - other than tenderising meat!

I make this mac and cheese regularly and it is always a hit.  When I double it I will usually just use 6 cups of cheese and it is still PLENTY cheesy!  Very, very good!

This is good. I agree with the person who said it is more custard like.  Leave out the egg and add a can of cheese soup and less milk if you want it more smooth texture!

Like so many others, I had to make a few modifications to suit our tastes. I also needed to adjust the amount I was making for our group. I did parboil the macaroni for a couple of minutes and made sure to stir everything every half hour or so to keep from sticking. Plus, I do think it made for a creamier smoother sauce in the end. Also added some of the reserved hot pasta water to the sauce, in addition to garlic powder. Turned out good. Cooked for 2 hours on high. Didn't bring any home and everyone wanted the recipe so something was done right.

This recipe turns out a custard-style macaroni, modeled after baked macaroni.  If you generally seek comfort in a box of kraft mac or the velveeta baked macaroni this is probably not a recipe you will enjoy.  I omiited 2 cups of cheddar and added 8oz of cubed velveeta.  This made it kind of creamy.  Did not add evaporated milk and there seemed to be plenty of liquid.  Pasta seemed to loose its texture may help not to cook it first.

Slight modification.  We drink rice milk at home, so I used unflavored rice milk in place of the regular milk.  Then, added 1 small dollop of chilled chicken stock for a little twist of flavor and to make up for the fat I didn't get from the regular milk.  Cooked on low in the crockpot for 5 hours.  Tasted great.  texture was more like a casserole than traditional mac n cheese...more scrambled eggy, if you will. Kids did not like it.  Adults did.

Was pretty disappointed.  I tried this recipes with the suggested modifications (2 hrs cooking time, not pre-cooking noodles, adding a dash of Worcestershire) and it ended up quite rubbery in texture and overcooked at the sides.

made 3 batches this weekend. Doubled the macaroni each time.  Batch #1: cooked macaroni 5 minutes, left out eggs, cooked 3 hours, ended up with mushy pasta and crust on the bottom of the crock.   Batch #2: doubled recipe. Did not cook macaroni. Cooked 2 1/2 hours. This one went in a casserole pan for the local soup kitchen.  Batch #3: did not cook macaroni, used 2 cans evaporated milk, 1 egg, 3 cups of cheese. Cooked 2 1/2 hours. Very custardy, a little bland. My family said "no more, this one is not for us."

I've made this recipe for years and years.  Only recently occurred to me that there might be a copy of it on AllRecipes!  Helpful hints: (1) The sharper the cheese the better.  This recipe depends almost completely on the cheese for its flavor, and the milk will mellow most of the sharpness.  (2) You can definitely cook it on high for about half the time.  Although, in that scenario, I wouldn't recommend following other suggestions to not cook the macaroni.  Al dente is fine though.  (3) The shallower the crockpot the better. The more of this dish that you can cover with the cheese topping the prettier and tastier it'll be.

I made this for a pot luck and it turned out great!  I used about a cup of chopped Velveeta cheese to make it creamy and also used the cheddar for flavor.  I didn't precook the noodles and it was ready in 3 hours after cooking on low.  I also added onion and garlic that I had cooked on the stove in olive oil and butter for that extra oomph.

Suggestion:  I have found in my incredible search for the perfect mac and cheese that if I add just 4 - 6 ounces of Velveeta I always get the smooth creamy consistency of a great mac and cheese.  I would leave out at least one egg in this recipe  - chunk up the Velveeta right into the pot.  Give it all a stir about 1/2 way through cooking time.....  dont leave out any of the sharp cheese.....maybe a touch more pasta!!! MMMMMM good

The problem with the negative reviews seems to be that people were expecting something like those ghastly 'mac and cheese' in a box things, and don't understand that that stuff is NOT classic macaroni and cheese, it's just boiled pasta with a salty processed cheese gloop stirred into it.  Traditional baked macaroni and cheese has a custard base which incorporates milk and eggs, like this recipe.  The other negative reviews seem to stem from people forgetting the rule of thumb in slow cooker recipes - that cooking times are suggestions only, as cooking times vary widely from slow cooker to slow cooker!  This is quite a decent recipe, resulting in traditional style macaroni and cheese.  Cooking time for my particular slow cooker didn't need to be as long.

I DID NOT COOK THE MACARONI AHEAD EITHER, ,I CHOSE NOT TO USE THE EGGS IN THIS EITHER AND I CANNOT SEE WHERE IT WAS MISSEDI. I  USED 1/2 CHEDDAR AND 1/2 VELVEETA CHEESE, I MELTED IT IN THE EVAPOTAED MILK, THEN POURED OVER THE MACARONI. TURNED OUT GREAT. IT STAYED NICE AND CREAMY AND DIDN'T DRY OUT. HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE OF YOU USE ALL CHEDDAR CHEESE.

Don't bother boiling up the pasta. I used left over cheddar and made up the rest of the cheese with mozzarella. Just use the odds and ends that you might have. I added some paprika but that didn't have much influence on the taste whatsoever. I used 1 egg and extra egg white left over from another recipe. And I greased the cooker with olive oil.

So how was it? Pretty good and it still is good cold. My toddler decided she wasn't into the pasta in a big way last night and seems to prefer it cold when the cheese is solid.

A good solid comfort food type dish.

The concept of this dish is great!  I made it with some changes: like I didn't pre-cook the macaroni, no eggs, and watched the slow cooker and did open the lid to test it al-dente; this is something one needs to test for themselves as all slow  cookers are vastly different in temperature profiles. If you do this, I believe you will get a desirable product-you may be surprised to find your M&C done in ~1.5 hours instead of 5.  Also, it tends to be firm according to the listed ingredients. 
Many dishes are really 'overcooked' in the slow cooker; however, that's the price to pay for the 'all day' convenience.

The only adjustments I made were to cook the mac halfway and cut down on cook time (2 hours on low is plenty), ingredients were not changed whatsoever and it was delicious.  Since I had to make minimal adjustments to the recipe, I am giving it 5 stars because this really is a delicious recipe.  I think it is important to mix the milk/egg mixture thoroughly before mixing with cheese and pasta, in order to avoid the "scrambled egg" syndrome.  I won't call this a leave it alone recipe, gotta watch for burning since it is heavy on dairy and cheese.  For me, the browned edges are the best part of mac and cheese, so I don't worry so much about the edges browning, just don't let it burn.  Remember, this is not "creamy" mac and cheese.

I tried to stay true to the recipe even with all the differing opinions in the ratings.

I cooked my noodles a few minutes shy of al dente. I used a large oval crock pot, and put it on low. I did not stir while cooking, but I did keep an eye on it throughout the day.

After about 3.5 hours of cooking on low, I could tell the outer edges on one side of the pot were starting to burn, so I turned the heat to keep warm while I prepared the rest of dinner.

I thought this was a delicious mac n cheese and I will make it again. I would have given five stars if the outside hadn't burned. Next time I will probably turn the heat off around 3 hours.

I was super excited about this recipe... especially considering the vast amount of positive reviews and because I had all the ingredients in my pantry waiting for me when I got home from work. I was deeply disappointed. Very little flavor. Texture was mushy. I suppose it is good for kids. Mild and boring, but I won't make this again.

I followed other reviews and only used one egg. I also partially cooked the pasta for 5 minutes before adding it to the crockpot and cooked on low for 3 1/2 hours. Turned out perfectly.

I did not care for this recipe.  Consistency was that of a custardy bread pudding.  Perhaps it was because I programmed my slowcooker to shut off and just switch to warm after 5-6 hours, but I made this purposely knowing I had to work all day, and then head straight to a baseball game.  Will never make this again.

I was craving this so bad that I started making i at 9:30 at night!  And it was worth it...  I made a few changes.  I didn't boil the noodles first (and they came out perfect), I used multiple cheeses and I added a little extra spice in some paprika and red pepper flakes.  Plus I stirred the mixture every half hour and cooked it on high for 2 hours.   Even with the spice it was a little bland so I think I'll add more next time.  Overall though, this was super easy, super quick and really really great!  Thanks!

This turned out fairly good for me. I doubled the recipe, added 2 tsp seasoning salt, 1.5 tsp garlic powder, 1.5-2 tsp pepper and added the noodles without cooking. I cooked on low for about 2.5 hours while we were at my dtrs soccer game. I was surprised at how fast it cooked but the noodles were still a little hard.  The sides were almost burned by that time.  I added more milk and let it cook for another 20 mins.  The liquid was absorbed so quickly I will definitely add more next time. Overall, very good flavor.  Thanks!!

Made two batches for Christmas (different meals) 1 was lousy, 1 was excellent; I think a lot had to do with the size of the slow cooker. I did cut down the egg in both base on other reviews.  Will try again.

I cooked this for about 3 1/2 hours, it turned out great.  Nothing like real Mac and cheese, although I wasn't expecting it because of the reviews.  But it wasn't custardy either.  Mine was more like a cheese casserole with macaroni in it.  I did not cook the macaroni ahead of time either.  Anyway we surprisingly liked it, we were a little nervous from the reviews and hoping not to get soggy macaroni.  It was great!

I modified and sort of doubled the recipe after reading the suggestions, and the recipe was a big hit at work.  I used 3x the pasta - dry, not cooked, no eggs, double the milks, a variety of cheeses, and a tsp each of mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika.  It cooked for 3+ hours but was probably ready a little after two hours.  I would make it again but I thought it dried out too much for my taste after 3 hours. When I checked it at 2 hours, it looked ready to eat then.  I probably should have turned it to low and let it slow down, but still, a hit is a hit!

This was disgusting.  It smelled fantastic and cheesy, but when I took off the lid, I had a mix somewhere between baby spit-up and cottage cheese.  This tasted like scrambled eggs with macaroni.

Oh wow.  I don't know what this was, but it WASN'T mac n cheese.  I'll admit some cockiness on my part: I thought the bad reviews were due to operator error.  I was wrong.   This dish had an odd (and quite gross) cottage cheese-like texture, and very little flavor.  Looking at the fat content of this dish in relation to the wholly mediocre results, it isn't something I'd make again. Sorry.

Well, I read all of the reviews and thought maybe the bad reviews had something to do with not following the recipe exactly.  I followed the recipe exactly and when I took the lid off of my slow cooker I was met with a big pot of mush with no taste.  I ended up tossing it and opened a box of mac and cheese.  This recipe will be filed under 'What Was I Thinking!’  To cook any pasta for 5 - 6 hours at ANY temperature spells disaster.

The reviews were very helpful in making this recipe! I mixed the uncooked macaroni, cheese, both milks, 1 egg, and seasonings together, and then put them into the crockpot. I then added the 1 c. of cheese to the top at the end. I cooked it on low for 2 hours 45 minutes, and it came out great! It was really rich in my opinion so I may reduce the cheese 1-2 cups next time, but otherwise this turned out really tasty!

Awesome recipe - very cheesy. I used a little more elbows than it called for and it was still SUPER cheesy. I have a large slow cooker and I did not cook the elbows ahead of time based on other reviews. I put it on low and it was done in just under 4 hours so I'm glad I was home for the first time with this one because the edges had burned (but we like that). It is super cheesy but it's not the creamy cheesy some may be wanting. This is the home-style mac & cheese we are used to and this recipe is going to be used regularly at my house!

EXCELLENT - The only change I made was suggested by several others. I cooked the macaroni in boiling salted water for only 5 minutes - then I followed everything else exactly except I cooked on high for 2 hours! Perfect!!!

I cook on low for 3 hours and 15 minutes and it's the best mac and cheese I've ever had except Piccadilly Restaurant.  I like when the cheese sticks to the pot and turns brown....almost like the old oven versions.  We don't make it often but when we want mac and cheese, this is the recipe we use.

This is the closest I've ever come to my grandma's macaroni. My fiance's friends request it every time we all get together for dinner. I took other's advice and used only one egg and beat that with the milks. I boiled the noodles for about 6 minutes before adding them. I use reduced fat condensed milk, 2% cheese and skim milk and high fiber noodles to make myself feel better! I found two hours on high was perfect.

Very kid friendly...I do not usually like macaroni and cheese, but I really liked this.  I took some of the other suggestions and only used 1 egg and also used about 4oz. Velveeta, cubed.  Cooked on low for about 2.5 hours...cooked all the way through without being mushy. Will make again...Thanks

Just didn't like it. Not so much that it was bland, but it wasn't very cheesy. Also the edges got way overdone and the pasta was mushy, although I cooked for the minimum time stated. Thanks but I'll keep looking.

I definitely won't be making this again.  The consistency was way too mushy and the flavor was bland. For the time and effort it took to make this, I prefer good ol' Kraft mac & cheese!

I read so many recipe reviews before I decided to make this one.  My brother prefers a dry macaroni and cheese, so this was PERFECT for him.  But, don't get me wrong, it was still moist and delicious.  I mixed all liquid ingredients first (thoroughly with salt and pepper) then added the macaroni.  Also, I used 2 c. shredded velveeta and 2 c. shredded sharp.  It took about 3.5 hrs. to cook - 5 or 6 is a bit much.  Next time, I might add a few pats of margarine on top.  LOVED IT!

Although this recipe was easy to make, the flavor and texture just didn't hit the mark.  The condensed milk flavor was a bit overwhelming.  Also, the ingredients seemed to separate somewhat, rather than forming a smooth, creamy sauce.  We had little puddles of milk on our plates, oozing out from the macaroni and cheese.  :-(

Convenient, quick and delicious.  #1 dish at parties.  You can leave the crock pot on all day.  Cheese doesn't scorch or burn, and stays nice, soft and warm.  Will make over and over again!  (for the lactose intolerant - try will regular or vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk).

A very easy dish to prepare, and liked by all.  A few tips: It comes out great if you only half cook the pasta to begin with; add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more milk; use finely shredded cheese.  These things help not to make it mushy or dried out.

People at work BEG me for this recipe! I treat it like I do all mac and cheese concoctions- an excuse to clean the refrigerator and I use any leftover dairy....bits of hard cheeses, cottage cheese, cream cheese, bottom-of-the-barrel grated cheeses. The base recipe always works.

Not my thing, but the people I cook for loved it, so I would say it was a hit, even if it wasn't for me...I left out the eggs as we have allergies at the house, and I added some simple spices, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper..And I didn't cook the pasta first, just threw it in uncooked, worked good that way, not mushy..

Excellent, but a bit bland. But it will now be a regular staple in my home it's so simple!!!
1. Use large oblong slow-cooker, only cook on low for 3-4 hours.
2. Do not pre-cook macaroni. Stays nicely firm if put uncooked.
3. Add garlic and Parmesan cheese for a bit more flavour.

This was a big hit with my family. I did use the uncooked pasta version of this recipe however and doubled it. I even cooked it on low for about 3 hours. I think all crock pots are alittle different, so you just have to keep an eye on it.

Next time I would cut the macaroni rings by about a third.  Good flavor, but a little dry for my taste.  I used 2 cups of smoked gouda, and 2 cups of cheddar. My slow cooker cooked it too fast, even on low - it was (over)done in about 3 hours.

I made this for my family's Christmas gathering.  It's all gone.  I followed the reviewers who said not to cook the pasta ahead of time and to cook it on high for 2 hours.  I also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder.  I'll definitely make this again.

Recipe is a good base, but needs work. 4 cups of sharp cheddar completely over powers it so it is the only thing you can taste. it needs less time than 5hrs, in this time on low the outside becomes dark brown and tough, I should not have to cut mac and cheese with a knife. I tried it in three different slo cookers

I love how easy this is! I think I cooked the pasta a little too long before I mixed it in but I like soft pasta so it was still very yummy. There are all kinds of possibilities to vary this recipe.

Way too long cooking time.  I taste tested the mac and cheese at around 1 hour and it was very tastey.  I would estimate the cook time needs to be shortened to around 2 hours.  At 5 hours it was burned around the edges and all the flavor had been cooked out of it.  Otherwise I would have given this a great rating because I know that it has potential.  I also added two tablespoons of butter.

This worked well for me. The bottom burned but I left it in the full 5 hours, maybe less time would be better. Per other reviews, I didn't cook the noodles and they were perfect. I will use this recipe again, it's a good recipe when you have no meat and no time to cook.

This was the BEST macaroni & cheese recipe I have EVER come across.  It is a different consistency that most mac n cheese, this recipe is more chunky than creamy, which is just the way I like it!I would first like to say that I am a macaroni & cheese fanatic and it is hard for me to find recipes that really impress me, but this one absolutely did the job! I did change the recipe slightly.  I eliminated eggs completely (it didn't sound appealing and I didn't have any eggs) I added 2 tsp butter, did not add any salt and I only cooked it on high for 2 hours...I think if you pre-cook the macaroni you should only cook it for 2 hours tops or else it will get mushy (stirring every 20-30 min.~because it will stick to the bottom of the crock pot).  I used the exact amount of cheese, milk and evaporated milk the recipe called for and did pre-cook the macaroni and it came out wonderful!!! I will certainly be making this recipe again!!!!!!!

So YUMMY and so EASY. I don't cook the noodles, just throw everything in the crockpot and stir it up. I always double the recipe and I have used a variety of different cheeses. Also I only use 3 eggs. It does need to be stirred throughout the cooking or it will stick/burn to the crockpot. There are handy liners that you can buy to avoid all the scrubbing. Great comfort food.

I've been making this recipe for 10 years and my family LOVES it! My mom always requests this for our family gatherings. It's so easy to make and isn't like your regular, plain mac and cheese. This recipe dresses it up a little. I make it exactly as written. Yum!

Big hit at a pot luck!  I used velveta cheese with the cheddar cheese and half non fat milk with the evaporated milk.  Didn't cook the noodles and they were fine.  Everybody loved this recipe!  Mine finished cooking in 2 hours.

I made this because it looked easy, but being the spice lover I am, added some red pepper flakes, mustard, fresh ground pepper and parm cheese.  My slow cooker is huge and has mulitple settings.  Cooking it on low for 5 hours is perfect.

Awesome!  Just like the buffet serves.  I took another reviews advise and used velveta (6-8 oz) and didn't cook the pasta first.  I didn't have elbow mac so I used mini ziti.

I have made this twice now and loved it both times. The first time I cooked the macaroni halfway, the second time I didn't cook the macaroni at all. It came out better the second time. Each time I mixed it all up the night before and then just turned the crockpot on the next day. This is definitely a keeper recipe for us.

I give this five stars becuase my kids loved it.  I have more of a 'gourmet' taste and thought it rather bland...but I didn't make it for me!!  I did add extra cheese, say 1 cup more.  Talk about an easy recipe to make!  Whenever I host a luncheon for my friends, I put this maccaroni on for all the kiddos that will be coming (they get disappointed if I don't make this for them!).  I've had several requests for this recipe as well.  Works well with whole wheat pasta--just don't let it cook so long it turns to mush!

I am a huge fan of mac & cheese and this was great.  I put it together in the morning and left to go hiking.  Was gone about 5 hours and the sides were burning.  Would suggest not having it on that long.

I took the advice of the  other cooks and it turned out great. Kids & husband gobbled it up. changes made: only cooked noodles  for 6min. I whisked the  egg w/ the milk really well before adding the cheese & none of  the  ingredients were cold from the fridge. I think this kept the eggs from cooking(scrambling). Cooked it on high  for 21/2 hrs. I will definitely make again.

I made two pots of this for a party recently.  I made one using half pepper jack cheese and half mozerella.  It was a big hit.  The pepper jack didn't make it over spicy, just gave it a good flavor.

I'm asked to bring this recipe to get-togethers, it's a hit with us!  The kids prefer the mild cheddar to sharp cheddar, so i typically use it instead.  It's not a creamy macaroni so don't expect it to be.  We usually eat it as a side dish to something else.  Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out clumpy like cottage cheese. The cheese is not creamy at all. This is the second time I've tried it and both times this happened. I feel terrible for wasting so much food. 
Someone else mentioned that it might be because of the eggs. But I won't be trying it again.

This is our absolute favorite mac and cheese dish. I altered the recipe slightly - I use only 1 egg and whisk it with the milk before adding to other ingredients. I also use a mixture of cheeses: sharp cheddar, swiss, jack, and american or velveeta - whatever I have on hand.  YUM!

This for me ended up more like a noodle quiche.  Unfortunately i was expecting creamy noodles.  It was also kind of bland, but a little shake of salt corrected that fine, a very mild macaroni and cheese.

Fabulous recipe! The only change I made was to put the noodles in raw as others suggested and it disappeared. This is going to become a staple in our house. It's the perfect recipe for the "comfort food" mac and cheese. Never buying the boxed stuff again!

I usually make my own from scratch and bake it in the oven.  I didn't have time this time.  So I tried this one.  It's very good but mine turned out a bit mushy.  I like a firmer noodle.  But all in all I would say this was a good one to try.

I didn't cooked the macaroni and I used whole wheat elbows.  I looked in through the glass top after 4 hours and the edges looked burnt so I checked it.  The elbows were mushy.  The edges were burnt. It tasted okay. AND I only had the slow cooked set on WARM.  I won't try it again.

I found this to be too greasy. The first bite was good but after the next few I had to push the plate away. I could see using this as a nice side once I make some changes.

This is an amazing Mac 'n Cheese recipe!  We loved it.  It is so quick & easy.  I read several reviews and decided to make 2 slight changes.  I didn't cook my macaroni before hand, I just added it dry to the cheese & milk mixture.  The only other thing I did different was cook it on high for about 2 1/2 hours instead of low for 5-6 hours.  I just forgot to get this going earlier in the day.  It turned out just fine making those 2 little changes.  It is very filling & yummy!  Perfect on a cold day.

Super good but is ready quick & will burn easily -- I turn my crock on about 1 hour before ready to eat.  Then is best.  I also ad 4 oz Velveeta and cut down shredded cheese by about half

Eggs rose to the top and cheese didn't melt well. It says not to stir but it makes the ingredients seperate and they don't work together. 5 hours is too long, makes it very dry. Bland overall taste.

It was just okay.  I made it exactly as directed.  I was expecting it to be better.  We weren't too crazy about the eggy mixture with the macaroni and cheese.

I followed the directions to a "T" except added 1/4 cup bread crumbs sprinkled on top.  The result was dry macaroni with cheese that looked as though it was never even cooked.  Very disappointed.

When I saw that people put 'too much cheese' in the reviews I knew it was for us! We love cheese!!! My husband liked it, but I must have done something wrong. It came out more like a soufflé. I didn't like it! I will have to tinker with it some to see what caused it to come out like it did!

It was pretty good, but a bit mushy, and I didn't even cook the macaroni first. My daughter liked. One of my sons says it's pretty good and my oldest hates it and asked why I didn't make his grandmas baked mac and cheese. I'll probably just stick to my moms baked mac and cheese.

This is GREAT!  I doubled it for a potluck and it was a hit.  Not a drop left.  A few changes I made:
- I added a few scraps of fresh nutmeg.
- I cooked the doubled recipe on high for one hour then low for 2.5 hours.
- I added some grated parmessaen cheese to the mixture and on top.

So good.  Might slightly reduce the evaporated milk and add regular.  Maybe add a bit off ff cottage cheese.

i was so excited to make this recipe.  i ran home on my lunch break to make it for dinner.  the cheese separated and i didn't care for the egg flavor.  the edges were really burnt.  i want to try this again - but maybe i wont cook the noodles before (they were soggy) and cook it for 4 hours instead of 5.  this was uneatable.  i had to get takeout.

I used uncooked noodles as recomended by others & I also added two tablespoons of mustard to give it a bit more flavor. I let it sit on low until it turned golden brown then I added some chopped green onion on top because when I did a taste test it tasted bland. But that didn't help. I understand it was not supposed to come out creamy like regular macaroni and cheese however, this was not even comparable to a casseroll. It was extremely mushy and bland tasting. My husband and I ended up eating with hot sauce (siracha) which made it taste okay, mostly because all you could taste was the hot sauce. Its consistancy reminded me a lot of oatmeal. I dont think i will make this again, at least not in a slow cooker. I think it would be much better baked in an oven!

Eh. This was just okay. I used a mixture of extra sharp Cheddar, provolone/mozzerella and a chipotle Cheddar. It was still bland. And, the egg and cheese was a little weird. Like having an omelette mixed in with your noodles. My younger son loved it, everyone else had a meh-attitude. I probably won't make it again.

This is pretty good.  Here is the tricks I found.  Spray the crock pot with cooking spray first, I did not cook my noodles.  I just put then in the crock hard.  After 3-4 hours on low they were cooked and it was all creamy.  If you keep your crock pot on longer, the whole thing will start to dry up, but I just added a bit of milk and it was fine.  Now was this the best mac n cheese I ever made, no... but I give it a big thumbs up to make for a crowd.. no oven and can do it ahead of time.

I had made this twice, each time a little different.  Sorry to say, this is not a dish I will make again. 

The first time I made this I, as other suggested, did not cook the pasta prior to added it to the crock pot and only added one egg and about a 1 1/2 cups extra milk.  After four hours (good thing my DH forgot to turn it on before he left for work), it seemed almost perfect--nice and creamy. I added a little more milk and turned it to low to run a couple errands. It turned out to be one big pasta stuck together.  With a little more milk right before serving to help loosen it up, mixing it well (realize the pasta is almost a mush at this point).  It was okay. My 4 1/2 yo who lives for Mac and cheese (99% homemade) didn't eat all of it. 
The next time I made this, I did cook the pasta til al'dente. I omitted the egg and used 1/2 half and half and 1/2 milk, as well as the evap. milk. It did not turn out well at all without any recovery efforts. DS even said he didn't like it and didn't want to finish it. I was able to save it by putting it on the stove and adding more liquid to it, a little nutmeg and dry mustard. He gobbled it up. Seems like the family does not like the custard  style Mac-N-Cheez.

Easy.  I did not cook the noodles first, and cooked on high for just over 2-1/2 hours. Was custardy, not saucy, which is what I expected.  I would definitely make again.  I reheated the leftovers in the oven, sprinkled with a little more cheddar and some buttered bread crumbs.

The taste was very good, however i have to agree with all the others who said the noodles turned to mush. If i try this recipe again i think i will take the advice of others and use uncooked macaroni instead of cooked, maybe that will make a diffrence. I should add that i followed the recipe exactly as it is written here and the noodles were very soft, do in the end i put it all in a baking dish and put it in the oven in an attempt to make a crust on top...that did help a bit but not enough to save the dish. Thanks for sharing anyway.

I did read all the reviews. I made it just like the recipe said but used uncooked noodles which I'm glad I did. The taste was pretty good. But after like 2 hours the edges were getting burnt and it was pretty much one big blob of macaroni and cheese. It didn't look very appetizing. I couldn't imagine using cooked noodles- even bigger blob. My daughter wouldn't even try it.

I didn't have enough milk so I used two cans of evaporated milk to equal the amount of liquids needed.  Next time I think I'll add some peas.  I used raw pasta and it was done in 3 hours.  Perfect for homeschoolers....easy lunch.

I followed the recipe, but after 6 hours it was not right.  It was very dry, even with cheese melted, there was creaminess to the sauce at all.  My kids would not even eat it.  Something must be missing to make the sauce better or I messed it up which is very possible.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews.  Had I read them I wouldn't have tried it.  If you're reading this - DON'T EVEN TRY IT!

Stick with Velveeta shells and cheese!

I followed the suggestion of using more pasta and not cooking it first. I omitted the evaporated milk and only used one egg. I felt there was WAY too much cheese and the salt wasn't neccesary.I only cooked it for 4 hours on low. I think this recipe is a good start but needs a bit of refinement. For now I will stick to my own recipe.

Found this recipe while I was searching for easy crock-pot recipes.  This recipe was so easy to prepare.  When I served it, it looked terrible and tasted worse.  Very bland.  Mushy macaroni with nothing similar to cheese sauce.

Very disappointing. Delicious aromas wafted from the pot, but all we got was a chunky mess. Bland flavor as well.

I read the reviews before making this, and decided to give it a try.  I cooked the mac 'n' cheese on low for 4 hours in the crockpot, instead of 5 or 6, and it was still too mushy.  When I mixed it after it was done cooking, the cooked egg pieces were all through it- ewww~!  I thought the egg would blend seamlessly with the other ingredients, but it didn't.  My 6 year old daughter didn't like this and she normally loves mac. My husband wouldn't even eat it, because he said it's not really appetizing looking and he saw the egg and didn't want to try it.

The mac 'n' cheese was very easy to prepare and that is the only good thing I can say about it.  I made this to the tee and cannot figure out why so many love it.  To each his own.

This was pretty good but the first thing my husband said was "does this have scrambled eggs in it?"  So yes, you could taste the egg pretty well.  We still liked it but people may want to be aware of that.  It does not get a 5 because it's not as creamy as I like.  I think next time I make it I'll just use 1 egg.  It's very easy and cheesy!

Not much flavor, and too thick.  I definitely prefer creamy mac-n-cheese.  This was more like a mass of overcooked noodles and not much flavor to it.  I agree with the reviewers that emphasize using SHARP cheddar cheese- I didn't and wish I had.

This recipe totally bombed with my family, the texture was awful...My daughter who is a mega mac and cheese fan was excited all day waiting for it to be ready.  When at last it was ready, the texture was horrible, she looked at it and said "Mommy this looks wrong"  and when she took a bite of it she asked if we could go to a restraunt instead. I was super disappointed will pay closer attention to the reviews from now on.

Not my type of mac n c. If you like custard like mac n c, it's fine, and it's easy. Some of my family liked it, some did not. If you are looking to replace boxed mac n c, like velveeta shells n cheese, this one isn't it.

I liked this recipe. But I didn't cook the noodles 1st, also I did stir it a couple of times and only cooked it for 3 and a half hours. It did get a little dry so next time I plan on using more milk.

Every year when the family gathers for the 4th of July I am asked to make this mac and cheese. I use already shredded cojack cheese and omit the black pepper, throw it in the pot and join the festivities. It may not be the boxed mac and cheese that they eat at home, but it is gone when I leave.

This is a great recipes.  I put used dry macaroni thinking it would take longer to cook and my mac and cheese was ready with in 2 hours.  I think my crock pot cooks fast though.  Thanks for the recipe.

This did NOT work out for us.  Because the noodles were already cooked and sat all day in a covered slow-cooker, we had completely soggy macaroni amidst separated cheddar cheese with lots of watery pockets here and there.  Probably will not be trying this again.  However, I have heard there are great recipes for homemade mac'n cheese done in the oven, uncovered.  That may be the way to go.

I reaed all the reviews befor I tried to cook it and decided to really cook the noodles underdone. I even reduced cooking time by an hour. I also used various cheeses to avoid it tasting bland. Unfortunately the noodles were too soggy and the whole dish was too bland.

This is a great macaroni and cheese recipe for those days when you just don't want to turn on the oven.  I used only one egg and added one half block of cream cheese and some shredded parmesan.  I will be making it again soon.

I am so happy to have found this recipe! I have been looking for a custard style mac and cheese recipe forever and Finally! Only one thing... I love the crusted cheese and this recipe doesn't have it.  Update,  this was nasty the next day.  It is good right out of the crock pot but completely gross left over.

Followed suggestions left out eggs and added dry mustard, paprika, and garlic salt and cooked on low for 3 hours. Still dry and lifeless. Will be looking for a new recipe.

Flavor-wise, this is great. I added a little dried mustard and onion powder. Next time I might add one less egg, just to see how the texture changes - there was a thin layer of pure custard on top that I wouldn't mind getting rid of - but we were all happy with this. As for the method, I used the same method I use for baked ziti in the slow cooker: I rinse the uncooked pasta and add it with the other ingredients, then cook on high for approximately three hours. This works well for me, but I work from home and can get away with three hour slow-cooker recipes, which I realize that not everybody can. Thanks, we'll make this often!

This is a pretty good recipe, if you like custard style mac. The only change I made was to use whole wheat pasta instead of the regular kind. The first time I made it, I did not precook the pasta--as was suggested by other reviewers. I felt the mac turned out too dry. I precooked on the second time and it was delicious. Both times I added a little more cheese than was called for--sonme things just don't need exact measurement.

This is a hit with my family! I have made this twice and both times it turned out creamy and so good! I make it the night before and refridgerate and do not cook the macaroni. I only use 1 egg and add extra milk and a half pound of cubed velveeta cheese. I do feel that you need to be around to stir while cooking. I doubled the recipe yesterday and it turned out great. Very easy. Kid friendly! They like to help with this one too!

This is my favorite and everyone loves it.  As one review said, it is not the normal consistency of a creamy mac & cheese.  It is just way more awesome and even better if your lucky to get away with leftovers.

I left the crock pot on high too long, but if we didn't eat the edges this was by far the BEST macaroni ever.  I also didn't cook the noodles prior to mixing it up.

Incredibly, incredibly, incredibly bland - even with extra-sharp cheddar - reminded me of hospital food.  Also quite clumpy.  At least it was easy.  Will not make it again.

This was OK. I'd probably make it again but might add some extra liquid. I didn't cook the pasta beforehand, and I'm glad. I think if it had been cooked first, it would have turned into mush.

This is a good, standard mac & cheese recipe, also a good for "tweaking" the ingredients however you'd like.  The only small drawback was that it came out a little too dry, which could probably be alieviated by a little more milk.

This is a great tasting and easy Mac and Cheese recipe.  You will rarely have any left overs.  Fat content could be scaled down but I recommend trying it at least once.

I will not make this again.  It was like scrambled eggs, cheese and macaroni mixed together, even after only using one egg that others recommended.  It solidified on our plates before we even finished our meal.  I wouldn't recommend this.

Kind of eggy, mushy and not very cheesy considering the amount of cheese in it. I like "cafeteria" baked macaroni and cheese, and I thought this would be similar. I think I'll go back to cooked elbows, Velveeta and a bit of milk.

This is a high-maintenance slow-cooker recipe if you want it to turn out more creamy than chunky or custard-like.  I used some velveeta with regular cheese as well, to give it a creamier texture.  I did have to stir it every hour to keep it from burning and it was done in 2 hours though I didn't even cook the noodles.  Still, I had to throw out the leftovers because it was too chunky and dry in the end.  I'll stick with my Kraft mac n cheese!

A big hit at my house, though I did heed all the warnings about not cooking the macaroni all the way through.  According to a coworker (who loved it when I brought it to potluck and later made it at home), this recipe suffers if you try to sub in too many low- or no-fat ingredients.  I'd say the same for going with regular cheddar instead of sharp.

This recipe was excellent.  I only used one egg like suggested and about 3 cups total of the cheese.  I really liked it, but the noodles were a little chewy and mushy after 5 hours, but very tasty.  If your looking for yummy comfort food, this is it.

I did not like this recipe.  I cooked it on low for the amount of time listed and it was not creamy at all.  In fact it was curtly.  It did have good flavor however.  If making this recipe keep an eye on it.  I think it should only be in the crock pot for 2-3 hours max.

We didn't care for this at all.  Like other reviewers, I only used one egg, beat in with the milk.  Also tried a variety of cheeses and did not precook the noodles.  I think it turned out like it was supposed to... we just didn't like the taste.

This is not as good as old-fashioned, start with a white sauce type mac & cheese.  BUT it sure is quick and tastes good.  I added some additional seasonings:  1 t. dry mustard and 1/2 t. paprika.

Easy recipe, fast and great for the kids! I  doubled it and put it in my 5 quart crockpot set on low for 5 hours.  It turned out great.  A little dark around the edges but some kids liked it like that.  So So easy with no fuss.

This recipe is good, but I was also disappointed that it was so eggy and somewhat bland. I also don't like the texture of melted cheddar cheese so I used colby and monterey jack, when are more smooth. It still had that curdled effect though because of the eggs. Next time I'll make it with only 1 egg and see what happens. Like other reviews here, I was hoping for something more creamy.

I was hoping for a more creamy mac n cheese recipe.  It tasted good and my children ate it just fine, but it was a bit dry.

I have been searching all over for a creamy mac and cheese recipe.  I am sorry to say this is NOT creamy, although it is still good (but not better than my own recipe to switch over). This recipie maybe be good for those who don't know how to make a white sauce since you just throw everything together in the crock pot.  It would be good for a covered dish get togehter too becasue the crock pot could keep it warm.  This is probably all I'll use this recipe for.  Thanks for the submission anyway.

I found this recipe to be very disappointing.  The cheese seperated and the eggs ended up like scramble eggs.  YUCK!  This was dumped downed the disposal!  Will not be making again!

I would cook it for a shorter period of time. Although the flavor was pretty good (next time I would add some paprika and garlic), it was a little mushy.

I agree with other reviewers that it is NOT the creamy type but the flavor was good, I cooked it only 2 hours and that was enough on low, and at that, it was done too much around the edges. I did NOT precook my noodles and they were fine. I will try it again and stir each half hour so it won't stick to edges--the pan was a mess to clean up so would suggest a liner. I used the ingredients as listed.

My whole family loves this recipe. I frequently double it because they arrive with expectations that I make enough for leftovers to take home. 

To make ahead, you can prepare the cheese, milk, egg mixture the night before. In the morning you just need to boil the macaroni, mix and cook. I've found cooking the macaroni in advance does not work as well - too sticky.

I didn't cook the macaroni ahead; I put it in dry.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  It smelled so good after 3-4 hours.  I should have taken the hint and stopped cooking it at that time.  I cooked it 5 hours on low and left it on warm another hour.  It was dry and rubbery.  Overcooked.  I would like to try it again and only cook it about 3 hours.

I leave out the eggs, and salt and pepper. Also changed the cheese using a mild one like mozzarella and sharp. It cooked on low for 2 hours and was ready! Very yummy!

Amazing!  Added the pasta uncooked as many suggested.  I also added chopped crispy chicken tenders and wing sauce for a little variety.  Cooked it for 2 hours on high.  It was delicious and gone!  Will make again.  Lots of requests for the recipe after our holiday luncheon yesterday.

I used the basic recipe and then added some leftover ground turkey that was seasoned for tacos, a can of chopped green chilis, and corn. It cooked in my 6 quart oval slowcooker and browned nicely around the edges. This made a meal that was ready when I got home from work. My whole family enjoyed it.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious both times I've made it! Followed recipe exactly the first time (did not stir, pre-cooked macaroni, followed all directions as written) and it came out perfectly. But since there is never such a thing as too much cheese, I added one cup of cubed Velveeta the second time, and it came out perfectly, again, but cheesier!

I received my first crock pot for Christmats and after an initial chicken tortilla soup, I was convinced that it was going to change my life.  Perhaps this over enthusiastic attitude has set undue expectations, but I thought this dish was very sub-par.  It looked like dog food and the flavor just wasn't there.  I'd stay away from this dish.

Not impressed with this recipe.  It was edible, but not something I will fix again.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The custardy texture was not a problem, the taste just wasn't that good.

I love this recipe!  I've made some changes to it that my family thinks make it really special.  Everyone who's had it asks for the recipe.  I substitute extra sharp cheddar for the sharp cheddar, add a small, finely diced onion, and substitute 1 cup of the cheddar with a block of bleu cheese.  I live at above 5000 ft. elevation, so the cook time given seems to work well here.

I left out the egg and didn't precook the macaroni and after two hours, set the Crockpot to warm for about thirty minutes.  The macaroni was already mush- and this was a double batch!  I will try this recipe again, but will only cook for about an hour and a half and check it.  It did taste good, but the mushy texture was difficult to get over.

My family loved this and have deemed this recipe "a keeper."  It was so easy and so good!  I added a small amount of butter (1 tsp.) because I was worried about sticking.  It didn't stick at all, but I don't know if it would have without the butter or not.

I'm looking for a really creamy sauce macaroni and cheese but that doesn't taste like the bright orange stuff - a more complex taste.  This wasn't it, but macaroni and cheese is always good :-)  If someone has another recipe suggestion - let me know!

I have made this a number of times and it always comes out good. I usually take it as a dish to pass at work. I put it together in the morning, plug it in at work and keep an eye on it. I've never been disappointed.

Very creamy macaroni recipe.  Everyone was surprised that the noodles cooked for that long in a slow cooker.  Did not dry out.  No burns here.  Family loved it!

The most that I can say about this recipe is that it almost tasted like the mac n'cheese that you can get from the box, but it was no where close the the appearance or consistency of that.. I was hoping for something creamier; instead, this turned out kind of chunky. With my CP, this was done after 5 hours. Sorry, it didn't taste bad, but I won't be making this again.

I tried this because I am craving homemade mac and cheese and I do not use the oven in the summer. This actually isn't that bad at all.  It wasn't as creamy as mine cooked in the oven, but it wasn't that bad either.  I did use 1 can of chedder cheese soup in the recipe, and 16 oz mac.  Next time I think I will cut back to 2 cups cheese and 2 cans soup.  All in all it is a decent recipe.  Thanks!

I was so excited to try this recipe seeing I love homemade mac & cheese and love using my crockpot. But this was a bit disappointing. I thought the noodles were very soggy. I had added garlic to this seeing I do that to almost all my recipes but it still didnt spice it up enough.

I was dissapointed in the way this turned out. After reading the reviews I was hoping for the best but that didn't happen with this recipe. It turned out lumpy and not anywhere near creamy at all. I doubled this for my 5-qt crockpot. I used cubed cheddar cheese and also added a pkg of cream cheese. My fiance tried stirring it and the wooden spoon broke! Maybe it was my fault for the way it turned out but I won't be making this again. We did salvage most of this by adding a lb of hamburger and some taco seasoning.

I love this recipe.  It was not flavorless at all like other reviews said.  I make it with 12 sharp cheddar cheese and 12 velveeta.  I find that 3-3 12 hours is plenty of time to cook this though.

I don't know if I did something wrong but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be! I know that a couple people took off the lid to look at it and that could be why it came out funny.....??????  I cooked it for 7 hours on low and it was completely burned on the bottom.  Make sure to use the cooking spray and my suggestion is to maybe add more cheese when putting this together!  Overall a good recipe and I will try making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Family really enjoyed this dish.  I appreciated the ease and carefree work to make it.  If you use the high setting a crust on the outer edges forms -- but be careful, it can burn on the high setting if left unattended.
