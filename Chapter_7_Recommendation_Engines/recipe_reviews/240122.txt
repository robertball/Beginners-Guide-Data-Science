This is a really good side dish recipe.  My family liked it a lot.  It was quick, easy, and all the ingredients are readily available in our pantry.  I wished I would have boiled the herbs a bit longer to soften the thyme a little more. But you're right Captain, there were no leftovers.  Served 6-8 people.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The potatoes were fluffy and the herbs didn't overwhelm my taste buds.

I needed something quick to take to a funeral. I had everything on hand & so easy & quick to put together. I did add crushed potato chips on the top, then sprinkled some cheese on top of that. I thought it might need a little texture . They were gone fast. Thank you for sharing. I personall perfer a recipe I have with fresh potatoes but the difference is not worth the time involved.

For someone that doesn't like instant mashed potatoes this turned out really well. My wife raved about these.
