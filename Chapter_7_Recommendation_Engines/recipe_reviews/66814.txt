EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!  It is so easy to make, that I had to check twice to see if I am missing something.  The process of mixing everything and wrapping it up in the spring roll wrappers took roughly 15 mins and then 5 mins to fry the batch.  The result was that the rolls were bursting with flavour.  I did make some changes to it though.  Due to the fact that I live in Japan and some ingredients are hard to find ( tamarind paste ), I simply added a thick red thai curry paste ( tsp. ) to the mixture.  Japan has a great abundance of seafood so the best crab is easy to find...most Japanese supermarkets usually steam the leftover live crabs if no one buys them throughout the day.  The flesh is removed from the shell and then presented in a nice tray for people to buy at the equivalent of $ 5 Canadian dollars.  Awesome recipe!  Will be making it again...and this time, I will try to find kaffir leaves to make a kaffir-lime sauce to accompany it.

This is such a great party appetizer, side dish or main dish item.  I am definitely keeping this in my recipe books bc it is so easy to whip up.  Some of the changes I added are : 1) If fresh crab is too expensive or unavailable, canned crab, mixed with shredded " imitation " crab ( usually made of fish ) can be used.  However, it is better to use fresh crab. 2) I added some finely minced green onions, to add some more flavour and variation to the colour of the mix. 3) For a different twist, you can add cayenne pepper ( to make it spicy and biting ).....or in my case, a teaspoon of Thai red curry paste for a very authentic taste.  If you do add Thai red curry paste, it would be wonderful to also add some minced fresh basil leaves to the mix.

The tamarind/sugar proportions do not permit the flavor of the crab to reach the palate.

We just did not care for this recipe.  Spring roll wrappers were too thing for the filling; an egg roll wrapper may have worked better.  The filling is too intense with solid crab.  Could have used infusion of veggies such as cabbage or carrots and the like.
