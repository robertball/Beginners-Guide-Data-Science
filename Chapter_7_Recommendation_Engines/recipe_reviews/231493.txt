With a few adjustments I love this recipe! I add diced onion and bell pepper for extra flavor, double the vinegar, and had a healthy amount of Worcester sauce. After everything has simmered together in mix in a few cups of rice instead of pasta. This has become one of mine and my husband's favorites! Plus, it's simple, quick, and easy to customize. Thanks for sharing!

My star rating is based on making the recipe as stated. I tasted it and had several members of my household taste it and while we found it good, it lacked something. It became a four, almost a five, after I added some salt, a bit more soy sauce and some sesame oil. Instead of rice, I used orzo pasta and mixed into the mixture. The children really enjoyed it and with my additions, I would make this again. Thank you for a great new ground beef recipe!

I left out the honey and added about a tablespoon of curry powder and a tablespoon of worcestershire. Which probably covered up some of the other tastes, but it was REALLY good.

Very simple and yummy. I added a little Indian curry seasoning and used cider vinegar and raw honey. We mixed with rice and put in flour tortillas. Yum!

Great when you are looking for something different to do with ground beef. Comments around the table were... It's good.  Tastes fine/ok.  You can make this again. There were no leftovers :)

I expected this to be ok at best, but I had all the ingredients and it seemed simple so I tried it. Boy was I surprised!!!  This is delicious!!!!  It has made its way into my regular rotation. My husband and I both love it!  We have had it on rice, in a taco shell, in a soft taco shell and over gemelli pasta with olive oil and Parmesan.  It is delicious any of these ways!!!  Try this recipe!  You will be pleasantly surprised!

I wanted something different the other evening and decided to try this dish because I had the ingredients in the house. It's different - when cooking, I was afraid the mustard would overpower the dish, but it cooked out well. I think it is important to make the recipe as written first to publish a good review. It offers a unique flavor, but agree with others (it offers zing from the mustard), but I'd like to see more heat/spice to it.

I generally only try recipes with over 25 ratings with average of 4 - 5 stars.  That said, I was in a pinch for dinner and I had a pound of ground beef so thought I'd be brave and try this one.  I did add a bit more soy sauce and some salt, plus I added a bit more honey.  The flavor is...different...I don't know how else to describe it.  Even "doctored" up I thought it was just okay.  

I put it over orzo.  

Will not be adding to my recipe box.

I made it with everything but the garlic (simple because I forgot) and I LOVED it. It was super easy to make and had powerful flavors. I did add seasoning the ground beef when I cooked it and it did not overpower, but rather added to the flavors. We add it sloppy joe style, but next time I will be trying it over rice.

I made it almost exact to the recipe because I had all the ingredients at my boyfriends house in a last minute pinch to cook dethawed ground beef. Only exception was paprika so I used curry powder and chilli powder as a substitute. Used butter and salt to brown the beef, mix in and served on top of those Knorr sides 7 min alfredo pasta. Literally took less than 15 minutes to cook this dinner and it was good. His friend liked it to and that man is a picky eater than never eats at home and only will eat out. The beef Is a diff taste but it's good. 4 stars for ease and taste.

Tasty as written. Served over mashed potatoes.  If peas and carrots added it could be an upside down cottage pie.

I had a bag of frozen rice and vegetables that I didn't care for by itself. I was hoping this would be a good combination, but not so much.

I wanted to double this recipe and used a mix of 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey. I added in some diced onion with the meat. I was concerned my 9 year old wouldnâ€™t want to try it if it had too much mustard, so I didnâ€™t fully double the mustard - I used about 2/3 or 3/4? of a cup. I used everything the recipe called for and doubled most of the amounts. I also added a about a teaspoon or so of salt. Served it with pasta and loved it! We like spicy food, so we also enjoyed it with a little bit of Sriracha sauce on top. Then I tried it with mango habanero sauce and that was good, too! This is a keeper.

Delicious!  I used dijon mustard as I didn't have yellow, and rolled it up in tortillas.  I think shredded cheese would've been a good addition.

Taking the advice of some other reviewers I tweaked the recipe by using 2 tsp honey, 2 tsp soy sauce, 1tsp sesame oil, 1tbsp Worcestershire sauce, and 1.5 tsp onion powder. I also added 1 cup of green beans and 1 cup corn to the meat, then mixed in cooked pearl couscous. It was absolutely delicious! Everyone got second and third helpings! I will definitely be making it again.

This was wayyyyy better than I thought it was going to be.  I put in a tbsp of honey, doubled the balsamic and soy sauce, and it was delicious.  My husband, the pickiest eater ever, loved it!  I combined the liquids while I was frying the beef, and when I tasted it, I wasnâ€™t crazy about the taste. The mustard was really strong.  But it all melts together fantastically when it cooks and just has a really great honey mustard taste.  I served it on spaghetti and drizzled chilli oil on top...fantastic!

Quick and easy with an interesting flavor. A good way to cook ground  beef to serve with your choices of rice, noodles or vegetables. I had left over mac and cheese (old fashioned made) and it went great over it with a side salad. will make again.

Interesting...but nothing spectacular. Additions/subs were: Made with ground turkey, brown mustard, Worcestershire sauce, diced onion, carrots/peas sesame sauce and no yolk wheat egg noodles tossed in sesame oil. A little more soy sauce and additional salt definitely made it better. All other ingredients were used the same and I am glad I tried it, but since I liked it more than the husband I probably wonâ€™t make again.

It was really good! I thought all of those things together would be disgusting but they weren't. I added green beans and corn to the mix.

I had some hamburger that had to get cooked and so I found this. I already had some rice made and it was quite tasty.  I did not have balsamic vinaigrette, so I used red wine vinegar, it was a good substitute.  I think onion would have been a perfect addition.

it was a bit to sweet for me so to counter the sweetness of it i added another 1/8 tsp black pepper bringing it up to 1/4 tsp and topped it with Parmesan cheese it was really good after I made those changes then I used it to top some gluten free macaroni noodles I gave this 4 stars because it is a good recipe and needed only very minor changes to fit my taste and we know that taste changes from person to person so enjoy and find your right balance with this recipe

I was surprised with the flavor.  The mustard cooked out to be mild.  Served it over rice...  I think it would do well for a sandwich or over pasta..  I added garlic, peppers, and onions..   I enjoyed the different flavor.

I made this for myself and my 6 year old son tonight, loved it!!! Made as written I put it over some "Wacky Mac", my son's favorite pasta, he had 3 helpings. All ingredients I had on hand easy, low cost, and delicious. I will defiantly make it again!!

5 stars for easy, quick and use of  on-hand ingredients. 3 stars for taste. Equals 4 stars!  I served it over bowtie pasta and added frozen green peas. Not very exciting but I would make it again  if in a pinch.

This was actually very tasty. Love may be a strong word but it was more than like. I did use a different mustard since we only use brown mustard. I imagine with yellow the mustard flavor would be very strong. I think you need to like mustard though since it is very noticeable flavor. I put it over rice and the family enjoyed it.

So so so good! And so easy to make! My picky family just loved it- even my teenage daughter who "doesn't like meat" went back for seconds! I served it with brown rice and it was perfect. I did take other ideas and added 1tsp sesame oil, used 2tsp soy sauce and 2tsp honey. I didn't use Whorstershaire sauce as others did because I think that would change the flavor. It was great and I made very minor changes

Added more soy sauce and seasoning salt. Served over leftover spaghetti. My son said it's the best meat he's ever tasted. Well make again.

This was an interesting dish.  We liked it, even my pickiest eater said it was ok - which is generous from him.  I added vegetable broth to create a juice.  Beef would probably be better.  Served over brown rice.

This was pretty good. I loved the simple Mediterranean flare! I took the advice of others and added a tsp of Worstershire, and a few shakes of curry. I forgot to add the honey, but had added a tbsp of sesame oil to the mustard mix. It was good, but just a tad dry. My husband thought it would be better if it was made in to a gravy. Any how, it was quick, easy, different and will make again! Next time maybe some chopped onion, and corn or chopped apple instead.

It wasn't my favorite, but I'd make it again. All I tasted was mustard. I think some cinnamon might help.

Will do it again, thought that Dijon mustard will be overwhelming at 1/4 cup so I halved it, next time I'll do the 1/4 cup since it was not all that prominent.  Should cut back on the garlic though.  Also I started it with an onion, sauteed in olive oil.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently is that I used white vinegar, and added onions, bell pepper, and celery to the mixture. I did not use the honey, because I do not like my food sweetened. I added a little seasoning also. We ate the mixture on crackers and bread like Sloppy Joes.
