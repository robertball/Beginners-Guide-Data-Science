Overall, a very tasty and tender butter cookie.  Also, because of so few ingredients, it is quick to mix.  The dough was a little difficult to work with -- so I cheated and rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper, set it on a cookie sheet, froze it for about 20 minutes, then cut out the frozen dough.  (I do this with almost all cut out cookie dough. It works great and the cookies don't lose their shape!)  Since I used small cutters, I reduced the baking time to 10 minutes.

Nice texture and taste.  I found the dough, in the original recipe a bit too crumbly.  With an extra Tablespoon of milk and an extra 1/4 cup of butter, it was perfect!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Jelly.  I'll be making this one for every cut-out cookie holiday, and maybe some in between!

these were so odd ... as others have noted, not sweet but strangely addicting. i added some almond extract, which i think helped the flavor. my husband ate them up, and the man is not a sweet-eater, so there's that. i would definitely chill the dough before rolling it out.

These are good and SO easy! If you use a stand mixer, you won't have to knead, and if you roll it out and bake it on parchment, there's almost no mess! We loved them with Sugar Cookie Icing on this site. Professional-looking results!

THANK YOU, JELLY!!!!!
This really is the best cut-out recipe on the planet!!  I have tried countless recipes for dough you don't have to refrigerate first.  These are great!!!!!
I put the dough on parchment paper, put plastic wrap on top of the dough and then roll, so no need for extra flour.
THANKS AGAIN!!

If you are looking for a delicately tastey, white, soft but yet crisp, cut-out then this is for you. I was hoping for more cake-like cookies so this is not for me. Dough was easy to work w/ even w/out chilling. GREAT FOR USE WITH KIDS!!-no raw eggs so its a tastey and safe dough to eat :)
A nice cookie!

By far, the best cut-out cookies I've ever made. I've been using this recipe for 3 years now and everyone who tastes them agrees that they are, indeed, the best tasting cookies. My only suggestion is that you bake the cookies a bit longer than 12 minutes, especially if you're making them thicker. Also, suggest using parchment paper to bake on.

I made these last year for Valentine's day.  They send very well.  I cut out a lot of large hearts, then half of them I cut out a small heart from the middle of each heart, so I had sandwiches, with windows in the top half.  I added almond extract to the batter - and this was an awesome addition.  Added a drop of red food coloring to the icing and that gave me pink icing for Valentine's day!!!  My boyfriend was really excited, commented on how good the icing was.  Great great gift, or mailed care package item!

These cookies are great!  I am a novice baker/ cook, but this recipe was easy to follow.  The dough was very easy to handle (I love that it doesnt need to be chilled).  I will definitely make these again and again!

Great cookie, but I'm giving it only 4 stars as others are correct that the "dough" was nothing but crumbs until I added an additional 1Tbsp of milk (mixed in my KitchenAid Mixer).  Based on the other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp. Almond Extract to the dough.  Also, cooking time was about 15 minutes. for a nice, light cookie.  Extremely easy to roll out and cut; I'll be making these again!

Didn't care much for this cookie. Bland taste and I followed the recipe as written. I won't make these again, its not a sugar cookie, not a butter cookie, something in between. Needs a flavor boost for sure.

Excellent recipe just as it is. I made no changes and it was perfect. This cookie is more like a short bread than a sugar cook which I prefer because it's buttery and not sicky sweet. The cookie does stay white and makes the decorations on top look professional. I will use this recipe for all of my holiday and special occasion cut out cookies.

These are wonderful cookies that are so simple to fix.  I can have a batch made and be all cleaned up in an hour!  They are similar to a shortbread cookie and taste great plain or with the sugar cookie icing several have recommended (available on this site).  It doesn't make a ton of cookies - about 2-3 dozen, which is fine, because I seem to be the only one in my family who likes them!  One hint:  they don't spread when baking, so you can put them pretty close together and get more out of a batch.  Mine were perfect after 12 minutes.  Thanks!

I personally didn't like this recipe mostly because I was looking for a traditional sugar cookie recipe.  this was more of a shortbread and I found there wasn't enough taste to the cookie.  On the other hand, it was easy to mix up and rolled out quite easily after it was chilled for an hour or so.

Extremely crumbly dough that is very difficult to work with.  If you have the patience to deal with the dough, it is a very tasty cookie.

This is my absolute favorite cut out cookie recipe! I use it for every holiday. It's simple, doesn't need chilling and holds it shape well. The only change I made is I added more vanilla, but I do that with any butter or sugar cookie recipe. I usually frost with a simple thin frosting made with powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. Perfect.

These were the best cut out cookies I have ever made.  I have tried to make sugar cookies several times and it seems like you always have to fight with the dough.  This dough was so easy to handle.  I love that they come out practicly white so they can be decorated any way you want.  My 4yr old and I made heart cookies for Valentine's Day and we used the powdered sugar icing to decorate they came out wonderful.  His Pre-k teacher asked if I would make a couple dozen undecorated for the kids to decorate and all the kids loved them.  I will definately keep this recipe and use this recipe any time I want to make cut out cookies.  Thanks Jelly for sharing a great recipe.

This is an excellent cookie to make with your kids for sure! No eggs, so they can play with the dough and eat it while cutting it out! My 2yr old son and I just got done making these! I halved the recipe, seeing as it was just for fun and the 2 of us, and they are really somehow addicting! haha! Thank you for sharing, will definitely be making again!

The best cut out cookie I've tasted.  The dough would be easier to cut out if it's chilled, but not necessary if you're in a hurry.  I will make this often!

This recipe turned out great!! Thanks for sharing.  I pressed the cutouts in colored sugar before baking.  They turned out beautiful and tasted great. Couple of things... definitely sift the flour and sugar, and I would suggest chilling the dough for about an hour before rolling/cutting.

We've made these 2 times to give them a fair rating & they were still AWFUL!!!! I couldn't give it a zero so it got a 1. There was NO flavor/taste. I did use almond hoping for something, but still AWFUL. I'll stick with my sugar cookie recipe from now on.

These cookies turned out beautifully. I whipped the butter in my standing mixer, added the rest of ingredients to mixer (used light cream, had no milk), they were perfect texture to roll between parchment sheets. I baked them on parchment, ground red sprinkles with a tsp of confectioner's sugar, sprinkled over and baked as directed.  I used a small heart cookie cutter and ended up with 60 perfect cookies.  Nice recipe, I"ll make again

Made these for Valentines Day...they were so delicious!  More of a shortbread cookie than a sugar cookie, but the were so tender and good.  I sprinkled some with pink sprinkles and dipped some halfway in melted dark chocolate.  Very, very good.

Loved this recipe.  Followed it as instructed and I did not have any problems.  It is important to use dry ingredients that have been sifted and then measured as oppossed to measuring first and then sifting.  This is a crisp and not sugary sweet cookie making it ideal for frosting or sugar sprinkled.

Thanks for a terrific recipe, what a light and tender cookie, I used both vanilla and lemon flavoring, topped some with sanding sugar prior to baking, iced others with milk, confec sugar and lemon ext glaze.  They are delicious and are great frozen too.  Dough comes together excellent, great recommendation to freeze prior to cutting, results were perfect, loved by all!

I have made these cookies several times within the last year for holidays.  Just made them last week for Halloween in a pumpkin shape.  I find them to be light and delicious and so do my small children and my husband.  We usually decorate them for the holidays with a simple confectioners sugar glaze but my husband would eat them all plain if I let him.  I always double the pure vanilla, maybe this is why we love the taste?  In any case, I use my Kitchen Aide mixer which makes it so easy to whip up a batch.  If you have time, you can chill the dough for some time but it's not necessary. I try to use very little flour for rolling them out so if you find the dough very sticky, you can roll it out between either 2 pieces of plastic wrap or wax paper.  This is a staple cookie recipe in my house. Thank you for sharing it.

Great recipes the dough is really easy to roll out. It doesn't even need to be refrigerated first! I added some cardamom, it was delicious.

Excellent cookies! I'm a beginner baker, so I had a lot of trouble working the dough, until I pulled a trick I learned from Alton Brown and put a cookie sheet in the freezer and then rested it on the dough after rolling so it soaked up the cold and was better to work with. Also, I rolled with powdered sugar, no toughened cookies and it didn't make the cookies too sweet. Delicious! I can't keep my hands off of them!

These weren't as good as I expected. The dough was very crumbly & hard to work with. They are good, but not as simple as it sounds.

I love this recipe.  I used my food processor to mix it up and then froze the dough for later use.  There was no difference in texture or taste and it was very easy to roll out.  I used parchment paper upon baking and glazed it with a confectioner sugar recipe.  Perfect!  Definite keeper.

Is it possible there is an ingredient missing?  I made 3 batches of these and they were too dry and crumbly to roll.. had to add liquid.  
Not very tasty... dry and cardboard-like.
very disappointing.

Easy & tasty!  Good basis for sugar cookie - not too overly sweet...However, the dough was very crumbly and difficult to form into a ball for chilling to prepare for easier rolling out.  Also, the amount of dough seemed to be rather small so I did the following:  Added 4 tablespoons milk, 1 egg, (thought it was odd that there were no eggs in this cookie recipe) and 1/2 cup flour.  This did the trick.  Dough was easier to roll into a ball for chilling.  Also, I used "Sugar Cookie Icing" by Gigi found here...Big hit with Hubby.  YUMMY!

Awesome!!!  I chilled the dough for a few minutes, then rolled it out between 2 pieces of waxed paper.  That way the dough was very easy to work with and my little daughter could help without getting messy.  The taste was amazing.  These were gobbled up in minutes at my daughter's Valentine's Day party!  Will use this recipe for cut out cookies from now on!!

I have read most of the reviews of this recipe and I have no complaints about this recipe at all.  I have never found a recipe  (that comes together and doesn't crumble)  as good as this one.  I think it tastes great and it was easy to make.  I will definately be making this recipe again.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a pretty easy recipe, I was amazed how fast I was done, including the baking, but it seems to me 12 min is not enough time. 
Actually, I think they are O.K, I wouldn't say they are really tasty, but they are acceptable...

I liked the look of these cookies so decided to give them a try.  I followed recipe to a science but the dough was VERY flakey so I added in one EXTRA tablespoon of milk.  Made a difference in rolling these out.  The fun part was decorating them. Along with a simple butter cream frosting,  I used dragees and edible pink and silver glitter.  Very good cut out cookie recipe.

These are such great cookies for kids to make since they don't have egg in them.  You can snack on the cookie dough to your hearts content.  My husband especially enjoyed these and he is picky when it comes to cookies.  My 1 yr old loved the ones in a car shape and his friends really liked the valentine shaped ones.  Next time I'll try icing instead of sprinkles.

These were so easy and tasted so good.  I they are great if you need to cut specific shapes.  I used it to make rays of sun coming of a cake a did by free hand cutting the dough with a knife to create various shapes, it turned out great!  I iced them and my guest goobled them up faster than the cake.  I have had many request to make them and pass the recipe around.  They almost taste like a short bread cookie to me.  Anyway they were crunchier than I like cookies to be but I think I over cooked them a tad, but regardless they tasted great just like that.  If I weren't out of powdered sugar I would be making some right now.

i made these on valentine's day.  they turned out perfectly, though the dough was too dry to roll out, i had to add a little extra milk.  it's a very good shortbread type of cookie.  i used my homemade buttercream frosting on these, with red sugar sprinkled on top.  i'll definitely make them again.

Thank you Jelly! I used a different shortbread cookie at Christmas time, and boy do I regret it now. This is THE shortbread recipe. The cookies come out tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious every time. It makes a smallish batch so you don't have to set aside a whole day to make them. I have made this recipe four time in the past few days and am mailing the cookies to friends for Valentine's Day. These are fabulous!!

These were good and, as others have said, very easy to work with.  My four year old daughter loved cutting out and rolling the dough.  We frosted with "Sugar Cookie Frosting," also on this site.  A great time was had by all.  I liked, but didn't LOVE, the taste.  The family ate them all up, however.  (And I helped.)

Perfect!! Very easy to roll out so the little ones can help. I doubled it and rolled it on parchment paper. They taste like shortbread - which I love and so do my kids (3 & 7). Thanks so much!

Very easy and delicious. I cut holes in 1/2 of the heart shaped cookies so when they were done baking I could spread raspberry jam on a whole cookie and put a cookie with a hole in it on top for a pretty valentine sandwich cookie. I served them to our guests on the side of a bowl of ice cream. Very pretty and YUMMY!

This recipe was just perfect for what we needed -- fast and simple enough for my 3 year old to help - a lot!  They are the most delicious shortbread cookie I have ever tasted, and baked beautifully. Sure to become a family classic.

By far the best cutout cookie recipe ever!  The cookies don't change shape
at all!  They have a long shelf-life and are very similar to traditional 
shortbread cookies, but are much more stable and tender!  I'll be making
these a LOT!

These turned out perfect! I misread the recipe and almost used only 1/2 c. butter (1 stick) instead of 1/2 lb. (2 sticks), but thankfully I caught my mistake in time to fix it. The dough was just the right consistency for rollng, not too dry and not too wet. Based on other reviews, I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper so I didn't have to add any flour and then put the rolled out dough in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes so it was firm and ready to cut with the cookie cutters. After cutting, I baked them on a piece of parchment paper on top of a cookie sheet. I had rolled some at 1/4" thick as suggested and they came out on the softer side of firm. Others I rolled between 1/8" & 3/16" and they were on the crisper side of firm after the 12 minutes. All of them tasted great though!

I decorate my cookies with confectioners sugar and milk frosting so there is no need to have a very sweet cookie and I like it best this way. I always struggle to find the right cookie for cutouts because I am definitely NOT a baker. This was good but took some tinkering because I tried to use my mixer for kneading but it was really dry and floury... I added another stick of butter and it did the trick. These are good, I just not as crispy as I like.

These are not what I expected. To me they had no flavor and were a playdoh texture. I don't think I would serve these to anyone or to family. I may make them once or twice again if in need of a butter cookie, but to me this did not cut it.

These cookies are the best! The dough is quick to make, easy to roll out, no chilling needed, and they taste great! I have been making this recipe for about 13 years now. For Valentine's day I make the heart cutouts with raspberry or strawberry jam and for Christmas I frost them with a peppermint flavored icing. This has become my go-to recipe when I know I need something good!

This is the perfect no-egg "sugar cookie" recipe!  It's a little like a shortbread cookie, but just the right amount of sweet. It works VERY well with cookie cutters (doesn't spread out or puff up too much).  My little ones love them and my husband thinks they're not bad for a cookie without chocolate chips!

I really liked these cookies. The taste isn't overly sweet and that's good because the frosting I used is super sweet so these were perfect. 
I can't bake at all...especially roll out cookies and to my suprise I had no problems with this recipe. The dough came out perfect and rolled out easy. I did chill it for just a few minutes in the freezer but I probably didn't have to. I will be using this recipe from now on for all my cut out cookie baking needs. Thanks so much :)

Loved it!  Easy to do, roll and bake.  Cookies came out thin, crispy...melts in your mouth.

I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract as well.  Really adds a nice flavor and aroma too.  Cooked cookies for 14min instead of 12.

Not very sweet, but excellent texture and appearance. The perfect sugar cookies for icing and decorations. These also roll out beautifully and do not stick, which is a major bonus when baking with children.

These cokies turned out nice and soft, but I felt they were a little lacking in flavor.  The dough was too dry to form a ball and so I had to double the liquid.  I added lemon juice as well for a little flavor.  With those small changes, the cookies turned out yummy.  I also found the recipe very simple, which is a bonus when you are making them with 5 little children!

I never post reviews, but this one I had to! these are the absolute best butter/shortbread cookies in the world! The dough is so easy to work with (I did follow the advoce of previous reviews and increase the butter by 1/4 cup and I added a Tablespoon vanilla). I used the sugar cookie icing recipe from this site and the finished productslook and taste just like they came from an expensive bakery! This is my new cut out cookie recipe for sure! Thank you!!

Pretty ok.
   It was very simple and straightforward to make.  It wasn't super tasty, but i guess it was alright as far as basic sugar cookies go.

Very good cookies! I made heart shaped ones and used the "sugar cookie glaze" from this site. I did refridgerate the dough, and then worked with my hands to avoid using too much flour.

I never wright reviews..but this was my first time making a sugar cut out cookie and I was so impressed. It was so easy. Took the advice and put parchment on the bottom and saran wrap on the top. I am letting them cool and then going to dip in chocolate. YUM. THANK YOU. I will be using this recipe all year around.

These were delicious! IT was such a nice change from the average sugar cookie. I only baked them for 8-10 minutes because I wanted a softer cookie. I topped these with cream cheese frosting. These will become a Valentine tradition!!

We made these for a girls club at church, and we needed at least 24. I had to make double batches because they kept disappearing. Had only vanilla, but they came out great!

A very simple and tasty cookie.  I added the zest from one lemon right into the butter mixture before adding the flour and sugar, and I iced the cookies with a cream cheese butter frosting.  The lemon adds a delicate depth of flavor.  Will definitely hold onto this easy recipe!

As others mentioned, easy and quick to work with. I have four children and these are perfect for classroom occasions and such. Not too sweet so you don't have to worry what icing you choose, and it's easy to add your prefered flavour. I'll be using this one again!

This recipes was VERY easy to do.  The dough was very easy to work with.  Like others stated, not much flavor.  I even added almond extract as well as vanilla.  Maybe some orange or lemon zest next time.  Will keep recipe for future because it's very fast & easy, but will need to modified for additional flavor.

Really easy.  I whipped up a half-batch in about 45 minutes, start-to-finish.  Not super-sweet like a sugar cookie, more like a rolled shortbread cookie.  I dipped mine in ganache - excellent!

These cookies were very easy to make and taste really yummy!!  I made letter cut-out cookies for my daughter's first day of kindergarten.  My family devoured the remaining cookies after letters A-Z!  A word of caution though - the cookies are nice and hard, like shortbread, and will break very easily when dropped (my daughter dropped the box of cookies and almost every cookie broke -- ugh! :( )  Her class still ate every single one of them though!!

This is by far the easiest cutout cookie dough to work with that I have ever tried.  No chilling required and the dough is not sticky at all.  They tasted good too.  Will use this one alot in the future.

Really good!  I followed some tips given by others and they came out PERFECT!  I made mine 1/3 inch thick, so I had to triple the recipe just to get 30 large (3 inches wide) heart-shaped cookies.  Thank you!  These ARE great with coffee!

These are much more of a shortbread than a sugar cookie - not sweet, and the dough is drier.  Just okay for me - I prefer a traditional sweet sugar cookie.

Wonderful cookies! The dough has a nice texture, no refrigeration is needed and it rolls out beautifully. My daughter and I made heart cookies using this recipe. We love shortbread cookies and these turned out quite nicely, dressed up with a little icing and edible pink glitter. We'll be making these again!

A delicious cookie, and what a nice alternative to the basic sugar cookie dough.  I doubled the recipe for today and made them in july for use with my favorit glaze.  They were incredible and people kept telling me how much they loved them.  I will definately keep this recipe.  It's so much neater than most dough.

Very good cookie--the best I've made yet for cut outs.  Light and sweet taste--velvetly texture. Next time I'd add an extra tbs. of milk to help with the kneading of the dough--otherwise a great recipie.  Make sure you have icing or sprinkles to decorate the cookies with, they are very plain when cooked.

I followed the recipe exactly and the batter was way too dry. I have to add 4 tablespoons more milk to make the dough form. Otherwise the cookies were so easy and turned out great.

For me it was insanely dry (hadn’t to read the recipe 5 times to make sure I wasn’t missing some major liquid ingredient) but I added small amount of butter and smaller amount of water to reach desired consistency.

Ok, not great.  Directions could be clearer.  I used my mixer to blend in the flour, sugar, etc. as it would be very difficult to knead otherwise.  I agree with other reviewers - it is not really a butter cookie, not really a sugar cookie.  I might make it again, but probably not.

Best cutout cookie recipe! I needed one without eggs, bc my son is allergic. I made his preschool class pumpkin cookies to decorate at their Halloween party. We'll be using this for Christmas, too!  Delicious!

Okay cookies.  Nice because it's not overly sweet, but not a whole lot of flavor either.  Good dough for rolling and cutting out; great for kids to decorate.  We still ate them all though :) Did not refrigerate the dough and worked fine with extra tbsp of milk, although it seemed super crumbly at first

Pretty easy to make. The Dow can be kind of dry so it is a little bit of a pain to get spread out to cut. Other than that, great recipe!

Addictive!  These taste like shortbread.  Made these with my daughter for her class valentines party and we had never made rolled cookies before.  Reminds me of working with pie dough because you have to play a bit with the ratio of milk to flour to get the right consistency of dough.  If you roll out on parchment and take the "scraps" off and bake the cookies on the parchment paper then it is a bit more forgiving if your dough is a little too sticky at first.They turned out beautifully.

Nice, plain cookie and easy to work with. I'd try this one again with something other that the "Sugar Cookie Icing" I used and didn't like.

These cookies were so good! The whole family loved them. As other reviewers said they were kinda bland, but as a simple valentines cookie they were great for us. To make them a little sweeter, I mixed red food coloring with sugar and generously sprinkled on top of the cookies, but icing would work well, too. If they are crumbly, just keep mixing! I thought mine were too dry, but after another minute or so of mixing (I used an electrical mixer) the dough was perfect for cut-out cookies. The confectioner's sugar is what really makes these cookies different from any others I have made. Thanks for a fast, easy, awesome recipe Jelly!

I have no clue how to cook or bake! I made these and I think they turned out pretty darn well! I also added more vanilla. Received a lot of compliments:-)

Great!  I chilled my dough a bit and they were so easy to make.  Also piled on the colored sugar before baking!  If you're looking for a sweet tasting cookie, I'd recommend using icing on these.  My husband calls them the perfect coffee cookie.  A keeper for me!

These are great cookies.  I always use this recipe when I make sugar cookies and I always get lots of compliments. Since the cookies aren't very sweet they taste great with icing.

My daughter is allergic to egg and loves to bake with me.  This is the first sugar cookie  recipe that actually tastes great and is like a normal sugar cookie!  We love it!  We had to refridgerate the dough for about 1/2 hr and baked the cookies for less time.

I wasnt so sure about these cookies at first, the more I eat the less I want to stop eating them! 
I cut the dough into heart shapes and decorated with sprinkles.
If you have a big sweet tooth these would probably be best with frosting.
I just love the fact that these have no egg!

These cookies were absolutely fabulous.  I baked them for the first time for valentines day and iced them with a store bought buttercream ising and topped them each off with a cinnamon heart.  My 4 year old took them to pre-k and his other school and they were GONE!  Because they were such a hit, I'm going to make more but for the school fundraiser bake sale.  GREAT RECIPE

Based on all of wonderful reviews, I was hoping for an extraordinary cookie, but they are really quite ordinary.
Yes, it was easy and rolled out well, but this is just a recipe for a flaky shortbread cookie.
