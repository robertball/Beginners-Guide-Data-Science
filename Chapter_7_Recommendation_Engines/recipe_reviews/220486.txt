This is one of my most favorite ways to make mashed potatoes. I like to add a little sauteed fresh minced garlic, too. Whenever I make this, there's NEVER any leftovers. NOTE: This is a great base for colcannon, too. Just steam your cabbage and cook your bacon to a crisp and crumble, then fold the cabbage and bacon in. It's seriously heavenly.

I don't know what it is that makes it so, but there's something about taking relatively ordinary mashed potatoes and baking them that transforms them into something extraordinary.  Hubs said this is remiminscent of what you'd you'd get in fine restaurants.  Since I was making this for just the two of us I piped the potatoes with a large open star tip into 6 oz. ramekins which made this elegant as well as delicious.

Absolutely disgracefully delicious. In a pathetic attempt to make it less horrible for you, I halve the amount of cream cheese. This then allows me to justify sprinkling a couple of handfuls of grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese on top. Plan on making it this Thanksgiving as it will HORRIFY my health-conscious MIL. Heh!

VERY delicious. I didn't change anything. My husband is a huge potato loving guy and loved it. I did cover the casserole for the first 20 min and took the cover off for the remaining 10 min. my oven tends to over bake and I didn't want it to be dried out. I served it with corned beef instead of the usual boiled potatoes. Will be a new tradition.

5 stars are not nearly enough for this recipe. Cooked this recipe exactly as stated like I always do. This recipe was simple, perfect and easy. People couldn't beileve it didn't take a long time to make. I had planned on taking some leftovers for lunch; however, there weren't any. Made this dish with Chef John's meatloaf and mushroom gravy. Talk about an absolutely perfect and satisfying meal. Thanks BAWHITE1. I will definitely be making these again. I am a potato fiend and these really hit the spot.

This is one of our favorite potato recipes.  I've even made it using instant potatoes and it came out good.  Also I like to mix the chives into the mashed potatoes rather than on top.

These mashed potatoes are so delicious!!!  I just made it in preparation for our St Patrick's Day family feast.  I had to put some aside to have for dinner tonight!  The only minor change is that I cook my potatoes in salted water with garlic and some chicken broth (or I use bouillon cube if I don't have stock handy).  I plan to add some crumbled bacon on top for the meat lovers.

Awesome casserole.  I made this last night and baked it today for Easter dinner.  We always have potato casserole with hashbrowns and cream of chicken soup... you all know which one I'm talking about.  I thought I'd try something different this year and I'm so glad I did.  This rocked and everyone said they want this casserole from now on!!  Only change I made was adding 1/4 cup crumbled bacon!

The cream cheese was overpowering. It tasted like potatoes mixed with cream cheese. I won't be making this again.

Riced the potatoes after baking them first.  Faster prep for the potatoes, no extra moisture from boiling.  No need to whip potatoes when you rice them.

I have not tried this as of yet [I know...you're saying how can you rate it 5 star!] but feel I have stumbled upon a gem! Can't wait to try. I've read ALL the reviews and even the ones that are critical are helpful(was looking to see if anyone subbed plain yogurt for sour cream...no luck).  I plan to half the cream cheese ...or use ff cc(I feel guilty if I don't try to make it a little health conscious...)and to use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. Can't wait to try and come back and update this post!!

I made these last night to take to a pot luck today.  They were like soup!  I had to go to the store and buy double the potatoes I'd already cooked last night.  Still way to runny.  Flavor nothing special.

Very good & easy to make.  I made exactly as the recipe stated, and then just added shredded cheese on top before baking.  This would be nice to bring to a potluck.

I don't cook much, but I made this for Thanksgiving, and my family absolutely LOVED it! My sister said I should bring this for all our family feasts. If you just follow the directions, you'll have a great potato dish.

So good!  Will def make this again.  I used more potatoes, less cream cheese, but I don't think it matters - its a great recipe on its own or as a base for all sorts of things (think bacon, cheese, onions etc. )

Made it for our office St. Patrick's Day potluck and it was a HIT!!!  I used 12 potatoes vs 8 and didn't increase most of the other ingredients -- except the sour cream for  moisture.  I mixed the chives throughout the potatoes and sprinkled some extra on top with the paprika.  It was the only dish on table that was scraped clean!!

this dish was amazing! it was very creamy and was about as easy as making any homemade mashed potatoes. the only difference I made was I topped it with about 2 cups of shredded cheese. but my family loves a lot of cheese. this would have been good with our without the shredded cheese.

These are the only mashed potatoes my husband will eat. He insists that all mashed potatoes need gravy, until he tried these. I made no changes and will be making this again.

This is my first time making this dish and it came out so delicious... I didn't change a thing, the only thing I didn't do was mash the potatoes, I left them a little clumpy like a potato salad giving it texture. I wouldn't change a thing

There was way too much cream cheese & the overall consistency was too thick.

Made it for Easter - everyone like it.  I think next time I make it I will add some seasoning such as garlic salt or something to punch up the flavor, but so nice to have a mashed potato dish you can make ahead.  Used my crock pot that has a stoneware insert that can go into the oven, worked so nice for transporting and serving at a buffet meal.
