when i mixed this recipe it seemed too dry.more like biscuit mix. i used: 2c self rise  1 pint ic 1/3 c milk this made the dough more like a cake. as for axtras i added some of those big soft sprinkles and it turned the cupcakes into a party! fun!  warning: these taste kinda like biscuit/scone more than cupcake but if you dont like things super sweet they are awesome! definatelly using these next time i make strawberry shortcake!

Only 2 ingredients.. this is amazing! I've made these muffins exactly as the recipe says 3 times, and every time they turn out perfectly.. perfectly browned and crunchy on the outside, and very moist on the inside. They're great when you want a really good plain muffin without the sweetness of other muffins.

Really cool! Absolutely scrumptious, except for one problem: too hard to make. It took me so long to get this right. I would only suggest trying this recipe if you're professional.

Hmm.  I'm not sure about these. They are only 2 ingredients (well, if u have self rising flour; of course I didn't.  The sub is 1 1/2 tspns baking powder & 1/2 tspn salt per 1 cup of flour.)so I have no intention of being too critical.  They did remind me of scones in appearance although not in taste (& there is actually a very similar recipe on here for ice cream scones) as they were soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm wondering if it was the ice cream I used; its homemade and perhaps not even ice cream (I forgot to check what id labeled it b4 dumping it out of my container--its either ice cream or frozen yogurt) or just how they are supposed to turn out.  Would be good with jelly or peanut butter--or both!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really quick, easy recipe.  Note: These muffins aren't fluffy.  They're pretty dense.  They are tasty though.

I made these this morning & used Strawberry ice cream! I let the ice cream sit in the counter for awhile but next time I will let it melt completely. It was very dry & hard to mix. I added a couple of splashes of milk until it was easier to stir & combine. I added some red sugar crystals on top & baked for 20 mins. They came out looking very nice. You must let them cool completely before removing paper because they stick even though I sprayed them. These are not too sweet & more like scones. These would be great w/ all the normal scone condiments. I will make them again & look forward to trying different flavors of ice cream!

I made this in a loaf pan instead of muffins. I used Butterscotch marble ice cream and it was a big hit. I used 2 cups of soften ice cream and 1.5 cups of self raising flour. You can use all purpose flour, but just add 2 tsp of Baking Powder. I cooked this for 40 minutes in the pan.  I've tried a few other flavours of ice cream, but so far the Butterscotch is my favourite.

I didn't like these at all. It came out tasting more like a combination of scone and bread than a muffin. The batter was also very thick. The recipe said to soften the ice cream, which I did, but wondered whether it should have been completely melted. And, mine didn't look anything like the picture. I was very disappointed.

I liked this but my family not so much. They said it was too plain and they could taste the flour. I thought its a cool recipe! I made this using 2 cups ice cream (melted) and 1 1/2 cups self rising flour. I used moose tracks flavor ice cream and I'm glad I did because it needed the chocolate and peanut butter for more flavor. I baked it uncovered in a buttered loaf pan @ 350 degrees for 50 minutes.

I used 1 c self-rising flour and 3 cups melted ice cream. The consistency of the batter was perfect and the added ice cream makes it sweeter & more flavorful. I used a "Southern Lemon Pie" ice cream. Everyone loved them.

I followed the recipe as is and didn't add anything to it.  I used self rising flour and good ice cream. It was bland. I was making this for work, so the first batch was bland because I followed the recipe.  The second batch, I added vanilla flavoring and sugar. It improved it a little. If I would of added more sugar, than it would of tasted better.  Not worth the price of good ice cream for this. Somehow the flavors in the ice cream are lost in the baking. I like the concept but will never use this recipe.

I added some cinnamon to compliment the mild vanilla flavor; but the muffins were still not flavorful. I agree with the previous comments: the pre-baked dough was the consistency of biscuit dough; and the cooked muffins were not fluffy like a muffin, but dense like a scone. Even though the inside of the muffin was chewier than the outside, it was still dense and a bit difficult to swallow. I started cutting the muffins in half and spreading jelly, butter, or cream cheese on them to compensate for the bland flavor and unpleasant texture.

Don't expect these to be sweet like a "normal" muffin not enough sugar. If you add fresh blueberries they will be VERY tart. I made with 1 cup SELF RISING flour,  1 cup (melted so that it was like milk) vanilla regular ice cream, and 1 cup of fresh blueberries baked at 375 for 25 min. made 6 muffins - and they were dense, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and good but  we felt maybe 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 tsp vanilla would have made these much better.

Cut recipe in half, to get 6 muffins.  Used Pralines and Cream Gelato (it was on sale).  Came out really delicious.  I'm bringing it to Thanksgiving.
