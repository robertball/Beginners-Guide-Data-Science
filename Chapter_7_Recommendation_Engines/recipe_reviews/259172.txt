These were not my favorite but my kids loved them. Next time I would add some onions or more herbs. The duck fat was a little hard to find. Ended finding it a fresh market or Whole Foods.

This was amazing! The duck fat gives the potatoes such a rich and deep flavor. I did end up adding more herbs but it is great as written too. 5 stars all the way!

These potatoes were a bit hit. The only change I made was using bacon fat instead of duck fat. They were perfect.

Delicious and the way to go when the oven is occupied with a prime rib.
