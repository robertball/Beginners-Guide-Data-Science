I was curious about how this would taste, but it's quite good.  I used turkey bacon and nuked it, rather than frying.  If you prepare the cauliflower ahead of time, this is a fast fix.  I may try using frozen crumbled cauliflower packages the next time I make it.  I will also cut the recipe in half for just the two of us.  A full recipe makes a large batch.
