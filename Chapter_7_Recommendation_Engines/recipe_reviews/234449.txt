Pretty good! I love sushi but found the soya sauce a bit overwhelming in this recipe, will try adding less next time. Love the wasabi flavor though, would go well with some fresh ginger blended into the hummus.

I tried your recipe and LOVE it.  It is really a new idea from the basic hummus. I didn't put it in my "recipe book" and was concerned I wouldn't find it again.  This time I am saving it although I really know it by heart.  Don't be concerned about the rating, you get a five from me!

It was ok. My husband didn't like it.  If it was just for me, I would make it with less soy sauce.
