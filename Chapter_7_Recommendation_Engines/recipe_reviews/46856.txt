I chose this recipe because at the time, My Lit class was reading To Kill A Mockingbird and I had to do a project. Well since I'm lazy I decided to make Apple Charlotte because it was mentioned in the book. There are 18 people in my class and no one ate the bread. They smothered the apples with whipped cream and I would be surprised if they could taste the apples. The bread wasn't mushy but the outside was toasted and the inside was flabby. My teacher liked it becaused he said it wasnt too sweet like normal pies. I would suggest using ladyfingers in lieu of bread and maybe a different filling like cherries or strawberries because they produce more sugary juices when being cooked.

I was intrigued by this recipe and hoped that it might come out more like an apple pie at least in flavor. Because the previous reviewer said this was mushy I adjusted the size of the pan. I used a 9x13" glass pan. This required using an extra half loaf of bread.
My family said this tasted like slightly toasted bread with cooked apples. They felt it was way too much bread and way too little apple flavor.
I imagine there may be other ways to adjust this recipe to make it better but I'm not game for wasting more bread on it.
Sorry, I can't recommend this one.
