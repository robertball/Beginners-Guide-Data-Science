I love the ease of making the meatloaf in muffin pans.  The recipe came together very quickly  and cooked in about 30 minutes which was great for a weeknight meal.  I thought the meatloaf itself was just ok.  I wasn't crazy about the texture.  There were a lot of bread crumbs in the mix which made the texture a little mushy.  I also thought they were a little bland.  I would definitely use the cooking method again, but, change up the flavors.
