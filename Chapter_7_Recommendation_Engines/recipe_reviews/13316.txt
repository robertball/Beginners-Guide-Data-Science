This is a fantastic recipe.  I had to make a few modifications because where I live in France, some ingredients are either not available or not exactly the same.  Therefore, I substituted cheddar cheese for the american cheese and bacon for the ham.  The other thing I always always do is sautee the vegetables (onion & celery) first.  I just prefer the flavors that sauteeing brings out.  I Fried the bacon and set aside.  Used 2 tbsp. of bacon drippings to sautee the onion & celery then followed the recipe as stated.  I added the bacon (crumbled) at the point where the ham would have been added.  This is by far my favorite potato soup recipe that I've tried.

Ok, I don't often leave "reviews" but this time I gotta!  My hubby said he wanted potato soup for dinner so, not having a great recipe, I ran to allrecipes.com and tried this... it's fantastic!  Everyone, including my picky 8 and 2 yr. olds loved it!  I'm going to email this to my sisters and mom.  Yum.  The only thing I did differently is to use Colby cheese as it's all I had in the fridge.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted frozen cubed hashbrown potatoes for the fresh potatoes to speed up preparation.

This soup was very good.  I tripled the recipe, added broccoli, sauteed the onions before adding them to the potatoes, and partially blended it before adding cheese and ham to thicken it a bit.  I served it with Fantastic Foccaccia Bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good - even with skim milk and no ham.  Would make again, but would double the recipe as it doesn't really allow for seconds.

Great soup...a family favorite. I added 1/2 cup chopped carrots, a LITTLE more liquids (to get the consistency right for my family), used velveeta cheese and no ham...since it is a potato soup. Tasty!!

My kids liked it and hubby who doesn't like soup loved it.  It is a very filling, meatless dish (I didn't add the ham) and used ingredients I had on hand already.  Similar recipes called for sour cream, cream, etc that I didn't have.

Yeah, yeah, I know.  I'm rating a recipe that I made a lot of changes to.  But I like seeing reviews like this.  It shows me the realm of possibilities.  Since I am dieting, I subbed cauliflower for the potatoes.  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I omitted the flour, added half the salt, added 1 c. FF evaporated milk, added 1 c. 2% cheese, along with the specified amounts of ham, celery, onion, parsley, and pepper.  I really liked this soup, and it fits great on my diet plan!

Base of the soup is key. I used this as the base, then built on it. 1) Fry up some bacon, retaining the grease. 2) Mix the flour into the grease and make a roux. 3) Add 1/2 cup half and half (or milk) and mix until smooth. Add to stock pot with other ingredients (except for cheese & bacon) and only 1 cup of milk. 4) Simmer on low until potatoes are soft. Mix in cheese and bacon, simmer until cheese melts. YUM!

Loved this soup! It was really good. I made a quadruple batch so that I could freeze a double batch for some other time. I added a little more potatoes than it called for. I added carrots and broccoli to make it more healthy for my family.

This is a hearty soup and good tasting. I also thinned it down with double amounts of water. We like soup alittle thinner. For a different flavor try removing the seeds and membranes of two jalapenos - chopping them to add with veggies while cooking. Thanks for the recipe!

this was a really good start for a first time potato soup maker.  I used an immersion blender to thicken it a bit rather than all the cheese. I did add some of the cheese, about half towards the end, added some garlic and parsley flakes. Didnt use any meat in the soup, only used crumbled cooked bacon on top when serving.     Thank you for the very easy recipe, my family LOVED it!   Just a note, I made bread bowls from pillsbury french loaf and served in those.

I created a signon just to let everyone know this is a great soup.  I did add 2 oz of Pepper Jack cheese.  It gave it just a little kick without being spicy.  I used American cheese slices and it melted with ease.  I don't use celery, onions or ham.  I guess plain but can't wait to make again!

This was OK, but not my favorite.  I have a similar potato soup recipe that uses smoked sausage and corn (no celery) along with the cheese and potatoes and we like that a whole lot more!

Excellent! I used chicken broth instead of bouillon.  I didn't have onion or celery so subbed onion powder and celery salt.  Used a mexican blend cheese instead of American.  Turned out so good!

This is one of the best potato soup recipes I've ever tried.  I used kielbasa instead of ham and sauted the kielbasa with onions (left out the celery) and minced garlic and added it to the soup at the end.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of American cheese.  I added extra water and a little milk to thin it since it was so thick.  So good!

I can't believe the liquid quantities that were recommended.  I put in at leat twice that much water in order to make it soup instead of stew, and it's still plenty thick.  Flavor is good, but would have been awfully thick--not soupy.

This soup is SO good! I did have to make some changes but I dont think they changed the taste of the original recipe. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. 1 small carton of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. And I made a rue of butter and flour instead of mixing the flour with the milk. I will be making this often all winter!

For those watching their carb counts, like me, this works great subbing cauliflower for the potatoes. I like to use organic chicken broth instead of bouillion and water and using just a touch of 2% sharp cheddar and either fat free evaporated milk or fat free half-n-half to add a touch of creaminess without a lot of the added fat. NOTE: Someone e-mailed me to ask what I did about the flour in the recipe. I actually used a tablespoon of cornstarch in the quarter cup of milk I used to thicken the soup instead of flour.

This was AMAZING! It used all the ingredients I had on hand (didn't have heavy cream, etc. that other recipes called for). I made just a couple changes as others suggested: garnished with bacon bits instead of using ham.... and also sauteed my onions and celery before adding to potatoes instead of boiling, and added a bit of garlic.... and it came out great! Will be making again & again- so easy!

GReat and super easy soup recipe.  I took one reviewers suggestion and sauteed the onion and celery in drippings from the bacon for the topping.  Used unpeeled red potatoes and chicken stock instead of bullion cube and water.  Pretty minor changes, but this was delicious soup.  Topped with sour cream, green onion, shredded cheese and crispy bacon.  

YUM YUM YUM!  I will have to double the recipe next time so hopefully there will be some left over.

This was pretty good soup! I did change a few ingredients though.... I used half and half instead of milk and did not add the ham.  We topped ours with a little shredded cheddar, sprinkled some chopped chives, and some crumbled bacon.

This was amazing! No one in my family likes onions so I used half the onions but doubled the rest of the recipe, and on top of using american cheese, I used cheddar cheese as well. I gave some to my neighbor and she called me and told me it was the best potato soup ever, and I am probably going to gain ten pounds before it's all gone. Yum.

This was really good, I used bacon instead of ham, and it was very bacon-y, so I would probably use less bacon next time.  I'm not marking down stars for that, because the recipe was supposed to bacon instead of ham.  It was a little thicker than I wanted (may have been from me simmering to long) so I added a bit more milk.  Other than that, super tasty.

Easy and tasty!  I always use ready-to-use chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon, and I double it to 2 cups.  I also saute the onions, celery in 1 tbsp. of butter before adding potatoes and broth.  I also add 1 clove of minced garlic for extra flavor.  I only use a little shredded cheese as topping in each bowl before serving.  I also top it with a little chopped green onion.  Very yummy!

This was really good!!! I doubled the recipe and added a bit more onion.  At the end I also added sour cream.  This was a definite hit with my family, but I agree with some of the others a bit salty.

This is pretty good. Hot sausage (the kind in a tube) can be used instead of ham for a different twist.

It was awesome.  I did modified it a bit.  I doubled up the recipe.  However, instead of doubling the amount of potatoes, I added broccoli, cauliflower, and green onions.  I also didn't have enough of one kind of cheese...I used mild cheddar and some swiss...It was nice, thick, and creamy.  Great for a winter's day!

Wanted to make something with my leftover ham from New Year's day and didn't want to have to go out to the store..it's freezing here! Turned out to be a delicious choice. I always try to make as directed and had everything. I threw in a cup of Tex Mex already grated cheese as I was feeling lazy..but felt guilty and for the rest decided to add grated cheddar as stated.

So good! Really simple to make too... I omitted the celery and added a shredded carrot instead, I also didn't add ham or bacon but will add some bacon next time. Since I don't own an immersion blender I took my handy dandy potato masher and just mashed one or two times it worked!! Will make again thanks for the recipe.

Sooo GREAT! My husband and I loved this! I doubled it and rather than use water and boullion, I used 32oz of chicken broth. Also, I added ground beef and some bacon (left over from weekends breakfast). This soup really IS better than anything I have had in a restaurant. Just the one I have been looking for!

This recipe was great and my husband loved it!!  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of the water & bouillion cube as people had suggested.  I also added a cup of carrots and used Keilbasa instead of the ham and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again!

Tasted better than anything I've had in a restaurant. I used new potatoes and a great tasting smoked ham - minced instead of chopped. I added a bit of butter and some green onions, and I used Velveeta Queso Blanco shreds for the cheese. Even though my husband prefers my old-fashioned potato soup, this is my new favorite!

this was easy and very good! i used an extra cup of potatoes, extra chicken broth, and used half milk and half broth to mix with the flour.  also, i used about 4 slices of american cheese instead of shredded, and i added some leftover broccoli.  it was a big hit with the kids!  they said i should make it more often!

Excellent recipe! Will definitely keep this one! I added a tsp of chopped garlic, sauteed the celery and onions, and used bacon! I also used a mixture of colby, monterrey jack, and cheddar cheeses! Just read through all the comments and combined the ingredients that others had tried!!!

We loved this soup.  My husband said it was better than his mom's potato soup he grew up on.  Yay!  I doubled the recipe and found there was not enough water to boil the veggies, so added an additional cup.  It was very thick after adding the milk and flour so added more milk to thin it out a little.  It didn't effect the taste at all, very tasty.   DH wants it once a week in the fall/winter, so I guess I'll be making this again soon!

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly and was delighted with the result.  My entire family devoured their soup.  You could probably reduce the amount of cheese (or choose a lower sodium variety), as the end-product was borderline too salty for my taste.  However, the rest of the family gave no indication of having noticed this...so I will make it again.

Really good! The only think that I changed was I used about 4 different kinds of cheeses - just because I dont really like American! Perfect for a fall day!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now..I change it up a little though.  I use fresh parsley...and add a handful of chopped green onions...as well as some fresh minced garlic.  After the milk/flour mixture is added and allowed to thicken a touch I add chopped, cooked bacon( with the grease) instead of ham...much better flavor!  I get RAVE reviews everytime!   I also use Velveeta shreds...if I can't get that I chop regular old velveeta...you can't go wrong..it's DELICIOUS!

I used chicken broth vs water & cheddar vs american cheese so the variation may be why I didn't give it 5 starts.  It still lacks zest.

Loved, loved, loved this soup! This is definitely THE soup recipe for our family!!! I doubled the recipe so that we would have leftovers for workday lunch. The only thing we omitted was the celery and that is just because I don't like it in soup.  This really is a must try!

My family really liked this soup.  I used cheddar in place of the American cheese and bacon instead of ham.  A great comfort food!

This is a fantastic recipe. I had to make a few modifications because where I live in France, some ingredients are either not available or not exactly the same. Therefore, I substituted cheddar cheese for the american cheese and bacon for the ham. The other thing I always always do is sautee the vegetables (onion & celery) first. I just prefer the flavors that sauteeing brings out. I Fried the bacon and set aside. Used 2 tbsp. of bacon drippings to sautee the onion & celery then followed the recipe as stated. I added the bacon (crumbled) at the point where the ham would have been added. This is by far my favorite potato soup recipe that I've tried.

What a yummy soup! Doubled the recipe and took it to our Sunday evening Bible Study. Only one serving remained in the pot! I used my mini food processor to chop carrots and onions and added them. Also used fried bacon instead of ham and a smorgasborg of cheeses since I had several half used packages of cheese.  Delicious!

Very nice soup BUT I cannot get myself to put American cheese into anything -too many others to choose from- I used Cream Havarti ( good flavor, nice texture), added some fresh Dill and used half and half in place of the milk otherwise I made it "as is".

REALLY good!  we used crumbled bacon instead of ham and also added some green onion.  if it doesn't thicken to your liking, try adding about 1/4 cup of potato flakes.

Oh so delicious!  I used canned chicken broth instead of water & bouillon and shredded Cheddar Cheese instead of American.  When the potatoes were done cooking I also mashed them a tad, just to break down the bigger chunks into smaller ones.  This recipe definitely a keeper.

It is not natural how much my husband loves this soup!! I usually add a can of cream of celery soup in place of celery (his preference), but I tend to add more flour or powdered soup base b/c he likes a thicker soup!

I doubled this recipe and I'm glad I did.  It is an excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 shredded mild cheddar.  The cheese volume provides a hint of cheese, but doesn't overwhelm like a full-fledged cheese soup.  The ham is a great touch.  I also used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than milk, since I only had 1% milk and wanted something that wouldn't detract from the richness.  Make this one and your family will crown you chef star (or maybe not).

My daughter, who hates all forms of potato, loved this soup! We added shredded carrots, and used cream as well as milk. You don't even have to add the cheese -- it's already good without it, but the cheese makes it even more kid-friendly. We have never added meat; it is still the best soup we've tried. You definitely need to double or triple this recipe.

I agree with the others: you really must double the recipe.  It's so good a single batch isn't enough.  I added chopped turkey kielbasa for my son, but it's great even without the meat!

This is a very good soup. I added a few more potatoes and an extra cup of water and one more bullion cube. I also used one small can of cream and only a half a cup of milk. Velveeta tastes very good in this soup but gives it a funny texture. I've been most happy with about 4-6oz. of mild cheddar cheese. It's hard to mess this up with all these good ingredients!! You had better make a bunch, it will go fast.

This is a good soup.  It was a little bit too salty for me.  I will either add 1/2 cup more of water or just put half of the chicken bouillon next time .

This is a wonderful thick stick-to-your-ribs soup. It went together really quickly. I used crumbled bacon pieces instead of ham - it was great.  A perfect "comfort" food.  It was even better the next day.  Always make a double batch!

This soup is fantastic!  It is also very forgiving if you substitute ingredients.  I added more potatoes than the 3 cups, so I didn't need to use the flour to thicken.  I also used turkey sausage (like you might use for spaghetti sauce or chili) and cheddar cheese.

Yummy soup & easy to make.  I doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers.  I didn't add celery, parsley, or ham (none on hand).  I used cheddar cheese instead of American & omitted the salt (I think the cheese & bouillon had plenty).  I used my immersion hand-blender to blend some of the cooked potato (I prefer that texture).  Start to finish was about 45 minutes.  Next time, I'll add some bacon to garnish the soup.  There will definitely be a next time!

This is an incredible soup!  I never review either, but thought I should here.  My husband was hesitant to eat a potato soup, but LOVED this one.  I did double the water and boullin because I didn't want it too thick.  I also didn't have any ham on hand so I used bacon instead which I also thought was amazing.  It is going into my soup rotation for sure!

Just made this, and it was great! Instead of using ham, I used bacon and then used some of the bacon drippings. Then I baking up some bicuits (refregetated dough) and served thenover the soup.

Yummy soup, though I did make a few changes, which I feel only improved upon the recipe for my preferences.  I used bacon, not ham.  I cut the bacon into 1/4 inch strips then cooked till crispy.  I let the bacon drain on paper towel till called for.  I drained most of the grease then sauteed the onions and celery in it before proceeding with the recipe.  I also used cheddar, not American cheese.  Next time I will add a clove of minced garlic at the end of the saute, and increase the chicken bouillon (I will probably omit the salt with more bouillon).  Came out very good.

This dish turned out perfect. My entire family enjoyed this and the servings were filling. The only thing I did was used Hillshire Farm turkey sausage opposed to ham because my family does not eat pork. I also sprinkled a little garlic salt over my meat while it cooked.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. The only thing that needs to be changed is bacon instead of ham. Cook it until it's crispy and crumble over the soup when you put the cheese in.

Excellent! Hearty enough for my husband, but healthy enough for me! The only thing to make this soup is better is to place some of it in a food processer for a creamier consistency. I also used skim milk and a blend of 2% cheeses, but you would never know the difference! I found that this recipe makes about 4 servings, so double up if you're feeding a crowd (and with a recipe this cheap, easy, and good, you'll want to serve it to company)!

YUMMY!  I've really NEVER made soup before so I was skeptical about this recipe as I had ALL the ingredients in the pantry & fridge!  It came together really easily !  I changed it some to go w/ what I had on hand.  I used bacon for the meat & sauteed the celery & onion before I added it to the water/bouillon !  Very good recipe a keeper for SURE !

This is very quick and easy to make!  My husband loved it - he's on a soft food diet for 1 week and this soup really satisfied him.  I didn't have American cheese so used Cheddar and also added some real bacon bits.  I'll be making this one again!  Thanks for submitting it Marge!

This is my favorite soup! I always double this recipe, I also never add the celery, and I always use green onions. I like the green onions better because they have color. I also use about two pounds of bacon, and I almost triple the amount of cheese. I tried this once as the recipe follows and it didn't have the cheesy flavor and there was too much ham for my liking. Other than that I love this soup....

I made this today and it was delicious! The only change I made was to cook it in a crockpot (about 4 hours on Low), and I added the flour as a roux after adding the milk. I doubled the recipe and it's already almost gone on day 1!

Great recipe to inspire! I loosely made this but deviated a whole lot! LOL. I added carrots, bacon, hamburger smoked paprika and lots of pepper but left out the cheese as it was so tasty as it was. Nice and thick to like a potato stew! I increased it over double for 5 adults and had some left over for the next day. I'll do this one again....if I remember what all I did!! ;-)

Delicious! I used turkey bacon, double the potatoes and double the water to make the recipe go further. I still used a cup of cheese, didn't double that, to save on fat.

This soup is INCREDIBLE! word of caution: it doesn't make a lot. i doubled the recipe for 6 people and didn't have leftovers. besides that, it's perfect! i just added bacon instead of ham because i didn't have any, and added chopped green onions.

I used this recipe once before, years ago. My family loved it. Just the other day my sister mentioned she had a craving for potato soup. I found this recipe again and had everything that it called for. I didn't follow the recipe to the "T", but my soup came out AMAZING. And i have this recipe to thank. One of the changes i made was to first saute the onion and celery in the pot with some butter, added one clove of garlic, s&p, and sauteed them until tender. Then added the potatoes and sauteed altogether for maybe 10 minutes. Added the water & some crispy bacon, and simmered. When the potatoes were close to being fork tender, i then added the "flour-milk" mixture. I brought it up to a boil and added some shredded Colby-jack (a little at a time) and reduced the heat. I left it a little thinner, being that it usually thickens up after the temp cools down. I just used the seasonings "to taste". IT was WONDERFUL.

I have been making potato soup since I learned how to make it in 8th grade home ec.  Lots of variations.  This was one was so tasty and so straight forward.  Made two changes because of pantry limitations.  Cheddar for American, bacon for ham.  I was hoping for leftovers for my next day lunch day, but no, not a drop left. I will try it again with ham.

I'm vegetarian, so I just dropped the meat and substituted vegetable stock for the chicken bouillon, and my boyfriend hates celery, so I substituted a couple carrots, cubed.  I also left the peel on the potato (I'm lazy when it comes to peeling ... and it's healthier, right?).

Delicious!!  It's very hearty and filling, but tasted so good that we kept eating even after we were full :)  Went to bed with stomach-aches.  Worth it!

EXCELLENT!! That's all I can say! I didn't have any parsley or celery on hand so I just left them out and it was still amazing! I also cooked some bacon and chopped it up to add at the end instead of ham. By far the best potato soup I've ever had!

This soup is amazing and I always add to it each time.  Sometimes we pan fry mickelberry ham and through in there, sometimes I add half and half, sometimes we just do bacon or I add a can of corn.  It's just a great soup!!  My kids love it and everyone I have made it for begs for more!!

This was absolutely delicious and quite easy!!  Everyone in my household liked it so this will remain in my rotation through the winter.  I used red potatoes and they held up nicely (didn't get mush or break apart too much).  The only change I made was using shredded cheddar cheese instead of American because that's all I had.  Next time I will try American because I had a hard time getting the cheddar to fully melt into the soup.  Or, I may omit the cheese altogether and serve each bowl topped w/ some cheddar cheese (instead of mixing it into the whole pot).  I doubled the recipe because I wanted this to be a meal, so maybe I should have not doubled the cheese.  A double recipe made enough for both my husband and I to have 2 big bowls, each of the 4 kids had 1 bowl, and there was only about 2 cups leftover.  This was a very tasty and inexpensive soup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
UPDATE:  Made this recipe again and instead of buying pre-shredded cheddar cheese I bought a block of cheddar and shredded it myself in my food processor.  It melted beautifully into the soup!!

Very good basic potato soup.  A little bacon on top makes it quite tasty.

Sautéed the onions and celery in a little butter while I microwaved the potatoes to cook them (I was in a big hurry!).  I added all the liquid to the sauteed veggies and microwaved potatoes and simmered until it thickened up a little then added a half small container of creme fraiche.  Ready in 25 min. and awesome!

This is quite the potato soup. I left out the celery and ham - not a huge fan of either, neither is my fiance. I did have to add some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, but other than that I didn't make any changes. This was perfect for a cold, cold night and really hit the spot!

Easy, fast and YUMMY!!! I used a fork to gently break up bigger sized cubes of the potatoes as they were cooking, but not til there were no potatoes left, this allowed me to omit the flour and still have a thicker soup base. outside of that I had to use celery seed instead of the real thing as I had none on hand, but next time I will use the real thing. Also I used chicken broth. This one will be a regular in my rotation. Thanks!

I made this last night - we really liked it.  I have searched far and wide for a good restaurant quality soup that uses no canned soup or instant potatoes.  This comes really close.  I used vegetable bouillon because I don't like a "chicken" taste in my potato soup.  I also sauteed my onion, mis-read the recipe and thought it called for shredded carrots, so I accidentally added one to this, and sauteed with the onion and celery.  I didn't have ham so used 1/2lb of bacon cut into pieces and saved some of the bacon grease for the saute.  Instead of using flour, I took my immersion blender and blended some of the soup before adding the cheese and bacon.  This step thickened the soup nicely, while still leaving some chunks of potato.  I will make this again - no doubt.  Thanks for posting it!

We really enjoyed this soup but was a bit too thick for us.  Next time I will omit the flour because I feel the cheese will make this thick enough for us.

Really good soup and relatively easy. Next time I will add a little bit more milk to the cheese sauce since it was a little to thick. Served in bread bowls and everyone loved it!

This recipe was pretty good! Mine came out a little too salty though, so I'd skip adding extra salt next time -- the bouillon and ham added enough saltiness as it was. Very filling. I doubled it and added carrots, celery and some mashed up broccoli and cauliflower for more veggie variety, since I plan to feed it to my kids.

An easy to make and satisfying soup. I sauteed the onion and celery in olive oil and a little butter first, and used 2 cups of water to start. After the potatoes were cooked I used an immersion blender to blend it just a bit,  to thicken the soup  some and make it a little creamier while keeping most of the chunks of vegetable. Thought this was a little bland so added some seasoned salt and a little onion powder. Didn't have shredded American so broke up 2 slices of 2% American cheese.

This is the best soup in the world!  DELICIOUS!  What can I say, my whole family loved it and I will be making it again.  I did not have ham so it was omitted, but I did add some carrots. I think you can add any of your favorites and you cannot go wrong.  A+++++

Tonight is the coldest night of the year so I decided to try this recipe so we can have something yummy to warm our tummy! It DID NOT disappoint! The only thing I did differently was to use bacon instead of ham. (only because it's what I had on hand) I also added some fresh chopped chives as garnish! YUM!! Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at making soup (other than chili)I was just browsing recipes to get rid of some leftover Christmas ham and found this one. I doubled the recipe as well and added about a  cup of baby carrots. I didn't have a 1 cube chicken bouillon... so I added a "dash" of swanson chicken broth.  It smelled fantastic while cooking and tasted even better.  If I could figure this one out, ANYONE can! :)

Great soup.  I omitted the ham (vegatarians in family), sauteed the onion and celery, have used various cheeses (mozzerella, grated mixtures, cheddar) with excellent results.  Only "bad" result was with evaporated milk-daughter wouldn't eat that one!

This soup is really, really good.  I'm fairly new to the whole cooking thing so I thought that I would give some helpful info for other novices that may be attempting this recipe for the first time.  It's actually only one thing.  In the beginning, don't worry that the water does not cover the veggies and potatoes.  After the initial cooking process is done, there is plenty of liquid.  I know that some people get upset when people change the recipe and then rate it.  I didn't make too many changes because I'm not that daring yet.  That being said, I did cut back the cheese by 1/2 cup and added another couple of handfulls of ham.  We midwesterns like our pork.  This soup was ALL killer and no filler.

I can see why this recipe has 5 stars! It's excellent and so easy! I noticed a lot of commentators noting that the water called for in the recipe was not enough--not so! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. With the measured amounts of potato & veggies, the 1 cup water is enough to cook the veggies tender. You don't need to have the veggies completely soaking in water! After everything is tender, you dump in all the milk which covers everything. A few more minutes in the milk to let thicken and you get the PERFECT texture & consistency for a potato soup! What's great is that the soup seems creamier than it is. That is to say, I used skim milk and yet the soup could be confused for a cream-based one. 

One thing I did edit for health reasons was the amount of cheese. I didn't have any cheddar on hand so used a little tiny bit of low-fat mozz. In retrospect, the cheese didn't even add very much when used in such small quantities so I might skip that all together next time. One thing to note though, I really wanted the golden colour for the soup so I added just a couple dashes of tumeric. It doesn't add a whole lot of flavour, but it does add fantastic colour if you choose to omit all that cheese. 

And like a lot of other reviewers noted, I did sautee the onions & celery first. The aroma of sauteed onions just can't be beat.

This soup is as promised... thick, hearty and kids love this, even if they happen to be 56 years old! Husband went wild over it.
I used Chicken flavored boullion mixed with 1 1/2 cups water. I also made this with half&half, 2 cups of cheese, Bacon and some carrots.
We need to make this again! Thanks, Marge.

This was yummy potato soup.  I used Better Than Bouillion instead of the cube and I didn't add salt.  I also just had cheddar cheese in the house so I used that and about 2 cups.  I alos was out of onions so I subbed with some Mrs Dash Onion Meadly.  The result was fantastic.  My husband couldn't get enough!  Thanks Marge for the great recipe!

This is DELICIOUS! I use chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillon. I put all the potatoes and veggies in the pot and then put enough chicken broth to cover them. I bring that to a boil and simmer until everything is tender. I also use about 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of American cheese. My whole family loves it!

This was sooo good.  I didn't add celery and subbed onion powder for onions, because in my house we don't like onions.  I also added a couple of cloves of fresh garlic. I left out the salt, because the boulion has more than enough salt.  Skipped the ham and used cheddar cheese.  Very good recipe.

This was excellent!!  We loved the flavor of this soup.  I doubled the recipe and used chicken broth instead of water.  Omitted the processed chesse and used sharp chedder.

Very excellent recipe, however, I do like it better with the changes that I have made to the original! I use 3/4 lb of browned Italian sausage instead of the ham and add about 3/4 of can of canned corn kernels.  I also use half and half instead of just milk to create a very thick chowder-like soup.  The flavor of the sausage and the bits of corn really add a great flavor to the potato and cheese mixture.  Thanks for such a great base recipe!

The celery need to be cooked a little longer than the other ingredients and as a result was a little firmer than the rest. Also, it was very thick. Other than that it was a great soup. I might sautee the vegetables with some garlic, for added flavor.

What I love about this recipe is the fact that it's simple and it's a basis to make many different other things. I don't put ham and cheese in it but it can be easily be turned into a delsious potatoe clam chowder just by adding a clams, or just a simple creamy potatoe soup just by it self! easy to make and taste's great!

this recipe was a surprising success.  I am a supervisor at a shelter for "homeless" woman and their children and had them prepare this soup.  We always need recipes that are quick, easy and that potentially everyone will like.  They liked it alot! and it will be made again.

This is a "must try" for potato soup lovers!  Couldn't have been easier.  I used white American cheese which didn't give it the "golden" color, but we all loved it.  Super comfort soup on a cold, rainy day.  Thanks for this one.

Great receipe. We had to increase the liquid by half, and we used Velvetta Cheese.  The consistancy was fine.  I also added some basil for a little extra flavor.  It was a perfect sized meal for our family, but next time we will double the receipe so that we can have leftovers.

I cooked my onions, celery and garlic in a tablespoon of butter till softened and smelling really good before adding the potatoes in, then used chicken broth to boil instead of plain water. I used three Russet potatoes and needed about two cups of broth to cover the potatoes completely. This wasn't any harder than adding it all together and boiling at once, but I'm sure gives it much deeper flavoring. I didn't have American processed cheese, but a mix of Colby/Cheddar worked out just fine. This was a great way to use up leftover ham from Thanksgiving, and really easy. We really loved it.

This is yummy. I turned it into a creamy potato soup. I used 4 cups potatoes to make the soup thicker and added 1/2 cup chopped carrots. I sauteed the onions, celery, and carrots first, and added minced garlic to taste. Instead of the water and bouillon, I used one cup of low sodium chicken broth because we are a low-sodium household. For that same reason, I omitted bacon or ham. I pureed the veggies and broth, then added the milk and flour mixture. Used cheddar cheese for a better cheese taste and sprinkled chopped green onions on the top just before serving. All in all, my mother said "this is a keeper". I will definitely make this again.

This soup was great and easy to make. I did make one minor change, rather than adding ham, I added crispy bacon right at the end of the cooking process (Can never go wrong with bacon!) In addition, based on a few other reviews on here, I used chicken broth instead of mixing water and bouillon.  Worked really great!

I had to change some things to use what I had on hand. I subbed cooked crumbled bacon for the ham and diced carrots for the celery. I followed everything else though, and this turned out nice. I didn't have shredded american cheese, so I just topped each bowl with a slice of colby-jack cheese.

This is a great recipe!! My daughter requested potato soup this morning. I found this recipe for lunch and knew I had all the ingredients (or an equivalent) on hand. I used canned chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. And I had some bacon grease in the fridge, along with a ham bone in the freezer. I sauteed the potatoes, celery and onions in the bacon grease and simmered the ham bone in the soup. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe (swiping out cheddar cheese for the American cheese) and we were eating potato soup in about an hour!! The number of servings were accurate. We fed 6 people, but two of the servings were on the small side. Next time I'll have to double the recipe so there are yummy leftovers, since soup is always better the next day. Thanks, Marge, for the recipe!!

Delicious! Only thing additional that I did was add shredded carrots and instead of American cheese I used Colby.  It had such a great flavor of just the juices before adding the milk and flour that that alone would be a great soup! Love Love Love, and will be using this one again! Thanks for sharing!

This is a really good recipe and very easy to make.  I doubled the recipe for 10 servings and only used about one cup of cheese.  I liked it this way and a good way to cut back on fat/calories.

I make this ALL the time!  And, everyone LOVES it!  It's so thick though, I thin it out with some chicken stock but other than that, it don't really change anything!  I triple it for tailgating and there's a line for our soup - LOL!  Top with shredded cheese and some bacon bits and you're instantly a rockstar chef!

i used a cup of celery because i was just chopping away and it was too much.  i added some cooked broccoli and it toned it down.  pretty good.  didn't have meat, and used monteray jack instead.  i didn't have cheddar and think that would have been better, but this was pretty good.

I used the crockpot and substituted evaporated milk for regular milk.  This is a great and easy recipe even without the meat and cheese.

Best soup EVER!! I used my Thanksgiving ham leftovers and omitted the celery. I was afraid this soup was not going to be thick, like a chowder, but I was sooo wrong. Once you add the cheese, it thickens it right up! Love it, making it again this weekend.

I just made this.  I used 5 medium russet potatoes.  This looked like more than 3 cups so i added more of everything else.  I added dried oregano and dried thyme.  I used evaporated milk (diluted to 50% with water) instead of regular milk.  I added just a handful of shredded cheddar cheese instead of american and used 2 spicy chicken (casings removed) instead of ham, because thats what i had.  It tastes great, I just had a spoonful.  I'm refrigerating it for tomorrow's dinner and cannot wait to taste it when the flavors have had even more time to blend.  BTW, this would have been 5 stars but the prep and cook times weren't given and it would have been nice to have an idea of how long this would take.  It took me about an hr total.  YUM!

This was thick, hearty, creamy, and comforting. The only real changes I made were to use grated carrot instead of celery and cheddar cheese instead of American. I also used a whole 16 oz. package of diced ham and about 3.5 cups of potato cause I didn't want the rest to go to waste. I will definately make this soup again! Tastes great with a little Tabasco sauce mixed in.

Yummy! I followed Msrootz suggestions and sauteed the onion and celery to soften. I didn't have ham so I added crisp crumbled bacon towards the end. Also used one other reviewer's suggestion by using my immersion stick blender just a bit to get some of the chunks smoother which added to the creamiest of the soup. Great recipe and great suggestions from other reviewers. Thanks

Fabulous!  I was so happy to find a creamy soup that didn't call for butter or cream! Totally versatile too....you can sub vegetable broth for the chicken, add cooked bacon pieces instead of ham...whatever you've got on hand. I used another's recommendation of using an immersion blender to mash up some of the potato chunks. Thanks for a GREAT recipe :)

Simple and delicious-- doesn't get much better than that! I love how versatile it is, too.  I used cheddar and added some corn.  It is also wonderful with a couple splashes of hot sauce, which I add to my own bowl since the kiddos don't like spicy.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! It's a keeper!

This soup was great! I sauteed well trimmed bacon, onions, and celery, then added organic chicken stock 1.5 cups instead of a cup. I also added fresh Rosemary, garlic and chopped spinach at the end. A great soup base. I also used sharp cheddar instead of American cheese.

This was just incredible. However, I made a few "upgrades." I used leftover sauce from mussels that I made the night before to add to the broth. I also added sausage instead of ham.  Simply out of this world.  Almost a seafood potato chowder (w/ no seafood).  YUMMO!

Best potato soup I ever had. Don't cook too long or the potatoes will start to break down and your soup will become grainy. I used 2% milk, ham, vidalia onion, and velveeta. Next time I might get a block of american sliced from the deli so I can grate it myself like I did with the velveeta. The taste was still great.

Love this! I only wish it made more. I used Velveeta cheese because it's what I had on hand, and, at the recommendation of a friend, I topped mine with chopped green onions. I think I will double this recipe next time!

This was a very good potato soup. I added more water than was called for, omitted the celery (not a fan) and added garlic. I used velvetta instead of American cheese. Overall, a delicious and quick recipe.

This turned out so delicious.  It was very easy to put together and didn't take long to fix.  My 5 year old loved it and so did I.  The one problem I ran into was that I could not find shredded American cheese at the grocery.  I bought cheese slices instead and cut them into strips.  I used bacon instead of ham: SO GOOD!!!  I will be passing this recipe on to everyone I know.

This recipe was wonderful.  I made this last weekend --- my family loved it.  I doubled the recipe, and the family devoured it.  Next time I triple it so maybe we have some leftovers!  I did add carrots, and used a mix of american & cheddar cheeses (only because that's what I had on hand).  Also sauted the celery & onion in a little butter first.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I can't believe that this recipe has 4.5 stars. It is so bland and boring. No wonder so many of the reviews say that is is so simple and easy to make; there is almost nothing in this recipe besides vegetables. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone with the exception of my friend who cook for inmates at the federal penitentiary.

This soup was DELICIOUS!  It was a hit with my husband as well.  I only gave it 4 stars, however because I added an extra cup of milk and it was still a very very thick soup.  I think had I added only what the recipe called for, it would have been too thick.  Next time, I'm going to double the recipe so we have more leftovers!  :)

I would like to give this soup 5 stars but it wouldn't be fair since I didn't have some ingredients. I had carrots instead of celery and cheddar cheese inplace of american. I also added some heavy cream (along w/ the milk) that was in the fridge that needed to be used up before it went bad. The soup did not need salt especially since there is a lot of sodium in the bouillon and ham. Before adding the milk, cheese and ham, I mashed some of the potatoes to make the soup thickier!

My husband loved this recipe! I took another reviewer's advice and sauteed the onions and celery in a little butter (also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic) before adding them to the potatoes and seasoning.  I had to add a little more water before the potatoes got soft enough but I probably just didn't cut them in small enough cubes.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk - made it extra creamy!  Very hearty soup for a cold winter night!

i love love love this recipe.  It was easy, filling and tasty. The only thing I did different was swap the onion for a green onion  Next time I'm going to substitute ham for bacon.  And it will taste more like a "loaded" bake potato.  Otherwise so good I will definitely make it again!

this was soooo good! the perfect comfort food. it was really easy too! i only had to tweak the recipe because i made a mistake. i put in a little too much cheese so i added a couple splashes of milk. i was skeptical during the first stage but it definitely came through in the end. i would ABSOULUTELY make it again! thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have American cheese so I used some sort of salsa flavored shredded stuff I had on hand.  I also "mashed" some of the potatoes because I like a REALLY thick soup.  This one's a keeper!

I doubled the recipe and used a mild cheddar cheese.  I also cooked a pack of bacon in the microwave until it was crunchy, broke it up into small pieces, and used that instead of the ham.  I sautéed the celery and onions in some olive oil along with a little bit of minced garlic beforehand.  I thought that this was a great and delicious soup overall!  One of the best Potato Soups that I have had!

I had never made potato soup before and couldn't believe how easy it was!! I first cooked little pieces of bacon and then sauteed the onions and celery in the bacon grease, then added the potatoes and everything else...added a little cayenne for a kick and it turned out yummy! Thanks!

Loved it!  

I added an extra cup of water, because the amount the recipe called for didn't even cover the veggies!  I also added garlic (garlic should be in everyting... yum!) and I only had colby/jack cheese so I put that in instead of the american.  I also put in some oregano and I know I put in a TON more salt and pepper than the recipe called for.  The salt was by accident, but it still didn't taste overly salty to me.  I am glad I added that extra cup of water, becuase it was still very thick.  It was wonderful.  I am eating the leftovers now with goldfish crackers for lunch.

This soup is quite yummy, my boyfriend and I loved it. I substituted fried bacon for ham, as well as sauteeing the onions and celery in some of the bacon drippings before adding them to the soup as other reviewers suggested. I also used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cube. Fantastic! Only quib- This makes 2 1/2 - 3 big bowls of soup, not five. next time I'll try adding more liquid. We have big appetites!

Great soup!!  I just about doubled the recipe and guessed on the measuring, and it still turned out awesome.  I left the skins on the potatoes.  Chopping all the veggies and shredding the cheese my Cuisinart saved a bunch of time.  I sauteed the onions and celery for just a few minutes before adding the other ingredients to the pot.  I added a splash of white wine and a few sprinkles of garlic powder while simmering, and used cheddar instead of American cheese.  I also substituted pre-cooked bacon for ham to save time.  Just before serving, I topped with a little bit of grated cheddar, a few green onions and a dollop of sour cream - just to make it extra yummy :)

This was great. I read the reviews and made a few changes. Browned center cut bacon until crisp. Then used a little bit of the drippings and sauted the onions. Then added carrots (about a cup--i used the baby carrots in the bag and chopped them because it was easier).  Then i added 6 cups of golden potatoes cubed and doubled the liquid.  Added the seasonings suggested (used more salt though).  Once the veggies were tender I used my blender to puree the soup and put it back in the pot.  Added cheese and bacon and cooked until the cheese was melted.  Yum!!

As the other reviewers stated, this recipe is great!  I used sharp cheddar cheese in place of american and left out the meat.  My whole family loved it.  It tasted exactly like a soup I recently had at a five star restaurant.

Okay, I do not know where I went wrong, because the taste of the soup was AMAZING.  Very good!  But this was no soup for me...It was very thick, the potates were over-cooked and when I went to put up the leftovers, it came out in a glob (very thick).  I read some reviews and I don't know where I went wrong :(

This was excellent!  My husband who isn't a big fan of soup said, I'm "turning into a genius in the kitchen!"  I did have to alter it a bit since I used more potatoes.  I added 1 can of chicken broth in place of the bouillon and water and 1 can of evaporated milk. Will make again soon!

This soup is chunky and VERY filling.  It may have been because I was a bit liberal with my vegetable measurements, but for me it was not soupy enough so I had to add a bit more broth.  Don't worry too much if it doesn't thicken right away, the cheese helps thicken it!

YUMMY FOR THE TUMMY! This soup was great! I used bacon instead of ham, and added a little more potatoes and a few carrots. I also used chicken broth instead of the water and the cubes. added a little more broth as well. Everyone really liked it and is a definite keeper in my house! Thank you!

We added an extra boullion cube + 1C water, and this was still plenty thick and tasty.  Even with the extra liquid, it only made 4 dinner portions.

Delicious soup...I followed advice of a few others and cooked in crock pot all day on low  but wound up putting on the stove in the end because potatoes were still crunchy.  Maybe next time I'll use the high setting.
I doubled the recipe from the start.
I used 3 cups of leftover turkey stock from Thanksgiving.  I added in carrots and italian seasoning for extra flavor.  Then for the last half hour I added the shredded cheese, 1 cup sour cream, 6 tbsp butter and 6 tbsp flour.  Instead of ham I crumbled cooked bacon on top.
YUMMY   YUMMY   YUMMY!!!!
Great base recipe to play around with.  I would make sure to cube the potatoes small so they cook quicker.

Very Very good. I added ham, real bacon bits and green onions and it was so tasty. I added more chicken broth than required (about 2 extra cups) and it was not thick at all....In fact next time I will probably only add an extra cup. I would also add carrots. I used skim milk and lower fat cheese to make the recipe a tad bit more healthy. Add clams to make a fab clam chowder.

We all enjoyed this recipe.  My two year old loves cheese and it is very difficult to get him to eat much else (other than junk).  He would only taste this after I told him I cooked cheese soup.  That's all it took for him to clean his plate!  The only thing I needed to add was a little more salt and pepper.  Of course my husband added tobasco sauce but, he adds that to everything he eats!

I was looking for a good recipe for using potatoes left over from Thanksgiving, and this turned out wonderfully.  But I have to admit that I usually use a recipe "just as a starting point."  In this case, I made a few changes.  First, I used my crock pot -- six hours on medium, adding the cheese/milk/ham for the last half-hour.  I added carrots and garlic and sweated all the aromatics before adding them to the pot.  I also added a can of corn (drained) and used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water;  I also added about 50% more broth because of the extra vegetables.  Finally, I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for half of the milk.  The final product was really good, though, and this recipe gave me a very good starting base.

My family LOVES this soup! Even my husband who hates soups. it has gotten to the point where he will call home and REQUEST Potato Soup for supper. The only change I make is to use bacon instead of ham. and we always sprinkle additional cheese, some green onions and a little extra bacon in each dish before serving. Very good!

This soup was wonderful.  Everyone in my family liked it and that is hard to accomplish.  Even the picky eaters ate it.  I added carrots to this as a way to sneak the veggie into my kids meals, and for some color.  Have made it twice with rave reviews, but it definately needs to be doubled.

This is fantastic!  I did double it for leftovers, and I used bacon bits instead of ham, as that's what I had.  My family requested it the next night - a first for my dd, who usually only likes tomato soup. I will be making this frequently! I can't wait to experiment some more, maybe Cheddar cheese instead of American, or some grated carrot for added nutrition. Thanks forsaving dinner Marge!

This was wonderful and easy to make.  I doubled the water and bouillion and it was still really thick.  Also substituted turkey bacon for ham.

This was really good!  I have never made any kind of potato soup, and this was really easy.  I think I might have messed up as I had a hard time getting the soup to thicken.  It wasn't watery but it wasn't thick either.  It is still good.  I will definately make this one again!  Thanks Marge!

Loved this.  I used mild cheddar instead of american and thought it worked perfectly.  I also substituted turkey bacon for the ham and didn't miss it at all.  My roommated loved it.  With good bread and roasted vegetables, the PERFECT supper for a cold winter evening.

I LOVED this soup -- made a couple of changes.  Double everything!  Instead of water and boullion cubes, I just used a couple of cans of Swansons chicken broth.  This was a super Fall meal!

I didn't have any chicken broth at home.  So I boiled the ham bone and made my broth from that.  It was the best soup I've ever made!! A little salty (but I don't mind that).  Probably the more potatoes that you add would help to absorb the salt.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was wonderful.  I used chicken grilled on a griddle sprinkled with just a touch of garlic salt and it was delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It's easy to make and filling.  Thank you to whoever uploaded it I will be making it many more times.

This soup is delicious! Perfect for a fall day (soup season imo) when you want a nice soup as a meal instead of an appetizer. I recommend using yellow potatoes, or if you only have white cut them up really small. My minor changes: I changed the flour to gluten-free flour blend and I cut the amount of ham to about half because it really doesn't need all that much.  Oh and make sure you stir the whole time you're adding the milk/flour mixture! This soup turns out sooo tasty and filling. I highly recommend making at least a double batch because you're definitely going to want seconds!

Wonderful, thickened it up some more with powdered mashed potatoes (2 tbls) and used Polish kielbasa (since I am Polish) instead of the ham. Bacon went right in with the sausage.  Great dinner, served with garlic bread.  Will definitely make this again for the extended family get together.

We made this for dinner tonight. My wife and I enjoyed it. We used a combination of cheddar cheese, a Mexican blend, and parmesan as we didn't have any American cheese. We also used bacon rather than ham.

This was really good! My boyfriend took all the leftovers to his friends at work to show off! Lol. I made a couple adjustment based on reviews : cheddar cheese, bacon instead of ham- an extra bullion cube.,I added broccoli just to get the extra nutrients . sautéed the onions and celery in the bacon drippings. I had to add a bit more water. Next time I think I'll add more onion and celery and take out the extra bullion for a more natural taste. Great recipe!

Made this fantastic potato soup exactly how it reads. I did use bacon instead of ham. It was perfect! Just the right consistency. You really don't need to change a thing! And my four young picky kids all ate it, yeah!

I made this soup with a few modifications and it was a hit. I first fried pepper bacon and then sauteed the onion and celery in the bacon grease. I used Yukon Gold potatoes as they are more firm when cooked. I skipped the water and bouillon, used chicken stock instead. Lastly used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Next time I will double up on the flour as I like my soups thicker, but corn starch did the trick.

I didn't have any chopped ham, so I substituted Johnsonville smoked sausage instead. It gave it such a smoky delicious flavor! This soup was delicious!! The only other thing I did differently was omit the celery as no one in my house likes it. A keeper recipe for sure!!

Very very yummy!! My entire family ate this soup up with very little leftovers and that was making a double batch. If you have many to feed I would choose to increase the initial recipe by 3-4 times.

I used heavy cream instead of milk. Used boxed chicken broth & cooked 5 pieces of bacon. Poured grease into soup. Chopped bacon to top soup with & chopped green onions to top with. Added extra cheese too just wasn't cheesy enough. Very very tasty. Made an antipasta salad & had a delicious meal.

Delicious!  I made a roux and added 50% cheddar and 50% Monterey Jack.  So easy and quick.  Sometimes you just don't want to made soup in a crock pot and wait for it!!!

I've never made potato soup before; but I loved this recipe.
Unfortunately; I didnt have the chicken bouillon or ham/bacon.
Instead of celery I put in green beans that I cut into small pieces. For the bouillon I substitued the green bean juice, about 3 tbl sps. It turned out amazing!

Good freezing recipe. I added bacon bits with the ham for a little more texture. :)

This soup was delicious. After reading the reviews I did make a few changes to mine. I used canned broth instead of bullion, I used cheddar cheese ( and just a bit of pepper jack for a kick), i also sauteed my onions in butter first.  A very hearty soup, perfect for a snowy evening!

DELICIOUS!!!!
I made this for the family on a very cold day. It was an instant hit! I substituted real bacon bits for the ham, used sharp cheddar cheese, & added 4oz. of sour cream when I took the pot off the heat. It was like having a baked potato in a bowl!!!

This is definitely a kid friendly recipe. My 12 year old who is very picky could not stop talking about how good it was.  I made two changes for the kids though,  I added onion powder and celery salt instead of the vegetables themselves. The two do not care for the cooked veggies. I personally found it to bland so I added plenty of Tabasco for DH and I. Per request of my son this dish will be at our table again!

The recipe was quick and easy to do, and I really enjoyed it.  It's a nice, hearty soup to make for colder days.

Some modifications that I made: I added 1/2 cup of chopped carrots to the initial vegetable mixture to make it more of a full meal.  I also reduced the celery by half (I just don't care for celery that much).  In addition to the spices in the original recipe, I added a large pinch of thyme and 1/2 clove of minced garlic to the vegetable mix.  I replaced the ham with 3-4 strips of crumbled, pre-cooked bacon.

Finally, I did notice that I had to add extra water for the potatoes to cook fully--this was with the pot uncovered.

Loved this recipe! I was going to be out at hockey until right before supper, so I put it in my slow cooker for about 4 hours and then when I got home I put in the flour mixture and cheese. I also used bacon instead of ham and seasoned with a little worcestershire and Franks's RedHot. This recipe is great for a busy weeknight and I will definitely make it many times this winter!

This potato soup is SO good! Perfect for a fall day. You definitely need to stay close by when cooking once you add the flour/milk, but overall its a very easy recipe. My family loved it!

WOW! Absolutely amazing soup... I did take a tip from one of the reviewers and substituted bacon for the ham... I sauteed the celery and onion in the bacon grease... then added it to the soup, it was delicious!

THIS SOUP WAS FANTASTIC!!! I did tweek it just a bit though....instead of adding the chopped ham, I added a bag of bacon bits (the ones that are like real bacon) it saved time and there was no mess.  It was so good :) my whole family loved it...will DEFINATELY make again!!

This is was a very good recipe!!  It used ingredients I had on hand, was easy and taste great.  I didn't have onion, celery, or ham so I just didn't add them.  Next time I make it I will add 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2/3 strips cooked and crumbled bacaon and i would use a little less cheese!  Great recipe and for sure a keeper!!

Very Good!  I added a little more water and another bouillin cube along with some garlic and carrots.  Next time I won't add more water because my husband likes it thick.  Easy to make even for a beginner like me :)

My friend made this soup for us on a cold, windy and rainy day.  It warmed me up and was the best potato soup I have ever eaten.  Highly recommend this recipe.  She used a mexican blend cheese instead of the American cheese as that was all she had and it was great!!

Loved this!  I sauteed the onion, celery and added some diced baby carrots too before adding the potatoes and water.  I suggest Kraft Classic Melts Four Cheese - it melted perfectly!  Great easy soup recipe for Fall..and the kids WILL love it!

I've made quite a few different potato soup recipes and this is the best by far. Super easy too. I omitted the celery cause family doesn't like it.  Instead of bouillon and water, I used a can of chicken broth and added a 1/2 extra water. Yum yum yum were the only words spoken at dinner...made it with sub sandwhiches.

Everyone loved this recipe. The only issue was that I had to add 1/3 cup of AP flour to the milk (instead of the called for 2 tsps.) to get my soup to thicken.

This is insanely good! Like the first reviewer, I substituted cheddar and bacon. Sauteed the onion and celery in a little bacon grease (plus 2 cloves minced garlic). I didn't add any extra salt, definitely didn't need it. Then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I tasted the soup before adding the cheese, and it had such great flavor which kind of got hidden in the end. I mean it was still really good, but it was more of a cheese soup with potato. Next time I will cut the amount of cheese in half, and also double the onion and celery.

It reminds me of the baked potatoe soup from Bennigans.  They closed around here and I miss this soup.  Thick and creamy.  Followed the orginal recipe except used bacon instead of ham.  SO GOOD!!!

Very good, simple soup. I made it in my slow cooker and cooked it for about eight hours, adding the cheese in before serving. I left out the ham and used Mild California Cheddar from Trader Joe's. Very filling and healthy, was even thick with skim milk. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe!! You can adapt it to your familys liking!! I sauteed carrots, onions, potatoes in a little olive oil before adding to the chicken broth. I also added a little beef base (way better flavor). I put a tbsp of minced garlic right when I added the cheese and used pepperjack and cheddar cheese and the soup was fantastic!! Thanks!!

Very good!  I was suprised a little - no fancy ingredients - but the outcomes was very tasty.  My seven year old and four year old child both liked it too!

Loved this soup. I probably should have cooked the potatoes a bit longer as some were still somewhat starchy, but still tasted great. I added a little minced garlic to the vegetables while they were cooking. Love the cheesy taste and hearty texture.

Thank you for a good recipe. I made some changes based on what I had.  No ham.  I sauteed the onion and celery plus a carrot and two cups of frozen corn.  Then simmered all the veggies in chicken broth and followed rest of recipe.  I also threw in a teaspoon of summer savory.

Really good, but not quite orgasmic good (hence the one star I withheld)  We'll be making this again for sure.  I was able to make it with ingredients I happened to have on hand, though I did use bacon in place of the ham and cheddar in place of American cheese.  Good enough to make me want to take the leftovers for lunch the next day.   And my picky little boys enjoyed it too!

This was a little bland the first time I tried it, so here are my changes for the 2nd try: I cut up 4 strips of bacon - fried, and removed with slotted spoon (reserve for later). Then I sauted onion and garlic in bacon grease, added water, chix bouillon and other veggies. To spice it up a bit, I added some Tobasco, season salt, thyme and basil. I skipped the ham and used cheddar cheese instead of american.  When I served it in bowls, I sprinkled reserved bacon pieces on top. Whole family LOVED it!!

This was so simple and delicious. The only change I made was that I added a cup of corn to the soup. I always have these items on hand (except for the ham but it's good without it anyway.)This recipe was quick and simple just what you need for a busy house hold!

Overall, the soup is very tasty.  The only changes I made were to use cheddar and omit the ham.  Next time, I will use less celery as it seemed overpowering.   My 3 year old daughter loved it.

I made this recipe for guests for a luncheon. They said it was the best potato soup ever. I made a few modifications. I used a whole pound of bacon instead of ham. I fried the bacon up and reserved a small amoutn of bacon fat. I then fried the onion and celery in the bacon fat. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk because I had buttermilk in my fridge. I added the crumbled bacon into the soup near the end of cooking time and reserved some for topping. Also, instead of dried parsley, I used chopped green onions. I also reserved some of the chopped green onion for garnishing as well. This soup was definately a keeper. I am making this again soon. (as a side note - i made the Buttermilk Cornbread from this website to go with this soup. It is also a great recipe).

Oh so yum! I tried this recipe because of the reviews and because it uses real cheese vs. the processed stuff. Did a few modifications: 4 cups potatoes istead of 3 (they were already cut so why waste them), a cup of good chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and about 2 1/2 cups cheese. We like cheese! Next time I might try a few more veggies and maybe leaving the potato skins on for added nutrition. The flavor is so good I don't think the kids will notice. Mine turned out thick but with thats good because its easier for the kids to feed themselves.

We all LOVED this recipe!  I 1 1/2 it for our family of 4 and it was plenty, with some for leftovers.  I used American cheese and swiss cheese because I wanted to get rid of some in the fridge.  The only change I will make next time is to not over cook it--many of the potatoes broke apart because I had it on the stove too long.  But the flavor was still great!  (Oh, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of water and milk to get the consistency I wanted.)

This was awsome! I doubled the recipe and instead of adding chicken cubes and water, just added three cans of chicken broth. I added two types of cheese, one being mozzarella as that was all I had on hand. I didn't even need to add the flour/water mixture as the soup was already thick enough...this is a winter keeper!

This soup is WONDERFUL!!!!!!  Very easy to make, and delicious!!  I took the advice of one reviewer, and used Ole Rida frozen potatoes, and it turned out wonderfully, and spead up prep time.  As others have reported, it only served 2 adults, but was just fine for hubby and me.  EXCELLENT!  NO NEED TO SEARCH FOR ANOTHER POTOATO SOUP RECIPE!

If you are making this as a main dish, this serves two adults. If you intend to serve more than 2 people, double the recipe. I made the recipe as is except I used a whole 14 oz can of chicken broth instead of the water + bouillon, and used cheddar cheese instead of American. I used pork roast from the deli at local grocer. This was really good!

I doubled this recipe.  We ate 3 servings and we might have enough for 5 more.  I used broccoli instead of the celery and onion, and added a little more milk and water.  It was pretty good,  I would make it again.

Delicious and flavorful!  I followed the recipe as written and also added some chopped carrots and one undrained can of yellow corn.  I also added an extra cup of water.  It was a little on the salty side and that is the reason for the 4 stars rather than five.  I added too much chicken base....so if you just stick to the recipe you shouldn't have that problem.  I will definately make this again!!!

I made some slight modifications to give the recipe a more sophisticated flavor. First, I added a cup of cauliflower to the pot, and substituted chicken stock for the water and bouillon. After the soup was finished cooking, I used an immersion blender to give the soup a uniform texture. Finally, I substituted extra sharp cheddar cheese for American.

Insanely good! Love it that the ingredients are so basic. My family loves it. I have teenagers that are in and out at odd hours. When I make it they look forward to the container in the fridge that they can scoop into a bowl, heat and eat! The only alterations I make: add drained, canned corn; add carrots (chopped or food processor); I triple it when I make it. As written it makes a very small batch. It freezes very well.

Perfect for a chilly night!  I did not add the salt (I tasted it and did not think it was necessary).  I added a 16 oz. package of frozen califlower to it 'cause it wasn't chunky enough for me after the potatoes cooked down.  It was a good addition.  I will add more black pepper next time.

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftover ham and this was very good. Didn't have any celery on hand so omitted it, and used dried minced onion as I didn't have any fresh and it still turned out great.

Soup had a good taste, but was not enough and was too thick, so I doubled the milk and used about 3 tsp flour.  I still think it was too thick, but it was very good otherwise.  I did not use the ham, but put bacon in instead.  YUM!

I never review recipes on here, but have tried many but had to review this one. Not only was it very easy to make, but very tasty! I added crumbled bacon instead of ham and it tasted just liked a loaded baked potato. My family loved it and I will for sure be making this again!!! Thanks!

Very good! I added extra potatoes, 1/3 c sour cream and used 2 cups (1 can)swanson low sodium chicken broth instead of water/bouillon. I left out the cheese and ham, but added cheese and bacon as toppings when serving.

Really thick..but good. I used thick cut bacon instead of ham.  I also just used some shredded jack/cheddar mix instead of American.

I just made this for me and my husband tonight for dinner. He's a picky eater and he ate the whole bowl. He loved it and so did I. I've tried a couple of potato soup recipes in the past, but I think this one's a keeper.

I love how this homey, cold weather comfort food is easy to whip up using basic pantry items.(American cheese! Who knew??) My family prefers it with bacon rather than ham, so that is what I used. I sauteed the onion and celery, and added some garlic. I used about 1 and 1/2 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth, and extra potatoes. I was generous with the black pepper. This time,I added some diced,  steamed broccoli crowns when I added the cheese. We liked it, but it was also good when I made it without the broccoli. 
 This basic, versatile recipe is easy to make your own.

awesome!! I followed the recipe pretty much to a T - the only changes I made were to use bacon instead of ham and I topped each bowl with some green onion. Better than similar soups I had in restaurants! This is a keeper.

After sauteing all of the veggies (to which I added one grated carrot), I doubled the chicken stock/boullion so it would cover my potatoes.  After the veggies were cooked, I removed half of the potatoes and used my  hand blender to pulse/blend the potatoes/veggies in the pot.  I then added the reserved cubed potatoes back in, then the milk with 1 tbsp (upped from 1 tsp.)of flour mixed in to the pot.  I had ham on hand and was awesome.  Will double the recipe next time.  Absolutely the best.

I stumbled upon this recipe again after making it a number of months ago. The last time I made it my family didn't care for it as it tasted quite spicy. ( I didn't add any additional items than what was called for) I remade a few days ago and WOW it's perfect! The next day was so much better ! It will remain a keeper! Thanks and I am glad I tried it again.

fantastic! i didn't have any ham or bacon, so i left out the meat. i also didn't use nearly as much cheese because i didn't want it to overpower the soup which had a really good flavor.  i also added about a teaspoon of ginger by mistake and it all turned out great!

I made this using the lower fat options. It turned out great. Hubby and kids loved it. I did make a few changes. I used another reviewers suggestion of frozen cubed potatoes and this helped with prep time. Even threw in a bag of southwestern hashbrown potatoes and one regular cubed potatoes. Turned out great. I did double everything and added about 2 cups more water. I cooked it for 1 hour to help reduce it and added the cheese at the end. Used low fat sour cream, skim milk and 2% shredded cheese. I also threw in a can of corn after draining. Very easy and quick meal!

This was a great soup for the left over ham from Easter. Very Tasty. As an observation most of the potatoes cook down to make the soup very thick.  Hubby loved it (you know---meat and potatoes!). Like most of the other reviews I added more water to boil the potatoes and added some chicken stock at end to thin soup out. For appearance sake I added carrots and a few cooked broccoli florets at the end.  Also just a splash of Tabasco sauce  and a dash of white pepper-gave it a kick.

Pretty good but I found that the cheese was the predominate flavour.  Next time I might use less or none at all and let the potato and bacon (I didn't use ham) be the main attraction.

Yummy! As others before me, I also added carrots to the vegetable mixture. I did not have American cheese so I used medium cheddar and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again!

I made this soup last night to serve along with some sandwiches and the end result was pretty good but I changed the recipe substantially.  I added carrot to the vegetable mixture and I sauteed the carrot, celery and onion in some EVOO before adding the potatoes.  I used chicken broth instead of water (probably closer to 2 cups).  I used about 1 cup of cheddar cheese for the processed stuff and I left out the ham (added some crispy bacon on top just before serving).  The end result was pretty good and it doesn't make a huge pot of soup which is nice.

Last week we had a soup cook off at my school and my class made this potato soup and it was a hit! It was easy to make and we got 2nd place. I also made it this weekend at homw. The only changes that I made were that I used one bag of shredded cheese and it was sharp cheddar instead of regular. It was so delicious. This is definitely a favorite in my house!

chilly, rainy day in GA and this seemed the perfect dinner option. Plus I had all needed items on hand! I did "tweak" a bit with the use of organic chicken stock instead of water.  No American cheese on hand, but cheddar worked out nicely.  I toasted English Muffins and put them in the bottom of the soup bowl.  Quite a nice warming meal! Thanks for the recipe!

This soup reminded my of the one my mom used to make which took her hours by the way. I was so surprised it was so simple. The only changes I made was adding Turkey bacon to the recipe instead of ham since I don't eat red meat. My hubby and kids loved it especially with some sourdough bread for dipping...beware, it makes the whole house smell like soup for a couple days, but worth it

GREAT potato soup!  I have tried hundreds of them and this was by far the best!  My husband loved it too.  The only thing we did different was added some crumbled up bacon on top when serving.   Thanks for sharing!!

Quick and easy recipe using ingredients that are usually on hand.  I used whole milk, canned chicken broth, sharp shedded cheddar and 1/2 lb cooked and crumbled hot italian sausage in place of the ham. I also added the flour to the vegetables after they were tender, stirring over the heat for a minute then slowly added the milk. It adapts well to whatever consistency you prefer,if you like it thicker add more flour (about 1-2 Tbsp)or add more liquid for a thinner soup. Great recipe to serve with salad, sandwiches or bread for dipping.

This is definitely the best recipe I have had from this website so far.  My husband can be fussy, but he absolutely loved this one!!  We replaced the ham with crumbled bacon, used some dry potato flakes, and didn't have quite enough chicken bouillon so added half chicken and half beef bouillon and it was awesome!! I will definitely make this again!

Just made this soup.  I gave it 4 stars because of the adjustments. The flavor as was, was kind of bland, so I did add garlic powder and onion powder. I sauteed the onions and celery in bacon grease like others recommended,then put the potatoes, celery, onion in canned chicken broth. I still added chicken bouillion granules in the end. I microwaved bacon and added that in the end with the mild cheddar cheese.  I really enjoyed the recipe. My stepson really liked it,( BIG COMPLIMENT!!) And it really hit the spot on a snowy day.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good, quick, and easy!  I left out the celery and used about 1c. American cheese and 1/4c. each of parmesan and Jack cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Will make this again!  Doesn't make a lot - we got only 4 servings.

I used what I had on hand: 3 baked potatoes, frozen steak fries - cut up, frozen chopped onion. Sauteed this bunch in 1-2 tbsp of butter with salt and pepper. Added 1 cup of water and 1 tbsp of chicken broth mix (until bubbling). Added the 1.5 cups of milk/flour mixture as directed. Then I waited until bubbling before adding about a 2-inch thick cut of processed cheese. Adjust the consistency with milk as this becomes thick as it cooks. (I added 2-3 tbsp more of milk.) This is a fantastic base to add virtually any meat for a complete meal. The kids gobbled this up. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is SOOO good!! I added 1 cup of corn instead of ham because I don't eat meat. I will be making this again for a family get together!

SOOOO GOOD!  I added carrots as well and used bacon instead of ham.  Also used the bacon grease to saute the vegetables first.

Excellent Soup!  I loved the combination of flavors.  It was perfect for a nice cold day.  MMM MMM comfort food :)
Thank you so much for the recipe.  I adjusted it to feed 4 since my other kids are at school during our lunch time.
The only thing that I did differently was add 2 slices of American Cheese and about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese &thyme instead of parsley as that was what I had on hand.  I also used 1 TSP of chicken bouillon granules instead of cubes.  Will definitely make this again.

Utterly fantastic!! Didn't have the ham: didn't need it! Added chopped baby carrots for more color, shredded cheddar instead of American, and pureed 1/4 of the soup for creaminess instead of the flour method. Picky partner had seconds, 7mo baby loved it.

I made this for Halloween dinner.  It was AWESOME!!!

Here's what I did different:  I used bacon instead of ham, I sauted the onions and celery before adding the potatoes in a SMALL amount of the bacon grease, and I used cheddar cheese instead of american.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO MY DAUGHTERS FAVORITE SOUP. A COUPLE OF CHANGES WILL MAKE IT 5 STARS! WE DICE A COUPLE OF SLICES OF BACON AND BROWN, REMOVE AND SAUTE THE ONITON AND CELERY IN BACON GREASE UNTIL SOFTENED. THE REST IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME , BUT WHEN THE POTATOES ARE COOKED STIR IN THE BROWNED BACON WITH THE CHESE AND KATE LIKES TO ADD A BIT OF FROZEN CORN. ONE NOTE: BE VERY CAREFUL WITH SALTING, YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT NEED ANY AT ALL.

This was great.  I doubled the recipe and it made about 4 big servings for hearty appetites.  I used baby red potatoes and left the skins on, just cubed them up.  I ended up having to use more water in order to cook the potatoes.  Sauteed the onions up first, omitted the celery because I didn't have any and added 2 large, grated carrots.  Used cheddar cheese and 1 ham steak that I cubed up.  Little bit of pepper and garlic salt.  I loved this. Thanks

This was fantastic!!!  I made a few minor changes as suggested by many of the reviewers.  I used cheddar cheese instead of american, sauteed the veggies and the ham first, added a little bit of garlic, tobassco, worstshire, and dry mustard.  I served in soda bread bowls and it was a perfect meal for the first real cold day of the year.  Thanks!!!!

This was good but not outstanding.  The cheese supports the results of this soup.  Kids liked it but I wasn't exstatic.  Probably wont make this again unless the kids ask for it.

Thanks anyways...

This soup is outrageous. I make it vegetarian, substitute shredded cheddar in place of American, and saute chopped onion, garlic, celery, and carrots in olive oil to start with. it definitely needs more milk or water; add it gradually until it reaches your preferred consistency.

I've never had homemade potato soup before, and this was delicious. It was very easy and quick to make. I halved the recipe and substituted white cheddar for American, and centercut bacon for the ham. I will definitely be making this again. My one-year old loved it!

I was starting to get a cold yesterday so I made this soup for dinner. It was fantastic! I didn't measure a lot of what I put in (used the "grandma" measuring system) which is easy to do with this recipe, it's very customizable and you can't really mess it up. I do think I put a bit more than a pinch of pepper in, and it was great. I like other reviewers ideas of adding broccoli and maybe even carrots. Definitely will make this again. Thanks!

By the way, I think I've averted/weakened the cold :) I definitely feel much better today. Double thanks!

This is the best potato soup recipe that I have ever tasted! Since we dont eat pork, I used turkey ham and used cheddar cheese instead of american cheese. When the winter comes and we are snowed in, I will definately make this soup. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was so quick! I am a working mom and working moms really appreciate recipes like this. Thanks!

This recipe is indeed "the Best!"  It makes a very thick and hearty soup.  I made a double batch the first time, and am very glad I did.  
Variations I made:
I substituted bacon for the ham (maybe 1T per 5 svgs - very light) and sauteed it with the onion until the onion was lightly browned, then added some water and simmered until the onions were clear.  I then followed the recipe.  I left the skins on the potatoes.  After adding the flour/milk mixture I brought the soup just to a boil before adding the cheese.  The weather has just turned towards fall here in the Midwest, and this was the perfect dish!  Thanks for posting it!

I liked this so much!!! I haven't had potato soup in such a long time. Anyways, I didn't add the ham because I'm Jewish. Also, the celery is GREAT with this soup. It was the best part. Good recipe !

Really good - although I did use cheddar as opposed to American and I also added garlic, dried dill and a bay leaf to the veggies as they simmered.  Instead of making a slurry with flour and milk, I decided to mash some of those spuds up to thicken up the soup.  It was delicious with some French bread.  Thank you.

Good tasting, but way too salty. I would definitely recommend leaving out the added salt. The ham will add plenty of the salt flavoring.

I'm giving this four stars because I thought it was 3 and my kids thought it was 5. It was too cheesy for me and too rich. Hubby didn't exclaim over it either. But, it is the first time the kids have eaten soup and liked it.

Yum - delish!  I added some thyme and basil, and held the cheese out to add individually.  I also added some water because I like thinner.  But that's all just personal preference - great recipe!  Thanks :)

I made this soup for supper tonight, and it is simply delicious.  I doubled the recipe, and made a few changes.  For a double batch, I used 1 lb of bacon, fried crisp, then chopped, instead of ham.  Althought this was very good, I'm eager to try the ham next time.  I sauteed the carrots & celery in just a couple of teaspoons of the bacon drippings.  I then put the uncooked potatoes, some carrots, and the sauteed veggies & cooked bacon in the crock pot for the afternoon. I covered this mixture with canned chicken broth, and added some tarragon, basil, celery salt, and garlic salt. Just before supper, I added the flour, milk, and cheese.  I used much less milk than in the original recipe, because I had added a lot of chicken broth. I didn't have the full amount of american cheese, so I added the 16oz box I did have, and let it melt. Because it was in the crock pot on low heat, I didn't even cube it. When the American cheese melted, I planned to add some sharp cheddar but found that it was cheesy/creamy enough without it. I just garnished the top of the soup with a sprinkle of sharp cheddar, and some toasted garlic bagel crisps.  Delicious!

I was in a hurry and short on potatoes so I modified the original recipe "big time", but it was every bit as good.  For the onion I substituted a bit of green cabbage. The likeness to onion is striking especially when fried. Instead of "real potatoes" I used instant potatoes.  Depending on the brand, you will have to work it as there is no exact measurement. Use a little to start with becasue the soup will easily thicken. Eliminate the flour. In place of a chicken cube I used a large tablespoon of sour cream. Like I said, my one too many changes came out every bit as good as the original recipe. Please excuse any spelling errors.

Oh this was so good!  I made it the day before we ate it as someone else suggested.  The only change I made was to use crisp, fried, turkey bacon.  My family likes it better than real bacon.  This will be a regular for me.  Thanks!

Soup received raves from all at our weekly family dinner!  Easy and quick to make using the recipe as written, but appears to be a great base soup for the addition of more vegies etc.  Thanks for sharing!

This turned out okay but it needed some adjusting - there is no way 1 cup of water is going to cover the vegetables and potatoes - just added it freehand and surprisingly I didn't have to change the amounts of anything else. I used hamburger meat but wouldn't do that again since it was very bland.  Ham would have been so much better - I still think that Delicious Ham and Potato Soup on this site can't be beat!!!

This was my first time making potato soup and I thought it came out great. My husband kept telling me over and over how good it was ( and he never does that ). I did change it a little bit. I used bacon instead of ham, and I added some brocoli. We thought the consistency was perfect and the flavor was so addicting. Will definately make this again.

This recipe isn't bad. I changed it a bit by adding a lot of garlic because nothing is complete without garlic, added carrots, and used chicken broth instead. It still seemed to be missing something, maybe the lack of cheese? Or maybe it just needs more garlic! Will make it again for sure!

excellent! I slice and fry sausages and add them to this soup for a really hearty and warming meal. I use a mix of cheddar and red leicester for the cheese. It is perfect comfort food on a cold night.

Very tasty. I changed the recipe by substituting bacon for the ham, used cheddar cheese, seasoning salt instead of regular salt and added some minced garlic. Stirred in about 1/4 cup of sour cream at the end. Next time I am going to try using Velveeta and adding some broccoli.

The soup made the whole kitchen smell wonderful! It was a pretty easy and simple recipes . I subtituted the ham for a cup of broccoli. The only problem i had was with the amount of american cheese that the recipes called for. It was over powering, and I had to add sour cream to balance it out. Next time, i will add half cheddar and half american. Overall, pretty good. Family likes it. A keeper.

I cooked in a crock pot so could'nt boil the flour mixture.  I used 6 medium potatoes to make a larger quantity (hubby takes leftovers for work), not 3, and when tender, I just poured 2% milk until soupy enough. THEN I partially pureed the potatoes with a wand/hand mixer right in the crock! It gave the soup perfect thickness without the flour.
I also used about 6 slices of crispy bacon instead of ham and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.
ALSO A SHORTCUT- I just found a frozen seasoning blend of diced onion, peppers and celery PicktSweet Brand. It helps cut down on chopping time! Perfect!

I have never liked any potato soup that I have made until tonight.  This recipe is delicious!  My husband is a picky eater, and he liked it too.  I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and cheddar cheese instead of American.  I also left out the ham at my husband's request.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good soup. I used some leftover Velvetta cheese as well as some shredded cheddar. Also, I didn't have any ham so I added a handful of Hormel bacon bits (the real stuff). Think it turned out fine. Next time I may add a little bit of butter and some garlic powder. Very comforting soup.

I've made this soup several times now and it's been eaten up every time!  I've used both cheddar cheese and Velveeta, and the Velveeta definitely makes a creamer, tastier soup.  It's so easy and delicious!  I have made these changes: add 1 cube chicken bouillon, add 1 can chicken broth, and add another 1/2 cup of milk.

mmmmmm, this was SO good! We made this to go with the Irrisistable Irish Soda Bread (also from allrecipes) and it was WONDERFUL!  At the suggestions of several others, we omitted the salt & pepper, used cheddar cheese, and added carrots. I let the vegetables soften all day in the crockpot, and added the roux, ham & cheese in last minute. It came out thick, rich, and oh so wonderful. We will be making this again, and again... perhaps with other meats as well! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was great!  The only thing I did differently was topping off the soup with some chopped green onions.  Very hearty soup!

The soup was a winter pleaser!  I increased the water and bouillon cube to three each.  You could easily substitute chicken broth for both if desired.  Omit the salt as the bouillon, cheese, and ham provide more than enough.  I also used 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh parsley in place of the dried for a nice taste improvement.  Thanks, Marge, for a "cold weather keeper."

This soup is wonderful, and does well doubled. We also used a box of precooked bacon, crumbled, instead of ham, and it was even better that way!

Great recipe.  Due ingredients on hand (or lack thereof) made some minor adjustments (2% milk with a bit of heavy cream instead of whole; one packet of goya ham flavoring instead of 2 cups cubed ham - only added one chicken flavoring packet) and it was truly a great quick meal.

Loved this recipe.  Cooked the water with a ham bone fist & used cheddar cheese instead of american & also added some (real)bacon bits for a little extra.  Everyone in our house loved it.  It was great on a cold winter day.

This was a nice change of pace.  I used bacon instead of ham. It was more like a heart y stew than a soup so the family was happy!  Served this with Breadsticks and salad.  Makes for a nice and simple meal.

This definitely fit the bill for a warm, comforting potato soup on a cold winter's day!  It was quick and easy to make as well.  I'm only giving it four stars as it seemed just a bit bland.

OMG - this is amazing!   Made a few minor changes based on other comments.    Sautéed the onions and celery in butter before adding water and potatoes.   Also sautéed the ham in butter before adding to mixture.   Added a few more calories, but I found it to be delicious.   Definite a keeper!!!!

I know I don't like when people change a recipe but....just getting off a clear liquid diet because of Diverticulitis so I had too, I had chicken broth open so replaced the water and added carrots (need the nutrients) and shredded the carrots and celery for stomach issues.
It is fantastic! will eat this for the next 2 days :), loved the flavor and texture with vegis shredded and will make it again.

Quick and easy fixins. As suggested by others, I did saute the celery and onions first. Then added remaining ingredients. Also used an extra cup of  water. Husband is not fond of creamy soups, so I did not thicken with the flour. Had some diced carrots, which I added a handful for color. Will make again.

I love this soup! Like eating a baked potato. I used an immersion blender to chop up some of the potatoes which gave it a creamy texture. Otherwise followed directions.

Love this soup! Thank you! I make it a little differently each time but today it was WOW. So adding my notes here in case it helps anyone else. So I sautéed 1/2 cup diced onions in olive oil til soft, then added 4 diced garlic cloves, one diced russet potato, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup gluten-free flour. I sautéed this for a few minutes then added 2 cups water, 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk (I use Califia brand), and 1 cup organic half & half. I brought this to a boil, then turned it down to low to simmer for about 20 minutes. To serve, I added a cup of steamed broccoli to each bowl of soup and sprinkled with sharp cheddar cheese. Ahhhhhhmazing!! Thanks for this recipe!

This was very good.  I used red skinned potatoes.  I added a little more milk.  I added hamburger as that's what I had on hand.  Also used mild cheddar cheese.  I will probably add more onions next time.  Also added extra pepper.

Husband and I loved it. Only changes were no celery or onion (but some onion powder). 1 cup of cheddar instead of American cheese... no ham... I just sprinkled some leftover bacon in my bowl. Oh, and I added some garlic to it. Tasted fantastic with some homemade bread and a salad!

I only gave it 4 stars bc I had trouble simmering vegetables in only 1c of water. I had to add about 3c to cover them. This diluted things a tad in the end. Otherwise great recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty much like it called for.   I didn’t have any meat to use but I did add  frozen corn  and I had Mexican mix  cheese  to it. I’ll make it again.  Very good.

Really yummy. We used bacon instead of ham because that's what I had on hand. Other than that, we made it just like it's listed.

I made this two times next.  The first was very good and the second time it was great.   I made these chances to it.  First thing I did was double the recipe.  It is not a big recipe.  By do this it will made around 4.5 Qts of soup. I added bacon, around 8 oz of cook bacon.  I put in 8 oz of ham.  I also added a 1/2 Anaheim peppers (I removed the seed).   The last thing I chanced was I used 4 cups of Sharpe cheddar.  I took it to work and everyone loved it.  It is also easy to make it Gluten free if you need too.

Made this last week and again tonight.  This time instead of cheese I added a can of  Cream of Chicken Soup.  It made a rich tasting soup so from now on will always make it this way .

I didn’t use all the potatoes the recipe called for; more like 1/2 and it was very thick.  A spoon could stand in it. However, the soup was delicious and hearty.  Definately one to consider on cold wintery days!

This is my favorite Potato soup recipe. I usually make this in a crock pot. Instead of a cup of water and a bouillon cube, I just use a cup of chicken broth. I also use a half cup more cheese than this recipe calls for and bacon instead of ham. The precooked bacon bits you can get in the store are perfect  for this if you dont want to take the time to cook up the bacon. I usually omit the salt until the end and add as needed. Other than that, you can toss everything in the crock on low for a few hours and its ready to go!

I don't even add the ham, throw in a bag of frozen vegetables instead. I also use red potatoes, so that I don't have to peel them. This is a 5 star recipe and is always a hit when I make it. A definite staple for winter

I have made this many times and always make a huge batch-5-8 lbs of potatoes and added the other ingredients accordingly.We always get a large ham to make many meals but always add some of the smoked rind (minus the fat) for flavor.Add baby carrots for color and Mozzarella cheese.Best ever-can't fill up my crowd.Cornbread muffins and heaven.Thank you for the recipe.!!

This is a wonderful recipe! I had no celery on hand so I substituted carrots, and used powdered broth instead of a bouillon cube.  In order to make it less thick and more soupy, I doubled the amount of liquids and cheese. Regardless, it tasted amazing.

Tastes great!, but I must have done something wrong because it looked like my cheddar cheese curdled a tiny bit.  Appearance wise I give it a three,  I would make it again for its flavor.  I added frozen green peas at the end to give it color and another texture.

I did make some changes, but the result was delicious!  I sauteed the celery and onions in butter beforehand, used an extra cup of water and an extra cup of milk, and substituted 1 cup of Mexican blend cheese and a few tablespoons of Velveeta because I couldn't find shredded American.

This soup was really good.  I only had red potatoes , so used them.  I did not peel them.  I also did add 2 diced carrots and used about 2/3- 1 cup additional broth.  I used some cheddar and some Velveeta Queso Blanco that I had in the fridge rather than American cheese .  Finally, I added about 1/2-2/3 cup sour cream at the end.  It was really good, by far best creamy potato soup I've made.

I chose to leave the skin on my potatoes (partially because I like the skins, mostly I as too lazy to peel them). I used unsweetened almond milk in place of the milk and water in this recipe. I used turkey bacon instead of ham. I also used half the amount of cheese.

This soup hit the spot, just what I was looking for!
With leftover smoked ham from Christmas and a temperature
outside of -1, this was great.
I did add some chicken stock to make more of a broth.
I will certainly make this again!
Added review: I made this today for lunch and used cooked bacon and American cheese slices which I cut up. I didn't even need the chicken stock this time. Delicious!!

I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. I also topped it with shredded cheese and crumbled bacon instead of adding it into the soup while it was simmering. This was a very hearty soup and easy to make. I will definitely be making it again!

This was really good however, I did make a few modifications, I did not have chicken bullion so I used one can of chicken stock ( I still added the one cup of water), also I added some cayenne pepper for a little of a flavor kick! Also I really like a creamy potato soup so instead of 1 1/2 cups of milk I used 1 cup milk and a half cup of heavy cream. This was an amazing soup!

I tripled the recipe and it turned out great! I did not have American cheese and used shredded cheddar instead. I think it may have changed the texture a bit, but it still had good flavor! My guys loved it after a cold morning of hunting.

Coming from a person who didn't much care for potato soup, I've become a fan with this recipe. My husband loves potato soup and wanted me to make it. I found this recipe. I used cheddar cheese and bacon instead of American cheese and ham, but I followed the recipe the rest of the way. This turned out really good and filling. We had it alongside homemade paninis.

Great recipe.  I made a few modifications because I was using left-overs from other meals.  Instead of whole potatoes, I used an equal volume of left-over mashed potatoes ... this sped up the process and provided a slight buttery taste.   Instead of plain water, I boiled the ham bone and used the water ... this increased the richness of the broth. I used about a third of the amount of cheese to bring out more of the potato tasted.  I also used fresh parsley ... about three times the amount of dried called for by the recipe.  Finally, I added a few cubes of carrot to give the soup additional color.

I liked this recipe as a base. It was little bland when I followed the recipe as written. I added minced garlic garlic powder and cayenne pepper as well as extra salt and pepper. I used Colby jack cheese because that what I had in the fridge. It was very delicious. Next time I think I'll try replacing the celery with corn and see how that goes!

02.09.17 ~ A perfectly cool day for making potato soup and using up some leftover ham!  I liked the ease of cooking all the vegetables at once and then adding the roux mixture to thicken.  I try to make soups often, for my 95 year young MIL.  My DH and I liked the mixture, but could have left the cheese out for us.  My MIL loved it just the way I made it.

I used this recipe as a base to use a ham bone I had in the freezer. Instead of chicken broth, I used the ham bone water. I also used shredded sharp cheddar instead of the American cheese. Nice tasty soup on a cool spring day.

I substituted ham for ground venison and doubled the recipe.  I also added finely shredded carrots and mushrooms which I cooked in the pan with the meat and spices. It was delicious!!

I had to double the recipe, as it does not make enough to feed a family the way it was written. Also, I used Maggi's Chicken Flavor Bouillon in place of the cubes. This gives it an extra flavor kick, and I am deathly allergic to pepper so I am always looking for ways to flavor my food that won't kill me when I try to ear it ??

This has been my "go to" potato soup recipe for several years. Everyone who has ever tasted it loves it & I have been asked for the recipe many times over the years. Although I "wing it" now, I make very little changes in terms of ingredients. Perfect as is!!

Dish was fairly good, modified a bit. I added carrots and A can of corn. I also used Velveeta in the soup as it was cooking and cheddar on top as I served it.   I did have to add just a little more water so it wasn't quite as thick.  I did sauté the carrots, celery and onion in bacon grease and butter.

I did make just a couple of changes. I used bacon instead of ham and added a half cup of half and half in addition to the milk. I also topped it off with some green onions. That was some rich, delicious soup!! Very Yummy and will certainly make it again!!

The potato soup was delicious, I will use this recipe again.  I used 'cracker barrel habanero' cheese instead of normal cheese  and the soup was still very good.

Love! Instant hit with the family. I made minor changes to the recipe based on what I had on hand and to make it gluten free. I used gluten free flour to thicken the soup. I used bacon instead of ham. I added green onion. The cheeses I used were provolone, mozzarella, and swiss. My goal was to have soup for lunch this week. I had to fight my family off and promise to make more tomorrow night for dinner.

Amazing!  My non soup loving husband requests it. I use whatever meat I have on hand...sometimes ham, sometimes sausage, sometimes even leftover burger. Very good!

I love this soup! I used 1 32oz container of chicken  broth and 2 cups of water in place of the chicken bouillon and added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic. I also added three cups of white sharp cheddar. To add protein, I added broccoli, chicken and bacon. I wanted vegetables too, so I added one cup of carrots and one cup of corn!!!

Another thing you can use to thicken the soup is to use corn starch. For thicker soups mix The cornstarch and water into a ratio of two parts cornstarch one part water. To make it thicker and more cornstarch, To make it thinner and more water.

This is by far the BEST potato soup I have ever eaten! First, I fried up the bacon, then sauteed the celery, onion, potatoes and some carrots in bacon grease. I added the water and McCormick's chicken base, the flour and milk mixture.  Toward the end, I added the cheese and let it melt.  I sprinkled shredded cheese and bacon on the top.  WOW!  Yummy!

It was delicious but I changed a couple of ingredients. I used carrots instead of celery. I didn't have chicken bouillon cubes so I used chicken seasoning and chicken broth. I also used cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. Delicious!

I love this recipe! I did make a few adjustments; 1. I used a tablet of the chicken bullion and I only put half a cup of cheese in the soup but I had some on the side for those that wanted more.

I made this without celery (didn't have it) and diced chicken kielbasa. Did not add salt. It was super salty - if I make it again, I will use less bullion.

Great recipe.  I omitted Celery, added a few teaspoons of garlic and cooked the veggies until puree.  I used heavy whipping cream in lieu of milk.  I served these in bread bowls! Delicious.  My husband requested some hot pepper flakes instead of black pepper next time to add some heat.

This was great! So easy and tasty.  It is pretty thick, while cooking the veggies I had to add an additional 1/2 cup water and another cup milk at the end to get it the consistency we like.  With or without changes this is a keeper.

This was very good.  I made it as written except I used red new potatoes (didn't peel) and I used mild cheddar cheese.  This made about 4 servings plus a little left over for tomorrow's lunch.  I will make this again.

This was my first potato soup, followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it. Was concerned it wouldn't be the right consistency but it was perfect. Might consider reducing the cheese a bit next time just for my waistline's sake.

Nice and creamy! This recipe is easy to customize. I mashed about half of the potatoes in the pot for an even smoother texture. Add different kinds of cheese for different flavors and top with whatever sounds good! One recipe only made about 6 cups of soup... Do yourself a favor and double or triple it! The ingredients are cheap and the soup warms up well.

This is my "go-to" recipe for potato soup.  Very hearty and cheesy.  I do thin it a bit sometimes.  It is a great recipe as-is if you want a thicker soup.  I sometimes add smoked turkey sausage instead of ham. It too is very good.

I think that it really needs a bit more water for cooking the vegetables--mine almost burnt, but I caught it. Otherwise, good soup.

Very easy. I had no ham, so I threw in some bacon bits. Worked great.

Love!! My mom used to make potato soup and it was ok but I was looking to make something out of the norm from my usual dishes so I tried this! I used almond milk instead of regular milk and cornstarch instead of flour(gluten free). I hate onions and celery (kind of picky I know!) so I ombitted those and used onion powder and garlic. I've made it twice more, once with mushrooms and once with broccoli and both were just as good. 

Note: I was having trouble with the soup staying together, could be the almond milk..so I just added a little more cheese and it came together better

I doubled everything for our family of 7 and tripled the water/bouillon, used red and gold potatoes with skins on.  Used Spinach-Feta sausage instead of ham.  Added broccoli also, sautéed celery & onion.  Cut back milk to 2 cups (doubled would be 3c) and added 1 can Cream of Celery, plus 1 can Cream of Chicken soup to the milk/flour mixture, mixed until smooth & added to stock. I took advice from other cooks and used a masher before adding milk to cut down size of potatoes - but leave them chunky enough for potato chunks, don't make mashed potatoes!  It helped thicken it up - perfect consistency.  Necessary to season this soup - used Onion powder, garlic powder, ground pepper and a lot of salt.  Add sausage not long after milk & soup mixture and let simmer on low, so the meat spices & tastes permeate soup.  Add cheese before serving.  EXCELLENT!!!

Fantastic! Hearty and flavorful! Will DEFINITELY make again. I made a few minor changes... I didn't have ham, so I chopped up a 1lb package of keilbasa and doubled the recipe. I used red potatoes and left the skins on. Instead of adding raw flour--I cooked it with some butter to create a roux. Those were the only changes. LOVED!

Very easy recipe! I made a few modifications, substituting mushrooms for the celery because I had some on hand and chicken stock for the bouillon.  My husband absolutely loved it!  I am planning to make it again, substituting clams for the ham, and corn for the celery.  A great way to use up Easter leftovers!

I omitted the onion, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was some of the best potato soup I've ever had. I want to try it again and add some cooked bacon instead of the ham just for something different.

This is a great recipe!! I used red potatoes in a pinch but it was still delicious. I use cream and milk and I sauteed my veggies and ham in a little evoo or butter if I'm being bad. I also use a TOUCH of smoked paprika for a great addition.

I absolutely love this dish, and so does the rest of my family.  I always triple the recipe in order to feed my large, hungry family, and we never have left overs.  I cut the potatoes very small, which cut down on the simmering time a lot, and I leave out the ham in order to accommodate the vegetarians in the family(I saute it and leave it on the table in a bowl for anyone who wants to add it to the soup).  I also always use cheddar cheese, not American.  I have made this soup many times, and will continue to make it for years to come!

Very tasty.  I used 2% Velveeta for the american cheese.  I also added about 2 cups of real crab and about 1/4 up of cooked bacon pieces.  Be sure not to use too much salt when adding because the cheese is pretty salty too.  I'd make this again.

Delicious! I did not use American cheese, but rather shredded mild cheddar cheese. Did not saute the onions beforehand like some of the reviewers said. I will probably do this next time. I also added two gloves of garlic. Garnished with cheddar cheese and serve with a toasted baguette.

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made were to use fresh parsley instead of dry, and I added a bit more water than required. However, because I did, I  found it to be too thin.  I won't make this mistake again.  My advice, make the recipe just like it is and you will love it!

This was really good and tasty!  
I like a thinner soup so I doubled the water and bouillon and reduced cheese to 1 cup like a previous reviewer did!
Everyone in the family loved it on this chilly night in Texas!!  Homemade cornbread went well with this too.

I really enjoyed this recipe, I did make some changes. I sauteed the onion and celery in a bit of butter along with a little crushed garlic.   Instead of using bouillon/water, I substituted enough chicken broth to cover the potatoes....I just plain forgot the bouillon while at the store.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This is my very first recipe to follow and make! I'm a newbie to the cooking world and craved this soup so this one looked promising!. I made it for me and my boyfriend of 8years and he couldn't believe how good it came out! I followed all the steps but added more liquid both parts equally as others did and used ham.. lets just say this is the 3RD time I'm making this again! perfect for cold days/nights and the ingredients are always something you have in your kitchen. Highly recommend at least once!

This soup was incredibly delicious! I substituted the water for vegetable broth and used beef bacon (pre cooked) instead of ham. I also deglazed the pan I prepared the bacon in and added it to the soup. Threw it all in the crockpot on low for four hours, adding cheese in the last ten mins and it was fabulous! I will definitely be making this again.

I used chicken broth instead (2 cans) and I added some ground beef (I didn't have ham, but next time will use that).  I also added cheese into it, then a little when it was done for topping (I love cheese and so do my kids).

I wasn't sure at first because it didn't look like it was thickening up, and it took about an hour and half for it to be ready.  Oh, and I did add some carrots because I love carrots :)  Anyway, it was great.  I loved it and it will be a perfect dish this winter when it gets cold.

Awesome recipe Marge. I had been looking for the perfect potato soup and by golly I've found it. Only thing different i did was add .5 tsp of minced garlic and instead of the ham i used bacon bits. Turned out great!

Yes ! It took little time to make and fabulous flavor I doubled the potatoes and added an extra amount of chicken bouillon. I also added ham small cubes served it with cheese and bacon bits and small ham/ cheese pannini type sandwiches on French bread ! Great on cold day ! 5 stars!!

I was worried it would taste too plain but it wasn't. I really like thick soup and this did the job. I did add 2 strips crumbled bacon and the bacon fat. I used 3 tsp flour. Part american cheese and part cheddar. I didn't rush cooking it. I will definitely make this again.

FANTASTIC!
Changes I made were:
-used dried minced onion in place of chopped onion... 1TBSP = 1/2 cup of onion
-left out celery (because I don't like it) 
-used chicken broth instead of water + bouillon, as other reviewers had suggested (thank you)
-cheddar cheese in place of American (I honestly don't think I've ever seen shredded AMERICAN cheese)
-and used half & half for about a third of the milk... just to make it richer tasting
-Also... I sautéed my flour in a little butter on the stove before SLOWLY adding the milk... it makes it smoother with no lumps
And you can buy the ham already diced in the package. 
I quadrupled the recipe for a ladies retreat at church... it wasn't hard at all & well worth the effort!
Thank you Marge, for sharing this delicious recipe!

Just what I was looking for. 
A low calorie, but flavorful potato soup.  
We did add more water and milk, and substituted a garlic sausage instead of ham.  Other than that, recipe was perfect, easy, and liked by all.

This was wondeful!  My guests also raved about it.  I used all the ingredients called for (except the ham and I used chicken broth instead of water/bouillon) but made the following changes in preparation:  I sauteed the onion and celery in bacon grease, then added the flour.  Then I stirred in chicken broth (3 cups) and the milk and brought to a boil.  I then added the potatoes and spices and simmered until the potatoes were tender.  I stirred in the cheese and served with bacon bits and green onions.  AWESOME!

Eating this now and love it. I had lumps in the flour mixture that I could not get rid of. Maybe a roux to start next time? Gonna tell hubby they are dumplings, lol. Used immersion blender for creamy with some chunky left.  Very good!

Loved it! I used bacon instead of ham. It comes out thicker and that is what I was looking for. I also put some ranch dressing in the leftovers and it was delicious.

I really like this recipe and changed it just a wee bit. I used organic chicken broth due to the large sodium content in bouillon, and that eliminated the water as well.  I used half and half instead of milk (which added more milk fat) but made it creamier. I also bought hormone free lean bacon(real) pieces and let everyone add what they wanted to their's. I doubled the recipe for more people and ran out quickly!

Super delicious and super easy!  The only thing I changed was adding broccoli like another reviewer suggested, and I think it really added another dimension to the flavor.  Boyfriend loved it and we'll definitely be making it again.

Very easy to follow, this was my first potato soup.  I doubled the recipe and used cheddar instead of American because that's what I had on hand and added more celery because I like it in soup.  This was fabulous, my family loved it.  Next time I will add carrot too.

Made this tonight!  Went over very well with my kids :)  I did add some diced carrot and used velveta instead of the shredded cheese because it's what I had in the fridge.  Very good sprinkled with a little extra crispy bacon!

I had lots of potatoes around the house and was looking for a soup recipe.  I love this one because I already had all the ingredients in the house and even improvised.  I added carrots and used bacon instead of ham.  I also blended the soup before adding the cheese and meat.  My 3 year old and 1.5 year old boys loved it and they are so picky!  Great recipe!

This recipe was simple, but I wished it would tell us exactly how long to cook the potatoes, celery, and carrots, instead of telling us when they're done. Everyone enjoyed the soup.

Yummy!! My only observation is the serving sizes must be small, I doubled the recipe and with a standard bowl it will yield closer to 7 servings. So good!!

This was awesome!!  The finished product looks a whole lot better than when it's cooking.  I had my doubts but by the time it was done, it tasted great.  I did follow other's advice and omitted the salt.  You can always season at the end.  Instead of celery (which I am not a fan of), I used cauliflour.  I also added the minced garlic, and used cheddar cheese as others have suggested.  4 kids and they all loved it

Very tasty! DH added beef broth and made it in a crock pot. It was so delicious but definitly needed that flour for thickness. We accidently omitted the cheeese and it was still great.

I made this recipe without the ham or hamburger. Instead, I added some crumbled bacon on top when serving. Delicious!

This was a good easy soup. The only changes I made was that I used about a cup of sharp cheddar instead of the american cheese and I added a couple cloves of garlic. It was a tasty, hearty soup. Yum.

this was a good recipe to make when i was pretty much out of groceries. i used some frozen chix broth from the freezer and added some carrots and fresh garlic. i was out of onions so i had to use onion powder instead and that worked fine. 3 slices of american cheese was enough for us. i liked that i didnt have to make a separate roux. i will make this again when i have ham in the freezer.  i added the ham with the veggies to let the flavor simmer in but left out the salt. i would recommend trying that.

Doubled the recipe and turned out excellent! Used cubed Velveeta. I omitted the ham as we topped with crumbled bacon. In addition to the bacon, we topped this main course soup with shredded cheddar cheese sliced green onion, and sour cream, delicious! Reheats well in the microwave.

Very good soup.  I didn't have American cheese, so I substituted half cheddar and half Velveeta.  I only added a little bit of ham which I diced very small.

This is the first time I ever made potato soup and it is without a doubt the BEST I have ever had.  The only thing I didnt put in was the salt because of the cheese and ham.

Very yummy. I sauteed the onion first. I also  doubled the water amount, used FF half and half, FF shredded cheese and used turkey bacon. Next time I will double the recipe so we will have left overs.

Made this recipe tonight, it was delicious, but I thought it was a bit too salty, and I made it exactly as the recipe says. So next time I will use half the salt.

Loved it!!  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I also made some variations:  sauteed the onion/celery, increased the liquids & meat, and simmered it a bit long all put together.  Was very very tasty!

This was really good. I made a few changes...used cheddar instead of American cheese, bacon instead of ham and added broccoli. The raw broccoli went in a minute or two before the cheese and it cooked perfectly. I also started with a bit more water so it was less thick.

YUMMO!!  My family raved, especially my six year old!  I did add some fresh sliced carrots which I sautéed in butter along with the celery and onions.  I also added one more cup of water and one more bouillon cube like some other reviews suggested and the last change was that I used Marble Jack cheese instead of American because that is what I had on hand.  This also made great leftovers the next day!!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe last night and my husband and i both loved it.  I used Real Bacon pieces instead of ham or hamburger.  The reason i give this a four is because the directions are a little confusing.  Once i added the milk and Flour, i wasnt sure if i should have left the heat on low or changed it higher.  Also, there wasnt even an estimated amount of time for how long it would take for the soup to thicken so when my soup thickened a littlei wasnt sure if it was how it was supposed to be or if i should have left it longer.  This turned out yummy anyway though, the only thing i would change next time would be to omit the  celery and to add extra potatoes.

I must have done something wrong. We usually really like potato soup, or anything with potatoes, but this was bland and had a grainy texture. I did leave out the ham and celery, but I don't think that those would have made a huge difference. Probably won't make this recipe again.

This was my first time making this. It was a great recipe. I wasn't sure how long it would take to cook. I cooked it too long and apparently made mashed potatoes. None the less good mash potatoes. I will know next time though. This recipe cooks quicker than I thought. Excellent recipe though!!

Loved the soup. I tripled the recipe to use as a meal. I served with Italian chicken fingers. The only change I made was to leave out the cheese and ham. Just wanted a pure potato soup and this was it. I will add the cheese next time.

Loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't find it too thick at all, if anything it could have been thicker.  Not exactly a healthy choice, but awesome for a once-in-a-while treat dinner.

Wow, this soup saved my day! My in-laws came over without warning, and I had 30 minutes to cook dinner and spruce up the house. When they tried the soup, they said it had to have started it before they arrived, because it was amazing!  Will definitely cook again!

Delicious! Doubled recipe for left-overs!I didn't have bullion, but used a can of chicken broth and a can of water. I also didn't have onion, but grated half of a carrot into soup. SOOOO tasty! Thanks for an awesome recipe! :)

Great soup. I put the potato/onion/celery base in the blender before finishing with milk, flour etc. I did this so my kids,  who do not like onions and celery in soup, wouldn't notice. So I had a less chunky soup. Also, I added a cup of Hormel's diced, cooked bacon for ease. The soup was delicious.

This was delicious. I always order baked potato soup at restaurants but this is better than any I've had.I did add an extra cup of water and an extra boullion cube.It was still plenty thick.

This was excellent!  I made a few changes: I substituted the celery and flour for a can of condensed cream of celery soup, and reduced the milk to 1 cup.  I added the soup at the same time as the milk, then when it was heated through I mashed it up with a potato masher before serving it in bread bowls with cheese and bacon bits on top (I didn't have any ham). And the soup was even better warmed up for lunch the next day.  A definite keeper!!!

This recipe is wonderful as is.  The only thing I did different is I added a little heavy cream at the end to thicken it more.  I will make this recipe again and again and again.  And I will share it with all my friends!!

This soup was easy, fast, and delicious.  I  am a vegetarian, so I substituted veggie stock for the bouillon + water and I omitted the ham.  I used 7 slices of American cheese and shredded them up before adding to the soup.

I made a vegetarian version using vegetable boullion and vegetarian bacon.  Also, I doubled the water and boullion to have a thinner soup.  Great recipe for those days when you need to use what you have on hand.

I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the celery and onion first.  Instead of using the chicken bouillon and water, I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth.  It was very hearty and my husband really liked it (not usually a soup-for-dinner guy).  Next time I will also add green onions to increase the veggie-quotient.

Delicious easy recipe.  Based on other reviews, I sauteed celery and onions (along with some carrots) in 2 T butter, then added the other ingredients.  I used 2 cups water, 2 bouillon cubes because I don't like my soup too thick.  For sure double if you want leftovers.  Very easy and quick.  Served with garlic cheese biscuits.

This is a quick, easy and yummy recipe. One note is that this is a relly thick soup...I doubled the water and used bacon instead of ham. I also cut back the cheese to 1 cup. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was delicious!  We doubled the recipe and also used 4 cups of ham left over from Christmas.  It cooked up quickly and then we transferred it to a crock pot.  I had to keep my husband from eating all of it before we took it to a friend's house for dinner!  I highly recommend this as a good potato/ham chowder!!

This is delicious. I never made potato soup before, but this will definately be a winter meal. I had leftover ham from Christmas and thought I would try to make a soup with it and your recipe was the best...Even my husband ate it. He went back for seconds..........

I loved this soup.  Thick and hearty is definitely an accurate description... along with YUMMY!  Even hubby, who doesn't 'do' soup, said he liked it!  Will definitely be making this any time I have ham left-overs.

Absolutely Fabulous!  Now my family's favorite soup.  I used canned chicken broth and doubled the recipe, and actually used 3 cans of broth.

Good base recipe.  I used 2 cups of water and then about 3/4 of sour cream to my milk flour mixture.  I also used some minced garlic and nacho cheese mix instead of american cheese.

My mom used to make soup like this and for years I've tried to recreate it without complete success... now I've done it, with the help of this recipe. 

Of course, as others have done, I had to make a few changes. First, I doubled everything to ensure there was enough for leftovers (why go through all that chopping for just one meal?). Second, I added about 1 cup extra water so that I had enough to cover the vegetables when they were simmering. Third, I added about 1 cup of diced carrots and 1 cup of frozen sweet corn. I also added 1 cup of light sour cream, but only because I had it in the fridge and needed to get rid of it. I didn't add any extra salt since I used ham boulion instead of chicken, but it worked out well since the ham I used wasn't very salty and each diner just salted and peppered to taste. Finally, I lightly mashed the potato mixture in the pot just to give it a nicer texture. I left some chunks though. 

I paired this with some beer bread mix from the grocery store and my husband was thrilled to come home to all these wonderful smells coming from the kitchen.

This recipe is very similar to the Delicious Ham and Potato soup on this website, which I make on a regular basis. I tried this one to mix it up a bit.  I sauteed the onion and celery a bit before step 1. The cheese was a nice addition, I used mozzarella and parmesan b/c that's all I had, but it still turned out pretty good.

This recipe is going to become a winter staple in our house.  It's incredibly easy to make and is delicious! We're vegetarians so I substituted vegetable bouillion and added veggie bacon instead of the ham.  Also, I substituted cheddar cheese for the American.

FINALLY, a homemade potato soup recipe that I like! I'm a big potato soup fan at restaurants but I've tried and disliked several recipes I've made at home. I'm so happy to have one that tastes great and is so easy! I used bacon instead of ham, and sauteed the onion and some garlic in the drippings. I ended up having to add more water to the potatoes, but it was still thick and delicious. Next time I'm going to add some chives and leeks. Thanks!!

I used this recipe a little loosely (had some stuff in the fridge I wanted to use) and it turned out great. 

I used 2 lbs of new potatoes (skins on) and doubled the water and bouillon while skipping the parsley (didn't have dried parsley).

I used real cheddar (old/sharp) and added a bunch of diced green onion at the end with the cheese.

Delicious

This was a fantastic recipe!  I was really impressed that it could be so good without any cream like all the other potato soup recipes.  I used 1 cup of chopped bacon instead of the ham but I think the ham would be good also.  I used mild chedder cheese and about half as much as the recipe called for.

I tripled this, thankfully!  It's so good, with the additions I tossed in.  Corn, (SUPER FINE CHOPPED) broccoli, carrots, garlic, more chicken broth, and used 2% Velveeta instead of shredded.  Absolutely perfect on this snowy day.

Very good! I usually make mine very similar to this, only adding a can of cheddar cheese soup to the recipe and saute'ing the celery and onion in butter prior to adding the liquids and potato's. I've always used ham, but I think next time I'll try fried bacon pieces in place of the ham. Great recipe! Thanks!!

This is such a simple, easy to make soup that tastes so so GOOD! I used cheddar as i'm not in America. Also added some chopped Zucchini and smoked salami as that was what i had then. i've made many soups and for some reason, they don't turn out that good...this IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

This was so quick and easy to make!  I used 2 cups more potatoes and upped the water to compensate. I also sauteed the onions in 1 tbs butter and seasonings.  Only used 1/8 cup cheese because that is what I had but next time would do the same.  Left out ham but added crumbled bacon on top.

Its a great soup. I changed mine up a little bit by adding in carrots and finely chopped poblano peppers....it added some heat. Instead of ham i used bacon, and actually cooked the veggies with the bacon in the pot. Everyone LOVED it.

Last week I made another potato soup off of this site that was excellent and was expecting this recipe to be not as delicious, but I was delightfully surprised!  I used a strong cheddar and guessed on the amount of cheese and ham.  You may want to cover and simmer this soup.  There is not much in the way of liquids and you don't want to completely boil all of the liquid off.  When I feel like potato soup, it will be difficult now to decide which one to make!

I used so many veggies in mine that it turned out more like a stew, still so delicious though. I didn't use any shredded cheese, still came out great. I also used baby red potatoes. Very tasty. I think this recipe is really easy to switch around to add things in. I softened the veggies in the pan though with some olive oil before adding the water. Just boiling them would have lost some flavor. Everyone loved it. Thanks.

Fabulous soup! I used 8oz. shredded cheddar cheese instead of american cheese, and it was the best potato soup I've even made! It's very thick and hearty, perfect for a winter soup. Thank you!

Love, love this recipe!!  I had to omit the celery because I didn't have any on hand and I also substituted about a cup of chicken broth, I doubled the recipe, for the chicken bullion because I didn't have that either.  I also sauteed the onions in butter before adding anything else.  One of my friends ate 3 bowls of this and then took some more home for later.  :)  Good stuff.  It's great on a cold winter evening.  I'll make this for many years to come.

This soup made for a very hearty meal on a cold day!!!  Like some others I made just a few minor adjustments as well.  I didn't use any ham and substituted American (Shredded) Cheese for Krafts Three Cheese Crumbles instead.  To compliment the meal I made Cheese-Garlic Biscuits by Bisquick.  My 6-year old thought he was in heaven!!!  Overall,it was great meal and I would definitely refer back to this recipe in the future.

This soup was delicious! It starts out looking pretty sad, and I thought I'd have a poor review but it all came together at the end. I cut the potatoes into about 1 cm cubes and did everything as the original recipe calls for, except for using cheddar and part whole milk. I used a chicken base (Better Than Bouillon) 1 tsp=1 cube bouillon. I dissolved it in the hot cup of water first, then added the vegetables. You have to watch the cooking time as the vegetables soak up most of the water and they could start to stick if you don't catch it in time. When I added the milk/flour mixture, I did not turn it down low enough (simmer), and it started to boil over.  My 15-month-old got her soup pureed at that point...she can be picky about chunks some days. Then I threw in the ham for my husband and me. We dipped sourdough bread chunks into the soup...baby thought it was finger-lickin'-good! I took my husband a bowl down at the shop; I layered the soup over slices of garlic bread so he could have a similar effect. He thought it was incredible. This recipe is easier than another potato soup I usually make since it does not call for a time-consuming cream sauce. We'll definitely be making this again! Thanks! Oh yes, I think it would feed four, not five.

Upped the liquid like recommended, and I wish I hadn't.  I had to add more flour to get it to a thicker consistancy.  Used a combo of extra sharp cheddar and processed cheese.  Omitted celery, since I didn't have any, but added some celery salt for flavor, as well as a couple of cloves of garlic.  It was a little bland, but quick and easy.

Keeper! Used a thawed pkg of frozen hash browns to save time. Cooked 3 slices bacon and browned the onion, celery, 1/2 of a quartered zucchini, and 1/2 of a quartered yellow squash in the bacon drippings (to sneak in some veggie nutrition). Served with garlic bread. Both kids (7&9yrs) loved it, so did hubby and I. Thanks for the post! Made a great-textured, stick-to-your-ribs, warming soup.

This recipe rocks!  I've never thought of soup as a "comfort food" before, but we do now.  I think it's only right to rate recipes as they're written, and this one was great as is.  We of course, like most cooks, tweaked it to our personal tastes and added some garlic powder, extra potatoes, etc.  Thanks so much for the great recipe ~ this will definitely be a cold winter staple on our menu!

Super recipe and super easy to make!I made a few changes:*  I used my left over baby potatoes from Christmas.  I boiled and seasoned with butter, garlic, basil, salt and pepper.*  I used 1/2 the amt of cheese (starting on my New Year's Resolution).*  I sautéed the veggies first.*  I garnished with turkey bacon.

Mmm.  Mmm. Fabulous!  Like a ritzy steak restaurante soup!  Added more water than called for here, but added quite a few more potatoes as well.  Did not add celery.  Sauteed bacon and garlic in bacon grease.  Cooked bacon to go with it, but not needed.  Allowed guests to decide whether they wanted it or not at the end.  Added a cup of cream as well to counterbalance the added water.  Somewhat mashed the potatoes as well. This soup was delicious -- something like a roasted garlic cheesy potato soup.  Garlic definitely added umpfh to the soup and would highly recommend trying that variation!

This turned out great! I love that is uses things that I would ordinarily have around. I did change a few things- instead of chicken bouillion I used left over turkey stock from Thanksgiving, and a little italian seasoning. I also used 4 slices of American cheese and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. The soup was easy to make and tasted great! Thanks for contributing!

Gobbled it up! Not even one little spoonful left. All 5 kids ate it without one complaint. Hubby disappointed that there weren't any leftovers. I will double the recipe next time. Followed it to a tee and used canadian bacon. YUMMY!

So good!  I ended up with 4 cups of potaotes and added 1 1/2 cup of water. I sauteed my onions in bacon grease before I put them in the pot.  After the potatoes were tender, I slightly mashed them.  I also added 2 sliced green onions and 1/2 lb of cooked bacon in the end.  I only used 1 cup of shredded four cheese blend.  Everyone loved this!  This will be my potato soup recipe from now on.

This soup was great! I didn't have any bacon or ham, so I left that out. Also, I used white cheddar cheese instead of the american cheese. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. Just remember that the cheese will help to thicken the soup at the end. I'm definitely making this one again. Next time I'll make sure I have some bacon on hand =)

The soup I made turned out wonderfully, but I changed so many things I'm not sure it's the same recipe.  Sauteed the celery and onions before cooking;  added 2 more cups of water; used half & half instead of milk; omitted bacon or ham, and used cheddar cheese; had no parsley so used oregano and thyme.  Like I said, it turned out great, and even better after a day.

This was mostly my fault. I'm a completely novice cook, and I bought the cheapest bacon I could get to add to the soup and cooked it on a George Foreman. It was way too fatty and I couldn't get it as crispy as I wanted in the first place. Also, I think I didn't cook the potatoes long enough. The soup itself came out pretty good; I used provolone instead of American cheese and I added fresh rosemary. I also used garlic instead of onions as I cannot stand onions. Going with ham probably would have been a better option.

This was okay. Although the servings are WAY off. I used 4 cups potatoes, and doubled everything else and their still was only enough for 4-5 soup bowls. Couldn't imagine serving even just two people with the recipe as is. I will stick with the Baked Potato Soup V on this site, and just sub the bacon for ham next time.

We skipped the ham altogether, and I used table cream in place of the milk, and cheddar in place of the American cheese. Also, I sauteed the onion, celery and potatoes in butter for 5-10 minutes before topping with the boullion. It was great for a cold day!  
Topped with chives and Frank's Red hot, my husband called it perogie soup.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a winter stand-by in our home. We love it. I use vegetable broth instead of chicken. Most recently I tried adding the shredded cheese to the top of the soup instead of mixing it in, and I like it much better that way -- what makes it even better is a few real bacon bits sprinkled on top. Mmm!

Love it!  My husband and I truly enjoyed this.  Instead of adding ham and american cheese I added crumbled bacon pieces and cheddar cheese. These ingredients did not affect the flavor it actually added to it.  We will definately eat this again.

This was perfect! I made this on a lazy night when the family had no idea what they wanted for dinner. We all loved it. You can add veggies or substitute bacon etc. So easy and flexible. My two year old has stopped eating veggies but he ate them in this soup. A big hit for our family. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was torn on what I should rate this recipe.  I, personally, was not overly impressed.  I made it as written with minor additions/changes.  I added carrots, used 1/2 and 1/2, and changed the cheese to cheddar.  I thought it was a bit bland and had to doctor it up considerably with additional chicken bouillion, extra salt and pepper, and a last minute addition of onion powder.  I rated it a 4 because my husband and 8 year old loved it.  My 6 and 4 year olds were indifferent (no reflection on the recipe or the cook).  It was definately comfort food that would suit on a cold winter's night.

Very good recipe using small list of ingredients. It was quick to make and satisfied the hungry stomach. I added a clove of minced garlic and used Velveeta for the shredded American. We stirred in some pan fried smoked sausage topped with shredded cheddar for extra 'zing'!

Delicious! My husband and I enjoyed it in front of a crackling fire.  I made a couple of changes. I used 1 tablespoon fresh parsley instead of the dried.  I doubled the recipe and instead of using 3 cups of cheese, I used 2 - it cut down on the fat a little and was still excellent.  I omitted the celery because I don't like it and used 1 medium onion.  Also, like others, I sauteed the onion and carrots in olive oil first.  Thanks for an excellent soup recipe!

I'm a big fan of potato soup, and this was really good. I did make some substitutions, though: I'm a vegetarian, so I used vegetable stock instead of chicken bouillon, and 1/2 cup sliced carrots instead of ham. I sauteed the onion, celery, and carrot in about 1 tbsp butter before adding anything else. I also doubled the salt and used oregano because I didn't have parsley. I don't like american cheese at all, so I used sharp cheddar.

Best potato soup I have ever made. I add about 3/4 cup of carrots, 1/2 cup celery and a cup of Broccoli and adjusted the amount of milk and cheese to make the right texture. Also garnished with crumbled bacon that I cooked earlier in the day.

Vegetarian Option

I used a vegetarian bullion (or you could use veggie broth) and 1% milk.  It was delicious.  I also used 1.5 cups of water instead of 1, you have to make sure you cube the potatoes small to get them to cook before all the liquid evaporates.

The soup was really thick. I ended up adding 1/2 the amount of cheese they recommended  and added more milk and it was still really rich and cheesy. I think next time Im going to try that idea of making it in a clam chowder that I can serve in bread bowls because it is almost a gravy consistancy

Very good!  I double both liquids (milk and water) and it still was thick but good.  I chopped up center cut bacon which didn't make it salty and I still added a bit of salt.  I will make it again!

I changed a few things to make it personalized. I added broccoli and carrots, left out the flour, and replaced the milk with evaporated. I also sauted the veggies before adding the broth. It was good with the revisions. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe! I did some modifications though. I first sauteed the chopped onions and bacon bits into a little butter, then I added the the chicken buillon which I dissolved in hot water. Added the potatoes and celery. And later on the flour mixed with milk.  Before serving, I put it in the blender.  It came really nice. Thank you for sharing.

This is excellent and easily adaptable.  I sauteed some bacon first (took it out, crumbled it and used it as a 'garnish' on top of the soup as I served it) and then cooked the vegetables in the bacon drippings and followed the recipe from there with the exceptions of using chicken broth instead of water and cheddar cheese instead of american.  I doubled the recipe and it was a good amount for 3 people for dinner with lots of good leftovers to take for lunch this week!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

I didn't have any ham so I put in bacon.  It was a very filling winter soup.  I added extra butter and cream to make it super rich, then pureed it in the blender to make it super creamy.  Thats just how I roll.  It was really yummy and I will make this again.  Maybe tonight.  :)

Simple, rich, and good.  I added a few different seasonings of my own preference to give it some interest.

Everyone in my family loved this!! I did make a few changes as my son doesn't like cheese in soup, so I grated some colby and served it on the side. That gave everyone a chance to make it as cheesy or un-cheesy as they wanted. Also, I didn't have any ham so I made this vegetarian style and served it as a complete meal with the brown irish soda bread from this site. This is a simple but flavourful recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

This turned out pretty good.  The only cheese I had on hand was velvetta, but still it turned out good.  This was pretty fast and will make again using different cheeses.  Thanks for the post.

All I can say is, "excellent"!!! This was so good. My husband and a friend tried it and they both loved it. I would double the recipe so there will be leftovers. Mine only ended up being 4 servings not five. Don't worry about it being very thick when you add the milk. After you add the cheese, and it sits for a bit, it thickens quite a lot. Thank you!

This is an excellent comfort soup, and is fun and easy to make. We don't use any ham but it's still plenty tasty. Also, we sometimes cut the amount of cheese down a bit to make it a little healthier. Goes GREAT with Tabasco Chipotle sauce!

This was the first time I had ever made soup and it turned out delicious! My husband, who isn't into soups, loved it. I did "spice" it up a bit by adding italian sausage instead of ham (idea from another reviewer) and it added such an incredible taste to the soup. I will definitely be making this easy, delicious recipe again!

This is the best soup that I have eaten in a very long time.  I keep going back to the stove and eating it right out of the pot!  I left out the celery because I didn't have any and the husband doesn't like it anyway.  Used about a half cup of chicken stock and a half cup of water.  Used Colby jack cheese because that's all I had.  A 5 oz can of ham was used in the soup.  Extra veggies probably would have been a nice touch, but aren't necessary.  My husband ate a lot of this soup and thinks that it's great.

WOW this has got to be one of the best soups ever!!! Followed others advice and used chicken broth instead of water, 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup milk, cheddar instead of american cheese, and cajun andouille sausage instead of ham.  Delicious!!!!! Husband raved, and barely any leftovers!!

This was an absolute HIT with my husband who had been craving potato soup. I had 8oz of polish sausage in the fridge, so I cut that up and added it to the soup instead of ham. Otherwise, I believe I stuck with the recipe. I did double everything, as suggested. It didn't seem to thicken up too much for me, but it still tasted great. Leftovers went to work with hubby the next day, he fully approved of the meal!

I love this recipe because it's yummy, easy and calls for ingredients that I typically have on hand.  I used cheddar in place of the american cheese and also added another cup of water and bouillon cube.  This is a keeper.

This is great. Made it for Christmas brunch. I didn't add the ham because I don't care for the extra salt.  May try with hamburger some time. Also, used half American and half sharp cheddar for a little kick.  Turned out great and perfect for leftovers too.  Thanks.

This recipe was great. I increased the amounts by using 2 cups water and 2 bullion cube, and a total of 2 cups milk. And it was still pretty thick. I could not find shredded American cheese, so I used shredded Colby/Jack. And I added a teaspoon of thyme. I will make this again.

Really yummy.  Very simple and quick.  Was very thick so I added an additional bouillon cube and water.  

I omitted the ham and topped with chives.  So yummy and filling.  Thanks Marge.
