My wife said that it tasted "restaurant quality", and I definitely agree.  I didn't have sake available, so I substituted Chinese cooking wine.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe precisely.  This is the best tasting fish dish we have ever cooked ourselves, and it took almost no skill to make it.  The best tasting butterfish I have ever eaten at a restaurant was served at Blue Ginger in Massachusetts, and I have to say the fish we cooked using this recipe was just as good.  We've been using allrecipes.com for many years, but I never registered for an account until now because I wanted to rate this recipe.  

One thing I noticed was that we had more marinade available than needed.  The black cod we used weighed about 19 ounces.  I broke it up into 3 different pieces and used a brush to very thoroughly cover all 3 pieces.  There was enough marinade left to cover 1 or 2 more pieces of fish.  Also, for reference, we had frozen our fish for a couple weeks before using it and it still came out fabulous when we cooked it.

Black Cod isn't my choice when I cook for clients.  Because it's extremely delicate and needs to be served immediately.  

But a  client saw this and asked that I prepare it for her.  

As a trial run I went with the recipe but discovered that it was too sweet.   In addition, the concentrated miso paste; even though I used the recommended amount of white miso & the one I chose was sodium lite - it was quite strong.

On my next run, I left out the wine, used only 1 1/2 TBS of brown sugar - wanted to keep the smokiness - included 
1 tsp of honey & 1 tsp of white cane sugar, kept the sake and let it simmer - while stirring occassionally - for a bit more than 5 minutes.  

Which allowed the three different sugars to begin to caramelize a bit and blend with the miso and sake.    

I liked the taste while it cooked.  Then when it cooled and I painted the filets to marinate & broil (on low) all the flavors were blending quite well.   

When it was time to take them out of oven - I found that each flavor including the fish - for me - now had an opportunity to make an appearance and pop.   

Each flavor dovetailed into the previous flavor, as opposed to having one/ two dominant elements.  

That's me.  Others love the recipe as is .  I was just looking for a way to keep the origins while finding a way to make it work for my tastes.

Amazingly delicious. I used coconut sugar instead of brown and hard cider instead of sake, and it was out of this world. We'll be buying black cod just to make this recipe. A small amount of fish per person was enough, it was so rich in flavor and juiciness. Served it with nubbly, chewy red quinoa and fresh salad with asian pears and avocado - perfect.

I found black cod at Trader Joe's and having never tried it, or cooked it, before I was happy to find such a tasty and easy recipe here.  I too used apple cider in place of the sake and Japanese wine as well as coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar.  This was wonderful!  I frequently cook dinner in two batches because we run a plate over to my elderly dad down the street so I did one broiled as recommended and one at 400° as suggested in one review....  I preferred the broiled version, though it did create a lot of smoke.  We'll definitely be having this again.

Made this for dinner tonight & it was excellent. Very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but had to cook it a few minutes extra. My husband loved it too. Will definitely make again and again!

Best cod recipe I've tried. Next time I'm going to bake it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes instead of broiling.

I made this for a dinner party of eight. I had to broil the cod for about 8 minutes per side, because of the quantity. I served it with brown rice and sautéed snap peas with garlic and sesame seeds with a touch of soy sauce. Rave reviews for the buttery, fork-tender fish! Great recipe for a party. Will do again.

Just finished eating dinner and had to rate this.  Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly as is.  This recipe is so simple and fast while tasting like a 5-star restaurant.  I just watched my husband go into the kitchen and eat up the left over sauce on the baking sheet.  This is going to become a new staple.

This was awesome! I used Alaskan Cod, and was very happy with the results.  I Would probably double the glaze next time, it was that good.

I did not have miso so I substituted 2/3 soy with 1/3 sesame oil.  Also used white wine since I didn't have sake on hand.  It was fantastic!

Delicious! Don't omit the part about lining the baking sheet with aluminum foil, the sauce burns and it near-ruined one of my baking sheets. But it was worth it!

The glaze tasted amazing, but there wasn't quite enough for two filets. I made some minor substitutions - I didn't have mirin or sake so I subbed in a mixture of cooking sherry, rice vinegar, and sugar for both, and it turned out fine. This recipe makes enough glaze for about one and a half filets, and some of it boils off under the broiler - make extra!

I thought this was great!  I didn't have white miso, i used what i had on hand (it was regular miso).  i found it a little salty but that may have been because i didn't use the right miso (so i didn't take a star off).  I also didn't have sake - didn't want to buy a whole bottle knowing i would use only a few tblsp so i substituted with a dry white wine and it was still great.  Very easy recipe that i highly recommend.

I read the other reviews, and I was a bit doubtful about all the claims, but I decided to try it anyway.  I live in the Seattle area, and I've had some excellent seafood, but this was far beyond anything I or my husband has tasted (fish-wise). Part of the wow factor is that neither of us have ever had black cod before, but now we are sold. Simply amazing!

This is one of the best recipes for Black Cod (Sablefish)! It's easy to make the marinade ahead of time and let the fish sit while the broil heats up. So delicious, it melts in the mouth! Will make this one again and? again!

I made this with some modifications. The main change is that the miso I had on hand was red miso, the darker, stronger-flavored variety, so I went with that. It tasted fine but the darker color is not as visually appealing so I won't post a photograph.
Also, rather than using foil on a baking sheet I used a cast iron griddle that I like. That may have made the fish a little over-cooked, but black cod is forgiving of overcooking, so it turned out fine.
In any case my customer (wife) loved it so I'm declaring success. I'll definitely make it again.
UPDATE: I did make it again, and this time I followed the directions of using foil on a baking sheet. It was much better as it wasn't overcooked. I've included a photo. I'll never second guess Chef John's directions attain :).  I've included a photo as well.

I have never made black cod and just purchased some lovely fresh fillets so checked on line and found this recipe .  I thought I had all the ingredients but was missing the sake.  I substituted dry vermouth and it turned out just perfect.  The fish was moist and so flavorful without being overwhelmed by the marinade.  I have another fillet and will get the sake.  Curious to see the difference.  I would definitely make this again and it was a big hit in this house.

Fabulous! A few changes: Double the recipe, and marinate chopped Bok Choy (4-6) in some. Strain and saute the bok choy, and serve all together with rice. Really great. For the recipe, I substituted dark/aged miso paste, and chardonnay instead of mirin. All of the sauce left over after marinating the fish & bok choy was reduced and used as a drizzle. Absolutely fantastic! I baked (close to the element) instead of broiled.

I had a thin piece of fish, made the marinade as directed, except halving the recipe and omitting the sake, and substituting white wine for the mirin. I broiled for only 5 minutes, and it was  deliciously carmelized on top and perfectly cooked.  This is really good!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars, even though I found it too sweet. My husband disagreed with me, he thought it was perfect. Next time I make it (and there WILL be a next time) I will either omit the mirin or use much less sugar, or both. I loved that I could make up the marinade early, which saved a last-minute step. It looked beautiful and cooked up very quickly.

Used 1tbsp white wine instead of sake and used a dash of lemon vodka. Less water. Mushroom miso was great. 6 min on each turnaround at 500 degree broil for total of about 12 min

I made this sauce as the recipe suggested. Not sure what I did wrong but I did t care for it at all. I did use regular cod as that was all that was available.  I have always enjoyed Chef John’s recipes. Maybe this just wasn’t for me.

Easy if you have the ingredients and wonderful flavors as usual. I was not trusting my cooking technique (black top, raw inside) so I sous vided the fish in the marinade first, then reduced the marinade, put on top, and finished in the broiler on high (when broil is instructed, I wish it were specified hi or low as my oven has both).

After following broiling directions, glaze was burnt, and fish was not done. Next time I'll broil fish for 10 minutes, then add glaze for 5 more minutes. I'll also use less miso -- way too salty.

This is probably THE best fish recipe I have ever made , outside of how I prepare my salmon, which is an entirely different fish and different profile.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.  Very easy and SO delicious!

Excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the fish was spectacular.  I had a little sauce left over, but my daughter ate it over rice the next day for her school lunch with a bit of furikake.

I made this for my boyfriend who loves to eat fish.  I have been cooking fish for him close to a decade and  this is the first and only recipe he requested to share with his friend.  The best part about this…  it was very simple to make!

I made this for my fiancé and best friend and they absolutely loved it and so did I! Soooo yummy! I will be making it again tonight! I also paired it with some very thin Japanese noodles that I put ponzu sauce and organic butter with green onions cut up in it and it was  delicious! I highly recommend

Did it with an exquisite piece of black cod. However, it was a bit too sweet for my taste.
