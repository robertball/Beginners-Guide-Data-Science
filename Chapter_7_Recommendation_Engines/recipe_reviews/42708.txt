I thought this recipe was great, I have used it several times, and it is always a hit. It's a little spicy, but a nice change from the same old dressing.  I plan to try stuffing a turkey with it in the future.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. It was such a hit!! This recipe is amazing! Sooo delicious! Next time I make it though, I think I will substitute sausage instead of ground beef. I added a little extra creole seasoning and it was perfect. I also think I chopped the pecans too finely. The toasted bigger chunks were great! Everyone should try this!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year because I'm not a fan of bread dressings.  I followed the recipe exactly and my entire family loved it!  They wouldn't let me take the leftovers home with me - Thank you for the great recipe!

Entirely too spicy and hot and the pecans gave it this really weird texture.

Discovered this recipe a few years ago and my family absolutely love it. This has become a staple recipe in my household for thanksgiving or Christmas...The only thing I changed was not adding the pecans. Everything else was perfect as written. Thanks for sharing.

This is a go to for me when I want to jazz things up a bit. I substitute group pork breakfast sausage for the beef for a little more bang.
