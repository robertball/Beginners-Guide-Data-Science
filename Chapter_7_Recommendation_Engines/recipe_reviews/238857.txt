The apple cider vinegar is too strong (completely overwhelming the lovely mango/other flavors).  I was unable to tell if the black beans were a good fit for this recipe, because my palate could not separate the ingredients.  I love apple cider vinegar, but the ingredient amounts as written are out-of-balance.

The basis of this recipe is good but the apple cider vinegar was overwhelming, especially with the lime juice. I think one could omit the vinegar entirely. The second time I made this for fish tacos I used lemon juice instead  and it was wonderful... 5 star worthy. So for this recipe as is I am rating it 4 stars.

made a lot of changes as I didn't have the bell peppers or fresh cilantro.
made up the volume of the recipe with extra  corn,black beans and half a poblano pepper.
omitted the vinegar as per other reviews.
It was  fabulous ! everyone loved it and will make it again.
