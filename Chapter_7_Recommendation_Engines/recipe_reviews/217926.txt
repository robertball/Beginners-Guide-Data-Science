This is good but watery. Make sure you drain your tomatoes through a cheese cloth first. Not too spicy and it has a good flavor.

The salsa was great with just the right amout of zest.  Easy for beginners.  We did not have a problem with being too watery just boiled a bit longer.

This is a good first timers recipe. as with any salsa, if its watery, try another type of tomato or combining several types. I prefer adding amish paste with better boys/girls,  50/50.

Was okay.  Needed to marinate longer.
