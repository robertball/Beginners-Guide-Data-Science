I have made these twice - the first time following the recipe exactly as written and directed and the second time making a few changes.  If you're looking for a very soft hamburger bun, closer to the kind you get at the store, these are good but as was reviewed by others, it will have a tough time holding together something juicy - as did mine the first time I baked and used for burgers.  They would make a great bun for a sandwich and the especially the kids would love this recipe as it's alot like store buns - which is one reason I didn't rate higher above average.  The reason I bake is because I don't want store bought taste, but if you like that, then these buns are great.  These would make an excellent dinner roll too.  The other reason for the average rating is the ingredient Vital Wheat Gluten.  This ingredient is not at all necessary in this recipe and is mainly used to lighten texture in whole grains or heavy wheat breads, so I left it out the second time around.  Instead, I added a beaten egg white (use a wire wisk, beat until foamy). It added a great texture.  I also used butter instead of the oil and slightly warmed milk instead of the water.  Made the buns richer in flavor.  Also, I used instant yeast and didn't have to pre activate the yeast, I just tossed it all in my kitchen aid, gave it a rise, shape and rise.. then baked at 400 degrees for 12 minutes in order to achieve better color.  BTW, using instant yeast gives a much nicer rise.  Posted a couple pics.

Wonderful!!! I made these yesterday to serve hamburgers on. I did not need twelve of them so I made a half recipe. I only got 4 out of it. While making the half recipe in the bread machine the dough sucked the paddle of the bottom, so I took the dough and and let it finish rising. I thought the dough seemed a little stiff. So I got scared and started another batch. I decided to try a full recipe but had to use mostly wheat flour.( I did add more gluten) The full recipe made about 7 rolls. I think you would only get 12 if you made dinner rolls/sliders. The funny thing is that both attempts came out fantastic!!! I thought I was going to have to freeze some... but nope.My 4 yr old ate 2 yesterday. I also made a sandwich for lunch yesterday with one and plan on doing that again today.I will be making these again and soon because they are almost gone!

Sorry, the crumb on these buns was not substantial and they fell apart under a juicy burger with toppings. Might be ok for a slider or a hot dog, but not if you want a burger with all the fixings.  The juiciness kind of melted the bun.

I have never used wheat gluten with white flour before, this made for a very light texture. I used 2 1/2 cups of flour and made 8 hamburger size buns. But they were too sweet to eat with burgers. I will toast them with plain cinnamon or use them to make bread pudding.

I made these using my stand mixer by proofing the yeast in the warm water with just 1 tbs. of sugar then adding the oil.  I added the flour (1/2 AP, 1/2 WW) mixed with the vital wheat gluten and salt 1 cup at a time and used about 3 1/4 cups to get a lovely soft dough.  I got 10 nice size rolls.  This is a keeper thanks WFDM!!

These Buns are the best. I make them year round, but LOTS in the summer. I make them into hotdog buns and for burgers. Why buy at the store what you can make so much better Thanks to What's for dinner, Mom.

Great recipe the only change I  would make is to cut down the amount of sugar. Rolls had a sweet taste which I don't really want on my hamburger.

I have now made these buns 3 or 4 times and have to say that they are the best buns ever.  I don't understand the comments that these will not stand up to a hamburger.  Every time that I have made them I used them for hamburgers and they were perfectly fine.  They did not fall/break apart and held up until the last bite.  I should say though that when I make them I do not use the Vital Wheat Gluten.  I have always made them using white AP or Bread flour so do not find the VWG necessary.  Would certainly use it if replacing part of the white flour with whole wheat.  Thanks WFDM for posting this recipe, it will remain my go to recipe for burger buns.

This is a good utilitarian sandwich roll.  I did add an extra tablespoon of sugar to the recipe to get what I was looking for.  I crowded the small-sized rolls close together because I wanted to be able to slice them horizontally for Easy Ham and Cheese Appetizer Sandwiches like my friend Anita used to make.  This recipe worked well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for the first time for the Midwest Roundup MB & I had.  Since I was serving BBQ I thought a nice sandwich bun would be nice.   I really liked how these buns turned out.  The texture was exactly what I was looking for. This recipe is a keeper for me.

These are great! I mixed the dough in my KitchenAid stand mixer and let the dough rise for 30 minutes and then shaped them and let them rise again for 45 minutes. I did shape these into smaller dinner rolls and they were the most light, fluffy, tender rolls ever! I will be making this into dinner rolls again for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing What's for dinner, mom! Great recipe!

These are by far the best buns I have ever tasted. The only change I made was to use either olive or corn oil as a sub for the canola - I just don't like canola.  I make them in my KA since I don't have a bread machine. I proof my yeast, water and sugar first. Then add the vital wheat gluten, oil,salt and flour; let it rise and proceed as directed in step 2.  I spritz them with water while baking to crisp up the crust; they are delicious!  It's important to use the vital wheat gluten - I think that's what makes these so good! Thank you for submitting such a great recipe.

Do not alter recipe.  My first batch I followed one of the reviews. Replace water for milk, oil for butter, and vwg for egg white.  It did not rise well, was hard and did not taste good.  I through it out.  I followed the directions to a T and I got 4 beautiful buns, just the right size. I used one egg white to brush onto two of them and added sesame seeds.  See photo.  They taste good and will go good with my own ground up beef steak for hamburgers tonight. Recipe from America's Test Kitchen "Best Old-Fashioned Burgers".

Oh gosh, where do I start?  I make these at least three times a week, and we use them for everything--sandwiches, hamburgers, hotdogs, snacking...I haven't bought bread in months.  Super easy because they're done in the bread machine, and the texture is just as airy and soft as the buns from the store.  The flavor is perfect.  WFDM, this recipe is amazing.  Thank you for sharing it!

These are great buns.  I accidentally forgot they were in the oven, so the outsides got nice and crisp.  They are soft and not dense, which is what I prefer.  I didn't have any problems with them falling apart with a juicy burger.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I just took this out of the oven. I wish I would have doubled the recipe. I made bread, next time rolls and bread. I used White Whole Wheat flour and 2 tsp VWG. It only took about 2 1/2 c. flour. Very light. Thanks WFDM! I'll make many times.

I attempted to follow the recipe exactly, but my bread machine decided to slip a belt halfway through the knead cycle. I finished kneading by hand and let the dough rise in a greased, covered bowl for about an hour before following the rest of the directions. I did use an egg wash as I wanted to add sesame seeds to half the buns. These are exactly what they claim to be: Soft-N-Fluffy! I will definitely make them again!

I've made these twice- first as buns, the second time as dinner rolls.  The crumb is too tender for use as a hamburger bun, but they make the most wonderfully soft, cloud-like dinner rolls- just brush with butter straight out of the oven to keep 'em soft.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, WFDM- I will make these again and again.

I've made several of the hamburger bun recipes here at allrecipes & this one is by far the best if you want soft, fluffy light buns.  This is the 2nd time I made this, the first time I used Gold Medal Better for Bread flour, this time I used Central Milling Organic Artisan Malted Type 70 flour & added 1 tablespoon for the recipe.  I made this for 14 servings as I have a burger pan (6) and a hot dog pan (8).

It came out really great.  Soft and fluffy.  This is the best buns recipe so far that I've ever made.

EDIT:  I used a Cuisinart Stand Mixer for this recipe & added more water than called for in the recipe, so watch the water, they can be on the dry side, so you will probably need more water than it says.

First recipe I am reviewing!  These were AWESOME!  Light and fluffy as they claim to be.  I rolled out the dough and used a peanut butter jar lid to cut them out at about 3/4 inch thickness.  PERFECT!  Got 12 buns out if it.  Tried to roll as directed but just couldn't make them look good- need more practice I think! LOL  Will make these again.  I did not use all the sugar but only used 1 tablespoon.  Going to make for Memorial Day cookout now I had a trial run of these.

Oh My , I mean OH MY, I love the buns this made. Talked to a few people thank you all for the wonder help. I feel I started with a wonderful recipe and that was half the battle won from the start. Made it just as written no changes. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Really good burger buns!  The only reason I didn't give the recipe a 5 is because I altered the recipe by using 1 c. wheat flour, 2 c. bread flour, 1 T sugar, 1 T honey and eliminated the gluten. the men in my family gave them 2 thumbs up:0)

These turned out great. I did modify, but only to suit our dietary preferences. I did half wheat flour, half bread flour, subbed agave for sugar, increased wheat gluten to 1 T to help wheat flour rise. I also let the bread machine do all of the work, and just formed the balls and flattened them before putting them on the pan for the 2nd rise. 
These buns turned out beautifully, and taste great. I made super-sized ones this time, and think I'll make mini ones next time, so it's easier for my little ones to eat (and more fun!) Thanks for the great recipe.

These buns are fantastic!  It took me a couple tries to get them right, but now they will be a regular at my house.    They are even just as soft the next day.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These are soft and fluffy and delightful!  I don't have a bread machine, so made them by hand, and they turn out beautifully!  I've tried a lot of recipes for buns and these have been the best by far.

Oh, these are so, so good, and very user-friendly.  They smelled so wonderful coming out of the oven, we broke one open and had it with butter right away.  Just couldn't wait for dinner.  At first I thought the dough was going to be too sticky to work with, but using "What's for Dinner, Mom"s tip about oiling the work surface produced a very easy-to-work-with dough ball.  I got 12 very nice-sized rolls.  Was gonna share 'em with a neighbor, but mmmmmmaybe next time!!!  Thanks, WFDM for the recipe and the great tips.

They turned out just as fluffy and soft as described, but pretty tiny. The batch I just made are big enough to be rolls, but not buns. I'll definitely make them again, but I'll be making fewer buns with this amount of dough. Either way, nice texture. I don't have a bread machine, so I just proofed the yeast with the water and sugar, then used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix in the flour, Vital Wheat Gluten, salt, and oil (I used olive), and used the dough hook for about 5 minutes, then let them rest about 45 minutes before shaping them.
Update: I made a half batch and got 4 standard sized burger buns. Ps; when these are fresh out of the oven they melt in your mouth! Wow! Can't get the tops to brown like I want, but it's not like the uniform whiteness compromises the flavour or anything, so I'm not too worried about it. But next time I'll try brushing them with a little milk to see if I can get the look I want. (new update: the milk hardly browned them at all. But I'm fine with white buns. No biggie!)

They were exactly like their name: soft and fluffy! I followed the directions except for adding wheat gluten, and they turned out perfect. Light, fluffy, and browned slightly on top and sides. I baked mine on a silicone baking sheet on the middle rack, and the bottoms were pretty white, but done. So if you want a little brown on the bottom, I would move my rack down one. As for taste, they reminded me a store bun: very subtle flavor.

I have made these buns many times since I first reviewed.  They always turn out great.  I started with using 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup AP or bread flour.  They were great.  I now make them with all whole wheat flour (usually the white ww) and 3 Tbsp vital wheat gluten.  They still turn out nice and soft...a little more dense than with AP flour, but we love the texture.  I always make 8 buns instead of 12...this also makes great hot dog buns.  It's just a great recipe and so easy.  We never buy store buns any more. UPDATE:  I make these buns in a regular basis, and I have never had them not turn out well.  In reading the reviews that stated they will not stand up to a juicy burger and fall apart, I have some tips that might help...be sure you take the time to form each piece of dough into a nice tidy ball and then shape it with your hand.  I made these yesterday and was in a hurry and didn't take the time to form them into a ball...some of these did fall apart for the first time ever.  We didn't care, they are still delicious.  It's all in the shaping!  :)

These are perfect! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I was looking for some sandwich buns for my kids school lunches. The first batch I made were wonderful but I only made 6 and they were huge. They would have been fabulous burger buns. The second batch I made 8 and they were a better size for us. 12 would have been tiny! I will make these over and over!

I really wanted to love these after reading all the great reviews....after 2 attempts and no alterations, they were just ok. They were not "soft-n-fluffy" and the flavor was a bit bland.

These are awesome!!!  I followed the recipe exact, except for the wheat gluten because I didn't have any.  They turned out great and the only thing I would change is the amount of buns it makes.. ours turned out to be on the small side even though I let them rise in a warm spot.  Thank you so much WFDM, now my multiple food allergic son is able to eat a hamburger bun for the first time in his 5 1/2 year life!  He's so excited!

I skipped the vital wheat gluten. They turned out great! I will be making these again. They did not turn out brown though, but no big deal since I will probably toast them before using.

03/16 AWESOME! they really live up to their name! I am eating one right now with strawberry jam. I used whole milk for water and brushed the rolls with butter when removed from the oven. Delicious! 03/22 I made the buns again today, used 1/2 ww and 1/2 ap flour, 1 tbsp vital gluten, my husband said these were even better! use 3 oz balls by weight for buns

These buns are so much BETTER than any buns you will ever buy at the store.  I have always been intimidated to make my own hamburger buns because it always seemed so difficult and time-consuming... I was wrong.  Since I've started reading the ingredients list of the store-bought version (which is downright scary, by the way), I decided to try making them myself and these are so easy and delicious I won't go back to buying them any more.  I follow the recipe exactly and then give them a quick brush with some melted butter after they're done baking, which makes them very soft.  I don't understand some of the comments that they don't hold up to a juicy burger, because these most certainly do - even sloppy joes!  Love Love Love this recipe!

The name says it all. I did add a bit more sugar and salt according to our preference, but then followed the recipe exactly after that. I thought they held up to a burger fine. They did wrinkle a little after cooling, but I will try steaming them before serving again. I realize "What's for Dinner, mom?" put a lot of effort and care into this one. My family thanks you!

Wow- these are terrific!!!  I did not have vital wheat gluten, nor have I been able to find it yet, so I simply omitted it, and these still turned out great.  The dough is very easy to work with, which is always a plus.  I got 10 beautiful hamburger rolls out of this recipe.  Thanks for sharing WFDM- I will be making these a lot!!!  :)

Great recipe for soft burger buns! I've used the formula as-is, but divide into 8 rolls, that are the perfect size for regular 1/4 - 1/3 lb patties. 3 cups of flour = 14.5 oz of flour on my scale, and that works out to be the right consistency dough. You can also brush the tops with melted butter before or after baking.

Very easy and tasty too. I didn't use a bread machine. I used a kitchen aid with a dough hook for 5 min and then let it rest for 1 hour then punched it down and created 16 dough balls. Next time I won't let it rest so long in between. Over all very nice recipe that I have already shared.

Oh yum - these were a snap to whip up.  I did substitute 1/2 cup wheat flour which made these a little dense, but just a tad.  Next time, will make exactly as directed.  We served with feta burgers topped with red onion, and arugala/spinach mix.  Outstanding.  Thank you so much for recipe - a definate keeper.  Note to self:  I made 3oz balls and came up with exactly 8 perfectly sized burger buns. UPDATE:  OK - just made another batch, completely as directed.  They looked beautiful, baked up nice and high, but when we went to eat, the tops were *rubbery*??? Bopping over to Buzz to see what I did wrong.

I've searched for the perfect hamburger bun and found them.  I've made these many times now and my family is very happy with them.  I always make 8 buns out of the recipe and they make the bigger size buns (which is what we like).  They hold together nicely with burgers and toppings and have a good texture.

I gave this one a low rating cause I had to doctor. I read the reviews,but tried it anyhow.  I kept in mind that the buns were not holding up well to the juicey burger, so, since I like simplicity I omited the the wheat gluten (that gets rid of the store bought taste)and put 1 Tbsp of yeast.  I more than likely added a bit more flour as I worked this out by hand.  They turned out wonderful.

Taste was good, but they were not light and fluffy at all.  More like a dinner roll.  BUT I did not use vital wheat gluten so I think that might be the reason.  Will try again with the gluten...

Super rolls! I did not use the gluten, did not have any, and I did use 2 tablespoons sugar. They came out perfect, never, well maybe, had better.

I followed recipe except did 1/2 white flour 1/2 whole wheat.  I also let them rise 1 hour as dough then another hour after formed.  They were awesome, better than store bought!  Fluffy, soft, light.....family loved them they devoured them!  Held up to our BBQ cheddar mushroom burgers just awesome!  We got 12 from recipe...they were the size average buns are supposed to be, not the oversize giant ones in markets today!

I made these buns today but had to use all purpose flour as I was out of bread flour.  They turned out great and tasted great warmed with butter.  I am looking forward to serving them to my family with sloppy joe's tonight.  Definitely a keeper.

These made fabulous buns - but I didn't get 12 buns - I got 8.  (maybe we like slightly larger buns than average?  I use SAF yeast, so I just used 2 tsp. instead of the 2-1/4 or 2-1/2 that most recipes call for.  We like them for making sandwiches, so I make them to fit sandwich meat)  One of the other reviewers commented that she brushed them with melted butter upon removing from oven, to keep the tops nice and soft - and this did make a great difference - and now I brush ALL of my breads and buns with melted butter when they come out of the oven - it really makes a fantastic difference and end result is such a nice tender crust!   Also, if you're thinking of skipping the parchment paper - DON'T!  It makes for a BEAUTIFULLY soft-textured bottom, makes it so easy to slip the buns off the pan onto cooling rack, very much worth the extra (small) expense.  I use each piece of parchment paper at least 2 or 3 times, so that helps.  Once you use them a few times they seem to lose the non-stick quality, so then it's time for a new piece.

I made this recipe exactly as the author listed it, except that I also added in 1/2 C shredded cheddar and about a 1/2 tsp garlic powder. 

These are so soft and fluffy! They are named perfectly. 

We'll be making these over and over again. Thank you for a lovely recipe.

I pressed mine down too hard & they were a bit too flat to be called "buns" however they were still soft on the inside.
I wonder if this recipe could benefit from the usage of BREAD flour instead of AP flour, if so then what would the amount of yeast change to?
Edit: I didn't add the wheat gluten, that must be one of the reasons I consider them a half fail or a C+ in rating.

Very easy to make and delicious but mine did not brown. I went 12 mins then 2 more, then spritzed with butter flavor cooking spray and 4 more. Just started getting a light golden color but then had to be pulled. They were still soft though so maybe 12 mins is not long enough at 350? Anyway thanks for the recipe, will save this one! Used for sliders!

Very easy dough to work with.  I don't use a bread machine - and for this dough, didn't use a stand mixer - just kneaded it by hand until smooth and elastic - only a few minutes.  I had never used vital wheat gluten in bread before - but I think this may be the secret to extremely fluffy breads.  I used this dough to do small slider buns, so got 24 buns out of it - and they came out great.  Next time, I'm going to substitute some ingredients and use butter instead of oil to try to get some extra umph out of it - but in all, stellar and easy recipe.

These rolls were indeed soft n fluffy.  I found the dough to be quite tough during the forming stage, so it was difficult to get smooth balls and so turned out a little lumpy but they were still delicious.  I would make 8-10 burger rolls or 15 dinner rolls. 

I left out the vital wheat gluten because I didnt have any.

Fantastic! I made these in a panic after another recipe from this site didn't turn out to my liking. It is very much in texture like store bought rolls. Will double the recipe next time as to get 12 rolls they would be rather small. Thanks WFDM!

Used the calculate function to bring it down to two servings, which ended being three servings...no worries. These were good, but I did make them using an egg white as one reviewer suggested, and milk instead of water. Next time I'll try to do the "as written" and add to this review. This time I sprinkled some cracked pepper onto the buns before baking since I can't have seeds...gave them a little something extra in the presentation department. Will post a pic later. [[Sorry it took me SO long to get to these!]] However, worth the wait. // Okay...tonight (the very next week!!!)  I made the "as written" version...water/oil vs. milk/butter. The dough was a little stiff, but it rose fine, and the resulting bread was good. i think I need to perfect my shaping these...had better luck with my first batch, but WFDM, the resulting bun this time was plenty strong enough for a burger and tasted good. We are likely going to eat them as rolls...partly because I did not quite flatten enough. Will do these again. Thank you for posting.

Just as promised, these were Soft-N-Fluffy! I made by hand, subbed vegetable oil for the canola, only needed 2 1/2 cups of flour and formed into 20 slider sized buns. Thanks for an AMAZING bun recipe!

These are wonderful! I topped half with toasted sesame seed and half with carmelized onion. Hubby could'nt believe the taste. SO...well its all in the name. I brushed the tops with an egg wash to get the seeds and onions to stick to them. The bread machine makes it a snap to make these!

Amazing, so fluffy and moist at the same time. Held up well to large sliders with toppings.  The  dough was easy to work with once you get the constancy right.  Very soft but still holds its shape.

Just to let you know how much like store bought buns these were--my kids ate them thinking they were regular hamburger buns I'd bought at the store. I doubled the recipe and I have to admit I made them too big--they were giant buns. I got 6 big buns out of each batch and two smaller ones. I had two pans (6 each) that I brushed with egg white and water, sprinkled with sesame seeds, then baked as directed. They never browned one bit, but they were definitely done. The last four I baked at the temperature I normally use for homemade rolls--425°--and they browned very nicely. When my kids saw the last four, they remarked, "Mom! You made homemade rolls!" I told them they had already been eating homemade rolls (the non browned ones) and that's when they finally noticed they weren't store bought. We used them for sloppy joes, and they held up fine. They were soft and kind of bland, but...so are store bought. I make whole wheat bread and other kinds of bread weekly, and found these to be easy to work with without a bread machine. I used gluten because I had some, but I don't know if it was needed. I may add some whole wheat flour next time. I'll definitely make them again. Thank you!

I just made these and they turned out great! I did the egg wash and put sesame seeds on them. I needed to leave them about 20 minutes for 8 buns in the oven to get that golden color. 
I have no idea how to shape them correctly though and I forgot to flatten them a bit before letting them rise so mine are more like big rolls/buns but they will work great for burgers tonight. I can't wait to try these again!

The recipe is great, the buns tasted great, but my shaping skills are not so great!  I followed the recipe as written to use as mini buns to go along with 'Three Packet Slow Cooker Roast' another AR recipe. The buns had a really nice texture to them; I just need to work on making them look like buns and not rolls.  I will be trying this recipe again soon as we really like the taste, but I think I will try larger buns and see if I can shape them better.  
Thanks, What's for dinner, mom? for always helping me with my bun questions.  You've helped me on several occasions.  Someday, I'll get it right!

Great taste, but I recommend putting the balls of dough close together so they don't flatten too much. I removed them from the oven when I thought they were done rising, but they started to sink! So in the end, they didn't rise as high, but were still light and fluffy inside. I used milk instead of water and added an egg white. I left out the vital wheat gluten.

Loved them! I no longer have a bread maker so I used my KA with the hook and made 8 buns, 14 minutes. So light and airy and they stood up well with Sloppy Joe's. Due to a dietary restriction I subbed avocado oil for the canola. I make a lot of bread and this dough was a pleasure to work with.  Thanks for sharing your recipe WFDM.

I have tried so many hamburger bun recipes and while the dough was always good to work with, I always wound up with buns that IMO where too dense.  I was looking for something in between dense, and grocery store fall apart nothing buns.  This is it.  Beautiful, high rising, not too dense, perfect buns!  I followed the recipe except I used vegetable oil in place of canola oil.  I also added an egg white wash and sesame seeds before popping in oven.  I had to bake them a little longer to get them to lite brown but wow!  Perfect, beautiful buns.   My next Bach, which is in the bread machine kneading now, I’ve substituted butter in place of the oil to add a little more flavor.  Thank you so much for this recipe.!

These have an awesome texture. The only reason I didnt give these five stars is because we prefer something that tastes a little more yeasty, if you know what I mean

I make these at least once a week. I use my bread machine to knead the dough, then shape them for buns, rolls, hoagies, you name it. They make a quick go to for lunch bread if I’m pressed for time. I love this recipe. Turns out great each time!

I do really like these buns however made a few recommended changes like butter instead of oil and warm milk instead of water. I also used beaten egg white instead of the vital wheat gluten, never even heard of that stuff, didn't seem necessary. I also use instant/ rapid rise yeast which means I didn't have to activate the yeast. I used the remaining egg yolk as an egg wash and they turned out really well. I got 8 standard size hamburger buns out of the recipe.

I posted a picture, this is a better recipe than the ones I have tried so far. They are nice and fluffy, I froze them to use in two days. I will update you on freshness after being frozen. Thank you.

Very easy, and a bland, store bought type bun--recipe submitter gave full disclosure for those of you who are unsure.  I forgot to flatten them so ended up with puffy rolls (I didn't use vital wheat gluten), and 12 minutes wasn't quite enough to brown mine.  I took them out anyway; next time I'll have to leave them in longer or use the broiler or something.  Worked well for hubs' barbequed pork for dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these today and WOW! I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and proofed the yeast with the water and sugar for 10 minutes. Then added Coconut Oil rather than canola. Mixed the salt with the flour and kneaded in the mixer for about 5 minutes. I did not use the gluten. Then plopped it into an oiled bowl and let it rise for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, formed it into buns (I got 7 out of the recipe) and let them raise for 45 minutes. It was a very soft sticky dough, but I oiled my hands and then formed them into buns, worked wonderfully! Baked at 350* 12 minutes. I was very glad that I read the reviews before baking as I would have over baked them had I been waiting for them to turn golden brown. They really did not brown much but WOW ~ I had one with Irish Butter when it was still warm and am serving them with BBQ Beef for supper! This was the simplest bun recipe I have ever baked and to my surprise, they are the BEST! I will be making them again and again!

This is my new favorite.   I found that 12 portions make great dinner rolls but 8 portions are good for larger burgers.

I really like it. These were easy to make & while mine didn't rise too high, they were still great with the burgers we made. I'll load the actual burger pics later. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great. I have made them a few times now, exactly as written. They work great for us for meatball sandwiches and did not fall apart. I get about 8 sub buns or 24 small rolls depending on how I divide my dough.

I found these buns to be just what they claim in their name...soft and fluffy.  I made them into hot dog buns for Italian sausage and peppers.  My family loves them.  If you are looking for a hard crusty bread this is not it, but I think they are wonderful.  For my family this is a keeper.

They are just what the recipe says:  soft and fluffy.  Left in a plastic bag for a day or two, they became even softer, and of course they're a hundred times more delicious than the store-bought variety.  This recipe made eight *really* big buns, so next time I think I'll make ten or twelve.
