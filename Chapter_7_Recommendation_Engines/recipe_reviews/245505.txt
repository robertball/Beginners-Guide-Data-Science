When I told my husband the main ingredients were sausage and spaghetti squash, he groaned and said "Will you please stop experimenting with recipes".   Well.....I went ahead and made it anyway and HE LOVED IT! I added mushrooms to the sauce and decreased the broth to 1 cup like another reader had suggested. It was wonderful and now Mr. Grumbles wants me to make it "at least once a week". It really, really was good.

Italian Sausage Spaghetti Squash Haiku: "I've now made this twice. It's still pretty watery, even with changes." First time I made this I followed the recipe and it had way too much liquid when pulled from the oven; slotted spoon and splashes abound. Made it again, reducing the chicken broth to 1/2 c. and increasing the tomato paste to the full can, and while the sauce was nice and thick and still as tasty, the spaghetti squash itself just releases too much liquid on its own. It is a delicious dish, but I think it's better to just spoon the sausage sauce over the spaghetti squash rather than mixing it all together and putting it into the oven.

Took the idea and changed it a bit. Baked the spaghetti squash for 40 min then fried it up in a skillet with sausage, peppers, and onion with garlic. Added shredded cheese and jar of pasta sauce, then transferred to an oven safe dish. Put extra shredded cheese on top and broiled. Came out great!

I loved this recipe.   I didn't cut the squash lengthwise.  I microwaved the entire squash for 5 minutes to soften the skin and make it easier to cut.   I then cut off each end and cut the rest into 4, ending up with 4 rounds.  I salted them and let sit 15 minutes allowing water to escape.   I then baked them for one hour and followed the recipe.    Try this not cutting the squash lengthwise.   You will get much longer strands of the spaghetti as the strands grow around and not lengthwise   This is a  keeper.

Delicious. I see several people mentioned theirs was watery. To fix that, I salted the cut sides of the squash after seeding it and allowed it to sit for 15 mins. Then used a paper towel to wipe away the water and salt before roasting. Worked great! Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Great recipe! This can be made vegan as well. Just substitute vegan cheese, Tofurkey Italian sausage, and vegetable broth. Iâ€™ve made it 3 times now and I love it.

Very good.  Only had 1/4 lb. of sausage so also added 3/4 lb. of ground beef.  The sauce was loaded with meat and veggies, but was brothy.  It needed some viscosity and salt so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce along with an 8 oz. can of mushrooms,  1 tsp. dried parsley, 1 tsp. of seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp. of sugar, 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes, and simmered a total of 30 minutes.  I think the extra seasoning was needed because I didn't have a full pound of sausage.  I did reduce the broth to 1/2 c. but probably added a 1/2 c. of water rinsing out the tomato cans--hence the extra simmering to reduce the water and soften the carrots a little more.  Prior to adding the meat back and making the sauce, I pushed the veggies to the side of the pan and cooked the tomato paste in the center while stirring for 2 minutes and then cooked the garlic for 1 minute before adding the rest of the ingredients. While preparing the casserole I put about 1/3 of the sauce on the bottom, then the squash (which I salted because it really needed it), then the rest of the sauce.  I just left in layers and did not stir before adding the cheese.  Baked for 35 minutes in an attempt to reduce the water and brown the cheese.  Let stand 1 hour before serving.  Water was not a problem.  Must have been the extra cooking times and reduction of liquid by 1/2 c.  Served with grated Parmesan.  Tasty!  May add 2 Tbs. of flour next time and cook it into the meat after browning to help with the water issue.

Very yummy. I took out the onions and doubled the carrots and celery. The meat and vegetables were a little bit too liquidy, but next time I will use less broth and/or strain it before mixing it with the squash.

This was my first time making spaghetti squash. We loved it!! The sauce was delicious, and the sausage added just the right flavor. I did add less chicken broth like the others suggested, so it wasn't too soupy.

This was my first time trying spaghetti squash, and I really liked how it worked in this dish. I added dried thyme and chili flakes to the onion, carrot, and celery mixture but otherwise followed all the directions. It was very tasty! It WAS very watery though, and didn't thicken up as much as I thought it might in the oven. I'd recommend cutting down the chicken stock by a 1/2 cup at the very least.

My husband and Ioved this! We don't eat meat, so I used veggie sausage and veggie broth and it came out great. I skipped the tomato paste, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I made it deconstructed because of ages and food allergies. I made the meat sauce, baked the spaghetti squash and a pot of angel hair pasta. (So each person  could decide on spaghetti squash or pasta as their noodle and then I topped it with meat sauce, if they wanted, which they all did!) Topped each serving with either shredded mozzarella or manchego. My family gave a resounding yes to having me make this again!

Made ahead and refrigerated (2 nights) before cooking. I added a little extra time in the oven and waited to add the mozzarella until halfway through, but turned out great. Was surprised with the texture and flavor added by the carrots- flavors really combined well. I also used Hot Italian sausage instead, but I didn't really notice the heat.

Very good.  I modified by adding a heaping half tablespoon of Italian Seasoning Blend and half teaspoon salt/fresh cracked pepper.  Also drained a little bit of the liquid.  Not all of the liquid-just a little.

This was delishious I thought.  I added only about a half tablespoon of Italian Seasoning while  simmering.  I am a single man and this will be great for leftovers.

It was very good. I made changes due to personal tastes and what I had on hand, but the base recipe would be excellent as is. i didn't add carrots, celery, broth or paste as I didn't have on hand but I added extra Italian seasonings and garlic along with fresh mushrooms. I skimmed out the excess juice before baking and I loved it.  Almost like my favorite pasta without the pasta. Will definitely do it again.

I didnt use the chicken broth, as i felt it would make it too mushy. Turns out the oven baking did that anyway...
Tasted good, but the spaghetti was mushy. 
Next time ill broil it just the melt the cheese.

No real changes other than how I assembled it. Squash as the bottom layer, tomato sausage mixture next then cheese on top. Looked more like lasagna, tasted great!

Very good recipe.  Very hearty and filling. 

I made a few modifications. 

Salted the squash and let it sit for about 20 minutes. With a paper towel, I wiped the moisture from the squash. Used the entire can of paste, used less broth, used baby portobello mushroom instead of meat, forked the squash to a platter with paper towels and continued to dry the squash.  Eventually squeezed the squash to eliminate more moisture. 

Plan to use fake meat next time.

I made this with vegan sausage, vegan cheese and veggie broth.  Also instead of carrots and celery I used Bok Choy and zucchini (just out of personal preference).  I also accidentally got the can of diced tomato with green chilies and what a tasty accident.  Nice little kick to it!  Even my non vegan husband liked it which is always a plus :)  Will definitely make again! Yum!

I didn't have any Mozzarella so I used Parmesan, and I added some chopped Zucchini which made it a little too juicy, and I also added some chopped bell pepper.  We really liked it, but if I use zucchini next time I will cut the chicken broth to one cup.

my husband loves this recipe. I just used three of the largest spaghetti squash I could find in my store so it was more of a pasta to sauce ratio.

I added 4 zucchini, a red pepper, and some chopped spinach to give it more veggies. mixed some cheese into the the mixture in addition to putting it on top so that it would adhere to itself a bit better. only 3/4 c. liquid (half water, half broth). It was still runny, but delicious!

I made this with sliced kielbasa and cheddar cheese because that's what I had, and I thought it was great. The squash turned out lovely and al dente. I don't recommend the cheddar cheese substitution - not as good as mozzarella, but still acceptable in a pinch.

Made this as a GF spaghetti alternative for my husband. He loved it, I thought it was ok, too watery, and full disclosure, Iâ€™m not a squash fan, so...may try again and 1/2 the recipe so I can eat regular spaghetti, LOL.

Many comments about a watery dish made me cautious, so I simmered the sauce until it was thick and it came out great.

I have learned with spaghetti squash after noodling it, strain it, press a paper towel on top of it and it cuts down on the watering.  I used a sweet Italian sausage and since I was doubling the sauce part to freeze half later, so I also added a jar of garden chunky spaghetti sauce.  To keep it healthier, sprinkled Parmesan on top instead before baking.  Winter cozy food without the guilt!

I hurried this along by making the spaghetti squash in the microwave while the meat sauce was cooking and then finishing it off in the skillet instead of the oven.  Tasty!

Love this recipe, itâ€™s a hearty meal. My husband loves it too. I made it as per recipe with one exception. I used Italian sausage made from turkey. It came in links, so I just removed the casings. Delicious. I told my husband after he ate it that I had used turkey sausage, and he said he wouldnâ€™t have know it had I not told it. Itâ€™s now on the regular meal rotation.

I have a husband who hate squash. However, I tried this recipe and voila he loved it! A bit watery yes but work around it. It doesnâ€™t interfere with the presentation or flavour! Will make it again! Used  Italian sausage cut thinly instead of ground sausage and wow the men in the house went nuts!

Iâ€™ve never made spaghetti squash before and itâ€™s delicious! Even my EXTREMELY skeptical husband liked it!  I did use only 1/2 cup of broth, but otherwise made it just like the recipe says.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is FIRE! Super easy to make but the flavour is on point. I didn't have any ground sausage so I used sliced italian sausage instead. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the tee and I wouldn't change a thing! (rare for me). Tastes like pizza but loaded with nutrition. Adding this recipe as a staple! Love itt!

This was my first attempt at spaghetti squash in place of pasta. The recipe tastes great and as a lower calorie option to the traditional way the dish is made, this was a home run. Even the kids ate it and believe me they can be picky eaters when anything is tried for the first time.

Good flavor.  Too much moisture may need to reduce liquid next time.   Would make again.

This recipe is so good! It's great as is but also easy to change up to fit personal preferences. You can add other veggies without changing the favor much. We added zucchini and squash. Next time we may add some red pepper to give it a little heat. I also love that there is enough to freeze some for later. Great job!

Changed it for convenience and to add some greens.  Cooked Italian sausage with onion, added big bunch of chopped kale, to that added jar of spaghetti sauce.
