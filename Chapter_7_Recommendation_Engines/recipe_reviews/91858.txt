Oh my goodness! These were easy and SO delicious. I spent some time in Northern India and Nepal over the spring/summer and ate A LOT of these puppies. I needed to bring something for a multicultural potluck and thought "well how hard could momo's be?" The plate emptied lightning fast and everyone raved about them. Used sausage meat because I couldn't find ground pork. I also cooked them in a frying pan with a little olive oil (5 min uncovered 5 min covered w/ out turning) because I didn't have anything to steam them in. Yum. The dipping sauce was perfect. I used a hot red pepper in it. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband had momos before but this is the first time I am eating this. Very tasty! Although my husband said he didn't recall the dipping sauce to taste like this. This is also the first time I have used wonton wrappers. Did not go well I used bamboo steamers but the dumplings stuck fiercely to it. We decided to use the throw them in boiling water instead. The wrappers became very soggy... Next time I will cook the filling first wrap it then pan fry it or something... And I might use ground beef instead just for kicks.

Yum.. tasty and easy. I cooked these like traditional pot stickers since I don't have a steamer.. a bit of oil to pan cooked covered for 5 minutes.. added a bit of water covered again for 4-5 more minutes. The only change I would make next time is in the filling. For me it needed to be less meaty not as firm so I would add more veggies or a few panko crumbs to give the filling a lighter texture

For those who said their dumplings stuck I recommend using a good non stick pan or cast iron pan. Add a little oil to brown one side then flip over and pour about a cup of water in the pan cover tightly until the water is gone then brown. This steaming will completely cook the inside and you will have a nicely browned dumpling (not soggy).

Been on an Indian kick lately making a variety of dishes and recently got a steamer so I thought I'd try these. Wasn't sure what type of dumpling wrapper to use but saw many people online suggest Wonton wrappers so I chose those. I pre-cooked my filling bc I've always found that thinner dumpling wrappers don't do well with all that extra moisture and the end result is better looking. Looked BAD steamed so I fried them instead. Dipping sauce was too chunky and had to add water and take an immersion blender to it to get the right consistency. Make sure to add salt and taste test cooked filling! In the future I would add different spices some heat and put a roasted red pepper in with the dipping sauce. Could definitely use some changes.

These were fabulous albeit labor intensive. I prepared them through the steaming step the night before serving then pan fried them on one side in ghee the night of a dinner party. I removed the dumplings from the pan and added a half a cup of vegetable broth and turmeric to the pan. Simmered to reduce by half and poured the broth over the dumplings to serve. People enjoyed them with and without the dipping sauce this way.

This recipe was OK at best. The flavors are good and I'd say it has potential but I had the same experience "merlion" did. I tried steaming them with the attatchment (as suggested in the recipe) and they stuck to the metal ripping open as I tried to take them out... not to mention that I could only fit about 5 in the steamer without letting them touch meaning it took about 2 hours just to cook the dumplings. I tried boiling them and they got extremely soggy so even the ones that didn't open in the pot ripped when handling. If I make these again I'll try making them in a pan (as pictured).
