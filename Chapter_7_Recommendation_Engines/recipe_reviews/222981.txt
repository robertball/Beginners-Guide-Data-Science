Made for Recipe Group. I couldn't find strawberry juice so I added 1/2 cup of mashed berries and 3/4 cup of water. The cooked mixture thickened up nicely on the stove until the lemon juice was added. It did thicken up a bit more in the frig, but was a liquid mess to try to serve. The cream cheese layer kept the crust from getting soggy, at least until the next day. The taste was great though. I would not make this again without a few tweaks, but then it would be a different recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

RECIPE GROUP: Not super impressed with this pie. Fun to make! Think I used every appliance except the toaster! Used my juicer to make strawberry juice, didn't have quite enough strawberries so some of the juice was from an apple. Like other reviews, mine was a gloopy mess that needed to be served with a spoon not a spatula. I just found it quite tart, wished for more of the sweetened cream cheese...maybe too much lemon juice?

Made this pie for RECIPE GROUP. I experienced the same problem as other reviewers with the pie being too runny.  I even tried reducing the liquid, and after boiling , I received a perfect thickened consistency.  However, even after omitting the lemon juice and just adding the strawberries, the thickened glaze became way too runny.  I believe this recipe calls for too many strawberries, which could be causing the runny consistency.  I could not  get a good photo, as much of the liquid ran under my pie crust (as well as overflowed in the fridge).  The flavor was good (without the lemon juice).  Thanks for sharing this recipe, SUUNKISSED!

Made this for Recipe Group...This is hard to rate b/c while the flavor was very good, it was impossible to serve, and came out of the pan very runny (the strawberry part). By luck, I was able to find strawberry juice at our local Mexican market, so that was good. I was just serving this to the family, so it wasn't a big deal, but I don't think I would be able to serve this to company. I may play around w/ it more some time and see if I can figure out how to hold it together better. Thanks for sharing. :)
