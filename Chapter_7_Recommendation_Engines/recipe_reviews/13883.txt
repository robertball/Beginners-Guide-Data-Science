Definitely a hit... and I thought the leftovers tasted even better!  However, I substituted the mozz and parm with a full bag of the pre-grated Italian Mix Cheese made by Sargento.  Then added one additional cup of mozz.  Instead of just salt, pepper and parsley, I used garlic salt, parsley, oregano, sweet basil and onion.  YUM!  The filling made enough for an entire box of manicotti noodles.  Hint:  Only pre-cook the noodles until they are slighty tender, the sauces and cheeses assist in cooking it the rest of the way.  And, to fill, try using a pastry bag!  Took me less than 5 minutes to prepare after I precooked the noodles.  A keeper.

This is a great dish.  I used a big ziplock and cut a hole in the corner to squirt the filling into the manicotti.

Quick tip: You don't have to pre-cook the manicotti noodles. Easier to stuff that way and saves time cooking and waiting for them to cool. They will cook in the sauce to a perfect consistency while in the oven. Just cover with tin foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes so the cheese on top melts and gets that yummy finish.

This was wonderful!!  Though I did make my own sauce (I sauteed ablout 1/2 lb of mushrooms in butter and garlic and the added a 16 oz can of tomato sauce and added some basil, pepper and more garlic to taste) and I added extra mozzarella on the top toward the end of baking.  This was my first time making manicotti and the first time my husband had ever had it at all.  We both LOVED it!  and it made yummy leftovers too.  Will definatly be making again soon!  Oh and I used the zipper bag method for filling.  I left the pasta a bit more under cooked than "al dente" (the box said 7-10 minutes and I cooked them for almost 5).  WOW it was so easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe, but I needed to make modifications for the second time around.  I omitted the eggs, since they seemed to make the cheese sauce too runny.  Instead, I used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  Also, I used 1 tablespoon of parsely and 16 ounces of mozzerella cheese. (Throw in some garlic powder too!)  Yum.  The cheese mixture was almost too easy to stuff into the pasta and came out very delicious.  Hint:  Add 1/4 of sour cream to your cheese mixture if it seems too dry before stuffing.  Enjoy!!  
  Thanks for the start of a great recipe Anny!

Easy simple recipe. I don't cook my noodles ahead of time. I just put them in a large bowl with some hot water while I make the filling. They're easy to stuff that way and will cook all the way thru when you bake it.

Tasty. I put the cheese filling nto a ziploc, cut the corner, piped it into manicotti.  No mess. Would make it again.

I think this recipe would be very bland if you didn't add some extras.  I added 3 cloves of garlic (I'd add even more, actually), fresh basil, and oregano.  It was very good with everything added.  A great basic recipe to begin with though.

This was easy to make and tasted great! I wish I'd undercooked the shells to make them easier to fill. I added some cooked turkey sausage for my "it's not a meal without meat" husband with good results. Only thing I would suggest is covering the baking dish with foil and cooking for 35 minutes unstead of 45.

This is a really good recipe (and much easier than some of the other manicotti recipes on this site).  It does have a lot (A LOT!) of cheese in it, though, so if you're health-conscious, you can take out some of the cheese and replace it with spinach, like I did.  Yummy!

Pretty good. The only problem was the pasta was a bit too dry even when I took it out early. Next time I'll try covering it with tinfoil while baking.

As I make a very large pot of meat sauce and freeze several Italian meals at a time I thought I would try a Manicotti one this time.  I only followed this recipe for the filling and I did not cook the noodles like all my frozen meals with pasta in them.  simply used a piping bag to fill the hard shells adding just a bit more sauce to the bottom and the top and then freezing.  Once thawed and baked the pasta turns out perfect and not mushy.  A wonderful addition to my "mom is to busy to cook days".  Very pretty dish to serve for company too and all I had to do was pull it from the freezer.  Excellent

This is a great vegetarian meal that is so tasty meat eaters won't miss anything.  I liked it because it is easy to dress up and add extras as you like them.  I have made with both red and alfredo sauce and both are good.  I usually make my own rather than jarred though.  I have also added thawed and drained spinach, which is really good, although my husband didn't care for that as much.  I started adding a little italian spice rather than just parsley to add a little flavor when I use cream sauce.

My grandma always taught me to make manicotti while the noodles are uncooked. Did that with this recipe, and it turned out great. Saves a lot of trouble and much easier to stuff.

Top notch. Very tasty and very simple. Now I don't get how people stuff the noodle so I slit it down the middle put the stuffing in and then close it up and set in the pan. Seriously, no one knows but me and now you. :) Will def. make again.

Super tasty! I added 1/2cp Romano and asiago mix fresh and fine grated... so good. Also be sure not to cook shells all the way bc they will split when try to stuff them.

This was soooo good! I replaced 1/2 the ricotta with cottage cheese. I also added 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp basil, Bob Evans Zesty sausage and used a bag of provolone & mozzarella.

Good recipe.  Note to everyone making this.  Do not cook the noodles until done!!!  For folks like me that attempted this for the first time, the noodles need to be al dente, not done.  They will fall apart if cooked completely.  Most of you already know that but for those who don't...

I received 2 thumbs up on this meal. I added an extra egg to the cheese mixture with extra basil and garlic powder. The third egg made the cheese a little thicker and was really say to fill the shells. I will definitely make this again!

Good recipe... We all enjoyed it. I added 3 cloves of garlic and some fresh mushrooms chopped finely. Will be making this again. Good base recipe you could add almost anything to.

My first time ever making this, or eating it really. My husband and I loved it. When mixing the cheeses and egg, I added a teaspoon or so of garlic for taste.
2nd time around 3 months later....
I used jumbo shells this time. SOOO much easier to fill. i used a mix of cheddar and the mix of italian cheeses in the stuffing. i topped the dish with remaining cheeses after 40 minutes to bake an additional 5 to melt. so yummy

Very good - really easy to make.  The kids gobbled it up and wanted seconds!  I boiled the noodles for 7 minutes then drained and plunged them into an ice water bath.  I used the gallon ziplock bag to pipe in the cheese filling and it was so easy.  Next time I think I'll try it with cottage cheese and add some spinach.

If I would have know making manicotti was this easy I would have made it ages ago.  I didn't have ricotta but did have cottage cheese and it turned out totally awesome.  This is definitely a keeper!

My favorite italian pasta! Love this recipe! Very hearty, very filling. Instead of Manicaotti pasta I used the lasagna sheets of fresh pasta and cut them in half. Then rolled my own manicotti.

Exceptional and easy! I used these reviewer's tips:

- ziploc freezer bag with corner cut for piping
- italian seasoning and garlic powder (didn't have parsley)
-"par"boil the shells for 5 minutes

Worked like a charm!

This recipe is a fantastic starting point, but I imagine just as it is, it would be a bit bland. I wilted some spinach and added it to the cheese mixture, as well as a couple cloves of garlic that I had minced and briefly sauteed. I also used italian seasoning instead of the parsley. The reviews were incredible. I definitely will be making this again! Just a note about the pasta- only cook it for about 5 minutes. It won't be done, but it will be so much easier to fill, and it will cook up perfectly when baking. Enjoy!!

We made this with a fresh tomato sauce with jalepenos and onion, and reduced it down to a thick sauce. I also added a can of crab meat to the cheese mixture. Yum!

I had never made or even eaten this before, but made it at the request of my family.  Everyone really enjoyed it, even my very picky 2-year-old!  I added some Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  There was quite a bit extra of the cheese mixture, even after filling 14 shells, so I don't know if I just didn't fill them as full as the recipe said, or if there is just more than enough, but I ended up using more noodles.  I would definitely use this recipe again!

I added chopped garlic to the cheese mixture--delicious! Want an easy way to fill the manicotti? Place filling in a sandwich bag, close up with a twist-tie. Cut off one of the bottom tips and simply squeeze it in on both sides!

very tasty...I substituted half the mozarella for monterey jack and was short some of the parm because we don't buy the grated stuff anymore...i love manicotti as it reminds me of my mom's   i also use the jumbo shells over the tubes because they are easier to stuff and don't break

this was super good!  but of course, like everyone else, i added a few things.  instead of riccota cheese i used cottage cheese.  i brown some hamburgers and sauted mushrooms and added it to the cheese mixture.  i put both mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese on top.  i also added some seasings to the cheese mix: basil, onion, garlic.  i had plenty of filling left over.  i think i'm going to freeze it and use it for some lasagna roll-ups some time.  i also put half in a 8x8 dish before baking and froze it for later.

I added italitan sausage and garlic powder.  I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I also use the oven ready noodles so I have to add extra liquid so added about 1/4 c water and drizzled red wine too....it was delicious!  My whole family enjoyed it.

GREAT recipe! It was my first time making manicotti, and it was a success! Using a bag to pipe the cheese into the shells was very time-saving. Also, I added some garlic salt to the cheese mixture to add flavor. This recipe definitely makes more than 4 servings

Again, quick and easy (my favorite)!  Also very tasty.  I put the cheese filling into a ziploc bag, cut the corner then piped it into manicotti.  No mess!  I would make it again for sure!

Really really yummy. I'd give it more stars if I could.  The only problem is that since it is so caloric I don't make it as often as we would like!!! It's also good as leftovers (if you have any)

Loved it.  Per other reviews, I added garlic salt, basil and oregano to the cheese mixture.  The filling made enough for 10 shells.  Using a gallon bag to pipe the filling into al dente shells is a huge time saver.

I made this for a dinner party and it went over VERY well!  I did add a few things to the cheese stuffing, though: 1/2 onion, 1 small zucchini, 4 cloves garlic, 5 mushrooms - all minced & sauteed.  Plus basil, oregano, and cayenne pepper.  Added extra mozzerella on top, as well.

HOWEVER, there is no way I'm going to stuff a limp noodle.  If you make this with Lawrey's spaghetti sauce out of an envelope, then you don't have to precook the noodles.  There is enough water in the sauce to cook the noodles in the oven.  Just COVER with tinfoil to bake.

I've never made manicotti before, but it turned out really well! Even though I used the bag method to fill the manicotti, I still found it difficult to fill them well. I'll blame my own motor skills on that one, though. The boyfriend devoured this in record time. Thanks, Anny!

Great and easy. A tad bland if spices are not added. I added Italian seasoning and fresh parsley as well as ground beef in the sauce.   Although I did not take the advice I would suggest to also place pasta in a bowl of warm water as it will cook in oven with sauce.

This was the first dish I've made without any assistance and it turned out wonderfully - so much so that my culinary talented boyfriend has now deemed I make this once a week from now on.

I made this recipe with ground beef in the sauce. The kid's loved it.  Being a little bit of a novice with pasta, I overcooked manicotti a little.  Some of them split in half when I went to drain them.  So I laid the bottom of one in the dish, put on a layer of the cheese mixture and laid the other part of the pasta on top.  The family couldn't tell the difference.

I made this for a family dinner and Oh Boy! did I get fabulous compliments on this dish!  It was a fairly easy(tiny bit time consuming) to make and produced amazing flavor.  I added italian seasonings and salts to the cheese mixture and added a little more cheese(asiago, mozzarella and parmesean blend) I did use the recommendation of another and placed cheese mixture into a gallon size ziploc baggie...it helped me fill the manicotti shells so much better and it helped save  on time! A lifesaver tip for this dish, for sure! I'm making sure to keep these ingredients on hand so I can make it again soon

If you are going to cook Manicotti then half way cook the noodles then stuff. The juices from the sauce will cook the noodles the rest of the way. I added zuchinni to mine because you need some flavors that will stick out. But easy and yummy.

I love this recipe. My husband thinks it by far the best thing I ever made.  The only thing i changed it i added some hot sausage. I mixed with some extra tomato sauce/spaghetti sauce and used that to top the dish before i put it in the oven. It makes great leftovers, and it very easy to double.

The only thing i had problems with was the manicotti shells breaking, but i soon found out, you can just open them up and its a lot easier to fill that way, and comes out just the same.

I love manicotti and this recipe is like the one my mother always used.  The only changes I made were using lowfat cottage cheese in place of 1/2 of the ricotta and I sprinkled a little chedder in with the mozzerella because I ran out!!  Thanks!

This tasted great, but was way too much work--I had the filling everywhere!  I have to admit, there are frozen manicotti's that are delicious and no work at all.  I think I'll stick with them.....

Excellent!!! I made this yesterday and was a major hit!  I used the 4 Italian Cheese mix bag and one bag of shredded Mozz (added to the ricotta) and added fresh parsley, garlic and onion powder, topped with fresh grated parmesan before baking.   Also used the ziplock bag to fill. It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

The recipe, as written, made about 10 stuffed noodles.  My family just raved about this one.  I added basil and garlic powder to the cheese mixture.

Although I would like more seasoning and cheeses my kids are extremely picky so this was perfect for them. I filled a large Ziploc bag with the filling, sealed it and cut a hole in the corner just a little smaller than the opening of the shells to fill them. Super easy. This recipe is great because it's very simple and extremely easy to adapt any way you like. My 4 year old only eats pickles, dry tuna and Kix cereal and he asked if he can eat this everyday-need I say more?

Very good! I used Bertollo Mediterranean Olive Pasta sauce. It really gave it a great taste! My husband liked this alot. It was easy to pre-pare! I have to becareful of sugar levels so the above pasta sause is also one of the lowest with regards to sugar content I could find only 3 grams per 1/2 cup. Give this a A+! My husband took the leftovers to work and said it was good the second time around also!

easy and delicious!My husband loves this.Tip... to make filling the manicotti easier, place cheese mixture in a ziplock bag and cut off one corner. Use this like a pastery bag and just squeese the filling in, or, use shells.

Made this for dinner tonight and I loved it. I only gave it four stars because it could be a bit bland for some people's tastes, but I could eat this again and again! Definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Great simple recipe!  I added extra spices to the cheese mixture and some fresh herbs and it was awesome.  Key...do not overcook the pasta...I only boiled for 5 min to ensure you could stuff them easily and it worked great!  Super yummy...will make again!

A new favorite!  Try it with Emeril's marinara - there is a hint of sweetness to it that pairs well with the cheeses.  I also used the idea of placing the filling in a Ziploc and snipping off a corner to pipe the filling into the shells.  Worked like a charm!

love this recipe.  I made a few changes, I didn't cook the shells beforehand.  I just made sure there was enough sauce to cook the shells in the oven. I also added garlic and Onion powder to add some flavor

I fill the manicotti with a chicken dip that can be found on this site. I use my jerky gun to fill up the manicotti. Cut the pieces of chicken up small to allow it to pass through the gun. Enjoy !!

I made this tonight but added about 4 or so cups of imitation crab (not the canned stuff but refrigerated) I love crab and it gave it a perfect flavor. I also used garlic alfredo sauce and it turned out delicious! I added fresh parsley instead of dry also. Baked it for 45 minutes.  Yummy!

This recipe was pretty good, but I like to make my own recipe of spaghetti sauce and that seems to add more flavor to the dish. I also added garlic powder to the cheese filling and that took flavors to a whole new level. :) But overall this was good and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Good recipe.  I have been stuffing Manicotti for years and the fun part is you can put pretty much anything you like into them.  I like to add a ground beef/sweet italian sausage mix to the cheese filling.  Amazing what a little protein can do.

I made manicotti for the first time using this recipe for a crowd of foodies, and it turned out delicious; everyone loved it. To make the manicottis easy to stuff, I undercooked it (7 min) and used a ziploc to squirt the fillings in like people suggested. I also added onions, garlic, mushrooms, herbs to the sauce, instead of using sauce straight from the jar. Yummyyy!

4 thumbs up from me and my husband! I wish I could give it 10 stars! This was the BEST recipe I've tried on all recipes! I followed some of the other's suggestions and didn't cook the pasta all the way, and mixed spinach and garlic with the cheese filling. I also put alum foil on the top to keep them moist. I'll be makin this again!!!!

Very good and really easy!  I added diced red onion, garlic powder, basil and oregano to the cheese mixture and only cooked the noodles about halfway.  Was great as left-over lunch the next day too!  We will be making this again.

Delicious and easy to make. It also freezes well, if your looking to put something away for a rainy day. I did everything according to the recipe except I added red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon of sugar to the red sauce.

This is pretty much similar to a manicotti/stuffed shell recipe so we knew it would be good. I used a few dashes of garlic salt and also some crushed red pepper in the mixture. Also, we top the entire dish with some shredded mozzarella   prior to baking. We did not use manicotti pasta, instead we used medium size shells; which turned out fine! These are really easy to make and if you use shells it makes a lot so you will have plenty leftover for work or whenever.

Love love love this recipe!  I have made it several times!  The only thing I do different is double sauce and I saute some minced garlic with fresh spinach.  I add it to the cheese mixture and it gives it a wonderful flavor.  My 5 yr. old little girl even loves this spinach and all and she is super picky!!!

This recipe is wonderful as is, but I did add spinach to the cheese mixure.  I threw everything in the food processor to make a nice, even mixture.  Just as a personal preference I prefer to use homemade marinara as opposed to jarred sauce, but the canned stuff is a great time saver.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great! I used half cottage cheese and half ricotta and added some garlic powder and fresh basil (4 tsp) to the filling to add some taste. I also sprinkled about half a cup of mozarella cheese with the parmesan on the top. By the way I used cannelloni (about 250 gr.) since I couldn't find manicotti, the ziplock method worked just fine.

Satisfied my craving and was super easy/quick to make.  Added ground beef to the spaghetti sauce to please hubby and wound up freezing some for later, which also worked well.  Thanks for an easy pleaser.

A good, simple recipe that's easy to build on. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added mushrooms, onions, garlic, oregano, and basil to the cheese mixture. I covered the pan in foil and baked it for about 30 minutes. This prevented the manicotti from drying out. 
My family loved it, thanks!

I made this last night for the first time.  My son is 13. He thinks food groups consist of pizza, chocolate, buffalo wings and hot dogs. Even he loved this recipe.  When he goes back for seconds I know it must have been a good meal.  And its easy to make(except for stuffing shells).  I highly recommend this one.

This was great ... even my extremely picky husband loved it. I had a little trouble filling the manicotti, but with my husband's help, it was a success! I had a lot of the cheese mixture left over (I filled 10 manicotti) so I spread it over the tops of the manicotti, then topped it with sauce, then mozarella and parmesan. A relatively easy, yummy meal!

I will make it again but even cutting the edge of a zip lock bag to pipe the cheese filling in didn't work to good for me.  I liked some of the ideas on here to just soak shells in warm water while making cheese filling or just let them cook in sauce in oven.

This is definitely a family favorite! So easy! I don’t precook the noodles...they’re easier to stuff that way. Just add sauce on top, cover with foil and cook for an hour. Leftovers, (IF there are any!), taste even better the next day!

Absolutely delicious. I added some basil and oregano, along with sautéed mushrooms and fresh garlic. It was definitely a huge hit with the family including the 11 month old.

Covered with mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan cheese. Made a little extra sauce and added Italian sausage. Fabulous meal!

I did not pre-cook the manicotti tubes, but stuffed them uncooked, much easier. Added 1\2 cup water to dish with sauce, covered it, baked 30 minutes, then uncovered and baked another 20 minutes or until fork tender. Cuts the work in half!

Added chopped spinach and used a bag with the corner cut out to stuff shells. It was amazingly wonderful! So going to make this one again. The butter on top just did something to the whole thing.

Excellent recipe.  I found it easier to use the Olivieri Lasagna sheets available in the supermarkets as opposed to the shells.  Just cut them in half, place filling in the center and roll. Yields 12 per package.  I also mixed in some fresh spinach. I usually double the recipe as it freezes well for later use.

Everyone loved this!  I did make a few minor modifications based on other users' reviews.  Used only 1 egg and added just a little garlic, basil, and oregano to the cheese mix for flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Our box of manicotti was larger,  so I adjusted the rest of the ingredients.   I also added a sweet Italian sausage to the spaghetti sauce.   Great recipe.   This was my first time making manicotti.  It was very easy to follow the recipe.   Will be making this again in the future.

Love this classic/basic recipe for me. Only thing I noticed is that a pinch of nutmeg added to the filling is not mentioned. I always add nutmeg....it's brings out the nuttiness of the cheeses. Remember just the tiniest bit....it has a tendency to overpower but when done right it brings the cheeses to life!

Enjoy! Oh and gotta say manacotti is one of my favorite dishes EVER!

Delicious! Soaked pasta in pot of very warm water while I made the filling instead of boiling them. Easier to fill and just like most peeps...I used a piping bag to fill. The filling is soon good!great dish

This is an awsome recipe!!I only added a couple things but not necessary. We just like spinach, so I added a pkt of spinach (thawed and drained well) to the ricotta and then sauteed onin peppeers and mushrooms to add to the sauce. This is going to be a regular at our place

Not bad at all. I added basil and garlic salt, but made no other changes. My husband was very happy with it. Just make sure to use good quality sauce for best results.

Edit: The second time I made this, I halved the ricotta and replaced it with more mozzarella. This made it less like meatless lasagna and more like the ooey gooey manicotti served at Italian restaurants. I also only cooked the pasta halfway before stuffing. This meant less ripped pasta and more cheese stuffed into each tube. The pasta cooked the rest of the way through in the oven and came out perfect. I added basil, garlic salt, and minced garlic to the cheese mixture as well. My dinner guests were very impressed. 

With these alterations, the recipe is definitely five stars. It tasted like restaurant quality manicotti. Three and a half stars for the original recipe, though (I rounded up).

Really good - made last night using giant shells instead of manicotti noodles and put some sausage at the bottom of the pan to add some meat to the recipe. I also opted to cover the dish with lots of extra mozzarella cheese and some Italian bread crumbs. This is a great recipe and hard to mess up!

This is a great base recipe. I made it as directed and it was good.

However, I prefer more flavor, so next time I will add garlic salt and maybe some Italian sausage. I put the filling in a ziplock bag like others suggested, and it made filling the manicotti WAY easier. Also, I recommend under cooking the manicotti so that it doesn't fall apart when you fill it. It will cook all the way through when you put it in the oven.

I should have known better as it is only an assembled recipe, not much homemade about this. Everything is precooked. The only thing not pre-made is adding  the eggs to the cheeses.

This was so yummy.I added ground beef and instead of mozzarella cheese I used the Italian cheese.Instead of stuffing it in the noodles-I slit open the noodle and stuffed the meat and cheese on it and then wrap it/roll it and put open side down in dish.I will be doin it that way from now on...Another keeper!

I made this recipe with a couple minor changes. I added frozen chopped spinach, garlic powder, and basil. I also used fat free ricotta, egg whites, and left out the Parmesan just to make it a bit more healthy. I didn't cook the manicotti shells at all before stuffing them. I covered my dish with foil and baked for 45 minutes. Shells were perfect. It was good and my kids enjoyed it as well. Will make again.

This was very good.  I took other reviewers advice and cooked the shells for only 5 minutes then used a ziploc bag to fill them (genius idea!).  My husband is vehemently opposed to meatless dinners so I added about 1/2 lb. of sausage to the spaghetti sauce, otherwise followed the recipe.  Oh, also I used the whole box of Manicotti shells and the amount of filling was more than enough.  Will make again but may just make my own sauce rather than used jarred.

Loved these creamy cheese filled manicotti. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out terrific. With ease I piped the cheese mixture inside the cooked pasta using a pastry bag. Used Traditional Prego Sauce. The leftovers reheated the next day were even better!

I am a novice in the kitchen, and this recipe was extremely easy to make.  Instead of cooking the noodles ahead of time, I took the advice of someone else and placed the stuffing inside while the noodle was uncooked. I also covered the dish with foil.  With the exception of a few hard corners, the pasta came out perfect.  The sauce I used was kind of thick (e.g., couldn't pour it out of the bottle) so next time I may add a little bit of water to help steam the noodles in the cooking dish.

Great recipe.  My daughter has been helping make it since she was 3.  We have modified it slightly to taste with fresh sauce but in the past we used jar sauce and it was still good.

This was good... I split it up, did half by the recipe and half with browned ground beef (and a sprinkling of italian seasoning while browning).  Let's just say it was much easier to fill the manicotti tubes with the ground beef mixture!  (I highly recommend a pastry tube if you're not adding any meat; I accidentally split most of the tubes when filling with the meatless mixture)  Anyway, a great recipe with or without meat.  Thanks!

This recipe was extremely simple and quick.  But since my family insists on meat with every meal, I added a pound of ground beef and some italian sausage.  It was absolutely GREAT!!

Very good.  Not for the lactose intolerant!!!  Thoroughly enjoyed by all in the home.  One pint of ricotta is ??? used one small container instead.  Made it with the zuchini, garden vegetable spaghetti sauce which added more veggies.  Was very good and not that hard to make.

Great bsaic recipe.  Easy to spice up by adding a flavored sauce or just adding sausage or ground beef to the sauce.  It needs something, but the best recipe I found for a starter.

My teenagers are very picky. But they all raved about this recipe. My son said he felt like he ate at a five-star restaurant. My daughters ate leftovers for breakfast, and say it was just as good. I will definitely keep this recipe and use it over and over.

great recipe! although, i used this recipe for the filling only. i used homemade manicotti crepes instead of store bought manicotti. the filling made about 10 crepes. i then made "quick and easy alfredo sauce" from this site, poured about 1/2 cup into bottom of 9x13 glass dish, lined up manicotti crepes, then spooned in more sauce on top. i partially covered with foil all but the last ten minutes. with remainder of the sauce i had made, i added one can of crabmeat and one can of tiny shrimp, and spooned seafood sauce over manicotti before serving. very good!

I've always been intimidated by manicotti....seemed to difficult to make. The only adjustment I made to this recipe was adding a liberal amount of crushed garlic. The dish came out perfect and I'm finally over my manicotti phobia! LOL

This got two thumbs up from the roommates!! I thought it was delicious and easy to make. I ended up using jumbo shell pasta instead of manicotti tubes, but the end result is the same. The shells are probably a little easier to stuff anyway. There were comments that the filling was somewhat bland so I seasoned mine quite a bit....I used a good amount of salt, pepper, as well as some garlic powder and dried oregano. Topped with homemade tomato sauce..yum!! Will absolutely make this again.

Delicious!  Substituted a package of chopped spinach for parsley.  I also made my own sauce by using 8 oz. tomato sauce, 1 lb browned ground beef, 15-20 sliced sauteed mushrooms, and oregano, basil, and garlic powder to taste.  This recipe took a while, but was well worth the effort!

This is a very good recipe.  I used a bit more spaghetti sauce and added mozarella on top of the sauce.  All that I had on hand to stuff with was a slim plastic knife, which worked pretty well.  First stuff one side, then turn and stuff the other.

This is wonderful.  Here's the easiest way I know to stuff manicotti and/or shells.  I use a cake decorating pastry bag with either an open ended coupler or a large round tip.  Fill the bag with your  filling and squeeze it right into noodle.  Works perfect every time and makes it a super quick process!

Easy way to stuff the manicotti is to make the stuffing and DO NOT COOK the manicotti, and stuff before you cook.....Simply add 3/4 c of water to your sauce and cover when baking and it is GREAT!!!!!!!  I also use lowfat cottage cheese and mix it w/ the ricotta!! Great recipe!

Terrific!  I just wish I could find a better way to stuff the manicotti shells.

Great! This was the first time i ever made manicotti. I was surprised to see it wasnt very hard at all.  I added a package of frozed chopped spinach to the mixture in mine.  Thanks for this recipe!

I don't know if anyone has already made this suggestion but  I used eggroll wrappers in place of manicotti tubes. They are thinner, so you can use two for each if you want a thicker pasta (more like a manicotti shell). This way, you omit the pre-cooking of the pasta and the difficulty stuffing the tubes. Just put the cheese mixture in the wrapper(s), roll them up and place them seam-side down in the casserole dish. The wrappers cook while the dish is heating in the oven. I also add chopped fresh basil to the cheese mixture and use Rao's arabiatta sauce for spiciness. So much easier than using manicotti shells.

I've made this twice, following the recipe exactly each time.  House full of picky eaters, and everyone loved it!  Will be making again. I did use whole milk ricotta both times.That's all my grocery store carried.

Very good basic manicotti recipe. My only alteration was that I also stuffed some mozzarella into the pasta as well as the ricotta mixture, and omitted one egg, as I thought two was overkill. I always spoon the ricotta mixture into a quart sized freezer bag and then snip the corner off so I can squeeze the mixture into the manicotti--much easier than using a spoon. This is probably my husband's very favorite meal, and I'm pretty fond  of it too.

Good recipe,  would had added 1/2 lb. of hamburger.  Very labor intensive.  I used all fresh ingredients,  except for the 10 month old parmesan cheese block from Wisconsin.  Feeds 8 - 10. Cheese paste was perfect for the 14 pasta tubes. Do not overcook the pasta. Use a zip lock bag n cut corner to squize paste in pasta.

Didn’t pre-cook the pasta and it was fine, albeit a tad bit chewy. Added some homemade pesto (About 1/3 a cup) into the cheese filling, which gave it an added depth of flavor.  Used almost the whole box of manicotti in order to fill one layer in the pan. Turned out pretty well, though cooked a little longer (1 hr.) in order to fully cook the pasta.

Good basic recipe for manicotti. 
I find parsley to be a bit blah for my tastes so replaced the parsley with chives, oregano and basil (to taste).
Homemade sauce tops it much better than bottled.
"5 1/2 ounces of manicotti" is a bit obscure.  The actual amount you make will fill roughly 12 shells.

I cooked this on Christmas and it came out wonderfully! Instead of mozzarella cheese I used Monterey Jack and I added shrimp to the cheese mixture. It came out perfectly. I am a reluctant cook, so I was very proud of myself.

First Manicotti dish I've ever made.  I enjoyed it--can't go wrong with Ricotta filled pastas, in my view--but next time i'll probably make minor alterations to the recipe and/or add more seasoning for flavor.

Very easy. I put in a little extra mozzarella and parm because we’re cheese lovers. I cut the corner out of a ziplock bag and then loaded the bag up with the filling. Made it much easier. All three of my kids loved it (8 months, 3 years, and 5 years) as well as my husband. Next time I may try browning some sausage to mix in with the filling to kick it up to that next level.

As suggested by others, I did not pre-cook the pasta tubes. I used the ingredients as listed, but added Italian seasoning and garlic powder, plus  about 1.5 cups of seasoned ground chicken I had on hand from another meal. Using the corner-cut -from-the -baggie suggestion was great, especially with firm shells.  It stuffed 1.5 packages of shells (21). Baked covered for 45 minutes, added cheese on top, re-covered, and baked another 10-15 min.ll  Shell edges without sauce were a bit crunchy. Next time I will make sure sauce is on all parts of the raw shells before baking. It was really good, and was  a hit with my family.

They came out so good and I believe perfect to me!! A good trick I used that I saw someone say in the comments was to put the cheese in a big ziploc bag and squeeze it into the manicottis! Less messy and less to clean I love this recipe I even had enough cheese left over to make stuffed shells!!

This turned out awesome. I recommend adding a little more sauce than what it calls for, but that's just my personal preference. The filling is so good! I've made it a couple of times now. I like to double it and  freeze one pan before baking it for an easy dinner another night.

so i made it according to the original recipe but added some more Italian spices to the cheese mixture and a tad bit of feta cheese too 

I did put sauce on the top of the shells and then layered more layer of mozzarella cheese  cheese but not shredded i sliced some from a block of mozzarella until it became golden brown

Great starting point!  The consistency of the filling was spot on, but bland.  I added a lot more parsley and Italian spices as well as sautéed garlic and some onion powder (I didn't have any onion at the house otherwise I would have chopped and added to my sautéed garlic).  Also used my homemade sauce to set this off!  I will say, I made this again on a weeknight in a crunch and used jar sauce and it was quick and tasty!  Putting this in the regular rotation and for freezer meals too!

This turned out fantastic! I used the oven ready shells and did not cook them first. Used a piping bag for the filling and low fat Cottage Cheese instead of Ricotta. I did add garlic powder, onion powder, basil and oregano (1 tsp each) to the cheese mixture. 
I cooked covered in tin foil for 45 minutes, added shredded cheese to the top and cooked for another 10 ish. Yummy!
This was my very first time making stuffed Manicotti and I will be making it again. Thanks! :)

Awesome but don't top it with only shredded parmesan, it doesn't melt or brown very well and becomes a hard crust when left in the fridge. Use mozzarella or a blend of both, and only top the ones your planning on eating because reheating covered in the oven didn't work very well with the parmesan. I would have liked a sauce recipe or recommended store-bought sauce that would have worked well but the one we had in the fridge worked well (roasted-garlic) That's it. This recipe is fantastic.

16 oz. of ricotta with stated ingredients easily filled 14 manicotti. The Barilla box was 8 oz. and had 14 tubes. I had a enough filling for perhaps 1-2 more  tubes. It was delicious and 45 minutes was a perfect time. I didn't have the stated corning size so I used two 13 X 9" and put 7 tubes in each with foil on top, Perfect.

this was disgusting and I followed the recipe precisely. the remaining pasta sauce needs to be poured on while It's cooking, not before. Instead the sauce cooked for 45 minutes with the pasta and kind of turned into a paste. had I received this in a restaurant I would have asked for a refund. I will never use this recipe again.

I have made this before and it has always come out very tasty, but not so pretty! Lol, I am not Italian and can not, for the life of me figure out how not rip the shells after boiling them, HOWEVER, I just found out how to do it without having any mishaps, so simple really, stuff the shells while they are hard and cook them for one our in the oven covered and voila! Beautiful dish!!! The shells cook with the sauce perfectly.  They do have to be covered in sauce.

Do not precook the shells. It is so much easier to fill them, and the sauce will cook them in the oven. Besides that, I don't tweak this recipe at all and it turns out great!

Last time I made manicotti, the filling was too... bland? Nothing to break up the consistency. So to not only put meat in it but to help with the texture, I shredded a rotisserie chicken and mixed it in with the filling with about 1 Tbsp dried basil. 
I don't know if it made a difference or not, but the prepared noodles sat inside the fridge for about 2hours before baking.

This recipe was absolutely amazing. It's just my husband and I and we wiped out the whole dish for dinner and left overs the next day for lunch.  I added Porta Bella mushrooms on half to see how it would taste, well it was amazing. I will be adding then to the whole dish next time. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

Good recipe, however to add some spice and protein I substituted half of the mozzarella and ricotta filling with finely ground spicy Italian sausage. I’ve also used ground beef and turkey with great results.

My 14 year old made this for dinner. It was simple and delicious! The only substitution was for oregano. We used same amount of Italian seasoning, as we didn’t have oregano. Otherwise made exactly as directed. It was as good as you find in many restaurants with half the cost!

Everyone loved this dish. I didn't want to pay for fresh parsley, so I added some dry spices I had on hand (basil, oregano, dill, garlic, toasted onion). Very flexible, easy recipe. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe and video for my first time making manicotti. I will certainly make it again. I did half the recipe since I was cooking for 2. Used an 11x7" pan and it worked great. Thanks

I needed a general recipe for the cheese filling, as I make my own homemade pasta sauce for everything. I also use about 8 oz of cottage cheese along with the ricotta. I also, like others mentioned, do not pre-cook my manicotti shells. They are much easier to stuff, using a ziplock-type bag with a small corner cut off to pipe the cheese into the manicotti. This is now all packed in to the fridge to pop into the oven at dinner time tonight.

I followed several readers suggestions, mostly adding more seasoning.  I tried one suggestion to soak the manicotti pasta in hot water while making the filling but didn't work out.  Next time will parboil about 5 min. and shock in ice water.  The pasta was a bit too chewy for me.

This was my 1st attempt at making manicotti.  The advice of at least one reviewer and the manicotti noodle box; the pasta was not boiled first.

This made filling the pasta shells easy.  The only other variation from the recipe was doubling the amount of sauce.  Because the pasta wasn’t precooked, it needed the addl. liquid, as well as an extra 30 min. to cook.

It turned out perfectly.  Even my partner who is not a fan of tomato sauce said it was a winner.  We’ll make this again.

Me and my hubby loved this recipe! I added extra seasoning such as parsley and already made Italian seasoning and also Italian blend cheese. My husband and I are big cheese fanatics so we substituted the tomato red sauce for a Four Cheese sauce and it was soooooo yummy! Thinking about adding spinach next time!

Make this all the time and double the recipe so I have an extra for freezer or to give to one of my kids.. I omit most of the salt and throw in at least a tablespoon of sugar into the ricotta mixture.. it makes a great compliment to the acidity of the spaghetti sauce and I hate overly salted food

This was a really good dinner for my family! I added one thing, Italian sausage, I just mixed it in with the ricotta before stuffing the manicotti shells. This has become one of our favorites!

Absolutely delicious and very simple.  I didn't have any piping bags for the filling, so I simply used a plastic storage bag.  Easier than lasagna and just as delicious.  I'm excited to add this to my regular cooking routines.

This was such an excellent recipe.  I doubled the recipe and only used 3 eggs instead of 4, I also added 10 oz fresh spinach chopped finely, 3 links mild Italian sausage cooked and crumbled with half a sauteed onion, along with 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 TBS fresh Basil, 1.5 tsp dried oregano.  I mixed it all together and used a pastry bag to fill the 8oz package of Barilla manicotti noodles.  I left the noodles dry and also used a 40 oz jar of Rao's Mariniara Sauce.  I only used half of the filling so I will freeze the other half for the next manicotti meal.  I used a 10x15" glass baking dish buttered.  I added 1 cup of sauce to the bottom, then added the filled noodles, then poured the remaining marinara sauce on top, making sure to cover the noodles entirely so they would cook without having to boil them first.  This makes it so much less mess and easier to handle.  I then covered it with foil and baked it for 50 minutes, then removed the foil and baked for an additional 10 minutes. Best manicotti I have ever had!  Thank you for a great foundation recipe!

wwhen making this dish you might want to make it a double. It was easy to make and very tasty. Our 5 person household had enough to eat, but not enough for left-overs. We only had two left. Our son had them for a snack later.

Let me start that I love manicotti and order it often when we eat Italian out. However, I never made it myself. I made it exactly as stated except shredded a little extra mozzarella to put on the top with the Parmesan. So good. Next time I will try not boiling the noodles. I didn’t find them hard to fill  (use the corner cut off a gallon bag method). Just time consuming between the boil time and then letting them cook off enough to touch. My husband who is a lasagna lover - loved it. It will be a regular rotation in our house.

Great recipe. I definitely recommend making your own sauce. I made a ground beef/ Italian sausage red sauce. Filled the shells with ricotta, egg, spinach, dry basil and oregano. Topped with provel, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cook the shells to al dente. Undercooked will break the shells while filling and over cooked will taste like mush. So many options for this.  Can’t wait to make again.

This is my go to recipe for Manicotti, and it's a GREAT place to start, but I do things just a little different. 

1. I DO NOT cook my manicotti shells beforehand. Instead, I make sure to coat the bottom of my pan with a healthy layer of marinara, and then completely cover the shells with marinara and let them cook in the sauce. This maintains the integrity of the shell and lets them cook in that flavorful sauce.

2. I use some Italian seasoning in the cheese mixture, as well as garlic powder. 

3. Sometimes I also include some cooked spinach (frozen is fine), when I'm feeling a little guilty about eating just fat and carbs for dinner.

I have been making this for a few years now and my boyfriend had never even heard of manicotti before. He thought just cheese filled noodles would not be a filling dish, but it is now one of his favorite meals and he can't get enough! About 2 noodles fills you up pretty quick (along with whatever side dish you are making). I did add ground beef into the sauce and garlic salt just to add something a little more and it is delicious!

It was dull tasting even with all the spices added and I even added a touch more. It was also very dry, I used more mix and sauce than was called for and still it was dry.

Excellent recipe! My family recipe for Manicotti is a beef based stuffing without Ricotta. I've never been a fan of Ricotta, but my wife is.  I decided to give this one a try and used my personal recipe for the tomato sauce. 

WOW! What a great recipe! I don't normally care for Ricotta, but the mixture with mozzarella and parmesan was delicious. I did add some fresh basil leaves because I love the aroma and flavor, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Wonderful flavor, great texture, and all around delicious dish.

This is a family favorite.  I found an easier way to stuff the manicotti -- after cooking I slice each shell open and placed it open in my hand.  Then I filled the shell with the filling and closed it and placed it seam down in the pan over the sauce.  Much easier!  And I NEVER skimp on parm/regianno -- keep it fresh and it makes a difference!

used more cheese than called for which made it a little dry so will add more liquid if I make same quantity again. But overall simple to make and tasted great.

Made this with some of my dad's spaghetti sauce (he makes a big batch from scratch and then freezes it in 8- and 16-ounce containers) and it's amazing. This particular batch of sauce was less liquidy than in the past so I covered the baking dish with aluminum foil before putting it in the oven, just so everything didn't dry out. I weighed out 5.5oz manicotti before cooking them, since the package contained 8oz, and I would recommend boiling up all your pasta if you've got extra because I have leftover filling. But you may need additional sauce in that case.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The filling is perfect.  My only error was my choice of sauce, it was too sweet and didn't compliment the pasta and filling.  Live and learn!

Delicious, a real hit on Mother's Day.  I did substitute jumbo pasta shells for the usual manicotti shells, as I find them easier to stuff.   This also made smaller portions & provided  a variety of cheese only, cheese/ground beef, & cheese/Italian sausage shells to appeal to different tastes.  Sprinkled extra meat/cheese topping on top.

This recipe was a little bit dry  for me, I like mine to be a little bit creamier on the inside. Also, I added garlic powder and garlic salt  to make it tastier, otherwise it would've been quite bland. I will continue looking for manicotti recipes that a better suit my taste buds. I also recommend that you make your own sauce. Manicotti has a lot to do with the sauce that goes with it. I do not recommend  You you sauce out of a jar. This was easy to make, but it is time-consuming if you are a perfectionist.

So good.  I didn't have the manicotti noodles, so I cooked some lasagna noodles, put the cheese filling in the centre and rolled that up.  Worked very well.  Have frozen this dish with success.  Great to have on hand, and great to take to pot lucks, for shut-ins or to new moms needing a break.  We like this a lot!

Flavor was great. My NY Italian wife and mother-in-law gave it their nod of approval. Only thing I did differently is to use jumbo shells instead of the traditional manicotti noodles. They are just WAY to much of a pain to stuff!

Manicotti is  Italian for "lasagne that takes 4 times as long to make".  This recipe is good but I'll never make it again because  it's a lot easier to spread the cheese in big layers. The only benifit to this recipe is that since they are tubes you don't end up with the awkward corner that gets too many layers of noodles. I used the "worlds best pasta sauce" also from this site, and used 1 cup ricotta and 1 cup cottage cheese because I didn't want to go back to the store for more ricotta, and nobody noticed.

This was my first time making manicotti.  I followed recipe it and it was great.  I used a plastic bag to pipe filing in.  I also had a warm bowl of water to place noodles in.  I didn't boil.  Baked 45 min covered with tin foil.  Thanks!

Very close to how mom makes it! I doubled the mozzarella, and still didn't have enough filling for my shells. Maybe they were bigger than normal. I added two tablespoons minced garlic, a bit of oregano and upped the parsley to two tablespoons and diced up two italian chicken sausages. I was worried the sausage wouldn't make it through the hole in the ziploc bag I was using to fill but it did, no problem. Really good!

Very good! Using only one egg worked fine for me.  Also added some garlic powder to the cheesse. I did the plastic bag, snip-off corner method to stuff the manicotti for some of them. No matter if you do that or use a spoon, it's still a little messy. I saved about a cup of the mozzarella cheese to top it along with the parmesan. For the manicotti shells, as the water just barely started to boil, I placed them in for 5 min. I liked that they still had a little bite to them after it baked. I used a homemade marinara sauce from this site that I had on hand. Baked foil-covered for 35 min, removed foil and put back in the oven for about 5 min. Nice recipe!

Excellent recipe! Very easy and fun to make. Be careful stuffing the pasta. You don't want to use up your filling and still have shells left over.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  After reading the other reviews, I will try the ziploc bag filling tip and will add some herbs and spices to change up the flavor a little.  Perfect for a quick dinner .

Delicous!  I love manicotti and this was an easy recipe.  Now...I will admit that I make my own pasta (which is nice and soft) AND this time I actually tried making Ina Garten's (Barefoot Contessa) homemade ricotta.  I will never buy store bought again.  OMG sooooo easy -- milk, cream...heat...add vinegar and drain through cheesecloth and voila!  In less than an hour you have 2+ cups of ricotta.   But I digress ---  threw that and other ingredients together...rolled up in a a sheet of pasta and closed with a bit of water... lined a pan with sauce and then after putting them all on top , dumped the rest of sauce on top...along with some parm and mozzarella.   Cooked for 30 minutes ...long enough to "cook" the fresh pasta and everything else really just needed some warming.  Simple meal and delicious.  If you used dried pasta, you don't have to boil it ahead, but plan on baking a good 45+ minutes to get the pasta softened!

I made this for a neighbor who just had a baby, and they couldn't quit praising my culinary genius!  I didn't tell them it's a very simple recipe.  The only thing I added was ~1 tsp of oregano, since my husband is an oregano addict.  Excellent recipe!

Wonderful recipe!!! This recipe doesn't need any changes but a sweet friend in Long Island had given me a quick recipe for homemade manicotti crepes...2cups of all purpose flour, 1cup of water, 1 cup milk, w/ 6 eggs. Pour 1/4 cup in a pan til the edges are a little curled. 
I used the filling here but added a little garlic, as suggested by others.
Yes, I will keep this recipe and use it often.l

Everyone in my family had seconds of this dish .. Even though both my children don't like tomato based pasta sauce ! It was that good !
I  added some garlic powder to the cheese mixture and fresh parsley for dried. Also, I used only 1 egg. The consistency of the filling didn't look like it needed more.

Followed the recipe mostly as us, except I put some mozzarella on top and used garlic & herb sauce.  My husband has been pestering me to make this for years; I finally made it and he loved it

It was tricky to fill the manacotti, but it was worth it. My husband asked me to try this and he loved it. Kids were nervous to try it, but enjoyed it when they did.

This was so delicious! Such a simple dish too, I made my ricotta mix the night before and added spinach and garlic to the recipe. I feel like the spices really set in the next day.

Made it without the eggs, the inside didn't get the melted texture without them though. Also make sure to use a really flavorful sauce, kind of bland without it.

This was simple to make. I did adjust it to our taste and needs. I omitted the salt and pepper. Added some minced garlic to the filling mixture. I used Bertolli marinara sauce instead of jarred. Also a lil tip: it's way easier to fill the manicotti shells by piping in the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

I love making this recipe!  I have made it a few times now, and definitely recommend the following adjustments: I add 1 tsp each of oregano, parsley, garlic powder, and basil.  I also usually increase the mozzarella and parmesan by about 50% and use a whole box (8oz) of manicotti.  The reviewer that recommended using a pastry bag to stuff the noodles is GENIUS!  I will never use a spoon again.  It takes about 5 minutes to stuff all the noodles with far less mess and frustration.  Also, I bake covered to avoid burning the cheese/noodles, then uncover for the last 5 minutes and add a top layer of parmesan then.  It comes out great!

I loved this recipe. I gave it a four because I made a lot of changes to it and added my own spices to it. I went with other peoples suggestions and used around 6 oz of Italian cheese made by KRAFT, I also did not add salt but I did add onion powder (about a tablespoon). For the sauce I added a packet of spaghetti seasoning and let the sauce simmer for about 4 hours. It turned out perfectly.  I cooked the Manicotti covered with foil for 45 minutes then  another 15 minutes uncovered. This is a hit my house and will definitely be making it again.

Made with jumbo shells because store didn't have manicotti. Used two jars of sauce and almost all the shells. Sauteed a roll of sausage to make a meat sauce. Put the cheese filling in a ziplock and cut the tip to easily fill shells. Sooooo good!

For the most part it's a traditional recipe but having grown up  Italian-American and having eaten my fair share of food in Italy the only change I made was cinnamon.  I mix everything EXCEPT for the eggs and then add the cinnamon and taste it until I get it just right. I would guess that for the amount of mixture I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Once I achieve the desired flavor I add the eggs and mix it up. I also allow the ingredients to blend for about 20 minutes before I fill the shells. Also, I used about 23-25 ounces of sauce.

Delicious and relatively easy to prepare. Next time I will try not cooking the noodles so it will be easier to fill the noodles and maybe have more of their integrity, rather than rather flat noodles. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it came out rather dry and even dried out on the edges.  I will will cover it for at least half of the cook time and put more sauce on it. However, every one loved it at Christmas, we added a little more sauce on top and it was a total hit

My go-to recipe for manicotti. I use my own sauce but leave everything else the same. Like others have said, I don't cook the manicotti first. I use tons of sauce so it bakes the noodles perfectly. Will continue to make this over and over again.

Very similiar to lasagna, with more prep work.  I used a full 8 oz box of manicotti and a 24 oz jar of sauce, and increased the parmasan cheese to 2 cups 9whole bag of shredded cheese and had enough filling for all but one shell.  be careful not to overcook the pasta because they become fragile.

This was great! Manicotti is my husband's favorite dish and I was really excited to try this. I took the suggestions of others and in addition to the parsley, added garlic salt and oregano to the mix. I also used the plastic bag trick to fill them. Finally, I cooked the noodles for 5 minutes so they were still a little hard, but they cooked through when baking at 40 minutes. Though this recipe is a little time consuming, I will be making this again!

I leave the manicotti uncooked then stuff the shells. I ommitted the eggs. Put manicotti in pan pouring jar of sauce over. I then added water (I used the tomato sauce jar to measure). Cook covered at 425 for about 40 minutes or until most of the sauce is gone. Add more mozzarella on top and put back in oven uncovered until cheese is melted.

I had an 8 ounce box of Manicotti pasta so I increased the filling recipe by 50% and had a little leftover.  Be sure to add some herbs such as basil and garlic to the filling.  When it is done turn off the oven and top with a little more shredded mozzarella and about 2 T fresh parsley or 1 Tablespoon dried parsley if you don't have fresh and return to the oven for a 3 minutes or until cheese melts.

I made this tonight. It was my first attempt at Manicotti and it was a hit with the whole family! I adjusted the ingredients based on what I had on hand and it still was excellent! I only had half a container of ricotta so I threw in some cottage cheese to make up the difference. I also took from other reviewers and cooked the noodles halfway, added more seasonings to the cheese mixture then covered and baked for 45 minutes. I uncovered and baked an additional 15 minutes. Perfecto!!

This is my first time making Manicotti, so I was looking for an easy way. It turned out to be simple and lots of fun for the whole family! It tasted amazing, and I definitely would make this dish again!

Christmas Eve manicotti absolutely delicious!  I added a pound of chop meat, garlic salt, and onions and used one egg instead so it would be so funny.  I used the ziploc as suggested no mess and was very easy. Would highly recommend yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

First time making it, and it's yummy! Used the the gallon ziplock bag and it worked great, next time I'll cut a smaller hole tho. I added chopped garlic, and red pepper. Eating at 7pm, went shopping at 5pm. I'm not experienced in a kitchen AT ALL, living in a heavy hispanic population, with many mexican restaurants I had to go with my desire for this dish si I went out of my comfort zone and it was worth it!

Delicious! I went half cottage cheese and half Ricotta. Mixed in some shredded Mozarella and Parmesan then added a half pound spicy Italian sausage. The recipe as written sounds good too, but having a lot of experience making stuffed shells I used a combo that suites my preferences.

Have made this several times and is now a regular family favorite. The only thing I do different is a little bit more sauce and top it with cheese. Super quick and super easy, cheesy dinner dish!

Great recipe! I followed other reviewers advice and did not fully cook the manicotti before filling it. Also, I used fresh basil and oregano instead of the dried parsley. I will definitely be making this one again!

Love this recipe!! I do change it up, I guess you can say "I love this recipe" when you make major changes to it, but it is an awesome manicotti base, and great as is. However, my changes are: fresh basil oregano garlic & parsley....I also use about 1/2 lb of fresh hot Italian sausage....all added to cheese mix. 
I use whole milk ricotta in place of skim, and Italian cheese mix in place of mozzarella. The five cheeses add a richer taste.

Quick and easy! I partially cooked the manicotti in hot water, used Italian cheese blend instead of mozzarella and was quite liberal with Italian seasoning instead of just parsley. Also, the jar of sauce I had was the larger 24 ounce size and I went with the entire thing! Extra saucy and soaked into the manicotti nicely, too!

I'm not a huge manicotti fan, but my fiance asked me to make it for him, so I used this recipe because I already had most of the ingredients on hand and it seemed easy. IT WAS REALLY GOOD!!!! I've had manicotti that had some pretty bland ricotta mixture and this was definitely not bland - I did add some oregano, just for good measure.  I'll make this again, and I'll reconsider my previous views on manicotti.  :)

These were a HUGE hit with my guys!  The filling made enough to fill the entire manicotti box.  Was easy to make and easy to fill (I used my Pampered Chef pastry decorator).  I did add a 1 tsp of fresh torn basil, and it gave it a wonderful flavor!  DEFINITELY a keeper!

These were excellent! My family scarfed them down. Tip for the shells - don't cook them all the way and use a frosting bag or zip-lock bag with a hole cut out of the corner to fill them with. Works great! I think I'll use the same system for stuffed shells.

Good recipie to build off of. Finely chop mush,red pepper, green onion and some purple onion. Sauté in garlic butter. And barely cook pasta. Mexi shredded cheese mix goes great!

This came out alright, the tips of the noodles were hard when I took it all out of the oven. My oven is high powered & cooks everything a 3rd of the time less than what every recipe says, so I cooked it for 30mins. Maybe I should have boiled the noodles longer, Im going to try this recipe again, for now 4 stars.

I have cooked some great manicotti in the past, so this recipe was just okay. It reminds me of a beginner's recipe for children. It tastes better the day after at least. I agree with some other posters, that some garlic cloves, basil, and oregano needs to be added to the sauce. Maybe some cumin, some sausage or something! Kids would like this though, because the flavor is very simple, like cheese pizza.

My family ate it up. I parboiled the noodles and filled them using a Ziploc bag. Added some mushrooms to the sauce because my family loves them!

Made sauce that had Hot spicy sausage with two cloves garlic & 1/2 C onion with my tomato sauce. Served this with a balsalmic vinegriette salad & garlic bread. Mmm mmm good. Hubby & kid both gave it an A+. I dont think they would have enjoyed it as much without meat. Covered mine with foil & baked at 350 for 45min. Definately recommend ziplock bag pipeing them. Im so glad I found an italian dish besides lasagna, speghetti for the family.

Delicious! My kids gobbled it up! Only thing different I did was season my tomato sauce with some garlic and spices. It also helped me to slice my manicotti shells open and just re-roll them up once i placed the filling in them. When I tried to stuff them, I couldn't get the filling in without ripping them anyways. Worked well. I still used the 3 tbls of stuffing, that was just the right amount.

I have never before attempted manicotti until this recipe and I thought it was a great starter recipe with just a few tweaks. I did take some hints and add more seasoning; 3 cloves of garlic, some garlic powder, onion, basil and oregano. I will probably add a little more of each next time too. I cooked the pasta for 4 minutes, because the oven helped to cook it the rest of the way. I also took another users advice and filled the shells with the baggy trick, Perfect and no mess to clean up! I filled up 6 shells and still had alot of extra filling. Saved this recipe with my adjustments for my dinner rotation. Thanks!

This was a great basic recipe. I added an egg to the filling, along with fresh parsley, couple of crushed garlic cloves, a bit of spinach, some fresh basil. Yummy.

I had never made manicotti before but I love it, so I thought I'd give this a try. I had a little trouble stuffing the shells without ripping them so I ended up ripping them apart then sticking them back together and you couldn't really tell. It really is a delicious recipe. Almost took 2 boxes of manicotti shells, I only had a couple left over and they were stuffed full!

I found this recipe was amazing. I did add a lot more seasonings than the recipe originally called for, but that's just me I always add a lot of seasoning. I have made this twice and the second time I made it I perfected it. If you find this bland than add seasonings. I used a lot of garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, oregano, thyme, basil, and many others. Just went throw the spice cabinet and added all the "Italian" seasonings I could find.

This was easy to make and very good. I think adding either hamburger or Italian sausage would be good to break up the "cheesy" taste though. 
I used just regular Ragu, and didn't have parsley, so i added Italian Seasoning.
The only thing I disliked was filling the pasta. Need to invest in a piping type bag or something.

I didnt add parsley but instead used a pound of beef and 1 1/2 jars of pasta sauce.  I poured one full jar on the bottom and it seemed to work well.  Half of my noodles cracked a bit but it was one of few dishes I have cooked, Im sure I'll get it down.  Overall it was pretty easy and very yummy...my date liked it!

Thank you for the recipe, this was my first time making maicotti.  My boyfriend proclaimed it was, "Excellent!!". I did add garlic salt and oregano to the cheese mixture to give it more flavor. And I also decided to top it with some sausage. Again thank you so much, it was wonderful!!

I marked this recipe almost 2 years ago, but never got around to making it.  Tonight, after being tired of chicken or pork chops almost everynight, I thought I would try something different.  So I checked out old recipes that I had marked.  This recipe was delious.  And suprisingly, my husband (who doesn't like to try anything new) wanted seconds.  The only thing I did to ensure he would try it was add meat to the spaghetti sauce.  Then I put more monzerella on top.  Thanks for something new to us.

Good meal.  I mean, it wasn't really a meal though without meat.. more like a prelude to adding meat. I prefer sausage with marinara. With the serving size listed here, you want to use at least a 9 inch Italian sausage.

Good recipe.  Easy to make (except stuffing the shells is always a task) but for something with a little more flavor, try the Manicotti Alla Romana recipe.  I got this out of the latest cookbook from All Recipes (they had a picture in the book) and it was awesome.  A red and a white sauce made it bit more colorful and flavorful.  But this recipe is still awesome too.

Great recipe, it will be the only manicotti that I will make from now on!  Great reviews from my husband (the hardest person to please EVER).  The only problem was that I tried the 'no cook noodle' method, and the noodles were still a bit underdone after 50 minutes of baking.  Great flavor, and the baggie idea worked great for stuffing the cheese mixture.  Thanks so much for a keeper recipe, and one to pass on to my kids.  JuliAnn

This is a wonderful, super-simple recipe.  I followed another reviewer's advice and stuffed the manicotti uncooked.  So easy!  It cooked wonderfully in the oven, covered in sauce.

Great and very easy.  (I used the jumbo shells instead of manicotti).  Everybody loved it and it warms up well the next day for leftovers.

Very good!  Plan to try it with spinach sometime in the future.  Thanks for the tip on using a ziploc bag with the corner cut off to fill the cooked noodles....it worked really well!

This recipe was simple and tasted wonderful.  My picky toddler even had seconds, which is very unusual for him.  I have a picky husband and he liked it too.

This was my very first time making manicotti.  My husband and I both loved.  Allthough I found it hard to stuff the noodles.  It will be a favorite of ours. Very good.
