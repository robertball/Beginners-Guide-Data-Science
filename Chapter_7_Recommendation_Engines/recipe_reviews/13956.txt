When I made this for my husband last week, I told him the recipe looked decidedly strange and if it was awful he could make himself a sandwich for supper. Well, there was no sandwich that night. He finished what I gave him and wanted more. So did I. This will become a regular in our house.

I really loved this. The only change that I made was to use branflakes instead of cornflakes (they were what I had on hand) but I think I'll keep that as it gave it a nice colour and flavour. I made this also for my husband who loves meat (meat makes me gag) as something we could eat together but he said "It looks like chopped liver". Argh! The one meaty thing he doesn't like. I loved it: 5 stars!

Surprisingly, it does taste like real meatloaf.  We do eat beef but I was interested in trying this.  I didn't tell my BF what the ingredients were at first but he thought it was meatloaf that I had made with cornflakes instead of bread crumbs and he thought I had added cheese.  When I told him what was in it, he said he was wondering why it was such a light color.  But it was an interesting dish.

This is a great recipe. I grew up eating cottage cheese loaf and love it. I add a bit of brewers yeast to add some nutrition and flavor. I also use a bit more cottage cheese. In addition, I broil the loaf for a couple of minutes to give it a nice and crispy top.

I've been making cottage cheese loaf for years, this is NOT the best one!  It's missing celery, pecans, sage or some kind of seasoning..... and you CAN use bread crumbs instead of cornflakes....Google cottage cheese loaf for a better recipe! :)

Instead of cornflakes, use Special K. You could even try Wheates.  I'd use my leftovers for sandwiches in my lunch pail.

this was just okay for me.  I felt it needed more so added a bit of tomato paste and sage/oregano.  It turned out fine but was nothing too special.

This recipe was very tasty.  I added 1/2 cup spinach to give it a little extra.  Mine was nice and crunchy on the top but a little mushy on the inside.  I'll bake it longer next time.

I'll try anything once. The texture was weird and super mushy (even after baking it for almost double the time it stated).  The flavor confused my mouth...and I'm not sure why.  I could see some children enjoying this bland meal, just not mine.

I made this because of the good reviews, but I didnt think it was very good. Maybe it would have been better with the onions, but no one in my house likes onions except for me. It was basically just mush that had pretty much no flavor.

I grew up eating cottage cheese loaf, so I wanted to cook it for myself. It is a very easy recipe. For those that feel it's bland all you have to do is add your favorite seasonings. I always follow recipes, but make the seasoning part my own. Just add seasonings to the mixture before adding milk and the egg so you can taste it.  I gave it 4 stars since it tasted GREAT due to my added seasonings.

i made this tonight because i had my 14 month-old granddaughter overnight, and i needed to make something that wasn't pasta that she could eat with just two teeth! this was ok...she loved it, but it's very bland, so i think that i'll add some 'meatier' seasonings next time, but i'm sure that i will try it again!

Its weird to think that cottage cheese and cornflakes could turn out like a meatloaf.  It was good, but next time I make it I am going to add some seasonings, maybe some sauces too instead of the milk.

This tasted good, but the texture of it wasn't great.  I baked it for 2 hours and the top was crispy but it was still mushy on the inside and didn't hold it's shape in a sliced piece.  Maybe adding more corn flakes would have done it, but I followed this recipe exactly.  It didn't taste like real meatloaf.  I won't make this again.

This recipe came out better than I had anticipated.  
I actually used Total cereal instead of corn flakes to add more nutrition.  
Next time I will add less oil and more cheese.

I don't understand how this recipe got a 4 and 5 star rating.Like Kismet37,all I could taste was the cornflakes.I was very disappointed with this and I highly doubt I'll be making this again.

Disappointing.  I expected this to have more of a cheese flavor, but all I could really taste were the cornflakes.

The ingredients list is incorrect here and needs to be updated.

I added 500g of Quick Oats as per the ingredients and thought it seemed a bit dry in the mixing process. But as I hadn't attempted this kind of recipe before I left it at that. The baked product smelled great but was completely inedible. So I came back to check the recipe and in the notes it says you can use the cottage cheese container to measure out the quantity of notes. Yeah, that's not 500g, that's not how wet and dry weights work, its around 200g or 2 cups (less than half of 500g). 
Who knows if the recipe would be good with the appropriate measurements, I don't have any more ingredients to waste.

Nice and easy! I sauteed diced celery with the onion since I'd read it's a classic ingredient. Sweetheart said it was reminiscent of mom's decadent Ritz casserole (1c mayo/2c cheese), so I kept to myself the fact that this one is healthy! Handy for gluten-free guests.

I grew up on this but we add a package of dry onion or mushroom soup mix to it for a very good flavor.  Love this recipe and so do my kids!

This is a very good base, but with some changes this is a 5 star recipe!

Instead of 1/4c oil, I used tomato paste. I added about 1T of garlic powder, and I topped it with 1/4c parmesan cheese. 

REALLY delicious.

My mother in law introduced this to me, apparently this was her families favorite.  However I use 5 eggs instead of 1 and no milk.  It is very good and fluffy!
