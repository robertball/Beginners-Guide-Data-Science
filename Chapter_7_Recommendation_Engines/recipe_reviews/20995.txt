FYI... You can make these a lot healthier by replacing the oil with APPLESAUCE and using all whole wheat flour.  Some recipes work with these subsitutions, some don't... but my friend made the healthy version of these for me, and I couldn't stop eating them!!!  (so in the end, the nutritional value was probably the same since I was a muffin hog, but you get the point)  TASTY!!!

I cut out the the oil almost completely using only a 1/4 cup, and 3/4 unsweetened applesauce.  Omitted the raisins and coconut, and replaced it with dried currants, and dried blueberries and dried cranberries.  Excellent. FYI : 2 cups of grated carrots = 2 medium sized carrots:)

This is the second time I made these--this time I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  They were still very moist and delicious.  I also reduced the coconut by half to reduce the fat content. I grated everything by hand, so the prep time was more like 30 minutes (but still worth the work).  Next time I will double the recipe and use a food processor.  I ended up with 18 standard size muffins.  They were a big hit with the family.

These were delicious. I just chopped the apples and the carrots together in my mini food processor and it wasn't time consuming at all. Plus, it made the muffin more appealing to my picky 3 year old, who might have been discouraged by the carrot chunks! 2 cups= +/- 3 medium carrots

UPDATE- For those doing WW, this is 10 points each if you make 12 muffins and copy the recipe word for word. If you omit the walnuts (10.5 points) and use 1 cup of applesauce (2 points) instead of 1 cup of oil (57 points!!!) that will bring each muffin to 4 points, and it's still just as delicious. I love grabbing one of these for a healthy breakfast just before running out the door. :)

Sooo good! But yes, it is time consuming, what with all the shredding, but they loved it b/c it is chock full of goodies. Because I used Sweetened coconut, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and and added 1/3c. brown sugar. I didn't use oil, I subbed w/ Libby's pumpkin puree and there you have it! Another vegetable in these moist, healthy, nearly fat free muffins! Lovely and hearty and staying in my recipe file (except I'll invest in pre-shredded bagged carrots)!

Fantastic! I love the cafe bought Morning Glory muffins, and it was nice to finally be able to duplicate them at home! Using the review advice, I substituted half a cup of applesauce for the oil, which worked great.  A word of warning though if opting not to use the oil; do not sure paper muffin pan liners, as they will stick to the muffins.  Also cut sugar in half, and it wasn't missed.  I got creative with add ins, adding in some dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  These were amazing! Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!

Loved these!  Subbed whole wheat flour and brown sugar for a healthier muffin, plus I added a banana; couldn't tell the difference.  This recipe has so many good things for you in the ingredient list you don't feel guilty at all for having two.  Thanks Debbie!

These were delicious! really moist and tasty - reminded me of starbucks' sunrise muffins. i made some changes - used wholemeal flour, used brown sugar (only 1 cup), reduced oil to 1/3 cup and added 2/3 plain yogurt, used pecans instead of walnuts, didn't have apple, so added a mashed banana instead. added a splash of milk cos batter was very thick, and also sprinkled some oats on top before baking. made 14 really big muffins, took about 23 minutes to bake. next time i think i'll add some orange zest and maybe more banana or some applesauce. otherwise, really yummy breakfast muffins!!

These were pretty tasty but a little greasy.  Will cut back on the oil next time.

These are wonderful.  I used white whole wheat flour and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also put about 1/2 c. of dried milk in the liquid to up the protein content.  I bake them in a muffin top pan so that I can freeze them and then warm them in the toaster for a great breakfast.

This is a really good recipe. I made it first as stated, but then again as reviewers suggested with applesauce replacing half the oil and whole grain flour replacing half the APF and a half cup of sugar. Plus a 1/2tsp of nutmeg. I have made them with and without coconut and walnuts. It's still a good base recipe and plus nuts are always an optional thing anyway. I think my family and I prefer the healthier version. Especially since my kids are 2yrs and 1yr old, I like for them to eat as healthy as possible. For them I make these into mini muffins baked for 14mins. I shred the carrots, but with the apple I cut them in fine chunks, its a nice consistency to bite into.

These muffins are wonderful! I was looking for a recipe that would help my 1 year old granddaughter eat more veggies. These muffins are it! I changed up the recipe so they wouldn't have so much sugar. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of the white flour. 1/2 c. honey & 1/4 c. b.sugar in place of the sugar. I used 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I replaced the oil with 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce & 1/2 c. pumpkin. I also added 1 tsp baking powder. I left out the walnuts and coconut(not a big fan). Everything else I left the same. I baked them for 18 min. and they turned out perfect. My granddaughter absolutely loved them! She can't get enough of them. Next time though,I'm going to try zucchini and add 1 cup of pumpkin instead of the 1/2 cup. They were really moist, but I want them to taste more like pumpkin. I figured it up and each muffin was less than 1g of fat and around 10g of sugar. Excellent muffin, would definitely recommend!!!

These turned out great.  I deviated a little bit, based on personal preference and what I had on hand.

I doubled this recipe.  Instead of all that oil, I used three bananas and a half cup of oil (reduced the oil by 3/4 of what the recipe called for).  I also reduced the sugar by half a cup, but I believe that I could drop it down quite a bit more.  I do not like raisins, but chopped, fresh, Medjool dates substituted very nicely.  I also replaced 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat flour (I think I'll bump that up next time too), and 1/4 of the flour with a combination of almond meal and flaxseed meal.  I know I made a lot of changes, but I was really trying to make it a bit healthier.  It was really great, very moist and tasty!!

Thank you, Debbie... for this easy, wholesome yet delicious recipe! I made the following changes to suit personal taste : - •	Used 1 ½ cup of All Purpose Flour + ½ cup of whole meal flour for extra wholesomeness •	1 ½ cup of shredded juice-drained carrots (that was what I had) •	2 mashed over-ripen bananas mixed with 1 tsp of cider vinegar •	2 shredded apples instead of 1 (juice drained) •	Subbed ½ cup of oil with applesauce •	Only used 1 cup of brown sugar •	Used ½ of raisins and cranberries (lightly tossed with flour) •	Omitted coconut flakes coz I had none •	Added 1 tsp of Allspice in flour mixture.   Finally, I topped them with simple mixture of 1 tbsp of brown sugar (which I cut from muffin mixture), 1 tsp of cinnamon and some finely-chopped walnuts! With above changes, I got 16 wholesome, delicious and well-balanced muffins last night. They had a nice banana+applesauce moisture, cranberries+raisin natural sweetness and we really enjoyed its irresistible aroma while baking. These vitamin-packed nutritious muffins are not only perfect for breakfast.... but also good as light lunch or even dinner as they are really yummy, soft and nice looking! Will be baking them real soon!

For a healthier version, substitute 3/4 c. honey for white sugar and 3/4 c. applesauce + 1/4 c. oil for 1 c. oil. Add 1 tsp baking powder for a lighter muffin. Very good.

These muffins are really good! Like almost everyone, I cut the oil to 1/2 cup. I usually use applesauce for the other 1/2, but this time (intrigued by another review) I used pumpkin puree. I think it definitely added another layer of goodness, so I'll be using it from now on! I also add 1 more tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a scant 1/2 tsp of cloves (my family likes to really taste the spices). You can pretty much tweak this recipe to fit your tastes and the muffins freeze well. A hard recipe to mess up! 
(Oh yeah - last time I added some pineapple too. They were even MORE delicious!)

These muffins were delicious, but I did make a heapload of changes to them! No disrespect to Debbie... I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose; I exchanged half of the oil for applesauce, and replaced the coconut (which I really dislike) with oats. On top, I sprinkled a cinnamon crumb topping, leftover from a pie I had made last week. I know that the crumb topping isn't necessarily healthy at all, but I thought it added a nice sweet touch :) I used my food processor to chop up the apples and carrots: I only had baby carrot, so in case you're wondering - 20 baby carrots roughly equal 2 cups of shredded carrots, and two small granny smith apples were used in place of a large one. These muffins are delicious, and you feel good about yourself when you eat them!

The whole family loved these, including kids of 2, 7, and 9.  We used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  We also used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  Fantastic!

Awesome recipe! I omitted the coconut just because I didn't have any. I also used a food processor, but I shredded the apples and carrots very small, because I didn't want to have whole pieces of the carrot. Used walnuts and California raisins, although I wish I had chopped the walnuts a little larger because their texture was a bit lost. This made 12 muffins exactly, however I had to bake them a bit longer (around 25-27 minutes). Just tried one and they're great! Thank you!

Delicious muffins! I made a few slight changes.  I was out of coconut but will definitely add it next time.  I used 1/2c pumpkin & 1/2c applesauce instead of the oil. Added a few dried cranberries. Put the carrots & apples in the food processor. Healthy & full of flavor!  I got 18 good sized muffins from this recipe.

These are absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes based on other reviews and personal preference. I reduced the sugar to 1c., and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. I replaced 3/4 c. of the oil (I used canola) with pumpkin puree, and 1/2 of the cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice. I subbed cherry flavored Craisins for the raisins, because I just don't do raisins. I omitted the coconut, which probably would have been fabulous in these, but I'm trying to eat as little saturated fat as possible.  With these changes, I don't feel so guilty for having already eaten 3 of these, they are that good!

Delicious! I used canned pumpkin instead of oil, 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 the sugar, and craisins instead of raisins.

I left out the raisins, walnuts and coconut due to my family's personal preferences, it came out like a gorgeous, moist carrot/apple muffin...so amazingly good! I frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and they were to die for! Will be making these often!

oh my goodness SO good. I made them slightly more than just moist, lowered the heat to 300 so the outside wouldn't burn, and baked for about anout 10 minutes. The top became a little caramelized, creating an awesome crunch, and the inside was super moist... amazing!

Will definitely make these again! I followed others' suggestion and used less oil. I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. They tasted great. This recipe is a keeper!

took more than +15 mins. to bake, and at that, they were almost doughy - the bottoms stuck even though I buttered - raised some, but have no nice 'dome'.   However, I think I may have forgotten  the salt -but??... can that be it??? Actually, I followed the recipe and I'm a pretty good cook....so why?  ..even have fresh baking soda.. and they sound SO good!  Since I have to rate, let it reflect my attempt, not the recipe. I'm a pretty good cook w/lots of experience...and actually followed the recipe-(my baking soda is new )   the one thing I did screw up on was the salt, I forgot to add (I think)

Instead of a whole cup of oil, I used 1/3 c oil plus 1/3c applesauce plus 1/3 c crushed pineapple. YUMMY! Excellent taste and texture. Going in my recipe box!

I have made this recipe many times and it has always come out great.  I have changed nothing except left out the raisins as I don't care for them.  This has been a keeper.

DANG, so good! First, just FYI: I filled my muffin cups FULL, zero space at the top, and I got a full 18 muffins. Plan accordingly! These have a texture full of crunchies and sweet bits of fruit that I really enjoy, and my tops turned out with a shiny little crust that's a little crisp on the edges. All that in a muffin flavored little like spice cake or gingerbread. LOVE. Like lots of other reviewers, I couldn't handle the idea of a full cup of oil - but I had no applesauce, so I substituted about half of it with plain Greek yogurt plus a little splash of milk (I was worried the yogurt would be too thick, but I probably didn't need it, based on the final batter texture). I only had sweetened coconut, but it doesn't seem overpowering. I also used golden raisins because that's what I had on hand, but I love that flavor so I'm sure I'll continue to make them that way. I will also use more walnuts, and use larger pieces next time. I just spied some leftover dried cranberries in my pantry, and I might even toss those in next time. Love this recipe as-is, and also for the possibilities!

Wow! Followed the recipe and the advice to substitute 1/2 of the oil with applesauce. It did take awhile to grate the carrots and apples. It was worth it. Five people dropped by...everyone loved them!

Loved Loved Loved!!! Made this for my mini family and didn't even last 2 days! I do not own a muffin platter so instead I did a pound cake. It worked just as good. And rather then putting 1cup vegi oil I just put 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup skim milk! :-)

I guess this recipe doesn't really need another 5 star review but WOW these came out great. I didn't want to do all the chopping and shredding so I just threw the apples and carrots in the food processor. I also used pecans and dates instead of walnuts and raisins. I brought them to work a couple of weeks ago and I'm still hearing about how great they were!

These muffins are SOOOO good!  My husband loves them, I love them and most importantly my 4 and 2 year old children love them.  I also replaced half the oil with a 1/2 cup of peach applesauce - the end result was moist, delicious muffins. If I were to change anything in the next batch, it would be to add more grated apple and a few more raisins.

Theses were amazing.  So moist and tasty.  I did most of the changes other reviewers suggested: I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple for the oil, and I used 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour.  I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cups of brown sugar.  I mixed it all by hand.  The recipe made 18 beautiful, pretty healthy, moist and yummy muffins.  I did not use muffin papers and used none-stick spray in the tin.  Pulled out of the oven after 20 minutes. Thanks so much!

These muffins are great.  I don't like raisens so I used craisens, and didn't have walnuts so I used pecans.  I also halved the oil and used applesauce for the remainder.  They are incredibly moist, my kids love them...I will be making these again SOON!  Thanks

Excellent flavor, moist and delicious, a great way to have a fairly nutritious breakfast on the go. Not as easy as the name implies--I had to finely chop the apple because grating it turned it to mush, and the carrot grating takes a while. A food processor would greatly reduce prep time.

Reduced sugar to 200gms, added 50gms oats, increased carrot to 280gms
Omitted the apple, raisins, walnuts and coconut and replaced with 30gms each of linseeds, pumpkin seeds and sun flour seeds. Made it a loaf instead of muffins for a brunch party tomorrow! Thanks!

mmm. this was so very good! i only did a couple of things different. i had everything shredded and mixed when i realized we were out of vegetable oil and applesauce, so i used margarine. i also added a dash of nutmeg and two dashes of pumpkin pie spice- which i am SO glad i did, it added a lot of flavor.

I adapted this one...instead of the listed walnuts and raisins, I added pecans, macadamia nuts, fresh cherries, dried cranberries, a small amount of chocolate chips and a small amount of chopped fudge pieces.... and very lush they were too!
A huge hit with friends!

Just made these muffins tonight.  Very tasty. Worked out perfectly using only 1/2 cup of oil.  Next time I will use less sugar.  I will make these again for sure.

YUM!
I didn't add the coconut (ants somehow got into the bag. Don't you love spring?) and they STILL overflowed the muffin tins. You can easily make 14 or 15 of these. They were so delicious. Next time, I'm going to try making them with 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 Splenda to make them a little healthier, but I'm definitely making them again. Thanks for a great recipe!

We've been making a variation on this recipe for many years. This is a good basic, with lots of substitution room. I liked the idea of flax seed instead of coconut and will try next time. (Be sure your flax seeds are dry roasted or they will be gummy not crispy/crunchy.) This time we used date pieces instead of raisins; half whole wheat flour/half all-purpose; half applesauce/half oil; one cup brown sugar and 1/4 Splenda (for baking). Muffin cups depend on mood. This time, right in the tin. Perfect.

We love these muffins. My little ones munch them up, too. I usually omit the coconut, use 1/2white and 1/2 wheat flour add a 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. Pretty healthy, beautiful and delicious!

I used Splenda in place of white sugar and low-sodium baking soda and eliminated the salt as I'm on a low-sodium diet.  I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins. (I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup of applesauce as recommended by another member). The muffins were very moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Absolutely the best muffin to come along. I replaced the white sugar with Splenda and a 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce. Omitted the walnuts. This drastically cut down on the fat, sugar and calorie intake. To die for! You cannot tell I used these ingredients , they turned out fantastic. Best eaten warm to cool you get all the flavors at once.  Enough said, back to the kitchen!

These are very yummy.  I did make some alterations based on what I had on hand and health factor.  I used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 cup of wheat germ, used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white, used mixed dried berries instead of raisins, didn't add coconut, and used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce + 3 tbs oil + 1 tbs honey instead of 1 cup of oil.  I left the skin on the apple and used a small chopper to mince apple and carrots.  I used a 1/4 measuring cup to fill the baking cups.  I topped each muffin with some oats and I love the contrast between the oats and dark brown muffin. It took about 24 minutes to fully bake. I also yielded 21 good-sized muffins!  Will definitely be added this recipe to my box!

Fantastic base recipe to add in whatever goodies you have on hand! A few tips to reduce the oil: with one batch I added two ripe mashed bananas and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, and with another batch I replaced half the oil with fat free sour cream - and both times, they turned out fantastic!!  Use whatever fruit / veggies / nuts combo you have on hand - and you can easily substitute some of the sugar for honey, maple syrup or a splash of o.j.  I love throwing in whatever I need to use up - from dried cranberries, zucchini, sunflower seeds - it has all worked wonderfully. I do sprinkle a touch of brown sugar on tops just before baking.

If you like carrot cake, you'll like these.  It makes more like 18 regular sized muffins.  I will try substituting apple sauce or pineapple for some of the oil the next time I make these.

Definitely another keeper.  Made as written, expect I used half brown sugar and half white.  Also rather than shredding the apple I diced it finely.  Cook time was off for my oven ... they needed an additional 10 minutes.  But none the less delicious!! Thanks for the recipe, Debbie Clarke.

These were great!  I did make a few changes: I used half brown sugar & half white sugar, added a little less than 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and reduced the baking soda to 1-3/4 tsp and added 1/4 tsp of baking powder.  I, also, left out the raisins, coconut and nuts, because I didn't have them in the house.  I left the skin on the apple, since it was being grated (most of the nutrients are in the skin).  The end result was delicious.  Even my husband who doesn't like carrots liked it!

My family loved these tasty muffins.  I subbed pumpkin for the oil.  The carrots and cocnut gave a great texture.  I'll add another apple next time because it got lost in everything else.  The pumpkin modification gave exta fiber and healthiness.  However, easy these were not.  It took a while to get everything together.  It looses a star for false title.

These are so yummy. Although my mix did have more than 12. I still made it 12 but they did take longer to cook. I took out the raisins for family members. Will make these again and again.

These were edible.  If I were to make them again, I think I would leave out the coconut.  They also made more than 12 muffins.

I have NEVER commented on recipes but these muffins are so delicious and great for the whole family.  They are perfect to put in my kids' lunches and I love them as an on-the-go breakfast.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and 3/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil instead of a full cup of oil and they turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the new family fave!

I have made large batches of these for two events, and each time people can't believe how delicious they are.  I've used 1/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. applesauce to cut down on the oil.  Make sure you pour the wet portion into the flour and carrot portion in parts so as not to make the batter overly liquidy.  I like to sprinkle more nuts on top after I've got the batter in the pan.  They bake well in both cups and on their own in the pan.

Very Tasty! I followed the advise of other reviewers and cut back the oil to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1 cup. It made 18 medium size muffins. I'll make again and again.

Everyone loves these muffins! The first time I made them exactly as the recipe recommends and I - like many other reviewers - thought that they were too oily.  Now I use 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 cup.  Much better. To make them a little healthier but no less tasty, I also reduce the sugar to 1 cup and I use a blend of whole wheat and white flour.  When baking for a nut-free event/environment, simply leave out the walnuts.  No need to make any other adjustments.  This recipe can make 24 mini-muffins and 6 large muffins, or 12 minis and 12 maxis.

This recipe was good but I made quite a few changes to it to make it a very healthy start to the day.  I changed the flour to 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 wheat germ, I changed the white sugar to brown sugar, I put one cup carrots and 1 cut zuchinni, I also substituted the 1 cup of oil for 1 cup of applesauce....It works sooooo good this way and very very healthy for you.

I've made this recipe many, many times, but changed it up quite a bit from the start.  I use 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  I use only 1/3 cup of sugar and like brown sugar.  With all the other stuff in here, it's all the sugar you need to get sweetness.  I also reduce the oil to only 1/4 cup, then add 1/4 cup pumpkin puree, apple sauce or even a mashed banana for the rest of the moisture - and this also adds a bit of sweetness, therefore not needing the extra added sugar.  The recipe as originally states makes well more than 12 muffins.  I can cut this recipe in 1/2 and still get 11 or 12 small/medium sized muffins.

I substituted 3 bananas for the oil, whole wheat for white flour, and a half a cup of brown sugar + a 1/4 cup maple syrup for sweetener. Didn't have nuts but did add a few pumpkin seeds and left out the coconut and added about a cup of mixed berries. Oh and used 2 flax eggs as I didn't have eggs on hand. These turned out super healthy and super delicious. I did find with my changes the cooking time needed about 10 more minutes.

I love this versatile recipe, with my own healthier additions and subs. Also, my son doesn't like pineapple cooked or baked into things, and this particular morning glory muffin recipe doesn't call for it like many others do. I sub in whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the AP flour, 1/2 cup honey and 1/4 stevia baking blend for the sugar (with an extra 1/4 tsp baking soda), pecans for the walnuts, and applesauce or mashed banana for the oil. I also add 1/8 cup each wheat germ and ground flaxseed meal. Unable to find unsweetened coconut in my area, so I use sweetened. I use whatever apples I have on hand. I have also successfully subbed pumpkin puree for the oil and craisins for the raisins.

These were really good!  The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly.  They were really good, but I knew I needed to make them healthier.  I changed the flour to whole wheat flour, cut sugar down to 1/2 cut (I know!), and used 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1 cup oil.  I couldn't find unsweetened coconut, so I had to use sweetened.  These changes made the nutritional info per muffing (12 servings): calories: 247, Fat: 10.6g, cholesterol: 46.3mg, sodium: 250mg, potassium: 260mg, carbohydrates: 34.5g, fiber: 4.1g, sugars: 16.1g, and protein: 5.5g.  Still a muffin, but a bit healthier!

SOOO good!  I threw the carrots (maybe 6?) and apple in my food processor to grate--it made this recipe so easy.  As others recommended, I used a combo of apple sauce and crushed pineapple to fill a cup most of the way and topped it off with a little bit (maybe 1/8 c.) of canola oil.  The muffins were very moist--definitely a keeper.

Yummy!  I took the other suggestions: 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour, cut the oil in half and substituted 1/2 c. natural applesauce.  The only other change I made was a full cup of raisins to replace the walnuts, which I didn't have.  Made 18 muffins, baked for 27 minutes.  Yummy, healthy, and easy.  What else could you ask for?

Moist and delicious! I substituted applesauce for half the oil and added a pinch of nutmeg. I put the raisins in a bowl of water for one minute in the microwave to soften them. I had enough batter for 18 muffins, which I baked for 25-26 minutes. I'm sure I'll make these again. My family loved them.

I am always looking for something new & different to treat my diabetic hubby. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and omitted 1/3 c oil, which I normally do when I make any carrot cake/muffin recipe, and the result is always excellent! Each muffin is loaded with raisins, nuts, coconut & the wonderful flavor of carrot mix! Very moist & the flavor is spot on lovely!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe. This is definitely a KEEPER! 
There are a few comments by some of the other bakers about the prep time taking a bit longer but it is understandable when you are grating your carrots & apple by hand. Invest in a processor and you are in business! I have a small one that is about 25 yrs old now (OH MY!!!) called a "Little Emmy" & it works great! It comes in very handy at Comes in handy for lots of things.  : )

I love this recipe.  I make it with ww flour and it is great. I add pumpkin and white chocolte chips always and sometimes when I have them I will add zucchine. I figured more veggies the better.  My husband couldn't believe what was in them when I told him. He loves them. I "chop" all the veggies in my blender pretty fine so there aren't any big chuncks. It makes it easier and quicker. Thanks for sharing

These were a bit time consuming, but had I read more reviews beforehand I could have used my mini-chopper and saved myself some serious prep time! :)  I did use unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and whole wheat flour - other than that, the only thing I added extra was a little bit of pineapple (had some leftover chunks, so I just quartered them and tossed them in).  I didn't shred the apples, just cut small chunks, and I only had sweetened coconut - I probably should have cut the sugar, but didn't think about it until it was too late, but next time I will for sure.  They were definitely sweet, but DELICIOUS!!!  Really love the pineapple in them - it added some great flavor!!

I made these last night. Actually ended up making 48 of them. With 4 kids at home, I wanted enough to freeze, so they can defrost and have as a quick breakfast. I love these fresh, will have to see how good they hold up after freezing. Great recipe to make with the girls!

Delicious! I substituted all applesauce for the oil, used only whole grain flour and didn't add any coconut. They came out great. Perfect when paired with a small home-made smoothy for breakfast. I will be making these again :)

These are so scrummy!  I really wanted a good breakfast muffin, that wasn't too sweet, that I could take to work on the mornings I'm running too late for real breakfast ( most mornings!)    Read the reviews, and I also;  Used half oil/half apple sauce (mashed down two grated apples in microwave)  Used just 1 cup of sugar. Brown  Omitted the coconut  Used 1 cup of dried raisen, cranberry & apricot mix, which I soaked in hot water first.    I thought the batter looked really, really wet, but they came out the oven bang on 20 minutes, and were just great.  Maybe not as sweet as some would like, but the 1 cup of sugar was enough for me, and they are so moist and filling.    Just wonder if I would bother with the grated apple next time, as with it & the applesauce, I still couldn't taste apple, so may just use all carrot next time.    I used small muffin cases and got 14. ( The cases do stick though, as someone pointed out, so will just use pan next time).  Delicious. Thanks for recipe!

These are delicious. I stuck fairly closely to the recipe, but I used cupcake pans rather than a muffin tin for smaller muffins. The recipe made 21 cupcake-sized muffins.

I love this recipe! I did tweak it a lot, though. I switch a half cup of flour for whole wheat flour; I omit a few tablespoons of oil, the coconut and 1/4 cup of sugar (they still come out sweet); and I grate beets into it! The first time I made these I ran out of carrots, but I had fresh beets, and it gave the muffins the most beautiful color!

I used brown sugar instead of white, decreased it to 3/4 cup, used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of the oil, left out walnuts and coconuts. I tried them when they came out of oven and didn't like them warm. You really have to wait for them to cool and they taste even better the next day. They're amazingly healthy with this revised recipe and were a major hit at my husband's work.

These were great. I cut the oil in half and added about 3/4 cup of white grape juice in its place. I chopped everything very fine in the food processor: carrots, apples, nuts and coconut. It gave it a wonderful delicate texture. My kids loved them, too!

Great recipe! Used 1 cup sugar only, half cup oil and half cup of unsweetened apple sauce to cut the fat, and they turned out great. Had to increase baking time to 23 minutes and my batch made 16 muffins.

YUMMY! My 18-month old devoured them.  I didn't have coconut or walnuts and they still turned out fantastic!  Can't wait to try them again with all the ingredients.

Yesss! These are amazing. My daughter and i wanted to bake some muffins for my father. Morning Glory's are my dad's favourite so we gave these a try. I loved that it made 12 large bakery sized muffins that came out very moist and flavourful. I used my hand chopper for the apple and carrot, which took no time at all. I think the grating would have been tedious. I will be making these again. My son loved them and he hates carrots and raisins!

A very moist and chunky muffin.  Not for those who like more batter vs fruit.  They are very similar to carrot cake without the frosting.  A very good recipe.

I have made this recipe two ways; as written and with some slight changes. I'm rating this recipe a 4 as written and a 5 with my changes. If you make the recipe as written, you will end up with a great muffin. However, for the purpose of a morning muffin, it was a bit too sweet for me. I will outline my changes below which I feel take this great recipe to the next level.

1. I cut the sugar in half to 3/4 cup. I do 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2/4 cup white sugar. This is the perfect amount of sweetness and the tops of the muffins come out slightly crunchy and caramelized. 
2. In addition to the cinnamon, I add a couple dashes of nutmeg. The hint of nutmeg plays off the cinnamon so well and really enhances the overall flavor of the muffin.
3. I use 2 medium sized apples. I use granny smith or fuji.
4. Instead of 1 cup vegetable oil I use 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. The coconut oil adds flavor and 1/2 cup is the perfect amount of oil. The applesauce helps to lighten the texture of the muffin a bit and keeps them moist. 
5. Every time I have made these they require an extra 4 minutes of bake time for a total of 24 minutes.
6. I sprinkle rolled oats on top of the muffins.
7. If you use muffin cup liners, the muffins do tend to stick to them. For a perfect muffin you should ideally omit the muffin liner but they are enjoyable either way. 
8. DO NOT omit the walnuts. The crunch of the walnuts is an important texture element.

These muffins were so delicious that my picky 7 year old eater finished it off, and my husband told me that these are the BEST muffins he ever tasted.  I've always bought the store-bought packaged muffin mix, and then one day after making scratch chocolate chip cookies, I saw a recipe for glory muffins on the flour bag, but I had torn off part of the packaging and couldn't read all the directions, so I came to all recipes and search for them, and low and behold, I've come across a gold-mine of muffins, better than any store bought out there!  I've never written a review in the 2+ years on the site, but this was deserving of 5 stars!!!

Loved the texture of all the fruit and carrots. Husband asked me to sub dried blueberries for raisins and I was surprised that they made the muffins too sweet for me. Will stick to raisins next time. Also subbed pumpkin puree for oil and will definately do that again. Recipe made 16 instead of 12 muffins. They are extra yummy microwaved even without butter.

I added zucchini and skipped the coconut (not a fan), used half whole wheat flour.  Next time I'll finely shred everything, add the zest from a couple oranges, pecans and add ginger.  I will make them again for a healthy breakfast option.

These were perfect! Nice and moist - I will definitely make again. I followed the advice of substituting half the oil with applesauce. I also replaced 1 cup white flour with 1 cup wheat. I tried to follow the advice of those who suggested using the mini-food processor to chop up the carrots - that did not work for me at all. I will just grate the carrots next time.

Like other reviewers - substituted some applesauce for oil - just took a cup and put what I had and filled up to a cup - somewhere between 2/3-3/4 cup applesauce - and about 3/4 C Sugar used. And added some cloves (maybe a 1/4 tsp?) - and at least 2 heaping tsps of cinnamon - prob a tablespoonish. 
Also - used a portion scoop to put in the muffin tins, so used a cinnamon/sugar mixture to dip it in between scoops so everything came out nicely. Also added a bit more flavor. 
So not overly sweet - and absolutely perfect texture. Definitely will continue with this one.

These are AMAZING! I don't like coconut so left that out and used apple sauce instead of vegetable oil. They were so good and moist. Everyone at home and work loved them!

Next time I want to try them with whole wheat flour and less sugar (just think they would be good with a little less).

Amazingly nice muffins - I would give them 6 starts if I could. I have already made them a few times, and would do them again! Only one change I made to my liking was reducing oil to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup of plain yogurt.

These muffins are absolutely delicious. I'm not big on sweets... but after my sister-in-law made these one night I immediately saved this recipe. They're not too sweet and you can really make them healthier by using whole wheat flour and substituting half of the oil for applesauce, as mentioned by other reviewers. 

Note on using whole wheat flour: It will make the muffins heavier and more dense overall. Taste will be relatively similar, but you won't get that fluffiness or crisp muffin top that I really enjoyed the first time I ate these (used white flour). 

Other tips: You can omit the walnuts, apple, coconut and will taste just fine. Shredding will take some time, and I don't recommend using baby carrots.

Yumm!  I used a food processor to chop the apple and carrots, used applesauce instead of apple butter. put the topping right in the mix, used craisins added 1/3 C. flax seed. Use 1 C. whole wheat flour and 1 C. White whole wheat flour, used 1 C. honey in place of sugar.  will make again! Yumm.

These were so very good!  I increased the salt to 1t, used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce and kept everything the same.  (The cooking time was a bit longer than printed.)  This recipe is going in the permanent file.

Oh, yum.  My husband and preschooler dislike carrot muffins and LOVE these.  Made them with half whole wheat and half white flour, 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil, and half white sugar/half brown sugar.  Perfectly moist and delicious - especially warm with butter!

Excellent, moist and delicious. Used unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil, and whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, baked for an extra 5 minutes.

Excellent recipe! I made mine vegan by replacing the 3 eggs with 3/4 cup applesauce and an overripe organic banana. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and added just shy of 1 cup oil. Did not add the raisins or coconut because I didn't have any. And lastly, I made this into a loaf pan, bread style. I had to cook for 50 minutes in a loaf pan, FYI. Even will all these changes this recipe came out SO delicious!

Healthed it up by using all AGAVE NECTAR rather than sugar, WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR rather than white, all APPLESAUCE rather than oil, and 4 EGG WHITES rather than three whole eggs.  I sprinkled a bit of whole grain oats on the top of each muffin before putting in the oven.  These are de-lic-ious!!!

These are great. Very moist. I didn't reduce the oil or the sugar, which I think makes them moist and sweet, but I did add to the mix one peeled and grated zucchini which was yummy. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. Very very tasty. I did not have enough all purpose flour so I substituted 1 cup of cake flour and it made them very soft. Yummy!

These were amazingly delicious. I added extra carrot, and instead of 1/2 cup raisins I did 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup bittersweet chocolate chips--which was AMAZING.

This is the second time I have had these muffins, first time making them. O so delicious!! I gave some to my neighbor and to my co-workers and they loved them. I used applesauce as suggested and omitted the coconut. My batch made 22 muffins with the said ingredients. Enjoy!!

I made these with a few changes. First, I made them GLUTEN FREE by using a baking mix by Bob's Red Mill. I used the same amount of flour. I dropped the sugar down to 1C to drop the sweetness a bit. I used 3 egg whites instead of yolks and I used 1 C of applesauce instead of oil. I baked some normal sized muffins, but also made quite a few small muffins(12 regular, 24 mini).They turned out terrific! So yummy while warm. BTW, Weight Watchers, my version comes out to be 3 points per muffin, or 1.5 points per mini muffin. Don't hesitate! Make these XD

Mmm! These are one of our very favorites! I make the following changes: 1) half whole wheat flour, 2) 2/3 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups (they are still plenty sweet!), 3) 1 cup shredded carrots and 1 cup shredded zucchini instead of 2 cups shredded carrots. One recipe makes 16-18 muffins and baking for 20 minutes is perfect. These are a must-have in our house!

I made a healthier version and the family loved it. The changes included: all applesauce (no oil), half white flour/half wheat flour, only 1/4c. coconut, added 2 small bananas, added 1/4c. ground flaxseed, half brown sugar/half white sugar, oatmeal sprinkled on top, no nuts.  Other ingredients remained the same. Nice and moist! Very sweet-will probably decrease the sugar next time too.

morning glory muffins are my absolute favorite, but i haven't had them in years b/c they don't have them in stores and restaraunts around here. this is my first attempt at making them.  i'm not sure how the recipe is as written, but here are the modifications i made and they turned out great: 1.5 cups whole wheat pastry flour/.5 cups all purpose, 1 cup brown sugar instead of white, no salt, no coconut (though i would def add it if i had some), 1 cup solid pack pumpkin instead of oil, no cinnamon (forgot), extra .5 cup carrots, about 1 cup each raisins and finely chopped walnuts.  i think that's it, and they are much healthier than the original version, but still really dense and moist.  i think pumpkin works better than applesauce when replacing oil (as long as it works with the flavor of the recipe), though applesauce is a better replacement for butter, imo.  also, i got 24 muffins, batter filled to the top, from this recipe.  a big thanks to debbie for the recipe, nearer to the holidays, i will make as written but i never use full-fat, white flour recipes any other time of year:)

These muffins are awesome!! My favorite muffin recipe ever! I just love the combination of carrot, apple, coconut, walnuts, and raisins..the flavors complement each other perfectly! I only made a few modifications to this recipe-- I used 3/4 cup of sugar (I don't like my muffins too sweet), substituted 1/2 of the oil for home-made applesauce, used extra light olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and substituted 1/2 of the flour for whole-wheat. I think next time I will use even less sugar (1/2 cup) and maybe more whole-wheat flour.

Wheat & Gluten Free people: these are really easy to make WG free.  Just use brown rice flour instead of the other flour for a nutty, tasty snack.

I used 3/4 brown rice flour instead of white/wheat flour and 1/4 oatmeal.  GREAT idea
I used 1 C. Splenda brown sugar
I used 3/4 C. organic apple sauce and 1/4 C. veg. oil
I used a blend of dried fruit (blueberries, cranberries, gold and regular rasisins)
and I used slivered almonds.

These muffins are great.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone who

Delicious! I subbed the oil with jarred applesauce and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I did not have coconut nor carrots, so I put in 1/2 cup craisins and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and kept everything else the same. Mine needed 25 minutes of bake time and they turned out moist, delicious, and not greasy at all! I will definitely make this again, next time with the listed ingredients!

Yummy!!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and a pear instead of the apple. I am out of baking soda, so I used 4 tsp of baking powder. And even with those changes, they were SO GOOD!  It made 24 muffins!  Which was perfect for my full house of Christmas guests!  I always spray my muffin pan, put in paper liners, and then spray the paper liners too-so these muffins came out perfectly. I'm adding this to my recipe box!

I REALLY like these!  They taste great AND have all kinds of good-for-you things in them.  Will definitely make again.  I was very skeptical while making them, as my batter seemed very thin, definitely more like a cake batter, if not thinner.  I ended up adding a few extra tablespoons of flour just in case (would have been fine without it).  So don't worry if it seems like you don't have enough flour to soak up all the wet ingredients; it'll all work out.  I had enough batter for 12 muffins and2 mini-loaves.  Very good!

Excellent muffins! I did cut back on the oil (3/4 C), and did not compensate with apple sauce or butter.

My family loved these!  I was out of white sugar so I used brown.  Also I halved the recipe and only used 1 egg.  Had these for breakfast with Cool Off Smoothie from this site.  Great way to get in your fruits and veggies!

MMMM  Made this morning with a few adjustments to make them a little healthier.  I used whole wheat flour, substituted 1/2 C oil with 1/2 C applesauce, and only used 1 C sugar.  I grated apple without peeling it, added chopped dates, the zest of an orange, and used the juice from the orange to make a thin glaze for the tops after I took them out of the oven. My husband, son, and I loved them.

I'm not a sweets person, so I really enjoyed these muffins! They are dense and not-too-sweet, with a surprise in every bite. Will it be a carrot? A raisin? Some apple? A nut? What's not to love from a muffin with a little of everything?! It took me a little while to find the coconut, but I finally found the unsweetened kind in the health food/organic aisle.

I use half white half whole wheat flour. Then used brown sugar instead of white, adding just less than 1 cup (made 18 muffins from this batch). I sprinkled each muffin with Wheat Germ and was delighted by the smell in the house and the yumminess in my belly! I used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce - then added 2 TBSP of sour cream because it looked a little dry. These are so moist and delicious and SO nutrious for us all! I also shred 4 coups of carrots at a time, in an electric shredder. Then I freeze 2 cups each in ziploc bags. That way the carrots are waiting for me when I need them. I also, set out all dry ingridients the night before. And prep for easy muffins in the morning! It's super easy - and a great way to ENJOY making homemade muffins for the kids!

I'm really impressed at how delicious these muffins turn out with all the healthy modifications other reviewers have suggested.  I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose and applesauce for the oil (so no oil whatsoever in the muffins).  They were so moist!  I think next time I will add more nuts and try substituting brown sugar for the white.

Wonderful!  I got 18 good sized muffins out of this recipe, and I feel good knowing exactly what's in these.  I can comfortably serve these to my kids for breakfast, knowing they're wholesome and healthy.  The only changes I made were:  1) Used 1 1/2 C. all purpose flour, AND 1/2 C. whole wheat flour, and 2) I sprinkled wheat germ on top of the cups of batter before baking them - gave them a crunchy texture on top, and boosted the folic acid and vitamin E content a little.  I will make these again and again!

Amazing muffins! I used the food processor and ground the carrots, apple, coconut very finely.  I added a second apple.  I only used 1/2 cup of oil.  The batter was so wet from the apple and carrot that I was worried about it.  No need to worry.  These came out fantastic.  Left out the nuts (personal pref).  Very hearty and satisfying.  Might reduce the oil even a little more next time.  Thanks Debbie!  You made a lot of people happy.  :)

These are very tasty muffins.  A little time consuming however, with all the shredding that is needed for the carrots and the apples.  Thanks for the tip about adding the applesauce and reducing the oil.  They came out just right!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These muffins are delicious. It takes a little time to chop the apple and shred the carrots, but it is well worth it.  For a variation, I like to substitute some well-drained crushed unsweetened pineapple for some of the carrot.

I thought these muffins turned out nice & moist. They are very similar to some that I used to buy at Cub Foods. However, I thought that the amount of oil used was a little too much. Next time I will try substituting orange juice for half of the oil. Very tasty though!

I've been using this recipe for years, and I've discovered that it's very good as written, but also still works great when I change things up a bit. Sometimes I use pears instead of apples, or throw a banana in, or use dates or other dried fruit instead of raisins, pureed canned pumpkin instead of carrots, I've even used mixed frozen fruit... it's all good. Also, over the years I've stopped grating the apples and carrots and instead I throw the eggs, (coconut) oil, and vanilla in the blender with the apple, maybe a banana, the carrots, dried coconut, any nuts I might have... I just sort of throw things in there and make a slurry out of it and then add it to the dry ingredients. The "blender method" is a lot less time consuming! The kids actually like it better that way (kids tend to not like "chunks" of things in their muffins). This recipe has served me well for a long time.

These tasted pretty good, but they were super greasy! As in, the oil was pooling in the bottom of the muffin pan when I pulled them out of the oven. Not sure what went wrong, as I followed the recipe exactly. I probably won't make them again. Also, this took much longer than 15 minutes to bake, around 22-25 minutes, and the yield was 18 instead of 12.

My  husband has been asking me to make 'Morning Glory' muffins for some time now… Confession:: I had never even heard of them prior to meeting my guy! Finally I decided to try them out. Over all, a very good recipe. Easy & full of fairly healthy ingredients. A great hearty 'breakfast muffin'.

One star deducted because I found that the amount of sugar that this recipe calls for it a bit excessive. I reduced to 1 cup.. but could have easily gone down to 3/4 a cup without missing any sweetness. Also, 2 tsp of cinnamon is just not early enough for a muffin that is this hearty. I brought mine up to 3 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp of all spice as well. 

With those few, basic modifications though, this recipe was a hit. Will definitely make again.

I made these last night, they were good but I made the following changes.  I used 1 1/2 cups of AP flour and 1/2 cup cake flour & grated fresh nutmeg.  I took other viewers suggestions and used 3/4 cup of applesauce and only 1/4 cup of oil.  Prep time took longer then recipe stated, they were a hit in our family :-)

Wonderful!  I used about 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white, apple butter instead of oil, and chopped up the apple instead of shred, also used cloves and nutmeg.  OMG are these delish!  Thanks! :D:D:D

Also I wonder if it's possible to use oat flour?

Love this recipe! Don't usually do reviews but had to with this one. First, I will say I get tired of people blasting others about their reviews. Most of the reviews are helpful and I appreciate them.  Don't read them if you can't do it without criticism.  Now... I made these per the recipe except I recalculated for 6 servings since it's just the two of us.  I didn't want individual muffins so I heated about 1 T of oil in an 8 inch iron skillet on med heat, spooned the batter in, cooked for 2-3 mins and put in the preheated oven.  Cooked for 20-25 mins, testing with toothpick toward the end. This made a crusty edge which we like...very yummy!  Next time we may substitute some of the oil with applesauce, some brown sugar for some of the white, and whole wheat flour for some of the white.  But these are great as written.  Thanks Debbie.

Great recipe.  VERY moist and flavorful.  I thought a cup of oil sounded like a lot so I cut it to 3/4 of a cup and could probably have put in even less.  FYI, recipe yielded only 12 muffins (tins filled to the top).

Extremely delicious, filling and delightful!  They are moist, delicate and hearty at the same time.  I made them in the large muffing tins and then froze them individually.  Pop one in the micro for 45 seconds as you pour your coffee in the morning and you've got yourself a delish breakfast on the go that's good for you too!

Wonderful muffins!  I made them exactly as written, and, therefore, I am qualified to review this recipe.  If you make changes, don't put a review out here.  Instead, submit a variation.  It is a pet peeve of mine to read a lower rating with all kinds of changes made to the recipe, or any rating when changes are made.  I thought they came out great.  I love carrot cake, and this reminded me a lot of that.

I made these healthier by using 2 1/4 c whole wheat flour, 5/8 c brown sugar, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, omitted salt, 3 small carrots grated, 2 large apples grated, omitted raisins, coconut and walnuts since I didn't have any, 2 eggs, 1/2 c apple juice, 1/2 c melted butter and 1 tsp vanilla, made 18 good sized muffins that baked in 20 minutes.

This is a really good base recipe! If you don't have something, it's very simple to substitute something else. To try and make these even more healthy, I substituted wheat flour for half of the all-purpose, applesauce instead of eggs, and added 2 tbsp flaxseed and pretty much cut the oil in half or more (I have NO idea why you could possibly need a whole cup! It just grosses me out.) They almost tasted like oatmeal cookie muffins!

This is a delicious and very easy recipe.  I subbed canned pumpkin for the oil, dried figs for the raisins, and I didn't have an apple, so I left that out.  Next time I think I'll add a little cardamom just because I love it not because I think the recipe needs it.  I also baked this in a loaf pan rather than a muffin pan.  It makes one large loaf.

As suggested by other reviewers, I subbed half the oil for some applesauce (and whatever additions my husband made when my back was turned!). Turned out great. Will make again.

These are excellent!  Here are some changes I made to make them a little more healthy; I used all whole wheat flour. I used 1/2 c. olive oil and 1/2 c. applesauce in place of the 1 cup of oil. I left out the coconut simply because I didn't have any. Very moist and delicious! I freeze these and take one out when I want to eat it or throw one in my lunch.

I replace the oil with apple sauce and the middle part seems undercooked.  Cooked longer & the outside is a little tough.  Sounds like a good healthy idea but I won't make it again.

These muffins are great IF you are looking for a really healthy-tasting muffin (as in, you are NOT looking for something sweet with a streusel topping like you would get at a bakery).

Tastes like a little like a bran muffin...

Love these muffins! Read and incorporated a lot of the suggestions here into making the perfect muffin for me.  Used 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup flaxseed meal.  Used 1 cup brown sugar.  Used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter.  Only used 2 eggs and added bit more cinnamon.  Chopped about 8 oz of baby carrots in food chopper but diced 1 Granny Smith apple for better texture and presentation.  Filled muffin cups almost to top and did not overflow.  Baked for 22 mins.

Very easy when you have the kitchen aid shredder attachment.  I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and did the 1/2 oil 1/2 plain yogurt mix + used the Splenda Blend which u use only a litle over 1/2 cup.  They came out great!

So good! I made healthier by adding 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as I ran out of white sugar. Tasted so good, moiste and sweet. Next time I will reduce the sugar even more as it already has natural sweetener!

These are fantastic & easy!  I used the food processor for the shredding, and ended up subbing dried cranberries & copped pecans because it is what I had on hand.  Big hit with the kids and adults.  Thank you for sharing!

I haven't compared this Morning Glory recipe to others on the site, but I definitely enjoy these muffins!

I used all whole wheat flour, all brown sugar, and added dried dates and cranberries as well as raisins. I also added another apple and substituted applesauce for the oil to make these even healthier. I did about 3 cups of shredded carrots to make these moister and toasted the coconut before adding it to the batter to enhance the flavor. This recipe easily makes 18 large muffins, more than 12 as stated in the recipe.

Enjoy!

Very delicious muffins, but as written are fatty muffins disguised as healthy muffins.  The oil should be replaced (a portion or all) with apple sauce, pumpkin puree, or mashed bananas to make a healthier muffin.  I doubled the recipe and instead of the 2 cups of oil for a doubled recipe, I used 1 cup pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup apple sauce, and 1/2 cup oil.  I also used sweetened coconut (since that's what I had) and reduced the sugar to 1 cup (for doubled recipe).  They definitely could have been sweeter than I made them, but they still tasted great.  They did taste very carrot-y though and I think I would have liked more apples (or maybe pieces instead of shredded).  My 4-year-old loves these and I think next time I will try replacing the carrots with zucchini to sneak in a vegetable he wouldn't eat otherwise.

I LOVE these muffins!! I have made them twice now trying whole wheat flour and buckwheat flour and raw sugar to make them a bit more healthy.  I love knowing that my family is eating something good for them that really tastes great!  These muffins will be a regular in my house!

The vanilla flavor was overpowering.  1 teaspoon would probably be better.  Applesauce in place of oil was great!

These were delicious!  I omitted the raisins (didn't have any on hand), substituted the white sugar with agave nectar and decreased the oil to 1/2 cup (since agave nectar adds extra liquids) and added flax seeds.  This made 18 regular sized muffins.  Froze most of them, which makes for easy breakfasts in the morning!  Next time I will probably try adding zucchini and sunflower seeds to it!

I just made these.... SO GOOD. I did change the oil by adding applesauce in 3/4 cup and only 1/4 cup of oil. The applesauce was homemade from apple picking so that was delicious. I also did not add coconut, because I didn't have any on hand, but I had dried cranberries and sunflower seeds, so i threw those in. I love the texture in this muffin, I will definitely keep these in my recipe box :)

LOVE these!  I tripled this recipe because I'm close to my due date with my first little one and I wanted to freeze them for those days after he's born and I don't feel cooking breakfast.  I altered it slightly, adding a banana, a can of pineapple and applesauce instead of oil.  I also used only whole wheat flour and cut the sugar to only 1 cup (It wanted 3 3/4 c sugar once I tripled it!  Eek!).  They were so yummy!

I had to make some alterations due to the ingredients I had on hand and to make the muffins lower fat.  I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar, about 1 cup carrots, two apples and sweetened coconut.  I omitted the nuts, substituted applesauce for the oil and added two teaspoons of powdered chai tea latte.  I know that is a lot of changes but in the end, they were delicious.  My girls each gobbled up two.  I will refrigerate the leftovers for breakfast all week long.

Everyone loved them.   I substituted half a cup of coconut oil and half a cup of Apple sauce for the cup of vegetable oil.   We ate them for breakfast and snacked on them during the day

These are amazing, my son is a work out health fanatic he loved them. I took the advice of previous people and used 1/4 c oil & 3/4 c applesauce, used 1 c wheat & 1c white flour. I didn't have any raisins but chopped up some pitted dates. Wow were they ever good. thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper.

These are wonderful! Just awesome! I did reduce the sugar a bit and substituted apple sauce for some of the oil. I followed the rest of the recipe to the "T".
I will make these again and again! Thanks for sharing!

These are simply the BEST muffins I have ever eaten as well as the healthiest. I use whole wheat flour and brown sugar only. I then add double the cinnamon and some grated orange peel and some orange juice and it’s PERFECTION. Thank you very much Debbie!

Great recipe but I cut back on the sugar and oil and added applesauce and also added shredded zuccini.  The whole family loved these!

I love these-i do use only 1/4 oil and the rest unsweetened applesauce, and i also cut down the coconut (high in calories) and add more cinnamin and vanilla. They are very filling!

AWESOME! I used 1/2 whole-wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flours. Didn't have the full amount carrots, so I substituted fresh blueberries and strawberries. Also, I used only 1 c. sugar and olive oil. They were spectacular!

Good...made a few changes to make them a little healthier.  Used whole wheat, reduce sugar by half, used half applesauce and half oil. I felt that the cinnamon was a little to prominent....next time will reduce by half.

This recipe is fantastic! I used all whole wheat flour, added 1/2c of oats, and substituted applesauce for all the oil. Didn't have coconut, don't like walnuts. Used Craisins instead of raisins (didn't have those either). When the time came to bake, I remembered I had tossed my muffin pan and had yet to replace it. All I had was a small Pyrex casserole dish, so I used that. Baked for 40 mins at 350, then cut the "muffins" into slices. So good! This would probably bake well in a loaf pan and make for a great gift bread.

These were wonderful!!  I used 1/2 cup oil + 1/2 cup applesauce to cut down on the fat - they were still super moist!  I didn't peel the apple (lots of vitamins & fiber in the peel!), and I used a food processor to shred it.  Big time saver!  I think next time I'll use 1 cup wheat flour + 1 cup white flour to make them even more healthy.  Note that my mixture made 24 muffins.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mymom told me that these were her favorite muffins.  I had never heard of them before so looked up this recipe and made them that night.  I substituted the oil for 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce and 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple.  They taste better once cooled off or the mext day.  paper muffins cups stick to them (maybe due to the lack of oil?) but worth it and will make again.

I followed the recipe with only one change.  I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  These turned out delicious and very moist.  All the ingredients complimented each other very well.  This recipe made 18 regular sized muffins for me instead of 12.

Wow!  I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand but they still turned out fabulous.  I used 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, substituted apple sauce for the oil, substituted brown sugar for white and decreased it to 3/4 cup since my applesauce was sweetened.  I had to omit the coconut since I didn't have any, and added some dried cranberries and cherries since I had those on hand.  I used a jumbo muffin pan and got 9 muffins out of it.  With only two of us it was kind of a lot so I'm going to try to freeze the leftovers and see how they reheat.  Using a mini-food processor made the prep work super easy.  I'll definitely be making these again; thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  I substituted 1 cup of applesauce for the oil and they turned out perfectly.  I used sweetened coconut, so I only used 1 cup of sugar instead of the 1 1/4 cups that the recipe calls for. The cinnamon alone would've been fine, but I also added some cloves, allspice, and nutmeg for a little extra spice.  Very moist, delicious, fiber-rich muffins!

This is just the recipe I was looking for! I did look at other people's substitutions and I made a few modifications myself: I substituted 1 cup brown sugar instead of white. 3/4 cup applesauce and only 1/2 cup oil - this made them very very moist and yummy! I used 3 cups carrots instead of two which also added some moisture. I added 2 tsp allspice as I think nutmeg really adds to the overall flavor. I doubled the raisins and walnuts to 1 cup each as I like a lot of bite to my muffins. These are the PERFECT breakfast muffin that everyone will enjoy!!

Excellent.  Substituted applesauce for oil, mashed banana for apple.  Used more walnuts.  Cooked about 30 minutes and could have used more.  Great flavor and healthy.

YUM! I even made a "healthy" version and It was delicious! Very moist and good. I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of ap, 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of flour, reduced the sugar to 1 cup, left out coconut and nuts, and sprinkled with oats on top. It made 17 muffins this way at about 140 calories each!!! Very very good!!! Loved them.

Umm.....Yummy!  I halved the recipe and afterward realized I forgot to add salt.  As another reviewer suggested, I added applesauce instead of oil.  Much healthier than the waffles I was planning to have this morning. Delicious!

Fantastic!  I altered the recipe as follows: I used 1 c. carrot and 1 c. grated Golden Beet.  1/4 c. oil + 3/4 c. applesauce.  Sliced almonds instead of walnuts, because that's what I had on hand.  I cut the sugar down to 1 c. and used sweetened coconut (that's all I had).  Lastly, I used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 dried cranberries.  The reason I used beet in it, is because I have an excessive amount of beets at the moment, and my daughter thought the golden beet tasted like carrots and apples mixed together.  I am so surprised, but these came out fabulous!  They taste almost exactly like some muffins I got at a local bakery that changed hands and doesn't make them anymore!  I'm so pleased, I just had to share.   I looked for a beet "bread" recipe and couldn't find one, but now that I know it works to replace carrot with beet, I'll be doing that.  They're so good for you!  :)  (Can you tell I'm happy?  Or a nerd?  LOL )

I usually try a recipe "as written" the first time.  But, with breads, I won't even try it if it is full of oil.  So, I made these changes: 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour.  1 cup applesauce in place oil.  1 cup of sugar since the applesauce is naturally sweet (these muffins were still plenty sweet).  And because of cholesterol, I replaced the eggs with 3/4 cup of egg substitute.  These are yummy and my whole family likes them (except one child picks out the walnuts!)  Other than tweaking this to make it healthier, I followed the rest of the ingredients exactly.  Yum!

THE BEST MUFFINS EVER! I LOVED these! So yummy. Everything was great, they were very moist and STAY MOIST! (I was happy about that) Next time I will prob. use Applesauce to make it a bit healthier though. This is definitely my new favorite Breakfast! :)

LOVED this recipe! I would recommend, after shredding the carrots - cooking them for a couple of minutes in the microwave, just to make them less crunchy. I also ran my apples, carrots, and raisins through the food processor to make them extra fine & release the flavor more. 
I've been cutting back on sugar, so I changed a few things in this recipe. I used 2 bananas in place of the sugar, 1 c. applesauce in place of the oil. These substitutions make the finished muffin very moist. 
Very tasty recipe though. Thanks for sharing it!

Delicious.  I didn't peel the apples (I used two apples and not so many carrots since I didn't have that many), substituted applesauce for half of the oil (used light olive oil), and used whole wheat flour.  Turned out great.  I'll reduce the sugar next time.

These were good. I liked them but not many else would eat them because of the coconut and raisins in them.  Prob. will not make again because  they didn't go very fast.

A lot of ingredients and took a while to make, but they were good.  I used unsweetened applesauce and a little vanilla yogurt instead of oil.

Fantastic recipe!!  This is one of my favorite muffins, and hard to find commercially in my area.  I was really excited when this recipe yielded 18 muffins instead of 12.  Like a previous reviewer, I substituted the 1 cup of oil with 1 cup unsweetened applesauce.  So yummy, so yummy.

These are very yummy - I took the advice of some of the reviewers and, in an effort to make these even better for you, subbed 1 cup of pumpkin puree for the up of oil.  The flavor is great, but I find the muffin papers tend to stick to the muffin.  So whatever you do try to do with these, make sure not to cut the oil out entirely :)

Easy? Well I wouldn't say the name is completly accruate. My arm was aching from all the grating required for this recipe... But I can tell you it was COMPLETELY worth it! The muffins came out delicious and moist! I love the addition of the coconut and carrots! This is not the kind of thing you feel guilty about eating or serving to your family. So healthy! After reading the other reviews I opted for 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. Thanks for the advice! This recipe is a keeper! Cheers!

these were pretty good.  i split in half all these ingredients:  1/2 oil/applesauce, 1/2 white sugar/brown, 1/2 white flour/whole wheat, and added 1 extra apple and some nutmeg b/c we like it spicy.  i threw some baby carrots, the apples, and pecans in the processor and pulsed till desired consistency so the kids wouldn't balk at the carrot pieces in it.  i didn't use coconut b/c the kids don't like it and i didn't have any raisins.  i think i would like these much better with those 2 additions, so next time i will add for me!

I made these at the last minute and didn't have coconut or raisins, but they came out so delicious and moist. Normally with recipes like this I cut the oil in half & substitue applesauce, but someone had mentioned they were dry so I didn't want to take a chance. 
Well they came out really really moist and my husband thought they were a bit oily so I think next time I'll do the half oil & half applesauce. Although I thought they were great. A perfect breakfast muffin! Oh, I also didn't grate the apples, just chopped them fine.

I cut this in half and still ended up with eleven muffins! They weren't too hard to put together in the morning and pair with yogurt and juice.

I did half white sugar/half brown to make a chewier muffin. I didn't add coconut because I'm the only person who likes coconut in this house. (I know. What's wrong with them?) I used a dried berry blend in this recipe, too. 

These smell incredible while baking! I really liked them but the verdict is still out on the boys. I'll make these again for sure.

These are wonderful. I used 1 cup of whole grain wheat flour, 1/2 cup of apple sauce, no coconut, but a little extra apple, and baked them in a 12 count muffin pan (took a bit extra time).  Next time I will add more raisins, and may be dates.
Thanks for sharing,

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! The recipe was perfect as is. I also added 1/2 cup crasins and used sucanat (1 cup) instead of white sugar. I shredded 2 very large carrots in the processor and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. 12 muffins were in my oven for 28 minutes. YUMMMMM!!

These muffins are really great!!!!  My husband loved them.  I didn't have coconut so I used a little drained crushed pineapple and it was a great alternantive.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  This will be the only one I use from now on.

DElicious.  I made them as follows.I used one cup of whole wheat flour and one regular.  I also did half cup brown sugar and half cup white.I used a quarter cup of coconut.  I put in a handful of craisins instead of raisins and two handfuls of chopped dates which really added a lot.  I used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup of soy milk.  Other than that I used what the recipe called for.  Oh- I also sprinkled in a ahndful of bran!
The only thing I would change next time is that I would puree the carrot instead of grating it cause I like that consistency better.  This was a hit with theh kids!  Thank you!

Very good! I made a few changes though. I only used half a cup of oil with half a cup of apple sauce, 1 cup of white sugar, sweetened cocunt instead of unsweetned, and I didn't have any eggs so I used flax eggs. (Put 1/4 cup flax seeds in a blender or food processor and grind a couple seconds, then slowly add in 3/4 & 2 tbsp of water. Blend all this together for 5 minutes, and you get flax eggs!- Very healthy and you can't taste the difference. YOu use 1/4 of the mix per egg in the recipe.) I'm definitely going to make these again!

In my quest for my family and myself to eat a bit more healthy....this recipe was yummy!  I did omit sugar, using 1 cup of Splenda instead.  Very moist and flavorful!  Thank you for a great recipe.

INCREDIBLY FANTASTIC! Made them exact to recipe the first time but thought it was missing something. Made the second time with the following changes: 
. Reduced oil to 1/4 cup
. Added 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
. Replaced white sugar with brown
. Doubled the cinnamon
. Increased salt to 1/2 tsp
. Toasted the coconut & walnuts before adding to recipe
. Lightly sprinkled tops with powdered sugar after they were done of course.

All I can say is WOW... even better!  I got 24 regular sized muffins both times. My 8 year old who does not like coconut or walnuts LOVED them and wants to take them for his school snack.

Starbucks, eat your heart out! Never again will I pay £1.45 each morning for your dense "rise and shine" muffins because this recipe is amazing. Light, fluffy muffins, the best I've made this year. I also took the route of reducing 1c oil to 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce. Looking forward to a work week full of these. Yum!

Absolutely delicious!! My husband and I had these for the 1st time in a little local breakfast place on our honeymoon in Maine (we brought back 2 dozen). I've recently seen them at our coffee hour at church and the woman making them said she added pineapple to them (little too sweet). I adjusted the 1 c. oil for 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c. applesauce and after measuring the sugar called for, I shook some of it out of the cup (maybe used almost 1/4 c. less). Will make again and I'm sharing this with a friend.

This makes a tasty and hearty muffin that is a great way to start off your day. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil and they came out wonderful. Keep a batch in the freezer for a quick and easy morning bite.

I was searching for a different muffin recipe when I decided to try these.I had some dry cranberries I wanted to use up, so I figured ,try this muffin recipe.
  I had seen morning glory muffin recipes on several cooking websites, but the ingredients always" turned me off."
  I did make some changes to this recipe. First no carrots, that is just so unappealing in this home. I cut the oil down to 2/3 cup, and added two grated apples instead of the one. Threw in extra dry cranberries, doubled the cinnamon, as we love it, and omitted the nuts.
 The batch made 25 muffins, and they are just delicious!The smell and appearance of these muffins is"top notch." They bake up perfectly! soooooo goood!!!

This was a delicious recipe and I'm not a big carrot cake fan! I did what a few others suggested and cut back the oil to 3/4 cup and I left out the coconut due to family preferences. We all enjoyed them alot. They even make you feel like you're eating something healthy rather than a treat. Thanks!

Delicious!  I like to substitute chopped pineapple for half the carrots, and, at the suggestion of other reviewers, use 1/2 cup applesauce or additional shredded apple in place of 1/2 cup oil. I freeze the muffins, and place frozen in bag lunches.  By noon, they're perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love this muffin recipe...it has a little bit of everything and reminds me of carrot cake.  I do have a suggestion that made them even better.  I subsituted apple sauce for the oil and it made them a lot lighter and not so greasy.  I also serve them with whipped cream cheese instead of butter.

First time reviewing, so bear with me.  Made this recipe this AM, after a dismal failure with Morning Glory Muffins I ( my fault - made too many changes and did not cook long enough - my trash can enjoyed them) These I made with only changes that had been made in the reviews.  Used 1 1/2 cups all-purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, left out walnuts(will use next time), used frozen unsweetened coconut(may try canned sweetened flaked next time), used 1/2 cup Enova oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also added an extra step - first I grated the carrots and apple with food processor, then I dumped them in a bowl, changed to the chopping blade and put them back and pulsed the shredded stuff to a slightly finer consistency.  Muffins turned out great and have a finer texture.  Next time I will also increase the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and I may go to 1/4 cup oil to 3/4 cup applesauce.

Instead of using half oil & half applesauce, I simply cut the oil to 3/4 cup - works perfect.  Use processor for carrots & apples and prep time is cut down significantly.

Excellent recipe!  Definately grease and flour your muffin pan or the muffins might stick a little.  I also used 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg instead of the 2 teaspoons cinnamon.  These are easy and very, very good.  I yielded 15 muffins in a standard size muffin pan and let them bake 25 minutes.  Thank You!

Love! I used 3/4 cup applesauce 1/4 oil and used one banana instead of raisins. Also, substitute whole wheat flour for half the all purpose flour. I had to cook them 10min longer than recipe called for. Will make these again!!!

Made it per recipe. Grated my own carrots and they were a bit wet. No worries, they turned out great! These were easy! I'll be making these often. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't have enough of some of the ingredients and ended up adding. Too much liquid. I used a cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. Husband really enjoyed them. Will be making them again and trying different add ins. Great recipe. Thank you!

I thought these tasted great I doubled the recipes and it made about 3 dozen muffins. I also changed the oil to 1 1/2cup applesauce then 1/2 cup oil. I also did half wheat flour and half white flour. They did take about 20 mins though to cook

I don't normally rate a recipe high if I have made a lot of changes to it, but that is the reason I'm rating it so high. You can sub out ingredients to create a healthier muffin, or follow the recipe. I used whole wheat flour, egg substitute, reduced the sugar, and used apple sauce instead of oil. Also, you can change what you put into the muffins, I didn't have an apple so I increased the carrots, and I substituted dried cranberries for the coconut, and added some muslix too. I baked them Friday, and they were as fresh and moist today as they were then. I will definitely be making these again.

Replaced a half cup of the flour with whole wheat. Instead of raisins - i am not a big fan of raisins - i added a half cups of hemp seeds. It isn't a substitute but it made them a little bit more nutritious :-)

These muffins are amazing. I hand grated fresh carrots so prep time was longer and also subbed in for the oil just a 1/4 cup vegetable oil and the rest 3/4 applesauce. I also used sweetened coconut and added a few extra walnuts cause the make a great crunch! They were wonderful muffins!

Super! I had some carrot pulp left from juicing and used that instead, plus threw in a couple of overripe bananas. I figured even if they're not great i will know better for next time. Well, In spite of all that they were fantastic.

I was worried that changing over to whole wheat flour would cause these muffins to be too heavy... but no It worked fine... I put an extra egg in as well.  I don't usually write reviews but I was so surprised how good these were with the whole wheat I had to share!  
I always put in half the sugar too and throw in a few more dried cranberries instead of raisins... 
YUMMY

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought these were just ok.  Based on tweaks other reviewers made, I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups and reduced the coconut flakes to 1/3 cup since mine was sweetened.  I used 3 eggs worth of eggbeater egg whites since that's what I had.  The muffins are very hearty, but the texture seems a bit too moist, in spite of cooking them for 27 minutes.  Perhaps the texture is because of the applesauce and egg beaters, but I'm not sure since I haven't made this type of muffin before (and therefore don't really know how it SHOULD be) and because I don't usually cook with applesauce.  That being said, these tweaks reduced the calories by a lot, and I'll still probably eat them all!

Wonderful! I read a lot of the reviews, and decided to sub half of the oil for applesauce, and I used coconut oil instead of canola. Used whole wheat instead of white, and only 3/4 cup sugar. The sugar was NOT missed, it's very sweet!! I also included 1 cup crushed, drained pineapple. To make up for the extra moisture, I sprinkled a bit more flour. Took 35 min convection @ 350 in my oven. SO DELICIOUS, nom nom nom.

A friend of mine put me onto this recipe and my family loves it ! I substitute a few things: cranberries for the walnuts, sub 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil, add 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, cut the eggs down to 2 or 1 and use an extra tsp of baking powder with 2 tbls water for each substituted egg, core and chop up the apple leaving the skin on. It is a moist and flavourful recipe with a muffin, not cake-like texture. The carrots do take some time to shred, but it is worth it.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Substituted 1/2 oil for applesauce as suggested and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. The recipe made 18 muffins which was fine by me.  I plan on sharing this recipe with all my family. So yummy and healthy.

I didn't like grating the carrots and the apple, chopping the nuts, etc., because it was time consuming. But I did like the end result...the muffins are very moist, and yummy...not sugary sweet, but naturally sweet.  I will make these again, only I will allot myself extra time for prepping the ingredients.  UPDATE: this recipe yielded 18 muffins for me, not 12.

One of my favorite muffin recipes..sneaky way to inject veg/fruits in husband.. keep them in the freezer all the time..Have added lemon zest and cranberries to change it up a little..You could have fun with a few variations...I took them with me on a early morning bus trip..rave reviews..people still asking for recipe! Great recipe ..had trouble finding unsweetened coconut at my local stores?..that is how I got the idea for cranberries and lemon zest to add tart foil
to sweet coconut.

Fantastic recipe!  I cut out the oil completely and instead used one cup of applesauce and they turned out wonderfully (and a lot healthier too!). This recipe makes a heaping dozen (there is enough for 12 very large muffins) which needed to be baked for 29 minutes as they are so big. My whole family absolutely loved them!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I followed some of the other reviews and used all WW flour.  I subbed approx. 1/2c yogurt, 3/8 applesauce and 1/8 oil for 1c oil (I took a cup, poured the last of my applesauce in, dumped a bunch of yogurt and filled the last little bit with oil) and used 1c brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Everything else was as the original recipe was written.  These are moist and delicious and healthy!  Thanks, this is a keeper.

Fantastic -- I made the first batch "by the book" and then tried it with 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup of applesauce. Can't even tell the difference for a 1/3 of the fat! Great to cook up and freeze -- pop in the microwave for 20 seconds or so and you're ready to go!

My family loves these muffins and I make them regularly.  My substitutions: instead of white flour, 1-1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup flaxseed meal.  Instead of 1 cup oil, 3/4 cup pumpkin puree and 1/4 cup oil (have also used applesauce instead of pumpkin). Instead of the white sugar, I reduce to 1 cup and make it brown sugar. I add 2 tsp. allspice.  In addition to the raisins, I add 1/2 cup craisins, and 1/2 cup coarsely chopped apples (make them about the same size as the raisins).  This recipe was great to begin with and is easy to tweak to try out different ingredients - the muffins always come out great no matter what I'm playing around with!

These were good & I'll definitely make them again.  I needed 6 carrots to make 2 cups & I used my cuisinart to shred the carrots & a granny smith apple.  In place of the oil, I used 2 individual applesauce cups and the filled the rest of the 1 cup measure with oil (not that much). Omitted coconut as I didn't have any. My yield was 16 muffins.  Baking time was about 25 minutes.  Next time I might add a little more sugar-they were not that sweet.

Used white whole wheat flour and a half cup of applesauce and half the oil. They are scrumptious...

my mods-
cut oil completely, used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 non fat plain greek yogurt.
only used 1/2 cup of sugar
used raisins and dried blueberries instead of walnuts or coconut
used whole wheat flour
chopped up apples rather than shredding them- way faster!!
I used liners, next time I will grease instead- to much muffin sticking to paper :(
Tasty!!

These have been a favorite weekend breakfast muffin in my house for years. But you can make them so much lighter and healthier by subbing 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil (in place of the 1 cup of oil called for in this recipe). I also use brown sugar in place of white sugar in my muffins. It just makes them all the more delicious and a bit more moist - yummy!

I made these this AM and we loved them. I had tried another recipe but the were dry and not as tasty. Extra bonus they are so easy to make. The only change I made was using dried cherries instead of raisins. For some reason I got 18 muffins and not 12 but that is fine with us they won't last long.

I baked this for a church camp and it was an absolute hit. I left out the walnuts as I didn't have any in my house at that time and it still tasted very nice.

This is an awesome recipe.  I make a couple of changes to make it healthier (I use half white whole wheat flour and half whole wheat pastry flour in place of the AP flour, I use 3/4 c pumpkin and 1/4 c canola in place of the vegetable oil, and I cut back the sugar to ~3/4 c) but even with the changes, it makes for a delicious muffin.  The baking time is definitely off, but I adjust the temperature to 375 and cook for about 25 minutes and that's usually perfect.  This is a great fall breakfast item!

Delicious muffins but a bit time consuming.  I doubled the recipe and they turned out great.  The only change I made was adding cranberries instead of raisins.  Very moist and flavorful.

Fantastic! I, too, cut out the oil and replaced it with applesauce.  My husband and daughter couldn't get enough of them. He stated the muffins were the best he's ever had.  I'm going to attempt another batch with wholewheat flour next.  Wonderful recipe!!

Very moist!  Left out nuts for the kids.  Replaced a 1/4 tsp of the vanilla with almond extract.  Added depth.  Flaked coconut created a great texture.   Plumped the raisins with hot water before adding.

These are pretty good and chock full of stuff! I got 24 mini muffins and 9 regular sized ones.
I did make a few changes; hate raisins so I substituted 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 chocolate chips, 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar, 1/2 cup of the white flour with wheat flour, used egg whites instead of whole eggs, and 1/3 cup oil, 1//3 cup plain yogurt, and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of a whole cup of oil.

These muffins turned out great! Not only were they approved by my 2-yr old son, my husband and father-in-law also devoured them!
I used only 1/2 cup sugar, sweetened coconut, and 1/2 cup applesauce to substitute half of the oil. A lot healthier!!

Overall a very nice muffin recipe. I skipped the coconut and walnuts, and added more raisins and a bit of orange zest. It has a nice fluffy texture, but I would rather not have all the oil in them. I will substitute some apple sauce for oil next time. I think that I would put in a bit of brown sugar/molasses for a richer flavour as I can taste a bit of the baking soda and I think this would eliminate that.

Family favorite!  We don't care for raisins or coconut, so I use 1 cup of shredded zucchini instead, and I've also used 1/2 cup applesauce when I didn't have a fresh apple in the fridge.  Yummy!

Very good.  Like others, I used applesauce for portion of oil (i used 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C oil - think I could even cut down the oil more next time).

My Sunday School class and hubby loved these.  I came late so had a few leftover; was going to take to work, but my husband pleaded with me to leave them home for him.  Will make again.

This recipe made many more than 12. The regular size muffin came out to 22, not 12.

I made it exactly as written except I subbed 1/2 cup apple sauce for half of the oil. The taste was very good and not super sweet. It's definitely a morning muffin and not a dessert. The batter was very moist which surprised me a bit. After the baking, the muffins were definitely the right consistency. I think next time I would switch some other dried fruit (maybe dates) for the raisins as I thought they kind of seemed out of place.

I liked these muffins a lot but am giving them 4 instead of five stars because they were VERY sweet.  Will try tweaking the recipe next time.

These were the best.  The only change I made was to add an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple to the recipe.  The serving size is off.  Instead of 12 muffins I got 18 very generous  sized ones.   I loved the heartiness of these muffins.  They freeze very well so I can take out a couple the night before and have a nourishing breakfast waiting for me.

Great with the few changes I made after reading other reviews! I used 2/3c white sugar, 1/3c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. sweetened coconut, and added a little more carrots.  I also used applesauce in place of oil!  I loved having some carrots for breakfast :)

I had some carrots I needed to use up and stumbled upon this recipe.  I replaced the sugar with Splenda (diabetic husband) and omitted the coconut (just didn't have any).  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and used applesauce for 1/2 cup of the vegetable oil.  These turned out pretty well.  I think they need a little more spice and they really dried out after that first day (reheating them for a few seconds in the microwave helped), but they were tasty.  The kids really didn't like them, but my husband and I were happy to polish them off!

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (I used brown sugar). I also added 1/4 tsp. almond extract which makes all baked items better. I used King Arthur's light whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  Moist & delicious and a hit with my 8 year-old son and hubby!

I love these muffins!  I did make it a healthier muffin by using whole wheat flour and substituting chunky applesauce with cherries in place of the oil.  They turned out wonderful.  Now I won't have to feel quite so guilty about eating muffins.  Thanks for the great recipe!

very tasty!  I pureed the carrots, walnuts and apples with the oil so my kids wouldn't complain about the chunks.  I do think they are a little greasy--next time I'll replace half the oil with applesauce.  And, probably half the flour with whole wheat just to up the nutrition.

These were really good.  I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil to make it healthier.  I also omitted the coconut and raisins, as I dont really care for them in muffins, but I might try them next time to see if they add anything extra.  Very moist and delicious!  I will be making these again! I love how there are carrots and apple in them, to make it healthier.  The recipe made 15 muffins for me.

I did a few mods so I probably shouldn't be rating this at all but it came out great so I wanted to put down what I did.  I halved the recipes to make 6 muffins, used a whole apple, about half the carrot grated on the finest grater because I didn't want the carrot to be identifiable to the kids.  I used half the amount of oil called for (and used olive oil not veggie oil), added half a banana, did NOT use any nuts or coconut just becuase that's our personal preference.  I also used half organic whole wheat flour and half All purpose to healthy it up a bit.  I had to increase the cooking time to 30 minutes.  we added a little extra on the raisins as well becuase we love raisins :)...

I didn't have an apple, so I added papaya in its place and otherwise, followed this recipe to the T, or so I thought. Then halfway through the baking I realized I had forgotten to add the sugar. I don't know how it happened but it did! So I drizzled some honey on top while they were still warm and they turned out fabulous!! So maybe the amount of sugar could at least be cut back...

These muffins were excellent.  To make a little healthier I used 1 cup white flour and substituted 1 cup wheat flour.  I also changed the sugar to 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Friends were fighting over these.

These were delicious! I'm a foods teacher at a local high school and definitely plan to have my students make these. Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I substituted 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Also I got 18 muffins out of this recipe and used a granny smith apple...so moist too.

These were alright.. I normally rave about all muffins but this recipe just didn't do it for me. Like most, I halved the oil, substituting it with apple sauce. I also added extra cinnamon, and substituted oats for the coconuts. Used 3/4c white sugar, 1/4c brown. They weren't bad, but I've had better.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and these muffins have an EXCELLENT taste and texture.  However i do agree with other reviews that 1 cup of oil is too much....they literally left a puddle of oil anywhere they sat!!  Thus I will try the 1/2 applesauce/oil idea next time.  otherwise this recipe is a new favorite!!

This is delicious and filling muffin.  I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose, 1 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar, 4 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 2, finely diced the carrots and the apple instead of shredding, added 1 mashed banana, added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, reduced the coconut to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the full cup.  I know that these are a lot of changes, but this is the way I like them best.  It is a great recipe to play around with.  Maybe next time will try craisins in stead of raisins.

This recipe is perfect just as it is! Delicious -- I think next time I might add more nuts/sunflower seeds/whatever -- fool proof recipe!  Thanks for this. :)

These muffins were fantastic!  Because I have a juicer and hate being wasteful and throwing out the pulp, I'm always looking for recipes where I can 'use' the pulp.  Here are the adjustments I made to this recipe: I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour; because I used carrot pulp instead of grated carrots (from my juicer)I added an extra grated apple, 2t carrot juice, and 2t pomegranate juice to add some moisture back in; I also pecans intead of walnuts; I added 1t ginger; I used craisins instead of raisins, and I also cut the oil to only 1/4c.  They were perfectly moist and delicious!  Actually yielded 12 regular size muffins and 12 mini-muffins.

These muffins were much better than I was expecting.  They were moist, tender, and very tasty.  I made a few small changes.  I used half whole wheat, half white flour, replaced most of the oil with applesauce, and used 1 1/2 cups of finely shredded carrots and 2 shredded apples.  I also squeezed the juice out of the shredded apples and carrots using a cheesecloth so the batter wouldn't get runny.  Perhaps my muffin cups are small, but I got 21 muffins out of this batter, not 12, but I'm not complaining.  They should freeze well.

These muffins were really tasty. I especially liked the fact the tops got crispy and the centers were very light and fluffy. I did indeed reduced the oil to 2/3 cup, which worked great. The only change I will make the next time is to add some crushed, drained pineapple, they seemed to lack something and I think that may get it. Also,(all the health nuts stop reading here), I added a pat of fresh butter on top of mine! YUMMY!

Delicious! I used half oil and half applesauce, no coconut (I don't like it),half brown sugar and half white, added a small can of crushed pineapple, combination of raisins and dried cranberries. I only used 2 eggs because that was all I had. I made this in a loaf pan so it was Morning Glory Bread instead of muffins. Needed to bake for almost an hour in the loaf pan. YUMMY!! Debbie, thank you for posting this recipe.

These will make you feel good inside. Some changes / suggestions I made: use 1/2 whole wheat flour, use 1/2 C brown sugar (total), use shredded sweet potato instead of carrots, use craisins instead of raisins, dice the apple (green), sub apple sauce for olive oil.  A double batch made 44 muffins for me.

FINALLY - the perfect muffin recipe! I did reduce sugar to 3/4 cup b/c over a cup seems too much, and they were perfectly sweet. I will attempt applesauce next time as other reviewers have noted, the oil did make them sort of greasy, but very moist!

great base recipe that makes it easy to use any sort of fruit or veggies you have on hand (mix 'n match zucchini, carrots, apples, rhubarb, dried cranberries, raisins, cherries, etc). chopping takes a bit of time, but it's worth it. applesauce easily takes the place of all the oil as suggested. it's also easy to sneak in some extra healthfulness with some ground flax seed, etc.

UPDATE:I love these but they're not easy to just "whip up". For a brunch I was having, I measured all the dry ingredients a couple days ahead, put the nuts, raisins & coconut in little baggies and grated the carrot the night before. In the morning all I had to do was mix the wet ingredients and grate the apple. It was worth the planning. FIRST REVIEW:I was really dubious making these! There seemed like so much to do and the batter didn't seem that "batter-y". HOWEVER, they were wonderful! Very moist and flavorful. I used (preference & what I had) pecans, craisins & sweetened coconut (backed off on sugar as one reviewer suggested). I have never sub-ed applesauce for oil before but I did half/half as some suggested. I served them Easter morning with the Amish Breakfast Casserole and fresh fruit. Lots of compliments. This is a keeper.

These were great!  Not too sweet which makes them a perfect pairing with coffee or hot tea.  Used Splenda instead of sugar and applesauce instead of oil which makes them figure-friendly and not at all greasy.  Also, because of the applesauce these keep really well (not that you will have any left).  Instead of raisins, I used mixed dried fruit (a combo of golden raisins, dried apricots, pineapple, apples and cranberries).  Shredded 4 medium carrots to reach required amount.  Enjoy!

I normally bake everything exactly to the recipe on its first try. . .  I didn't have everything so I had to make some changes. . .  I had 2/3 of a cup of oil and only 1 and 1/2 cups of carrot, plus only about 1/8 of a cup of raisins.  I added about a half cup of tired and kind of dried blueberries along with a grated pear and a third of a cup of water to make up for some of the lost moisture.   These still turned out very well.  This seems to be a foolproof recipe!

I made the recipe as written but subbed pineapple tidbits for the apple. It was less work to not have to peel and chop an apple. Thanks for the recipe.

These are divine! I'd love to try this recipe with less sugar and more whole-grain flour as they were a tad on the sweet side for our family. I used a half cup of whole-wheat flour, but I think I'd add double that amount next time. Also, I think I'll try subsituting applesauce for some of the sugar.

Very good muffins! Thanks for the recipe. :) Next time I will make sure to drain the carrots as the mixture was quite wet and the carrot taste a bit overshadowed the other flavors. Still, very tasty! As always, I replaced the vegetable oil with applesauce.

Used 1/2 cup crushed pineapple instead of an apple.  Also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce.  Would be delicious with a cream-cheese frosting.  These carrot-cake muffins are divine!

I made these this morning for breakfast.  I added blueberries and instead of apples I added a cup of applesauce.  I also only added 1/4 cup of oil.  These were delicious.  An absolute keeper.  My husband ate 3 of them so far.  Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins are the best!  I am not even a big muffin person.  I highly recommend you try these muffins.  I have been on this website for a couple of years and this recipe has prompted me to write my first review.  They are so tasty.  They look very appealing.  My family could not stop eating these.  I made them without raisins to please my picky 4 year old.  I also used 3/4 cup oil, a little less than the recipe calls for.  These muffins are a winner!

These were so yummy the family loved them. They reminded us of the ones they used to have at the bakery in Disneyland. I always use half oil and half applesauce when making muffins or bread. Omitted the raisins just a personal preference. I think next time I'll use pineapple in place of apple. Thanks for sharing!

My one complaint is that they were too oily. I usually substitute 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil when a recipe calls for oil. But since I did not have any on hand, I made per recipe instructions. When I took the muffins out of the pan, there was a thick coat of oil in the pans and they smelled of the canola oil. However, when they cooled and I ate them, they were very very tasty and little hint of oil flavor. I will use this recipe again with my applesauce substitution.

Rather than add more sugar by using apple sauce (to sub for oil), I use coconut oil for some good fat and "staying power".  It helps my blood sugars to not go crazy.  Yum!

I could eat these all day long. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly moist and delicious. I think I might try the applesauce instead of some of the oil, like others have suggested, next time. But I'm really liking this original version. YUM!

Really good, but a little oily as written.  Next time I'll sub applesauce for some of the oil as other people have done.

These were really good but next time I will have to remember to add applesauce and remove some of the oil to make these healhier.  Love that I can use carrots and apples from our garden/yard!

One of our all time favorites!  These are power packed for our athlete teens to take for breakfast.  They keep you going!  I have also altered this recipe again and again to suit the season, what I have on hand, or dietary needs (I make them gluten free!).  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe.  I substituted 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt and 1/2 cup apple sauce for the oil.  You could probably use any flavor of yogurt but this is what I had on hand...Very moist and delicious.

I give this recipe a5*. It was really moist and tasty. I felt I could have added more nuts or varying types of nuts to the mix. And next time I will try nutmeg in the recipe. Such a good muffin!

These are wonderful muffins, but I found that they had way to much oil. Next time I will either cut it by half, or use applesauce. I will be making this again though

These muffins are great!! I made them for my daughters snack day at pre-school and the kids loved them. I did leave out the nuts and coconut since kids can be picky. My husband and 11 month old also enjoyed them. I will be making them again and again.

These are great muffins!  I made them with a couple substitutions.  I used half ap flour and half whole wheat.  I also used 1/2c applesauce, 1/4c butter, and 1/4 oil to replace the 1c oil.  I was able to make 12 muffins and 2 mini loaves out of the one batch.  My kids (2 & 5) and I liked them so much we made a second batch the next day which yielded 24 muffins.  Thank you for a healthy and terrific treat.  Try them with the Cinnamom Honey Butter from this sight.  So YUMMY!!

Very tasty moist muffins! I was looking for something quick for my stepson to take in the car for breakfast in the morning on the way to school. I wanted something healthy. I loved these muffins as did the rest of the family, especially my 9 month old!

Although the flavor was nice on these I thought they were a lttle dry (although I must confess I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce).  I will try again but I am going to add crushed pineapple and more shredded apple.  I think this recipe can be perfected.

I made this even easier by using baby carrots (hey, it's what I had) and putting them in the food processor and pulsed them until I had the consistency I wanted. I put the apple through the corer/peeler thing I have, then put it through the food processor as well. I accidentally used sweetened coconut because I didn't read the directions well enough before I went to the store. This still came out great! Next time I'll add more raisins, this is so good, not too sweet at all-which I was sure it would be!

These are very good!  Moist and yummy.  Here are the changes I made: I used half white and half whole wheat, you couldn't even tell I did, I had no apples and I used no subsitute for them, and I used wheat germ instead of coconut.  Next time I might try pureeing the apple and carrots, because I personally don't like the small bits that you find when you bite in.  All in all quite good - I will be making them again!  (I can definitely see adding pumpkin somehow...)

I followed this recipe exactly as written and the muffins turned out really yummy.
I took these to a work morning meeting and had one person ask for the recipe.  They were all eaten, so that's a good sign.
Will make again.

This is the muffin recipe I have been looking for! My 14 month old loves these muffins, my husband, myself, and we get our vegetables at the same time! I  substituted 1 cup of shredded zucchini for 1 cup of shredded carrots. I also used 1/3 cup of applesauce and 1 can of pumpkin mix instead of the oil. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added an extra 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar. WOW! Moist, yummy, good for you muffins.

Very, very good. I veganized the recipe by using 3/4 cup of soy yogurt instead of eggs. I also used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of molasses for sweetener instead of white sugar. Rave reviews!

I made these specifically for my husband to have on his way out to work at 4:30am for breakfast. They are VERY moist and I even replaced half of the oil with applesauce (unsweetened). They are sticky on top (at least mine were) but that wasn't a big deal. I left out the walnuts and added more raisins. Overall, a good muffin, but I wasn't "wowed" but they were a tasty way to meet the quick breakfast need that we had.

I used to work at a "From Scratch" Bakery and my favorite goodie was a muffin called Glorious Morning" and this is almost identical.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and replaced the oil with pumpkin puree and because I couldn't find unsweetened coconut I used sweetened and replaced 1/4 cup of sugar with Splenda and used whole wheat flour in place of AP.  These muffins are dense, chewy and moist.  Heaven!!!!  I plan to make a big batch and freeze them so that I always have some on hand, perfect for those morning when there's no time to eat!

Great recipe and good reviewer comments. I made the recipe as indicated except substituted 1 cup of apple sauce for the oil (worked well), reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 cup brown and 1/4 cup white) and added sunflower seeds for the walnuts. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe Debbie.

These came out fantastic. I did make alterations though.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, upped the baking soda by a 1/t tsp and instead of grated carrots (I was out of carrots) I grated sweet potato.  Came out really good.  I doubled the recipe and  had enough for 48 regular size muffins (froze half for later).  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks For the great recipe!

It's always nice to know exactly what's going into your morning breakfast, especially as all these coffee joints offer the "low-fat," "low-sugar," "egg-free," "vegetarian," "cardboard-only" type of breakfast breads.  

This is delicious!  I don't have a blender so it's good to be able to bake something without needing one.  I halved the recipe and got 10 muffins... in my new regular sized silicone molds which are amazing - nonstick so the muffins just pop out, cools quickly, and easy to clean.  Good investment (not expensive either) if you're going to make these often.

Skipped the coconut, halved the sugar, increased slightly the wet ingredients except oil.  Could have lessened the oil - they were a little slick.  Still, absolutely YUM!

This is a favorite recipe in our house. I often use dried cranberries in place of the raisins, and I always cut the sugar down to 1 cup. Tonight I used 1/2 Cup applesauce in place of half of the vegetable oil and they still taste awesome but less fat!

I didnt peel the apple, just cored and chopped it in my mini chopper before adding to the  mix. I also used half applesauce and half the called for oil. I didnt have grated carrots, so I used matchstick carrots that I cooked briefly before adding to the mix. I baked them just before my guests arrived for our neighborhood Christmas brunch, and they were a hit. Thanks!

Very good!  I didn't have coconut or walnuts and I used 1/2 wheat flour/1/2 white and 1/2 applesauce/1/2 oil.  They turned out very moist.  My 13 month old has been very picky lately, but he loved these!

Yum!  I made these this morning following a few alterations suggested. 1/2 cup oil,a little extra apple, and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour. My son and I only got one muffin because my husband ate the rest! Thanks!

I'm really new to baking, so I like anything that says "easy". Absolutely fantastic and very easy! Very Carrot-Cake like. I think I'll add cream cheese frosting to them next time. But they're great without as well.

Mmmmm, these muffins are soo good. Packed with all my favorite ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly except I used less shredding carrots (I only had 1/2 cup). Still came out great. I wouldn't leave out anything, especially the coconut (I used sweetened). The only part I might change next time I bake these is the oil (1 cup-yikes!). I might try using 1/2 and subbing the rest with applesauce.

If I could eat these for every meal every day, I would.  They are absolutely amazing, and I crave them allllll the time now.  The only thing I changed, was the coconut.  I dont like coconut so I simply substituted with more raisins...making them moist and oh so good.  
This recipe gets 6 stars (out of 5)

Just made these muffins..I used 24 cupcake liners and baked for 20 mins..Came out very moist but a little too oily for me. Will use 1/2 applesauce next time.  They remind me of carrot cake too..very delish'... and my 20 mo old loves them too...will freeze 1/2 of these for another day..:)

Moist and not too sweet! I was concerned because I could not find unsweetened coconut and used sweetened instead. Just like another reviewer, I am a stickler for following a recipe to the letter the first time. The only other change I had to make was in the baking time. My muffins took 30 minutes instead of 20. All in all, these are excellent, moist, delicious muffins! Oh, and by the way, the food processor does come in handy in the prep work. I will definately make these again!

There are FANTASTIC!! My family doesn't like raisins or nuts in muffins so I added 1 cup of pitted chopped dates instead. Made them extra moist. Also, instead of 1 cup of oil I added 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of blueberry applesause Delicious! I forgot to add the salt but they didn't need it. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Wow!  I had a bag of mixed fruit in the freezer (strawberries, blueberries and raspberries) and threw a cupful or so into the batter. That helped keep them moist, and put the taste over the top.

I too halved the oil and used half applesauce in its place; also used half whole wheat, only one cup of sugar and VERY finely chopped nuts (hiding them from the hubby).  There is some prep work but it's worth it - these muffins are tasty and more healthful than the typical breakfast muffin.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe.  The whole family loved them.  I used only 1 Cup of sugar and I substitued half of the oil w/ unsweetened applesauce.  I didn't have any walnuts, so I left them out, but I'll put them in next time.

These are really good.  I am a stickler for following a recipe to the letter the first time around (does that make any of the rest of you crazy when a recipe gets a bad review but the reviewer made all of these major changes???) but I did make a few small exceptions in this case.  We just do not care for raisins and so I left them out and I could see no reason to peel the apple - the is where the best fiber is after all - and so I didn't and the muffins were just perfect.  A food processor makes quick work out of the preparation.  The recipe must have been for the large bakery-style muffins.  I got 24 regular sized muffins.

These are marvelous!!  Moist and filling.  I only had about 1 1/2 C of grated carrots - wasn't a problem.  Left out the walnuts.  It took me about 25 minutes to bake them.  An entire cup of oil at first made me leery, but it's simple to replace the oil with applesauce.   These muffins are worth the time!

I've been searching for carrot muffin recipe for long, and this is one of the best.  It has good on both texture and favour.  But I reduced sugar to 180g (cause I think raisin already give enough sweety) and double the cinnamon portion.  I did not add coconut since do not have it handy.  But I suggest to sqeeze out a bit the carrot juice, otherwise batter will be too moisturize.  And next time, will made 8-10 larger size muffin to have its "mushroom" head.  It comes out GREAT!

Fantastic!  I took these to a morning meeting and was asked for the recipe a few times.  My friend made something very similar a few years ago and I was trying to remember what she said was in them, so I was so HAPPY to find this one.  I left out the coconut because I don't like it and I used more carrots than it called for, but it was still delicious.  My 9 year old daughter even took one with her on the way to school and loved it and she is REALLY picky.  Thanks for the recipe.

This muffin was tasty, but the texture was a bit pasty once a bite was in my mouth. I imagine there's maybe too much flour in this recipe.

As some others suggested, I cut the sugar to 1 cup and used a half cup of applesauce and reduced the oil to a half cup.  Love the flavor and the bonus of getting some of my veggies in each bite!

I found them to be just a little bland.   However , I did add a zucchini and applesauce in place of some sugar and chopped apple.  I do love the muffin top.  It was crusty.  But, they are still good.  I’m going to try to add something with a bit more flavor next time.

These are the BEST muffins I have ever had and my neighbors love them, too.  I do add the applesauce, not the oil, whole wheat flour and I use Trulia for the sugar, then I pour in a healthy handful of Faxseeds.....Oh my, these are delicious.

I also added 1 cup chunk pineapple, since I had a customized version of the recipe. So moist and fragrant! I want to save some for tomorrow since it said they get better after sitting but I don't think they will last that long.

Loved these! Didn’t have coconut or walnuts but I don’t like those anyway.  They went so fast and have had many requests for them so will definitely make these again

These were fantastic.  I used half whole wheat and half AP flour and chopped up dates since I didn't have raisins and they were a huge hit.  I'd make these again.

My husband and coworkers love these muffins.  Delicious and satisfying, and they feel like a healthy treat loaded with veggies and fruits and nuts!  Beware!  I have standard muffin pans and this recipe makes 2 dozen muffins.  It would probably make 12 jumbo muffins, like Costco sized.  The first time I made this recipe, I doubled it and ended up with countertops full of muffins- I filled both of my standard pans, then moved on to the mini muffin tins, then had to bake the remainder in a bread pan because I ran out of muffin tins.  If you're thinking about doubling the recipe, I'd suggest starting with a single batch unless you really need 50 muffins.

Left out the sugar and oil and used 1 cup of honey. Also used whole wheat pastry flour. Light, fluffy, moist, and sweet. Delicious, but yet nutritious.

These comments never cease to amaze me. It's like, I LOVE this recipe but I changed everything about it and added an additional 10 ingredients and cooked it 15 minutes longer. Other than that, it's great....Just stop. 

This was a pretty bad recipe. An entire cup of oil? Any real cook would have caught that sooner. You need a 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. In addition, you need some spices, so it's not completely bland like this recipe. I added nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and cinnamon. And yes, they take waaaaay longer to bake than was posted. At least an additional 10 minutes.

I’ve made this a couple times. The first time I followed the recipe and they were great. The second time I reduced the flour to 1cup and added 11/4 cups of bran. I also replaced the white sugar with 1 cup packed brown sugar. Also very good and a bit healthier.

Love these muffins. I changed the recipe from 1 cup oil to 1/3 and added 2/3 plain green yogurt.  I also added 1/2 cup coconut sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the 1&1/4 sugar in the recipe.

I used this recipe as a baseline but made some changes as I like Morning Glory muffins full of stuff!  Doubled the recipe,  but had no raisins or apple, added a can of crushed pineapple in juice (drained), an egg-sized scoop of pumpkin butter (because I was short 1 egg!), chopped dates, nutmeg and ginger powder.  I am rating this high as the recipe is easily adaptable to what you like or have in the house, and really does taste delicious!

They turned out delicious and moist. I substituted half of the oil for applesauce and used whole wheat flour. I also added cloves and topped half of the muffins with pumpkin seeds.

Used gluten free flour, raw sugar. Needed an extra 6-7 minutes of cooking time on convection. Cut sugar to 3/4 of a cup, still pretty sweet. Next time, will try adding a banana and nuts. Grated zucchini would also work.

This is a great, flavorful and dense muffin.  We loved them!  The only changes I made was to use 1 cup all-purpose flour and to substitute 3/4 cup applesauce for 3/4 cup of oil, adding only 1/4 cup oil.  They turned out wonderful!  They were moist and filling.  For my sweet toothed husband, I mixed up an icing of cream cheese, honey, and a dab of milk for a frosting which worked well with these.  Thanks for a lovely recipe!

Excellent! This is my new favorite muffin. It’s similar to the one I buy at my regular coffee shop, only better. I made a few small changes. I didn’t have enough carrots, so I used a little bit of shredded zucchini too. I also used whole wheat flour and replaced the sugar with Swerve to lower the glycemic index. It was still plenty sweet because of the apple, coconut, and raisins. So good! Thanks for sharing.

This is a delicious , dense muffin.  Don't expect a fluffy muffin top, it doesn't rise much.  I stuck pretty close to the recipe, making only 5 changes.  First, I doubled the batch.  Second, I used some brown sugar to replace some of the granulated (1 1/2 cups granulated, 1 cup brown), Third, I used a spice mixture similar to apple or pumpkin pie spice - I just like it better than plain cinnamon.  It is mostly cinnamon, but also includes ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cloves and mace. Fourth, I used rehydrated, freeze dried carrots.  This was a life saver when it came to prep for the carrots, all I had to do was boil water and add the dried carrots, instead of peeling, grating, etc.  If I'd had freeze dried apples I would have used them as well.  I obviously haven't tried this recipe with fresh carrots, but I don't think it would make any difference in flavor.   And finally, I replaced 1/4 of the flour with unflavored protein powder.  I'm thrilled with the results and expect that I will make this recipe again and again.

This recipie is great ,but lacking moisture . I think something was left out of recipie. So I added and mixed in a cup of sour cream . To help everything  combine. The one cup of veg. Oil and three eggs wasn't enough.

These muffins were phenomenal! I omitted the nuts because I send my kids to school with these and schools are nut-free. Also, I was going to do what other reviewers suggested and replace 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce but then realized halfway through making this that my applesauce had gone bad so I improvised and added 1/2 cup of milk. I couldn't believe how tasty they were!
I look forward to making this recipe again, this time with applesauce.

Only thing I changed was cutting the oil in half and replacing with applesauce.

I've made these several times now sometimes omitting the coconut based on family preference and they are delicious each and every time.  This has become my go to muffin recipe as they freeze well.  The next time I do these I'm going to try using almond flour to lower the carb count.

I substituted Whole wheat flour for half of the flour and almost half brown sugar for white. These muffins are moist and full of wonderful goodness!

Original recipe was great, but I use honey instead of sugar and applesauce instead of oil so it is a tad healthier.  I have mixed and matched the fruit and nuts depending on what I have and it always tastes great!

Absolutely perfect delicious muffins! I felt like they might be brightened up with some nutmeg and ginger so i added that and it didnt seem to detract from the flavour. Total winner.

These are a wonderfully flavourful, moist, muffin! I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe...Unfortunately I ran out of cinnamon and had to use pumpkin spice, but it actually turned out delicious anyway, just a little spicier than intended probably.

These are just like the warm muffins I’d pick up each morning in a Boston on the way to the T.  Spot on!  
I love the oily texture, others substitute applesauce if they don’t.  The original recipe wil keep an extra day or two due to the oil.

Ok, I've been a fan of these type of muffins for a while now. I made them today. 61 mini muffins. Here are the tweaks I made:

1 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups. 
Cherry flavored cranberries instead of raisin's.
1-small banana, it was headed south. 
Sweetened coconut as I couldn't find unsweetened. That's why the cut in sugar.
Extra 1/2 TSP of vanilla, just because.

As listed... yummy, but too much fat and sugar.  As amended, I'd give it 5 stars:  I cut the oil in half, replaced with applesauce and a tablespoon of flax seed meal.  Replaced 3/4 of the sugar with a blend of xylitol and erithrytol, used 50% whole wheat white flour.  And since I didn't have enough carrot, used some zucchini.   Same taste... way, way healthier.  Teens loved them!

It’s hard to mess this up!  I  don’t do much baking but I added pumpkin purée instead of oil as well as lots of nuts, raisins and cranberries.  They turned out moist and tasty.

Makes more than 12 regular muffins. I ended up with 12 muffins filled to the top of the liner and an additional 12 mini muffins.  Used 3/4c sugar and sweetened coconut as one reviewer suggested. Also, I didn’t have any raisins so I subbed chopped pineapple tidbits. Took closer to 30 minutes for the regular muffins and around 20 minutes for the minis. I kept adding time so I lost track of exact times. Turned out very moist and sweet enough. Kids loved them, adults loved them.  Will be making these again.

Hard to rate as I made my own alterations... but LOVED how they turned out! Noting changes for my own future reference! :) 
Changes were as follows:
- for the 2 c. flour, I used 1c. whole wheat, 1/2c. almond flour, and 1/2c. golden flaxseed meal.
- for the oil I used 1/2c. organic canola oil, and 1/2c. applesauce
- I used 2 1/2 large carrots
- I omitted the apple and the raisins, added 1/2 c walnuts.
- Reduced sugar to 1c. and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown.
- Reduced cinnamon to 1 1/4t. (2t. seemed like a lot!)
- Eliminated vanilla - seemed like enough flavors in there!
Mmmmmm!

Delicious! I’ve made this recipe twice. I used whole wheat flour to add more nutrients and fiber. I live in the Phoenix, AZ area and found I had to cook 25 minutes. I plan to freeze them and thaw one at a time for my breakfast.

Good recipe. I halved the oil and used olive oil.  Did not add sugar. Used 1/4 cup blue agave syrup and 1/4 cup molasses. Used half white, half whole wheat. And added half a small can of crushed pineapple. Super yummy. Half cinnamon and half pumpkin spice as well. Also these are amazing with cream cheese icing.

I can't understand how members can give a 5 star rating and make many changes to the recipe. This muffin is too oily and too much sugar. Better to look somewhere else for a better recipe that is proven good.  Will not be making this recipe again.

Overall, this recipe was great. I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins as well as a honey and brown sugar mixture for the white sugar (1/4 cup of honey and 1/3 cup of brown sugar), and I loved it! I would, however, recommend using less vegetable oil. Even after they had completely cooled, my muffins kept leaving ringlets of grease wherever they were set down.

Delicious. I did change out the raisins for pineapple since we don't like raisins. I also left out the nuts because hubby doesn't like those either!  I could only find sweetened coconut at the store so I cut the sugar to 1/2 c white & 1/4 cup brown. I tried subbing applesauce for half the oil just to see how it worked.  These are amazing muffins and I'll be making them again!

Great recipe! I changed a few things: subbed all the oil for applesauce and used 'Just like white' flour instead of white flour. Flung in some crushed pineapple and omitted ALL the sugar! Instead of raisins, I used a mix of cherry craisins, dates and raisins. The batch was baked up in 20 mins. Also, had no cinnamon.

Good news: it tastes really light and healthy
Bad news: there is SO much fruit in there, but I can't taste any of it. Will taste GREAT with tea, but on its own. Meh. Really needs the sugar. :( Will try again with half sugar.

Wonderfully delicious!  Pretty much followed recipe except did half white and half brown sugar, diced the apple, used half oil and half applesauce for the oil; added 1/2 tsp. each of nutmeg and ground clove.  Only had sweetened coconut and since my raisins were old and looked a little dry, I soaked them in a little water the night before.  Look forward to making again as so many others have suggested, the possibility for variations are endless.  Filled muffin cups to the top (no paper liners), each had a nice dome and made 15 for me.  Baked for 23 minutes, but started checking at 18; rotated pan after 10 minutes because my oven gets very hot in the back.  Most passed clean toothpick test and sprung back when lightly touched except for a few that still looked a little bit wet in the top middle.  Let cool in pan for 3 minutes before turning out on rack to cool and all were fine.  Had a feeling the last 3 minutes in the pan would finish those that still looked a bit wet and it did.

These were amazing! I made a lot of changes based on what others did and my own preferences.
First I did 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat
I replaced half the walnuts with pumpkin seeds
I used a food processor for the carrots, nuts and pumpkin seeds so it was easier for my toddler to eat
I used chopped dates instead of raisins and added a mashed banana
I used 1/4 c sweetened coconut and 1/4 c unsweetened coconut 
I also replaced the oil with 1 cup applesauce
I didn’t use ANY sugar. The dates, banana, coconut and chopped apple made them sweet enough. 
I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg
These were so good and very healthy with my changes.  I will be making them once a week!

Delicious!! I plumped my raisins, but forgot to add them to the recipe, what a goof. I thought these were good without them, but they would have been so much better had I remembered to add them. I did just grease the bottoms only of the muffin pans and the muffins raised really nice. I ended up with 17 muffins. It took about 22 minutes to cook. I would make again, but next time remember the raisins.

This was pretty good.  I just made these because I have everything already in my pantry!  They were not too sweet, and I did as others suggested, do 1/2 cup of applesauce instead and an entire cup of oil.  I was able to make 24 muffins total.

I have made these muffins twice now and they are delicious. I feel the oil is critical as it helps keep the muffins moist and fluffy, and I make sure to whip the eggs until they are doubled in size and quite fluffy. Since I am not a huge fan of nuts IN muffins, I usually top the muffins with coarse sugar and one half walnut on top; it makes for very nice presentation. Also, a tip: fill the muffins to the top and let them overflow while baking to get a nice muffin top. Just don’t forget to grease the top of the pan when you do this (even if you use muffin liners) so that the tops will release and come out!

These muffins are heavenly with a cup of tea.  Thank you so much Debbie Clarke for sharing your amazing recipe.  I know the recipe would be wonderful as written.  I did make some minor changes.  I used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 can of crushed pineapple.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup.....both changes are for health reasons.  As another reviewer suggested I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

I did make healthy changes and wow did they work!  No oil, yes, none.  I cup of applesauce to replace oil and these are moist as ever.  I didn't have coconut so easily just didn't put it in.  Pumped up the raisins and while they were baking I thought crushed pineapple would have been nice for moisture but they didn't need it with this batch but will for the next.  Since my husband loves carrot cake I will be sure to frost these with cream cheese frosting when I have time to plan better.  Give them a try, and leave out all that oil!

Quick and basic carrot muffins that are sure to please with their classic flavor. I cut back the sugar quite a bit. I put in 1/3 cup instead of a 1 1/2 cups. These are great muffins to hid other things in, if you happen to have a picky eater or a toddler who only wants fruit and sweets. I baked them in mini muffin tins for 10 minutes.

Enjoyed this recipe for breakfast/snacks. Adjustments, half the oil replaced the other half with yogurt (might replace with purred carrots next time), added 1T fresh ground ginger (would double that next time), double the cinnamon, other than that followed the recipe as it. Very moist, enjoy the pineapple in it.

I used whole wheat flour, in place of white.  I also used coconut oil, in lieu of vegetable oil.  I may reduce oil to 3/4 C next time I make, just to experiment with healthier option.

These turned out so delicious! I did substitute apple sauce for the oil and cut the sugar almost completely out by using a 1/3 off cup brown sugar and and 1/3 of a cup of honey. But they still turned out scrumptious!

A very healthy and tasty breakfast muffin. My husband loves them and I freeze them for him so he can quickly nuke them for breakfast. The only change I made was to add about a quarter cup of extra coconut, and to use softened butter rather than oil. Butter is healthier than vegetable oil and I find tastes better. Apple sauce could also be substituted for some of the butter and I will try this next time. I will definitely make these again!

Simply delightful, easily adaptable, I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar. Added 2 tablespoons honey to the shredded carrot and cinnamon mixture, let set until I finished mixing dry ingredients. Instead of raisins, I had on hand combinations of dried fruits..cherries, figs, dates... great results,

Used whole wheat flour. Subbed 1 C oil with 1/2 apple sauce, 1/2 oil. Reduced sugar to 1/2 C.

I like the taste, but there was way too much oil.  Literally dripping afterwards.
Next time I will use less oil, or use applesauce instead.

These were wonderful and so easy! I got 15 muffins out of it. The only changes I made like others was I replaced the oil with  1 cup applesauce and instead of white sugar, I used what I had on hand; organic coconut palm sugar. I didn't have raisins so I used cranberries. Wished I added some blueberries which I had. They smell heavenly! Haven't tried one yet since I made them for a camp trip. Hard to resist!

This is the second time I made these - first time using 1 cup oil, and second time using 3/4 unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1 cup of oil.  Both are good, but I would not use muffin papers if you use applesauce replacement.  I used them the first time, but after reading some of the reviews I didn't the second time.  Good advice, as I think most of the muffin would stay on the wrapper paper.  I made 12 large and 24 mini muffins from this recipe - I think I use a wee bit more carrot and a very large apple.  Mini muffins took 14 minutes and the larger ones 22 minutes.  Going to be a regular muffin at our house!  Yummy.

These are so good!! I made a couple alterations. I used a gluten free all purpose flour mix instead, and used 1 cup sugar, and only a half cup apple sauce. These turned out moist and delicious!! Will definitely be making this again

Muffins needed about 8 more minutes of baking. I will reduce the oil measurement next time

I made this recipe  with a couple minor changes. I had a strawberry rhubarb purée that I had made so substituted half the oil with the purée.  Instead of walnuts I used pecans since I prefer them. The muffins are light; not oily at all and deliciously flavourful.  I will definitely make them again.

Sooo goooood!
I did not add raisins and walnuts.
I doubled the apple portion and added oats and a bit of nutmeg as well.
I used whole wheat flour and canola oil.
Turned out fantastic!

I substituted whole wheat flour and also added approx. 1/4 cup each of flax, wheat bran, wheat germ and cocoa powder. I also added about 2 tbsp of hemp seeds. Instead of the sugar, I added approx. 1/4 cup of honey, but next time I'll try leaving sugars out all together as the fruit and carrots have so much natural sugar already. I shredded an extra apple in as well. I didn't substitute any oil, and I'm on the fence about whether using fruit/apple sauce is healthier than oil as there is a lot of additional natural sugars in fruit, and there is already a lot of fruit in the recipe. Perhaps using a banana and 3/4 cup of a healthier oil (avocado oil?) could be better than vegetable oil? I'm uncertain. Let me know if you have any comments on this.

Really good recipe, just a tad too sweet for my taste--but I used half coconut oil and  half  organic apple sauce, and the apple sauce was sweetened, so I cut the sugar to under half a cup, but  I guess it wasn't enough!

Took more time than other muffin recipes. Needed to cook for 30 minutes. I think I will cut the oil to 3/4 cup. I used paper cases and there was a lot of oil in the bottom of each muffin cup after removing them. Tasty and good looking. Will make again.

These tasty beauties baked up perfectly! To make them a tad bit healthier, I used all organic ingredients, subbing 1/4 cup unrefined coconut oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened cinnamon  applesauce. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup total (subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup agave). I topped them with maple cinnamon pumpkin seed granola before baking, which gave the mufffin tops a nice crunch. I feel good about my 8 year-old DD snacking on these or grabbing one for an on-the-go breakfast.

These were delicious. I usually make 9 muffins instead of 12 but this recipe definitely will make 12 nice sized muffins.. I had a difficult time getting them to cook all the way through with the larger 9 muffins. These a so moist I may cut down the oil by 1/2 next time. I will be making these often.

Really yummy and moist. I will definitely make these again.
I didn't modify the receipe too much.  Used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of 1 cup of oil. Added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 white. Added a handful of pumpkin seeds just for fun.

These were good but the reason for 4 stars is becUse they are sticky - like the tops are moist and sticky and I don't care for that in a muffin.  Little thing, but to each their own I gues.  Still a great flavor!

Awesome muffin recipe, Debbie. I followed the recipe exactly as written. For a more flavorful coconut and nut experience, I always toast the coconut and walnuts, no matter what recipe I happen to be making. Thanks for sharing!

1 cup sugar.  I used cranberries instead of raisins.   It made 12 large and 12 mini muffins.
I added flax seed and hemp hearts but I won't tell the family that ??

I used a food processor to shred the carrots and apple (peel and all) and even the raisins and nuts. I did use pecans instead of walnuts, I cut the cinnamon in half, I used desiccated coconut, and I used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup of the all purpose flour. I'm happy I disguised all the ingredients because my picky 3 and 6 year-olds didn't notice anything unusual about the muffin.

Next time I make it, I want to try using 1/2 cup less sugar and subbing out 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce.

Fabulous recipe!  Easy to assemble!
I first made them exactly as recipe is listed - they were wonderful.   Then, I decided to be a little more mindful of calories and fat, so I made the following slight changes:
* 1 cup of cinnamon applesauce instead of oil
* Coconut palm sugar & brown sugar (equal amounts) instead of white sugar
*Added 1/2 cup of uncooked Millet for crunch instead of walnuts
They were wonderful this way as well.   Served them Christmas morning - big hit.

I LOVE this. Didn't have enough white sugar luckily. Used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white. Also, didn't have coconut or walnuts, just added 1/4 cup leftover muesli cereal and 1.5 apples instead of 1.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I attempted to make this following the directions, but after adding half the oil I realized it was going to be far too moist so I ended up not putting it in. Even doing that, I ended up with muffins that were pretty soggy and didn't rise. Adding an extra teaspoon of baking soda to the second batch, and about a 3rd of a cup of oatmeal helped. Great recipe for some of the basics but far too much oil!

I made these followed the recipe to a T they came out perfectly.  I then decided on a second attempt with a few tweaks using oat flour, raw honey and maple syrup replaced the walnuts with sunflower and pumpkin seeds and added orange zest used one part baking powder and one part baking soda they came out just as good. A great quick recipe thank you :-)!

Excellent muffins!  I did not use raisins or walnuts.  I put about a cup of cranberries in as well as extra coconut - about 1 cup.  Also the coconut was sweetened because that is what I had.  I also used Whole Wheat flour instead of white.  I used applesauce instead of oil.  Very good!!

I loved these muffins! However, I was surprised by the amount of oil and sugar. Next time I will follow the other suggestions to replace these ingredients with applesauce.

Although I am certain the recipe above is wonderful I did follow others suggestions to make the muffins a tad healthier.
I substituted half the oil with applesauce and reduced sugar to 2/3 cup and added 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I added 1/4 cup oatmeal in place of 1/4 cup of the flour and I chopped the apple as opposed to shredding it.  Thank you, Debbie, for the great recipe that we can adapt so easily.

These were delicious and easy. I used my mini food processor to cut prep time. I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. I cut the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup. I used the full amount of oil. These were moist  and almost oily. Next time, I will try reducing  oil, too. I think these would still be moist with less oil. My kids loved these. I'll definitely make them again!

I did a double recipe and it was great! only "whole wheat white flour." All the carrots and apple I felt it was healthy and I can eat a muffin for all of breakfast or a large portion of lunch and be fine! I added what I had on hand dried blueberries, a few chocolate chips, and a little ground coconut. It wasn't a huge hit with kids in a devour it kind of way but they liked it and I'm not looking for a dessert but a side-dish/real food item. I can tweak what I put in it and I think it'll be even better with the kids :)

Wonderful! Wanted to make something that had some healthy ingredients for my kids who are both sick with very sore & tender throats. These are tender & wonderful. I just skipped the nuts & used medium sweet coconut as that is all I had.

Delicious!  I didn't have coconut or walnuts.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.  The muffins came out great!  The only thing was that the baking time was well over 20 minutes... At least 30 min!

Makes a hearty, moist muffin.
I substituted half of the oil with Greek yogourt to cut down the fat content. Otherwise, it is perfect as is. My husband loved these for breakfast, and he generally doesn't like sweets.

I cut back on 1/4 cup of sugar  (and replaced half of the remaining cup with brown sugar), and used a bit less leavening to compensate for the mile high city. They were phenomenal!  I can't finish an entire batch on my own, but I left a plate near the door to my building and they were gone within the hour :) 

PS why are people cutting down on the oil content? The fruit sugars (and added sugars) in this recipe are great for a quick burst of energy, but it's those oils that are going to keep you energized through the morning. You can switch it up and use different oils, too. Avocado and Coconut oils would both be chock full of essential lipids, and a 50/50 mix would be great in these!

One of these with a shake and some coffee, and you're a god among morning commuters.

I tried this recipe a couple times and found that 1 cup sugar (mix of white and brown) was the right amount.  In place of just oil, I subbed 1 cup pumpkin puree and 1/4 cup oil, which kept it plenty moist.  I also added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 ground cloves with the cinnamon, which complemented the pumpkin nicely. I also left out the walnuts and coconut (not a fan) but sprinkled sunflower seeds liberally on top, which gave it a nice crunch.  Everything else was as described. Lastly, if you're using larger  muffin tins, 30 minutes cooking time worked about right. Great recipe to modify to your liking!

Made these dozens of times and they are always perfect. I use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil to make them less greasy.

These are great! I doubled the recipe so I'm well stocked for company coming in. My husband who does like coconut, walnuts and muffins won't stop eating them. I didn't have apples so used 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, otherwise I followed the recipe.

I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and didn't notice a thing. They were still sweet and I will probably cut it by more next time or try substituting honey instead! I would also like to try substituting coconut oil for the vegetable oil. Fat doesn't make you fat, people! :) Sugar is the enemy, not fat. 
Oh and I put raw pepitas on top for a nice dash of green color.

Like others, I swapped the oil & used unsweetened applesauce.  I also cut the sugar by about 1/2 and split it half sugar white, half brown.  Added about 2 T honey and sprinkled oats in the top as the picture shows.
My husband & toddlers loved these.

These were great! I followed the directions exactly as I like to do the first time. I will make again for sure, but I will cut the oil to 1/2 cup only to spare the fat, and I'll cut sugar to 3/4 cup. It was so delicious just as directed, and I am only going to make changes for health sake :)

A keeper! I made it using 50% whole wheat pastry flour/ 50% white flour, brown sugar instead of white, pecans instead of walnuts, and olive oil instead of veg oil. They were a little greasy, but I like the staying power they give the kids (they're not begging snacks right after breakfast). Good to eat with yogurt for fast breakfast. I'll probably make again using 50/50 oil/applesauce, and sub blueberries for raisins. Will also try adding flax meal for part of the eggs/oil. Great way to use up old apples! Thanks for sharing.

Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I work for a food service company so our cafe at the office is top-notch.  These easily rival the ones I get there without the outrageous cost!

Made vegan by using egg replacer and took the advise of many reviews by switching out 1/2 the oil for applesauce.
Otherwise followed as written -- easy and delicious!

All respect to the recipe, I used it as a launch and here's what I changed (also halved for 6 muffins): 1 1/2 cups shredded carrot, 1/2 cup applesauce and splash of oil, heaping cup of flour (combo of wheat, coconut, and almond), chocolate chips, 2 eggs, and subbed honey for sugar but just 1/4 cup. Made 8 - delicious, will make again!!

Yum! I usually make as written but I really wanted to try to make a healthy muffin for my 5 year old muffin monster. 
In this case, I substituted half the oil for applesauce. I also substituted half the all purpose flour for 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and put in only 1/2 cup sugar. I left out the raisins because he doesn't like them in baked goods. 
I love the coconut in these! They loves them and so do I!

I substituted half the oil with coconut oil and they were so greasy! I noticed many rated this a 4 or 5 yet modified the recipe to significantly reduce the oil.  I would rate this higher but only if the oil were reduced by at least half.

I usually don't make too many changes to a recipe, but I personalized these a lot to my family's preference (and the baby's need for some extra fiber) and they came out great! I owe it to a great base recipe. Definitely making it again. For the changes I did:
substitute 1/2 cup oil for applesauce-I also added 1/2 cup bran and soaked it in the applesauce before mixing in
decrease sugar to only 1 cup
I added 8 oz can finely chopped pineapple
I left out the raisins
instead of all white flour, put in half whole wheat
I switched the walnuts to a cashew, almond, macadamia nut mixture and chopped them in a food processor.

Making these again soon!

Turned out great. I substituted some apple sauce for oil, added ground flax and cut the sugar back to 1 cup. They did take 35 mins to bake rather than 20.

I just made this recipe and was so happy with the results!!  I used about 3/4 of a cup of oil and they still came out moist, almost too moist...so I may either go down to 1/2 cup or possibly try coconut oil instead to make it healthier also!  Thank you so much for sharing!  These will become a favorite in our home!!

It's a brilliant base recipe. 
I took the review tip of substituting applesauce for oil- didn't have enough so I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup butter. I subbed half the flour for whole wheat and pretty much tripled the coconut to use up the rest of our frozen stuff. I also added some more raisins.
Next time my family wants me to make a triple recipe to freeze and use as post-workout food. I am happy to comply. I love the carrot texture and that they're not bready like regular muffins. After cutting the sugar in half, I think I'll mess around with what ingredients I use- maybe a apricot/walnut/flax or coconut/dried pineapple/banana. The options are limitless.

Replace apple with applesauce. If doing 12 muffins then increase baking time by at least 10 mins, if not more, also reduce temp (bottoms were over done but tops were great at 350).

I made these for my toddler trying to get her to at least eat some type of vegetable! She really liked the raisins and would eat the muffins most of the time she was offered them. They were however, a big hit with my hubby even though he didn't like the sound of them. He said they taste like carrot cake. I made them exactly as the recipe states except I used sweetened coconut. They turned out very moist and I will definitely make them again.

Only changes i made was used 1 c of applesauce instead of oil and 3/4 c of brown sugar instead of 1 1/4 c white, left out the raisins and nuts. Took it out of the oven after 23 mins but the inside was still undercooked, ended up baking it for another 10 minutes. Good healthy muffin if you're watching your calories and still want to indulge.

Totally loved them. Even though I don't like breads that involve carrots I did enjoy this ones. I had to make them a wee different since had to accommodate family needs. First made them gluten free and egg free ( used ground flax instead of eggs). Then I didn't have raisins so used mix dried fruit I had in hand and  finally used apple sauce and came out wonderful! Thanks for this recipe  o

I made the healthier option with whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of the oil.  Next time I make them I will make them with brown sugar instead of regular sugar.  I think I will also add more nuts like pecans and add dried cranberries and other dried fruits.  So yummy!  These went over very well with my 12 year old who hates everything.

These are delicious and I will definitely make them again. I reduced the oil by about 1/8 cup and they were still very moist. The next time I bake these I will likely use even less oil and replace with apple sauce. I was squeezing an orange for another recipe so I also added some zest too.

These are really good and I will definitely make them again.  They are moist and filling.   My family also liked them.

I made some of the subs that others listed.  1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, sweetened coconut (didn't have unsweetened), cut sugar to 1 cup (probably use 3/4 next time) and used pecans (allergic to walnuts).  I also used 2 medium sized apples instead of one.  Baking time for my oven was 23 mins.

I highly recommend.

I messed up on this recipe and it still turned out perfect.  I was baking along while multi-tasking. Towards the end I thought I was doubling recipe so I doubled coconut and nuts and the muffins stilled turned out fantastic. Absolutely perfect!!!!

These were delicious! Like many others I tweaked the recipe a bit: 1 cup of apple sauce instead of oil, with a couple tablespoons of oil added; used 1/2cup brown sugar and it was sweet enough, topped the muffins with oats, and added some vanilla protein powder for kicks. They turned out great!

Fabulous base recipe with lots of options for personalizing.    For instance, I used 1/3 cup coconut oil and 2/3 cup apple sauce in place of the oil and white whole wheat flour in place of white flour.  The only other thing I changed was to substitute some brown sugar for some of the white sugar.  I am sure the recipe is delicious as is, but easy to substitute for your tastes or to make it healthier.

I made some small changes: I added raw sugar, used half all purpose flour and half wheat flour; used strawberry - apple sauce from my son's toddler pouches. I didn't put the topping and used the apple with the peel for more fiber and they are absolutely delicious. Will definitely be baking often.

I did not add raisins for personal taste and used pecans instead of walnuts.

I used a dark muffin tin, so I lowered the temp by 25 degrees.  The muffins were a bit undercooked, so next time, and there will be a next time, I'll bake them 25 minutes.  They are absolutely delicious. Thanks for this recipe. Yummy!

Super Yum!
My mods:
Left out the walnuts, apples and raisins because I didn't have them on hand. Subbed 1 cup apple sauce for 1 cup oil.  Cut the sugar down to 1 cup and they were still perfectly sweet. These were fabulous. My son put cream cheese frosting on the "cupcakes" and they made for a tremendous dessert.

Great basic recipe came out moist and yummy! Will try with other veggies and fruits.  Alterations: Used Applesauce instead of oil 1:1.  Whole wheat flour  for all-purpose flour 1:1. Substituted 1 banana for coconut flakes. Pecans for walnuts 1:1.

Want to try with zucchini instead of carrots and sweet potatoes instead of apples.

I have made  variations of this recipe 3 times, twice in an oversized toaster oven and it's still one of my favourite muffins for snacking  as well as my family's!  I've turned it gluten free do to allergies (and luckily this one was already milk free). 

 To turn celiac friendly I substituted: 
 1+ 3/4 Robin hood's gluten free flour 
 (Or I used about 1 + 3/4 cup of my standby gf flour mix  :  2 cups brown rice flour , 1/2 cup tapioca starch, 1 cup potato starch) 
1/8 cup flax meal and 1/8 cup oat bran, 
3/4 tsp. xanthum gum and 1 tsp. baking powder . 

I also added a dash of cloves and 1 tsp nutmeg, and a mix of dates and a bit of currents instead of raisins.  I ran out of carrots one day so used 1 + 1/3 cup carrots and 1 cup grated zucchini (yes zucchini take over from the garden)  and they still turned out fantastically !
 Also sprinkled oats on top for aesthetics and a touch of extra  flavour.  

My dad came back from work mentioning he had picked up a morning glory muffin with his tea from his favourite tea and muffin stop on campus when he was on break and said mine beat theirs despite the gf/Df factor! 

I did find the recipe took about 30 minutes instead of 20 so check on the muffins as they bake. And did make an extra couple of muffins . 

thank you you for sharing this recipe.

I used coconut oil melted in the microwave in place of regular oil, gives them a nice taste and soooo moist. Everyone loves these muffins including my picky toddlers!

I made the recipe as specified, with the exception of using 1 c unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.  I used 1/2 cup of batter for each muffin.  For those of you who are watching your weight, when made this way, the muffins are 7 WeightWatcher points each.

Took Ashleybegood's advice and reduced oil to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 apple sauce, except it was a little sweetened.  Took another cook's advice and reduced sugar to 3/4 cups.  Omitted the nuts cuz I didn't have them, and added about 1/2 cup of fresh pineapple.   I absolutely love them, tho next time I will make it 1/2 oil 1/2 apple sauce, also i will up the sugar to 1 cup and top with oats.

I tried this recipe for my 14 mth old, and she loved it! I cooked the shredded carrots and chopped up the apples, nuts, coconut, and raisins to prevent any choking. I also used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce to reduce the fat. They came out moist and delicious. I will be making these again!!!

I have used this recipe over a dozen times. Every time I did something new. I have used half all purpose flour half tapioca flour. I have used whole wheat flour. I have used half all purpose flour and half almond flour (almond flour did not absorb the liquid, left with soggish muffins, still tasty though). I have used applesauce in the place of the oil, I have cut the sugar in half and I have used half brown sugar and omitted white sugar completely. I have  interchanged the fruits and vegetables with blackberries, peaches, zucchini, strawberries, and whatever I have on hand.  So far, this recipe has held up to everything I have thrown at it (in it).  Make this recipe and be creative. My only critique of this recipe is that the bake time has always exceeded 20 minutes, even in my convection oven.

Been making these (thanks to this recipe) for years. Love it. Only tip I have, be sure to grate your own carrots or they will be DRY!  I find when I either grate/pulse in a food processor the carrots 2 cups is a little much for the carrots too. I think 2 cups for the dry/stiff pre-shredded might be ok (if you figured a way to moisten them up a bit) but for hand grated ones it seems to "pack" in too much. Just my opinion. Recipe is forgiving. I've changed it up just out of necessity and will usually cut the sugar (for kids' sake). Thank you for years of yummy muffins!

My new favorite muffin recipe!  I followed some of the suggestions to make it a bit healthier...subbed wheat flour for 1/2 of it, used less sugar and less oil.  This is a keeper!

I made these this morning .. GLORY ! 
 They are very yummy. It took 25 min and made 21 muffins. I added 2 Table spoons of Flax (milled) seed for an extra boost.
 I will add Unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil next time.

Outstanding breakfast muffin! Options - change walnuts to chopped pecans.....the walnuts can overwhelm the other tastes. Also chose sweetened coconut and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. Fantastic grab and go muffin in the morning. Thank you Debbie Clark and my Aunt Pat!

I read all the suggestions and opted to try a few. I used 100% whole wheat flour. Used raw sugar and cut it down to 1/2 cup and used 1/4 cup silan. 3 Carrots, a banana, 1/2 cup oil, half cup yogurt, sun flower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds - a hand full of each.  Its really such a versile recipe that the base allows for a lot of creativity. They rose nicely with no heaviness. Great with peanut butter ( though that may be a preggo thing).

I've made these delicious recipe three times in the last week, and got rave reviews from family and friends.  I followed the recipe exactly for two batches.  For the third batch I substituted half the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and replaced 1/2 cup of flour with wheat germ.  Flavour and texture was still great.

This is a fantastic, easy and delicious muffin. I actually make these as a kids breakfast option now due to fussy tastes. This way I know my child is eating something before she goes to school. She quite enjoys having the muffin slightly warmed with her banana on the side. Goodness I couldn't believe just easy this was. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This recipe is fantastic.  I used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, used craisins for the raisins, omitted the apple and added 1 small can of crushed pineapple, drained.  For those worried about the fat - just make sure it is the *right* kind of fat - I used 1/2 cup light olive oil and a little coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Double the recipe and freeze some!

Delicious.  I didn't have an apple so I added one mashed banana instead.  I also subbed 1 cup whole wheat flour for a cup of the white and 1/2 c apple sauce for half of the oil.  Finally I topped mine with oats.  This made 16 large muffins and I needed to cook them for 24 minutes.

Easily substituted a few ingredients to make this slightly healthier. 1 cup wheat flour, 1/2c ground hazelnut, and 1/2c oats for the flour base. 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c honey for the sweetness. Didn't have walnuts so almonds were used and i cut the eggs down to two, though I think four egg whites would have also done the trick. I wanted to add soy protein powder but I forgot.  They came out so yummy, better if they're cold. Very surprised and delighted by this treat. Will make them again!!

Delicious! Cut sugar by 1/2 cup, will probably cut more out next time. Left out the coconut (none in the house). Muffins taste amazing and make the kitchen smell SO good! Next time I will probably buy shredded carrots and sub in some applesauce for some of the oil.

Made them again and changed even more! Subbed out half of the oil for pureed pumpkin, and used up a couple of overripe pears instead of an apple. Delicious!

Love this recipe, easy, and forgiving.  I like to juice veggies and fruits, a nice way to utilize EVERY bit of these things is incorporate the dry pulp from the juicer ( apples carrots ginger and pretty much anything else) in this recipe.  It eliminates all the shredding and is perfect for this type of thing.    I sprinkle a bit of coconut on the top of each muffin , it finishes each muffin beautifully.

This is a very heavy dense muffin. Very little batter but a ton of good stuff, carrots,nuts,raisins ,apples. If you like a nice light muffin that rises well this is not it. But it has great flavour, and is very filling because it is packed full of fruit etc. I double the recipe, didn't use coconut, only used 1/2 c of brown sugar ( no other sugar and it was sweet enough). In place of the oil I used 1 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 c of coconut oil.

I tried it first with gluten free flour for a family member and they were delicious. The second time I used wheat flour, substituted the oil for a cup of applesauce and mashed banana. I also only put 3/4 cup of the sugar.

Used applesauce as others suggested.  Wish I'd decreased the sugar since all I had was sweetened coconut. Otherwise just mixed it up with dried fruit leftover from Christmas.  Very satisfying.  Made a double batch to freeze.

This recipe is great! I didn't feel like going thru the trouble and mess of muffins, so I did a loaf instead. It took about 45 minutes to bake, but it was worth every minute. I did adlib a bit on ingredients also. I had apples and pears from my tree so I used a couple of apples, a large pear, carrots, and bananas. The rest of the ingredients was the same. Dynamite cake/bread! My husband & I had a slice that evening, then he had some the next morning and claimed dibs on the rest. I really liked it and only got one slice, so I made another one today. Yes, definitely worth every star and is a keeper. Thanks, Debbie!
Oh, yeah! I did cut the oil down to 1/2 because there was so many moist ingredients.

It takes longer to make than claims due to all the shredding. Needs a little more sugar. I don't substitute anything anymore because I prefer full flavor. I made this back in the day subbing the oil and it's just not as good. Try Coconut oil if you'd like but applesauce doesn't do it for me. It also cooked closer to 35 minutes.

This recipe 'as is' is not very good. WAY too much oil and sugar. I cut the sugar a little and it was still plenty sweet enough. There is so much oil in these muffins that they felt greasy. Next time, I will replace most of the oil with applesauce and sub egg whites instead of whole eggs. I'll probably cut the sugar in half also. They also took longer to bake than the recipe said, by about 10 minutes.

Replaced eggs and oil with 1 cup blended apples & 1/4 cup almond milk & 2 tsp of yogurt. Used whole wheat flour, and only one cup of sugar. Used less carrots as well and more diced apple. Also usually put hazelnuts in but forgot. So good! Good recipe :)

Delicious!  I did use half AP flour and half whole wheat flour, added some ground flax. I also used only brown sugar, reduced oil to 1/2 cup and replaced with apple sauce and about 1/4 cup plain yogurt.  Lastly, I reduced walnuts by half and replaced with pepitas (small pumpkin seeds).  Baked for 25 minutes at 350. Will definitely make again!

Good recipe; was a hit with my family.  Not too sweet and the add-ins are easily customizable.  I made this as is, but I'm looking forward to trying it with the applesauce substitute next time.

I made these just as the recipe is written and they are delicious.  I wasn't feeling too good about the white flour and the cup of oil, however, so next time I made them with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white and substituted apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil. Still delicious and now just a little bit healthier!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as printed and wasn't too impressed the first day - but after the muffins sat overnight in a sealed container it was a different story. These are super moist and the sweetness came out after they had a chance to 'rest'. The cooking time is incorrect tho - I made medium-large muffins and left them in the oven for 25-27 minutes (at 20 minutes they were still gooey). I will definitely make these again but will reduce the oil.

These were good. I added 1/2 c hemp seeds, 1/4 c of ground flax seed, 1/4 c of chia seeds. Instead of shredded Apple, I used 1/2c apple sauce, 1tsp ginger, and omitted the raisins and walnuts for my 3 year old. The kids went crazy for these and barely lasted until supper that day!

This is the recipe I have been looking for!! After reading some of the many reviews, I made just a couple of changes.I used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar for the white, 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 white, 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also added 1/4 cup of molasses-a personal favorite. Oh, I left the skins on the apples too-why waste them?? My food processor made short work of the shredding. I doubled the batch the first time I made them and I am so glad that I did. These are already a favorite, and because of my insulin dependent diabetes, I could only eat one out of the oven!!!!

Very good.  Had some old baby carrots that I wanted to use up.  Just used the food processor to grate.  Measured the shredded carrots, then used the dirty processor to shred the apple.  Very quick, relatively easy clean up.  Needed more raisins -- will probably use a full cup next time.  Might try adding nutmeg or cardamom as well as substituting apple sauce for part of the oil.  Made 23 muffins.  Thanks!

Love this recipe. Grating the carrots is really time consuming but well worth it in the end. I try and sub out as much oil as I can with unsweetened apple sauce, but am never able to sub it out completely... just isn't as good.

Made these with some of the substitutions suggested, 1/2 whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup sugar and using half oil and half applesauce. I thought the whole wheat flour changed the flavor and probably won't do that again and maybe next time try using currants and toasted walnuts.  Overall they were liked, but I think the second batch will be better.

Good news, bad news. I added three slices of pineapple with a little juice, zucchini, and cucumber (cucumber was a mistake, I thought it was zucchini). I didn't measure in these extras so I think maybe I threw off the proportions. Also used 1/2 c applesauce, and maybe too big an apple. Soaked the cranberries (instead of raisins) and coconut in boiling water. 
Bottom line: with all those wet extra ingredients, I realized my dough was way too watery. Just looked WRONG. So I added flour, added flour, close to 3/4 of a cup.
The texture and cooking time were fine with my adjustment. But the muffin lost a lot of flavor I would have expected it to have. I think just so much extra flour. Needed more sweetness and more punch. (more cinnamon? nutmeg?)
I'll have to make them again to see if I can get to five stars but I think it wasn't really the recipe's fault; still seemed good. Would also like to try lite sour cream/yogurt to see if I can get more moisture in that way.

Wonderful!  Other than using only 3/4 c. oil, I followed the recipe to a T.  I was test driving my new Chicago Metallic jumbo tins so based on other advise, I baked at 325 for 30 mins. and got 6 jumbo muffins and a small corning ware casserole filled.  These jumbo muffins will be very delicious, filling breakfasts.  Thanks for sharing.

I substituted in halves:  1/2 brown sugar for white, 1/2 applesauce subsitute for oil, and 1/2 wheat flour for regular.  Yummy!  They freeze and reheat in the microwave well too.  Next time I will try the all applesauce, brown sugar and flour subsitutes recommended by others.

This was really good!  I used applesauce for 3/4 of the oil suggested and also used about 1/4 of the suggested sugar.  They came out great!

Delicious! Didn't have vanilla so I know it would've been EXTRA delicious with it.  I also added roasted flax seed (not ground) and instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I substituted 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup plain non fat greek yogurt.  Used dried cranberries instead of raisins.   My kids LOVED them.  Will bake again and again and again!

I too, cut out half the oil and added applesauce and crushed pineapple. I used pecans instead of walnuts and  they were a hit!

After a few tweaks, I love this recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, substituted unsweetened applesauce for half the oil, and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour instead of the 2 cups white flour.

These are really  good and fill my sweet tooth with out wrecking me trying to eat healthier with the changes I made...Doubled the recipe -Used whole wheat flour, 3 apples, 4 carrots in food processor, 2 cups B.sugar, 1/2 cup flax seed meal, 1 c choc chips, 1 c raisins, 1 c sw. shred coconut, 2 cups pumpkin in place of oil, doubled recipe yielded 39 muffins. Really good with Nutella on them ;-)
2nd time made only had 5 eggs (for double batch) added a little extra pumpkin, added 1 1/3 cup choc chips, and a handful of fresh blueberries. Baked 25 min yielded 42 muffins. I use a standard ice cream scoop to scoop evenly

These were absolutely FANTASTIC! My picky hubby described them as "crack" and asked for more once they were gone. It was my super tasty on the go breakfast and mid morning snack for the week. The only thing I changed was I used coconut oil instead of veg oil, which I always do for health reasons. Plus it tastes a lot better too. Next time I will try it with whole wheat flour. With all this flavor, I doubt it will make much difference in taste.

These muffins were very good but there was too much baking soda in them.  I'm going to try them again with 1-1/2 tsp baking soda, less oil and some pineapple

These were perfect for a day when I had no bread for toast.  Everybody loved them, and no one knew that I forgot to buy bread.  They even nibbled some for a snack later in the day.

If you like carrot cake, you will love these muffins. Would be great to add a little cream cheese glaze (didn't think of that when I was shopping for ingredients!). Recipe actually made 18 good size muffins and took closer to 25 minutes to bake. Makes the kitchen smell divine!

Amazing recipe!  I did read many reviews and used applesauce instead of oil.  I also left out the coconut because my husband is allergic, but threw in crasins! I love that this recipe allows for some creativity.  They were amazing

These are so good and moist!  Tweaked it a bit replacing all of the oil with applesauce, all of the sugar with splenda, and used all white whole wheat flour.  Baked directly in greased muffin tins without paper liners, otherwise they would have stuck to the paper due to the lack of oil.  What makes these great is the formula and method.  Thank you Debbie!

Made these today! Very tasty! I subbed in some fresh pomegranate seeds as well as some flax seeds to make them a bit healthier...used half olive oil but next time will use apple sauce like others suggested! Also used craisins instead of raisins. They also took a bit longer than 20 mins for me... So yummy!

Very easy recipe to make. I switched craisins for raisins and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce to cut some calories. It made more than 12 muffins for me, and I think it needed to be cooked longer, mine took like 30+ minutes. might just be my oven though. Thanks for the recipe!

Best muffin flavor ever. This recipe made 22 medium-sized muffins. Next time I will reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup, using only 1 cup. I will also cut the  oil by about 1/4 - 1/2 cup, since this batch was quite oily. But the flavor was extraordinary.

Yummy and somewhat healthy - a great combo. I doubled the recipe and used just 1 cup of oil. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and lessened the sugar by about 3/4 cup. Everything else I did the same and they turned out great.

Loved loved loved these, exactly what I was looking for and they turned out so good!! I followed the recipe, only exception was that I topped the muffins with chopped walnuts because I had some left over. Will be doing it again for sure. Nothing beats home made muffins!

These are wonderful!  I made them with brown sugar and King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour.  I will try the applesauce trick next time, but with the whole wheat flour, it was only slightly oily.  I will also try cutting out the walnuts to save on calories and just sprinkling the tops with chopped walnuts and sugar in the raw before baking.

I cut the sugar to 1 cup, left out the coconut, and substituted applesauce for the oil and we still loved them.
Update-I used 1/2 cup Stevia, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup oat flour and 1/2 cup rice flour with great results. I get 20 muffins.

The recipe looked too healthy to be tasty, but I went with the reviews and they were right.  It's delicious.  Next time, however, I'll leave out the walnuts because it made the kids not like them.

These are delicous, filling and healthy muffins. The whole family loves them and can not keep their hands of of them. Instead of all of the oil we put half applesauce and half oil. We used some white sugar and some brown sugar.

Very good!  I substituted 1/2 Cup craisins for the walnuts and coconut.  These make a nice, quick breakfast.  Very tasty!

Yummy! I did make some changes to suit my families tastes though. I took out the raisins and coconut since nobody likes those, and also took out the walnuts because of allergies. I used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the full cup of oil.

Terrific - I substituted 3/4c oil for 3/4 c applesauce, and left the last 1/4c oil in.  They turned out beautifully.

Awesome!! They were a big hit with "the boys".  Next time I will try replacing some of the oil with applesauce to cut down the calorie content.

i used a cup of applesauce instead of the oil; 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of white flour; added cranberries and sunflower seeds; used a cup of brown sugar in place of the white sugar.... the muffins were delish! this was my first time experimenting with whole wheat flour, and i can't taste one bit of difference. they take a couple bites to get used to bc they aren't as sweet as most muffins, but the fruit provides tangy bursts and the carrots provide crunch. oh i also added rolled oats on top.. yum!

Wonderful.  We used all whole wheat flour, and as others suggested, cut down on the sugar and omitted the oil and used applesauce.  They were so wonderfully moist - made for a fabulous on-the-go breakfast!

These are delicious.  Shredding the carrots is the most time consuming part.  Otherwise, pretty straightforward.  I did as others suggested and used 1/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce.  I also used whole wheat flour.  I know I should try the recipe as originally written first, but I was afraid I might like the less healthy version better.  I figure if I try it the healthier way and like it, I'll never know what I'm missing!  I think you could easily cut the sugar back to 1 c. and never miss it.   Anyway, these are great!  Not low-cal, but full of good stuff!

Pretty tasty! I feel like it was missing a little something... a spice of some sort, but I'm a new cook and don't know what that "missing" thing is yet. Other than that, a tasty breakfast with a glass of milk!

These muffins are excellent!  I stuck pretty close to the recipe with  a couple of substitutions.  I used half whole grain and half white flour, half sugar and half splenda, and half oil and half applesauce to make them a bit healthier.  They came out great.

Awesome. Didn't have coconut so I used fresh chopped pinapple and I also used 1/2 cup apple sauce 1/2 cup oil to cut fat. My 2 year old son loves them! Big hit. Thanks.

Delicious!  I've made them a couple times now and this recipe is so easy to substitute ingredients.  I used brown sugar instead of white, also cut back on oil and used applesauce, added sunflower seeds, used one egg and 2 egg whites, added different spices (cloves, nutmeg and ginger with the cinnamon) and omitted walnuts (just because I am not a walnut fan)...they have been excellent both times and everyone loves them!  Thanks!

Wonderful tasting, healthy and filling muffin with lots of fiber.  A great start to your morning.  It is the type of recipe that you can add almost anything you want.  Made 12 jumbo sized muffins and was able to freeze about half.  Try to incorporate some ideas from the reviews listed.

These are great! I had to leave out the coconut and nuts for the kids, and finely chop the raisins. I also substituted 1/2 cup of flour with whole wheat and 1/2 the oil with fat-free plain yogurt. Like others, I just couldn't bring myself to use all the oil. These turned out fantastic and I was surprised they are not too sweet. I can't wait to sneak them into the kids' lunchbox.

Delicious! Restaurant quality - I am proud to serve these. I decreased the oil to 1/2 cup and added an extra shredded apple. I also added a few minutes to baking time - they weren't quite ready after 20 minutes. Will definitely make again!

Very good as is but I made substitutions to fit our family.  Subs. strawberry applesauce for oil, 1c brownsugar, 1/2c white sugar, 1c unbleached flour, 1c ground oats, lemon extract, apples, coconut, carrot, and vanilla extract, no nuts.  Great recipe that can be adjusted to what is in the pantry.

excellent recipe!   i made a couple changes to make it healthier (applesauce instead of vegetable oil, 1/2 kamut1/2 white flour instead of all white flour, brown sugar instead of white) but none of those really make taste differences - so i love this recipe!!

Yummers!  I diced the apple instead of shredding it for a chunkier affect. Perfect recipe for fall. Next time I will make into loaves to give as gifts. I had to bake about 5 extra minutes but they cam out perfect. Thanks!

Very healthy and delicious!  I didn't have any carrots on hand but had some shredded zucchini in the freezer, so I used that, and I didn't have any coconut so I used an extra apple.  This made more the batter wetter than it likely would have otherwise been, so I used 1/2 c. unsweetened apple sauce in place of the 1 c. oil.  So, other than the egg yolks, I had some fat free muffins!  I also replaced 1/2 the flour with whole wheat, which gave them a nice flavor.  They were a big hit!

These are great!  As other reviewers have done, I substituted whole wheat flour for white flour and applesauce for oil.  I used two Granny Smith apples (since they are small), used my mini food processor for dicing up the peeled/sliced/cored apples and carrots (saved a LOT of time over chopping, like I did the first time I made these), and ended up with 18 muffins.  I freeze half of them and eat about two every morning for breakfast until I run out, then I unfreeze them and go through the rest.  I was leery of the whole wheat flour but you really can't taste it -- they turn out great and I will always make them this way!  Oh, and I also didn't have any walnuts (or nuts of any kind) so I left them out.

These muffins were absolutely perfect.  I replaced one cup of oil with 1/4 cup of oil and 3/4 of apple sauce.  The apple was fairly small so I used 1 and 1/2 apples.  It turned out to be a bit more than 12 muffins.

These remind me of the morning glory muffins I used to get at a local restaurant that is no longer open.  They are moist and calorie-free.  Well, almost calorie-free.  :-)

These are great muffins.  I used cinnamon apple sauce instead of oil and even my kids liked them.

Excellent base recipe.  I ended up making a few changes like others.  Instead 1c veg oil, I used 3/4c unsweetened applesauce and 1/4c veg oil. I used half white flour and half wheat flour and 3tsp of cinnamon. I didn't have an apple or coconut so left them out.  Next time I want to try with an apple and coconut and will double the recipe and try freezing some for later.  My 3&5 yr olds each ate 2 after lunch.  They said they were the best ever!!!

These tasted really good, but they didn't rise up for me.  The just stayed flat.  They were really moist and delicious, so I will certainly make them again.

Great Recipe!!!! Second time I have made them in a week! I used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 veg oil. Also, I added 1 shredded zucchini to the mix, and place raw pumpkin seeds on the tops for a bit of crunch!!!

I make these about once a month. I often host a morning meeting with some of my friends every Wednesday morning. I generally try to bake something new each time. These  muffins have been by far the best recipe I have tried and the ladies request them every week! I always make these with half whole wheat flour and half white. I also omit the nuts (I'm not a huge nut fan!) I also make the batter the night before and then throw them in the oven the next morning. You definitely have to try these!

We love these muffins!  I usually throw whatever extra fruits I have on hand in the blender -- bananas, a couple of apples, carrots, zucchini, etc., and puree till smooth, since we aren't big on "shreds" of stuff in our muffins.  I up the spices and dry ingredients till my batter is "muffin-y texture."  I sub some whole wheat flour, and do about 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil to cut down on the fat, but still keep them moist and tasty!  This makes TONS of muffins for me -- I put some in the freezer and the rest in the fridge for hubby to grab for a quick breakfast on his way to work.  Thanks a bunch!  These are versatile and easy to make to taste!

Great recipe to follow exactly or make you own!  I omitted the oil and replaced with applesauce, and used whole wheat flour.  I also added 1C zucinni and 1C carrots instead of 2C carrots.  Great way to get more veggies in my toddler--she LOVES them1

these were tasty and easy except for the grating part. they were a bit oily. i should have taken other reviewers advice and used applesauce in place of the oil. i would also use a tad bit less carrot.

I also used whole wheat flower and cranberries instead of walnuts. I wish I had of had apple sauce because they would be better without so much oil. However, very yummy!!! Will definitly make again!

These were great muffins.   The things I did differently were using 1/2 cup oil and added 1 jar of apple blueberry (baby food.  I did not have flaked coconuts available so I added chopped dried mangoes.  Also  added 2 tablespoons of plain yoghurt.  So moist and very yummy.  Made 12 muffins and small 1 pan.

These were great!  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour, used 1/2 cup light tasting olive oil instead of vegetable oil, 1/2 cup strawberry flavored applesauce(that's all I had), and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  A very forgiving recipe!

These are wonderful! I made some modifications based on others' recommendations. I ommitted the oil and just used milk and applesauce. I added pumpkin and ground flax seed. They stay moist and are delicious! Thank you for this recipe!!

These are quite good!  I used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I substituted applesauce for the oil (to make it healthier).  I omitted the walnuts (personal preference) and reduced the coconut.  Even with all my changes, these still turned out great- and healthier than the original!  I got 16 muffins out of this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty breakfast muffin. I subbed 1/2 c of the oil for applesauce, used half the coconut and added an extra apple to try to make it a bit healthier. What a healthy way to get more veggies in my kids.

Very good, BUT...1) It's too oily. Next time I'll use 1/2c. oil plus 1/2c. applesauce. 2) It needs more salt. Next time I'll add a shy teaspoon of salt. (Note: I used egg replacer--bought at a health food store.)

I made these and changed a few ingredients to make them healthier.  I replaced all the oil with unsweetened applesauce, all the flour with wholewheat flour, used 6 egg whites instead of 3 eggs and omitted the nuts.  Lots of fat in the nuts, and I don't like them in muffins anyway.  The only fat remaining in the muffins is in the coconut.  Next time I may try to either cut down on the sugar or replace with Splenda.  My kids ate some, but didn't love them, but I think they're a great tasting diet muffin. I used a small muffin top pan.

Really good, even considering I "healthed them up" a bit with less sugar, a bit of honey, and a white/wheat/soy flour mixture. A dusting of powdered sugar on top is good after they've cooled a bit, too.

Pretty good muffins.  I mostly stuck to the recipe with a few changes.  I don't like raisins so I used dried cranberries but next time I think I'll just leave those out.  I used whole wheat flour, 1 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar, and used 1/4 oil and 3/4 cup applesauce as other reviewers suggested to make it more healthy.  The result was a very moist, almost carrot cake-like muffin that had just the right amount of sweetness.

A note about "shredding" apples...I had never done that before and didn't know what to expect, so I just used my cheese shredder (which I already had out for the carrots).  Well, my granny smith cooking apple didn't exactly turn into nice stringy pieces, it ended up looking more like applesauce.  Actually, it went brown immediately too, so to be honest it looked like throw-up.  Yum!  :)  So I had another apple on hand which I peeled and cubed.  (I liked cubed apples in my baking anyway.)  They came out really good.  Also, I substituted applesauce (including the goop I had made, lol) for oil since it's a shame to have all these healthy ingredients and then blow it with the oil.  Other than that though, the recipe does not need any tinkering.  AND it's AMAZING served with a little bit of low-fat cream cheese.  I'm not kidding guys, you'll really want the cream cheese.

Used pecans instead of walnuts.  excellent!!  Used large paper cups and I got 16 muffins.   Double batch just fits in my Artisan mixer.  Teenagers loved them.

First round of muffins were gone in less time it takes for my family to eat a batch of cookies! Round 2 I cut the oil in 1/2 & added crushed pineapple with the juice. They took almost 30 minutes to bake.

I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, omitted: salt, raisins, walnuts, and coconuts, and substituted dried mixed berries, 2 eggs instead of 3, substituted the vegetable oil with ¾ cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1 tablespoon of canola oil.  The flavor was wonderful and the ingredients are healthy.  It makes for a great breakfast or dessert after dinner.

I love recipes like this because they are so fool proof. I am not much of a baker and often ruin things by experimenting with the recipe. I did the same with this recipe and was so sure I had ruined it, but they came out perfect!! Moist, firm, perfect texture. I only made modifications for health purposes. The changes I made were: 1) less carrots -- only about 1 1/4 cup, and an extra apple, 2) brown sugar instead of white, 3) I replaced the coconut and nuts with a cup of oat bran, and 4) used part oil, part yogurt. The batter was really thin, even though I didn't really change the quantities of dry/liquid ingredients -- is it supposed to be this way? They still came out perfect though. Great recipe. These muffins taste even better the next day when the flavors have settled in! Amazing!!

I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup home canned applesauce and only 1 cup sugar. I skipped the coconut as I was out. Got 24 standard muffins. I do have a giant muffin tin but was out of large papers. Also, sprayed the inside of the papers for easy removal of the muffins. They were fantastic. A great Weight-watchers treat at 1 point each for the smaller muffins. Next time I will use whole wheat flour for a more healthy muffin. I suggest that you mix the dry ingredients carrots and raisins well before you add the egg mixture.

This was sooooooo yummy. Used whole wheat flour and added flax seed.  Also used applesauce instead of oil.  Got rave reviews, my 3 year old twins and 6 year old gobbled them down not knowing they were sooooo healthy.  Thanks!

I made these yesterday. I was looking for creative ways to slip more vegetables into the family's diet.  They are really good. Even the picky teenagers loved them.  I substituted 1/2 of the oil with applesauce, added some vanilla. I think next time I'll replace half of the flour with whole wheat.

Made these this afternoon and wow!  They really do taste like carrot cake.  Using the other reviews and a bit of my own creativity...  Used 1 1/2 c whole wheat and 1/2 c unbleached for flour, used brown sugar and cut it back to 3/4 c, only used 1 c of carrots (because I ran out), pecans instead of walnuts, 1/2 oats instead of coconut (again, all out), 1/4 c melted butter and 3/4 c applesauce for oil.  Left everything else as is.  We love 'em!  Baked up light and beautiful.  Made 36 very full mini muffins.  We are all out of cream cheese or we would have made some icing to perfect them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent. I did 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup unsweetned applesauce as suggested. Also, added nutmeg and clove. I was very generous with the raisons and held back a bit with the coconut. Also used all whole wheat flour and 1 cup of brown sugar. Very moist. And yummy. A keeper

These muffins are great.  I've been making them every weekend since I found the recipe.  The only thing I change is I use slightly less oil than called for and I substitute sunflower seeds for the nuts.(my daughter goes to a nut-free school)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Really delicious! These are a great way to start the day. As others had suggested, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, but I still found these muffins a little too sweet, perhaps 3/4 cup would have been fine. I only had 1 1/2 cups of grated carrots, and I added sunflower seeds since I didn't have any nuts, and threw in a 1/4 cup of pineapple. I think that next time I will follow the advice and put half oil and half apple sauce, since the muffins glisten with oil. However, absolutely delicious! I was able to make 18 regular size muffins.

Very good!  I made some modifications to make them more healthy:

Used 50/50 white/wheat baking flour, omitted coconut, added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate morsels, cut oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of pureed butternut squash. Next time, will also add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pineapple.

Wow!  Thse muffins are INCREDIBLE.  Thanks so much for the tip on "flax eggs" I tried it out as I was running low on eggs and they came out wonderfully.

I used whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar slightly, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  

Absolutely delicious, will be making these again for sure.

I thought these muffins were good. I altered the recipe due to lack of two ingredients. I Substituted white flour for wheat and used shredded zucchini instead of carrots. My husband and daughter weren't crazy about them probably because they weren't overly sweet (Hubby scored them a "3") but I thought they were good.

I love these muffins!  They're easy to make, and delicious.  They greatly resemble the muffins I used to have at local hangout in Edmonds, Washington--Brusseau's.  Anyway, try 'em--they're really terrific.

These were great.  I did use only 1 cup of white sugar and used 1/4 cup of brown and I didn't have any coconut so I threw in another Granny Smith apple.  When I was filling the muffin cups to the brim I was worried about overflow but that didn't happen.  It also made 15 muffins.  I baked for 22 minutes and they were perfect.

These are my favorite muffins ever!  I did make some changes.  Instead of rasins I used pineapple tidbits and I used half a cup of oil and half a cup of apple sauce. Even with the changes they were still very moist and yummy.

These muffins are just not my taste. They are nice and moist but bland for me. I took them to work and coworkers either loved them or did not care about them at all. I did not care about them at all. I love carrot cake but I did not like the carrots and coconut in these muffins. I would use more spices too. Sorry, but wont make again.

These are moist and delicious -- a perfect muffin recipe.  I always keep shredded carrots in my freezer so this makes it much easier.

I don't know about "easy" with all the chopping, peeling and all...but these muffins were fantastic.  Very moist and flavorful.  I did not have unsweetened coconut so I used sweetened and it turned out fine. I will absolutely be making these again, most likely for overnight guests and will also serve with cream cheese frosting.  Mmmmmmm!!

Yummy Muffins! I used wholemeal flour, brown sugar, dried dates and dried cranberries. no oil - organix fruit purees instead.
easy to make! and more tempting then porridge for little Aidan.

These were really easy and delicious.  I left out the nuts due to an allergy, and used half oil and half unsweetened applesauce and they turned out very moist. I also made them into mini muffins, in the hopes the kids could have some for school, but they went too quickly to save any!

I used King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour, dried cranberries instead of raisins, and cut back on the sugar because I only had sweetened coconut. These were not the best morning glory muffins I have ever made, but they were close, and a heck of a lot easier.  Great recipe, freezes well!

Excellent.  I added an extra apple, for the flour I did 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 regular, for the sugar I did 1/2 natural brown sugar, 1/2 dark brown sugar.  I skipped the raisins and added sliced almonds instead of walnuts.

These were very good. Reminded me of a recipe I had using raisin bran, carrots and apples. I used half applesauce and half oil (think next time I will use applesauce only) and 3/4c sugar which I may reduce to 1/2c was plenty sweet with all the sweetness of the apples, raisins, and carrots. Thanks for a great muffin I don't have to feel guilty feeding my kids. (Hope they don't see the butter I slather on mine...MMMmmm!)

I used one cup of applesauce instead of oil (because I ran out of oil and it was Christmas Eve!) and did not add nuts.  I agree they are a lot like carrot cake, which is a good thing.  They were very moist and I served them with the Philadelphia brand brown sugar swirled cream cheese - yum, yum.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My teenaged children are picky about healthy food, but they loved these with the crunchy bits of carrots and apple. We left out the nuts because of allergies and used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil. We make these nearly every Sunday and they beg for more!

I made these muffins with some changes.  One-half recipe made 10 regular sized muffins (did not fill up the muffin cups).  I used paper liners, 1/2 oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce, splenda instead of sugar (reduced to 1/2 c for half recipe), 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 whole wheat, 1 1/4 c carrot, 1 c of apple, left the skin on the apple and baked for 20 minutes.  I omitted the nuts and coconut and used 2 eggs for half recipe.  The muffins stuck to the liners, maybe because I left them in the pan to cool and the-next time I'll put them on a cooling rack immediately.  I also used my manual food chopper for the carrots and apple instead of grating-it's much faster.  I'll be making these again.

This recipie is a winner, and these muffins are great anytime, not just for breakfast. At first, it's a bit difficult mixing the ingredients b/c the wet stuff doesn't come in until the very end, but it eventually all comes together. The wonderful mix of all the flavors make it scrumptious!

These muffins were amazing - very moist and a nice texture!  I did make a few changes though - I omitted the nuts, and added dried cranberries instead.  I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Will definitely make again!

I sent these muffins to the office with my husband and they disappeared.  I did add a few more walnuts than called for.  He even ate two and he usually won't eat sweets. If you like carrot cake you will love these.

I didn't add the coconut because no one in our family likes it or the nuts because I wanted to send them in my daughter's lunch and her school is nut-free so I substituted dried cranberries and they still came out quite well.  I also halved the oil and used applesauce in the oil's place, as well as made them out of whole wheat flour.  All in all, they were very good muffins.

These muffins are delicious! They take a little extra work, but they are definitely worth the work.  I didn't have any coconut and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  A nice healthy treat !!  Thanks for sharing Debbie !

Absolutely wonderful...thanks so much for sharing the recipe. They were so moist and tasted terrific..Next time I will try to reduce the oil to 1/2 c. and add 1/2c.  applesauce. They have become an instant family favorite.
