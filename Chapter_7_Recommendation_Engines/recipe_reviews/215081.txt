Good recipe-I used real crabmeat, which was pricey, but I'm not a fan of the imitation stuff.  I also used frozen peas, which worked fine.  Makes quite a bit, so this is good for a crowd.

Amazing! It's a favorite all around, I make it for my family and friends. Super easy. I add mushrooms rather than the zucchini.

All I can say is OMG.....this is awesome.  Even my 8 yr old liked it.  The only thing I did diff was sub green beans for the peas.  It's definitely a KEEPER!!!!

I had a really busy day so I needed something quick and easy. This was the perfect recipe! I used half a bag of frozen corn/peas/green beans instead of just peas.  Next time I will use less noodles and more veggies. It was delicious though!

This was sooooo good.  I left out the milk by mistake, but it turned out perfect!  I think it would have been too runny if I would have used it.  I used 95% fat free cream of celery soup and 1/2 pkg of frozen peas.   This may be the best thing I have ever cooked!

This was sooo awesome! I've made it several times now, and I love it! I added cayenne and lots of crushed red pepper, as I like it spicy! Highly recommend!

Nobody has mentioned that this is a very pretty dish.  Pink of the crab with the green of the zucchini and peas....very nice.  Mine looked much more appetizing than the picture.  I did make it in a 9 x 17 glass casserole (more closely as specified in the recipe rather than the small round dish in the picture.)  I also believe that to review a recipe you should actually adhear to the recipe.  The only differences I made were, I only had lactaid on hand....perhaps this accounted for some of the lack of richness in the final product.  Also, I used frozen peas.    So, it was nice, and gorgeous, and had great texture, but still a tad bland.  So, next time think rather than the two cans of soup will probably make my own cream sauce....add paprika and some other spices.  So, before you think I'm being negative....I think it really good, as is......I'm just not big on using canned soups/prepared products, etc.    Think with a few homemade touches could be a real signature dish.    Thank you for the recipe.

GREAT recipe. I hate imitation crab though, so i used smoked salmon and crab, and it gave it A LOT of favor, and wasn't much more price wise though. Maybe 8-10 dollars more tops. Not a huge fan of zucchini myself, i am actually thinking of putting in corn and carrots for taste and color as well as texture. I love this recipe because you can play with the ingredients so much!

Overall good flavor.  I wasn't a big fan of the zucchini and imitation crab flavors together.  I added carrots instead of celery for a little extra color, otherwise followed the recipe.  I was worried the zucchini would be mushy, but maybe I should have cooked them longer and it could have been better.

I would give this 5 stars for the idea of a crab casserole (I really like crab), and for the flavor of the sauce.  However, I did not like the celery at all in this recipe and was not a huge fan of zucchini with this either.  I will make this again, but will use other vegetables, probably a corn/peas/carrots mix.  Also the little potato pieces from the soup were good in here, so adding some potato may work well too.  I used real crab and would definitely do that again.

This recipe tastes good. Not bad, and a excellent way to incorporate the imitation crabmeat.  I tried some substitutions and they worked great:  medium/large shell pasta (replacing egg noodle) and broccoli and green beans (replacing zucchini). The broccoli goes very well with this casserole.

It needed something.   I used mushrooms instead of zucchini, next time I will add minced garlic when cooking the celery and onion (garlic and seafood just seem to go hand in hand).   I will also add crushed red pepper flakes like a previous poster.   Also, I don't think the potato soup added anything and you can't get it in low sodium, low fat, so I'll use 2 cans of cream of celery soup.   And didn't add the milk, I find when cooking with canned soup, it thins out and the milk would have added too much liquid.  Like others, I used real crab.

This was absolutely delicious! The flavors were excellent!  I had crab legs for dinner a couple nights ago and had plenty leftover so I used fresh crabmeat. I bought frozen peas and then forgot them in the freezer so didn't get to eat the casserole wish peas. I used Pronto barrilla penne pasta (no need to cook beforehand) and I added old bay seasoning in the top. Hubby loved this dish and so did I!
