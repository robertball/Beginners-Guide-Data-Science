Excellent sauce. I did do a couple changes. I used honey instead of molasses, reduced the oil by half, and I cooked it down for several minutes so it thickened and the sugar dissolved. It was amazing on oven roasted chicken drumsticks.

Very Tasty! Just the right amount of sweet & spice. I cut The recipe in half, & added 1 TBLS each of instant chopped onion, and bottled minced garlic. I also simmered it on the stove for 10-15 min. to combine flavors, & to thicken it, as mentioned by a previous reviewer.

I omitted the white sugar, but it was still very sweet for my taste.  Next time, I will halve the molasses.  It is a keeper, though!  Great for dipping ribs.

I didn't have taco sauce so I just used tomato sauce.  I also substituted honey for molasses and left the mustard out and it still came out great!

this sauce was perfect for my chicken wings. I made it because I wanted something different from the normal hot sauce I usually make. My two sons devoured these up and asked me to make it again for the next weekend!

It's a good recipe.  I didn't have taco sauce so I used ketchup.  Because ketchup is already sweet I skipped the white sugar and only added half the molasses.  Even that was a little too much and I ended up adding a little more vinegar to balance it back out again.  The only other change I made was to add a couple of drops of liquid smoke to it.  Really good as is though!

Fabulous.  Since I am diabetic, I am always looking for recipes for good barbecue sauce.  I replaced the sugar with Agave and added some garlic and onions.  We put it over a leftover roast and it was again fabulous.  A keeper in my file.

Good but with these changes. I made my own taco sauce from another website's recipe (no taco sauce on hand usually), eliminated the vegetable oil and used worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. (Completely out of soy sauce at the moment.) I'm really glad I tasted the sauce before adding the extra sugar called for. This is pretty sweet on it's own with just the ketchup in the taco sauce and molasses, so I didn't need to add the additional sugar. This is more like a sweet and spicy "mexican" barbeque sauce. Good recipe, but not really what I was looking for in a sauce. Little too sweet for me. NOTE: I also sauteed a little minced onion and garlic in butter before adding the ingredients. I did simmer this for a bit to reduce the sauce a bit to make it thicker.

I substituted dijon mustard for the dried and added an extra dash of our favorite hot sauce. Really good.

Love it! Didn't have molasses, used brown sugar and honey as the sweeteners, omitted the oregano. Taco sauce makes an excellent base for barbeque sauce, who would have thought? I will use this recipe alot. Thanks for sharing. P.S. After using this sauce determined it was a little thin. Have to work on that.

Very good!  Marinated pork chops for 7 hours.  Turned out great.  A nice balance of sweet and spicy, without being too strong.

AWWWWW-SOME! Some of the best barbeque sauce I've ever had. I did add some cayenne pepper b/c I had dry mustard, not hot dry mustard. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. SO YUMMY!

I used regular tomato sauce with taco seasoning. Honey instead of molasses a bit of cayenne pepper and garlic powder. So yummy!

I used this recipe to make pulled pork sandwiches for dinner, it turned out fantastic! The only change I made was using honey instead of molasses and that's only because I didn't have molasses on hand. Once the roast was done I took it out of the crock pot and shredded it. While I was doing this I added some corn starch to thicken up the sauce. It was a big hit with our whole family. I'll definitely make it again!

What I really like about this recipe is that you can substitute mostly anything from sauces you have in your fridge.  I was out of soy sauce, but I did have Gyoza sauce which includes soy sauce and used that. Came out great. Also, as many have done, I boiled it for about 15 minutes to thicken it.

Wow....This is delicious!  I didn't have dry hot mustard but did have prepared sweet hot mustard and also some prepared horseradish sauce which I used as a substitute.  It just goes to show you how versatile this recipe is.......I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Blond for sharing!!

I use this for the BBQ sauce in the "Simple Country Ribs" recipe by Phoenix33_64 from this site. I make 48 servings, which seems like a waste for one meal, but it tastes sooooo good. I thought I might try freezing the leftover BBQ sauce to reuse it a second time for the same recipe. Does anyone think it would be a problem freezing and reusing the sauce after cooking with pork ribs for 40 minutes? I would appreciate your help. Thanks.

I thought this was really good.  Very easy to make. I didn't have taco sauce so I used 1 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used regular dried mustard.  My family prefers a sweeter bbq sauce rather than spicy so i left out the hot sauce.  It was great. Everyone loved it!

Made this last night.  WOW AWESOME!!  I added (as suggested) Garlic Powder as well as Onion Powder and a couple shakes of Sarachi (hot sauce).  YUMMY!!  Put it on Chicken thighs (reserved 1/4 for "dipping later")  Wonderful sauce, and I will definitely make this one again.  I'm sure it would be fabulous on Shrimp, Steak or pork as well.  AWESOME!!!

My family loves this sauce! I halve the oil but that's the only change I make. I cook whatever kind of meat in the crock pot with just broth, after it's finished cooking I drain it, shred, and stir in this sauce. Weird combination of ingredients but it works.
