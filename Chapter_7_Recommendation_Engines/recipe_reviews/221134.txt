Great recipe! When I made second time, I let it sit for 4-5 hrs before serving, and found it tastes much better. Also I cut back on the amount of dressing made. Will definitely make again and again.

This is wonderful!   The only change that I made was to add only 1/2 of the amount of ketchup that was suggested.  I also omitted the onion at first and realized that it didn't have enough zing, so after adding the onion and marinating it over night, it was fabulous.  I also sent the receipt over to one of my friends that loves to cook too.   Thanks so much to author of the recipe!

A macaroni salad that wasn't just a macaroni salad. I thought it was cool and refreshing.  This recipe made a huge amount.  Next time I try it I will cut the recipe in half, even if it is for a potluck.

A nice change for pasta salad.  I had leftover mini penne pasta and it worked great in this recipe.  I made up half the dressing amount and used an orange bell pepper, as that is what I had on hand.  I decreased the sugar, just a tad, and the dressing was great.  The dressing alone would be great on a tossed salad.  Definitely a salad I would make again, as it is something different, and we like different.  Served it with a bowl of spicy chili and we enjoyed the mixture of spice and sweet.
