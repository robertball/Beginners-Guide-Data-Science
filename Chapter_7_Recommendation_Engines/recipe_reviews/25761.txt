This was a very good cookie, not too sweet.  Make sure you make the balls 1" because these cookies do puff up and filling will just coat the top if indentions are not deep enough.

I will make this cookie again.

Great cookies!  The Dough was very sticky and a little difficult to work with but I wet my hands somewhat and it made all the difference, will definately make these again!

Excellent cookie especially for pecan pie lovers... the soft dough is not too sweet and the gooey pecan center is tastey. I'll make more of the filling next time, though. I guess I'm too generous with the goo. 

As a holiday twist, you could color the dough to make little wreaths or you could sprinkle colored sugars on the dough as you are rolling the balls. I used red and green sugar (not enough to cover, just enough to speckle the dough.) The cookies looked quite festive but were not sweetened too much. It was a great addition to a wonderful cookie.

What a fantastic cookie! My 4 year old said it was the best cookie I ever made in my life, so that is high praise!  I used a 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon both for the indentations and for scooping in the nut mixture and it worked great.

These are pretty good.  Be sure not to overbake, as they don't get brown, and they'll be hard as rocks if you eyeball them for "doneness"!!  Very unique, and different from my usual cookies, but really good!

Excellent cookies.  I made my dough a little drier (i.e., added a bit more flour) due to comments about stickiness here. Then the dry dough cracked when I pressed it down to fill, so it's a trade off.  I made a variation with raspberry jam instead or in addition to the pecans. I think the combo of the raspberry and pecan was excellent.  Also used part white wheat flour (to be healthier), which worked well.

These weren't quite the prettiest, they spread a little bit and got a little puffed up, but they were soft and moist and were like pecan pie cookies. A very tasty little cookie.

I used the conversion chart and the batter was so dry.  I really tried to bake and make this work.  It didn't work well.  I would not recommend doubling or tripling the recipe.

This recipe produced wonderful, chewy cookies with a great carmel flavor from the brown sugar.  I took the advice from a previous reviewer and made my indentations deep - I just used my thumb which worked fine.  Great recipe!

This was my first time making these  -  mmmmm mmmmm Good!  and easy to make.  Tip - use the back of a plastic measuring teaspoon to make your indent.  They looked perfect when we were done like store bought.  very good.

A very good cookie.  I didn't have any problems with sticky dough but the cookie is a little too boring to be considered "the Best!" Maybe drizzling it with caramel or chocolate as others have suggested would push it up a notch?

YUMM-O I chopped the pecans and rolled the dough balls in them. Then pressed a chocolate kiss in the centers and baked as recipe called for and what a great treat.

A bit too dry for my liking.  I'm not typically a baker, so just followed the recipe as written (actually, what you should do when offering a rating; new concept for this site),  so can't offer the 5 changes that others would provide to make this 5 star.  It's a great cookie idea on which I wish I knew how to improve.  Thanks for the offering .

My 9 year old daughter made these cookies for her 1st year 4-H project.  She received the grand champion ribbon for these!  They are really good and easy to make...we always make a double batch!

This is the most delicious cookie recipe. If you LOVE pecan pie, this is the cookie for you...I get request for this cookie, at every Christmas party and family
Holiday gathering...
My recipe for this cookie came out of the Land O Lakes recipe collection...Although, very similar to this same recipe, one of the differences is to use Heavy Whipping Cream (Land O Lakes) instead of the sour cream...I bake on 325 for 7 to 8 Mins.
This is just ONE AMAZING COOKIE!!

These were easy to make.  I had no problem rolling the dough into little balls and I used the end of my wooden spoon to create the indention.  However, I like my desserts sweet, and these aren't really.  So, I sprinkled mine with sugar before filling, which I thought made them better (sweeter!).  Also, I only baked them for 8 minutes so they'd be nice and soft... they turned out perfectly.

The cookie lacks flavor but the filling is quite nice.  It almost has a pecan pie taste.  I will use this filling with another thumbprint cookie recipe.

The filling is very yummy. the cookie isn't bad but I would possibly try another thumbprint recipe for the dough and use this filling. I doubled the filling because I wanted to be sure I could be generous with it.

The filling looked disgusting after baking.  I ended up drizzling them with chocolate to try to make them look more appetizing.  Also, they spread much more than thumbprint cookies.  The flavor was good.

This cookie has been requested for me to make again. I made the above recipe with a double batch of the pecan mixture and used 3/4 of it.  For me one batch of the mixture wasn't enough.

These are WAY yummy (with that much brown sugar, how could they not be???) although they looked a little cuter BEFORE they baked - the spreading of the cookie took away the perfect roundness of my vanilla cap depressions!  I made exactly 30 cookies and I can highly recommend these when you've got a sweet tooth and a penchant for pecan pie.

This recipe was wonderful.  I had a limited amount of ingredients, and this cookie fit the bill perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out looking great -- very soft, not too sweet, and that yummy, gooey filling.

I really enjoyed these cookies.  My dough came out very crumbly so I was a little concerned.  Couldn't really "roll" them into balls, I kind of pressed them into balls.  But they baked up just fine.  I liked the filling and to me they didn't taste too sweet.  Thanks for a cookie recipe that's out-of-the-ordinary and great tasting :)

These cookies are yummy.  I only wish that the cookie part could be made ever so slightly less sweet.  The filling is very nice, sweet, nutty, with a mild tang.  Adding this one to my holiday favorites.

This is a very tasty cookie.  It looks nice, without being too much work.  I make these around the holidays for my cookie trays.  Sometimes, I add a finley shredded coconut to the filling mixture and increase the sour cream a little.

I was really looking forward to these after reading all the good reviews.  The cookie batter was so sticky I needed to add quite a bit more flour to make it manageable to roll it in balls.  Then the filling was not was I was expecting as far as taste.  I thought it was a little strange combination with the sour cream and pecans.  I was hoping for more of a pecan pie flavor.  I put them on my tray of cookies anyhow but didn't get any feedback from anyone so I guess that says something.

I tripled this recipe and everyone love them. I added them to platters of cookies I give away at Christmas, and when I asked people which cookies they liked best, many chose these. They took some time to make, but they were worth it. I used a handle on a wooden spoon to make the hole for the filling, and I used a baby spoon to fill the hole with the pecan/brown sugar/sour cream mixture. I'll be making these again next year.

The texture and consistency in these is absolutely unbeatable - they melt in your mouth and then some, SO heavenly!  They could have a tad more flavor - perhaps more vanilla, a dash of almond extract, cinnamon - something to give it more pizzazz.  Otherwise, an amazing cookie.

I was told to remember the changes I made to this recipe so I could repeat it. :-)  Because of the reviews that said the topping was great but the cookie didn’t have much flavor I added 2/3 tsp of Cinnamon and 1/2 Tbl of light molasses to the cookie dough. I also followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and made half again as much topping as it called for. Yummy!

I made these for my Ladies Christmas Party at our church, and they were a hit!  My dough balls (36) were a little larger than 1", so I went ahead and doubled the pecan filling.

These cookies were super easy  to make and turned out amazing! Not too sweet and nice and soft. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the dough turned out a bit dry, but was an easy fix adding a bit of milk to moisten it up,. Great recipe other wise and will absolutely be making again

These were rich, buttery, and chewy.  Very yummy!  They spread quite a bit and were flat, not like a "thumbprint" cookie that holds its shape, like I expected, but wonderful nonetheless.  I used the 1/2 teaspoon measure for making the indent and filling and that worked super.

Excellent cookie.  Very buttery.  Only drawback is they are quite soft and stick together a little when stored, but well worth the effort.  Took them to work and everyone loved them!

These cookies were very tasty! I was afraid to spoon too much of the pecan filling into the indents thinking it might ooze over the edge, but I ending up having some leftover and wishing I would've used more since the pecan filling is so good! I'll be sure to make these again.

Being a soft cookie lover, I was a little reluctant to try this recipe because of it not having a lot of wet ingredients. Boy, was I surprised!! This has to be one of the all time best cookies I have ever made, hands down. It is moist and rich, and has just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy your craving. The dough is dry when you roll the balls out, but it definitely bakes into a soft cookie. And the filling - YUM!! I will be making this recipe again and again. Thanks for such a delightful cookie recipe!

These were wonderful!  Soft and buttery on the outside, chewy and gooey on the inside.  It didn't make quite as many as I thought it would...guess I made them too big.  Definitely a keeper!

Each year we make Christmas cookies for our family,  friends and neighbors. This year we did over 500 dozen. We found this cookie just after finishing this year. It will be on our baking list next year. This is one of the best cookies I've ever tasted.
