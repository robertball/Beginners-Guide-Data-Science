I found this lasagna a bit on the dry side and in need of more seasonings.  It needed more ricotta, more sauce, maybe some basil, a bit of sugar (to reduce the acidity of the tomatoes) and definitely more salt. I think it would also be more flavorful if Italian sausage was added in with the ground beef. I'm sorry, but I will not be making this again.

This is now our favorite lasagna recipe and we're gone through quite a few.  Great flavor while being described as "light" by my son.  Delicious!

This was an easy and delicious lasagna! Loved that  it uses uncooked lasagna noodles :)  I used some colby jack cheese for the topping as well. And I sneakily layered some sauteed kale over the tomato mixture . It was delicious! Love the red pepper flakes, too! Thanks, Hunts!
