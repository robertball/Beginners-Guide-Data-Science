I found the flavor of brown sugar a little to strong but my boyfriend enjoyed them. I may try this again.

2.24.19  First, I have to say that this did not even come close to what I thought I was making which was “chocolate rice crispy treats” which I could cut into bars.  I bought a box of Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies®, tasted it, and found this cereal super sweet.  The only deviation I made from the recipe instructions was reducing the amount of the brown sugar.  When this came out of the oven, bubbling, I sprinkled the chocolate chips on the top, waited a few minutes for them to soften, but they didn’t soften enough to spread them.  The recipe doesn’t tell you what kind of almonds to use (whole, slivers, sliced?), so I used sliced, but was unable to even press them down into the chocolate because the chips hadn’t softened enough.  I put this in the fridge overnight, and what I ended up with is something that tastes like candy.  It falls apart when you try to cut it, almonds and chips falling off, and looks like you’ve broken apart a large piece of candy bark, just not easy at all to eat.  Not sure what went wrong here, but I won’t be making this  again.  I’m giving this 2 stars because it didn’t taste bad, but this was a huge  disappointment!
