These are as good as gluten free baking will get!  I added a 1/4 t ground cloves, a 1/8 t nutmeg and a 1/8 t ginger to these to spice them up.  They are really good!  The batter will be sticky when you're done, so I recommend putting it in the fridge for 15 minutes or so for easier handling.

Thanks so much for sharing. I added 3/4 of a cup of soaked raisins, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves and 1 teaspoon of xanthum gum for the texture help. A nutritious and tasty snack.

I made these cookies with potato flour and not potato starch. There is a big difference. When I printed the recipe out awhile ago, that is what the recipe said. As I looked over the recipe again to do the review, the recipe now says potato starch. I feel the review is not indicitive of the recipe now.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I added some chopped dried cranberries to the top before baking, and then dusted with powdered sugar when cool.  A festive looking cookie, as well as tasty, for my non-wheat eating friends.

I made these for a teacher with a wheat allergy, and had to sample a couple myself.  They are fabulous!  This was my first experience making cookies without all-purpose (wheat) flour, and did find the rice flour/potato starch combination create a texture unlike I have ever experienced in a cookie.  Very, very good cookies!

My kids declared these "awesome".  I did increase the sugar to a full cup, and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Would have been better to add chocolate chips, but we didn't have any!  :)

I was so delighted with these cookies, thank you to Beulah! They were easy to make and used limited ingredients, had a great texture and taste for a gluten free cookie!

I thought these turned out wonderfully. I omitted the walnuts and replaced them with Chocolate chips. They were a very big hit.

I personally didn't like this one. I think it would be better if you added more sugar or choc. chips.

We loved these cookies, but I only gave four stars because I modified the recipe. I didn't have enough rice flour so I used half rice and half coconut flour. I also used the original spices but then added more of my own after trying the original recipe. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp salt. I also rolled the cookie balls into sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet to flatten. This made them a little sweeter and gave them a nice little crunch. They're so good they're addictive!! My husband finished off most of them and he doesn't need gluten free.

I made these cookies for a friend who cannot have gluten, soy, dairy OR nuts so I substituted 1/2 cup of brown rice flour for the 1/2 of ground walnuts.  I was so delighted with how these turned out, I ate two of them before I managed to package them up for delivery to my friend!

Pretty good. I had to add some spice, 1/4 tsp. clove, (could've done more) and I added chocolate chips per other reviews. I subbed flaxmeal for the ground walnuts to make them nut free. I used margarine instead of shortening, so I just dropped them on the cookie sheet and they baked up beautifully. This would be a 5 star recipe if more spices were added - maybe some salt too.

Good recipe. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg also and skor bits instead of the nuts. When finished baking and cooled I drizzled the cookies with white chocolate. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I was looking for a good gluten free dessert for my husband, and was quite disappointed. While the flavor itself was satisfactory, the texture was extremely dry and crumbly. They fall apart easily when picked up.  I will not be making these again.

While a hair dry, these cookies were the only thing my gluten-intolerant mother ate for desert on thanksgiving.  Some gluten-intolerant people can be deterred from deserts by all the necessary substitutions that make them a bit too far from the original. However, these were just regular old cookies to Mom, and that made the holiday for us. Thank you so much!

I prepared these per directions except for omitting the nuts. They had a good flavor and looked nice, but the texture was too doughy. I develop gluten free recipes and mine never have this sort of doughy texture. I'm disappointed. Maybe they need the crunch of nuts to be worthwhile.

GREAT recipe! Substituted rice starch because of allergies, but cookies turned out tasty and the texture is as good as it gets without wheat flour. Also sub walnuts for chocolate chips :)

I loved these cookies! I used butter for the shortening and 3 tsp of pumpkin spice in place of the spices. The cookies came out moist and for gluten free, they held together pretty good. I always try to make gluten free treats small - one to two bites since they tend to fall apart.

I added chocolate chips to them, they do need a bit more flavor not enough pumpkin or sweet flavor so the chocolate chips were a help. My 15 year old son loved them. I'm still getting used to the GF life so my taste buds are still in the picky stage.  All in all though compared to other GF cookies these were great.
