Great Cookie! Exactly what I was looking for in taste, ease and presentation. This is the first time I have ever used the cookie mix from the baking aisle. I have tried the refrigerated variety and have never had much luck with them so I was a little hesitant. The previous review stated that the cookie was a little bland so I upped the orange extract just a little and used Ghirardelli chips for dipping. Perfect.

Excellent cookies.  Got rave reviews from my office party.  These are even better when they sit for several days in a container.  So delicious just as the recipe is written.  Thank you!

I followed this recipe to the letter and thought it was a pretty cookie but it lacked flavor. I might try the next time to add some other flavorings just to spice it up.

I was skeptical when I read this recipe since I have never used a cookie mix before.  But they were on sale, so I took a chance. I am very glad I did. I was alittle heavy handed with the orange extract, accident. Made as directed otherwise. The first batch was getting too brown at 12 mins, so I turned down the oven to 350, and kept a really close eye on them. The remaining cookies look just like the ones in the picture. Wow! They are soft, chewy and tasty. Great recipe.

Very nice!  I had a problem with the bottoms browning too fast (no idea why) which was dissapointing but does not reflect my review. I am giving this 4 stars because a whole packet of chocolate chips would have been enough to dip the entire cookie in and then some so I wound up throwing quite a bit out!  That is very frustrating at the prices of baking supplies now!!

I added this recipe to my holiday baking this year.  As other reviewers said, they made a nice presentation but I thought lacked flavor.

I made these because someone mentioned them on the recipe buzz. I really do not care for bagged cookie mixes, but decided I would give it a try because I thought the flavor combination sounded interesting. But, the cookie mix didn't transform itself. It still tasted like bagged or boxed cookie mix. The dried apricots don't soften up at all, in the cookie as I had hoped, and make an odd texture of hard apricot bits throughout the cookie. The orange flavor really couldn't mask the instant cookie mix taste either and could barely be tasted except for a slight tartness. On the chocolate part it will not dip unless it is thinned with a spoon or two of vegetable oil, after it is melted, or the cookies will break. I went with 1/2 bag of chocolate chips, as a whole bag seemed like quite a bit. Overall, apricot jam works for me, on a cookie, but not dried apricots. And, I guess I am just not a fan of bagged mixes still. They are just way too sweet. I hate to toss any food out, but we probably will not eat them. I really had wished this would have worked as they were not cheap to make.
