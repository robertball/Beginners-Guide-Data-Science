This stuff is the bomb! I cheated, however, and modified it a little according to others opinions. Instead of leaving half of the berries unmashed and mashing the other half, I did 3/4 unmashed and 1/4 mashed. It was PERFECT - not too sweet and jammy that way! I still kept the measurements of cornstarch at 3T, but I cut down on the sugar (used 3/4 cup) and the water (used 1/2 cup). I did NOT cook the mixture for 10 minutes like the recipe says. I added everything together in the cold pot, then turned it on to med-high and stirred it CONSTANTLY until it started boiling. Leave it at boiling for 2-3 minutes. It gets thick really fast. I let it cool for a couple of minutes and poured it on the pie. After only 1 hour in the fridge, it was set perfectly!

We loved this pie for Easter. I used more strawberries in the sauce than it called for. The clencher that took it over the top was after the shell was baked I melted about 2 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave and "painted" the inside of the crust with the melted chocolate! Unbelievably awesome! Strawberry pies are notorious for getting soggy - with the painted chocolate crust that was avoided. After you paint the crust be sure to put it in the refrigerator and let the chocolate set up before you fill it.

I use a very similar recipe to this from a Farm Journals Pie Book (from 1965).  Mine just calls for more berries (1 1/2 qts.) and less water (only 1/2 cup).  You crush 1 cup worth of berries and add the water to that.  Mix the sugar and cornstarch together (will blend much better) and then bring the whole thing to a boil. Let it boil for 2 minutes until thick and translucent.  Add 1 tbs. butter and let it cool before adding to the crust.  I find that it avoids getting a soggy crust that way. I would highly (highly, highly, highly) advise never to use store bought strawberries.  If you have a farmers market or a pick-your-own place just use those.  You'll never get the true flavor of the pie otherwise.  I just made this yesterday for Father's Day (made a 10-inch version) and there's none left.  Also good to try this with other fruit (I've done raspberries and peaches)

For a great taste, use gingerale instead of water. What it does for the flavor is unbelievable.

I've made a silimar version of this pie for several years and the priamry differences are: I use fewer mashed strawberries and incorporated them into the simple syrup I made. For the simple syrup I used 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons corn starch and I cup sugar. Cook this mixture over meduim heat until thick and clear. Remove from heat and add 2 tablespoons strawberry Jell-O powder. Add mashed strawberries and proceed as directed. This give flavor and color to the pie.

I was rushing when I made this recipe the first time, and accidently dumped the 1/2 cup of whipping cream in with the mashed (or in my case, blended) strawberries, sugar, water, and cornstarch.  It was FANTASTIC!  I have made this recipe without the extra whipping cream, and I prefer the creamy version.  Cream or no, it is a fabulous and easy recipe.  My guests have left raving about it.

8/8/06: A marvelous pie to take advantage of red, ripe strawberry season!  Although it is definitely a plan-ahead pie, as mine needed a full 24 hours in the fridge to completely set.  I sliced it at 12 hours and the interior was not yet firm (but maybe my strawberries were not completely dry from rinsing).  Taking a cue from other reviewers who found this pie too sweet, I used 3/4 cup sugar and found that it was just the right sweetness to complement the tart fresh strawberries.  After mashing, I used a hand mixer to puree the strawberries and liked the results.  It was delicious with a dollop of whipped cream on top, but I might even prefer a layer of vanilla custard on the bottom.  I think I'll try that next time.  Thanks for a wonderful New Jersey recipe! UPDATE 5/13/07: I've made this pie several more times, and I have decided the vanilla custard, while a nice addition, actually gets lost amongst the strong berry flavor.  The pie has never been as firm as I would like it to be, but the taste is consistently a big hit.  I have found that reserving some sliced strawberries to sink into the top after your pour the filling is a nice way to create an impressive presentation (the strawberries have to be covered by a little bit of the glaze so they do not dry out).

This was one of two pies I made for my dad’s b-day; it disappeared so quickly that he didn’t even get a piece! I used ¾ c. sugar and mashed ¼ of the strawberries, but next time I may mash the recommended amount. I make all my crusts from scratch, but this was my first time making a pie where the actual pie filling didn’t need to be baked but the crust still did. Baking a pie crust w/o the filling inside is called pre-baking or blind baking. I did some research on this: when pre-baking a crust, it will need to be weighted so that the edges of the crust don’t fall down while baking. To pre-bake an unfilled pie crust place the crust in the pie pan, grease one side of a large piece of aluminum foil, and place the foil into the pan with the greased side down. Make sure the foil is large enough so that several inches of overhang are left around the pan edges; leave enough so that the foil can be grabbed and pulled out of the pan later. Next, weight the crust by filling the foil-lined pan with dry beans or rice, making sure to fill the pan all the way up. Bake at 450° for 8 to 10 minutes until the crust has firmed up, then remove the foil and beans or rice. To completely bake a pie crust whose filling will spend no time in the oven, continue baking the unweighted crust for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until golden brown. To just pre-bake a crust that will go back in the oven later, bake the weighted crust as above, remove the foil and beans or rice, and only bake 5 minutes more.

Without hesitation, this pie deserves more than a 5 star rating.  It is delicious.  If you really want to impress your guests, this is the way to do it. Look forward to making this pie with fresh strawberries from my garden this year.  By the way, I'm originally from North Jersey, Bergen County.  Now live in Upstate New York, been married to my husband, a dairy farmer, for 30+ years.  We have two children, and two grandsons. I do miss my hometown where I grew up and hope to visit there this summer.   Thank you for this recipe, and thanks for listening!!  God Bless.

My family really liked this pie. I used the ingredient's quantities as listed on the recipe and it was perfect. The strawberries were large so I cut them in half. I also used  3/4 of strawberries in the shell and the remainder for the sauce. After the sauce had cooked I put it in a food processor till it was silky smooth. I carefully spooned it over the strawberries in the   shell so as not to overdo it, being sure to get it into  all the crevices.

This has been my go-to recipe for Strawberry pie for the past 6 years and is one that friends and family look forward to each spring. I made it for the first few years as written, and was disappointed that sometimes, the thickened glaze did not encorporate evenly with the strawberries in the pie. Now, I fold the uncooked strawberries into the glaze and add the whole thing to the pie. It just works better!

Wow! This pie was fantastic! I made a few minor changes based on other's reviews. The recipe called for 4 cups
(1 quart) of strawberries. I placed 3 cups (instead of 2 cups) of strawberries in the pie shell, and  mashed the other 1 cup. I decreased the water to 1/2 cup, and decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup. (The sugar should be adjusted to the sweetness of the berries. The berries I used were fairly tart, and even 2/3 cup sugar was a little on the sweet side). I kept the cornstarch at 3 tbsp and cooked the mashed strawberry mixture for about 4 minutes until the cornstarchy "taste and look" disappeared. The color was a lovely rose-red. It was completely set up in the fridge within 2 hours, and 6 servings were devoured within 5 minutes. My family loved it! Definitely a keeper!

This was a great recipe. Very easy to make, though took some time to prep all fruit and layers. I added a layer of vanilla pudding on the bottom as well - made for nice texture to tart strawberries!

This pie had a really good flavor but I could not get it to thicken.  My pie was nothing but strawberries swimming in pink liquid.  I followed the directions, adding the right amount of cornstarch and refrigerating for over 5 hours so I don't understand what went wrong.

This Strawberry pie is the best!!! Regarding other comments: I always puree my strawberries in the blender or food processor; I never just mash them. (and I do use about a quart and a half) If you brush egg whites (mix with a little water) on your pie crust before baking it will help prevent a soggy crust and instead of pouring mixture over strawberries mix all in a large bowl and let it cool before adding to pie crust.  Also, if the strawberry mixture is allowed to cook per the recipe it actually reduces the mixture and makes it much thicker than just cooking for a few minutes. (I do only use 1/2 cup water)  I might add 1 drop of red food coloring while cooking but no more to get a redder color.  Finally, I always make my own whipped topping using the whipping cream but I add confectioners sugar to mine after almost finished whipping (taste it) and never use out of season berries.  This pie is always my big hit for Memorial Day and there is NEVER any left! ***THICKENING the sauce - cornstarch needs to be heated to 205 degrees (F) in order to thicken.  Once you add it to your strawberry liquid do not stir! Stirring causes the thickening "agent" to break down.  Cooling also thickens a cornstarch base.  SO - I cook my berry puree, sugar and some water until it reduces and is very hot before adding the cornstarch.  Works perfectly!

The only thing I can add is to suggest spreading melted chocolate on the crust prior to adding the berries. White or dark chocolate adds an amazing accompaniment and keeps the glaze from leaking through.

Make this pie whenever strawberry is in season; better than the ones I use to buy from a pie specialty restaurant. Tips: Start with more fruit than the recipe calls for; perhaps 1 1/2 times. Cut all the strawberries in halves and save the pretty ones for arranging (enough to fill the crust) and use the not-so-pretty for the sauce. Arrange one layer of fresh berry halves on your favorite baked crust, then drizzle some sauce just to fill in the gaps and wet the tops, place another layer of fruit and then sauce again, repeat until the pie crust won´t hold any more layers. This way uses more fruit and any left over sauce can be saved for pancakes or ice-cream topping.

I don't know of many things better than fresh strawberry pie!  I trick I learned is to spread 3 oz. of softened cream cheese over the bottom of the crust, it keeps it from getting soggy and it tastes great too!

With over 160 reviews before me, I'm afraid no one will pay attention to what I have to say.  I made this recipe tonight for a friend's birthday party and it was fantastic!!  For a "no bake" recipe, what a hit!!  Thank you!!

Really nice & simple.  I used 4 cups of strawberries.  I mashed about 1 cup of these to make the "sauce".  I followed other folks suggestions & used 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup sugar & 3 Tbsp corn starch.  I combined all the ingredients, brought them to a boil & simmered for 3-4 minutes - stirring constantly.  I let it cool for a couple of minutes before drizzling over the strawberries in the crust.  Topped with whipped cream - mmmmmmmm!  If I was taking this pie to a potluck, I think I would increase the strawberries a bit more.  The pie looks a little shallow without the whipped cream on it.  Once you add the whipped cream, it does not.

This is very similar to the strawberry pie that I have made for over 40 years. Except, I do add a few drops of red food coloring to the cooked strawberry mixture. The big difference is that I add 3 oz. softened cream cheese to the bottom of pie before adding the whole berries. YUMMMMM  I always get lots of compliments on the taste and presentation.

Delicious!  I used a 14 oz bag of frozen strawberries to make the sauce and then a quart of fresh strawberries to cut up.  Worked perfectly!  
I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from allrecipes and used whipped topping I purchased instead of making my own.  My husband said it was "Kick A**"

Great recipe!  Followed the directions for the most part but stacked more strawberries in a deep dish crust.  Did not have time to make crust but tasted yummy with store bought one.  Used the rest of the strawberries (pint and a half) and put in blender with water, sugar and corn starch until smooth.  Boiled until transparent about 7 mins for me on med low heat.  Completely cooled mixture before spooning in crust.  Put first layer of berries then spooned all the puree then added berries on top before cooling in fridge.  IT WAS YUMMY!! Hubby loved it and is his new favorite!

This is a beautiful pie.  I mix 3oz. cream cheese with powdered sugar & put it on the crust before adding the strawberry mixture.  Adds more flavor. Rate it 5 or more.

I should have listened to some other reviewers and cut back the sugar to 3/4 to 2/3 cups.  This was a tad too sweet for me.  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and spread some cream cheese flavored with sugar and vanilla over the baked crust. (Some of my strawberries had turned bad since I bought them.  Just one day! and I needed the filler)  The glaze thickened fast and turned an unappetizing Pepto Bismol pink, so I added a package of unsweetened strawberry Kool-Ade as suggested by a reviewer, and the color improved.  DH couldn't wait for the pie to set, so we cut into it after only 1 1/2 hours of chilling.  Very good pie!  Will make again with less sugar.

I love this pie. I only added one thing. I used a 1/4 puch of strawberry jello in addition to the corn starch. It turned out perfect and was delicious!

cut the sugar to 3/4 and why the water?  no need for water just lemon juice (1 TBS) and voila!  Reminds me of the Park Cafe pie in St. Marie Montana.  Really good stuff.  It holds for about 3 days with the same great taste and texture.

I have been making this for several years now. I have a strawberry farm close by. The strawberries are picked so fresh and they have great flavor. It is a great pie, because it does not add strawberry gelatin. So many Strawberry Pie recipes, add strawberry gelatin. This recipe allows the true strawberry flavor to come through. But, you do have to have strawberries with great flavor for this to work. I like to use a cookie dough crust and make this in a tart pan.

Excellent pie! I have made it several times, and it's always been a big hit. To make the pie look less pink, I just add a few drops of red food coloring to the glaze, and it looks wonderful! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

WOW! This pie is amazing! I, too, used extra berries and cut them into quarters. I also added a Tablespoon of lemon juice to cut the sweetness. I thought it was a perfect combination of sweet and tart. The consistancy was wonderful, too! Just a note: strawberries by their nature don't like to be "mashed". Allow for "mash" time.

The pie would be great as writtrn. But...I felt that the pie was under-filled  a bit. I took 2 oranges and peeled and chopped them into small bite size pieces. I spread this in between the strawberries in the pie. I then added the thickened sauce mixture over the fruit. I chilled it and served it with whipped cream. We loved the tangy, sweet combination of orange and strawberry.

WOW!  I didn't expect this to be so incredible (just made it because we picked strawberries and my son had asked for a pie with them).  As soon as the crust came out of the oven I sprinkled chocolate chips on the bottom and stuck it in the cooling oven for 2 minutes so it was easy to spread ... no soggy crust and no worries about the holes from my shrunken crust (unusual, but I don't normally prebake them either).

We used about 2 1/2 cups of smashed berries that I pureed to have a smooth consistency ... and took a previous review's suggestion to combine the sugar and cornstarch to avoid lumps.  Just dumped everything together in a pot and simmered it for 10 minutes.

No need for whipped cream because it's absolutely amazing as is!  Thanks OKBEE.  Definitely a keeper :)

Delicious! I tried putting chocolate on the pie crust as one reviewer suggested but I highly advise AGAINST that idea. The chocolate flavor just overpowered the strawberries. Also, I would cut down the sugar to just 1/2 cup because if you have good berries, you don't need so much sugar. I advise to use just 1/4 of the berries for the syrup because mine became too thick to pour over the remaining fruit. Overall it is delicious and would make this again with market fresh strawberries!

It smelled really good but did not set up at all - it was like soup (and should be made in a DEEP DISH).  I asked the Buzz for advise and Baker Bee said "Sometimes if you cook cornstarch at too high of a temperature it can actually destroy its thickening properties. If you have more strawberries to put back in the shell, I would say it is okay to put it back in the pot and try to thicken it. But, make sure to keep the temperature at medium or below and let it slowly come to a boil to thicken. If it isn't thick by the time you are ready to pour it isn't going to get much thicker later."  I got sick and couldn't get back into the kitchen to try cooking it again.  Maybe I'll try this again and watch the boiling process closer.

Wow, how easy!  This was my 14 yr old daughter's first pie, and it turned out awesome!  We did use 3/4 c. splenda and put 1/4 mashed berries in the pot with the cornstarch, sugar and 1/4 c water, stirred constantly until it boiled, then poured it over the berries in the crust.  We also melted 4 oz of milk chocolate morsels and painted the crust.  So tasty and pretty!

Great recipe. Like other reviewers I changed the amount of sugar in mine to 3/4 c. and put 1/2 c. of water in instead of 3/4 c. I also placed a layer of a cream cheese mixture in the shell first. The mixture consisted of 4 oz cream cheese, 6 oz. cool whip, and 1/2 c. sugar. You will not use all of it. This kept the shell from getting soggy, and added a nice texture. Delicious, and I will be making this again!

I used this recipe to make a topping for Chantal's New York Cheesecake. I increased the filling to 18 servings. I took the advice of several other reviewers and made a puree of 1/3 of the strawberries and just quarted the rest. I also made a few changes of my own. I decreased the sugar but I also replaced the white sugar with 3/4 Cup packed brown sugar. I used 1 cup of amaretto liquor instead of water and used 1/4 cup cornstarch. The brown sugar & amaretto liquor was something I learned while working in a 5 star restaurant. The family loved it. I will be making this recipe again.

8/20/08: This was really good.  I would suggest adding some red food coloring (the kind for tinting frosting) to the cooked strawberries.  Otherwise, after you cook the strawberries, they lose their color and look dull and unappetizing.  Update (2/6/16):  I made this again and reduced the water to 1/3 cup - I would reduce it even more next time for a firmer gel.  I would still add some red food gel to give it a bright red color. I did not mash any of the strawberries and it worked great.  I did use 4 lbs. of fresh strawberries (about 9 cups cut up).

I was looking for a strawberry chocolate pie, but couldn't find one, so I modified this recipe. After baking my crust, which was really a good crust, I sprinkled a thin layer of semi-sweet chocolate chips onto the hot crust. When they had melted, I spread the chocolate evenly on the crust bottom and walls. I then made the rest of the pie according to the recipe. Next time I will use more strawberries on the bottom, less cornstarch, as my gell mix was too thick, and a little red food color to disguise the cooked strawberry color. It really took away from the aesthetics of the pie. Over all, the pie tasted really good, and the chocolate added a nice twist.

This was the first strawberry pie I've ever made and it was fabulous. 

I don't like to use gelatin (as most of this type of recipe recommends) and this recipe worked out easy and tasty! Incredibly delicious.

While the cooked part of the recipe was indeed sweet as other reviewers have noted, I think that it was balanced nicely by the tartness of the uncooked strawberries. With the two parts of the recipe mixed together as instructed I did NOT find the pie to be too sweet. I suppose this is up to individual tastes.

I highly recommend this pie to those who love strawberries!

Quick and Simple! I used 2lbs strawberries, mashing 1/3 of them.  1/2 cup sugar.  2T cornstarch with 1/2 cup water. I also painted the pie crust with melted dark choc. and let it cool completely before putting berries in.

Delicious, I took a few recommendations from others, used 3/4c sugar, 3 tables. cornstarch and 1/2c water.  Also only boiled for about 3 mins.  Decided to add dark chocolate to the bottom of crust.  I just added some chucks to the crust right after I took it out of the oven, gave it about 10 mins to melt and spread around crust to provide shell to keep bottom from getting soggy.  Definitely recommend!

Wow!!!  It's very good.  I use this recipe's filling for a cake recipe.  I change it just a little bit for just the filling.  Filling: 1 quart frozen strawberries;  1 1/4 cup white sugar;  6 tablespoons cornstarch and 3/4 cup water.  Use the same directions.  Thank you for this recipe Marge, I'll really like it.  My favorite pie.

My husband and I loved this! Not too sweet or heavy. After reading reviews, I dumped 3 cups of berries in the pie shell and only mashed 1 cup. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar. I used 2/3 cup gingerale instead of 3/4 cup water. Also, I threw all 4 ingredients in the pot at once, and it did not take 10 minutes to thicken.. more like 4. I did used a blender whisk to mix up the cornstarch but you could probably get away without doing that. I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar to my heavy whipping cream (used 2 cups, not 1) and spread it on top of the entire mixture. I popped it into the freezer for 2 hours since I was short on time, and it turned out great. Garnished it with a few leftover strawberries. It was so so easy! Will definitely make this again!

I made this pie for an Easter get-together, and I really enjoyed it. I used a different whipped cream recipe, though. I melted 2 oz dark chocolate and spread it on the pie crust per another reviewer, and that really took it to another level. My only complaint (and the only criticism I heard from other people), was that there was not enough whole, sliced strawberries, and too many "jam-like" strawberries. I actually used around 1.5 lbs strawberries instead of 1 lb. Next time I would make less filling and use more whole sliced strawberries.

Delicious pie.  I was not sure how much a quart of strawberries was, but I used two 1lb punnets, one for the base and one for the sauce, used about 3/4 cup of sugar and a splash of lemon juice for some zip.  Sauce was thickened in about 3-4 minutes   Would be even better with a home made sweet pastry crust.  A delicious taste of summer!

I made this for a friend's birthday, and it was eaten up quick!  I read reviews on either painting on a chocolate layer or spreading on a cream cheese one to prevent the bottom crust from getting soggy, and I ended up spreading a layer of a mix of softened cream cheese, sugar, and a bit of whipped cream the recipe called for.  I will do that again as well, it turned out amazing!  Such a refreshing bottom layer to compliment the sweetness of the filling.  No soggy crust either.  I also used the ratio of 3/4 whole berries in the pie and 1/4 mashed, and I only used a 1/4 cup of sugar too!  A delicious pie that I will make again and again.

this pie was great and so easy.  i read the reviews and used a couple of hints from them.  i replaced the water with ginger ale, and "painted" my pie crust with a melted semi-sweet chocolate chips.  chocolate covered strawberries are wonderful so I figured how could this go wrong?  It was great!  48 hours after the pie was made, the crust is still crisp not soggy!  The flavor with the chocolate and ginger ale is spectacular!  I used 2 quarts of strawberries, picked out the nicer ones for the pie, used the more bruised and much larger ones for the sauce.  Also, I had no trouble with the pie setting up well.  Be sure and cook it the full 12 - 14 minutes and I chilled for 24 hours.  It set up wonderfully and cut great.  

I didn't want to add food color or add the suggestion of jello for color, as I wanted to keep this as "whole food" as I could, with no additional additives.  

I Will definately make this again, probably for our 4th of July party..... for added color I might place some blueberries around the edge of the crust after it is filled for a Red, White & Blue theme!  Thanks for the suggestions, it was perfect!

absolutly wonderful.  I put a layer of Chocolate Ganache  on the bottom, because I was worried that the strawberries my make the crust soggy.  It was very yummy and it was eaten up so fast.  People couldnt stop complimenting how good it was.

I LOVE THIS! so simple and good! a little too much cornstarch, more like 2 tblsp works. I made it 3 cups strawberries, 1 cup thinly sliced apple. SO GOOD!!!!!! another thing-it neeed a little bit of lemon juice to add for flavor. instead, i used lime juice because it goes with strawberries VERY WELL!!! i also made one of this version with 3 cups strawberry, 1 cup banana. it was really good too! thank you so much!

I made this for an office picnic and everyone raved at how wonderful it was.  I used more stawberries than  what this recipe called for because I like lots of fruit in my fruit pie.  I also added a couple of drops of food coloring to the glaze for a brighter color.

This is an awesome recipe; I didn't have to change anything and the pie turned out fantastic!  The glaze was the best: deep red, shiny, thick, and just the right sweetness.  To mash the berries I diced them and placed them in a large ziploc bag and flattened them with a rolling pin, leaving some bits unmashed for texture.

This recipe was so easy and the flavor was fabulous!  I had bought too many strawberries at the farmer's market and this was a perfect way to use them all up.  My daughter and I had to make ourselves stop eating it!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is great!! Used chocolate on the crust, and by the way a qt of strawberries is about 1.5lbs. I sliced my strawberries in my mushroom/egg slicer, picked out the pretty ones for the crust and what was left went in the sauce. I also used my immersion blender to blend, mixed all together and then boiled. As other reviews noted I also added a few drops of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Well this time I decided to cut back on the water as others suggested, oopps!! not enough, had to rush and make more sauce very fast, thankfully it tasted like the first batch. Lesson learned, rather have more than I need than not enough. Left overs make good jam. You can also test your sauce to see how it will set, put on a cold plate, or dip on a spoon lay on some ice, and see if it sets, if not probley  needs longer cooking, also taste before it gets to hot to see if you want more sugar or what. Next time I think I might try adding some vanilla. To bad I had to use my xtra strawberries to make more sauce, I was planning on dipping them in the left over melted chocolate to top my pie with.

I did this recipe with raspberries and blueberries. It was amazing!! I did mini tartlets rather than a pie. I did not let it cook for 10 minutes either, I mixed everything all in the cold pot and stirred the entire time till it came to a boil and then let it boil for a few more minutes. Let it cool completely in the pot, do the crust doesn't get soggy and then put it the fridge. After an hour it was set and they were delicious!!! Gone SO quick!! Thank you!!

I used frozen strawberries, mashed them up, did all the other steps, and worked out fine!! :D Frozen straw. were so much cheaper then fresh ones (frozen: 3.69  fresh: 5.99). Besides, everyone would have probably eat all the fresh ones! LOL, this is a keeper. :)

WOW!!  We LOVE this!!  We bought too many strawberries at the Farmer's Market so I searched for strawberry recipes and found this.  I do not like most pies but absolutely LOVE this and my husband who loves pies LOVES it too.  The only thing I did different because everyone was complaining it was too runny and the crust got soggy is change the amount of water to 1/3 cup and it was perfect!  The crust did not get soggy.  Also, you can brush egg whites on the crust before you cook it to keep it from getting soggy.  I did this the first time I made it and forgot the next time.  It made a difference with the egg whites but with only adding 1/3 cup water it still did not get too soggy without brushing on the egg whites. I have made 3 of these in the last week and will make a few more before strawberry season is over. We also liked it better without the whipped cream because it took a lot of the flavor away but that is just a personal preference.

I am mostly writing this for those of you who discover that you didn't have enough strawberries, or if you would like to make it, and you don't have quite enough strawberries.  I had a little under 4 cups (about 1 lb.) of strawberries, and found out when filling the pie crust that my jelly did not go far enough to fill the spaces.  To compensate I created kind of a strawberry cream pie by whipping 1 1/2 cups heavy cream with 2 tbsp. sugar until past stiff peaks (helps keep better in fridge to whip a bit longer).  I used the whipped cream to fill in all the spaces and make a topping.  I then topped it all with semisweet chocolate chips.  My crust was homemade (see Pie Crust IV). It was delicious.  In terms of the general recipe, I followed the advice of others in a few ways: I used more than half of the strawberries intact in the pie crust, and mashed the lesser part.  I followed the advice of others, and "painted" the crust with 2 oz. semisweet chocolate chips melted (let it harden before adding the filling - it keeps pie from getting soggy).  I also reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup, and the water to 1/2 cup.  I just added all the ingredients together in the pot and brought to a boil, stirring continuously, and kept it at a boil for 3 minutes.

Very tastey. The only thing is that cooking the sauce for 10 minutes seemed a bit much. My sauce came out too thick at 8 minutes, and, actually, the sauce seemed a good consistency at less than 5. I guess the moral is to trust your instinct, not the timer.

This pie is amazing!!!  I have made it twice in one week.  First time I used fresh strawberries only but the second time I decided to use fresh strawberries and frozen blueberries.  Both times I made my own crust and I cut sugar down to 3/4 cup.  We ate it with canned whipped cream.  So good!!

This pie was delicious and I will be making it again.  It was beautiful to look at and really was tasty.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except that I was making two 10 inch pies so I doubled all the ingredients except I used more strawberries & did follow one reviewers advice and (painted) the crust with melted chocolate.  I had so many things going on that I made the pie crusts one evening and cleaned the strawberries and let them dry on paper towels in the fridge until the next day when I made the filling.  I placed the whole strawberries in the chocolate coated pie shell and mixed the sugar & cornstarch together and added the water stirred and then added the strawberries which I pulsed in my food processor. Placed all in a pan and cooked over med high heat stirring constantly until it started to boil then let it simmer for 3 minutes.  Let it cool for about 5 minutes and spooned over the whole strawberries.It was set up in severl hours but I did not serve the pies until the next day and the crust was still good and was not soggy at all. Received many compliments!

Wow is this great!  I used my grandma's strawberry pie crust recipe.  Used 3/4 C sugar (splenda 1/4 C & 2 Tbsps), 1/2 C H20. Just as another reviewer noted, I mixed the mashed strawberries in with the water and then added the mixture of sugar and cornstarch.  My mixture wasn't clear so I was concerned at first but it became a pink translucent mixture pretty quickly.  I would say I only boiled it for about 4-5 minutes max.

This is a great recipe. I just made it for my MIL's birthday party and she, a person who says she does not like desserts, really enjoyed it! My only problem was that I didn't let the mixture cook long enough so it didn't set up completely. After talking to my mother, she says that the filling will be at the right thickness when a spoon dipped into the sauce stays coated upon removing it. I'm going to try this next time and hope it sets up better!

This pie is OUTSTANDING!  I actually used 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1 cup and used maybe a quart and a half of fresh strawberries. (Just picked today! MMMMMMM).  I probably mashed a little less than half the berries too.  I don't think this recipe can be bad whatever you do.  Simple and Delicious!

This recipe is incredible! It was a big hit with my family. Once or twice I've even painted the pie crust with melted chocolate, then let it harden before adding the strawberries, and that was a great success as well.

I folled the instructions using a Pillsbury pie crust (not frozen) and it was one of the best desserts I've ever made.  It was so easy and really quick to make but you'd never know by the taste of it.

Outstanding! I have made this twice now; the first time with a traditional pie crust in a pie pan and it was great. Yesterday I made this pie again but used the shortbread crumb crust from the Fresh Strawberry Almond Pie and put it in an 8X8 square pan.  Not only was it tons faster and easier to make and cut but the crumb crust was excellent with the strawberries. Also, a bit of powdered sugar in your cream will help it hold its peaks when you whip it.

This pie is wonderful.  The glaze is so much better than the stuff you can buy in a jar.  Mine thickened rather quick, so do stir it constantly. I made this in a graham crust, next time I'll try a regular pie crust.

This is possibly the BEST strawberry pie I have eaten!  The texture of the pie is excellent (I hate the "glaze" type pies). I also used the Big Guy Strawberry Pie crust recipe and the pie was excellent.

Very good strawberry pie.  I did add about a tsp of lime juice to the thickened strawberry mixture, and a small pinch of salt.  I've made pies similar to this before, and have had problems with the strawberry filling not thickening enough, but I didn't have that problem with this recipe.  It turned out perfectly.  My daughter says it's the best strawberry pie I've made!

It's fast, it's easy, not too many ingredients, and it's delicious.  Keeps the integrity of the strawberry in the dish.

This was very good...and, I'll say, adaptable.  I had a grocery store shortbread crust (similar to graham cracker crusts).  I made a cream cheese filling (sugar, vanilla, milk) to spread on the bottom of the pie, then added the raw strawberries and then the syrup.  I followed the timing of the syrup and it set beautifully.  I believe my cheese filling prevented the crust from getting soggy as others described.  I will definitely make this again.

Hull and half 3/4 of  the strawberries and pile up in the pie shell.  Mash 1/4 strawberries and add 3/4 c sugar,  1/2 c water, 3 T cornstarch and boil 3 minutes - will be thick.  Pour over strawberries.  Refrigerate for an hour to set.

This was the first time I had made this recipe and it was delicious! That said, I am a relatively novice baker, but the recipe is easy to follow. I did make a few adjustments (like a few other reviewers had mentioned): 1. I used a 1 qt pack of strawberries, but I only used about a 1/4 to 1/3 for the strawberry mixture. 2. I pureed the strawberries instead of mashing for the strawberry mixture (it gave the mixture a nice even consistency) 3. My strawberries were mildly sweet so I cut the sugar down to 3/4 C and the water to 1/2 C. 4. I did a "cold start" like one review had mentioned and placed the puree, sugar, cornstarch, and water all together in one pot and heated it on medium until it thickened. 5. Added about 4 drops of red food coloring to the mixture (color turned out a nice deep red). 6. I find that placing the strawberries whole in the pie shell make it difficult to cut/eat later so I halved a majority of the strawberries used for the filling and quartered other pieces to fill in the gaps. 7. I set aside a little less than 1/4 of the pretty/evenly sized strawberries to slice lengthwise and arrange on top. 8. Did an egg wash on the pie shell prior to baking to help stave off sogginess.  9. Also used a cream cheese/heavy whipping cream mixture to line pie shell before placing strawberries and strawberry mixture in the pie shell- about 1/2 an 8oz bar and ~1/2 C whipped heavy whipping cream  w/ confectioners sugar. Complemented the tartness of the pie nicely. Recommend!

Hubs & I went to a boutique this weekend in a quaint town & he spied a strawberry pie - he just had to have a slice!  He was so disappointed, not flavorfull at all.  Thus I promised to make him the best strawberry pie he'd ever had...(although I'd never made one before!)
Yesterday I used this recipe & the family LOVE LOVE LOVED it!  
I did just see a hint about using gingerale in lieu of water...I think I will try that next time.

Delicious!  I had a deep dish pie crust, so I increased the strawberries to fill the pie (but I kept the other ingredient quantities the same).  I used about 3/4 of the strawberries whole in the pie and mashed the other 1/4 of the strawberries.  Instead of following the directions as written, I mixed the mashed strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, and water in a saucepan and stirred until it boiled, then stirred for a minute or two more until it thickened.  I made two pies and tried pouring the sauce over the berries in the first pie, but it was too thick and it didn't fill in the gaps, so I had to move the berries around to get the sauce to mix into the pie.  With the second pie, I mixed the whole strawberries into the sauce in the pan and poured that mixture into the crust, which was easier.  I "painted" the inside of the second crust with melted chocolate and let it set (as suggested by other reviewers) before adding the strawberries.  It was good with the chocolate, but I think I preferred the pie without chocolate.  I didn't try topping the pie with whipped cream because it was so wonderful that it didn't need it.  I made the pies in the early afternoon and they were set by the evening.  I think this pie will become an annual favorite when U-pick strawberries are in season.

If you use FRESH FROM THE GARDEN STRAWBERRIES this will be a SOUPY MESS. That being said, you can turn this into cobbler very easily and it really is delicious. I used garden fresh strawberries and mashed about 3/4ths of them using the remaining 1/4th to line the bottom of the crust. Minutes after they begin to cook, you will realize how much water there will be. I only mixed 1/2 a cup of water with 3 tbsp of cornstarch and only used 3/4 a cup of sugar plus a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon - still too runny. This is apparently a big complaint with this recipe if you are using "real strawberries". Once I realized how soupy it was, I just made a basic cinnamon/sugar/flour/butter cobbler topping and put it on top. It was very good, just nothing like a set-pie consistency.

Decent flavor, but it wouldn't set. I returned it to the pot and tried to thicken it with more cornstarch and still no luck. My kids were looking forward to this too, but we were all very disappointed. We had just gone strawberry picking.

Like others, I reduced the sugar to just less than 3/4 cup and water to about a 1/2 cup. I went to the local farm and got fresh picked berries, the juice from mashing them allowed me to reduce the water.  I squeezed a little fresh lemon juice while they were cooking - also, I didn't read the whole recipe first and I just dumped the sugar, water, cornstarch and mashed berries all together and cooked the whole thing for 9 minutes at a full boil on medium heat.  The reviewer that said it should coat a spoon was correct.  Also, you must time the cooking - if the berries don't look like a clear glazed appearance, they're not done!  That should help those who ended up with a soupy result.  Also, like another reviewer said, don't bother making this unless you get yourself the freshest, reddest, juiciest berries.  You will have a much more pleasing result, seriously!  We are lucky to have a farm nearby and we freeze berries individually for shortcake throughout the year but nothing is better than fresh strawberries.  This recipe is for the purists - no strawberry jello needed.  Now I just need to learn to make a 'real' pie crust from scratch and I'll be set!  Edited:  Same review but I now spread cream cheese on the shortbread pie crust (Keebler) first and then put the berries and glaze in.  Excellent!

Made exactly per instructions and it was perfect.  I brushed the stored bought pastry with egg whites before baking to keep the bottom crust from getting soggy.  The very taste of SUMMER!

I just made this pie for the first time and it is delicious!  Tastes like strawberry short-cake, but with a crust instead of cake!  I took the advice of others using just 3/4C sugar and 1/2C water.  I still used 3Tbsp cornstarch though, to be sure it set.  I'm glad I didn't use more sugar like the recipe called for, it would have been too sweet.  It was extremely easy to make the glaze!  I just pre-chopped the strawberries, and once softened in the pot with sugar, I mashed them more.  I like the look of strawberry bits in my glaze.  I used red food coloring to brighten it up - but I also used 1 drop blue food coloring to give it a deeper "strawberry" hue - very appealing!  I arranged my strawberries in my shell (I used "Ruth's Grandma's pie crust recipe), and spooned all of the glaze over them, making sure to get in between all the cracks.  It set in about 2 hours and is amazing!  I will definitely make again!

This is so easy and delicious.  We used cool whip to lessen the calorie load.  Used 1/2 cup of Mountain Dew in place of the 3/4 cup water and only 3/4 cup sugar.  Placed 1/3 of the strawberries in the pan and mashed with a potato masher before adding the sugar, cornstarch and Mountain Dew.  Stirred constantly while bringing to a boil and boiled for only 2 - 3 minutes thereafter.  We also had about 2 quarts of strawberries, which we hulled and sliced, placing the prettiest ones in the extra large graham cracker crust, which we painted with some melted semi-sweet chocolate in hopes the crust would not get soggy as quickly.  This tip worked well.  Thanks for sharing and thanks for all the great reviews which helped make this pie the bomb!

We love this pie, but I make it in a shortbread crust, or a shortbread/almond crust.  I use Splenda instead of sugar, because my son is a type 1 diabetic and it comes out great.

Very nice and easy pie to make. I made a crust earlier and when it was cool, brushed it with 2 squares of semi-sweet chocolate that I melted in the microwave. I popped it in the freezer to harden and prepared the strawberries. I used 3/4 c sugar as the recipe suggested for the glaze, but would use less next time. I used way more strawerries than in the recipe and did like other reviewers suggested and used less strawberries for the glaze and more for the pie -- a 3 to 1 ratio.
I sliced the strawberries in half and placed them cut side down in the pie shell and piled them on top of each other.  The glaze was pretty easy to make - the only thing I did was use my braun multi-practic to puree everything once it was cooked.  I took this to a BBQ and everyone loved it.  I think I will do this same thing with peaches as I think it would work well too.

I made this for my daughter who was begging for strawberry pie! I bought fresh organic strawberries from the farmer's market. It came out good, but I've had better at a pie shop where I'm from. It doesn't taste as fresh as I would like it. There was something about the jelly that wasn't perfect to me. Maybe it was the crust. I didn't like the taste of the crust because I used frozen store-bought ready-made crust. I would rather buy from our pie shop, but I would make this again to save $$. My daughter really likes it! Especially with Cool Whip!

I'm not a fan of strawberry pie, but they were beautiful, fragrant, and on sale, so I had to get some. I tried this pie and it was super easy and really very tasty. I painted the inside of the crust with white chocolate, and it gives the crust a nice extra crunch.

I went with the lower sugar/jel option that others mentioned.  It was very good, refreshing, and plenty sweet.  My pick-your-own berries made this wonderful.

I followed the recipe but with only 3/4cups sugar because my strawberries were very sweet already.  The recipe did what it said but the flavor was a little strange. The consistency of the strawberry/sugar/cornstarch mixture was almost like jello once it solidified. I think I expected it to be more jelly like. Overall, I would never have a second serving of this pie so I couldn't give it above 3 stars. My husband did like it and he said 3 stars too.

Yummy!  Per previous reviews, I mashed less of the strawberries (1/3) and added a little less water (2/3 c)...just what it needed!  I also covered the crust with melted chocolate, as suggested.  That was a great idea!  It prevented sogginess and tasted great too.  Also, make sure you let it chill for at least 3 hours.  I took it out after 2 hours, and it was pretty runny.  I think it needed another hour or two to set.

I made 2 of these pies today that will be given as gifts tomorrow for Mother's Day. I did slightly "change things up" a bit by adding some of the suggestions to them (I added the ginger ale instead of water, and lined the pie crusts with a cream cheese mixture. I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup.). They turned out beautiful, and although they've not yet been cut into, they have set very well & do not appear to be "runny" at all. I sampled some of the mixture, and found it to be a tad sweet, even with the 3/4 of a cup sugar instead of 1 cup... so I think next time I'll maybe do 1/2 of a cup. I will definately be making this again soon, because my kids are begging me for one! :) Great recipe! Thanks so much for it & the suggestions!

This turned out OK - but the crust got really soggy after sitting in the fridge for a day or two.

I made this for Easter dessert and it tastes great! Mine got a little juicy but I think that's because my berries were big so I cut some of them in half. I think whole berries would have held up better. I will definitely make it again so I will use smaller whole berries. I also used my regular pie pan rather than my deep dish one and that was a mistake as well. I answered the phone just as I was ready to pour the cooked berries over the uncooked ones and I let the syrup overflow the edges of the crust! DOH! But my little granddaughters and I didn't mind at all because the flavor was delicious!

This came out very very good.  It tasted so fresh and fruity, not like jam at all.  I did put closer to 2/3 the strawberries in whole rather than half, so that might have had something to do with it.  I also coated the crust in dark chocolate to stop it from getting soggy.  That was great, just a bit of chocolate goes really well, though it did make the crust a bit hard to cut through.  Still, I would make this again.

Delicious!! I made this pie into mini-bite sized strawberry pies and they were fabulous! A nice sweet treat after a meal. The only thing I changed was a reduction in sugar based on some of the other reviews. After making the mini pies, I had some of the mixture left over. I poured it over crushed nilla wafers that I baked with butter to make a crust. Also, delicious!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and painted the crust with melted semi-sweet chocolate it definitely keeps the crust from getting mushy. Also, I lowered the amount of sugar (to 3/4 c) and water (1/2 c)in the sauce which was a good move.  I ended up adding a little more water in the end, because the corn starch thickened it up a little bit too much, so in the future maybe decrease the amount of corn starch. But a wonderful recipe!

Wonderfully fresh!  I mashed 1 cup strawberrries and left 3 cups sliced.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla to the cooked mixture and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and the water to 1/2 cup.  A classic summertime treat!  Thank you.

I took the suggestion of reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup and using 1/4 cup of water.  The pie, made that way, is good.... but I think the extra 1/4 cup of sugar will be the factor to move it up to five stars (though this might depend on the natural sweetness of the strawberries).  I also followed the suggestion to put all the ingredients (Strawberries, corn starch, sugar) in a cold pot and bring it to a boil while stirring constantly.  Worked great - only needed to boil for about a minute.  Next time I think I will very briefly blend the strawberries rather than mash them for a smoother consistency.

Very easy to make and it's a great way to use up strawberries if you buy a flat of them or something. My only criticism would be that it's very much like eating jam on top of pie crust. I would probably put a layer of cheesecake or something underneath it in the future.

Yum, there is nothing like the taste of fresh strawberry pie, and this is a great recipe.  I took the advice of several other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, which preserved a little more of the tart flavor of the strawberries.  My fix for making sure the glaze set up was to use my food processor to make a smooth puree out of the water, sugar and strawberries, to which I added 4 Tbsp. of cornstarch (1 more than the recipe recommends).  I then cooked this until it thickened, cooled it to room temperature, stirred the remaining sliced berries into it, and poured it all into the shell.  Refrigerating for a couple of hours before serving completed the process, and it turned out fantastic.  I like the idea of brushing the crust with egg white before baking--unfortunately, I already had mine in the oven when I read that tip, but I'll try that next time.  Excellent idea for a pie with a fresh fruit filling.

this recipe was Fantastic. I loved the taste of the Freshness of the Berries. Not to sweet at all. I followed the advice of other cooks and did 3/4 berries in pie and 1/4 pureed. and I only 3/4 cup of sugar and I think this made it perfect. I did it in a Shortbread crust which I think set if off Just perfectly. I let it Set for a good 24 hours in the fridge and it was not soupy or fall apart at all like a lot of my other family members pies too. this will be a recipe I will use for years to come.

Thank you OKBEE! Excellent dessert. Made it exactly as directed. I have noticed people adding this, or taking that away which is fine for everyone's individual tastes, but what an excellent dessert all on its own. Cheers and thanks again. (Especially from my husband :-)

I thought this was a good base recipe.  I did change it up a bit and it still came out wonderful.  Instead of the 1 cup of sugar I used 1/8 of a cup of Agave.  You can get Agave now in your local grocery store in the health food section or at your local health food store.

This is one of my most favourites. I have been making it forever but at little different. I don't mash any berries. Just heap them all in the shell and add a package of strawberry jello to the sugar, cornstarch, water mix after it has thickened. I also make this same pie but with peaches and peach jello.

EXCELLENT!! I have never made my own glaze before now. I always bought the glaze in the plastic tube bag. HUGE MISTAKE now that I know what it should taste like. I will not buy it ever again. This recipe is great. I used some of the others suggestions about using less  water & sugar. I used SPLENDA since I have diabetes. The result was wonderful. I have an over abundance of strawberries in my patch this year, so I will be making this a lot. I did coat my crust with the chocolate. (gotta cheat a little). I also used more strawberries than called for and cooled my glaze a little, then mixed my strawberries in it so they would all get a good covering.    Thanks for sharing.

This is a delicious strawberry pie, and so easy to make. I used two large bags of frozen strawberries and it was just right. I put one bag in the baked pie shell, and the other in a pan on the stove to make the sauce. Very good!

This recipe is one of the best ways I've seen to get strawberries into a pie (strawberry-rhubarb is right up there, too). One addition I made was to spread 3 oz of cream cheese (softened and whipped) to the bottom of the cooked and cooled pie shell, before arranging the berries. It helps keep the crust from getting soggy, and adds a welcome contrast to the sweetness of the filling.

This is a winner. Can be too sweet if you're not careful w/the the sugar but very very good regardless. Try pureeing the mashed mixture for a smoother pie. I am also going to try to play around with other crusts (graham cracker or cake) and try layering this (cheesecake, mousse, etc.) Delicious!

Delicious and addicting... but very messy/sloppy looking.  My crust (store-bought shortbread crust) got soaked.  Still, 5 stars for taste!

Loved the recipe (as i did not have gelatin on hand). I had just gotten back from the farmers market where i got a great deal on strawberries. I have to give it 4 out of 5 because i did change a few things. Instead of 1 cup of sugar, i used 1/2 cup splenda, and 1/4 cup sugar to reduce sweetness. Then i added only 1/2 cup water, with 2-3 tablespoon cream- this gave it a creamier consistency.
I also adjusted the strawberry ratio... i used 3/4 (cut in half) and 1/4 mashed. (instead of 1/2 mashed and 1/2 whole)
I also used a pre-made pie crust left over from making tarts a couple nights before, and sprinkled very lightly with nutmeg.... so simple and easy. I will be making it again!

I made this pie last night and it was perfect.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used 3/4 c sugar and 1/2 c water which made the pie not too sweet.  This will be my summer dessert for picnics!  Thank you for sharing!

My BF turned me on to this recipe and I must say it is delicious!  I should have left it in the fridge to firm up a bit more, but my very anxious husband talked me into slicing into it a bit soon.  Still....most fabulous!  With fresh whipped cream on top...to die for!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great pie!  Only mod I did was to use more strawberries.  The pie did set but wasn't super firm.  I may add another tablespoon of cornstarch next time as others have suggested. And a layer of cream cheese on the bottom is always a good thing!

yum!. mine didn't turn out runny at all and i didn't use any more cornstarch than what it said.
i blended the strawberries instead of mashing them. then when i poured the cornstarch/water mixture in, i put it on close to high heat to get it to thicken up right away, then i turned it down. i've noticed if i don't do that (the high heat at the beginning) with recipes that call for cornstarch it doesn't thicken up as well. make sure you don't burn it though.

The concept of using fresh strawberries instead of jello for the red coloring is genius but the instructions need to be finessed a bit.  I would only mash up 1/4 of what you are using since the big fresh berries is what gives it the best sweet taste.  Sugar the mashed berries with 1/4 cup sugar, enough to draw out liquid.  Heat to a boil, add cornstarch and water SLOWLY until desired consistency (coats wooden spoon), you can add more water/sugar to adjust the amount of sauce,  Then mix fresh cut up berries with sauce BEFORE piling them onto the pie crust.  Much more even this way!

If I do, I may add egg yolk on the strawberry mixture to give richer taste.

This was my first attempt at pie making and it couldn't have turned out better... DELICIOUS!!! I made a graham cracker crust, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, used 4 tablespoons of corn starch instead of 3, added some fresh lemon juice and my pie turned out perfectly!! Everyone in my family absolutely LOVED it!!

Tasted great but looked so unappetizing I had to tilt my camera to shoot the cross section (see photo).  

The amount of starch called for in the recipe made the topping so thick and gooey and awful looking I almost didn't want to eat it.

But the whole berries I put into the pie shell, and the pie shell recipe I used (very flaky) saved the pie and we ended up liking it.

So easy and soooo good.the only change i made was i added 3 tablespoons of strawberry jello to the cornstarch mixture.i thought that would help since i read in some other reveiws that it was a little runny.

I've rated this a four because it didn't thicken and was too sweet for my taste.  This is a keeper for me, however, next time I'm cutting sugar to 1/2 cup and increasing cornstarch to 4 tables per previous reviews.  I've considered adding tapioca as a thickener as well - has anyone tried that?  I had no problem obtaining a beautiful red color as the strawberries cooked.  I also plan to use recipe for cake filling once I've accomplished the thickening.  Thanks Marge for a wonderful recipe - I believe I just goofed somehow.

This recipe turned out well for me.  I used 1 lb frozen strawberries for the glaze part, and 1 lb fresh strawberries for the pie.  Frozen strawberries dissolve by themselves when cooked, so no pesky mashing.  I reduced the sugar to less than 1/2 cup, and it was plenty sweet.  I also added lemon juice for tart.
My only mistake came with the cornstarch--I was lazy and didn't continue cooking the glaze after adding the cornstarch.  Big mistake!  It caused a serious texture problem with the glaze, it felt almost powdery in the mouth because the cornstarch was not fully dissolved.  Don't skimp on cooking!
I used the Big Guy Strawberry Pie crust.  I whipped 8 oz of reduced fat cream cheese with 1 tsp vanilla and spread it in the crust.  Yum.  I cut the tops off the strawberries and put them top-down into the cream cheese.  Next time I'll cut the strawberries into chunks--with the opaque glaze the pie just looked lumpy.

This is an INCREDIBLE pie.  I'm not much of a baker and this was my first strawberry pie.  It turned out wonderful.  I also used the pie crust from the Big Guy Strawberry Pie recipe and it was soooooo good. The only problem I have with this recipe is that I'm going to eat the entire pie by myself.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

This was absolutely excellent, and I am not a fan of strawberry pie.  The texture was perfect, and the filling was cooked just right to bring out the sweet/tart taste of the strawberries.  Maybe next time will mix different berries together.  Thanks for the recipe:)

This was the most incredible tasting pie!  I made the Big Guy Strawberry Pie crust (which is an easy shortbread crust) to go with it and it was a fantastic combination.  I'm making it again for July 4th!  Yummy!

Very Yummy!!  I used strawberries fresh from the farm and this made a great pie.  It allowed for the true taste of the berries to come through.  I used a Philsbery (sp?) pie crust and it was so quick.  I will put this in my permanant collection!!  Oh, I also used more strawberries than it called for but I like the pies overflowing!!

This was probably the best strawberry pie I have ever had! It was absolutely amazing! It didn't use store bought jello or gelatin, just real strawberries. I chose to chop up some extra strawberries (about 1/2 cup) and placed those on top in a circular design. Really enjoyed the recipe

This was the first time i ever did a pie and it turned out great! I agree with everyone else that you should go less with the sugar. I put less sugar than the recipe called for and it turned out just perfect as far as sweetness. My hubby was so impressed!

I am lazy but have so many compliments on my strawberry or blueberry pies.just use the glaze in Publix good or homemade crust. I either put fresh whip cream on the top of each piece and \or softened cream cheese spread on the bottom of the cooled crust before filling. Then chill for an hour or so.  Not actually healthy but sooooo good!

I loved this recipe. For  the cooked strawberries, I use an immersion blender and then stir the filling. Chill it for  as long as you have time to. I gave this to my great grandmother for her birthday.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and really delicious. The only change I made was to paint the bottom of the pie shell with some melted chocolate, as another reviewer suggested. I must say that I didn't like the taste of the chocolate with the strawberries and that's saying something, as I am a real chocoholic. I will try painting the base with a little egg yolk next time. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This is very YUM!  I have to say next time I make this I will have to cut down the sugar a little and add more strawberries to fill my pie crust better.  Thank you for sharing!!!

I made this strawberry pie with the same instructions except I added 1/2 cup of water instead of 3/4. But like other users have said It was too sweet (I am one of those people who enjoy extra sweet deserts usually, but this was too sweet even for me). Next time I will try it with 3/4 cup of sugar instead. Thanks for users who suggested to keep 3/4 of strawberries unmeshed instead of 1/2 as the recipe has suggested. Whip cream's taste sort of vanished with the strawberries. I am not putting it in good next time. It came out perfect!

Near perfect as written..but I added a couple tbs lemon juice to give it a slight ruhbarb-like sourness and a tiny bit more corn starch...then I piped on some fancy whipped cream till it was covered. My family of 9 loved it, xhose it over birthday cake.
This is a million times better than using that strawberry glaze-in-a tub, whixh tastes like syrofoam.
Thhis was soooo easy.

This was amazing. I noticed that some people said they had strawberry soup, I think it is because they either didn't put enough cornstarch in the mix or didn't let it boil for ten minutes. The stirring is a little rough after that long but after sitting in the fridge for about 2 hours it set and was very tasteful. My kids loved it and my husband loved it and he doesn't really like strawberries.

I followed the directions to a T the first time I made this and it was horribly runny, even after chilling overnight. It never did set. It still tasted so good; I was determined to make it again and make it right. On the second attempt, I completely omitted the water. I just added the cornstarch to the mashed strawberries while they were on the stove. It turned out perfectly when done that way. The consistency was spot on. Without the unnecessary water ingredient, I would rate this a 5 star recipe.

I have never posted a review before, but had to weigh in on this pie. I made the recipe as written (only change was I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup) and it was the most delicious pie I ever made! It set well after 2 hours in the fridge and was perfectly light and sweet. I made it as a surprise for my boyfriend, who is a passionate strawberry fan, and he raved about it like I'd never seen him rave before. I will be sure to make this pie again for any picnics or cookouts we are invited to for the rest of the summer.

I modified this recipe to make it a simple low sugar recipe
In a separate bowl I mixed 1 c of Splenda, 3-4 Tblsp of corn starch, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Blended together pour mix over fresh strawberries sliced in half. Pour into the pie crust.  Add either a full crust or lattice cover.  Delish!  It is definitely a fresh fruit pie - no gel.  We loved it!

Very easy. Like others, I used 1.5 times the amount of berries called for overall, and used less in the cooked portion (but plan to try the original amount in next batch of pies). I also reduced the sugar content just a smidge as well. Was inspired by another recipe to stir in a bit of cinnamon and vanilla just before pouring into the crust. Made 4 last night in under an hour.

It didn't set in the fridge and was far too sweet. It ended up kind of being like a strawberry soup with a shell. I would try a different recipe next time.

This recipe is a keeper!!!  I did what "Misty and the bunnies" did as well. I threw the adjusted (1/2 cup) water and (3/4 cup) sugar amounts that she described in together with the 3 tbls. cornstarch and 1/3 mashed strawberries, stirred constantly, brought to a boil for about 2 to 3 minutes, cooled for a couple minutes, topped the pie that was filled with the other 2/3 whole strawberries, refrigerated for an hour, and it set perfectly!  We added the freshly whipped cream to our own pieces, so that we only had as much as we wanted.  The only difference is that I used a 32 ounce package of strawberries instead of a quart, and it came out fantastic!!! I've never been a strawberry pie fan before, but I sure am now! Husband said that the recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Good recipe!  I made a few modifications based on my mother's strawberry pie recipe and tips from other reviewers.  I mashed half the berries and sliced the other half in half.  I mixed the mashed berries in with 1/2 C of water.  I mixed 3 T of cornstarch, a pinch of salt and 1 C of sugar and added it to the strawberry/water mixture and brought it to a boil for about 2 mins until thickened.  I then added 2 drops of red food coloring, 1 T of butter and 3/4 T of lemon juice.  I let the mixture cool slightly and mixed in the remaining halved berries.  I poured it into a baked pie shell and refrigerated for several hours.  Served topped with whipped cream.  Delish!

[7/4/12] Used just shy of 3lbs of strawberries.  Used 1/4 for mashing and 3/4 whole strawberries.  Used 1/2 water and close to 1 cup sugar.  Quite sweet.  Would probably reduce sugar next time.

I thought it tasted pretty good, but I made some adjustments that may have made things not as good as it could have been.  It is worth making again and reading notes first.

This was my 1st time making strawberry pie. My husband loves it, so I thought I would give it a try. I made this using the Butter Flaky Pie Crust on this site and it was a great and easy to make pie! I managed to impress not only my husband, but myself as well!

Pretty good. Instead of a traditional pie crust, I used a graham cracker crust and like one person suggested, I painted the inside of the crust with melted chocolate and let that set in the fridge before I filled it. It was a little bitter for me that way, because I like my chocolate to be really sweet and semi-sweet just doesn't cut it for me, but I imagine white chocolate would be delicious.

Everyone loved this, but it is a tad on the overly sweet side.  Next time I'll cut down on the sugar for sure.  The only complaint that I heard was that the crust was too thin.  I used a premade crust though so next time I'll either make my own thick crust or do a double crust on the bottom.  Definitely make this the day ahead if you want it to set properly.

Excellent pie.  Immediate family favorite.  I did use another reviewers suggestion and "painted" the cooked crust with melted chocolate.  It was just the right touch!!

Delicious!  My only (slight) complaint is that the water seeped out of the berries the next day so I am going to try painting the crust with chocolate as another reviewer suggested.  I love that this is so easy to make, and does not require my oven to be on for very long!

Very tasty and easy to make. *Almost* too sweet so I might try cutting back on the sugar a bit, or maybe adding a bit of lemon juice to balance the sugar. Thank you for sharing!

Easy to make, delicious to eat.  My 8.5 year old twins helped me make this and we used the other pie crsut to cut out shapes like in one of the pictures.  Made homemade whipped cream to top it off.  YUM!  Going to try it with blueberries next.

It wasn't the finest specimen of a strawberry pie. I should have kept more berries whole--that might have helped with my main complaint: too much cornstarchy, gelatinous filling and not enough strawberries.

The first time I made this it turned out perfectly delicious.  The 2nd time I followed the "cheaters" and their modifications.  It did not turn out as well although it was still good.  Don't mess with perfection!  It's awesome just as it was submitted.

Maybe my pie plate was too big, but I didn't have enough filling. Also my filling remained liquid-y so I must have done something wrong. But it tasted wonderful!

This is a FABULOUS recipe.  The amount of sugar you need depends on how sweet your strawberries are.  Mine were pretty sweet, so I cut the water to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup.   I also pureed the strawberries for the binder rather than mash them, and found that to be very helpful for the consistency I wanted.  I took it to a Memorial Day cookout, and it was the only dessert anyone wanted!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

wow, this was fantastic.  I normally don't like strawberries from the grocery store but they were on sale and this recipe made them delicious.  I even thought the crust wasn't really needed.  Next time i'll make individual cups without the crust.  After making this pie a few times i've found it crucial to determine how sweet the strawberries you have are.  one time my pie was way too tar another time it was a bit sweet.  Taste your strawberries and adjust the sugar accordingly!!!

Good recipe! I followed Misty's directions and added everything to a cold pan and cooked it for 3 minutes. I cooled the strawberry filling before adding it to the crust, but my crust still ended up soggy. I think this would be better with fresh local strawberries than the store bought ones I used.

This pie is delicious - my friends and family gobbled it up. However, i think you need more strawberries. I used 1.5 quarts of large strawberries and was sadly disappointed by how empty my pie crust looked. Next time I will prep 3 quarts per pie. Who doesn't want a heaping strawberry pie?!

I have been making this recipe for 25 years and it's always a hit!  However, my recipe called for a little softened or whipped cream cheese on the crust before adding the strawberry mixture.  This helped with the soggy issue as well as helping to cut the sweetness.

Delicious! After reading the reviews I made a couple of minor changes. I mashed one cup of berries with 3/4 cup of sugar. After cooking with the cornstarch and water until nice and thick, I added a couple drops or red food color to give it a beautiful, vibrant color. I gently folded the cooked berries with the remaining 3 cups of berries and poured it in the shell. After cooling several hours and topping with whipped cream it was perfect. It couldn't have been easier or more delicious. Thank you!

What a great pie!  I was really hoping to find one that didn't involve a jello packet, and this is it!  It's a little more labor intensive to make, but the flavor is pure strawberry.  My husband gave it two thumbs up as well!

Followed some suggestions from the other reviewers... bit less sugar and used ginger ale in place of the water.  It turned out great but i think when I make it again, if I use ginger ale I will cut back the sugar even a bit more.  I also added a bit of lemon juice - seemed to work out.  Anyway, it is a great recipe and will def use it many more times.

I would have given this five stars except the middle of the pie never set.  The top was firm, but once it was sliced the filling spread everywhere.  I cooked the mashed strawberries for 15 minutes even though the mixture thickened up almost as soon as the pan went on the burner.  I also left the pie in the refrigerator for more than 24 hours, so it had more than enough time to fully set.   It was still delicious and I'll definitely make this again, but it won't be something that I'll make to set out in front of company because it didn't hold shape when served.

This was an excellent pie. The ones who say it was runny- you probably need to cook the strawberries with the sugar, cornstarch, and water a little longer until thick and constantly stirring it. We had company and made this for the first time for them and said it was the best strawberry pie they had. It wasnt too sweet. I sliced all of my strawberried and layered them in the pie shell. Also remeber to brown the pie shell. It makes a stronger pie shell and serve within two days of making it. Very good !

I got rave reviews. Of course the flavor is all contingent on the quality of strawberries. I also added some lime juice to the strawberries to perk up the flavor.

Have made this pie twice in the past week. Followed all of Misty and the bunnies suggestions and used only 1/4 of the strawberries for the sauce and reduced the sugar and water. The first pie I followed her recommendation and boiled the mixture for 2-3 minutes and it ended up a little too runny in the end. The second time I made this I let it boil for a bit longer and turned out perfect.

I mashed up half the strawberries and put all of the ingredients in a pot.  I just cooked it all together for about 10 minutes and poured it into a pie shell and it set quite nicely.  I've made it a few times now.  It's a hit at this house!

I like the taste of this pie and adding the pure whipped cream is a nice touch. Real whipped cream (instead of some canned or tub version) is such an improvement. The whipped cream doesn't need added sugar b/c the pie is very sweet on it's own. My only complaint is that I have made this pie twice and chilled several hours like the recipe recommends, but it doesn't 'set' for me. When I take it out of the fridge, it appears set, but as soon as I cut into it, it runs all over. I think I will do as one of the recent reviewers said to avoid this problem in the future and see if that helps.

Followed the recipe as written...except I used some suggestions from others and melted 2 Hershey's chocolate bars and spread on the bottom and then added a layer of sliced almonds before adding the strawberries and the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is by far the best strawberry pie recipe that I have ever used.  This consistency of the filling was the one that I had been looking for! I didn't want to make my pie with Jello because it makes the pie to ... Jello-like. The one thing that I did differently was when I got finished making the filling I put it in my blender to make it really smooth. My pie was like the pies that I use to buy!  If I ever met OKBEE in person I would give you a hug for this one! Thanks for making my life easier!

This was really good. I had some cream cheese that I needed to use up so I let it soften, added a little confectioner's sugar and lined the pie crusts with it ( I made two pies so I split it between the two). I then followed the recipe. The only other variation was cooking the strawberry/sugar/corn starch mix for only about 3 minutes. It started to thicken pretty quickly and 10 minutes would have been jam. It was very popular with the whole group.

I thought this pie was quite good. HOWEVER. . .the filling only needed to be cooked for 2-3 minutes, not a full 10. I also added vanilla to my second one which made the flavor much deeper. I will be using this recipe from now on.

I used "Shorbread Crust" from this site and then followed this recipe as stated except for these following changes: I used 4 cups strawberries total. 1 cup uncooked on the base and 3 cups as part of the sauce mixture. I didnt have 1 cup granulated sugar so I used 2 cups powdered sugar instead (which maybe helped better solidify the sauce since powdered sugar is more thick and pasty when mixed w/ liquid.) Instead of 3/4 c water I used 3/4 c grape juce (I personality just like lots of flavor). And then just to note, 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch is perfect. This was so good Usually I make "Strawberry Glazed Pie" but didnt have jello so made this one instead and I'm glad I did. Both are super good though.

Wonderful and yummy pie!  I don't care for the "gel" to overwhelm the fresh berries, so I used two pounds of strawberries for one pie. I took the advice of several others and only mashed 1/4 of the strawberries.  I also cut the sugar and water down to 2/3 cup each. It was sweet enough for us! I tossed the fresh strawberries with the cooked mixture before putting them in the pie plate so everything got covered.  I used a graham cracker crust which was a great alternative to a traditional pie crust.  Enjoy!

This was fantastic.  I added a little less sugar (my berries were a bit on the sweet side, and I was already using a sweet crust), about 2/3 cup, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  After boiling the sugar mixture for about ten minutes -- enough time to prep the berries and snack on a few! -- I poured it into the bowl of berries and mixed everything together.  Some of the photos of this recipe showed an unappetizing puddle of goo on top of the berries in the pie, and I didn't want that effect; I also wanted to make sure that all of the berries were coated in the fantastic glaze.  After mixing, I just poured everything into the pie shell, covered in plastic wrap, and refrigerated overnight.  Perfect!  This was the favorite of Easter brunch, with everyone raving.  I barely got a slice for myself, and I have to agree: awesome!

Made this last night and it came out perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I brushed the crust with chocolate as another reviewer suggested. The chocolate added a nice richness and kept the crust from getting soggy. My whole family loved this, and my son said it was the best pie he'd had in his whole life--and the kid has had a lot of pie!

This pie was really good and easy to make.  I took the suggestion of adding less sugar depending on how sweet the berries were.  It came out perfect.  I will be making this again.  Also, it is healthier then most other pies.

Easy to make, tastes great!! Would make it again! *Hint* I added 1 (almost 1.5) tsp of Cinnamon to the liquid mix. Gave it a great warm flavor, really compliments some fine berries.

I made a 10" pie with 4 1/2 cups of strawberries and there was only just enough glaze.  I used 3/4c sugar and added 2 Tbl of lemon juice but the result was still *very* sweet.  I also added 1Tbl of strawberry jello but the glze didn't set - the filling was still quite runny.    But the result was still very delicious.

My family was disappointed with this pie. My husband thought there were too few strawberries and too much glaze. I used 2 pounds of strawberries - one for the whole strawberries and one for the glaze. If I did it again, I would half the recipe for the glaze and use the rest of the strawberries whole.

Wonderful recipe - you've gotta try it! I didn't have enough strawberries to make the whole pie, but really wanted to make this so I halfed the recipe and made strawberry tarts instead. Other than that change, I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't too sweet at all for me (my strawberries were fairly tart though). In all, it made 8 tarts. To make the tarts, I simply cut out 5" circles from one pie crust (had to put scraps together and roll out for a couple of them). I then shaped them over the back of a muffin tin and pinched the sides all around to make them fluted. Just before serving, I used canned whipping cream to make perfect looking whipped swirls and put a piece of strawberry on top. They were a huge hit and everyone loved them.  I think I will continue to make the tarts over the pie as they are so pretty and make a beautiful presentation. Also, you don't have to worry about if it doesn't set exactly or being messy when served on a plate.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will be making this over and over again - especially for company.

Delicious! The whole family loved it.  I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 c.  It does thicken really fast so I did not cook it near 10 min.  Chilled about 5 hours.

I made this pie for Christmas dinner, and it was absolutely scrumptious. With the 4 of us, the whole thing was gone; after seconds of course. I used 1 qt of fresh strawberries for the bottom of the pie. Only to find out, I didn't have enough strawberries to puree for the sauce mixture. I ended up going to the store late at night, and of course, they were out of fresh strawberries. So, I bought one bag of frozen whole strawberries (not in syrup) and thawed them in the microwave for the sauce. Turned out perfect. I pureed them in my chopper, and continued with the recipe. It actually gave the pie a much deeper red color. Obviously, would make again!

Great recipe! This pie really uses the natural flavor of the berries and the quality of the berries seems to be key to its success. It's just a smidge too sweet for my taste, but I think thats just me, cuz everyone who eats it says its perfect. I've also done a strawberry/blueberry combo this way subbing half the strawberries for blueberries and that came out excellent!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the pie came out very well.  It was not as pretty as the pie made with fruit gelatin, but I think it was nicer and seemed more homemade than Jell-o in a pie crust.  I think next time I would add just a little less sugar and I would crush fewer of the berries in the sauce.  I didn't really notice the whole berries because there were so many crushed ones hiding them.  This is my new fresh strawberry pie recipe!  Thanks!

It didn't set! I wouldn't want to add more cornstarch though because it would be too much... maybe I did something wrong. It tasted good, and I ate it anyway, but I was dissapointed

This was not the strawberry pie I was looking for. The glaze is like strawberry jelly poured over the berries. In fact, my husband asked me if that is what I did. I told him it was a homemade glaze and he said he couldn't tell the difference. Me either. Also, it was very sweet. Just not what I was expecting so I will keep looking for a better recipe.

What a great idea for a pie!  I used frozen huckleberries, strawberries and raspberries leftover from this summer, and made a "jumbleberry pie."  I did not put any fresh berries in the bottom of the crust (I used a graham cracker crust).  Instead, I just cooked all the berries with the cornstarch.  You will probably have to add more cornstarch if you are using frozen berries, because there is more water with them.  After the berries were thickened and bubbly, I removed the pan from heat and let it sit for about 15 minutes to cool down.  Then I added about 5 tbps. of raspberry jello and poured the filling into the crust.  I let it refrigerate over night, then topped it with a thin layer of whipped cream.  It turned out so good!  I think adding the jello was key in making sure the pie set up right and sliced nicely.  It also helped give it a nice, deep color.

Very good pie.  I cut the sugar slightly and it was just the right sweetness.  Used the recipe for French Pastry Pie Crust which is very
tender and flaky.  I would recommend cutting the berries, as using them whole makes the pie very hard to cut and makes messy looking servings.
Also recommend using 4 T. of cornstarch.

Made this today and found it very tasty. I also incorporated blueberries and raspberries because I had some in the house and was running a little low on strawberries. It was really good - the raspberries made it a little tart which was also nice. So easy and fast! I also added a little milk when bringing berries to a boil for a creamier texture - don't know if it made much of a difference. Used the xtra cornstarch - came out with a good thick substance.

This recipe is great in a graham cracker crust.  (I used a whole wheat one with non-hydrogenated fats.) The key to having it set up is to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  Time and patience here.  If you simmer it for the 10 minutes, it will set up.

Such an easy pie to make. In fact it is the best strawberry pie I have ever tasted. I used an egg slicer to slice my berries. Store bought berries sometimes are not as ripe as they should be. Hard to mash but very easy to slice. I also used a graham cracker crust & mixed cream cheese with powdered sugar. Put a layer on that mixture on the bottom of the crust before I added the berries. I have made it twice in 10 days.

This recipe is one of my top 10 favorites. I make it about 5 times a year. I made it for my sister and she asked for the recipe and made it herself today. She used frozen strawberries, since fresh ones aren't quite in season yet, and she said it turned out great! This is an easy, wonderful recipe! Thanks!

As other users have said, this pie didn't quite gel the way I wanted it too - and I used 4T. corn-starch instead of three and let it "set" overnight.  Next time around I'll be using either more cornstarch or trying the strawberry or plain knox jello to try to thicken it up a bit.  I'm not a huge fan of that red strawberry glaze stuff at the stores, so I'm bound and determined to find a way to make this pie work.  As far as taste goes, it was wonderful, but my presentation really ended up looking more like strawberry mush.  I was a little bummed out about that since I used this pie for company.

The pie tasted good but the glaze was a little runny and it was way too sweet and I have a sweet tooth and it was way too sweet for me.It could've been way too sweet because I used a graham cracker crust.If you're going to use a graham cracker crust I suggest you decrease the amount of sugar in the glaze to 1/3 cup.I used 4tablespoons of cornstarch like everybody said in the reviews but my mixture was still a little too runny. This kind of pie tastes best with a graham cracker crust instead of a regular crust. I tried it with a regular crust and it wasn't as good. If you want to make a homemade graham cracker crust you'll need 1 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs,1/8 cup sugar and 2tablespoons melted butter.Mix everything together and press against pie dish. Put in freezer for 10 minutes.

This recipe is so good and so easy I can't believe it!!!  I have never made any type of pie before, but I can honestly say this will become a staple at our house.  I agree with the other reviewers that you need to use 4 tbsp of cornstarch and you need stir for the full 10 minutes.  I followed their directions and my pie turn out PERFECT!

What an easy pie to make! My strawberries were a bit tart, so I had no problem with an overly sweet pie. No need to arrange the strawberries as the glaze covers everything up, just pile them in! I added more strawberries and refrigerated it overnight,& it jelled fine. Refreshing and delicious!

I'm a 21 y.o. guy, and NOBODY expected me to produce something so delicious on short notice!  I don't want anyone to know how easy and delicious this recipe is!!  It worked fine for me, but I would consider cutting some of the sugar out next time...also, maybe adding some almonds?

Very yummy.  I added some extra strawberries and a little lemon juice.  I still thought it was a little too sweet, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. But, I'll definately make it again.

I have never made a strawberry pie or any fruit pie before.  This one was so easy and so tasty! I will definately be making it over and over again.  I cut my strawberries into quarters when I put them into the baked pie shell and I did add a little lemon juice to the strawberries that I was cooking.

I have made several strawberry pies, and this one was by far the best.  I tried this recipe, because I didn't have any Strawberry gelatin, which is what is in most strawberry pies.  My family loved it.  We ate an entire (12-inch) pie at one sitting!

This is the first cold fruit pie I have ever made and found it to be quite simple and tasty.  I did find it a bit too sweet, and will try the suggestion of adding a little lemon juice.

I have been using a very similar recipe and I have to say that this is the best kind of strawberry pie.  Forget baking and mixing together countless ingredients.  Whip this up and add some whipped cream and It's amazing!  If you like strawberries you will love this pie!!!

This is a great recipe.  Gone at one sitting.  I added lemon juice to taste (about 1 tablespoon) to cut the sweetness.  Pie was great!

I was able to use frozen strawberries for the mashed part! And only one pot, no bowl. Turned out fabulous. We were overrun with strawberries in the summer, so I mashed 2 cups and put it in a bag in the freezer. Now, in the middle of winter, I only have to pay for one pint of strawberries to cut up. I defrosted the mashed strawberries by putting the bag in cool water, then dumped it in a medium pot with the mixed cornstarch/water/sugar. Oh, I only used 1/2c water and 3/4c sugar because watery and overwhelming otherwise.  Boiled until thick.  Let cool in pot for 10-15 min while cut up the new strawberries. Stirred cut strawberries into pot, poured into crust and done. One pot. Simple. So tasty!

Simple and easy recipe, that turned out delicious. I'd been wanting to make a strawberry pie for a long time-and this didn't disappoint. I did decrease sugar and water like other reviewers suggested.

When I made this, I added some sugar to the filling. The strawberry  filling was perfect but the crust I used was terrible and ruined the pie. I added some sugar over the pie after it cooked and it tasted much better. However, I recommend using a pie crust that is made from scratch and has to be rolled and chilled. It's worth it.

I made this using the changes offered by the reviewer name "Misty."  She said to smash 1/4 of the strawberries, and cut the sugar down to 3/4 C.  She also suggested cooking the hot mixture for only 3 minutes, after boiling starts, instead of the 10-minutes in the original recipe.   It was delicious! I even submitted a photo.  I gave it 4/5 stars because I had to make the changes

Great recipe and texture. My only recommendation is, if you want your pie to look like the one pictured, you'll need to do a flat layer of strawberries on the bottom before you arrange the decorative later. If you don't do a bottom layer first, your prettily arranged strawberries will get covered.

Too many time, people change a recipe then rate how it comes out with their changes. I used grocery store berries which were not the best quality and it came out great. The 2nd time I made it, my berries were sweeter so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Again excellent.    A simple recipe, basic Strawberry pie, done well. Just adjust the sugar to the quality of  of the strawberries to keep it from getting too sweet.

I saw this recipe first in the June/July/August 2015 issue of Allrecipes magazine.  This is the easiest pie recipe you will ever make!  So delicious too, a real crowd pleaser. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar because the first time I made the recipe I thought it was a bit too sweet. Plus, I swapped a pastry pie shell for a pre made graham cracker pie shell. Worked great.  Put whipped cream on slices after they were cut.  That way if you have leftover pie there's no soggy cream sitting on top.  But I doubt you'll have any leftover pie!

Delicious and entire family loved it!  Only used 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet. Made too much filling to fit in pie shell and the extra filling also made great strawberry milkshakes.

I am from NJ and use this recipe too. It's the best!  For those with thickening problems: it shouldn't be pink, so you may not be cooking it long enough.  Near the end of cooking it should turn a deep, glossy red like jelly. That is when you know the starch has set properly.  Also, I do like to add vanilla extract and a tb of butter when I take it off the heat.  The vanilla complements the flavor nicely.

I saw this in the All Recipes Magazine.  It is strawberry season right now in Ontario and my husband is not a big fan of strawberry rhubarb pie so I thought I would give it a try.  It came with a one pie crust recipe.  I made it exactly as written except some Chambrod accidently splashed in it.  I served it with the July 2015 issue of Chatelaine's recipe for vanilla ice cream.  I'm now the best wife ever.  I believe the comment was this is truly the best pie I've ever eaten.  It's amazing to watch a man and his 17 year old son devour a complete pie ....in one sitting!

This is why I LOVE allercipes.com: YOU! You gave me pictures and suggestions that helped me create a LOVELY pie! I used a little more than 2 one-pound containers of berries. Brushed a layer of ganache on the interior crust. (Handful of chocolate chips, dash of cream, pat of butter.) Started with one layer of sliced berries, added the mash (which I allowed to cool,) then added another layer of berries. Several home cooks arranged the berries very neatly on top. I liked the way that looks, so I did it, too! The whip cream is home-made. Added powdered sugar to stabilize and sweeten it. Garnished with mint, because it's a nice contrast to the red filling. This is a stunning pie, and it is the taste of summer! Five stars!

This has become my go-to recipe during strawberry season!  You may want to play around with it a bit -- as the recipe stands, is too sweet for my taste, and I have found 2/3 c sugar to be plenty.  I also add a thin layer of mini semi-sweet chocolate morsels on top of the baked pie crust before adding the strawberries -- delish!  People always rave about it!!

This was my first strawberry pie so I was looking for a simple recipe with out a lot of additives,I try to make all my pies as natural as possible. I was a little hesitant because it seemed so basic as compared to some others I had looked at but decided to give it a try. Well I see why it got 5 stars,it was delicious.The only thing I will change when I bake the next one is instead of putting whole berries onto the crust I will cut them in half,just a personal preference. PS: If you got a soupy filling you either left out the corn starch or didn't cook it long enough,mine gelded up perfect.

I use 3 pounds of strawberries for a deep dish pie. I use a full pound to make my strawberry slurry and add 1 pink package of sure gel to make sure I get a great consistency in the glaze and the pie sets up properly. .  Good recipe.

YUM! I LOOOOVE STRAWBERRY PIE AND THIS WAS GREAT! I had to make a crust by hand, which turned out okay - but the filling was the key character. Absolutely delicious! I plan on making this again when strawberries are in season

I used twice the berries and coated the crust in chocolate. My crust was medium flake with a combo butter/spectrum and really nice too. I stuck the berries into the cooling viscose chocolate, let cool, then added the filling. I also didn't need 10 min cooking time for the filling. Thanks for the recipe and to all who wrote about their experiences - especially the chocolate!!!!!!! You rock!!

I made this out of fresh strawberries from the garden and it turned out great and was a big hit for our family. but instead of putting it in a pie crust I tried put it in tart shells... they turned out perfect. I made a dozen by halving the recipe ( I cut strawberries into quarters before putting them in the tart shells). I'm also going to try freezing them next time I make them.

My husband absolutely loved this, and he's not a pie guy!  I coated the pie crust with chocolate so it wouldn't get as soggy. I highly recommend this, especially if you like chocolate covered strawberries.

I don't know what I did wrong but I followed this recipe exactly and it came out way too liquidy. I poured 2/3 of the strawberry mixture over the fresh strawberries and my pie was overflowing like crazy. I thought maybe if it sat in the refrigerator long enough it'd be soaked up or set up or something but it didn't. It was just a sloppy mess, a really delicious sloppy mess, but still a sloppy mess. I dumped the other 1/3 of the mixture which is a total waste of strawberries. I served this and those who weren't afraid to drip strawberry syrup all over themselves said that it was good. But, even though the taste was good, I doubt I'll make this recipe again. I'm sure I can find a better one.

The only change I made was to sub in Stevia/sugar blend in place of the sugar, 1/2 cup for the equivalent of 1 cup of sugar. The pie turned out wonderfully but even my kid thought it was too sweet. Will cut down the sweetener next time. Mine set up pretty firmly in about 90 minutes.

This recipe is wonderful... It was hard to just sit back and wait for it to set / firm up.  But it was well worth the wait! Highly recommend this for a delicious summer dessert.

Totally yummy! I agree that mashing 1/4 of the berries is the way to go.

Used the recipe pretty much as it. I doubled though, since I have 4 children and a fiance. :) I got a two pound package of strawberries. I bought two premade pie crusts. Baked those. I wrapped edges in foil first 10 min. Took foil off last two. Also had poked fork holes in crust so it would stay down. For the sauce. I used about 2 cups of strawberries. I used 6 tbspn of cornstarch. About 1 cup water. ( lowered that) and put it all in vitamix for a few minutes to make sure it was smooth. I thought about bringing to boil in vitamix, but instead switched to stove. Whisked till thick. Put in fridge to cool. Then I cut all of my strawberries in half. I picked the biggest prettiest for on top and put those aside. My others I sliced again. I then whipped cream cheese and put on the bottom of crust thinking it will help keep crust from getting soggy. Then layered strawberries and sauce. Made the remaining strawberries on top all pretty... and we're good to go! Easy quick and yummy.

The taste was just amazing. I made my own pie crust and added a few raspberries. It was a great way to salvage the berries before they went bad. I would try putting other berries in the mix! The heavy whipping cream just evens the sweetness. It's definitely my husband's favorite fruit pie now

This tasted great but I wish I would have modified the recipe per the reviews. I like to try recipes as is first. I made this exactly as the recipe says and it never thickened up for me. So I have a really yummy strawberry soup in a pie crust =)

I made this, with a few modifications thanks to other comments, and in one case, my own preferences.  Use ginger ale instead of water to make it a little sweeter.. and less sugar.  Mix everything together in a pan and bring to boil, instead of in two sections, just make sure to stir constantly!  I also added just a few semi-sweet chocolate chips to the pan to add just a little extra flavor, to match the chocolate pie crust I went with, instead of the traditional.  It came out awesome!

This recipe didn't work for me. My pie looked great, I put it in the fridge overnight and the next day it was soup! I was so embarrassed since I made it as a favor for a friend.

Fantastic start to a great chocolate strawberry pie.  Found that next time I will use 2 qts of berries, and double the cornstarch because I found that overnight the pie had leaked liquid. Enough to cover the 1/2 pie plate that was free of pie. Did BTEAMMOM's suggestion and covered baked crust with melted chocolate.  And mashed 1/4 of the berries like others suggested.  Others suggested slicing rest of berries. Half of those remaining berries went into the chocolate covered crust, then sprinkled chocolate chips over that, then poured 1/2 of the mixture over that.  Repeated the process, which was no big deal as the strawberries were already sliced. Put in tooth picks and covered with plastic wrap and into the frig.  When set, put Cool Whip over all, and Wah-lah!  It was adored by 5 yr old granddaughter who, for the last 3 years, has insisted on a strawberry-chocolate pie for her overnighter with us!!

I made this exactly as recipe submitted. Made a shortbread type of crust which I baked and cooled. The filling was superb. Actually halved the recipe and made a 4" pie. Thanks for sharing!

Very good easy to put together recipe.  I too added some extra stawberries to the glaze portion, it was really tasty; a pleasant change from the artificial packaged glazes.  I also like the fact that one doesn't add red dye, that is just wrong.

I followed the recipe but accidentally used only 3 teaspoons of corn starch instead of 3 tablespoons as called for, and added a little lemon juice for more flavor. It worked out great. The glaze was a nice translucent red color. I tried to follow the exact recipe (3T corn starch) with added lemon the same as before but wound up with pink glaze. Think I will stick with the 3 teaspoons next time or try some suggestions of the other reviewers to get the nice rich red colored glaze.

Tastes good, a little on the sweet side, but more than that I wish it got firmer. Definitely easy and few ingredients, though.

I ended up with a ton of strawberries from the farmer's market after my 3 year-old sampled a strawberry and put the top back in the container (yuck!) after we had already bought a quart of strawberries. I came across this recipe when trying to find something to do with two quarts of strawberries.  The only ingredient we had to buy was the pie crust, and the recipe was so easy that my 3 year-old helped me out in the kitchen.  After reading the reviews, we also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, which worked perfectly.  I highly recommend this recipe, especially now during farmer's market season when strawberries are abundant.  Thanks for posting!

This is soooo delicious, I'm obsessed with it - it's so easy to make! Eased up on the sugar quite a bit - to about 3/8 of a cup, and used half a cup of water as others suggested.

Made this for my mother-in-law's birthday.  First strawberry pie I've ever made or eaten, but it was a BIG hit.  I love finding a recipe that such a hit on the first try.  It was so good we had to make another whole pie and it turned out just as good!

Taking a cue from others who had added a layer chocolate to the crust before filling it with berries, I cut the sugar to 3/4 cp and lined the crust with some dulce de leche I had left over from a mixed berry pie.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

I didnt really enjoy the gelatinous aspect of this recipe and I used double the strawberries and kept some of them halved (I was going for a Marie Callendars Fresh Strawberry pie look) see my pic!  Also this pie really only seemed to keep for 1-2 days before the berries got too juicy and the gelatinous stuff started to turn an opaque purple color....icky  But it tasted great the very first day.  Overall I doubt I will use this recipe again, maybe just a simple syrup glaze over the berries next time.

Cleaned out the freezer and came across strawberries I had cut and froze in the summer. Thought I would try this pie and pitch it if it didn't turn out. Well, it was amazing! Followed the recipe except cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and poured it into a chocolate cookie shell. I expected to wait until tomorrow for it to set, but after dinner (about 1 1/2 hr. in fridge)it was perfect. Can't wait to experiment with different shells and also try the melted chocolate idea! I would give it more stars if I could!

SO YUMMY!! I did read the previous reviews so I made a few changes. I used a graham cracker crust which I put a thin layer of melted chocolate on (to keep it from getting soggy). I also used only 1/2 cup of water and about 3/4 cup of sugar. It was amazing! the whole family loved it!

Great recipe!  I used a suggestion by someone else and brushed the inside with chocolate before filling, and it was absolutely perfect!

This was absolutely delicious!! A huge hit with everyone that had a slice :) I followed the recommendations of 3/4 unmashed & a 1/4 mashed, as well as 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the full cup. Will be making this again, & i plan on using this for peach pie as well :) thanks so much for sharing!!

This was fabulous. I've made two batches and the only thing I had trouble with was needing to add a bit more cornstarch as I was stirring the mix on the stove. I mixed the cornstarch with a bit of water and just drizzled it in as I stirred until I was happy with it. Took an extra ten minutes or so. No biggie since it still tasted yummy and I got a great consistency afterwards.

This recipe is awesome! It tasted fresh, not liked some of the cooked recipes for fruit pies. I followed the recipe except: I probably used more strawberries than a quart. The sauce thickened quickly and there was no need to cook for 10 minutes. As soon as it thickened, I took it off the heat and let it cool a little bit. After that just pour over the strawberries in the pie shell and refrigerate. I did notice it needed a lot of chill time. (I made it the day before). Use nice fresh strawberries from your farmer's market if possible. That makes all the difference! Enjoy!

I loved this so much I made tonight for the second time this week.  I used more strawberries than called for.  My strawberries were large s I sliced them in half before putting in the pie crust.  For the sauce, I used 2 cups of chopped strawberries, 3T of cornstarch, and 2/3 C of water.

An immediate family favorite.  I read through the reviews and made the following modifications that others suggested and it turned out awesome! I bought a pre-made crust and painted it with 2 oz semi-sweet chips melted in microwave for about 1 min (I also added dark chocolate chips because I love dk choc) and put it in the fridge to set.  I used 4 cps strawberries, mashing about 1 1/2 cps.  I followed the recipe except used 3/4 cp sugar and only boiled it for 2 minutes.  I served it with cool whip and vanilla ice cream.

I am using this filling to go along with the recipe I had MANY yrs. ago and lost. A cooked pie crust, Make meringue and spread in the cooled crust, cook about 5 mins. in the oven, let cool and add cooled straberry filling. Just before serving decorate with whipped cream . It is so beautiful and so good!

best strawberry pie I ever made.  Tweaked recipe a bit but it came out great.   Cut sugar to 1/2 cup and used unrefined brown sugar, added pinch of salt and  about 4 Tbsp amaretto to cooked mash.  Got great fresh strawberries from roadside stand.  Cut to 2 TBSP cornstarch to make mash a bit more loose.   Crus tnever got soggy because entire pie was eaten fast fast fast...,.,   I plan to make it again and try a cookie or graham cracker crust....

This taste of the pie was okay, but it did not set up very well. By the next day, the last two pieces were spread throughout the entire pie pan. I even added a touch more corn starch, and a little less water when making it. I don't think I would use this recipe again.

This is a delicious pie.  After the cornstarch/water mixture was added to the filling, I turned the heat down to simmer, mine didn't take the full 10 minutes to thicken.  I used a little less sugar because the strawberries are at their peak and nice and sweet.  I added a little red food coloring to the cooked filling before pouring it into the pie shell to make it extra appealing, purely personal preference!  I'll decorate with a few baked pastry star or heart cutouts before serving next time.  This was my dad's favorite pie from childhood and it makes him SO happy!

I love this recipe and make it a lot during strawberry season! Everyone always talks about how wonderful it is, and I have given out the recipe too many times to count.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I love how easy it is, and how it doesn't require a lot of ingredients.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe as it stands..I do love a good strawberry pie.mmm...

However I offer as another finishing touch.. from our old church cookbook, the addition of creamcheese on the bottom..spread onto the baked crust before filling... and returned to the fridge  to set.. It's really very nice,.

I will try the chocolate on the piecrust one day soon, too... OOhh ny gosh!

This was the most delicious, easy pie I've ever made!  My kids just gobbled it up - faster than any other dessert I make.  And it was SO easy.  I managed to make it after the kids got out of school, while helping them with homework, and in enough time to make it to the ballfield for my son's baseball game!  I will definitely be making it again!

Wow this is too easy  & tasty to be true.  I made slight changes based on reviews.  Halved 3/4 of the strawberries and chopped up remainder.  Only used 3/4 cup of sugar & 1/2 water.  I think this could work even if the strawberries aren't perfectly sweet.  This will made many times this summer.

At first I was a little concerned because I mashed the strawberries by hand and came out with a much thicker, chunky type glaze. But by morning it had set PERFECTLY and tasted amazing! The slightly chunky sauce actually did wonders for the pie! 
As per other reviews I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and water to 1/2 cup. It had just the perfect amount of "pie" sweetness. The fresh strawberries were still the prominent flavour! A 5 star recipe by far!

This pie was absolutely delicious, and so easy! I loved the mashed strawberries in the glaze, it's so much better than the clear glaze you get on other strawberry pies. I used the measurements in the recipe and had no problems, nor did I think it was too sweet, although the berries I used weren't very sweet, so that may have been why. I only boiled the cornstarch mixture for about 4-5 minutes, and it set up perfectly -- in only about an hour. I will definitely be making this again!

I have been using this reciepe for the past 3 years! It is such an amazing hit!! If you don't want to make the old school whip cream. The Reddi Whip is amazing! I also cut my berries in half instead of leaving them whole, to make it easier to cut. I also use a shortbread pie crust (amazing)!!!

I made this pie after finding the recipe because I didn't have jello to make my usual strawberry pie.  It was good, but not quite as tasty as my other recipe.  My children absolutely loved it, though, and even licked their plates clean to get the crumbs.  :)

Just not very good.  I reduced the amount of water and it still didn't set up properly.  The taste was so-so.  I ended up throwing it away.

I just made this pie and, perhaps because I was using super fresh, just picked this morning berries, the cooked berry mixture was really liquid-y and never set! Now I just have soggy pie crusts and several pies with standing water in them.

Quick, easy and excellent! We mostly followed the recipe. Alterations were reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup and we also threw the pie in the freezer for about an hour or two to chill so it could be eaten sooner. Delicious!

Very easy to make! Added a little lemon juice to the glaze just to ease the sweetness! Takes a long time to set but very good pie!

Very tasty. It was runny, but I think this was my fault. Regardless, all my guests loved it. I will definitely try this recipe again. I also think I may forget the crust next time and pour this over some pound cake with a little cream.

Very good, but you'll need more strawberries than it calls for.  I ended up with almost an entire quart in the dish, which meant I had about 1/2 cup of the syrup mixture leftover because it wouldn't all fit.

I've never made any kind of pie before but I had a million strawberries that I did not want to go bad. It was DELISH! & SO SO easy!!  The color wasn't red-red like you'd find at the store, but that was OK with me because I didn't want to add any artificial coloring.  I took the advice of another member & decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and also added a tablespoon of butter when the syrup was done.  I let it cool cool & poured it on the pie.  It sat in the fridge for about 6 hours & it was perfect after dinner. No soggy crust here. Thank you SO much!

To me, it kinda tasted like Jello, except ...not as good as Jello.  The cornstarch/jelly feel was just a little annoying... my sister felt the same, my mom thought it was okay.  I might try it again to experiment, and throw some cream in the jelly mixture as someone else mentioned, but not any time soon.  Slightly disappointed.

4 1/2 stars only bc it was a tad too sweet. Otherwise its soo good. Whip cream is a must, they just go so well. Great for fathers day. Its a keeper. Nxt time im going to try more fresh strawberrys than mashed and reduce the sugar a little. I can't wait for strawberry season, mmm. Thanx for the recipe!

Very good, I did the mashed strawberries in the blender and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Next time I think I will mix the whole strawberries with the mashed strawberries instead of just pouring over the top.

I was specifically looking for a recipe that did not use gelatin so I was happy to find this one! I had really big berries so I cut them in half, but everyone agreed it would be better to slice them in smaller pieces next time. Also, I thought I might puree the sauce mixture after cooking it as suggested by a couple of reviewers, but I found that cooking the mixture a little longer than the recipe states cooked down the chunky bits enough that I didn't need to puree it after all. One reviewer had said they'd put the whipping cream in the sauce for a creamier version, which sounded good to me so I tried that too, but I think it would be better without. Overall a great recipe and will definitely be making it again!

I did NOT have to do anything to this recipe!  I made it for my Belgian husband for his B-Day and he absolutely LOVED IT!!! He is not that fond of American food, but this was a winner with him and I.  I would recommend doing the recipe to the letter and not adjusting anything. If there are problems the first time around, then adjust the second time around.  :)

Just made it yesterday. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 of a cup. Used ready Graham Crust from the local store. The Crust was pretty sweet, which was the reason why i put so little sugar.  Still, the pie came out great.

Delicious! I made the recipe as is with a layer of white chocolate instant pudding on the bottom. The kids ate it up all in one day! Next day I made it with just the berries and pudding, no extras. Again, the kids loved it AND I got to cut out the extra sugar.

This is a fabulous pie. I purposely made one reviewer's mistake and added 1/2 of cream to the "mashed" portion. Yummy. This summer I hope to try it with other fruits. So simple and so good! This is a keeper in my home.

Used a Marie Calander frozen pie crust that I baked ahead.  Cut strawberries in half, but wish I would have sliced the larger berries.  It was more difficult to eat with huge chunks of strawberries.  Used almost 3 qts of berries, so the pie would be mounded high.  Used the full amount of sugar and water.  After mixing the liquid mixture, I let it cool, then mixed with all the berries.  That way there was the strawberry mixture in every bite.  Didn't have any issue with the pie setting.

Really fabulous! Since I had strawberry jam already made I used that instead of the simple syrup & while it worked pretty well, I didn't add the full amount of cornstarch so it didn't set up completely. That's alright. The beauty of this pie is the contrast between the sweetened glaze & the natural tartness of the fresh berries. Thanks so much for sharing. :o)

I was looking for a quick recipe that I could make before I went to work this morning.  I needed to use these strawberries before they went bad.  I came across this wonderful and easy recipe.  Wow, this is more than five stars.  It chilled all day while I was at work and my family enjoyed a special surpise. Thanks, this is a keeper!

This pie is awesome!! I used way more strawberries than called for I bought 2 quarts & used them all! Other than that I made exactly as the recipe was written. My hubby thought the top was a little too gelatin like but still said it was good! Great summer treat & it was delicious!

Great recipe and a great consistency... BUT you want to add three pounds of strawberries but leave the rest the same.

Great recipe.  I melt chocolate and "paint" it on the crust before putting in the strawberry filling.  My family gobbles this up.

Mine would not get firm. I think that I followed the recipe exact, but feel that I may need to try it again. Did taste good but was not presentable.

While it tasted delicious, my pie never set. I followed the recipe to the T, but the center was still runny, even after 24 hours in the fridge. Next time I am craving strawberry pie, I will just bake the crust on a cookie sheet, crumble it up, add the strawberry mixture (1/2 sliced strawberries, 1/2 mashed srawberries with added sugar), and top with whipped cream. The same way my Grandma makes a quick Strawberry Shortcake.

Very delicious. I changed the recipe and only used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water and using less mashed strawberries.

The first time we made this pie, it was really good, we have made it twice since and the filling is really runny but we are following the recipe to the letter. I wish I could figure out what happened!

First strawberry pie I've ever made. I definitely should have made this the day before, so it had time to set, but that was the only problem I had. The sauce thickened nicely. I did follow other reviews and didn't mash as many of the berries as called for. Also, I painted the crust with chocolate - the crust is still nice and crispy. Next time, though, I think I might add more sugar - it wasn't sweet enough for my taste, although others said it was perfect, since it wasn't too sweet. Also, I'll use more chocolate to paint the crust - it's hardly noticeable (I only used 2 oz of semi-sweet), and I think it would make a really nice complement. Made an excellent dairy-free dessert for my friend, though ^_^

I made this pie to use up fresh picked strawberries. I should have read more reviews, I would have learned not to mash half and leave half whole, there were far too few whole strawberries. I also could not for the life of me get the thing to set. It had an entire day to chill and was almost fully liquid. Next time I will use gelatin instead of corn starch and I won't mash nearly as many of the berries. That being said, the flavor was very good, but the over all "pie" did not work.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! I did make some changes based on other reviews. I painted chocolate on the bottom of the pie crust to prevent sogginess.  Used 3/4 of the strawberries in the actual pie and mashed the remaining strawberries.  I put all into a pot with 1/2 cup water and stirred constantly until boiling and thick...only a few minutes.  The pie solidified in about an hour.  Next time I would do less of the mash jelly filling.  But still an awesome and refreshing dessert!

AWESOME - AWESOME!!  I put 4oz of cream cheese at the bottom, next time I will use the entire 8oz block. It helped with the crust not getting soggy & it went extremely well with the strawberries. I used a frozen pie crust - just bake.  BEST STRAWBERRY PIE EVER!!

This pie didn't set up for me.  I agree with previous comments that it appears set, but when you cut into it, it runs all over.  The flavor is fantastic, but would have been 5 stars if it had set up.

I follow this recipe exactly and it ends up perfect every time.  Sometimes I will cut fun shapes out of the leftover dough I make and use them on top of the pie for presentation.  This is one of the most popular summertime desserts at my B&B and Tearoom.  Great when served with homemade almond whipped cream and a cup of tea or coffee.  I reccomend this recipe to everyone...thanks for sharing this gem!

Great recipe! My mom said it was perfect and looked like the cover of a magazine! I did use 2 cups smashed berries for the filling and the other 2 cups, I sliced the berries in half because I had huge berries. Will make again soon!

Super good. I trimed the tops of the berries off and left them whole and filled the pie nice and neat. Going to try and make this pie for the County Fair this year. I made not so sweet whipped cream to go with it only cause I thought the pie would be a sweeter contrast, and it was perfect. Will make again!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but in the end I found it to be REALLY sweet, and it never set up.  I took it to work to share with my coworkers, and I thought that 16 hours in the fridge would have caused it to set, but after removing a piece the rest of the filling just oozed into the vacant space.

Excellent!  I used just over two pounds of fresh strawberries and the majority of them went into the pie whole.  I mashed maybe a forth of the strawberries, added 3/4 cup sugar, and used the given amount of corn starch and water.  It took only 5 minutes to thicken on the lowest setting my burner has.  I let the mixure cool slightly before pooring it on the strawberries. It doesn't set too hard nor too runny, perfect.  It was still pretty sweet so I may bring it down another notch on the sugar.  Between 4 adults and 4 kids, the pie was completely eaten.  We loved it so much we'll make it again next weekend. Strawberry season is almost over, we want to enjoy it as much as possible.

This was my first attempt at a fruit pie with a roll-out dough.  I tried this because of the simplicity of it and it worked out wonderfully.  I did start with 1/2 cup of sugar and used 3/4 cup as opposed to the 1 cup in the recipe.  Adjust according to taste and the sweetness of the berries.  It didn't take the 10 minutes to get thick either- I may have left it on for about 5 minutes and it worked out perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper and have requests for the recipe already!  Thanks for sharing.

I followed some of the other users' ideas, cut the amount of cooked berries to 1/4, painted the pie crust with melted chocolate and did a mix of blueberries and strawberries.

Delicious and beautiful!!!

This recipe was really easy and tasted fabulous! My little addition was to use hazelnut flour (hazelnuts ground in the blender or food processor)for half the white flour in the crust recipe. WOW! What a great nutty combo.

This was the dessert I made for my son's birthday - and he LOVED it!!  I did make a few changes - more strawberries, 2/3 c sugar and 2/3 c water.  I think it's best to determine the sweetness of your strawberries and then adjusting the sugar accordingly.  While the remaining strawberries cooked in the sugar and water, I used an old fashioned potato masher to mash and break up the strawberries.  (I can jellies, and do this for many fruits).  It worked well to bring a nice consistency to the mixture that you pour over the strawberries in the shell.  We used whipped cream to top each piece of pie as we slice it.

I thought this was a great recipe. I used fresh strawberries that we went to pick ourselves. It wasnt to sweet it was just right. My husband said he didnt care for it as much as the recipes that use jello (but that was after he had already devoured 3 pieces).

I did make 2 pies one that I brused the bottom with chocolate as another review suggested and I dont think I'll be doing that again, it just took away from the natural fresh and clean taste of the pie.

Mine didn't set wonderfully either.
I did brush the crust with chocolate, which was so wise! Thank you to that reviewer!
With it not setting as solidly as I would have liked, the chocolate at least prevented a soggy crust and everyone enjoyed that.
The next time I make it I think I might try freezing the finished pie and take it out to thaw slightly before serving.

This is AMAZING! I took the suggestion of someone else and brushed my crust with melted chocolate (let cool/harden before you add the filling) and it was delicious! It disappeared FAST. I took some to my parents and my mom said it was the BEST pie she has EVER had! This is a keeper!

SO GOOD!!! I couldn't believe how fast this disappeared - I had to make a 2nd pie. : ) I followed the recipe exactly, but used store-bought cool whip instead of making whipped cream.

This was a  pretty good pie. I put in the full amount of sugar before tasting my berries which led to the pie being very sweet. Next time I will taste the berries for sweetness first because I think I could have used alot less sugar.

If you just use a lb of strawberries, you'll be skimpy on the strawberries in the pie. I needed about 1 1b and another 1 1/2 cups. I used only 1/2 cup of the water. Next time I will decrease the sugar slightly. The blended water and strawberry mixture was the sweetness of homemade jam, which is a bit too much for me. Used 1 lb of chopped strawberries and another 1 1/2 cups of strawberries for the berry mixture. Added 1 TBS butter to already mixed strawberries and water/strawberry mixture. Definitely cool before placing in the pie crust or you will make your crust soggy.

Used ginger ale instead of water and a graham cracker crust. Since the crust is already sweet I also used half the amount of sugar. It was absolutely delicious!

I still can't really decide if I really like this recipe or not. I use less sugar as per other's suggestions, add some lemon juice to freshen it up. But it still taste kinda 'fake' and not really fresh with strawberry. I may have to try this again.

I made this recipe exactly as it was, and everything turned out wonderful! The only suggestion that I have is for the whipped cream: for a little flavor, add a teaspoon of powdered sugar before whipping (and a drop of almond extract if you feel crazy!) Also, I like to add a couple of drops of lemon juice to the cut strawberries before placing them in the pie pan, which gives the pie a hint of much-needed acidity. Delicious!

Soooooo goooooood!!!!! I did what a couple others suggested: 1/4 mashed and 3/4 I quartered and left un-mashed. I also only used half the sugar and replaced the water with ginger ale. Man it was so good. I did have to add sugar to the whipped cream though; it was kinda cross with out it.

First of all, I used a ton of berries that we just picked & loaded up the crust (they were small berries) - mashed about 2 cups, used 4-5 cups whole. I used just under the full amount of sugar, a tablespoon of lemon juice, half cup of water, and full amount of cornstarch (which I could taste TOO much when I tasted it directly from the pan, but could not detect once it was poured over the other berries in the pie). Made the crust (somewhat successfully, but easy & delicious) from BIG GUY STRAWBERRY PIE. I WILL make this again, it was gone in a flash & the hubby is dreaming for more!

I can't believe how easy this was to make and so good with fresh strawberries.  I used a graham cracker crust and cut back a little on the sugar I used in the pie filling.  Can't wait to make again.  I think I will try this recipe as a topping for cheesecake too.

Tis pie was simple but great, light and refreshing and ready in a flash! I put just a drop of balsamic vinegar into the sauce, and it gave quite the kick it was needed. I had it ready for guests who didn't come after all, so I froze it. Some days later I got it out in the morn and let it in the fridge alla day: it was perfect, I can't imagine what it would have been just eaten fresh!!

I tried this recipe out for mother's day.  It was good but not great or outstanding.  Both of my pies where eaten but I did not get rave reviews and I followed the recipe to the T. I thought it tasted a lil starchy.  Overall I don't think I'll make it again but it was ok.

When  you read all the reviews and they say this is the best strawberry pie ever...they are RIGHT! The absolute perfection of sweet filling plus the  tartness in the fresh strawberries makes you almost fooled into thinking you're helping yourself by having a second piece. The recipe is quite forgiving to modifications but truly there is no need. YUM!

One word: AMAZING! THis pie is so delicious- it tastes similar to strawberry pie at Marie Calendars, but even better! I used Trader Joe's pie crust and thought it was so simple and quick. Loved it.

Short and sweet!  Make it...and watch it disappear!!.  Fast, perfect for a beginner...and OOOOOHHH SO DELISH!!!  If you really want to be company "fancy schmancy" spoon on a little chilled vanila pudding, a dollop of whipped cream...and then a drizzle of chocolate.  Be still my foolish heart!!

I used a few extra strawberries, so I upped the cornstarch about 1 t.

I do a lot of things with fresh strawberrys. Living in San Diego we get some of the best at strawberry time!  I thought this recipe was very good.  My husband really liked it to.  I used a new orleans recipe for a shortbread type crust using oil instead of butter and 2Tablespoons of sugar no baking soda. I had a lot of the cooked berries on top of the fresh...next time I will use a little less of the cooked.  It came out nice and bright red and shiny.  Boil it good till you get a nice color and thickness.

This is the best pie. I have made it a couple of times.  It doesn't last long! I did add red food coloring and a few strawberries on top for looks.

soooo good - solved the almost pink glaze by reddening it with strawberry Kool Aid (not the sugar) and added just enough to color the glaze - added just a little zip and extra flavor!  DO NOT USE SUGARED STRAWBERRY KOOLAID!

Great, simple recipe. Have tried some of the other recipes that use strawberry flavored gelatin, but it's definitely worth the extra 'work' to mash fresh strawberries. It only took me about two minutes to mash the strawberries, the taste is definitely worth it. I only had about 2 T. of cornstarch left in my cabinet, so I stirred in a few T. of flour and the mixture thickened almost instantly. I actually had to add about half a cup of water to the mixture so I could get it lay evenly over the strawberries.  I also used a pre-made graham cracker crust and the sweet combo tasted great!

This was the first strawberry pie I've ever made, and it was fantastic! I liked the jam-like quality of the strawberry filling, rather than the stiff geletain-like or glaze many strawberry pies have. I would reccommend adding more cornstarch if you want a stiffer filling.

Great summer recipe and easy to prepare.  I would suggest slicing the strawberries in thick slices rather than using whole strawberries; makes it easier to cut into slices and to eat. Then save a few sliced strawberries after poring the filling to decorate on the top. The filling will completely cover the berries (does not look like picutre).

It is a good recipe, very good flavor but does not look at all like the photo you see in the recipe...mine got all the way pink, superextra pink pink...the flavor was truly good and used this mixture OVER my favourite strawberry cheesecake, it turned out to be a hit and everyone loved it...I served it just this weekend to celebrate mom´s day ahead.  To be honest I am awarding 4 stars maybe because this is not the recipe I was looking for to top my cheesecake but my mom loved it, my brother and everybody else too, so, yeap, try it, it is a great pie for hot days.

YUUUMMMMMM!  This pie came out GREAT!  I used a 10' deep dish glass pie plate, so I used a LOT more strawberries than the recipe called for.  I did, however, only use one cup of sugar, so it wasn't too sweet and in fact it turned out perfectly!  I would think if using a smaller pie plate then the sugar should be cut down by at least 1/3 cup.  I used 4 TBLS of cornstarch and the pourable topping/mix turned out great!  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I've made this recipe several times so far and my first time was for an Easter dessert. We love it! I did however make some adjustments. I added 4tbsp. of cornstarch & 1 tbsp. lemon juice as suggested by others and used 2 quarts of strawberries since I make deep dish pies. I didn't double the sugar or anything else - just also added 1 small box of instant strawberry jello. It's perfect.

That's what I'm talking about!  Only change was adding another tablespoon of cornstarch.  Looked and tasted great.  This tastes absolutely wonderful and it is extremely easy to make.

Not too bad, but I found that the amount of filling that this recipe made didn't fill up my crust enough, and I used a full pound of strawberries.  I like this recipe because it was very simple and quick, but I may work with it more, because I thought it was lacking a little in flavor, but that could have been because of the berries, rather than the recipe.  It's a great weekday dessert, though!

This was very good, but only because I had excellent strawberries. If yours aren't sweet and juicy, make another dessert instead and save this one for peak strawberry season in your area.

This was really, really good.  And VERY easy.  I didn't want to turn on the oven (to make a crust) so I used a chocolate graham cracker crust I had on hand, and it was great!  THE PICKIEST HUMAN ON EARTH (my father in law) had 2 slices!  WOW!!!  It's a keeper!

Just delicous.  Had to make  a second because my teenage son hogged pretty much the whole first one when he came home from school and saw it sitting in the fridge.  I did manage to get the last piece and it was great. The rest of the family got to try it when I made the next one a few days later and everyone agreed it was delish! I took the reviewer's advice and made the shortbread crust from the Big Guy's strawberry pie recipe on this board.  BIG THUMBS UP!  Thanks

This pie is wonderful and so easy to make.  I add a bit more corn starch for added texture.  Not only is the flavor wonderful, but it is "eye candy" as well.

I have been using this exact recipe for years, actually was going to submit it!  It is the BEST strawberry pie recipe ever; can't wait to use it when berries are ripe this year.  Tip: I have 1 and 1/2ed this recipe for a 10" piled high pie.  Also should add little sugar to whipped cream...

This is my first ever strawberry pie, and it came out perfect.  Like another reviewer, I beat some cream cheese (8 oz. softened. but used about half) and spread a layer on the crust before adding the strawberries.  Dee-lish!

I made this pie using the crust from "Big Guy Strawberry Pie" recipe on this site. This pie filling is SO good! In my opinion it tastes better the next day. I topped the slices with Cool Whip. It was my first attempt at making (and eating!) a strawberry pie, and it turned out great. Thanks!

The filling is great.  Unfortunately, I put it in a regular pie crust, and I think it really needs a graham cracker crust.  Will do that next time.

Absolutely wonderful and simple! I don't like the glazes, so this was perfect. I only used 1/3 cup
sugar because our strawberries were fresh picked and sweet. I also cut the berries up a little. The kids put them in individual graham crust pies and loved them. The pies were gone in one night! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a decent recipe, but I can tell just how good something is by how long it lasts in our refrigerator.  Most pies last three days tops, sometimes only two.  (8 pieces with two of us eating it.)  This one was in there for 5 days and then I threw out the last two pieces.  I would definitely consider making it to take somewhere but probably won't make it again for my husband and myself.

This pie (actually, pies since I made 2) got rave reviews at our Memorial Day picnic.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I was a little disappointed that it ran a bit when I sliced it.  Wasn't as pretty as I would have liked but no one seemed to mind!

This pie was the best.  My friends and co-workers raved about and told me to pass the recipe along.  I did make a few changes.  I added a tablespoon of unsalted butter to the cooked strawberry mixture and I also made it with a butter cookie crust.  I served it ice cold and it was a great treat.  Will make again, but this time with less sugar as suggest by others.

I did what Misty said to do. However, my strawberries were not field fresh just those Driscoll store bought harder berries. They weren't super sweet so I kept the sugar at a full cup. The pie was perfect and I left 2/3's of the berries whole and 1/3 mashed and cooked. Used 1/2 cup water. Threw everything in a pot and brought it to a boil till it thickened and the juices were clear, about 3-5 minutes.  DELICIOUS! Used a gluten free crust that was the BEST PIE CRUST I EVER MADE. It is in allrecipes under gluten free piecrust  It only has 5 reviews and is easy to find, you could substitute regular flour and it would work great.

I got a lot of compliments at the cookout for this pie! I chose this recipe because it did not use Jello - if you use Jello, it’s just Jello with fruit in it, not a fruit pie. Easy to make, and I also liked that it used a premodern Pillsbury crust. Criticisms: runny (I followed the directions exactly) and the crust was soggy the next day. It was so popular, though, only one soggy slice left...

I made this and followed the recipe. It shriveled something terrible on the sides and the bottom puffed up too, despite having pricked bottom and sides with a fork. After, I stumbled across this: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-blind-bake-pie-crust/
I’m certain had I used pie weights it would have been fine. The flavor is all there, absolutely delicious, it just looked awful lol. I was worried about stretching the crust too much so I don’t believe I pressed the bottom and sides enough either. I’m giving the recipe 5 stars, but I wish they’d mentioned using the pie weights.

amazing pie.  I took the suggestions of others and decreased water to 1/2 cup and only used a 1/4 of the berries to make the thickner.   Mixed all the ingredients together cold and then heated up on the stove, stirring constantly.  The thickner turned out perfect and was very thick.  My family LOVED the pie.

My first strawberry pie.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and 2 quarts of berries. I blind baked the crust, brushing with egg white 1/2 way through. Perfect consistency,  not runny.

Always my go-to but with fresh picked sweet strawberries, I cut the sugar in half. If your berries are very ripe, no need for more sugar than this.

The best fresh strawberry pie!  So much better than the recipe that uses strawberry gelatin.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and put fresh berries in bottom and then again on top after adding cooked berries.  So yummy and delicious.

I made this twice the first time I don’t think I cooked the strawberries long enough they did not set solid however the second time I added only 3/4c sugar and since my pie plate is deep I used 4c quartered strawberries and used 2c in the sauce part also I used a graham crust instead of pastry it was fabulous!!!

Made it.  Loved it.  Will make it often.
I did coat the crust with melted semi-sweet chocolate as was suggested.  That was a  nice surprise for folks.  Also only mashed 1/4 of the strawberries, and put all sauce makings in the pot at one time.  I served it with real whipped cream.   Turned out great.

This pie is amazing and so so easy! I like that it doesn’t use gelatin...just not a big fan of it.  I did use the suggestions of mashing only 1/4 of the strawberries in stead of half. I did 3/4 cup sugar instead of a full cup and 1/2 cup water instead of 3/4. Did not make my own whipping cream.

If we make this again I'd cut the strawberries to make enjoying it easier and use less sugar in the mashed mixture .
Super easy to make- my 3 year old was able to do this on his own!

This is a great recipe... I just needed the recipe to give me ideas. We picked 20 gallons of Strawberries in Plant City over the weekend. I don’t know a  better way to use them up. I did add more strawberries than it calls out for in this recipe... I filled both pie shells with as many strawberries as they hold. Then I added what I thought would be enough berries to the pot and mashed away. I basically doubled the recipe (even more strawberries) but only used the 3 Tablespoons cornstarch and 3/4 water as called for as thickener. Devided cooked mixture equally... work out perfectly! Crowd pleasure for sure.

I loooooovee this recipe! I've made it at least 10 times - usually whenever strawberries are on sale. I follow it exactly and it always turns out perfect. I'm gluten free so I use a gluten free crust and when I don't make my own whipped cream - I use Cool Whip and it's just perfect.

I loved this recipe! For me, my strawberrys were frozen, so they were mostly cut in half and didn't show up as prominently as they do in the cover picture of this recipe. I still loved this recipe and it was super delicious!

Excellent! And because I can't resist adding my own personal touch to a recipe once I've made it... The next time I decided to use the "Mock Chocolate Cookie Crust" from this site. Then I whipped up a generous amount of heavy cream, sweetened it slightly with a little sugar and mounded it in the cooled pie crust before topping it with the cooled strawberry mixture. Chilled for a couple of hours. It was terrific!!!

My 8 year old grandson and I made this for the family.  We surprised everyone by throwing in some milk and dark chocolate melting wafers.   When chilled, it was a nice chocolatey crunch.  We topped with whipped cream.  YUM.  Everyone ate it, even the ones who don't usually care for pie.

Every year I make a glazed strawberry pie for my daughters with fresh strawberries and they love it (I used to buy the enveloppe for the glaze).  I decided to try this recipe because I didn’t have an enveloppe and it was AMAZING! Everyone loved it and we will never buy an enveloppe again!  I decorated the top with shaved chocolate and some whole berries... looked great and tasted even better!!

The strawberry glaze thickened a little but nothing like what it should. It did taste good so may try going down to 1/2 C water.

I am from NJ and just picked strawberries from a local farm, so this recipe caught my eye. I made it twice this week because the family loved it!  It was pretty for the Fourth of July. First I made it with the freshly picked strawberries, and the second time I made a combination of store-bought strawberries and blueberries. Change: lessen the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested by other users.  I used a pre-made pastry shell and added flavor by crumbling animal crackers and sugar cookies into a fine powder and adding a sprinkle of cinnamon. Before baking it I caked the powder mixture onto both sides of the pastry shell and brushed it with a beaten egg to get the sides a pretty golden brown.  I took the suggestion of another baker and let it set in the refridgerator 12-24 hours before serving. I also made a homemade whipped cream. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've made this twice. Was fantastic the first time, but today there was a bottle of Grande  Marnier on the counter, so 
I was tempted into substituting 1/2 of the water/corn starch mix with it, OMG, IT WAS GREAT!

I made this pie almost as the recipe stated, the exceptions  being I didn't measure out the fruit, I just eyeballed it and I cooked the glaze on the stove top at a higher temp  until it thickened up quite a bit  which turned out to be about 4 minutes. 

The taste was phenomenal.  My kids raved over it and I decided on the spot that I was going to try the same pie using fresh peaches as soon as I can.  My one critique is that  it was just a bit sweeter than I would have liked.  Even my kids said it was a little on the "too sweet" side.  I'll use only 3/4 cup of sugar next time.    If you are expecting a more solid pie that slices cleanly, it's not going to do that. You aren't using gelatin so It will spread and ooze a little after it's cut.  That did not detract from my expectations in the least.  It was just like an old fashioned refrigerated fruit pie from my past.

This was amazing! Tasted great, and super easy to make. If you have a 9inch pan, you should use about a third for the filling and chop 2/3 to put directly in. It fills the crust better, and it's not so overwhelming jam. The instructions for the filling itself are also nonsense, you just need to put them all into a cold pan and boil, then take off of Hearn and stir more once it's come to boil. It thickens very fast this way. I would also recomend running your cornstarch through a sifter before it goes in to avoid lumps. Overall, this was a great foundation for a recipient, it just needs a few alterations.

Made modifications after reading reviews.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 C. and kept the rest the same.  Set up and tasted good, but the appearance was not attractive with the smashed berries.

This is an easy recipe.  I much prefer it to a pie made withstrawberry sauce that you can buy in the grocery store.  It is a bit sweet so next time I make it I will cut the sugar to 3/4 or 1/2 cup.  I wonder if the sugar is meant to be divided between the sauce and the whipped cream.  Since the weather was very hot, I used a graham cracker crust instead of baking a crust.

I just made this pie and it was a total bust! I still believe in the basic premise, though. When I try again next year, I will use another reviewer's suggestion to add weight to the pie crust as I'm baking it to keep the sides from falling down. (That's not this recipe's fault- just my own inexperience.) I will also make less of the mashed berry mixture (puree 1/4 of the strawberries and only add 3/4 cup sugar), I will take it off of the stove as soon as it starts to thicken (mine got thick in under 1 minute, but since the recipe said 10 minutes, I let it stay on longer) and I will add the glaze on layer by layer of the fresh strawberries instead of putting a layer of jello on top of a huge pile of strawberries.

We haven't cut into it yet but it looks great.  I am a bit worried it will be too sweet.  wondering if the sour cream topping for impossible cheesecake might be just right for it?

This pie is so delicious! I've made it many times and it always turns out perfectly! I do add some confectioner's sugar to the whipped cream to make it even better!

I followed the recipe except I took other reviewer’s suggestions on using half a cup water instead of 3/4 of a cup, but still used  3 tablespoons of cornstarch. Came out perfectly and not running at all. Everyone loved it!

I will definitely be making this pie several times this summer!  I followed Misty's suggestions (most helpful review) and it came out perfect!  The only thing I changed was the crust - I used a graham cracker crust (Graham Cracker Crust I recipe by Carol here on allrecipes).  I was surprised by how easy and delicious this pie turned out my first time making it : )

Excellent. Instead of mashing the strawberries for the liquid filling I pureed them in a food processor. Came out great, family loved it. Would make again.

this recipe was sooo good! The pie set up so nicely and pretty quickly too.  I put it in the freezer for a little bit to cool it down faster and we ate it 2 hours after making it.  I think the next time I make it, I will try a graham cracker crust.  Fresh whipped cream is a must on top!

Delicious what more is there to say, absolutely delicious. Will be making again. 

After reading many of the comments and they are having an issue with it not setting and it is not the recipe that is the issue. Ignore the time given and do it by consistency. When cooking the strawberry filling make sure it thickens before you pour into the pie crust, it will look thick and feel thick when mixing.  DO NOT go by time and go by look and feel because when you use cornstarch you cannot go by time because there are variables like the juiciness of the fruit, the temp your stove temp cooks at, etc. Be patient and it should work.

A new favorite! Perfected the second time around by using 1/4 the water called for (just enough to mix with corn starch) and 1/2 the sugar. First time was still great with 1/2 water and slightly reduced sugar, but was runny and a bit sweet

Made this pie yesterday and cut into it today -- my husband keeps saying "Wow" and just told me: "Man, that's a good pie, baby!" So it's a definite keeper! Following other reviewers' suggestions I cut the sugar down (to two-thirds of a cup - our berries were quite sweet) and the water to a half cup. I also used more strawberries and mashed just 1/4 of them, adding the sugar, cornstarch and water directly to the mashed strawberries. Be careful: the sauce thickens quite quickly, so keep an eye on it and do stir all the time! I let the sauce sit for a few minutes after it was thick before pouring it over the strawberries in the pie shell, which I had painted with some melted chocolate. SO happy to have a wonderful strawberry pie recipe that doesn't require Jell-o or gelatin (yuck to both).

My strawberries didn't set up very well. I followed the recipe instructions and cooked the mixture for 10 minutes but it just didn't get very thick. It does taste good but it's a little too sweet. If I try to make this again I won't use more than 3/4 cup sugar.

Excellent spring pie! Dident change a thing. However,  this recipe calls for one quart of strawberries divided. Half the strawberries leave whole and fill the pie shell, the rest make the compote. However,  I recommend cutting the whole strawberries in half or quarters depending on their size. I had larger strawberries and it made it difficult and messy to cut. I also recommend a home made pie crust....so much better!

Perfect! I made the filling exactly according to recipe, delicious!  I did use a graham cracker crust to save time and it worked beautifully.  
Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Tasted great, but would not recommend this recipe because it did not thicken enough to make it hold together.  It was soupy and I cooked it about twice as long as recommended.  Tried turning it up to higher than simmer, but it did not get thick enough to not be soupy.  Tried it twice.  Same results.

This was just okay.  I added a layer of chocolate on the bottom of the crust, like one person in the reviews did.  That was fine.  The pie was mushy although I even cut back 1/4 of the liquid, Which was ginger ale, not water.  It was tasty but did not present well and fell apart while slicing.  It was embarrassing.

I picked the last of our strawberry crop today (which amounted to about 5-6 cups of strawberries) and was in search of a super quick/easy dessert to prepare with them as I only had an hour to spare... I had all the ingredients for this recipe so I decided to give it a try. Our strawberries are very small and not overly sweet this year so I used (almost) the full cup of sugar and left most of the berries whole (with the exception of a few larger ones that I cut in half). I put 3/4 of the strawberries into my baked pie shell, then mashed the remainder in a pot and added the sugar, water, and 1/4-cup of cornstarch. I washed the berries and they were still a bit wet so I reduced the water to just under 1/2-cup.  Brought it to a boil - stirring constantly - over medium-high heat. When it boiled, reduced to low and simmered (still stirring constantly) for another 1-2 minutes. I immediately poured the hot mixture over the berries in the shell and put it in the fridge. It chilled for about 3-hours in the fridge before my family devoured it... It was perfection! Pie was firm and delish. I LOVE when I find easy recipes that only take a few simple ingredients and a couple minutes to prepare. I will definitely make this again. Awesome with vanilla ice cream, would be equally awesome with whipped cream.

This is a really good and easy basic strawberry pie recipe. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup to save a few calories and it was still plenty sweet enough for me. I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice while cooking and  cooked the berries sliced rather than mashing them. I have used this recipe twice so far and will use it again.

Used this recipe as a base.  Added blueberries and blackberries.  I used a graham cracker crust for a no-bake summer pie!  Delicious!

Mine turned out watery. Not sure why since I added only 1/2 cup water as opposed to 3/4 cup.

This is a recipe I've made and loved since the 70s , especially during strawberry season , but with one difference. I've never added in the water. I simply bring the mashed berries and sugar to a boil, add in the 3 T of cornstarch, stir and simmer for 10 minutes, then pour over the berries in the baked pie shell. I've never had  bad results!  (I also spread a bit of the glaze on the bottom of the crust before adding the u mashed berries, which I like cut in half. It helps prevent soggy crust from the berries. )

Superb! This works really well, and the only caveat to people who find it "soupy"  is to suggest, add less water, as others have done. Use only half a cup, for instance, if your berries are really ripe and extra juicy. Or even 1/4 cup. This recipe works perfectly "as is" if you have firm, fresh, just-picked, not-overly-ripe berries. A stellar performer!

This recipe was delish.  I doubled it to make 2 pies and it worked fine.  I added some powdered sugar and vanilla extract to the whipping cream but that's the only change I made. Used hot water pie crust from this site for the pies. All in all very tasty.

The best strawberry pie I've had! I used some strawberries that grew in my mom's garden and it was delicious.
The only thing that I would change would be to add less water as the sauce wasn't quite as thick as I wanted. 
Otherwise, really good recipe!

I love strawberry pie when strawberries are in season and this is my favorite recipe.  Just lots of fruit, some sugar and a little corn starch.  The best of early summer.

Our official favorite.  My mom makes it every times she comes.  Her fresh pie crust compliments the recipe perfectly.  
The strawberry center is cooked perfectly and it holds its note so that with each bite you taste the flake of the crust  and the bright cooked meshed with the tart fresh.  Every bite makes you smile.

Very yummy. I ended guessing how many strawberries I was using for the filling because I had a huge case of them. I would use more for next time. I smashed them like 2/3 of the way so it had a really nice texture. The strawberries released a lot of juice when smashed so I lowered water to 1/4 cup and decreased sugar to 3/4 cups (might lower a smidge more next time as I don't like overly sweet things) Did as previous reviewer suggested and threw it all in one pot and turned heat to medium high. Was concerned that it was so watery so as soon as it started boiling it thickened in less than a minute. I could stop licking the pot! Poured over halved strawberries in a shortbread crust. Waiting to cool now to eat with homemade whipped cream yummmmm....

This is my go to strawberry pie recipe. My spouse is obsessed with this pie!  I use 1/2 cup water and 3 T of corn starch. I also use between 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup of sugar depending on how sweet the strawberries are.

New strawberry pie recipe for me. It is now the only strawberry pie recipe for this family.  I changed from original recipe on second and third pies just to play. I used more strawberry slices and less mashed. All a matter  of how much you like pieces of fruit in pie. Great strawberriy lovers recipe

Taste was amazing, but the filling was really runny--probably didn't wait long enough for it to set or cooked long enough. It was just for me and my boyfriend, so we didn't care!

Very good and super easy to make. Next time I will slice the strawberries and only mash 1/4 rather than 1/2. The pie was set in one hour. Will make again.

This pie has a really good flavor. I was rushed for time so I put the "sauce", strawberries and painted crust in the freezer to chill. It was still a bit soupy but that was my fault. Will try this recipe again.

This was really good!  I'm not a huge pie fan, and I still really liked it.
I did a homemade graham cracker crust, pie filling from this recipe (EXCEPT I used a half cup of granulated and a half cup of powdered sugar instead of full cup of granulated), and I put a crumble on top (cuz the top just looked like jam... not like the pretty picture attached to this recipe) :-).  I baked the crumble on a cookie sheet about 10 min, put it atop the pie, and then baked the whole thing at 425 for about 20 minutes.  YUM!!!!!  Took this to a family picnic, and everyone loved it (even the kids).  My husband said "keep this recipe!" I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Easy! Delicious, too, though maybe a tad too sweet even after I decreased sugar to 3/4 cup.  I will make this again and again, though, maybe decreasing sugar yet again.

OKBEE, thanks for the wonderful recipe!  Because I bought today's freshly picked farm stand strawberries, I used less sugar, 3/4 cup. Next time, I might consider 2/3 cup of sugar. Just a wonderful pie, bursting with fresh REAL strawberry flavor!  However, I doubt that the photo shows "only" one quart of strawberries.  I used 3 pints and the pie was a little skimpy. Next time I will also "load up."   I might also do what others did (as reviewed) and put the bulk of the strawberries IN the pie shell and use less for the cooked portion. Wow, so good and it deserves 10 stars, not 5.

My pie didn't quite set in the middle, but I think that's because I used too much mashed strawberry.

So tasty!!

Stawberries for $1.99/lb at Shopright? Yaas please! X2. But then, 2 days later, my husband asked me, "What will we do with all of these strawberries?" 
This recipe was great. I cut the sugar to about a half of a cup, but aside from that, I made it just as it states. It was great. My husband loved it, too. 

If I could make any changes, I'd just up the strawberries (and keep the sugar as-is. They're sweet enough.).  If I'd known I was making this recipe before I bought these on-sale strawberries, I probably would've bought 3-4 quarts.

Also, one last note, add a pinch of salt. It's a sweet recipe, and a pinch will do wonders.

I just made it for the first time.. seems that 1 qt of strawberries weren't quite enough.  I could have used a handfull more for layering in the pie.  I cut down on the sugar just a bit.  

I think I'll blend the strawberries for the filling next time to get a smoother filling.   Taste test was good!  Very easy.

I liked it very much, the only thing I would change is to put less sugar because it's very sweet; it was amazing nonetheless. When you have cutted it put a little whipped cream on top and it's going to be beyond amazing.

Made it  exactly as written the first time.  2nd time I increased the berries and decreased the water/cornstarch mixture.  It was great both ways - I prefer more fruit.  Want to try it with peaches and raspberries.

I made this today and it turned out perfect! I read some of the other reviews stating it came out runny. I think you simply must follow the recipe to the letter, and cook it over medium heat. It does take a little while for it to thicken, but it is well worth it. Great Recipe!

My husband requested this pie, I have not had it before. Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe, except I'm ashamed to admit that I added some red gel food coloring, so mine would be nice and red like the one online. Lol. This is a very simple pie to make. I would suggest to the people that had trouble with the filling not setting up--incorporate the cornstarch/ water mixture a little at a time, to let the boiling temp of the filling to heat back up. I added mine like a fourth of the cornstarch/water mixture at a time.

This is a very delicious recipe and the magic, I believe, is in the strawberries. I had amazing plump and sweet ones that have been delicious in all I've used them in!  I did follow some other tips: melted a thin layer of chocolate on the pie crust, I used milk chocolate morsels because that's what I had but would recommend a good dark chocolate, I also cooked 1 cup mashed strawberries with 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup sugar and the cornstarch until it was thick but maybe I should have cooked longer? It was not translucent and basically covered the layered strawberries so you couldn't see how nicely I'd layered them. I will make again and try mixing the strawberries in with the cooled "jam" and then pour in pie crust. Was delicious that night but even better the next day. Giving it 12 hours to settle is probably a good idea. This recipe is a great one for highlighting really delicious strawberries which you don't want their flavor to be lost through cooking or other ingredients.

This is one of the best Strawberry Pie recipes ever!  Just be sure to make it first thing in the morning for optimal taste and presentation.  Even making it just the night before is taking away from it's optimal flavor and the crispness of the crust as this crust will get soggy really fast.

Used this recipe only for the strawberry glaze and made a different strawberry pie.  Taste was fine, but the glaze was cloudy.  The next time, I would leave the berries whole or halved...not crushed.

I wish I could give this 10 stars, it is by far one of the best pies I have made! I had tiny wild strawberries all over the lawn and while it took about 2.5 hours to pick them,  the end result was well worth it. 
I only mashed 1/4 of the berries and used 3/4c sugar. I was short one cup of strawberries, so I added a cup of raspberries. Mine only took a couple minutes to thicken, not the full 10 mins.  This was my first attempt at "blind baking" a crust. Not hard but make sure you fill rice or whatever your using to the tippity top, other wise pie will sag. Fresh whipped cream is a must for this mouth watering pie!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it's great.  I had small fresh strawberries which were perfect for this pie. If you are using large berries, you might want to halve them instead of leave them whole.

I made this for Father's Day carrying dessert at church. Everyone loved it! I melted one fourth cup of chocolate chips to frost the bottom of the baked pie crust before filling it. Delicious! I'm not sure if I liked the whole strawberries lining the pie. It looked impressive, but it was hard to cut with a fork. In my 10-inch pie plate I think I used 2 pounds of strawberries between the whole ones lining the bottom and the filling I made on the stove.

Love this recipe especially since it doesn't use Jello with the red coloring.  Using fresh strawberries gives this pie a beautiful natural red color.  It has been one of my favorites for a very long time. Oh I thought I need to add more whole strawberries to the pie so I added more.  Then I had syrup leftover.  Next time I'll follow directions and just put 2 cups in the pie and 2 cups for the syrup.

This was so easy, so tasty, loved it. I have to admit I did what Misty indicated in the review and it turned out perfect. Wife was astounded and the firmness and taste says, do me again. Thanks

I think I found ny new favorite dessert, my family said, "This tastes like summer!"  If I could give this more than a 5, I would!!  I did follow a suggestion to only mash 1/3 of the berries and used 3/4 of a cup a sugar.  Also I made homemade whipped cream and topped it, looked great and added a nice creaminess.  Highly recommended!!  Enjoy!!

I used 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cups water bc it looked too thick but I should have stuck with 1/2 cup water. I used mostly halved berries and wish I had sliced them, would have made it easier to eat. Plan on eating it with two days or the strawberries get yucky.

I also added more berries, decreased sugar and water to 1/2c each.  Came out great and set up perfectly.  I put filling in a graham cracker crust - makes it extra special.

Pie set up nicely but if you're making two pies, would probably need 3 pkg. of strawberries instead of two.  The two came out a bit on the short side.

I had a ton of fresh, local strawberries to use and this recipe was amazing, although I made a couple of changes out of necessity. So taking 1 star away since the recipe just doesn't seem practical as is. Thank goodness for the reviews and some improvisation!

I used a graham cracker crust for this pie and it was absolutely perfect for it! It did not get soggy like some reviews mentioned about the regular crust. I mixed 1.5 cups of vanilla flavored graham crackers, 1/3 c melted butter, and 1/4 c sugar, and then pressed it into the pie plate and baked at 375 for 7 minutes. This crust complemented the pie perfectly!

For the pie, I followed the reviewer suggestions to put 3 quarters of the strawberries I had set aside in the cooled pie crust and then I mashed the other 1 quarter and mixed with 3T cornstarch, 1/2 c water, and 3/4 c white sugar and brought the whole thing to a boil for only about a minute or 2 since it did thicken up so quickly. 
The only problem was after pouring this mix over the strawberries in the crust, the pie plate was extremely underfilled. I must have gotten my proportions off. I weighed out the strawberries since I didn't have a 1 qt container and 1.5 lbs was not nearly enough to fill the pie. It looked nothing like the picture!! 
To remedy this I made a strawberry whipped topping by beating together 2/3 c heavy whipping cream with about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract until it thickened, and then added 1/4 cup of sugar and about 10-12 strawberries that I had b

We have 20 gallons of strawberries we picked at a local farm, so we have strawberry madness and need desserts to use up what we have. This is the first recipe I've used so far. And it came out soupy and mushy. I believe it may have something to do with the strawberries and not the recipe itself. They were overly ripe and bruised and super succulent. If you have strawberries like this, I would recommend skipping the 3/4 cup water all together. Or doubling the cornstarch. 

Store purchased strawberries are picked prematurely so they last longer before being purchased. Something I will remeber the next time I make this pie.

First time I ever made strawberry pie & we loved it! It was so easy & I followed the "cheat" of  using less strawberries for mashing & adding the 3T of cornstarch, water, a little less sugar all together in the cold pot, then turning on the stove top to med-high & stirring constantly until it started boiling. Boiling 2-3 minutes max since it gets thick very fast.  Then pouring it over the prepared pie crust with strawberries in it. It was set in fridge for less than 2 hours & came out great! I will definitely make this again using fresh picked strawberries from a berry farm a few miles from us.

This was very easy to make and super tasty. I did change one thing, which was to cook all the strawberries together in the pot with the cornstarch mixture. I like my strawberry pie to be a bit more gooey which is why I cooked it all together. I will definitely make this again.

Great- I used 1/4 cup  of sugar since the berries were very ripe and a pinch of ginger powder- very nice flavor. Also only 1/2 cup of water. Leave the whipped cream unsweetened since it's a sweet pie.

My 6 year old son recently went to a strawberry patch with his class. He brought home fresh strawberries and asked for a strawberry pie. I settled on this recipe and it was a success! Like some of the other reviews, I cut the water down to 1/2 cup. I also mixed the corn starch and sugar together before adding it to the strawberries. I topped it with whipped topping instead of heavy whipping cream. We will definitely have this again!

This pie was delicious!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and only mashed one cup of the strawberries to cook with the sugar and sliced the remainder and placed them in the pie shell.  The strawberry flavor is very pure, so your berries need to be high quality-I purchased mine from a local grower the day they were picked and made my pie the same day.

This could not have been easier! It was delicious. I took the advice in other comments and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I used my immersion blender to thoroughly smooth the mixture. I also cut the strawberries into smaller chunks instead of leaving them whole. It was fantastic.

My husband is anti-dessert and I've never seen him eat more than about 2 bites of anything sweet. I gave him a bite of this and his immediate reaction was an emphatic "Wow!" He then proceeded to cut himself a massive slice and clean his plate, then asked me to make it at least every week. Never thought I'd find a dessert my husband liked, let alone absolutely adores! I took other reviewers' advice and did more mashed strawberries with less sugar and water, and it turned out beautifully. Fantastic dish, will be making again soon!

Fabulous recipe! It is very easy and simple to make especially if you want to make something on a budget or you want something fun and quick to make! Instead of cream I used vanilla ice cream which worked very well. I will definitely be making this again sometime.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more strawberries, 12 ounces for the sauce and 24 ounces for the pie. I thickened the sauce as directed and poured it over the strawberries but it was too thick to sink in so I dumped everything into a bowl, mixed it together and put it back in the pie shell. Unfortunately, the pie did not set up at all after 24 hours in the fridge, it was like strawberry soup. Admittedly, it may have been because I sliced the strawberries instead of leaving them whole, I thought that would make it easier to slice the pie. They probably released too much juice and thinned the sauce. I would have considered pitching the recipe if it didn't taste so good. My husband put it over vanilla ice cream and said it tasted like Strawberry Shortcake. Because of the flavor, I will attempt this recipe again, leaving the strawberries whole and see if it turns out better.

The only change I made was to top with Vanilla Yogurt instead of Whipped Cream. It was handy, didn't  need to prepare and something we always have.

I halved the recipe as I was using some leftover pie crust dough that fit in a small rectangular dish.  I probably used more berries in the mashed portion as I measured after mashing.  This didn't need whipping cream.  It didn't take as long as indicated to thicken.  Very quick and easy to make, especially with the scraps of crust dough saved in the freezer.

My mother likened this to an angels kiss, I did however add fresh ginger, more strawberries (2.5c mashed 3cups whole), corn starch and slightly more sugar as I used a deep dish pie pan. I also added two teaspoons of sugar to the whipping cream. This was the perfect strawberry treat. So simple and so delicious. Thank you.

I reduced the water to 1/2 cup, and it still didn't some anywhere close to setting. The one direction that seems to be missing is how long to boil the strawberry-sugar mix before adding the water-cornstarch. I boiled mine for about 10 mins before adding the water and cornstarch. Either way, it tasted fine, but was a disaster to look at.

I followed others suggestions to only use 1/4 of the strawberries in the simple syrup and was happy with the results although this pie really needs more than 1 quart of strawberries. The filling didn't come close to reaching the top of the pie crust leaving a lot more crust than pie. Next time I will use at least 1 more pint of strawberries.

Yummy! I followed the recipe but used about 1 1/2 Qts of strawberries. I always cut the ones for the pie in half because it's difficult to eat whole ones. Mine set up perfectly, I added a few drops of red food coloring to the mixture after it was thickened & let it cool a bit before pouring over strawberries, no soggy crust!

I've been making open face fruit pies for a long time but this was my first attempt at strawberry. Here is how you adjust the recipe for a 10 inch pie shell.
Use 2 quarts of strawberries. Just under a quart is needed for the glaze and the rest should be washed and towel-dried gently, especially if very ripe. Just over a quart is reserved and kept whole/uncooked
Increase the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups (you really don't want to double this)
Increase the amount of cornstarch to 6 level Tbsp (I measured 5 without leveling)
Increase the amount of water to 1 cup + 2 Tbsp

In order to achieve the result as pictured, after "cooking" the mashed strawberry mixture, it is necessary to strain it into a bowl, leaving most of the seeds/pulp and using only the gelatinous, translucent portion. Also, I strongly recommending cooling the cooked mixture to room temperature (or even cooler) before mixing with fresh strawberries. I also highly recommend mixing the gelatin with the strawberries prior to placing in the pre-cooked pie shell. This will help form a more solid "filling" and prevents the strawberries from "cooking" and getting too mushy.

I didn't get the pretty glossy red glaze color that I see in most of the pics.  But it still tasted great and set up nicely.  Thanks for the tip to prevent a soggy crust -- I melted choc chips in the bottom of the just baked crust and cooled in fridge before filling.  Also let the filling cool.  Next time I will try mixing it with the strawberries before filling the crust.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is! I've made it every summer with fresh picked berries and it's very delicious.  I love that it doesn't use gelatin like so many other strawberry pie recipes.  Make some fresh whipped cream and it's the perfect summer dessert.

The flavor was wonderful-the family loved it. Although it didn't make the crust soggy, it just didn't set up as well as I would have liked.  I think it depends on how juicy the strawberries are. I let the cornstarch mix boil for 10 minutes, so I'm sure it was thoroughly cooked. Next time, I will take that into account and add more cornstarch.

We thought this pie was delicious!  I think I will use more strawberries next time because I wanted more of the mashed and the whole!  I went a little short on the sugar and thought it could have used the whole cup, so next time I'll adjust all of that (or use a smaller pan).  And there will be a next time!  Yum!  Thanks, OKBEE!

I made the recipe as-is and it tasted pretty good.  I don't think anyone was overly impressed. It was really more like strawberry soup than a pie. Still, it tasted fresh and the homemade whipped cream made it a tasty finish to an Easter meal.

Turned out great! Someone suggested I use ginger ale instead of water so I put 1/4 cup of ginger ale and 1/2 cup of water with my cornstarch just to try it and it tasted really good!

Quite yummy. I like double crust so I cooked cutout pie crust circles and added them to the top after set.

I had high hopes for this. It wasn't bad, but I'd prefer just strawberries and cream. It's also not especially attractive, although if you added red food coloring it might help.

I used one of the reviewer's suggestions of mixing the sugar w/the cornstarch and then boiling the whole thing until translucent.  Not only did it set perfectly but the several hrs noted was not necessary.  
I used flax milk in place of water.
I used a store bought graham cracker crust and frozen strawberries and had complete success.  Thank you for this recipe!  I banged out a delicious pie in like 20 mins.   :)

delicious strawberry topping, but the whole pie was a mess.  My kids said that Gordon Ramsey would be disgusted at the sight of it, would then taste it and say how good it was.

It tasted good, but I couldn't get it to set up. This is the third recipe I've tried that uses cornstarch to thicken a pie, and it has never turned out. I think I must be doing something wrong.

Liked this a lot. I omitted the water though. Added a small squeeze of lemon juice instead of water. Otherwise it's too runny and won't thicken properly.

Next time I would cut the uncooked strawberries into bite-sized pieces so my young children could eat them more easily. Loved the taste though, and this was a big hit with my family. I used up leftover strawberries before they went bad, and had all the rest of the ingredients in my kitchen already.

I love to bake but the only person I have to share my goodies with is my boyfriend so I cut the recipe down to two servings. I used Mom's Pie Crust from this site and baked it in muffin tins. If you do this make sure you prick your crust so it doesn't puff up. I followed the recipe to a t except for the strawberries, I just eyeballed that and I added some lemon zest. I mashed the strawberries until I got the consistency I wanted and put them and the cornstarch mixture into the pot. The mixture thickened in less than 10 minutes so I didn't really time it out. When it felt thick enough I put the mixture into the pie crusts over sliced strawberries. I left them in the fridge for about four hours and they were perfect. My boyfriend liked this pie better than the Chocolate French Silk I made the night before!

Love this pie! My husband requested a strawberry pie for Thanksgiving and found this recipe. It was a snap to put together and set up beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't make the whipped cream. I also used a graham cracker crust. This tasted so good, just like fresh strawberries. I will definitely make this again.

This was great!  I didn't have enough strawberries so I blended up a nectarine and plum to add to the strawberry sauce.  It was perfect and a great option to help incorporate some other flavors if you wanted.  Can't wait to make it again, this time with all strawberries!

This was very good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and only added 3/4 cup sugar, but I think next time I will add a little less than a cup, but more than the 3/4 cup I tried. I took the water down to 1/2 cup.  I mashed 1/4 strawberries with a potato masher and then added the sugar. Then brought it to a boil and added the cornstarch/water mixture, then constantly stirred for about 3 minutes.  We used a homemade pie crust.  YUM!  I think another change I might make is to follow the recipe and do 1/2 strawberries mashed and 1/2 in the pie crust.

Great!  I followed some of the recommendations here, such as mashing only 1/4 of the strawberries, reducing sugar to 3/4 cup and water to 1/2 cup. I made a deep dish pie so I multiplied everything by 1 1/2. Also added some red food coloring to the glaze.  Incorporated glaze into strawberries before filling pastry.  I've also tried the chocoloate on the inside of the crust which was good.  Just be sure to cool the glaze before filling.

Excellent! Took me quite a bit longer to get the heated mixture to thicken, lots or stirring and waiting! In the end, oh so worth the wonderful fresh taste! Mmmm! Thank you :)

This was delicious and easy to make. I only used 3/4 cup sugar because that was all that I had. Also, I used a pre-made "short-bread" crust (similar to the graham cracker crust that you can buy at the grocery store) and it went together perfectly. I will make this again. And it tasted better the next day after the flavors mingled.

Super easy to make & yummy!  I followed the recipe & lined the baked pastry shell with fresh whole strawberries & mashed the rest in the cooked mixture but next time I make it, I'll slice all of the strawberries - easier to cut into with a fork.

This was really good! I made it for some friends (there were 6 of us) and it was gone in no time! When one of our friends asked if there was more, he was very sad when I told him no...and he started licking his plate! My husband also liked the pie, although he thought it was a bit too sweet. I might try it with less sugar next time.

This is the easiest recipe I have made.  My family REALLY enjoyed it; especially with the whipped cream on top.  I can also use this recipe for other fruits.

My 18 year old even helped with this, he thought it was the "Best Ever"!!  Wanted to save the recipe so he can make another after he eats this one. Good thing we picked 30 quarts of strawberries ;)

Amazing! I did make some changes... I used a nonfat pie crust and Splenda instead of Sugar. I also covered the pie crust with a thin layer of dark chocolate. I cooked the mix the ENTIRE 10 minutes (unlike several reviews that say to cook it for less time.) The pie set in less than 4 hours. The color was kind of off so I covered the top of the pie with Low Fat whipped Cream. It was a HUGE it!

This is a great way to use strawberries in the summer! Such an easy recipe and tastes so great. The whipped cream really adds to the pie so don't skip it! I've added some blueberries if I have them around and it has turned out great too.

I have to give a shoutout to BTEAMMOM's suggestion of painting the crust with a layer of chocolate -- it was unbelieveable!  It did a great job of keeping it from getting soggy.  When I told the folks at the 4th of July party we took the pies to what I had done, I looked around and mouths were hanging open in awe.  It was a huge hit!  I also threw in some blueberries in one pie -- that was delicious AND patriotic :) Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fabulous! The only change I made was substituting Splenda for the sugar. I used Pie Crust IV from this site...and still super easy.

Yummy! I used strawberries that I picked myself from a strawberry farm so I knew they were at the peak of ripeness. Because of this I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and thought it was just right. I also only used 1/2 cup of water.

This didn't turn out.  The filling never firmed up completely.  The only reason  I gave it two stars instead of 1 is that the filling was quite delicious and is excellent served warm over vanilla ice cream.

I found this recipe after strawberry picking at the Sussex County Strawberry Farm so I just had to try it. I was really looking for a strawberry cheesecake so I basically built this pie on top of a no bake cheesecake. It's in the freezer chilling but I already tasted the topping and it is SO GOOD! I did cut back on the sugar a little bit and am glad I did.

This was sooo good.  I used part Splenda & part sugar & a little lemon juice.  I boiled the berries & sugar and added 3T cornstarch & 2/3 cup water & boiled this only 3 minutes until thick & clear. I think cornstarch loses its thickening ability if boiled too long-maybe that's why some pies didn't set completely.

Delicious and easy to make and chill in time for dinner!    We used fresh strawberries we picked from a local farm and made enough of the strawberry mixture to make two pies -- we used about 10 cups of strawberries.

Sorry, but I have to give a negative review. This pie filling closely resembled jam. I think that it would be much better without the mashed berries or perhaps on toast.

This is the easiest and most delicious strawberry pie I have ever made!!! I followed the advice of MANY others. I only used 3/4 c sugar, used 4 tbsp of cornstarch and only simmered the strawberries/cornstarch mixture for about 3 minutes, that's all it took to thicken it. I did chill it overnight, it set beautifully. I just bought a can of whipped cream and topped it before I served it. I can't wait to make it again and add a painted layer of melted chocolate mentioned in another review. YUMMY!!!

Pie turned out great!  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water.  Perfect sweetness and not runny at all.  I did cook the strawberry mixture for at least ten minutes to make sure as much moisture as possible evaporated.  Also, I chilled it over night.  When they say it needs to chill for several hours, they mean it.

I made this the way the recipe read. I didn't change anything. It was good. Next time, I do think that I will cut down the sugar and add more whole fruit to the bottom and a little less to the cornstarch mixture. Maybe a little lemon juice too.

This pie tasted good, but the filling turned out to be runny even after being in the fridge for a day and a half.  It was nice and thick while I was boiling it, though.  Based on previous reviews, I used lemon juice instead of water and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also put the whipped cream all over the top of the pie and put a small circle of six sliced strawberries in the center to garnish.  I used a premade graham crust, brushed with egg and baked 5 minutes to prevent it from being soggy.  It all tasted nice, but I really wish the filling wouldn't run like it did.

Pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because it should actually be called Strawberry Jam Pie, and that's not what i was expecting. But i LOVE strawberry jam, so it's a winner with me!

My first attempt at strawberry pie and it was easy as..um...pie. I reduced the sugar too. I also wish I had sliced up the fresh strawberries at the bottom a bit more. A success!

An excellent easy to make pie! I was intimidated by making this but it was all done in 15 minutes...and that was two pies (doubled the recipe)! It set very nicely as well. The only thing I did different was reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.

I adapted this recipe for blueberries, putting 2 cups of the berries, 3/4 cup of sugar (my berries were a bit tart), 1/2  cup of water, and a squirt of lemon juice in a blender. The berry puree was then put in a large saucepan, and I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe, except that the cornstarch was mixed in the remaining 1/4 cup of water before adding to the boiling puree.

Yummy!  I was especially happy to find a recipe that shows how to make this without using a packet of strawberry jell-o!  I didn't have so many strawberries so I only crushed 1 cup to add to the sugar, water mix and it still turned out really well and flavorful.  Thank you!

I pretty much fallowed the filling recipe, but I ran out of flour so I made it into mini tarts by making a crust out of crushed animal crackers and butter. Just press crust into muffin liners, add half a strawberry and top with glaze and whipped cream. The family loved it.

i love this recipe! i found it to be a bit thick, next time i won't add the cornstarch mix all at once, but instead start with just half into the strawberry syrup, and see how it goes from there, flavour was wonderful, to counter the sweetness a little, i added a splash of balsamic vinegar... definitely a keeper!!

Very good. The glaze was the best part. I would suggest using you own recipe for the crust rather than use a prepared one.

Love the glaze! I bought a store brand glaze, got it home, tasted it and came directly to all recipes to find this recipe! I pureed the strawberries with my mini food processor before cooking. I added red food coloring to the cornstarch mixture and made sure I cooked it for the full ten minutes (after it started to boil) before removing it from the stove and spooning it over my fresh cut strawberries.  I used a gramcracker crust and can't wait for it to set-up and taste it! Yummy!

The flavor of this was phenominal, but mine never really set up.  In the picture, it's nice and firm, but mine stayed pretty soft, even the next day.  I baked the pie crust with a brushing of egg white, so it didn't get soggy, and I loved the flavor, so I'll definitely make it again, just will try cooking the glaze part longer.

Bake crust for 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees. Buy 2 pkgs of strawberries. 3/4 of strawberries hulled and halved in pie. 1/4 of strawberries sliced and made into strawberry sauce with 3/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water, 3 TBSP of corn starch. All in pot at same time, turn to medium high, stir constantly until boiling and then another 2-3 minutes. Throwdown: Pie

This pie turned out great - so great that I made it twice in one week! My family couldn't get enough of it. Followed all the suggestions left by Misty and the Bunnies, but also added the melted chocolate suggestion by Bteammom. Coating the baked pie crust with melted chocolate put this recipe over-the-top wonderful.

Would have been five stars, but I'm pretty sure the recipe needs some major modifications. It didn't set up at all. It was a lot of work for a runny mess. I would stick with a recipe that calls for strawberry jello.

This pie was easy to make, but didn't really wow me. Maybe I just have to make it again later in the season when the strawberries are better. It would not all fit into the pie crust, so there was less of the crushed strawberry mixture than the recipe called for in the pie. However, that was the part that I liked least, so that was a bonus. Thanks!

This was very good tasting, but the presentation wasn't very nice after you poured the syrup over the top.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it was pink instead of red? I will probably try a different recipe next time to see how that looks.

Delicious and simple recipe. Only thing I didn't like was the way it looked, think I prefer a clear glaze over the fresh strawberries, would have been much more appealing and attractive.

The pie tasted good, but it wasn't phenomenal like I was expecting from the other reviews. Maybe it is because I changed the recipe according to the other reviews. Instead of half mashed and half in the shell I used 3/4 in the shell and 1/4 mashed. I cut back on the sugar and it was still extremely sweet. Maybe it would be best made as the recipe calls for.

This recipe was a hit to everyone who tasted it.  So fresh and delicious.  I made it with a slightly salty pie crust, and that was a really nice contrast to the sweet berries.

Good but too soupy.  Next time would decrease the amount of strawberries going into the pot by half.  Reminded me of frozen strawberries or a strawberry topping for ice cream.

This is the only way we like strawberry pie.  Not ccooking the strawberries keeps is fresh tasting.  It is a must in strawberry season but I do use less sugar. This, for our taste, is just too sweet and hides the fresh fruit taste.  Granted others like their desserts sweet! Whatever, it is an excellent recipe and always popular.

This recipe was fantastic!  I had never made glaze from scratch before, always buying the packages from the grocery store.  This recipe was easy to follow, and delicious!  I had fresh-picked strawberries that had to get used up, or they were going to go soggy on me, and the grocery store was closed, so I looked for a "from scrath" recipe, and came across this one!  Will definitely use it again, and pass this recipe on to my mom!

I just made this pie for a family get-together and I received the highest compliments :)
The ONLY thing I would change is perhaps cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup?  It was a little on the sweet side...but it still was amazing!  I topped it with whipped cream around the edges and drizzled melted chocolate!  Mmmm mmm!

I couldn't keep my kids from licking their plates...I wanted to lick my plate!  I never need another recipe - Thank you.  I second the suggestions to use fresh berries from the farm and adding a little butter for thickness.

Awesome!!  I cut down slightly on the sugar and water, and the pie was absolutely perfect.  Took it along with the homemade whipped cream to a family picnic and received rave reviews!  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is really good!  I made one pie according to directions and another pie using Splenda.   This makes a very good sugar free pie.  You can barely tell the difference.  But it is sweeter using the sugar, which makes it a tad better!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really simple recipe that produces a great tasting goo.  I used small strawberries that were picked that morning at a local farm.  The color was very red and the taste very refreshing and light.

You don't even really need the whipped cream for this one if the berries are nice.

DELICIOUS!  Perfect amount of glaze.  We quartered the strawberries and topped with real whipped cream.  Also used a pre-maid graham crust.

Edited to add:  I made this for a second time and it turned out PERFECT!  I didn't bring it to a rolling boil the first time and it set up in about 2 mintues this time!  The taste is amazing!First review: I made this today and it never set.  I followed the directions exactly.  I'm going to try it again though because I had to have done something wrong based on all the good reviews!  I have a TON of strawberries from my garden so it will be no problem to try again!

This pie was very easy to make.  It was my first attempt at strawberry pie and I must say I couldn't have picked a more simple recipe.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions to allow the filling to cool before pouring it into the crust.  Next time I plan to get creative and add a layer of cheese cake to the bottom before adding the filling.

My mom and I went strawberry picking and I decided to try this recipe for strawberry pie instead of the normal jell-o recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was sooo delicious...everyone loved it. So much better than the jell-o version. I will use this one from now on. Thank You!

Halved the sugar in this recipe, and pureed half the strawberries instead of mashing them. This recipe just didn't quite give me the clear strawberry glaze I was looking for. (It does however, taste like jam!)

This was great! I changed the recipe a little. Instead of mashing the strawberries, I used strawberry pie filling as sauce. Then, I just put all the whole strawberries in it. I loved it!

This was an interesting way to prepare and use strawberries in a dessert. You have to really love strawberries! I liked another person's opinions to put melted chocolate in the crust before pudding the strawberry mixture!

I made this for Easter and it was good, everyone said they liked it. It was pretty easy to make and I used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie crust. It just didn't have the pretty red color I was hoping for, it was kind of a pale red/pink color. The 2nd day it looked even less appetizing. I did add a few dashes of some allspice and ginger when the strawberries were cooking. I will make it again but maybe not for such a large gathering.

Excellent!  I was looking for an easy-to-make pie that was perfect for a hot day.  I took BTEAMMOM's advice of painting the crust with melted chocolate, and that was great.  I also mashed only 1/4 of the strawberries like Misty suggested, and used 3/4 c. sugar and 1/2 c. water.  It didn't set as well as I'd have liked, but I think I just didn't boil it enough (I was a little impatient!)  Nonetheless, the chocolate coating on the bottom made it easy to serve without  it breaking into pieces.  Delicious!  If I did it over, I'd probably use another cup of strawberries just to have more in there.  As it was, the jammy part evenly distributed over the pie.

Not sure what I did wrong, but my pie was very runny. I stirred the strawberry cornstarch mix for 25 minutes and it only thickened a little. Next time I will add more cornstarch. Even though my pie didn't set, my kids picked at the runny strawberry mix. My 4 year old boy said, "Wow, mom this is the greatest pie I ever tasted!" So, I will try to make it again.

What a wonderful, simple, tasty pie! I didn't let mine set up long enough so it was still a little soupy but it was great!! I will definitely make this again. I didn't change anything.

This was fantastic! I actually used a graham cracker crust instead. I also took the advice of others and only mashed 1/4 of the strawberries to cook and pour over the others in the crust. I think it was a nice balance. Everyone really liked this recipe!

This is 5 stars for the taste, but I had to give it 4 stars because even though I decreased the amount of water and added cornstarch, it never set. I had to freeze it and eat it as a frozen dessert (which is okay too). I will make this again, but I will need to add more cornstarch. I even tried to add some unflavored gelatin to it to thicken it up a bit but it didn't work. bummer. But excellent taste! Add some vanilla extract and powdered sugar to the whipping cream to sweeten it up a bit.

This recipe was good, but not spectacular. As other reviewers mentioned it's really sweet (almost too sweet), the filling was runny and it seemed a little too much like jelly for my liking.

I made this a few days ago and it was really good but a little too sweet and I love my sweets!  Part of that might have been the berries themselves were really sweet.  I will make this again but cut back on the sugar.  Thanks for a refreshing recipe!

Worked just as written very well. I was very happy with the results and so was my family. I will definitely use this recipe again, and maybe play with it a bit, but am excited to have found such a simple recipe that I could prepare in the afternoon and have right after dinner. thank you!

Really good! I used brown sugar, instead of white sugar, and used less than a cup... I also added cherries and blueberries! Tasted AMAZING!!

Very easy and very good!  I made these into tarts using frozen tart shells and putting half a large strawberry in each.  Served with whipped cream on top (made with a dash of vanilla).  Delicious.

Yum!  I thought that 3 tbsp. of corn starch overpowered the taste in the saucepan, so I added strawberry gelatin mix (about 2 tbsp.) to even out the flavor.  Served it w/lite whipped topping, and it was great!

I got these huge strawberries and I thought they would be great but they were way to big.  My crust could not hold the massive strawberries and crumbled under the pressure. Extremely delicious though.  I used a shortbread  crust. It was great even though I ended up with strawberry crumble instead of pie!

I made this as directed and it was great! I did think it looked a little strange - kind of milky. So I covered the whole thing with whipped cream and it looked great. Most important - it was very easy and yummy! Thanks!

The pie never jelled despite stirring on the stove for 20+ minutes.  Ended up using it as a topping on frozen lemonade pie because it was otherwise useless.

Simple to make with a pre-made crust and it's got a wonderful taste!.  I used the 3/4 cups of sugar and it was perfect.  Everyone raved about it, with people being quite upset that I hadn't made 2 (for seconds!)

This will definately be one of my favorite summer desserts!

This was a great pie.  I cut the strawberries into slices instead of leaving them whole.  I figured it would be a little hard to eat.  Definitely enjoy this pie with whipped cream!

Great strawberry flavor!  I can't find the scrap of paper Mom wrote her strawberry pie recipe on, so was hoping I could find it out here.  Tada - this is it!!!  Try it - one piece is just a tease!  A perfect dessert for Easter!

So delicious!  I made this in muffin tins as small tartlettes, and it was a smash hit.  (Also, I added a small dash of vanilla pudding and chocolate syrup on top as suggested down below.  What a great addition to this fabulous recipe!)

I think next time I might add just a touch of balsamic vinegrette (maybe a tbsp or so) for an interesting kick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was a little on the sweet side - the crushed berry filling tasted like strawberry jam.  I guess I was expecting something more light and berry tasting.  I'll try again and cut back on the sugar a bit.

I served this at a bridal shower and everyone was wanting the recipe.  I used about a quart and a half of fresh strawberries but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I served it without the whipped cream topping and it was delicious.

I tried this pie this weekend after going strawberry picking.  It tasted wonderful but it didn't set up enough to get out of the pie plate without making a mess.  Maybe I should use a little more corn starch next time, I will try again since it did taste great.

this pie was great. my hubby, who hardly EVER comments on "sweets" told me over and over again how much he loved it. i accidentally used 1 c. water instead of 3/4 c. so it was a little "soft" but still delicious. i also sliced my strawberries to make it easier to eat.

I served this tonight for my son's birthday party.  Everyone loved it.  It was just right for a warm evening.  I only needed a half cup of sugar and put the filling into a homemade graham cracker crust.  The color was a pretty, deep pink, but didn't look like strawberry.  I wonder if using corn syrup instead of cornstarch would thicken the filling and preserve the natural strawberry color.

I made this pie following all the directions to a tee and it was easy to make and very yummy.  The day before I made this pie I made the other recipe for strawberry pie "Big GUY" and the crust stuck to the pan, so this time I just made a basic flaky Crisco crust and the contrast was really good.  The pie is sweet enough without a sweet crust, but with a hint of tartness from the whole berries.  Very good recipe!

Great recipe. Shortbread crust is best. No need to increase cornstarch but I did decrease water and added a splash of lemon juice. Used less sugar too. To thicken properly, you need a full 10 minute simmer. Also, no need to mash the berries first as they will process on the stovetop. Just slice. Thanks Lynn

Yummy in my tummy and a few other tummies too.  This is a great pie cool and tasty.  I made this with a ghram crust and did cut the sugar as my strawberries were plenty sweet.  I quartered my berries and added an additional cup to the uncooked berries.   I have had only one other strawberry pie that I felt was worth eating.  It had a delicate crust with a filling very similar to this one.  I have made other pies that have been well received but for myself most were just average strawberry pies.  
I plan to try this recipe with fresh raspberries too.  I and my daughter decorate cakes.  When I read another posters post, I decided to make the cooked portion of the pie with my own ratio of ingredients and came up with a less sweet filling.  Not as tart as apricot or raspberry but a great cake 
filling for my strawberry lovers.   Thank you for a great idea!  Thanxs Marge for a great recipe.  This will be added to my personal recipe book.  Give this one a try. It's worth trying!

Delicious, quick and easy.  I also used a graham cracker crust.  I cut sugar to 2/3 cup and it was still plenty delicious!

I know the reviews are very positive, but we did not enjoy this.  It was more like jello with a crust rathered than a glazed pie.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe for Strawberry Pie.  I did add a little extra constarch as some previous reviews suggested, and it turned out extremely well.  I just used a regular pie crust, it would probably have been 5 stars if I would have used a graham cracker crust - I am trying that next time!

Hurray!  Finally, here is the recipe that I learned in my high school cooking class.  I loved it then and made it all summer long. My family loved it too. Then I lost it.  This makes just the best, purest and easiest strawberry pie!

First of all, this pie tastes delicious.  It received rave reviews from my dinner guests despite it's appearance.  I did encounter the "runny pie" syndrome that other cooks mentioned in their reviews.  I would definitely recommend adding an additional tablespoon of cornstarch to the mixture so that the pie cures better in the fridge.  Other than that, this pie recipe is a keeper!!

I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch as mentioned by several other reviews, however I thought the finished pie had a cornstarch taste.  It did set wonderfully for me & cut easily & I had perfect pieces to serve but it's missing something.  Another recipe I have you also add 3T. strawberry jello & 1 T.lemon juice, I will try this recipe again & add the jello & lemon juice & hopefully that will give it a little more flavor.

I made this for a VFW meeting and the fella's just loved it. I wasn't too crazy about the jelly texture personally, but it was very tasty for such an easy pie. I followed the recipe exactly. Had I read other reviews first I probably would've added more corn starch. To keep it as solid as possible for serving, I froze it the night before and then put it in the fridge the morning of the meeting. Topped with cool whip before serving made for better presentation.

A math equation: 7 kids + 2 strawberry pies + 5 minutes = more dirty dishes and smiling kids. What a super spring recipe. First strawberries for a strawberry pie.  I went just a bit heavier on the corn starch. Thanks Marge for sharing such a SUPER RECIPE.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did different was to use a shortbread crust and added some red food coloring to the strawberry mixture.  Thanks Marge!  I've done tons of cooking in my life, but never made a strawberry pie, always was just strawberry shortcake.  I had some strawberries to use or loose and didn't want strawberry shortcake again and my hubby suggested strawberry pie.  I picked a winner recipe!  This is so easy and the strawberry mixture jelled perfectly.  Thanks again!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe! Yum! It turned out great!.....I did do a few things different tho....like adding 4 tablespoons of cornstarch in stead of 3,to make it thicker. Plus I used frozen strawberries.....and sliced them instead of smashed them.....also cook the berries for  the full 10 minutes or a bit more....that will really thicken it so it will set good. This deserves a 2 thumbs up. Easy and yummy. Top w/cool whip-yum! I chilled mine overnight---perfect.

Great way to use up all the strawberries my family picked at the strawberry patch! And when I brought the pie over to my in-laws for dessert one day, I couldnt beleive the compliments over such an easy to prepare pie. Thanks for sharing the recipe and making me a star!

Much Too runny.  I"ll be trying another strawberry pie recipe the next time.  The only saving grace was that the filling was very tasty.  But the presentation was not good.
